========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] such an honor to be here as always always coming home if I could ask my wife to come up here she's gonna get me but I was instructed by your pastor to do this well she's coming I want to read a verse of scripture if you don't mind Psalms 37 verse 4 says delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the Lord Trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass my wife and I had been desiring a child and we've been trying for about two years now and it just seems like every time we would think that we were that way we would come up on another roadblock and and we would begin to think of things that we did in our past that that may affect our future by starting a family and things of that nature and we began to to just pray over the last year and and began to really seek God in the situation because as many of you know I was the only green grandson of brother Henry my dad being the only boy so we want to carry on that lineage as long as the Lord of latest let us stay on the earth here so we began to pray and really seek the face of God with the situation and come camp meeting that Wednesday night when brother Ron was speaking on if he could stand behind the curtain and he wouldn't be able to see him or hear hid and disguise his voice and just just tell you what God has for you my wife was actually behind the curtain the whole time there she was running the PowerPoint and kind of helping with the Psalms and everything and she really began to just pray and cry out to God and she would she would say that if brother on he had already walked off the stage walked past this and walked past her I was still on the stage there and he would come back because she know the gift that brother Ron had in his life and how he yields herself to the Holy Spirit she said if we're to be prayed for he'll come back by and as soon as I walked off the stof the stage behind the curtain really run and turned around and come back our way and he looked at me you know if any of you have been here long enough you've seen brother Ron when he gets in that channel and it looks like he's staring dead through you he looked at me he said go get your wife so I walked over and I got sister Kaitlyn by the hand and we come back over to where he was at and he began to speak words to us and pray and he would say that your future is not affected by the things in your past and it was just just an answer to prayer to us and as he began to say these words and pray over us and when he was done he said you can go have that baby now and I just want to give the devil a black eye right now and here's a picture of a miracle Satan this is a picture of what a miracle looks like I know that many of you it's been here oh wait you're done oh Jesus but I'm not done yet we were prayed for the first week in August this little miracle is due the first week in August exactly a year to the date from we were prayed for now I don't have to stand here and tell you about the miracles that have come to pass that the miracles that are going to come to pass because if you've been in this message long enough for this message has been in you long enough you've seen miracles I can go a step further with that if you've been in this church any amount of time and you still don't believe in miracles and there's no hope for you the God that your pastor yields himself to is not just a God of right of yesterday he's a God of right now he's here to meet your needs he's here to perform miracles and

uncomfortable amen want to put to flight a thousand - ten thousands let's pray together Almighty God we look to you now father you know all things and where everything has been placed into your hands and the most supernatural thing about us is our tongue from our heart we begin to speak what you have placed there on a revelation from your from from the Word of God we begin to speak your word inspired and influenced and anointed by the Holy Ghost now father this is your service this is your time we're predestinated for such a moment as this father there's not just victory for this church but victory for the bride around the world and I asked you to anoint us in a supernatural way now father Lord if it fits your will for me to be in Japan you know how to get me there if it's your will for me to be in the Philippines you know how to get me there if it's your will for me to stand at an Easter camp you know how to get me there so we place our self into your hands tonight father like I've done every other situation in my life Lord I'm in your hands Lord do with what you need to do father get the glory that you need to have I am your servant I surrender myself to you I repeat your words and create an atmosphere in this church in my home in our lives father in the hospitals Lord may the Spirit of God and the angels of God be present not just a hill but to feel minister to us this evening we thank you for what you are doing gonna do will do in Jesus Christ's name we receive it by the power of your word in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen you can be seated and say let's have church brother branham is speaking in conflict between God and Satan that's a good place to start in it he said I'm thinking about a little antelope one time that he got out of the refuge and the hounds were were after him and he was running for his dear life and when he come to the fence where the refuge was he he turned around and looked at those hounds because he was safe they could not climb the fence they wasn't built that way and if they touch that fence they'd be knocked back with electrical shock that's the way we are Lord when we get behind the fence the defense of God's Word the electrical power of the Holy Spirit stands our enemy off and he cannot hurdle the fence he's not made that way we think thee that thou has made us so that we can jump for safety Lord into Christ Jesus and we're so glad Lord that we're safe evermore and possessing the gate of the enemy he said he cared enough he cared enough to conquer every enemy for you that you will have to do just to be sincere he conquered death death ain't nothing for me to conquer it's already conquered sickness ain't nothing for me to conquer it ain't nothing Christ conquered it he says he says I just have to it I just have to believe it are you afraid of what somebody else has told you are you afraid of what the doctors diagnosis are you afraid of what the church will say to you are you afraid to to stand and lay aside everything I believed every word and Here I am Lord created me you can't for me and I care for you when he was here on earth he conquered and possessed every gate that the enemy had the royal seed he possessed it by the word he conquered it he conquered the gate of sickness for us that's what he come to do remember sick people he conquered the gate I say a man you don't have to conquer and he conquered it the other man had to conquer their own gate but you don't have to conquer it's already conquered he conquered the gates of sickness and what did they do when he conquered the gates of sickness saying whatever you asked on earth whatever you bind on earth will be bound him on heaven whatever you bind in heaven he says I'll give you the key keys to the gate he conquered the gate of temptations by the word the keys resists the intamin he'll flee from you he conquered it he conquered all sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered death in hell he conquered what others could not conquer because they were of the natural seed and this is the spiritual seed he conquered the gates of the grave and he rose up on the third day for our justification so we're more than conquerors we'll just walk right into it that's into an inheritance we're more than conquerors sickness is defeated death is defeated hallelujah Hallet sofy today many like you believe it hallelujah revelation the church age book he says as I've already said this book of revelations the consummation of the Scriptures it is evenly placed exactly right in the the Canon of the scriptures at the end now you can know why that it says that anyone who reads or even hears it it is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you the authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take away from it would be cursed and it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome and overcome the enemy brother Tim wrote me this and I like I like it general I have lots brother Donnie told me yesterday it's all right to have likes he said Jesus liked certain things but the Tim wrote me this and if he's listening he'll be aware of that he says diseases are demon spirits who like their masters Satan seek bodies to do harm in they come to dwell in order to do harm they are as a thief that comes to steal to kill and destroy all bodies where the Christian are not are vulnerable to Satan's invasion due to the fault demons within sinners use their bodies to do their dirty work in them they use their power to defile and to destroy and abuse other people and animals and the environment Satan then uses these defile ones as his own missionaries to defile other innocent people God almost also must use human instruments anointed and filled by the Holy Ghost to bless to inspire to encourage others who need God's help demons are not to be feared the weakest Christian can use his word to cast them out people fear them because they don't understand their position and have never heard that my their legal defeat of Christ of our Lord the taken of the book of the title and the open of the seals is a triumph of the bloody lamb which opens to us all the possibilities within the book we need not live below our privileges any longer the ownership to our inheritance has never been more sure give the Lord a good hand right there [Applause] let's go back and find some a man of Abraham seed under the Jewish covenant then bring it down to the Gentiles when we were drafted over from the Jewish Age to the Gentile age to take the people for his name let's just say take some man who was the seed of Abraham and see if they possess the gates of their enemy let's take for instance let's just speak a moment when the children of Israel had been carried away down into the captivity into Babylon there cometh Tom first had to come to a trial and there's always trials it's always darkest before the day in nature and you'll always have trials before you can have a victory if there's no war then there's no victory and the Hebrew children down there had been brought to a spot where the King had made a declaration than anybody that would not bow to this image would be thrown into the fiery furnace into that furnace of fire rather and he said well and then they purposed in their heart that they was not going to defile themselves they were going to live close to God the three Hebrew children Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they were the seed of Abraham and they had a promise of God that his seed would possess the gates of their enemy and I'd imagine when that trial come up what's the first thing that a child of God has for a refuge when a trial comes notice these next words the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of mankind prayer heard Andrew speak last night I thought that was a phenomenal sermon you haven't heard it go back and listen to it who is this among us not who that was among us 2,000 years ago or 50 years ago 10 years ago seems like so quickly I've been here 20 years he's your pastor that went quick we can see that God's up to date are you guys okay are you guys okay look over what your neighbor said we're gonna have Church here we can see by the gist of the pictures that were just up here just a few moments ago God did every one of those things no man's a healer no doctors a healer no preachers a healer I know we have our likes and we like this one or we're we're more attached to this minister of that ministry but that man can heal you Jesus is the healer when brother Branham was standing there and that little girl with those blond eyes and those cataracts and rinsed around her and she grabbed a hold to his lapel which he realized who brother Branham was when you realize your moment when you realize your moment like Jacob did when you realize your moment that I'm standing in a special spot there was a special spot that night when I was standing up they were out there on the platform that night and sharing the meeting with brother Tom ray and I preached for about an hour hour and twenty minutes and I preached and it was like I was preaching against a brass wall and I kept asking the audience to get with me get with me get with me and just a couple of people came down for prayer and I'd made a declaration if I could stand behind the curtain and God could use me behind a curtain not even hear my voice when the microphones off and I'm behind the curtain then God did a miracle but it was the same God that was standing behind the pulpit but there was a girl praying the wrong I didn't get nothing out of service but there is a girl praying it's what you pull for it's what you come to see it's what your expectation is [Applause] I'm preaching my way into a miracle I don't know what you came to do you may be watching your watch and you're in a hurry you're dismissed but I am taking God's Word and preaching and cutting my way into a victory what will you do at your last testimony what will you do at your last sermon I want to preach every sermon like it's my last and I've been doing that for a long time so don't think that I'm thinking this is my last I want to give God everything everything [Applause] Paul said it like this in first Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 3 and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling I was down praying yesterday in my office and I was praying I I just said I was having a moment we all have human moments and I was having a moment and brother Isaiah Brooks he said he was sitting in his office and he said funny he said I had a meeting scheduled and then I was supposed to go to another spot and he said everything was canceled and I was sitting here in my office and he said God spoke to me and he said call Ron Spencer I'd say it's been two years since Isaiah's call me we've text Michael Voris but it's two years since he called me we've spoken a meeting it had brother Henry Simmons last year and and I don't know if I'm gonna stick there but if we do I want you to go with me are you with me are you with me and he said brother Ron he said I want to tell you Jesus wept in his humanity he wept and as a human he got hungry and as a human he got angry but as o'clock he raised up and as God he said Lazarus step forth I having the phone up after I was after we enjoyed a wonderful conversation and in two minutes brother Donnie Regan calls and just for reassurance he begins to talk to me about the dual nature of a man and how a man is human and how we express our human weaknesses he said but the glimpse of God that dear till raise up inside of you and speak to the devil and of course my buddy brother Tim brooked has preached to me all week long he has hired me with atomic power all week long it won't stop today it won't stop next week he said brother Ron you guys shouldn't be so close we are brothers Paul said I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and the power for the Ender sent me this today let Satan come in for deep cold to the deep let's Satan take after a believer let's Satan take after a believer and he's got Jesus Christ on his hands let's Satan take after you and because you are who you are preach with me and because you are who you are and because you are who you are you got God DNA inside of you hallelujah you may have European or Canadian or Russian or Filipino you may have all kind of flesh DNA that's on the inside of you might be surprised what all is on the inside of you but the great thing about you is God predestinated the seed of God on the inside of you not when you walk to an older but before the foundation of the world and he watched over that seed all the way from there all the way to mankind all the way at this point and if God could get you here he'll get you there hallelujah Acts chapter 3 says Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give a thing in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and he took he mother hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leave me up stood and walked and entered him with them into the temple walking that's a great big word when you never did it that's a great big word when you remember did it hallelujah this is day one he's walking brother on I just started serving the Lord well that's day one and there's a long journey in front of you keep walking I don't care what comes your way you keep walking if you fall down you get back up again I guess grace you get back up run run but I did this and I did this and I did this and I do this there's nothing that the blood of Jesus Christ cannot take care of Jairus the blood of Jesus Christ power ever work in power yes hallelujah that's the greatest miracle we send the dead race we've seen us we've seen people come out of wheelchairs we've seen cancers fall we've seen every disease but the greatest miracle is the transformation of your soul from dope addict prostitute no matter what you are and being a religious nut it's just as bad as any of the other maybe worse because you can't save yourself as we will baptize in a few minutes said repent that's where you got to do the repentance not some Catholic father standing over top of you and doing some magic warm you did the sin you do the repentant repentance is to turn away I'm never gonna go back to that place again repentance is not I got caught everybody saw her when they did caught politicians Kings preachers Oh everybody sorry when they get caught but that's not repentance [Applause] everybody wants to come to God when they're in trouble prisons are full of religious people but you know why they can live right there they got boundaries come on you might as well preach with me we got a while here but God wants you to overcome lay on the sill he puts you in the worst day that there is and he gives you an inoculation over sin you can't hold yourself so God gave you something that's an inoculation for the Laodicean flu repent every one of you prophets children kings children my children everybody's got to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins well I've been baptized this way that way if it hasn't in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you have not been baptized right brother on our sprinkle that's a baby that's not bad touched I was sprinkled in a little pool that's not bad does I was baptizing Father Son and Holy Ghost that's not bad does that's not Christian baptism I don't care what the Pope says I don't want care what the Pentecostal associations down here say I don't care what none of them say Father Son Holy Ghost baptized only connects you to the Roman Catholic Church [Applause] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost because you can't do it with your own emotion oh brother on I got worked up I'm gonna come back to church I'm you're gonna be my pastor forever most times I hear that you're going to be my pastor forever don't never see them again let me just say if it's emotion you'll be gone after about six months you'll be gone because your energies are run out and the battles will come because every Sun that come up the God has to be chastised has to be tested let me just say it a faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted I'll say it again a faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted it's not allow me I'm not looking for pity or sorrow I'm looking for you to take the amateur God that's on the inside of you and cut our weight of that threat don't let your fear and your wearing and your agonizing I'm expecting you to pray and I'm expecting you to pray with power not some medal now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take but I'm talking about talking to God I'm afraid in America that's what we've done we've allowed our self to fall in a rut and we come to church without pray and that's the reason we don't get nothing we want the preacher to do it all we want the singers to do it all we want the minister to get us in revival shape clap our hands knock knock and go to McDonald's and eat this is more than a convenience gospel this message is to create a body change there will be a resurrection and there will be a rapture we're not building an association appear on the hill where we have just a good bunch of church anity where we like a Clinton and we're in a Social Forum we're preparing for rapture a lady walked in the door back there and she said I'm looking for a church that fits me and I told her we don't work that way she walked all the way down the aisle size stood up like she was a building inspector looked around at everything here walked backed out hands on her hips and I thought baby you in the wrong house today and she told me she said I'm looking for a church that fits me I said they don't work like that him I don't work that like that here we have to fit the work now I know that most pulpits today here in Virginia is giving a political speech so I'm just gonna give one here for about two minutes Virginia is all worked up over a gun deal and we do have an governor that's made some silly silly things people say that he's kicked the hornet's nest and there's people that's in buses and everywhere headed tomorrow for a for a conference go if you won't do I'm not gonna stop you you're right go but let me just say it's polite politics come from hell we're headed for a Tribulation Period you can't stop it from coming I don't care what you do governments will do what they're going to do with one percent power brother Branham told us that's the way it would work in China that's the way it worked in Russia that's the way it'll work in America they'll put in who they want to put in they'll work you up and they'll tell you they're going to give you all the things that you want to get and then well brother on we need to defend arms ok defend this if they could take that much energy and take the Word of God this is the greatest armor that you'll ever have they're not gonna take away my high-powered rifle they're not gonna take away my pistols they took away your Word of God they took away your revival out of your churches and you elected you some Softsoap pastors that kiss babies on the head and will not dare preach on women how they are addressed and live how they ought to be real men so you have been disarmed from the pulpit come on church without amis that passion of the Bible word of God I refuse to be defeated I refuse to give it back I refused to give up my god-given rights I'm not going to give up this acts 2:38 my Jesus is a devil killing he's a Waterwalker he'll walk through the fire he'll walk to the store he'll walk till your graveyard he'll raise you up in the middle of your sickness my god Wow somewhere in hell there's a meeting going on and head devil saying boys I thought your head that got sick boys I thought joy done scared deliver on that guy we did he had him shaken we had him crying he got up he woke up he recognized Jesus ascending about what are we going to do when Jesus said about when he wakes up he says peace [Applause] when I was a boy I'm not proud of this but when I was a boy it was a man about six foot four weighed quite a bit more than I did he decided to fight and he decided he was gonna whip me he decided that when I got done with him he was off for a week from his job and he came back in his eyes were blocked his face were swelled had teeth missing his lips were huge he had bruised ribs and he told everybody around that he got beat by gangs so when you pick a fight with one of God's generals you're going to go back to hell with your eyes puffing and your teeth knocked out and your lips all swelled out and you may not even show up in hell for about two weeks before you report back I ran into one of God's soldiers up there and he took the Word of God and all these years you

[Applause] if your sinner you want to sin you'll be right into it if you say you're Christian believe it all along God will make bring your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confess it and God will make your body obey your confession for he's the high priest of your confession said is the right hand of the Father now with his own blood to make intercessions for any confession upon anything that he died for second karani of course 21st 15 be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's get all the things away from you and say mister Satan you are defeated Jesus Christ stripped you of every power that you had when he died at Calvary and you're nothing but a bluff you can't boss me I'm a lot of stuff that don't Bluff that's what come from Calvary hallelujah don't Bluff don't receive it so step aside I'm moving on for Christ now it's been said and it's true that cowards not ten thousand times where a hero never dies God wants people who are brave and can take their stand and if anything that Christ could use could not use in his kingdom would be a coward have faith in God and the first thing we should find out what faith is the Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and this little word faith gets mixed up a lot of times with hope and hope and faith they're just as much different as the day is from not Satan your offense to me get out of my way of the name of Jesus Christ and he left them said the sweetest fro a voice said I've ever heard in my life that said don't fear to go anywhere don't fear to do anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go I'm gonna read it again the sweetest voice that I've ever heard in my life said no fear to do anywhere and no fear to do anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus crisis with you wherever you he says when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired words the two inspirations together gives a result no matter how well you study the word it'll never do you any good till you're inspired yourself it takes your inspiration with the word that's already inspired what we do today with the inspiration over us God's sweeping down in that new inspiration breathing over us his power his love and himself that it might inspire us to quicken us and waken us to his word and then the word being brought into that spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen then you'll see miracles happen proof of his resurrection this is either the Word of God or it's a deceiving book it's either right or it's wrong it's either all right or all wrong every word is inspired or none of them is inspired I'll come back and get some of this that day on Calvary he said Lord we know that the Lord now art God and after reading this sacred holy word we can see that your nature has not changed you're always God it seemed like that Jesus was not going to have any help and he was taken by wicked hands and hacked to pieces and spit on and mocked and hanging on a cross bleeding and dying it seemed like there was no help no were tell even he cried to himself my God my God why hast thou forsaken me but you act in the moment that that when nothing else cannot we're given to know Lord that if we have any rivers that we cannot cross if we have any mountains that we cannot go through God specializes in doing things and others cannot do you are a specialist on the job for you know the reason on that day on Calvary you be in God the infinite one knew this hour must come but when it was fulfilled then you showed that you were God you showed who the boss was you shook the earth and the Saints that slip in the ground came out you blackened the Sun and the not as the darkness of night showing that you were God but you seemed to be solid let us draw this conclusion that as long as we're walking in the spirit led by the hand of God no matter what seems to be wrong yeah we are facing Calvary God will speak in the right hour in the right hour at the right time the Randi and one of your darkest times you call me you said I've grabbed a hold of one scripture and I hang on to that scripture and I quote that scripture and I quote that scripture and I quote that scripture I can tell you where I was at when you call me I was going right past when you know what I forget the store my brother Homer said here to come to me where we turn at Sammie's and we go across and we go to that stop stop sign new hope grocery and I was at New Hope grocery going across at the stop sign and you call me I found that to be a critical call because that was a call I was waiting on somebody help me now come on until it's anchored in your heart Satan can whisper in your ear your uncle had it your sister had it your grandma's had it and Satan in your ear whispering I'm gonna kill you with it but pardon could that

for a bit can give me just few more minutes this is God's Word surely God is my salvation and I will trust and not be afraid the Lord the Lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation you can a man anytime it's a word of God through faith in Christ we are given a spirit of power and of love and a discipline and for that reason we have nothing to feel and we can hold on to his promises and be confident that he'll see us through even the darkest of days for God did not give us a spirit of Timothy by the spirit of powers and a flood Psalms with 1:38 and three when I called

alive this is not my first war they said I'd never walk again they said I'd never preach again they said I'd die through the knot this is not my first war and I want to remind you that if Jesus did it for me one time I want to remind you if Jesus did it for me one gum if God was powerful enough one time he's powerful enough again now that don't mean you take your battles lightly that don't mean you
