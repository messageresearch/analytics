11 so remember the time changes on each each of those we we've moved up the uh the saturday time just to to help with people getting in and then also brother brother tim will be speaking and not that he'll take all evening but we want him to have liberty and and just be able to just move as he sees fit and not just him the lord amen that's what we want we could have a huge gathering but if the lord don't come it means nothing amen so just be mindful of the meeting and parking and then if if you could just make sure you take any of the the bags and stuff with you that you would usually have at your seats because you may not have the seat that you usually have come this weekend so just be mindful of that and we're gonna try to fit as many people in here as we can because there's many people that's going to be driving a long way and we want to be able to feel welcome in the building amen so just try not to take up seats as much as you can and just squish together as we can and we might have to do the stand up move in sit down stand up move in sit down okay and uh i'm sure there's some people that'll be standing on their feet the whole time but the ministers will be too so so we can do that amen amen and if there's anything as far as that needs to be taken care of during the services if you would just let brother alden or one of the deacons know and uh that we can handle that situation there whatever it may be so god bless you you can be seated at this time well that's brother fred perry if you come sing for us this morning amen yes brother freddie you get to go first

for us all amen what an atmosphere of worship this morning what an awesome atmosphere so good to be in the house of the lord so good to see each and every one of you and we certainly love you with all of our hearts you can be seated just for a moment amen amen i want to continue to remember brother roger and sister ann lee and roxy his wife and the family the loss of their their daughter and sister pray that god would just be with them in a supernatural way and just touch them loss is very difficult and we've all at some point in life have had to experience that there will come a resurrection that's the promise we go down and we'll come right back up israel throughout the ages have went down and bopped right back up god's bopping them back up amen god's for you how can you lose amen amen thank you for the preparations for the meeting that is upcoming most of all we want to be praying for the meeting that god would anoint for this area what god once said from brother timothy pruitt that just spoke with brother brother andrew and i'm having timothy for more than just a reason of having tim but timothy is a convention speaker on his own you know his daddy didn't call him and i couldn't call these boys but god called him timothy has a kind of ministry that it seems like it's awful quiet there for a little bit and then all of a sudden the building blows up that's why i like it so much you know he'll be on a wednesday night to be on on a thought and he'll be preaching along and then all of a sudden the building blows up and you go wow i didn't see it that way ever before amen and so we're looking forward to having him he'll be speaking on friday night brother tim is is going to be speaking on saturday night and then brother donny reagan on sunday morning and we're certainly looking forward to what god would say to us amen we have reaped and sowed and sowed and we reaped now it's our time to reap a little bit we've sowed to the world and and preached a lot of meetings in our lives now as people come in we will host them kind of like you host in a family at your house and you get everything just right you get all the toys took away the floors are cleaned and everything's just right table is set now you're the host and so we're looking forward to hosting the bride of jesus christ couldn't host the better people in the whole world to me the greatest ministry that there is is in the bride of jesus christ and we're so looking forward to that we'd like to thank you for your giving we don't say much about money here but we thank you for your giving that makes all of this possible meetings are extremely expensive thank you for your giving we'll take one offering and that will that will take care of the ministry and the tithes and offerings so you'll know that that we're going to be doing it that way and so uh we are sure do appreciate your giving us as a body you've always been just so gracious to that and so we thank you for that amen we love you with all of our hearts amen amen we have a special announcement we want to make today brother catherine brother brandon and sister catherine are expecting a brand new baby [Applause] brother thomas your house is going to be full of grandbabies and that's the greatest thing that there is i just love to hear the noise of my babies when they're just in there and just noisy i'm not one of those nervous grandpas i just i just like to hear them get noisy when they get noisy i know that's a sign of life it's a sign of life they're running and they're playing and hey once in a while they break something it's all good we did too so amen amen brother brandon would you and sister catherine come and i'd like to pray with you this morning as you carry this baby [Music] andrew would you help me [Music] i'm so proud so proud [Music] you got a new house you got a baby room now we got a baby get ready to come heavenly father the greatest gift that we could have is life lord to be able to as man and a woman to be able to reproduce herself you place that inside of us the want to do that now satan likes to get into it sometimes cause problems but i ask you that the angel of god would watch over watch over this baby as it grows in the womb father you're the one that speaks life to a womb i ask you that you'd bless this home bless their lives to now become one in this child i ask you that you bless them this day in jesus christ's name amen amen [Music] i love you i'm proud of you i love you i'm so [Music] i'll just proud any good to us is any good to us amen amen we love you with all of our hearts we don't get that chance to tell you later we love you with all of our hearts he's certainly good to us amen maybe of a need today that you'd like to just say lord jesus would you touch me today come by my way amen heavenly father we sense the presence of the lord here [Music] not long ago it was a song that would be sung take me to the king [Music] lord jesus the angel the lord came in a very special way that night lord has been sung this morning the king is here i ask your father that you'd touch our hearts our hands are lifted even we ourselves need a touch from you god you right you're a god that understands you understand being sick you understand going through things you understand the journeys of life but if we give up what have we done lord you give us things to overcome and i pray that you'd strengthen even my body to speak to this audience today annoying us father may the angel of a god lord take us under the wings and touch us today each and every individual as they raise their hands we pray that you would touch them in a mighty way now father we know this to be you without you we can do nothing so we take no credit of our own we give ourselves to you today in jesus name we pray amen and amen amen amen amen if you'll turn with me in your bible this morning to luke chapter 12 and verse 27 last night was a masterpiece i had i had some ministry call me and tell me after the service of what a masterpiece that was and uh and it was a masterpiece amen amen i want you to remember brother mike walls as they're going through some situations there with the sister that has that had a uh when she was i think she was having her baby she had a heart attack and then had a stroke and then she had been telling them her head had been hurting for months and they found out that she had a a pretty massive tumor there that they're dealing with and last night things turned really bad so so if you could remember brother mike the family the people god's able to do anything and so we just want to remember them in prayer today luke chapter 12 and verse 27 jesus is speaking here consider the lilies how they grow they told not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these jesus is saying my creation is greater than any man's work that's pretty powerful in there if then god so clothed the grass which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the ox oven how much more will he clothe you o ye of little faith and seek not you what ye shall eat or what you shall drink neither be you doubtful of mine for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things think about that the economies of the world are seeking after something much different than you are but your god knows how to feed you but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and then he then is this is how the early church started sell what you have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that failth not where no thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth for where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen wow what a powerful scripture you can be seated isaiah writes it like this much on the same thing ho everyone that thirst come you to the waters and he that hath no money come he buy and eat yea come by wine milk without money without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat you that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david behold i have given him a for a witness to the people of the leader of a commander of the people behold thou shalt call a nation and know us not and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and the holy one of israel he hath glorified thee seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the righteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon i love these next scriptures for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts [Music] than your thoughts oh what a powerful for as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven and return turneth not hither but water the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it might give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereunto i sent i want to read that last portion of scripture but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing which whereunto i sent [Music] i'd like to speak to you i've been speaking to you on the orchestra and and sharing with you some things from beethoven from from how that god orchestrates his word places people at a certain place at a certain season at a certain time to play a certain instrument and we value our moments in time and we catch our moment and i'd like to speak to you on the value of this masterpiece so i i felt led to go and look at what the world considers the most priceless things of value that there are on the earth three of the top 15 are in the the the pyramids that was on the scene when enoch was there what he not built michelangelo built two statues that have great value to them one of them is david it is considered the greatest most valuable sculpture that there is in the world and they actually built one of the most biggest buildings around it to protect it but it's called the most perfect statue of david that there was the other one we know much about is moses to which when he finished up with that it was so alive to him that he struck it and said for it to speak michelangelo would be one that would paint and he would paint many different paintings and one of them would be under house arrest would paint the sistine chapel others would be the the taj mahal and that's actually rated as number one the taj mahal it is a it's a crown palace on the earth it's an indian city to which it's the most celebrated romantic symbols of power huma of human emotion ever built it is beyond price of value that it could be the great wall of china it is a wall that it is a wall that not america would build i've actually saw this wall but it's a wall to which that that china would build and and it would build and run through its country to which that it would no way that you could value this structure the pyramids that would be there the jewels that would be there the heads that would be there all of this is man-made all of this is man-made you couldn't buy it no government could buy it no government can own it all of it it pales in comparison of our creator that speaks a son into existence a zodiac into existence down to a little lily on a gr on a ground in a pond from a deep seed inside of a pond underneath of the mud it begins to maybe put forth a stem 40 foot long but at the top of it it shows forth a tabernacle of praise unto god and god compares that greater than all of solomon's temple and if we can think about solomon's temple for just a moment artisans and skilled workers came from all over the world and brought some of the most priceless pieces of wood and of rock and of emerald and stone to be able to place inside of solomon's temple it was a time to where that goal was in abundance and it would be placed in this temple but jesus would stand the master of all masters would stand and say destroy this temple and he was not talking about solomon's temple but he was talking about his own body and in three days i'll raise it up again there's no way that we could put value on the blood of the lamb there's no way that we could put value on jesus christ our society wants to dirty his name wants to blaspheme his name wants to make fun of his name but let me just say this to you without jesus christ we're all lost if god hadn't come to earth and now listen even in the book of revelations in chapter 5 there is john standing sure as many symbols formed but john's standing and he sees that humanity's lost the book is in the hands of the father and we're all lost there's no man in heaven as great as have they all lived and there's no man in the earth that is worthy to take the book and john began to weak because we're all lost but there was a voice he stepped forth to take the book to redeem me and you he was greater than a prophet he was greater than a king he was greater than all humanity he is the king of kings he is the lord of lords he is the mighty god living in human flesh [Applause] [Music] if you would ask me today who would you want in your house to come to your house as the greatest greatest guest of all time i don't have to ponder for three seconds i don't have to ponder for three seconds and wonder hollywood or kings or potentiates or great basketball stars or football stars my answer is immediately jesus [Music] but i want to tell you it's more than a dream and it's more than a vision it's more than a thought it's more than a poem it's more than a song he's already there if you're a believer and the holy ghost is in your life the master of all masters that priceless one is in your life brother brown said oh the hour has come and and when god's great drama is set here before us the son of god that was in a cradle is in the heart now he is the deity of god he is god the creator all things he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not today that's what's the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the holy ghost has come into people's heart and they don't even recognize what it is [Music] they think it's a little church joiner or something like that but it's the god the creator of heaven living in you and giving you all the powers you're in the possession of anything that he had and so it is in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil to flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation oh malice hatred strife envy and so forth turn away from it for that'll take from that'll take him from your heart if you receive him embrace him love him hold him in your heart love him singing some powerful things to you and i can tell you the church together and that kind of a power has the power to bind heavens and heal sick open the eyes of the blood if that god lives in your heart it has the power to heal the sick to raise the dead to open the eyes of the blind the deaf ears and the dumb speak the cripples walk the blind to see it's recognizing the power of almighty god in your heart now every masterpiece has a signature that goes with it if it doesn't have a signature it can't be authenticated i know something about some of these things if it doesn't have a signature or maybe even a number on it it's just a a duplicate or a bonus a bogus copy or an imitation of the original that has no no value whatsoever why would why do we value going to church why don't we value going to church and signing your name on a book living the same life on monday the same life that we used to live the same life when you were a drunkard and you're still drinking and you're still whining and you're still chasing well are you with me now listen if there's not a change in your heart it has no value to it why would we accept a cheap invitation when the real is available now god's signature on a masterpiece of your life cannot be duplicated you're a one of a kind and then you're approved by his signature god has already signed the canvas of your life and declared you as a masterpiece he sees the finished work already in the light of jesus as he has done for you on the cross the signature is the paid price when you receive the holy ghost it is god's seal on you and there's nothing in the hell can take that seal away from you brother branham teaches us that the seal is god's sign of ownership the largest acreage owner in america is bill gates and his agenda right now is to take and not produce food there's a reason for it he is trying to bring down the population of the world he's one of those believers well that don't bother me none whatsoever you can own the all the land in america my god owns the whole earth and my god can do more in an acre than you can do in a 100 acre field [Applause] [Music] are you with me you that have we don't talk of money too much here but you that paid your tithes look back look back we just sat at sister june's the other day yesterday sister june's house burned down and she's been faithful to pay her tithes she don't get the benefit of being in church she don't hear these sermons but she's been faithful to pay her ties and let me just say yes to you god has blessed her home she's got a wonderful house there that old house was run down and it was dingy and it was dark and got god gave her a masterpiece of the house let me just say this message works [Applause] artists sign up the copy of their their work they assign it to which that it will become worth more sister anna when our storm began begin to look for a something that i had been looking for for for actually several years jesus walking through the storm i had not shared that there are they're kind of inexpensive pieces and i had not shared that i wanted such a thing but not told anybody but i did some looking and so and so anyway sister anna just came on her heart well you know to call this certain place of jesus walking on the storm it's actually by abraham hunter and she called the place i'm gonna tell it the best that my memory says so if it's just a little gibberish if you'll just give me a little leeway she called and of course they didn't have any they tried to find it they didn't have any they tried to find it finally she got a hold of a guy that worked in a warehouse and and they had two and and one day at christmas there the christmas season i just been given given the news that i had been given and here she walks up i hadn't been given the news yet and here her and brother jeff walk up to the house knock on the door and they said we've got a gift for you you don't know what it meant for me to get that print of jesus walking on the water they didn't know but i knew are you with me now something that is signed is of great value we didn't know what we was getting ready to go through i want to just take a few moments here but god puts trust in his seat if his seed is a signature edition and it's playing an integral part in god's orchestra and in that orchestra there's going to be a lot of storms in the life storms to which that particular voice has to have a certain sound god knows that he's got to send it through certain devastations to make it sound a certain way but remember the seed is an incorruptible seed it cannot even be destroyed by an atomic bomb are you with me it it's going to take a stronger wind than cancer it's going to take a stronger wind than relationship issues it's going to take a stronger wind than the parties of the united states of america or the struggles of your life the seed that god put on the inside of you before the foundation of the world it was a wedding band of unmerited grace that he slipped on your finger before the foundation of the world he would not leave it up to frail humanity it's not about whether you feel it or don't feel it it's not about whether you think i'm going to make it or don't think i'm going to make it he's got a covenant he's got a covenant and he didn't swear by man he swerved by himself the eternal one swore by the eternal one without beginning or without ending alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last [Applause] it's not even up to your frail humanity it's up to god [Applause] i'll make a powerful statement here because our prophet did he said you're the literal spoken word seed of god what's your name melissa melissa sister alyssa went to ohio this week how many chur how many years have you said in church how old are you 22. 22. you believed this you never doubted it but you hadn't met him that correct but you went through a prayer line in ohio and after that it wasn't andrew and it wasn't the other ministry but there was a presence in that prayer line and it was him now i want to tell you something that him will never leave you you can't put a value on being in that meeting you can't put a value on that oh i was just in a meeting no no no that's generational that's something her father and her mother could not do for her keep you in the right atmosphere but when you meet him you meet the one that wrote the book i don't mean it to be just so simple but he wrote the book he wrote the book and when you meet the guy that writes the book the voice behind the voice with moses that wrote the book what do i write about adam i'll tell you just write just put it on your name on just just just keep writing i'm going to tell you how to write about moses i'm going to tell you how to write about all of these characters i'm going to tell you about abraham i'm the one that sat with abraham [Applause] are you with me this is my masterpiece this is god's book this is his orchestra there's been a lot of players but now you realize you're in the book how valuable brother doug was the service you set in when your life just went and it was premature and we came to your place where you were setting and you set lifeless and we just called you by name in the name of the lord jesus christ and you came back augusta county and rockingham all of the banking accounts combined couldn't put a value on you being in that service i will tell you this if you that's been around brother doug brother doug was one man before that service but when he came back he was a complete different man he was a good man but when god breathes life i'll tell you what it feels like ten thousand volts are right here when god breathes life it looked like a shanty on a river but god sent our prophet down to a little house probably couldn't afford the light meal but god sent a prophet because she prayed where's my elijah at i'd be like that pseudomike woman where's my elijah and he walked past her he said good morning amy and he's she said good morning parsley and he noticed the dew on her back she'd been there for a while brother branham says these words and this is where this fits brother brandon said i walked into her little house and i looked at the pictures of jesus on the wall and he said the presence in that house he said i've been in four castles those that want to contest brother branham about being and praying for king george brother brown was in four different castles and he said i felt more comfortable in her little house than on all them big castles hallelujah hallelujah and brother branham didn't say i am a i'm an evangelist do you know me no he said annie won't you pray her prayer created a storm and grounded a plane and he recognized that presence because he had been in it up on a mountainside [Applause] overcoming a complex in his own life and he spoke a storm out of existence and he knew that god spoke that storm through his lips and this woman used the same power that he spoke i want to tell you this this power that you heard about last night is in your lips it's in your heart it's in your life [Applause] you prayed you got under desperation that your son would be here on that certain day and when i called his name you didn't even know he was in the building but you prayed because the author of this bible the orchestrator of this bible understands redemption [Applause] and understands prodigal children and understands a covenant of seeds and so when he went to the jailhouse the other day we're not ashamed of that god knows how to go get his kids [Applause] when he went to the jailhouse the other day commissioned by the word of the lord to go deal with his heart do you understand eternal life at all if you gain this whole world and lose your soul jobs homes i'm riding the fence why are you rotting a fence you'll stay on that fence on rapture morning you may have to give your life to a tribulation period what what's here what's here worth staying for tell me a meal in harrisonburg we're staying here for tell me a house a house in this whole valley i don't care the biggest house even in charlottesville that's supposed to be the mecca of big houses you tell me the biggest house there that's not worth staying here for thank you brother brother branham explained something and he said what is value what is value he was an honest man and he looked at he looked at things kind of like well jesus would look at things because brother branham had been offered millions of dollars to preach in other circles and turn that down he knew what it was to be poor he knew what it was to take up an offer and there would just be a couple of pieces of change in the bottom of it and he wanted to go give it back he knew what that was like he knew what that little building at 8th and penn street here the greatest ministry of this day i'm not ashamed to say that what's in a small building smaller than this building we're concerned about our we're concerned about sometimes about the size of a crowd that will be here next week brother branham had those kind of crowds because it was brown of meetings people traveled 20 hours 36 hours to the meeting brother branham's in town and they started traveling wednesday to be there friday and brother branham was going to be speaking and and hey listen they got there in the morning knowing it was going to be a night service they stood outside they had sandwiches they stood outside and eat hey listen listen brother tim sent me a a picture a picture of him sitting on the platform and he's about 18 years old he's a young preacher he'd been in another meeting where preachers sat on the platform on this meeting they had seats up there he just walked up there thought that was a place for him to see not another preacher on the platform but him there was no seats out in the audience so my dad got doc to get us a seat in the baptistry so behind the curtain there i said about 11 year old boy and my buddy was sitting out on the pulpit as an 18 year old preacher who to thunk it i'm not ashamed to say it probably two of the most powerful preachers in the building we're sitting just feet apart are you with me now god knows how to arrange things well that was a bold statement brother ron you must think of yourself that's not what i think of myself it's what god thinks and i got a quote for you you're a special class of people it's not white black yellow whatever we're a special class of people we got an ear to hear we got a trained ear to hear the voice of god maybe i'm finished here seemed to be a bit wary this morning i went longer than i thought i would i've been real sick this morning took a took a pretty good fall but it didn't hit my head it was a woman that to most people had no value well you said something last night i thought was so profound from timothy we were re-quoting it how the devil tries to make our sisters think they're ugly tries to make you feel like you're ugly he wants to paint you and he wants to put all kind of stuff on you he wants to put all kind of deals on you when you're beautiful in god's sight who are we patterning after in any way you know who are we trying to impress if you can impress your husband and press your husband you're a man's should have been way way way better than that well brother ron i got humps and i got bumps and if he married you for that he had the wrong reason to start off with you marry a woman for her character that will reflect the character that's inside of you that's what god's looking for and there was a woman that was probably to the world extremely cheap but men would go to her because of their lustful desires and they would pour out upon her their lustful desires and she would receive their seed and then they would just throw money down to her and she was in chains of circumstances she couldn't raise herself from that level and there was no hope of ever raising herself and she was thinking as a if age progresses this is the way i'm always going to be this one would leave good money this one would leave a little bit of money that this one would be a nice looking man that one would be nasty sin has a horrible way of destroying people's lives sin has no value to it i'm going two ways here it has no value but destroys and kills and steals and destroys your brain cells and destroys your body you've heard of children young 16 18 year old girls being murdered because they went to a party and and they didn't come home i i say worse to parents where's the parents that says no no don't do that don't do there's going to be somebody there [Music] she hears about jesus is out of place and the footworks flunkies don't even want to fool with him i'd like to been a flunky i'll be really honest with you i'd have been watching for if i knew that he was coming i'd have been watching for him coming over the hill he wouldn't have got by me but it had to be this way because god couldn't have me there he had me here knowing that's in my heart because every time this service if this service is this important and that service is that important and next week is that important how can we put value on it don't never let a service go by and go well that was a good service we went a little bit too long you can't put value on this service you cannot put a value in this service god is telling you how valuable you are [Applause] sarah he's telling you in this service how valuable worth more than the taj mahal faith if me and you were standing at the taj mahal this morning this morning and we were standing there you'd probably say something quirky but i'd look over at you and i'd say faith can you imagine in god's eyes you're worth more than all this right here would be so humbling you'd feel like dancing you feel like shouting that's how this little lady felt at the feet of jesus when he said thy sins though that many are forgiven and she entered into the book one day i'll shake her hand one day i'll shake her hand i don't know we don't really have a good name for her but she's the woman that washed jesus's feet and she got eternal life i don't know where i'll stand there what i'll be known for somewhere i'll be connected to a thing called cancer and it didn't defeat me i preached when it made me sick i preached when my body said no i preached when others thought i wasn't going to make it but i keep standing i just want to make it i just want to play my part i'm sorry i'm sorry let's stand good preachers will come thursday and friday or friday and saturday andrew won't you just take it [Music] i'd rather [Music] i'd rather [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus oh than he needs thee oh this old [Music] rather have jesus oh than me ends up i had rather be faithful to his dear calls i had rather have jesus and [Music] i'd then be true to his whole name oh that to be oh the king of ass no

blessed beyond measure and only by his strength i've overcome [Music] oh i could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands but those trophies would not equal to the grace on which i say in christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in [Laughter] my source of strength my source of hope is christ alone in christ alone will i glory though only by his grace i am redeemed and only his tender mercies can reach beyond my weakness to my knees [Music] oh now i seek no greater honor than just to know him more and to count my gains but losses for the glory oh my lord in christ i place my trust and find my glory the power of the crawl [Music] [Laughter] [Music] a source of strength [Music] hallelujah aren't you thankful that the lord deems you his signature addition [Music] if he's lord of your life he's ownership of everything you're looking the most beautiful sunsets and the sun rises you don't have you don't see a signature in the corner of it because he owns it you hear the birds singing in the morning god doesn't have to copyright that he owns it but he so loved you that he puts his seal upon your life say this is my ownership i own these i asked them to work and they work i ask them to sing and they sing i ask them to praise and they praise i love them and they love me when they're sick i heal them when they're broken amen them [Music] when they're lost i save them and when they're bound i deliver them yes they're mine don't you love the lord this morning [Applause] and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own

atmosphere around you pray as the musicians begin to play you begin to enter into worship as the service begins to close it's a time to be reverent it's a time to to walk out while others are still here worshiping at the altar it's a time to be reverend not a time to be speaking and talking and about the things of the life it's it's a time to to recognize this is his house and this is where he's doing work the musicians know what to do when that's happening they they play softly and you just you just exit the building if you want to fellowship that's where you do that out there and we we
