morning came it shocked them all cause my god fights for me oh yes it does i stumbled into the room with alabaster and my wounds i could feel their judging eyes as i knelt before the christ i poured my oil upon his feet i didn't care who saw me weep i gave him all i had that day and he should have sent me on my way but instead he lifted up my head cause my god fight for me he's my shield he's my sword the victory [Music] he's my sword [Music] are you trapped and can't get out or are you staring down a lion's mouth can you stand before the lord or do you need to hit the floor it don't matter

fights for you amen he's good to us sydney amen i want to share something with you if it's okay i don't know if you can see this or not but i'm going to read it to you brother clarence gave me this t-shirt last night and it was very appropriate for today's sermon the devil whispered in my ear you're not strong enough to withstand the storm today i whispered in the devil's ear i am the star i i'm always marvel at gifts when they come in the season of they come and you know what you've been studying for weeks and here you are and so by that shirt you know the devil's in for a really bad day he's in for a really bad day amen good to be in the house of the lord in it amen and so we love him with all of our hearts and it's just so good to be here you know i i've had a very difficult week and i had a literally a dream week the week before but i've had a very difficult week this week and had a very difficult evening last evening and so if i get a little personal on whipping the devil this morning you'll understand it's with good measure and so amen so good to be here um we love you with all of our hearts last night we just i just thought it was just a phenomenal sermon an absolute phenomenal sermon and so we we just trust that god blessed you in so many ways this morning i we want to remember sister laura's family and they've they've had to make some very difficult decisions today and uh and so we just we just pray for them that that god would give them the strength because those those decisions are very they're very difficult and and so uh we know that jesus stands without stretched arms to help us and and we just pray for them today i just spoke with them just just only seconds ago and so we would remember them in prayer that god would be with them and the family and the wife and sister laura and we just asked god to be with them and we have somewhat uh uh an in common with them uh of a battle that that has raged and uh uh i just seem like it's been a quite an attachment with with with chase and so we would pray that god would just touch them many other needs that would be be be there uh we just pray that god would just help them in a special way and help you in a special way this morning help me that god would just strengthen my body to be able to speak the word of life to you amen maybe you would have a need this morning you'd like to raise it before the lord before we would even go into the word and we we know that god hears and answers our prayers and and so we we just we just we just pray that god would just speak to us this morning lord jesus lord we step to this sacred desk once again lord i ask you that you would come and anoint our hearts we had a very special visitation during the night and you came and lord i just ask you now that you would come again in this service you promised that you would we just heard the song say my god fights for me that ought to be a statement that resounds in the heart of every believer around the world regardless of what language that it would be in when that becomes a real touch in our lives we realize that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world and i asked you now that you would just come and touch our hearts whether we're the speaker or the hearer lord whether we're in the hospital or in an icu unit or wherever we're at nursing facility god you're our god and you've never lost a case and we stand upon the absolute of your word this morning and we we can see the enemy's breath trying to take our lives and we can see his teeth we can see the fierceness in his eyes but he's a loser hallelujah because if god is on our side there's nothing can harm us and i asked you this morning that you would touch the llewellyn family i pray that you would bring them strength like only you can come lord may you be a a warm breeze in that room this morning to touch their lives and father we ask you that you'd help us as we've raised our hands across this building dear god we just ask you you're a god that you can touch every need in the sweep of a moment you can touch every need now satan i want to remind you our prophet would walk into a place in finland and as he would walk through the door as he would walk up and there were 12 rows of crutches and wheelchairs cots 12 rows and before he ever took the pulpit every person was healed that's the kind of god that we serve and lord jesus you're here in this building hallelujah you're here in this building and you've taken our case [Music] you've taken our case father you've expressed that you've got time to do it and father now now as i stand here on the anniversary of discovering cancer not just cancer in my body but fourth stage cancer in some vital organs of my body in my brain and in my lungs and attacking my kidneys and other places satan you're a loser hallelujah and i want to remind you as i stand here and preach the word of god they said i would only live a few months but i'm stronger now than i was a year ago and it's only by the grace of jesus christ i ask you to anoint this audience anoint the hearers that are on the internet now may you touch their lives in the name of jesus christ we pray a man and a man and a man and amen amen won't you turn to your neighbor and say this is going to be a good one hallelujah amen revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 sorry to keep you standing we certainly love you with all of our hearts and amen we so appreciate you amen i'm glad this cobid's over we can we can shake your hands and hug your necks and for the brothers at least there you know so amen amen revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 there's going to be a land beyond the river we'll hug the sisters next too so amen now i want you to make this personal this morning because this is the age that you live in to him that overcometh so i would like for you to put your name to ron spencer that overcometh let's do that again put your name there to ron spencer that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne we've already got a place you can be seated if i could speak in this season this of the sermon this morning as brother andrew said there's a a context or a thought or an inspiration or a spark of life in every sermon that you hear sermons are inspired by maybe just a few words and then they begin to they begin to kind of just grow like a great snowball if we could put it like that and as it grows and it rolls it just gets it just gets more depth and it gets more power and it gets more inspiration as it grows and so for me this morning this sermon has great meaning like like never before i would like to speak to you on the mind of a champion the mind of a champion so if i could say it like this if i could put it in a carnal context to you just for a moment it feels like in this season of my life it feels like like two forces or two boxers have stood in the ring laid it all on the line every every trick every avenue everything has been laid on the line and now the answering of the bell is the 15th round now it's no more play it's it's everything it's everything it's eye to eye toe to toe we've answered the bell i'd like to report to our enemies camp we've answered the bell we've taken angles after angles after disturbance after disturbance and god's answered the bell in every situation if he brother brahma used a term he said if he can't get it's this way he'll come around this way and then he'll come around this way and he'll try an angle this way well god's been faithful in every avenue i'd like to just just forgive me for being this personal this morning but i'd like to just talk to the devil if we can satan i want to remind you we're enemies [Music] i want to remind you personally we are enemies there's no love lost here we are enemies i will see your destruction i will be there when you're cast into outer darkness are you with me for me there is no turning around and going back i'm not here to whine i'm not here to have pity i'm here to win and at the end of the round i will be champion i'd like to say this for our ending of laodicea as we're seeing it if you were before the service you heard brother branham and in several quotations and then you saw the picture we are seeing the fulfillment of visions we are the ending seasons of laodicea it's supposed to be this way don't get yourself all tore up with conspiracy theories and all kind of different things that's going on in the world it's supposed to be this way but we are supposed to be this way the world is in its final seasons and so are we they could not be doing what they're doing without you or where you're at for the season of the rapture are you with me now so let's remind him this day god has had champions in every age so let's remind him of a little bit of his history if we could for a few moments in hebrews chapter 11. paul is writing this scripture not from a plush office but from a dungeon he knows that he's in will be the chopping of his head off but did he ask for pity did he ask for people to be sorry for him as a matter of fact he doesn't even write in this text of where he's even at by faith the walls of jericho fell after they were compassed with seven about seven days by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that belief not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall we more i more say for the time would fail me of to tell a gideon and a bear ark and of samson and of jeff and i and of david and of samuel and of the prophets you can imagine as he's sitting there putting his pen to whatever parchment of letter that he was writing this to every one of these individuals shook the realms of hell these are more than just names these are literally characters that stepped out of the mind of god into human flesh and overcame in their day are you with me and paul is calling their names and no doubt as he's writing them down the devils that are fighting paul so much as he's writing these names down had to shudder god was with them in that day are you with me let me just say this right here satan in the realm that he is able to operate in so afflicted these individuals from from gideon all the way through to hear the realms of of even rahab and her story and and the story of redemption and then at the end of it when it comes the last breath of life and all the torment they've had to live through those demons have to watch the angelic pallbearers come and take their spirit from this dimension to that dimension oh hallelujah now watch this who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword outer weaknesses were made strong likes valued in fight turned to flight the armies of the alien women received their dead and raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection there's a book of martyrs that has 68 million christians in it that the catholic church destroyed none of them said i'm going to turn around and run back all of them stood in the face of opposition and god received them you're talking about a book of faith are you with me in our family we've got courage and confidence and i'm not talking about the spencer family i'm talking about the family of god so we stand on the edge of this realm of of the ending of gentile age to the to the brand new day and we stand here with courage in our eyes hallelujah they were stoned they were sewn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wondered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute and afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wondered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god providing some better thing for us that they without us are you with me the completion of redemption cannot be done until we finish hallelujah they without us should not be made perfect chapter 12 and verse 1. wherefore see and we're compassed about with so greater cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god to god be the glory for all the things that he has done philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross philippians chapter 3 and verse 12 if all of those other scriptures hasn't made the devil nervous let's just continue to torture him paul says not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after that if i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of of christ jesus brethren i count not myself too apprehended but this one thing that i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth to the things which are before i press towards the mark of the hype of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus isaiah chapter 54 god is igniting his servant to speak right directly to the enemy behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy now notice the next verse because god's not done with this thought no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper i want you to say that with me no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper in the 15th round of a battle all the training that you have been through all of the scars that you have now carried has got you ready for this final round many of you have been decades serving the lord but if you could only realize how close we are to the coming of the lord are you with me now you've never had it i hadn't a circumstances like that has happened in just the last year or so the world has been besieged and shut in and economies not just of america but economies of the world have suffered because of covet and the many things that have happened and sometimes we would ask is is everything out of cater or is everything kind of off base and what is happening who is in control let me just say this to you god's in control of everything and he uses the enemy as a tool as a tool let me say even in the tribulation period much worse will come upon the earth because of satan's tools that are in his arsenal but up to this point there's a bride on the earth that stands like the moon over top of the ocean that's far enough and that wave cannot come one inch further then what it is because god's got it in control sometimes you just need to turn and tell the devil that's enough i find it interesting there's several sermons that that we draw this con this context from one being the greatest battle ever fought the other other one that that comes is the contest which is a short brief sermon just before the changing of the new year from 62 to 63. brother braham said the dying out of 62 and everything that's happened is 62. we could say the dying out of 2020 and how horrendous that it was for many of us as we went through some very difficult situations but i have found that god masters difficult situations [Applause] i have found that there's nothing impossible with god i have found that circumstances really don't matter are you with me i have also found that god put something in our heart no matter how hot the battle goes there's something inside of us that's driven that presses us when you feel like giving up and you feel like all of your energies and your reserves have come to an end it seems like god just comes with a resource and beyond your mortality presses you forward as i've said it before winston churchill stood and they they the the previous man that stood before him talked about how great winston churchill was as an orator what a great speaker that he was and he went on for quite a bit talk introducing winston churchill and he stepped up and there was a war that was preemptive and was ready to take place and it looked like the world was going to fall to this enemy and he walks to the podium and here's a man named winston churchill who fought a lot of complexes and a lot of demons and a lot of things in his own life but he said some phenomenal words in this instance never give up and he paused and paused about 60 seconds and he said never give up and he paused another 60 seconds and he spoke again never and this time with an extreme scream never give up and he turned around and sat down thousands of people didn't realize he had just gave them the greatest speech that he could have given if i could look across the vast bride of jesus christ and if i could remind us of no matter what your condition is or no matter what discouraged that you might go through i'd like to speak to you never give up [Applause] now i want to pause to remind you i was preaching this 20 years ago i was preaching this 20 years ago been burned had strokes have heart conditions i've now had been burned and laid in a coma for a month a lot of difficulties over the last year but i stand with the same resolve and even greater and i say to you never [Music] give up [Applause] i'd like to pull from a young man as a boy this young man was burned in a fire the fire burned his legs the doctor said let's take his legs off because they were burned so bad the young boy named glenn said please don't take my legs please don't take my legs for the next months they would do their best to take care of him but they had no answers glenn would now sit in a wheelchair with those scarred burned legs that now had forgotten how to walk but glenn had the mind of a champion it's something that schools can't teach it's something that coaches encourage speeches are given and trying to bring something out of people that sometimes they really don't have people look for champions and they think they're champions but sometimes champions are within and it can't be seen the size of a man's heart the drive inside of a man cannot be seen that's only what god deposits on the inside of you that's the bride of jesus christ we're built to be overcomers we're built to be the champions of this age when the devil would wane against you in war against you to give up god put something on the inside of you that only he could put there glenn would wheel himself out to the to the gate to the picket fence of his house that went around his house he would watch all the children playing up and down the streets and he wanted to be with them and one day courage mustered on the inside of him and he grabbed a hole to the fence and he pulled himself up to that fence and he stood there and he stood there as long as his little feeble legs would let him stand so day after day he would go out and grab a hold of the fence and pull himself up one day he took a step and he took another step and day after day he grabbed a halt of the fence and took another step in his life let me just say this you sometimes you feel like you're still sitting in a wheelchair or you're in a in the bottom of the barrel of your life grab a hold of the fence grab a hold of the bars that are in front of you are you with me pull up there's not a hundred people around me supporting sometimes you gotta overcome by yourself you're the man in the arena you're the guy that's got a box you're the man that's got to take the licks you're the man that's got to give the fight don't let the enemy take the fight to you you take the fight to him come on church we're not sent here to be tormented by the devil we're sent here to torment him brother ron that's not scriptural let me give you some scripture as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you think you're defeated all the time that's the way you are if you think you're backslidden all the time that's the way you are if you think nobody loves you and you believe it that's the way you are but as a man thinketh in his heart so is he the scripture also said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world the scripture always also said who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify [Music] the scripture says i can do all things glenn cunningham went to the olympics as a mile runner he shattered every world record of that day he was the first one to get close to the four-minute mile for the person that was watching him for the first time no way could they understand what he went through to get where he was there's a lot of people look at you and want to be where you're at but they're not willing to go through what you went through to be where you're at come on i'm going to put the art dart in the enemy a lot of people want to criticize me for what i am but you ought to have walked in some of the footsteps sure there's going to be a palace of resistance come against you sure you're going to have difficulty but it's supposed to be that way the way there's going to be shattered dreams that you're going to have to go through when you hear brother branham talk about his life story i don't know if you've ever listened to it over and over again but no matter how many times that i listen to it i weep and i cry i think about all the darts that came against brother branham in his day but he stood like a gentleman at under 150 pounds he stood like a gentleman it was a short man but as a short man he stood there amongst giants of that day a lot amongst a lot of degrees of that day but let me just say god developed him to be the messenger of this day to carry word of the scriptures that no man had ever been entrusted to carry let me preface that spurgeon told all of the thousands of preachers that came through his school don't touch those seven seals there will come a prophet are you with me and if a man hundreds of years ago would remind his preachers of that day don't touch it god sent us a prophet in this day and i'm not apologetic for it he sent us a messenger in this day to give us the reveal word of this day because we would need it [Applause] to overcome this lukewarm laodicea sodom and gomorrah that we're living in but we have been given the weapons of our warfare god didn't hold nothing back for me and you hallelujah you say well brother ron i'm not i'm not even i'm i'm so weak i can't hardly stand on my feet brother braham said the weakest of christians when they go on their knees they shake the kingdom of hell i don't know too many of brother branham's prayers but they're very powerful and lay hands on people dear jesus touch touch this individual touch this patient may they be healed and go home in the name of jesus christ and they go dear jesus touch them heal them in the name of jesus christ may they be healed in jesus christ's name i'm doing this for an example and then another but he didn't call my name he don't have to he didn't call my address he didn't have to because of who he was and the authority that he was standing under every demon recognized who he was what he was standing under and that demon knew that i have to leave because i've been commanded to leave in the name of jesus christ now let me just say this to you you're a believer you're a believer and you have authority greater authority than the archangels that are in heaven and your prayers are going right straight to our lord jesus christ our great high priest that great intercessor and that demon in that realm recognizes i've gotta go so what does that make you unmovable unstoppable undefeated i've read some forgive me i'm i hope can you just hand me a tissue i've muhammad ali it's not for debate now but was recognized as one of the greatest fighters that ever fought in his corner he had a trainer and that trainer was called angelo dundee and he would he would talk to him between rounds and remind him of the things that they have trained to do he never told muhammad ali you're going to get whipped tonight he never told him that the enemy that's facing you you're not a match for him one of the most famous words that he would tell him is remember who you are you want another one duke sorry to get on some of you duke fans but duke was in their historical historically they were getting beat by a greater score than it ever been and it looked horrendous and finally the coach called them over mike called them into the into the circle in a time out and they would ask them later what did he say he said they want to tell you something remember who you are now i may be speaking to somebody in a hospital or somebody that's having great issues this morning or somebody that's going through great difficulty and i want to go into the place to where god and satan said we're going to meet there the battleground of your mind that's where we're going to meet so i'm going to stand in your corner for a few minutes i want you to remember who you are the enemy that looks so incredible and the odds are so great now let me just remind you it isn't you that brags on how big your enemy is the enemy will make sure that you know how big he is no matter how cubits he is tie no matter how big his head is no matter how big the sword is or the spear is that he's got the enemy will make sure you know how big he is but all it takes is a rock about that size placed in the right hands that enemy will have breathed his last breath so satan you be careful who you send to fight us i would say this you have probably sent your best to fight me but you ain't got enough so just in case he would forget it brother allen had a knife made by case themselves and engraved on it he don't have enough i am his storm what are we afraid about possess the gates we have god's promise we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels are encamped about everything's in order every wall can be took down it's already took down the son of god goes before us his banners are waving there's nothing that can stand in the way of a saint going to meet the promise of god death can't stop it the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you death is conquered for you unbelief won't rest won't you receive him habits has been conquered for you temptation's been conquered you say i've got a temper and i can't get over it it's already been conquered he's already conquered it i don't care what your weakness is it's already been conquered well brother ron what's whispering in my ear do i listen to it he's lying anyway fake news well the devil's full of fake news by his grace through his promise just believe and hold on that's all we do it's already finished our sickness our transgressions he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed i was in a doctor's office this week waiting for the doctor to come in and he sees hundreds of patients a day and he's actually been here past the church we've become a kind of a friend i'm not going to call his name but where's a bow tie he calls me the ref and he was talking to two of his doctors that are under him these training residents and i could hear through the door hopefully you don't hear this but i could hear through the door him say now when you go in this man looks like a picture of health i thought that was a nice compliment and he said but he's the sickest man that will have visit this this clinic so you be careful look you look deeply so they came in and they was with me about 10 minutes and they they said put your sheet back on and i did and i thanked them for their service they walked out and i could hear them say you're right there's nothing wrong with him he said i told you i told you i told you what you'd see i braced you for it come with me he came in we talked for a few minutes and you know how friends do you talk for a few minutes talk for a few minutes and he said i've got to check you now and he found some places on my back about the size of my hands and he said medicine's calls in that and he said i'll get you i'll get you a saf to take care of that he said he said it itches nothing and i said drives me crazy he said did you tell these boys i said no and tell them he said you knew i'd find it i said yeah i knew you'd find it you know so we talked he said how's the church he said drove by the church the other day you got everything looking really good he just he said i'll send the prescription back in i'll send it over to get it taken care of he walked through the door he shut the door and i could hear him now again he said now one day you'll have a patient like that and he said i told y'all before you walked in he was a picture of health he's seeing what god sees he's a picture of health but he's the sickest man in this clinic that's what the devil sees and he said one day you'll have patience like that and you'll miss something that they really need help with and he and then he made this statement he said it's his god that's keeping him like that [Applause] lauren [Applause] flores oh hallelujah now listen psalms 91 is your prescription you've got angels sister linda angels because god has taken your case you probably couldn't put a hundred pounds over your head if your life depended on you but you've got angels that stand near you because you are who you are somebody ought to have enough faith in this building to go i'm beginning to grasp a hold of who i am so let me just take care of a couple things right here so lay aside your petty things lay aside your pity party lay aside your excuses lay aside your just plain laziness [Applause] oh brother ronnie but if i had your position boy i'd do a lot of things just do what you got to do in your position where god called you don't try to take somebody else's job that you're not called to do to start off with overcome in your position stand toe to toe fight to fight [Applause] brother ron you're holding me back i got news for you i can't hold you back it ain't my job to hold you back but i'm going to give it everything that i can to serve god with all my heart i've laid aside excuses i've laid aside laziness i've laid aside all different kinds of things in my life i've fought through dark shadows i've thought through storms [Applause] i refuse for my epitaph to read all that i've been through i'm standing because of who god called me to be ephesians chapter 6 is another prescription that you take on the whole armor of god and there's nothing for your back it's all for your front so let me just say this to you charge charge charge brother ron the devil is trying to take my life tell him to go home tell him to go home come on well brother ron i'm just afraid i'm going to die any day you got the whole picture wrong you got the whole picture wrong let me just say this you he can't take your life until god gives him permission and your purpose on this earth is done before god gives permission for him to take your life but if you've still got something to do the devil can send his whole envoy north korea thinks they got an army the demons of hell can send all their envoy and god is greater on the inside of a little hundred pound woman than all the demons that are in hell oh dear jesus know you not that they which run in a race run off but one receiveth the prize so run that she may obtain don't run like somebody else run with what god gave you to do i want to be like this guy and i want to be like this woman and i want to be like that just be yourself look down at your fingerprints god built you just like he built you he gave you eyes just like he built your eyes he gave your hands just like he built your hands he gave you your nature just like he built you nobody can do like you do but god gave you an armor for the inside of you that the devil cannot defeat [Applause] remember who you are remember who you are our prophet brought the seven seals back to give them to us this was now the lamb's work the church could not tolerate this diet but there would be a people on the earth around the world that could tolerate it that would actually give their life for it and would stand in some very strugglesome if that's a word situations but because god had deposited something on the inside that only this message would work for them it didn't matter to abraham what lot said it didn't matter what the mayor said or what the the superintendent said what melchizedek told abraham would change his body what this ministry has done i'm not talking about mine but part of it but let me just say what the ministry of this day has done for this generation to turn your hearts to turn your heart to turn your passion what others could not stand it changed your life and i'm going to come to an end today maybe i'll pick it up next sunday is that okay what changed your life what changed your life what turned you same bible some of the same scriptures but under the right inspiration under the right anointing in the right atmosphere your life just changed your life just changed for many of those patients that were standing brother shannon with brother branham they were there they walked up sick they had cancer maybe blind but they walked up into an atmosphere and in a few moments they were not sick anymore literally in a few moments just two seconds really they went from being a cancer patient dying with a veil over them to live decades cancer-free or seeing sometimes that's what you come to church to do and you come to church and the devil has oppressed you and he's held you into bondage changed you men did incredible things to you in a matter of a few minutes you walk out and go i'm not the same person i i can't explain this but i'm i'm not the same person that i was when i walked in here what a powerful thing sometimes you're looking for a lightning bolt sometimes you're listening for thunder sometimes you're expecting the building to be shook and he comes like a still small voice and he just changes your life and you're just you're never the same you're never the same well brother ron can you give me some examples georgia carter hattie wright sister branham as herself even the prophet he suffered every every seven years with a condition and he was standing and he was standing and it just left him are you with me brother ron what's these services like sunday sunday after sunday and it seems like the angel lord's visiting he's doing business here he's doing business here and what you don't realize is cell after cell is dying in the preacher's body [Applause] because darkness cannot stay where light is so just as the moon shines in the darkness and darkness covers the earth come warning that light comes up over the hill and begins to glisten it disperses every drop of darkness i want to warn you mr satan you're being dispersed now for you that thought that sermon was for me it was but it was for you and if you can take the mind of a champion you'll quit that whining you'll quit that petty stuff you'll quit your excuses because i've looked into your eyes today and i've told you remember who you are brother ron i i'd like to have a counsel session with you and i'd like to just tell you my whole history i don't need to know as a matter of fact i don't want to know i'm not a dump sinner i don't want to know brother ron i want to tell you everything that's fighting me nope i don't want to know but i want to tell you who you are so you've came to the corner after you've

terrific hail storm and it dropped i believe seven to eight inches of hail but there was a there was a person that had been sitting there and had been crippled for nine years been in this condition for nine years but in the midst of all of that chaos that person got up off of that car got up out of their condition and walked out of there completely whole what could happen in a well body this
