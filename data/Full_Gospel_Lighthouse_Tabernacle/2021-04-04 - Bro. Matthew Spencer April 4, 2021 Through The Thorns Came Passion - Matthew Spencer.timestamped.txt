[57:08] amen
[57:09] let's just let's just go to the word
[57:11] this morning
[57:12] isaiah 53 and verse 1.
[57:16] and it says who hath believed our report
[57:20] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[57:21] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[57:24] as a tender plant as a root out of dry
[57:27] ground
[57:28] he hath no foreign form nor commonness
[57:31] and we shall see him there is no beauty
[57:35] that we should desire him he is despised
[57:39] and rejected of men
[57:40] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[57:43] grief
[57:44] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[57:47] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[57:51] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[57:53] carried our sorrows
[57:55] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[57:58] of god and afflicted
[58:01] but he was wounded for our
[58:02] transgressions
[58:04] he was bruised for our iniquities and
[58:07] the chastisement of our peace
[58:09] was upon him and with his stripes
[58:13] we are healed amen are you glad of that
[58:16] this morning
[58:18] with his stripes we are healed and it
[58:21] says in verse 6
[58:23] and all we like sheep have gone astray
[58:25] and we have turned everyone
[58:27] to his own way and the lord hath laid
[58:32] on him the iniquity of us all
[58:35] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[58:39] yet he opened not his mouth he was
[58:42] brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[58:44] and as a sheep before her shears is dumb
[58:47] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[58:50] from prison
[58:51] and from judgment and who shall declare
[58:54] his generation
[58:56] for he was cut off out of the land of
[58:58] the living
[58:59] for the transgressions of my people was
[59:01] he stricken
[59:03] and he made his grave with the wicked
[59:06] and with the rich in his death
[59:08] because he had done no violence
[59:11] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[59:14] it pleased the lord to bruise him
[59:17] he hath put him to grief and when thou
[59:20] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[59:24] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[59:27] his days
[59:28] and in the pleasure of the lord shall he
[59:30] prosper in his hand
[59:32] he shall see the travail of his soul
[59:35] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[59:39] shall my righteousness
[59:41] righteous servant be justified many
[59:44] for he shall bear their iniquities
[59:47] therefore i will divide a portion with
[59:49] the great
[59:51] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[59:53] strong
[59:54] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[59:57] death
[59:58] and he was numbered with the
[59:59] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[1:00:02] many
[1:00:04] and made intercession for the
[1:00:07] transgressors
[1:00:09] amen god bless you this morning you can
[1:00:11] be seated
[1:00:14] we know here in this scripture and in
[1:00:16] isaiah that
[1:00:17] that isaiah was reading these things
[1:00:21] and had a vision to be able to see
[1:00:23] things from the foundation of the earth
[1:00:29] you know it was it was asked what does
[1:00:32] easter mean
[1:00:33] to you i'd like to ask you that this
[1:00:36] morning what does easter mean to you is
[1:00:38] it
[1:00:39] is it just just to show off a new
[1:00:42] clothes or
[1:00:43] new hat or maybe it's to do easter eggs
[1:00:46] and
[1:00:47] you know we enjoy all these things and
[1:00:49] and i feel that we should wear the best
[1:00:50] for the lord so
[1:00:52] so we do these things you know so
[1:00:56] here a little bit we might have a meal
[1:00:57] prepared for us maybe ham and stuff but
[1:01:00] it
[1:01:00] that's not easter for us amen
[1:01:05] easter is more than than those things
[1:01:07] and
[1:01:08] you know you might be thinking of what
[1:01:10] you might be making and
[1:01:11] hopefully it's not overcooking in the
[1:01:13] crock pots or whatever it might be
[1:01:15] and you know a man asked his wife one
[1:01:18] time
[1:01:19] as she cut a ham in half and put it in
[1:01:21] the oven said no
[1:01:22] now why do you cut the ham in half and
[1:01:24] put it in the oven
[1:01:26] like that she said well that's the way
[1:01:28] my mother did it
[1:01:29] he said well why'd your mother do it
[1:01:31] that way well i don't know
[1:01:33] so she called up her mother said why did
[1:01:36] you cut your ham in half and put it
[1:01:38] in the oven she said well i
[1:01:41] that's where my mother did it so she
[1:01:44] called her mother
[1:01:45] said now now why did you cut your ham in
[1:01:48] half and put it in the oven like you did
[1:01:50] because we don't know why she said well
[1:01:52] i don't know about y'all's ovens
[1:01:54] but mine wasn't big enough for the whole
[1:01:56] ham
[1:01:58] amen so hopefully we haven't come
[1:02:01] tonight
[1:02:02] just because our mother come to have
[1:02:04] church
[1:02:06] and that's the way her mother come to
[1:02:07] have church but we want to come to
[1:02:09] church to serve him this morning
[1:02:12] amen god's so good to us isn't he
[1:02:17] and it says in matthew 27 and verse 27
[1:02:21] says then the soldiers of the governor
[1:02:24] took jesus
[1:02:25] into the common hall and gathered unto
[1:02:28] him
[1:02:29] the whole band of soldiers took a whole
[1:02:32] band of soldiers for one man
[1:02:35] and they stripped him and they put a
[1:02:38] scarlet robe on
[1:02:40] and when they had platted a crown of
[1:02:42] thorns
[1:02:44] they put it upon his head and a reed in
[1:02:47] his
[1:02:48] right hand and they bowed the knee
[1:02:51] before him and mocked him saying hail
[1:02:54] king of the jews and they spit upon him
[1:02:57] and they took a reed and smote him on
[1:02:59] the head
[1:03:01] and after they had mocked him they took
[1:03:03] the robot
[1:03:04] from him and they put on his own raiment
[1:03:09] and they let him away to be crucified
[1:03:12] this morning i would like to title my
[1:03:15] sermon
[1:03:16] through the thorns came passion
[1:03:22] as they planted the crown of thorns on
[1:03:25] his head
[1:03:27] i just cannot even imagine
[1:03:30] imagine what what that would have felt
[1:03:33] like
[1:03:35] as those thorns would protrude into the
[1:03:38] maybe the temples and and as it would be
[1:03:40] said they would cause stroke after
[1:03:42] stroke after stroke
[1:03:45] but still as isaiah said it he opened
[1:03:48] not his mouth
[1:03:50] he did all that this morning for us
[1:03:55] this morning i would like to take a
[1:03:56] little illustration
[1:03:58] and we know that the bible is not a
[1:04:01] fairy tale
[1:04:04] this is not no made up story
[1:04:07] but i would like to take a little bit of
[1:04:09] a fairy tale this morning as an
[1:04:10] illustration
[1:04:12] through the sleeping beauty you might
[1:04:15] think well that's odd
[1:04:17] just don't finish my sermon before i
[1:04:19] finish it here this morning
[1:04:23] so we we know sleeping beauty is as she
[1:04:26] was grown up that
[1:04:27] that it was told that she would prick
[1:04:30] her finger on a spindle
[1:04:33] well as it was said that she would be
[1:04:36] taken away into the forest and be
[1:04:38] watched over by the fairy godmothers
[1:04:41] well one day prince philip came riding
[1:04:44] through the woods and seen
[1:04:46] seeing aurora as she was singing and
[1:04:49] maybe she was just singing to the birds
[1:04:50] and the trees and
[1:04:52] he said wow what a beautiful voice
[1:04:56] what a beautiful young lady i'd like to
[1:04:59] have that as my bride one day
[1:05:02] so it would be that this this evil witch
[1:05:06] that had created this spindle and the
[1:05:07] curse that would fall upon sleeping
[1:05:09] beauty
[1:05:11] it would bestow her that on her birthday
[1:05:13] that this would come to pass
[1:05:16] well the king made ready and and as
[1:05:19] aurora came back into the castle they
[1:05:22] had tried to destroy
[1:05:23] all these spindles but the witch created
[1:05:27] one
[1:05:27] and she pricked her finger on the
[1:05:30] spindle
[1:05:32] fell asleep now prince
[1:05:35] philip he had heard that now this was
[1:05:38] his bride-to-be
[1:05:40] destined from way back
[1:05:43] so he took this this sword
[1:05:47] and his shield and he fought
[1:05:50] towards where the where aurora would be
[1:05:55] and the the evil witch he would create
[1:05:57] thorns and thistles
[1:05:59] trying to block him from getting to this
[1:06:02] bride
[1:06:05] and she would turn herself into a dragon
[1:06:08] and she would try to breathe fire down
[1:06:11] up on him
[1:06:12] but he would block it with the shield
[1:06:15] then he took this sword this sword that
[1:06:19] was made just for this dragon
[1:06:22] and he would fling it right into the
[1:06:24] dragon's heart
[1:06:26] the dragon would die fall to its death
[1:06:30] and there prince philip would make his
[1:06:32] way past a lot of the castle that was
[1:06:35] sleeping
[1:06:36] past the king and queen the other
[1:06:39] servants and whatsoever
[1:06:40] but would find a bride his bride
[1:06:44] and he would lay a kiss on her and she
[1:06:46] would awake
[1:06:49] happy ever after was aurora
[1:06:52] and prince philip but this morning i
[1:06:55] don't want to
[1:06:56] tell you a fairy tale
[1:06:59] i want to tell you a true tale of what
[1:07:02] god did for you and i
[1:07:05] along the same lines jesus pressed
[1:07:08] through the crowd
[1:07:09] pressed through the thorns making his
[1:07:13] way to calvary
[1:07:15] pushing on
[1:07:20] that was god's plan of protection for us
[1:07:23] in genesis it says
[1:07:25] he said i will put enmity between thee
[1:07:27] and the woman between thy seed and her
[1:07:30] seed
[1:07:30] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[1:07:32] shalt bruise his heel
[1:07:34] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[1:07:36] multiply thy sorrow and the conception
[1:07:39] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[1:07:41] children
[1:07:43] and thou shalt be to thy husband
[1:07:47] and he shall rule over thee and unto
[1:07:49] adam
[1:07:50] he said because thou has hearkened unto
[1:07:52] the voice of thy wife
[1:07:55] thou hast eaten of the tree of which i
[1:07:58] commandeth thee saying thou shalt not
[1:07:59] eat thereof
[1:08:01] cursed is the ground for thy sake in
[1:08:03] sorrow shalt thou
[1:08:05] eat all the days of thy life
[1:08:08] thorns and also thistle shall it bring
[1:08:10] forth to thee
[1:08:11] and thou shall eat of the herb of the
[1:08:13] field
[1:08:15] and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou
[1:08:17] eat the bread
[1:08:19] till thou return unto the ground for out
[1:08:21] of wish thou was taken for dust thou art
[1:08:25] and unto dust thou shalt return
[1:08:28] and adam called unto his wife
[1:08:31] named eve because she was the mother of
[1:08:34] all living
[1:08:36] and un and unto adam also
[1:08:39] to his wife did the lord make two
[1:08:43] make coats of skin and clothe them
[1:08:48] through this god said i'm gonna make a
[1:08:50] way for you
[1:08:53] as they was walking out of the garden of
[1:08:54] eden
[1:08:56] those lambskins bleeding upon their legs
[1:09:01] that lamb that was slain for us as god
[1:09:04] wrapped them he made that covenant i'll
[1:09:07] make a way for you
[1:09:11] you won't always be like this
[1:09:17] as prince philip came in with a kiss to
[1:09:20] wake sleeping beauty
[1:09:22] so has our god our god has came in with
[1:09:25] a kiss
[1:09:28] as an eagle would feed mouth to mouth
[1:09:32] so does the word of the lord go
[1:09:35] feeding mouth to mouth
[1:09:38] power of the spoken word
[1:09:42] in john 1 it says in the beginning was
[1:09:44] the word
[1:09:45] and the word was god and the word
[1:09:48] was with god and the same was in the
[1:09:50] beginning with god that all things were
[1:09:52] made by him
[1:09:53] and without him was not anything made
[1:09:56] that was made
[1:09:59] in the beginning that word has never
[1:10:02] changed
[1:10:05] before paul and luke and john and all
[1:10:09] them wrote
[1:10:10] wrote it in the bibles it was in
[1:10:12] existence
[1:10:13] before then god's never had a new
[1:10:17] thought
[1:10:19] never changed his word
[1:10:22] but it came to us to call us out
[1:10:27] and it says heaven and earth shall pass
[1:10:30] away but my words shall never pass away
[1:10:34] as edward moat would write this in the
[1:10:36] 1800s says my hope is built on nothing
[1:10:38] less
[1:10:39] than jesus christ and righteousness i
[1:10:43] dare not
[1:10:44] trust the sweetest frame but holy lean
[1:10:47] on jesus name
[1:10:48] on christ the solid rock i stand
[1:10:52] all other ground is sinking sand
[1:10:56] all other ground is sinking stand
[1:10:59] you can stand upon the word of god he's
[1:11:02] our rock
[1:11:03] he's our refuge in time of trouble
[1:11:06] jesus was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:11:10] and we beheld his glory as the glory of
[1:11:13] god the only begotten
[1:11:15] son of the father full of grace and
[1:11:16] truth
[1:11:18] in hebrews 4 says it like this the word
[1:11:20] of god is quick and powerful
[1:11:22] and sharper than any two is it sword
[1:11:24] piercing
[1:11:26] even dividing the sunderer of the soul
[1:11:27] the spirit and the joints and the marrow
[1:11:30] and is the discerner and thoughts
[1:11:32] intents of the heart
[1:11:35] that word of the lord as brother branham
[1:11:37] would say it
[1:11:38] it goes deeper than the flesh it goes
[1:11:40] deeper than the meat
[1:11:42] deeper than the morrow of the bone but
[1:11:45] it goes into a place
[1:11:47] a soul discerner of the false intents of
[1:11:50] the heart
[1:11:51] that is what the word does for us
[1:11:55] that's what he's done for us in this
[1:11:57] last day
[1:11:58] as an eagle would i'm pulling for
[1:12:01] brother branham's as an eagle stir for
[1:12:02] his nests if you'd like to go back and
[1:12:04] listen to that but
[1:12:05] as an eagle would stand up on her nest
[1:12:08] and she began to walk back and forth
[1:12:11] and she would call what was she doing
[1:12:14] she was letting her eaglets hear her
[1:12:16] voice
[1:12:19] why why would she do such a thing like
[1:12:21] this
[1:12:22] it's because when she takes them and
[1:12:24] through the perils of the storms
[1:12:26] and times of struggles they know
[1:12:29] her voice aren't you glad you know his
[1:12:33] voice this morning
[1:12:34] that voice that has called out come out
[1:12:37] of her my people
[1:12:39] amen that power of that spoken word
[1:12:43] let me just tell you a true story not a
[1:12:46] fairy tale of a damsel that's been
[1:12:48] arisen
[1:12:49] jerry is his daughter jerry is
[1:12:52] in the synagogues and we know that he
[1:12:55] come to jesus and said his daughter was
[1:12:58] sleeping and stricken a sickness had
[1:13:01] come upon her
[1:13:02] so jesus made his way to where jerius's
[1:13:05] house was
[1:13:07] and there was many that was round about
[1:13:11] and they would they was crying and
[1:13:13] making such a do
[1:13:14] he said why weepest thou would do for
[1:13:18] the damsel was not dead
[1:13:20] but she only sleepeth
[1:13:24] and they laughed him to scorn a lot of
[1:13:26] them
[1:13:27] a lot of them didn't think he could do
[1:13:28] it but he would take the father and the
[1:13:31] mother and go in
[1:13:32] and grab the damsel by the hand and he
[1:13:34] would call
[1:13:35] telithikumi which being interpreted as
[1:13:38] damsel arrives
[1:13:40] and she arose straightway talithikumi
[1:13:45] arise arise that word of the lord
[1:13:49] went deeper than the morrow went deeper
[1:13:52] within the bone
[1:13:54] into the heart into the soul and called
[1:13:56] out and said
[1:13:57] arise and the life was brought back
[1:14:02] there's another one that was spoken
[1:14:03] lazarus
[1:14:06] as martha came and said lazarus has gone
[1:14:10] lazarus have died if thou wouldst have
[1:14:14] been here lazarus would not have died
[1:14:17] lazarus would not have died and he
[1:14:21] she said to him jesus but i know
[1:14:23] whatsoever thou asked the father
[1:14:26] thou shall do it and he said
[1:14:30] he shall not die but he shall live again
[1:14:32] and she said
[1:14:33] i know that he'll live again in that
[1:14:36] last day of the resurrection
[1:14:38] but jesus said i am the resurrection

[1:19:09] hallelujah
[1:19:11] ezekiel looks over the top it says i
[1:19:13] seen that person as a wheel in the
[1:19:15] middle of the wheel
[1:19:16] turning way up in the middle of the air
[1:19:18] and i could see
[1:19:19] enoch said i saw him coming to
[1:19:22] with his ten thousands of saints to
[1:19:24] execute judgments
[1:19:27] and he looks over and he says brethren i
[1:19:30] am the one that you think i am
[1:19:34] i am the seed of the woman i am the son
[1:19:36] of david
[1:19:37] i am the son of god i am the virgin born
[1:19:41] one
[1:19:42] my blood has atoned it for you
[1:19:45] you had to wait here until the blood of
[1:19:47] sheeps and goats
[1:19:48] under that blood but my blood has atoned
[1:19:51] it for you
[1:19:53] and you're free you're free this morning
[1:19:58] oh hallelujah as he comes up with those
[1:20:00] saints
[1:20:01] walking around meeting his disciples
[1:20:06] saturday was a bad day for all of them
[1:20:09] they were saddened by everything they
[1:20:12] thought everything's over
[1:20:14] the miracles that we've seen maybe it's
[1:20:16] over the one that we believed in has
[1:20:18] been crucified
[1:20:20] but on sunday morning
[1:20:23] oh king i'll see you in the morning
[1:20:28] morning's coming and he came forth
[1:20:32] he came forth his blood has atoned it
[1:20:35] for us
[1:20:37] he has fulfilled it this easter morning
[1:20:41] we can rest assure in that
[1:20:44] as a mother eagle would would miss an
[1:20:48] egg due to a farmer pulling it and
[1:20:50] putting it in a chicken yard
[1:20:52] to raise it under a chicken brother
[1:20:54] brandon would tell this story and
[1:20:56] he'd say that old eagle would rise up
[1:20:59] underneath
[1:21:00] those chickens and he just knew
[1:21:02] something was wrong
[1:21:05] he just knew that the worms and
[1:21:08] just staying down here on the ground
[1:21:09] wasn't meant for him
[1:21:12] and the chickens would just wonder why
[1:21:14] why why why would you
[1:21:16] want to do something else other than
[1:21:17] this this is great
[1:21:20] but one day the eagle
[1:21:23] said i'm missing one she began to cry
[1:21:26] out
[1:21:28] that call that word that i was talking
[1:21:30] about while ago
[1:21:32] he realized what is
[1:21:35] i know that voice
[1:21:38] i know that sound i know that sound
[1:21:42] as she cried over top of him i know that
[1:21:44] sound
[1:21:45] and he had to jump up on the fence post
[1:21:47] and she
[1:21:48] said spread those wings you gotta come
[1:21:50] up a little higher than that
[1:21:52] you gotta come up a little higher than
[1:21:54] that fence post young man
[1:21:56] come on up she called again and he went
[1:21:59] soaring
[1:22:00] spread those wings little eagle spread
[1:22:03] them out
[1:22:05] you were made to sword
[1:22:09] rahab was in the safest place that she
[1:22:12] could be
[1:22:14] because she applied the token
[1:22:18] as those those spies told her said apply
[1:22:21] that scarlet
[1:22:22] cord over thy window
[1:22:26] apply that token we have to apply that
[1:22:29] token in our lives today
[1:22:31] you'll be in the safest place you've
[1:22:33] ever been this whole world might feel
[1:22:35] like
[1:22:36] thorns and thistles poking in at you but
[1:22:39] it's time to leave the nest
[1:22:41] it's time to get on out of this old past
[1:22:43] house
[1:22:47] she was chosen as brother brandon would
[1:22:50] say it like this and i know my redeemer
[1:22:52] live she was god's chosen
[1:22:55] for that purpose we are god's chosen
[1:22:58] people today
[1:23:00] who believed in the resurrection of the
[1:23:02] lord jesus
[1:23:03] and there is no bombs there is no hell
[1:23:07] and there is nothing that can destroy
[1:23:08] god's purpose
[1:23:11] we've got to go in the resurrection it's
[1:23:14] the promise that we have
[1:23:16] god's purpose we're fulfilling god's
[1:23:19] purpose
[1:23:20] this morning god's promise to us
[1:23:24] job said it i know my redeemer liveth
[1:23:28] though through all the skin bowls and
[1:23:30] his wife
[1:23:33] tell them just cursed god and die
[1:23:36] god spoke to him and said come here i
[1:23:39] want to show you something
[1:23:41] raised up the curtain maybe a little
[1:23:43] bread brother brandon would say
[1:23:45] and he saw easter morning for the first
[1:23:47] time
[1:23:48] and he said i know that my redeemer
[1:23:51] liveth
[1:23:53] i know that he liveth and he's come
[1:23:56] forth
[1:24:00] he's done that for us as he pressed
[1:24:03] through those thorns
[1:24:06] and we used that word of the lord to cut
[1:24:08] the devil
[1:24:09] christ hath redeemed us galatians 3 and
[1:24:12] 13
[1:24:13] christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[1:24:16] of the law
[1:24:17] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:24:20] written
[1:24:21] cursed is the one that hangeth on the
[1:24:23] tree
[1:24:25] it's the greatest love story this
[1:24:27] morning that god could give to us
[1:24:30] though it looked like the worst murder
[1:24:32] there was
[1:24:34] as he was being beaten
[1:24:37] all these soldiers was taking out any
[1:24:40] anger that they ever had to beat this
[1:24:43] man
[1:24:46] cat nine tails that would rip flesh from
[1:24:48] his body
[1:24:50] thorns pressed into his head mocked
[1:24:53] spit upon carried the cross
[1:24:57] but he did it for you and i he redeemed
[1:25:00] us
[1:25:02] christ redeemed us and he went down to
[1:25:05] the pit of hill
[1:25:08] and took that sting of death
[1:25:11] for my father's house are many mansions
[1:25:14] and we're going to go there one of these
[1:25:16] days he's prepared it for us
[1:25:20] i don't have it in my notes but it just
[1:25:22] comes to my mind the armor
[1:25:25] armorer son as he made a promise
[1:25:28] to that little girl that was washing
[1:25:30] dishes one day
[1:25:32] said one day i'm going to come back for
[1:25:34] you
[1:25:35] you be ready you be ready
[1:25:39] she was made fun of
[1:25:42] but she put her wedding ground on and
[1:25:44] stepped out
[1:25:46] as they continue to make fun of her
[1:25:50] but towards that hour they begin to hear
[1:25:53] the hoof prince
[1:25:54] of the horse the wagon coming
[1:25:58] and he would sweep her away never have
[1:26:01] to wash dishes anymore
[1:26:04] that was his bride that's what god's
[1:26:07] done for
[1:26:08] us today he's pressed forth you're his
[1:26:11] bride
[1:26:12] he put that kiss upon you to seal you
[1:26:21] we all know this scripture in john 3 16
[1:26:25] for god so loved the world that he would
[1:26:27] give his only begotten son
[1:26:29] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:26:32] not perish
[1:26:33] but have everlasting life
[1:26:37] for god sent his son to this world not
[1:26:40] could to
[1:26:40] condemn the world
[1:26:44] excuse me for god sent not his son into
[1:26:47] the world
[1:26:48] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:26:50] through him might be saved
[1:26:54] we thank the lord for that
[1:26:58] us as men and women today couldn't go
[1:27:00] through what he went through
[1:27:02] he's made our body to not go through
[1:27:04] that
[1:27:06] but he took it all every stripe
[1:27:09] he took it all for us this morning
[1:27:13] i want to ask you this morning maybe
[1:27:16] you've been
[1:27:16] pricked by the world maybe you're still
[1:27:20] asleep
[1:27:22] to those that might think that this
[1:27:25] is a bad sermon or whatever it may be i
[1:27:27] don't care i'm talking to the ones right
[1:27:29] now that's been pricked of the world

[1:27:45] them

[1:29:05] morning
[1:29:06] and they would look in and they would
[1:29:09] see the grave clothes
[1:29:11] piled to the side but there was a napkin
[1:29:16] that had covered his face and it was
[1:29:19] folded
[1:29:21] now it's told in the hebrews tradition
[1:29:24] that a master
[1:29:25] and the servant had the relationship to
