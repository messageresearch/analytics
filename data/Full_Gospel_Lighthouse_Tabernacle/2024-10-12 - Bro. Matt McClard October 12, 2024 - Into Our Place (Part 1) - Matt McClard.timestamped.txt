[1:12:02] Redemption through his blood listen
[1:12:05] saints of God the blood must be in its
[1:12:08] place they received a message from
[1:12:11] Moses but it's time they take the
[1:12:13] message and put it into action Moses
[1:12:16] didn't come to each one of their
[1:12:17] doorposts and be like all right here's
[1:12:19] how you do
[1:12:20] it I know a lot of us would be like well

[1:16:12] of God begin to speak the word of God
[1:16:15] and you watch God come right behind your
[1:16:17] words come on little bride you got a

[1:16:31] speak come on

[1:16:43] place he took
[1:16:45] ours he became me he took my place I
[1:16:50] should have been the one on the cross
[1:16:52] but he took my place that now by the
[1:16:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost I can stand as
[1:16:58] a son and stand as a Son of God and
[1:17:01] stand in my position in my place that he
[1:17:04] called me to that he brought me to I
[1:17:06] didn't do it for myself he did it for me
[1:17:09] but he brought me there he took my place
[1:17:13] but now it's time for us to stand in our
[1:17:14] place come on L see you you ain't L to
[1:17:16] see you I said come on little bride it's
[1:17:18] time for you to stand and
[1:17:21] overcome brother man would say this he
[1:17:22] says Bo I'd like to say something I
[1:17:24] can't forget what I was I remember what
[1:17:26] he was if I can remember Jesus I can
[1:17:28] remember
[1:17:30] him if I can remember Jesus I can
[1:17:33] remember him at the cross if I can
[1:17:35] remember what he done for me I can
[1:17:37] remember the hour that he washed away my
[1:17:38] sins and give me the holy spirit to
[1:17:40] guide me that I'm lifted above
[1:17:42] everything that holds this Earth I'm
[1:17:45] lifted above every Earthly thing in
[1:17:47] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I
[1:17:48] can fellowship with him there in his
[1:17:50] presence forgetting what I ever
[1:17:53] was how many ever got to that place
[1:17:56] where you just lost all sense of who you
[1:17:58] used to be well let me tell you he
[1:18:00] doesn't remember who you used to be he
[1:18:02] remembers who you are oh glory Lord let
[1:18:07] that sink in for just a minute he
[1:18:08] doesn't remember who you used to
[1:18:10] be justified as if you never did it in
[1:18:14] the first place his thoughts of you are
[1:18:17] pure that's the reason he could write it
[1:18:19] in the word unreprovable that means you
[1:18:21] can't correct Her She's Mine I paid the
[1:18:24] price for her I redeemed her she was a
[1:18:27] fallen bride but I came and I took her
[1:18:30] place on that
[1:18:33] cost you know one time listen
[1:18:36] don't that first quote I read talked of
[1:18:38] a football team trying to take somebody
[1:18:40] else's place not everybody's place is to
[1:18:43] stand behind this
[1:18:45] Pulpit that's
[1:18:46] right but this person can't stand behind
[1:18:49] a Pulpit and sit there
[1:18:51] too so it needs somebody to take their
[1:18:53] place there was one time Moses
[1:18:55] they were having a battle and he got
[1:18:58] weary and he needed somebody to come up
[1:19:01] beside him and help him and here comes
[1:19:04] Aaron and her you know who took part in
[1:19:07] that Victory Aaron and her that's right
[1:19:11] Moses could not have done what Moses
[1:19:13] needed to do if it had not been for
[1:19:16] others in their place so saints of God
[1:19:18] you may not think your place is
[1:19:19] important but you are causing more
[1:19:22] victories than you realize by coming up
[1:19:24] beside him and lifting him up in prayer
[1:19:27] and raising the weary hands Abra Moses
[1:19:29] said his hands got heavy heavy means
[1:19:32] weariness there's sometimes as a
[1:19:34] preacher I can't explain it you get
[1:19:36] weary you pour yourself out you pour
[1:19:38] yourself out you pour yourself out and
[1:19:40] sometimes there's not anything left to
[1:19:42] give and yet you come to the pull pit
[1:19:46] anyway and then the Church of the Living
[1:19:48] God begins to
[1:19:52] pull and God comes down
[1:19:56] it's because you're in your
[1:20:01] place brother said this he say he took
[1:20:03] my place that I had no right to go
[1:20:05] nowhere but to hell he took my place and
[1:20:08] lifted me up from hell he went there for
[1:20:10] me and he Lifted Me Up by his grace in
[1:20:13] abundance until now we are Sons and
[1:20:15] Daughters of God and we sit in Heavenly
[1:20:18] places in Christ Jesus every rejoicing
[1:20:20] remembering him who brought us safe thus
[1:20:23] far and with a Paul said faith in our
[1:20:25] souls pressing us and by Grace he'll
[1:20:28] take me on and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:32] begins to rejoice and say Amen let's say
[1:20:35] it again
[1:20:36] amen that's right
[1:20:41] brother I'm going to deal with something
[1:20:42] real quick your past your past tries to
[1:20:45] hold you from taking your
[1:20:48] position but let me tell you God has no
[1:20:50] record of your past if the blood is in
[1:20:53] his place go God has no record of your
[1:20:55] past that's nothing but a lying Spirit
[1:20:58] out of hell trying to keep you from your
[1:21:00] position because once you come into your
[1:21:02] position you begin to bless others come
[1:21:04] on somebody once you come into your
[1:21:06] place there's a supernatural that me to
[1:21:12] happen I can't breath brother
[1:21:14] William he can't be me but I tell you
[1:21:18] what we're in the same Army and when God
[1:21:20] calls him to get up here and fire away
[1:21:22] he going to give up here and fire away
[1:21:23] and I'm going to be right there sitting
[1:21:24] right there saying come on buddy preach
[1:21:28] it there is no big eyes and big little
[1:21:31] use in this message there is one body
[1:21:34] and this body is moving to a Rapture
[1:21:37] it's time we get in our place don't lift
[1:21:40] up no man but lift up the name of Jesus
[1:21:43] Christ and put him in his
[1:21:45] place and let's move
[1:21:49] body let's move Bud it takes you
[1:21:53] together
[1:21:56] and you know what Satan doesn't like you
[1:21:57] to hear that he doesn't like you to hear
[1:21:59] it say Amen so he'll try to cause a
[1:22:01] little

[1:29:40] something beat I have my earbuds in and
[1:29:42] I'm in my
[1:29:44] garage there was a car in my garage and
[1:29:47] my garage was wide open and I live in
[1:29:48] the neighborhood and I had myself a
[1:29:50] dancing fit right there in my garage and
[1:29:52] nobody heard any music but me
[1:29:56] [Applause]

[1:29:58] Plum nuts and I don't care I knew who I
[1:30:02] was dancing for I was dancing for my
[1:30:05] Lord and he deserves every bit of Praise
[1:30:08] even if it's on a Monday on a Tuesday in
[1:30:11] my garage he deserves my
[1:30:15] praise nobody is going to take your
[1:30:19] place nobody
[1:30:29] preeminence means to hold the first
[1:30:32] place let him hold the first
[1:30:36] place let him hold the first
[1:30:39] place you know why he's convicting about
[1:30:41] Instagram and Facebook and all those
[1:30:42] things because he just wants the first
[1:30:44] place
[1:30:54] that's good isn't it that's all right
[1:30:56] we'll let it
[1:30:58] go you know the lord gave me a couple
[1:31:01] years ago I was driving down the road
[1:31:03] and this quote came up it says his great
[1:31:05] major events happens in Heavens before
[1:31:07] it happens on the earth he reflects him
[1:31:09] in in other words before Messiah came
[1:31:11] into his place where his ministry would
[1:31:13] start there came for the star out of
[1:31:15] heaven and guided the man to the place
[1:31:17] where he was to Wi them when I heard
[1:31:19] this my mind immediately went to the
[1:31:21] cloud
[1:31:25] oh Lord before there was a major event
[1:31:27] on Earth he always shows it in the
[1:31:32] heavens brother bam didn't even
[1:31:34] recognize what it
[1:31:35] was but what was
[1:31:39] it let me catch my scripture and then
[1:31:41] we'll they'll tie it together and he is
[1:31:43] the head of the body to the church
[1:31:47] right so when you look at this message
[1:31:49] the right
[1:31:50] way you got to turn it to the right
[1:31:54] brother M said turn I wish I had those
[1:31:55] pictures I should have gave them to you
[1:31:56] Adam or whoever's up there those
[1:31:57] pictures brother M had the picture and
[1:31:59] it was like this and he didn't really
[1:32:00] understand it I believe it's in the
[1:32:01] riseing the Sun or in one of those he
[1:32:03] says and then the Lord told me turn it
[1:32:04] to the right and what was right this is
[1:32:06] how it came up now turn it to the right
[1:32:08] buddy can you if you flip
[1:32:09] it oh Glory
[1:32:12] hallu it was the
[1:32:15] head but where was the body it was the
[1:32:18] head coming to the body listen sints of
[1:32:21] God this message the revelation of the
[1:32:24] Seven Seals was the mind of God it was
[1:32:26] not brother brandom's message it was the
[1:32:28] head coming to the body let's don't
[1:32:31] question the head let's don't question
[1:32:33] the mind of god let's don't question the
[1:32:35] vision that God gave us but let's say
[1:32:37] Amen to every word and the body will
[1:32:40] come right in step with the message of
[1:32:42] the hour the headship god coming down
[1:32:46] and moving this bride into a
[1:32:49] Rapture I begin to think on that it was
[1:32:51] the head coming to the body it was not
[1:32:53] brother ROM's thoughts it was not
[1:32:55] brother ROM's message come on somebody
[1:32:57] it was not his message how do you know
[1:32:59] that brother man the word says only the
[1:33:01] lamb could reveal the seals but God used
[1:33:05] William brandom don't lift him above his
[1:33:07] place and don't put him below his place
[1:33:10] but keep him in his place he was our
[1:33:13] Prophet to speak our message and let us
[1:33:16] know the head has come to the body
[1:33:24] amen makes this message all listen get
[1:33:27] into that message you know where that
[1:33:29] message is supposed to be in your mouth
[1:33:33] you're supposed to be eating it
[1:33:35] Revelations 10 89 go on down 10 1- 7's
[1:33:38] been
[1:33:40] fulfilled but there's going to be a
[1:33:41] people that are going to The Mighty
[1:33:43] Angel

[1:33:49] can't give it to you but there's one in
[1:33:51] the room that can give it to you and you
[1:33:53] got to have a relationship with him and
[1:33:56] when you get in a relationship with him
[1:33:58] it's like that husband telling his wife
[1:34:00] all the secret things of his heart he's
[1:34:02] letting her know this is
[1:34:08] me
[1:34:11] Hallelujah go look at those quotes on
[1:34:12] the cloud you know why they don't like
[1:34:15] the cloud because they don't recognize
[1:34:16] what it is but we in Simplicity say well
[1:34:20] that's the head where's the body oh that
[1:34:23] was coming down down through the message
[1:34:25] of the hour the headship was coming that
[1:34:28] now the body would have the mechanics
[1:34:30] and the Dynamics and know what pleases
[1:34:33] her King she's not questioning listen
