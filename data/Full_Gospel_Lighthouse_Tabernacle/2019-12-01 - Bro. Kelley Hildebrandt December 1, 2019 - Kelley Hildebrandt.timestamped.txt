[0:00] [Applause]
[0:14] if he deserved all of that I say a man
[0:17] traveled three days to preach to us he
[0:19] deserves that more
[0:22] god bless you all it's so good to be
[0:26] here we had quite the events the last
[0:30] few days and I don't think we'll ever
[0:33] quite have that same pattern ever happen
[0:35] to us again but man we sat on that
[0:38] tarmac a long time
[0:40] we're over six hours on that airplane
[0:42] and they couldn't even give you hardly
[0:45] any water find the awesome for a cop and
[0:47] he gave me one to look up but we were
[0:49] there and then the pilot said he said
[0:53] well he said we got a 50-50 chance
[0:55] whether this engines gonna work and we
[0:58] thought well we're gonna take that
[0:59] chance and we did take it it was it was
[1:03] scary when he took off and well we're
[1:08] here and we're here because of your
[1:11] prayers is why we're here then we ended
[1:14] up in Toronto yesterday and we were
[1:16] supposed to get our flight to come to
[1:18] Washington and and they had oversold it
[1:21] they lost our reservation somehow in
[1:23] their system and and so we were on
[1:26] standby when we ate all us we had
[1:28] guaranteed seats and we walked right to
[1:31] the farthest end of Toronto Airport that
[1:33] you cared for a walk to and and then the
[1:38] girl said you know what you're better
[1:40] off to go home and I said I'm not going
[1:44] home I said you're gonna find me some
[1:47] seats I said I'm gonna stand right here
[1:51] while you do it at the same time you
[1:55] were praying here and I believe that God
[1:57] supernaturally gave them the ability to
[2:00] find seats they called all the people
[2:02] they could call and finally they said we
[2:04] have two seats for you going to
[2:06] Washington tomorrow morning so we were
[2:09] really thrilled about that
[2:11] while there's so many things that
[2:13] happened in that time period and but we
[2:15] thank you each one of you for your
[2:17] prayers thank you for that and brother
[2:20] Ron thank you for what you all have said
[2:22] we are family
[2:24] and we feel like we're family and we've
[2:27] been with coming here for a while now
[2:28] and maybe a few new faces but we just
[2:32] feel like we're part of you people the
[2:33] first time I came here to this church I
[2:37] don't know if you want to stand for a
[2:38] while that's fine if you want to sit
[2:40] down that's fine too but first time I
[2:42] came here I remember brother Homer
[2:45] saying that song ain't no grave gonna
[2:47] hold my body down and and actually
[2:51] became one of my favorite songs as well
[2:53] and while I was traveling here actually
[2:56] was on my heart that they would sing
[2:58] that song while I'd be here not knowing
[3:02] that they would actually sing it today
[3:03] and what a blessing it was to have it
[3:05] song I I kind of had a Jubilee time
[3:20] sometimes you don't realize but God
[3:22] works on both ends of the stick you're
[3:25] practicing and not knowing it's on my
[3:27] heart and sister Meir knows one of my
[3:30] favorite songs I play it once in a while
[3:32] and I just really feel the anointing
[3:34] because I I believe in a supernatural
[3:35] God and whether I'm living or whether I
[3:39] go by the way of the grave there ain't
[3:41] no grave gonna hold this body down when
[3:44] he calls I'm gonna answer you we're
[3:46] gonna answer amen and what a time we're
[3:48] looking for is for that time well our
[3:52] church sends its greetings to you all
[3:54] and sister Kay sends her greetings and
[3:57] it's nice that brother can't sister
[3:59] Lorraine with us and we certainly do
[4:01] appreciate your pastor brother Ron and
[4:05] his family they've been real friends to
[4:07] us and thank you for sharing him once in
[4:10] a while with us back in Saskatchewan and
[4:12] we try to make him feel comfortable
[4:14] enough that they'll come back again even
[4:16] if it gets cold outside and you know
[4:19] we've had such a wonderful times with
[4:21] them in the Lord and they've been a
[4:23] great asset to our assembly and helped
[4:25] our people a lot and our family a lot
[4:28] and I want to say God bless you and
[4:30] thank you for for allowing him to come
[4:33] our way if you have your Bibles tonight
[4:36] I want to turn to first Thessalonians
[4:38] chapter 1 and I'd like to read verse 5
[4:43] isn't the Lord good to us amen we did
[4:49] get to visit while we were kind of
[4:51] saying our sister Maura I said you know
[4:53] what this is interesting is that we're
[4:54] flying one city a day and that's what
[4:58] we've done for three days and we're so
[5:00] happy to be here
[5:01] first Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 5
[5:04] very familiar Scripture no doubt it's
[5:07] been been used many times over this
[5:09] pulpit here for our gospel came not unto
[5:12] you in word only but also in power and
[5:16] in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance
[5:18] as you know what manner of men we were
[5:22] among you for your sake let's just go to
[5:25] the Lord in prayer for a moment if you
[5:27] have a need upon your heart just with an
[5:29] uplifted hand
[5:31] here this evening our we believe God
[5:33] hears in the answers prayer Lord Jesus
[5:36] what a privilege it is Lord to be
[5:38] gathered together again Lord in this
[5:40] house Lord a place Lord that has set
[5:44] aside Lord for worship a place where
[5:46] your word can be spoken Lord in in
[5:49] freedom Lord and we pray father and we
[5:52] thank you Lord for bringing us safely
[5:53] here we appreciate these people or the
[5:57] prayers of the people Lord and and the
[5:59] pastor brother Ron his family Lord the
[6:02] people of this assembly and I pray now
[6:05] Lord that you'll just take full control
[6:07] of this service Lord may the holy spirit
[6:10] move in in a mighty way amongst us
[6:12] tonight Lord and Lord may you meet every
[6:15] need of each person that would be here
[6:17] Lord we believe with all our hearts Lord
[6:19] that you here and that you answer a
[6:21] prayer and so father we are looking unto
[6:24] you now I pray father that you would
[6:26] take the tiredness Lord from my body
[6:28] Lord and may you just charge it Lord by
[6:31] His supernatural intervention Lord we
[6:34] commit this service unto you now for the
[6:36] glory of God in Jesus Christ's name we
[6:39] pray amen amen god bless you you may
[6:42] have your seats tonight it was a few
[6:46] months ago I received a pamphlet in the
[6:50] mail in on that particular pamphlet
[6:53] there was a commemorative coin from
[6:56] world war ii which which is really a
[6:59] symbol of victory but what caught my
[7:02] attention with this particular coin and
[7:05] i remember brother ron mentioning to me
[7:08] while he was at our assembly that you
[7:10] had a brother in your church by the name
[7:12] of brother max Evans and he was actually
[7:15] part of that Normandy invasion that came
[7:19] in there and I received this coin and it
[7:24] really caught my attention when I read
[7:26] the pamphlet and said on it we will
[7:28] accept nothing less than full victory
[7:31] which was which was written by Dwight
[7:35] Eisenhower and as the d-day coin and and
[7:38] I showed it to brother Ron when he was
[7:40] out of our church if you want to just
[7:42] come forward brother Ron
[7:43] and it was something they said it was
[7:45] for one family in Canada if he wanted to
[7:48] order it and so what I did is I was able
[7:50] to get another coin and I wanted to give
[7:53] it to you hear this more this evening
[7:55] hour on that coin is actually an
[8:15] embedded into the coin is actually the
[8:17] actual sound from Norman Dean when I
[8:20] read that coin I there was such a
[8:23] powerful statement to me when he said
[8:26] full victory that I I applied it and I
[8:29] thought about ourselves as Christians in
[8:30] this hour in message believers that we
[8:33] should accept nothing less than full
[8:35] victory and and if I could for a moment
[8:39] of time tonight I'd like to administer
[8:40] to us for a while just on that thought I
[8:43] don't know where you are in your walk
[8:45] with the Lord but I believe that we're
[8:47] in an hour where the Church of the
[8:49] Living God is rising in a higher level
[8:52] in this ever risen before Amen we're in
[8:55] the timeframe where we're actually
[8:57] called in order to have a body change
[9:00] where the dead and Christ will rise and
[9:02] and I believe that in order for that to
[9:04] transpire we have to have a faith that
[9:07] we've never had before amen we we've
[9:10] read a lot of books we listen to a lot
[9:12] of tapes and and when we study the
[9:15] message but there's gonna come a time
[9:17] when this bride actually is moving in
[9:20] action
[9:21] amen worse not just letters on a page
[9:24] any longer but it's something more
[9:26] that's coming into the heart of the
[9:28] believer amen and and I believe we've
[9:31] turned a corner with in many of our
[9:33] assemblies in our sembly we turn a
[9:35] corner where the Spirit of God is moving
[9:38] in ways that he's never moved before
[9:40] amen I believe we're getting ready for a
[9:43] take-off time amen in the church in this
[9:46] hour I believe should be moving on in in
[9:49] full victory all the time we go through
[9:52] our battles and we go through our trials
[9:54] and we go through our difficulties but
[9:56] when Christ
[9:57] is living down in our heart not just
[9:59] something that's a mechanical or
[10:01] something that it's intellectual but
[10:03] something that drops down into our heart
[10:06] into the soil relman and has completely
[10:09] changed us and make us new creatures in
[10:11] Christ Jesus
[10:12] amen when that transpires in our heart
[10:15] there's an unction from the Holy One
[10:17] that takes ahold of the church amen
[10:20] like we've read it and we've we've
[10:22] listened to it but there's got to come a
[10:24] time when this church of the Living God
[10:26] stands on her feet in power and in
[10:30] victory
[10:31] amen not just part of the time but all
[10:33] the time amen maybe just a little more
[10:36] monitor if you could I believe it's
[10:38] transpiring amen we're seeing people
[10:41] that are that are sick we're seeing
[10:43] people get healed we're seeing people
[10:46] who have lived lives of lukewarmness who
[10:48] are standing now in the inner power in
[10:51] this hour that they've never saw before
[10:53] amen
[10:54] I believe with all my heart the church
[10:57] is rising on we sing the song the church
[11:00] is rising up but it's no longer just
[11:02] words within there within their
[11:04] vocabulary it's something that's real
[11:07] within their heart amen may the church
[11:10] say so tonight amen we're time when the
[11:14] word is being quickened to her heart
[11:16] amen and we believe it with all her
[11:19] heart it's something that has settled in
[11:21] our heart I was reading something just
[11:23] the other day that that somebody sent to
[11:26] me and and a brother and a man that Smit
[11:28] preached this word this gospel for 40
[11:31] years ulsan he's deciding that there's
[11:34] nothing to it anymore in my heart I made
[11:37] up my mind a long time ago amen this
[11:41] message of the hour is something that
[11:44] it's going to bring a rapture on to the
[11:46] Church of the Living God amen it's
[11:48] bringing a faith in her heart
[11:50] amen to believe the Word of God and to
[11:52] apply it in their lives in action a
[11:55] minutes than this hour amen all the ages
[11:59] have looked for this day but I believe
[12:01] that we're in the time frame at this
[12:04] hour where the Spirit of God is moving
[12:06] among the people amen
[12:09] times we say well you know we come to
[12:12] church and and we hear sermon after
[12:14] sermon and and we hear gifted man
[12:17] preaching and we hear other people
[12:19] minister and whatever more but we don't
[12:21] realize that as we eat this word in this
[12:24] hour it is literally changing us Amen I
[12:28] look at a child you look at a little
[12:30] baby you feed them and feed them and
[12:32] feed them it seems like nothing's
[12:34] happening but something's happening
[12:36] there's a change that's happening John
[12:38] on the inside
[12:39] amen and that child before you know it
[12:42] starts to grow in stature but there
[12:44] comes a time where it's full-grown amen
[12:47] this is the hour
[12:48] that the bride of Jesus Christ should be
[12:50] standing on her feet believing the Word
[12:53] of God applying that Word of God in her
[12:56] life amen
[12:58] what good would it be just to have a
[13:00] word and have nothing true that word
[13:03] Amen that would make us no better than a
[13:05] Baptists or a Presbyterian or even a
[13:09] Pentecostal or anything like that
[13:11] organization what is it that would make
[13:13] us no more than that there's got to be
[13:15] something more than that amen and people
[13:18] are and many times I find people are
[13:20] afraid of the supernatural God when we
[13:23] should not be afraid of the supernatural
[13:25] God we should embrace it with all of our
[13:27] heart
[13:28] amen of God wants to move I say let him
[13:31] move amen let him come on the scene amen
[13:35] stir our hearts change our young people
[13:39] change our middle-aged people amen
[13:42] there should be wear in that season of
[13:45] time amen worthy impossible becomes
[13:48] possible
[13:49] Amen that's where we're at you know Paul
[13:52] said something interesting first
[13:53] Corinthians two verse four and five he
[13:57] said in my speech of my preaching was
[14:00] not with enticing words of man's wisdom
[14:03] but in demonstration of the Spirit and
[14:07] the power that your faith that say my
[14:11] faith say it one more time my faith that
[14:16] your face should not stand in the wisdom
[14:18] of men but in the power of God
[14:21] amen now this church the Corinthian
[14:24] church was as brother Brown said was one
[14:26] of the weakest churches of the time amen
[14:29] all they had in their heart was the
[14:31] elevation of men and different men they
[14:33] were associated with but Paul who was
[14:36] really the gifted man of the day amen
[14:39] he stands before this church and he says
[14:41] my speech of my preaching was not with
[14:43] enticing words in other words there's no
[14:47] place for psychology in this message
[14:49] amen this is not a rehab center but this
[14:53] is a place of deliverance Amen this is
[14:55] where God comes on the scene amen that
[14:58] changes hearts and changes lives
[15:01] hallelujah it's not time to - as Paul
[15:06] just to say well that was really great
[15:08] in and he really had a nice way of
[15:10] putting it I might have some backwards
[15:12] ways but I believe in the power of the
[15:14] Living God amen I believe he changes
[15:17] lives and changes people amen
[15:20] why back in those days that had the same
[15:23] problem they wanted enticing words
[15:25] brother Branham said that and according
[15:28] to the scripture that they had itching
[15:30] ears and he said it was the people that
[15:32] had the itching year so there became
[15:34] ministry in order to fulfill that amen
[15:38] and why Paul is saying that he didn't
[15:40] want our faith to stand in the wisdom of
[15:42] a man but in the power of God amen which
[15:46] is the Dunamis of God amen which is the
[15:50] dynamite of God amen and whenever
[15:52] there's there's power on the scene that
[15:55] supernatural things are going to
[15:57] transpire amen first Corinthians chapter
[16:00] 4 verse 20 it says for the kingdom of
[16:03] God is not in word but in power amen in
[16:07] other words it's not just in the logos
[16:09] but but it's also in power because what
[16:13] good is a word if there's no power
[16:15] behind that word amen if you have
[16:18] something and you can repeat those words
[16:21] and parent those words that may be
[16:24] alright but what we need us we need the
[16:26] power behind it in order to make it
[16:29] living amen we need to have a wineskin
[16:32] as it
[16:33] that's pliable in this hour that can
[16:36] accept the revelation of the word Amen
[16:38] and so that it won't break up all the
[16:40] time Amen I find it very ironic in many
[16:44] places you go in and you start
[16:46] ministering and and the people start
[16:48] getting excited which we should amen and
[16:51] the next thing you know there's some
[16:53] people think minor just disturbing the
[16:55] peace amen
[16:57] I thought that was always another church
[16:59] but but you think it's church what we
[17:01] need to do is let ourselves cool on time
[17:03] amen that God can move in our myths
[17:07] hallelujah amen and not just allow well
[17:11] I don't know why they're getting so
[17:13] excited about that we all just had
[17:15] Thanksgiving how many had pecan pie oh
[17:21] not too many maybe pumpkin pie I got
[17:24] more hands bigger than the pumpkin pie
[17:26] but I'll guarantee they add up before
[17:29] and I tell you what it probably tasted
[17:31] real good before but we never get tired
[17:34] of that
[17:35] Amen I never get tired of the of the
[17:37] Word of God or the power of God hey man
[17:40] why because it changes our lives
[17:42] amen of God's provided that's what I'm
[17:45] interested in changing of lives
[17:47] Amen it's one thing to to feel the
[17:50] anointing of the Lord but I wanted to go
[17:52] down in that inside of the inside amen
[17:55] because if we're not born again we're
[17:57] not getting out of here amen you we got
[18:00] to be born again we've got to be sealed
[18:02] to the day of our destination Amen
[18:06] somebody help me tonight
[18:07] amen we've got to have something down
[18:09] that's in our heart that sealed off the
[18:12] worlds on the outside I'm sealed in with
[18:14] Christ amen no devil and he'll will be
[18:17] able to stand before the child of the
[18:19] Living God amen we've got to be have
[18:22] fortitude about ourselves
[18:26] Amen not just sit back well you know
[18:29] that was a good service today but you
[18:31] know I've heard that probably before and
[18:33] I've heard those quotes before I've
[18:35] heard those things before no it should
[18:37] be just as real is the first time you
[18:39] heard it
[18:40] Amen I'm afraid that people have left
[18:42] their first love
[18:44] a man they forget about the time they
[18:46] came to Christ amen when when God came
[18:49] into your life and change your life a
[18:52] man I never want to forget my first love
[18:54] a man I want to have it tucked inside of
[18:57] my heart amen when God moves I want to
[18:59] be right there and say hallelujah amen
[19:02] to the word of Almighty God amen thank
[19:06] you for allowing me to be myself um if
[19:09] yeah that's okay I'm just gonna be
[19:10] myself tonight
[19:14] God's provide a place of worship 1965
[19:18] paragraph 137 he says now notice and
[19:21] when this great moving power of God
[19:24] comes into a son of God it quickens him
[19:27] the spirit of life enters into him
[19:30] then what does it do it seats them in
[19:33] heavenly places let's say heavenly
[19:36] places tonight amen in other words your
[19:39] you're coming into a spiritual realm
[19:42] amen and when you enter that spiritual
[19:44] realm brother Brown says all things are
[19:46] possible amen we may not see it but we
[19:50] know it's there
[19:50] amen and if we know it's there we just
[19:53] have to enter into that realm amen then
[19:57] if you have need of healing healings for
[19:58] the church amen if you have need of
[20:01] something in your life then it's there
[20:03] for the people amen and you don't have
[20:06] anything to worry about
[20:11] amen right now not they will be we are
[20:15] now in heavenly places amen now we're
[20:19] already resurrected the dynamics and the
[20:23] mechanics is gone to work
[20:26] it's quickening us and we're quickened
[20:29] up into the presence of God where his
[20:31] spirit is and now we are seated together
[20:35] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus in
[20:38] crises are sitting in there that great
[20:41] seat that's already fired up been raised
[20:43] from the dead we're a part of it if
[20:46] you're a part of the bride you are
[20:49] because the bride is a part of the crew
[20:54] amen we're reflection of him amen
[20:58] you are because a bride is part of the
[21:00] groom you know so we find out that's
[21:02] it's the same thing and she'll do just
[21:04] exactly what's predicted for her to do
[21:08] in this day she won't be a lady osya I
[21:12] say no sir I'm not going to be no lady
[21:15] Asiya not by no means a lukewarm no I'm
[21:21] not gonna I mean I'm a man I'm not gonna
[21:23] be no lady of sin and I'm gonna be not a
[21:26] lukewarm person Amen if we can't serve
[21:29] God with passion when I think of what
[21:32] they did on d-day there had to be some
[21:34] passion about them amen they went out
[21:37] there they gave their lives in order
[21:39] that we could have freedom Amen I want
[21:42] to say that the King of Kings and the
[21:43] Lord of lords he came down to earth amen
[21:47] to give his life a ransom a mint that we
[21:50] could go free even it was a passion
[21:52] within him and the least we can do is
[21:55] give him our all of this hour we should
[21:59] be passionate about the things of God
[22:02] amen
[22:03] not just a lukewarm and and just well
[22:07] that was not bad and and just
[22:09] callousness about us amen I mentioned
[22:14] this too I hope this okay tonight but I
[22:17] mentioned this to my to our church back
[22:18] home I said if we're not careful we are
[22:21] we are actually going to get used to the
[22:25] presence of God and before you know it
[22:28] we'll get so used to it then it won't
[22:30] have no effect upon our life no more
[22:32] amen I I want to have a fresh let the
[22:37] holy spirit be fresh every day hey man I
[22:40] don't want to ever get used to well you
[22:42] know that wasn't too bad
[22:43] that wasn't too bad of a song or that
[22:46] wasn't too bad
[22:47] well somebody got healed yes that's what
[22:50] we expect and just lukewarm no I want
[22:52] our passion in this hour
[22:54] amen a passion to serve God a passion to
[22:57] preach the gospel of Jesus Christ amen
[23:00] living and in the in the
[23:02] galatea the Word of God for today amen
[23:06] excuse me for yelling I don't I know
[23:08] you're not deaf but it's just part of me
[23:11] he says she won't be little lady osya
[23:14] and not by no means lukewarm that's one
[23:20] thing I can't stand I cannot stand
[23:22] lukewarm food I can't stand lukewarm
[23:25] water I can't take any of it
[23:28] amen I like this last part but she'll be
[23:32] on fire for God she'll be moving on in
[23:37] the spirit of God amen we are moving on
[23:41] and there'll be people who won't be
[23:44] moving on but the bride's moving on hey
[23:47] I believe we're all part of the bride
[23:48] here today hey man were moving on we
[23:52] live in a generation where powers on the
[23:54] minds of the people have to forgive me
[23:59] actually actually was just what had
[24:02] laryngitis on Wednesday night so so you
[24:05] pray sister Martin was telling me how
[24:08] come you're preaching wins and I said
[24:10] God takes care of it we're living in an
[24:14] age where power is on the people's minds
[24:17] are you going to buy a car
[24:20] I'm mad and they're not there they want
[24:22] to give you some horsepower now hey man
[24:25] they're no longer just 130 150
[24:27] horsepower
[24:28] they're like 350 450 500 800 900 I have
[24:35] to be honest with you I like power amen
[24:38] when I put my foot into it yeah I love
[24:42] it I love the sound of the air coming in
[24:44] I love the sound of the exhaust I
[24:47] there's something about it I love
[24:49] American v8 engines amen a you don't
[24:54] have to pipe into it in that that you
[24:56] hear the sound that's right there it's
[24:58] real a man I maybe didn't know that but
[25:00] some car companies they actually put the
[25:03] v8 sound in the speakers
[25:05] so I think there's a lot of churches a
[25:10] little thing
[25:11] maybe they got no power they're just
[25:13] kind of pumping it into it but it's not
[25:15] really having an effect on the people
[25:17] amen when you put her down it's not
[25:19] going anywhere
[25:20] amen but when it's a real power it's
[25:22] going somewheres amen you put your foot
[25:25] into it it's going somewheres amen
[25:31] but they're speaking about a lot of all
[25:33] power in this generation it's all you
[25:36] hear about is power we can say we've
[25:39] gone from the horse and buggy Age
[25:41] we've gone right to the rock and age but
[25:45] one of the things that I that I'm really
[25:47] intrigued about is that fossil fuel has
[25:50] been our mainly our source of power in
[25:53] in the generation going by but the part
[25:57] that's really coming into effect today
[25:59] is electric power
[26:00] no lecture power is altogether different
[26:03] because it's an instant torque and an
[26:05] instant power amen and and and so now
[26:08] we're finding that they're they're
[26:10] really having an influence on the auto
[26:12] industry where they're they're they're
[26:15] promoting electric cars I'm going
[26:19] someplace with this and and in in that
[26:22] electric car has way more power than a
[26:25] gasoline-powered engine you could put
[26:28] turbochargers on it you could put super
[26:30] charges on it you can put a lot of
[26:32] things on it but all you have to do is
[26:35] have an energy source and just some
[26:37] electric motors and you have instant
[26:39] power amen they got these new cars Tesla
[26:43] most guys know about amaretti and and
[26:45] and they're they're racing against all
[26:47] these super cars and they don't have a
[26:49] chance they don't have a chance but
[26:52] there's something about it that was
[26:53] really interesting to me and this apart
[26:57] that really that really thrilled my
[26:59] heart they have what's called super
[27:01] charging stations when you go to a super
[27:04] charge station because you're getting
[27:07] out of power to me it's like coming to
[27:08] church you need sometimes you get a
[27:11] super charge amen but you know a super
[27:14] charger will only charge up that battery
[27:17] 80
[27:18] in 30 minutes a lot of people that stay
[27:22] they maybe like an 80% charge but if you
[27:24] want a full charge it's gonna take about
[27:26] two or three hours to get a full charge
[27:29] amen and so so sometimes it takes a
[27:32] little bit more to fill it up amen
[27:35] but I say in this hour we want full
[27:37] charge amen we don't just want a apart
[27:40] charge anymore amen it's good to come
[27:42] into the house of the Lord and hear a
[27:44] little sermon and then maybe stir you up
[27:46] for a while but you're gonna lose your
[27:48] energy real quick
[27:49] amen what we need in this hour is a full
[27:51] charge in this hour where God moves on
[27:54] the scene and moves on the life of
[27:56] people and changes our hearts till they
[27:59] believe the Word of God with all their
[28:01] hearts why people are happy just give me
[28:06] a 30 minute sermon after all that's what
[28:09] church order says in one part but
[28:13] another part is that we could preach all
[28:15] night if we were believers electric
[28:22] power we're living in an hour of power
[28:26] what I think about that then I think the
[28:29] church should be moving on to power
[28:31] we've got cordless drills nowadays at
[28:34] and cordless tools and brushless tools
[28:38] that got more power you throw away the
[28:41] old coordinate stuff I also notice that
[28:44] they've come up with these new light
[28:46] bulbs called LED light bulbs we really
[28:50] like them they don't her to use any
[28:52] power at all but you get old way more
[28:55] lumens you get out of any other pole so
[28:59] what's in areas that we should realize
[29:00] that that this is the time for a rapture
[29:03] because if the natural is moving in one
[29:05] way then the Spirit of God has to be
[29:08] moving in another fashion amen and as
[29:11] technology increases they're going as
[29:13] far as they can go
[29:14] amen but there's one thing they can
[29:16] never produce they'll never produce a
[29:18] godly life in the people amen
[29:21] back at home we we have so many places
[29:23] where where people want to go in order
[29:26] to to get help for whatever their
[29:28] problems ails them but they don't want
[29:30] Christ in their life
[29:31] a mitt but what we need us we need Jesus
[29:33] Christ in our lives
[29:34] amen when he turns on the light amen
[29:37] it's gonna scatter all darkness away
[29:39] amen if you're depressed it'll take to
[29:42] oppression away amen if you're an
[29:45] addicted to substance it will take all
[29:47] the dictions away amen if somebody with
[29:50] me tonight Amen why because it's an hour
[29:53] where the power of Almighty God is here
[29:56] like it's never been here before brother
[30:00] Branham says the entire Holy Spirit
[30:02] visits the church in the centime hour
[30:04] amen we're not just under Luther's
[30:06] message no more
[30:07] we need justification but we're moving
[30:10] higher we're no longer just under
[30:13] Wesley's message any more sanctification
[30:15] but we need it amen but we're in an age
[30:19] when there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:22] amen not just sown on the physical man
[30:25] but down inside the heart amen when that
[30:28] starts of moving in a man you never know
[30:30] what God's gonna do I think sometimes
[30:34] people are afraid of it I say we sing
[30:44] that song let go let God have this
[30:45] wonderful way hey man that really means
[30:48] let go hey man when you're not where
[30:51] you're don't worry about who sent beside
[30:53] you who sitting around you but you let
[30:56] go and let God have his wonderful way I
[31:00] believe was in the message on what does
[31:03] the Holy Ghost questions and answers on
[31:05] the Holy Ghost in 1959
[31:07] IV was brother branham's sister that
[31:09] said she fell some that she could jump
[31:11] through the wall and and then she
[31:14] started to doubt and she had brother
[31:16] Browne what should I should have done he
[31:18] said you should have jumped hey man if
[31:23] it's the Holy Ghost telling you the job
[31:24] he's gonna make a hole for you to get
[31:26] through you don't have to worry about
[31:27] hitting anything amen why because what
[31:30] happens is we limit God with our with
[31:33] our carnal mind amen and we're afraid to
[31:37] let him have his way well you know I
[31:40] felt I had a little ailment so I I don't
[31:43] know maybe maybe
[31:44] maybe I'm not healed after all no you're
[31:47] healed well maybe I don't know I still
[31:51] have some of these desires we'll put the
[31:53] devil under your feet
[31:55] amen well sometimes I still do things I
[31:58] shouldn't do on the internet stuff well
[32:00] just go to other places on the Internet
[32:02] amen wait what are you doing you're
[32:05] climbing higher in Christ amen you've
[32:07] got the power in this hour to do it
[32:10] amen brother Brown says we got full
[32:11] power in this hour I say let's put it
[32:14] into practice Church hallelujah we're
[32:19] preaching on full victory and if we're
[32:23] ever gonna help fold victory who we
[32:25] really gonna put it to practice every
[32:27] day
[32:28] amen what shall I do with Jesus called
[32:31] the Christ the dynamics of this church
[32:34] will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit
[32:37] that we have worked in a small measure
[32:40] while the headstone is coming down to
[32:43] unite with the body but when that body
[32:45] unites together are we ready
[32:49] the full power let's say full power the
[32:53] full power of the Holy Ghost would rise
[32:57] raise her up just exactly like that even
[33:00] the dead that's dead in Christ for
[33:02] hundreds of years will rise in the
[33:05] beauty of His Holiness and take a flight
[33:07] to the skies the dynamics is the Holy
[33:10] Spirit amen so we need a mechanics and
[33:13] we meet dynamics is all things you're
[33:15] familiar with but it's what the Lord
[33:17] laid on my heart and and by God's grace
[33:19] I'm trying to put two sermons together
[33:21] yesterday and today so you bear with me
[33:27] amen we should be moving in full power
[33:33] God's only provided place of worship
[33:36] notice anak God's perfect reflection in
[33:40] time when God was through with him he
[33:43] just translated him took him up the
[33:46] mechanic said he had reflected became
[33:48] dynamics with the spirit and took him up
[33:52] amen
[33:53] has it been said many times we can
[33:56] polish hubs all we want
[33:59] amen I remember my grandfather he had he
[34:03] had an old car in the bush and you know
[34:07] it's what they used to do on the farm
[34:08] they'd get a car and they never sold
[34:10] them they just parked him in the trees
[34:13] and it didn't take very long the whole
[34:15] thing start deteriorating but I can
[34:18] remember as a child growing up man we
[34:21] get in that car we can make all the
[34:25] noise coming back to cars again and we
[34:29] make all the noise and we do pretend
[34:32] were putting it in gear but when we got
[34:35] out of the car we hadn't gone anywhere
[34:38] hope your spiritual tonight Amen we
[34:44] should be going someplace Amen it's not
[34:47] vain we gather together amen we're going
[34:51] someplace
[34:52] anyway we got a body change to take a
[34:55] man I'm still on a body change still in
[34:58] this hour because I still believe I'm
[35:00] gonna be changed with all my heart a man
[35:03] I still have my picture sitting on our
[35:05] on our credenza in the in our bedroom a
[35:07] man I always say I don't want to be
[35:09] shocked when we're gonna look at when
[35:11] I'm changed because one day I'm going to
[35:14] look in the mirror and I'm gonna be
[35:15] changed Amen why because the dynamics of
[35:18] McCann is going to come together amen
[35:20] it's gonna change us in our mortal body
[35:23] amen and we're gonna be walking up until
[35:26] that point just like Enoch walked a
[35:28] minute one day he just was not he met
[35:31] this church is going to take a rapture
[35:33] amen I don't know if you ever heard that
[35:35] before but I'll tell you again the
[35:37] Church of the Living God
[35:39] University is going to take a rapture
[35:41] amen and there's going to be many
[35:42] members in the body of Christ
[35:44] universally who's going to make up that
[35:46] rapture and they will be ready and the
[35:52] ones that aren't ready well I guess
[35:54] they're just not coming along amen so I
[35:57] recommend let's get ready amen that's
[36:00] why we we're in full victory it's not
[36:04] just words we're saying I'm not just
[36:06] saying things here to make you feel good
[36:08] I'm saying things because I believe this
[36:10] with all my heart
[36:11] amen I'm looking forward to that time
[36:14] and for that hour a man I'm living for
[36:17] him I'm starting to get Dre here super
[36:21] of the run no I'm not dying him yet
[36:27] either
[36:27] but and I'm not planning to do that but
[36:30] I'm looking forward brother Verne so we
[36:32] get all black headed again or whatever
[36:34] color here it was it's coming when the
[36:40] dynamics and mechanics start working
[36:42] something's gonna happen
[36:45] amen God's gonna well it's the people I
[36:49] believe it's the people holding it back
[36:53] why am i gates organized religion now we
[36:57] are active in the things from above now
[36:59] the spirit Minds the word that to me is
[37:02] always a key statement just for a moment
[37:05] here the spirit in a person's life Minds
[37:09] the Word of God amen sometimes the
[37:13] people hear the word and they actually
[37:15] don't appreciate it when we should
[37:17] appreciate it
[37:18] I'd rather it skin me alive down here
[37:21] than miss it on that day amen and the
[37:24] Bible says the spirit minds the word in
[37:28] other words if the spirit and you is the
[37:30] same spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[37:32] amen
[37:33] then that spirit in you is gonna mine
[37:35] the word just like he minded the word
[37:38] amen because remember church this bride
[37:41] of Jesus Christ is a reflection of him
[37:43] upon the earth right now
[37:45] amen she is just like him in every point
[37:49] amen and he's got full confidence in his
[37:52] bride amen that the bride is going to
[37:54] mine the word that's why Jesus said that
[37:57] that I do nothing but what the father
[37:59] shows me amen and everything he did was
[38:02] according to the word amen
[38:04] this bride is going to be according to
[38:06] the word she's gonna walk in step of the
[38:08] composer in this hour according to the
[38:11] Word of God when the Word of God says
[38:13] move she's going to move when the Word
[38:15] of God said stop she's going to stop
[38:17] when the Word of God said speak she's
[38:19] gonna speak amen the way the Word of God
[38:21] says be silent she's going to be silent
[38:24] she's gonna be just 100% and harmony
[38:27] let's say harmony tonight in harmony
[38:31] with the Word of God that's why it says
[38:34] in first gen in Chapter John John 1 in
[38:37] the beginning was the word of the Word
[38:39] was with God in the word was gone
[38:41] amen so that little word became a living
[38:44] reality amen it's one thing to have the
[38:47] groom as the living reality one thing to
[38:49] have Christ as our living reality but
[38:52] now he wants his bride to be that living
[38:54] reality amen that that bride will
[38:57] manifest Jesus Christ I was like the
[39:02] quote in the church his book that the
[39:03] bride has thus sayeth the Lord in her
[39:05] right now but she stands still until she
[39:09] knows what he wants done with it he
[39:11] meant so the bride is never going to be
[39:13] moving ahead of the groom but the bride
[39:17] is going to be walking in step with the
[39:19] crew amen in order that Christ can be
[39:22] manifested in the way he wants to be in
[39:25] each one of our lives because the Spirit
[39:30] that's living within us Minds the Word
[39:32] of God amen
[39:34] because the Spirit gives the word life
[39:36] the letter kills but the Spirit gives it
[39:39] life amen
[39:42] now I really believe in The Libertines
[39:44] and the Church of the Living God you
[39:48] know brother Branham said some things
[39:49] about Canada that then you know you want
[39:53] to just kind of closure he said they
[39:58] were mas packed I made a determination
[40:02] how I'm gonna be moss backed I don't
[40:05] care what any other people saying I
[40:07] believe the Spirit of God should be
[40:09] moving amen no some people say these
[40:12] words and they say well you shouldn't
[40:14] jump any higher than then then you live
[40:18] I've heard that all my life I grew up on
[40:21] the message in 1966 I was five years old
[40:24] my mum my dad cubies came to the church
[40:27] message the first time all I know is
[40:29] this message Amen I heard that chord so
[40:32] many times that you that you got to
[40:34] memorize but I
[40:36] cata why don't we start living higher so
[40:39] we can keep jumping higher Amen people
[40:43] are so afraid that things are going to
[40:45] get out of out of hand in the church I
[40:47] say I'm not afraid of anything getting
[40:50] out of hand
[40:51] amen but people say well we just wanna
[40:54] we just want to feed on the word but you
[40:56] know when you feed the ox or you feed a
[40:58] calf something in a stall and you feed
[41:00] him or something good nutrition you put
[41:03] him outside he's gonna kick up his heels
[41:05] and he's gonna run around and he's gonna
[41:08] have a great old time why there's some
[41:10] vitamins in him doing it I'm afraid too
[41:13] many calves are actually being served to
[41:15] death in this hour there's nothing in
[41:18] him to actually respond to the word Amen
[41:22] that's the truth church amen we should
[41:26] have such a desire to respond back when
[41:31] we see we on he's gonna tell me one more
[41:33] time I should say Amen I'm not gonna say
[41:35] it and you know what you just lost your
[41:39] blessing amen I'm at home came three
[41:49] days I can't even say it was sixteen
[41:53] hours any more is more like 40 hours to
[41:55] get here we we have to we need to allow
[42:02] brother Brown sitters maybe the church
[42:03] needs to get on a word on one time
[42:05] everybody gets saved Amen so that so
[42:08] that the people actually have Christ
[42:11] come into their lives amen
[42:13] puts a smile in everybody's face as much
[42:14] possible amen we still sing a song
[42:19] smiling I'll give your face or rastenn
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:25] takes less muscles to smile than from
[42:27] you know that's for free tonight eaten
[42:32] maybe I should just keep looking down
[42:34] here
[42:36] you know it's just the truth Church hey
[42:40] I hope you still love me when we're done
[42:41] here tonight
[42:43] amen but we need to express ourselves I
[42:46] know you hear these things but I just
[42:48] feel that the same again
[42:49] Amen we need to express ourselves we
[42:52] need to to allow Christ to move amen
[42:55] because just our attitude sometimes our
[42:58] spirit can actually hinder somebody from
[43:00] getting healed amen and so if we come to
[43:03] the house of God we should come in such
[43:05] an in such a manner where we're we're
[43:07] prayed up we have an expectation amen
[43:11] and then when we sit in the house of the
[43:13] Lord we're praying Lord meet my need
[43:16] but father meet the people's needs amen
[43:19] and I never want to be a stumbling block
[43:21] between before any person Amen but I
[43:24] want to be able to to have such an
[43:26] attitude in the house of God that if
[43:29] it's not for me that night it's for
[43:31] somebody else on name Amen that they
[43:33] wouldn't receive their blessing and that
[43:35] I would be hindered that blessing but I
[43:37] love my life to be a conduit that the
[43:39] Holy Ghost can come on the scene and
[43:41] move through hallelujah blessed be the
[43:45] name of the Lord a minister see it's
[43:48] just yielding yourself to him it's not
[43:51] hard to do it's the sacrifice amen I
[43:56] believe that we need Libertines amen I
[43:59] also believe that that we can jump and
[44:02] shout but if there's no life to go with
[44:04] it and there's no point I say let's get
[44:06] the life giver in the heart amen let's
[44:09] have church amen this is the age where
[44:14] we need a personal experience with Jesus
[44:16] Christ amen we need something that that
[44:19] seals us to the D ever destination
[44:21] something that that's got everything put
[44:23] in its order I believe it all my heart
[44:28] amen I believe the church is moving up
[44:31] in that power amen
[44:33] where Christ means is our everything I'm
[44:37] it's not just on Sunday morning or
[44:38] Sunday night or or Saturday night amen
[44:42] but it's Monday morning it's Monday
[44:45] night
[44:46] it's Tuesday morning it's Tuesday night
[44:49] amen it makes you love your husband more
[44:52] properly it makes you love your your
[44:55] wife in the right way
[44:56] ain't mentor puts a unity in the home
[44:58] that the children can actually see
[45:00] Christ moving amongst the parents amen
[45:03] it causes an atmosphere to transpire
[45:06] amen where you don't have to pray up in
[45:08] the vehicle refer you come into church
[45:10] amen but there's already something
[45:12] that's already transpiring because it's
[45:15] already happening in the home amen but
[45:23] we sometimes we I don't know why I'm
[45:26] here but I'm here sometimes we fight
[45:29] like cats and dogs and then we expect
[45:31] God to move that's not how he moves the
[45:36] devil's not sleeping he knows how to
[45:38] push our buttons amen
[45:42] that was another one for free I don't
[45:46] know why I said that but I said I came
[45:48] alone
[45:49] choosing over bride now you see you're
[45:53] putting on something that isn't real you
[45:57] can't get warm by a painted fire like
[46:00] some of those churches trying to paint
[46:02] Pentecost
[46:03] you know I'll finish this quote me Oh
[46:06] sister Maura likes those those I'm sorry
[46:10] but over there honey she likes those
[46:13] electric fireplace things that you hang
[46:15] on a wall that looked like it reflect
[46:17] like it's a fireplace and they're even
[46:20] moving though it's not even just painted
[46:22] anymore they make the thing look I guess
[46:23] real I can't stand them have to be
[46:28] honest with you I I said she said oh
[46:30] there's not look nice as and I guess in
[46:32] the eyes of the beholder is there but to
[46:34] me it's the fakest thing you've ever saw
[46:36] I said why do i why do I want to have
[46:39] something I put on the wall that you
[46:41] plug into electrical outlet and oh my
[46:44] that's a real nice fire it's not a fire
[46:45] amen it's just it's a it's something
[46:48] that's not real amen and that's what
[46:51] brother Brown is saying some churches
[46:52] try to paint penny cause later they've
[46:55] got a painted fire amen are they they
[46:58] come in and they say they're all men
[46:59] it's just right
[47:00] they say everything just right and and
[47:01] and and at the end of the service it's
[47:03] just paints is this there's nothing
[47:04] about Amen we we don't want no painted
[47:08] fire Amen we want the real fire I am and
[47:11] I say Lord for ain't out on the people
[47:13] amen let your spirit fall on the people
[47:17] hallelujah
[47:19] let it fall he see you can't get warmed
[47:24] by paint a fire and I'll say this you're
[47:26] never gonna get the Holy Ghost by
[47:27] painting a fire either Amen too much
[47:29] painted fires in the pulpit ain't been
[47:32] oral they're only portraying something
[47:34] they don't even believe themselves amen
[47:36] they they preach about something they
[47:38] don't have any clue what they're talking
[47:39] about they just got an ability to search
[47:42] on a computer Amen I say they don't make
[47:44] them preachers because they got a
[47:45] computer
[47:46] Amen you got to have an experience with
[47:48] God Amen something that's it that's in
[47:51] your heart
[47:51] Amen how can you after 40 years say
[47:54] there's nothing to the message and
[47:55] preaching all your life I say that's
[47:57] absolutely impossible
[47:58] there was nothing in their life to begin
[48:00] with a man there just had a peanut fire
[48:03] experience Amen but when there's a real
[48:05] fire of Almighty God and he comes down
[48:08] on the scene Amen it changes lives
[48:11] that's why the church is so lukewarm
[48:14] that's why the church can move on in
[48:16] power amen because they're just painting
[48:19] the fire that's one reason why I can't
[48:22] handle them I just can't stand on my I
[48:23] told sister Mar would never put one of
[48:25] those in our house we're not doing that
[48:28] I want something that's real it's like
[48:31] plastic plants and I know we autumn -
[48:33] you guys got home - I can't hardly
[48:35] handle plastic town plants there's
[48:39] nothing to them you don't have to do
[48:40] nothing looks the same every service
[48:42] that's like some people they don't
[48:44] change at all every service they still
[48:46] look like a plastic plant
[48:48] there's nothing about in their heart
[48:50] that change Amen they're just a piece of
[48:52] plastic amen when the Holy Ghost should
[48:55] be raining down in this hour and
[48:57] changing lives aim
[49:02] hallelujah amen work we should be done
[49:07] with all the facades and all of that
[49:09] stuff that's not real
[49:10] amen people come in a house of the Lord
[49:13] and it's not real in their heart I say
[49:15] they need another good old-fashioned
[49:18] gospel burning down at the altar where
[49:21] Christ comes into their lives and
[49:22] changes our hearts hallelujah
[49:28] that's enough paint amen that's why they
[49:33] call that manicure brother Brown called
[49:35] it manicure they got to paint himself up
[49:37] it's not real aim it just looked the
[49:40] same all the time no change
[49:44] amen we need to change from glory to
[49:48] glory amen he's changing us every
[49:51] service I mean like I said in the
[49:54] beginning we may not think we're
[49:55] changing but if we're really eating this
[49:57] word a menace to it's changing us a mint
[50:02] from glory to glory we may not see it on
[50:04] the outside but something's happen on
[50:06] the inside and eventually it's gonna be
[50:08] portrayed on the outside
[50:11] that's when Christ gets into our lives a
[50:14] minute it changes us so we can dress
[50:17] right we can do everything right but if
[50:19] in our hearts we're still wanted to be
[50:21] like the world then we're just being
[50:23] Apia this basically right over here
[50:25] something that's not real amen we're
[50:28] just being a Pharisee amen but when
[50:31] Christ comes in the inside hallelujah
[50:33] amen it gives you love it gives you joy
[50:38] it gives you peace it gives you
[50:42] long-suffering
[50:44] it portrays Christ not a painted fire
[50:49] something real brother Branham says here
[50:53] he said he said like some of these
[50:55] churches trying to paint Pentecost and
[50:57] he's not speaking of of organization he
[51:01] speaking of 2000 years ago or something
[51:04] that happened a thousand two thousand
[51:05] you can't get warm by paying a fire
[51:07] penny cost let's say Pentecost
[51:11] hope it's okay if a guy uses that word
[51:13] here some churches that's not because
[51:19] they think their their mind always goes
[51:20] organization amen but penny costs its
[51:25] really to believe amen
[51:28] it's it's you can go free you're no
[51:31] longer bound to sin you're no longer
[51:33] bound to the world you're no longer
[51:36] bound to anything like that you can go
[51:38] free you Christ I think that's why the
[51:42] devil trying to hoodwink to people
[51:48] Pentecost is just as real today as it
[51:51] was then see he says the fire won't like
[51:55] that
[51:56] the fire is still falling amen he's
[51:59] fallen here tonight too
[52:01] and in a pan of fire it's a real fire a
[52:04] man I believe that so we have some real
[52:06] fire watching his star lady 59 he said
[52:15] me I say tonight that God has assigned
[52:17] today it's a sign of his spirit that
[52:20] word Jesus is there's life for his life
[52:26] where Jesus is there's gospel light for
[52:30] he is the lane where Jesus is oh this is
[52:34] good there's fire Amen for he is a
[52:39] consuming fire that burns up all your
[52:43] unbelief and your dross hey man I say
[52:47] Lord let's burn up some unbelief amen
[52:50] let's burn up some dross amen
[52:55] 19:49 see brother Brown believe this all
[52:58] of his life he said the other night
[53:01] where we were sitting
[53:03] thousands deep in there there was a big
[53:05] mess of a big convention and all of them
[53:08] clapping their hands and praising God we
[53:12] just had such a glorious time we had
[53:15] fire right on the altar then oh my I
[53:19] read that I thought I thought
[53:21] just done something for me amen people
[53:24] want to sit on their hands and they
[53:25] don't want to respond to the Word of God
[53:28] amen
[53:29] yeah they're just not allowing the fire
[53:31] of God to move on the scene
[53:34] amen preach on brother Kelly I'm gonna
[53:37] to go - to that - amen
[53:41] yeah probably you've heard this quote a
[53:43] lot of times but I'm gonna read it again
[53:45] it's the rising of the Sun there's been
[53:48] churches churches and brides brides and
[53:50] churches and Brides prize but there has
[53:52] got to come one amen brother Branham
[53:56] says hallelujah amen so it meant
[53:58] something to him amen because he knew
[54:01] there was going to come a church I was
[54:03] going to have full victory hema not just
[54:06] a partial victory amen but full victory
[54:09] aim in a church that would rise up in
[54:12] power amen why because the power of the
[54:15] Resurrection is in her amen if she had
[54:18] rise in power amen in an illumination to
[54:22] the things of the Lord amen and there
[54:24] would be nothing let's say nothing
[54:26] tonight there would be nothing that
[54:28] would stand in her way
[54:29] not one devil in hell can stand in front
[54:32] of the pride of Jesus Christ she has got
[54:36] full authority over the power of
[54:38] darkness hallelujah you know sometimes
[54:44] you people wonder well what about the
[54:47] devil I said what about him what about
[54:51] him
[54:52] well people are getting sick well
[54:55] brother Brown says he says that's no
[54:57] problem
[54:57] he says just call the elders of the
[55:00] church and cast the devil off amen and I
[55:04] always look at if you ever gonna have
[55:06] testimonies there's gonna be some people
[55:08] that are good that are gonna get sick
[55:11] amen I'm a living witness of that even I
[55:14] was sick for a lot of years I still
[55:17] struggle with my my health but all I
[55:18] want to say tonight at 58 years old I
[55:21] feel stronger than I felt for many years
[55:23] amen and I can tell you that Christ is a
[55:26] healer he's a savior amen he helps in
[55:30] all aspects of
[55:32] but if you never got sick there'd be no
[55:36] testimonies so God has confidence we
[55:43] don't understand it we didn't understand
[55:46] it when our son-in-law passed away but
[55:49] God had a plan
[55:51] amen and he makes everything beautiful
[55:53] in his own time amen sometimes we we see
[55:57] things happen in our lives and we think
[55:58] well it's only for the next person but
[56:00] sometimes it gets personal to us amen
[56:04] and what's God trying to do he's got
[56:06] confidence in you because he knows
[56:08] you're gonna stand the test who quarry
[56:11] to God amen and you're gonna stand the
[56:13] test and you're gonna be a serpent
[56:15] bruiser because no devil should stand in
[56:20] her way
[56:24] hallelujah
[56:26] somebody say praise the Lord
[56:29] he said there's got to come a real bride
[56:31] I believe that
[56:33] hallelujah there's part of it right down
[56:35] here in the Shenandoah Valley amen is
[56:38] one of the most beautiful places I've
[56:39] ever been brother Ron is here in the
[56:41] Shenandoah Valley sister Mara myself we
[56:44] talk all the time he said there's no
[56:46] place like this place Amen we take them
[56:48] to our dump up in northern Canada called
[56:51] elk roots and things like that but it's
[56:53] a nice place too but Shantanu a valley
[56:55] is beautiful
[56:57] Eamon I wondered how come the Lord put
[56:59] me there and you here too and wonder
[57:01] that sometimes but here we are you're
[57:03] here and I'm up there amen but we're
[57:06] supposed to be amen but there's gonna
[57:10] come a real bride a man I'm part of that
[57:16] Amen we're collectively all part of that
[57:19] Brian Amy but we're not going anywhere
[57:21] until we're all ready to go whether it's
[57:24] in Saskatoon or whether it's in Africa
[57:26] or Asia wherever it is amen when we're
[57:28] all ready to go we're all gonna go
[57:32] there's gonna come a real bride there
[57:34] must come one that's not got the
[57:37] mechanics I like that but the dynamics
[57:40] of it makes that church live moving the
[57:43] power of his resurrection until we come
[57:45] to a play to that place until we find
[57:48] that place what good does it do to
[57:49] polish the hubs and good does it do give
[57:52] her a facelift or or a Simon izing job
[57:55] when there's no dynamics in it no matter
[57:59] how much the mechanics proved to be
[58:00] right there has got to be dynamics to
[58:03] make it work
[58:06] amen I could sit in that car all day
[58:09] long on my grandfather's house it didn't
[58:12] go anywhere I could polish that hood
[58:15] until there was no paint left on that
[58:17] hood his someone going any worse further
[58:21] down he says until that church becomes
[58:23] dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of
[58:25] God that moved him to do the same thing
[58:27] he did if he if he hit on 16 cylinders
[58:31] so will the brine amen for he said in
[58:34] Saint John 14:12 he that believeth on me
[58:37] the works that I do shall he do also
[58:39] I'll give him a charge of my dynamics
[58:43] hallelujah this is your power
[58:46] Amen what we need is a charge from the
[58:48] unction from the Holy One I say send it
[58:51] down Lord and give a good charge right
[58:53] now
[58:53] amen give a charge to the people right
[58:56] now hallelujah glory to God give the
[59:02] charge of the dynamics into the
[59:05] mechanics that the world will not be
[59:08] able to withstand it and erase him up
[59:10] again in the last days aim in other
[59:13] words will be a manifestation of him
[59:14] that's the Easter message the dynamics
[59:17] of mechanics together the mechanics are
[59:19] those two dynamics no good neither the
[59:21] dynamics to those of mechanics you can
[59:24] scream and shout and jump up and down
[59:26] all you want to and deny is word or do
[59:28] you
[59:28] good you're just cranking around on the
[59:30] Pistons got to get the spark that a fire
[59:32] no gasoline to fire it it'll only work
[59:34] as they come together amen so one will
[59:38] sit still and one will go up that's the
[59:41] only thing there is that there is to it
[59:43] yet excuse me
[59:47] it will move into them and I just forgot
[59:49] I lost my spot here that's the
[59:51] resurrection that's the real power of
[59:53] God Mike in mechanics with dynamics it's
[59:55] the spirit that quickens it's the spark
[59:58] that fires it's not the gas that fires
[1:00:00] it's the spark that fires the gas amen
[1:00:05] we some spark amen fire what's in our
[1:00:08] hearts amen
[1:00:09] you can do nothing without me but with
[1:00:11] me you can do all things
[1:00:13] amen let's say all things tonight Amen
[1:00:16] with Christ you can do all things even
[1:00:19] those are just words that's the reality
[1:00:22] that's the truth as a father has fired
[1:00:28] me and pushed me into everything I do
[1:00:29] only that which is pleasing to God now
[1:00:33] as he sent me so send I you with the
[1:00:35] same mechanics and it takes the same
[1:00:37] dynamics to operate it and these signs
[1:00:40] that say these signs shall follow them
[1:00:43] that claim to have the mechanics that
[1:00:46] dynamics will take its place Paul said
[1:00:49] the gospel came not to us and word only
[1:00:51] in other words through gasoline-only
[1:00:54] Amen so we need the word we need the
[1:00:59] spirit amen the letter kills but the
[1:01:02] Spirit is gonna give a life amen and
[1:01:05] when the Spirit gives a life something's
[1:01:07] gonna happen amen when he says we were
[1:01:09] just gonna move amen victory day I
[1:01:15] cannot just a few more moments of that
[1:01:17] would be okay he said now we ascended on
[1:01:20] high and he give gifts back to men
[1:01:22] what was it sores he put swords in their
[1:01:25] hand the word c2 clunker oh my he give
[1:01:28] them sores what for the word to conquer
[1:01:31] what sicknesses sins superstitions evil
[1:01:34] to bring every living creature that
[1:01:37] wants to live bring every one of them to
[1:01:39] the realization that
[1:01:41] because I live you live also we have the
[1:01:44] faith we have the fight of faith let us
[1:01:47] fight amen complete our victory for our
[1:01:51] complete victory is positive amen let's
[1:01:56] say positive to name say it one more
[1:01:58] time positive that means there's no
[1:02:01] negative Amen if it's positive all the
[1:02:05] time Amen then we're positive all the
[1:02:07] time
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:12] glory to God hey man I I don't like
[1:02:16] being negative if I am sister Marta has
[1:02:19] to deal with me and that she tells me
[1:02:22] you supposed to be positive
[1:02:23] it's preach the other night you supposed
[1:02:24] to be positive amen thank the good Lord
[1:02:31] for sister Myra amen why because we
[1:02:36] should it be negative negative cause uh
[1:02:39] causes dome Amen doubt takes us away
[1:02:43] from the word Amy butter for positive it
[1:02:46] moves us into the word Amen that it just
[1:02:49] takes a little unction from the Holy One
[1:02:50] to make that word come alive he says
[1:02:53] here he says complete victory is
[1:02:55] positive it's sure it's got to be Amen
[1:02:59] we have the firstfruits of it we have
[1:03:01] the evidence of it in our heart now
[1:03:03] because we have already got the first
[1:03:05] battle behind us we have been able to
[1:03:08] conquer through the faith I love that
[1:03:10] through the faith of Jesus Christ we had
[1:03:13] a victory day amen
[1:03:15] god knows what concerns each one of us
[1:03:17] today no matter what it would be he
[1:03:21] knows what your burdens are he knows
[1:03:22] what your fear is amen he knows what
[1:03:26] your health condition is amen he knows
[1:03:29] what your financial situation is amen he
[1:03:33] knows every part about our lives he
[1:03:37] knows her uprising he knows our down
[1:03:38] settings amen
[1:03:40] but he chose us for a reason amen he
[1:03:44] chose us because he loved us amen and if
[1:03:47] he loved us then he's going to supply
[1:03:49] everything we have need up for this
[1:03:51] life's journey
[1:03:52] amen he's going to give us some
[1:03:54] mechanics he's gonna give us dynamics
[1:03:56] amen he's gonna give us a positive
[1:03:58] outlook amen he's gonna give us his
[1:04:01] spirit you know III was speaking back
[1:04:10] home a few weeks ago and in Exodus the
[1:04:14] pillar of fire was with the children of
[1:04:16] Israel every day cloud was with them
[1:04:21] daytime pillar of fire by night they saw
[1:04:23] in every single day got common to him
[1:04:26] though they could get out of their tent
[1:04:30] in the morning they could look in the
[1:04:33] beginning I bet you they'd done it crawl
[1:04:36] Oh is he still there yeah he's still
[1:04:37] there but after a year or so all of a
[1:04:41] sudden they were looking anymore they
[1:04:49] just they just say and and I I think
[1:04:53] Laura do you you know all about my
[1:04:55] situations in life and you know as long
[1:04:59] as were in this life we're gonna have
[1:05:00] problems we're always gonna have there's
[1:05:05] gonna be something happening sometimes
[1:05:07] people say I had a brother tell me this
[1:05:10] the other days I don't know what's
[1:05:11] happened to us my wife just got sick and
[1:05:15] why us we live we live good lives we
[1:05:17] live a good Christian lives and why is
[1:05:19] it happening to us and and I was sitting
[1:05:21] back there and I was trying to help the
[1:05:23] brother in a certain way because it's
[1:05:26] it's if something comes your way is
[1:05:28] because you found favor with God amen we
[1:05:32] we look at it sometimes in such a
[1:05:33] negative way instead of a positive way
[1:05:35] when we should be looking at it if God
[1:05:38] has something for me that means he's
[1:05:40] going to give me the strength to come
[1:05:43] through it amen he wants to see how I'm
[1:05:47] going to react to it how you're going to
[1:05:49] react to it
[1:05:50] amen and as long as there's a devil he's
[1:05:53] going to create problems amen
[1:05:55] but I say that greater is He that's in
[1:05:57] me that he that's in the world
[1:05:59] amen greater is He that's in you than he
[1:06:01] that's in the world
[1:06:03] that's why brother rose
[1:06:05] what do we have to fear then a menu
[1:06:07] could be you could be perfect health and
[1:06:10] be sick you may did not even know you're
[1:06:12] sick and you get a doctor's report in
[1:06:16] the doctor report oh my this is looking
[1:06:18] pretty bad right here oh my goodness
[1:06:19] look at this report and that's when our
[1:06:24] hearts have to go well Lord you promised
[1:06:28] me amen
[1:06:30] then I should be in good health and so
[1:06:33] Lord I'm gonna take this promise and
[1:06:35] tuck it in my script peg I'm gonna let
[1:06:37] gonna chew on this scripture every day
[1:06:39] and thank you for my healing amen if
[1:06:42] you're depressed and and you don't know
[1:06:44] what to do with yourself you it seems
[1:06:46] like you just can't seemingly pull out
[1:06:47] of it you gotta just put it on there
[1:06:49] that Lord you promised me to have a
[1:06:51] sound mind amen
[1:06:55] I'm gonna tell you church you're going
[1:06:56] to get a sound mind amen it's not mind
[1:06:59] over matter
[1:07:00] what you're doing is repeating back his
[1:07:02] word to him and his word can never fail
[1:07:06] his word is yeah amen
[1:07:09] his word will never fail Amen it has
[1:07:12] never failed one time in this generation
[1:07:14] it will never fail his word is true amen
[1:07:22] it'll never fail I can't feel he knows
[1:07:32] what concerns us sometimes you just may
[1:07:37] be trying to show us something
[1:07:41] sometimes we we don't look deep enough
[1:07:44] always like what David said Lord you
[1:07:46] look into my own heart Lord I don't
[1:07:48] trust my own evaluation in my own heart
[1:07:51] and because we we evaluate ourselves a
[1:07:55] certain way but God maybe value it's a
[1:07:56] different way amen and it doesn't mean I
[1:08:00] I have a brush on sometimes people at
[1:08:02] home they hear certain things and they
[1:08:04] think oh like I'm never gonna be able to
[1:08:07] live a Christian life I say you know why
[1:08:09] do we want to thank those things amen if
[1:08:12] he saved me then he's gonna keep me if
[1:08:14] he saved you he's gonna keep you
[1:08:17] he didn't save you to lose you a man he
[1:08:20] saved you to keep you but he's gonna try
[1:08:24] our faith I'm gonna say we're gonna come
[1:08:29] out like like gold that's shining in in
[1:08:32] its brilliance amen
[1:08:36] there's been this uh message on love he
[1:08:40] said to think that perfect love casts
[1:08:42] out all fear a minute does church Eamon

[1:08:51] oh I'm a backslide tomorrow I'm a
[1:08:54] backslide next week I wouldn't worry
[1:08:55] about that
[1:08:58] amen somebody say praise the Lord he
[1:09:01] said I'm not trying to hold on he held
[1:09:04] on for me and he put a love in my heart
[1:09:07] that holds there it's him holding me not
[1:09:10] me holding him if it was me holding him
[1:09:13] I'd probably turn loose glory but as
[1:09:16] long as he's holding me we will never
[1:09:18] turn loose he promised he would and I'll
[1:09:21] never leave you nor forsake you amen
[1:09:23] amen he's the one that's holding on a
[1:09:25] many snatcher gonna turn loose he's
[1:09:29] holding on what gives me this victory is
[1:09:34] Christ he's the one that gives me this
[1:09:37] victory Amen he's the victorious one
[1:09:41] amen he conquered death hell and the
[1:09:43] grave Amen every demon power was
[1:09:47] conquered when he said it is finished it
[1:09:50] was finished
[1:09:54] it's still finished today amen we're
[1:10:00] studying the church age book at Holman
[1:10:02] and we're just on this one part and and
[1:10:05] and I've just felt to share it with you
[1:10:07] because it's to me it's so beautiful is
[1:10:10] that that he chose you for his bride he
[1:10:13] chose me for his bride amen he says here
[1:10:17] he said now without getting too involved
[1:10:19] in the subject to the sovereignty of God
[1:10:20] let me point out here that according to
[1:10:23] this verses Jesus Christ is choosing his
[1:10:25] own bride hey man I feel so good about
[1:10:28] that amen because I
[1:10:31] chose myself a me but he chose me he
[1:10:35] chose you a man if that doesn't make you
[1:10:37] excited I don't know what's gonna make
[1:10:39] you excited Amen when the King of Kings
[1:10:41] came and chose you
[1:10:43] hey man it's brother Brown preached in
[1:10:45] the door on the door he said if you
[1:10:47] heard a knock on the door and it was a
[1:10:49] queen of England standing there
[1:10:50] you'd feel so you'd wonder why why my
[1:10:55] host why would she come to my house man
[1:10:57] you'd open up the door you probably tidy
[1:10:59] or maybe a bit first but you'd open up
[1:11:00] the door let her get in you put her down
[1:11:03] you'd make her tea you do something and
[1:11:06] then brother Brahim said what if the
[1:11:07] President of the United States would
[1:11:09] knock on your door even if you don't
[1:11:11] like him you think my this is an honor
[1:11:13] why would he come to my place amen but
[1:11:16] to think Church from the king of kings
[1:11:19] hallelujah when the King of Kings came
[1:11:21] by your way a man he said I'm gonna
[1:11:24] choose you to be my bride a man he chose
[1:11:26] you for a purpose even he said I'm gonna
[1:11:29] put you in my bride Oh Lord
[1:11:33] whoo and I think about that I got
[1:11:37] already know what to do with myself
[1:11:38] hey man you feel like jumping you feel
[1:11:41] like shouting hey man you feel like
[1:11:43] being a little Pentecostal hey man you
[1:11:45] you just you just something Wells up in
[1:11:47] your heart I want a system are she would
[1:11:52] marry me I'll tell you what her hurt
[1:11:53] jumped a few beats to oh yeah did I
[1:11:57] remember that time but to think of the
[1:12:01] King of Kings hey man he said I'm
[1:12:04] choosing you hey man look at your
[1:12:08] neighbor to say he chose you hey man he
[1:12:11] chose you to be in the brine amen he
[1:12:14] chose you you said me yeah you well I'm
[1:12:19] nothing but he chose you I don't deserve
[1:12:22] it but he chose you amen why because he
[1:12:26] wants to show his victory for your life
[1:12:28] amen he wants to show himself through
[1:12:30] your life and he said I'm gonna come
[1:12:32] right down here show - I adore Valley
[1:12:34] and choose you who Corey - God Alleluia
[1:12:40] makes you wanna walk a little lighter
[1:12:41] because he chose me in this house
[1:12:44] to be part of that bride he was going to
[1:12:48] choose someone but he chose you chose
[1:12:52] you to be part of the bride brother Bram
[1:12:57] said just like a man I think it's still
[1:13:00] in style today I know some place maybe
[1:13:02] maybe it's a women that are trying to
[1:13:04] choose who they're gonna marry from that
[1:13:06] standpoint they call them the guys up
[1:13:08] but I think it's still in style that a
[1:13:10] husband or a man calls you understand
[1:13:16] what I'm saying with social media today
[1:13:19] we've kind of put these little feelers
[1:13:21] okay with her but brother Branham says
[1:13:26] here he said Jesus Christ choosing his
[1:13:28] own bride just the same as a man chooses
[1:13:30] their bride today the bride today's does
[1:13:33] not simply decide she is going to take
[1:13:35] us her mana for husband no sir it is the
[1:13:37] groom let's say the groom the groom who
[1:13:40] decides and chooses her woman for his
[1:13:43] bride Saint John 1560 you have not
[1:13:46] chosen me but I've chosen you amen so in
[1:13:50] the devil tells you you're not worthy
[1:13:51] you can tell him that's right but he
[1:13:52] chose me anyhow hey man sometimes we
[1:13:56] don't feel worthy ain't me buddy chose
[1:13:58] you anyhow
[1:13:59] amen I don't feel worthy but he chose me
[1:14:02] anyhow Amen it's his chooses of my
[1:14:06] choosing it's not the preacher's
[1:14:07] choosing it says choosing hallelujah
[1:14:11] that should settle in our heart he chose
[1:14:14] me to be part of his bride glory to God
[1:14:20] o Lord
[1:14:22] he said now according to the Word of God
[1:14:24] the bride was chosen before the
[1:14:26] foundation of the world
[1:14:27] this choosing of the bride was purposed
[1:14:30] in himself a man Ephesian 1:9 and in
[1:14:33] Romans nine eleven it says that the
[1:14:35] purpose of God according to election
[1:14:37] might stand you cannot read it any other
[1:14:40] way the heart purpose the eternal
[1:14:44] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[1:14:47] his own choosing and that purpose was in
[1:14:50] himself and be an eternal he decreed
[1:14:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:57] hallelujah hey man we were in him way
[1:15:00] over here in his thoughts before God was
[1:15:03] even God when you see when he was the
[1:15:07] eternal one brother Branham says before
[1:15:10] there was ever one speck of Stardust
[1:15:12] before God was God amen you were already
[1:15:17] in his mind hey man the one we could say
[1:15:21] when he was on the cross I was on his
[1:15:23] mind that's personal I was on his mind
[1:15:26] amen he came to redeem us amen he came
[1:15:30] to choose us amen he provided everything
[1:15:34] we have need up for this journey Church
[1:15:36] glory to God before there was one speck
[1:15:39] of Stardust before God was even God he
[1:15:44] was just the eternal spirit that filled
[1:15:46] all space and time a man he had to
[1:15:49] create in order that something could
[1:15:52] worship him before he could be God amen
[1:15:55] but before even that transpired we were
[1:15:57] already in his mind in the Eternals
[1:15:59] glory to God hey man that's why brother
[1:16:02] Bram says that God took a picture of you
[1:16:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:07] amen and put it into the file of
[1:16:10] predestination knowing exactly what our
[1:16:13] you would be born in knowing exactly
[1:16:15] what day you'd be worn Amen knowing
[1:16:18] exactly how much you would win how long
[1:16:20] you would be and what color your hair
[1:16:22] would be in your eyes he already knew
[1:16:25] all about you hey men he watched over
[1:16:28] you through generations of people
[1:16:31] hey man great-grandfather's had brought
[1:16:34] you to earth for one purpose to choose
[1:16:38] you hey men let's say he chose me pull
[1:16:44] your finger he chose me he chose me to
[1:16:47] be part of the bride amen he coulda
[1:16:50] chose somebody else on the road but he
[1:16:53] chose me amen glory to God hallelujah so
[1:17:01] he was only that time potential God and
[1:17:03] he and he was known only as Eternal
[1:17:05] Spirit the bride was already in his mind
[1:17:08] yes she was she was existing in his
[1:17:12] thoughts and what about those thoughts
[1:17:14] of God they are eternal are they not a
[1:17:17] menace no wonder Jesus could say that no
[1:17:20] man can pluck them from my hand
[1:17:23] oh when you're in the hand of him who's
[1:17:26] gonna pull you out
[1:17:28] don't worry to God somebody say praise
[1:17:31] the Lord I watched a documentary not
[1:17:36] long ago and it's interesting because it
[1:17:40] was the anniversary of Apollo 11 he
[1:17:44] probably heard about Apollo 11 I
[1:17:46] remember when I was in grade school man
[1:17:48] made and of course rockets and things
[1:17:51] like that when you're just a 5 6 7 8 10
[1:17:53] year-old boy I mean they intrigued you
[1:17:56] and they were talking about Apollo 11
[1:17:59] and landing on the moon and all that
[1:18:00] kind of thing but I watched the
[1:18:02] documentary and Neil Armstrong y'all
[1:18:06] probably know who Neil Armstrong is amen
[1:18:09] and he was they say he was one of the
[1:18:11] man the first man to put his foot on the
[1:18:13] moon but I watched it and in I was just
[1:18:18] so intrigued by it I know I used this
[1:18:22] example someplace on somebody said well
[1:18:23] they never went on the moon oh it's all
[1:18:25] fictitious then what's up to you what
[1:18:26] you all want to believe but but I said
[1:18:28] they said he was on the moon so I'm just
[1:18:29] gonna believe it and then so I watched
[1:18:32] his life
[1:18:33] that guy was consumed he was consumed
[1:18:38] with the moon he had books that would
[1:18:41] plaster this whole thing full of books
[1:18:43] that guy study day and night there's
[1:18:47] nothing that distracted him from his
[1:18:51] objective to put his foot on the moon no
[1:18:59] it's not my objective but it was his
[1:19:00] objective I got a better objection what
[1:19:03] he all had you do to amen and so he
[1:19:06] studied and he saw lots of his family
[1:19:10] and or excuse me his friends and
[1:19:12] different ones that that they would go
[1:19:14] up and certain rockets that even he was
[1:19:15] supposed to go up in and and of course
[1:19:17] they had disastrous endings but a didn't
[1:19:21] eatery
[1:19:22] it's no wonder the the psalmist said
[1:19:24] fill a thousand Falls at one handed ten
[1:19:27] thousand falls on the other hand it's
[1:19:29] not gonna come nigh on to me Amen why
[1:19:31] because we're in the beloved and he
[1:19:38] would have just look at night look at
[1:19:41] the moon
[1:19:42] hey you so entreat how do rowboat
[1:19:45] yourself I like to I like to look at
[1:19:46] night the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:19:52] tower the righteous run into it is safe
[1:19:58] finally palm 11 they didn't know what
[1:20:02] was gonna happen because of Paulo 10
[1:20:04] blew up he gets into that rocket his
[1:20:10] wife says well are you gonna talk to
[1:20:12] your kids before he got in and and tell
[1:20:14] him he didn't want to talk to his kids
[1:20:16] well what if you don't come back you
[1:20:18] know you want to talk about not coming
[1:20:20] back cuz in his mind I'm going to the
[1:20:23] moon and I'm gonna come back to earth so
[1:20:27] he gets an Apollo 11 and he takes off it
[1:20:32] gets up there and have all their their
[1:20:34] different problems whatever they had but
[1:20:37] finally that little thing comes off and
[1:20:39] no he's dropping onto the moon and the
[1:20:43] excitement that was in his heart
[1:20:45] hoping where I'm going Church the
[1:20:48] excitement was in his heart that was in
[1:20:50] his heart it was you could just feel it
[1:20:53] he open up that door suited himself up
[1:20:56] open up that door he started to descend
[1:20:59] and started walking real slow real slow
[1:21:04] real slow and he stood on the last rung
[1:21:07] and he just looked at it that's the moon
[1:21:09] I can still see it he put his foot down
[1:21:14] picked it up he looked at it first man
[1:21:19] put his foot on the moon and then the
[1:21:22] interesting part of it is that he looked
[1:21:24] back at earth cuz when what perspective
[1:21:26] he was looking at the moon but now he's
[1:21:28] looking back there
[1:21:30] his family and his still on earth so
[1:21:33] what good is it doing him on the boot
[1:21:36] that's why I'm not gonna let one good
[1:21:39] leg behind I'm gonna take as much with
[1:21:42] me as I can take with me
[1:21:43] amen because I'm not going to the moon
[1:21:45] I've gone going in the rapture Amen I've
[1:21:49] got a body change to take amen and my
[1:21:52] passion is to take that body change amen
[1:21:55] when he promised me complete victory
[1:21:57] I believe complete victory amen when he
[1:21:59] promised me full power I believe full
[1:22:02] power amen when he promised me that I'm
[1:22:04] gonna pass the moon without in Iraq I
[1:22:06] feel I'm gonna pass the moon without any
[1:22:09] rocket feel when he promised me
[1:22:11] I haven't overcome earth I am an
[1:22:15] overcomer right now he was so thrilled
[1:22:19] to get on the moon I thought nah his
[1:22:23] whole life he worked to get on the moon
[1:22:27] but at the end of it all he was was on
[1:22:29] the moon I want to give my whole life
[1:22:32] for Christ
[1:22:34] I trust you want to give you a whole
[1:22:36] life for Christ amen brother branham I
[1:22:39] want to say that he had a passion and
[1:22:43] his passion was fulfilled but I trust
[1:22:46] tonight that you have a passion amen
[1:22:49] that you're not just gonna settle for
[1:22:51] for something just mediocre or something
[1:22:54] just a little bit of knowledge or
[1:22:55] something just to say a few nice words
[1:22:57] but a passion to be like Christ a
[1:23:01] passion that Christ would live through
[1:23:04] your lives amen if I could leave you

[1:24:32] that said you're just starting

[1:24:40] only knew what was at the end of the
