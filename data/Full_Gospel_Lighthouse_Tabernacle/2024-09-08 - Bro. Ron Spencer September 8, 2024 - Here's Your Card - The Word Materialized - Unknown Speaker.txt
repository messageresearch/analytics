[Music] how many enjoyed that sermon last night amen that was just that was powerful and you know I was ready to fight a fight a buzz saw after that you know so um you know I had I wanted to share share something I know most of you know I I really believe in testifying and I believe in you guys testifying and testifying of what God delivers you from and you know here a couple weeks ago uh I talked to brother Ron a little bit about it I won't go into all the details but I was dealing with the situation at work and situation at work where we had we had some victims that were they were captives and that's not a metaphor to anything it's the truth they were captives and it it really dealt it it was dealing with my heart and it was it was heavy on my heart and I was having a hard time with it because we we'd sit in front of them and we talk to them and we had some that would even tell us they had Stockholm syndrome which is a medical medical name for when you become bound to your captor to where you actually feel a an attraction to your captor and you don't want to come and testify against them and that that spoke volumes to me and it just it really began to just deal with my heart and there's nothing we could do with them I could I could sit here and I could take them in front of the court and I could take the the captor in front of the court but it's not my testimony that's going to set them free it's their testimony that's going to set them free and so I went to I went to Ohio to be with uh be in the meetings here a couple weeks ago and I just felt led of the Lord to do that and I left early in the morning and about 4:00 in the morning God began to deal with me on that because it was just so heavy on my heart I wanted to be able to wanted to be able to help them and God just dropped it right down in my heart between 3 and 4:00 in the morning on the road said is this not the same thing that happens in the spiritual amen and that point it just turned the table on everything of what we deal with and I have I have the power to to be able to set these set these victims down and every criminal activity that they're involved in I can take those charges away if they just testify against their captor and we have the same power to be able to do that we have we have men that that stand here and they will preach the gospel and they may know exactly what you're what you're dealing with and you may come time and time again to be able to come again get prayed for and get prayed for and these men will stand and they can testify for you they can pray for you they can stand they can stand in front of Satan's enemy and our enemy and they can stand in front of Satan and you can be delivered but if you don't testify of that Satan is going to continue to bind you and bind you and bind you and you'll go back to him and so as he as as the Lord begin to help me with that he helped me understand exactly what we deal with to where when we pray for somebody and when you pray for somebody and when you become delivered of something you must testify because it's your testimony that's going to bind the enemy so he cannot come back to afflict you let's just take these needs back to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful to be able to come and be here this morning and be able to come and be in an atmosphere that this is more than just a gathering of people this is more than just another church service and Lord I I speak to many people all the time and speak to them about their churches and they have Gatherings and and truly they go and they worship the one and true Living God Jesus Christ but Lord Jesus we have a message that has brought us forth and brought us into a living open word that we don't have to second guess where we go to or second guess whether is this right or is this wrong we have we have Malachi 4 the prophet of Elijah that's came and you spoke through him and Lord Jesus we hear each and every one of these prayer requests you see sister Pat there that just went through the surgery and I'm believing they the doctors were able to go in and take every cancerous cell out and that will be the end of that fight but Lord Jesus we know that there's healing and we know life is what brings the healing and you give us that life and Lord Brother JD whitson's grandson there and we see sister Katie ktie and Hunter as they've just had their baby and how Satan will just attack and he'll try to attack the lives of these little children because he knows that he knows that he's coming towards his end and and as these lives come forth it's it's just one more last seed coming in before his time is up and Lord Jesus as he attacks the children and as he attacks the children of you Lord Jesus I pray that you could just come and just put a hedge of protection around each and every one of us Lord and I just pray that you could just come and no matter what we're battling with no matter even if we think that we are loving the life that we are in and loving the sin that we're in we are just we are just Bound by a captor that that Lord you have the power over top of and I pray that you would just be able to deliver each and every one of us this morning even if we don't understand the the sermons that come forth that may f as they're cutting and we may enjoy the life that we're living and may enjoy the things that we're doing and may not completely understand exactly exactly why we have to stop doing that and we hear it and we hear it and we hear it over and over again I pray that you would just apply the the bomb of Gilead over top of us whether it's a healing whether it's it's eyes opening to the word there's people here Lord that I believe have real Deliverance that is needed and their eyes need to become open and healing needs to come forth and Lord Jesus I I believe that this can be the morning of that this can be the morning that that souls are delivered and and even as even as sermons would be preached and in in back in the day where sermons would be preached and souls would fall down in the street because they felt the presence of the Lord I believe that all across the service and the streaming of the internet and the ones here that come I pray that just surrendered Hearts will come before you this morning that that we could just come and we could just give our life to you and and then we could take and we could bind the enemy this morning bind the enemy from everything that he's tried to tried to afflict us of that we may become Overcomers because we know that we are Overcomers by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony Lord and I just pray that you would come and be with us be with our pastor this morning bring it bring a just power behind him and anointing behind him in Jesus name I pray amen amen at this time we're going to receive this morning's offering you give as God's bless you and if you given you can be seated have a couple

the preaching of the word and so if you've never been in in a prayer line we'll maybe after brother Ron speaks today we'll just kind of go over those things but I just wanted to make that mention to you just to prepare your hearts while the preaching of the word is going forth and and just to just drop this in just now if you've never been in a prayer line if you never come to an altar just hold something in your heart and sometimes you don't even really understand why you're getting in a prayer line you maybe not find anything but maybe it's for somebody else and just because you get in line you can watch something take place and not saying that you have to get in a prayer line not saying you have to do those things but sometimes just people going through not not didn't even know it some of the greatest Miracles I've personally heard of is because somebody else went through the line not knowing what they were going through for but it was for somebody else so just just prepare your heart for those things today and sing that song How Great Is Our God can you see amen amen oh the Splendor of King clothe in mesty let all the Earth Rejoice all the Earth Rejoice he wraps himself in

so glad to have each and every one of you with us today if you will stand with me I just I just I know today is going to be special and you just don't know how special it is brother Kalin sing from from South Africa wrote me this morning and he's quite a wonderful fellow but he wot wrote me this morning and and uh he actually wrote my text this morning told me he was praying for me and that text is the word materialized that's more than a coincidence and I thought God is just telling us he's going to be with us today and and so I'd like to read this text for you in Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 7 God bless you brother kayin as well he'll be he may be watching even now brother George Quinn is going to be with us on our fall festival and he'll be speaking on Saturday night I know he's watching and God bless you brother George we love him with all of his heart his daughter is coming amen and uh she has got time off to be able to come and it's been her dream to come to this place and so you sisters I want you to make her feel as comfortable as she can be and so I know you will that's just what you do and so don't think it it's that's just just going to just by chance happen again over and over like brother George she can't do it every year and so let's take advantage of that time make friends with her and if you will do that Isaiah 55 and verse 7 let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts and neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heaven are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts 2 Corinthians CH 5 and verse 14 for the Lord of Christ constrain us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we are all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which dieth for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh that now henceforth know we know him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature let's read the scripture together therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold All Things become new amen God bless you as you're seated today I want to read The Lord's Prayer if you'll read that with me just now after this manner pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen the next verse says for if we forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you amen I want you greet your neighbor beside of you and say welcome to the house of the Lord God bless you amen God bless you amen I look up and see new faces here I I didn't I'm sorry I didn't get to you but God bless you God bless you in the name of the Lord amen God bless you always brother Roger and sister an amen man we we're buddies from a long time ago now last night I would have preached that if IID have thought of it I been an individual that has loved boxing I've absolutely loved boxing throughout life and I'll never forget I'll never forget that don't hold that against me but now I box against the devil I'll never forget being at the same hotel with brother Harold Hilder brand I was a young man at that time and I don't know we wasn't married just a couple years I don't know if we had children at that time and so anyway I walked out and there's the there's the leading speaker of the meeting and he's standing with his foot on the rail it was it was so back into the day that's when we had we had we had those outside rails and you the outside doors and and so I I walked out and there he stood and so I felt just Abol absolutely privileged to be standing there and talk to him I don't I didn't know at that time we're going to be lifetime friends and so I walked out beside of him and I just begin to greet him and talk to him and and he just looked over at me and he said do you like boxing I'm not expecting the the speaker of the meeting to talk to me about boxing and so from that point we became Bosom Buddies and and I would preach his meeting from 2000 until last year and and he went on to be with the Lord and he was quite a quite a quite a boxer himself and so you know we had a wonderful time in life and and uh and we would talk about boxing a whole lot and even in his days to where that he was so weak he could take you by the hands and put you on the floor he was a very strong man and we just enjoyed one another's company last night brother brother Andrew was speaking and and he was talking about Sugar Ray Leonard and and Thomas Hearns fighting and Thomas Hearns had basically beat him for 14 rounds had literally wrecked him for 14 rounds let me just share this with you brother David Kegley heard the sermon one time and I was talking about Sugar Ray Leonard this is actually one of the gloves that Sugar Ray Leonard used I like it and he gave it to me after that after that the cancer had had struck us and and he said brother Ronnie said I want you to always know that that you're a fighter you're an absolute fighter and so and so he he was a he's a wonderful fellow Brother David Kegley I don't know if he'll hear of this today he goes to brother Wayne La Lawson's church and he said I want you to fight with all of your hearts and every time that you look at this glove remember you're a fighter and we have been in a battle for for just about four years and brother Kelly hildbrandt came to preach and and so God had spoke to me that week and he spoke to me as to speak a sermon on don't worry I this is before cancer we even had a thought of cancer and said just don't worry and brother Kelly was scheduled to be here and his brother came and he actually got here a day early and brother Kelly had got on flight even the same day and he actually spent three days trying to get here and if you remember I told you then as an audience I told you I said whatever Brother Kelly's got to say to us the devil is trying to block it you remember that the devil's trying to block him from saying what God has laid on his heart and so so anyway brother Kelly came and if you'll remember Brother Kelly's such a he's such a gentleman I don't know if I'll have that that good a personality even when I get to heaven and so anyway you you know it it just isn't fair that some guys are so sweet and so kind and so gentle I try to do all of that but well here we are and brother Kelly comes and and he comes to the pull pit he's been all day traveling and he comes to the pull pit and he he gives me a coin and it's really special to me I have it on my desk at home he doesn't know but he's felt led to give me a coin that says we will accept nothing less than full Victory let me remember that and on the there was there's a piece of sand brother Roger I'm glad you're here this morning there's a piece of sand it comes from the Normandy Beach now now what that means to me is we had a Believer here brother Roger your Uncle Max and Max Max was quite a he's quite a wonderful man how many remember brother Max I'm actually preaching now so you know you it's counting in my minutes so it's going to be all right and so brother Max had been in on he had actually been at this battle and brother Max said that he said that he said I I was placed to where that I would I would come off of those boats and we would hit the ground running and we would be in the water and he said he said just thousands of us was hitting the water at the same time and he said he said my comrades were falling and the water turned red I don't think we could talk about how devastating it was and he's running and he said I was thinking I'll die any second and he's running in the water bullets are flying bombs are dropping and they're they're fighting against those those great those great big big shooting guns that are up on the hill that Germany had built as a fortress nobody thought they'd ever win the war but they were running into the sand and he said there was men laying all over the beach and he said said we were running and he said I thought well I'm going to die any second and he said I made it to the wall he said brother Ryan I I never I never knew why that I made it one of the last nights that brother Max was ever here and he had to go he had to go to the Veteran's Home CU he was since in such bad shape he got so forgetful and his mind began but he would would come up and at the sometimes in the service and he would come and sit behind beside of me any of you ever remember that I always thought that was so special you know to me that was just so special and he' come and he would lay his hand on my leg and he'd say brother Ron I love you and one night I preached on predestination how God has watched over your life you may have been in a war you may have been in a tough thing and you may have been in difficult moments but God preserved your life and he he came and laid his hand on my leg and he said tonight for the first time I know why God preserved me to serve himall to serve him I don't know if you know it but God preserved your life he preserved your life to preserve [Applause] you brother Tom Hill would you stand if you will just for a moment brother Tom had a desire on his heart to buy me a rifle it was a special rifle and it would have my name on it and it would have a lot of things on it in gold and you know brother Tom's a wonderful man and he's got that nature like brother Kelly and he he wanted to do it for me but I knew the cost of that and I I I I knew it would cost a lot of money and I would tell him no no brother Tom maybe a year or so you had that on your heart I'd hold him off I'd say brother Tom no I I I I you know there's there's a lot of other things that you can do with that kind of money and so I told him you know please don't do that we got the diagnosis of cancer that it had it in our lungs at that point and in our lymph nodes and and it was quite it's quite overwhelming you know you know sometimes you get a test and you worry about will you get it or not but when they actually tell you you got it it takes another level we're going to announce this as a as a as to our body of Believers I've stood here with you now all these years and I think at that point about 20 years brother Andrew was sitting over here but before service before service brother Tom knocks on the back door and I think one of the boys was with us and Brother Sam how fitting this is they're getting married next Friday amen hallelujah and so he and Kaylee are just special people and so anyway he knocks on the door and he knocks on the door and he walks in and he's got a David slink amen and we've just had the discussion of how we've got to announce this to this audience and here comes brother Tom and he's got this swing and he said brother Ron I you wouldn't let me buy that gun for you but I bought this sling for you and if you'll remember I I waved it over this audience I promised you as a body of Believers that I'd do my best many other things would happen and the Lord would speak to me December the 22nd if you'll trust me I'll use you like never never before how many remember that I'm talking to you about the word materializing it's not squirrels maybe it's not storms but God wants to take your life and let you see I'm with you I'm with you in your storms I'm with you in your battles you know I've had my critics do this I've been told many times it was a cursed on my life you know that comes kind of difficult the difficult part is brother Chris the difficult part is you've watched God God God through this for months before it happened and he was prepping us for it I've watched doctors I've watched doctors be the best that they could be and I've had a phenomenal team of doctors now we're four years down the line and I sat with a doctor last week with sister Connie listen those doctors have gave me a lot of difficult news through this four years you'll you'll not live listen the first doctor that came in and told me my life expectancy she sat down down on the bed and she said she said Connie was laying in the bed she was asleep on the next place and she was asleep and this doctor came in and they were going to brain surgery tomorrow and she told me she said I want you to understand we'll do our best and she said understand she said even at our best to try to help you about four months and they told me to get my Affairs in order they told me we would have to do two different types of chemo and then the first chemo that they gave me didn't work and and then the second type of chemo and two different types that I take every day because I believe God's with doctors and I believe God's with with medicine I believe with all of that and so listen I as a man realize my position but let me let me just say this to you in all of this we have inspired thousands of people to fight this battle and I want to say this you I've tried to be the best Christian that I know how to be I've tried to face every day with confidence and faith and and and I've tried not to be a whiny box listen I've I've had days where I couldn't get out of bed I've had days to where I I throwed up most of the day I've had days where my head hurt so bad I couldn't stand it I've had days and even now have days to where I don't have any strength but I've tried to to be a real representative of the cause of Jesus Christ because this word this word's got to take on flesh and if God wants somebody that he can have confidence in that can face cancer that can face cancer listen last year when I spoke at brother Ed hammer meisters in Edmonton it hit me in the pull pit God has to have somebody that can look at cancer and can overcome it listen we don't know what the end of the trial would be like it's in the hands of God I don't worry about it I I try not to think about it I try not to dwell on it but listen he's me four years and I've enjoyed my boys I've enjoyed my family I've enjoyed you as a body of Believers I'm just delivering my heart here for a little bit thank you Lord but in spite of that in spite of all of that there's been people that have railed and set a lot of things overseas here in the states and I want to put put this to bed I just want to put this to bed and I'll tell you why I want to put it to bed cuz God spoke to me you can't put anything to bed until God spoke to me here recently someone called me and and began to tell me how cursed I was listen I had people with me and I I went to a private place but after I saw that that this this is the way it was going to go I thought I'm going to have a witness steep back into a place that I had a witness and I asked them to listen and this individual was telling me how cursed that I was and laughing because I had cancer I just asked him did you feel better do you feel better come on and I hung up this week this week I couldn't sleep and that's been a few that's been weeks ago I just I gave it to God I just I gave all that to God I don't dwell on that but this week I couldn't sleep one night and I was just laying there my blood pressure was quite high no Rhyme or Reason and I just I was just laying there and it was 2:32 brother Doug and the Lord spoke to me here is your card here's your card and I sat up in the bed and I said what are what are you saying what are you saying to me Lord I'm not a prophet what are you saying to me so I went into my office and I was sitting in my office and he directed me to a certain thought in the message now I want to just turn just for a moment brother Brandon was having a prayer line he was having a prayer line and and there's a man came and brother brandham had a lot of critics and so I just want to put this out here brother had a lot of critics can you think of all the good that brother brandham his ministry did I can't fathom the good that his ministry did yet still had critics still had critics I mean people the dead was raised cancers were gone phenomenal Miracles 8800 people people documented Miracles that happened listen it only takes two to become the pope come on think about that two miracles to become the pope and listen in five minutes in the prayer lines with brother brandham are you with me your name your address that's right listen that's the god that we represent I want you to remember God's not dead he's not dead listen the same message that God listen the important one in that picture is that Pillar of Fire and whether you can see it or not he's [Applause] here at 2:32 so I walked in and I begin to be taken to a certain spot brother brandham is praying he's come toward the end of the prayer line and a man comes up brother R takes him by the hand and he said you're a well man and that man turns and he to the audience and he said see see my card my card says TB on and brother Brandon's reeling because he's so weak you've heard it many times he's reeling because he's too weak and he and brother Bram takes him by the hand again and he says you're a well man you're a well man listen you're not playing with a man listen when we come here we're not playing with a man and he says you're a well man and he said my card says TB you can get the quote and I'm just paraphrasing now and he said what you have wrote on the card you now have the scripture says touch not my anointing do my prophets no harm I'm more than an officer of the church I'm a Son of God that has represented this message since 1983 I want you to be careful I'm talking to the world I want you to be careful what you call a curse here's your card I want you to make that the title so we can easily find that subtitle it the word m materialized you want to bring that other piece we went to Brother Tom Ray to preach the meting me this year it's a youth meeting it's also their church meeting it's in a tent it's quite a large meeting how many you would you think was there 5 600 people and and so anyway they don't tell us what the theme of the meeting is they don't tell us what the theme of them meeting is but God laid it on my heart and Andrew probably preached the best for services I've ever heard him preach I sat there and marveled I never heard those sermons preached before but I sat there and Marvel at what he said and God just came along behind it service after service and Vindicated the word over and over again and that's to God be the glory and so and so anyway anyway I went there and God had dealt with me for months because in 1986 I was sitting in the meeting and maybe some of you were there brother bisco preached a meeting and he preached a meeting called let us run was any of you in sitting in the meeting you was I I'm glad you were there with me brother Gabriel would you I know it's posted on the internet in a couple places but would you repost that let us run and so anyway I was sitting there as a young Minister and I was so inspired by that sermon until I committed my life like never before to this message and listen I've been a lot of places in the world I've been I've been all over the world but but let let me just say this to you I go back to that sermon to where that I committed the rest of my life to this message and to Jesus Christ and listen I knew that I was to spend all of my energies to preach this message with everything that was within me and so I go back I go back when I get into a tight spot I go back to where he ignited me to preach this message with every everything that was within me well they knew that as a family that that's where basically I got my start and so brother bisco's daughter is named Marilyn and she's been a phenomenal artist been a phenomenal artist all of her life and so incredible works well I always thought that I'd like to have a a a piece of her work in my home now I've got pictures for she did did some work and so one night after service and I had preached let us run they said we want to have a meeting with you so we had went to we'd went to supper after the service and God had moved in an incredible way and sister Cony had actually went to our room and she was wore out and so brother Tom said you got to come and so all of the Bisal family was there and they presented me this and I'm not going to pass it along around cuz it's it's too fragile this is Brother bis's hand they did a wax mole of brother bis's hand because brother bisc preached a sermon called let us run and he this is an this this has Hebrew 12 verse1 and that scripture tells us lay aside every weight and the sin was does so easily beset you and let us run the race that is set before you it's got some other special inscriptions on it and they put brother bis's hand in wax and he said I'll do that for brother Ron and so I I I'll just share this with you we didn't know how we was going to get it through the border now he's giving it to me and it's a special present but how do we get this through the border so I came to one of the officers and he was looking at it and he said give me a title to what it is he said what is that and it just hit me I said that's a Lifetime Achievement Award that officer grabbed me and he hugged me I'll guarantee it's not a person another person all day got hugged by that officer he said I met a speci special man today a preacher that received a Lifetime Achievement Award I'm telling that for the first time so there we are and so Hallelujah I think it's a special honor I want to say this to you I want to hear him say well done maybe the new ones Among Us don't know exactly what all God's done in our lives but we've had a very special life I've always prayed that I have the love of Jesus and if anything that you could feel from me I want you to feel the love of Jesus Christ in this audience you mind if I preach just a little bit now brother brandham says this he said to the right mental attitude you'll not get anywhere without the right mental attitude the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of god notice these next words will bring it to pass we'll bring it to pass and if you'll take the right mental attitude towards any promise in the Bible it'll bring it to pass I want us to read that together and I'll lead you one verse one couple words at a time and I want you to say it the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you'll take the right mental attitude towards any promise in that Bible it'll bring it to pass another place and from that time brother brandom said if Jesus was here tonight I want you to catch these words if Jesus was here tonight wearing this suit he could not heal you listen closely now you ministers Divine Healing salvation anything that was included in the atonement is a past tense listen he was wounded for our transgressions he said past tense and with his stripes we were healed can you say this it's already done Sissy's to Whitney's to have a procedure tomorrow an operation tomorrow I want to tell you personally from this P pit It's Already Done brother BR said but see instead of a human being it was a super super super human being and that's what makes human being now not only human being but he's a son and daughter of God the super super super super life that was in him comes back and wants to live in you than lord it's more than your Humanity but it's the god that's in you and when that God is in you there's nothing impossible I want you to say that with you the god that is in you there's nothing impossible there's nothing impossible quoting to scripture it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh propit nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life this Bible's got to come to life and then he begins to quote the word itself is Spirit and the spirit in word form then you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and it acts and because now here a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word word and then when a thought is presented it is the word now this is the God's thought that he placed in the word and then when he received it from him it becomes the word these are more than just thoughts billions of people have had this in their hands but because you are who you are catch this now because you are who you are when it goes across your lips it becomes omnipotent it becomes so powerful there's not a devil in hell listen Satan's in trouble with a real son and daughter of God takes this word and comes across their lips it shakes the kingdom of hell it's pretty powerful prove it brother Ron Joshua stopped the sun Moses stretched his Rod out across the Red Sea it's unfathomable how many things happen in brother brandom's meetings squirrels it's more than a story it's more than a story oh that you know that was just a hunting story really brother brandham comes back and he's probably telling the poorest people in his church that's right right he's sitting with the poorest people in the church and he's sitting there talking to hady Wright and hady wght said that's nothing but the truth brother brandom listen Eternal things happen in just a moment and brother brandham said the angel told him whatever she would want speak come on now you talking about incredible position she could have been the richest person in the world Listen God's God but she asked for something greater than money houses jobs my two sons and Billy Andrew stood in this pull pit and said if there's only two going to be there her two sons are going to there I want you to think just for a moment you remember when God spoke to me and said this will be special to you sister Denise because I've never told this part look past what you see and think past what you think brother Thomas you was with me in that Vision you were standing right here standing beside of me brother Thomas has been in two different Visions in my life that's a quite special spot and we was watching brother heril cross a bridge we'll be there one day we'll see him one day I want you to think past your Humanity just for a moment don't don't let the stuff in your life brother Ron I'm all tore up about this stuff this thing this deal with this a this is special sermon God don't look at the stuff in your life but those stuff will cause complexes and attitudes and all different kind of thing get past that look what the word is saying about you well brother Ron I see myself in a different element let me just say God don't look at you like you look at you God had to get Abraham to the spot that he didn't look at himself the way that he was it took years for Abraham to look at how God looked at Abraham listen brother I I just want to share this you and I just want to paraphrase whatever you are here is a reflection of what you'll be there whatever you are here is a reflection of what you'll be there there will be no Liars there no cheaters there you're talking about heaven there's going to be no sin there and there's going to be no sickness there the cancer demon will not be there your genuine object is there so you are a reflection of the genuine now listen this is direct quote now if you can trust the human part why not trust the Superhuman part if you can trust the body why not trust the spirit for the spirit is superior to the body listen I want you to just notice this this is powerful Shalom God doesn't make anything that perishes God doesn't make anything that perishes God is eternal and therefore this life that we now live is only refle reflecting what is ahead of us the real one cannot die is this microphone working the real one cannot die the body that cannot perish the life that cannot be taken and therefore the scriptures is right when it says that we have everlasting life we have eternal life we shall never die can I say it to you Homer Frasier did not die your loved ones did not die they were transported ubered Chariot to another dimension brother Donnie Reagan that was talking about his daughter that perished with cancer probably had more prayers than any other human being that ever but she did not die she did not die and if I perish off of this realm of this Earth I didn't die don't weep for me when I'm gone I'll be more alive there than I am [Applause] here as Christians you shouldn't fear death don't fear death don't fear it well brother Ron we hear songs about death we change those songs to songs about life Hallelujah this is about life life brother John steeman they were singing some sad songs in his in his room before he was diving dying he said hold on who's dying here who's dying here I'm going to my life [Applause] now God is infinite we all know that that he cannot change therefore where our faith can rest us so assured if God says anything it has to be that way forever it can never be changed God is omnipotent God is omnipresent and being om omnicient and makes him non-depressive he knows all things and God could not just be like the air because God has a Dwelling Place God is not a myth God is a being God Jesus he god listen with God you don't have to be pronouned correct he's not a layout of seeing God he's always been God he will forever be God he will eternally be God and he's a male god let's just get it straight he's a he God we're the Sheep part of God did you catch it turn your heing it up we're the Sheep part of God we came out of him Hallelujah therefore we are as Eternal as he is eternal [Applause] Hallelujah and God being infinite he knew all things before the world was ever created he knowed every fly every KN was ever created every time that he ever batted his eye how much tower that he had before the world ever started now that's infinite he knowed the end from the beginning that makes him infinite brother Ron I'd like to listen you do not have any fathom of what infinite really means that's a good Amen Brother Bill and it's true I want you to think about this is a powerful quote and this is where we're coming to a wind down now you're your old book is gone every one of you had an old book and there's chapters in there you'll never tell your children about that's a good one brother D listen there's things that we don't want nobody to know God knew it now your name in your old book has been transferred do you mean to tell me that that old my old book God put it in the sea of forgetfulness and you stand perfectly before god wow your amen should have been better than that I'm going to read it again and it's your turn God put it in the sea of forgetfulness and you stand perfectly before God now listen we got a glimpse of how God thought when brother random would stand there and tell people that things 40 years ago 50 years ago a glimpse but greater than even that God knows the end from the beginning are you with me and listen the Sea of God's forgetfulness brother Doug listen the devil may bring it up to you over and over again he may bring it up because he's got a book of memory but when God takes your memory brother Jim and you and I have talked about your your your Navy and all of that but the things that you and I talked about God don't even know about I want you to think about you and I as human beings we can Fellowship in a realm to where you remember those things and you bring it up because you talk about Grace but the god of Heaven don't even know about what you was like it's over it's done I want you to think about that David was a murderer right blood took care of it listen Rahab Tamar all of those and the blood took care of that how powerful is that blood how powerful is that blood and God puts it in a sea of God's forgetfulness and we've quoted it so many times and he put a sign there no fishing [Applause] now your name is now in the book of a new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb what the lamb redeemed now the old book of your nature your your natural Union but your new bride brother Bram screams Hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified he quotes Romans 5 verse one therefore being justified by faith Look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're just forgiven for instance you heard and I I'm just going to skip quickly he said it's as though you never did it in the first place I want you to tell your neighbor it's as though you never did it in the first place can I just pick brother Steven you're sitting here you look great this morning brother Stephen I have to be honestly I don't know nothing about your past I know nothing she does you do in your book of memory that's why God has to change your body you have to get a birth into another body to where you don't even remember I think I'm going to shout here for a while if y'all don't mind I I know we're going to have a prayer line but I think I'm going to shout here for a little while God's going to give us a body and he's going to wipe the tears from our eyes Hallelujah for eternity how long you guys been married reason I asked you is I didn't want no penalty on him this afternoon and you look like a perfect couple I mean you just I can say Well done they're sitting there holding hands right now I think that's so special I've seen him do it so many times you you young guys look at that right there that's that's what you do that's what you do that's what you do now she still got the memory Channel but in on a certain day something's come up and you just go that's gone that's gone that's it's gone it's over with it's over with it's over with just look over him tell him it's over with now you tell her I believe it you drove two hours to get that exercise now practice at this coming weak brother Bram says this I'm not guilty you could forgive me but I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm Justified because I actually I actually done it I'm but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it but the word Justified is that though you never did it listen I had a very scarred past and I'm not going to stand here for three more hours and tell you my scarred passed because I didn't do it Hallelujah there was a guy that lived in my body that was not a Christian and it may look like the same house only with gray hair and new teeth and now glasses listen these are permanent baby they don't fall out they're real but listen the old guy that was here the old guy that was here he's dead dead brother Ben I don't know I I know nothing about what you guys have been taught for years and when I say brother Ben it covers everybody listen I don't know what you were taught about forgiveness and being justified listen this ain't just a Penance this ain't where you pay for a pray to cover your sins this isn't where an animal dies God bled God pardoned you he paid for it all cuz you couldn't do it yourself hallelujah hallelujah and he paid for you and he pardoned you and it's over and you can sing the song I can now go [Applause] free you understand that you understand that you don't have to beat yourself no more amen you don't have to light a candle if we got Catholics listening you don't have to light a candle you don't have to pay for your prayers you don't have to beat yourself over and over again you don't have to feel condemned by it the scripture says there is therefore now no condemnation you can be seated just a couple more moments is it okay if I use you sister chass s sister Chassidy grew up with a lot of scars a lot of scars that created complexes listen as brother Andrew told it last night about and she's not the case about bastard born children how that they were cursed for 400 years if that be still true true all of us are in trouble we're Americans that came across the sea and we got a lot of stuff are you with me we got a lot of stuff but brother brandom said the blood how powerful is the bad the blood the blood took care of all of that and I don't care what your past heredity was [Applause] I have a disease I'm Afflicted but not not defeated and the disease was passed down by my mother and my grandmother I didn't know I had it they said I had it for eight years approximately before it was found there's things ticking in your body that you don't know nothing about are you with me now it's ticking in your body but listen when it wakes up and it begins to start on you there's a [Applause] blood there's a blood sister chassid you don't have to beat yourself and you don't have to worry about how your children are going to turn out and your children's children are going to turn out because God takes the chain and he breaks [Applause] it he br breaks a [Applause] chain and I say this is some of my last statements isn't it wonderful to know a God that says that's enough Satan that's enough you can't torment with this I'm going to give him a revelation I have paid for it it's over with God bless you God bless you God bless [Applause] you hallelujah hallelujah it's your little boy in the building Wesley Zoe awake ISAC awake you can be seated just one more moment we're getting ready to have a prayer line now I'm thinking I'm going this way what's getting ready to happen here brother Ron I just know this if God laid it on my heart a month ago to have this Amen brother Andrew told me said Dad wait on wait on the meeting one of the brothers might have an a burden to have a prayer line so I just held it and after the meeting they prayed for you as an open congregation and I told Andrew we have a job and I know some of you may have to get home or whatever you got to do we understand that but I believe there's people here that desires a real miracle in their life a real forgiveness in their life maybe there's complexes that you fought won't you just let it go won't you just let it go let it go tonight give it to Jesus amen could you said brother Ron I I want to see a miracle well they told me I'd never walk again and 1994 I fell 40 ft I was paralyzed from just be below my ribs cuz I fell 40 feet and landed on concrete and they told me I'd never walk again and the statement I made to the doctor that night you don't know who you're talking to listen it took a year for me to get over it but I'm walking quite well I'm walking quite well I I walk two miles every day treadmill or my driveway I walk two miles every day because it helps the chemo work and makes make a good heart I may have had a massive heart attack but it I'm here I was burned in a horrible fire and think brother bisco called sister Connie told him I want him to preach the meeting next year at Mount Baker listen that day they told sister Connie I wouldn't live and she trusted what God spoke to brother bisc that I would not only live but I'd be the preacher at Mount Baker the word is man is materialized I haven't left my thought the word became materialized Isaiah chapter 53 and I want you to put it up and I'm going to read it to you Wesley couldn't walk listen when you see a miracle like Wesley got it's not just for Wesley it's for his children amen it's not just for Wesley it's for his children when you see when you see Isaac and Zoe they couldn't have children and I'm gonna go go through it it's it's it's a phenomenal Miracle but when you see Isaac and Zoe it's not just for them it's for their children brother Ben when you came to this message it wasn't just for you look around look around it's just not for you it's for your children how many of those children do we have here today I'm going to give you a permission to stand on your seats now for the big guys you don't have to stand on your seats but I want all the children of these Believers to stand I want to say boo devil Hallelujah boo devil the devil loses I want to make one more statement here that is a Hatty right experience that's nothing but the truth it's not just for you it's for your children all over this building it's not just for you it's for your children Hallelujah let's pray Heavenly Father you have spoke to us I'm not finished but you have spoke to us in in the last weeks to have this service and even sending a note from overseas of what this service title would be and that was already written down in my notes Lord people will never know what that meant to me sitting at my table eating oatmeal this morning God you've got plans and I've watched your spirit move across this audience over and over again there may be critics but we have a real God this is more than a message it's more than a lifestyle it's a supernatural [Music] gospel and Lord we've got real needs Among Us now your Prophet said when we lay hands on the sick and anoint them with a that there's a light that is transmitted between that hand and the individual you're that same sit natural God the scripture says that you were wounded for our transgressions you were bruised for our iniquities Lord you paid for it by your stripes we were healed now I pray not only for these here now but Brother JD [Music] wson his grandson wherever is he's at now Lord come and heal him brother Steven massengill's daughter that we've

been going through the church age book and brother Brandon was talking about the omnipotence of God about his word being an action in our lives and she got up that morning and said Lord somehow today let me see your power in action we had a wonderful day we come back home we have a beautiful little dog and as we was coming back in just pulling right in somehow the dog got underneath of my wheel and I run right over top of the dog and it crushed us just to be honest it crushed us in a matter of moments but sister Katie went to action she went into action right there because she had been LED of the Lord that morning to pray Lord let me see your power in action somehow today that little dog was yelping it looked like his foot was completely broke sister Katie went into prayer and immediately as she got done praying she started thanking the Lord that little dog that was yelping and was in so much pain as soon as she said amen that dog put its foot down and took off running all
