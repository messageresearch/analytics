the room alone but the author has come to take the book and speak to our hearts I feel that one here tonight and I know that you're aware of it so let us go into him in prayer tonight as we commit this service unto him and then he has a need that you'd like to take before the Lord amen father we are your children Lord and we counted such an honor to call you our father Lord to recognize the Lord that you wrote The Very World off of your fingertips father to recognize that that you covered this you covered this world with rain father in it and it there was a covenant and there was a token that shined out that you'd never destroy the world again by that Reign and there was a covenant that was made between Earth and you father now father there's a blood Covenant that is upon your people that they cannot go down by the way of Destruction nor by the way of the Grave because you have already taken the keys of all of those things of death Hell In The Grave father knowing those things Lord we recognize that there can be no fear Lord because we know that you are here and perfect love has cast out all of our fear father to recognize that we're in the presence of the one that holds the keys tonight father we can look at the enemy and realize that he's a defeated foe tonight no matter what we face in this life we recognize that the all-powerful one that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world and we invite you father to come and take these lips of clay tonight and and be Lord be Lord of all in our life father both speaker and hearer may you speak through the speaker may you hear through the hearer Lord your word is already an anointed father but Lord we stand here as dedicated vessels father to receive the blessings father of the hour that we're living in and we're asking Lord that the mighty Angel would show forth his power right here today Lord we recognize that same rainbow Covenant was sown over top of our Mighty Angel we recognize that his feet were as a pillars of fire and as we are standing here Lord upon this Earth father may we go forth in demonstration and power of the Holy Spirit father I pray you bless those that are on the way of the internet Lord listening Lord our sister Gabrielle father we pray your blessings upon her and the little child Enoch Lord as they recover father Lord we pray your blessings upon those Lord that are near and far that are listening to this or go back and archive it I pray a special blessing upon the children of God and I pray Lord that we would see you high and lifted up Lord May the presence that we fill in this place may it not just be for your children here but for those that are listening tonight Lord I know the atmosphere can change Lord and streaming's not the way Lord that you've destined but it is a channel father and I pray Lord that you would bless your children Lord you see all things Lord and you can compensate father Lord where we need compensation so we speak in your name and ask God do your blessings be upon this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the New Testament in a few places in John chapter 4 and then down to Hebrews 11 and then Romans chapter 8 . I know it's a few different readings for you from flipping back and forth but I want to gather these these texts to gather our thoughts tonight I would like to speak to you on this thought of lead led by the pillar of Fire led by the pillar of fire and it good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen we love the Lord of all of our hearts amen we counter the privilege to be in his house one more time amen God is so good to us amen John chapter 4 and verse 6 and Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 24. by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect under the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible in Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on this thought of lead by the pillar of fire brother Branham said in the message of led by the spirit he said the greatest the greatest thing that I found in Christian Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you the greatest thing that I've found in Christian Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you he said there's no one that can lead you to the altar but the spirit of God there's no one that could bring you here tonight lest it was a spirit of God he moves in mysterious ways and is one vendors are to perform and to think that our Prophet would stand here before us in this generation recognizing some of the greatest things being able to see some of the greatest Mysteries and understand some of the greatest things that that had been hid before the foundation of the world and to see and recognize that the greatest thing that that the prophet could find was to be led by the very Spirit of the Living God and I have to think have to have to agree with William Branham here on this thought it's the greatest thing in life to recognize the leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's a very incredible thought when you begin to think about your own life in its own Spectrum when you begin to think about the creator of Heaven and Earth is the one that that has been leading you through all of your times of life in in good times and in bad times and David would say in Psalms 34 that I Will Bless The Lord at all times but to recognize that our Lord Jesus Christ has been the one that has led you through every journey through every struggle through every battle it was Spirit of the Living God that was there that was leading you leading you through cancer leading you through trials leading you through marriage problems leading you through financial issues in your life it was the spirit of the Living God that was leading you through all of those things and to recognize that his leadership has been there all of those days but not just in the natural but to recognize that the spirit of the Living God has led you in all of your spiritual life that he that he that he led you he maybe he may have alleged you down to this church and you may you may have found or gave your heart to the Lord maybe in a Catholic church or down at a church of Christ but it's the grace of God that he didn't leave you down there in those dead denominations but he but he led you to something that would bring you rapturing faith in this generation and I thank the Lord that he didn't leave us where he found us but he led us to a rock that was higher than our ourselves and to recognize that that our living God that is that is present right here in the Church of the Living God right now is here to lead you through every circumstance through through every trial of life through every little detail and we recognize that God took a picture of us before the foundation of the world and and we recognize that brother Brandon would tell us that God took that picture of us when we were at our best now a lot of times if we would get it in our own human capacity to be able to look at our what we think of us as our best we would think of us after we've won the Victory and we're carrying on the Triumph enjoying the spoils of Victory or or maybe it's when we're not maybe we would think about ourselves of being our at our best is when we when we don't have problems going on or when things are not going when things are going according to what we would say when things are peachy as we would say but God doesn't look like we look we look into the human eye but God is looking through the Eternal eye of almighty God and he's looking at us in our best and I recognize and we recognize that that man a man isn't man isn't always God didn't take that picture of us when we were in our lowest he didn't take that picture of us when we were at a horse but he took that picture of us when we were at our best and there though there are things in our life that have come against us that have made us better people their struggles in our life that has came against us calamities and storms and trials that have made us a better people and we would think that we were at our worst moments right there but it's in our worst moments that the best is brought out of us you see it's our trials that are more precious than gold that make us make us rich in our Lord Jesus Christ and it's not necessarily the good times that God makes us the best that we are it's in the worst of Trials and in the worst of and the worst of our circumstances where God shows up and he shows out and we recognize that he was the one that was carrying us when we looked like back on the beaches of the sands of time and we thought that we were all alone it was a time that he was carrying us when we thought we'd never make it when our friends left us when our family left us he was there all the time and I think it's a wonderful thing tonight to know that he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and to think that tonight that he's been the one that was leading you through your move and leading you through your jobs and leading these through your spiritual life and he said I'll be there with you even in you till the end of the world you see if I want to see you at your best I don't look at you when you ain't got troubles but I look at you when you're in the midst of your troubles because when you are in the midst of your trials it brings out the real you you'll find out who you really are you'll find out if you're really a real Christian if you if you if you're down and you bare Knuckles and you and you're digging your way out of the ditches you'll find out if you really got the goods or not if you're in the midst of a trial that's where God wants to find you now to me now to me now Jesus was good when he healed the Widow and Lanes it need a widow of main sun and it raised him up when they were tearing him out on a coffin to me Jesus was good when he walked out there and he healed Lazarus and brought him back from the dead to me Jesus was really good when he walked out there on the waters and he called the Seas and he told them not to fear I am the one that will calm your troubles add to me Jesus was good when he walked out there and he healed the lepers to me Jesus was good when he fed the five thousand to me Jesus was good when he turned the water into wine but to me when I look at Jesus when Jesus was at his best is when Jesus was coming up now goth is here and he was tearing a cross and it was more than just a wooden cross he was carrying my sins he was carrying your sins if I want to see Jesus at his best I look at him at Calvary and he said oh Hallelujah it is finished you see Jesus wasn't his best at his birth he was at his best at his death you see there's something on the inside of you that is driving you or leading you to be at your best when you're in your worship moments and to think that he's had his hands on you the whole time to look back over the span of your life and to think that Jesus was there he gives great consolation to know when you're going through a battle Brother Ray that Jesus was there he gives us wonderful consolation and fear and fear can be rolled back because of faith when it Rose in recognizing that he's had you in his hands the whole time because you see if you can look back and see that Jesus had you then you can look back and look at right now and say Jesus has got me now and brother Madam would tell us in in different messages he said it was somebody that led you in your first step if you go back and study out the message leadership it'll bless you really it'll bless you really good but brother Byron would say that he said when you took your first step somebody had to leave you he was a mama that had to lead you or a daddy that was there or somebody had to leave you he said the very last step you take in this life it'll be somebody that'll lead you out he said but Jesus likened us undefeated he said sheep will go astray sheep will go wondering because we need a shepherd and you see the shepherd is going to lead us under Green Pastures he's going to lead us to where we're going to eat real sheep food and you find that if you start if you start being led over to something that ain't sheep food seed food if you're being led over there to eat on some hamburger or ground up beef you'll find that you've got a Shepherd that's trying to feed you something that isn't necessarily Seafood but there is a Shepherd that knows exactly what is a sheep's diet and he feeds them a seven course menu of Malachi 4 and it'll produce some body change in the body when when everybody else wants to lead them lead them to church or lead them to an idea this message leads you right back to our Lord Jesus Christ this didn't lead us to a man this didn't lead us to an idea but this led us to the one that paid the ultimate price for you and I foreign I'm so thankful to be led by a Shepherd that knows how to lead a sheep but are you going to listen in there and studying out that message oh on leadership that brother random goes in there and he deals he deals with a rich young ruler and he also deals he deals with two Rich Young rulers right there and I know you're very aware of these things because you've been taught to listen to the message but you recognize that bear brother random is diving into a man's life his life as a Rich Young Ruler he was a possessor of a lot of things he had a lot of riches he had a lot of he had a lot of things in life and but yet there was something in his life that he was lacking because you see you see he had he gained everything that he gained in this world he had gathered knowledge of how to be a good businessman he had respected the traditions of the law and he'd come to Jesus and he said unto him Master what good things shall I do that I may have eternal life and Jesus said well I call us thou me good he said there's none good but one that is but God if thou will enter into life keep his commandment and hear this Rich Young Ruler he began to ask him said now what about which Commandments are you asking me to to keep and he began to lay out the law of what what Moses had said there and he said well I've done all of those things but then he asked him he asked him or he told him he said if thou will be perfect go and sell all that you have and come and follow me but there brother random said that he went away sad he said because he was he had very great riches in his life you see he led those he let those riches lead him his life he let business re lead him in life but when it come to the Prince of Life he wouldn't let him lead him he had all the Traditions down but he wouldn't let the one that wrote the law lead him so he really wasn't living out the law anyway because the leader wasn't on the inside of him is that right but to think that he would deny the very leadership of almighty God to think that he would turn this down and when he because he had great riches you see if sedition was good enough for him if tradition or the letter was enough he would have never been at the feet of Jesus are you with me a lot of you come out of denominationalism but if it was enough you would have never been at the feet of this message you see legalism and intellectualism and denominationalism will never be enough to bring you under Perfection but the one that wrote the word that is the word is here to lead you well you can't make it work out where where you can't make it live every single one of you that were raised in this message you heard it from the from the time that you were in diapers and you could quote every quote you could tell almost every story but until the leader got there until the one that could talk to you and lead you out of trouble now he didn't just lead you into good things but he led you out of bad things I'm telling you right now the God that I serve is a god that'll lead you to blessings and he leads you right out of the devil's trap I'm gonna say this I know that there's some people that are still ensnared or trapped up but the leader of the Holy Ghost is here to lead you right out of the Trap of the devil yeah yeah you see this rich young man when he come down our Young Ruler all of his religion had belonged to the church and everything fine educated fine businessman and everything when he come to the end of the road he began to scream he began to scream there's nowhere for me to step he so where's his leadership he'd been led by his church which was dead he had been led up by a dead world and there was nothing for him to step into but what the world had prepared for it was hell that was the only place that he could be led to because the world and the life that he was living was leading him to destruction but here is another Rich Young Ruler that brother Brandon brings out and it's Moses that Moses was a rich young ruler and he forsook Egypt because he endured I seeing him who is invisible and to think to think that Moses had all of Egypt at his fingertips but the Bible said that he held out he endured I sing him who is invisible he had he had all of Egypt at his fingertips all he had to do was deny the vision that he had caught up there on that mountain and he could have went back to being Pharaoh but instead of being led by his own wants or being led by his own desires he was led by the vision or the Revelation that he taught a player at the experience of the burning bush thank you what was it he refused to be one with the people of each you see before the experience Moses was coward and he never felt spiritually he never felt spiritually fit to lead the great Army of people but was afterward he'd come in contact with the bush that fire that burnout that he endured as seeing him who is invisible you see he was better qualified for the job five minutes after he'd met the Lord in the burning bush with an experience you see you can never come in contact with almighty god without having an experience you see God has no grandchildren you see my little daughters have got to have the same experience that I had they've gotten to meet the same one that I met and if you expect to get out of this layout of cnh you're going to have to meet the one that wrote the Bible the one that showed up for Noah the one that showed up for Isaiah the one that showed up for Daniel when the Daniel was up there in a lion's den brother Madam said he was so full of the Holy Ghost that the Lions couldn't eat him I'll say that the Church of the Living God is so full of the Holy Ghost that layout of sea is going to have to just push us out of this whole world [Applause] what is it it's Jehovah that is leading us he come in contact with him for five minutes and he was better equipped than all of his 80 years to think he had somewhere that he could put his foot down you ever wondered you ever wondered through life and felt like you could never get a foothold but David said Lord increase my footsteps that I'll have a large place to land at you see you've got to have a place that you can land that and David would say in Psalm 61 that when I am overwhelmed Lord lead me to a rock that is higher than I when I can't get through it when I can't get over it when I can't get under it lead me to the Rock lead me when I'm into searching when I'm in depression when I'm in exams anxiety Lead Me To The Rock this was two Rich Young rulers one took the way of Destruction but one he took the reproach of Christ he refused Egypt and he took on the reproach of Christ he esteemed it greater than the riches of down there in Egypt but I wonder today if we esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than the riches of laodicea I wonder if we I wonder if we would refuse if God commanded us to do such and such and to turn down lay on us here I wonder if we would esteem him greater I wonder if we turn down everything if we turn down business if we turn down if we turn down everything that laodicea had to offer us because of Christ if you won't turn down anything if you won't turn down everything then it shows Who Your Leader is are you with me if you can't turn down what the world offers it shows you that there's another spirit that is leading you I want somebody that'll lead me to a revelation that's greater than myself I want somebody that'll lead me to a rock that is higher than my problems higher than my situation higher than cancer higher than anxiety higher than blood pressure I ain't just talking about natural things but I want somebody that can lead me lead me when I feel like nobody loves me lead me when I feel like nobody's for me lead me when every devil in Hell's got his gun trained against me I want somebody that'll Lead Me when friends forsake you when mothers leave you and fathers walk away from you I want somebody that'll lead me through life ask yourself would you rather give up your wife or would you rather give up your Christ if you can give up Jesus before you can give up your family members you've got something wrong in your life if you can give up Jesus before you can give up your job there's something else that's leading you but if you can give up your job if you can give up your family if you can give up your health if you can give up your wealth for Jesus Jesus will lead you I'm gonna tell you right now there's nowhere that God will lead you that the grace of God can keep you he will be there for the thick and thin he will be there whenever when the groceries are ran out when the money has come dry and the oil is spent and the meal is gone he's still the god of Elijah who let Elijah up there anyway who made those Ravens stop feeding him somebody was leading those Ravens and somebody was leading the prophet to go by a suit of my Woman's Place come on somebody who was the one that led Elijah by your way when the church World disowned him when they said they didn't want nothing to do with him who let Elijah by your way because you have been anointed by accepting this message it was almighty God that led Elijah by your way foreign behold I send you Elijah who let Malachi 4 by your way I'll say it's the same one that led the children of Israel you think when when Moses said got up there and he'd lived out his life 120 years old and he got up there and he couldn't cross over and he climbed upon that mountain and he looked over the hair and he looked across the mountain brother Madam said he looked over and he said there stood a rock that he could stand on it and he said the angels of God packed him right into the bosoms of God and he said he never died he said because 800 years later there he was up there on Mount Transfiguration still being led by the leadership of the Lord let me tell you your loved one Homer Fraser never died Charlie Spencer never died Lord schiffert never died come on somebody Ted Hensley never died Leo hinchland ever died because they stepped onto a rock that looked that took them to a place and in the morning between six and nine when we look out the window we'll see those ones that was led to Iraq Moses just stepped onto that rock and it took him and put packed him right into the bosom of God and if you have died to yourself on this world in this life the angels are coming pack you away but you can never die if he can lead you through your walk if he can lead you through your Christian Life he can lead you through death he'll be the one that'll take you over toward it and he'll lead you all the way I believe sister Cassie used to sing a song Jehovah's here to lead us all the way I believe that same one is here and by the Bible tells us in Exodus 23 and 20 that behold I send an angel before you to keep you all the way and brother random told us he said now if you want to catch a vision of what that angel looked like he said go over there in Exodus 13 and 21 he said and by the cloud by day and by the pillar of fire he led them and he took not away the cloud by night or Cloud by day nor the pillar of fire but I by night you see it was the same Angel Covenant that was leading them what was it that angel was the angel of the Covenant that stood there in Revelations chapter 10 it is that same angel that is here leading his church if he could lead them in a natural surely he can lead you in the spiritual you see they were simply the people of God until they were called out of Egypt then they were called The Church of God because you see they were called out of Egypt and what did this message say unto you little Bride come out of her my people what are you called you are the elect of God that all things are working together for the good of them that love God who are the called according to his purpose and to think that that he's the one that's leading you it's an amazing thought now brother random said here he said in the Samaritan Church age he said just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the holy spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues and interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the same leadership the spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was the leader of the people actually he was their King he was a father King he took care of Israel like a man takes care of his family he fed them fought their battles smoothed away their difficulties settled their problems and he just busied himself over them now to think I could go there and I could preach I could preach a series right there on busy and busying himself over top of you not just to gather the thought just from a second you imagine you taking care of your children and busy yourself over feeding them and taking care of them and making sure they got good shoes and they got good food on their on your table heaped Jehovah busied himself over the people they weren't the only nation to which he was truly God but one day they got to looking around and they saw the Philistines and other nations with Kings over them and it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him and Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God the word you see God had it in his mind the whole entire time that he was going to humanize the leadership and put it into humanity and put it in our Lord Jesus Christ but Satan put something on the inside of the Church of the Living God that they needed an Earthly King that they could look onto what did Satan do he simply got them ahead of the word of God you see God Satan knew that they were going to have to reproduce in the Garden of Eden he simply got ahead of God's word and I'm afraid that too many times even in the message ranks today we've got people that are trying to humanize the leadership of the Holy Ghost and trying to tell you you got to get it through intellectualism try to get into a handshake or listen to so many tapes they try to humanize the leadership of the Holy Ghost I'll say this God Almighty Soul fit to take his picture with William Branham and I've only got to give account to listening to One Voice shouldn't this day I ain't got to listen to the preacher in Zimbabwe I ain't got to listen to the preacher over here or the preacher over there there is one voice and if God thought enough to take his picture with Malachi 4 I'll listen to The Voice that'll lead us right into a rapture we don't need to humanize the leadership of the Holy Ghost you ain't got to look to me all you got to do is look to the leadership of almighty God if you go to studying out Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 1 that they are Ezekiel was up there Ezekiel was up there he was among those amongst the captives they are in Babylon and the Bible went on to say that that the heavens were opened up and Ezekiel Saw Visions he was there in Babylon but the Holy Spirit began to open up heaven and show him the living creatures it showed him the face of a man he showed him thy Ox it showed him the it showed him the line it showed him the eagle anointing what was it brother random told us he said those living creatures represented the Church of the Living God and there Ezekiel goes up there and he catches the the appearance of the glory of the Lord and you go to studying out Ezekiel you'll find you'll find that Ezekiel that Ezekiel begins to tell us exactly what the pillar of fire looked like and you match it up with the message of the hour it's according according to the word of God that Vera was a green yellowish Amber looking light and brother and the Bible said in Ezekiel chapter 1 that the appearance it had the appearance of fire and Amber Amber look and it covered them from the Lord's up loins upward and the loins downward what was it a sign it was not the Lord but it was the glory of the Lord that was covering the church it was a covering of the church and William Brandon was said now now that same pillar fire that Amber looking greenish light that has followed me all the days of my life he said it's here in this room he said it's proof that the Lord is here it's proof that the Lord is here you can go and listen to him look it up on on your apps and look it up through the message every time he talked about that pillar fire that greenish Amber looking life as it moves in and he works over this congregation he works over this patient he begins to tell them the very secrets of the heart I see I see you're not from here you're not an American you're a Canon you're from Canadia you're from you're a Canadian and and I see you you've come here you've got you've got this cancer problem and that purifier is standing over you you feel it right now you're aware of that there's somebody that's standing over top of you now who touched you you're more than 50 feet away from me I didn't touch you it had to be him what was it there was a prophet that was standing there and telling you that there was a the very same one that was leading the children of Israel that was standing over top of this person and it was telling them the very secrets of their heart what was it it was the man of God being led by the pillar of Fire you go to studying out you go to studying out the with that picture there in Green Grass Valley California where the seven licks of fire that that showed up when the photographer he said take a picture he snapped a picture and it's perfectly it's perfectly in line or it looks exactly like it is and the Holy Spirit said take another picture and everything is magnified and the spirit of the Living God is there in the seven licks of fire and the lion of the tribe of Judah and brother Brandon would tell us he said now if you look at that picture he said you'll see standing behind me is my old Indian nature back there he said it he said every he said it's always there and it's standing right there and it'll tell you certain things but you're not under the leadership of that Hallelujah and bear that pillar fire showed up signs has even shown itself that the pillar of fire is back amongst the Church of the Living God and we recognize that the Bible has told us that Jesus said that I came from God and I go back to God and we recognize that when Jesus that Jesus is that pillar fighter who was it a bear that met Peter in the prison house and smote him on the side and said get up it was the same Lord Jesus Christ who wasn't up there when Paul was on the road to Damascus and he said Lord Lord what are you what are you doing here he said Gee he said Paul it's hard for you to King against the prince what was it it was the same Lord Jesus Christ in the pillar of Fire now Paul being a Hebrew scholar would have never called him Lord unless he knew it was our Lord laughs what was it Jesus had returned back to the pillar of Fire what was it when they were up there on the day of Pentecost and they were up there in one town and in one mind in one Accord they were up there in unity now brother Baron told us he said this church he said you're not divided he said but when you come under the unity when you come under the unity of the Holy Spirit he said just like he separated himself in cloven tongues up there on the day of Pentecost he separated himself amongst the church I think it's amazing when you begin to think about God separating himself and putting him part of himself inside of brother Doug a part of himself in in brother Lawrence a part of himself and Sister Mary and sister Katie that God has departed or separated himself amongst his church and brother random said when you come under Unity under the word that Jesus left us where to agree touching one thing Let It Be he said there if two agree coming in my name there I will be in the midst of them and to think that tonight that when you come here you wasn't just LED here by your own feeling you were LED here by somebody and you begin to move into the rhythm of the worship you begin to feel the anointing of God as he come down and worship are you with me you know what I'm saying the song leader come out here he began to wake up your spiritual Soul he began to Lead You In songs of Zion and he began to awaken the spiritual aptitude of your life he began to call you out of the darkness of laodicea into the light of worship because when you are in worship you are at your closest to God foreign I'll give you a profit I'll give you a profits quote he said good old singing he's the backbone of a meeting if you want to have church in here get under the inspiration of the music it's the backbone of this meeting you watch it's making a way but what was it the song was leading you to a place of worship leading you to a place of worship so that the word could come forth and it could bring you to a spot that is higher than yourself what is it it's bringing you to a place though that you're not looking at yourself no more but you're being led to look to the one that is higher than yourself how many had some troubles this week what did the music do it caused the spirit of God to come close to you if there's ever a time in your life when you don't feel God loves you and you don't feel like God is around you if you can go to worshiping God for five minutes just give God five minutes of your day and you'll find out if God loves you you ain't got to give him an hour give him five minutes and I guarantee you if you give him five minutes of your day he'll give you the rest of your day with him [Music] [Applause] foreign what happened Paul and silence got up there praying and they began singing a player what were they doing they brought Heaven down what happened Ezekiel was caught up in the midst of Babylon in the midst of a Godless Society he was caught up and he saw the glory of almighty God you go to setting out Revelations chapter four number two you go to studying out in 1960 brother Branham tells us all about that greenish amber light tells us what the pillar fire looked like he said nephil go to studying out those same colors are represented in that rainbow he said he'd go down through there he said you watch he said it's the same colors that is being pushed out through that Covenant that God wouldn't destroy this world again he said but if you look at it it only covered half of the Earth he said but when John goes over there in Revelations chapter 1 he looks over there and the Halo of light is covering all of the Throne of God and to think that tonight you are under a covenant Hallelujah you are under a covenant that is covered by our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get away from him you can't hide from him Hallelujah and I want you to remember that God still exists in them same colors the holy spirit is still in his power still in his church in the last days he said those living creatures represent the Living Church the church that's living by the power and the resurrection of Christ this same Amber colors has covered it ain't no wonder ain't no wonder when John saw the mighty angel that his feet were as pillars of Fire now you done heard this a thousand times but on your lowest day when you feel like you're the very bottom of the body you're the very skin on the very bottom of the feet you can still tell the devil you're over top of him and you are covered with the pillar of Fire I uh y'all better let me loose for a minute because I'm gonna tear down something here in a minute you don't have to tell me you can run every devil and hell out of Helton tonight to know that you are covered by the very Pillar of Fire you can go out of here recognizing that you're covered you can't get away from it you can't hide from it you can't get away from God he's covered this church with himself Satan can pit us in a corner but God will get us out he can pin us with cancer he can pin us down with tuberculosis but God will get us out it's a pill or fire that's leading the Church of the Living God right into the coming of the Lord [Applause] through destruction he's leading you through victory why don't you go ahead and tear your strongholds down why don't you go ahead and tear depression down it's got no hold on the Church of the Living God what's cancer to the pillar of Fire you pass through a neighborhood and make tumors leave he can pass through the neighborhood and make gardeners leave why don't you let him pass through this room tonight you walked in here one way why don't you let him lead you out another way I tell you it's proof that the pillar of fire is amongst the Church of the Living God when young girls and young boys start turning down this layout of seeing flu and say well down with this devil and we're living with Jesus down with suicide down with depression down with anxiety downward stigmas down with complexes I ain't found one complex that God can't lead you out of I ain't found one stick mother God can't lead you out of it's a devil allegian to think that you're still going to live that way but the power of the Living God says come out of her my people foreign still delivers from suicide I'm here to tell you that he still delivers from homosexuality I'm here to tell you that it delivers from pornography I'm here to tell you that he delivers from Barren wounds I'm here to tell you that he still gives the Holy Ghost I'm here to tell you that he still delivers I'm here to tell you that it still saves I'm here to tell you that he's bigger than cancer [Applause] if he would leave Malachi 4 to a platform after platform after platform and he would show us a cancer couldn't have a hold he'd show us that anxiety show us that the cloak of the shadow of death that would be upon this sister and all of a sudden it's gone he didn't just lead him here so that we could look to one man and say my I wasn't that good I believe it's here I believe it's in this body I believe it's in this church I believe it's all around the world what happens in your prayer room what happens in your prayer room and you start taking down requests and you start calling on somebody that you ain't even thought about for a month and a half too much you ain't even seen them and somebody comes in the room with you and starts telling you why don't you pray for brother Vijay why don't you pray for sister Linda what is it somebody is leading you to a rock and if he leads you to a rock he's good enough to get you out of it and he's good enough to get the one you're praying for out of the trouble that they're in you can be in your prayer you can be in your prayer room you can be down on your knees and it feels like all of Heaven is surrounded you you can't even feel the weight of the world anymore on you what is it somebody has taught you how to pray Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen who taught you how to pray such powerful prayers who taught you how to speak in tongues who taught you how to dance who taught you how to worship who taught you how to amen who taught you how to listen to the word it was Jehovah the one that led the Church of the Living God is leading this bride oh boy the Brandon said that the pill or fire would have returned in this generation would return in this generation and it would manifest the son of man he said dogmas Creeds denominationalism will never hinder it [Laughter] did not hinder the pillar of Fire coming back and manifesting the son of man it didn't hinder us it hasn't hindered our worship it hasn't hindered our praise it hasn't hindered our breakthrough what is it it's a pillar of fire leading somebody's going to be like the one leper 10 of them got healed but one of them returned and gave thanks who's going to be the one that walks back and give thanks to the son of man because he brought a pillar of fire that drive the leprous condition out of your life when you couldn't overcome sin in your own life when you couldn't overcome your troubles in your own life the one that had the power over leprosy I heard brother Chris pray in his prayer come to the always I can't get to every one of you no man of God can touch you but that pill or fire can just sweep past you how many times have we heard it not just in brother Brandon's day but right here in this day how many times have we heard it that I was dealing with this shoulder condition I was dealing with this backache you know I had this I had this tendonitis and I had this I had this problem and all of a sudden I just felt this warm presence come over me and I I didn't even think about it but I began to Worship the Lord and after I worship I recognized that it was gone I was up for a dislocated shoulder surgery and Jason Jackson was preaching and there was a there was a hand that laid its hand on my shoulder and I couldn't even told you after that night which shoulder it was that I was needing surgery on because when God does something he does it right when we get a testimony of 95 cancer free of my brother Joseph I say when God does something he does it right if doctors can say 95 they're going to have to agree with 100 of Isaiah 53 and 5. I say that it was the same one that walked through these aisles that worked through this body that calls the son of man to pray cancer be gone and you watch cancer leave the body cancer leave the soul tell me who can stand against the name of the most high God tell me what weapon can be formed against this church and it Prosper I'll say of God before this church ain't no devil and Hell going to be able to stop us [Applause] I was one way and he come and caught me and me turned me down another path foreign if you knew me before and you know the guy afterwards you'll find that somebody turned the steering wheel somebody took over and took control I'm a very emotional human being but if you really get me alone with almighty God I'm quiet as a church mouse you get me up in my prayer room and all of a sudden he's got me by the shoulders all I can do is cry but you get me out here under the burden of this word and he'll think what in the world's got a hold of that wild man it's somebody that's taken over now you watch you watch men of God you watch men like you liked when men like our our precious friend brother Joe Greene he's quiet but you watch him you watch him get behind the pulpit he'll get fired up what is it it's somebody leading him under the burden of the word you want somebody that's necessarily that that is conservative in their own emotion and you watch the spirit of the Living God get on them what is it somebody is leading them you watch you watch brother let's just you watch brother Ron he's a Statesman you watch brother Donnie he's a Statesman gentlemen real gentleman but you watch the spirit of living God get on top of them man they get LED and they roll around on the ground and they'll they'll jump and scream and holler it's somebody it is an anointing that is causing the preaching of the word to come forth because of my the foolishness of preaching men are saved not foolish preaching but by the foolishness of preaching he'll make you rolling around on the ground just to make an illustration to show that you're not being led by yourself you'd never be here you wouldn't be in the building if it wasn't for him but aren't you glad that somebody come now your way if he went by legion's way and he got him out of 2 000 demon shackles surely he can get you out of your mess why don't you stand to give God praise In The House of the Living God I want his leadership over man's leadership and I want his word over top of man's opinion [Applause] oh how of Jesus [Music] oh how I love Jesus [Music] because he first love me sing it all how I love Jesus [Music] [Music] Jesus because [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] because he first [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus because [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh I have nothing [Music] to take my voice [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] have nothing or without you and treat my body [Music] [Applause] [Music] of love for I have nothing oh I have nothing without you take my time and take my time or here on this Earth and let me glorify all the truth our words foreign [Music] alone foreign [Music] other side he brought he brought my way never lift my feet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] goes he promised to [Music] dream s promises [Music] may have to walk in the valley of death foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] never lift my feet you're dismissed but may you have to walk over the water with me but I don't have to hurry with my sweet oh no it's almost [Music] us for both sides these promises [Music] he promised to hell [Music]
