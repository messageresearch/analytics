[1:17:51] folks even from our home church that's
[1:17:53] here with us tonight and I want to thank
[1:17:56] them for coming
[1:17:58] amen means a lot and it drives 16 hours
[1:18:01] to hear you preach when they could have
[1:18:03] waited to Wednesday night we'll be back
[1:18:05] big man but uh that ain't just why they
[1:18:08] came they came to be in the presence of
[1:18:10] God amongst God's people and put her
[1:18:13] shoulder to the wheel and amen and
[1:18:16] amen Just To See God do Mighty things
[1:18:19] among us I'm believing for that I'm
[1:18:21] believing for miracles to take place
[1:18:23] because he's a miracle-working god
[1:18:25] amen Isaiah 40 and verse 25 says to whom
[1:18:29] then will you liken me or shall I be
[1:18:33] equal saith the Holy One
[1:18:36] lift up your eyes on high and behold who
[1:18:39] hath created these things that bringeth
[1:18:42] out their hosts by number
[1:18:44] he calleth them all by names by the
[1:18:48] greatness of his might for that he is
[1:18:51] strong in power and not one faileth not
[1:18:56] one faileth Ephesians 3 verse 20.
[1:19:00] it says now unto him that is able to do
[1:19:03] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:19:07] ask or think according to the power that

[1:19:15] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:19:18] ages World Without End Amen God bless
[1:19:22] you and be seated
[1:19:28] thank you
[1:19:34] I've been on this subject of light for
[1:19:37] some time at home and can't seem to get
[1:19:39] away from it amen I enjoy light
[1:19:42] amen I enjoy being in the places amen
[1:19:45] there's no Darkness I don't like
[1:19:46] Darkness I'm not a child of the dark
[1:19:48] amen I'm a Child of the Light how many
[1:19:50] children of the light tonight but I'd
[1:19:53] like to speak to you on the unlimited
[1:19:55] light the unlimited light Job chapter 11
[1:19:58] would say it like this he said can you
[1:20:00] solve the mysteries of God can you
[1:20:04] discover everything about the almighty
[1:20:07] such knowledge is higher than the
[1:20:09] heavens and who are you it is deeper
[1:20:12] than the underworld what do you know it
[1:20:16] is broader than the earth and wider than
[1:20:19] the sea in other words there's really no
[1:20:21] ability of a limited being Amen to
[1:20:25] describe an unlimited being
[1:20:27] see God has no Rivals not only that he
[1:20:30] is the one a man who measures and
[1:20:32] decrees the boundaries by which his
[1:20:35] creation abides there is none like our
[1:20:38] God the god of the Bible is incomparable
[1:20:41] infinitely above his creation to say
[1:20:44] that anyone or anything is like him is
[1:20:47] to try to express the unlimited and
[1:20:50] limited terms any comparison will fall
[1:20:53] short just as the authors of the
[1:20:55] scripture search for an adequate human
[1:20:58] language to apply to Heavenly Visions we
[1:21:01] find ourselves also ill-equipped to
[1:21:04] express God's Perfections even as the
[1:21:07] children of Israel would stand on that
[1:21:08] Seashore and they saw all those
[1:21:11] wonderful things that had just taken
[1:21:12] place and and they've seen their enemy
[1:21:15] that was dead behind them and they saw a
[1:21:17] God who was able to deliver them and and
[1:21:20] to set them free and they would begin to
[1:21:21] say who is Like You O Lord among the
[1:21:24] gods who is like you Majestic in
[1:21:27] Holiness awesome and glorious Deeds
[1:21:30] doing wonders even David would say who
[1:21:33] is like the Lord Our God who is Seated
[1:21:36] on high who looks far down on the
[1:21:38] heavens and the Earth the answer is no
[1:21:41] one is like him there's no one there's
[1:21:43] no one like Jesus amen creation exists
[1:21:47] and within the limits of time and the
[1:21:49] limits of space cannot rival much less
[1:21:52] much less fully articulate the splendors
[1:21:55] of a limitless God unlimited means not
[1:21:59] limited or restricted in terms of number
[1:22:02] quality or extent it's not limited it's
[1:22:05] having an infinite number of solutions
[1:22:08] I'm glad he's got an infinite number of
[1:22:10] solutions amen I'm glad I don't get the
[1:22:13] number whatever billion zillion and he's
[1:22:15] run out of solution but he hasn't run
[1:22:17] out tonight amen unlimited is also an
[1:22:20] inexhaustible it's Limitless it's
[1:22:23] boundless it's unbounded it's immense
[1:22:26] it's vast great extensive and measurable
[1:22:30] incalculable unfailing Untold
[1:22:33] Everlasting infinite endless
[1:22:35] never-ending bottomless measureless
[1:22:37] unrestricted unconstrained uncontrolled
[1:22:40] unrestrained unchecked unhindered
[1:22:43] unhampered unimpeded unfettered
[1:22:46] untrammeled amen unbridled uncurved
[1:22:49] absolute full utter ultimate Supreme
[1:22:52] Sovereign and omnipotent hallelujah what
[1:22:56] a mighty God we serve tonight amen amen
[1:23:00] exhaustible it's unable to be used up
[1:23:03] amen unrestricted unconstrained
[1:23:06] untrammeled I I looked at that word
[1:23:08] untraveled not deprived of Freedom or
[1:23:11] action amen incalculable it's too great
[1:23:14] to be calculated amen that's the god
[1:23:17] that we serve he's not you know it's
[1:23:19] funny how men can put him in a little
[1:23:21] box but you can't put this God in your
[1:23:23] box he's too big for your box amen he's
[1:23:26] a God who goes beyond human reasonings
[1:23:29] and human understandings and he does
[1:23:31] things that we don't know and we can't
[1:23:33] even think we don't even know how it's
[1:23:34] going to work out but somehow he does it
[1:23:36] we don't know how he's going to do it
[1:23:38] but somehow he did it we don't know how
[1:23:40] he's going to heal but somehow he did it
[1:23:42] amen we don't know how he's going to set
[1:23:44] free but somehow he does it he's that
[1:23:46] kind of God he's an unlimited God and I
[1:23:49] just want to look into this tonight he
[1:23:51] said brother Brandon would say it like
[1:23:52] this he said I've noticed among our
[1:23:54] Brethren many of you as coming to Full
[1:23:57] Gospel people coming from the Baptist
[1:23:59] Church myself and accepting the doctrine
[1:24:01] of the baptism the Holy Spirit he said I
[1:24:03] want how Martin Luther had a had a part
[1:24:06] in justification he preached it he
[1:24:08] believed it he said it was the light of
[1:24:09] his day and but then he he entered he
[1:24:12] entered into another Veil a man John
[1:24:14] Wesley he said when Calvinism was
[1:24:17] beginning to sweep the nation and they
[1:24:18] settled down saying what God's going to
[1:24:21] do he'll do and no it does us no good to
[1:24:24] have a Revival but God raised up John
[1:24:26] Wesley and he certainly smashed
[1:24:28] Calvinism to the ground to the place
[1:24:30] where it ought to have a right balance
[1:24:32] in the works of sanctification and the
[1:24:34] work of Grace nazarenes carried it
[1:24:36] Pentecostals character and the baptism
[1:24:38] the Holy Spirit moving on and off to
[1:24:40] higher Heights he said but when the
[1:24:42] Brethren received the baptism the Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost he said this is the summit this is
[1:24:47] the all of it but Brethren that's wrong
[1:24:49] there's no Summit to God's power
[1:24:53] there's no Summit to God's power we move
[1:24:56] on and on and on it's unlimited
[1:24:59] resources of God that hasn't even been
[1:25:02] tapped into yet blessings and powers
[1:25:05] that we know nothing about
[1:25:07] hallelujah it's never been even revealed
[1:25:10] to the archangels but it's laying just
[1:25:12] ahead for his church that will believe
[1:25:14] how many Believers here tonight for I
[1:25:17] has not seen Ear Has Not Heard neither
[1:25:20] is enter into the hearts of men what God
[1:25:22] has in store for them that love him he
[1:25:25] said so let's just continue to move on
[1:25:28] up and claim our rights
[1:25:30] he said God opened the gates and he
[1:25:33] swings out the welcome mat let's move
[1:25:35] into deeper depths and never colonize
[1:25:38] ourselves or organize ourselves and get
[1:25:40] into a place where we believe this and
[1:25:43] that's all let's believe this plus how
[1:25:46] much more we can hear from God he said I
[1:25:48] think that ought to be the motive of
[1:25:50] every man woman Amen to love that loves
[1:25:53] the Lord Jesus is to receive all that
[1:25:55] you can from the hand of his Bountiful
[1:25:58] mercies that's my heart
[1:26:00] [Applause]

[1:26:03] Cup's full tonight amen God wants to
[1:26:06] give you more exceedingly abundant even
[1:26:09] more than you can ever think or ask I

[1:26:13] God tonight you say well I've been
[1:26:15] around the message for 40 years you
[1:26:17] ought to be progressing every day of
[1:26:18] your life you ought to be moving up
[1:26:20] there is no Summit to the power of
[1:26:22] almighty God therefore there's no Summit
[1:26:25] Amen to the Holy Ghost there's no Summit
[1:26:27] to his ability to heal and deliver and
[1:26:30] set free God has a constantly unveiling
[1:26:34] and revealing himself to his children
[1:26:37] Hallelujah see if you can limit God you
[1:26:40] can limit Christ and if you live it to
[1:26:42] church today and its possibilities
[1:26:44] you're limiting God but all things
[1:26:48] whatsoever you desire When you pray
[1:26:50] believe you receive them and ye shall
[1:26:53] have them he said it I believe it and I
[1:26:56] know it to be the truth

[1:27:06] there maybe for your protection and
[1:27:08] safety and things uh you know the number

[1:27:20] to be there to indicate amen you can't
[1:27:22] go any higher or you can't reach any
[1:27:24] higher than that he said but see he said
[1:27:28] most definitions of the word limit
[1:27:29] expresses a point or a level Beyond
[1:27:33] which something is not to extend or pass

[1:28:42] signs 150 years ago made a statement
[1:28:46] that if a man went with the terrific
[1:28:48] speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation
[1:28:51] would take him off the Earth he reckon
[1:28:53] science would say stand by that today no
[1:28:56] no because he was riding on aux card do
[1:28:59] you think science looks back that today
[1:29:00] and says that's the truth no they're
[1:29:02] going hundreds and even hundreds more
[1:29:04] miles an hour than that in a jet plane
[1:29:06] still going and moving further brother
[1:29:08] said it like this he said we're up to
[1:29:11] the place where we can believe in the
[1:29:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost we can believe
[1:29:15] in the healing of the sick he said but
[1:29:18] let's move on to the resurrection of the
[1:29:20] dead and the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:29:23] Christ
[1:29:25] amen we're not just happy here we're
[1:29:28] moving forward amen we're moving on down

[1:29:36] Christ's gonna rise we got people over
[1:29:39] there we want to see and we're looking
[1:29:41] for most of all we want to see our Lord
[1:29:43] Jesus Christ amen the church though
[1:29:47] cannot Camp down on the things that
[1:29:49] we're seeing around us and say this is
[1:29:51] all there's no Summit to the power of
[1:29:54] almighty God as signs can only go so far
[1:29:57] that it falls back but we have untapped
[1:30:01] Resources by Divine promise from none
[1:30:04] other than the Son of God saying
[1:30:06] whatsoever you ask in my father's name I
[1:30:10] will do it
[1:30:15] Hallelujah
[1:30:17] amen Isaiah 50 you say well I don't know
[1:30:19] I think this and I think that well I'm
[1:30:21] glad we're not going on your thoughts
[1:30:25] amen amen but Isaiah 55 verse 8 says my
[1:30:29] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[1:30:31] are your ways my ways saith the Lord for
[1:30:34] as high as the heavens are higher than
[1:30:36] the earth so are my ways higher than
[1:30:39] your ways
[1:30:41] and my thoughts are higher than your
[1:30:43] thoughts amen I'm sure thankful that I'm
[1:30:45] not dependent on what some man thinks
[1:30:47] about me if I'm going to make it if I'm
[1:30:49] not going to make it I'm sure thankful
[1:30:51] that I'm not dependent on a God who one
[1:30:53] day thinks one thing about me and the
[1:30:55] next day he thinks somebody something
[1:30:57] else and it changes his mind but God
[1:30:59] thought about you before the foundation
[1:31:02] of the world and they ain't a devil in
[1:31:04] hell that can change his mind about you
[1:31:08] Hallelujah in the where were you at Job
[1:31:10] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:31:13] when the morning Stars sang and the sons
[1:31:15] of God shouted for joy
[1:31:19] that's where I was and the thoughts of
[1:31:21] almighty God and he still has you in his
[1:31:24] mind
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:29] Hallelujah
[1:31:31] amen I'm told he said I'm told by
[1:31:34] aviators who fly these fast jet planes
[1:31:37] that if all of a sudden it'll get to a
[1:31:39] certain speed and it'll go to vibrating
[1:31:40] and shake it seems like the boats are
[1:31:42] going to fly off and the wings are going
[1:31:44] to come off until they pass the sound
[1:31:46] barrier
[1:31:49] amen the devil wants to put a barrier
[1:31:51] there some of you he's placed a barrier
[1:31:54] by bitterness and you can only go so far
[1:31:56] and you can only go so fast or he puts a
[1:31:59] barrier of unforgiveness there in front
[1:32:00] of you and you won't forgive and you
[1:32:02] won't let go and it stops you and it
[1:32:04] slows you down on the path of life but
[1:32:07] God wants you to break through those
[1:32:08] barriers
[1:32:10] matter of fact he set up a whole service
[1:32:12] tonight that you can tread your wings
[1:32:14] and you can bust through that barrier
[1:32:16] and you can go into all things are
[1:32:18] possible and you can rise above all the
[1:32:21] things in your life
[1:32:25] foreign
[1:32:29] get past those barriers well if we can
[1:32:32] get past that barrier and our thoughts
[1:32:35] and how we think it ought to be well I
[1:32:37] ain't like that song and I don't get
[1:32:38] past all of that
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:43] he said if the Church of this day will
[1:32:45] ever pray till they pass the sin barrier
[1:32:48] and the unbelief barrier they could
[1:32:51] shout the victory of a living God
[1:32:53] oh I see if you ain't got no shout you
[1:32:56] ain't got past the berry barrier yet
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:02] but the devil's trying to put a barrier
[1:33:04] there trying to put a restriction there
[1:33:06] you can only praise him so much you can
[1:33:09] only do so much you can only go so far
[1:33:12] and that's going to be fanaticism you're
[1:33:14] only going to do this and it's just a
[1:33:15] motion what's he doing he's trying to
[1:33:17] put limits and limitations on our
[1:33:19] worship
[1:33:20] on our praise to a living God
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:25] amen just not for too many miles from
[1:33:27] here is going to be a football game
[1:33:29] going on and then people are going to
[1:33:30] become Maniacs they're going to paint
[1:33:32] themselves up they're going to address
[1:33:33] the part they're going to look the part
[1:33:35] they're going to jump and act a fool
[1:33:37] over somebody passing a pig skin
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:42] well I mean if they can do that about
[1:33:44] some perverts running up and down the
[1:33:46] field how much more to the children of
[1:33:49] God ought to be the praise the Living
[1:33:52] God
[1:33:54] with living signs and living wonders
[1:33:57] living amongst the people
[1:34:01] yeah we got a reason to praise him we
[1:34:04] got a reason to shout I know what he
[1:34:07] done for me I know hey changed my life I
[1:34:10] know hey set me free
[1:34:16] and they want to call you crazy
[1:34:21] you're praising an unlimited God
[1:34:23] [Applause]
[1:34:28] they're praising a man that's going to
[1:34:30] go commit adultery in a few days
[1:34:33] it's hangs you're praising The God Who
[1:34:36] took your sin and he took your unbelief
[1:34:38] and he nailed it to a cross
[1:34:43] he took your sickness
[1:34:49] amen when you pass that barrier and you
[1:34:53] begin looking to the Unseen
[1:34:55] Hallelujah and letting the world vibrate
[1:34:58] and do what it wants to do
[1:35:02] goodbye world
[1:35:05] I stay no longer with you
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:11] there's a living God when we lose our
[1:35:13] disbelief and unbelief in him and pass
[1:35:16] that place that the world is saying the
[1:35:19] days of Miracles are passed
[1:35:21] it ain't even just the world anymore
[1:35:23] it's something the messages saying that
[1:35:28] but it makes you shake oh there's no
[1:35:30] such a thing as the baptism the Holy
[1:35:32] Ghost yeah some of the message is saying
[1:35:34] that
[1:35:35] it makes you wonder but if you'll just
[1:35:36] look at the Unseen to The God Who
[1:35:39] promised it
[1:35:40] for the promises unto you and your
[1:35:43] children to them that are far off even
[1:35:45] many as the Lord Our God shall call if
[1:35:48] you'll look to the Blessed word that
[1:35:49] says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:35:52] today and forever and turn your heads
[1:35:55] towards that and press on until you pass
[1:35:58] that vibration pass the unbelief
[1:36:01] barriers pass the sin barriers and all
[1:36:03] the things that hinder you then you'll
[1:36:05] fly free in the faith of God knowing
[1:36:08] that all things are possible then
[1:36:10] there's no limit
[1:36:13] did you hear that there's no limit to
[1:36:16] the speed that plane will go if there's
[1:36:18] no limit to the speed the plane will go
[1:36:21] there's no limits to the blessings that
[1:36:23] God will pour down upon a Believer who
[1:36:26] will believe
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:36] I was listening I was listening to a
[1:36:39] tape here the other day brother Brown
[1:36:40] said if a city had a 30 mile per an hour
[1:36:43] speed limit and when you would get a
[1:36:45] ticket if you went over that some of
[1:36:46] them you know they may give you a 10
[1:36:48] mile an hour grace period and and then
[1:36:50] they tell you well that's that's
[1:36:51] fanaticism oh sorry
[1:36:56] some of them one mile an hour and that's
[1:36:57] all you can go
[1:37:00] call them speed traps
[1:37:07] amen but if the mayor he said come and
[1:37:10] gave you said you refuse needing to get
[1:37:12] to a sick person or somebody that was in
[1:37:14] trouble you can go as fast as you need
[1:37:17] to go
[1:37:19] and this is words of the Prophet excuse
[1:37:21] he said if there's some two-bit cop
[1:37:23] stopped you for going 10 miles over the
[1:37:26] speed limit
[1:37:29] foreign
[1:37:30] he couldn't give you a ticket because
[1:37:33] you had been given permission to go
[1:37:35] beyond what the speed limit says
[1:37:39] he said I hope you're getting it you
[1:37:41] have been invited to go beyond what man
[1:37:44] has determined
[1:37:46] image have been taken off you can go
[1:37:49] into the unlimited power of the almighty
[1:37:52] God
[1:37:54] oh there were one-time limits placed on
[1:37:57] the church they were limited by a false
[1:37:59] baptism they were limited by believing
[1:38:01] in three gods they were limited by other
[1:38:03] things that were held against it but in
[1:38:05] this day the limiters have been ripped
[1:38:08] off and the limits can no longer be
[1:38:10] enforced
[1:38:13] did you hear that devil the limits can
[1:38:16] no longer be enforced
[1:38:21] therefore he can't limit my praise he
[1:38:24] can't limit my breakthrough he can't
[1:38:26] limit amen the things of God and the
[1:38:29] blessings he's going to pour out in my
[1:38:30] life he has no limitations
[1:38:35] he has no right
[1:38:45] amen they want to come put limits on
[1:38:47] your worship and say you can only go 40
[1:38:49] miles an hour rip that thing down
[1:38:51] [Applause]
[1:38:52] and I want us to put limits on your
[1:38:54] overcoming life so you can only go so
[1:38:56] far Rift that thing down we're living in
[1:38:59] a time that there's no limitation on the
[1:39:01] Church of the Living God
[1:39:03] she can go down the Divine Healing amen
[1:39:06] she can go to the body change
[1:39:09] what do you think he's trying to put
[1:39:10] limits on you because he knows there's a
[1:39:13] change coming
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:20] he said when you when the people realize
[1:39:22] that you are not you or you will be but
[1:39:25] you are present tense Sons and Daughters
[1:39:28] of God he said you're pushing out to the
[1:39:30] Millennium all the blessings out to the
[1:39:32] Millennium but it's right now
[1:39:34] we don't need Divine Healing in the
[1:39:36] Millennium it's now when we have it we
[1:39:39] won't be sons of gods we are now sons of
[1:39:42] God heirs and Joint heirs with Jesus and
[1:39:45] everything that Jesus died for
[1:39:48] is my possession
[1:39:52] he says brother Satan don't like that
[1:39:55] but if the people would only realize and
[1:39:59] just be willing to take God in his word
[1:40:01] well it's Unlimited
[1:40:05] in other words we don't have to pay
[1:40:07] attention to Satan's speed limits they
[1:40:10] don't obtain to us
[1:40:12] [Applause]
[1:40:13] don't listen to the church the other day

[1:40:20] first and I was in Germany and we got
[1:40:22] the chance to go on the Autobahn and

[1:40:52] freedom to be able to go as fast as I
[1:40:54] want to go
[1:40:57] amen here I mean listen we don't have to
[1:41:00] be in a little
[1:41:03] with the prophet of God let it craft a
[1:41:05] car running down the highway
[1:41:09] Hallelujah it'll drive down to Divine
[1:41:12] Healing it'll hit him down to all things
[1:41:14] are possible in a run over every devil
[1:41:17] that gets in front of him
[1:41:22] foreign
[1:41:26] my wife one day was on our way to church
[1:41:28] one one Wednesday night I believe I was
[1:41:30] getting ready to preach and I'm just
[1:41:32] driving the sun's kind of my eyes and
[1:41:33] the last moment I saw this snake right
[1:41:35] on the edge of the highway I didn't have
[1:41:37] time to dock to dodge nothing I was poop
[1:41:39] you heard him pop
[1:41:42] I looked and I seen him just waggling up
[1:41:43] over there that gasping his last breath
[1:41:47] or whatever they do and I said well
[1:41:49] I I didn't see that snake coming
[1:41:52] my wife looked at me said I don't think
[1:41:54] he saw you coming
[1:41:58] I prayed that when this meeting is
[1:42:01] up hello Devil he's withering around
[1:42:04] he didn't see you coming
[1:42:09] he'd been used to a little Ox car coming
[1:42:11] down the road where he can move out of
[1:42:13] the way but all of a sudden River Room
[1:42:15] right over his rotten stinking High

[1:42:31] home well

[1:42:37] he believed I think we can believe the
[1:42:39] same thing he believed

[1:42:55] over him and make him twist up and blow
[1:42:57] that old Blue Smoke

[1:43:12] we ain't paying attention to Satan's
[1:43:14] speed limits
[1:43:19] well
[1:43:20] the prophet of God didn't pay attention
[1:43:22] to it either
[1:43:23] he didn't care if he's in church or out
[1:43:25] in the woods anyway he didn't care what
[1:43:27] the devil had to say David all like no

[1:43:59] given permission to believe that cancer
[1:44:02] not even cancer was stand before us we
[1:44:05] didn't get permission to believe
[1:44:08] therefore I believe
[1:44:10] [Applause]
[1:44:17] he said he was out there in the
[1:44:19] wilderness and storm blew up
[1:44:22] it had ceased for a while and he walked
[1:44:25] out from behind the tree he was taking
[1:44:27] some cover and he said I heard an old
[1:44:28] bull elk began to bug one
[1:44:31] and said they'd kind of got he's trying
[1:44:33] to call the rest of the herd back
[1:44:34] together it got scattered during the
[1:44:35] storm

[1:45:13] happen to look back over and blowing
[1:45:14] cold enough to freeze the water in the
[1:45:16] Evergreens but the sun came up over the
[1:45:18] West this way and looked like a little
[1:45:20] aisle looking down like God looking at
[1:45:22] his Creation in the sunset and I noticed
[1:45:25] it caused the rainbow across the canyon

[1:46:01] a while I was looking at that I got so
[1:46:04] full of the Holy Ghost until I set my
[1:46:06] gun against a tree and I run around the
[1:46:08] tree just as hard as I could kicking up
[1:46:11] one foot in the air screaming to the top
[1:46:12] of my voice Hollow hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:16] hallelujah hallelujah and around and
[1:46:19] around and around until it almost fell
[1:46:21] down
[1:46:21] yeah
[1:46:23] he wasn't worried about too much order
[1:46:24] there
[1:46:27] had to stop him jerk my hands up in the
[1:46:29] air again and hollered glow all right
[1:46:30] Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah
[1:46:33] Hallelujah I'm just reading it I love
[1:46:35] you Hallelujah
[1:46:37] just as hard as I could run I couldn't
[1:46:40] think of nothing else to say
[1:46:42] my heart was bubbling over what was it
[1:46:45] it was a deep caller to the deep I heard
[1:46:48] God out yondering away that maybe you
[1:46:50] wouldn't hear him but to me he's in his
[1:46:52] Universe calling back I'm the god of
[1:46:54] creation I've made all things by my hand
[1:46:58] he said if somebody came in those woods
[1:47:00] they'd have thought they had a maniac
[1:47:02] round and around and around having me a
[1:47:05] glorious time
[1:47:07] that's 50 miles 30 miles anywhere from
[1:47:09] anybody as far as I knew around around
[1:47:11] the tree I went screaming because what
[1:47:13] it was God's Cathedral I could see him
[1:47:16] everywhere the Sun the streets coming
[1:47:17] through the woods the rainbow the Wolf
[1:47:20] Hall and the elk I could hear them in
[1:47:22] the winds Oh my he was everywhere way
[1:47:24] higher you could see the snow peaked on
[1:47:26] the Mountain Shadows off down to the
[1:47:27] Evergreens I looked everywhere you could
[1:47:29] see him he is in his Universe do you
[1:47:31] believe that but I stood there for a
[1:47:34] little bit and after a while I heard
[1:47:36] something going chatter chatter chatter
[1:47:38] chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:47:40] though what is that
[1:47:43] I looked around
[1:47:44] there was this old blow down there
[1:47:47] storm would blowed down some trees a
[1:47:49] storm previous and there was this little
[1:47:51] Pine squirrel I don't know whether you
[1:47:54] know what they are or not how many knows
[1:47:56] what a pine squirrel is
[1:47:58] he jumped up an old tree stumped there
[1:48:00] and just acting like he was about to
[1:48:02] have a fit going to try to tear him into
[1:48:04] pieces chatter chatter chatter jumping
[1:48:06] up and down shaking all over as hard as
[1:48:08] he could oh he was going to cut me up
[1:48:10] and I thought well little fella there's
[1:48:12] no need of getting all that excited
[1:48:14] there you're not going to do nothing no
[1:48:16] did I scare you or something well you
[1:48:19] ought to get what what what you scared
[1:48:20] about I was only praising God that made
[1:48:22] both of us
[1:48:24] there's no need of you getting all tore
[1:48:26] up I would
[1:48:31] that's why we need to tell to a few
[1:48:32] critics
[1:48:33] I'm only praising God that made both of
[1:48:36] us
[1:48:42] what are you getting scared about
[1:48:48] it's funny people not even in the
[1:48:49] presence of God and scared of it
[1:48:52] amen
[1:48:54] but here this little squirrel was giving
[1:48:56] himself a Time
[1:48:57] he says there's no need of you getting
[1:49:00] all tore up I was praising him so don't
[1:49:02] get all excited about that I was just
[1:49:04] praising God you ought to have no better
[1:49:06] than to holler at me like that
[1:49:08] don't interrupt to me when I'm shouting
[1:49:11] like that because I'm having a good time
[1:49:13] leave me alone
[1:49:20] now I hope you're catching it leave me
[1:49:23] alone so I happen to notice this little
[1:49:25] fellow would his head sideways and
[1:49:27] look down that brush when it come to
[1:49:29] find out he wasn't really barking to me
[1:49:31] out of that brush through the storm this
[1:49:33] big old Eagle had been forced down
[1:49:35] and he was smashed down like that blow
[1:49:37] down the blow down but that big fella
[1:49:39] with that little Pine squirrel was all
[1:49:41] that's what he's all excited about and
[1:49:42] he jumped up on a little hem I thought
[1:49:44] now wait a minute here there's something
[1:49:46] somewhere because I was worshiping God
[1:49:48] running around this tree I see him all
[1:49:50] these different elements but why has he
[1:49:52] interrupted me for such as this
[1:49:54] said there's an old he'll admire him can
[1:49:56] I see God in him and I begin to look at
[1:49:59] those great big looking eyes he looked
[1:50:02] there on that limb looking to me did you
[1:50:04] look at the squirrel and he looked back
[1:50:06] at me he'd look at that squirrel he'd
[1:50:08] look back at me he said I guess you're
[1:50:10] looking this over ain't you oh boy
[1:50:12] you know I could shoot you if I wanted
[1:50:14] to I looked up at him my rifle setting
[1:50:17] against the tree did you know I could
[1:50:18] shoot you if I wanted to he never paid
[1:50:20] no attention to that he just kept
[1:50:21] sitting there I thought what does God
[1:50:23] want me to see don't be afraid
[1:50:25] the Eagle's Brave he's not afraid
[1:50:28] he wouldn't be ashamed to tell his boss
[1:50:30] he got healed by Divine Healing
[1:50:34] it don't bother him he's strong he won't
[1:50:37] be afraid to testify if he received the
[1:50:39] Holy Ghost
[1:50:42] he's Brave I thought well what's what
[1:50:44] you saw what makes you so brave but I
[1:50:47] noticed he kept just kind of moving them
[1:50:49] two wings
[1:50:50] you know they move their feathers back
[1:50:51] and forth pulled their wings I thought
[1:50:53] oh I see uh-huh God gave you two wings
[1:50:56] and you know good and well you could
[1:50:58] take them two big wings and be out of
[1:51:00] the Timber before I could ever reach
[1:51:01] that rifle he had confidence in what God
[1:51:04] had given him he said how much different
[1:51:06] is it with the human being God gave us
[1:51:09] the Holy Ghost and still we don't know
[1:51:11] what it'll do for us it's unlimited what
[1:51:15] he will do
[1:51:16] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:51:19] pray believe you kitten and you shall
[1:51:21] have it that eagle could trust it is
[1:51:23] god-given wings
[1:51:27] he knew what he was talking about and we
[1:51:30] got the Holy Ghost and haven't tried it
[1:51:31] out
[1:51:33] he said that's where it's at if we just
[1:51:35] let nature work within us like the
[1:51:37] animal does try out what God has given
[1:51:40] you
[1:51:44] knew the distance where I was from my
[1:51:46] rifle he could be in the timber and I
[1:51:48] never see him again so he kept moving
[1:51:49] those big wings I said oh boy I never
[1:51:52] shoot you I'm so proud of you I like to
[1:51:55] see something that's got some spunk in
[1:51:57] it
[1:51:59] all right
[1:52:01] we don't need no wimpy dish rags
[1:52:06] well you ain't gonna believe Pastor what
[1:52:08] I
[1:52:09] would ask up my big time I bet you don't
[1:52:11] come say that here
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:29] we don't win no need no wimpy dish rags
[1:52:32] we need some people with some spunk in
[1:52:34] them
[1:52:37] time you come to the house of God with
[1:52:39] some spunk in you
[1:52:41] amen that you believe in what God has
[1:52:43] given you
[1:52:45] he's giving you a book full of promises
[1:52:47] you ought to believe in what God has
[1:52:49] given you you ought to depend on him and
[1:52:51] it ain't just depending on what a
[1:52:53] preacher says or his idea but God gave
[1:52:56] you this
[1:53:03] he says also spunk is something that'll
[1:53:06] stand up
[1:53:09] when they know what they're doing don't
[1:53:12] you like to see that he said that's the
[1:53:14] reason I like the Pentecostal Church
[1:53:15] don't care what the world says call them
[1:53:17] Holy Rollers do what do whatever you
[1:53:20] want to they'll stand up and shout just
[1:53:21] the same praise the Lord go on right on

[1:53:39] anyhow
[1:53:41] said but I watch this old Eagle as he
[1:53:44] moved around but you know after a little
[1:53:45] bit I happened to notice he wasn't
[1:53:47] watching me much he was getting tired of
[1:53:50] that squirrel that was cursing him
[1:53:51] saying chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:53:54] chatter he just looked over him after a
[1:53:56] while he got so annoyed at him he gave a
[1:53:59] big jump and he flapped Them Wings about
[1:54:01] twice and he was out of the Timber and
[1:54:04] out of sight
[1:54:06] Hallelujah I'm about tired of those Old
[1:54:09] Pine squirrels that says days of
[1:54:11] Miracles are path and there's no such a
[1:54:13] thing as a power of God in the church
[1:54:15] anymore there's no such a thing as an
[1:54:17] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost you chatter
[1:54:19] chatter chatter chatter just a little
[1:54:22] while this bride is going to jump off
[1:54:24] thank you

[1:54:52] he just kept going up and up and up and
[1:54:54] up and up there's nothing but a little
[1:54:57] spot
[1:54:59] I stood there with tears running down my
[1:55:01] cheeks
[1:55:02] I said oh God what a great place to be
[1:55:07] there you are in that eagle he made one
[1:55:10] jump because he trusted his wings
[1:55:13] he didn't flop from one meeting to
[1:55:15] another from one Church to another he
[1:55:17] just made one big flop and set his wings
[1:55:20] in the power of God
[1:55:24] amen come on Eagles you ain't got to
[1:55:26] flop around to each meeting
[1:55:29] you ought to be soaring into the meeting
[1:55:35] amen soaring into the things of God
[1:55:40] it's unlimited they want to say days of
[1:55:42] Miracles are passed no such thing as the
[1:55:44] Holy Ghost that's for another day pass
[1:55:45] oh just set your wings in the power of
[1:55:48] God let the Holy Ghost rise you above
[1:55:50] that nonsense and go on and on and on he
[1:55:53] could never even hear that chipmunk no
[1:55:55] more whatever you want to call him
[1:55:56] ground squirrel got tired of that
[1:55:58] chatter chatter he said oh if the church
[1:56:00] one of these days are going to get tired
[1:56:03] of all of that they'll know how to set
[1:56:05] their wings and they'll just take a walk
[1:56:07] with God and go home out of all of it
[1:56:11] Hallelujah he said days of Miracles was
[1:56:13] passed tell me when
[1:56:17] just come you come too late to tell us
[1:56:19] that days of Miracles has passed no such
[1:56:22] a thing as the Holy Ghost speaking in
[1:56:23] tongues is just make believe that's all
[1:56:25] they know about it
[1:56:29] but you just need to set your wings
[1:56:32] just set your wings move out of it
[1:56:38] but too many times we're pushing it all
[1:56:39] out to the Millennium somewhere all the
[1:56:42] blessings out there
[1:56:44] you know we'll have that complete body
[1:56:46] change and that real Divine we we need
[1:56:49] Divine Healing now

[1:56:58] [Applause]
[1:57:01] now is when we have it we won't be sons
[1:57:04] of God we are now sons of God it is our
[1:57:07] possession Satan don't like that but
[1:57:09] it's unlimited but as I said a French
[1:57:12] scientist 300 years ago scientifically
[1:57:14] proved in their modern theories he
[1:57:17] proved that a man would ever reach a
[1:57:19] speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation
[1:57:21] would take him off the Earth but science
[1:57:24] will never go back to that
[1:57:28] we're going beyond that
[1:57:33] he said science is eating off the tree
[1:57:35] of knowledge
[1:57:37] but it can only go so far
[1:57:40] he said when the tree of knowledge ends
[1:57:43] he said it's time to step onto the Tree
[1:57:45] of Life
[1:57:46] because the tree of life is unlimited it
[1:57:50] has untapped resources amen don't be
[1:57:52] scared to step out on the tree of life
[1:57:54] and take God in his word God will back
[1:57:58] up his word
[1:57:59] [Applause]
[1:58:04] you know I think about those those right
[1:58:06] those people that take off of those
[1:58:08] astronauts take off of those Rockets
[1:58:09] they're sitting on the very top of this
[1:58:11] thing
[1:58:12] and they're having confidence in
[1:58:15] something man-made
[1:58:17] that has blown up before has killed
[1:58:20] people before has just obliterated they
[1:58:23] can't even find them
[1:58:25] and they're sitting here they got
[1:58:27] confidence I'm going to leave this world
[1:58:29] and I'm going to another place
[1:58:31] and they're looking they're sitting on
[1:58:32] top of this thing filled with jet fuel
[1:58:35] certain kind of fuel rocket fuel and
[1:58:37] they're sitting there and you know what
[1:58:38] I I began to think about I doubt that up
[1:58:41] there on their monitors is Fox News and
[1:58:43] CNN and Facebook
[1:58:46] no they're not interested in none of
[1:58:48] that nonsense because they're leaving
[1:58:49] this place
[1:58:51] they're going to another place to
[1:58:53] another round to to the to the atmosph
[1:58:55] the atmosphere or another and so they're
[1:58:57] sitting there and they're sitting and
[1:58:59] they're looking up
[1:59:01] hey man you know just uh here a couple
[1:59:03] of years ago we had our first rocket
[1:59:04] take off again and during that time
[1:59:06] there was riots taking place and there
[1:59:08] was this going on and covet and not all
[1:59:10] this stuff was happening and I you know
[1:59:12] I have to believe that those men was
[1:59:14] looking there looking where they're
[1:59:15] going they wasn't looking over here in
[1:59:17] Minneapolis or looking at this over here
[1:59:19] looking at that over there or this
[1:59:21] church trouble over here or that over

[1:59:24] and I don't like the way he built this
[1:59:26] and I don't

[1:59:45] going to end up in a ditch if your eyes
[1:59:48] stay end up staring on the side of the
[1:59:50] road that's where you're going to go
[1:59:51] amen but our eyes need to be tuned not
[1:59:54] to what's around us but what where we're
[1:59:57] going
[1:59:59] hallelujah amen we're sitting on an
[2:00:01] unlimited resource that's going to
[2:00:04] change our mortal body
[2:00:09] take us from this atmosphere to another
[2:00:12] dimension
[2:00:18] and I'm going to tell you you're not
[2:00:20] going to go there in Ox cart

[2:00:27] ground and go to the moon or stars or
[2:00:28] anywhere
[2:00:29] five feet off the ground unless it fell
[2:00:31] off a cliff
[2:00:37] you need a rocket
[2:00:39] so God brought it and he set it up
[2:00:44] and he put unlimited power in there

[2:01:16] is asking where the miracle is
[2:01:20] amen the miraculous is happening all
[2:01:23] around us
[2:01:24] he said so why don't you get in and go

[2:02:06] call on your brother call on your sister
[2:02:10] but he said I'm not meaning that you're
[2:02:11] not in a sense but I want you to get
[2:02:15] into the blessing
[2:02:17] Hallelujah
[2:02:23] he says wouldn't that Pentecostal Church
[2:02:26] as soon as it was born or any other
[2:02:28] church when it's born in the kingdom of
[2:02:30] God it becomes Sons and Daughters of God
[2:02:32] but we stop at that
[2:02:34] he said when the Pentecostal Church
[2:02:36] received the gift of speaking in tongues
[2:02:38] and interpretation they stopped at that
[2:02:40] that's no place to stop that's a place
[2:02:43] to begin
[2:02:45] well we've got untapped resources
[2:02:48] everywhere
[2:02:49] all things are possible to them that
[2:02:52] believe every promise in the Bible
[2:02:54] belongs to us
[2:02:58] so the trouble of is you can tell uh
[2:03:00] that you know our fellow citizens on the
[2:03:02] kingdom of God the Methodist Baptist
[2:03:03] different ones you can tell them about
[2:03:05] Divine Healing the power of God and
[2:03:07] they'll refer back to what they did what
[2:03:09] happened in Moody what'd he say about it
[2:03:11] what somebody else said about it looking
[2:03:13] back he said we could say the
[2:03:14] Pentecostal brother well if we'd go back
[2:03:16] and Yonder when our forefathers got it
[2:03:18] 50 years ago don't ever Look Backwards
[2:03:20] look forward keep looking forward signs
[2:03:24] don't do that science keeps going to
[2:03:26] find god well before the preacher does
[2:03:28] if you don't watch it in his researches
[2:03:30] he says science some 300 years ago would
[2:03:33] say that a man would move so fast he
[2:03:35] would leave the Earth but he could think
[2:03:36] modern science would listen to that
[2:03:37] again he's going 2 000 miles an hour and
[2:03:40] he's not even stopping at that he's
[2:03:42] going on and on that's science
[2:03:46] science is going on and on and on but
[2:03:49] they are going to come to an end
[2:03:52] they are limited in what they can do
[2:03:54] they have built themselves in such a
[2:03:56] place that we have nuclear power now
[2:03:58] that's going to burn this whole earth
[2:04:00] and it's going to burn everybody that's
[2:04:02] here and be consumed with unquenchable
[2:04:04] fire by the power of science
[2:04:08] of course we know the fire of God is
[2:04:10] going to come as well and cleanse the
[2:04:12] whole earth and all that but nuclear
[2:04:13] power is going to be released upon this
[2:04:15] Earth amen they have gone amen because
[2:04:18] you know one day they was fighting and
[2:04:20] it was pew
[2:04:22] and that was the biggest thing they had
[2:04:23] and then they got this boom or they had
[2:04:26] this
[2:04:27] and they got this and then next thing
[2:04:29] you know
[2:04:33] World War one they realized the power of
[2:04:36] the plane
[2:04:37] and what they do in these little
[2:04:38] biplanes they would get one guy in the
[2:04:40] seat with a bomb and they would fly over
[2:04:42] and he would just try to look down
[2:04:45] [Music]
[2:04:51] but that wasn't where it was had
[2:04:53] continued and it continued to progress
[2:04:55] until World War II that could sit in a
[2:04:58] machine and they could look and they
[2:04:59] could push a button and and get it
[2:05:01] pretty precise at least in the general
[2:05:03] area
[2:05:04] and then we saw in Desert Storm one of
[2:05:07] the first public uh public Wars that
[2:05:09] would take place and it was all over the
[2:05:10] news how they could drop a laser-guided
[2:05:13] missile down a tube
[2:05:15] a chimney in the house and
[2:05:19] over there one of those men that was
[2:05:21] fighting some of our men said you know
[2:05:23] he said I realize we is in trouble when
[2:05:25] a missile came down my street and took a
[2:05:27] left turn
[2:05:33] it had progressed it had moved forward
[2:05:37] and it's going to nuclear power to where
[2:05:40] it's going to burn the whole Earth
[2:05:42] well if science is progressing how much
[2:05:45] more should we be moving forward
[2:05:49] listen we shouldn't be dropping it no we
[2:05:53] have the long tap resources the power
[2:05:56] the move of the Holy Ghost amen that's
[2:05:59] greater than any nuclear power it could
[2:06:01] ever be released upon this earth oh I
[2:06:04] know about the power of God it'll fall
[2:06:06] in your life and it'll burn out sin
[2:06:08] it'll burn out unbelief it'll turn every
[2:06:10] devil away from you
[2:06:12] and it'll give you a power to rise above
[2:06:15] it
[2:06:17] Amen to live above it
[2:06:23] it's Unlimited
[2:06:25] to where Jesus way and say if you say to
[2:06:28] this mountain and be moved and don't
[2:06:30] down your heart but believe what you
[2:06:32] said it shall
[2:06:34] it shall it shall come to pass
[2:06:44] today we think of going to church
[2:06:46] shaking hands with the preacher putting
[2:06:48] their name on the book being immersed
[2:06:52] we got it made
[2:06:55] go to so-and-so's church we got it
[2:06:58] we receive the Holy Ghost fell on us we
[2:07:01] began to begin shouting praising God and
[2:07:03] the power of God came down spoke in
[2:07:05] tongues heard them interpreted great
[2:07:07] quotations so forth prophecies that's
[2:07:09] fine he said well we just stop that's
[2:07:12] just the beginning
[2:07:20] he said well brother Timothy would uh
[2:07:22] what
[2:07:23] what I get confused with searching and
[2:07:25] stability and what
[2:07:28] what I do
[2:07:30] brother Aaron put it like this I thought
[2:07:32] it was really good
[2:07:34] he said you need to be stable
[2:07:36] but yet still desperate
[2:07:40] don't ever be satisfied where you're at
[2:07:47] I want more
[2:08:01] a drunk don't become a drunk just taking
[2:08:03] a sip every now and then
[2:08:05] no he wants the whole bottle and the
[2:08:07] bottle ain't enough he wants more
[2:08:09] and he wants more until his whole body
[2:08:11] becomes Intoxicated by that liquor as it
[2:08:14] goes down and takes over his bed and I
[2:08:16] thought my if a drunk wants that and he
[2:08:19] wants that in his self and he wants that
[2:08:21] in his life and that's his desire he'll
[2:08:23] sell out anything to get it he'll give
[2:08:25] up his wife he'll give up his home he'll
[2:08:27] give up his job whatever it is to get
[2:08:29] under that drink one more time or or
[2:08:31] that that influence of a drug one more
[2:08:33] time and I thought my he comes he'll get
[2:08:35] under it and come out of it he'll get
[2:08:37] under and come out of it and he'll have
[2:08:38] a hangover and have a headache and cause
[2:08:40] all kind of side effects but I thought
[2:08:42] ma if a drunk wants that and then a drug
[2:08:45] addict won't say how much more to the
[2:08:47] children of God want more of God
[2:08:50] it ain't a hangover you got to deal with
[2:08:53] it's God moving you to higher Heights
[2:08:56] and deeper depths and more of God more

[2:09:28] me they ain't gonna be a bottle left

[2:09:42] day of your life say I want more

[2:11:02] we kind of
[2:11:04] I don't even know where we're at in time
[2:11:05] but anyway
[2:11:13] it says one of the wives of the man of
[2:11:15] the sons of the prophets
[2:11:17] cried out to Elisha for help
[2:11:19] saying your servant my husband is dead
[2:11:22] and you know that your servant
[2:11:24] reverently feared the Lord
[2:11:27] but the Creditor is coming
[2:11:29] to take my two sons
[2:11:31] to be his slaves
[2:11:33] in pavement for a loan
[2:11:35] Elisha said what shall I do for you tell
[2:11:38] me what do you have of value in your
[2:11:42] house
[2:11:44] [Music]
[2:11:46] what do you have of value in your house
[2:11:51] this time we do we take a checkup I know
[2:11:54] this is
[2:11:57] what do you have a value in your house
[2:12:00] she said your maidservant has nothing in
[2:12:03] the house except a small jar of olive
[2:12:06] oil
[2:12:09] a small jar of olive oil then he said go
[2:12:13] borrow containers from all your
[2:12:16] neighbors
[2:12:17] empty containers and not just a few
[2:12:24] go get all that you can gather
[2:12:27] get them all into your house you're
[2:12:29] going to see the glory of the Lord
[2:12:32] don't just get a couple don't just have
[2:12:34] just a few moments don't just have a few
[2:12:36] times go get all you can get
[2:12:41] Hallelujah and then you shall go in and
[2:12:44] shut the door behind you and your sons
[2:12:46] and pour out the oil you have into all
[2:12:50] these containers and you shall set aside
[2:12:53] each one when it's full so she left him
[2:12:55] and shut the door behind her in the Sun
[2:12:57] and they were bringing her the
[2:12:58] containers as she poured the alt now she
[2:13:01] said she had just a small jar
[2:13:05] foreign
[2:13:09] I know what that feels like
[2:13:13] really Donnie on a Wednesday sometimes
[2:13:14] you don't feel like you got much
[2:13:17] I don't feel like I got much but all of
[2:13:19] a sudden Lord is just take it and pour
[2:13:21] it out
[2:13:23] and somehow it just keeps coming out
[2:13:26] and it just keeps coming out and it just
[2:13:28] keeps coming out and it just don't seem
[2:13:30] like much I feel like man I don't have
[2:13:33] much tonight I don't know and it just
[2:13:34] keeps
[2:13:35] coming out
[2:13:38] Hallelujah and they were beginning they
[2:13:41] would be bringing the containers she
[2:13:43] poured the hole in the containers were
[2:13:45] all listen all full
[2:13:48] she said to her son bring me another
[2:13:50] container and he said to her there is
[2:13:54] not one left
[2:13:55] then the all stopped multiplying then
[2:13:59] she came and told the man of God and he
[2:14:01] said go sell the oil and pay your debt
[2:14:04] and yours you and your sons can now live
[2:14:06] on the rest
[2:14:10] so it's not just enough it was more than
[2:14:13] enough

[2:14:50] now she had just a little she'd been to
[2:14:52] a meeting

[2:14:56] but she didn't recognize the power that
[2:14:59] was in that hole the the purchasing
[2:15:01] price of that oil
[2:15:03] a lot like the church they don't
[2:15:05] recognize the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:06] and the Liberty that is brought but
[2:15:09] don't ever limit God to Just a Touch

[2:23:37] here just this past weekend at a youth
[2:23:39] camp she came up into a line she said
[2:23:41] you know why I'm here I want more
[2:23:45] he says I want more of God I got to have
[2:23:48] more than I had and they laid hands on
[2:23:50] her began to pray for her and her voice
[2:23:52] began to come out of her she began to
[2:23:55] praise God for all he's done praising
[2:23:57] for his wonderful words praise him for
[2:23:59] all the things and she said she felt
[2:24:01] herself being pulled back from her body
[2:24:05] and she said she was moved over to an
[2:24:07] altar and she began to look and she saw
[2:24:10] right now I'm Not Jesus and those ropes
[2:24:12] he didn't see his face but just from
[2:24:13] down upon the throne and she began to
[2:24:16] hear the crowd of people singing sound
[2:24:18] like a Heavenly Host singing since you
[2:24:21] heard her little sister back down out
[2:24:23] all those voices singing to the top of
[2:24:25] her room she said I realize not only is
[2:24:27] she going to defeat Satan here she's
[2:24:29] going to sing the Praises of God over
[2:24:30] there
[2:24:33] what happened it was a vessel that
[2:24:36] opened up and said God pour it out on me
[2:24:42] God wants you to tow to higher Heights
[2:24:44] than you ever been
[2:24:46] it's time you rise above that depression
[2:24:49] it's time you rise and you go into the
[2:24:52] glories of God
[2:24:56] so how do you do that you start praising
[2:24:59] God instead of your problems you start
[2:25:01] praising God instead of your sickness
[2:25:03] you start praising God that he's the
[2:25:06] same yesterday today and forever you
[2:25:08] start praising him that he still heals
[2:25:10] the sin he still raises a dare he still
[2:25:13] moves and does some miraculous that's
