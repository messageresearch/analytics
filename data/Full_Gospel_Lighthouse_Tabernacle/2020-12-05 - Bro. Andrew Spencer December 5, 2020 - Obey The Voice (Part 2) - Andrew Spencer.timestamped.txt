[25:40] god bless you i'm glad to be back
[25:45] amen thank the lord for your prayers and
[25:47] i certainly appreciate your prayers of
[25:50] with us as we went through a couple of
[25:53] bumps in the road over the last couple
[25:55] of weeks
[25:56] and and we thank the lord for his mercy
[25:59] and his kindness to us and uh
[26:03] those things just happen and
[26:07] i i just want to share a couple things
[26:08] with you maybe you have or have not
[26:10] heard
[26:11] a week before last we went to a four
[26:14] hour
[26:15] eye doctor appointment to which that
[26:17] they ran all kinds of tests on my eyes
[26:20] every
[26:21] i i just you just can't believe they can
[26:24] do those things to your eyes but they do
[26:26] it
[26:26] two months ago i had had that same thing
[26:29] done
[26:30] and it was at a different clinic with
[26:32] the different doctors of uva
[26:35] and and they found cancer in my left eye
[26:38] and it was two distinct things that was
[26:41] there
[26:42] and they found two two globs they wasn't
[26:45] seeming to be growing
[26:47] but it may have been the place to where
[26:49] that it initially started
[26:51] and so they were they were concerned
[26:54] maybe we didn't share that with you but
[26:56] it was there in my left eye and so they
[26:58] sent me to another
[26:59] eye clinic which was a another level
[27:03] to kind of look at it and they went
[27:05] through the same four hours of tests and
[27:08] sister connie's just just real patient
[27:11] with
[27:11] with me doing those things and so she
[27:13] was there for a lot of it
[27:16] and some of maybe you've went to
[27:17] different eye clinics but
[27:19] yeah when it comes to cancer they go
[27:22] through a lot of different kinds of
[27:23] tests
[27:24] well they went through an extensive
[27:26] amount of tests and they took more
[27:27] pictures than i never thought they would
[27:29] ever take
[27:30] when we got done the doctor looked at me
[27:32] and he was kind of had a
[27:34] british accent and he said well that
[27:37] cancer that was in that screen
[27:39] is not in this screen
[27:52] that's
[27:55] hallelujah
[28:00] and god does everything really nice i
[28:03] had two cataracts that were developing
[28:05] and they said in the next couple of
[28:06] years that those would have to come off
[28:09] well they're gone from one screen to
[28:11] another screen
[28:12] so not only did he take care of cancer
[28:15] he took your cataracts
[28:21] hallelujah so we were really thrilled to
[28:24] get that news
[28:26] and and so we were thankful for that and
[28:30] then on that coming saturday
[28:32] i went hunting in the morning with the
[28:34] boys and it they had
[28:36] these guys have been taking really good
[28:37] care of me driving me to my stand
[28:39] helping me get into the
[28:41] to the blind or whatever i'm doing and
[28:44] these these guys have been just really
[28:46] good to me
[28:48] and uh if i need to need to get up a
[28:50] hill they'll help me get up a hill or
[28:52] whatever needs to be done
[28:53] and so we came home and we had lunch and
[28:56] and when i woke up i knew
[28:58] i knew i was in trouble and so i
[29:01] i the medicine that i take i take about
[29:04] 20 pills a day
[29:05] i take eight cancer pills a day
[29:09] and that's my treatments and so they're
[29:11] they're sometimes pretty vicious
[29:13] brother andy you kind of know some of
[29:14] these treatments that
[29:16] one day they'll treat you good one day
[29:17] they'll treat you really bad
[29:20] and so and so anyway anyway i
[29:23] i i it's hard on it's hard on all your
[29:26] organs and so
[29:28] they told me at some point that there
[29:30] might be a hard issue
[29:32] and so i woke up from my my nap
[29:35] and i i like it that they instruct me to
[29:38] take a nap brother vernon
[29:40] every evening because they say it's
[29:42] healing so i like to have some healing
[29:45] and so i don't i didn't i never didn't
[29:47] need a prescription before but i really
[29:49] enjoy the
[29:50] the prescription and so i
[29:54] sometimes it's a 10-minute nap sometimes
[29:56] it's a two-hour nap and so
[29:58] after i preach on sunday morning it's a
[30:00] three-hour nap so
[30:03] so anyway i woke up and my chest felt
[30:07] like like everybody says it's an
[30:09] elephant on your chest
[30:10] and i i went in and took my blood
[30:12] pressure and it was 235 over 117
[30:16] and so sister connie contacted brother
[30:18] nathaniel and sister sue
[30:20] and they said get a nitroglycerin peel
[30:23] in see if it will go down and so it
[30:26] we actually took four nitroglycerin
[30:28] peels as the evening would progress
[30:31] we went brother nathaniel rode with me
[30:33] in in the truck
[30:35] sister connie from nascar drove me to
[30:38] uva
[30:41] and so anyway we i didn't want to go to
[30:44] the local hospitals and
[30:45] i know i'm on live okay but my dog get
[30:49] sick i'll
[30:50] send them there but but
[30:53] i i don't go to there so and so anyway i
[30:57] i i went to uva and so
[31:00] my blood pressure was when i was
[31:02] arriving at uva was
[31:04] 178 over 138
[31:07] and so and so they begin to work on me
[31:09] there
[31:10] they were thinking just like brother
[31:12] nathaniel was thinking that i'd had a
[31:13] heart attack
[31:14] i was showing every symptom of a heart
[31:16] attack
[31:18] and people begin to pray you begin to
[31:21] pray
[31:22] others begin to pray and literally
[31:26] every every bit of those
[31:30] things that was happening to me went
[31:32] away
[31:35] they just went away and
[31:38] the doctor i went back to the cancer
[31:41] doctor
[31:42] on on wednesday and she just looked at
[31:45] me
[31:46] and she said you had a
[31:49] supernatural intervention
[31:53] and it was such an intervention until
[31:55] there was no
[31:57] no problems within the heart and no no
[32:00] molecules even on wednesday brother
[32:02] nathanael
[32:03] there was still no lab things that
[32:05] showed that we had a heart episode
[32:07] it was as though it never happened
[32:10] that's kind of like the blood of jesus
[32:12] christ
[32:16] it was as though it never happened in
[32:18] the first place
[32:22] amen and so i i felt a little bit rough
[32:26] on sunday so that's why you didn't see
[32:28] me last weekend and then on monday i was
[32:30] weak and then
[32:32] tuesday i felt back to myself and so
[32:34] here we are tonight and so i'm really
[32:36] just thrilled to see you
[32:38] amen isn't god good amen i'll be glad
[32:42] and all this coveted business is over
[32:44] with
[32:46] i have an announcement for you tonight
[32:47] and i just
[32:49] and i'll share with you a scripture
[32:51] first if i can't
[32:53] i didn't i didn't ask for a limit of
[32:55] time but andrew's going to speak for you
[32:57] in a little bit
[32:58] and you know a southern people we can't
[33:00] say hello without
[33:02] taking five minutes to do it
[33:05] jesus is speaking in the scriptures
[33:08] and he said he said there was a king
[33:13] the kingdom of heaven is like a certain
[33:15] king that made a marriage for his son
[33:18] and he sent forth his servants to call
[33:20] them that were bidden to the wedding
[33:23] that they would not come and again he
[33:26] sent forth servants and said tell them
[33:28] which are bidden behold i have prepared
[33:30] a dinner
[33:32] my oxen and my fatlings are killed and
[33:34] they're ready
[33:35] and come into the marriage but they made
[33:38] light of it and went their ways and one
[33:40] went to his farm another to his
[33:41] merchandise and
[33:43] the remnant took his servants and and
[33:46] treated them spitefully and slew them
[33:48] when the king heard this heard thereof
[33:51] he was wroth and he sent forth his
[33:53] armies and destroyed them and
[33:55] destroyed those murderers and burned up
[33:57] their their city
[33:59] then said he to the servants the wedding
[34:01] is ready but they
[34:03] which are bidden are not worthy go you
[34:05] into the highways
[34:07] and as many as you find bid to the
[34:09] marriage so
[34:10] so those servants went out into the
[34:12] highways and gathered together
[34:14] all as many as they found both bad and
[34:17] good
[34:18] and the wedding was furnished with
[34:21] guests
[34:22] and when the king came in to see the
[34:24] guest he saw a man
[34:26] which had not owned the wedding garment
[34:30] and he said unto him friend how camest
[34:33] thou
[34:35] into hither having not a wedding garment
[34:39] and he was speechless and the king
[34:44] said to the servants bind him hand and
[34:47] foot and take him away and cast him into
[34:49] the outer darkness
[34:51] and there shall be weeping and gnashing
[34:53] of teeth
[34:55] for many are called and few are chosen
[35:03] i read that scripture with with this in
[35:05] mind
[35:07] generally every year we have a a
[35:09] christmas dinner
[35:11] and we enjoy we enjoy being able to be
[35:14] together
[35:14] in our christmas dinner and we generally
[35:17] have it in the fellowship hall but we're
[35:19] renovating that right now and
[35:21] and we don't have the room to
[35:23] accommodate everybody there
[35:25] because we have social distancing that
[35:27] we have to take care of
[35:30] i continue to have a burden on my heart
[35:32] that i'd like to have us all together
[35:34] to have a meal and so it just kept
[35:38] it kept being a burden on my heart and
[35:40] so
[35:42] so we were at traditions the other day
[35:45] been a few weeks ago and we spoke to
[35:48] kayla which is the owner of that place
[35:50] and
[35:51] and she actually went to school with
[35:53] brother matthew she's a very nice
[35:54] individual and
[35:56] and so we just we just shared what was
[35:59] on our heart that we'd like to do for
[36:01] our audience
[36:02] and they have two two rooms there most
[36:05] of you've been there
[36:06] they have two rooms there and and um
[36:10] she said well you know we shut down on
[36:13] sunday afternoon and
[36:15] and if you would like to do that we
[36:17] would open back up for you as your
[36:19] church
[36:21] alone and it wouldn't be no guess from
[36:23] outside it would be just
[36:25] you people and we will
[36:28] we will do social distancing there
[36:31] gloves for you to be able to
[36:33] use for getting the food and everybody
[36:36] must wear a mask when they're
[36:38] up and so you know we told them we would
[36:41] abide by the rules
[36:43] and we we we want to do that as a group
[36:46] of people
[36:47] and so you know we didn't have a lot of
[36:50] choices on dates we could only take one
[36:52] date and that was the date that she
[36:55] would uh
[36:55] could accommodate us because other
[36:58] churches are wanting to do the same
[37:00] thing and
[37:00] and i can appreciate that and so we have
[37:04] we have got that for the 20th
[37:08] 20th on sunday and it will be at 2 30
[37:12] uh a 3 30 in the afternoon so we'll have
[37:16] time for
[37:16] for church that morning and then we will
[37:19] we will go maybe i'll preach like
[37:21] brother tim pruitt
[37:22] that sunday morning and
[37:26] and and just deliver deliver my whole
[37:29] heart and then we just drive right
[37:30] straight there
[37:32] but we would like to have both groups to
[37:33] come
[37:35] and uh and we'll have maybe we'll have a
[37:37] deacon or two at the door just to make
[37:39] sure that
[37:40] that it's just our people and i and i'm
[37:42] gonna just say this to you
[37:44] those that's been gone for months and
[37:46] hasn't showed up for covet related
[37:49] scared to come and worship with us
[37:51] you're not invited
[37:57] don't bring your cousins sisters mothers
[37:59] sisters
[38:00] joins whatever and you say well brother
[38:02] ron that didn't
[38:03] that offends me can't come to church
[38:18] [Music]
[38:23] now i understand people being scared
[38:24] about not coming not
[38:26] not wanting to carry it back to their 90
[38:29] year old parents and
[38:30] i understand people that want to stay
[38:32] away but the rule that you applied to
[38:35] yourself about not coming to church
[38:38] applies to you about
[38:41] not coming to the dinner
[38:46] that offends me that's the reason i read
[38:48] the scripture
[38:53] because jesus is preparing a denim
[38:59] and it's more important than traditions
[39:05] i'm paying for your dinner here you
[39:08] don't have to do anything you can lay a
[39:09] tip on the table to help the ladies if
[39:11] you want to
[39:13] but let me just say this to you the
[39:16] dinner that we preach here
[39:18] every saturday and sunday night
[39:21] is more important than traditions
[39:37] and and let me just say this to you
[39:39] these are things that you
[39:40] want to hear and some of you don't want
[39:41] to hear but i'm going to say it anyway
[39:46] understand that you do it at your home
[39:51] you have a family dinner your neighbors
[39:54] don't come
[39:58] are you with me and you you know it
[40:02] don't matter if it's at the fellowship
[40:03] hall or if it don't matter if it's at a
[40:05] picnic
[40:07] if you if you bring 10 people and they
[40:10] never come to church and never
[40:11] are interested in church and they show
[40:13] up and eat the chicken and
[40:15] they kind of look at the pasture
[40:16] cockeyed
[40:18] and you think where in the world did
[40:19] these people come from
[40:28] hallelujah i'm giving this same speech
[40:31] tomorrow morning
[40:36] and you say well brother ron that
[40:37] offends me let me just say
[40:39] this is traditions is really not that
[40:42] important but the marriage supper of the
[40:45] lamb
[40:46] is going to be important
[40:53] it's going to be important
[40:59] it's going to be important and let me
[41:01] just say
[41:02] here's where you get the wedding garment
[41:05] and it's the holy ghost it's the message
[41:08] of the
[41:09] hour
[41:12] and if you don't have the message of the
[41:14] hour
[41:15] dress around you and the holy ghost
[41:18] inside of your life
[41:19] you don't get a place at the table
[41:27] brother ron that offends me good
[41:31] because i want you to be offended
[41:34] if the word comes by you and it offends
[41:36] you

[41:41] will offend you
[41:43] but i want this to be a joyous time for

[1:00:06] amen amen if you have your bibles this
[1:00:08] evening i'd like to turn over
[1:00:10] the first samuel chapter 3.
[1:00:15] verse 1.
[1:00:22] first samuel chapter 3 in verse 1.
[1:00:26] amen
[1:00:40] say a man when you have it this evening
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:44] and the child samuel ministered unto the
[1:00:47] lord before eli
[1:00:48] and the word of the lord was precious in
[1:00:50] those days
[1:00:52] there was no open vision and it came to
[1:00:54] pass at that time that when eli was laid
[1:00:57] down in his place and his eyes
[1:00:59] began to wax dim that he could not see
[1:01:02] and here the lamp of god went out into
[1:01:04] the temple
[1:01:05] of the lord where the ark of god was and
[1:01:07] samuel
[1:01:09] was laid down to sleep that the lord
[1:01:12] called samuel and he answered
[1:01:14] here am i and he ran unto eli and he
[1:01:17] said
[1:01:17] here am i for thou callest me and he
[1:01:20] said i called not
[1:01:21] lie down again and he went and laid down
[1:01:24] and the lord called yet again
[1:01:26] samuel and samuel rose and went to eli
[1:01:29] and said here am i for thou didst call
[1:01:31] me
[1:01:31] and he answered i called not my son
[1:01:35] lie down again now samuel did not yet
[1:01:38] know the lord neither was the word of
[1:01:40] the lord yet revealed unto him
[1:01:43] and the lord called samuel again the
[1:01:45] third time
[1:01:46] and he arose and went to eli and said
[1:01:49] here am i
[1:01:50] for thou didst call me and eli perceived
[1:01:54] that the lord had called the child
[1:01:56] therefore eli said unto samuel go
[1:01:59] and lie down and it shall be if he
[1:02:01] called thee
[1:02:02] thou shall say speak speak lord
[1:02:05] for thy servant heareth so samuel went
[1:02:08] and laid down in his place and the lord
[1:02:11] came
[1:02:11] and stood and called as at other times
[1:02:15] samuel samuel then samuel answered
[1:02:19] speak for thy servant heareth also verse
[1:02:22] 19
[1:02:24] and samuel grew and the lord was with
[1:02:26] him
[1:02:27] and to let none of his words fall to the
[1:02:30] ground may god bless his word he may be
[1:02:32] seated this evening
[1:02:34] i'd like to continue looking at this
[1:02:36] thought on obeying the voice of the lord
[1:02:39] and
[1:02:40] it's some very powerful things when you
[1:02:42] go to studying out the
[1:02:43] the voice of the lord and and there's
[1:02:46] definitely more things that we could
[1:02:47] dive into
[1:02:48] in a few weekends on the voice of the
[1:02:50] lord but when you go to studying out on
[1:02:52] on obeying the voice of god and you go
[1:02:54] to looking at men of god and you begin
[1:02:56] to look at the women of god and you
[1:02:58] begin to look at
[1:02:59] throughout throughout the old testament
[1:03:01] and you begin to look at the
[1:03:04] people of god and and it's not just
[1:03:06] necessarily
[1:03:07] the men that we point to but it's also
[1:03:09] women that we see in the bible and
[1:03:11] and we see that we see ladies of truth
[1:03:14] and ladies of grace and ladies that made
[1:03:16] it into the lineage of jesus
[1:03:18] and you see ladies that would stand out
[1:03:20] like sarah and
[1:03:21] and rebecca and even rachel and even
[1:03:24] hannah and esther and ruth that would
[1:03:26] that would come out and men like abraham
[1:03:29] and isaac and jacob that would
[1:03:30] that would come out and only the reason
[1:03:32] that you and i even know about abraham
[1:03:35] and sarah or
[1:03:36] or isaac and rebecca or esther and ruth
[1:03:39] is because they were a type of people
[1:03:41] that were willing to stand out from the
[1:03:43] crowd and
[1:03:44] was willing to step out and take god at
[1:03:46] his word
[1:03:47] and i believe that even today that god
[1:03:49] is looking for somebody that's willing
[1:03:51] to stand out from the crowd not
[1:03:53] necessarily to be different
[1:03:54] but to take him at his word because i
[1:03:57] believe that truly that is what god
[1:03:59] wants every one of us to do is simply
[1:04:01] take him at his word and i don't think
[1:04:03] it gets too high above that or
[1:04:04] necessarily too low below that
[1:04:06] but god just simply wants you to take
[1:04:09] him at his word
[1:04:10] and even the prophet would say that the
[1:04:12] angel of the lord
[1:04:14] he loved that song he always come near
[1:04:17] to
[1:04:17] to only believe because that's all it
[1:04:20] takes is
[1:04:20] and if you if you don't believe one
[1:04:22] thing that i say tonight i won't be able
[1:04:24] to help you
[1:04:25] but if you believe the things that i
[1:04:27] speak this evening they'll be a help to
[1:04:29] you and
[1:04:30] you begin to look and you see men of god
[1:04:32] and women of god that would stand there
[1:04:35] and you can see how they stood there in
[1:04:37] the face of criticism and
[1:04:39] in the face of the trials of life
[1:04:41] against circumstances of life
[1:04:43] and then it even translate over in the
[1:04:45] new testament
[1:04:46] when when you'd see men of faith and
[1:04:48] you'd see women of faith of priscilla
[1:04:50] and aquila and
[1:04:51] you begin to see you begin to see james
[1:04:53] and john
[1:04:54] and and peter and paul and you'd see
[1:04:56] those men of faith that would stand out
[1:04:58] there and
[1:04:59] they would take god at his word and our
[1:05:01] minds are reminded about when jesus was
[1:05:04] standing there and he was
[1:05:05] standing on the shore and and peter and
[1:05:08] the
[1:05:08] and his brothers had been out fishing
[1:05:10] all night and they caught nothing all
[1:05:12] night and
[1:05:13] and there was a man that they they
[1:05:15] hadn't necessarily come in custom to
[1:05:17] with yet
[1:05:18] but they were getting ready to become
[1:05:19] accustomed to him because of things that
[1:05:21] he was going to speak to them
[1:05:23] they would be spirit and they would be
[1:05:25] truth and they'd be
[1:05:26] life and they would see the
[1:05:27] manifestation of his voice as it came
[1:05:30] into existence
[1:05:32] that he was a manifest he was
[1:05:34] manifesting
[1:05:35] the things that he spoke but when he's
[1:05:37] standing there on that shore
[1:05:39] and he says he says castroned on the
[1:05:42] other side
[1:05:43] now here's men that they were as soon as
[1:05:45] they were able to stand up they were in
[1:05:47] a boat they knew how to fish
[1:05:49] and they were there they'd fist all
[1:05:50] night they toured all night
[1:05:52] and jesus is standing there and he says
[1:05:55] throw your net on the other side now any
[1:05:57] man knows it's done any fishing in life
[1:05:59] that when you bring your boat up on the
[1:06:01] bank of the
[1:06:02] bank of the shore there that fish if
[1:06:04] they're anywhere close to the shore
[1:06:06] that they'll begin to scatter when the
[1:06:08] water gets trouble but
[1:06:10] here these men that had been fishing all
[1:06:12] night they come to the shore
[1:06:14] they've got their boat against the shore
[1:06:16] and they're almost on land
[1:06:18] but jesus says cast your net on the
[1:06:20] other side
[1:06:22] and as soon as as soon as peter said
[1:06:25] nevertheless lord hath thy word i let
[1:06:28] down my net
[1:06:29] and they enclosed a multitude of fishes
[1:06:32] even till their necks begin to break
[1:06:34] you see simply these things came into
[1:06:37] existence
[1:06:38] supernatural things were only coming
[1:06:40] into existence
[1:06:41] because they simply took god at his word
[1:06:45] i wonder what would come into your net
[1:06:47] tonight
[1:06:48] that though there might be a troubling
[1:06:50] of watering and though there might you
[1:06:52] may have done this
[1:06:53] time and time again you come to service
[1:06:55] and you didn't see
[1:06:56] necessarily get anything in your net
[1:07:00] but there's a man that would say just
[1:07:02] catch janet on the other side
[1:07:04] and you bring in a catch of a lifetime
[1:07:07] so we can look back and we can see when
[1:07:10] when men of god when god would tell
[1:07:12] somebody or we would when god would do
[1:07:14] something for somebody
[1:07:16] we can look back in history and we can
[1:07:18] see what god told them to do
[1:07:21] and we can watch how that they obeyed
[1:07:23] what god said
[1:07:24] and how that those there were those that
[1:07:26] disobeyed what god
[1:07:28] said and we can see what god did to them
[1:07:31] and we can learn what you and i can do
[1:07:34] what we must do in life in obeying his
[1:07:36] word
[1:07:37] and then studying out the message and
[1:07:39] studying out scriptures
[1:07:41] that one of the most profound statements
[1:07:43] that there is to me throughout the whole
[1:07:45] message
[1:07:46] is that now full obedience to the whole
[1:07:49] word of god
[1:07:50] entitles us to the token that when we
[1:07:53] pray we must have that token
[1:07:55] to present with our prayer you see now
[1:07:58] what does he do then when you have when
[1:08:01] you can have and present that token with
[1:08:03] your prayer
[1:08:04] it shows that you have fully come to
[1:08:07] obedience to the whole word of god
[1:08:11] and when you've got that token it shows
[1:08:13] that you have obeyed every word
[1:08:16] then you and the word are one
[1:08:19] and you're only asking for the thing
[1:08:21] that you are
[1:08:24] oh hallelujah that when you and the word
[1:08:27] become one
[1:08:28] you're only asking for the thing that
[1:08:31] you are
[1:08:32] you're no longer separated from the
[1:08:34] things of truth but you
[1:08:36] and the word have become one
[1:08:40] he said now if i say to this hand hand
[1:08:42] you obey me
[1:08:43] and reach out for their handkerchief it
[1:08:46] doesn't
[1:08:46] the hand obeyed me why it's a part of me
[1:08:50] then when you and the word becomes one
[1:08:53] every promise glory to god
[1:08:55] every promise is yours and it obeys you
[1:08:59] now i know that this is sometimes it's
[1:09:01] extreme things for people
[1:09:03] for them to understand that when you as
[1:09:06] a
[1:09:06] son and daughter of god when you take
[1:09:08] god at his word
[1:09:10] and you see what to the world would say
[1:09:12] is an extreme thing
[1:09:14] it's just a part of you
[1:09:17] for you to come and do to worship him in
[1:09:20] spirit and in truth
[1:09:22] it's just a part of you for you to lay a
[1:09:24] hold
[1:09:25] on eternal life for you to grab a hold
[1:09:27] of healing for you to grab ahold
[1:09:29] of the promises of god
[1:09:32] it's not extreme for you it's a part of
[1:09:36] who you
[1:09:36] are and when you become a part of the
[1:09:39] word
[1:09:40] you will see bible days and bible
[1:09:43] promises
[1:09:44] and bible signs and bible wonders come
[1:09:47] into existence
[1:09:48] when you start taking god at his word
[1:09:53] you can have your circumstances a mile
[1:09:56] long
[1:09:56] i've got fear you're either going to be
[1:09:59] led by fear controlled by fear
[1:10:01] or you're going to be either led by love
[1:10:05] you can have your circumstances a mile
[1:10:07] and a half long
[1:10:08] but brother branham would preach a
[1:10:09] sermon called perfect faith and he would
[1:10:12] tell us that perfect faith
[1:10:13] is the master of all circumstances
[1:10:17] anybody got any circumstances in life
[1:10:22] well praise the god we've got angels
[1:10:24] sitting here amongst us this evening
[1:10:27] now you just forgive us humans we go
[1:10:29] through life you angels you may not
[1:10:31] understand everything that we go through
[1:10:33] but we have circumstances
[1:10:35] and the prophet would tell us that
[1:10:37] perfect faith
[1:10:38] is the master of all circumstances
[1:10:42] and that when you take him at his word
[1:10:44] no matter what it is
[1:10:45] it masters it and he said you just watch
[1:10:48] and when you believe anything you do
[1:10:49] anything you got faith in what you're
[1:10:51] doing
[1:10:52] no matter what that circumstance
[1:10:54] circumstances
[1:10:55] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:10:57] it masters that circumstance
[1:11:00] if it's in a room of sickness and the
[1:11:03] lord revealed that this certain thing is
[1:11:05] going to happen
[1:11:06] you just speaking and go on
[1:11:11] just don't ask any question it's
[1:11:14] already over now just keep going
[1:11:17] now to me that is one of the most that
[1:11:20] is the one of
[1:11:20] the most difficult things to get over in
[1:11:22] the human element
[1:11:24] is not asking anything because when you
[1:11:27] can tell somebody when the word of the
[1:11:29] lord would come and it would anoint you
[1:11:30] to say a certain word
[1:11:32] you'll watch as that human and they'll
[1:11:34] begin to well they'll begin to ask so
[1:11:35] now now does this got to be in place or
[1:11:37] does that got to be in place
[1:11:39] no you just take him at his word and
[1:11:41] when you you you
[1:11:42] set everything in order and the hat is
[1:11:45] in place
[1:11:46] and the promises are in line you know
[1:11:48] that it's got to come to pass
[1:11:50] you see if you can line yourself up with
[1:11:53] what the vision
[1:11:54] says then the vision will speak you
[1:11:56] ain't got to ask well do i got to do
[1:11:58] this do i got to wear this
[1:11:59] or do i have to do this everything just
[1:12:02] comes to pass
[1:12:03] because perfect faith don't ask
[1:12:07] perfect faith ain't asking do i take
[1:12:09] this perfect faith ain't asking what
[1:12:11] about this situation
[1:12:13] what about my family history what about
[1:12:15] the things i've dealt with
[1:12:17] perfect faith don't ask perfect faith is
[1:12:19] settled
[1:12:21] perfect faith is looking at a perfect
[1:12:23] word that brings to pass a perfect
[1:12:25] result
[1:12:28] hallelujah you see faith believes that
[1:12:31] god will work it out
[1:12:36] you know every one of us we we have we
[1:12:39] have days when we feel like we're on top
[1:12:41] of the mountain
[1:12:42] we got days when we feel like we're the
[1:12:44] only one
[1:12:45] on the face of the earth and anybody
[1:12:48] ever had them moments in life when it
[1:12:50] feels like it's raining
[1:12:52] raining all day long and the sun ain't
[1:12:54] shining
[1:12:56] and you feel like your whole your whole
[1:12:58] uh
[1:12:59] acquire your whole attire that you're
[1:13:01] wearing is completely soaked out
[1:13:02] and one thing i hate in life is wet
[1:13:04] socks but you you get through when you
[1:13:07] ever feel like you're going through
[1:13:09] you're going through that it's just a
[1:13:10] raining period if it's going to happen
[1:13:13] to anybody it's going to happen to me
[1:13:15] if it wasn't for a bad luck or wouldn't
[1:13:17] have no luck at all
[1:13:19] and you're going through life and you're
[1:13:21] going through these circumstances and
[1:13:23] you feel like you know what all all the
[1:13:26] all the puddles of life have just soaked
[1:13:28] in your socks
[1:13:30] and you're completely soaked to the bone
[1:13:32] and you're sitting there
[1:13:33] saying is this really happening to me
[1:13:37] now i could see if it happened to sister
[1:13:39] susie back there
[1:13:40] because she ain't been living right but
[1:13:43] this is happening to me
[1:13:45] but i got good news for you god's the
[1:13:48] god of the rain
[1:13:49] and he knows when to stop it and he's
[1:13:51] god of the sun
[1:13:52] and he knows when to shine on you
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:57] you can go through some stuff but keep
[1:13:59] your head
[1:14:00] up don't get so consumed with your
[1:14:03] circumstance
[1:14:04] that you hallelujah that you
[1:14:07] become more of a circumstance than your
[1:14:10] circumstance
[1:14:11] is attached to you you ever met somebody
[1:14:15] that all they ever have
[1:14:16] is problems that you no longer know them
[1:14:19] by their name you know them by their
[1:14:21] problems
[1:14:22] you don't ask them how they're doing
[1:14:24] because they're going to give you a
[1:14:25] 20-minute spill on how they're doing
[1:14:28] you just add you just go by them and you
[1:14:30] no longer say
[1:14:31] hey how you doing you just say god bless
[1:14:33] you
[1:14:35] but there's sometimes people go through
[1:14:37] life and they're looking
[1:14:38] and they're down in the moly grubs and
[1:14:40] they think it can't get no worse than
[1:14:42] this
[1:14:44] wake up there's somebody out there
[1:14:47] that's going through a worse storm than
[1:14:49] what you're going through
[1:14:57] let me say this to you maybe maybe it'll
[1:15:01] help somebody
[1:15:03] i remember days when i thought that life
[1:15:06] would just would always continue and i
[1:15:08] would be filled with that same
[1:15:10] that same energy that i had at 15 and 17
[1:15:13] years old and there was stuff running
[1:15:14] through my veins
[1:15:16] that couldn't be controlled and you if
[1:15:17] you would put it on the inside of a
[1:15:18] horse
[1:15:19] he'd win a kentucky derby every single
[1:15:21] time and there was things running in my
[1:15:23] veins and i thought that i was bigger
[1:15:25] than life
[1:15:26] and that everybody everybody that i was
[1:15:28] a party and everybody needed to be
[1:15:30] around me
[1:15:30] and i thought that life would not stop
[1:15:33] and you ever get that mentality so i
[1:15:35] know young people go through it all the
[1:15:36] time when they they feel
[1:15:38] like they're invincible that they ain't
[1:15:39] got to wear their seatbelt in life and
[1:15:41] they can just roll through life
[1:15:43] and nothing's ever going to happen to
[1:15:45] them
[1:15:46] i know what i'm talking about i was in
[1:15:49] that spot where i thought that i was
[1:15:51] invincible
[1:15:52] but i i love it when reality sets in
[1:15:56] and sometimes when i would get to that
[1:15:58] spot
[1:15:59] when i would get to that spot in life
[1:16:01] when i thought i was invincible
[1:16:03] and that i was superman and i had the s
[1:16:05] all over my shirt
[1:16:07] spelled spencer superman i thought i was
[1:16:09] really something
[1:16:11] then my dad would give me a reality
[1:16:13] check
[1:16:14] he would take my invincible self
[1:16:18] to a nursing home and he would point to
[1:16:22] people
[1:16:23] that were great men and women in life
[1:16:25] that were full of ambition
[1:16:27] for they were presidents and banks they
[1:16:30] were great men great lawyers
[1:16:34] life came by their way
[1:16:37] and he would point me to these things
[1:16:39] maybe it's time that some young people
[1:16:42] start revisiting some nursing homes and
[1:16:45] realizing
[1:16:46] that life is bigger than your emotions
[1:16:49] and life is bigger than your
[1:16:51] circumstances
[1:16:53] there's somebody going through something
[1:16:55] worse
[1:16:56] than what you're going through
[1:17:00] most people didn't think they'd ever end
[1:17:02] up there but life
[1:17:04] continued on a path and it put them in a
[1:17:06] bed where they didn't even know their
[1:17:07] name
[1:17:13] life is real life
[1:17:16] is real
[1:17:22] i won't say the person i was speaking to
[1:17:25] just for
[1:17:26] security reasons but i was i was on the
[1:17:29] phone with one of my friends yesterday
[1:17:31] evening
[1:17:31] and they began to tell me about a story
[1:17:35] more than a story but a person
[1:17:38] that was bound to a wheelchair all of
[1:17:40] their life
[1:17:42] been through everything imaginable went
[1:17:45] through surgery after surgery had webbed
[1:17:47] hands and
[1:17:48] everything imaginable went to uva all
[1:17:50] the time and was going through certain
[1:17:52] going through anything and everything
[1:17:54] unimaginable but yet this man had a
[1:17:57] positive attitude
[1:17:59] and they began to relate to them what
[1:18:01] their pastor would tell them that if you
[1:18:03] can
[1:18:03] if you can look at philippians chapter 4
[1:18:06] and verse 8
[1:18:07] that whatsoever things are just
[1:18:09] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:18:11] things are pure
[1:18:12] think on these things that if you can
[1:18:14] take this scripture
[1:18:16] and let this be your motto in life it
[1:18:18] will change your life
[1:18:19] well this man's name was eddie he was
[1:18:21] bound to a wheelchair
[1:18:23] with through all of these circumstances
[1:18:25] went through life
[1:18:27] but he had the right mental attitude and
[1:18:30] he said if i can think on these things

[1:18:35] and he and he made this comment

[1:18:51] wheelchair bound to circumstances

[1:19:01] thinking

[1:25:48] through the prayer line
[1:25:49] and they all obeyed they had obeyed what
[1:25:52] god said
[1:25:53] and how the angel went and passed
[1:25:55] through the neighborhood to remember
[1:25:56] that story
[1:25:57] how that the one woman had stomach
[1:25:59] trouble and she had the issues and she
[1:26:01] couldn't eat
[1:26:01] and the other lady had had a border on

[1:26:06] and they had went by and they went
[1:26:08] through the went through the line and
[1:26:09] brother branham told him to go on

[1:26:16] how that that lady that she went on
[1:26:18] professing her healing
[1:26:20] even though she would get sick every day
[1:26:23] if she would eat something
[1:26:24] he would come back up and her daughter
[1:26:27] even her daughter
[1:26:28] said mama you're bringing a reproach to
[1:26:31] the cause of jesus christ
[1:26:32] but she kept on testifying now this is
[1:26:36] what brother branham said
[1:26:37] he said because she went out and tried
[1:26:39] to obey
[1:26:41] what the lord told her to do the angel
[1:26:44] passed through the neighborhood six
[1:26:46] weeks later
[1:26:48] i want to tell you you may try tonight
[1:26:51] to obey what he says
[1:26:52] but within six weeks he's coming by your
[1:26:55] way

[1:27:18] hallelujah
[1:27:21] well i can see we're going places
[1:27:25] tonight
[1:27:27] he says if you amount to anything you're
[1:27:30] going to stand for god
[1:27:32] and you'll stand alone it's you
[1:27:38] anybody can stand when everybody's
[1:27:40] standing with them
[1:27:42] but when you're the only one
[1:27:45] when you're the only one in the picture
[1:27:48] when you're the only one going through
[1:27:49] the battle
[1:27:50] but i read a statement this week your
[1:27:52] voice
[1:27:54] will end the battle
[1:27:57] hallelujah what if you're the only one
[1:28:00] and you're down in a hole fighting 800
[1:28:02] for listings
[1:28:03] you're the only one that can kill them
[1:28:05] philistines
[1:28:06] shamgar's family have been attacked over
[1:28:09] and over again
[1:28:10] but finally it hit him who am i
[1:28:14] i'm a royal seed of abraham
[1:28:17] i've obeyed the promises and i will not
[1:28:20] allow
[1:28:21] these circle uncircumcised philistines
[1:28:23] to destroy my family
[1:28:25] it's a time that the people of god rise
[1:28:28] up
[1:28:29] and they start saying to the devil i
[1:28:32] know who i am
[1:28:33] i know in whom i have belief and i'm not
[1:28:36] ashamed of him
[1:28:43] go ahead if you want to put a flight a
[1:28:45] thousand
[1:28:46] two ten thousand rise up church of the
[1:28:49] living god
[1:28:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:01] what time did you give it to me
[1:29:07] now samuel was the earliest hebrew
[1:29:10] prophet
[1:29:13] i'm just going to preach what's on my
[1:29:15] heart tonight i don't know how much
[1:29:17] longer
[1:29:17] i may go five more minutes ten more
[1:29:19] minutes i'm gonna preach to you
[1:29:21] and whatever's on my heart i think
[1:29:23] you'll receive it tonight but samuel
[1:29:25] samuel as we know was one of the
[1:29:27] earliest hebrew prophets
[1:29:29] that we see in the bible and we see that
[1:29:32] the
[1:29:32] that the word of the lord was that the
[1:29:35] word of the lord was precious in those
[1:29:37] days
[1:29:37] because there was no open vision and we
[1:29:40] know what a vision is it's the direct
[1:29:42] word of the lord and so we find
[1:29:46] so we find that when samuel is living in
[1:29:48] an hour
[1:29:49] it's an hour when there's no vision
[1:29:51] there's no word
[1:29:53] and the bible says in amos chapter 8 and
[1:29:55] 11
[1:29:56] that it would come a time that there
[1:29:58] would be a famine
[1:29:59] that it wouldn't be a famine for bread
[1:30:01] nor a thirst of water
[1:30:03] but it would be for the word and the
[1:30:05] hearing of the word of the lord
[1:30:07] and the bible tells us in proverbs
[1:30:09] chapter 29
[1:30:10] that where there is no vision the people
[1:30:14] perish
[1:30:15] and you see i want to tell you church of
[1:30:17] the living god
[1:30:18] we're not in famine
[1:30:21] you can look out on the world and you
[1:30:23] can see that everything that they're
[1:30:25] eating will not produce
[1:30:27] overcoming life it will not give them
[1:30:30] the authority
[1:30:31] to cast down satan in their life and
[1:30:33] overcome him
[1:30:34] by the word of testimony and by the
[1:30:36] blood of the lamb because they're living
[1:30:38] in a famine
[1:30:39] and they've got no open vision
[1:30:44] they don't have to stay that way
[1:30:48] but i want to tell you you are not in a
[1:30:51] famine
[1:30:52] you're in a feast you're the people of a
[1:30:55] vision
[1:30:59] you're the people of an open book you're
[1:31:01] the people
[1:31:02] that was testified and prophesy in job
[1:31:05] chapter 2
[1:31:06] and verse 28 that in the last days i
[1:31:08] will pour out my spirit
[1:31:10] upon all flesh
[1:31:14] hallelujah there is a time
[1:31:17] that was coming and i want to say to you
[1:31:19] this
[1:31:20] is that and the reason i can say this
[1:31:23] is that i was there i got the same holy
[1:31:26] ghost that peter got
[1:31:28] i got the same holy ghost that paul got
[1:31:30] i got the same holy ghost said mary got
[1:31:33] i got the same holy ghost that james got
[1:31:35] i got the same holy ghost that john got
[1:31:40] hallelujah i was there it happened to me
[1:31:44] you can't talk me out of it because i
[1:31:45] was there now you might be able to talk
[1:31:47] some of these pentecostals out here
[1:31:49] today
[1:31:49] on the outside of the courts you might
[1:31:51] be able to talk them out of their
[1:31:52] experience
[1:31:53] but you're not going to talk a real
[1:31:55] born-again son and daughter of god
[1:31:57] out of their experience they're just not
[1:31:59] a candle
[1:32:00] they've got a whole candle that's got
[1:32:02] tallow it's got a wick
[1:32:04] but the difference between the bride and
[1:32:06] pentecost is there's a fire
[1:32:12] there's a fire that only he could put
[1:32:14] there
[1:32:18] i know your family don't understand it
[1:32:20] but there's a fire
[1:32:21] that was put on the close of the altar
[1:32:24] you didn't put that fire there
[1:32:26] he put that fire there and if he put
[1:32:29] that fire there
[1:32:30] hell can't blow it out
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:38] hallelujah
[1:32:40] samuel was willing to stand against what
[1:32:44] he even knew
[1:32:45] [Applause]
[1:32:49] because this voice that was speaking to
[1:32:52] him
[1:32:54] told him things against where he was
[1:32:57] brought up in
[1:33:02] hallelujah
[1:33:05] he was born of an odd birth
[1:33:11] a peculiar child
[1:33:14] but when the voice came to him he began
[1:33:17] to tell him of all of eli's wrongdoings
[1:33:20] how that his sons were taking the flesh
[1:33:24] off they sacrificed
[1:33:26] how that they were doing all their own
[1:33:27] deeds and
[1:33:29] eli knew that the voice of the lord
[1:33:31] spoke to him
[1:33:32] and he said say on say on
[1:33:36] and he told him all of these deeds and
[1:33:38] you can look over in first samuel
[1:33:40] chapter four
[1:33:41] and you can see when the philistines
[1:33:42] came down and they attacked them
[1:33:46] they attacked them they destroyed him
[1:33:48] and when
[1:33:49] eli heard of his two sons that had been
[1:33:52] slain
[1:33:53] he fell back and died and his
[1:33:55] daughter-in-law was giving birth
[1:33:58] his daughter-in-law was giving birth to
[1:33:59] a son and when she heard the news she
[1:34:02] died
[1:34:06] and they named the child ichabod for the
[1:34:09] spirit of the lord had departed
[1:34:12] from israel and the ark of the lord had
[1:34:14] been stolen
[1:34:17] and when ichabod is wrote over your
[1:34:19] heart he is saying
[1:34:21] i will not address this again
[1:34:24] i will not come to this place again
[1:34:27] and that's what ichabod has written over
[1:34:30] so many churches in america that the
[1:34:33] glory of the lord that was once there
[1:34:36] is no longer there
[1:34:42] but be a good cheer ichabod has not
[1:34:45] rolled over your heart
[1:34:46] and nicobarg's not rolled over your life
[1:34:48] ichabod's not rolled over this
[1:34:50] church we've seen his glory we've
[1:34:52] witnessed this power
[1:34:53] we've seen his anointing we've heard him
[1:34:56] speak
[1:34:57] it's not just once in a while that the
[1:34:59] holy ghost falls here
[1:35:01] he has more of an attendance than some
[1:35:03] congregants are
[1:35:05] he's here he's active he's moving
[1:35:08] he's willing
[1:35:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:16] hallelujah
[1:35:20] the voice of god always meets the need
[1:35:22] of the hour
[1:35:25] and he's always on time he don't miss
[1:35:28] his moment
[1:35:28] he don't miss his opportunities right on
[1:35:30] time
[1:35:32] he didn't come to moses to tell him to
[1:35:34] build an ark
[1:35:35] to get ready i'm going to destroy the
[1:35:37] world by rain he didn't tell moses that
[1:35:40] that voice was not to him that voice was
[1:35:43] the noah
[1:35:45] what good would it have done for moses
[1:35:47] to build an ark
[1:35:49] that wasn't going to become a
[1:35:50] destruction like it was in noah's day
[1:35:54] hallelujah what good would it have been
[1:35:56] for noah to preach moses message
[1:35:58] it would have never done them no good
[1:36:01] hallelujah let me jump up here what good
[1:36:04] would it have done
[1:36:05] for wesley to come and preach the
[1:36:07] opening of the seals
[1:36:08] when he was not the messenger to open it
[1:36:11] it would not have done him no good
[1:36:13] he couldn't have done it you were still
[1:36:16] here
[1:36:17] you were still laying in the ground your
[1:36:19] 16 elements were still to come into
[1:36:21] existence
[1:36:23] and what good would it do for me to
[1:36:25] preach to you a methodist message
[1:36:27] that will not put you in a body change
[1:36:30] what good would it do for you to obey
[1:36:33] the voice of wesley
[1:36:34] when it will not over give you
[1:36:37] overcoming power
[1:36:38] of laodicea
[1:36:41] hallelujah but you have received a
[1:36:44] message
[1:36:45] and it come from the lips of god you can
[1:36:47] overcome
[1:36:48] you can beat laodicea you're not
[1:36:52] a part of her and she's not a part of
[1:36:54] you
[1:36:57] samuel was the kind of man that he took
[1:37:00] god's word
[1:37:02] and he spoke it
[1:37:06] i wonder what you would produce in your
[1:37:08] prayer
[1:37:12] some of you sisters you know what you
[1:37:13] prayed you know if you asked for your
[1:37:16] brothers you know what you asked for
[1:37:18] i wonder what you would produce in your
[1:37:20] prayer
[1:37:22] hannah was the kind of lady that could
[1:37:25] produce a prophet by prayer
[1:37:27] she knew the power of prayer and she got
[1:37:30] to such a spot
[1:37:31] that it was her approach to her that she
[1:37:33] couldn't bring fourth child
[1:37:36] and she got so sorrowful in her spirit
[1:37:38] that she went in before eli
[1:37:40] and she went in there and eli thought
[1:37:42] she was drunk
[1:37:45] because she was standing before him at
[1:37:47] the altar and she was standing there
[1:37:50] and her mouth was moving and nothing was
[1:37:52] coming out
[1:37:53] and he said go on put away that wine she
[1:37:56] said i'm not drunk
[1:37:59] i'm not drunk i'm only one to bring
[1:38:01] forth seed
[1:38:04] hallelujah oh i pray that you go
[1:38:07] you get so drunk on the holy ghost
[1:38:09] tonight
[1:38:11] you'd say this is not new wine this is
[1:38:13] not obvious but this is a wine that came
[1:38:16] from the divine
[1:38:17] and it will push through your life
[1:38:21] what would be produced in your life if
[1:38:23] you started praying like hannah prayed
[1:38:27] oh hallelujah what would you produce
[1:38:30] would you produce a samuel
[1:38:34] or would you produce like sarah did in
[1:38:36] the first act or would you produce an
[1:38:37] ishmael
[1:38:40] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:44] you have the ability by the power of
[1:38:46] prayer when you take your token
[1:38:48] and hold it over top of that prayer that
[1:38:50] you and the word are the same
[1:38:53] you can say what jesus said
[1:38:57] because you're simply obeying what he
[1:38:59] said and i want to put it to you like
[1:39:01] this
[1:39:02] this ain't too hard for you to do you
[1:39:04] ain't got to make up your own word
[1:39:05] jesus said you just follow what i say
[1:39:09] you speak to this mountain you ain't got
[1:39:12] to make up your own scriptures
[1:39:14] you ain't got to make up your own
[1:39:15] thoughts you ain't got to make up
[1:39:17] overcoming power
[1:39:18] he's already given to you
[1:39:22] obey receive accept to move forward
[1:39:28] mary took the angel's
[1:39:31] word and she believed it with everything
[1:39:34] that's within her
[1:39:38] i told you about this last weekend you
[1:39:41] hear it
[1:39:41] before you see it i told you about those
[1:39:44] jets flying over that you heard them
[1:39:46] before you seen them
[1:39:48] and you can look throughout the old
[1:39:49] testament you can look throughout the
[1:39:51] new testament
[1:39:52] and you can see you can hear about the
[1:39:54] promises
[1:39:55] and then you can see them come to pass
[1:39:57] and 800 years before mary
[1:40:00] ever came on the earth there was a
[1:40:02] prophet
[1:40:03] that was saying that a virgin shall
[1:40:06] conceive that
[1:40:08] promise was circling it was circling the
[1:40:11] world
[1:40:11] and it was waiting on mary to be coming
[1:40:14] to existence
[1:40:15] and it was waiting and it was waiting
[1:40:17] and when mary came
[1:40:20] hallelujah 16 year old girl that had
[1:40:23] been raised
[1:40:24] had been raised to obey that voice but
[1:40:27] there ain't nobody ever been walked
[1:40:29] had to walk like mary had to walk there
[1:40:31] ain't nobody ever had to obey like mary
[1:40:33] had to obey
[1:40:36] hallelujah jesus's first cousin had
[1:40:39] something
[1:40:40] his mama and daddy had something they
[1:40:41] could point back to of abraham and sarah
[1:40:44] that there was a promise of a child
[1:40:46] coming for 25 years
[1:40:48] they heard it before they seen it
[1:40:50] abraham heard about a son coming
[1:40:53] but when melchizedek come walking up his
[1:40:56] aisle oh may he come walking up your
[1:41:00] aisle this evening
[1:41:01] and when he come walking up his aisle he
[1:41:03] knew that the promise was coming
[1:41:05] for he was the one that had spoken he
[1:41:08] knew then
[1:41:08] he was getting ready to see it
[1:41:12] now science calls that the doppler
[1:41:15] effect
[1:41:16] that you hear something before you see
[1:41:18] something you ever gone down the road
[1:41:20] and you hear an ambulance coming
[1:41:24] and you can't necessarily pinpoint it
[1:41:26] where it's at
[1:41:27] science tells us that the farther that
[1:41:29] sound is away
[1:41:30] the longer the wavelength is but as it
[1:41:33] gets closer
[1:41:34] that wavelength is shortened up and you
[1:41:37] then can identify
[1:41:39] where that sound is coming from
[1:41:43] now mary had heard about those promises
[1:41:45] and it was a way stretched out for
[1:41:47] elijah or isaiah to speak those things
[1:41:50] and the wavelength was great long 800
[1:41:53] years
[1:41:54] but it was circling and it never did
[1:41:56] stop
[1:41:58] hallelujah there was a lot of people
[1:42:00] that heard it but they didn't see it
[1:42:02] but mary would be the one that that word
[1:42:06] would anchor in her womb
[1:42:07] and it would produce a child that would
[1:42:09] save his people from their sins
[1:42:12] she heard it then she saw it
[1:42:15] hallelujah
[1:42:19] hallelujah mary ate
[1:42:22] jesus's body right out of the ground
[1:42:28] she heard that angel's word she obeyed
[1:42:30] what he said
[1:42:31] and the angel said thou art highly
[1:42:32] favored
[1:42:36] and the bible said mary pondered these
[1:42:38] things in her heart
[1:42:42] oh hallelujah she was going to have to
[1:42:46] stand criticism for what she was going
[1:42:47] to say
[1:42:48] she was making herself she was making
[1:42:50] herself vulnerable
[1:42:52] that she was going to say that she was
[1:42:53] still virgin but she was bringing forth
[1:42:55] a child
[1:42:59] oh hallelujah and the more she ate the
[1:43:02] more jesus begin to grow
[1:43:04] i pray in the name of the lord as you go
[1:43:07] to eden that jesus starts growing on the
[1:43:10] inside of you
[1:43:11] and you start producing jesus's life
[1:43:13] jesus
[1:43:14] works jesus is wonders
[1:43:18] it's been circling the earth for quite
[1:43:20] some time
[1:43:21] that there's going to be a bride that'll
[1:43:23] be spotless
[1:43:24] that'll be blameless that'll be made
[1:43:26] whole and dressed in fine linen
[1:43:29] i say in the name of the lord it's found
[1:43:32] its domain
[1:43:40] it's coming it's coming it's coming
[1:43:44] and the word that was born in mary
[1:43:50] hallelujah is born in you and me
[1:44:00] she didn't care about the critics she
[1:44:02] didn't care about making herself liable
[1:44:04] and throw herself out there before the
[1:44:06] neighbors she began to testify before
[1:44:09] she ever seen
[1:44:09] anything on the inside i got a baby on
[1:44:12] the inside of me
[1:44:13] that's going to save you he's going to
[1:44:15] save your family
[1:44:16] he's going to heal your family he's
[1:44:18] going to deliver your family
[1:44:20] this baby that's on the inside of me
[1:44:24] he's going to pay the sin debt for the
[1:44:26] whole world
[1:44:29] before she ever felt little jesus start
[1:44:31] kicking on the inside
[1:44:32] she began to testify she was obeying
[1:44:35] what the voice said now what would take
[1:44:39] place
[1:44:40] before the holy ghost was ever given and
[1:44:42] a little lady 16 years old
[1:44:44] could let that word anchor in a heart
[1:44:46] what would it do if it would anchor in
[1:44:48] your heart
