[21:01] you're streaming and uh need that
[21:04] address again that is on our Facebook
[21:07] page there you can go and look that up
[21:10] and uh so just be remembering that
[21:12] there'll be some youth events and things
[21:14] going on there so just be remembering
[21:16] those things and like I said everyone
[21:18] traveling in um you can be seated after
[21:21] you've given
[21:25] um we want to remember that uh as you
[21:28] come in be reverent this is a school it
[21:30] is a public school so rules apply as a
[21:34] public school there will be no wondering
[21:36] uh there are cameras everywhere in these
[21:38] schools so just be mindful of all those
[21:41] things uh we will have just the
[21:44] restrooms that are provided there near
[21:46] the auditorium uh we'll have uh deacons
[21:50] and other ones that'll provide the
[21:51] parking and show you how to do those
[21:53] things and I believe brother Andrew may
[21:55] be uh showing you some of those things a
[21:57] little later here so uh we will have
[22:00] assistance getting in and out of the
[22:02] building showing where you need to go
[22:04] there so you won't have to wander around
[22:06] and wonder how to get into the school if
[22:08] you've never been there uh so want to
[22:10] remember the back rows we'd like to hold
[22:13] those for families with small children
[22:16] and uh those that have health problems
[22:18] issues um remember as you come in be
[22:21] reverent uh try to use the restroom
[22:23] before you go in and uh like I said last
[22:27] night there there is carpeted aisles but
[22:31] dur that within the chairs and rows it
[22:34] is tile floors so if you do carry a
[22:38] water just be mindful that it may ding
[22:42] hit the floor if it does roll like I
[22:44] said last night down
[22:47] the the floor brother Gabe will receive
[22:50] a new water bottle it won't come back to
[22:54] you amen like I said if you're that
[22:56] dehydrated that you need a to leader in
[22:59] service um please see us we need to
[23:03] pray um but uh if you need something to
[23:07] drink there is a water fountain provided
[23:10] there so uh we will have that and uh
[23:14] just be mindful that uh we want everyone
[23:17] to try to fill up the rows at the front
[23:19] and then work in not filling up just the
[23:22] in seats and uh just work back from
[23:26] there the last few rows will be roped
[23:29] off until we fill up those rows so as
[23:33] far as timing I believe the doors are
[23:35] going to open within an hour and 20
[23:37] minutes before service um I know here in
[23:41] the past we've opened up Service uh
[23:44] within 3 hours so people can get the
[23:46] seat that they'd like but uh due to it
[23:48] being at a school we only have certain
[23:50] time frames that we can work with so
[23:53] that is the time before the schedule
[23:56] meeting start that we can open those
[23:58] doors if you have any needs please see
[24:02] one of the deacons if uh someone that is
[24:05] visiting needs Assistance or questions
[24:08] please just we will try to just meet
[24:11] each and every one of those needs that
[24:12] we can uh come in at least 30 minutes
[24:15] before uh not last minute and uh be
[24:19] reverent praying reading your scriptures
[24:22] and uh just be mindful that yes it is a
[24:24] school but this is also going to be the
[24:26] house of the Lord for that weekend amen

[35:31] expressing their gratitude for having
[35:33] these meetings and we're just we're
[35:35] happy that we can host a meeting like
[35:37] this and the Lord has blessed us uh in a
[35:39] way that we can do that and not just
[35:41] have not just have speakers but have men
[35:44] of God that have been used by the Lord
[35:47] for not just not just a day or so but
[35:49] these men of God have been well trained
[35:51] and and we've seen the Lord use them
[35:53] here in these meetings time and time
[35:55] again and we're just very excited about
[35:57] it all and we wanted to uh just kind of
[36:00] go over some things brother Matthew's
[36:01] already went over some things but we
[36:03] know human beings so sometimes you just
[36:05] have to reiterate some things reiterate
[36:07] some things and so we just want to also
[36:10] show you a few glimpses of what the
[36:12] school the entrance is going to be like
[36:14] and how most of us have been there that
[36:17] have grew up in this area have been
[36:18] there but some of us have not so we
[36:20] wanted to just kind of show you the path
[36:22] of our our parking and then the entrance
[36:24] to the building that way anybody here
[36:27] and anybody that is streaming will
[36:29] understand how we're going to enter into
[36:31] the building if you wouldn't mind just
[36:32] showing that to us here this morning as
[36:35] you can see this is overhead of the of
[36:38] the Mont video Middle School there there
[36:40] are two ways that you can come depending
[36:43] on your uh your destination how you're
[36:45] coming but as you see the very part
[36:48] front of the church or front of the
[36:50] school building is the entrance to the
[36:52] auditorium and the the white lines is
[36:55] how we would like you to travel through
[36:57] your path um just starting there if
[37:00] you're coming off of 33 you will
[37:02] actually pass uh the school just in a
[37:04] way just go right past it and enter
[37:07] right there at the the second um the
[37:10] second line there and just enter in you
[37:12] will we will have deacons ushers and
[37:14] parking attendance that will be there to
[37:16] help you uh find your place and uh if
[37:20] you can go to the next to the next scene
[37:22] there and this is the entrance there's a
[37:24] couple ways that we can get into the
[37:26] building but this is how we would like
[37:28] for you to enter if you're looking at
[37:29] the building straight on there are two
[37:31] entrances but we would like for you to
[37:33] take the entrance to the right and so if
[37:36] you need to just go back and find this
[37:38] on the on the streaming you'll be able
[37:40] to see that you can take a picture of it
[37:42] if you have some if you have trouble you
[37:44] just find the find the address for Mont
[37:46] videoo middle school and there'll be
[37:48] brothers there to help you help you find
[37:50] your way there so I I don't believe
[37:52] you'll have too much of an issue but as
[37:54] we as brother Matthew stated we're going
[37:56] to open the school
[37:58] an hour and a half before the service
[38:00] and that is that's just to allow our
[38:02] parking attendants to be there to kind
[38:05] of set themselves up and and make sure
[38:08] that uh everything is right uh there'll
[38:11] be no parking in the red fire lines fa
[38:15] fire lanes and so just make sure you
[38:17] don't park there because we will not pay
[38:19] your ticket if you park there and they
[38:21] give you one you have been warned so uh
[38:25] we want to be just mindful of saving
[38:28] seats we we want you to save your family
[38:31] seats but just be mindful of it because
[38:33] if it if it gets tight we will slide you
[38:36] in don't get upset at the deacons or the
[38:38] ushers they have full authority to to
[38:41] move you in we we just want to make this
[38:43] meeting as great as possible and I'd
[38:45] like just now if we could have all of

[41:34] if you come here we will not be here the
[41:36] Rapture did not take place un let it

[41:58] just one more announcement if I could we
[42:01] need one more uh big cooler uh for the
[42:04] weekend if anybody if anybody has one
[42:07] don't raise your hand right now just go
[42:08] talk to brother alen we only need one
[42:11] but we need we need a we need a pretty
[42:13] good size one if you have one and you're
[42:14] willing to share it uh we' be we'd be
[42:17] willing to take it so and uh make sure
[42:19] you put your name on there cuz I can
[42:21] tell you sometimes when you go to a
[42:24] church event it's amazing the things
[42:26] that you lose
[42:29] so if you got a blue if you got if you
[42:31] got a shovel or you got a rake that's
[42:33] got blue paint on it I guarantee you
[42:35] that it belongs to one person in this
[42:36] building that's brother Ron
[42:38] Spencer it's amazing how many shovels
[42:41] and how many things you can lose at a
[42:42] church event not that they're thieves
[42:44] but man they just think you're blessing
[42:46] them sometimes
[42:50] so no we understand we've come out with
[42:53] some pretty good things ourselves so
[43:02] oh praise the Lord I I know that we
[43:04] don't have to worry about you being
[43:06] disruptive you're the most powerful
[43:08] people you're the most wonderful people
[43:11] and I think it's wonderful that you we
[43:13] have to make statements like this
[43:15] because sometimes it's like the prophet
[43:17] preached there's three kind of Believers
[43:20] and real Believers don't have to be
[43:21] taught how to handle themselves but you
[43:23] have to make statements like that just
[43:25] to just to kind of lay a foundation for
[43:28] those that are in a spot of unbelieving
[43:31] and just so that they understand CU a
[43:33] lot of people have not been churched we
[43:35] don't get excited we don't get excited
[43:37] when somebody comes here and they don't
[43:39] understand the order of the church and
[43:41] they don't understand how deacons work
[43:42] we don't get excited about that because
[43:44] we realize that there's a lot of people
[43:46] that have not been churched in their
[43:48] life that they've come here for the very
[43:49] first time they they've been in they've
[43:51] been in an experience like there's a lot
[43:53] of people that have not had church
[43:56] church order in their so we we have to
[43:58] say those things just to lay a
[44:01] foundation for the for the church
[44:03] services and we're very very well
[44:05] looking forward to it I believe you
[44:07] sisters know there that sister Connie
[44:10] and sister Katy are going to need some
[44:12] help Thursday evening and uh they're
[44:15] setting up some things for the weekend
[44:16] we're going to be setting up on Thursday
[44:19] um on Thursday evening and today after
[44:23] service we're going to be tearing down
[44:24] our sound system and cameras and all of
[44:26] that and be filling a trailer so we can
[44:28] take it so any brothers that would
[44:30] wouldn't mind just kind of helping us we
[44:32] don't need we don't need every brother
[44:34] but we do need some help and and uh if
[44:36] you're willing to work and roll your
[44:38] sleeves up we're willing to put you to
[44:39] work so so we just we just love the Lord
[44:42] with all of our heart we want to be
[44:43] remembering brother Timothy brother Tim
[44:46] and brother Donnie Reagan as we are
[44:48] coming into these meetings but I want
[44:50] you to know that today is a great day
[44:54] today a great day and you don't have to
[44:55] wait till next weekend to have church
[44:58] you don't have to wait and anticipate
[45:00] for that we got a man of God that should
[45:02] have been dead four or five years ago
[45:05] that's going to be standing behind this
[45:06] pull pit according to doctors they said
[45:09] he shouldn't be here but according to
[45:11] his report we got a man of God that's
[45:15] willing to stand here and preach the
[45:17] message of the hour and we want to put
[45:19] our whole heart I believe I don't

[56:06] we're just honored and I'll never forget
[56:09] the days that brother Homer told me said
[56:10] you know Andrew is a
[56:12] preacher and I think now that I think
[56:15] now if he could look over Heaven he'd
[56:17] say you're really a preacher so amen
[56:20] amen so we're just thankful for that
[56:32] of course Matthew he would say that
[56:33] about we were on our way to his
[56:35] graduation at Police Service and and he
[56:39] was beginning to talk about how that uh
[56:42] how he remembered when he became a real
[56:45] man mature brother Homer was saying it
[56:49] and brother Thomas you know how he would
[56:51] he would he he was all he just a little
[56:54] bit full of himself and so he say you
[56:57] know Matthew's a real man he's a real
[56:59] man we got to the red light there before
[57:01] we were to go in to ral's restaurant
[57:03] where our celebration was going to be at
[57:06] and he he said you know he's a real man
[57:08] he's he's a real man and I just asked
[57:11] him I said what do you think about me
[57:13] and brother Andrew he said never make it
[57:15] you'll just never make
[57:23] it Hallelujah so that's why we put the
[57:26] load on brother Matthew and he's a real
[57:42] man I want to say something else before
[57:45] we get into the word I we have a new we
[57:47] have a new member a new version brother
[57:50] Jimmy props amen he's a new version he's

[58:06] new man just a new man and I I want to
[58:11] say how much I I I'm so happy I'm so
[58:14] happy about that you know I don't like

[58:26] just so happy and so we're just so
[58:28] thrilled about that amen if you will
[58:30] turn with me to Luke 10 and verse
[58:36] 21 last night was just a masterpiece of
[58:39] a service and we don't say that just to
[58:42] say that we we just are so thrilled and
[58:46] and you're the pullers of the word and
[58:48] so you pull all of this out and so so
[58:51] today I want to speak to you on the
[58:54] expectation of Exodus
[58:57] amen I I shared that with brother George
[59:00] Quinn yesterday and he said where do you
[59:02] get those titles from well brother
[59:05] brandham and so I I shared that with him
[59:09] Luke chap 10 and verse
[59:13] 21 and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[59:16] spirit and said I thank thee oh Father
[59:19] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has
[59:22] hid these
[59:23] things from the wise and prudent
[59:26] and has revealed them unto the babes
[59:28] even so
[59:30] father for so it seemed good in thy
[59:33] sight and all things are delivered to me
[59:36] of my father and and no man knoweth who
[59:39] the son is but the father and who the
[59:42] father is but the son and he to whom the
[59:45] son will reveal him that's quite a
[59:48] statement incredible scripture and he
[59:51] turned him unto the disciples and he
[59:53] said privately
[59:56] and I want to say this to you blessed
[59:59] are the eyes which see the things that
[1:00:02] ye
[1:00:04] see for I tell you that many prophets
[1:00:07] and Kings have desired to see those
[1:00:10] things which you see and have not seen
[1:00:13] them and to hear those things which you
[1:00:16] hear and have not heard
[1:00:19] them more than just for an exercise I I
[1:00:22] want to read this the scripture together
[1:00:26] this last scripture and I tell you that
[1:00:29] many prophets and Kings have desired to
[1:00:33] see those things which you see and have
[1:00:36] not seen them and to hear those things
[1:00:39] which you hear and have not heard them
[1:00:43] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:00:44] word you may be
[1:00:47] seated haven't forgot you brother
[1:00:49] Jonathan and sister re so glad to have
[1:00:52] you guys with us and amen so honored
[1:00:54] that you would be here with with us from
[1:00:56] Brother Tom Rays brother Bisal and we're
[1:00:59] so honored that you're here I want to
[1:01:02] share with you brother Brandon says we
[1:01:05] see this age that we're living
[1:01:08] in it's one of the grandest ages of all
[1:01:12] ages this Leo ofan Church age is the
[1:01:15] grandest of all the church
[1:01:17] ages because it's the ending of time and
[1:01:22] the blending of
[1:01:24] Eternity and then it's the greatest
[1:01:27] sinful
[1:01:28] age it's more sin in this age than
[1:01:31] there's ever been and the powers of
[1:01:35] Satan is many times harder to fight
[1:01:39] against than it was in any age now
[1:01:45] that's the prophet of our day sharing
[1:01:48] those words about our day but he not
[1:01:51] only could see the lot of seean church
[1:01:53] age but he could look forward
[1:01:58] he could look forward and see in the
[1:02:01] marriage supper of the lamb and the
[1:02:03] resurrection and the bride coming to her
[1:02:06] maturity I believe brother brandom would
[1:02:08] be very proud to look at this audience
[1:02:11] and audiences around the world and see
[1:02:14] us more than just a Pentecostal
[1:02:18] move more than just God said a prophet
[1:02:21] but to realize who you
[1:02:24] are to realize who you are and this is
[1:02:27] more than just this next verse is more
[1:02:29] than just a prophetic verse but it's a
[1:02:32] verse that we're getting ready to step
[1:02:34] into and I heard as Revelations 19:6 I'm
[1:02:38] sorry sister Stephanie and I heard as it
[1:02:40] were a voice of a great multitude as a
[1:02:43] voice of Great Waters and as a voice of
[1:02:46] Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for
[1:02:49] the Lord God omnipotent reign us let us
[1:02:53] be glad and rejoice and give honor to to
[1:02:56] him for the marriage of the Lamb is
[1:03:00] come now this verse is happening and his
[1:03:04] wife hath made herself
[1:03:07] ready and to her was granted that she
[1:03:10] should be ar raid and fine linen clean
[1:03:13] and white for the fine linen is
[1:03:16] the is the righteousness of the
[1:03:19] Saints and he saith unto me right
[1:03:23] blessed are they which are called to the
[1:03:26] married supper of the lamb and he saith
[1:03:29] unto me these are the true sayings of
[1:03:34] God aren't you glad of that
[1:03:36] today now understand you needed of
[1:03:42] invitation you needed an invitation you

[1:05:28] very familiar scriptures 1 Thessalonians
[1:05:31] chapter 5 and verse one but of the times
[1:05:35] of the Season Brethren ye have no need
[1:05:37] that I write unto you for yourselves
[1:05:40] know perfectly that the day of the Lord
[1:05:43] so cometh as a thief in the
[1:05:46] night and when they say peace and safety
[1:05:50] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:05:53] as travaileth upon a woman which child
[1:05:56] and they shall not Escape but ye
[1:05:59] Brethren are not in
[1:06:03] darkness ye Brethren are not in
[1:06:07] darkness that ought to cause you with
[1:06:09] have an expectation like never before ye
[1:06:13] are not in darkness that that day should
[1:06:16] overtake you as a thief ye are all the
[1:06:19] children of the light and the children
[1:06:21] of the day and you're not of the night
[1:06:24] nor of the darkness
[1:06:26] you want to shout now
[1:06:29] or hallelujah how did we get here he
[1:06:32] brought us
[1:06:33] here therefore let us not sleep as do
[1:06:36] others but let us watch and be sober for
[1:06:40] they that sleep sleep in the night and
[1:06:42] they that are drunken are drunken in the
[1:06:45] night but let us who are of the day be
[1:06:48] sober putting on the breastplate of
[1:06:50] faith and love and for a helmet of of of
[1:06:53] and the hope of the Salvation
[1:06:57] let's read this next scripture together
[1:06:59] for God hath not appointed us to wrath
[1:07:04] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[1:07:07] Jesus Christ he has not appointed us to
[1:07:10] a tribulation
[1:07:17] period brother Doug let us remind oursel
[1:07:20] of one thing the tribulation period
[1:07:23] brother brand said the Holocaust with
[1:07:25] would be like a Sunday afternoon picnic
[1:07:29] that's right and that's what we're
[1:07:31] getting ready to escape
[1:07:35] from a lot of people say what the
[1:07:38] Holocaust was a myth let me just remind
[1:07:41] you those Jews were being driven back to
[1:07:47] Israel are you with
[1:07:49] me six million Jews gave their life
[1:07:55] for being a
[1:07:58] Jew but God has prepared white robes for
[1:08:01] every one of them their life was not
[1:08:04] given in vain
[1:08:07] God God has rich in
[1:08:11] Mercy the devil don't ever
[1:08:14] win he never wins the one that's
[1:08:17] fighting your life and tormenting you
[1:08:20] while he only has a chance he's a loser
[1:08:31] Psalms chapter 27 which is the verses
[1:08:33] that brother Brandon preached on as the
[1:08:35] Rapture the Lord is my light and my
[1:08:38] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:08:41] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[1:08:43] be afraid when the wicked even my
[1:08:46] enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat
[1:08:48] up my flesh they stumbled and fell
[1:08:50] though a host should encamp against me
[1:08:53] my heart shall not fear though War shall
[1:08:56] rise against me and this will I be
[1:08:57] confident one thing that I have desired
[1:09:00] of the Lord that will I seek after that
[1:09:02] I may dwell in the house of the
[1:09:05] Lord all the days of my life to behold
[1:09:08] the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in
[1:09:10] his Temple for in the time of trouble
[1:09:14] we're
[1:09:16] here for in the time of trouble he shall
[1:09:20] hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of
[1:09:23] his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he
[1:09:26] shall set me set up me upon a
[1:09:32] rock how powerful that
[1:09:36] is Hebrews 11 and verse 8 by faith
[1:09:40] Abraham when he was called to go out
[1:09:42] after a
[1:09:43] place which he should after receive for
[1:09:46] an inheritance
[1:09:48] obey and he went out not knowing whether
[1:09:51] he went and by faith he sojourned in the
[1:09:54] land of promise as in a strange country
[1:09:57] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[1:09:59] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[1:10:02] promise notice these next words for he
[1:10:05] looked for a
[1:10:08] city which had
[1:10:10] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:10:18] God how did he know he met the
[1:10:23] king now there was special special
[1:10:25] promises that was given unto
[1:10:27] Abraham first of all these God spoke to
[1:10:31] him not that only was going to have a
[1:10:34] child and it was going to come through
[1:10:36] Sarah but he said these words thy
[1:10:40] seed shall possess the gates of their
[1:10:46] enemy talked about a sojourning that the
[1:10:48] children would
[1:10:50] be let me just say this to you those
[1:10:53] those promises that he made to Abraham
[1:10:58] they were passed down maybe even in
[1:11:00] story form promises that were were given
[1:11:05] from God himself to
[1:11:07] Abraham and as it would go to Isaac and
[1:11:11] then to
[1:11:12] Jacob then to Joseph and his Brethren
[1:11:16] and they would sojourn in in Egypt for
[1:11:22] for about 400 years
[1:11:25] and at first they wasn't
[1:11:30] slaves at first they wasn't slaves it's
[1:11:34] kind of like sin at first it didn't seem
[1:11:38] like it was a treacherous
[1:11:41] trap and you were talked into it or you
[1:11:43] were moved into it but after a while you
[1:11:46] became a slave to
[1:11:48] it but at first and you know even in
[1:11:52] Goan they had the better Farms they had
[1:11:55] the better lands they had the better
[1:11:57] Foods they had the better the Better
[1:12:00] Properties because God was always with
[1:12:04] them even being slaves God was always
[1:12:07] the light was always with them because
[1:12:10] of who they were but there was a promise
[1:12:13] to them that you always won't be
[1:12:17] here you won't stay here and as they go
[1:12:21] get near to the promised time of 400
[1:12:24] years and now we go past 400 years we go
[1:12:28] 40 years past and God sends them a
[1:12:30] prophet to remind
[1:12:35] them is everybody okay to remind them of
[1:12:40] who they were and who God was and how
[1:12:44] powerful God was and God began to show
[1:12:47] his signs among them fleas and all of
[1:12:50] the different things and water turning
[1:12:52] into blood frogs and then there was a
[1:12:56] promise of a
[1:12:58] token I'd like to say this to you we're
[1:13:02] we are watching amen if you've got any
[1:13:06] any spiritual being at all we're
[1:13:08] watching prophecy being
[1:13:12] fulfilled we're watching brother bram's
[1:13:15] words being fulfilled I'm not going to
[1:13:17] brother Tim PR made a long list that
[1:13:20] that goes with camia and he made a a a
[1:13:24] long list of brother bram's words and it
[1:13:26] was phenomenal I'll be honest with you I
[1:13:28] don't know if some of you could handle
[1:13:32] it but Elijah told us that's the way it
[1:13:35] would
[1:13:37] be and and I I just want I'm going to
[1:13:39] say something pretty strong here Donald
[1:13:42] Trump is fighting with
[1:13:46] prophecy he's fighting with prophecy I

[1:14:44] college and she said we have a neutral
[1:14:47] gender bathroom and and that's the way

[1:27:18] was headed for New Zealand and I was I
[1:27:20] was there two men was sitting be beside
[1:27:23] of me and one guy was talking about the
[1:27:25] earthquakes that happened in Los Angeles
[1:27:28] and he the man that was sitting beside
[1:27:29] him he was a welder he had been away
[1:27:31] doing jobs and he and the guy beside him
[1:27:34] him says do you ever get used to these

[1:28:28] surprised that's
[1:28:30] right listen the children of Israel were
[1:28:33] not surprised they put the L on their
[1:28:36] door they made sure it was there cuz the
[1:28:39] death angel was
[1:28:41] coming this wasn't a political move it
[1:28:44] was a spiritual move and death was
[1:28:48] coming Saints let me just preach it to
[1:28:51] it death has come through Leota and the
[1:28:54] church World Is
[1:28:58] Dead kabot is on their

[1:29:05] return to them but there is a bride that
[1:29:08] has made her self
[1:29:19] ready now I'd like to just liken this
[1:29:28] to a couple of different
[1:29:30] things there was a a
[1:29:33] broker that bought
[1:29:36] slaves wasn't right slavery just didn't

[1:29:56] commanders or Dallas Cowboys people
[1:30:00] become slaves to those
[1:30:04] things but the broker was he looked over
[1:30:07] everybody and he
[1:30:09] said I'd like to buy that one oh he said
[1:30:12] he's not for
[1:30:13] sale he's not for sale and he began to
[1:30:16] talk to him

[1:30:31] to buy him he said you know he's he's
[1:30:33] not in the Blues and he's a hard worker
[1:30:36] and he's got a wonderful attitude and
[1:30:39] and you
[1:30:40] know he said uh he said you know as an
[1:30:43] owner owner of him he said I was
[1:30:45] wondering about
[1:30:47] that and he said I begin to do some
[1:30:51] research that back in his home homel
[1:30:54] land his father is a
[1:30:58] king come
[1:31:01] on but though he be in a foreign
[1:31:06] land and though he be a slave he
[1:31:09] continues to conduct himself oh I feel
[1:31:13] like blowing up right

[1:31:18] himself like a King's
[1:31:21] son Hallelujah

[1:37:12] importance because they knew and let

[1:39:06] dirt that's coming down you got to put
[1:39:08] it in its place it's a
[1:39:13] commitment amen I thought it was a
[1:39:16] phenomenal thing to be a part of let me
[1:39:18] just say we just didn't leave
[1:39:21] denomination we are committed
[1:39:26] we just didn't come here to believe God
[1:39:29] sent a
[1:39:30] prophet we came here for this message is
[1:39:34] us we want to eat the book and take it
[1:39:37] in we want to become a reflection of
[1:39:40] what it
[1:39:42] is we want that life it's in there to be
[1:39:45] more than a quote we want it to be a
[1:39:47] living
[1:39:50] reality is that right ain't that
[1:39:55] right now let me let me stay with some
[1:39:59] meat here for a little
[1:40:02] bit he says therefore you can rest
[1:40:05] assured that what God has promised in
[1:40:08] the
[1:40:09] Bible he is going to do
[1:40:13] it as I listened to several broadcasts
[1:40:16] this morning about the attempted
[1:40:18] destruction of Israel listen they're
[1:40:21] they're trying their very best to drive
[1:40:22] Israel into the
[1:40:24] sea but I've got tomorrow's newspaper
[1:40:28] they're not going to do
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:32] it in that recent barrage that Iran sin
[1:40:36] against Israel it cost their economy
[1:40:39] over
[1:40:40] $550
[1:40:42] million that's quite an expense but
[1:40:45] Freedom's worth
[1:40:49] it the barrage that was sent against
[1:40:52] them this morning they they sent just
[1:40:54] one missile that cost them $3.5
[1:40:58] million I'm not just talking about
[1:41:00] Israel there's going to be some things
[1:41:01] that you're going to have to fight
[1:41:03] against and you're going to have to send
[1:41:05] the biggest missile that you got and it
[1:41:08] may be at Great cost but just go ahead
[1:41:10] and send
[1:41:12] it and they hated him without a cause
[1:41:16] they should not have hated him they
[1:41:18] should have respected him because why
[1:41:21] did they hate him because he was a
[1:41:24] brother not exactly that they hated him
[1:41:27] because God dealt with him more than he
[1:41:30] did the rest of
[1:41:33] them they hated
[1:41:39] Joseph same
[1:41:41] message did not the Bible say in
[1:41:44] Revelations 13 that where this nation
[1:41:48] appears this nation is numbered 13 a
[1:41:52] woman's Nation ation it's a woman in the
[1:41:55] Bible woman is is on our coins it's on
[1:41:59] her it's a woman's
[1:42:01] Nation it's where the rotness of women
[1:42:04] begins starts it's where it ends at the
[1:42:08] rotness started in Eden by disbelieving
[1:42:12] God's word and here is where it's
[1:42:15] hatched out and women preachers and
[1:42:16] everything else the filth of the world
[1:42:19] comes right out of Hollywood the worst
[1:42:22] nation in the world more divorces the
[1:42:24] rest of the world put together you'll
[1:42:27] find out one of these days the Lord
[1:42:29] willing you'll see why this cursed thing
[1:42:33] you can see the blindness of the divorce
[1:42:35] and stuff that Satan has pulled over the
[1:42:37] eyes of the people and we're in a
[1:42:40] terrible
[1:42:41] hour our end is almost at hand now and I
[1:42:47] believe they're rotten rotten to the
[1:42:51] Core
[1:42:53] she appears in Revelations 13 number 13
[1:42:57] and remember it's raised up in the lamb
[1:42:59] freedom of religion but then it received
[1:43:03] power from the Beast an image to like it
[1:43:08] and he spoke with all the authority and
[1:43:10] done the same rotten things that the
[1:43:12] Beast did before him and then tell me
[1:43:16] it's not prophesied of this nation the
[1:43:19] Amorite condition is just about rip
[1:43:23] cause they're already working in
[1:43:26] it and if you just stop for a few
[1:43:29] moments I just I'm just going to ask you
[1:43:32] I'm just going to ask
[1:43:35] you how many gay
[1:43:38] people you might send this out to get me
[1:43:41] in trouble but that's just how it
[1:43:43] is how many
[1:43:47] Wicked Sodom people are in our present
[1:43:51] Administration
[1:43:53] right
[1:43:57] now and then then look how many people
[1:44:01] are in our Congress and in our
[1:44:04] Senate that are transgender and gay I'll
[1:44:08] tell you the number it's
[1:44:11] 128 and then figure out how many Roman
[1:44:14] Catholics sit on our Supreme
[1:44:19] Court listen we are ready to go home
[1:44:29] home brother Bill Delaney you know this
[1:44:32] for a fact you asked brother Homer one
[1:44:34] time or they ask him how many people do
[1:44:37] you think you'll leave will will leave
[1:44:39] this
[1:44:39] church and the number was
[1:44:43] four
[1:44:45] four yeah one time he said
[1:44:48] 15 well that works really well if you
[1:44:50] called your family
[1:44:56] brother brandham one time called it 500
[1:44:59] in the in the
[1:45:01] bride well that causes a lot of it
[1:45:03] causes a lot of what about me but
[1:45:07] brother brandom said you must believe if
[1:45:09] you're the only one
[1:45:12] going because this is an individual
[1:45:16] Rapture my personal hope is every one of
[1:45:20] us
[1:45:21] go amen
[1:45:23] amen every one of us I don't want none
[1:45:27] of
[1:45:29] you now I want you to listen to me I

[1:46:31] first immoral acts that happened on
[1:46:34] television I'm not going to call their
[1:46:36] names but was when a black man kissed a
[1:46:39] white
[1:46:41] woman there was

[1:47:04] television don't let your children watch
[1:47:07] this where are we
[1:47:12] at now let's go to churches
[1:47:16] now Pastor told me just recently I
[1:47:20] preached a horrible hard sermon this
[1:47:22] week
[1:47:24] and so I talked to him a few minutes I
[1:47:26] said what was so hard about it he said I
[1:47:28] preached on
[1:47:38] smoking
[1:47:42] smoking that was
[1:47:45] hard you quit that after you get saved
[1:47:51] [Applause]
[1:48:01] Hallelujah can you imagine if brother
[1:48:03] Brandon would come back and he went to
[1:48:06] some of these denominational preachers
[1:48:09] and walked in their pull
[1:48:13] pit listen I was invited to a
[1:48:17] Pentecostal convention by my uncles to
[1:48:20] come and preach there and I just was
[1:48:23] really
[1:48:24] polite they wouldn't want to hear what I
[1:48:27] got to
[1:48:28] say I don't want to hurt their feelings
[1:48:31] and their
[1:48:35] standings listen if I unload like Micah
[1:48:39] had to
[1:48:40] unload go ahead go ahead go ahead and do
[1:48:44] what you're going to do but I saw God
[1:48:47] use a demon from hell to come down and
[1:48:50] get into you 400 Prophets
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:56] I saw the demons get into your Deacon
[1:48:59] boards and your your preacher boards and
[1:49:01] where that you're going to let
[1:49:04] up and you're going to let women preach
[1:49:07] and homosexuality in your pull
[1:49:10] pits I saw that Demons of
[1:49:13] Hell how long you think I'm going to be
[1:49:17] there America don't want truth
[1:49:31] are you with me you still with
[1:49:34] me amen could you say all say
[1:49:38] amen and God permitted a pharaoh to
[1:49:41] raise up who knew not
[1:49:46] Joseph and Ramses was born
[1:49:55] we are far enough away from the prophet
[1:49:58] and his
[1:49:59] ministry for he
[1:50:01] preached in
[1:50:03] Washington he met with
[1:50:06] presidents that's no unknown fact
[1:50:10] brother random could have he could have
[1:50:13] sold out and become like Billy
[1:50:18] Graham but because of you
[1:50:25] now God has to allow time to go on
[1:50:28] because some of you going to be born
[1:50:30] after
[1:50:32] 1977 how many's born after
[1:50:37] 1977 wow bunch of
[1:50:46] pups can you raise your hands again just
[1:50:49] I'm not going to pick on you
[1:50:52] that's a pretty good percentage of this
[1:50:57] audience God could not come because you
[1:51:00] hadn't been born yet and you haven't
[1:51:02] come to the message of the hour brother
[1:51:05] Ron we wanted it to come we absolutely
[1:51:08] wanted it to come and I want it to come
[1:51:11] now I I really do I need a new
[1:51:14] body but it can't happen until he calls
[1:51:17] for it to happen no preacher in charge
[1:51:20] of it that's right and now we have
[1:51:23] leaders of our Nations and I want to
[1:51:26] make that plural not just America but
[1:51:29] all over the world we have leaders of
[1:51:31] our Nations that don't know our
[1:51:35] prophet and as a matter of fact don't
[1:51:37] know our
[1:51:41] God even on that National Day of Prayer
[1:51:44] 9 on
[1:51:47] 911 2001
[1:51:52] when Billy Graham was the leader of the
[1:51:56] National Day of Prayer he's the final
[1:51:59] speaker and they've had phenomenal
[1:52:03] amount of preachers and and women come
[1:52:07] from systems of a
[1:52:10] religion and they've all got up and
[1:52:12] listen he didn't get up and you know
[1:52:16] bring himself any different he said we
[1:52:18] all serve the same God Amen we

[1:52:28] God he's not my
[1:52:34] god sister re brother Jonathan's wife

[1:52:56] her family that's the way she was grew
[1:53:00] up but when she recognized this
[1:53:04] message there was a tremendous
[1:53:16] cost thank you for your

[1:53:37] Christ that's what I want to see in our
[1:53:39] children more than
