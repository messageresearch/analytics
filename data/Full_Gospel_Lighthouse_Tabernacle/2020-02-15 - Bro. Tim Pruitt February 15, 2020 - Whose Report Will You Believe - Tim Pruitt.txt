know my position as a son of yours and having been adopted by God and the adopted over the Holy Ghost we have around us a badge of authority as believers and we'd come into your name to act in your name to represent you tonight and we're just yielding ourselves to you now father we can do nothing of ourselves we know that and very humbly we come in that manner but then on the other hand boldly we come before the throne of grace to find help in our time of need because you instructed us to come that way not as not as some some foreigners or someone that's not of your household but to come boldly before the throne of grace to find help in our time of need and you saw the hands that was lifted tonight you know the needs of your children and their God the desire that is in their heart there are many that are streaming tonight and and even no doubt some from home that will be joining with us and serve us and different other places from perhaps around the world that will be viewing this service tonight and we just pray God you'll speak to them and their need to because you're a God that cares about your children and we just pray in the name of Jesus that is a word goes forth tonight that it'll break every fetter and it'll cause us to believe because that's what we are to do faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God and we just pray the catalyst so the Holy Spirit will be here then tonight the faith that we receive in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you if you'll turn with me to Isaiah chapter 53 we'll read from the first verse and you know I'm not making any excuses for how long I'm going to preach or how short I'm gonna preach I'm just gonna preach hey man we've got a job to do and we're just gonna do it just pray God will fill our mouths with the good things to say and then stop was when we said enough amen we'll just do part two another day amen but it's it's so good to be here with you and to be able to share the good news amen I believe we got good news tonight God still reigns he's still on the throne no matter what your problem is or your situation God still God it hadn't changed who he is a man your trouble your problems what we're going through tonight hasn't changed who God is he's still God and he's here to meet your need tonight a man to speak to your heart to minister to you amen so Isaiah chapter 53 verse 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he have no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone everyone to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he had made his he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when he went I'll shut make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he said have I'd the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors and then let's go to Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 we're coming to our church age that we are presently living in we're part of right now that a messenger has come to - to fulfill this part but this is our word this is the word the Lord - our age - our time and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God amen god bless you can be seated I'm gonna be speaking tonight on who hath believed our report and we've got a lot of reports here lately and we have been with you every step of the way and as many has around the world and different places has and I personally have received many calls from different places questions things emails texts and so on from overseas and different ones as well inquiring about the needs that are here and our brother Ron and his family in the church here and and so we've received a lot of different reports that's for sure but this is a thing that he says in Scripture who have believed our report the doctors have a report and men say what they think and thinkin and what they know the best of their understanding but I'm here to talk about his report tonight now and I'm here to report of what the faithful and the true witness has to say the Amen of God and man they the faithful and true witness when we think of that you know God would come service after service after service to vindicate the word that had been preached as you know and discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart tell where people were from them with situation and what do what needs that they had their names address because God is just that kind of God he's a personal God and he cares about you and he cares about your needs so he would show himself over and over and over that he is a personal God and that he knows he knows everything before we even understand what the situation is he already knows what the situation is brother branham would say of this sum this particular scripture in the church age book he said these things say it the faithful and the true witness now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it says though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and in stood back and became a great impersonal God and as though that God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that that way being the cross and then when the death of Christ is atone for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God's has folded his hands and stood back and it says if we have majored and believing in the Great Creator who being created have to create having created lost personal interest in his creation and they said now I want to say that's how many people are up to think but it's wrong thinking for God is governing in the affairs of men right now is both creator and sustainer and Colossians 1:16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven and are in earth visible and invisible whether it be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers and all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things exists he's a sovereign God and by his own counsel he purposed the plan of salvation of his own elect which he foreknew and the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully execute the will of the Father and he's working all things listen now at this moment according to the purpose of his own will and he's right in the midst of all of it and he and he is in the midst of his church and this great creator Savior God is faithfully working among his own right now as the great Shepherd of the Sheep his very existence is for his own you're the reason he exists you're the reason he does everything that he's ever done is on account of you he's that kind of a God he's a personal God he's taking personal interest in your need and your situation your problem and what you're going through his eyes ever upon them he loves and cares for them what the words when the word says your lives are hid with Christ and God it means exactly what it says oh I'm so glad that my god abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to the word he will back it up he is true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up at the last days I'm glad that I'm resting upon his faithfulness Philippians 1 in 6 being confident of this very thing that he will began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ so he has started to work he's gonna finish it he's not gonna abandon what he started and man he's right here to do his work in this end time in this day in hours according to his unfailing word that in that he begun a good work in his church in the first stage he will continue that work all the way to the day of Christ when he comes back for his church so then we we sometimes ponder you know has he lost interest and I just say how could he can he forget us the Bible said in Isaiah 14 I'm 15 can a woman first forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb hey they may forget yep I will not forget thee behold I have grieving the upon the palms of our hands forget us why he left all the glory for us amen jesus came is the life Giver hey man and through through Adam of course came sorrow and pain and sickness and death but Jesus came to give life and life more abundantly amens he cannot forget what he's doing he cannot bring us this far and send us Malachi far in the lives of the prophet and prophesy all them times and say it over and over again even in tongues and interpretation has john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with the message support run the Second Coming he can't say that and then forget it all he cannot say I'll turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and then abandoned the project he can't do it he can't do it it's it's impossible for God to lie nobody you know this life that we have is a quickening life a man just like the natural life that you must be born into this life John three and five jesus said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh but that which is born of spirit is spirit so Jesus came to birth us into a new life a man and those that would be bold of him would be born of a new race a man there would be a new species unlike anything else a man that has ever been seen since the first creation they there would be a spirit men and women that's what I'm preaching here to a man I'm preaching the spirit born men and women born of the Holy Ghost empowered by the Holy Ghost sons of God daughters of God men and women who have been called to a purpose and a place in this day an hour the madam would tell us in spoken word his original seed he's said to be born of the word in the spirit it brings us back to the spoken word hallelujah did you ever think about it we think sometimes Hattie Wright had something special that happened for her and her children and indeed it was very special but every one of you they're born of the Holy Ghost is born just like that of the spoken word a man the word birds who the Bible said being born again not of corruptible seed but of the Word of God that liveth and abideth forever you're born of the word a word birth birth in word sons so he says to be born of the water in the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again into the place where you should have been at the beginning see and that's the reason of Christ's death it brings us right back again to where sons of God so here in our second birth were born the way we should have been originally a man now as we look upon this greater life giver he first had to deal with the death that was upon mankind and and to do this God would actually become human he would become one of us you know Hebrews 2:14 says for as much as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he himself likewise took part of the same then through that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil is that right amen so he here again he would come and take on flesh and blood hey man he would come as a man to suffer as a man to go through what we go through so he could become the proper mediator that you can be sure he was not your son distant out-of-touch God that was a spirit that never understood humanity but this God wanted you to know hey man he wanted you to know he cared enough for you he would leave all of glory to become one of you to become a human just like you are to go through what you go through to suffer problems just like you suffer amen so when you go to him that you're not going to a distant god that's out of touch that has never known what you go through but this God wanted you to know that he feels her pain he feels her sorrow a man that he's experienced it all himself are you with me now hey man Romans 8 in 20 when he tells us you know it makes it clear that man was not originally to nothing would die before Adam for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by the reason of him who subjected the same is hope so again let me just translate this for against its will the universe itself has had to endure the empty futility and chaos resulting from the consequences of human sin so you see human sin that subjected all of the universe and all of mankind into a suffering condition hey man and since you were made subject to death he came down from heaven to be one of us in order to elevate us back to sonship again hallelujah Amen hebrews chapter 2 verse 15 and to deliver them who was in the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage hallelujah he comes to deliver those who are in the fear of death amen for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him this seed of Abraham wherein all things have believed him to be made like unto his brethren Amen that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself had suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted let me just say let me just say that again paraphrase it this way for him that he suffered himself has said he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to aid those in art in t hey man and brother branham would tell us in the preaching of the Hebrews he said he said God could not suffer in the spirit so he had to become flesh to feel the pain I'm talking about our report tonight I'm talking about believing I report I'm drunk I believe in what Jesus did I'm talking about him becoming a human to pay the price of redemption and become the Lamb of God and become your sacrifice and bear your sickness and bear your sins but God didn't suffer in the spirit he had to become flesh to feel the pain of sickness to feel the temptation of lust to feel the temptation of want to feel the temptation of hunger to feel the power of death that he might take it upon his self to stand in the presence of the Great Spirit Jehovah to make intercession to this life and Jesus took that in order to make intercession for us and he knows how it feels and when you get sick he knows how how you feel when you are tempted he knows how you feel hey man he's been through it a man he he knows exactly what you have been through and what you're going through a man he knows the temptation he knows he knows to battle when Satan comes and whispers in your ear come on that comes along and says God has forgotten that's a word it's not going to happen for others but it's not for you that you're left alone and abandoned in the situation I want you to know God God knows he came to experience it for himself brother Branham would say and how could I overcome temptation was for him you know that the Bible said he was tempted in all points like we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him a man now his redeeming work would be typed out in the Old Testament no Testament he would be shown he would show they can give the example of the high priest as Jesus would become the high priest and his redeeming work would also be typed out in the sacrifices because he would not only be the high priest but he would be the sacrifice a man so every Bullock would represent him the turtle does every lamb ever goat and you know all of that words was sacrifice would represent him in his sacrifice a man now in the Old Testament Aaron the high priest was instructed to take two go kids for a sin offering and he would cast lots and choose one to be offered as a sin offering in this and then then the other would be the scapegoat which Gordon at dictionary is a person who is blamed for someone else's wrongdoing and this is what happened in the Old Testament type to make her become a scapegoat Jesus would be blamed for your sins he would be punished for your sins and because of your sins also for your sickness because it's a dual atonement come on when sin came in sickness came in and so Jesus would actually actually become the one blamed take on if the sinless one who had done no sin would become blamed and the blame put on him and him go to death in your place now I'm preaching about I report a map now this happened in the Old Testament type would you like to read it with me in Leviticus 16 verse 21 and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions and all their sins and putting them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities until a land not inhabited and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness I want you to watch this here because God was actually showing us something as as two goats was taken and Lots was cast one would become of sin offering and be slaughtered and the other they would put the sins and the people upon him and take him out in the wilderness now brother branham would tell us that both of the goats represented Christ theologians sometimes will tell you that one I'm not representing Christ and the scapegoat represented the devil but if so then then the devil is representing us in Redemption and Satan don't have a part in Redemption are you with me a man and some but this is what happened to Jesus he was the one that God laid upon the iniquity of us all hey man Isaiah 53 and 3 he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed hallelujah and Jesus remember John whether identify man said behold the lamb of God because now the lamb of God had taken on human flesh the sacrifice had become a human God had become a man hallelujah and Jesus would be wounded and torn and beat and punished and bruised and slapped a man I want you just a moment to picture this little goat kid he's innocent he's never done any wrong he's never done any sin he's just a little animal and and here he's taken and the lot is cast upon him and he's escaped though and they lay all of the sins of the people on this go to and they lead him out into the wilderness by a fifth man so he's gonna go way out into the wilderness very strong athletic fit man who's gonna take him out lead him out into the wilderness the man would have to hide his face from the little goat so he would be left alone and abandoned are you with me now because this would would be the very thing that would happen to Jesus your sacrifice where he would crowd my God my God why hast thou forsaken me now you remember you know a goat is a domesticated animal I used to raise him I had champion goats I raised some very many years I I know all about their care I know I know how they how they are I know their nature I know the way that they do they're not they're not a wicked animal there were a clean animal that representative sacrifice and there that will follow you as a as a as a man that will follow you out into pastures and they're very afraid to be left alone I've taken mine and walks out in the woods because of bread they're there they were browser's not grazers and so taking them out into the woods were there like a deer that liked to forage and eat well I reach up high for their food and so you know I I would walk out there with them and and and they were always looking to see where I was and I couldn't leave them out there because if I if I tried to leave them right back to the barn they'd go just as fast as I could go and and so you know I you know I I I know I know how they were but this number you I know the terror that they would feel when they would be left alone and you know I just want them you'd imagine the terror of this little goat scared fearful running to the thorns cut pierced then pounced upon and Entering torn and ripped apart as he's making an atonement for the sins he didn't even do the sins of man not his own sins I mean this was Jesus and men wounded torn beat punished whipped bruised slapped crowned with thorns and he took this in his flesh for your healing for your healer hallelujah think about it he would be forsaken so you would be forsaken he would be abandoned and sit the hell in your place into the wilderness in your place I'm talking about our Redeemer now a man brother Branham would say of it said even that just simile he said he'd add more death at Gethsemane you know then then that he did even on the cross he said when the eternal destination I've ever sold that ever was ever would be on earth rested on his decision hey ma'am the book of Hebrews he says during the days Christ days on earth he pleaded with God praying with a passion and with tearful agony that God would spare him from death hey man oh yes but in that great crucial out until he suffered knowing all things until such suffering - his water and blood separated in his body and great drops of sweat like blood dropped from his brow you know and there he he would die more death at Gethsemane then he would on the cross and what was he doing he was becoming the scapegoat descend this one happen to say I think the object I'm never committed adultery I've never done anything wrong I'm not you know I'm the sinless perfect one that has never never yielded in temptation but I've got to take all of the sins of the whole world upon myself ever adultery every filthy thing ever every evil spirit everything that you can imagine he will have to take the whole gamut of sin upon himself [Applause] ma'am what was he doing becoming the scapegoat where my sins and your sins were laid upon him the sinless one what father what was his body being big for why why were strikes being laid on him think about this strikes being laid on him he had never sinned he had never done anything wrong but he was doing this for you where God would lay on him the iniquity of us all where your sins would be transferred to him so his righteousness could be transferred back to you hallelujah hey man why was this why would stripes be laid on him Matthew 8:16 tells us when evening was come that brought him unto Him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and he healed all that were sick hallelujah and man that it might be fulfilled that which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying he himself took our infirmities and bare our sickness so you see here again this is what he would do he he healed he delivered to fulfill the scripture and he's still fulfilling that tonight and then because he hadn't gone and abandoned his project he knows your knees he knows how sick you are he knows how sinful you are he knows your condition and God cares about it I want you to know tonight you've got God's intention his eyes are upon you tonight he cares about your situation and how you're feeling this Cape coat torn by the Beast can you imagine here somehow this fit man he takes this little goat out he has to pull him away from all of his herd mates pull him out get him out get him out way out in the wilderness so far he didn't know his way back he gets way out in the wilderness then the man you know will watch him for a few minutes and a little goat now I was picking this little bramble here and this little thing there and eating feeling this little belly and you know looking around at all this unfamiliar stuff and territory and all of a sudden the man slips behind the tree he then he finds a wagon slips out gets away from the little goat and a little goat now is by yourself alone behind every bush he's a he's an enemy something to tear him apart and he's screaming he's screaming very Shepard and he's yelling he's waiting where are you where are you you've left me I'm here alone I'm by myself and I'm defenseless against all of this my the enemy sentries here and before you know it you know it's calling every kind of thing every kind of predator is coming there from free you know ii think that's hearing these blades and here they're coming and and now it's been attacked and he's been pulled this way this has his high being torn and has through being ripped and his belly being opening and he dies an awful awful death torn by beasts and i want you to get a picture of your lamb you say lamb you said it was a goat listen he said take a lamb from the sheep or the goats that's right this little this little goat kid also called a lamb in the book of Exodus he would be torn apart and I want you to think about your lamb ever cancer diabetes TB asthma heart disease high blood pressure ever affliction crippled affliction blind deaf dumb lines disease ever beast of every kind writing at him tear in his flesh would ever whip out the cord would ever crown another torn are you with me Amen whatever slap that he didn't deserve but he was paying for your healing [Applause] he was paying for your salvation somebody women tonight the Bible said in first Peter 2:24 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we are healed [Applause] Colossians 1:21 says in you you you you you you who were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now have he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh provable in his sight so his body was an offering for our sickness but his soul now would go to hell in our place because his soul listen I live it intent it proves pleased the Lord to bruise him yet he put him he had put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin so his body now listen it's a dual atonement a man when sin came in sickness came with it is that right Amen so the atonement has to deal with both sin and sickness so he would actually bear your sickness in his body oh I feel the Holy Ghost right now he would bear your affliction are you with me now and his body was an offering for our sickness but his soul with the hell in our place hey man he's here verse 11 said he shall see the travail of his soul so when just the travail of his body but it would be also the travail of his soul a man a man and now so he said that he would bear their iniquities so there in heaven now what you do is get a picture because Jesus did not his body was in the tomb but he's very much alive and he went to hell in your place for your sins your sins he would carry them into the wilderness where no man dwells [Applause] hallelujah and he would carry them into hell your sins my sins he didn't deserve to go to hell but God would go to hell in your place by becoming flesh in Jesus Christ are you with me and in hell he would be punished haunted torn he would bear the brunt of scorns of demons he would he would have to endure the bragging of death that says I got you you're in my clutches and he would go with the torment of every demon tormentor known to man we got you I knew a chair in his soul I'm an can you can you imagine no you can't imagine it of me you know this is worsening the most nightmare at Halloween you can't even fathom what it was to face every kind of demon power ever spirit of the Last Temptation every kind of devil you honking at him and palm tearing at him and ripping at him are you with me a man he had to bear the brunt the scorn the torment of ever demon tormentor known to man that would carry the soul the Bible said in 2nd 2nd Corinthians 5:21 for he had made him to be sin for us he would go to hell a Senate yet he never sinned but he was carrying your sins just like the scapegoat never sinned it had no sin but now it's bearing the sins of the nation and here he is bearing the sins of the world brother Branham will describe hell and the haunting spirits that are there and the awful feelings and he would go through all of it touken laugh now remember I want you to get this tonight his body would suffer for your body his soul would suffer for your soul it's a dual atonement hey man you can't preach the atonement without preaching to find healing if God saves he healed if he's still saving he's still healing you say I'm saved tonight he's still the same healer his blood still atone but on that third day are you with me I mean I I don't know I know that that that he he had spent that time in Hell being haunted pulled out tormented everything else you his soul for your soul are you with me but on that third day once his soul had been offered it did sense to the lower regions of hell hallelujah and there is he comes into the lowest regions of Hell when Satan looks at him and said AHA I got you and here you are yeah I thought I had you with it with Abel because I knew there would be a seed and I thought I had you with Moses who were like when I fitted him to sin and I thought I had to here but here you come I catch you now Alleluia but dari in that moment of time there was a transformation that started happening hallelujah else Terry is another scripture that begins to kick in because it's all would be offered very far for sin but that was in all the scripture a man because the scripture begins to change from being the sacrifice to the conquer hallelujah and the scriptures of the mighty conquer began to take hold of him because the scripture had also said ah that will not leave my soul in hell and neither will I allow my Holy One to see corruption [Applause] hallelujah sums 14 and 15 but God will redeem my soul from the power of the green for he shall receive me Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God and there in that moment friends he changes from from from being the one beaten and torn and wounded to be in the conquer sin is been painful he doesn't have to pay for eternity he doesn't once and for all and he gets saved of Satan I came here as a sinner but I'm not a sinner anymore I am a conquer and I'm taking your keys of death and appel away from you [Applause] [Music] what's my victory God a man in the string of death is sin and the lonely gate strength of sin but Jesus is act betrayed over sand over sickness over the grave over disease over death itself and Jesus took our sins that for taking the sting out of death hallelujah if you just realize it here tonight death can only the only power that death has is to take you in the presence of God he can't take you to hell he can't take you to punishment somebody help me preach hey man the Bible would tell you that he took the keys from Satan revelation 1:18 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and I have the keys of hell and of death see brother band told us and possessing the enemy's cake he said what's what he did when he

conquered enemy [Applause] hallelujah Florida God disappeared in with a conquered enemy that's what you're doing tonight he's a conquered enemy hey man hey man I remember the story of Christian and pilgrims progress you remember he got down into he when he started on his journey he was given a key a promise he stuck it here in his vest near his heart and as he's going to the celestial city he decides to take a shortcut and on this shortcut he gets down into the slaw the slaw of despond or despair and there he gets in that in that wandering around he gets caught by the giant of despair ain't no one of us that don't know that giant amen every one of us we felt despair many times just be honest on our Christian journey yeah we get down and part of the journey and you know when we get into this path and we get captured sometimes by the giant of despair and he takes him and locks him into a prison and he won't feed him and he's starving and he's dying and he's getting weaker every day you know ideas and every day the giant of despair comes and beats him up slaps him around makes fun of him shoves and slams again back locks it back you've been there you know exactly what I'm talking about and there you know he would try every day how do I get out of this how do I get out of this despair how'd that get out of this prison oh you know all you did this you did that you took the wrong path sometimes we get into despair and we didn't even take the wrong path you know every time do we hear something somebody something happens to somebody well what kind of sin did you do we got jobs comforters that want to come around and say well you know I'll tell you that Ron Spencer must be a real sinner with all the stuff he goes through no he's not a sinner you're just jokes

report and report is you're saved you're healed you're delivered and Satan is defeated [Applause] hallelujah I can go into this battle hallelujah and declare divorce with swing the first stone the dance coming down hallelujah so every day he's beaten every day he's beaten every day and he's about to die one day he's trying you shaking the gate maybe he left it open this time maybe maybe oh oh you know trying to get out he can't get out he lays back down and collapses on the ground and as his hand hits self across the chest he feels something against the fetal what is that in my pocket it's a promise [Applause] and one promise is good as another hallelujah one promise works as well as the promises of God are true somebody up mitrice now David went down there to get a stone but there was thousands of stones not just five stones a man he didn't have to look for a bunch of stalled there was a bunch of them didn't have to scrounge around for five of them there are plenty of stone we got plenty of stones and it only takes every promise of God as good as its promise of God is just as true just take what I am the Lord God that healeth thee of Allah that diseases my stratts you were healed I may just take one of those promises he reaches down in his pocket and pulls it up okey okay oh my could it work will it work will it work well it won't work unless you try take it put it in and turn it to the hand the faith takes it listen there are thousands of stones laying right here in this Bible but every one of them are dormant until you put them in a sling and let it go in Jesus me [Music] laughter you know God unless he put it in the sling come on hallelujah brother Brennan said but stone there is a faith in the promise are you with me Amen but the sling is the name of Jesus Christ and you take that stone and put it in the name of Jesus and ever apples gonna come down hit the target you kill the Giant in your life he'll overcome for you and he took that key and put it in and it sent and I want you to know this key will fit to unlock any promise of God for you I'm trying to tell you you don't have to keep Elena there in the in the tail house you don't have to keep allay them there is somebody with me now I'll take the key a promise and put it in the lock and there folk people can hold you bound anymore he conquered every sickness he conquered temptation he conquered every enemy and I want you to know your enemy is conquer but you know a lot of times we go through things and next thing you know we find we are right in another Jam I don't understand this brother Jim why we have so many trials well you know Paul got bow after bow you know a tormentor King amen give me another microphone I'm tired of this one amen but anyway you know yeah I pull it let's see who preaches with this microphone well David said and the ecclesiastical Bester won't fit a man of God's own will just get rid of it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and my but we get in one thing in here comes another bow and we you know you really gotta be how the will of God know you're at in the last God we don't walk outside of the will of God we walk him the will of God and it's God's will for us to face things in this life and overcome them not them overcome us with us overcome them somebody with me so you know you know Christian he gets up he gets up there and he hears a ferocious roar I didn't even sound like a good lion my grandchildren would have loved it though you know he sees a lion in the path and now he's afraid how will I ever get to my gold how will I ever reach the celestial City and of course you know there was some of his friends left him at that time and you know they ran patients were and given others run and you know they're they're overcome by fear but he says I've got to reach the goal somehow another I don't know even if a lion eats me I'm gonna if I have that I'm gonna die trying and so he sees the lineup up ahead and here's the roar and he ceased he's going along taking one step at a time looking at this line watching him wondering when he's gonna come running toward him he noticed the line stays in the same place is roaring he gets up closer and closer his heart's pounding and he looks over there as he gets up close and the line is chained and not only that but he's been declawed and defamed I'm trying to tell you your enemy has been chained by the Word of God so now hallelujah ULP has been chained Yuri anime has been defeated he's been declawed and be fined couple now and you can pass by him on your way to the promised why brother Bevan preach sister you fear cancer what was he trying today ain't nothing to fear it's been declawed and defamed and beside that there wasn't a meeting that he ever went to that cancer didn't get scared and start screaming it ain't something we're supposed to be afraid of it's supposed to be afraid of us we're not the defeated one he is a [Music] man now let me just make it clear Satan does not have the power of death the Bible said in Hebrews 12 to 14 for he has said for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil hey man if you're not I'm the first from the last I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore and I have the keys of hell and of death hey ma'am they were taken from him you know wasn't Satan tried to blow you trying to kill brother branham but with the gun blowing up in his face this is what he said it was him sitting on that bench the other day when Satan's seen a chance to kill me but he couldn't do it he couldn't do it and death ain't gonna ride you to heaven you're gonna ride dad to heaven cause death is only an obedient slave to bring you out of this dimension into another dimension brother Brandon would write and pick up your pen and write he says nothing can harm us not even death so Simon he says I'm an air of divine healing I'm an air of joy I've got a right to be happy so what makes you so happy I've got a right to be how do you know because I'm an heir to it hey man I not feel religious I'm an heir to happiness I'm an heir to joy I'm an heir to peace I'm an heir to eternal life I'm an heir to the Holy Spirit I'm an heir to everybody Scot amen I'm gonna add to the authority of God who made you that not me he did I'm an every one of you is an heir to the same thing a man an heir to the throne he that overcometh shall sit with me on my throne as I've overcome and have sat down with my Father's throne and heir of all things not just one thing all things everything's under your feet even death is under your feet grave is under your feet hell is under your feet sin is under your feet everything is under your feet and you're an heir i'll Allu you you're dead and your life is hidden God through Jesus Christ and you've rose again to eternal life sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus whoo he said call us anything you want to call us what you want to say we're crazy if you want to but we're heirs and sought all things a man both seen present future to everything I'm an heir to it hallelujah and when he rose he arose for our justification Romans 4:25 said who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification do you believe that he was raised in order to share his righteous life with us and in doing so he rose from the dead I want you to believe that don't you he rose from the dead and in and that and that stripes and beatings and crucifixion had resulted in death just as your sickness the devil hence to you is meant for your death are you with me remember by his resurrection he not only defeated sin but he defeated sickness he defeated cancer he defeated heart trouble he defeated ever known or unknown malady demand hallelujah it's all been defeated because in his body when he raised it up it was victorious over death and everything beneath it Ephesians 1:20 he raised him from the dead and sat him at his own right hand in heavenly places amen far above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come a man raised him from the dead set him in heavenly places far above all principality every spiritual wickedness ever daemon of hell ever devil somebody helped me every name every name that is named hallelujah hey man we we have went along for the last little bit wondering what the name of this devil is well it doesn't change his power I mean knowing his name doesn't change his power he still defeated a man that at the name of Jesus every knee has to bow come on Philippians 2:9 wherefore God highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in earth and things under the earth and every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord and it declares right here in the Word of God his name is higher than cancer his name is higher than sickness his name is higher than in his sin his name is higher than any disease and that at the name of Jesus every knee cancer how about sickness how about San how about every time I don't care how long it's been in your family tree and how much has been handed down it has to bow to the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] viens of all three worlds has to bow to the name of Jesus that name holds dominion over Satan and his entire kingdom hallelujah my God's showed himself greater than Lucifer a man is greater than his imps those unclean spirits those tormentors he defeated cancer right then he defeated ever sickness ever disease he rose up well healed delivered hallelujah the only thing he left with some signs in his hands and his side a man to say that I was he that was dead and I'll never forget you because your names are engraved in the palms hallelujah he didn't raise an almost dead man he didn't raise a crippled man he didn't raise a sick man he didn't raise with wounds and bleeding and bloody and gory he raised like that he raised perfect and healed and delivered and triumph over every disease over every sickness hallelujah he triumphed over it all then at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue should confess the lordship of Christ [Applause] [Music] and blessed be the name of the Lord he gave you and me the right to use his name because we're born in the same family a son of God ever says devil you go cancer you go sickness you go it has to obey you because you've been given the authority to use that name and on the day of Pentecost he sent back his spirit to dwell in us so we could share in his life that because he lives we shall live we shall live also a man come on a man because that he raised up sinless even you by being dead to sin and matter then pair it with human baptism you too can rise in the newness of life Alleluia a man with abundant life and you that are sick can be healed and immediately after having parted his life immediately after the Holy Ghost came immediately they begin to impart healing to the man at the gate called beautiful and Satan and sickness were cast out is that right this is a commission Matthew 10 and verse 8 heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils as freely as you received freely give it hallelujah amen you you receive healing freely come on weird to offer healing and may we receive salvation freely didn't we we are to offer salvation you see divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection somebody with me now hey man that's what divine healing is is the earnest of the resurrection just just as the Holy Ghost is a downpayment on the endless life you see the the same is true that you know we do not have yet immortal bodies we still are here in Portland mortal bodies our soul has been redeemed and we got a deposit called the Holy Ghost is that right it's called the earnest or the downpayment as brother Branham would say off and you know if we have this kind of joy here just happen to deposit what are we gonna have will we get the fullness come on and right now we've got a deposit come on the earnest of our resurrection and is called divine healing and it's a down payment that there are going to be people on earth a man who will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and be healed from the top of their head to the sole of their feet it is a down payment on your new body hallelujah [Music] hey man he would tell us over and over if there's no divine healing there's no resurrection of the dead brother branham would tell us over and again he says now he says if I can't get you to believe for divine healing of the body how am I gonna get you to believe and receive faith for a rapture don't miss her interpret that just because maybe you don't get the faith for a certain malady in your life or whatever that that your your soul isn't saved it has nothing to do with your soul but he's just simply saying that if the church can't even believe for divine healing then how are we gonna believe for the change of our body hey man person gives a heart trouble and God heals that part gives him a new heart he's 60 years old he don't get a 14 year old heart he gets a 60 year old heart just healed and well are you with me I mean this is what God does and this is what he offers he offers healing for the body salvation for the Soul is that right amen but if we can't but you know if we can't even believe that God is a healer of the body how are we gonna believe that people that you can't even find a spoon full of ashes but seven ages are going to be so so healed delivered set free until they're standing back on their feet again resurrected come on if we can't believe that God can heal just a little part of our body how can we believe that the dead in Christ are gonna rise and God has asked this age to believe something very very important you are to believe for the change of the body and the meeting in the air [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah the Holy Spirit you have is the earnest of our eternal life amen divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection that's the reason that God included divine healing how could you take it out of the gospel when he was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes we were healed listen and let me quote to brother Branham the same blood from the same man on the same day one for healing wasn't one for salvation one for healing to deny one is to deny the other you see it was a dual atonement he said they turned it around today in the days of Jesus here on the earth in a physical body they said we know he can heal but he makes herself God by forgiving sins mm but today they say he's alright he can forgive sins but he can heal but he says praise be to God he can do both and he says I'm a witness and yura witness both salvation for the soul and salvation for the body do you know what lays in the very center of God's will you know the Bible is God's will is called a testament his will and testament right is his covenant do you know laying right in the very center of God's Word in the very center of God's Word is sums 103 that's a very center of the King James Bible sums 103 says who forgiveth all our iniquities and he lives all that diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction layin right in the center of God's will the center of his will and testament right in the middle bridge in the way for the old and the new covenant come on now I'm the healer I forgive all in the grease and I heal our diseases and I redeemed by life with her sickness or whether sin from destruction God put her right in the center of your Bible to tell you that's the center of his will this is what he did for your behalf to heal your sickness and save you from your sins amen the Bible said in Matthew 8 and verse 17 himself took our infirmities that's weaknesses and he bare our sicknesses that's diseases as believers we do not have to tolerate sin in our lives because Jesus bore our sins and neither do we need to tolerate sickness in our bodies because Jesus bore our sickness hallelujah Isaiah 53 and for surely he had borne that means carried away he carried away our griefs that word really is interpreted the true translation of it from the Hebrew he he had carried away our sicknesses and diseases and carried our sorrows which is pains he carried your pains he bore our griefs sicknesses and diseases first Peter 2:24 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree now if he bore them you don't need to bear them I'm I'm giving a declaration tonight man that if he bore them you don't have to bear your sins not another day not another minute because he bore your sins are you with me a man now if we have to bear them Jesus didn't need the barrel and then it would be useless for Jesus to barrel and Jesus became sick with our diseases as God he couldn't do that but God became a man and took on the veil of flesh he knew no sickness until he become a man he knew no sin until he become a man and the object of Christ sin Baron was to make righteous all that believe in him to be their sin bearer and the object of his disease Baron is to is to make well all those who would believe in him as their disease Bearer and this healing is so abundant Jesus said the miracles that I do say you do also amen not only that but you as a redeemed at son and a righteous son can speak his word and ask anything in his name Satan cannot stand before that name now and any more than he can stand before the man who gave you the right to use it hey man hey man brother branham tells us in the pergamene church age this word he has left behind on printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit filled life he said his word was life a man and he says I am the way the truth and the life he said if any man not have not the Spirit of Christ he's none of his there it is he is spirit he is life that's exactly what the word is and that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places an upon his lips well that is the same as TV speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man I'm talking to a church tonight that Satan cannot stand before I'm talking to a people tonight Satan cannot stand before then a word has been given to you are you with me now hallelujah you may feel like a little weakling like David flat before Goliath were the puny little sling and little stones against a mighty giant but his faith went into action hallelujah and here's for his little puny arm became a whirlwind the power and God took ahold of that arm and that puny stone became a lethal weapon Alleluia a man when David looked what he saw was his God was bigger than any giant come on we may be thinking we're facing a giant that our God is bigger than any giant a man I have been preaching since in New Year's on Joshua 1:8 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy life thy mouth you've got to keep saying the word confessing what God said Amen but thou shalt meditated a day and night that that miss observed to do all that is written therein but then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest Alleluia I'm announcing tonight the death a disease is as powerless as it was then when the Son of man walked the earth demons fear the word today in the lips of a man who walks with God as when they bound to it in the in Jesus day all hell knows the power of Jesus name they know our legal rights in our authority so they're fighting to keep us in the ignorance of our legal rights or if we know them to keep us under condemnation so we won't use them amen but Matthew 18:18 said verily verily I say to you what thing soever you said bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what thing soever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and again I've seen here of any two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father who is in heaven for were too three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them hallelujah hallelujah I want to say what power we have Amen let's use our power we arrived to our mighty heaven given privileges oh man somebody's got to do it there's not another age somebody's got to believe the message somebody's hearts got to be turned somebody's going to stand for truth somebody's gonna believe it it might as well be you it might as well be me somebody's gonna do it the one's gonna be fulfilled it matters what be me it might as well be what does this mean it means everything it says thank God you can set disease men free the work said I do shall you do our song we get set demon bound men free you can break the chains that bind man in that mighty name guess what happens anytime so anybody gets saved the devil gets defeated that was the king and the lord in their life and he got dethroned and a new king come and sat on the throne the ulcer is only the battleground come on hey man that's exactly what the church is is a battleground you see the Spirit of God has challenged you to learn tonight to rise and live this truth you know takes a book eat the book and then speak the book God's hands are tied until he can use ours angels are servants they can't do our work man God's limited to our faith and our obedience to his word the only thing that will limit God is your faith otherwise he's unlimited come on God is big only word some man makes him big amen by using this divinely given authority we we are the body of Christ that head is powerless without the hands and the feet hey man let's be men of God let's be a mighty army army you know did it listen the Bible said he's the Lord of Hosts look at revelation 19 and see if it's just angels it ain't angels riding behind him and white horses it's the sons of God and it means the Lord of hosts and he's the Lord of armies he's got an army right here in this church tonight hallelujah he's got generals right here in this church tonight he's got men of God he's got men of faith he's got people he's gonna use in this generation cuz he's a lord of armies brother Branham said in perfect faith I'll just see how advanced my churches on what we believe in just see how advanced the people are and how they're ready to take the sword and walk out in the front line and say I challenge you Satan see our Challenger you can't make me you can't make me disbelieve anymore what are these things done for us so that people will believe it's the word it shows that what I'm preaching to you is the truth the word and the Word made flesh made flesh and you made word made life in you made life in me so God gives you a sword now well brother Tim we're third Pope believers brother we believe in the opening of the word oh you know I do too but when it comes to a prophet of God it came as a sword a sword in the hand not a sword in the scabbard and brother Brandon said it you know I must be faithful to this third pull it's the message hey man it's the word that has been put in your hands it's not for decoration is somebody with me it's nothing it's not to make yourself important not for decoration to sit on your side and I'm in the Lord's army hearing the Lord's army get your sword out we got a devil to defeat hallelujah and as we defeat this Goliath there's a mini mower that we got to get out there and defeat a man everyone if you've got your own Galasso go out there and defeat he put a sword in your hand but a sword ain't any good as long as it's not welded by hand there's got to be held in the hand and the hand that this one is held in if you look at revelation 19 that his sword is in his what mouth he holds his sword where he sent His Word and healed them by his word he cast out Devils the sword of the Lord the Word of God in your mouth will defeat the devil anywhere any place any time but it's got to be put in your mouth and must become your confession [Applause] because the moment he gets you to disbelieve your weapon you are defeated but if you believe in your weapon you will hold it and speak it with faith and with faith comes through the word it ignites the word it makes it work and it can't stop Devils it heals a sick it saves the last but it's dormant as long as it's in a scabbard it won't cut butter but once it taken in your puts on your lips it's the same as deity speaking takes a strong hand of faith to cut through everything that devil can put there and make every promise of God you know shine forth amen a strong hand of faith brother Branham had a lot to say about that you know Joshua knew his position I'm Wanda now it's okay you'll be all right you're not gonna pass out but generally he looked at the Sun and the moon commanded him to stand still that took courage whoever thought that with word now you can say how you want to how this does this understood still the earth quit removing whatever I don't really care the mechanics I just know the dynamics it doesn't matter you know you know what the physics was or whether the sudden stopped or whether the earth stopped well the Sun don't move their throws rotate you know all of the all the weird ideas that we come up with you know why this word don't work all I know is the light held till every enemy was defeated I can't explain it I just know what happened and there's a lot of this hakim explained but I just know it works [Applause] proverbs 4 20 says my son attend to my words and climb their ears from my sayings let them not depart from thine eyes and keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find him and help to all their flesh that word has never failed in the mouth so believe in Christians you see the word is alive and the word has to act so therefore you see he stood there on the promise of God he could look back over and he could see Moses said let there be darkness and it was darkness all over Egypt but let there be light in Goshen and he and he said as I was with Moses so will I be with you I need some more light Sun stands still are you with me hey man it's exactly right I mean you know they're there again the promise is there and brother Brown tells you you've got the power in you to do that now he said their God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots as powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent he said you got enough power in you right now to make a new world that's the power of the word that that is in you hey man we just need to target against the enemy it's more than just a system of religious beliefs where you understand doctrine ioan it becomes your new Creed not just a faith a firm belief so that you can embrace a new philosophy but if you know but a living faith this message was sent to vindicate the Bible not replace the Bible but to prove it right the seals were open to remove the mysteries off of his truth to reveal Christ to us to show his nature and his attitude what I don't understand is how come today so many people are claiming the book is open there's less power after it was opened in before it was open if the book is open the never promises open to us we got an abstract of the title deed that it belongs to us we set out more now that the seals are opened and before they wear open because now the whole ever promise in the book belongs to you this message to show you God's attitude toward the lost his attitude toward the sick a man that his mercy is so great a man coming right down now to something I want to come and bring this down to close as we come here now you know Jesus asked will I find faith on the earth he didn't say well I find nice churches will I find good people but will I find somebody that believes Malachi 4 was sent to turn your heart from unbelief back to faith again a man to cause a people to believe so that we can have a conscious faith to to to hold on to the promise let me just tell you a little you know a little experience that I have this year that where the Lord spoke to me you know some people have visions some people have dreams I have dreams sometimes that God has used but there's been many times it got a spoke to me an audible voice I hear his voice speak directly and you know I we got a we've got a brother in the church that Satan has done his best to kill and you know he's just not even missed threescore and ten you know but Satan's done his best to just before our annual October meetings two years ago the doctors had given him up to die called his family in said he just got ours to live get had a son in Montana to call home and get him home get everybody the family together the man's gonna die well it was before our october meetings be quite honest with you I didn't want a funeral in my October meetings I've started asking people in my church to make an appointment when they're gonna die but most the time it ain't convenient loosen you up for something so that was been doing this best to kill him you know and so he is he was they had told him he's gonna die call the family in he's that at very low hour and low

some some time with that and somewhere about August he went into and he had a doctor's visit and the doctor came in with the examination room and he came in smiling and he said let me just shake the hand of an awesome man Wow Wow Wow and he says your blood work shows you have no cancer [Music] what time to wrap his mind around this not understanding exactly what the doctor said he asked the doctor again about the cancer and the doctor said what cancer there is no cancerous gone and I can't explain where it went but your lymph nodes is normal and everything is normal your blood work is normal and you are cancer-free but you know don't give up sometimes so he strikes him back down with Oh Anna with a heart condition where he's having his arteries clogging and he's had so far 30 stents in his heart that's a record six balloons procedures you've been through numerous heart attacks back in November of 2019 doctors gave up on him said we can't do anything more said your heart will explode any time and they could examine him they've said we will look to see if we can do open heart and see if we can do something that he said not your you're not a candidate for it we ruled it out it's too risky and you know God had healed him a cancer and he's a miracle but you know here this enemy still come in trying with heart heart trouble that's trying to kill him and the doctors you know had told him you know you got this cardiovascular disease that keeps clogging your arteries and you know it's got the place we can't do nothing more for you you you know you have another another spell you're gone you know just get ready to die so you know I hear this news because they were talking about open heart and all of this and you know and now I I was praying about it all through the night I'm talking to the Lord you know and I'm saying you know Lord Kenneth you understand what is what he's going through what what what to do about it you know and it was Wednesday November the 13th I woke her early and I was preparing my first cup of coffee and through the night as often as I woke I was praying for this brother and when he was doing a medically induced stress test the top of his heart quit working doctors had made that decision open-heart of death and they were discussing the option of that heart condition and we would rule out that they couldn't do anything and so I was got up then and I was praying for him and I and I told the Lord I said God Kenneth has had his showdown if he don't get a healing he will die and I said what are you gonna do about it I wouldn't being smart I was asking what are you gonna do about this and and so as soon as I got that out of the mouth the voice of god came roaring back to me and he says I've already done that part what are you gonna do about [Applause] I'll tell you what we did we brought him down to the front and loaded him with the oil and prayed the prayer of faith ha ha ha and man you think about it just for a moment it's not what God's gonna do about it he's already done it he paid for your healing he paid for your sins he already done it it's a finished work I'm asking you what's not Calvary sufficient hallelujah wasn't it complete did the blood that was shed she'll ever disease a man didn't say never center isn't in a complete work then it's true it isn't what God's gonna do about it then he's already done it he's already healed every sick person he's already saved every last person and I want to announce tonight his bloodiest sufficient and ever devil is already defeated Lord a gun you know really we should never ask God to heal anyone he's already done it it's up to us to believe and accept it and they've command sacred to take his hands off the gun property [Applause] exodus 20:3 25 I will take sickness from the myth city this is what God said he would do it's the Creator at work you get healed tonight the enemy will attack again you got healed through the fire and enemies attacked again it's not like your soul your soul gets saved you'll never have to be saved again a man it never gets lost again but your physical realm son of a curse because of Adam's fall and we can't live forever and we were born in this world to die amen so time upon time on time Satan buffets us and he attacks and God heals us in the attacks again and God heals and he attacks again but God says what are you gonna do about it hey man and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it he commissioned his church to cast out Devils and sickness is a demon man I can't heal and furthermore Jesus Christ cannot heal a man if he stood here with my clothes on tonight it stirred here in my shoes and man he could not heal anybody a man you see you would say Jesus will you heal me it's like I can't do it I'd have to go back on my word I said 2,000 years ago it's finished and it's still finished all you gotta do is receive [Music] that's why we don't have to call him down from heaven to heal us he's already healed us he already came down from heaven to heal every person to save Emma's sick one to save ever sinner he paid the price it's a finished work all we are going to do is cast the devil out hey man so what I did is I I did what God said do I know anything with all and we prayed the prayer of faith I didn't call brothers up hoping that one of them had the faith to do this we have the faith and that faith is is we believe what God said in his word to be true so what brother Tim I don't have much faith well let me ask you this do you believe that God's Word is true do you believe that God does not lie well then you got all the faith you need right there faith it's just simply believed that God is going to do what he said he would do hallelujah that's all faith deals since then brother Ken let's head to war the devil told him he would die before Thanksgiving but he lied told him then he would die before Christmas but he lied and man did he said he wouldn't live to see the new years but he lied and then he told him he would die for his granddaughter got married last month but he lied because he don't have the power of death and the man's hardly missed a day of work
