[50:45] read uh the scriptures this evening
[50:47] brother brandham said in in the
[50:48] conference he said I was reading an
[50:49] article or a little poet said that
[50:52] Caesar was going to ask he said he was
[50:55] going to ride in a great Chariot and he
[50:56] wanted some of his soldiers an honorable
[50:59] Soldier to ride with him down through
[51:00] the streets of this great Jubilee and
[51:03] all the Warriors trim their plumes and
[51:06] their polish their shield and their
[51:08] helmets getting ready to pass by Caesar
[51:12] to review to see who he had to choose to
[51:15] ride with him in this great
[51:17] parade and said all of his Warriors
[51:20] walking perfectly straightly walked by
[51:22] and stood by stood with their salute and
[51:25] said all along
[51:27] Caesar and said all along Caesar looked
[51:30] at each one of them as he come by and
[51:32] said after a while a little bitty old
[51:34] Soldier crippled up in his arm scoured
[51:37] all over his face and everything walked
[51:39] by and he felt ashamed of himself and he
[51:41] kind of bowed his head and started away
[51:43] and Caesar said wait a minute wait a
[51:45] minute there come back here the little
[51:47] soldier walked up and fell down on his
[51:49] knees and he said yes great emperor and
[51:52] he said where did you get them
[51:54] scars said why what are you all scarred
[51:57] up about he said I got them in the
[52:00] battlefield fighting for my Emperor he
[52:03] said you set up here by me you earned a
[52:06] ride mother B said I don't care whether
[52:09] I'm whether I'm a DD a PhD a LD I want
[52:13] some scars to show that I've been in the
[52:15] battle that's what the Christian ought
[52:18] to do don't you choose the flowery easy
[52:20] things I'll take the way with the Lord's
[52:24] despised few Isaiah chapter
[52:28] 53 who hath believed our report and to
[52:31] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[52:35] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[52:37] plant and as a root out of a dry ground
[52:40] and he hath no form nor
[52:42] commonness and when we shall see him
[52:44] there is no beauty that we should desire
[52:47] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[52:50] Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief
[52:53] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[52:56] and he was despised and we esteemed him
[52:58] not surely he hath borne our griefs and
[53:01] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[53:04] him stricken smitten of God and
[53:06] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[53:10] transgressions and he was bruised for
[53:12] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[53:14] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[53:17] we are healed in the Gospel of John
[53:20] chapter n
[53:32] and as Jesus passed by he saw a man
[53:36] which was blind from his birth and his
[53:39] disciples asked him saying master who
[53:42] did Sin this man or his parents that he
[53:45] was born blind and Jesus answered
[53:48] neither hath this man sinned nor his
[53:51] parents but that the works of God should
[53:54] be made manifest in him may God bless
[53:57] the reading of the word you may be
[53:58] seated here in the presence of the Lord
[54:00] and I just like to take a thought that
[54:02] the Lord put on my heart while I was
[54:04] sitting there Sunday Sunday morning last
[54:06] Sunday morning my brother Aaron was
[54:08] speaking just heard the spirit of God
[54:11] begin to speak to me on unhe hurt unhe
[54:15] hurt by the supernatural unhe hurt by
[54:18] the Supernatural and I actually had to
[54:19] look up the word just to make sure it
[54:21] wasn't one of my my kind of words cuz it
[54:24] actually is a word unhe hurt it means
[54:27] not
[54:30] hurt I I thought that was all right holy
[54:33] spirit kind of speaks my language and
[54:34] actually is a words it means not hurt it
[54:37] means not harmed it means free from
[54:40] wound or injury I thought that's that
[54:43] that right there is enough to maybe just
[54:46] to expound on just for a little bit is
[54:48] unhe
[54:49] hurt free from wounds by the
[54:53] supernatural the only reason that we're
[54:55] here is because of the Supernatural and
[54:57] I I know that that being part there are
[55:00] Parts about being a Christian that we
[55:03] would simply say that are just not fun
[55:06] that just I just put it down put it down
[55:08] in in English language there are certain
[55:10] things about the Christian walk that are
[55:11] simply just not fun there are things
[55:13] that we have to go through things that
[55:15] we don't understand and the further that
[55:17] we go in the Christian journey and we
[55:19] look and we see that as the more that we
[55:22] face of leay osia and we see here in per
[55:25] perilous times the more that we see the
[55:28] more we seem to look at things and
[55:30] people we live in an age of people's
[55:32] rights we live in a age of of the woman
[55:35] but we live in an hour where it seems
[55:38] like men and women are not not just
[55:40] Christians but in all in all in all
[55:43] parameters of life it look you look
[55:45] about upon any human being it doesn't
[55:47] matter what what background that they're
[55:49] from it does it doesn't matter it you
[55:51] look upon humanity and it seems that
[55:54] people are more hurt and the more broken
[55:57] and they're more easily offended at
[55:59] because of the the exposure of the
[56:02] attack of the enemy in the hour that
[56:03] we're living in it doesn't matter
[56:05] whether you're a Christian and it
[56:06] doesn't matter whether you're you're
[56:08] you're a uh a nominal person it doesn't
[56:10] matter whether you're an atheist you
[56:12] look out upon people and people are so
[56:13] hurt they're so offended they carry
[56:15] things they carry hurts they carry scars
[56:18] all throughout their lives and as
[56:20] Christians we we we we know that we are
[56:23] to forgive but often times we forgive
[56:25] without forgetting exactly what is
[56:27] transpiring in our lives and you watch
[56:29] people and you you watch their lives you
[56:31] can see that that people carry hurts and
[56:34] they carry scars all their lives and you
[56:37] watch somebody if you're acquainted with
[56:39] somebody that's scarred up or somebody
[56:41] that's been in a battle they they carry
[56:43] those things and you'll watch as scars
[56:45] and hurts they will literally destroy
[56:48] families they they hurt little hurts
[56:50] maybe little words off the cuff or or
[56:53] things of that nature it will literally
[56:55] destroy a family it will destroy a
[56:57] business it will destroy relationships
[57:00] and literally families has been
[57:02] dissolved because one word because of
[57:05] one word you watch and what it is it
[57:07] it's wounds that have never been able to
[57:09] heal and people that do not have the
[57:11] chance or do not give it the chance to
[57:14] allow it to heal it's it's like always
[57:16] it's always like having an open wound as
[57:18] a kid we you you know you scar yourself
[57:21] up and get them strawberries all over
[57:22] your legs mama always said you keep
[57:24] picking on them things ain't going toit
[57:26] heal up and she told us you're going to
[57:28] have a scar there and we we'd heard that
[57:30] statement that girls like scars so we
[57:32] kept picking at them things and and uh
[57:35] you know we still got some of things but
[57:37] often times you you find people that
[57:39] wear their feelings on their shoulders
[57:41] or they constantly have a have a wounded
[57:44] Spirit they're they're constantly they
[57:45] don't allow it to heal and the only way
[57:48] I know to heal a wounded spirit is take
[57:50] the word of God and to allow it to heal
[57:52] because men constantly have have things
[57:55] upon their shoulders and and men don't
[57:57] realize the Power of Words If if we just
[57:59] be real honest about it men don't
[58:01] realize the volume of words that they
[58:04] that their capacity that the words that
[58:06] they have is that words really do hurt
[58:08] people is that right words really do
[58:11] hurt people the people that that man
[58:12] that said that sticks and stones may
[58:14] break my bones but words can never hurt
[58:16] me never had a friend stab him in the
[58:18] back because words can really hurt they
[58:20] can they can really afflict but you
[58:22] don't realize sometimes you don't
[58:24] realize the the effect of of of a good
[58:26] word and you don't realize the effect of
[58:29] a bad word how it how it changes a
[58:31] person's uh their their ideas or what
[58:34] they look at for the whole Calamity of
[58:36] the day how they how they go about their
[58:38] life their whole entire atmosphere is
[58:40] controlled upon word you just wake up
[58:42] one morning and say good morning ugly
[58:45] your whole day is going to be completely
[58:48] in disarray because you messed up
[58:50] because of one word you should have been
[58:52] saying that to yourself not to the lady
[58:54] that was sitting there in the bed to you
[58:56] I never been so dumb to do that I didn't
[58:58] marry ugly wife I married a beautiful
[59:00] wife so I know I ain't never going to
[59:01] have to say that but it's amazing when
[59:04] you just say one word you understand
[59:06] what I'm saying right here you
[59:07] understand where I'm going it's it's
[59:09] amazing when you drop a word because a
[59:11] word is a seed and if you drop that word
[59:14] you don't realize the power or the
[59:16] effect of that word it's just like it's
[59:18] just like the preaching of the Gospel we
[59:20] really don't know who is and who ain't
[59:22] elect our job is simply to preach the
[59:24] gospel and let God do the Gathering is
[59:26] that right so we don't realize sometimes
[59:29] the words that we are speaking is it you
[59:31] a word is a seed it's like a it's like a
[59:33] little apple seed that you plant into
[59:36] the ground and you planted it there 20
[59:38] years ago all of them apples that you
[59:40] ever see was in the life of that seed
[59:42] when it was planted right there and
[59:44] sometimes you don't see the root of
[59:46] bitterness you don't see the root of of
[59:48] depression and anxiety when you say one
[59:51] word when you say you don't realize the
[59:53] complex that's going with it we I
[59:55] remember remember in high school when
[59:57] when Matthew planted he planted a little
[59:59] oak tree outside that that he got there
[1:00:00] in school and he planted it right s
[1:00:03] right right outside of Dad's house and
[1:00:05] you know we we didn't we didn't think we
[1:00:07] be honest we really didn't think we'd
[1:00:08] still be here to be honest and he
[1:00:10] planted that tree about 30 yards away
[1:00:13] from Matthews or Dad's house there and
[1:00:15] as that thing grew up over the years we
[1:00:17] had to cut that thing down because in
[1:00:18] branches then branch has done reached
[1:00:21] all the way out there and has getting
[1:00:22] close to the roof of the thing you don't
[1:00:24] realize sometimes what you're planning
[1:00:27] you think well it seems so small you
[1:00:29] just go cut down that tree and have to
[1:00:31] deal with all the branches and all the
[1:00:33] all the brush that comes off of it
[1:00:34] you'll find how powerful that little
[1:00:37] seed is you see the Bible said that
[1:00:39] Proverbs Proverbs 14 that the spirit of
[1:00:42] a man will sustain his infirmity but a
[1:00:46] wounded Spirit who can bear it you see
[1:00:48] it's kind of like it's kind of like how
[1:00:50] brother random would describe it as a
[1:00:52] cancer that that cancer is a bruised
[1:00:55] cell he said he literally said it's a
[1:00:57] backslid sail he said it was a good sail
[1:01:00] that got bruised and it's backslid and
[1:01:02] what did it do all of a sudden because
[1:01:04] cancer is a scavenger it's a buzzard it
[1:01:07] starts eating on dead things and that
[1:01:10] cancer begins to work and it goes to get
[1:01:12] to getting to eating on that dead thing
[1:01:15] and it's amazing how that your entire
[1:01:17] body can suffer because of one bad cell
[1:01:20] in your body it's amazing because it
[1:01:22] only started with one thing and you
[1:01:24] begin to watch some body then when they
[1:01:27] we begin to suffer from that that
[1:01:29] Calamity or that or that word called
[1:01:31] cancer it affects the entire it infects
[1:01:35] it infects and affects the entire family
[1:01:38] when somebody has been diagnosed with
[1:01:40] cancer but worse than the cancer of a
[1:01:43] body is a cancer of a spirit or a soul
[1:01:46] it will literally eat up every good cell
[1:01:48] that there is because that's what cancer
[1:01:50] does it attaches itself to all the good
[1:01:53] cells in which it's most built to build
[1:01:56] you up that cancer will come down and
[1:01:59] begin to eat down the good cells because
[1:02:03] of what because of what it does because
[1:02:05] of it is a life that is laying behind
[1:02:07] it you ever watch somebody that has ever
[1:02:10] suffered from the infirmity of a lie
[1:02:13] when somebody when somebody told
[1:02:16] something on somebody that wasn't true
[1:02:18] and that person becomes they become a a
[1:02:21] a a prisoner because of somebody else's
[1:02:23] lie I I remember as a as a little boy I
[1:02:26] remember watching this I be I'll be
[1:02:28] honest I thought he was I I really
[1:02:30] thought this was one of the strongest
[1:02:32] Christian brothers that I'd ever been
[1:02:34] around I'd been a lot of places and I I
[1:02:36] really thought a lot of this brother but
[1:02:38] there was a there was this this brother
[1:02:39] he was away from here he he had a lie
[1:02:41] that was told on him and and and it
[1:02:44] really bothered this brother it really
[1:02:46] bothered him so bad that this brother
[1:02:48] went from a strong Christian to the
[1:02:50] weakest of Christians in a matters of
[1:02:52] moments because somebody told a lie on
[1:02:54] him and and he literally he he be to
[1:02:56] begin broke down he began to get broke
[1:02:58] down and before long he was believing
[1:03:01] that lie and it was a complete lie that
[1:03:03] somebody told on him just because people
[1:03:06] people are rude ain't that crazy that
[1:03:09] people would do something kids are kids
[1:03:11] are just mean they're they're just mean
[1:03:13] and because because a rumor circulated
[1:03:16] that brother became one of the he he was
[1:03:18] a strong man in the faith he was a he
[1:03:20] was a real Christian and before long
[1:03:22] that man lost his house he lost his wife
[1:03:25] he lost his children and he lost the
[1:03:28] headship of Christ you see Satan cannot
[1:03:31] do anything until you believe
[1:03:34] him and you just flip it just a minute
[1:03:37] God can't do anything until you believe
[1:03:41] him it it is all upon on what how you
[1:03:45] receive it is that right and you watch
[1:03:48] you watch you begin to watch it's you
[1:03:50] just deal with people's lives you begin
[1:03:52] to see I I remember one time just
[1:03:54] dealing with a young man who had fought
[1:03:57] some serious demons because of of a
[1:03:59] parent because of a parent that said
[1:04:02] something to him when he was a child and
[1:04:04] he carried that all of his life he had
[1:04:07] lived with that scar his entire life and
[1:04:10] this this young man was not even close
[1:04:13] to what that what that Daddy had said
[1:04:15] about him but because of that word that
[1:04:18] a father figure had in his life he lived
[1:04:21] with that complex over top of
[1:04:23] him it's amazing the power that words
[1:04:27] have I I think it's I think it's uh
[1:04:29] incredible when you begin to look at the
[1:04:32] at the whole scheme of Christianity of
[1:04:35] our life that that God ain't offered us
[1:04:39] uh flower beds of ease he's not offered
[1:04:41] us he's not offered us days where we're
[1:04:43] not going to get sick he's not offered
[1:04:44] us days where we're going to be we're
[1:04:47] going to be blessed and never going to
[1:04:48] live in famine we're never going to have
[1:04:50] to go out and worry about our flat tires
[1:04:52] we're never going to have to worry about
[1:04:53] our our cars breaking down God doesn't
[1:04:56] offer us those things but he offers us
[1:04:58] healing when we are sick he offers us
[1:05:01] joy when we have sorrow you're going to
[1:05:04] go through some stuff as a Christian and
[1:05:07] you're going to go through some
[1:05:08] calamities of life but let me say it
[1:05:11] like brother Ron says it I've been hurt
[1:05:13] before but I made it I've been sick
[1:05:16] before but I made it I've been broken
[1:05:19] before but I made it I've been let down
[1:05:21] before but I made it I've been nervous
[1:05:24] before but I made
[1:05:27] it so the enemy can whisper all kinds of
[1:05:30] Lies the wi the enemy can come in and
[1:05:33] try to rob you of your joy but recognize
[1:05:37] immediately that Satan cannot do
[1:05:39] anything to you unless you believe him
[1:05:42] the only Power of a lie is when you
[1:05:45] believe that lie the only Power of the
[1:05:48] truth is when you believe that truth and
[1:05:51] you're going to have to go through some
[1:05:53] stuff if you're going to ride in The
[1:05:56] Chariot with our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:58] you're going to have to go through some
[1:06:01] battles God has God has not sent us here
[1:06:03] on a picnic but he has sent us here on a
[1:06:07] battlefield and Paul said and I believe
[1:06:09] this is some of the greatest words I
[1:06:12] believe that some of the greatest words
[1:06:14] in literature that has ever been written
[1:06:16] but not just only in in literature but
[1:06:19] in the word of God Paul said that I
[1:06:22] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:06:24] present time are not worthy be to be
[1:06:26] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:06:29] revealed in us that the things that
[1:06:32] you're going through right now are not
[1:06:36] worthy let me say cancer is not worthy
[1:06:39] to be compared to the glory which Ron
[1:06:41] Spencer will receive let me say this to
[1:06:44] you loss of loved ones is not not worthy
[1:06:49] to be compared to the glory that's going
[1:06:51] to be revealed in
[1:06:53] you come on somebody a loss of friends
[1:06:57] because he came to the message it's not
[1:06:59] worthy to be compared to the
[1:07:02] Glory Hallelujah you're going to go
[1:07:05] through some trials you're going to go
[1:07:07] through some
[1:07:08] calamities Paul said in 2 Corinthians 1
[1:07:11] and5 for as the sufferings of Christ
[1:07:15] hath abound in us so our consolation
[1:07:17] also aboundeth by Christ let me read it
[1:07:20] to you in the passion it says as just as
[1:07:23] we experience the abundance of Christ
[1:07:25] Christ's own sufferings even more of
[1:07:27] God's Own Comforts will Cascade upon us
[1:07:30] through our Union with Christ if
[1:07:33] troubles weigh us down that just means
[1:07:36] that we will receive even more Comfort
[1:07:38] to pass on to you for your deliverance
[1:07:42] for the comfort pouring into us empowers
[1:07:45] us to bring Comfort to you and with this
[1:07:48] Comfort upholding you you can endure
[1:07:50] victoriously the same suffering that we
[1:07:54] experience
[1:07:56] Paul said I have been through some
[1:07:57] suffering times I was with 39 minus
[1:08:01] twice I was I was shipwreck sometimes I
[1:08:04] went through some things but I went
[1:08:06] through these things to give you
[1:08:10] comfort when you suffer in your body
[1:08:14] when you suffer in your life when you
[1:08:16] suffer I say this to you that your
[1:08:19] suffering is a Crown of Glory
[1:08:26] when when one of the most precious
[1:08:28] people in my life my teeny when she was
[1:08:32] going off the scene she was a she was a
[1:08:34] spiritual Rock for the Spencer she was a
[1:08:37] she was a kind of lady that she she was
[1:08:40] she was them kind of lady brother
[1:08:42] brother Doug that spoke spoke softly but
[1:08:44] she carried a big stick she was the kind
[1:08:47] of woman that prayed real silently but
[1:08:49] she moved all of hell and heaven at the
[1:08:50] same time she was that kind of a woman
[1:08:54] and just days before just moments before
[1:08:57] she passes away brother Davey is in an
[1:09:00] accident and he we don't really realize
[1:09:03] what all brother Dave is going to go
[1:09:04] through in his in his walk and in his
[1:09:07] journey when he wrecks up here and he
[1:09:09] wrecks on black ice we didn't know
[1:09:11] whether he's going to be paralyzed we
[1:09:12] didn't know if Whit he was going to be
[1:09:13] without a husband but just a few moments
[1:09:16] later my teeny starts dying with a
[1:09:19] terrible heart attack but the Lord had
[1:09:22] spoke a word to brother R said oh thou
[1:09:25] suffering stand and be healed and
[1:09:28] literally in moments of us getting to
[1:09:31] the hospital we watched a Lady of Grace
[1:09:35] die Like A
[1:09:37] Champion the doctor asked her said are
[1:09:40] you ready to go she said oh I'm ready to
[1:09:44] go she didn't die like a coward she
[1:09:47] didn't die like some wimy little
[1:09:49] Christian she died like a soldier in the
[1:09:53] army of the Lord and you might have to
[1:09:55] go through some calamities of life you
[1:09:57] might have to go through rumors of life
[1:09:59] you might have to go through downtrodden
[1:10:01] times in life but suffering turn it to
[1:10:05] standing for
[1:10:06] Joy Paul would say when he was going
[1:10:09] down to Jerusalem in Acts chapter 20 he
[1:10:12] said I'd go Bound by the spirit to
[1:10:14] Jerusalem he didn't know what was coming
[1:10:17] by his way he didn't know what was going
[1:10:19] to happen down there to him he said but
[1:10:21] none of these things the things that I
[1:10:23] don't know about the things that that
[1:10:25] are uncertain none of them things move
[1:10:29] me Hallelujah I don't know what's coming
[1:10:32] but I know that God is
[1:10:36] leading you see in all of these things
[1:10:40] the Supernatural is present to Prevail
[1:10:43] over all the
[1:10:44] hurts of the enemy now to be honest with
[1:10:48] you I would have titled this sermon
[1:10:50] completely different I would have titled
[1:10:51] it healed by the supernatural but I've
[1:10:54] been doing this long enough time to tell
[1:10:57] you that you can be un hurt by the
[1:11:01] supernatural somebody may have done you
[1:11:03] wrong you can be un hurt by the
[1:11:06] supernatural business might be slow but
[1:11:08] you can be un hurt by the Supernatural
[1:11:11] friends might walk away from you but you
[1:11:13] can be un hurt by the supernatural let
[1:11:16] me say this to you there are going to be
[1:11:18] some times in your life when you have to
[1:11:21] leave the Comforts of home when it come
[1:11:23] to Joseph and Mary I I sat down had a
[1:11:27] had a conversation one time with a with
[1:11:29] a man he he he stood there and I I was
[1:11:31] preaching on I was preaching on the cost
[1:11:33] to leaving home and what it cost to
[1:11:35] leave home and talking about Joseph and
[1:11:37] Mary having to leave their home and go
[1:11:39] all the way there and the brother come
[1:11:40] up to me and he said look he said them
[1:11:42] was hard times for them they done
[1:11:44] receive myrr they done receive gold and
[1:11:46] they receive frankincense I said brother
[1:11:48] have you ever had to leave home without
[1:11:50] wanting to leave
[1:11:52] home you talk about a story when you
[1:11:55] start looking at Abraham Abraham had to
[1:11:57] leave all the Comforts of home you ever
[1:12:00] have been pushed out of your house
[1:12:02] whether by whether by eviction or
[1:12:04] whether you just needed to move you
[1:12:06] don't like leaving the Comforts of home
[1:12:09] is that right the devil don't leave
[1:12:11] don't like leaving the Comforts of home
[1:12:13] that's why he pushes against this gospel
[1:12:16] truth but Abraham had to leave his
[1:12:18] Comforts of life to follow the
[1:12:21] Supernatural and Abraham's faith is a
[1:12:23] testament that the Supernatural will
[1:12:26] lead you past your
[1:12:28] hurts the supernatural will lead you
[1:12:31] past your hurts and Abraham's
[1:12:33] Faith his faith literally produced
[1:12:36] Jehovah
[1:12:39] Gyra I'll say this again Abraham's Faith
[1:12:43] produced Jehovah Gyra it wasn't until he
[1:12:45] got into a spot when he was challenged
[1:12:49] to sacri sacrifice everything that he
[1:12:52] ever loved everything that he ever hoped
[1:12:54] for he come to this spot in Genesis chap
[1:12:56] 22 can you imagine the hurt brother VJ
[1:13:00] when he is asked to sacrifice his own
[1:13:05] son but literally because of Abraham's
[1:13:08] Faith Isaac is unhe hurt by the
[1:13:12] Supernatural and because of Abraham's
[1:13:15] Faith there that word was spoken to them
[1:13:18] thy seed shall possess the Gate of its
[1:13:20] enemies and literally because of
[1:13:22] Abraham's faith that three Hebrew
[1:13:24] children were able to possess the Gate
[1:13:26] of that furnace and walk out of there
[1:13:29] unhe hurt by the furnace because of
[1:13:32] Abraham's
[1:13:37] faith it doesn't matter the
[1:13:39] crisis it doesn't matter the
[1:13:41] calamities the supernatural God is
[1:13:45] close you you see where God found you at
[1:13:49] he found you in your
[1:13:51] Brokenness he found you in your mess he
[1:13:54] found you in your trial there was none
[1:13:56] of us that are sitting here today in the
[1:13:59] same spot that we are in right now when
[1:14:01] he found us can I get a witness or is is
[1:14:04] the rest of the Angels here
[1:14:06] tonight he found us in our Brokenness he
[1:14:10] found us when we were that without hope
[1:14:12] he found us when we had give up hope but
[1:14:16] Jesus spoke these words they that are
[1:14:19] whole don't need a physician but they
[1:14:22] that are sick need a physician I want to
[1:14:25] be very clear to you when we showed up
[1:14:28] here all of us were un we were all of us
[1:14:31] showed up here as damaged goods we
[1:14:34] showed up here and the things of our
[1:14:37] life were Rocky they were shaky there
[1:14:40] were things that we were nervous
[1:14:42] about none of us showed up here like the
[1:14:46] picture of Grace we showed up here like
[1:14:49] a
[1:14:51] disgrace Hallelujah come on somebody
[1:14:55] that's the kind of people that God is
[1:14:56] looking for people that don't think
[1:14:58] they're perfect people that realize
[1:15:01] they're not whole he's looking for
[1:15:04] somebody that he can make
[1:15:08] whole and all my life I am ass short of
[1:15:10] this one thing that Christ takes my
[1:15:13] Brokenness and makes it holess in all my
[1:15:17] life I can assure you Church of the
[1:15:19] Living God in your sorrow Christ will be
[1:15:22] your joy in your storm

[1:16:00] Doubt we've all had those moments that
[1:16:02] like why'd God take them

[1:16:27] enough of it he said he said Dad we
[1:16:28] prayed the same

[1:20:13] speak from
[1:20:15] Faith aren't you supposed to see what

[1:20:37] was saying thank God I'm Healed I'm not
[1:20:39] blind no more I met Jesus and
[1:20:44] Hallelujah there are going to be some
[1:20:46] times in your life when you don't feel
[1:20:49] like shouting but that's the time to
[1:20:52] shout there's going to be some time in
[1:20:54] your life when your business is on the
[1:20:57] bank Brinks of bankruptcy but you still
[1:21:00] got to bless God there's going to be
[1:21:03] some times in your life when you can't

[1:21:09] tie there's going to be some times in
[1:21:12] your life when everybody has got their
[1:21:15] knife out and ready to stab you in the
[1:21:17] back but at that time

[1:21:58] my family but I'm going to make it no
[1:22:01] one wants a no one wants their heart
[1:22:04] broke no one wants to be crushed by life
[1:22:07] no one wants to be on the other end of
[1:22:09] the phone when the doctor says I I'd
[1:22:11] like for you to come in I'd like to talk
[1:22:13] to you about your test results in person

[1:22:18] principal or the teacher writes writes
[1:22:21] the parent says your child is a troubled
[1:22:23] child or they're failing nobody wants to
[1:22:26] be that person nobody wants to be the
[1:22:28] person that the people that you love
[1:22:31] turn and hold their heart where you
[1:22:33] can't love them no
[1:22:35] more no one wants to be that no one can
[1:22:40] explain what it's like to feel so
[1:22:43] utterly
[1:22:45] incapable and un unable and
[1:22:50] Afraid like
[1:22:53] Jesus because when Jesus goes to a spot
[1:22:56] that he's been many
[1:22:58] times he's been there with his friends
[1:23:01] and his friends couldn't stay awake with
[1:23:03] him so it's proof that if friends
[1:23:06] couldn't hang out with Jesus through all
[1:23:08] of his trials your friends can't hang
[1:23:09] out with you and all your
[1:23:11] trials your friends will go to sleep on
[1:23:14] you they say they got your back but they
[1:23:16] will go to sleep on you young people the
[1:23:18] only person that you can count on is
[1:23:22] Jesus come on somebody I'm not talking
[1:23:25] about I'm not talking about we're living
[1:23:27] we live right here right here in these
[1:23:29] moments all the time I realize that
[1:23:32] these are the highlights of your
[1:23:35] week these are the highlights of your
[1:23:38] week but it's these moments of victory
[1:23:41] that gets you through your
[1:23:45] despair come on somebody it was in the
[1:23:48] moments when they were watching Jesus be
[1:23:51] beat that they remembered that
[1:23:55] he that he had the power to raise from
[1:23:58] the
[1:24:00] dead so what am I saying to you that in
[1:24:04] your hurts realize that you can be
[1:24:08] unheard by the
[1:24:11] supernatural Jesus had been here with
[1:24:13] his friends he goes to the Mount of
[1:24:16] Olives where JW Judas knew that he'd
[1:24:19] been there often
[1:24:21] times and Jesus prays in MA or Mark 14
[1:24:24] and
[1:24:25] 34 brother Chris he prays this and said
[1:24:29] my soul is
[1:24:31] overwhelmed by
[1:24:34] death he he begins to pray this kind of
[1:24:36] prayer he's under so much
[1:24:39] pain that
[1:24:41] scientist explain it that Jesus was
[1:24:44] literally dying from a broken heart
[1:24:47] because the only time that this can
[1:24:51] transpire that sweat turns into blood is
[1:24:54] when you die from a broken
[1:24:57] heart and here Judas is in the garden of
[1:25:03] olives with Jesus with Jesus and he's
[1:25:06] turning him
[1:25:08] over he's turning him over brother Bram
[1:25:11] says and lean not to thine own
[1:25:13] understanding he said Judas thought that
[1:25:15] Jesus could get himself out of it
[1:25:17] because he lean to his own
[1:25:21] understanding this is a significant spot
[1:25:24] because this is a spot of the crushing
[1:25:28] of the
[1:25:29] Olive and you think wow that's a
[1:25:32] beautiful olive tree that's a beautiful
[1:25:34] it's a beautiful it's a beautiful nut
[1:25:36] it's a beautiful fruit it's a beautiful
[1:25:37] life but the real beauty is not
[1:25:41] expressed until it goes through the
[1:25:48] crushing your real Beauty as a Christian
[1:25:51] life is not seen in in public but it's
[1:25:55] watched in
[1:25:57] private when you're all alone and you
[1:26:01] have to prove whether you're a Christian
[1:26:03] or
[1:26:04] not you can't see your real Beauty until
[1:26:07] you go through some crushing times I
[1:26:09] don't believe that any of us signed up
[1:26:11] to be Christians just to have just to
[1:26:13] have complete we we didn't sign up
[1:26:15] thinking that we're going to we're going
[1:26:17] to go through life and never have
[1:26:18] calamities and never have
[1:26:20] problems but it's literally in the
[1:26:22] crushing of the olive
[1:26:25] that literally the most beauty that the
[1:26:28] crushing is the way of preservation for
[1:26:32] the Olive that it's also the way to get
[1:26:35] what is most valuable out of that
[1:26:41] Olive what does God think about you as a
[1:26:46] church that he would send you as a
[1:26:49] church through all of these things with
[1:26:51] brother Homer through all these things
[1:26:53] with brother Ron
[1:26:55] all these things that you've dealt with
[1:26:56] I'm not just excluding I'm just I'm
[1:26:58] preaching to you anybody else that hears
[1:27:00] this on the stream they've got their own
[1:27:01] problems that they they've been crushed
[1:27:03] by but what does God think about you
[1:27:05] that you've stood here and you watched a
[1:27:08] man fall out of a tree stand get get ran
[1:27:10] over by get ran over by a ran over by a
[1:27:13] tractor lose his
[1:27:16] leg sit here in a in a wheelchair and
[1:27:19] preach to you be therefore
[1:27:22] ready what is God think about you as a
[1:27:26] church that you can handle the crushing
[1:27:30] that in the crushing it brings forth the
[1:27:32] real
[1:27:33] value let me let me just let me just
[1:27:36] stop right there on that moment brother
[1:27:38] Homer was a testament to this church and
[1:27:40] to all of the Bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:27:43] he lived out the words that Paul said in
[1:27:45] Romans 8 and 38 that I am persuaded that
[1:27:48] neither death nor life nor things
[1:27:51] present nor things to come nor angels
[1:27:53] nor principalities no powers that
[1:27:55] nothing shall be able to separate me
[1:27:57] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:27:59] Jesus when he stood here when he stood
[1:28:02] here when he was in pain that he broke
[1:28:04] all of the bones in his hip when he sat
[1:28:06] here in a wheelchair and his leg was cut
[1:28:08] off he said I am
[1:28:10] persuaded that this gospel is more
[1:28:14] valuable than the hurt that I've been
[1:28:16] through Homer Fraser was a testament to
[1:28:20] say I am persuaded I've been hurt but
[1:28:23] I'm going to still preach I've been
[1:28:25] bruised but I'm still going to
[1:28:28] testify I've been
[1:28:31] broken but in my
[1:28:38] Brokenness the crushing is not the end
[1:28:41] of the
[1:28:42] story you might look at the crushing of
[1:28:45] the olive as the end of its life but I
[1:28:47] want to say this to you it's not the end
[1:28:49] of the story and Satan would like to
[1:28:51] whisper to you that even though you may
[1:28:53] have been sick and you got this and it
[1:28:55] looks like you're going to die with it
[1:28:57] and you got this trouble that Satan
[1:28:59] would like to whisper in your ear and
[1:29:01] tell you that your story is over but I
[1:29:04] want to announce to all of Hell your
[1:29:06] story is not over
[1:29:09] Lazarus this sickness is not into
[1:29:12] death this is going to be Jesus's
[1:29:15] greatest Miracle one of his best
[1:29:18] Miracles but it's going to be his most
[1:29:21] questioned
[1:29:26] when you look at your life sister Brenda
[1:29:29] you are one of God's best
[1:29:32] Miracles but by the people that know
[1:29:35] Lazarus it's going to be the most
[1:29:37] question are you with me are you with me
[1:29:40] Brother Sam you're one of God's greatest
[1:29:42] Miracles but it's going to be one of the
[1:29:45] most questioned it's because the enemy
[1:29:48] will always whisper that your story is
[1:29:51] over but Lazarus I want to to say this
[1:29:54] to you your story is not over it's just
[1:30:00] beginning come on somebody there are
[1:30:02] going to be people that say why didn't
[1:30:04] you show up here why didn't you show up
[1:30:06] on this time why didn't you show up on
[1:30:08] this day when Jesus is late he's still
[1:30:11] on
[1:30:13] time come on
[1:30:16] somebody
[1:30:17] hallelujah hallelujah come on Lazarus
[1:30:21] you don't realize what's coming your way
[1:30:23] but you're story ain't over you might
[1:30:25] have gone through death you might have
[1:30:27] gone through sickness but Jesus is on
[1:30:30] his
[1:30:33] way for one of his greatest
[1:30:39] Miracles what he had to do to Lazarus he
[1:30:41] had to make him
[1:30:44] Undead he had to make him new
[1:30:47] again Devon what he do to you he un
[1:30:51] hurts you by the supernatural

[1:31:08] God and we look at your
[1:31:12] life the Martins are a pillar in this
[1:31:18] church but it did not come overnight

[1:31:46] supernatural brother I'm not going to
[1:31:49] spend long right here I'm not going to
[1:31:50] be much longer at all brother maram says
[1:31:54] he said before you can be in the Hall of
[1:31:56] Fame you got to go through the Hall of
[1:31:59] critics he said before you can be in a
[1:32:02] Rapture you got to go through criticism
[1:32:04] he said they're going to say everything
[1:32:05] about you they're going to call you Holy
[1:32:08] Roller he said but if a person but if
[1:32:11] You Can Only Hold Your Position in
[1:32:12] Christ he said then someday he'll take
[1:32:16] us into the Hall of
[1:32:19] Fame you see a lot of people can't stand
[1:32:21] it they can't stand to go through that
[1:32:23] Hall
[1:32:24] critics they can't stand to go through
[1:32:26] it when anybody can enjoy being
[1:32:29] accepted but receiving
[1:32:33] rejection if you're going to go into the
[1:32:36] Hall of Fame with God you got to go
[1:32:38] through some criticism you got to go
[1:32:40] through some moments when when people
[1:32:42] don't think you're good enough when
[1:32:44] people don't look like when people look
[1:32:46] down upon you but Paul finished out the
[1:32:49] chapter of 2 Corinthians 4:17 said for
[1:32:52] our lot of fiction is but for a moment
[1:32:55] it worketh for us a far more exceeding
[1:32:58] and eternal weight of Glory while we
[1:33:00] look not of the things which are seen
[1:33:02] But at the things which are not seen for
[1:33:05] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:33:07] but the things which are not
[1:33:09] seen are
[1:33:14] Eternal you you go to watching the
[1:33:17] Chicago

[1:34:48] you'll be made well right now you see
[1:34:51] that man didn't realize what caused the
[1:34:53] ner nervousness but because of a of a
[1:34:56] prophetic word it went into the regions
[1:34:58] of his spirit and it brought out the
[1:35:00] things that was afflicting him that
[1:35:03] caused a nervousness in his
[1:35:05] Spirit Isaiah said for thus saith the
[1:35:09] high Isaiah 57- 15 for thus sayith the
[1:35:12] high and lofty one that inhabiteth
[1:35:14] eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in
[1:35:17] the high and holy place with
[1:35:21] him also that is of
[1:35:24] a
[1:35:25] contrite
[1:35:27] crushed humble Spirit to revive the
[1:35:30] spirit of the humble and to revive the
[1:35:32] heart of the contrite ones for I will
[1:35:34] not contend forever neither will I be
[1:35:36] always WTH for the spirit should fail
[1:35:38] before me and the Souls which I have
[1:35:40] made for the iniquity of his covet this
[1:35:43] was I Roth and smote him and I hid me
[1:35:46] and I was wroth and he went forwardly in

[1:35:51] ways and will heal
[1:35:54] him I will lead him also and restore
[1:35:58] Comforts unto him and to his mourners

[1:36:08] supernatural you might miss God and you
[1:36:11] might miss your

[1:36:23] roll off on somebody else when it's your

[1:41:41] take place they were very gracious but I
[1:41:43] I was I was speaking to this this
[1:41:45] individual and he was so hurt by the
[1:41:48] elders he was he was so hurt and there
[1:41:50] was some things that were said and he he
[1:41:53] he he he was just there was some things
[1:41:55] there that he he completely decided I'm
[1:41:57] giving up on the ministry I'm not going
[1:41:58] to preach no more I'm not going to do
[1:42:00] these things but in a moment it come to
[1:42:03] a spot where where they were where where
[1:42:06] they had come to a meeting and he
[1:42:08] literally said these words I forgive you
[1:42:11] and the Holy Spirit fell in that place
[1:42:13] and simply it was said that it was a
[1:42:16] supernatural element of the third pole
[1:42:19] that broke that broke the situation
[1:42:24] literally forgiveness is the key to unhe
[1:42:28] hurting and unchaining your
[1:42:31] situation you say well I want to have
[1:42:34] the faith of the third poor of Mark
[1:42:36] 11:22 of have faith in God speak to this
[1:42:39] mountain just read down and what's
[1:42:43] connected to Faith
[1:42:46] forgiveness
[1:42:48] forgiveness forgiveness if you can't
[1:42:51] forgive your brother then how can can
[1:42:53] your father forgive you how can you have
[1:42:55] Mountain Moving faith if you cannot
[1:42:58] forgive your brother or your
[1:43:01] sister I don't know if you remember this
[1:43:03] or recall this but brother Wayne Lawson
[1:43:05] stood here on July the 3 2022 and he
[1:43:08] stood here and he said he said of a poll
[1:43:12] of all the message churches that I've
[1:43:14] been to all over all over the world all
[1:43:16] over the all over the all over the US
[1:43:18] and all over the different countries
[1:43:20] that he' been in he said if you take the
[1:43:21] poll he said the most most damaging
[1:43:24] spirit in the message is the spirit of
[1:43:28] unforgiveness it's amazing when you
[1:43:30] don't allow things to let
[1:43:34] go let me say this to you let it
[1:43:39] go if you have been suffering with with
[1:43:42] thoughts of well my daddy died of this I
[1:43:46] guess I'm going to die with that or
[1:43:48] maybe you have suffered well there's
[1:43:50] cancer in my family I guess I'll have to
[1:43:53] deal with cancer I want to say this to
[1:43:55] you let it
[1:43:57] go if you have dealt with things in your
[1:44:00] past and you feel like you can't forgive
[1:44:02] yourself because of the mistakes that
[1:44:04] you fell in I want to say this to you
[1:44:07] let it
[1:44:08] go if you are living under the shadow of
[1:44:12] Satan's snare and he set a track for you
[1:44:15] William brandham said that repentance
[1:44:18] got you out of the Trap of the devil
[1:44:23] if Satan can hold you under that kind of
[1:44:26] a trap to make you think that you're
[1:44:29] still trapped all you have to do is say
[1:44:32] God I completely turn away from that
[1:44:36] which I was and you become Unchained by
[1:44:39] the
[1:44:42] anointing I want to say Let it
[1:44:45] go Let it go we got a Rapture take Let
[1:44:48] it go Let it go Let it go you may have
[1:44:52] made some mistake I want to say this to
[1:44:53] you let it go because the Book of Micah
[1:44:56] tells us that my enemy when he rises
[1:44:59] against me and he says things about me
[1:45:01] he said if I he said when I fall I will
[1:45:04] rise again it's not it's not if I fall
[1:45:07] but when I fall I will rise again and
[1:45:10] you may have failed today but get back
[1:45:12] up you need to rise with the same per
[1:45:15] per perseverance that Paul had that I am
[1:45:18] persuaded that I am persuaded that
[1:45:20] neither death nor cancer nor troubles or
[1:45:23] life are going to be able to separate me
[1:45:25] from the love of God I'm not going to
[1:45:27] let bitterness stay in my way I'm not
[1:45:30] going to let calamities I'm not going to
[1:45:32] allow the things of others stand in my
[1:45:35] way I
[1:45:37] refuse I refuse to allow the devil to
[1:45:40] bring a snare of entrapment of just a
[1:45:43] mind battle and keep me from my
[1:45:51] Liberty brother Ron I'm I'm closing with
[1:45:54] this my brother Ron was was given a
[1:46:01] word he was given a word in the midst of
[1:46:04] in the midst of his
[1:46:08] battle you have the capacity to
[1:46:12] handle or I would not have given you the
[1:46:15] battle that you're
[1:46:18] in I'm thankful that I don't have
[1:46:20] brother Ron's battle
[1:46:23] I'll be glad I I'll be honest I'm glad I
[1:46:25] don't have your battle because God knows
[1:46:28] how much you can bear and how much you
[1:46:30] can
[1:46:31] handle but he's given you a capacity to
[1:46:34] handle all of the trials of the critics
[1:46:38] of the circumstances of the chaos and
[1:46:41] you are built to rise above it
[1:46:49] all 38 years
[1:46:53] laying at a
[1:46:55] hospital 38 years of chances that had
[1:46:59] missed
[1:47:00] him he'd watched the angel
[1:47:03] move he'd been in Supernatural
[1:47:06] moments I'm going to bring it real
[1:47:08] personal and I'm I'm completely closing
[1:47:10] with this all but I I don't want the
[1:47:11] musicians just to come real quick I want
[1:47:13] you to I want you to be real attentive
[1:47:16] right here 38 years of being where the
[1:47:19] angel
[1:47:20] was 38 years why watching it come time
[1:47:24] and time watching it come weekend after
[1:47:27] weekend watching the spirit of God move
[1:47:29] on this
[1:47:31] one watching to move on that
[1:47:34] one watching the holy ghost live in
[1:47:37] them and watching them get up out of the
[1:47:40] hospital bit and go
[1:47:44] home 38 years of
[1:47:47] why 38 years of Why Not Me 38 years of
[1:47:53] am I not good
[1:47:54] enough I don't have friends to help me

[1:48:05] years and you may have been hurt you may
[1:48:08] have been broke you may have even
[1:48:11] criticized whether it really was the
[1:48:13] angel or
[1:48:16] not maybe it was
[1:48:18] some just some kind of earthquake that
[1:48:21] caused it
[1:48:23] maybe it was brother Andrew pouring out
[1:48:25] some Gatorade back there and all the
[1:48:27] people getting
[1:48:29] hyped maybe he had a conspiracy just
[1:48:32] talking to these it seems like it's
[1:48:34] always the same ones it always gets a
[1:48:41] blessing 38 years of sitting here
[1:48:44] wondering why not

[1:51:19] going to wreck you know she was always
[1:51:21] she was always looking at things like
[1:51:22] like that but you literally you you
[1:51:25] begin to think about the supernatural
[1:51:26] elements that that is involving all of
[1:51:28] your
[1:51:29] life like we're boys we're just we're
[1:51:32] just Farm boys
[1:51:34] and we just we just do stuff sometimes
[1:51:37] you just do stupid stuff don't even
[1:51:39] think about it you think I think about
[1:51:42] the times that I think about the times
[1:51:44] that me TJ and M created basically human
[1:51:48] catapults and basically flung oursel
[1:51:50] across a creek because of strapping
[1:51:53] trees and different things of that
[1:51:55] nature you imagine all the things that
[1:51:58] you've been through and you're still
[1:52:00] here that's just a natural thing but you
[1:52:03] think about all the calamities of of
[1:52:05] life and you're still here I remember
[1:52:08] one time we were tearing down some
[1:52:09] pallet racking while we was tearing down
[1:52:11] some pal Adam was there he was just a
[1:52:13] boy at the time in high school and had
[1:52:15] to get him out of school to go work

[1:52:18] boys that don't want to
[1:52:21] work I had to get him out of school cuz
[1:52:23] I needed some help and that's why he
[1:52:25] gets to work with me all the time cuz I
[1:52:26] know he ain't scared of it but we were
[1:52:28] up there tearing down some pallet racket
[1:52:31] man we didn't think one thing about it
[1:52:33] but there was aund wooden doors that was
[1:52:35] leading the Leaning the other way
[1:52:38] completely you know we're crazy but we
[1:52:39] ain't that crazy we don't do stupid
[1:52:41] stuff just because we want to be stupid
[1:52:44] but there's literally a 100 wooden doors
[1:52:46] leaning that way we're tearing down this
[1:52:49] pallet racking and all of a sudden them
[1:52:51] 100 wooden board doors come sliding this
[1:52:55] way Matthew had
[1:52:58] inches from being completely trapped by
[1:53:01] a steel eyebeam and I had I had one
[1:53:04] completely a pallet rack completely
[1:53:05] around my
[1:53:07] neck and we walk down there with a
[1:53:12] smile we made them Angels
[1:53:16] work he's working in
