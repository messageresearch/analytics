Deborah's sister so glad to see you Malachi and Chloe quite an honor to have you guys with us this morning and last night Mark and them got home at 1 21. he texted me when they got home last night I'm just glad everybody had a safe trip home after all that rain and darkness and sure can't pick the weather but we're glad to get a little rain not too much rain amen we're glad to get that glad they were able to be here in the meeting and so glad to have your dad with us each and every one of you have baptism later after service after the preaching of the word but we have a baby baby dedication morning and I was thinking brother Nathan what a masterpiece of a sermon boy he did his he did his church proud and so Amen brother Wayne and brother Ray would be very thrilled with brother Samuel would be very thrilled with that message and and glad they could stay over this morning to be with us and and uh if you notice I'm about half his size and so that's why this desk is a little shorter so he was reaching down and I'm reaching up so somewhere you have a medium so amen I preached that Joshua commission for all of these years and I heard it last night and I thought you know what a balance of the scriptures what a balance of the word and I so loved it with all my heart and so many incredible notes if you didn't get to listen to it go back and listen to it again I'm sure you're like myself you'll listen to it and and you'll catch something you didn't hear and then we always enjoy brother Andrew's gift because that's how we water the word the spirit of the Lord just comes down and amen's the word after it's over with and many of you were blessed in a supernatural way and and you begin to Worship the Lord and just getting in the spirit and so we thank you we we thank you Andrew we thank you brother Nathan we certainly enjoyed it with all of our hearts and and so glad that Mark and them made it home so glad you guys stayed over amen and this morning we have a baby dedication we're really thrilled but I was thinking brother Nathan's going to think that what we do is dedicate babies here every service and that'd be fine too it's scriptural husbands love your wives and so and so we're so glad to have brother Hunter family with us and so glad you guys are here and I was looking over this morning that Ada one of the origins is a Germanic the element of Adele meaning nobility for example as a part of the names of adley or Adeline and we have a grand we have a grand baby named Adeline and the name can also Trace to be a Hebrew origin sometimes spelled a d h a h meaning adornment and I thought of how special we're going to have a baby dedication and in a few moments I'm going to preach to you on changing your garment amen gray I I've laughed a lot and so I'm reading this before you guys get here gray is after her grandmother great-grandmother Dorothy Gray Simpson grandmother Grandpa Simpson is 94 full of spunk and are key to a long life is being stubborn I know some people that'll live forever and if you ever mix temper with stubbornness you know what I'm talking about that's why we needed a clothing change and so amen my grandmother just to put this here my grandmother on my mother's side was I think her middle name was stubborn and I'll just give you a first example if she would get a little tiff with you she wouldn't speak to you living in the same house eating at the same table having bedrooms right near each other and I lived with her for a few years and she could go for weeks without acknowledging you were in the room and somewhere she'd get over it because you wasn't going to help it somewhere she'd get over it but when she got a new birth she she became a real lady she lost some of the stubbornness but not all of it so amen God bless you brother Hunter and sister Katie all your families if you'll come with us today and amen we're so glad to have you with us and this is such an extreme honor for all of us Hallelujah amen God bless you this is my first sighting so you're beautiful Hallelujah come on up here Grandpa Grandma come on come on up yeah we're so glad to have you guys with us how nice to me nice to see you I'll shake all of your hands in a minute but thank you and thank you sorry about the loss of your father yes today we come to the baby dedication and we never want to take these things for granted come on around here brother Vernon sister Kathy you look good in that pink as we realize it's a very important event it was important with Jesus he would take time to dedicate children and he would remind the disciples when they would ask him who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and he said except you becomes a little child you'll not enter the scripture is very specific about how that when Jesus was dedicated and is circumcised as well and even as brother Branham would have long meetings as we talked last night he would have long meetings but yet in front of it we may dedicate eight ten children and he found it was extremely important I find it's extremely important because as God gives us a child and as we thought about it we stood here not long ago and you guys said I do and it was a beautiful wedding but now too become one and a beautiful child and you know Satan gets in the details and he wants to make us sick gives us some Terror as we come to the thought but today we can stand and say a miracle took place he's watched over your lives to have become one two families become one the scripture tells us hear o Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and these Commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts and impress them upon your children and talk about them when you sit down at home walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up he's in our conversation he's in her life he's to be left first Samuel chapter 1 and verse 27. I prayed for this child and the Lord granted me what I ask of him and so now I give him to the Lord for this whole life he will be given over to the Lord and he worshiped the Lord then God gave us a sacred charge because life is a miracle this Baby's a miracle from the Lamb's Book of Life God thought of us before the foundation of the world now all your thoughts of what will it be like to be a daddy how will I love him how will I love her and how will I be a good mom all that mystery is now revealed she's the boss she tells you when to get up and when to go to sleep and you know she doesn't know what a clock is and she doesn't know anything but I'm hungry and I'm wet but God's going to watch over her because you're given her back to him God gave her to you and now you give her back to him now you'll watch over her with the best of your ability you'll take care of her she'll be sick and you're what do I do and you'll ask the Lord can he come in a room and touch her and maybe even while you're praying you'll feel that fevered brow just go away maybe a earache or toothaches isn't God good that you don't don't have earaches like that when you're grown or you break through teeth when you're this age but God has gave them to you and what a special event that today we can dedicate her back to the Lord and God made us a promise that he'll watch over her and he'll protect her what a beautiful name what a beautiful man Hallelujah isn't she beautiful Hallelujah Miss Ada hello you're going to hear me a whole lot in life but I'll always be here with you and if I'm not the Lord Jesus will be now I'm going to dedicate you to the Lord someday you'll look back at it and say that's my pictures I was there Heavenly Father what a great God that you are now Lord Jesus we thank you for the Miracle of Life the miracle of a healthy baby the miracle that you watch over even while we're in the womb Lord Jesus we actually have to be pushed into this life but Lord we are the physical manifestation of your thoughts from the for the foundation of the world now if you thought of us you'll protect us now Lord Jesus I ask you to bless this family ask you to bless them with an atmosphere that she'll grow up in the fear and the admonition of the Lord Lord what a beautiful thing that this is today Miss Ada Gray now as they have placed her into my arms I place her into your hands now father you can watch over her when we're asleep you can watch over her when our eyes can't see our hands can't handle but may you dispatch an angel stand by her side take care of her now Lord Jesus as we dedicate her and thank you for her we ask you that you'd keep her and guide her bless this family bless this home Lord May no danger come by their way help them and may this family now realize they have become one inside of her in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen any man any man amen picture time come on up here we'll get one with you guys and then all right look at there come Frazier we'll get the frasers first amen amen now lorian you're responsible before God to spoil her you are responsible to spoiling her yeah I smelt the wind the other day come by my house and I said

chemo could we sing a verse in a course of down from his glory and Andrew if you'll help us let's stand to our feet down from his glory [Music] [Music] oh my God [Music] [Music] let's sing it with all

[Music] [Music] before the great grace [Music] Hallelujah I think that's such a special song that's such an atmosphere amen if you'll turn with me in your scriptures today to John chapter 14. thank you for your patience with us and isn't God just incredible I'd like to speak to you on the changing of a garment so good to have brother Donnie here so thrilled to have him so many emotions goes with all of that and what a war he's been in and is in and brother Donnie and he needs that you have during this service you please let us know amen cancer is a vicious but battle sometimes the Cure is worse than the disease and so amen Saint John chapter 14 and verse 1. let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house there are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way that you know and Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus saith unto him I am the way he didn't say I'm one of the ways I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him and Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and Jesus saith unto him have not I been so long time with you and yet you have not known me Philip and he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father might be glorified in the son and if you ask anything in my name I will do it amen you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word you might think by her opening scriptures that were having a funeral here kind of opposite First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 35 I found it's interesting that these are the last scriptures that brother Nathan dealt with last night in First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 35 Paul is speaking of our body change actually from one body to another body that's what Jesus is talking about I go to prepare a place for you you're not going to live in that that body that body's got to be changed that body's got to get that's got sin in it you're born again but that flesh has got to go back to the Earth the spirit's got to go back but the Soul on the inside of you that's the gene seed of God and it's got an eternal and let me let me just say this to you and this is not a harsh statement but let me just say this to you either you've got God living on the inside of you or you've got the enemy living on the inside of you there's not a fence there's not a middle ground here there you know it's either black or it's white it's either right or it's wrong you're either a sinner or you're a Christian and so your influence from one realm or another Realm and Paul is saying here but some some men will say how are the dead raised up and and with what body do they come quite a question huh thou fu that was that that would that thou sowest is not quick and accepted die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that the body shall be but bear grain that it might chance of weed or some other grain but God giveth it a body as it has pleased him and to every seed his own body verse 50. now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God in heaven there's not going to be any sin you can I can spend an hour on what's not going to be in heaven according to the scriptures fornicators adulterers robbers thiefs murderers they're not going to be in heaven what a place not going to be a newspaper for you to have to read about the top 10 uh horrible events that happened are you with me now behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment and the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruption no matter how much you pamper it no matter how much that you put perfume on it no matter what a nice dress or what a nice suit that you put on it no matter how you comb the hair it's a dying flesh are you with me now we need a body change but this corruptable must put on incorruption to where no cells in the body die quite a statement isn't it and and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory now Paul writes some incredible words oh death where is thy stink oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which give us thus victory through our Lord Jesus Christ now if I can just share a few things with you Jesus had a friend that was getting sicker and sicker and sicker we know the story is lazarus's resurrection and when Jesus comes in verse 38 of John chapter 11. and Jesus therefore groaning in himself cometh to the grave and it was a cave and a stone lay upon it and Jesus said take ye away the stone Jesus could have spoke the stone he spoke to winds he spoke to water and it became wine but he was challenging their faith in the resurrection sometimes he challenges your face he challenges you to make a move are you with me now take you away the stone listen these two sisters you would you would if you were standing there and you as a Critic of Jesus on this day and you were thinking well why don't he move the stone that's a heavy Stone they've sealed the stone why don't he move the stone he's asking you do you really believe because once you put your hands on the stone then you're identified with him once you put your work yourself in the word then you're identified with the word all its shame all its Glory are you with me now and they roll the stone away now remember the scripture said maybe you was a maybe you as a child you when they would ask you to quote a scripture memorize a scripture I memorized it pretty well Jesus wept Jesus wept not just because of people's unbelief but Jesus wept because he had to call Lazarus from where he was back to where he was going to be because Lazarus was not he was not in a situation to where he was going to step into that body and be there forever and when he came back immediately immediately he would have to fight the same enemy all over again that sickness that came on him and took him to death he'd be healed of that sickness and when Jesus called him by name Lazarus come forth no doubt he was fellowshipping with the Saints in Abraham's bosom and he was maybe talking about what the Messiah was and maybe how that they fell a ship together the Miracles that they had seen listen everything that you prophesied about Joseph everything that you prophesied about Abraham everything that you prophesied throughout the prophets Jeremiah nahu of all of them prophesied Isaac Isaiah everything that you prophesied I've got the opportunity to set in these meetings I've got the opportunity to sit at the table with him I've got the opportunity to be with him he's got and he's either God or is the greatest deceiver that's has ever been I I've witnessed him I've witnessed him not only say be healed but I've saw the results of it a lot of people make promises no results a lot of people say things no results but when he said to the water to the wine there was results best wine when he prayed over Fish and Loaves I'll tell you we fed 5 000 people not counting children and at the end of it we took up 12. you're talking about our testimony service in Abraham's bosom all of them were waiting on the resurrection they were they had died but there was a promise through job that there was going to come a resurrection even in Psalms 22 David writes under inspiration I'll not suffer mine Holy One to see corruption so this Messiah Will Conquer death hell and the grave and I'm sure he was telling them listen he's the one that will conquer death he's the one that will bring Resurrection now he calls him by name brother Brandon said had he not called him by name there would have been a general Resurrection because he was the resurrection now he's causing Lazarus come forth listen he had no choice he heard his name how far away it is it's obviously not far away and he heard his name and from those regions he come walking out of the grave now Lazarus was a poor man now the rich people they would do a lot of decorating to the Bible they do a lot of things to the body it and they do a lot of things that would you know when they were buried they'd put them in Royal clothes and all different kind of things but Lazarus is Poor Man so they put him in rags and they wrapped those rags and they would wrap it around the whole body they'd wrap it around the the head they'd wrap it over his eyes and his mouth and wrap it around his feet then they would anoint him with certain ointments for its death to keep down the stench and they would anoint for certain purposes all over him and I want you to just notice what Jesus gives them a commission take off his grave clothes he's not going to need them anymore so he needed a garment change cause you can't live in grave clothes that's why me and you need to be born again because you can't live in them dead clothes any longer once you meet Jesus take off them all rags take off those all ways of doing things the old man has to die with the sin and the new man comes to life I've always thought this incredible absolutely incredible in John chapter 12. it says then then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was with was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made a Hymn of supper and Martha served but lassus was one of them that that sat at the table with him and then took Mary a pound of ointment of spagnard and very costly and Anointed with the feet of Jesus and wiped his wiped his feet with her hair and and the and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment and then set one of the disciples Judas is a carrot Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 Pence and given to the poor Hallelujah there's always one of them this say he because he cared not for the poor because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein then Jesus said let her alone against the day of my burying has she kept this for the poor always ye have with you but me you have not always pretty powerful much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for Jesus's sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priest notice these words but the chief priest consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death what a stupid bunch you know this probably caused great fear to come on Lazarus oh they're going to put me to death I was just there a couple days ago not such a bad place for a Christian it's not no bad place we Satan can't touch us no more we can never get no more sick because that by reason that maybe the Jews went away and believe Jesus so they didn't believe in that denominational nonsense anymore they can't do what they say they can do but this Jesus can raise people to life he can not only feed five thousand he could not only heal the sick but he purposely went away from his best friend and let him die are you with me now I knew it was everything and he said he's only asleep but I'm going to go wake him because I am the resurrection and I am the life I like that don't you now you say well brother Ron but you know you've only pointed out a couple of examples of of a garment change well let's just talk about our this fleshly garment just for a few moments if you'll remember in Melchizedek when he came to Abraham and Sarah being a hundred years old and 90 years old they could not have children though that the promise was was there that he would have a child through Sarah and it was given by God but in that garment they couldn't produce that child catch that in that garment they couldn't produce a child but God was going to give them a garment change and and we through the Seven Seals it is caught because listen theologians for thousands of years and missed it and I've even asked I've even asked different theologians well what was the great mystery of of of Genesis with Abraham and Sarah and you know they'll they'll they'll they'll talk about you know them old people having a child but the mystery of it was that they God changed their body God changed their body and if you remember he changes their name which changes their nature and for you to produce the word he's got to change your nature because he can't have you who you was and remember God don't look at who you was he looks at what you're going to be [Applause] as I preached to you the other day God didn't come down and talk to job on the element of where he was he presented him where he was before the foundation of the world and then presented him who he was going to be so God don't look at your physical friend and your failures and your mistakes he looks through the blood of Jesus Christ and she's your potentials of what you are going to be are you with me now now now notice now notice when the king when they go down to the Heathen King they get out of the will of God as long as they stay in that place where God has given them there everything's going to be provided but let a little pressure come and they move down to where amelage the king is and I'm gonna spend long here but can you really through your common sense see Sarah an old woman and all of the women of the of his Nation it was a vast Empire huge Empire and he picks an old woman to be his wife I don't think so brother man said she was the most beautiful woman on the earth this is when God does a job he does it really well I I don't know what the neighbors talked about the day today what is and you said we're brother on I never heard it put like this well just stick around you're going to see it because God's going to change some bodies around here well brother Ron I don't believe it well it's okay you're not going to change my mind on the situation can you imagine living next door to Abraham and Abraham goes in one night and he's got his got his Cane and he's just struggling his way in and Sarah comes off of the porch and she's just struggling we're going to have a child we're going to have a child maybe the last words in the tent we're going to have a child ammo folkies but if you'd have been standing at your picket fence the next morning it's going to be kind of like your neighbors that they don't want nothing to do with the message they think it's just a corner they think it's this or that well they may be standing looking over the picket fence the next morning on the change day and you walked into your house know how [Applause] gray-headed out of shape I wouldn't Point At You and the next morning you walk out and you look about like you did at 20 years old you'd have wished you to believe the message now and say well brother on that was Abraham and Sarah that's an old story well I've just read to you about Jesus and and Lazarus and when Lazarus came out of the grave and then when Jesus he goes in and he's beaten like no other human being that's ever been beaten he's wrapped incredible scars on him and and those disciples saw him and and they and they put the the robe on him and they put him in the Tomb but when he comes back out of that tomb before corruption could set in God's Great in details before corruption could set in and if you remember Jesus has asked these girls come anoint my body and they do that in a certain hour that they do they come to anoint that body and Jesus knew I got to have some witnesses I gotta have some witnesses at the tomb when I get up they need to see that I'm gone and so when when the they come and and Mary is standing there married that had been possessed with demons listen I think it's incredible that God uses her as a witness of all of the religious people he has her to be a witness of his resurrection and Jesus is countenance His Garment is so changed until she doesn't recognize him in that condition and he calls her by name and when he calls her by name she recognizes him by his voice now that's not the only occurrence two men on the are on the road to Emmaus they're discouraged a lot of things have happened but they're on the road to Emmaus and they're very discouraged by the things that have happened the Messiah that they have believed for has been took to jury has been condemned to die and they beat him like no other human being and now he's is the scripture said cursed is the man that hangeth on a tree and these allowed himself to be hung on a tree and thornsby and his brow and to be hung naked and then while there he forgives them because remember these men aren't born again and they've got hatred in their heart they got extreme prejudice in their heart and listen they need a garment change but Jesus forgives them because they know not what they do listen it was his purpose to come to the Earth to die that was his mission he'll save deliver but Jesus is first coming was to die for me and you because me and you were born under sin under Adam when God told them don't touch that tree when they touch that tree they found themselves naked and now what they did God would come every day to them but now they put clothes on themselves and they put an apparel on them hiding their nakedness that won't work with God just any kind of religion won't work with God God came through the garden may we say he came running through the garden them animal Where Art Thou man always hides when he's in sin many people want forgiveness after they got caught or they feel bad after they got caught but let me just say this to you God came to them he had a purpose for Adam and Eve and Adam had placed his seed on the inside of her so God couldn't kill her either now remember God clothed them now let me just say this to you those fig leaves wouldn't work those fig leaves wouldn't work that wouldn't cover sin it would take blood to cover your sins so God took skins of of animals and wrapped around them and then the rapping he gave them a new apparel or a new garment to wear out let me just say down through time men have always come to a spot to reject God's apparel to reject God's message they rejected Noah they rejected Moses they rejected Elijah they rejected Jesus they're those religious people was in their garments and Jesus looked at their garments as filthy rats why did sepulchers call them devils their garment wasn't good enough no wonder they hated Jesus because here he had prostitutes Tax Collectors doctors he had people that was with him that they were disdained in society and Jesus called it his church when Jesus came to Legion and he cast off His Garment and those demons left and they actually negotiated with Jesus send us somewhere did thou cometh to torment us before our time they knew that Jesus listen those demons recognize who he was and there was those priests that couldn't recognize standing in their garments that they'd had for hundreds of years they're making fun call him a devil but those demons recognize who he was now watch him they negotiated to go live in pigs you talking about Jewish Society hating pigs but these demons wanted to go live in those picks now what you just think about this just for a moment those pigs refused to live with them demons those pigs had more sense than a lot of people and they cast themselves half of a cliff not what did the leaders of the the city do they come out and they should have rejoiced you set a man free and he can go home and live with his family listen if you guys wanted to come to church come to church your amens are wonderful I preached for 25 minutes waiting on you to get with me but listen let me just say this to you when Jesus was standing there he had delivered a man listen when you come to service how important is a service how important is a moment with Jesus I just shared this with a few this week when I was a little boy when there was a special service going on you know that's why I think Life Ministry is so important if I could sit on the front row I wanted to feel what that preacher's feeling if there's a miracle happened I wanted to see it it was a move of God I wanted to be a part of it can you imagine being real close to Jesus I wouldn't want it to be I'm sorry I wouldn't want to be on the back road looking at everybody else's head and who goes to the bathroom and what child's crying and who ain't here what you got on sorry brother on this is where I sit because I got to go to the bathroom so much well I just wonder if you get a baseball ticket at the top of the stadium it's good anyway and not only goes for here it goes for everybody in the world helping pastors right there if I was in brother Brown I was meeting I I'd want to sit as close as I could sit I want to be right there where is that when I was a young convert sister Kanye and I went to a church near Hickory I was young convert we're just about just a couple of months married and I still need more of Jesus at that point when I go in it's been this way forever I go in they think I'm a grown man they think she's a child they send her to the Sunday school class and I walk in and I get a seat about where you're at Isaac and I'm sitting there and I'm telling this for a reason you used to sit back there but something moved you here and so I'm sitting there and I've heard about this Ed biscal and I'd heard him in 1978 describe experiences with with William Branham and I remember what that was all about and how much I enjoyed that well I'm thinking brother Ed's an older man and you know he comes walking on he's bouncing across the platform he looks like a boy even even at that age and he he comes and he preaches on the the breach and there had to come there had to come a time between the church ages where God wouldn't deal with the church ages anymore but he's going to deal with the bride of Jesus Christ and it was more than a man that could do that and he's preaching and he's preaching right to me and I'm thinking I'm the only one in the church well I walk out of that service feeling like I'm standing on cloud nine I'm just glad everybody else that came to church to be with me while I was having a moment are you with me and so I was just sitting there I was just absorbing everything and I wanted to get what he was saying because even in my early I wanted to catch what did God deal with this preacher for weeks to inspire him to preach to me what I need because God can speak to 300 500 people and talk to you on a level maybe one sentence one paragraph will come right to you and deal with you that's our God [Applause] how important is that brother Ron a few weeks ago I was preaching here and there was somebody that was being very resistant to the word and as they were being very resistant to the word I picked it up and I actually cautioned this audience you know stick with me don't resist it don't resist it and the resistance just went on and went on and went on now the fortune of God's allowed me to be a gentleman I didn't call their name but sometimes we think well I can resist and get by with it what if you'd have resisted with Jesus now what will that do for you brother Ron I will realize that that girl is not a believer and so I realized that she's taken a stance against the word of God and her one service and her spirit and attitude sprung out against it you said well brother Ron I can get through a service and I can get to it and I I just I don't believe it but when you may not believe it but if you will set with the right attitude one day God might open your heart [Applause] laughs I'm going to need a scriptural principle for that Jesus was at his Ascension 500 people was there they were seeing him in that body the changed garment 500 people was there and Jesus asked them to do the further part to go to the upper room and there you'll be endued with power from on high now remember he'd already told him in previous scripture I got to go away it's actually expedient that I go away but I'm going to send the comforter and he's going to come and live inside of you Peter because you got to get rid of your temper you are the one that cut the ear off I got to change that I can't have the woman at the well being the same woman anymore even Mary that birth Jesus Christ you got to go to the upper room listen to it about who your name is that doesn't matter whatsoever you got to be born again [Music] now Jesus tells in the scriptures he said there was a king and this King had a son that was going to be married and he and he sent out servants to go get people to come and people gave excuses Jesus tell him more than just a story here people are going to have choices in life and they're going to take choices that are temporary over the Eternal Word don't take a temporary job or temporary wrong relationship over an eternal word of God don't take a temporary feeling that's why we ask you to pray before you come to church why pray because we all get the wrong Spirit on us you don't mean to but you get the wrong spirit something just gets a hold of you and you get the wrong attitude you're good people as a pastor I gotta I gotta look past your attitude I gotta look past your disposition I gotta look past a lot of things because you're going to have bad days some of you are obviously going to have some bad nights because you're going to walk in here scrunch down some of you obviously get incredible texts from somebody listen when I'm using my phone I'm checking my sugar and yeah sometimes I'm not sweet enough and sometimes I'm way too sweet but there's nothing on that phone more important than what God's getting ready to say to us what happens in the upper room 380 people had something better to do you know we'll be standing there at the Judgment listen to 380 people that had the opportunity to go to the upper room and they missed their experience of deity coming in human flesh they might have even missed Peter preaching the inauguration sermon this Jesus whom you crucified God has made him Lord and Christ many people that that hadn't had privy to it they began to respond what shall we do to be saved we wasn't in the upper room but can we have what you got and he said repent every one of you repent every one of you don't don't sign your name on a book repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of of your sins and you shall re you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children as many as are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call God how many has ever been sick and so happened that night we had the phenomenal service and then you hear somebody say most greatest service I've ever been in my life and then they try to explain it to you you can't feel what they're talking about now those 380 heard what happened there's not a good enough excuse anywhere to miss the upper room now I want to say this to you don't come here for decades and miss your personal experience with Jesus Christ right don't miss your garment change I I'm trying to bring this very Elementary to you today Jesus also tells another parable about the upper going to the to the wedding supper and if you're invited the reason there are robes at the wedding supper brother Brown points this out it was according to Oriental Customs that everybody at the wedding would get the same rope rich or poor whether you was in The Who's Who whether your name King priest or even nomad all got the same garment nobody's better than anybody else it takes the same blood of Jesus Christ for every one of us for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God so we all need the blood we all need the new birth foreign and the Garment is the Holy Ghost because in your natural being just being justified you'll only be a carnal believer you'll only be a carnal believer has a carnal believer look at it too long a service we got dinner pot roast it's a sunny day we could have a picnic rains over we could have a picnic what's more important than this it's carnal believer you'll think the preachers preaching right at you every service well he is always when he points his finger when he points that finger he's a little short guy but when he points that thing have you noticed he's always pointing at me have you noticed he avoids me don't shake my hand if you notice I don't check a lot of people's head there's a reason we don't have time for that today I have zero immunity in my bloodstream I try to stay away from sickness that's why I tell you tell to turn to your neighbor say brother Ron loves you I hope you do that then I hope you believe it then sanctified you clean out you clean out you clean up you clean out you get all the cleanness out of your life and you get all the sin out of your life and you put away this you put away that and you put away that but if you live in that condition you'll always be a legalist you'll always be illegal as well that one ain't doing this and that ain't doing that and that ain't doing that and that ain't doing that nothing ain't doing that and that ain't doing nothing ain't doing nothing ain't doing nothing ain't doing nothing you're getting it I ain't doing that now and they don't have nothing I want to become it's like a cactus and you become like a cactus where you get fussy and Punchy all the time and you can't live good enough for God you're all the time reading 14 different chapters in the Bible I gotta do better I gotta do better I gotta fast I can't eat donuts I can't but if you can ever get full of the Holy Ghost you can ever get full of God where you're going to change this on me where you put on a new robe word ain't no longer you living and you trying to live but God living on the inside of you Hallelujah Hallelujah then when you get the Holy Ghost Just Breathe just relax just lay in the presence of the sun just eat the word let it live [Applause] the Holy Ghost is a seal God says God says I could live inside of that you're no longer a drunk you're no longer a lot of things but I can live on the inside of that God says I approve [Music] now we've had some weddings here and I've said this before but I want to say it again and there's a reason why that I'm preaching this this sermon two events I want to tell you you remember when we first started this journey and and it was so bleak I dreamed that we went to a meeting and we had a specific seat now you're going to know why I said certain things and we had a specific seats that we set we didn't know who the speaker was going to be but brother Brennan was a speaker you have to forgive me it's in my nature if I go to an auction I look for things that are worth so much more than what they're going to be valued for foreign I hope to live long enough these guys don't have to have an auction but but I bought a lot of stuff that's worth incredible value I bought some stuff that's junk and sister Connie expressed to me the other day she said now if I you know I I told her I said I try to be so good she said well if I could change anything I get you to quit auctioning well that's kind of like quit breathing because you know I see something inside of you when you walk in this building um if I can take a cabin and make a mansion out of it not that the cabin wasn't good enough we loved it but there was something on the inside of me I'd walk out and say I'm going to build a I'm going to build a room Terry I want the ceiling to be 25 feet high and brother Ray said this is how we can get it done yeah and so when I walk into my living room I ceilings 25 feet high I didn't need it that way but that was on the inside of me and then it would be attached to my office I'm taking your tour through my house it'd be attached to my office man cave Connie could put her stuff here that's mine my goodies are in there some of you been there you've seen my goodies you like you like them yeah I got paintings in there and I I I'm not going to tell the world everything but I'd like to buy paintings that are worth a certain value and they're the original Edition and they're signed either on the front or on the back and in a few years they're worth multiple times what they're worth and then I get letters where you sell this painting will you sell this painting we'll give you four times what it's worth no I'm not going to give the paintings that you gave to me back to you unless you really need it so I see value who put that inside of me and God looks at you you're a mess Jay you are a stinking mess steak and mess but God rich in Mercy sees the prince like was in your grandfather and I could see that you won't be a little boy forever or a big boy forever but you'll be a man you'll be a pillar of the church you'll get a body change are you with me now let me just say this you a guy that has that kind of vision never give up on you [Applause] he'll never give up on you Roman why didn't you give up on me I didn't see you how you were I see what you're going to be Hallelujah Hallelujah and listen if you fall and make mistakes and everybody in the neighborhood's talking about you if I saw the vision of your future I'll never throw a rock at you I'll never throw a rock at you why should I throw a rock at you when I know one of these days there's going to be a garment change thank you Hallelujah [Applause] I need a chair just for a real quick exhibit I'm not going to be much longer I just need a chair I gotta drive a point and it needs to be visual foreign [Applause] okay back in the olden days if you was in a legalist Church and you want to stay in church they'd set a chair out and you repent 14 different times I ain't gonna do that no more I ain't gonna do it no more but if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you're gonna keep doing it and then they tell you you can't come back to church no more you can't come back to church no more you can't come back to church no more well how are you going to help them don't give up on your kids preach with me now don't give up on your kids I'm not going to give up on them I'm going to tell you that I'm not giving up on him I have preached to you for a long time and told you don't come here expecting to get beat because God don't beat his wife a relationship that's always getting beat ain't a really good relationship if you're scared your husband is going to come home and whoop you it's not love and if you're living in a relationship pay attention here if you're living in a relationship where your husband is abuser or your wife naturally you ain't gonna go tell nobody your wife beats me up all the time ain't nobody going to work and said my wife beat me up last night it takes care of that big bad boy image none of us want to walk into this church oh God I'm going to get beat all over the place no no no it's not but I'm going to motivate you you don't have to stay where you're at you don't have to stay there you can have a personal Revival inside of your heart that guy right there lived with me for a year and a lot of dirt on him but I knew if I could get him close enough to the water he'd get a bath [Applause] that's what some people need a good bath you can smell them 14 feet away they need a bath how do I drop the hit that they need a bath give them a bar of soap for their birthday they stink real bad get them a whole bottle of Dawn dishwashing detergent listen if you get that next week for your birthday don't blame me ah now God's going to give you a robe before I go there how far does your love extend brother Ron to the Unseen audience to the Unseen audience now you want that to be made personal what about brother Donny's family that's in Germany his children that's in Germany whether you know this or believe this I pray for his children and I've never seen them I've never seen a picture of them but because of who he is and who his daddy was they have the potential to be real believers so brother Donnie I want to tell you this I never give up on them either you never heard that from me but there you are foreign can you give me just a few more minutes brother Brown was at a spot to where he felt like he was going to give up his wife and died his baby had died watch his baby go in such pain it would go cross-eyed and it was then the devil would come to him Satan always comes in really tough spots God don't love you God don't care for you he was a man he actually tried to commit suicide twice he's a tough spot he was down praying it was just honest with us he was down praying he said I felt like I was going to give up and paraphrase here just for a little bit why are you going to do that brother on I have double vision so bad I can't read so that's where I'm at so so brother Branham was down praying and when he was down praying he was at a spot to where he had battled the devil to where he felt like I'm gonna give up I can't hold on so God knows what to give you at the right time and I finish with this and when he was praying he went to sleep I don't know if you've ever did that but I did that brother Brown dreams he's a prophet so his dream and his vision operates like sometimes it's in symbol form and he's walking down a path I'm not going to give you the whole dream but he's walking down the path and goes by an old broken will and he walks and he walks past a lady a young lady standing there beauty of her youth just a beautiful girl and he actually greets her hello lady he greets her and she says hello Daddy that girl had had a change of garment interchange of garment she'd winners from a cross-eyed baby to a lady standing in a body that would never feel sickness ever again but here's what I want to drop to you the moment that you step from this body to that body you know everything you know who's your enemy and who's not you know God's plan for you notice what she does she talks to her him in that Eternal realm it says on Earth I was your baby Sharon Rose he needed to hear that and she begins to talk to him in in a different quote brother Branham actually says that she said this is what you taught in your ministry this is what you taught two years old she never heard any sermons that would deal with that but in that Realm she knew even things that he would preach in 1965. all right listen when my mom was laying there in that bed and you and I the night before God spoke to me get to your mom get to your mom we were sitting and letting out sister Nancy get to your mom and God spoke to me get to your mom we had Services the next evening which service is on Sunday get to your mom listen mom had had incredible conversation the night before she told Dad to go to service he needed it and so the next morning I go and on my way brother Tim Pruitt calls me and they tell they tell they'll get a call from the hospital she's dying get here as fast as you can brother Tim Pruitt reminds me of a dream that we were at a great convention and at that great convention brother Timothy Pruitt preaches I am the resurrection and the life then brother temp for it comes and he said we have a special guest brother Ron Spencer that's here and then he announces his title oh thou suffering stand and be healed my brother Tim calls me that morning and he says brother Ron your dream is getting ready to come to pass your mom's going to get up out of that body and she's going to get a brand new body this morning we walk into doctors meet us in the hall tell us the severity of the situation hard Heart's Not the word we walked in there's multitudes of people working on her and she talks to us like she's we're going to talk all day she's very coherent she's very much in control she's very much talking asking how the grandkids were asking how everybody else was and it told us how much she loved us the doctor came over to her and said she doesn't want us to do anything for her we can try to help her but she doesn't want us to do anything and and the doctor walked over and give her the report again and she said it's okay I'm ready to go and like a light switch she moved she moved from that body to a brand new body now I want to finish with this my mom's an old woman anymore my mom don't weigh 268 pounds there listen she was never ashamed of being overweight she could dance she could Shout she could praise the Lord she did it right here actually sitting right here she shouted she had bad news she'd been a cheerleader in her life she was a beautiful woman as a young child sure I'd say that about my mama but she was to her age I always like to look at pictures five years old 10 years old 20 years old 30 years old you know you're always pleased to look at pictures you were 50 pounds heavier now look at you today you know I'm telling you truth and you go you compare one another how do I look different you know and then you know there was a time that you was redheaded and now you're gray-headed where did I start getting gray and you go through phases of Life yeah it'll happen to you too and you'll go through phases of Life there was a time that I was preaching to you younger than what you are now and so you you go through phases of life but when you come to the end this ain't the end this ain't the end and that's why Jesus said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me I go to prepare you a house and it's not brick and mortar and Stone we could talk about going beyond the curtain of time and what did he see one night I had a dream and now I come to my complete close and I'm dreaming that I'm walking down the road with one of my precious friends as a minister much older always been kind of like a mentor to me like a father and I'm walking down the road with him very distinctive it's two angels walking with each of us and we're walking down a path and in this path we're having conversation about things that we're enjoying about the word we're enjoying one another's company and I remember I can remember what story it was telling me and I'm not going to tell that because you would know who who I'm talking about and I don't want it to to be told and so anyways telling me about a story and about a certain time brother Nathan he comes to a spot and the angel tells him it's time to change your clothes and I I stop and look at how he's dressed what he looks like and in just a moment he's got the most radiant clothes I've ever seen and he looks like a young man and I remember these words how do I look brother Ryan and the dream ends hugging one another you had two precious friends in your church and I walk on the platform and I step up on the platform and I walked past and I speak to one of them and I stand there and I said you know we're we're an audience sitting here together but will never be the same way that we are we have this service let's grab every bit of our this moment while the Lord's with us let's grab it and I begin to talk about even my situation I may not be able to speak to them ever again you never know we don't know the end of life circle I said but there's someone even sitting here that won't be here the next time that I'm here week that week just a few days the house explodes how it was Charlie 21 22 years old how is his wife about the same age and you think what a horrible tragedy but if you look at the human element you would think how horrible is that event to take place but he was sitting there and the Lord was letting us know given us Grace It won't always be like this but I've got a house for you and all you'll do is change clothes Charlie the explosion takes place and in seconds you're in a new body oh you can Relish in the in the horror of the look at it in God's eyes I got a house for you I've got a garment for you now it's your turn you remember when I came here and I told I told Brother William that's not here this morning I said William Jesus is coming to your house because I saw a vision that morning of Wesley who could not walk with a generational issue you see he was wearing one garment but he didn't have to stay there one service changed his life and the vision said go down and pick him up and I even asked the Lord God he won't let me pick him up he won't let nobody else pick him up how many of you remember that and I went down and picked him up and I walked back to the back of the building and then I walked back up and I gave him to William and prayed for him it wasn't instantaneous it was not instantaneous but they actually videoed him and when they videoed him what six months maybe a little bit longer that boy's running all over the house he needed a garment change now if you need any kind of illustration today I'm going to give you one because not all services are alike there's a little girl that needs a garment change come on baby we're gonna go for a walk yeah bring her too where's Randy Alden Alden come you I want somebody to walk with me come on baby because you'll need to bring her back okay okay we're going good we're going to take a walk come on now here's what I want you to do I want you to make a log book she's going to start talking won't be instantaneous but God's going to change your garments ready how's the wrong way you're doing I'm telling the devil God's getting ready to give his little girl A Miracle of Miracles he gave me a ring yesterday so I'm going to get our garment changed too the chemo that I take every morning that makes me sick doubles my vision it ain't no play it hits good sales and it eats bad sales the chemo that I'll take after this service is over about 30 pills a day thank God
