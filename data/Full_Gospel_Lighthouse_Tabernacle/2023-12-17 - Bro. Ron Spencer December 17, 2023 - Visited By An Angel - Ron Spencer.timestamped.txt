[42:05] amen I'd like to speak to you visited by
[42:08] an Angel Today and Not only was Mary
[42:11] visited by an Angel but we all have been
[42:15] amen we all have been the angel of this
[42:19] day visited our homes and our lives and
[42:23] we have been Touched by an Angel Luke
[42:26] chapter one 1 and verse
[42:28] 26 and in the sixth month the angel
[42:31] Gabriel was sent from God under the city
[42:35] of Galilee named
[42:38] nazarus and the and we all know that
[42:42] nothing good can come out of
[42:46] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[42:49] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[42:52] David and the virgin's name was Mary
[42:56] and the angel came in unto her and said
[43:00] hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is
[43:04] with thee blessed art thou among women
[43:07] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[43:10] his saying and cast in her mind what
[43:13] manner of salutation this should be and
[43:17] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[43:20] for thou has found favor with God what a
[43:24] statement and behold Thou shalt conceive
[43:28] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[43:31] shall call his name Jesus and he shall
[43:34] be great and shall be called the son of
[43:37] the highest and the Lord God shall give
[43:40] unto thee unto him the Throne of his
[43:43] father David and he shall reign over the
[43:46] house of Jacob
[43:48] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[43:50] be no
[43:51] end and then said Mary unto the angel
[43:55] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[43:58] man and the angel answered and said unto
[44:01] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[44:05] and the power of the highest shall
[44:07] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[44:11] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[44:14] be called The Son of God and behold thy
[44:18] cousin
[44:19] Elizabeth she shall also
[44:22] conceive and a son in her old age and
[44:25] the this is the sixth month with her who
[44:28] was called Baron now notice these next
[44:31] words for with God nothing shall be
[44:37] impossible and Mary said behold the
[44:39] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[44:43] according to Thy word and Mary arose in
[44:47] those days and went in the Hill Country
[44:50] with haste into the city of Judah and
[44:53] entered into the house of Zacharias
[44:56] and saluted Elizabeth and it came to
[44:59] pass that when Elizabeth heard the
[45:01] salutation of Mary The Babe leaped in
[45:05] her womb and Elizabeth's with was filled
[45:08] with the Holy Ghost and she spake out
[45:12] with a loud voice and said blessed are
[45:15] thou among women blessed is the fruit of
[45:18] thy womb and when is this to come to
[45:22] this come to me that the mother of my my
[45:26] Lord should come to me for lo as soon as
[45:31] the voice of the salutation sounded in
[45:34] mine ears The Babe lip leaped in my womb
[45:38] for joy and blessed is she that believed
[45:43] for there shall be a performance of
[45:47] those things which were told her from
[45:50] the Lord and Mary said my soul do
[45:54] magnify the Lord
[45:56] and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
[46:00] savior you may be seated may the Lord
[46:03] add to the blessing of his
[46:09] word I have just read to you
[46:12] today one of the most
[46:15] phenomenal
[46:16] Supernatural
[46:18] testimonies that is that is believed by
[46:23] I would say all of christiandom
[46:25] regardless of
[46:27] denomination and we all hinged on one
[46:31] girl's
[46:35] testimony there wasn't a thousand people
[46:37] standing there when it
[46:41] happened as a matter of fact critics
[46:44] would immediately go to work calling
[46:48] this child IL illegitimate and she a
[46:51] harlot but we
[46:54] today believe this testimony with all of
[46:59] our
[47:03] hearts we believe it with all of our
[47:06] hearts for we as Christian Believers
[47:10] believe that that same God came and
[47:13] visited our
[47:16] womb and it became a supernatural
[47:19] experience to
[47:20] us and no matter what the devil in all
[47:23] of his critics say that it didn't happen
[47:27] we know that we know that we know that
[47:30] we
[47:32] know that the angel of God came directly
[47:36] to our
[47:37] manger and wanted to be born in our
[47:40] heart and changed our
[47:43] lives
[47:45] amen for the scripture tells us in
[47:48] Isaiah 49 and verse 7 thus sayith the
[47:51] Lord the the Redeemer of Israel the ho
[47:53] the Holy One to with whom man despiseth
[47:58] to him whom the nation ad whth to a
[48:02] servant of the rulers Kings shall see
[48:05] thee see and arise and princes shall
[48:08] worship because of the Lord that is
[48:11] faithful and the Holy One of Israel he
[48:15] shall choose thee thus sayeth the Lord
[48:17] in acceptance of time I heard thee and
[48:21] in a day of salvation have I helped thee
[48:25] and I will preserve thee and give thee
[48:27] for a covenant of the people to
[48:30] establish the Earth to cause the
[48:34] inheritance inherit the desolate
[48:38] inheritance Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6
[48:42] familiar to you for unto us a child is
[48:46] born unto us a son is given and the
[48:50] government shall come upon his shoulder
[48:52] and his name shall be called the be
[48:56] called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[49:00] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[49:04] Peace Isaiah 7 and verse
[49:07] 14 we know a prophet is a Seer he's the
[49:11] Divine interpreter of the word amen and
[49:14] regardless of whether it happens today
[49:16] or it happens 400 years from
[49:23] now Isaiah 7 in verse 14 I'd like for
[49:27] you to read this with me therefore the
[49:30] Lord himself shall give you a sign
[49:34] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[49:38] a son and shall call his name
[49:43] Emmanuel amen Give the Lord a great big
[49:45] hand right
[49:46] [Applause]
[49:52] there this is a long quote but it's been
[49:55] one one of my favorite
[49:57] quotes throughout my My Life Is Knowing
[50:01] the message brother brandham is speaking
[50:03] in Mary's belief and he begins and he
[50:08] almost gives it a history and you
[50:10] actually feel like you're watching a
[50:13] movie and as they as it was as the
[50:16] custom would would set out there and
[50:20] they would look at a little house and
[50:22] plan just how the Roses would be at at
[50:25] the spot and the gate must must be a
[50:28] little heart because they were so in
[50:31] love and they would be planning on on it
[50:35] and because of Joseph being a carpenter
[50:38] he could take his time and and then
[50:41] perhaps just behind the house there was
[50:44] going to be a a carpenter shop and where
[50:47] he would do all of his cabinet work and
[50:50] to make his doors and the little odds
[50:53] and ends that would be brought to him
[50:55] and in that they would have their
[50:59] livelihood and this is Sunday and as
[51:02] soon as they had came out or the Sabbath
[51:05] and sat on the front door of the midday
[51:08] meal it must have been Joseph that said
[51:11] that was a striking message this morning
[51:14] Mary Mary I'm so thrilled when I heard
[51:17] our Rabbi speak of the greatness of
[51:19] Jehovah and oh how he told us of of what
[51:23] that Great Mighty God it came down in
[51:25] Egypt and took our people out and how he
[51:28] opened up the Red Sea and when it got in
[51:31] his way and how he rained bread out of
[51:34] heaven and blowed the quals out of the
[51:36] field and led the pillar of Fire by
[51:39] night and A Cloud by day and how the
[51:41] children of Israel camped under this
[51:44] great light and as he walked in the
[51:46] light wherever it went they went also
[51:49] and they brought him them safety into a
[51:52] Promised Land Mary might have said
[51:55] something like this yes darling I want
[51:59] to ask you something what happened to
[52:02] that great
[52:04] God he isn't just the same great
[52:09] today as he was then did you notice the
[52:12] rabbi after that wonderful message and
[52:16] then Al last he said Jehovah mus he
[52:18] turned his back on us because that he
[52:21] doesn't perform Miracles
[52:24] anymore but Joseph quickly picked it up
[52:27] and said but Mary I believe that God is
[52:31] just as great and is as powerful as he
[52:34] ever
[52:35] was amen and upon that Mary's mother
[52:38] Anna must have come to the door and said
[52:41] are you young folks waiting for the
[52:44] scriptures and handed them a handed into
[52:48] the hand of Mary which passed it on to
[52:50] Joseph the book of
[52:53] Isaiah and Joseph opened the scroll and
[52:56] begin to read when he came to Isaiah 9
[52:59] and6 unto us a child is born unto us a
[53:03] son is given and the government shall be
[53:06] upon his shoulders and his name Shall be
[53:08] Called counselor the Prince of Peace the
[53:11] Mighty God the Everlasting
[53:14] father and of his peace and of his
[53:17] kingdom there shall be no end it must
[53:20] have been about that time that Mary's
[53:23] heart felt strangely warned
[53:26] isn't it strange how God does these
[53:28] things the scriptures made
[53:31] manifest she said Joseph and he looked
[53:35] at her and perhaps he always thought she
[53:38] was the most beautiful woman that he
[53:39] ever saw but then there was a certain
[53:42] look in her face that Charmed him more
[53:45] than ever don't you like
[53:49] that and while her eyes pretty eyes
[53:52] looked at him like that like a dove saw
[53:55] soft and innocent and I think that's the
[53:57] way a woman should look innocent and
[53:59] soft and sweet she said
[54:04] Joseph what was the prophet speaking of
[54:07] when he said unto us a child is born
[54:11] unto us a son is
[54:13] given who is this son and and this child
[54:17] that he was speaking of and Joseph
[54:20] looked back to her and must have said
[54:22] well my dear the prophet was speaking of
[54:25] the coming
[54:26] Messiah the hope of Israel and you know
[54:30] Mary that all down Through the Ages
[54:33] since Moses we've looked forward to that
[54:37] one coming and and when he comes he will
[54:40] deliver us out of the hand of bondage
[54:42] and of these Romans and out of the
[54:45] bondage of our sins and Israel will know
[54:48] their God and he will keep his word and
[54:51] and Mary my dear if we don't see him in
[54:54] our gener generation we shall surely be
[54:57] here for the next but but we'll look for
[55:00] him in our
[55:03] generation all night she just couldn't
[55:05] sleep over that unto us a child is born
[55:09] unto us a son is given and the next
[55:12] morning she'd sleep
[55:15] late and you said brother Ron is brother
[55:17] Brown just making something up well was
[55:19] he making something up in the Garden of
[55:22] [Music]
[55:24] Eden was he making something up that
[55:27] Mary had blonde hair and how beautiful
[55:30] that she was
[55:34] and was he really making something up
[55:37] when he said I watched them walk out of
[55:39] the Garden of Eden in the last service
[55:43] amen so let's just take it and all night
[55:47] she couldn't sleep over it unto us a
[55:49] child is born unto us a son is given and
[55:53] then nor next morning she she slept late
[55:56] so she was late getting to the
[55:59] well and that's why the sun was up and
[56:03] and as she made her way down the certain
[56:05] Street seemed to like no one was around
[56:09] and she was thinking on the scripture
[56:11] and it's usually when you're you're
[56:14] thinking I believe that's the reason
[56:17] people doesn't have the victory in the
[56:19] heart that they should have is because
[56:21] that their thoughts are on other things
[56:30] he comes to another place and he says
[56:33] now the Virgin Mary when the angel
[56:36] Gabriel met her and told her that she
[56:39] was going to have a baby and without
[56:42] knowing a man and he
[56:46] goes never
[56:48] been she never leaned on her own
[56:53] understanding that a that a woman could
[56:55] not have a baby without having her
[56:57] husband she didn't lean upon that but
[57:01] she said behold the handmade of the Lord
[57:05] be it unto me according to your word she
[57:08] didn't say how am I going to do it and
[57:11] then and and when we'll do it but how is
[57:15] this going to take place the angel said
[57:19] the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and
[57:23] thou and that Holy thing
[57:25] will be born of thee and shall be called
[57:28] The Son of God and she said behold the
[57:31] handmade of the Lord she didn't take her
[57:36] reasoning saying it couldn't be done she
[57:39] just said behold the handmade of the
[57:43] Lord that's
[57:46] right now notice he comes to another
[57:51] spot now Gabriel will announce the
[57:53] second coming the sound of the trumpet
[57:56] of God the dead in Christ shall
[57:58] rise then he says give us more
[58:02] Marys around here that can take the word
[58:06] that God at his word and praise him
[58:08] whether you feel anything or not take
[58:12] him at his
[58:14] word God's trying to find somebody who
[58:17] will take him at his
[58:19] word I don't care how you
[58:23] feel another place I hope this is okay
[58:28] she never waited till she felt
[58:30] life she never waited for anything
[58:34] positive the his word was enough for
[58:40] her she started right on her way
[58:42] rejoicing saying and testifying and she
[58:45] was going to have a baby before any
[58:49] visible sign appeared that's the way a
[58:51] real believer takes God at his word and
[58:55] starts testifying and giving God's
[58:57] praise as soon as soon as you can settle
[59:02] on that fact that God said
[59:05] so that's what makes the
[59:08] difference God said
[59:12] so
[59:14] Hallelujah don't you love it just take
[59:17] him at his word now remember no
[59:21] sensation was
[59:23] there
[59:25] no sensation was there be it unto me
[59:29] according to thy work now remember this
[59:33] is different than when she got the Holy
[59:35] Ghost she was getting
[59:38] pregnant when she got the Holy Ghost she
[59:42] was in the upper room with 119 other
[59:47] people and she came out of the upper
[59:50] room staggering and speaking in tongues
[59:53] yeah brother brandom said now if Mary
[59:56] had to get the Holy Ghost you're going
[59:58] to have to have the Holy
[1:00:02] Ghost that oldfashioned new birth we got
[1:00:05] to have it we don't want some stillborn
[1:00:08] children are you with me now we don't
[1:00:10] want some churchianity and and some kind
[1:00:13] of a
[1:00:15] intellectual Christ we want God to live
[1:00:19] in our
[1:00:22] lives he says now so you see
[1:00:26] Jesus was
[1:00:28] God that ought to settle it he was not
[1:00:31] the third person or the fourth person
[1:00:33] even the second person he was the person
[1:00:37] he was
[1:00:39] God he was Emmanuel God came down from
[1:00:43] Glory revealed himself I love that
[1:00:46] story Booth clber would write would be
[1:00:50] gray that beautiful
[1:00:53] hymn as as sister Karen would sing this
[1:00:56] would be her last song that she would
[1:00:58] sing Karen puit down from his glory ever
[1:01:02] living story my God and savior came and
[1:01:07] Jesus was his name born in a manger to
[1:01:11] his own a stranger a Man of Sorrows and
[1:01:14] tears and
[1:01:15] Agony oh what a condensation condens
[1:01:20] bringing us Redemption when in the dead
[1:01:23] of night not one faint hope in sight God
[1:01:26] precious tender laid aside his Splendor
[1:01:30] stooping to woo to save my
[1:01:36] soul oh how I love
[1:01:39] him how I adore him my breath and my
[1:01:44] sunshine my all in all the great
[1:01:48] Redeemer became my savior the great
[1:01:51] Creator became my savior and all God's
[1:01:55] fullness dwelleth in
[1:01:59] him that's the one that met the
[1:02:02] requirement Grace produced the person of
[1:02:05] Jesus Christ we find out this book now
[1:02:08] God stretched his tent and came came
[1:02:11] from God and became a man he changed his
[1:02:14] strain he from the almighty to be a man
[1:02:18] to take on the form of man so he could
[1:02:23] die
[1:02:25] to redeem
[1:02:26] man and bring us back to God again there
[1:02:30] it
[1:02:31] is there is the
[1:02:35] Redeemer Christ has redeemed us now we
[1:02:38] are now redeemed but he has he has not
[1:02:42] claimed his possessions yet now you
[1:02:44] might differ with that but just to hold
[1:02:48] on a minute he said and we'll
[1:02:51] see he hasn't claimed it and if he took
[1:02:54] the book of redemption everything that
[1:02:56] Adam had and everything that he lost
[1:03:00] Christ redeems
[1:03:02] back why did it have to be a virgin
[1:03:05] birth to redeem all the way back to
[1:03:08] Adam if it was sex in the Garden of
[1:03:13] Eden he had to redeem that
[1:03:18] sin he had to redeem that sin and when
[1:03:22] God stood there with Adam and the
[1:03:25] serpent there's going to be imetry
[1:03:28] between the
[1:03:31] seeds that ought approve the serpent
[1:03:34] seed right there you don't need no more
[1:03:36] than that it wasn't an
[1:03:40] apple it wasn't an
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:47] apple God had to come become
[1:03:50] virgin it wasn't part Mary and part God
[1:03:55] it was all
[1:03:56] God God needed a womb to be born inside
[1:04:04] of listen God didn't search the Earth to
[1:04:07] find out where Mary was he knew where
[1:04:10] she was he knew the hour that she would
[1:04:13] be
[1:04:13] born she had no idea that she would
[1:04:17] carry the
[1:04:19] Messiah God elected her to be the mother
[1:04:23] of God
[1:04:26] that she would be the
[1:04:28] incubator to carry our Lord Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ that's
[1:04:35] right we had no
[1:04:39] idea for many years we walked and
[1:04:42] something strange moved inside of us and
[1:04:45] sin just couldn't satisfy us but there
[1:04:49] was something calling us to another
[1:04:52] realm that's right
[1:05:05] he took the book of
[1:05:07] redemption and everything that Adam had
[1:05:09] and everything that he
[1:05:12] lost
[1:05:14] Christ redeems it
[1:05:19] back he canot until the time
[1:05:22] appointed and then will the Resurrection
[1:05:25] come and then the Earth will be renewed
[1:05:28] again and then he'll take
[1:05:30] possession his
[1:05:33] possession which he got when he redeemed
[1:05:37] us but we'll do it notice how this
[1:05:41] Prophet says but it will do it at the
[1:05:44] appointed
[1:05:47] time brother Kelly sent me this
[1:05:50] quote actually I'm wearing Brother
[1:05:52] Kelly's tie that he sent me
[1:05:56] me now the first thing
[1:06:00] God this was
[1:06:03] God Jesus was God in the form of man
[1:06:08] amen that's hard for people to
[1:06:11] swallow even today that he was
[1:06:16] God that's what he was he wasn't nothing
[1:06:20] less than God he was God manif ested in
[1:06:25] flesh he was the creator in his own
[1:06:29] creation he was the creator in his own
[1:06:32] creation and by the creation for the
[1:06:36] creation he was the creator in his own
[1:06:39] creation he said all
[1:06:42] winds right back into God the whole
[1:06:49] thing he says don't you see it it's the
[1:06:52] fullness of God
[1:06:54] he was the creator in so much that he
[1:06:59] was
[1:07:01] God and he was a being on the earth and
[1:07:05] a being of
[1:07:06] time which means that he must had a
[1:07:10] beginning therefore he created himself a
[1:07:13] body to live in God himself created a
[1:07:18] body for himself
[1:07:21] amlu himself created a body for himself
[1:07:25] that by his creation he may Save The
[1:07:29] Lost
[1:07:31] creation that he had
[1:07:34] created now I want to I want to just
[1:07:36] stop there just for a moment you say
[1:07:38] well brother Ron I don't know about God
[1:07:40] creating himself a
[1:07:42] body he created a pillar of fire to be
[1:07:47] in he created a cloud to be
[1:07:50] in he created a will within the middle
[1:07:53] of a will to be in he took a zigzag
[1:07:57] lightning and stepped into a body and
[1:08:00] came and visited three
[1:08:03] men in a furnace of
[1:08:06] fire Moses saw him not just in a pillar
[1:08:10] of fire or in a burning
[1:08:13] bush but he said and Moses always
[1:08:17] desired to see God and God stepped into
[1:08:20] a body and let him see himself as a
[1:08:25] man didn't even let him see his face but
[1:08:29] saw the hinder parts of a
[1:08:33] man God came in the form of
[1:08:37] MDC in a body and ate meat and drank
[1:08:45] milk are you with me now God comes in
[1:08:48] this building and buildings like this
[1:08:50] all over the
[1:08:52] world as a wind he comes as a presence
[1:08:55] he comes as a pillar of fire he comes as
[1:08:58] an angel here he is Among
[1:09:02] Us he comes as a warm presence to
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:08] you as you said last night bumping into
[1:09:12] an angel Hallelujah that was a quote
[1:09:15] you're not just was saying it off of
[1:09:16] your cuff that's a
[1:09:19] quote you might ask
[1:09:22] her
[1:09:24] she's not in the who's
[1:09:26] who she's not a priest's daughter she's
[1:09:29] not in some great wealthy royal
[1:09:33] family
[1:09:34] her come on
[1:09:39] you
[1:09:41] her
[1:09:46] you now why a Satan fight you so hard I
[1:09:50] want to come back and get that why does
[1:09:51] Satan fight you so so hard
[1:09:54] no doubt just as as soon as the
[1:09:57] testimony was going forth Satan went to
[1:10:00] work to discredit the testimony why he
[1:10:05] is allowed to be in another
[1:10:08] dimension to watch the
[1:10:11] light the angel come from the portals of
[1:10:15] glory and come and visit with Mary not
[1:10:20] only Mary saw him but the devil saw him
[1:10:27] and he knew if that angel was coming to
[1:10:29] that virgin girl then the Prophecies of
[1:10:32] the word was getting ready to happen
[1:10:34] because it had never happened
[1:10:37] before let's just say this her first
[1:10:41] testimony created
[1:10:44] life a dead baby in the womb the first
[1:10:50] testimony his name Shall be Called Jesus
[1:11:03] there'll be no room in the
[1:11:06] N there will be no
[1:11:09] Cathedral to be birthed in no high
[1:11:13] priest will be
[1:11:14] there to give honor to the baby being
[1:11:17] born the dignitaries of the city will be
[1:11:21] nowhere to be found that's right what
[1:11:24] was it brother Ron God hiding
[1:11:34] himself no
[1:11:36] doubt the manger that was B
[1:11:40] built he never had any
[1:11:43] thought no doubt not even registered
[1:11:47] animals was inside of that
[1:11:50] Barn Bloodlines no doubt was
[1:11:54] just simple
[1:11:58] animals but you notice who
[1:12:01] visited
[1:12:04] Shepherds brother random said why did it
[1:12:07] have to be
[1:12:08] Shepherds because they would feel
[1:12:11] comfortable in a
[1:12:15] barn God loves to come to your
[1:12:18] home to these churches where he feels
[1:12:22] comfortable
[1:12:28] I want Jesus to be
[1:12:30] comfortable where we're
[1:12:33] at I just really don't like being at a
[1:12:37] place to where that I have to seem to
[1:12:40] put on an
[1:12:42] air or kind of have to step out of my
[1:12:45] level I don't like those kind of things
[1:12:48] I'm not real comfortable with
[1:12:50] dignitaries or higher lifted UPS I I
[1:12:54] like being with the children of
[1:12:57] God I I really like that now if I like
[1:13:01] that and you like that it must be from
[1:13:02] our
[1:13:04] father that's what he
[1:13:08] likes now
[1:13:11] notice he says it bypassed the Nobles of
[1:13:16] the
[1:13:17] land it bypassed the
[1:13:20] Nobles and was revealed to the nobody
[1:13:26] all the Nobles that were that were so
[1:13:28] decorated with their great doctor's
[1:13:31] Divinity and psychology and highly
[1:13:35] educated and great Cathedrals and things
[1:13:38] it was all bypass and revealed to no
[1:13:41] bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of
[1:13:44] almighty God did it to make known to
[1:13:47] them the greatest message that ever was
[1:13:51] the Messiah is is now on the
[1:13:55] earth oh I love that what a wisdom could
[1:13:59] only come from God who knows wisdom all
[1:14:03] the wisdom and all the schooling and
[1:14:06] everything was now laid to waste and
[1:14:09] bypass the greatest wisdom of
[1:14:13] God and brother bran preaches that and
[1:14:16] why it had to be
[1:14:19] Shepherds now we too have met an angel
[1:14:24] we too have met an angel Revelation 10
[1:14:28] and verse 7 but not only Revelations 10
[1:14:31] and verse 7 but Revelations 10 and verse
[1:14:34] one two angels on the earth at the same
[1:14:37] time the seventh
[1:14:40] messenger and Christ
[1:14:43] himself that's right now the sabath
[1:14:46] messenger had to leave the scene but
[1:14:48] Revelations 10:1 didn't
[1:14:52] leave yes and he is here to see the work
[1:14:56] to be
[1:14:59] finished he is here on the quietest
[1:15:03] service he is here on the loudest
[1:15:06] service and I'm not just saying that to
[1:15:08] our church but I'm saying it to every
[1:15:11] message
[1:15:12] Church never let us take a service for
[1:15:19] granted never let us walk in and just
[1:15:22] sit down and say entertain
[1:15:25] me but every service is drawing us
[1:15:29] closer to the Divine promise and we too
[1:15:34] want to say be it unto
[1:15:37] me are you getting it be it unto me
[1:15:40] according to Thy
[1:15:43] word as I just
[1:15:46] said all of our belief comes to one
[1:15:52] testimony
[1:15:54] now the message is always also also like
[1:16:01] that we
[1:16:03] believe that brother brandham was in a
[1:16:07] cave and as he was in a cave and he was
[1:16:10] praying about certain things that a man
[1:16:14] about six foot
[1:16:15] tall Olive complexion hair down to his
[1:16:19] shoulders and he walked in and he said
[1:16:24] he was sent from the presence of
[1:16:26] almighty God fear not
[1:16:30] amen and he began to tell him of his
[1:16:33] commission and brother Brandon began to
[1:16:35] give him excuses of you know he couldn't
[1:16:38] see himself he's going to preach around
[1:16:41] the world
[1:16:43] and are you with
[1:16:46] me now brother Ron do you believe that
[1:16:49] with all your hearts
[1:16:51] amen with everything that's within
[1:16:58] me you say well brother Ron I don't know
[1:17:00] if I can believe that I I just don't
[1:17:02] know well can you believe
[1:17:10] Mary can you believe
[1:17:13] Mary and here's a
[1:17:15] seventh here's a seventh Church AE
[1:17:17] messenger telling us how the angel came
[1:17:20] to
[1:17:22] me
[1:17:23] I was a little boy I was seven years
[1:17:27] old dad was listening to the tape how
[1:17:31] the angel came to
[1:17:33] me the presence of God filled my little
[1:17:36] bedroom where I was laying listen to the
[1:17:40] messenger and as I was laying in this
[1:17:43] little room I would say that that little
[1:17:44] room you couldn't fit that Pano in that
[1:17:48] little
[1:17:49] room but I'll tell you that little room
[1:17:52] was F filled with the presence of
[1:17:55] God my dad heard me crying and he came
[1:17:58] in and he said Ron did you hear that the
[1:18:01] angel
[1:18:02] came to brother brandom in a cave and he
[1:18:06] told me these words he said that same
[1:18:08] angel that we're listening to on the
[1:18:11] tape is in your room right now
[1:18:14] on I feel him right
[1:18:21] now
[1:18:28] brother Brandon was instructed to go to
[1:18:30] to a
[1:18:32] mountain and there he would get the
[1:18:35] seals at one point he thought it was his
[1:18:39] death now listen he went to a mountain
[1:18:42] that thousands of people had went
[1:18:44] to and he was visited by those
[1:18:48] angels and a cloud would
[1:18:51] appear let me just say I don't have it
[1:18:54] up I I don't I don't have my seal book
[1:18:57] with
[1:18:58] me but that seal book didn't have to be
[1:19:02] edited when it came
[1:19:06] home it didn't have to be edited when it
[1:19:08] came home he would preach God hid and
[1:19:12] and revealed in Simplicity and then the
[1:19:14] breach between the church ages and the
[1:19:19] seals and then he would stand there
[1:19:22] night after night even declaring I don't
[1:19:25] know what tomorrow night's seal will be
[1:19:27] like I don't know it myself but he would
[1:19:30] repeat it in every service he came to me
[1:19:34] today the same one are you with me now
[1:19:38] I'm not ashamed to preach this he came
[1:19:41] to
[1:19:42] me he opened the book this book is not
[1:19:46] close to us now we're not just
[1:19:51] presuming we're not just presuming here
[1:19:55] we're not gessing at it we're not
[1:19:57] looking at it a theological book the
[1:20:00] same author that's written this
[1:20:02] book has called you
[1:20:06] out and brought you out it's that
[1:20:11] angel that even is Among Us

[1:25:38] when she got enough of it she'd take a
[1:25:40] broom to my
[1:25:43] [Applause]

[1:26:36] Rapture at any moment you want this
[1:26:41] body you want this body not just our
[1:26:45] soul that has already been raptured into
[1:26:48] his presence you want this body to get a

[1:27:06] and iqo more than ever before need a
[1:27:10] body
[1:27:17] change
[1:27:19] now I want you to just notice
[1:27:24] Mary now is not under the influence of a
[1:27:28] rabbi she's under the influence of an
[1:27:32] Angel Joseph is the first one that she
[1:27:36] will
[1:27:37] tell and he will have an incredibly
[1:27:40] difficult time believing
[1:27:44] her so matter of fact he in his own
[1:27:47] mortal flesh will begin to think things
[1:27:50] brother Doug of putting her away
[1:27:53] privately that's
[1:27:55] right he's a very righteous
[1:27:59] man and this is a difficult saying he's
[1:28:03] read it in the scriptures but now it's
[1:28:05] happened in his
[1:28:09] home it's happened in his
[1:28:12] home no doubt some of your families said
[1:28:15] nope I don't believe that but you didn't
[1:28:18] walk
[1:28:20] away it only rooted your testimony only
[1:28:25] deeper because you
[1:28:28] knew people may have made fun of you but
[1:28:31] it only rooted your your testimony
[1:28:34] deeper you hung on to the
[1:28:37] word when Satan offered you an easier
[1:28:43] way you byass hundreds of
[1:28:47] churches sure you do but there's
[1:28:50] something here
[1:28:55] that feed your
[1:28:58] soul and you go out of this building and
[1:29:01] you get in your car and there's special
[1:29:03] parts of the service that is so real to
[1:29:09] you that is so real to you that
[1:29:13] anchors it doesn't matter how
[1:29:17] far it doesn't matter what the trouble
[1:29:20] is but there's so I'm not just talking
[1:29:22] to them I'm talking to you too it
[1:29:24] doesn't matter but if you're looking for
[1:29:27] every if you're looking for that one
[1:29:29] part of the service that goes that's for
[1:29:37] me now I want you to just
[1:29:41] notice now Mary testifies to Joseph and
[1:29:45] Joseph has a supernatural experience and
[1:29:49] an angel comes to him when she tell
[1:29:51] testifies to
[1:29:53] Elizabeth Elizabeth has a supernatural
[1:29:56] experience and the baby is has come to
[1:29:59] life and it's been dead she's never felt
[1:30:02] it kick and immediately when this
[1:30:05] testimony
[1:30:06] comes there's a result that happens now
[1:30:10] I'm coming to an
[1:30:11] end there's a result that happens and
[1:30:15] immediately she
[1:30:18] responds my soul doth magnify the Lord
[1:30:22] and life happens inside of
[1:30:26] her and Mary believes this Angel's words
[1:30:30] and she hasn't been with Joseph but the
[1:30:33] words of that
[1:30:35] testimony now begin to cause a
[1:30:40] Happening Now begin to cause a
[1:30:45] happening her Rob begins to get
[1:30:49] tighter where she feeding that baby from
[1:30:53] from this cursed
[1:30:55] Earth the food that she's eating from
[1:30:58] this cursed
[1:31:00] Earth that was cursed since Adam's flaw
[1:31:04] God was allowing her to eat that out of
[1:31:07] the
[1:31:08] ground because he was not going to just
[1:31:10] redeem mankind but he was going to
[1:31:13] redeem this cursed
[1:31:15] [Applause]
[1:31:20] Earth
[1:31:27] the word be to show on
[1:31:32] her that's when the pressure really got
[1:31:36] on God didn't Peck you because you were
[1:31:39] some panty waste

[1:31:45] you cuz he knew that regardless of the
[1:31:48] pressure that would come on you and the
