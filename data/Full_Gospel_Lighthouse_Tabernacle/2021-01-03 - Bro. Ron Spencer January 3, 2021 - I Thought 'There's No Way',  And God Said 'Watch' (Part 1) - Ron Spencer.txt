certainly love you amen any good to us amen certainly enjoyed last night i don't know if you got to see it but i i certainly i certainly was very very inspired by each speaker that spoke and they're in their ways and it's kind of like different artists stepping into a and step into the same canvas and putting their part there and so it was so so wonderful amen amen we're strictly instructed not to look back and i think i think any time that a person gets disillusioned is when they start looking back and maybe looking back to the things they came from or looking back to the disappointments of life we're going to all have them in our journey we're going to all have them and so amen we're going to go through just like what we are here in virginia we are a unique state because we experience all four seasons very well whether it's spring or whether it's summer or fall or winter in our spiritual walk it's the very same way in the winter time it'll be times to where you don't feel god it feels like he's a million miles away but just wait a few days spring will come resurrection will take place new revival in your life and then the summer of the fruits and you enjoy that in the fall you just i i think fall is the greatest time of the year to myself other uh other than spring but we all love spring the grass is getting green and starting to feel some warm days and robins are showing up and we love that time of year and of course for most of us hunters here we enjoy the fall and so boxers amen amen i i just want to i've got a little church business to do this morning and and then we'll go forward with the word if that's okay if you can just pay patient with me 2020 brought about a lot of difficult things for us this year and uh kovid was a was a very vicious thing and i noticed this morning that in america 350 000 people have died from covid in the last year it's a dreaded disease but god's greater than covet and he has proved he has proved he's greater than that and um but here at the church our church is strong and we report to you that it's strong and it's we're a body movement we're a team that works together and uh this morning we're going to ordain a deacon this morning and an usher this morning and so it's been many years since i i i was i was to ordain a deacon so we're here to do that this morning but just before we do that we're we're a body we're a body church we're not uh we're not a silly lady young kid tender kindergarten church we're a mature church here and we've got new ones that are among us and it feels like they just grow right up so quickly and we're so thankful for that and and uh just i just would like to just mention a few things maybe for the internet audience won't mean a thing to you but for us as a local body means everything we have brother roy and sister darlene turner that they uh they have been a family that has has chose to live here on the property and kind of oversee it and take care of it they do tasks that throughout the year 52 weeks a year and we're so thankful for them and uh amen brother roy has been our official door opener for so many years and to to let everybody know that there you come to this church and and i think if he's our first billboard at the door that has a smile and a handshake for everybody i think that's just a real testimony to this audience and and his wife is just a real queen and we love her with all of our hearts and thank them for i think they they take care of all of the custodial work and baptism getting it ready and and those kinds of things maybe one one weekend a month designated families take care of that that part just to give them relief but we'd like to thank you thank you each and every one that takes care of that thank you brother roy and sister darlene amen if you'll notice i mentioned you first amen because you wouldn't want it but we want to tell you that amen you know a church has a mechanical crew everybody has to have in your home and in your i uh one of the most important things the unseen part is the mechanicals and that's things that need to be fixed repaired things that need to be brightened up or you know just just plain renewed and god sent us into this body many years ago brother brother ray lambert sister sue and their entire team a son-in-law that reminds sister sue of a lot of myself i don't know whether that's good or bad brother jeff brother tom brother terry uh brother nate hill and they work on everything i i don't think it's anything that they can't take care of the manger scene that went up and and came down and the electrical with brother alden making sure the lights got turned on to it we can never say thank you enough for all that goes there brother jim that works along and we just we we want to say thank you thank you from the bottom of our heart i think sam hill once in a while and i'll not leave you out either so we're just so glad to have have you on our team and so we thank you we thank you you do things that i cannot do and i just so appreciate that with all of our hearts amen give them a great big hand this morning brother ray lambert has a twin in edmonton canada looks just like him operates just like him carries his body just like him and i i just grin when i see him up in canada so amen so i've got ray with me a lot of places so amen you know the grass grows and you know the grass and not only grass but weeds grow and so we've got a young fella here that'll be getting married in a few months and uh but i'd like to thank brother adam and uh you know we we asked brother adam about six months before brother roy had a little episode and he said i knew now why you you felt led to move that to brother adam's job but brother ma adam mows these now tall banks and so we just so thank brother adam for what he does and amen i know you're not asking for that he and his dad take care of the flowers of the church and all the things that goes on and so we just so appreciate that with all of our hearts last year was a difficult year for us here and we lost sister katie lorendo she was a quiet and she was powerful voice here and she was here i i would think three years maybe and when she would sit in the church she would just kind of rock and then once in a while she'd go in a circle and you knew it was on when she was going in a circle and so amen and so we miss her she's now not 90 years old she is a young lady in heaven and we we sure we sure loved her we lost sister meadows a matriarch of a family a powerful voice to this audience a real mate to brother brother meadows and we all loved her with all of her hearts and probably 70 percent of this congregation his grandchildren i don't know amen she was she was a absolutely great lady lost her son larry and and uh he was an absolute he was an absolute wonderful man behind the scenes for their family did a lot of work and attributed to a lot of things and still does sometimes our legacy still lives on sister sharon shifflet that called this her church for many many years lost her and brother andrew actually preached that funeral while i was very very sick we had a fellow that came here that was an odd sort of a fellow sometimes eternal life comes in odd ways we met this man many many years ago in the business world rough is not the words to say his his mantra was that he wore his shirt unbuttoned all the way to his belly button but for church he buttoned up at least one extra button and we were thankful we were thankful for that he loved us he loved you he was a contributor to this audience even behind the scenes didn't show up much he would say some people don't need as much church as other people needs but but i'll never forget his funeral it was the place that i saw matthew become a real preacher and it was the fir i saw him preach here behind the pulpit many times but when i saw him preach on on that morning i said he's made it i thought last night matthew did phenomenal as well [Music] but john hinton was a man that we all loved many of you loved many of you got to know him but he was a man that we loved he was eccentric he had his own ways he hated preachers and yet wound up with us as his best friends and we loved him and we love his family ellwood gregory that just passed away he was attached to family here we we preached his funeral and i'll never forget this funeral because god spoke to me on the day that i was preparing to preach the funeral and he gave me words and literally i heard the voice of the lord speak to me i care do you care and god does care this week we've lost brother roby turner a minister that came to our meetings many through the years 85 years old they're a body that will will have transition it will have it will have to to elect a new pastor to take the role i don't know who will do that don't even have an unction that's above my pay grade but we just pray that god would just be with the family brother joe green is to preach the funeral this week i probably will not go because of my own personal health at this point but i would like for you to remember them in prayer that god would just be with them amen amen we have a ministry team here that god has put together and we certainly are so appreciative of god brought me here starting in 1999 of course i preached here in 1984 and uh and every every year i would become here come here periodically through the years and then in 1999 we accepted and and you voted for me to become the the pastor along with brother homer and i moved here in 2000 july of 2000 since then my boys have grew up and i didn't put them in the ministry because if i could have i'd have stopped them but i'm very thrilled to say that brother matthew has has done as well as he's doing and growing and we are so thankful brother matthew for all that you do music leading the services and getting everything in order we thank you for that amen brother andrew that became our interim acting right hand whatever sovereign right land leader amen amen and i'm sure you appreciate brother andrew's pastoral work as he has you know and we thank you for that i i thought it was absolutely sovereign in the way that god did it and it was our last communion service in february and i'm sorry it's been that long but due to due to covid we we're just where we are but we elected brother andrew and you voted as an audience as a full body that brother andrew would would would do the job many churches wait till after the pastor's deceased and then it goes through all kind of voting and all kind of trials and all kind of that god has provided for us that we don't have to do that and so should i pass tomorrow it will be no hiccups next saturday night so so and i'm not passing tomorrow let me say it like that i got i got a lot of work to do a lot of sermons preach a lot of conventions to preach and so so i'm gonna preach to you this morning and but just as a reminder to our audience and our body uh you know how you know what my desire is and not just my desire but the will of the people is that andrew would become the next pastor so we're thankful for that i'm glad that's i'm glad that's in good hands i like i say about problems sometimes they're good problems so so we're just thankful for that i hope you don't mind me taking a few moments here our deacons just as a reminder of you our deacons we lost brother john kelly last year and the reason i didn't mention him just a little while ago because i wanted to bring him into the the the group of deacons that we have brother john kelly was a very loyal faithful deacon i don't think we'll ever have another man that made as many phone calls to check on you how are you doing i'm praying for you brother john the cell phone was invented for brother john kelly and uh we just are so thankful for the work that he did also brother ralph brother ralph was an incredible worker here as a deacon and he did that for many many years we've lost several different deacons brother brother wayne gooden was an incredible deacon brother leo was an incredible deacon brother john kelly brother ralph all of these and each man operated in a different way and did different things and took on different roles and so we miss them but we're just because god takes us home don't mean the work is over with and so that's what we got to be reminded of just to remind you of who our deacons are brother vernon frazier that was here last night brother bill henkel that sits here with sister linda brother joe shifflet and brother meadows and we just thank god for each one of these men their lives and their ministry and what they have meant to this church let's give them a great big hand brother alden is what we would call a a fresher junior deacon but he's chasing me and age a little bit now and and uh how old are you brother alden 51. well brother branham called himself an old man right there brother alden has been a phenomenal deacon as well and amen we we i just began to feel led just a few months ago and i i probably have got 30 40 men in this audience that is qualified and could do the job but you know you've got to be led of god and so god led me and we have asked brother denny vance to be a deacon in this audience and be a blessing to this congregation the scripture says in first timothy chapter eight likewise must deacons be grave not double tongue not given to much wine not greedy a filthy lucr this is important holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so their wives must be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husband of one wife ruling their children and and their own houses well for they have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves of good degree great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus amen amen i i miss william i miss william i'm sorry no i want to thank god for sending us brother william brother william is an essential part of our ministry team as well and so what an awesome job he did last night amen your little boy just looked up at you and he looked with that i'm so proud he's my daddy i wish i'd had a photograph of that and looking up and yeah yeah you remember what brother branham said about when he would look up at his daddy he said his daddy with them long curly lo curls on his hair he said my daddy will live forever yeah amen i think it's good to have a good daddy and amen god bless you brother william i did not intentionally your name's here i just overlooked it but god bless you brother william we love you and your family they mean a world to us this morning i want brother denny to come and sister shawn and i'd like for all of our deacons and ministry team we're going to anoint him this morning and amen god bless you brother denny for the world that don't know brother denny was former a professional wrestler and yeah so we're going to elect him and anybody messes with he'll take care of us brother denny was a man that when i first met him he had hair down his shoulders down the middle of his back muscular handsome as he could possibly be and his beautiful wife sister shine and they have been here loyal and faithful and he fits all the description and i congratulate you for being standing here this morning it's an awesome spot to stand and we as a body we love you with all of our hearts he will be a servant to you and to help you and to maybe help you get seated or maybe in a time of need you'll need to call on him and he and sister sean and uh we just he may have to tell your children now quiet down just a little bit now don't you get mad at him brother graham said that shows you're not a christian so amen and so he'll be there to help and so we thank you brother denny for standing here this morning amen amen i anoint you in the name of

of there he's not timid he's not scared he pre-planned you the seed that he deposited in you before the foundation of the world is eternal it doesn't have anything to do with a calendar it doesn't have anything to do with time it is eternal as god is eternal it is as infinite as god is infinite god's not a myth or some theology he's god [Applause] hallelujah he's god and he is in control and if god is god and he is in control that god that's on the inside of you is bigger than your problems it's bigger than your situations it's bigger than that enemy that torments you because he's still god and there is no other look around the room there's no other god like him satan you were built by our god to be the darkness to as an antitype to the lot god built you he built you and he created you on a certain day so there's a certain day you came into existence and there's a certain day that you'll leave existence you've got an end and it's coming [Applause] now i want you to understand that we're built to overcome this age not survive it but we're built to overcome it overcoming means that you'll meet challenges in your life but you have been placed here by god you are not an accident in a womb you're not an accident in the womb you're not somebody's afterthought are you with me god watched over you and if you watched over you since adam with your natural seed he'll watch over you now if he could watch over you and you could and with when he could watch over you when you didn't have a choice you didn't have a choice to be born put me back i want to go back you didn't have that choice you didn't have a choice about your hair color you didn't have a choice about your gender [Music] [Applause] you didn't have a choice about how tall or how wide that you are or even your personality this one married this one this one married this one and this one married this one all the way down to get you here none of them might not have been believers but god's rich in mercy grabbed a hold of your life jonathan picked you up out of a deep marry clay and said here's a servant of god that i can use will overcome us that means that there will be books of written epistles read about us we think about shadrach meshach and abednego we think about samson we think about all the great men of the old testament god deposited seed as it was going on to show israel and the nations that god still lived and they overcome some phenomenal challenges whether it was the red sea opening up or tabernacle in the wilderness or a prophet standing there and remaking the altar and destroying baal's altar and rebuilding the order and calling fire from down out of heaven each one of them certain portions were written whether it would be shamgar that would grab a six foot long stick and kill 600 men they were anointed to step in the fire they were anointed to walk into lion's den they were anointed to stand to be the challenge of the age they themselves would have run with from the opposition but god inspired them and anointed them in the moment you did not call yourself to be the final voice to the final age when we see the end of a gentile dispensation winding up we see the world falling apart we would have probably chose other ages but here we are in this age and we meet challenges challenges of laodicea lukewarm uh lukewarm church age to word that even god was not welcome in it where that they took took church out of prayer out of schools and the ten commandments out of schools and this week appointed the first woman chaplain to our government this week this coming week the fulfillment of brother branham's vision will happen a catholic president active and a woman vice president brethren saw that he didn't predict it he saw that these would be the conditions of these age we know where we stand you can argue elections all you want to but god causes men to rise up to fulfill his work like to not like donald trump put israel's he put her capital back in the right spot decades passed with men making promises and would not fulfill them god raised up a man i don't know where he'll stand in the great eternities but god raised up a man to put it back because it had to be according to this word that's why i chose to vote for him again like it don't like it get mad don't get mad who cares here we are with coven kovitz started out somewhere they think maybe china started out all kind of nonsense came from it covets not bigger than god it's not bigger than god they begin to make its way across europe and across to america they made statements that won't come here well let me just say sickness don't have boundaries and so it made its way and it began to anchor now there's another wave and another wave coming they say the next wave is more contagious than this one don't get yourself scared you put yourself under the blood of jesus christ senators are dying men or representatives are dying great leaders are dying you see it's no respecter of persons god said he'd watch over us brother ron you've lost four people from your audience let me just say this to you what a great thing for god to do to take older people in that age and step them into a brand new body you see death does not win it does not win we live in a nation that exemplifies sodom and gomorrah we live in a nation that's forgot its roots a nation where on christmas day a man can get inspired to blow up a city or try to blow up a block of the city with no real reason insanities in the streets brother branham saw in in many of these visions of the tribulation period how great animals and great big great big things are going and how this all different kinds of worlds were taking place brother branham's day did not have the game world where little children can get so active in media and games and those games can absorb people and become addicted and it leaves children and then adults get involved in hours and days and weeks and gamers take on spirits and roles within games brother branham told us that rock and roll music was preparing people for the tribulation period let me just say this you be careful what you do with games in your home be careful what kind of music is played there our homes is to be filled with the holy ghost to be a boundary where we can walk in and take off our coats and rest in a sanctuary are you with me now hollywood is filthy is absolutely filthy and her filth has polluted the minds of people for decades songs of killing cops where marriages were were open marriages to where it was all right to sleep with others and so it made the modern churches have to bend and bow to the great herself before long the modern church couldn't preach on a dress code gender is no longer now just a birth situation and ministries have become so weak in the pulpit because of the love of money or the love of popularity or the love of a meta church or the love of media it is called pressures upon ministry to bend and bow are you with me and before long the church becomes dead and there's no life in it no call back to the original word of god whatsoever watch watch when the pope can announce that are now headed toward a one world currency one world church churches and nations are in the last weeks have looked to that like never before it's because they don't have an answer and i'll be very honest with you i'm not on a rant i'm not off of course here but let me just say this you our new president don't have an answer so many people are going what will his 100 days do he don't have an answer he'll change some things but he don't have an answer but brother on his agenda is bring us back to a greener earth well let me just say the coming king the coming king jesus he's going to bring us back to a greener earth where the oxygen will be pure again where the lamb will lay down with the line where there will be peace forever all right this is okay now you will discern what the prophet said in this day you will discern that evil spirit that fights you it'll not just fight you in church it'll not just fight you in your home it'll fight you daily even in your dreams but you'll discern where that spirit comes from and let me just say a spirit anybody susceptible to the spirit that's the reason the scripture tells us to try the spirits that gloomy spirit that comes on you sometimes that's not a god that depression that comes that's not a god that spirit that begins to tell you that god don't love you that's not of god the one that tells you that you're not a christian that's not of god now what you've got to do is discern where that spirit came from and knowing who you are and what you were sent here to do is turn him on his heels and send him away by the power of your voice god's asking you to speak to your mountain you speak it's fine to call brother ron but you speak you speak to that enemy get out of here i don't have time for you today not today satan [Applause] you are the one that has commissioned to cut the heads off of the devils of this day he could have had david and john and all of those others to be here today but he so happened to pick you to live in this day so quit being assistant hallelujah be fully committed come on be fully committed stand on your feet turn the wheels of the devil take the word of god slay your enemy destroy him send him back to where he came from hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] meet the challenge face the challenge face it we're gonna have a baby now whatever's blocking this satan you might as well get your stuff up and move we're gonna have a baby [Applause] this house is going to overcome we're going to overcome there may be a burning after a while but we're going to overcome we're going to have some clean out and we're going to overcome [Applause] brother man said god left some things for you to do now remember this book is full of promises and every promise in this book belongs to you every promise in this book belongs to you brother on i might be i have been fought fighting for a long time i've been fighting something that's been trying to take my life for a year and he has to be realizing by now he don't have enough i'm sure when satan was selecting a demon to fight me he didn't go down and get some wimp so mr devil if you're standing right here tonight so is an angel of god and that angel of god's got way more power than you do and you may have been the strongest demon that satan could sin but you are defeated in the name of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah we are people that has crossed the breach from church ages and church after church after church we have crossed the breach of all of the ages into the church age of laodicea within it is a bright age and we're people of the bright age we're people of the open book we're influenced by the mighty angel christ himself come to live in this book and in our lives and we're written epistles we're anointed to speak the words of life and condemn the regions of hell we're not a weak bunch of sissies we're men and women of god we stand in legacies and already in god's mind we stand there with the great generals so look past what you see look past what you see if your eyes is on this realm it's very temporary so look past what you see think past what you think i was in a meeting one morning about four o'clock with a very special presence in my office and i felt as though it was like i felt as though it was like abraham talking to him and abraham and his thoughts oh god in his thoughts he was thinking i don't know how there's just no way and melchizedek said watch brother ray i felt like i felt like it was 10 000 volts of energy in that office and i actually felt like brother tim pruitt was just just just only feet away from me as well but there he was in bed you see with god there's no time or there's no space and let me just explain that to you where was you job when i laid the foundations of the earth and let me just catch you up just for a moment god didn't come down to job and talk to to him about his earthly conditions you're so consumed job people finances and that is god's not even okay okay where was your job when i laid the foundations you thought i'm just going to come to church here you're sitting on the front world you're getting ready to get married you know that you think oh i've got my life planned out really what held you i'll tell you what held you the same voice that was speaking to job what got you here the same voice i spoke to job where was you and there i was sitting and i had a question about esther brother tim pruitt's daughter i don't know if she'll hear this but i had a question in that presence about esther his daughter these were the words it's written down these were words i've got that taken care of but my thoughts are on the greater esther and i'll take care of her and listen within just days sister karen pruitt would have a what you would call a very death blow of a hemorrhage in her brain and the doctors were giving her zero chance and she's sitting in church right now praising the lord so what he does is he stops us sometimes he said it's not what you think it's not what you feel when you say there's no way watch oh i feel i have went from a very sick man to very feel very good right now i won't be but just a few more minutes but we are the vision of brother branham's vision of the bride fulfilled i'm not talking about in the four walls of this structure but around the world in every nation hallelujah we'll stand in our national colors and will stand and we'll come forth as the bride of jesus christ from every nation on the earth not a silly little girl not an up and down church but a powerful church cause we know who we are we've read the back of the book we fed on the body word we have become lived voices in this day sometimes it's just a quiet simple life brother ron i haven't done anything very supernatural brother branham said quiet simple life do you ever get a tug sometimes during the day to see would you just pray pray just now just pray just now and you don't even know what you're praying for and maybe you've got hundreds of people around you and you just and you just go into another realm and you just start praying maybe quietly maybe silently maybe openly and you begin to pray and you're going down the road and the spirit begins to give utterance and you move into another realm i love the statement last night i don't know exactly who who said it but it's not just you but your your entire family and there may be times that you think it'll never happen that that that lost loved one will never come in let me just say you would save him if you could but because you echo back to god your prayers and your intercession and you have a supreme authority to talk lip to ear to god you move mountains you cause walls to fall somebody help me preach chains come off of them doors come open because you and god have had a conversation in a moment of sacred sovereignty and you've moved into a channel now you see we're release potentials into the earth if i could just bring your mind to just watch as as god was in the church ages was releasing a messenger and paul would be the messenger to the first church age paul wouldn't be the only man that god would anoint he would be the prophet to that church age but there would be men drinking from the same hole baptizing the same all because there was a lot of work to go on that message had to go around the world it had to move out it had to prove power and demonstration there was life that was behind it irenaeus columba god was releasing from his hand that attributed to the earth and people would grab a hold of that word and in their age overcome that's what's happened in this generation god sent a messenger he sent elijah to the earth to turn your hearts but he also sent you into the earth pre-planning you to grab ahold of the message and overcome we don't need to be pumped up primed up the seed that god put inside of us has got the life and the potentials within itself to live it is predestinated we know where our resources are we know where our strength and our energies are and we are convinced we are persuaded we'll not turn back we'll not give up we'll not turn around there is no going back for us i say we're going forward and we're walking in the vision of the word of god [Applause] this is our day this is the day that the lord has made we will rejoice [Applause] and be glad in it hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god what about you what about you what about in your home what about in your life brother brown asked us to be more sincere need to be more committed than ever before throw your pitchfork aside quit digging up your old past call for revival in your life not in the church sure the church needs more revival i wanted to start in you quit walking out of this building saying i didn't get nothing out of it it's cause

first sunday of this year we're not looking to the world to change we're looking for our bodies to change and lord sometimes we we ask the question we think how how will it happen and god just simply
