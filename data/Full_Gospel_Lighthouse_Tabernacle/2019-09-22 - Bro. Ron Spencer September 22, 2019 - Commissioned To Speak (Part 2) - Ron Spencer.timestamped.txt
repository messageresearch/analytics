[0:59] a man did you believe what you just saw
[1:05] a mint certainly good to be in the house
[1:08] of the Lord in it a man you enjoy last
[1:11] night I sure enjoyed it I've been
[1:14] feeding on it today and and looking
[1:17] forward to this afternoon service when I
[1:19] pray for the kids as they're coming home
[1:20] they're not too far away now and so but
[1:23] they're already tuned in and watching
[1:25] and so I just got a clip of them
[1:29] rejoicing with you as you were singing
[1:32] so we just we want to thank the Lord for
[1:34] that want to want you to remember by the
[1:38] Windell Martin's church they had
[1:41] dedications services this weekend and
[1:45] brand-spankin'-new church but the
[1:48] temperate speaking there this morning
[1:49] and a huge storm that's tornado alley in
[1:54] Oklahoma and a huge storm came through
[1:56] there and flooded that brand new
[1:59] building so a man you can imagine their
[2:03] disappointment today and it happened
[2:06] just before church time and so they were
[2:08] able to move the church you know you're
[2:10] not going to stop God so and so this
[2:13] will be it just a little bit of a deal
[2:15] to where they'll have to clean up the
[2:17] church and get everything back in order
[2:19] but they're our brothers and sisters and
[2:21] so we want to remember them that as
[2:23] they're going through that I prayed for
[2:25] him this morning brother Tim called me
[2:27] and asked me to go to prayer for it and
[2:29] so we prayed today as a family and so I
[2:32] would like for you to continue to
[2:33] remember them in prayer the Windell
[2:35] Martin is by the Shawn Martin's brother
[2:37] and they're just a wonderful family he's
[2:40] a wonderful singer and preacher and so
[2:42] we just we want to pray for them as a
[2:43] body of believers amen didn't God good
[2:46] to us never said we wouldn't have
[2:49] trouble but he said he'd be with us
[2:51] through the truth
[2:52] so I'm really thankful for that because
[2:54] sometimes I think man you know you would
[2:56] think after a while you beat yourself up
[2:58] do I not have faith or am i doing the
[3:00] wrong thing and you just realize that
[3:02] everybody around you is got trouble
[3:05] everybody's got trouble because we're
[3:07] born of man and few days and full of
[3:10] trouble but our promises that gotta be
[3:12] with us and so we just thank the Lord
[3:15] for that tonight
[3:16] god bless you you'll turn with me in
[3:18] your scriptures tonight in st. John
[3:22] chapter 18 in verse 36 I want to read
[3:26] one scripture I want to continue with
[3:30] the same thought last as we had last
[3:32] night
[3:33] commissioned to speak a man a couple
[3:42] services like this the devil realizes I
[3:44] got a real problem on my hand these
[3:47] people get what they're hearing if they
[3:52] get what they're hearing I got a problem
[3:56] amen and Jesus is standing in a
[4:01] dimension and explaining how powerful he
[4:05] was John 18 verse 36 and jesus answered
[4:13] my kingdom is not of this world I want
[4:19] to identify myself as that tonight my
[4:23] kingdom is not of this world
[4:25] you see I carry a citizenship of the
[4:28] United States of America and a passport
[4:30] and all of my identification and it says
[4:33] my address the United States of America
[4:35] but my kingdom is not from here if my
[4:43] kingdom were of this world then Ron
[4:47] Spencer would be here to fight did you
[4:52] get it then my servants would fight that
[4:57] I should not be delivered to the Jews
[5:00] but now is my kingdom not from him
[5:04] I want you to just notice he looked at
[5:07] the word to see what the word said about
[5:09] himself and he believed it sums 16 and
[5:14] verse 9 therefore my heart is glad and
[5:18] my glory rejoices my flesh also shall
[5:23] rest in hope for thou will not suffer
[5:28] will not leave my soul in Hell neither
[5:31] will thou suffer thine Holy One to see
[5:35] corruption Jesus new I don't need to buy
[5:41] tomb I'm not gonna be there long 2nd
[5:48] corinthians 4 and verse 17 for our light
[5:51] affliction which is but for a moment
[5:54] worketh for us a far more exceeding ly
[5:58] eternal weight of glory 2nd corinthians
[6:03] 4 and verse 8
[6:05] we're troubled on every side yet not
[6:09] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[6:13] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[6:19] down but not destroyed
[6:25] let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with
[6:28] all of our hearts tonight Lord as I read
[6:32] this word and just think about what's
[6:34] laying right in front of us I get so
[6:36] excited
[6:37] Lord Jesus I just ask you that you would
[6:40] bless your people Lord as they hear this
[6:43] word tonight to be with our young people
[6:45] as they're driving home father this
[6:46] evening Lord and I ask you that you'd be
[6:49] by the window Martin's church and the
[6:52] people that have gathered for that
[6:54] meeting there in Oklahoma brother
[6:56] temperate our buddy that's that's
[6:58] preached the meeting this morning and
[7:00] Lord I just ask you that you would be
[7:02] with them father Lord we just pray that
[7:05] you would just meet our needs this
[7:06] afternoon and touch our hearts we pray
[7:09] in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen and
[7:12] amen you can be seated
[7:19] amen brother Brent says when a man
[7:22] becomes a Christian God gives him a
[7:25] checkbook
[7:27] it's an unlimited account that goes with
[7:30] this checkbook it's already signed by
[7:34] Jesus Christ but you have to fill it out
[7:37] brother bad make a couple of statements
[7:39] and he says and she knows what he wants
[7:45] done with the word comes down and he
[7:50] says he knows that if the people get the
[7:53] true revelation of the true church and
[7:56] what she is and what she stands for that
[8:01] she can do the greater works she will be
[8:04] an invincible army now this wasn't to
[8:07] the denominational system that didn't
[8:10] know what they were in or out or up and
[8:13] down or they didn't know what scripture
[8:18] to take power out of it or what what
[8:20] spar what parts inspired but this is the
[8:22] bride to Jesus Christ this is the power
[8:26] that's been given to the bride of Jesus
[8:28] Christ and I believe I'm one of them
[8:36] and I believe that I'm one of them are
[8:40] you with me now we believe that he's
[8:42] King and Ben we're part of him were
[8:45] queen are you with me
[8:48] he conquered and we received Oh
[8:54] hallelujah
[8:55] now that the random said this he says
[8:58] God's given given every sick person in
[9:02] here divine healing every one of you
[9:06] Jesus was wounded for our transgressions
[9:10] and with His stripes we were healed it's
[9:16] yours but you'll have to fight for every
[9:20] inch that you possess everywhere the
[9:25] soles of your feet travel God told
[9:28] Joshua I've given it you footprints
[9:32] means possessions he said let's go in
[9:36] footprints means it's possession let's
[9:39] take every inch of ground that's God
[9:42] given us if you haven't got the baptism
[9:45] of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promise
[9:48] is unto you under your children to them
[9:51] that's afar off even as many as the Lord
[9:54] our God shall call footprints this
[9:58] possession let's go get it it's ours
[10:06] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[10:09] and forever less possess it it's God's
[10:14] promise don't look at the circumstances
[10:18] don't look how hard it is possess the
[10:21] land we'll have a meeting like this
[10:26] morning we were having a meeting there
[10:28] and the Holy Ghost was falling into
[10:30] place and people were screaming and
[10:32] shouting and praising the Lord and then
[10:35] someone came up and said pray for me
[10:37] brother branham and I laid hands on them
[10:39] and I prayed for him and I said
[10:43] go and believe are you with me
[10:50] there was power there to set him free
[10:53] and he kind of walked away with a
[10:55] miracle but God challenges us to believe
[11:00] here's what it is it's easy to feel the
[11:03] power of God to see when you believe it
[11:05] he said but when it comes to a showdown
[11:08] are you able to possess the thing that
[11:13] you profess that you have this is a
[11:19] powerful statement I want you to get it
[11:20] and when it comes to a showdown are you
[11:25] able to possess the thing that you
[11:28] profess that you have I want you to
[11:31] understand tonight Satan he don't Bluff
[11:34] easy
[11:36] he knows whether you got it or not
[11:43] little Ouya the thing of it is brother
[11:46] we gotta get it we gotta take it it's
[11:51] ours but you have to fight for every
[11:56] inch of the ground
[11:57] Joshua fought for every inch of the
[12:00] ground from one of them once end of the
[12:02] country to the other but he had a
[12:05] promise that God said I give it to you
[12:07] he said whether there's Giants whether
[12:11] there's atheists whether there's
[12:13] infidels whether there's coal former
[12:15] churches what difference does it make
[12:17] God give us a promise let's take it it's
[12:21] ours it belongs to us it's our
[12:24] possession let's go get it it belongs to
[12:27] us don't be afraid don't stay back and
[12:31] say well I believe the days of miracles
[12:34] is past and oh I don't know I don't know
[12:37] what I don't do that then he says he
[12:41] said that don't look like a child of
[12:43] Abraham no matter how far along the
[12:46] promise seemed to hold out well it went
[12:50] for 25 years but instead of Abraham
[12:53] getting weak
[12:55] he got stronger Oh hallelujah
[13:02] the raptures on time the resurrection is
[13:07] own time when Lazarus was in a tomb let
[13:12] me just say when Jesus showed up he was
[13:14] on time but instead of Abraham didn't
[13:23] weaker he got stronger all the time for
[13:26] he knowed it it'd be a greater miracle
[13:29] all the time and will be prayed for one
[13:33] night and the next morning we got a bad
[13:36] stomach or maybe we'll say maybe I never
[13:39] got my healing have to go through the
[13:43] prayer line again you call yourself a
[13:46] son of Abraham or a child of Abraham he
[13:48] said God made a promise God gave the
[13:54] promise and you believe it I don't care
[13:59] what takes place it's yours for fight
[14:04] the devil on every ounce of ground that
[14:08] he stands on walk over and take it take
[14:11] the sword of the word God's promises is
[14:15] true nothing can stop it they're God's
[14:21] promises he give us the promise that he
[14:24] that that that that just like he did for
[14:27] the children of Israel the Pentecostal
[14:30] church has come - okay - marnya are we
[14:33] able can we do it
[14:34] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[14:37] and forever can we walk up there and
[14:40] take a hold of God's promise and say
[14:43] it's the truth I claim it I own it God
[14:50] gave it to me remember Jesus conquered
[14:56] sickness he conquered temptation when
[15:00] the enemy spit in his face and smote his
[15:03] jaw and he turned to the other side when
[15:05] they jerked the beer
[15:06] from his face and spit on him he never
[15:08] replied back he conquered the gate of
[15:12] temptation we read this to you last
[15:16] night I wanted to keep this in your mind
[15:18] over these next couple of weeks and
[15:20] these signs shall follow them that
[15:22] believe I am a believer that's where I
[15:27] benefi I am a believer whether I'm
[15:33] having a good day or a bad day that
[15:35] Metin matter all the fluff of life
[15:38] doesn't matter
[15:39] oh brother on but I'm having a bad week
[15:41] I'm still a believer I'm having a bad
[15:45] day I'm still a believer God knew I'd
[15:49] have a bad day but he's got to have
[15:52] somebody in this day that knew the
[15:54] circles God knew the circumstances was
[15:57] coming on and he still got believers
[16:05] hallelujah
[16:06] Paul wrote almost the New Testament from
[16:11] a dungeon not a plush comfortable suite
[16:15] to where that he'd have all the luxuries
[16:18] or a personal or personal attendant to
[16:20] take him and bring him coffee and
[16:22] candies every time that he got a little
[16:24] bit hungry from a dungeon he would write
[16:29] some of the most powerful words that's
[16:31] given to humanity today if God be for us
[16:36] who can be against us are you with me
[16:44] maybe to the outside I you were looking
[16:47] at the mortal play and the mortal
[16:49] situation it doesn't matter what the
[16:51] mortal clay said we've got a promise of
[16:53] God
[16:57] hallelujah brother Jonathan maybe you
[16:59] can adjust that up a couple degrees if
[17:01] you would he says Paul said this and I
[17:07] was with you in weakness and in fear and
[17:13] in much trembling let me just let me
[17:17] just let you know this fear is mentioned
[17:19] 600 times in the scripture it's not a
[17:26] myth it's not an illusion your human
[17:31] body is going to understand fear but God
[17:36] gave you a word greater than fear Oh
[17:43] hallelujah Oh hallelujah
[17:46] notice I just read it these signs shall
[17:49] follow them that believe in my name so
[17:52] that gives us authority in my name shall
[17:56] they cast out devils and they shall
[17:59] speak with new tongues and they shall
[18:01] take up serpents and if they drink any
[18:03] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[18:07] shall lay hands on the sick I want you
[18:10] to understand it doesn't say preachers
[18:12] prophets believe us mamas when your
[18:18] babies get sick and it's got a fever
[18:20] brown you have authority in the name of
[18:22] Jesus Christ you're at work and you're a
[18:26] situation to where you can't call your
[18:28] neighbour you got a high priest that can
[18:32] be touched with the feeling of your
[18:33] infirmity take your pen and write the
[18:37] check
[18:38] speak to the situation react to the
[18:41] moment that's made you and bill tune to
[18:45] respond to the challenge of the hour
[18:51] Alleluia the scripture first Kirk John
[18:55] chapter 3 and verse 2 beloved now are we
[18:59] the sons of God
[19:05] hallelujah now are we the sons of God
[19:10] not some day or some wishing day now are
[19:15] we the sons of God claim your promise
[19:19] first John chapter 4 and verse 4 ye are
[19:23] of God little children and have overcome
[19:27] them because greater is He that is in
[19:31] you greater is He that is in you than he
[19:41] that is in the world are you with me now
[19:47] you're built for the challenge God knew
[19:51] what you would need to overcome in this
[19:54] day so we had win in his free planning
[19:57] he knew what kind of artillery that you
[20:00] would have to have and you see God
[20:02] doesn't evolve because he never has a
[20:04] new thought every 10 years he doesn't
[20:07] have to update his program he's not like
[20:11] your computer in a few days you got to
[20:13] download a new iOS system for your
[20:16] iPhone God never has had to change his
[20:20] word ever he's God he's infinite never
[20:23] had a new thought and so when he was
[20:28] giving you a weapon that you can
[20:31] overcome in your day it's not time
[20:34] sensitive and it don't run out like your
[20:38] milk or your eggs does God's Word work
[20:41] for Abraham it worked for Noah
[20:44] it worked for Paul it worked for brother
[20:47] branham it'll work for you
[20:52] [Applause]
[20:59] got predestinated this moment I want you
[21:02] to think for just a moment you are a
[21:05] fresh round draft choice in God's mind
[21:11] are you with me men spend millions and
[21:15] millions of dollars into the billions of
[21:18] dollars trying to find a Kentucky Derby
[21:20] winner and they're only looking for
[21:23] potential looking for that right one
[21:26] that's got it all are you with me and
[21:29] even in having the right size horse and
[21:32] the right you can't measure a heart in
[21:37] all of the millions of dollars you can't
[21:39] measure a heart you can't measure desire
[21:44] you can't measure that when God
[21:47] deposited what he deposited only inside
[21:50] of you he's not in the if program he's
[21:57] not in the if he knows what he deposited
[22:01] down on the inside of you you're the
[22:04] spoken word of the original seed you are
[22:09] Christ the mystery of this day you are
[22:15] the fulfillment of things that are to be
[22:28] you remember me telling you this story
[22:30] for years I was in Alaska preaching a
[22:35] meeting and they asked me to come down
[22:40] and after the meeting was over asked me
[22:43] if I'd like to go fishing I've never
[22:45] been a fisherman really I'm not I'm not
[22:49] not because I don't like it it just the
[22:52] opportunity hasn't been there a whole
[22:54] lot for me we don't live around great
[22:56] big lakes we got rivers and that kind of
[22:59] thing but just never been
[23:02] I loved hunting but and never
[23:04] but the the knack for fishin I like to
[23:07] fish for men now I really like it and I
[23:15] found myself in uh in the Alaskan it's a
[23:19] it's a it's a Kenai River and a Russian
[23:21] River I know kind of come together and
[23:23] I'm standing with a with the brother
[23:27] named Don babblers and he was a short
[23:29] man like myself and he was standing on
[23:31] her he was standing in the water with me
[23:33] and we had to have waiters on they had
[23:35] to be out in the river the river was
[23:37] swift and all of you know how how I
[23:39] enjoy water anyway and so this Swift
[23:43] River and it's just crazy cold coming
[23:45] off those glaciers and and we're fishing
[23:47] for those those salmon as they pass by
[23:50] and I'm standing there and I'm standing
[23:53] beside of a man and he's fishing and
[23:55] there's a god just over his shoulder and
[23:57] and this guy's telling him where to fish
[24:00] and he was throwing his lure and we're
[24:02] lying doll you know we're just all of us
[24:04] are lined up and down you just as far as
[24:05] your eye can see was people in the river
[24:08] and this guy was telling him where to
[24:10] throw his fish throw his hook he was
[24:12] throwing in the same hole I was and
[24:16] after a little while I asked him I said
[24:18] what are you playing that guy and he
[24:19] said well it's a $5,000 trip I said
[24:24] really you're throwing in the same hole
[24:27] that I'm throwing in he said what did
[24:29] you pay I said ten dollars as it would
[24:35] turn out we caught the same thing
[24:36] neither one of us caught anything
[24:44] brother Don baptists was standing on
[24:46] this side and he you know he got kind of
[24:48] a little bit bored with fishing do you
[24:50] know him and he said brother run he said
[24:52] I was fishing here one day and I was
[24:53] talking to a fisherman and he said to
[24:56] this God and he said he said he told me
[24:58] a story that you might find interesting
[25:00] and he said there was an eagle that was
[25:03] flying over top of this and he said now
[25:05] Eagles are fast birds but they have
[25:08] predators too and said this Hawk was
[25:11] picking on this eagle in because he
[25:13] could he can fly more direct and
[25:16] and he just flied out and he was at this
[25:18] eagle and he would back on him and he
[25:20] and he was just pestered him and
[25:22] pestered him and pester Eamon and and so
[25:24] after a while he said he said he hid
[25:28] this eagle in the back of the head and
[25:30] that eagle started terminal tumbling and
[25:32] tumbling and tumbling like this right
[25:34] here and he's he tumbled and he said I
[25:36] thought I was gonna watch that Eagle
[25:37] perish and he said just before he hit
[25:40] the water he said I saw his head shake
[25:43] itself and he said his wings and when he
[25:49] came to himself he tore that Hulk to
[25:52] pieces
[25:56] [Applause]
[26:00] I want you to understand your eagle and
[26:06] you might get knocked out once in a
[26:08] while but when you come to yourself and
[26:11] you realize who you are and the devil
[26:16] might challenge you hold on over and
[26:18] over again but when you come to yourself
[26:21] and you realize who you are how do I
[26:42] love you I think sometimes we just need
[26:45] to let go and let God have his way I
[26:49] think sometimes we need to get beyond
[26:51] ourselves and our our realm of thinking
[26:54] and this is who I am God built you to be
[26:57] an overcomer of this day every one of us
[27:05] have a mountain in our life every one of
[27:08] us do your neighbor cannot speak to your
[27:15] Mountain like you can we can pray for
[27:19] one another and uplift one another but
[27:21] you got to speak to your Mountain you
[27:25] remember that little grain of sound that
[27:27] we talked about last night you may not
[27:29] see your mouth to move immediately but
[27:31] when you speak to it a grain of sand
[27:33] rolls over are you with me now we should
[27:45] ask ourselves what is in our hands I
[27:49] think sometimes we don't realize what
[27:51] really is in our hands we had the most
[27:55] powerful message has ever been delivered
[27:58] to humankind we are the final voice to
[28:01] the final age we are an invincible army
[28:05] we are bone of his bone life of his life
[28:08] power of his power
[28:10] where everything that got thought that
[28:12] we would be and what he deposited on the
[28:14] inside of us but because of our human
[28:19] shell that is around us that ever
[28:23] constantly reminds of your humanity why
[28:26] don't you remind him that God put
[28:30] something eternal on the inside of me
[28:33] and doled this outward man perish the
[28:37] inward man is renewed day by day
[28:46] [Applause]
[28:52] we sing songs when we come here to
[28:54] church there's a reason we do that
[28:57] there's a reason God ordained that to be
[29:01] because singing songs is a live
[29:04] testimony of God's work we sing the song
[29:09] when the redeemed are gathering in and
[29:13] we sing it with enthusiasm because we
[29:19] believe I'm one of those redeemed and
[29:23] we're headed for a gathering
[29:25] I wonder if we'd stop and listen to how
[29:28] we sing sometimes last night I told you
[29:30] about you have to be inspired to read
[29:33] God's inspired word for it to come to
[29:35] life I wonder if we would listen to our
[29:42] singing well I am thinking of a rapture
[29:49] in that blessed
[29:59] oh yes oh yes ah I'm not talking about
[30:12] how good you can sing how bad you could
[30:14] say I'm talking about whether it's
[30:16] coming from your heart do you really
[30:21] believe it we get a couple hundred of
[30:26] you in here do you start singing from
[30:27] your heart and it's beyond entertainment
[30:30] beyond beyond your humanity beyond your
[30:36] back weak in your bad day and you come
[30:39] in your start releasing the power of the
[30:41] spoken word till your lips and we begin
[30:44] to sing and we begin to dance and the
[30:47] Spirit of God you see when Jesus said
[31:01] peace be still a very powerful storm had
[31:09] a rose and the author and the finisher
[31:12] of our faith spoke to that story and in
[31:17] a few seconds that C was like glass and
[31:22] the ones that were around him said never
[31:25] a man speak like
[31:31] I pray that the people that work with
[31:33] you that that live in your world that
[31:36] they can see you speak to your storms
[31:41] I'm regardless of the things that's
[31:43] going on you take God's Word and
[31:46] sometimes you may not be able to quote
[31:49] it but you go back and you go to God's
[31:51] Word in you you put on the query of
[31:53] God's Word and you say I want to find
[31:55] out what it says about that because in
[31:59] my feeble words I don't know what to say
[32:01] but when I take God's words and I speak
[32:05] to my situation you got a question about
[32:09] where women go to what God says about it
[32:22] some people go to forty-two different
[32:24] people to get the answer that they're
[32:26] looking for I have no faith in that kind
[32:31] of a deal I go to what God says I go to
[32:36] what God said and the gut that said
[32:38] peace be still and in just seconds that
[32:41] sea became glass I'll take that when he
[32:47] told the sick be healed he didn't pray a
[32:51] 42 minute prayer oh brother on I would
[33:00] love to walked in brother branham's
[33:02] prayer line have you stopped to listen
[33:04] to that sometime have you have you
[33:07] stopped to listen to that brother ramble
[33:10] sometimes tell a story about the woman
[33:12] at the well and she recognized who was
[33:15] there or he'll he'll talk about the
[33:17] raising of Lazarus and then are you the
[33:20] patient and then if the Lord would show
[33:23] me to get your faith - and he'll tell me
[33:26] if you're just if you know if you
[33:33] believe me to be God's prophet what was
[33:36] he doing it wasn't brother branham's
[33:37] faith he was trying to get their faith
[33:40] you know their standing standing
[33:42] something between you can feel it now
[33:44] their son their standing something
[33:46] between you and I that's him don't be
[33:49] nervous that's him
[33:52] I'm not sure he'll or he's your healer
[33:55] what he was asked him that to do even
[33:57] from that service I just read to you
[33:59] this one this morning we had a
[34:01] tremendous service we shouted we danced
[34:03] and a person came to be prayed for and I
[34:07] told him go and believe go and believe
[34:12] well
[34:14] well brother on brother branham could
[34:15] have spoke them to be healed many people
[34:18] they were but for the most of them they
[34:21] were challenged to go and believe
[34:24] brother Branham said when he was
[34:26] standing there speaking those squirrels
[34:28] how many squirrels do you want I want
[34:30] three and he said God challenged me to
[34:36] believe and I accepted his challenge if
[34:42] God said these things about us let's
[34:44] accept the challenge when Jesus walked
[34:52] to the tomb and he called for his friend
[34:54] to come forth from the tomb he didn't
[34:58] pray if it be your will he called for
[35:02] Lazarus by name and brother Dan said
[35:05] being the voice of the resurrection
[35:07] had he not called him by name there
[35:09] would have been a general resurrection
[35:17] jesus said some powerful words and for
[35:24] lasses these were incredibly powerful
[35:27] Lazarus come forth
[35:30] and so from another dimension he began
[35:34] to testify I hear his voice now and I
[35:38] gotta go roll the stone away by now Lord
[35:46] he stinketh the roll the stone away
[35:50] sometimes he challenges us to use our
[35:53] faith brother Benham didn't walk over
[35:57] our Jesus didn't walk over and help them
[36:00] move the stone he challenged them
[36:02] because them moving the stone showed
[36:06] their faith hallelujah sometimes you're
[36:12] going to have to roll the stone brethren
[36:15] I want the preacher to do it the
[36:17] preacher can only preach the word and
[36:19] challenge you to believe but you've
[36:20] gotta roll some stones
[36:23] [Applause]
[36:38] jesus said I and my father a one
[36:43] you see that's what got him crucified
[36:47] when he told them that I am the word the
[36:50] I am the I am the I am is in me I am the
[36:57] human body to which God has chose to
[37:02] feel all of his fullness the prophets
[37:06] were God in portion Jesus was the
[37:10] fullness of the Godhead bodily when this
[37:15] message becomes more than a message by
[37:18] association but you're the Word made
[37:20] flesh more than books and tapes and
[37:23] pictures on the wall I am a believer
[37:32] [Applause]
[37:34] [Music]
[37:43] jesus said I have power to lay my life
[37:46] down and power to take it up again he
[37:52] was quoting what the word said are you
[37:56] with me he was quoting what the word
[37:58] said we can say I'm as good as wrap
[38:02] shirt because that's what the word said
[38:05] about me I will get a resurrection
[38:08] because that's what the word said about
[38:10] me regardless of how I feel I'm healed
[38:16] are you with me tonight hallelujah I
[38:20] don't chicken Deuteronomy chapter 31 in
[38:33] verse 6 notice the positiveness of this
[38:38] scripture be strong and of good courage
[38:48] fear not nor be afraid of them for the
[38:55] LORD thy God
[38:57] he it is that death go with thee brother
[39:05] on but that was - Joshua Willett
[39:12] that's the way you can read it but he's
[39:16] an I am God he's an ever-present God
[39:20] when he laid out a prescription that's
[39:22] the way it is I want you to read this
[39:24] with me tonight
[39:25] and I want you to say this is for me be
[39:32] strong
[39:33] and of a good courage fear not not be
[39:40] afraid of them for the Lord thy God he
[39:44] it is that death go with me he will not
[39:49] fail thee nor forsake thee
[40:00] I preached this at brother Tim Bruce our
[40:10] brother Kelley's so maybe this will be
[40:13] good I didn't preach this sermon there
[40:14] had I been giving this sermon there I'd
[40:16] have preached this sermon in there but
[40:18] it got I got this this week so you're
[40:20] getting it this week but brother Branham
[40:24] says it was like a man that had that
[40:27] three-cornered stick of course he talked
[40:32] about that denominational Trinitarian
[40:34] spirit said he would grab the woman by
[40:36] the nape of the neck and he would beat
[40:37] him and he would beat that woman and if
[40:40] she would get up he beat that woman back
[40:42] down again
[40:44] he'd beat that woman back down again and
[40:48] he he began to think if I could only
[40:50] help and all the sudden he began to
[40:54] believe who he was
[40:57] and he said his faith muscles begin to
[41:00] grow and the bigger he got the smaller
[41:03] that man got and he took he said I
[41:07] thought that woman was my mother but
[41:09] that was with my daddy and he said then
[41:12] I realized it was a church but too many
[41:16] times we had battered woman or battered
[41:18] men or battered life syndrome and we
[41:21] went through the the torments of life
[41:23] and we're constantly living life at
[41:26] regrets we've all had bad things happen
[41:30] to us we've all had horrible things
[41:33] happen to us but putting those things
[41:36] behind put it behind forget I said this
[41:51] day I'll say this now life's too short
[41:54] to live in torment
[41:57] if you live a hundred years old and live
[42:01] and live in torment I would rather live
[42:03] by myself than live in torment don't get
[42:06] mad at me life is too short to live and
[42:18] total them and don't go give us a
[42:22] license go and get remarried but life's
[42:24] too short
[42:27] don't let the devil beat you around all
[42:30] the time
[42:31] I want to home this filled with peace I
[42:34] want to tell them that's filled with
[42:36] courage it's kind of home I got a home
[42:38] that's filled with courage and faith and
[42:41] and response to the Word of God it's my
[42:44] sanctuary
[42:46] on the earth where I live in a tent or I
[42:49] live in a castle
[42:50] God's welcome at my house and it's for
[42:54] me in my house we will serve the Lord
[42:59] [Applause]
[43:11] Satan will put a trap for you if you're
[43:13] not careful but I want to ask you how
[43:16] long will you live with that trap I've
[43:26] been a Christian a long time now I've
[43:29] been a preacher a long time I want to
[43:32] understand many I've seen many with
[43:34] habits and weaknesses in their life but
[43:37] the day that you fall out of love with
[43:40] that weakness and you start hating that
[43:44] sin that's actually destroying you cuffs
[43:50] in will destroy it's got a payday and
[43:54] that seeing pace top dollar
[44:01] in Virginia where we've got wine farms

[44:16] not coming it's here are you anything
[44:20] can't make money on Caterpie don't cheat
[44:23] but you can make it on marijuana cuz sin
[44:27] still pays top dollar and insanity
[44:31] reigns in the world but it does not have
[44:34] to reign in your life if Jesus is the
[44:37] king of your life you can speak to that
[44:41] weakness and say I'm not put up with you
[44:44] now mo you're a man's were better a
[44:50] little while ago but I'll take the ones
[44:51] that you squeaked out just now there was
[45:02] a time that Cinderella in the story had
[45:05] to live in the act there was a time that
[45:09] she wore raggedy clothes there was a
[45:13] time
[45:17] there was a time that she that she
[45:20] supposedly mocked and made that and they
[45:23] made fun of her but that time come to an
[45:26] end to where that she was the princess
[45:30] wife help me preach there was a time
[45:35] that you look like you are aliens from
[45:39] the Commonwealth of God and you look
[45:42] like you were insane and you look like
[45:44] you was on your way to a devil's hell
[45:46] but that seed came to life on the inside
[45:50] of you and you recognize I'm one of the
[45:54] Alma and the proud of Jesus Christ
[46:00] [Applause]
[46:19] I'm not The Devil's whipping post
[46:26] [Applause]
[46:40] hallelujah Moses prayed and the greatest
[46:50] soldiers in the world became fish food
[46:57] Daniel prayed and the lands that were in
[47:00] the den that we're going to eat him
[47:03] stood and could not consume him but
[47:08] those same lines ate the men that
[47:11] accused him Elijah prayed and became the
[47:16] greatest athlete in the world and ran
[47:19] faster 40 miles than the best horses of
[47:22] Israel brother random said that prayer
[47:30] is the most powerful weapon that was
[47:31] ever put in the control of human beings
[47:33] there's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb
[47:37] as powerful as prayer prayer will change
[47:41] the mind of God the scripture said no
[47:45] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[47:47] prosper
[47:49] but you have to recognize what has came
[47:52] against you is nothing but a trick I
[47:56] won't be long now you hang with me who
[48:00] has the most power before God and you've
[48:02] heard me quote this a hundred times but
[48:04] I want to I want you to I want you to
[48:05] get it who has the most power before God
[48:09] an angel
[48:11] that's a servant they're his servants
[48:15] what are you you're a son and daughter
[48:19] who has the most power in heaven then a
[48:22] sinner that's been saved by grace or an
[48:25] archangel that's standing by his right
[48:28] side and then he answers the question
[48:31] the sinner that's been saved by grace
[48:33] has more authority in heaven than an
[48:37] archangel that stood by his side without
[48:40] sin because he's a son
[48:43] asan has more authority then a servant
[48:47] does now I want I want to bring this to
[48:54] you for angels brother branham said
[49:00] stopped the world war for stop the world
[49:11] war every time I see 11:11 on a clock
[49:16] I'm reminded that God stopped the war
[49:21] 11:11 exactly right on time they didn't
[49:27] even understand what stops it or there
[49:31] would be no flesh God had a promise in
[49:33] the book it had to come to pass you and
[49:35] I hadn't been born yet most of us and
[49:38] listen God couldn't let that war go any
[49:41] further so he sent four angels and they
[49:44] stopped the law the United States didn't
[49:50] stop it Germany didn't stop it Europe
[49:52] didn't stop it four angel stopped the
[49:54] law three men were headed to a to a to a
[50:00] fiery furnace and they heated it up
[50:03] seven times hotter to which even the
[50:06] guards that stood by the door were
[50:08] consumed with it wormwood said let me go
[50:12] down I'll change it I destroyed the
[50:14] whole earth with water let me go I
[50:16] changed I white babbling off the face of
[50:18] the earth
[50:20] Gabriel said let me go I'll change the
[50:24] whole situation
[50:25] God said I've been watching all night
[50:27] long I'm not gonna let you go I'm gonna
[50:33] go myself brother Brennan said he called
[50:36] a clown and a zig zag lightning and he
[50:40] went into the fire that's where he will
[50:43] meet you
[50:46] [Music]
[50:47] [Applause]
[51:02] Amram and Jochebed knew that the
[51:05] deliverance was at hand and then there
[51:09] knowing that deliverance as his hand
[51:11] some God just kept putting it in their
[51:13] heart it's time for deliverance we've
[51:15] been here 400 years it's time for
[51:17] deliverance God met Abraham in the form
[51:21] of Melchizedek and he told us and we
[51:25] would be here this belief of tongue and
[51:27] it's time for deliverance brother
[51:29] Branham said in teaching on Moses that
[51:32] Amram would go into his little addict
[51:34] and there he was met by an angel and he
[51:40] was met by an angel you ever find that
[51:44] in the book you ever found it I've been
[51:50] a Bible study here all my life
[51:53] but a prophet that knew that Eve had
[51:55] blonde hair well brother Arne was just
[52:03] making up a story really that knew that
[52:09] that knew that Barton has climbed itself
[52:13] up in a truth that nobody with me not
[52:18] bartimaeus help me here Zacchaeus
[52:20] climbed his shelf up a tree knew that it
[52:22] did and watch how he got in the tree
[52:25] well brother on brother man was watching
[52:26] making up a story let me just say this
[52:28] year was he when he told the woman that
[52:32] she got off of the bus because of her
[52:35] nurten
[52:36] her nervous condition that had been all
[52:38] these years he said I see you as a
[52:40] little girl and you got off of the bus
[52:42] and a dog chased you down the road God
[52:47] knows how to rewind 40 years to tell you
[52:51] what's going on here today and then
[52:54] fast-forward that tomorrow you're going
[52:56] to be well the God that can rewind 40
[53:00] years that can go back to the Garden of
[53:02] Eden
[53:03] I'd say Eve was blond-headed the baby
[53:11] was borned and they were killing
[53:13] thousands of babies killing a generation
[53:16] trying to get rid of that baby and
[53:20] brother branham said God just simply
[53:22] pull one over on them and allowed them
[53:25] to train Moses and educate Moses and
[53:29] take care of Moses stupid devil the
[53:37] devil can't touch a hair of your head
[53:38] until God gives him permission
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:55] they were given instructions to take
[53:58] this baby and put it into a
[54:00] crocodile-infested now they built a
[54:06] certain type of a bulrush and put tar on
[54:09] it place the baby down inside of it let
[54:12] me say this to you it was better
[54:15] protected there than in their arms and
[54:20] brother Brennan said God call for
[54:23] Gabriel and ten thousand angels to line
[54:27] up and down the that--now river and he
[54:31] gave Gabriel specific instructions just
[54:33] stand on the on that bull rush on that
[54:37] down that basket and every time a
[54:40] crocodile come up he said put your foot
[54:43] on that crocodiles nose and he said
[54:46] whenever he get into the world pools
[54:48] which you're going to get in some
[54:50] whirlpools in life you see that he did
[54:53] side of it you're better protected - not
[55:01] hilarious I say this to you we are not
[55:05] alone last couple of weeks they've been
[55:17] having a gathering of area 51 trying to
[55:24] explain UFOs you had a prophet stood
[55:28] about that tall explain what those UFOs
[55:30] were that they were investigating angels
[55:36] have got don't worry about do they have
[55:41] their body out yonder somewhere another
[55:46] come on church Lou it seemed spooky to
[55:50] me whether you know it or not there's
[55:52] thousands of angels that are standing
[55:54] this building to watch over top of you
[55:57] you are not alone
[56:08] I don't have the time to tell you how
[56:17] much power that's given to them and they
[56:20] carry out their orders they've been
[56:22] carrying them out since the eternities
[56:24] and they will continue to carry those
[56:25] orders out but you were a son
[56:34] you were a daughter and you've got more
[56:38] power with God than those angels the
[56:44] angel that was riding on the bull rush
[56:46] to which nobody could see but he was
[56:48] there the angel that's watching over
[56:50] your car and he's there I can't see him
[56:54] don't matter if I can see him or not
[56:55] he's there the angel is standing with
[57:00] you in the dentist's chair the anger
[57:04] that's walks into your doctor's visit
[57:07] that walks into your courtroom that goes
[57:10] to school with you you have more power
[57:19] than the angels of God but the BrahMos
[57:34] had just killed a 42-inch caribou it had
[57:40] been a vision for about two years
[57:47] brother bud didn't he think such an
[57:49] animal was in the woods but he told it
[57:52] he believed it
[57:55] my brother branham was looking across
[57:58] the film that there he is
[58:01] brother gladden knew that he couldn't
[58:03] reverse across those rocks they were
[58:05] shale rocks they were too slick to run
[58:09] across brother Ram said that's the way
[58:12] the angel told us me to go he said here
[58:14] we go
[58:18] come on church after they kill it in the
[58:22] end Blaine puts his hands down on it and
[58:24] it fulfills the vision and brother head
[58:26] he's standing there in that green
[58:27] checkered shirt we've heard that story
[58:30] hundreds and hundreds of times in their
