have my wife sister Lydia and my entire family my children with me this weekend we're looking forward to a good time in the Lord and we're just so thankful to be amongst friends again so God bless you if you don't mind I'm going to read from three places it may be a little lengthy but I I believe it'll help us set up what we're W to speak tonight I'm going to read Matthew 13:53 through 58 and then we're going to turn to Mark 10 after that says and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these Parables he departed then and when he was coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these Mighty works is not this the carpenter son is not his mother called Mary and his his Brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things and they were offended in him but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief we're going to look over in Mark 10 and verse 46 Mark 10 and verse 46 we'll read down through verse 52 it says and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind barus the son of timus set by the highways side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still how many would like him to stand still for your need tonight and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him What wilt thou that I should do unto thee the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith ha made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way if you would I'd like to turn to one more place Luke 23 Luke 23 and verse 39 thank you for your patience it says and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying dust thou not fear God seeing Thou Art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing aiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest and into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise can we pray together Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful Lord for this opportunity Lord and and we are very keenly aware at this moment of your presence in this place and Lord we we fully believe that that you've given us a word to speak here tonight Lord so we're just going to step aside now Lord and allow you Lord to speak your word Lord I pray that not only will I be anointed Lord but every listener will be anointed Lord the hearer and the receiver of it tonight Lord that it can have its complete and full effect in our lives father we commit it all to your hands now and just ask you to speak father and have your way in Jesus name amen and amen may God bless you as as you take your seats I'd like to speak to you for a a bit tonight on the thought recognizing your opportunity in his presence recognizing your opportunity in his presence and and as we read here it it was three seemingly unrelated stories from three different books of the Bible but but the way these ties together tonight for the sake of of our message is that we saw three opportunities we saw three different opportunities there in Matthew we see them as we began reading he's in his hometown and we see them absolutely astounded by him not only in his teachings but you know the works and the way he was is teaching in the synagogue and yet one verse later they go from astounded to doubt one moment from this is amazing how can this be in the very next moment they're in doubt because they began to focus on why this couldn't be God they begin to focus on why this couldn't be and and why something could be wrong and I want to tell you even in a service if you want to figure out why it couldn't be God if you want to overlook how God's moving in a service and you want to find fault in a service or or or Reason away what's happening before your very eyes it's actually easy to do we can look at things and explain it away or or look at somebody's victory dance and say well I know how that person lives so so that couldn't be God so so so it's easy to explain away God if we're not careful and because they couldn't recognize who it was in their midst then they were unable to believe even though they heard and even though they saw what was happening we've moved M on into Mark and we we find a desperate blind man and we know him as as blind barus who recognizes his opportunity although he witnessed nothing although he had heard nothing and because he's able to believe even because his faith Rises we find a completely different outcome it's not the story of I couldn't heal him but because of his faith we find him healed and completely made whole and then finally in Luke we we come to the well-known story of the theves that are hanging on the cross next to Jesus both of them are are at the end of the line both at the end of their rope so to speak and and both of them wretched and miserable people and yet both of them brother Andrew with the exact same opportunity it was their opportunity in his presence now I want to go ahead and say this right here your opportunity in his presence may not be in an ideal situation this wasn't the ideal place to have this opportunity and yet it was their opportunity nonetheless it was their moment it was their time with the Savior it was their opportunity with the one with eternal life this was their chance this was their opportunity and one is conscious of his need and he recognized whose presence he is that he's in and because of that he dies and we finally goes to heaven because of that his life was just beginning but then we find another one who is unconscious of whose presence he's in and because he's unaware and he doesn't recognize his opportunity then he dies and go to hell notice your lack of recognition does not mean it wasn't your opportunity just because you leave a service and I didn't feel anything and I didn't this and I didn't doesn't mean he didn't walk past your Pew it doesn't mean your name wasn't called it doesn't mean it wasn't your opportunity but you have to recognize your opport unity in his presence and I just go ahead and tell you right now whether you recognize it or not tonight is an opportunity in his presence right now is a moment that you can have with the King tonight can be your time this is an opportunity in his presence we must be a people that recognize God in our midst and recognize our opportunities time after time you can go through it there's over a thousand quotes where brother BR talk about being uh aware being conscious and recognizing and so time after time he talks about recognizing his presence he he he talks about being aware of his presence and he would tell the people you've got to be conscious of God but see that's exactly what Satan doesn't want to happen he doesn't want you to be conscious of God he doesn't want you to recognize that whatever situation you're in today that God is there he wants you to feel like God isn't there God's A Million Miles Away or God has forgotten me and the prophet saying be God conscious he's here be God conscious he's in the trial he's right there with you and the reason the devil don't want you to know he's there is because when God's there so is Victory God is in your trial so Victory is in your trial healing is right there Deliverance is right there that that prodal coming home it's right there because God is here and we got to be God conscious God is always near and so Victory is always near amen and our battle today is to be God conscious in a world that has put him completely out of their thinking God conscious in a world that has put him completely away from their Consciousness they don't even acknowledge his existence much less his presence right now currently working amen and and I think it's obvious I don't have to explain this to you that we live in a an Ever increasingly anti-god Society Church it's not getting better I don't care who they elect it can only get worse it's not going to get better but that doesn't worry us that doesn't frighten us all that does is letting me know oh yep the prophet was right what I believe was right what he taught was the truth it's going to keep going down and down and down but guess what if that's true the other part of the prophecy is true as well we're going to keep going up and up and up and up it doesn't shake us that the world's falling apart he told us the world was falling apart he said it was going to fall apart but he said I'll have a bride I'll have a church without spot wrinkle that's who you are tonight everything's being fulfilled yep so is that I'll have a bride I'm looking at the Fulfillment too many times we say there's going to be there's going to be a bride there's going to be a bride that's wrong there is a bride God hallelujah recognize not only who he is but who you are it's an ever increasing anti-god Society you know when I graduated high school I'm about to age myself 1999 70% of Americans were church members 2020 50% are church members and of that 50% that are members 41% of those actually go to church there ain't many of us left and by us I just mean people going to church I'm counting the Catholics I'm counting everybody there ain't many of us left that's the only time I'm going to say us about them and us in the same sentence we ain't we ain't got many people you mean you wake up you don't know how many times I'd go through a drive-thru sometimes when I'm out preaching in a suit like this pull pull up to the drive-thru window to grab some breakfast or a coffee on the way to church and they'll go where you going they don't know you got to work on Sunday well kind of you know we're going to church oh Church okay church it's far from their thinking it's it's out of their Consciousness it's it's the world we live in has gone so far down and brother Bram says you know it used to be if a woman or a man said that they was a Christian people respected it he said but today they just like to see how much fun they can make out of it now this was 6070 years ago he says see irreverent group my why you know what what's the reason they're not conscious that that's the truth they're not conscious of God but I want to say that in the midst of the most unbelieving time in the midst of an unbelieving World somebody is going to recognize him in their midst some somebody's going to honor him when he moves through the building somebody's going to say that's my king I see him I know him I claim him I'm here to worship him I'm here to live for him somebody's going to lift up his name above all other names and be the final voice to the final age somebody's going to recognize him when he moves and declare there is a living God there is a savior There Is A Healer there is a deliverer and he is the same yesterday today and forever I want to be a part of that voice I want to be a part of the final voice crying out offering mercy and offering Grace and saying get in the ark but in order to do that we have to be in tune with his presence he's not just coming back for a group of people that acknowledge his existence he's not just coming back even forgive me for a group of people that acknowledge that that that Malachi 4 has been fulfilled that recognize that there's been a message in this day but this bride is going to be in tune with the presence of God with the moving of the spirit with God operating in our midst and they're going to be in love with his presence they're going to be in love with his word and they're going to honor him and cry out every time he comes by amen why because his presence is everything to us his presence is everything like MO Moses said in Exodus 33 If thy presence not go not go not with me carry us not up hence Lord I don't want to go without your presence I don't want to service without your presence oh is God going to move every single time I believe he is I hope he does otherwise why am I here why did I show up who's going to help me Lord you alone have the words of life you alone can break my chains you alone Lord move to tonight move here move in this moment Lord Jesus that's our desire Hallelujah a people who long for and recognize his presence amen they're going to be God conscious and conscious here means aware of and responding to one's surroundings painfully aware of and sensitive to amen sensitive to his presence aware of his presence you know before the fall being conscious of God wasn't difficult there in the Garden of Eden Adam never experienced fear Adam never experienced unbelief he had never experienced doubt the the very things that blind us and hinder us from seeing into that spiritual realm did not hinder Adam because they didn't exist and yet it's after the fall in Genesis 3:10 that the word afraid is used for the first time and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself now notice what's Adam been doing he's been running from God and now he's telling God why I was running from him because I was afraid and right in that moment Satan recognizes his weapon to keep people people from being blessed by the presence of God is fear because what fear is going to keep you from doing is it's going to keep you from running to God and it's going to keep you running away from God he saw that fear is going to keep them going the other direction fear is going to keep you hiding fear is going to keep you covering up fear is going to keep you making excuses and he recognizes this and he would and he recognizes fear caused them to hide from the very thing that would deliver you from the very thing that'll set you free it'll cause you to hide from it and because of this in the Bible we see the phrase fear not used over 80 times fear not fear not fear not because God knows what Satan uses God knows is that he uses fear to make you miss your opportunities he uses fear to limit our victories fear is nothing more than a chain that gets placed on your life to limit you from going as far as you were intended to go it keeps you from becoming all that you were called to be I'm not saying you're not a Christian I'm not saying you're not overcoming but he's got that little hold on you that keeps you from blossoming into everything that God saw you before the foundation of the world and he's holding you with that fear and he uses it and you're afraid that he won't forgive you you're afraid that you've gone too far you're afraid to let loose in his presence and let your worship go completely and for some people it's just passing thoughts but for other people fear can be crippling it can hinder them and it can bind them and it robs you of the very Freedom you long for you long for Freedom you desire that freedom you want that Victory but there's that nagging fear it's just trying to hold you right there in the back and it makes you hide from your opportunities and it makes you miss the moment when God's passing by and I'll just say tonight I believe it's time for that fear to end I believe it's time to put a stop to it right now and it's time for those of you that have been tormented by fear to say tonight is the night tonight it is finished tonight it ends I'm drawing a Line in the Sand I'm walking out of the prison cell the doors are open listen don't just think it in your mind let the devil know you can't hold me I'm not staying here you can't stop me the sail do is open I'm coming out tonight because the deliverer is here I recognize the Conqueror is in our midst he's here he's the one he's opened the door now you got to walk out tonight's the night this is your opportunity don't let him pass you by I don't care what it is complexes anxiety fear call it what is it's a devil doesn't make you a sinner doesn't make you defeated it's just something he's holding over your life that you don't have to to let him hold over your life you can be completely free of it tonight you are not that complex that's not you are not that family cycle that's not who you are I mean don't you know that's why when you go to the doctor they want to know your daddy's family history because what your daddy was gets passed down to you I don't mind telling the devil my daddy's family history he conquers you from the beginning he conquered you at Calvary he's conquered you down Through the Ages my dad conquered you and I'm here to conquer you it's in my DNA it's who I am I'm a devil defeater I'm an overcomer I'm a conqueror and tonight you lose hallelujah hallelujah glory to God there ain't nothing wrong with family Cycles we just got to start pointing to the right family Cycles my kin folk was in the upper room I'm sorry if I get unruly it's it's a family tradition it's what we do my people's Peter my people that stood up one day and said repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and when you do you're going to get drunk you're going to stumble out in the streets and testify and glorify God and we don't care care our family ain't scared we ain't ashamed we believe in a living God a mighty God and when he comes by it's our opportunity to praise His name hallelujah hallelu hallelujah I got slow down I think I got about another hour to go wear this fat boy out Hallelujah it excites me I'm sorry we've recognized his presence a message has made us God conscious and his presence doesn't cause us to hide anymore but now we can run to him because his presence is what brings us Victory it's the fact that he is here that we are Overcomers amen before Adam fell the voice in the garden the voice of God was a daily occurrence to man his presence was expected every single day as he would come down and walk through the garden and he would fellowship with his children the prophet of God said and they had Fellowship love for one another how the moving of the spirit went through the bushes the Lions came up the Tigers all of them and they worshiped the Lord he said man was conscious at all times that his presence was with him but see what happens in the fall as man is separated from that Consciousness before that man had been Superior to anything on the earth he ruled over the animal life they obeyed him he had Juris uh uh jurisdiction over the Earth the winds obeyed him and brother brandham actually described him as a secondary God upon the Earth everything under Adam obeyed Adam but all of that was lost in the fall because Man became unconscious of it because he lost Fellowship he lost friendship and he lost relationship with God and all the channels that God moved through became clogged up and we know that Jesus came to to cl to unclog and and to restore all that Adam had lost and and Jesus came and showed us how that we could operate he showed how man was supposed to operate before the fall before sin's nature took over this flesh and he came and he spoke to storms he cast out Devils he lived in the Supernatural and He restored all the fellowship that had been lost brother Brown said he brought us back to the Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall and now we know that from there we we go into the first Age and and in the first age things begin to slip again things begin to creep in and the Wolves begin to creep in and they begin to nitpick how the spirit moved in a service they began to to analyze everything and they begin to criticize the people's freedom and and voices of great Renown and and great teachers began to tone down the worship they began to restrict freedom and and over time the channels that had been unclogged came clogged again to where people could no longer recognize his presence and the moving of the spirit began to get label was like that's just emotion because the channels had become clogged up and and man once again lost consciousness of what we were put here to do listen I I love my family I love the life God has given us and and I love all that but God put us here for one purpose to manifest him amen we are here to manifest God upon the Earth and many times man forgets that the prophet of God says it's all become so clogged clogged up until God can't operate through those channels that he made man for now when God made the human body every little part had a place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live and if God so patterned the man the body of a man how much more has he patterned and set in order the body of Christ the church and he's designed us to come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these Supernatural workings of God Outlets through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and Gifts of healing and all these other different gifts is Outlets that God lets out his power and lets out out his Revelation to the people now I don't think that we should Stand By and stand for anything that tries to come in and clog those Outlets up I don't think we should stand by and let anybody come and mess with the faucet and Tamp down on the flow of the things God put in place to manifest his power and give Revelation to the church anybody starts touching the SP and I say ah back off you ain't messing with my with the flow you're not messing with my outlet God's going to manifest through here you can do that in your church you can have your ideas but here it's going to float free it's going to remain unclocked as a matter of fact give me a shovel I'mma dig it out some more give me a shovel I want to open it up wider I want it to come through like a gusher well we just want to direct it this way little no sir we're going to direct it how the Holy Spirit sees fit to direct it in our services I'm just going to get out the way and say flow flow flow have your way Lord hallelujah it's God moving and we got to recognize it as such and not Tamp it down but say hey I see some fire somebody pour some gasoline on that let's blow this thing up let's open the floodgates let's get it hot in here the fellas down a few seats down from me may not feel this heat I want them to experience too I don't just want to keep it up here I don't just want to keep it up here on this row on this row I want it from here out the back door down the street all around the neighborhood they say there's fire burning up there there's something going on in the lighthouse I see the light coming out of it there's life there's fire there's power there's Victory there's something different because we ain't stopping the flow flow Jesus flow Holy Spirit have your way in this place tonight h [Applause] Hallelujah well they're just emotional yep I've never understood people that say that and think I'm gonna argue with them of course we are did anybody say we wasn't well you're just emotional you're right the the prophet said that listen how he says it and it is true that when the Holy Ghost comes down so that's step number one do you not do you want the Holy Ghost to come down when the Holy Ghost comes down it stirs the crowd to emotion oh no oh no they're sitting there Anointed with the spirit of God and the Holy Ghost sweeps across them it stirs emotion it's got to it's got to it's got to well we're not emotional in our church well according to my Louisiana algebra and this equation that just means the Holy Ghost isn't sweeping through the building at your church because he said when it sweeps you get emotional it's it's got to it's got to it's got to why he said because they're Anointed with the spirit of God I can't help this it stirs me up it's got [Applause] to see the problem is you just see the emotion but you fail to see why they emotion because you fail to recognize him now sure you recognize him then you see what he used to do you recognize it back there but we have to be God conscious now aware that he's moving now and that's always been man's fa failure they always point back to what God did and they always Point ahead to what God's going to do they fail to recognize that he is the I am God the everpresent help the same yesterday today and forever right now you know it's like in that scripture I almost wonder if they read it Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever don't leave out the Today part because I'm thankful he was I'm thankful he is he's the Alpha and Omega but if he ain't the today he can't help me cuz I got to have God today I need Victory today I need overcoming power today I need him to move in my family today I must have him today so that first church burst forth from Pentecost and they were alive in the Supernatural they were filled with the Holy Ghost and miracles were happening daily because Jesus had had had brought back and he had returned what Adam had lost and just I I kind of hit this for a second but to say it again we know that nickan ISM began to creep in and Men began to try to control the moving of the spirit and and Men be to try to order it out of the congregation and by so doing it placed all the spiritual gifts in the ministry how convenient and they began to order it out of the congregation and it choked the life out of the church and Order became more important than births order became more important than Allowing God to move and that church began to fall away and we know that they went down into death but God was determined I'm going to have a bride I'm going to have a church that doesn't just honor me in in their sayings and in what they read but they're going to recognize my presence they're going to recognize me when I move they're going to know me when I'm in their midst and he began his great work of restoration and we know that Luther comes forth with with justification and Wesley comes forth with sanctification and and the things of God once again began to burn in man's Consciousness it was an Awakening in the history books they call it the Great Awakening and these things are are happening and then the isua street uh Revival happens and there's a restoration of the gifts and and then a prophet comes on the scene with a mighty message and out of that a bride begins to rise up and we know there there had been other moves there had been other Mighty revivals and and there had been great Awakenings but but this Awakening was greater than any of the other great Awakenings or Awakenings of the past because there was a bride who was waking up and becoming keenly aware of the presence of her bridegroom becoming aware that he was in her midst and and the word Awakening here means the act of awaking from sleep a Revival of Interest or attention a recognition realization or coming into awareness of something and brother brandham speaking about this he says now a few years ago when I started there was none that was going going on he said there was none of that going on and the only thing that this has done and this supernatural has awakened ministers out of their sense bound religion into a place to where they see God is present but see the the problem is is that many failed to recognize who it was that was really here they failed to realize who it was that really came to bring a message who it was that was being revealed it was the mighty Angel it was the pillar of fire that led Israel it was the Lord Jesus Christ but so many failed to recognize his presence in all of this they recognized the prophet and indeed they needed to but they recognized the prophet but when the prophet was taken they believed that the supernatural went with him because all that they were ever awakened to was the prophet and so when that went away many begin to not expect God to move they couldn't recognize God moving and yet the whole time brother Brandon was trying to wake people up to the fact he is here Jesus is here it's not about William Brown it's not about me I'm not Gathering you to me what was he telling you is he's here he's here the pillar of fire has returned he's in our midst you got to recognize that he's here he's the one amongst us he's the one doing these Works he's the one Discerning the hearts he would say it's never failed who could do that only the Lord Jesus he never pointed to himself it wasn't about him the whole time he was saying quit looking at me it's him it's him it's him he's here he's who you got to have he's the Savior he's the bridegroom I came to point you to him and that's what the message was he's saying you got to have him be aware of him be conscious of him he's in our midst and we must recognize our opportunity in his presence what what are you saying brother I'm saying you better seize the moment seize every opportunity don't let one of them pass because they're precious moments there's many even in in the midst of what we call the message this great marvelous message there's many that are are slumbering there's many that are slumbering in in this time as man W would call it the delay God has delayed his coming but I'm telling you tonight we got to wake up we got to be awake we got to be alert we got to be conscious he's passing by this moment don't wait don't Slumber and remember just because because he comes by your way doesn't mean you receive anything you have to recognize him you have to cry out to him think about how many people Jesus came to or passed by or walked past that never received anything how many people that maybe he sit next to or or even spoke to and and they didn't receive a thing because they didn't recognize him you must recognize his presence and grab hold to it I hear a prophet Discerning on tape and he would say he would discern a heart and he'd say oh no she's going to miss it that's right oh no she's going to miss it and he'd say she missed it but you got it she missed it but you got it there may be plenty of people missing it but somebody's going to be the you got it somebody's going to be the I see him I'm not missing it yes Lord I hear my name yes Lord that's me yes Lord somebody's going to grab hold to it and be God icious and aware and wake up we can't afford to miss an opportunity he's a supernatural God and he moves in Supernatural ways and he expects his children to recognize him when he moves and not only that he wants us to want him to move he wants us to expect him to move last week was great I'm thankful for the outpouring last week but God I'm expecting it tonight Lord I know you're going to move tomorrow but I'm expecting it in this Saturday night in this service tonight I expect the blessings tonight I expect the Holy Ghost to fall tonight I expect healings in this building tonight I expect Deliverance in this place tonight families restored tonight God to move tonight the pillar of fire to be manifest tonight this moment because he's here his presence is here in this place Hallelujah when you come like that you won't miss him you you won't miss him we we you know we love when he comes and we can feel it but what about being conscious of God when you don't feel it even when I don't see it he's working even when I don't feel it he's working and I'm aware of it because I've been turned and turned into it by a message of the hour that called my name by word in the Bible that says where two or three are gathered he's there you're not going to feel him every service but just because but even if you don't feel him if you believe the word that says he's here why not worship him just like you do when you do feel him I'm not feeling anything but you know what I see the effects of him I can sit inside my house and I might not can feel the wind but I can look out the window and see the trees doing this and I go I ain't feeling it but the wind's blowing the wind's moving and it may not be feeling it tonight but I see this one shouting and this one dancing and tongues coming forward right here and I say I don't feel it but I see the effects of it so I know he's in the building Lord I see you I recognize you I'm going to praise you I'm going to cry out I'm going to get what I have need of because I know you're here whether I feel it or not Hallelujah aware of it awake to it conscious of it recognize him in your every day it's not just about recognizing him twice a week recognize him in your blessings every day and his grace in your life every single day knowing that that he's in the service because he said he would be here brother Brown says Jesus Christ is here present if we could be conscious of that and remember not only here but when you're walking down the street wherever you are you that profess to be Believers and fear the lord remember the angels of God are moving with you wherever you are they watch everything you do every thought that goes through your mind they know all about you therefore we must be conscious of that pardon me God conscious brother Bram speaking here about gesi and Elisha and I thought this was incredible talking about being aware even when we don't feel it or see it he said just the same tonight I wonder what would happen if a man here tonight had the power to strike across your eyes and say look standing around this Tabernacle tonight I'll say it around this Tabernacle tonight he says you'd be a member here the rest of your life he says yes sir sometimes you can't see it with your natural eyes now this this quote shocked me I thought it was awesome he said but you can feel the impulse of it something near a six sense that denotes something is near now he didn't see that at first but Elisha probably didn't see it but he asked for the boy's eyes to see it Elisha was conscious they were there he says excuse me he says Elijah didn't see it but he asked for the boys to see it but Elisha was conscious that they were there Elisha didn't see it but he was conscious of it because he tried to stay conscious of God whereas the boy needed to see it El just Elisha just knew he trusted just like tonight I I haven't seen the pillar of fire tonight brother Andrew but I don't have a doubt that it's here I'm conscious that it's moving in our midst I see it striking some of your hearts I see some of you becoming aware of his presence I know that he's moving in here because he promised that he would and we're a people that's been called to be God conscious aware of the supernatural aware that he's here aware that he's working in responding to him whether we feel it or not and what happened when the message began to come forth is it made many people aware of the supernatural as that swept around the world they were awakened to its realities and to the power of it and yet to me brother Andrew it's like a lot of people have hit the snooze button they were awakened but then they reached over and hit the snooze button you know the alarm goes off to wake you up and you're aware for a moment of what's going on and what's happening but you don't come fully aware and you hit the snooze button and doze back off now I know we all sleep different and we all wake up different some people's like man when sunlight comes through my window I just can't lay there no more I'm like sunlight don't hinder me I conquered that I'm an overcomer I'm sunlight means roll over turn your back to the window but when I I'm going tell on myself a little bit it's a can't lie in church anyway so when when I when I was a school teacher and it's still this way I'm going have to turn in my man card our alarm clock's on my wife's side of the bed cuz if it's on my side of the bed it' just keep going off and would nothing happen I I'd unplug it or or you know but it's on my wife's side of the bed because it awakens her and then she kicks me and she keeps kicking me until I get up and I'll say I'm up and she go no you're not you're still laying there I I I I I'm away yeah but you're you're not up yet all right when I was in high school my my dad would come wake me up and I had a staircase next to my bed and he'd sit right there on that staircase and dad got great joy out of this he enjoyed annoying me I believe and he would sit there and he'd look at me and in the most monotone annoying voice possible he would say say my name over and over and over and over and over again until he didn't care how long it took cuz he was happy doing it he would sit right there and he'd go Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron you're getting annoyed I know you're not even asleep and and and you're laying there he's like man you're getting on my nerves but guess what he didn't care he was getting on my nerves he had a job to wake you up why you always preaching the supernatural why you always preaching the miraculous why you always preaching the Holy Ghost I heard you no wake up wake up wake up get up he's in our midst he's moving wake up wake up wake up I'm awake no you're not get up move get out of the bed you got to come awake he's here wake up wake up we were preaching the same thing again you're still hitting the snooze button get up the alarm clock has one job wake up the ministry has one job you must be born again you must be born again he's here he's present he's moving wake up it's the job I don't care if it annoys you well you're preaching about the angel again yep you got to be aware he's [Applause] here don't hit the snooze but button why you preaching right there again why you always preaching the supernatural because an alarm clock makes the same sound over and over and over and it makes you make a choice you go ahead and keep hitting snooze and eventually you're going to wake up and you're going to be late but I got up yeah but you missed it but but I heard the message I got out of bed yet but we're gone I heard it when it went off the very first time I've been hearing it since the 60s I've been hearing it since the 70s it's been calling my name I knew it was the truth we're gone you hit snooze one too many times you let too many opportunities go by that sound became annoying to you the testimonies got old to you the same old same old got you got tired of it oh they're dancing again they're shouting again they're trying to tell you he's here they're trying to wake you up to the fact that he's moving and he's Gathering abro and he's sweeping across this land and he's saying get up and get on board come with us go with us you don't have to stay here you don't have to be late you don't have to miss it quit hitting the snooze button and come on get up tonight and move with the spirit of God oh I'm just trying to get a few more minutes y'all ever dreamed you were awake cuz I think that's where a lot of people are now I'm telling you I've gotten out of the bed I went to the restroom I've stood there and started brushing my teeth and the alarm go off and I was laying on my pillow whoa woman ain't you supposed to be kicking me you ain't about to blame nobody there's been plenty warning there's been a flashing red light going now for a long time I'm just telling you right now if the train leaves the blocks without you in it you have no one to blame but I'm thankful to be speaking to a group tonight that's already throw down those bag of peanuts they've already secured their kicken they said the token's right here I got it in my hand I've got it I've taken my seat and I'm ready to go to glory on this train I'm ready to go get out the way devil whatever I got to conquer whatever I got to overcome it's okay the price is paid my soul has been bought my name's written down I'm not going to be left behind I'm not going to be overcome I can't be left I've got a ticket I'm on board I'm going to Glory that's who you are [Applause] tonight so many people hear the alarm and yet they're asleep sound asleep in their correct Doctrine sound asleep in their manufactured Holiness unaware of his presence asleep in their works because they heart alarm go off and they think they're awake and they're totally unaware that he's moving refusing to recognize his presence then a stirring will come into church and people will get stirred maybe on a Saturday night maybe last week maybe tonight and it wakes you up don't snooze it feed that fire get out of bed and start doing what you need to do to go about the Lord's work today get out of bed and start getting and don't slip back into your comfort zone that's why it's hard to get out of bed bed's comfortable this ain't always comfortable but we slip right back into our comfort zone listen Comfort is one of the worst things that can happen for a Christian you get you get loose you get come there they say and forgive me I'm just trying to paraphrase this but I read it the other day that most major Act accidents on big construction jobs will always happen right at the very end of it because people get comfortable man I've been coming to work here 73 straight days we've got it worked everything's good all we got to do is put the finishing touches and they don't take the precaution they're not awake to what's around them they they lay down their arms so to speak I say Lord stir us up again tonight stir up the Inner Man stir up this congregation let let this place and let me tell you not only do I say let this place I say that you are you are a lighthouse to the world you are a lighthouse uh Full Gospel you are truly it's not just your name but you shine to the world that there is a living God you shine to the world of what it's like to be free to worship to have no chains on your life I'm telling you right now we we look up to you the world looks to you and you you don't got to just think I'm just saying these things you are a true Lighthouse don't you ever let anything come in here and bring lukewarmness to your worship don't you ever let anything come in here you are an example that God's moving you're a part of the alarm clock telling the world to wake up you're some of the ones saying you can have freedom you can have Liberty you can be free in the spirit I don't let somebody come in and turn the flow off they'll worry about what the critics say I ain't wor I ain't here for the critics I'm here for a Rapture I'm here to praise God I'm here for victory I ain't here to make everybody happy this message ain't going to make everybody happy the movement of the spirit ain't going to make everybody happy but God's children they're going to love it they're going to move with it they're going to flow in it they're going to say pour it out tonight Lord like never before I recognize my opportunity [Applause] tonight man when the fire fell in the upper room and the stirring came they became aware that that the Jesus that had ascended was once again in the room amen and the power of God came in and came on the inside of them and the prophet says and the power of God so enclosed those people and anointed them till they run out into the streets screaming and dancing and hollering and acting like a bunch of drunk people that's the scripture thus saith the Lord why'd they do that why'd they dance why' they scream why' they shout why' they act like drunk people well brother Andrew to me it's obvious it's because they's out of order just kidding well because say I don't nope because they was empowered and they was anointed by the power of God and when that happens sometimes these old bodies just don't know what to do and so I'm just going to praise Him however he anoints me to praise him and I want to go ahead and make this clear don't think that I'm that person that thinks you all got to praise that way I'm just saying you got to praise him some way when he moves and you recognize he's here you got to praise him some way I I'll never forget I may have told this one time I was preaching at home when when my daddy was still living and my daddy always sat in church like this and I'm going along preaching and I just said you know you you got to praise God and and I I even said I said if people in town ask some of you where you worship you better not tell them this church cuz you go to church here but I don't never see you worship and I said I just want to tell you right now this ain't a form of worship and when I did I was looking right at my daddy and he was looking right at me just like that we had a good laugh about it later not right then though he didn't budge I just want you to know [Laughter] he boy no we should worship God they were anointed and they were anointed by the power of God they were anointed so so if that's what caused it then let them say it's just emotion let them say it's just people getting carried away let them say it's out of order I really don't care what they say listen we've been out of order since this thing started we've been dancing in the spirit since this thing started we've been talking in tongues since this thing started and we ain't about to stop now it's How We Roll it's what we do it's how we praise it's the outlets that we let the Holy Spirit manif manifest themselves through if you don't like it that's okay that's what we do that's how we praise that's how we we worship that's how we let him [Applause] move I'm not going to be able to finish all this that's okay y'all give me a few more minutes I believe the eagle stirring their nest I believe the wind of the Holy Ghost is moving I believe brother Andrew we're Eagles man we all got wings but sometimes I feel like it's just been a minute since we've really put them in use I feel like some I get a little Dusty because I ain't been flopped a little bit flop is that the right word flapped they ain't been flapped in a

got hurt by the leadership with the church but you know what I'm going to let that go tonight and this sister said that you know what I'm feeling a little bit free tonight I'm starting to begin to feel the wind blowing and and I'm going to start getting a little bit loose and before long you catch an up current and before before long you ain't even on the ground anymore before long you're soaring in the heavenlies listen I'm telling you there ain't no reason to stay in a chicken pin tonight I'm telling you there ain't no reason to stay there the world came and the devil came and he said you got to eat this you got to live like this you got to have this sickness you got to have this bitterness you got to have this unforgiveness and that fence looks High I'm just saying tonight just spread your wings a little bit there ain't a fence high enough to keep a son or daughter of God cooped up tonight oh I'm telling you brother brandham said just jump up on a fence post oh maybe

the conquerors here he says fly into the Heavenly Fly Above It All I'm here I'm providing the strength I'm doing it just come with me Hallelujah are you ready to swore tonight listen listen to this right here brother Bram says he's your father he loves you and the N stirring time has already come I love this but what we need is another jump we got to the Barnyard post I already we got you on the fence post but we need to get free so we can just ride on his wings for our first solo flight what a joy it will be when the Great final days comes that those who know how to jump and flop their wings I said it like the prophet those who know how to jump now notice he didn't say those who know how to fly these ain't people that's got it all figured out these ain't people that ain't been in the chicken yard these ain't been people that that ain't had a trial these are just people that are flopping and jumping around those who know how to flop and jump jump and flop their wings those who know how to do it someday he shall come the Great Eagle of the sky shall come in glory he will spread forth his great power and the Holy Spirit and those who are magnetized to it shall take a ride to Eternity forever those who recognize his moving those who have flopped in the presence before maybe you didn't get very far maybe you didn't make it above the fence post but one of these days those that are magnetized to it when that great Mama Eagle sweeps down you're going to catch a ride into eternity forever that's why I don't mind practice listen that's why I don't mind flapping my wings I don't mind getting loose in the spirit cuz on that day I'm going to wake up I'm going to recognize it's Rapture day it's going home day I feel the spirit sweeping over I'm going to spread my wings and I'm going to go home Hallelujah I'm going to go home Hallelujah so yes we preach the super Supernatural man I'm all untucked and unkept and we'll have to fix it later we preach the miraculous because where Jesus is You'll Always Find the Supernatural and I find that Satan constantly attacks it and he tries to point to carnal impersonations but his children recognize look Janice and jambes was there of course and you know it worked ancient Jewish sources say this ain't scripture but the rabbis write that one out of every five Israelites left Egypt that the rest chose to stay behind and why should we go I mean they do the same signs you do they jump and Shout just like you and they you they're just magicians they do this and they do that but the children of God recognize the realities of the supernatural they recognize that I ain't worried about the impersonations that don't worry me none that don't harm me none listen you get a bunch of people worshiping God and you get a few people that are doing it because they're just excited and I guess I just don't understand the problem are we not to do you not want your children excited in the presence of God are we not brother said well those are just the blessings yeah I guess I thought I was supposed to want them I my bad I want the blessings I want my children to enjoy church I want them to know there's a supernatural God and there's a reality to God I want them to be a part of that brother Brown says many people are great lovers of God raised up under the church they believe their church that's right they believe God but as far as the supernatural being operated in a human being today that's beyond anything they can swallow but that's where the truth is now that is the truth God is my Supreme judge that's where the truth lays he's talking about in the Supernatural he says I'll tell you I ain't criticizing the Baptist but Baptist people fundamentally know what they're talking about as long as it comes to the word but they know nothing about the Supernatural and my brethren that's where you're losing the blessing and when we lose touch with that Supernatural and I'm fing to bring this to a close when the supernatural isn't preached we end up with dead Services we end up with dead people dead pews dead homes and people destined to do nothing but perpetuate the ages listen we can't Slumber we can't go back to sleep blind barus you know he's sitting there how is it that we can see so much and not recognize we can see so much and yet a blind man can recognize his chance the prophet tells us that he thought that he had missed it he thought it was too late and I love it here in Mark 10:47 it says he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me barus was recognizing this is it and I'm going to go ahead and tell you maybe I I don't I know maybe it's not good of me but this is my favorite part in the whole story it says and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried out the more a great deal I'm going to go ahead and tell you there's a lot of people saying y'all need to tone down them Services y'all getting a little out of hand up there at Full Gospel over there at evening light at some of them youth camps y'all getting a little bit out of hand and I want to say to them you ain't seen nothing yet because I'm going to cry out all the more th son of David have mercy on me I need you move here filled with the Holy Ghost I just getting started worshiping I just getting started praising because I recognize he's here I recognize it's an opportunity and I must have him tonight I'm just getting started in this thing we're just starting the fight and it says Jesus came to a stop and I filled a stop right here it came do a stop and I I believe he come to a stop tonight and I asked you which way is he going to turn is he going to turn and keep going is he going to go over here is he G he's going to turn to the ones who recognize the opportunity and who cry out the amount we cry out directly corresponds with how much we think we need him when he moves through a place and we don't cry out we identify as layout of sins because we say we have need of nothing when Jesus can move through here and we don't cry out for our needs it signifies I don't have need you have to recognize your need of him and you have to cry out and say Lord I got to have you right now Lord I'm one of those that have recognized you're in this place I recognize you're Gathering a bride I recognize you're moving all over the world I recognize Lord I know you're here

him tonight oh what a people you are what a God that we serve hallelujah hallelujah the woman with the blood issue brother Andrew it wasn't easy that day she recognized him but that wasn't just it she had to fight to get to him and because she did she has a testimony in the Eternal scriptures I say what's your chapter going to say what is the chapter written about you going to say he moved through the place but they didn't fight to him he moved through the place but they wouldn't willing fear kept them back Be not Afraid Be not Afraid Hallelujah do you recognize he's in the place tonight I just want to offer to you I believe we're are people that recognize he's here and where God is eternal things happen where God is victories take place where God is the bound are loosed and the and the
