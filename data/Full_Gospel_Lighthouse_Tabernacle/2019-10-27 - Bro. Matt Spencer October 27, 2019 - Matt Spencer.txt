you have it tonight and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh say to him that overcometh I'm an overcomer amen well I give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God amen I want to be an overcomer and eat of that tree of life amen and first John one and one concerned there says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light technology I just jumped all the way down to the bottom amen and the life was the light of men and the light shine ahthe in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen you can be seated tonight that's the blessings on the reading of the word and the darkness comprehended it not amen where there is God's light there is life amen I like walking in the light of the war amen struggle in here a man so we know that God in His light there is life and there's growth in that life you know there's growth in the SU n but there's also growth in the SOE n you know I was thinking on what happens when there's a lack of Sun s UN in nature in darkness we take the the deepest in the sea deep dark in the sea and and in that sea there's there's creatures that can only live in that darkness and because of that darkness they're deformed creatures you know and then even even outside in the natural when there's darkness lack of Sun let's take Alaska in in borrow Alaska I've heard there's sixty seven days of darkness from about November the 18th told January the 23rd darkness sets in and you know it's kind of like it is now it's it's starting to get darker earlier and earlier in the year and and I think it's next weekend we we change our our clocks you know so it's gonna get darker early early in the evening and so less time to to hunt I mean work and amen but but when there's darkness of days for a very long time darkness there causes confusion in that area there is a thing called seasonal affective disorder which is a type of a depression in that area because of how dark it is for such a length of time and lack of that sunlight is debilitating and even promotes thoughts of suicide and many times it said that that people don't commit suicide throughout that period of time until they realize that spring is beginning to come and they're not prepared for it and light is starting to creep in but that's when they're starting to commit suicide now I just I just pondered that that why now why is that the pressures of the light upon them and they cannot handle that light says in Luke 21 29 said behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth you see you know that your son you know your own selves that summer is now at hand and so likewise you when you see the things come to pass and know that the kingdom of God is now not hand says verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled till that last seed comes in and it says in heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away we're living in the last days we're having living in the Laodicean age as brother Andrew was saying last night we're in that age but we're not of that age amen darkness is all around we're in the harvest time the time of the year of fall when when you see the great combines and the fields and they're starting to gather the crops of the fields and and even the trees are starting to bring forth a lot more fruit and you know this time of year in nature there's a thing called leaf peeping season that is a thing where people will travel throughout the east east coast up and down towards New England and and they will begin to watch trees change and the leaves Lisa those trees beginning to change and they will look up on that and they will spend thousands of dollars and and hours take off from work and they will begin this journey to look at all this nature and what God has created and and just the paintbrush that he just uses and and how he can make this tree that was so green and vibrant in the spring now it's budding for not budding forth but has red leaves and the dark of the bark is darker and it's just amazing to what God can do through that and there's so many people that are looking at these things they'll take pictures and and they'll have a memory of what they seen and and they will they worship more of the creation more than they do the create or a man that no I love I love trees I love the wilderness I love I love this time of year and just like anyone else that the changing of how beautiful it is and and you know that we have many different types of trees there oak trees and you know there's a lot of maple trees and just the beauty of those maple trees and you know they're bringing forth their fruits and and their leaves are beautiful but there's things that's going on inside of those with those woods there's there's branches that are are dead there's trees that are dead with inside those woods and and in a couple more weeks all the leaves will be off the trees and and it's hard to tell whether that tree has life or whether that tree is hollow and dead and and so you won't know that until spring buds for fugget and so we look at that and and then this time of year you can start to see more widow-makers it how many knows what a Widowmaker is a Widowmaker is a branch that has fallen off of a big tree and is hanging on smaller trees or just barely hanging on to the tree itself and if someone would walk underneath of it and it would the wind would blow just right and and fall down upon a man that's why they call them widow-makers well what that Widowmaker is doing is and when it's when it's on top of these little Wordle trees it's starting to go way down that trees growth and and even inside of that tree there's rings inside of that tree that that tells its its story of life and if you would take that tree later down the road and you would cut that tree down you could see that at one point there was distress on this tree and you see many things like a knot on the on a tree and and you wonder hat now what made that come out of that you know meant men will take spikes and drive them into a tree for for maybe a marking post or something and and before long that tree will will overtake and grow around that and many many trees have been markers in life for navigation for for roadways and how people need to get around and you take over here on poor Republic Road are not poor public but over to Weir's cave there's a tree called the Stonewall Jackson tree that used to be there and that used to be the Stonewall Jackson prayer tree and people would come from all around to look at this tree in all of its glory and and they would take the limbs that would fall off of that tree and they would make pencils out of that isn't that correct brother Justin amen and they would you know sell them at these like this this come out of the stone Jaxson prayer tree so many times trees have have represented things in life boundaries markers roadways and and we see their strong trees that's giving life even out to the wilderness the birds of the air and you know that they're spiders and stuff that that will attach to trees back and forth and and so you know the other day me and Andrew was walking through the woods and and you know right about August time it seems like every spider makes huge webs and if you've ever walked through the woods you know what I'm about to say when you're walking through you're walking like this because you do not want that spider web on your face and then trying to find out where that spider has went to and so me and Andrew was walking through the woods the other day and was actually going to a hunting spot and and I had a rake in my hand and he was just walking on through there and he was fighting the spider webs and I had the rake and I was just walking and with him like it you know they ain't ain't no spider was getting on me and and he turns around looks and he give me that well I guess I better follow him now because now now he's got it so so what I did was he started creating a clear path for me to follow you know so so many times in life will be walking through the the natural woods so to say and there'll be spider web getting all over us more but if you have somebody in front of you leading the way creating a clear path you don't have to worry about all that and I thought about that how that I follow him in natural sense but I also follow him in a spiritual sense amen and so this this is a thing where where life is produced and and so I want to kind of take that tonight how that the trees and and the tree of life and the tree of knowledge two trees brother branham says that there was a in restoration of the bride tree two trees the restoration of the bride tree but also the bridegroom tree amen and that's what we're trying to get back to is him amen and as it said we we would eat off of the Tree of Life to him that overcometh and so that's what I want to to be as an overcomer amen and as I was saying that people in this day and age that they they worship more the creation more than they do the create or so if we can turn to Romans 1 verse 21 I'd like to read here where it describes how people's minds begin to turn over once they worship more of their creation and verse 21 Romans 1:21 says because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we're thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise became they became fools and they changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made of corruptible man and the birds and the four-footed beast and the creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness he went ahead and just gave them up to what they was wanting to get to said unclean things through the lust of their own hearts desire their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the create the creature more than they did the Creator who is blessed forever why would you want to worship something other than the create or that is blessed forever for this God called them gave them up unto vile affections for unto the women their women did change the natural use into which is against the natural nature and likewise also men leaving natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which was unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was met that was fitting for them and even as they did not like to return retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to their parents without understanding covet breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful knowing who knowing now they knew the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death they knew this not only do they do the same but they have pleasures in them that do it I don't know about you but I believe I just read what we was that we're living in what a dark age that we're living in brother Branham describes it as just a little bit of light there God is that light it says in Genesis 1 and 3 says God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light and it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now what happened here there was a separation God had light and he separated the light from the darkness brother Branham says here is there's a man that can turn on the light says in the fourth verse he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day in the darkness he called night and God's Word always separates a light from darkness it's the word that does the separating I like that it's that word that does that separating the light from the darkness and God ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything like he got ready to use that old star or whatever it was this world he had to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to leave to use a group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness I'm that group of people I'm planning on leaving here he's gonna separate this light from that darkness hey man and when he gets ready to use an individual he separates that light from that darkness see that light comes by God and remember the light come by his spoken word and the Word of God said let there be light and when there was no light at all and he sent the light and separated the darkness from the light God's doing some separating in this time sometimes we think how in the world did we get here well he's starting to do some separating here we didn't know it's not anything within us that brought us here it's like brother Andrew was saying last night no but he'd never called nobody up and said get here the Lord is drawing us that light drawing us amen for God is light and first John one and five says God is light and in him is no darkness at all Amen you take a light and you shine it in darkness you look at this light all around it may be darkness all the way around there but there is no darkness at all inside of that light you cannot find no darkness in that light God is that light in him is no darkness and if we say we have fellowship with him but walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light and have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all our sins and if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us see there's still darkness inside of there if we're doing that in him is life and the life was the light of men we're growing something's drawing us those trees what did they do they stretch forth towards the Sun they now you can take a tree and as a little sapling you can take that little sapling and you can put little little ropes on it and you can try to pull it this way and say now tree you're going to grow this way because I want you to shade my house that is over here and so I'm gonna pull you this way and so you take ropes and you'll start fasten it down and you drive stakes in the ground and you say well this is the way I want this tree to lean because it has a good look to it and it might be one of those Asian trees where he has like twists and turns all the way around and so you keep keep pulling it pulling but what happens that tree will still branch forth towards the son and it still starts to grow and says this is where I'm receiving my life my life is over here you want to take me there but my life is here right here is my lifeline why do you want to draw me there that's the same thing that the devil will do you'll try to pull you over here with its ropes and its dogmas and his denominations and say this is what I want you to believe but you say no this is life ah ha ha what life so the devil will do those kind of things to to stop you and if he can't put a hold onto you a rope on you he'll send in bugs little insects in Joel what talks about the Palma worm the cankerworm the locust and the caterpillar and what do these things do the pommel worm the pommel war begins to take off the fruits brother branham describes it as this the fruits of the vine love joy peace longsuffering God God knit goodness meekness faith patience and the Holy Ghost that pommel worm will will come in that that little insect will start to eat the fruits off of off of that tree but it has four stages that pommel worm will eat that brotherly love it'll come in and say now there's something wrong so and so's saying something about you over here and that'll start to begin separation you know it'll create a lack of faith in the word it'll take the joy of your salvation that pummel worm it will eat those fruits just as we had the service the other night where each of us had went into our home and say and I'm gonna let Joey in the devil don't like that the devil likes to send in little bugs that like to just just nibble away and eat away just a little little by little so it'll take the joy of your salvation it'll take your peace of mind knowing that you're saved it'll do all these little things creating a way for the next cycle what's the next cycle is the locusts the locusts that comes in it eats the leaves many times you'll see in the spring there be a tree that got on this thing it was a vibrant tree there for a little while well this locust began to eat the leaves thereof what is those leaves they those leaves those are divine fellowship brother branham describes it like this is underneath the cool of the trees like in the comfort of your home's in the comfort of the word those locusts will start eating away at each little leaf taken away all that and then it makes a way for the cankerworm now what does the cankerworm do the cankerworm now goes into the bark makes his way into the bark and starts to destroy the covering off of the tree the protection that has around it now last year I cut down a lot of trees with the year before last and and so I piled up a lot of a lot of wood for firewood and and the other day I begin to split some wood and you know on the outside of a lot of those logs they look perfect ready to be split and so I take that splitter and I'd run them down through there and they start to split open well that bark would start to peel away but on the inside of that bark there's this huge black beetle and I thought well how in the world did he get there because that bark looked just fine right out here but what happened was when that tree was vibrant full of life there was a little bug a cankerworm that had made its way inside of there and so what it's done then it's allowed all those other bugs to eat around it too and so when you start to peel away all that bark you pretty much got a little log that's about like this and you did all that work to get it to this point and so that cankerworm will eat away at that protection of it it's tried eating away at the baptism of the Holy Ghost the blood as the covering that's what the devil will do he'll send out these insects to eat away at you little by little and what's the next stage is a caterpillar but the random describes the caterpillar as a sucker it will suck the life out of the tree it'll start to de nominate what was undeneath this is the way you need to do run your churches this is where you need to run your service now you can't preach this but we're going to allow you to preach this over here because this over here kind of hurts stings a little bit you know but that's the way the caterpillar will do to take out that life you can see that we've had life in this church over the past year you can see that whole egos fire that's been filling our young people amen that life has not been taken out of this amen but each insect has made a way for each other amen brother Branham says it like this in the Ephesians church age says when the Sun the SU n begins to shine down through the fog and the midst of the night no matter where that seed is it'll live amen so in the forests of the trees in the springtime you'll see all these these little saplings that's raising up and you and you come and you look at them all and they're all vibrant and then comes fall and and all the leaves has gone off of it and you can't pick out which one's going to make it through and which ones not and it's like I was saying about that that Widowmaker it's taken away the sunlight from a lot of these little saplings down here that are going to grow up and the sun's not able to shine down on those those seeds that are down inside of there that is producing a life and so what happens when you don't have Sun as you in things will dwarf things will become not as vibrant in life and so what happens is is that that Sun that's supposed to shine down on there and that and that little Widowmaker that's there it's just taking up space in the trees there's nothing good about a Widowmaker nothing you I hope you're not a Widowmaker here tonight taking away time and space away from little ones or people that's getting the Holy Ghost and and saying now this that that was in the days of past that's not now don't be a Widowmaker of today amen don't take away the Sun from someone that's trying to grow in the goodness of life amen [Applause] and so what happens is that son it's starting to bring forth those seeds and so this time of year those leaves are falling off and those acorns underneath there are starting to be covered up by leaves that are falling off and you wonder well I wonder which one is going to receive life here I wonder what sapling is going to make it up through well brother branham describes it as this and says it's because all botany life lives by the Sun and we know that and you could pour concrete right across a piece of grass the next spring where is the thickest grass right out at the end of that concrete why that's life beneath there that seed is underneath there but you can't hide real life that little life as soon as it knows that the sun's bathing through there it's warming up inside of there and it'll warm its way out a half a city block almost getting around underneath that concrete till it sticks hits him a little head up right up there in the air and starts to begin to praise God you can't hide life that's right life when you're born again you can't hide it something's got to cry out amen when that Suns beginning to pour down on those leaves and there's little acorns underneath there they're starting to feel the vibrant nests of that Sun and it's starting to draw forth and something's pulling it up and it's beginning to live Zechariah says it in 14 and 16 says it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clearer nor dark kind of foggy can't really see that great but it shall be one day we shall be known to the Lord not day nor night it shall come to pass that in the evening light in the evening time it shall be light that's what I like in the evening time it shall be light now the same sun's but there's random describes it like this the same Sun that comes across from the west coast that's shining towards the East Coast it's the same Sun there as it is here the same Sun that it was in the other church ages is the same Sun coming forth in the Laodicean age and it's receiving its light and we're starting to grow from that light I'm like drawing to a light and God sees that light laying down on the inside of you that little life and says you're gonna make it as the evening times coming forth that light shine at for fences you're gonna make it starts to begin to paw and says you're predestinated seed there's a seed that was down on the inside of you that when that sum overshadowed it started to bring for flies now that same sapling that's in the woods next year and you see that one that it's growing up taller than all the other ones what's inside of that one same Sun same plant but there was predestinated life inside of that sapling that says you're gonna make it and how does nature say don't eat upon this tree the deers will pass in and won't eat upon that one but this one begins to grow how did you get here how you know I just think how did we all get here you know you can link people back to maybe there was a grandmother that got baptized underneath Homer granddaddy Homer our brother Homer I should say and that grandma she was a light to that that home when maybe there was people inside of that home that maybe thought I'll never be a Christian like add I'll never do something like that I think of brother Wayne brother Wayne on his 80th birthday hear how that he would send his eyes through his mama and finally brother brother grant Homer said no you bring your ties yourself you come on here what happened granddaddy see that there was a seed on the inside of there and God said I'm gonna shine my light over here on him that seeds gotta come forth and what's happened from that more light has lifted into this family has raised up more lights you will be alight to people that I will never be light to in this dark age there were people that will see you and see that light that you're shining out with you and they'll go what's what's different about this person what's different about them that's like brother Andrew and dad them and they took their trip down to Louisiana at the camp meetings down there they was driving back in and they'd stopped at a gas station and there was a black man and woman that that pulled there and started talking to him said where were y'all hiddenness well we've just come from a camp meeting here in Louisiana we spoke that and now we're heading back home with our families and and some of you was even there and they begin to talk to him and the the man was a prison minister said correct he was a prison minister and his wife and they did mission work between the prisons and and and dad asked us by the way how'd you know he said the light man the light see you're shining the light and people seen in that light and they don't know what's different but they know there's something different a man [Applause] we're representing Christ that's God's life living in us a light light shining forth in this world amen you know I just think it's amazing how I was saying about how that some of us have made it here to the spots that we are now and but God knew us before the foundation of the world when he was saying let there be light he was speaking of me was he speaking of you when he said let there be light let me separate that darkness from the light and we go draw nourishment from that light don't we'll gather here Saturdays and Sundays and some of our young people will have choir meetings and they'll start to draw a light from each other amen we draw light and we grow from that light that seed that's down on the inside of us David said it like this in Psalms 1 and 3 says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and bringing forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper well the Branham says it like this and registered restoration of the Brahe tree said David saw it and he spoken blessed is that man notice he couldn't he could not die his leaves would not wither no matter what they do they'll never kill that tree that tree that's planet where's its planet its planet by the rivers of water now notice David says his roots will not die brother branham says it like this and says you know you take a tree a big old tree says when I was a boy I used to go out and reduce us boys we'd go out and there's a big old tree that we used to set under a big old beech tree and the winds would blow and I wondered and I'd look at that thing and over and over again and that that when time after time would blow the tree and it would rock that tree but what's it doing it's loosening up the roots so that they can just dig a little deeper and get a better hole he says it like this and says that's the way mockery laughing making fun of a Christian what it does the persecution shakes the Christian make him want to pray more dig down a little deeper get a better hold so he could stay in that storm hallelujah to win the storms of life it's gonna take a stronger win than this to keep me from my promises that stronger wind that takes and blows and huh you just say not now Satan I'm digging down deeper oh give me a little more that acts 2:38 that'll what the devil it continues to just dig into what it's gets a better hold that Beatle can't destroy that beetle that I was talking about it will never destroy that tree that has true life says in first John 1 and ain't and if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all our unrighteousness so what happens when you have that little that little bug and you you saying listen I'm ready I just want to surrender to him I'm done I'm gonna give it all to him God sends that whole it goes that fire down on the inside of you cleanses you that pesticide that'll get rid of you written I get rid of you get rid of that insect that's on the inside of you it'll get rid of that old nature and says and we have the need of forgiveness of our sins the blood of Christ is the divine provision for both we see in John 1 2 and 1 it says my little children these things I write unto you that if you sin that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteousness and he he is the propitiation for our sins and not only for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world the whole world he has taken it all upon himself he has shined that light in this dark age you know what we'll get rid of a beetle and a bug you see these trees on the side of these mountains that over in West Virginia there's a spot across 64 that where that there's been beetles has eat up the whole forest on the side of this mountain and you can see it for miles there's no life no life in those trees what'll here that I tell you what'll cure that that's a fire fire fire will take care of all those beetles it'll wipe away all all those sins of beetles it'll kill it all and what happens new growth begins to come after a fire hey man what happens out of the ashes comes beauty oh how that that beautiful little pond Lily was down on the inside of that pond and that sign that sunshine down through there and it began to bud forth and that beauty just come forth what happens when that fire goes across those woods and we'll burn it all off it creates new life that life that'll shine that life that shines in darkness aren't you glad of that tonight amen aren't you glad God knows where you are in every situation I'm glad of that in John 1 and 43 says the day of following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Philip and said unto Him follow me now Philip was of Bethesda the city Andrew of Andrew and Peter and Philip findeth Nathanael and saith unto him we have found him now Philip is talking to who Moses in the law and the prophets did write about Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathanael said unto Him can there any good come out of Nazareth and Philip saith unto Him we'll come and see and Jesus saw Nathanael coming up to him and he saith unto Him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile and Nathanael said unto Him whence knowest thou me Jesus answer is sent unto Him before that Philip called thee when thou wast underneath the fig tree I saw you and the thing who answered and said unto Him rabbi thou art the Son of God thou art the king of Israel and jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee that I saw you under the fig tree believe us now thou shalt have greater things than these and said unto Him verily verily I say unto you hereafter ye shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man what was it Jesus saw Nathanael and saw what was laying on the inside of him there was a light drawing forth light drawing to that light as I was describing a while ago as we come and we draw him we put our little licks of fire together and we're burning in this dark age there was a light coming forth out of Nathanael see Jesus knew where Nathanael was Jesus could the seed Nathanael was underneath that fig tree and he said there's no guile in thee now gal don't mean sinless it's godless amen as I was telling dad and Andrew the other day two people we know that don't have feminists in the Bible Adam and Nathaniel there's no guile and nemeth annual amen some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow some of you never get it says blessed is the man whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and who spirit there is no God Jesus seen Nathanael seen him in his situation seen him in his spirit and said there's something on the inside of him that's representing me I like that there's a drawing Christ's nose where's your at he knew where he was he's seen him he's seen him down there Christ knows where you are Christ knew that you were draw closer to him he knew that he could shine that light and you would start growing to that light aren't you glad for how Christ knows where you was but where you will be amen brother branham tells the story about how that says a while ago there was such a terrible emergency says we haven't been taking calls during these meetings said but there was a little lady who called who was in a desperate condition and my wife come into the room and said honey I hate to call you from your study but just an awful emergency said this woman's fixing to commit suicide so I got on the phone and while I was standing at the phone the Holy Spirit told her just who she was what she was doing how she was dressed what was the matter with her and what caused it and he healed her right there while standing on the phone says oh I tell you I heard crying her mother screaming holding onto her and everything and just praising the Lord God knew where she was God knew where she was standing and God could see her another little story I'd like to tell you many of you have heard the story about the the infidel man how that brother branham and brother banks woods would would go hunting brother Branham liked to hunt he was a hunter and he loved to squirrel hunt and so brother Branham brother brother would see he told brother Branham said there's there's a place that has some deep hollows over here said and I'd like to take you I said but there the man he's an infidel he hates preachers he was over in there Kentucky and so so brother bran said well that's that's fine you know we're just gonna go squirrel hunting so they go get in the truck and they go up and down over the hills in the valleys and and there they come upon two two men sitting underneath an apple tree and so brother woods banks woods he got out and he began to talk to the man and said said sir I'd like to ask you for hunting permission like do some squirrel hunting said said I'm I'm bank Woods I'm Jim woods his son and he said Jim was said yeah I know Jim Woods said he's an honest honest man said yeah huh well wherever you'd like to hear I said go ahead and he said well well you see I also have my pastor with me and the infidel said don't tell me you've gotten so low that you have to carry a pastor around with you he said well brother Branham says you know that was about the time that I figured I better get out to truck so he walks over brother Branham walks over and and they've been hunting for about two weeks now he says he's he's not had a bath in two weeks and he's got his whiskers out and blood on his clothes and all dirty and said the man the infidel looks him up and down and probably was thinking some preacher brother Brett says probably thinking some preacher some preacher and they're sitting there and and he says how you do how you do he says well I the reason why I have such an issue with you preachers is you're barking up the wrong tree that is a lying dog so what a lying dog is it'll run over here to tree or squirrel and the squirrel supposed to be up there but there's nothing there and it continues to bark and bark and bark and bark and bark at this tree but there's no squirrel upper that is a lying dog and he says you know there there ain't no God up there said I've looked all around he said well that's that's your own opinion he says I'm a pet I mean I'm an infidel he said well I ain't much to be proud of I don't think well maybe you're right maybe you're right so he got to talking there and seen it that apple tree there and he said nice apple tree he said and something happened said mind if I have an apple so he picks up this nice Apple looks at it and begins to eat it there a little bit and and so he says that brother banks wanted to to tell tell this man said who he was as his pastor brother Brant said no no don't don't do that don't don't tell him who I am and so he this man says you know what's that there is one man that I'd like to talk to one preacher said said there was this lady up here up in in the woods here said said me and my wife would go up Ayers take care of her see she had cancer of the stomach all up in her intestines she been down to Louisville and and he said that they had cut her open and not wasn't nothing they could do for had all this cancer on the inside of her and he said they just so door up center by calling me said so me and my wife we'd been taking care of this woman there for a while said we'd be we'd go up there we change her drawl sheet we'd clean up everything for just take care of her and and just knew any day now that that she was going to pass away he said but you know said said there was this man too had come down to the campground and and and he was he was at this methodist campground and brother brother banks woods wanted to say but that was brother Branson mmm-hmm don't don't don't tell him who I am let's see what we'll go to so he begins to tell this man was down there in and and you see this man he he can tell who you are and and and where are you from and and said this woman's sister that had lived over down in the creek the creek here said said she said well I'm gonna go up to that that meeting said but she got in there late so she didn't get one of them prayer cards and so anyway said that that that woman was sitting there in the back and that man a man seen her back there in and says well your so-and-so and your sister is so-and-so and she has cancer of the stomach says and before you left your house you put a little handkerchief down inside your pocketbook and it has a little blue figure on it said you take a little handkerchief home and you lay it on her and thus sayeth the Lord she's healed he said he said you know that that night she took it up there laid it on her and said we heard the awful of screaming there was he says said we thought it was the Salvation Army up there said well we figured well the next morning you know hey she's done passed on we'll go up there give comfort to the next of kin and he said you know we went up there and what happened was is when we walked in she was sitting at the table drinking a pot of coffee and eating fried half apple pies she was completely healed brother branham started just looking at the app we said now you don't believe that he said you go on up you talk about a man that brother Brad describes it like this it says give a cow enough rope he'll hang himself is that he said oh you don't believe so he said go on up said I'll tell you where she's at sure enough says she does her work and the neighbors work - now she's him he said aha you're telling me that she went down to Louisville they cut her open she had intestinal cancer gave her just a few weeks to live and you're telling me some man told her to lay a handkerchief on her and thus sayeth the Lord she's healed that's right he's him hmm don't know preach preach them back to him there some good Apple keep eating that Apple he said he said you know that apple tree right here said how old is that tree he said well I'm right about 76 78 years old

the leaves are starting to fall down says so what's making them leaves fall off and this man is starting to describe it to brother branham he says well well there's a germ sea life on the inside of that that says that sap better get down into them roots because if it don't get down to them roots the winter is going to kill it he said you don't say now what makes it do that well it just it's supposed to you know that's what that's what it's supposed to it's nature this is my supposed to he's a nature hmm he said well I wondered what if I take a book of the water and send it over here on the fence post and this winter nature takes it runs it down there down that post is it supposed to run it back up arrogant as well well that's what it's supposed to come back you know he's thinking that well he kind of got me here brother Brandon was talking to him Aaron he's describing how that that life is going in and out of that tree and what's causing that tree to have life every year and what's bringing forth that fruit and that life every spring comes around and he looks at the man he says I tell you what so we're going to go hunting and while we're hunting you think about what intelligence tells that life to run that SAP down into them roots and then that intelligence tells that same SAP to run back up it and said when I get back and you could tell me that I'll tell you what intelligence told me that thus saith the Lord lay that handkerchief on her and she'd be healed he said I now see what you're saying said he took stood up grabbed him by the hands and said right there he led that man to Christ see there was a life there was a life there was a light that needed to bring forth and what drove him there there there'd been hunting over here but there had to be a drought over here for these brother banks wouldn't brother Brandon to come over here to this man to be able to speak to this man on this day at this time of year because there was life brother branham describes it like this it's God provided way God's provided way and he says that it was thus saith the Lord that woman would get healed it was a drawing all those things working together bringing forth God knows where you're at God knew that this this light needed to come forth sees what happened is shortly after that brother branham goes back and that man had passed away walks up to the woman that was sitting underneath the apple tree and asked for her permission again I said no no we don't offer no permission says says my husband's dead he said I know said said I thought I had permission said said he gave her permission he said she said well said who who are you that well you know last year underneath for this apple tree she said brother branham said he died in the victory of Jesus Christ hallelujah that light that came forth god knows where you're at god knows how to draw you how to pull you out amen brother branham there's another story I've lost I'd like to tell you about dawson raleigh dawson Raleigh was a as a mountain lion hunter that brother branham liked to hunt it with and he would take him hunting a lot of times up there in the up in the country up in British Columbia area up in Canada and they'd hunt mountain lions excuse me and Dawson Dawson got low in his life one time and thought this is it I'm done I'm gonna go up in the mountains I'm gonna hunt for for a little bit I'm gonna take my life said that I'm doing I said I'll live in these cabins I won't tell nobody where I am so nobody has to worry so nobody knew where he was so he was up in them cabins and and one day he he got a phone call God down into the lodge there come up and told him said hey you got a phone call down here he said phone call said hey nobody knows where I am ain't nobody I didn't tell nobody where I was going I'm up here in the middle of nowhere up in these cabins so he come down there and picked up the phone his brother branham he said Dawson I see you up there in that cabin don't take your life Dawson God knew where Dawson was at hey man is this I hope this ain't boarding it cuz it this is this is life right here good cuz cuz when God found me I was in a lot of these situations here I needed to have son draw me out brother branham is in a meeting in Dawson Creek and he's in a prayer line and and he says what's the matter soldier boy said you're not going to commit suicide the devil's lying to you boy said you got a phobia he's lying to you he will drive you insane if you believe him deny him renounced the devil I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce renounced the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer that soldier boy the story is told by brother Bisco that shortly after that meeting in Dawson Creek they brother Brandon brother Bisco and them had Trant planned to hunt up in the Northern Territory so after the meeting they they drove for hundreds of miles up in the Northern Territory getting ready to go hunting and they drove for these hundreds of miles and and to be able to find someone in this time you know it's not like it is today cell phones everywhere can track and can text and say where you add I'm coming to you nobody could pinpoint where you was but the Bisco says that they're at this little little kind of like a house little second section and and they go to eat at this little diner that there's they're there in this area and they're eating and here comes a man in and this soldier boy and this soldier boy comes up and and starts talking to brother branham there and brother branham just keeps eating his soup Mystikal says and describes the situation what happened and and what he's going through in it and both of bisco thought well surely he'll you know we'll pray for him right here you know just brother I'm sitting on okay just kept eating and so a little later and they said just to be able to find us was a miracle God allowed them to be at this place and said they walk out brother best school was standing there talking with the other man that's with this soldier boy and brother branham he takes and he takes the soldier boy by the shoulder he begins to walk him down the street and he's walking down the street and brother Bissell says that he's reading this man's life story what he's went through what spirit that's laying up on him he says you got a hug you got a wife and a son go home to him and he said you're free and that soldier boy brother Briscoe says that soldier boy turns around and starts hollering I'm free I'm free I'm free I'm free it runs down through there now there's a there's a picture of brother Branham maybe some of you've seen that he's standing in an almost a jean shirt and blue jeans and got a cowboy hat on turned a little sideways and and he's got a beard and a little bit of a beard whiskers there but you know had it not been for that happening they say that there never would have been that picture god knows where you're at God knows there's a light on the inside of you dad was up in Alaska preaching I'll tell you this here dad was in Alaska preaching and he was preaching and as he was preaching he was preaching God knows where you're all were you at where you're at and as he's preaching they have a bullhorn on the outside of this little church and it's almost like an Eskimo village area there that he that he was preaching in and as he's preaching God knows where you're at he's describing he says you might be a wall from the arming and you're up here running said but God knows where you're at the man sitting down the road that was a wall from the army setting in his truck said well I might as well go up there because he's talking about me that man was from Covington Virginia AWOL from the Army hidin in Alaska and God knew where he was at that moment at that time and knew how to draw him out and call him forth that man came in and - as far as we know he's still in the message today aren't you glad of that that God knows where you're at I'll tell you a little personal testimony of my own so I'd had a motorcycle and I would ride up and down the 33 up in the the mountains there on the 33 west going over to West Virginia there and me and my buddies we'd go up and down this mountain riding on their motorcycles and and so one day I was kind of the leader on the on that day and I went up through there and I hit a marker in the road and kind of got some some gravels underneath my back tire and my back tire slid out from underneath of me and I probably wasn't going as fast as I should have been you know and so my back tire slid up underneath out from underneath of me and and I started to roll my motorcycle hits the rock wall bounces into the other lane and I'm laying there in the ditch I'm just thinking I'm alive thank the Lord I'm alive and so one of my buddy come over grab me about my jacket and shakes me he said spit sir you did you did no no I'm not just let me lay here for a minute so after we got up and got the bike out the road and I told told my buddies hey you called this man said he's my buddy John Hinton I said he'll come pick me up I said he won't tell nobody I know he won't and so I knew them guys wouldn't tell nobody so I called Cassie I said hey meet me at the Honda dealership she said okay what's going on us I just meet me over there she said well I knew something was going on so she met me over there picked me up and by then now she knows that hey I've done wrecked and and I said don't you dare tell nobody because if mama finds out that I wrecked on my motorcycle she'll kill me she hated that thing anyhow so of course you know nobody's telling nobody dad's in Canada preaching for Harold Hildebrand I believe and he calls me the next morning and he says how you doing I'm sitting in my truck sitting in his driveway he says how you doing oh I'm doing good everything's good give me go up here to this auction here they got some guns he said okay so he said uh glad to see you made it through yeah yeah me too what you got what what do you mean daddies well I seen you wreck I seen the wheel spinning on your motorcycle and you laying over in that ditch and he said I'm just glad the Lord was with you and made you made it through I knew nobody else knew period at that moment at that time I knew that God knew where I was in my condition of life and those little things those little things in life to draw you out that light that says there's a little more for you come on up out of there let's stand did I preach that long

street of it and on either side of the river there was a tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nation's and there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve Him and they shall see his face and his name shall be on their foreheads this
