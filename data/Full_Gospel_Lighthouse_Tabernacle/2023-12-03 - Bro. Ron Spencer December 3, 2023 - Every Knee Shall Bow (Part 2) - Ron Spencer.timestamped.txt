[54:46] bless you Philippians chapter 2 and
[54:48] verse 5 let this mind be in you which
[54:52] was also in Christ Jesus
[54:55] who being in the form of God thought it
[54:58] not robbery to be equal with
[55:02] God but made himself of no
[55:05] reputation and took upon him the form of
[55:08] a servant and was made in the likeness
[55:11] of
[55:12] men and being found in fashion as a man
[55:17] he humbled himself became
[55:20] obedient unto death even the death of
[55:23] the cross wherefore God also hath highly
[55:28] exalted him and given him a name which
[55:32] is above every name that at the name of
[55:36] Jesus I love this that at the name of
[55:40] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[55:43] heaven things in Earth and things under
[55:47] the Earth and that every tongue should
[55:49] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[55:54] glory of God God the Father amen you may
[55:57] be seated today may God bless the
[55:59] reading of his
[56:01] word amen turn to your neighbor say it's
[56:04] good to be in
[56:07] church
[56:11] Amen brother brandham was in prayer for
[56:14] his
[56:16] father and I'll just I want to read this
[56:18] so I don't miss any important parts he
[56:20] said and something said unto me rise up
[56:23] and I I raised up and went walking and I
[56:27] went back into a field behind me and an
[56:30] old broom Sage field I've actually stood
[56:32] in that place and there standing not
[56:35] over 10 feet from me stood a man white
[56:40] garment
[56:41] on a little fella had his arms folded
[56:45] like this a beard kind of short hair
[56:50] down to the shoulders and and he was
[56:53] looking sideways from me like that
[56:56] peaceful looking
[56:58] figure but I couldn't understand it how
[57:02] his
[57:03] feet one just behind the other and the
[57:06] wind blowing his robe moving Sage
[57:10] blowing and I thought now now wait a
[57:13] minute and I bit myself and I said now
[57:16] I'm not
[57:17] asleep and I pulled down and pulled a
[57:20] little piece of of that Sage off you
[57:22] know and got it like a toothpick in it
[57:26] put it in my out mouth and I look back
[57:29] and I look toward the house and I said
[57:31] no I was in there praying for Dad and
[57:35] and something said to me to come out
[57:37] here and and here stands this
[57:40] man and I said I thought that looks like
[57:45] the Lord Jesus I thought I I wonder if
[57:48] it is and he was looking just exactly
[57:52] directly towards where our house sits
[57:54] now
[57:55] so I moved around this way to see if I
[57:58] could see him and and and I I could see
[58:02] the side of his face like like that and
[58:05] I had to turn away turn around and look
[58:08] this way to see him and and I
[58:11] said never moved him and I thought I
[58:15] believe I'll call him and I said
[58:19] Jesus and when he did he looked around
[58:22] like that
[58:23] and that's was all I
[58:26] remember he just reached out his
[58:30] arms and there's not an artist in the
[58:32] world could paint his picture the
[58:35] characters of his
[58:37] face the best I've ever seen is that
[58:40] Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 I've got
[58:43] it on the on all of the literature and
[58:46] everything that I use that's because
[58:49] that looks like like it or pretty near
[58:53] or as close as it could
[58:55] be he looked like a
[58:58] man and if he'd speak the world would
[59:02] come to an
[59:03] end and yet with so much love and
[59:06] kindness till you I I just pitched
[59:10] over and at daylight I found myself just
[59:13] at the break of a day my pajama shirt
[59:16] soaking wet with the tears and when I
[59:19] came to myself walking back through the
[59:23] BR Sage Brush
[59:25] field
[59:27] home I think about that every one of us
[59:30] has had some sort of a sitting here
[59:33] today have had some sort of a moment
[59:35] with the Lord maybe you didn't see him
[59:38] quite like that but he came to you maybe
[59:41] at your house or maybe in your car maybe
[59:45] sitting in church and all of a sudden
[59:47] this book became real personal to
[59:51] you now as long as you know it as a
[59:53] history book
[59:55] it's just
[59:57] stories but when the author of the book
[1:00:00] comes real to
[1:00:04] you and then you know that you know that
[1:00:07] you know that you
[1:00:09] know oh I like that don't
[1:00:12] you someone sent this to me this week
[1:00:15] and and I'm just going to quote it the
[1:00:17] best that I can there was a lady that
[1:00:20] she was a Christian woman she was making
[1:00:22] a journey and she was flying across one
[1:00:25] of the oceans heading toward Australia
[1:00:28] New Zealand
[1:00:29] area and they got into a
[1:00:32] storm and the storm was
[1:00:35] raging it was shaking that that plane so
[1:00:39] and it felt like the wings were getting
[1:00:41] ready to come off and everybody was
[1:00:43] screaming and screaming and screaming
[1:00:46] the they the even the airplane pilot
[1:00:50] asked them said ould you pray I've never
[1:00:52] been in anything like this' the lady
[1:00:55] sitting beside of this woman she was
[1:00:58] screaming with all of her
[1:01:00] heart and uh so this lady being a
[1:01:03] Christian she just went to
[1:01:05] prayer she prayed for peace to come in
[1:01:09] the storm then she prayed for that that
[1:01:13] that plane those people would settle
[1:01:15] down and come to peace you know peace in
[1:01:18] your
[1:01:18] storm and she prayed and she continued
[1:01:21] to pray and there just something hit
[1:01:23] that plane quietness begin to come into
[1:01:26] that cabin and people begin to hundreds
[1:01:28] of them begin to settle down storms
[1:01:31] still
[1:01:32] raging and she had one of those old old
[1:01:35] cameras to wear that you had to get your
[1:01:37] film developed and and she she put her
[1:01:41] camera right against the right against
[1:01:43] the window maybe you've done that before
[1:01:45] put her right against the window she
[1:01:47] wanted to capture the rain or the
[1:01:50] lightning as it was flashing and shaking
[1:01:53] those wings
[1:01:55] and and she took took a
[1:01:58] picture she would go home the plain
[1:02:01] would land she would go to a
[1:02:03] developer and and as the the week would
[1:02:06] go on the man that was doing the
[1:02:08] developing he said I I'd like for you to
[1:02:11] come and I'd like to talk to you about
[1:02:13] the picture that you
[1:02:15] took she said I don't want to talk about
[1:02:17] it on the plane but I'd like for you to
[1:02:21] I'd like for you to see what I have
[1:02:23] found
[1:02:25] she didn't know you know she was
[1:02:27] thinking lightning or she was thinking
[1:02:29] rain or the the plain's wings
[1:02:32] shaking and he said first of all before
[1:02:34] I show you
[1:02:36] this I was an atheist my family was my
[1:02:41] family was not
[1:02:42] Believers but when we saw this
[1:02:45] picture we have all give our heart to
[1:02:49] Jesus the picture was of a
[1:02:53] man from here down in a robe with his
[1:02:56] arm stretched out like
[1:03:00] this and he was standing in her storm
[1:03:04] not just her storm but everybody on the
[1:03:06] plane I want you to understand you may
[1:03:09] not ever get a picture like
[1:03:12] that you may never feel it but when that
[1:03:16] man saw it he immediately became a
[1:03:18] Christian I want to tell this to you
[1:03:21] he's not your lord until you make him
[1:03:23] your lord
[1:03:25] he's not your God until you make him
[1:03:27] your God you remember this the The Ten
[1:03:31] Commandments says have no other gods
[1:03:33] before
[1:03:35] me I don't want to make any graven
[1:03:38] images I don't want you to be an idolor
[1:03:41] listen God's not asking for he's not
[1:03:44] asking for second or third place in your
[1:03:46] life he wants to be first
[1:03:50] place he wants that total priority he
[1:03:53] wants to to be first in your life let me
[1:03:56] just say this to you as a young person
[1:03:59] if you make him
[1:04:01] first and I want to talk to you if you
[1:04:04] make him first he will take care of the
[1:04:07] entire rest of your
[1:04:09] life he'll help you in your schooling
[1:04:12] he'll help you in your education he'll
[1:04:14] help you in finding a mate he'll help
[1:04:16] you in your business he'll help you on
[1:04:19] your job I want you to understand once
[1:04:22] you walk into the hands of Jesus you'll
[1:04:24] never be
[1:04:27] alone I say that as simple as I know how
[1:04:30] to say it but I say it as profound as I
[1:04:32] know how to say it he's
[1:04:35] God he made the whole world he he is
[1:04:38] interested in your situations of your
[1:04:42] life aren't you glad of that
[1:04:45] tonight God of this evil age brother BR
[1:04:48] I'm going to give you a couple of quotes
[1:04:50] it says it's strange now after some 1900
[1:04:53] years of gospel
[1:04:55] preaching and now she that is the world
[1:04:58] system is more
[1:05:01] evil than in the days when that even
[1:05:04] when he was here the world system is
[1:05:08] more
[1:05:09] evil the world is headed to a great
[1:05:14] climax he's saying this 50 some years
[1:05:17] ago the world is headed to a great
[1:05:19] climax I believe we're just right
[1:05:23] there you know that the Lord is
[1:05:26] fulfilling his word on every hand just a
[1:05:30] few paragraphs later he says the world
[1:05:33] is headed to a climax the spirit of
[1:05:36] lawlessness lawlessness and moral Decay
[1:05:40] and scientific religion has led it to a
[1:05:44] cage of every hateful and unclean bird
[1:05:48] as the Bible said let's read it
[1:05:50] Revelations chapter 18 just while we're
[1:05:52] getting to this point he said
[1:05:54] Revelations 18 1:5 he said after these
[1:05:58] things I saw another Angel come down
[1:06:00] from heaven having great power and the
[1:06:02] Earth was lightened with his glory and
[1:06:05] he cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:06:07] now you people that that had the dreams
[1:06:10] and saying Babylon the greatest Fallen
[1:06:12] is Fallen has become a habitation of
[1:06:14] devils and and a hold of every every
[1:06:17] foul spirit and a cage of every unclean
[1:06:20] and and hateful bird for all nations
[1:06:24] have drank the wine of the wrath of her
[1:06:26] fornication amen and the kings of the
[1:06:29] Earth have committed fornications with
[1:06:32] her and the merchants of the Earth was
[1:06:34] wax Rich through the abundance of her
[1:06:37] delicacy and I heard another voice from
[1:06:40] Heaven saying come out of
[1:06:43] her come out of her I'm glad we heard
[1:06:46] this voice come out of her my people
[1:06:50] that you be not a partaker of her sins
[1:06:52] and that you receive not of her
[1:06:55] plagues for her sin has reached into the
[1:06:59] heavens and God remembers her
[1:07:03] iniquity what a warning that throws the
[1:07:06] church exactly back to Revelations 3
[1:07:08] and14 the layot to see an age
[1:07:13] lawlessness we're seeing
[1:07:17] it we're seeing it def find the
[1:07:22] police on
[1:07:25] listen they don't want strong
[1:07:28] preaching they don't want really clean
[1:07:32] television the moral Decay has come to a
[1:07:35] spot they don't even want a
[1:07:37] government that is clean and moral are
[1:07:40] you with me

[1:07:44] get satisfied here don't get comfortable
[1:07:48] here oh we want America to come back to
[1:07:50] her Revival she had her
[1:07:52] chance Russia had her
[1:07:55] chance Nations had their chance but they
[1:07:59] chose another
[1:08:01] way how could America being a nation of
[1:08:05] that we could be so proud of her her
[1:08:07] Godly generals her Godly president's
[1:08:10] fault or where she did is because she
[1:08:13] rejected the message of the
[1:08:20] hour let me just let me just speak a
[1:08:23] couple of things here what would have
[1:08:24] happened if the message would have been
[1:08:29] received what would have happened if the
[1:08:32] message had been received we'd have
[1:08:34] peace
[1:08:35] amen instead of our our ships being
[1:08:38] bombed today just happening bomb today
[1:08:42] in the Red Sea our our ships American
[1:08:46] ships and commercial ships are being
[1:08:48] bombed by the enemy right now as we
[1:08:51] speak we're just just so close to the
[1:08:56] Rapture and these things must be right
[1:08:59] but had they received the
[1:09:04] message but they they turned it down
[1:09:07] they didn't want a part of it oh they
[1:09:09] had a chance he stood in the he stood in
[1:09:12] Washington in the great Halls of
[1:09:15] Washington with with vice presidents
[1:09:17] sitting there men of great dignitaries
[1:09:20] and they saw the gift deep calleth to
[1:09:23] the Deep you'll know it by its by its
[1:09:25] title there they had an opportunity at
[1:09:28] the
[1:09:30] work they had an opportunity at the word
[1:09:33] brother Branda warned of where the
[1:09:35] spirits were coming from where the
[1:09:36] Beatles were coming from where Elvis
[1:09:38] Presley was taken Pat Boon where music
[1:09:41] was leading
[1:09:43] America he warned them at women getting
[1:09:46] the right to vote are you with me now
[1:09:48] they would vote in the a boy
[1:09:52] president the the suffrage movement that
[1:09:54] had happened for for hundreds and
[1:09:56] hundreds of years one day would begin to
[1:09:59] get its
[1:10:01] rights America doesn't want want a real
[1:10:07] Bible we're full we're we're Full Gospel
[1:10:10] people that that's because we believe in
[1:10:14] the Full
[1:10:17] Gospel but she's
[1:10:22] naked
[1:10:26] forgive
[1:10:27] me he said leay out to see an age
[1:10:32] law I had a thought I wanted to go there
[1:10:36] you take these precious police officers
[1:10:39] we've got serle
[1:10:41] here you take them out of our
[1:10:48] cities and these and if you really get
[1:10:50] down to it these people that are calling
[1:10:52] for police officers
[1:10:54] to not be
[1:10:55] funded they're rich
[1:10:58] enough to have their own
[1:11:00] guards cuz even they
[1:11:03] know I'm not going to go far with that
[1:11:05] they know this world is in a horrible
[1:11:10] condition they know
[1:11:13] that well we live in Harrisonburg have
[1:11:16] you read the
[1:11:18] news we live in Gros have you read the
[1:11:22] news uh you know that's happening in
[1:11:24] other cities no it's it's where you're
[1:11:27] at and it's because this is not our
[1:11:33] home and I want to spend eternity with
[1:11:38] you and with your
[1:11:44] children we were we were headed off the
[1:11:46] hill one day and brother and sister seab
[1:11:49] Breezers had stopped I believe it was
[1:11:51] maybe your first or second time here
[1:11:53] here and they had stopped I never knew
[1:11:56] who they were I I I I was just getting
[1:11:59] ready to pass by and Connie was driving
[1:12:02] and and as she's driving by I said stop
[1:12:04] I got to go back Spirit of the Lord
[1:12:06] spoke to me and said they're children of
[1:12:09] God lord they're not just visitors
[1:12:12] they're children of
[1:12:22] God never shook their hands and never
[1:12:25] talked to them personally ever but God
[1:12:28] witnessed I like it that God can witness
[1:12:31] to us that we're more than just family
[1:12:35] here we're more than just a group of
[1:12:38] people you're just not an accident
[1:12:40] walking in this building but we have
[1:12:42] been
[1:12:45] gathered we have been gathered by the
[1:12:47] great Garner
[1:12:52] himself
[1:12:54] pulled us together
[1:12:56] now we are
[1:12:59] rich and have need of
[1:13:02] nothing notice now God says knowest not
[1:13:06] that thou art
[1:13:08] naked miserable and blind and know it
[1:13:12] not I don't know if you've listened to
[1:13:14] that sermon lately or knoweth it not but
[1:13:16] it's one of the most powerful sermons
[1:13:17] that there is perfectly with the
[1:13:20] scripture of the
[1:13:21] age not the scrip of the age of Daniel
[1:13:24] not the ones of the age of of Noah but
[1:13:28] this last
[1:13:29] age this evil age I'm glad that God sent
[1:13:33] us a message that's specifically for our
[1:13:37] time so if he's a king he's got to have
[1:13:41] a people right now I want you to
[1:13:45] understand that and I don't mean to say
[1:13:47] this irreverently but in this world our
[1:13:50] Supreme Court is supposed to be the
[1:13:52] final author Authority or even our
[1:13:55] president can sign executive orders and
[1:13:58] it seems like that's the final Authority
[1:14:01] but just as soon as a new Administration
[1:14:06] comes as soon as a new ex he just acting
[1:14:09] like you as soon as a new Administration
[1:14:14] comes he will he will go and change all
[1:14:17] the rules of the man
[1:14:19] before right so Biden has did his best
[1:14:23] to change all of Trump's
[1:14:25] rules and so the next Administration
[1:14:28] will come and try to change all of
[1:14:30] Biden's rules but we're in a
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:35] kingdom God never has a new
[1:14:38] thought are you with me now he set this
[1:14:42] up in the beginning in his mind before
[1:14:44] there was a sun and moon and stars and
[1:14:47] if you were with him then you'll always
[1:14:49] be with
[1:14:52] him
[1:14:54] I love that don't you so in the
[1:14:56] Scriptures it says he swore by
[1:14:58] himself when he could swear by no
[1:15:03] greater right men swear by the greater
[1:15:06] Authority but God couldn't swear by a
[1:15:09] greater Authority because he was the
[1:15:12] greater Authority so he swore by
[1:15:15] himself and he wrote a covenant with the
[1:15:18] families of the earth God will not break
[1:15:21] his Covenant I want to say this to you
[1:15:24] it may feel like time has been
[1:15:25] lengthened out but it's exactly on
[1:15:28] time now the scripture says that Abraham
[1:15:32] looked for a
[1:15:33] city whose Builder and maker was God now
[1:15:37] there's a reason that he did that
[1:15:39] brother B said he would look east west
[1:15:41] north and south but what he should have
[1:15:43] done was look
[1:15:47] up I like that don't
[1:15:49] you because MDC was not from here
[1:15:54] he had no father he had no
[1:15:56] mother so he was not from here he was
[1:16:00] from
[1:16:01] there and when he came he he he blew
[1:16:05] himself a body and he stepped into it
[1:16:08] and he came and
[1:16:10] he he said but brother honor are you
[1:16:12] guys stretching that just a bit oh no
[1:16:15] cuz it had results that's right and it's
[1:16:17] it's pertinent to this age because he's
[1:16:20] visited this
[1:16:22] age so he blew himself a and he stepped
[1:16:25] in and he walked down the road and now
[1:16:27] if he was walking on the same road you
[1:16:29] wouldn't recognize him but Abraham had
[1:16:31] had fellowship with him and he had been
[1:16:34] told several different covenants so when
[1:16:38] when MDC comes into his gate Abraham
[1:16:42] calls him
[1:16:44] Lord but when the two angels meet with
[1:16:47] lot lot called them
[1:16:51] Lords but Abraham being a Son of
[1:16:56] God God had changed his name but he had
[1:17:00] heard the voice that was coming out of
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:06] bodyl so they prepare
[1:17:09] meat they prepare milk and he sits and
[1:17:14] you hear Brother Ram say he said he
[1:17:15] shooted the Flies off of
[1:17:18] him and they talk a little
[1:17:21] bit and you know they talk and remember
[1:17:25] he's got a covenant with him that he's
[1:17:27] going to have
[1:17:28] seed through
[1:17:31] Sarah and then he not only talks to
[1:17:33] Abraham but he talks to his
[1:17:37] wife and when he's talking to his wife
[1:17:41] he's got a reminder the promise is not
[1:17:43] just for Abraham but it's for
[1:17:47] her now God's not going to leave her in
[1:17:50] that that body that she couldn't believe
[1:17:53] leave for a baby to come through but he
[1:17:56] asked her a question Sarah is there
[1:18:00] anything too hard for God to
[1:18:03] do right now I want to ask you this this
[1:18:06] morning you're sitting in a in a message
[1:18:10] church and sometimes the enemy Whispers
[1:18:13] In Your Ear how long we've been
[1:18:16] believing this all these years and
[1:18:19] sometimes it just is a fable to you or
[1:18:22] maybe it's just old those guys get up
[1:18:24] and preach those kind of sermons over
[1:18:27] and over and don't you get tired of
[1:18:30] hearing those same sermons over and
[1:18:33] over well let's just talk about that
[1:18:35] just for a moment can you imagine being
[1:18:37] in Noah's day 120 years same
[1:18:44] sermon if you would have sit in the tent
[1:18:46] of Abraham and he's getting older and
[1:18:48] more decrepit and his age has begin to
[1:18:51] deteriorate on him and no doubt he was
[1:18:53] getting humiliated in his own flesh but
[1:18:56] he's got the same sermon I spoke to God
[1:18:59] and he's going to give me a
[1:19:01] son and maybe after a while you'd get
[1:19:04] tired of hearing Abraham looking the way
[1:19:06] he did and and maybe acting the way he
[1:19:09] did but he's got the same
[1:19:12] sermon I've been preaching the same
[1:19:14] message since I was
[1:19:16] redheaded my shoulders were strong and I
[1:19:19] could run and I could I could preach for
[1:19:22] for an hour or two and and I didn't wear
[1:19:26] out but now 40 minutes is almost too
[1:19:29] much for me but it's still the
[1:19:34] truth it's still the
[1:19:43] truth and the God that was my keeper as
[1:19:46] a boy that's been through all of the
[1:19:48] storms of my life he's still with us
[1:19:51] today
[1:19:53] I'm still as enthused about the Rapture
[1:19:56] as I've ever
[1:20:00] been
[1:20:02] hallelujah
[1:20:03] hallelujah there's
[1:20:06] nothing I want to say it there's
[1:20:10] nothing impossible to
[1:20:17] God one night you'll look in
[1:20:20] your in your
[1:20:30] miror I don't have them so I'm just got
[1:20:32] to mimic it
[1:20:34] here and you'll pull them out and you'll
[1:20:36] put them in that glass last
[1:20:42] time you calb your hair before you go to
[1:20:45] bed you know and it's gray and it's
[1:20:47] turning loose and for me with the Kimbo
[1:20:50] it's getting more wavy and more King
[1:20:53] here but I'm just glad I got
[1:20:57] it but one morning I'll get
[1:21:08] up and everything that I believed since
[1:21:11] I was a child and preached for 40 years
[1:21:14] I'll get up with a renewed
[1:21:16] step I'll look at these hands that don't
[1:21:19] have cancer spots on them anymore I'll
[1:21:21] look at them hands and they'll be
[1:21:24] pure I'll feel strength on the inside of
[1:21:27] me like a holy ghost strength down
[1:21:29] inside of me my shoulders will be pulled
[1:21:35] back and I walk in and blondies the
[1:21:37] Blondie that I walk down the aisle
[1:21:51] with I said in the kitchen the other
[1:21:53] morning and you know not feeling just
[1:21:56] what I ought to feel and I just started
[1:21:58] singing as long as I'm
[1:22:00] alive I'm going to be
[1:22:02] singing as long as I'm alive I'm going
[1:22:05] to be
[1:22:07] shouting there one thing that I
[1:22:10] know deep down in my
[1:22:13] soul as long as I'm
[1:22:21] alive
[1:22:32] now I want you to understand they might
[1:22:35] not want to do it now they may not want
[1:22:38] to bow to our lord Jesus but there's
[1:22:41] coming a
[1:22:47] time there's coming a
[1:22:51] time there's coming coming a
[1:22:53] time yes sir it's called our Millennium
[1:22:57] period he's going to be king on the
[1:23:00] earth King
[1:23:03] Jesus Son of
[1:23:06] Man Son of
[1:23:08] God priest he's going to be
[1:23:12] king the great part of that is you're
[1:23:15] you're going to be reigning with him as
[1:23:17] his
[1:23:19] wife a thousand years on this this Earth
[1:23:23] walking on the ashes of the
[1:23:26] wicked and from that time a transition
[1:23:29] will take place and people will be given
[1:23:31] longevity of
[1:23:34] Life they'll come in and out of that
[1:23:36] holy
[1:23:37] city now I'm not talking about the new
[1:23:40] world to come but that's going to be
[1:23:41] happening as well but but let me just
[1:23:43] say this you our God is going to bring
[1:23:46] peace to this
[1:23:48] earth a thousand years of rain my daddy
[1:23:52] would make make a statement over and
[1:23:53] over again if it was just about that
[1:23:55] without eternity it'd be worth serving
[1:24:02] God but that's only the
[1:24:06] beginning at the end of that Thousand
[1:24:08] Years Satan will rais his head up and
[1:24:10] deceive the whole world can you imagine
[1:24:13] that Humanity at the end of a thousand
[1:24:16] years of living in perfect
[1:24:20] peace perfect peace
[1:24:23] God will kind of allow the enemy to be
[1:24:26] loosed and he'll deceive the whole world
[1:24:29] that's why you have so much battle
[1:24:31] because the enemy that battles you has
[1:24:33] deceived the whole
[1:24:35] world Psalms 72 and verse 11 yay all
[1:24:41] Kings shall fall down before him

[1:32:08] Ron
[1:32:10] run and you know his
[1:32:13] voice and just a and listen you can be
[1:32:16] in the worst war of your life that is
[1:32:18] going on from week to week in your home

[1:32:31] moment he can change it
[1:32:33] [Music]
[1:32:38] all how do you know that let me give you
[1:32:40] an example three Hebrew children refuse
[1:32:45] to bend or to
[1:32:48] Bow even to the image of their Prophet
[1:32:51] Daniel
[1:32:54] they wouldn't bow to the prophet that's
[1:32:55] why brother brandom didn't want you to
[1:32:57] worship him right he didn't when he was
[1:33:00] on Earth don't do it
[1:33:03] now we're not to worship a man are you
[1:33:05] with me we're born of sin and shaping in
[1:33:09] iniquity that's why God took he took
[1:33:13] human flesh and took a redeemable man to
[1:33:16] speak the message
[1:33:18] through and even even in the scriptures
[1:33:21] said the man wanted the angel wanted to
[1:33:23] Bow and worship me and said see thou
[1:33:25] doeth it not I'm of thy fellow servants
[1:33:27] the prophet amen God don't want no man
[1:33:32] that's
[1:33:33] it brother Homer always had a statement
[1:33:36] I thought it was good he said people get
[1:33:38] around me long enough they won't worship
[1:33:43] me for you that know you know for you
[1:33:45] that don't know or you just got an
[1:33:49] idea no man is is to be your
[1:33:53] Lord You're to constantly keep your eyes
[1:33:56] on
[1:33:57] Jesus you'll never be disappointed in
[1:34:01] Jesus now he becomes the king of your
[1:34:03] heart that blood cell you become
[1:34:08] literally a relative to
[1:34:11] him now in an
[1:34:14] inheritance in an inheritance uh You've
[1:34:17] Got to Be Blood
[1:34:20] relative for for for my children to to
[1:34:24] get my inheritance it's got to be by
[1:34:28] Blood now should I live to 150 years old
[1:34:33] not going to happen but should I live to
[1:34:35] 150 years old and and the man that's
[1:34:39] over top of the wheel he will have to go
[1:34:42] back and find there may be 300 people in
[1:34:46] that well we're talking about a an
[1:34:47] explosion of humanity aren't we but 300
[1:34:50] people in the
[1:34:53] wheel and so the man that's watching
[1:34:56] over the watching over the
[1:35:01] wheel not the Proctor but what's that
[1:35:04] man the executive of the
[1:35:07] will it's his
[1:35:10] responsibility I'm going to go to a
[1:35:12] point here it's good looking sale you
[1:35:14] got this week so he I'm not going to
[1:35:17] talk to you about
[1:35:19] yourself but he is to make sure it's his
[1:35:24] total responsibility to make
[1:35:27] sure that you have a right to be a
[1:35:31] partaker in the
[1:35:34] will are you with me you have a right to
[1:35:36] be a partaker in the whe so you have to
[1:35:39] be blood relative of Ron
[1:35:44] Spencer not married into the family you
[1:35:47] got to be blood relative of Ron Spencer
[1:35:52] that's why this message is so
[1:35:56] important it didn't come to get the
[1:35:58] whole
[1:35:59] world but it was finding the blood
[1:36:04] relatives the blood relatives of our
[1:36:07] Lord Jesus
[1:36:11] Christ that ought to make you want to
[1:36:13] shout there just for a few
[1:36:16] minutes now you know I know I know some
[1:36:20] things are in life are difficult so I'm
[1:36:24] not going to get finished and I'm
[1:36:25] getting kind of weak here but you mind
[1:36:29] if I grab a chair you mind if I grab a
[1:36:32] chair because I want to finish maybe
[1:36:34] we'll set the chair out
[1:36:36] front let's do that is that okay I want
[1:36:39] to finish and
[1:36:41] so yeah maybe I'll finish from here and
[1:36:46] so you know in the Scriptures it talks
[1:36:49] about it talks about a man named
[1:36:55] Joseph and so Joseph
[1:36:58] was you know nowhere could he find
[1:37:01] that you know I'm portraying Jesus
[1:37:06] Christ I
[1:37:08] mean he didn't get a certified letter
[1:37:10] that's saying now
[1:37:12] Joseph you're going to portray Jesus
[1:37:15] Christ and he could be a part of this
[1:37:18] sermon every knee shall
[1:37:20] bow so I'm not way off here so Joseph as
[1:37:24] a little boy he is born of the woman of
[1:37:28] Jacob that he wanted to
[1:37:30] have and you know Leah has four sons and
[1:37:33] the other wives had Sons but but of of
[1:37:38] Jacob Rachel was the woman that he loved
[1:37:41] when he first saw her he loved her and
[1:37:45] you know you know he was willing to work
[1:37:47] seven years to get her and then when he
[1:37:50] was deceived D he had to work seven more
[1:37:53] years to get her couldn't have children
[1:37:56] by her and and the other girls made fun
[1:37:59] of her but finally he has two sons by
[1:38:01] her and one is Joseph and and and one is
[1:38:06] Benjamin don't take it for granted that
[1:38:09] Israel's leader is named Benjamin nitan
[1:38:14] yahu
[1:38:16] brother what a place to put him in
[1:38:20] history
[1:38:22] so we're going to get done quick
[1:38:24] here so
[1:38:27] Joseph you know he gets a special
[1:38:30] coat listen when you're in a big family
[1:38:33] and all of a sudden you're one of
[1:38:38] [Laughter]
[1:38:44] 12 it just seems like maybe this one boy
[1:38:48] we're all his sons but he seems to be
[1:38:51] getting a lot of
[1:38:52] favoritism we're working in the fields
[1:38:54] and he's staying around
[1:38:56] home you know Joseph is is that favorite
[1:39:00] so when he he develops a coat and it's
[1:39:03] got all this special coloring in
[1:39:06] it he gives that coat to
[1:39:10] Joseph yeah that cause trouble in
[1:39:13] church and so and so then Joseph starts
[1:39:18] having dreams there wasn't a book come
[1:39:21] along with don't tell these dreams CU
[1:39:23] people will get upset so Joseph starts
[1:39:26] telling his dreams and one of his dreams
[1:39:29] was that there would be sheaves in the
[1:39:31] field and they would all bow to
[1:39:35] him sheaves were his brothers oh yeah
[1:39:38] that worked out real
[1:39:41] well all of us are going to bend down
[1:39:43] and worship you not a
[1:39:50] chance now you know now the feelings in
[1:39:53] the church was real difficult are you
[1:39:55] with me now just stay with
[1:39:56] me they're all family here and now now
[1:40:00] Joseph is telling the Dream well now he
[1:40:02] tells the Ultimate Dream the sun and the
[1:40:05] moon are going to
[1:40:07] bow that many his mother and father were
[1:40:10] going to Bow Down and Worship Him hey it
[1:40:13] works real good with the brothers until
[1:40:15] now Jacob was going you know huh I'm
[1:40:18] going to bow to
[1:40:19] you
[1:40:21] but the dreams were saying every
[1:40:31] knee now Joseph didn't have to go into
[1:40:33] the fields and work with the sheep and
[1:40:36] he stayed around the house but Jacob
[1:40:39] said w't you go check on your
[1:40:41] brothers listen they hated him by now
[1:40:45] these dreams coming and I'm not going to
[1:40:47] go deep into into it but here's his guy
[1:40:49] being spiritual we're all Daddy's Sons
[1:40:53] we're blood relatives how does he think
[1:40:56] that we're going to worship
[1:40:59] him so they make a plan we'll get rid of
[1:41:04] him we'll get rid of this
[1:41:07] Jesus and so they get him and one of the
[1:41:11] brothers says no no no no we can't kill
[1:41:13] him we we can't do that we're not going
[1:41:15] to we're not going to shed shed innocent
[1:41:17] blood he's our
[1:41:19] brother so they begin to make plans
[1:41:22] someone to kill him but one of the
[1:41:24] brothers said no no no no no but what
[1:41:27] they did is they took his took him and
[1:41:29] throwed him in a
[1:41:33] pit and then a little softness hit their
[1:41:36] heart here come some Traders
[1:41:40] through and they sold him for pieces of
[1:41:46] silver because that was going to be a
[1:41:49] type of Judas
[1:41:51] selling him for
[1:41:55] silver he didn't know he was going to
[1:41:57] pay play the part of Jesus being sold
[1:41:59] out so now he finds himself in
[1:42:03] Egypt thinking I'll never see my
[1:42:05] brothers again I'll never see my mom and
[1:42:08] dad again I'll never see Benjamin
[1:42:10] again well he's still not just Jacob's
[1:42:14] son but he's God's
[1:42:16] son now just because you're going to
[1:42:18] have to go through some difficulties
[1:42:19] that don't mean God left you
[1:42:23] are just just because you're going
[1:42:26] through cancer don't mean that God's Not
[1:42:27] Your healer or he's not watching over
[1:42:30] you or he'll give you
[1:42:32] strength so he it gets sold to a man
[1:42:36] that's quite a rich man and he's quite
[1:42:38] well reowned in the political system
[1:42:41] there and he brings him in and he can
[1:42:44] count he's super
[1:42:45] smart and now he becomes a a man in
[1:42:49] business right there in the home and
[1:42:51] that man's business becomes super
[1:42:54] successful even to the point till he
[1:42:57] gives him authority over everything but
[1:42:59] now his wife wants to destroy the
[1:43:03] plan he refuses to file
[1:43:06] himself and so he runs and gets out of
[1:43:10] his
[1:43:11] coat and so she makes up a lie on
[1:43:14] him Joseph finds himself
[1:43:18] further away from the
[1:43:21] Visions but
[1:43:24] closer listen God's not taking you
[1:43:27] further away he's taking you
[1:43:32] closer so he finds himself in prison
[1:43:35] prison is not a good
[1:43:37] place he finds himself in a horrible
[1:43:41] condition but now he's there and Seema
[1:43:44] he's
[1:43:45] forgotten but now he finds himself with
[1:43:49] a butler and a
[1:43:51] Baker he gains confidence with them they
[1:43:55] have a dream and he interprets their
[1:43:58] dream one man's going to be lifted the
[1:44:01] other man's going to
[1:44:03] die soon as you get out of prison one's
[1:44:05] going to be restored the other man's
[1:44:06] going to die and did it not it happen
[1:44:10] and remember what Joseph said remember
[1:44:11] me remember me when you get
[1:44:15] out but it seems like he's forgotten
[1:44:18] listen one day in prison is too long two
[1:44:20] days in prison too long years in prison
[1:44:22] listen he's there for a while listen he
[1:44:25] could remember the dreams but I seem to
[1:44:28] be further
[1:44:30] away and now Pharaoh has a dream and all
[1:44:33] of his men and all of his soothsayers
[1:44:35] and all of his goddesses and Prophets
[1:44:37] can't reveal it and the memory comes
[1:44:40] back to one of these men that he's been
[1:44:42] in prison with and he said I met a man
[1:44:44] in
[1:44:46] prison exactly took place I'd be raised
[1:44:49] and and this other guy would be
[1:44:52] destroyed it happened exactly right yeah
[1:44:55] everything he said was exactly right
[1:44:58] bring me the man and they bring him the
[1:45:01] man and he tells Pharaoh his exact
[1:45:04] vision of what it was going to go on
[1:45:06] there's going to be famine there's going
[1:45:07] to be seven years of of riches and seven
[1:45:11] years of drought this is what you've got
[1:45:13] to do because you're the you're going to
[1:45:16] be the strongest nation in the whole
[1:45:19] world
[1:45:22] and you're going to raise up and you're
[1:45:24] going to teach Moses how to be a real
[1:45:26] leader but I got to get you to a spot to
[1:45:29] where you
[1:45:31] can and Moses interprets the dream you
[1:45:34] know what happens to him he becomes the
[1:45:37] right-hand man to
[1:45:40] Pharaoh as a matter of fact his words
[1:45:44] are as powerful as Pharaoh's
[1:45:48] words Stay With Me Now he has the
[1:45:51] authority to write a
[1:45:57] check he has the authority when listen
[1:46:00] when he goes out into the streets the
[1:46:03] Egyptians bow down to worship
[1:46:07] him listen you're you're thrilled to
[1:46:09] have Joseph walking through you're
[1:46:12] thrilled to have him coming through he
[1:46:15] saved your
[1:46:17] nation he's brought wealth to your
[1:46:19] family he's brought peace and so when he
[1:46:22] comes through they sound the horns and
[1:46:25] Joseph walks through and they worship
[1:46:31] him now he marries a gentile
[1:46:36] wife what do you
[1:46:39] know he marries a gentile wife he didn't
[1:46:42] go marry a Jewish lady he married a a
[1:46:46] gentile
[1:46:48] wife has children by her
[1:46:52] now as time would go the seven years of
[1:46:55] plenty and they feel their Garner so
[1:46:57] full listen now they're able to feed the
[1:47:00] whole world because the time of famine
[1:47:03] is
[1:47:05] coming it'll happen seasons of your life
[1:47:08] Seasons you'll feel like you're in the
[1:47:10] bride's Revival there are seasons where
[1:47:12] everything just is real
[1:47:14] quiet but he's still
[1:47:19] godl
[1:47:23] would you hand me that
[1:47:25] drink
[1:47:27] so now the famine strikes Jacob's home
[1:47:31] thank you you look good in that
[1:47:35] outfit and now it hits Jacob's home hits
[1:47:38] the
[1:47:39] brothers it incredible they can't find
[1:47:43] corn
[1:47:44] anywhere but there's corn in
[1:47:48] Egypt they don't know where Joseph wound
[1:47:51] up but there's corn in
[1:47:54] Egypt God has pushed it to a point till
[1:47:56] now you got to go to
[1:47:59] Egypt and so here's these boys and they
[1:48:04] put all their money on their their
[1:48:05] animals and and they head in they're
[1:48:08] going to get some
[1:48:11] corn and they don't know who the man is
[1:48:14] that's over top of it all cuz they can't
[1:48:17] recognize him that's right not in his
[1:48:19] outfit that he's in they can't recognize
[1:48:24] him now now is not the
[1:48:27] time now's not the time for him to
[1:48:30] reveal who he
[1:48:32] is but they don't realize they're
[1:48:34] fulfilling one of the dreams that he had
[1:48:37] when he was a boy and they're bowing
[1:48:40] down because now it's a livelihood and
[1:48:43] they're bowing down to get the corn and
[1:48:45] get the vils and get everything that
[1:48:46] they have need
[1:48:49] of and and now their brother is standing
[1:48:52] in a
[1:48:54] position because God has exalted him to
[1:48:56] that
[1:49:00] spot he asked him some real questions he
[1:49:03] said is your father still
[1:49:08] living
[1:49:10] yeah you have a little
[1:49:13] brother is he is he
[1:49:16] okay well I'm not going to give you what
[1:49:18] you want till you go get them bring them
[1:49:20] here well they thought oh man he's going
[1:49:22] to put us all in
[1:49:24] prison you know hey he he's going to go
[1:49:26] put us all in prison he's not just
[1:49:28] wanting us here now he's going to put us
[1:49:30] all
[1:49:32] in you don't mind me telling a story or
[1:49:34] two do
[1:49:37] you and so they don't know what's going
[1:49:41] on you know what our Nations don't know
[1:49:44] what's going
[1:49:47] on they're just being they're right in
[1:49:49] the will of God they're just following
[1:49:51] right along the plan of God Sodom and
[1:49:54] gah the nations of the world are headed
[1:49:57] to a One World Government there's going
[1:49:59] to come a man on the earth that's
[1:50:01] probably already here but he's going to
[1:50:02] be Anointed with a man of sin and he's
[1:50:05] going to sembly be the peace over the
[1:50:07] all the world but that's not the king
[1:50:09] that we're looking for but our King is
[1:50:14] coming our King is
[1:50:18] Coming can you imagine Joseph's feelings
[1:50:21] when he sees
[1:50:25] Jacob can you imagine his feelings when
[1:50:28] he sees
[1:50:33] Benjamin and he creates a great feast
[1:50:36] for
[1:50:38] them you
[1:50:40] know the kind of feast that we enjoy
[1:50:43] around the message of the
[1:50:45] hour and they just know this man as a
[1:50:48] leader in
[1:50:52] Egypt but here we are decades
[1:50:57] later and all of a sudden the man that's
[1:50:59] standing at the head of the
[1:51:02] table and his Gentile wife he says
[1:51:05] now I'm going to go ahead and dismiss
[1:51:07] you for a little while I need to talk to
[1:51:09] these
[1:51:10] men because she don't know
[1:51:14] either so let's just say it's at the
[1:51:17] wedding
[1:51:18] supper and and he leaves for just a
[1:51:21] little while
[1:51:23] and and he comes down to
[1:51:26] Israel and he reveals who he is like he
[1:51:29] did with the Seven Seals he reveals it
[1:51:32] through the seven
[1:51:33] trumpets and he said I'm Jesus I'm Jesus
[1:51:37] whom you
[1:51:38] crucified where did you get those nail
[1:51:40] scars in your hands I got them in the
[1:51:43] hands of my
[1:51:45] brethren don't
[1:51:47] worry will you give that to him
[1:51:51] you put that in the back it'll be okay
[1:51:53] I'll take care of that in a few minutes
[1:51:56] well where did you get the scars I got
[1:51:59] them in the household of my
[1:52:03] friends and then he reveals who he
[1:52:09] is I don't know exactly how he did it
[1:52:12] but I'd say he probably started out you
[1:52:15] remember there was a little boy that had
[1:52:17] visions and dreams
[1:52:21] yeah and here we are decades later and
[1:52:25] now those dreams are coming
[1:52:28] true and you've just bowed to me
[1:52:32] fulfilling the word of the
[1:52:36] Lord Kings of the
[1:52:39] earth you didn't believe the message all
[1:52:41] the time but I want to tell you I'm
[1:52:47] Jesus are you with me
[1:52:50] and I want to reveal to you my
[1:52:53] wife she's a gentile wife and I I picked
[1:52:57] her out of every nation and every tongue
[1:53:00] and every
[1:53:08] people and they wouldn't let your
[1:53:10] natural president be their king or they
[1:53:12] wouldn't let your natural King be their
[1:53:14] King they chose
[1:53:17] me because I chose
[1:53:20] them and then they realized the
[1:53:23] statement every knee shall bow and every
[1:53:27] tongue shall
[1:53:29] confess why don't you just give him a
[1:53:31] great big
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:45] hand I love you with all my heart and I
[1:53:49] will preach to you you as long as I got
[1:53:51] strength in my
[1:53:52] beings amen God bless
[1:54:04] you I love you with all of my heart amen
[1:54:09] I love you with all my heart as long as
