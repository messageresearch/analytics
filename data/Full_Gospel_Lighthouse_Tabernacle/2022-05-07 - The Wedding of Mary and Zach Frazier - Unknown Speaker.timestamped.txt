[23:43] [Music]
[25:19] this thing
[25:21] please
[25:28] [Music]
[26:10] you may be seated
[26:14] on behalf of the families we would like
[26:16] to thank each and every one of you for
[26:17] coming today
[26:20] what a glorious day that this is
[26:22] how god has blessed this whole event
[26:25] and we're so thankful for
[26:28] and we celebrate this moment of two
[26:29] lives becoming one
[26:31] and we're very honored to be a part of
[26:33] it
[26:35] we know that god has an infinite purpose
[26:37] in this day
[26:38] he's already expressed that in several
[26:40] different ways
[26:43] i would like to think
[26:45] on behalf of
[26:47] them
[26:48] for special guests brother kelly and
[26:51] sister myra hildebrandt
[26:53] for being here from saskatoon
[26:56] canada and so we certainly
[26:59] love them with all of our hearts
[27:02] there's also guests
[27:03] watching on from another dimension
[27:06] and two of them would be
[27:09] dottie
[27:10] and rodney
[27:11] that would be watching
[27:13] as a part of this today
[27:17] two years ago i had a vision
[27:20] and that vision was that we would be
[27:22] standing here
[27:24] at this altar
[27:28] mary and zach
[27:31] and i told them that vision two years
[27:33] ago
[27:36] that we would be standing here
[27:39] it would be a glimpse of what god knows
[27:42] in the future
[27:44] and as i heard them talk about wanting
[27:46] to have an outside wedding
[27:49] we planned it
[27:50] i watched it take place
[27:53] i told sister connie i said
[27:55] i can't tell him anything
[27:57] i can't put any influence on it but god
[28:00] said would be
[28:02] according to the vision be standing here
[28:05] i think it's really interesting that
[28:08] god in all of his infinite wisdom
[28:11] in all the world spinning in their orbit
[28:15] he cares about the little bitty details
[28:18] of the situations of our lives
[28:21] so we realize that this wedding
[28:24] has supernatural element
[28:26] to it all together
[28:28] i personally want to congratulate you
[28:30] too
[28:31] before once again before you get married
[28:36] the lord god said it is not good
[28:40] for man to be alone
[28:42] i will make a helper suitable for him
[28:45] and the lord god made a woman from the
[28:47] rib that he had taken out of the man
[28:50] and he brought her unto the man
[28:53] and the man said
[28:55] this is now bone of my bones and flesh
[28:58] of my flesh
[29:00] for this reason a man will leave his
[29:02] father and his mother
[29:03] and be joined to his wife
[29:06] and they will become one flesh
[29:09] proverbs 31 talks about you mary
[29:13] a woman of notable character
[29:16] who can find
[29:18] she is worth far more than rubies
[29:21] her husband has full confidence in her
[29:24] and lacks nothing of value
[29:27] always remind zach of these words
[29:33] she brings him good
[29:35] not harm
[29:37] all the days of her life
[29:40] marriage has always been a joyous
[29:42] occasion
[29:43] in canaan of galilea
[29:45] it was gladdened by the presence
[29:48] and the blessing of the lord jesus
[29:49] himself
[29:51] because god intended marriage
[29:54] to bring the blessing of joy to our
[29:57] lives
[29:59] if you'll remember that
[30:02] jesus blessed water and turned it into
[30:06] wine
[30:09] and he knows how to take care of your
[30:10] lives
[30:13] and if he could take and bless 52
[30:16] barrels of water and make it the best
[30:19] wine that was in the whole region
[30:23] he knows how to take care of every
[30:24] little detail
[30:26] and when you're talking to him
[30:28] you believe that he can meet your needs
[30:32] the scripture says that god is the
[30:34] author of love
[30:36] the bible teaches us that god is love
[30:39] and that love comes from god
[30:42] from the beginning to the end the bible
[30:45] is a love story
[30:48] there we read of god's love for his
[30:49] people
[30:51] of the love that he sent christ
[30:53] to the cross to redeem us
[30:56] love for the sinner
[30:58] the abiding love for the redeemed
[31:02] we read of the love of a man and a woman
[31:04] of jacob's love for
[31:06] of rachel
[31:07] mary pledged to joseph the shulamite and
[31:10] her beloved
[31:12] in the beginning when the lord god
[31:14] formed man from the dust of the ground
[31:17] he placed him in the garden of eden
[31:20] and adam was lonely
[31:22] so the lord made a companion a helper
[31:25] for him
[31:26] and he was no longer lonely
[31:30] he was busy from that time on
[31:34] the scriptures tells us
[31:36] husbands
[31:37] love your wives
[31:39] just as christ loved the church and gave
[31:41] himself for her
[31:43] to make her holy cleansing her by the
[31:45] washing of the water through the word to
[31:47] present her to himself as a radiant
[31:50] church without a stain or wrinkle or a
[31:53] blemish
[31:54] but holy and blameless
[31:57] in the same way husbands are to love
[31:59] their wives as their own bodies
[32:02] wives
[32:03] submit yourselves to your husbands as to
[32:05] the lord
[32:07] for the husband is the head of the wife
[32:10] as christ is the head of the church his
[32:13] body of which he is the savior
[32:15] now as the church submits to christ so
[32:18] also wives
[32:20] should submit themselves to their
[32:22] husbands and everything
[32:24] god leads us take advantage of that one
[32:27] god leads us
[32:30] to our life's companion
[32:33] we're taught by a prophet of the lord
[32:34] that we stepped out of eternity
[32:37] into a space of time
[32:39] and you found one another
[32:42] and you'll live life
[32:44] and you'll step back into eternity again
[32:49] what a wonderful thought
[32:51] what an absolute wonderful thought
[32:57] abraham prayed
[32:59] that god would find a wife for his son
[33:02] isaac
[33:03] and god remembered the prayer
[33:06] and abraham's servant found
[33:08] rebecca the servant bowed and worshiped
[33:11] and praising god
[33:14] then he brought her to his master son
[33:16] the scripture says
[33:18] that isaac loved her
[33:21] and was comforted
[33:23] the scripture says that love is patient
[33:26] love is kind
[33:28] it does not envy
[33:30] it does not boast
[33:33] it is not proud
[33:35] it is not rude
[33:38] is not self-seeking
[33:40] it is not easily angered
[33:42] it keeps no record of wrongs
[33:45] love does not delight in evil but
[33:47] rejoices with truth
[33:50] it always protects
[33:52] it always trusts
[33:54] and it always hopes
[33:56] and love always preserves
[34:00] the union that you're about to embody
[34:04] with these ideas is not to be entered
[34:07] into
[34:08] lightly or unadvisedly
[34:11] but reverently disgracefully soberly in
[34:14] the fear of god
[34:16] into such a union you're about to be
[34:19] joined
[34:21] our declaration of consent
[34:24] zach

[34:29] to live together in a holy covenant of
[34:31] marriage

[34:35] and keep her in sickness and in health
[34:38] forsaking all others

[34:43] of you shall live

[38:17] promise
[38:21] having this kind of love in your hearts
[38:24] you have chosen to exchange
[38:26] rings as a sign and a seal of the vow
[38:30] that you are making today
[38:33] though small in size these rings are
[38:35] very large in significance
[38:37] made of precious metals
[38:40] they remind us that love is not cheap
[38:43] it's not common
[38:44] indeed love may cost us dearly
[38:48] made in a circle
[38:50] their design tells us that love must
[38:53] never end
[38:54] or ever come to an end
[38:57] we must keep it continuous
[39:00] and as you wear these rings
[39:02] whether together
[39:03] or apart
[39:05] for a moment
[39:07] may these rings be a constant reminder
[39:10] of the glad promises that you are making
[39:13] today
[39:24] i give you this ring as a symbol of my
[39:26] bow
[39:29] and with all that i am
[39:31] and all that i have
[39:34] i honor you in the name of the lord
[39:35] jesus christ
[39:41] [Music]
[39:48] i give you this ring
[39:51] as a symbol of my vow
[39:54] with all that i am
[39:57] and all that i have
[39:59] i honor you in the name of the lord
[40:01] jesus christ
[40:10] in ecclesiastes chapter 4 and verse 9
[40:15] the scripture says that two are better
[40:17] than one
[40:18] because they have a good return for
[40:20] their work
[40:22] if one falls down
[40:24] his friend can help him up
[40:26] but pity the man who falls and has no
[40:28] one to help him
[40:31] if two lie down together
[40:33] they will keep warm
[40:35] but how can one keep warm alone
[40:38] the one may be overpowered
[40:41] and two can defend themselves
[40:43] a cord of three strands
[40:47] is not quickly broken
[40:50] today
[40:51] zach
