know Monday through Friday those are just details that's just life that's so temporal everything that happens Monday through Friday in the natural is going to pass away but brother Gabriel what we partake of now on the weekend that is of Eternal value everything you have Monday through Friday you can't take with you but the things you get here we'll be with you amen throughout all eternity amen blessed be the name of the Lord God bless each and every one of you we want to be remembering brother Andrew as he's there ministering in Canada and we know the Lord are going to do great things because he's faithful to the end amen tonight if you'll turn with me in three different places we'll first start in the book of habakkuk and then the second Peter we'll start off in have a cook just a simple simple thought tonight the Lord is laid upon upon my heart pray it'll just be a blessing to you amen the word of the Lord is always a blessing amen have a cook 2-3 the Bible says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not Tarry amen a second Peter 1 verse 4. familiar text brother and took this when preaching the stature of a perfect man whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence at your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity one more while you're flipping to James chapter one that's God's Building Material that is his building materials when he builds his kind of man his kind of son and daughters that's that's the building materials that God puts in his church in James 1 verse 2 my brethren count it all joy when he fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God they giveth to all men liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waverth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and toss for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways I want to read verse 3 and verse 4 again knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience God's got a purpose in trying your faith but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen God bless you you can be seated with the Lord's help I like to speak on the title to title this tonight let patience have her perfect work now for a little group participation here maybe take a moment and think of something that you've asked the Lord for you're trusting the Lord for and you've been asking him it doesn't matter and what realm it is it can be physical it can be spiritual it can be Financial regardless of what realm how many in this audience tonight are trusting the Lord for something that you have not yet received can we have an uplift in hand amen we're all holding on to something that we have not received yet and we keep waiting for it and we keep praying for it we keep crying out to God for it for our prodigals for lost loved ones maybe for a spouse in life it doesn't matter all these things if it's important to you it's important to God so we have these things that we keep praying and we keep praying and we're trying to be perseverant and look in the scriptures like this there are Phoenician woman that refused to give up and just keep knocking and we keep crying out to God now that we live in and lay out a Sia and is all around us and we're constantly Amazed by all the new technologies you know now you can just send a text and you can send what you have been able to for years but the Technologies of the phones and just the Technologies all around us give us instant gratification I would imagine that if any of us tried once you have you know what they call a smartphone once you if you were to try and go to a flip phone it'd be very challenging because we've gotten so used to the instant gratification of hey look at this hey you know send me a picture of this so I'll know what kind of item you need from the grocery store you know we're so used to just having that instant gratification that instant we wanted now we want it yesterday but you know no matter how much man keeps moving in that direction God hasn't changed his ways and that's where the challenge of the flesh comes in because we want it now we want to ASAP but yet God hasn't changed in how he does things he hasn't changed and how he answers prayer he's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God doesn't change now in the in the church age but the satire in church age brother Ram says here I know your faith he's quoting there and what Jesus is telling the church the fact iron Church age now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamos you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now but he's commending them for their faithfulness as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1 3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith Romans 5 3 tribulation work with patience how highly god require regards this outworking of our patients as seen in James 1 4. but let patients have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire liking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience now patience is a problem with Humanity we all need more patience it it goes our human nature is that we want it to happen God I've been asking you and I've been praying why isn't it here yet but God has his own way and in fact God as a loving father says I'm going to wait and make you wait rather to test your faith because the testing of your faith in me will give you more patience for what's coming down the road he says and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is a process of character development this is why we live in such a characterless age is because nobody in the world has patience for anything if Christians struggle with impatience how much more does the world so why is patience so important is because God builds character and he wants rugged Christians he doesn't want spoiled Christians the word some of the worst things we can do as parents is spoil is constantly give everything they want our children wants the minute they want it every single time in Galatians 5 22 long-suffering and but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness Temperance against such there's no law patience is the Fruit of the Spirit we have to wait on the Lord and that is the trying time that is what's so difficult to our Humanity Isaiah 40 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary the young men shall early fall but they that wait upon the Lord those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with the wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint why because you waited on the Lord Brethren said in the message perseverance he said the trouble of it with we people we're too much we're in too much of a hurry it's got to be done right now can't go back no more and when you get that in your mind you're going to lose right there you're on losing grounds right there you have nothing to stand on you must be patient God is in no hurry he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever turned a finger that's right he let Daniel go right into the lion's den Let Jesus go Plumbing to the grave and his soul descended to hell then raised him right up through the Bottomless Pits we just get in a hurry is the only thing you see we miss it but sight and time wrote The Prophet said is God's worst enemy and if it's God's worst enemy it's your worst enemy it's my worst enemy because we get so caught up in time and how long we're seeing something or maybe how long we're not seeing something we prayed for this but we're not seeing it yet so time goes on goes on goes on and we're still not seeing it and that is our enemy because we are to live and look at the Unseen not what we see but the monotony of Life can drag on it can drag on and there doesn't seem to be a change I say there doesn't seem to be a change but God is still working so if it's your enemy or if it's God's enemy rather than it's also your enemy because God Will Make A promise and then his people will begin to believe they'll Rejoice But as time goes on and they begin to look at circumstances around them it makes them to begin to lose faith if you need an example read the story of the children of Israel they were rejoicing until they were rejoicing with the grapes until they seen the Giants so time and sin they're they're directly connected the reason we're even in a time element now the reason that you even have watches and that you ever pay attention to the calendar and that you even care about time and you've got to be here and you've got to go here and you've got to do this is because of sin sin and time entered in at the exact same time because God when Adam when God created Adam and Eve they were in eternity they didn't age they lived on and on and on and eternal Bliss as innocent as children but then there came a time because whenever Eve Adam and Eve fail death death entered in and then they begin to start to age then time set in because remember God told them the day you eat thereof that day you die so the moment that they begin to partake of the tree the mixed tree then time and sin entered into Humanity but it will be it entered in at the same time but it will also be annihilated because remember in eternity there's no time element how can we worship God for ten thousand years as though we've just begun because we're in eternity that's how the prophet could say I want a million years with each and every one of you we cannot comprehend that because we're in time but in eternity remember when he went over in the current beyond the curtain of time he said there was no yesterday and there's no tomorrow it's just the present you had nothing to worry about what's tomorrow going to bring you don't have the scars and the hurts of yesterday it's only him it's only in his presence it's only perfect love so eternity is represented by a circle and whenever you're you're married the circle the ring is a is a type of Eternity you stepped out of Eternity with your mate and you're going to step back into but right now we're in what's called what the prophet even referred to as like a blip it's a perfect circle but there's a little imperfection in that Circle that is time that is from the moment that Adam and Eve sinned to the very end of sin and time that's where Cain killed Abel that's where Noah built the art that's Abraham Isaac and Jacob that's all the prophets that's Jesus Christ coming all the way down so once time is no more God does away with that in eternity restart sets back in and we're back into the eternal but that little blip is where God wanted to show you how much he loves you that is that little blip is where God wanted to express himself to you as a savior but impatience is what got us in this whole mess of sin in time to begin with brother Ram said that God had he told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth he had a way of doing that but Eve couldn't wait on God's plan God was going to show Adam Adam was going to show Eve but Eve got in a hurry and she lusted for wisdom and she went around the headship of her husband and when she sinned that made that made the problem and that is her impatience is what brought the whole fall because Brotherhood said she couldn't wait we understand the serpency she couldn't wait so she went and she mingled with the serpent all because she wasn't patient do you see how important patience is to wait on the Lord Israel couldn't wait whenever they were delivered they were just dancing on the Red Sea having a wonderful time Moses goes up in the mountain for 40 days to get thus saith the Lord and Israel begins to get impatient what happened to Moses he's been up there and he he's supposed to be a Vindicated prophet he did things but where is he and they appear pressured Aaron to make them a golden calf and it caused death because of impatience Sarah couldn't wait on the Lord so an Ishmael was produced because of impatience Saul couldn't wait on the Lord so he lost his kingdom the church couldn't wait on the Lord and she denominated and lost her place just like vashti the people can't wait on the Lord so they'll replace the new birth with something else don't ever settle for anything other than the real born-again experience the reality of it we don't want to be fake we don't want to be put on we want reality now when God spoke creation into existence he wasn't confined to time he said let there be light and he could have turned his back he could he he knew light was coming he wasn't concerned he didn't get impatient and bothered that what if light doesn't come what will my angels think if I said let there be light and there's no light light came so God is Not impatient even with his own word let's look at some scriptures here some examples in the Bible rather Noah he had to exercise patience God told him it was going to rain he had to preach for a hundred and twenty years that's a long time preaching the same message get in the ark get in the ark well 120 years no okay Noah proof to God Lord I'm patient God shut Noah into the ark know what brother I'm dramatizing and said family when his family got in Noah said now tomorrow you're going to see when we wake up you're going to see dark clouds they've never seen that before you're going to hear Thunders you're going to see Lightnings it's going to be pouring Sheets of Rain but in the morning they woke up the sun comes up the birds are chirping the sun sets day two the sun comes up the birds chirp and the sun sets after he preached 120 years he did that for seven days he was in that art watching the Sun come up but after that that Eighth Day the Thunders shook the Earth the Lightnings flashed across the sky and people began to beg on to beg and bang on the ark for mercy but Noah had to have patience he was sweating it out whenever the floods were done he had to have patience for the water to go down that took days and days and days he had to have patience you can't talk about patience without talking about Abraham in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 12 let's read that that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises Hebrews 6 13. for when God made promise to Abraham he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise after he patiently endured for 25 years what if he had given Hope on 24. it didn't matter to Abraham because he had already met him he'd already met that Elohim and God would give him clues that is getting closer and closer when he had that name changed and met and meant that God in flesh and discerned Sarah's heart he knew he was right on it God confirmed to him that he was on target where did God come in our generation and do and confirm to his bride You're On Target all seven Church ages have been waiting for this body change but you are on target he would reveal himself through different Messengers as he came on down and came on down but he did something special for you little bride he let you know your change is about the time of life it's coming we're close get ready Abraham get ready Sarah all all them little baby clothes you bought you're about to need them all them prayers that you've prayed they're about to be fulfilled in the church age book brother says you see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which has given us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience what if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience because things whenever now there's power in prayer and you pray for things and then that gets things moving in the spirit but you don't see it and we'll get you a little later on but if you're not careful you'll get discouraged and you'll then begin to doubt because time and the things you see is your enemy but yet you don't see that God is working in the spirit when you've prayed for your healing when you've prayed for your loved one when you're trusting him for something things begin to move in the spirit he said he was patient in the word okay he said he'd never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life the way our Humanity works is if God did something for me in two weeks when I pray for something the next time I pray I'm going to want it in a week and a half and the next time I'm going to want it in a week because that's human nature now God is Sovereign and he can come down for you and give you a miracle and you sometimes you think of something it's not even a prayer you just almost think Lord I would sure love this or I would Lord could you do this or anything and it's like I didn't even pray for it and God did it he's Sovereign he gives you little treats like that to keep you encouraged he's a wonderful father so if he if if we weren't trying if he said why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience you'd become even more impatient with life he said let me show you this truth even more fully set forth Hebrews 11 17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises the word of God offered up his only begotten son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the Word of Promise so Abraham was patient for 25 years God gave him the promised son when the promised son turned 12 years old he said now I'm gonna try you again take him up there and sacrifice him most think as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good Promises of God that there could not be a trial but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct to the psalmist he said God gives a succeeding great and precious promises he's promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only impatience do we possess life that's your challenge right there that's my challenge let's talk about Joseph he was 17 years old he was loved by the father and he received a coat of many colors God gave him dreams remember gave him dreams that he and his brothers were actually out in the Harvest and they were getting all the sheeps together and their sheaves all of a sudden begin to bow down to him and then God gave him another promise that the son that the 11 stars in the Sun and Moon and they would all bow down to him now God gave him those dreams but when Jacob woke up when uh Joseph woke up and no doubt told his brothers the Bible says it made it when he got the jacket and so forth it made his brothers hate him that much more it didn't help his standing so Joseph no doubt could say how how are my brothers going to bow to me when they can't even stand me but he had to wait so from the time God promised him that there was a pit there was slavery marching in a caravan they didn't when they were selling people to slavery they didn't ride on the camel they walked through the desert walking through the desert all the way to Egypt then to be lied upon be framed thrown in prison all with the promise hanging over his head but he had to wait Lord you know okay so maybe once he got in Potiphar's house and was getting promoted he thought well maybe we'll see what happens I'm in a good spot then we know what happened with Potter for his wife and he went in jail went even further down and he was there waiting and waiting for 13 years of hardship and Injustice he had to wait on what God had showed him he couldn't get all tore up from the pit to slavery he had overcome Temptation prison he had overcome you think about this Joseph had to overcome the temptation of Revenge when he got in that position of power he was second to pharaoh and he could have gotten revenge on the Jailer he could have gotten revenge on potiphar he could have gotten revenge on Potter for his wife but he was a type of Christ he could of course got revenge on his brothers but what that what he went through gave Joseph the character that he needed to rule if he would have went from 17 and went straight from his father's house with a coat of many colors and marched right up into Egypt and became next to Pharaoh he wouldn't have been the same guy but whenever his brothers came up and he acted like he didn't know the language and all of a sudden once he revealed himself to his Brethren and his brothers knew what Joseph could have done unto them and they were all scared and what was it Joseph and the spirit of Christ said this was God's will perfect type of Christ we think of Saul whenever whenever Israel didn't want God anymore so they chose a king Saul by name amen preachers wrestled with coats saw by name now Saul as long as he listened to God he wasn't a bad fella he was a pretty good fella but what happened was he was in a battle one time and he was supposed to wait for Samuel to come and he got impatient and he actually made a sacrifice into the Lord he intruded into the priest's office when it was only for the priests in that single event caused God to turn his back on Saul and to take the kingdom away why all because Saul was not patient and didn't want to wait for Samuel so after a while God told Samuel quit mourning for Saul I've chosen myself a new king you go to the sons of Jesse first Samuel 16 1 and the Lord said unto Samuel how long without mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel failed thine horn with oil and go when I was sending to Jesse the best of the might for I have provided me a king among his sons and sit in verse 11 on down and Samuel said unto Jesse are all are here all thy children he said they remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse sin and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither and he sent him and he sent and brought him in now he was a ruddy and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren in the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so when others just see a Shepherd boy God sees a king Others May just see you in your own life in your own environment your neighbors but God looks at you different he looks at you and sees the Queen of Heaven so after David is anointed king get this now David is anointed king by the prophet of the age oil poured on him he's also not cared too much for by his brothers but after David is anointed king in the Bible says that the spirit of the Lord was upon him from that day forward what happens does David get paraded as a little boy God Save the King here's your king o Israel no he goes right back to tendon sheep he plays for Saul a little bit because the spirit of the Lord left Saul but then he goes right back to tending sheep why he needed more character why he needed more patience God's anointed king and he's smelling like the Sheep so while he's out there he begins to he's faced with a bear he's faced with a lion all with this anointing on him and David could fall back on his anointing and know that if he was anointed king nothing could touch him so the bear and the lion and everything that he faced was actually training for Goliath God knew he had a Goliath so he had to train him with a bear he had to train him with a lion it intensified and all of these trials gave David the character he needed and God knows what he's doing he sends David back to the Sheep he gets his character he's having to wait on the Lord and whenever David goes and kills Goliath what does that do it puts him right in the court of the king it puts him right in Saul's Court because David as a person can think how can I be king he God anointed him King he promised him he was going to be king but David waited on the Lord you see whenever he made it into the court of the king he didn't act like Absalom and began to rebel and build an army and take over Saul was trying to kill him because Saul could see the anointing on him so Saul was trying to constantly kill David and David would run here he was the Fugitive he'd run here he'd run there he'd run there so David got so close he could remember joab in different ones try to get him to kill Saul they actually snuck into his cave stepped over his bodyguards and cut a piece of Saul's robe off so that the next morning when they were across the hill he could say Saul God delivered you in my hand but I wouldn't touch you I could have killed you I could have gotten Revenge how many times have you tried to kill me how many things have you done to me he's taken my wife and given her to another David could have killed Saul but he waited on God to put him in that position even when God even when Saul ended up dying and Jonathan David he can read in the scripture was weeping he was tore up about it he was completely tore up about it he was patient allowed God to bring his word to pass he didn't get in there and say God you made me King so what do you want me to do he let God do it in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 he passed on this wisdom to his son Solomon says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven in verse 11 and he hath made everything beautiful in his time not when you think it should be or when I think it should be in his time he made he has made everything beautiful in his time also also he had set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end God is right on time when Mary and Martha thought Jesus was late he was right on time [Music] you may think it's too late you may think it's too late for God to heal you you may think it's too late for God to save so and so and you may think he's right on time even if things happen in life and you can't explain it and you feel like you were holding out to the end or that person was holding out to the end and it worked out this way don't lose faith God is in total control in Hebrews 12 1 wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses we just went through about several of them right there Cloud Witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which does such easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God we have to run it with patience there's going to be disappointments that's really no news flash to most of us any of us you get born again and the disappointments don't stop but you have a way to deal with the disappointments see that that's the difference the world is very disappointed every election somebody gets disappointed every day when they turn on the news somebody gets disappointed life is full of disappointments but what do you do with them disappointments Hebrews 10 36 for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise forget a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry but now the just shall live by faith and if any man draw back see James said the same thing a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways yeah I believe God yet God did this I don't know about today yep I believe God from one weekend to the next we don't draw back the Bible says my social had no pleasure in him but we are not of them that draw back into Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul now as James said the trying of your faith it works patience Jesus when he came the Bible says as the Common People heard him gladly he preached and teached very simple he could preach he preached the Seven Seals but in simplicity he would break things down in a parable of this a parable a king once went and did this a farmer went and did this he'd always speak in Parables and it was so simple that people couldn't understand it so we're all familiar with the parable of the sower in Luke 8 now the parable he talks about we're all very familiar with the parable but you know some fell by the wayside and some fell on Stony ground and and some fell on the weeds and things choked it up so Jesus begins to actually break down the interpretation of it to his disciples now the parable is this the seed is the word of God don't ever forget that the word of God is a seed those that those by the wayside are they that here then cometh the devil and take away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root for a while believe and in time of Temptation Fall Away and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection that's laodicea that's the one we've got to be real careful about because we have the truth we receive the truth we Rejoice over the truth but then we go out of these doors and live in a very soft age that's the one we have to watch for this age but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience you don't plant brother Jerry you don't get a seed a fruit seed and you plant it and tomorrow we're expecting fruit if you do you're going to be in for a big wake-up call now before you even plant the seeds you've got to prepare the ground if you plant a garden or you're a farmer you you don't just get seeds and say I'm gonna plant corn I'm going to plant tomatoes or whatever and you go to a patch of grass in your yard brother Matt and you just throw the seed all right I can't wait to eat fresh tomatoes you're not going to have any tomatoes you've got to break that ground up you got to work for it you got to till the ground you got to cultivate it and prepare for the seed which remember is the word to be planted so what am I saying if we come into church services with a hard Spirit maybe a critical spirit maybe the hurts of the week or whatever it may be the cares of the world whatever happened on the job that we if we come and we're not careful to see that's preached will not find good ground because it's hard maybe it's crusty or maybe it's hurt unforgiving whatever it is maybe there's grass and weeds there you need it whenever you know we Rejoice over what God does in our services we're so blessed here and God pours out a spirit on the bride all across the world and by God's grace while the world is falling apart we're having phenomenal the bride is having phenomenal worship and phenomenal uh presence and phenomenal revelations in these things that's God's goodness but see we we will have a wonderful weekend and on Monday and Tuesday we'll begin we we Rejoice over what happened and we think about what was preached and we thank the Lord for the deliverance and different things but as the week progresses we should then begin not forget what God done but then begin to turn our hearts and begin to cultivate okay thank you Lord for last weekend but now we're approaching another weekend Lord what do you have for me this weekend start praying for the ministry whoever is preaching what are you doing you're cultivating you're breaking the ground and then when you come in here worship will be easy praise will be easy receiving the word believing will be easy and then it just Falls right into the prepared ground we have to get ready for the word he said now when a man plants a seed if you're a farmer you know anything about planting any seed if you plant a seed today some corn you put it in your garden tomorrow morning you go out and you dig it up and look at it say well there's no difference in it you plant it back and the next day you go back look at it say there's no difference in it it'll never come up it can't do it when you dug it up you spoil the picture right there you start the cycle all over again as soon as you receive something from the Lord you plant it you cover it up begin to nurture the seed and not constantly dig it up not constantly look at it he said and every time you look at your symptoms testify about them complain about them God can never heal you you commit it to God you believe his word he'll bring it to pass so when you plant a garden do you sit there at night so stressed that your corn won't come up when he bought organic non-GMO Original Seed do you stress that your garden won't come up you plant it you cover it you may stress about the deer that will eventually get in there but for now you plant the seed you cover it up you commit It to the Ground and you know it'll come up you don't stress about if it will come up neither do you stress that I planted Tomatoes but I sure hope I don't get cucumbers why because you know what you planted so when you accept whenever you accept the the word of God you're not gonna you're not gonna get weeds because remember he said whenever whether it's sprouting whether it's whatever it's doing you don't care God promised it and potentially you have your healing when you accept it it's in seed form so remember brother I'm dealing with the Lutheran Dean he planted the corn he said do you have a crop of corn he said potentially but the potential is in the seed itself so the potential means the existing impossibility capable of development into actuality it's like you will as long as you take care of it and you nurture the sea that you plant you are guaranteed a crop so once we once the word or the seed is planted we must with patience wait for it to bring the fruit if we plant our garden we walk away well God's going to bring the seat to pass and never nurture it you're is very doubtful you're going to have a garden because it gets choked up with weeds if it doesn't rain it's dry and the seed will dry up you say what are you trying to say well if we receive the word in this service we Rejoice over and then you walk out of them doors and we don't nurture it with faith Thanksgiving and praise weeds will pop up it'll get dry your ground will start getting broken up and it won't bring nothing up when you receive the word and you receive the promise you've got the potential of it when you believe that God's God's word and and when you lay your hands on the sick they shall receive they shall recover you believe it that's your potential that's your seed now plant it in your heart believe it and water it and it's thus saith the Lord it will produce there's nothing wrong with the seed itself but it's got to be it's got to be guarded you got to go make sure no weeds are coming up as as it begins to grow up in in your starting you're starting to see an answer to prayer a development you got to make sure you keep the weeds away we have to be real watchful brother Ram talked about a man named John Ryan and we're all very familiar with his story but he was a blind man that the prophet prayed for and he comes through the prayer line and brother Adam says I prayed for him and I laid my hands on him I said Lord Jesus I rebuke this blindness now in the name of Jesus Christ leave it him and I turned around and looked and I seen him going walking away with his sight I said thus saith the Lord you watch for that thus saith the Lord you've received your sight well he said I can't see I said that has nothing to do with it go on your road rejoicing so he went down now listen to this there's a woman in a few minutes who had a great goiter hanging on her throat and while she was praying and while we was praying for her it went away so here you had John Ryan coming to prayer line the prophet said thus saith the Lord you can receive your sight and when he open or whenever he's done praying John Ryan said I can't see so brother M encourages him to believe he goes off the platform and then he prays for another woman who has a big goiter and that instantly falls off remember God in his sovereignty so then John Ryan circles back around gets through all the ushers and he comes and he says I thought he said here come John Ryan back pushing through all the ushers and he said to me he said you told me I was healed so you see John Ryan was comparing his promise to a miracle that happened we can't do that God is Sovereign in his action and his power and in his plan so we can't get discouraged that somebody gets a miracle instantly but yet I've been trusting God for years and I still don't have it God has a reason said he said you told me I was healed I said you are he said well you said I was healed I said you said you believed me he said I said well the only thing to do is go on your road just praising God forgiving your eyesight so for days for a long time weeks I believe he was blind but he still would rise up say thank you Lord for healing me thank you Lord for healing me so he goes and you know the story and he he sits in a barber's chair there and the barber is trying to make fun of him while he get him to shape he said say I heard you went to that Holy Roller meeting got healed he said I did thank you Lord for healing me praise the Lord for healing me and his eyes come open why because he received that once he understood he received the seed went off the platform went to his daily job selling newspapers whatever he did he was still blind as could be but yet his testimony was watering and nurturing the sea that he received and in an instant he got his sight in an instant Romans 5 3 not only so but we also glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation work of patience and patience experience and experience hope the prophet said patience with what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with God if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience see whenever faith is a revelation and when you had the faith that you really believe God it doesn't matter how long it takes is challenging to the flesh it's challenging when you look down and you see your symptoms it's challenging when you look around but see we look at the Unseen he said when God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience think of this God had patience with you he had patience with me he'd try and reach you in this service you run he's trying to reach you in that service you run he pull on your heart here and you run for years Iran and he's patient he's patient he's patient but then we come in the house of God God save us bless the Lord he filled me with the Holy Ghost I'm born again and then whenever God don't answer our prayer as soon as we think he should we can get discouraged see discouragement breaks down faith brother man preached a sermon called the court trial you should listen to it he preached it five times and he sets up a court trial and he puts the word he dramatizes it beautifully and he puts that Satan as the prosecuting attorney is bringing the word of God and he's putting the word on trial because God don't keep his word and he really sets it up just right and Satan is accusing God and Satan whenever there's a prosecutor they always have witnesses so Satan has his Witnesses so in the court in the in the sermon their brother said the case is the word of God it's promised versus the word world and the cost for the indictment is a breach of Promise God made a promise and didn't stick to it God's word made a promise so he he's being brought in for a court case breach of promise now the prosecuting attorney always represents the state and the prosecuting attorney is Satan the defendant in this case is almighty God and the prosecuting attorney also has some witnesses on the case I'm going to name them one of them is Mr unbeliever the next one is Mr skeptic and the third one you guessed it is Mr and patient called him a rascal because see they claim to be believers Mr impatient claims to be Believers you know he got up and he testified this is where this is where the preacher preached this is where I read in the Bible this is where I took the promise but I waited for this many years and it didn't happen therefore it's not true they all claim to be Believers and brothers gets that courtroom and he sets it up and he says now you are both the judge and the jury this afternoon when the word Goes Forth and he says you in your mind is the jury because as the words being preached is coming first and getting right here and you make a decision if you're going to accept it or refuse it that's your jury when a case is being given the defendant the plaintiffs the prosecutors and things they don't sit there and talk to all the audience that's in there the judge oversees the thing but who do they go to and try and get in their ear and really prove something the jury because it's the jury that actually decide no matter how much the judge may think he's guilty if the jury acquits him he's free so the word as it comes forth it comes in our minds first and that's our jury I believe it and then the judge whenever the jury and I'm not a lawyer by any means but from my understanding whenever the jury actually gives the verdict they a lot they sometimes make like a recommendation and then the judge actually sentences according to the law so the jury is the mind the word is being preached and you decide is it true or is it not and then the judge is how we Act because your actions speak louder than your words so if we believe the word if we receive the promise and we say Lord I believe but then we act like we don't believe do we really believe but whenever we receive the word and we water it and we go out and we thank you Lord for healing me thank you Lord ahead of time before you see it anyone can praise the Lord after it happens but what about right that in between what about when you pray for your prodigal and you cry for your prodigal but you don't see an improvement you don't see an improvement what about when you ask and begot to heal you and he continued being sick what about when you've prayed and you've prayed and you prayed but he seems silent but I've got good news for you he never stops working remember time and what you see are your biggest enemies but it's what you do in the waiting that defines you what you do whenever after you receive the word but before it's manifested between that time which can be a long time or it can be a short time whatever God's sovereignty plays out how we act and how we take God at his word is what defines us because whenever you receive the word and we go out these doors and we rejoice and then Monday morning hits us Mr skeptic is going to come visit you he's gonna come knocking Mr impatience can come knock on with probably two Fists but don't open that door how are they going to come knocking in here it's been three weeks since God made me that promise and I still don't see it don't open that door but you know as brother Brandon whenever he preached a court trial he went through witness after witness have to witness and I love it at the end he said the last defense witness I like to call he said is me and he began to break down how God commissioned him how he met an angel how the pillar of fire came down the Ohio River how could how in the world humanly speaking could a man a simple man with that kind of background ever go seven times around the world pray for Kings do all the things that he did how in the world but he had to be patient and God brought it to pass so his brother brand put himself on the defense Witness to defend the word so may I and we can all no doubt stand up and testify and defend the word when Wesley couldn't even walk of course not only could he not walk but he wouldn't even show any desire to even stand none Enoch is only nine months old and he's already he's trying to get around Wesley was I passed his first birthday show no sign and we take of the chiropractor just kept praying and you know it works on Mothers especially they're the ones that are going to notice so you know and brother Ron has testified this a lot but the Lord showed brother Ron a vision that he would walk and of course we'll never forget forget that service especially you know in our in my family and things but the Lord showed my vision but we after that Vision or after that service rather we had a choice to make would we hold on to it and live in expectation and thank the Lord for it or when we took him home and tried to stand him up and he just clapsed down said well I guess no we had to hold on to it and it was a process of time and you know and then we begin to record it we would notice that first time when we put them in in this little deal that helps them walk he began to show just the first the first desire to do something so we've seen that and that was God giving us a little encouragement but it wasn't just as spontaneous God could have done it God could have had him jump out of my arms and run down right then but he chose to do it another way so what was it it was like a blooming flower it was a process because remember nature still acts the same way so as a blooming flower you know it began to just his development literally open before our very eyes now he runs and jumps and does everything because why God is faithful to his word God will bring it to pass as I was studying for this I was even you know thought of our dear Pastor brother Ron you think of what you know he's going through and we as a church that love him so much and people all over the world it brings us along on the journey too because we're burden for him in the initial report you know he brought initial fear and uncertainties and anxieties and things and you know as soon as it was announced my faith was Lord when he goes to the doctor and gets the scans may it show no cancer may do it may you just dissolve it that was my faith and that should that should be all of our faith and I believe it was but he went to the doctor and they actually found out it was cancer so do we just say oh well God don't work miracles no more no we can't believe him with every doctor appointment we're expecting the miraculous but if it doesn't happen then we're going to keep believing we're going to keep believing we're going to keep believing regardless of what the doctor reports hold keeps saying we hold on to his report and here we are three years later waiting on the Lord we know he's healed we believe he's healed but we're waiting on God you think of what kind of rugged Christian it takes where you're you're standing and you fill the Lord himself you feel the angel of the Lord you feel God himself and he comes you think God forgets of what you're going through you think God forgets when he comes and does something so special for somebody and he's standing here and he touches somebody's life and they're never the same do you think that the angel of the Lord forgets that the man praying for them has got cancer no God doesn't forget God knows but God has a plan because he's doing something and that that no I know that pleases the Lord that despite this despite what you're going through despite what he's going through he still ministers when he don't feel like it he's still you asking for prayer he still takes his your burden on him and prays for you we're waiting on the Lord we know it's done Lord We Believe the prophet of God was so sick he said my stomach gets sour and oh my brother Jack's help me around the house I walk around the house and just a hot greasy water like flying out of my mouth and walked to the pulpit and pray for people that was twice that bad and healed I've had him lay my hands on a man with a cancer on his face and the cancer left his face and standing there and I was so sick I couldn't hardly stand up did God forget that his Prophet was there and he was just so sick did God not care no but God has a had a plan for him and he had a plan for that person Indescribable Miracles taking place in the prophet's meetings and he was so sick standing there ministering God wants us to have patience we have to have patience for the coming of the Lord we get sick of this world we get so sick of this world we want to go home but we've got to have patience we're waiting on that last one God's not going to be a minute late God is like I said was patient waiting on us in second Thessalonians 3 5 and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ you know whenever we get we're saved we're ready to go but what about the ones that aren't we have to be patient people the church all the church Ages were expecting him to come but they had to be patient in James 5 7 be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh you know all of creation is even waiting on us all of creation is waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God they're waiting on us to receive our change because they're because whenever Humanity fell they fell too they're waiting for our adoption our full adoption the change of our body in Mark 11 as we begin to close in Mark 11 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith plow the Earth let's plow our hearts let's water it with praise and then wait for it to come in Psalm 27 14 wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord musicians can come on up be of good courage David said wait on the Lord be of good courage and he'll strengthen your heart as I said even in the early part of the service as a young person if you're trusting the Lord for a spouse let him wait on the Lord wait on the Lord because you know what there's nothing worse than the wrong one but there's nothing better than the right one nothing's better than the right one Psalm 135 I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning maybe you've been trusting God for a promise a long time and you've allowed the sea to settle in good ground you've watered it with praise and and you've been waiting you've been trusting the Lord you've been crying out crying out crying out but as you're crying and as Life Goes On remember Satan likes to sow the prophet called it seeds of discrepancy so what he'll do is you till up the ground you till up your heart and you say Lord I need this from you or you promised me this you promised me this and you've been trusting and you've been you've been trusted for a long time and Satan has been germinating when he adds your guard down maybe in in moments of weakness of our Humanity Satan will begin to germinate seeds of doubt a frustration and impatience he likes to do that you keep your ground you keep your heart pure you love the Lord your Holy Ghost filled you're born again and you're trusting him and you've been waiting and you've been waiting and you've watched this one get blessed and you've rejoiced you've watched that one get blessed and you've rejoiced but yet in your own Humanity Satan can come and he'll just go by real quick in a weak moment and he'll throw some seeds in there and you may get a little frustrated because you've been asking God for a long time for something but yet or because the the things that we see and as time goes on we we get impatient and and then like I said them weeds of frustration begin to build they begin to sprout up may the Lord help us to take inventory because as we all raise our hands we all have needs we all have desires and we have to make sure that we keep may we by faith may we ask the Lord the Holy Ghost to come by and to get them weeds and and a circumstance and pull them out the impatience that we've had because when the weeds begin to crowd the weeds as they grow you're for the frustration will only get worse the impatience will only get worse and then the weeds will then try and choke out the promise you're hoping for the promise you're praying for the weeds will then begin like a vine to to wrap around it and try and choke out the promise choke out the faith that you do have we have to pull the weeds so the light of the s-o-n can get to the seed because if we have the seed in our hearts and then we and we've gotten it already but then the weeds always grow faster than the seed remember that we've all experienced it the weed always grows faster than the real thing so it's the impatience and the frustration will grow a lot quicker we've got to keep that pulled out we've got to water it with praise let's stand to our feet as we read is Ayah Isaiah chapter 30. and therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the Lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him for the Lord shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem Thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry take this personal tonight when he shall hear it he will answer thee the answer is on the way even though you can't see it even though you've waited for a long time the answer is on the way God knows every tear you've cried about it he knows every bit of frustration because you know he subjected himself to time he hasn't forgotten you he hasn't forgotten you for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tear it this I recall to my mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him [Music] the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord the seed has been sown open up your heart and receive the word and make a declaration in your own heart [Music] make a promise to yourself and to the Lord in his presence that no matter how long it takes I'm gonna believe though when I go and I don't see it and on Monday morning when I go and after I had a wonderful time in your presence take this presence with you and when you are and when you go during your work weekend you don't see a change in your healing you don't see a change in your loved one you don't see a change in the things that you want to be changed believe anyway because God is still working God is Not subjected to our senses faith will get him to move faith will bring him on the scene so let's take these moments in his presence let's search our hearts if there's any any weeds as I said that's trying to come up and choke the things we're praising the Lord for we're trusting him for may we take it out Lord we give ourselves to you Lord we thank you for your word we thank you Lord that your word is the truth and father we want to tell you from the bottom of our hearts we believe you and Lord we by faith want to present the things that we carry on our hearts we want to lift them up to you Lord all the healings Lord for our loved ones Lord and our our pastor Lord and all these requests Lord that was read here tonight the salvation of Our prodigals Lord the things that we're expecting in our own family Lord we want to lift them up to you father Lord and tell you that we believe we want to tell you Lord that we the jury believe father we don't believe the prosecutor the enemy Satan we believe that the defense witness of the Holy Ghost because Lord you have a proven track record you are undefeated and Lord what will [Music] the answer of that prayer answered what will that mean in eternity it will mean nothing the benefits of it and the patience and the character that it gave us will mean everything when we're there with our loved ones when we're there with our children because we refuse to give up Lord we want to take these moments to even thank you ahead of time Lord for the things that's in our hearts Lord for the reasons that we uplifted our hands Lord we want to thank you ahead of time and we want to worship you and thank you Lord that it's on its way We Believe father Lord we just pray that you give us more patience to wait to wait on the Lord We believe We love you with all of our hearts give you all the praise honor and Glory in Jesus Christ's
