[51:26] every thought captive to the mind of
[51:29] Christ that we would have your word in
[51:31] our mind and we would not have our mind
[51:34] but we would simply just put oursel into
[51:36] the word to be in line with the veil
[51:39] that you chosen in this hour so God we
[51:42] commit this service to you in the name
[51:44] of Jesus Christ amen First Kings chapter
[51:48] 19 and verse
[51:49] 9 and he came thither unto a cave and
[51:53] lodged there and behold the word of the
[51:55] Lord came to him and he said unto him
[51:58] what doest thou here Elijah and if you
[52:01] haven't listened to it for a little bit
[52:03] I admonish you to go and listen to the
[52:05] prophet speak on what doest thou hear
[52:08] Elijah and what hearest thou Elijah and
[52:11] he said I have been very jealous for the
[52:13] Lord God of host for the god or or for
[52:16] the children of Israel have forsaken thy
[52:18] Covenant and thrown down thine altars
[52:21] and slain thy prophets and with the
[52:24] sword and I even I I only am left and
[52:28] they seek my life to take it away and he
[52:31] said go forth and stand upon the mount
[52:33] before the Lord and he
[52:35] said and behold the Lord passed by and a
[52:37] great and strong wind rent the mountains
[52:40] and break in pieces and rocks before the
[52:43] Lord but the Lord was not in the wind
[52:46] and after the wind an earthquake but the
[52:49] Lord was not in the earthquake and after
[52:52] the earthquake of fire but the Lord was
[52:54] not in the fire and after after the fire
[52:57] a still small voice and it was so that
[53:00] when Elijah heard it I think it's
[53:03] amazing when you capture the attention
[53:05] of God's believing children that the
[53:08] effects of his coming did not it didn't
[53:10] capture his attention but what attracted
[53:12] him was the word the voice that captured
[53:17] the prophet's attention that when he
[53:19] Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in
[53:21] his mantle and went out and stood in the
[53:23] entering in of the cave and behold there
[53:25] came a voice unto him and said what
[53:28] doest thou he Elijah also 2 Corinthians
[53:32] chapter 3 in verse one I believe today's
[53:36] your birthday happy birthday brother
[53:38] Dylan God bless
[53:43] you sometimes I get privy to knowledge
[53:47] then it just hits me all of a sudden so
[53:48] God bless
[53:52] you sometimes it looks like a squirrel
[53:55] on a on a hamster wheel up here in my
[53:56] brain so you don't want to go there
[53:59] sometimes
[54:01] so amen you love the Lord amen amen 2
[54:07] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse one do
[54:08] we begin to commend ourselves or need we
[54:12] as some others Epistles of commendation
[54:15] to you or letters of commendation from
[54:16] you you are our Epistles written in our
[54:20] hearts known and read of all men for as
[54:23] much as you are manifestly declared to
[54:26] be the Epistles of Christ ministered by
[54:28] US Written not with ink but with the
[54:31] spirit of the Living God and I want you
[54:33] to Major there on that thought that that
[54:35] that verse right there manifestly
[54:37] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[54:39] written of Christ ministered by US
[54:41] Written not with ink but the spirit of
[54:43] the Living God not in tables of stone
[54:46] but in the fleshly tables of the heart
[54:48] and such trust have we through Christ to
[54:51] godward not that we are sufficient of
[54:53] ourselves to think anything as of
[54:56] ourselves but our sufficiency is of god
[55:00] may God bless his word you may be seated
[55:02] here in the presence of the Lord as we
[55:04] said we'd like to speak to you on the
[55:07] veiled Glory again we just just want to
[55:10] labor here on these thoughts drawing
[55:13] some things from the prophet's message a
[55:15] and here in the unveiling of God brother
[55:17] Brandon would say it like this he said
[55:19] you become a part of Christ as long as
[55:22] Christ is hid in you he said it's veiled
[55:25] to the unbeliever but you know he is in
[55:28] you ain't that powerful it is veiled to
[55:31] the unbeliever but you know he is in you
[55:34] you are templ Christ that's behind the
[55:37] veil the skin then be be because behind
[55:40] because of this Veil The Veil again in
[55:43] human flesh hides God the word from the
[55:46] unbeliever as it is written written you
[55:49] are written Epistles the Bible said that
[55:52] what is an epistle it is a written word
[55:54] and you are the written other words you
[55:56] read it like this you it said you are
[55:59] written Epistles or you are the word
[56:02] that has been written made manifest that
[56:05] nothing can be added to it you can't say
[56:07] I'm a written epistle and living some
[56:09] other kind of a something but what this
[56:12] has already wrote because nothing can be
[56:15] added to it or nothing can be taken away
[56:18] and to recognize that we are a
[56:20] predestinated people that are here to
[56:23] fulfill the promise of the hour that to
[56:26] to to literally be the physical
[56:28] manifestation of the Holy written word
[56:30] that you are the written Epistles you
[56:33] are here to manifest what God has in his
[56:36] mind what he has deposited for this
[56:38] generation that we're in God has got a
[56:41] people that are going to manifest his
[56:44] glory and we recognize in every every
[56:47] single age that God has hid himself in
[56:49] some form or another that God has veiled
[56:52] himself veiled behind a form of humanity
[56:55] or in the way of the spiritual that we
[56:58] read throughout the Bible and I won't go
[57:00] through all of them but God veiled
[57:02] himself in many forms in the form of the
[57:04] pillar of fire he veiled himself he
[57:06] veiled himself in the cloud uh uh by day
[57:09] he veiled himself in the Whirlwind when
[57:11] he was speaking to job he he veiled
[57:13] himself in a wheel in the middle of a
[57:15] wheel when he was speaking to Ezekiel he
[57:17] was he veiled himself in a voice when
[57:20] Elijah was there in a cave he veiled
[57:23] himself behind the Badgers of skin when
[57:25] he was dwelling in the Tabernacle of the
[57:27] Wilderness and he veils himself in the
[57:30] form of His prophets and we recognize
[57:33] that by the Bible and being Bible
[57:35] Believers that God has always used that
[57:38] form to Veil himself behind that when we
[57:41] did not see God In the Flesh or when we
[57:43] did not see God in the spiritual by the
[57:45] pillar of fire or by the cloud or by a
[57:48] whirlwind we could see him in the
[57:50] prophetic word for the dispensation that
[57:53] we are in or that the people of God were
[57:55] in now in the in the message the trial
[57:58] and I'm just going to lay some things
[57:59] before we get into into the meat of the
[58:02] subject here today in the trial the
[58:04] prophet said he said in the Sodom age
[58:06] what happened to Abraham he said he
[58:08] would return back again to Abraham's
[58:11] Royal seat which is in Christ Christ
[58:13] returning in the form of the word notice
[58:17] Christ returning in the form of the word
[58:19] working in human beings and showing the
[58:21] signs that he promised that it would
[58:24] sign it would do he promis promised that
[58:26] he would do it God promised it and God
[58:29] will keep his promise do you believe
[58:32] that today that God will keep his
[58:34] promise and we recognize that when when
[58:37] Moses was there and he was up there on
[58:38] the mountain that that there that we
[58:41] recognize that God was speaking directly
[58:43] to Moses he was giving him the
[58:45] understanding to be back be able to go
[58:47] back and to preach or to deliver the
[58:50] message that God had spoke directly unto
[58:53] him and it was the pillar of fire that
[58:55] was there that was that was identified
[58:57] with Moses and that pillar fire was not
[58:59] was not ashamed to be identified with
[59:01] Moses but the pillar of fire was
[59:03] literally writing out the word of God
[59:05] and William brandham said it in on the
[59:07] unveiling of God he said it is that same
[59:10] pillar fire that is interpreting the
[59:13] word in this hour it's that same pillar
[59:16] fire that is interpreting that word so
[59:18] let me just let me just bring you to
[59:20] where we are that you are the
[59:23] interpretation of the word of this hour
[59:26] that no matter how much Satan wants to
[59:28] fight against you that that you are
[59:31] identified in the word of God for this
[59:33] age and for this hour where the sh of
[59:35] Glory has come down and Revelation lays
[59:38] right there you are under that same
[59:40] pillar ofier you are here and you are
[59:43] the interpretation of what the word has
[59:46] been spoken just like it was identifying
[59:48] the message up there on Mount SII that
[59:51] same Pillar of Fire is here and
[59:53] identifying that the message is still
[59:55] the the same and that God is still the
[59:58] same and his power is still the same and
[1:00:00] he's not changing so if there is a God
[1:00:03] in this generation then there's got to
[1:00:05] be somebody that will be a written
[1:00:07] epistle that is going to be a
[1:00:09] manifestation of what God has seen so
[1:00:12] the bride is the word
[1:00:15] interpreted so the bride is the veil
[1:00:18] that God is going to work behind he is
[1:00:21] working behind your flesh
[1:00:28] Hallelujah in the identified Christ of
[1:00:30] all ages the prophet said now notice now
[1:00:33] God Jesus said that those who the word
[1:00:36] came to was called Gods he said that was
[1:00:38] they that was prophets now not the man
[1:00:41] himself was God no more than the body of
[1:00:43] Jesus Christ was God he was a man and
[1:00:46] God was veiled behind him and he said
[1:00:48] God has always veiled himself from the
[1:00:51] public and revealed himself to the
[1:00:53] people who will believe it it's amazing
[1:00:57] when you try to witness the power of
[1:00:58] Jesus Christ and you are the literally
[1:01:01] you are the physical manifestation of
[1:01:04] the word but they can't see it but you
[1:01:06] are where God is dwelling at he is he's
[1:01:09] revealing himself to the people who will
[1:01:11] believe it he said he said there in last
[1:01:13] Sunday he said I preached on the
[1:01:14] unveiling of God he said God has always
[1:01:17] veiled himself behind something so that
[1:01:19] the people of the outside world would
[1:01:21] know nothing about him but he reveals
[1:01:24] himself to his children and to those who
[1:01:27] are willing to come in behind that Veil
[1:01:30] again he would say he said now what is
[1:01:32] it he said when a man breaks through
[1:01:34] that Veil into the sh Glory now the
[1:01:36] world calls him a fanatic they can't see
[1:01:39] what's wrong but behind there but behind
[1:01:43] there there is no beauty of him you see
[1:01:45] when you begin to break into that realm
[1:01:48] to begin to recognize that this is the
[1:01:50] veil that God is wanting to live in and
[1:01:52] dwell in that he's not just wanting to
[1:01:55] live in in tables of stone and he's not
[1:01:57] just wanting to live behind the
[1:01:59] Whirlwind he's not just wanting to live
[1:02:01] behind the wheel of the middle of wheel
[1:02:03] he doesn't want to be a rock that was
[1:02:04] heed but he wants to Veil himself in the
[1:02:08] Tabernacle of humanity that has chosen
[1:02:11] in this hour that God has exposed
[1:02:13] himself to you God has revealed himself
[1:02:17] to
[1:02:18] you ah blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:21] now if you could just throw that that
[1:02:23] that picture of that quotation this is a
[1:02:26] quote as we mentioned to you last
[1:02:28] weekend from a collection of brother
[1:02:30] brandom's handwritten notes and sermon
[1:02:32] notes which was on the which is on
[1:02:34] display there in in brandham t or
[1:02:36] Memorial Library there in Tucson Arizona
[1:02:40] and he titled this set of notes he
[1:02:42] titled it the glory of the Lord he he
[1:02:45] titled it the glory of the Lord he said
[1:02:47] now notice he's he's drawing this from
[1:02:49] First Kings chapter 19 he said notice
[1:02:51] him Elijah in the cave he said the one
[1:02:55] that storm
[1:02:56] the P Billy Graham the Earth shaking
[1:02:59] campaigns or Roberts the Pentecostal
[1:03:01] rushing wind never moved the prophets he
[1:03:05] said never moved the prophet he said
[1:03:06] they were only effects of his passing by
[1:03:10] he said but what attracted the Prophet
[1:03:11] Elijah it was the glory of his voice the
[1:03:15] word revealing his glory plans the
[1:03:18] prophet waited on his office he said
[1:03:20] notice as a type that not long then to
[1:03:23] the Rapture he was only near in the Wind
[1:03:25] earthquake fire Etc he said the man of
[1:03:28] God waited notice he waited for the
[1:03:31] manifested reality Vindicated word
[1:03:34] abiding Glory not long then to the
[1:03:37] Rapture and you look at this world that
[1:03:40] we are living in right now you you look
[1:03:42] at the storms that we just came through
[1:03:44] you look at the earthquakes that are
[1:03:45] taking place in California this Earth is
[1:03:48] groaning this Earth is calling for the
[1:03:50] manifestation of the sons of God to
[1:03:53] recognize that the prophet was are
[1:03:56] waiting on the manifested reality so
[1:03:58] don't get your eyes on the earthquakes
[1:04:00] don't get your eyes on the winds don't
[1:04:02] get your eyes on the Storm wait on the
[1:04:05] manifested reality I am not shook up
[1:04:08] about the LGBT qz I'm not shook up about
[1:04:11] what Biden's doing and what what what
[1:04:13] Harris is doing and what Trump is doing
[1:04:16] I am concerned with one thing and one
[1:04:19] thing only what the manifested reality
[1:04:22] of what God has dispersed in this
[1:04:24] generation
[1:04:26] this is where God is
[1:04:28] at come on somebody don't get your eyes
[1:04:31] on the earthquakes because there's a lot
[1:04:33] of times when the spirit of God will
[1:04:35] come through here and there's an
[1:04:37] earthquak and shaking kind of time and
[1:04:40] those times those emotional times will
[1:04:42] leave
[1:04:44] you come on I'm going to preach to you
[1:04:46] this morning so your amen are well
[1:04:48] qualified to get in line with the
[1:04:50] message there are going to be times when
[1:04:52] you feel the emotions of the spirit of
[1:04:54] God and there's going to be times when
[1:04:56] you don't see the wind but he's still
[1:04:58] there there are going to be times when
[1:05:01] you feel the influence of it but what I
[1:05:04] want you to catch is the voice the
[1:05:08] manifestation of what was in the
[1:05:10] earthquake and what was in the Earth or
[1:05:13] in the
[1:05:14] Fire come on somebody because you are
[1:05:17] going to come here at some point in your
[1:05:19] life and your emotions are not going to
[1:05:22] run the same way that they did last
[1:05:23] weekend your emotions are not going to
[1:05:26] go off the extreme and push you into
[1:05:29] past your own Veil sometimes but just
[1:05:32] because you don't have a shouting
[1:05:34] meeting and just because you don't have
[1:05:37] one of those events where the spirit of
[1:05:39] God manifest himself does not change the
[1:05:44] glory that's behind the
[1:05:49] voice
[1:05:51] Allelujah what did this what did this
[1:05:54] voice cause
[1:05:57] here here is here's Elijah I want you
[1:06:01] to and brother Ron just did a a powerful
[1:06:04] job last weekend under the juniper tree
[1:06:07] but find it amazing that he just led us
[1:06:10] this way but you look at what that voice
[1:06:15] calls because if it doesn't create a
[1:06:17] reaction on the inside of you then the
[1:06:20] voice was
[1:06:21] meaningless but if the voice it causes a
[1:06:25] reaction on the inside of his believing
[1:06:27] children then there's got to be a
[1:06:29] Powerhouse behind that voice you you see
[1:06:32] what what happened up there with Hatty R
[1:06:34] there was power behind that voice what
[1:06:37] happened up there in Cor in Colorado
[1:06:38] Mountain there was power behind that
[1:06:40] voice what happened here what's happened
[1:06:43] in your life what's happened in your
[1:06:45] testimony there's a power that's behind
[1:06:48] the voice though you don't see the voice
[1:06:52] the power is still there
[1:06:55] amen thank you Lord it set Elijah on a
[1:06:59] course because just to just to bring to
[1:07:02] your reference to your mind you you look
[1:07:06] over in First Kings chapter 18 and it's
[1:07:08] a showdown between Jehovah and baale and
[1:07:11] here Elijah makes fun of them because ba
[1:07:15] ain't showing up but when Elijah begins
[1:07:18] to restore the ministry back to his
[1:07:20] right position he he restores true
[1:07:22] worship back and he cast down the idols
[1:07:25] of B and he stands there and he he gets
[1:07:27] everything back in order he's got blood
[1:07:29] back on the sacrifice he gets he gets 12
[1:07:32] barrels of rain that when the we that
[1:07:35] you look at that right there it's
[1:07:36] supernatural he's got 12 barrels of
[1:07:38] water that he's living in an age wor
[1:07:41] three and a half years there ain't been
[1:07:44] no rain but he's standing right here and
[1:07:47] a supernatural Prophet produces
[1:07:49] Supernatural water it said pour it all
[1:07:52] over this sacrifice and if God be God
[1:07:55] let him show up and burn up this
[1:07:57] sacrifice you can pour water all you
[1:08:00] want to on this message and it'll still
[1:08:03] produce that God is the god of
[1:08:07] Elijah I'll tell you what this message
[1:08:09] will produce if you try to water it down
[1:08:11] with some kind of gospel or some kind of
[1:08:13] creed or some kind of idea Elijah's
[1:08:16] ministry will restore it back to its
[1:08:19] right place and the prophet will call
[1:08:22] down fire from heaven
[1:08:26] Hallelujah here he goes he immediately
[1:08:29] goes from there and there he is he's on
[1:08:31] a high point and he's got himself in
[1:08:33] such a weakened condition that he that
[1:08:36] he sends his his his helper Gesa he
[1:08:39] sends him up there he don't even have
[1:08:41] enough strength Elijah had got himself
[1:08:44] so wore out in his ministry that he did
[1:08:47] not even have the ability to climb upon
[1:08:49] the mountain and see and see if it was
[1:08:52] going to rain but he's already told King
[1:08:55] Ahab get ready get your rain barrels
[1:08:58] ready it's about to rain I hear the
[1:09:00] abundance of the sound of rain are
[1:09:02] coming and immediately he goes and he
[1:09:06] lays himself down on the mountain sends
[1:09:08] gazes up there said do you see anything
[1:09:10] yet he said there ain't a sign of it
[1:09:12] nowhere he said go again go again go
[1:09:16] again he said but this time I see a
[1:09:19] cloud like a man's hand and it puts some
[1:09:22] kind of Supernatural strength on the
[1:09:24] inside of a elah that he ran 17 miles
[1:09:28] with a renewed strength with a renewed
[1:09:31] Spirit that's what the Holy Ghost does
[1:09:33] to a born again son and daughter of God
[1:09:35] you may have been weak from the battle
[1:09:37] you may have been weak from fasting and
[1:09:39] praying but all of a sudden it's a
[1:09:42] refreshing from the
[1:09:47] Lord and Elijah
[1:09:51] immediately goes suicidal
[1:09:57] just read First Kings chapter 19 he goes
[1:09:59] suicidal said
[1:10:00] God he was so upset that people were
[1:10:03] rejecting the message you can see why
[1:10:06] William brandham is standing here in
[1:10:07] this generation and he gets so upset he
[1:10:09] don't want to do anything with people no
[1:10:11] more he don't want to have nothing to do
[1:10:13] with him they are rejecting the greatest
[1:10:15] thing and William brandham knew that
[1:10:17] they were rejecting not him they
[1:10:20] rejecting
[1:10:22] Christ and Elijah is is so upset he's
[1:10:26] wore out from preaching and showing that
[1:10:29] God is still God and Jezebel has got all
[1:10:32] of Israel in a Frizzle and they're
[1:10:34] worked up because of her painted face
[1:10:37] religion down there that he finds
[1:10:39] himself under of a juniper tree God
[1:10:41] feeds him and gives him Supernatural
[1:10:44] rest and the very next stage of this of
[1:10:46] this chapter he's there in a cave and he
[1:10:50] hears a
[1:10:52] voice maybe you've been in a cave
[1:10:57] but I going to tell you what's getting
[1:10:58] ready to come out of your ministry is
[1:11:00] going to be one of the greatest things
[1:11:02] that's ever happened because you can see
[1:11:04] you can put this you can put this
[1:11:06] message on the inside of you you can put
[1:11:09] this power on the inside of you but we
[1:11:11] don't want to just keep it for ourself
[1:11:13] we want to do God's got plans God's got
[1:11:17] Glory plans he wasn't just going to keep
[1:11:19] the prophet's Ministry in Elijah he was
[1:11:22] going to turn his face toward elij
[1:11:25] he was going to anoint J he was going to
[1:11:28] anoint
[1:11:30] Heil he's got plans but what attracted
[1:11:34] him it was the voice the glory of his
[1:11:37] voice now notice First Kings 19-1 15 and
[1:11:40] I I pray you I pray you just stick with
[1:11:43] me just for a minute and the Lord said
[1:11:45] unto him go and return on thy way to the
[1:11:48] Wilderness of Damascus and when thou
[1:11:50] comest anoint hazil to be king over
[1:11:51] Syria and juu the son of nimi Shout thou
[1:11:55] anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha
[1:11:59] the son of shafat of aimo shalt thou
[1:12:02] anoint to be the prophet in myy room and
[1:12:05] it shall come to pass that him that
[1:12:07] escape escape with the sword of ail
[1:12:10] shall Jus slay and him that escape the
[1:12:13] sword of ju shall Elisha slay yet I have
[1:12:16] left me 7,000 down there in Israel all
[1:12:20] the knees which have not bowed under
[1:12:21] baale and every mouth which hath not
[1:12:24] kissed him here Elijah goes from being
[1:12:27] suicidal he goes from underneath a
[1:12:29] juniper tree he goes into a cave and all
[1:12:32] of a sudden God's got plans for his life
[1:12:35] he tells him you're not alone you're not
[1:12:37] in this battle alone you're not
[1:12:39] believing this message alone but there's
[1:12:41] 7,000 that was up there on that mountain
[1:12:44] with you that was worshiping the only
[1:12:46] true and living God they are
[1:12:48] there we you don't see nobody else
[1:12:51] there's still a glory behind the veil
[1:12:55] that you can't see don't get
[1:12:57] disappointed at what you see don't get
[1:12:59] disappointed because of the distractions
[1:13:01] that are going
[1:13:03] on God's got a plan
[1:13:09] together so God
[1:13:12] anoints God anoints these ministers to
[1:13:15] be God's Vengeance on Earth that ju and
[1:13:19] Hil were going to slay with a sword and
[1:13:21] Elisha was going to slay as well but he
[1:13:24] was going to do it in a different
[1:13:25] different way he was going to slay with
[1:13:27] the word of a king and he went out there
[1:13:30] notice what he did when Elijah comes the
[1:13:33] when Elijah comes to Elisha he sees
[1:13:36] Elisha out there plowing and he's got 12
[1:13:38] oxen he's got a team of them out there
[1:13:41] together he's a mighty man of wealth
[1:13:43] he's a mighty man of wealth he's he's
[1:13:45] plowing straight and there was something
[1:13:47] about the way Elisha was the way he was
[1:13:50] plowing was to recognize that that was
[1:13:53] Elisha before he knew what his name was
[1:13:55] he knew that he was a straight shooter
[1:13:57] right there and Elisha said let me go
[1:14:00] back when the man who got threw over on
[1:14:02] him he said let me go back and kiss my
[1:14:05] mother and my father goodbye and Elijah
[1:14:09] I was always amazed at that that Elijah
[1:14:11] let him go back he let him go back and
[1:14:14] kiss his past goodbye he took up the
[1:14:17] best he had he didn't just have the best
[1:14:19] auction he had the best tools he was a
[1:14:22] mighty man of wealth and he stood right
[1:14:24] there and he took all that he had he
[1:14:27] took his toes he took his memory he took
[1:14:30] his affections he took his past he took
[1:14:33] his conscience and he put it on a fire
[1:14:35] and he kissed his pass goodbye and he
[1:14:38] sold out to be in full-time
[1:14:43] Ministry and immediately he goes into
[1:14:46] the work because he's elected to carry
[1:14:48] out a message brother bam said it was a
[1:14:50] sign to the world that he cut every
[1:14:52] Shoreline loose right there
[1:14:57] god brother Homer said it like
[1:15:01] this that God sometimes get it in a
[1:15:04] killing mood that's right you ever heard
[1:15:07] him say that sometimes God gets in a
[1:15:08] killing mood because they had turned
[1:15:10] down the message and they started going
[1:15:13] down there and they started following
[1:15:15] underneath of Jezebel's religion and
[1:15:17] painting their up and bringing idol
[1:15:19] worship down there bringing it down
[1:15:21] there brother random said to you he said
[1:15:23] it in Jezebel religion he he said you
[1:15:25] don't paint yourself up to meet God you
[1:15:27] paint yourself up to meet a man he said
[1:15:31] there he went and anointed J now here it
[1:15:35] is in First Kings chapter 19 and you
[1:15:38] don't see J and Hil start showing up in
[1:15:41] the ministry until 2 Kings 9 and chapter
[1:15:44] 10 there is a delay sometimes in how we
[1:15:48] want God to work and you might think
[1:15:51] that you have sinned and got by with it
[1:15:54] but God will get to you he will get to
[1:15:57] you Ahab he will get to you Jezebel and
[1:16:00] he anointed ju to go down
[1:16:03] there and ju stood there and was
[1:16:06] anointed as a king to go down there and
[1:16:09] had Unix to kick Jezebel off the Tower
[1:16:13] and the dogs licked up her
[1:16:18] blood well I know it's going to get
[1:16:21] tough for a minute but help me preach
[1:16:24] what did J who do he fully fell under
[1:16:27] the anointing of Elijah and turned a
[1:16:30] woman right into dog meat that's what
[1:16:33] William brandham said he said that's who
[1:16:35] you are is dog meat if you call yourself
[1:16:39] filled with the Holy Ghost and paint
[1:16:41] yourself up like
[1:16:44] Jezebel he didn't call women a je he
[1:16:47] didn't call women dog meat he called
[1:16:49] people that called them themselves Holy
[1:16:51] Ghost Bible Believers filled with the
[1:16:54] spirit of God that paint themsel up and
[1:16:56] think they're a Christian he called them
[1:16:58] dog meat well don't preach it too
[1:17:00] straight the prophet said if you don't
[1:17:03] preach this and you don't preach
[1:17:04] clothline religion then you're not
[1:17:06] preaching the
[1:17:08] message but what I'm not trying to get
[1:17:11] your mind there but what I'm trying to
[1:17:13] get your mind on is that prophecy has
[1:17:16] got to be
[1:17:17] fulfilled because it had been prophesied
[1:17:20] by the Prophet Elijah that he was going
[1:17:22] to slay Ahab and all of his family and J
[1:17:27] brought violence to all of King zab's
[1:17:30] house God got in a killing mood and he
[1:17:33] went down there and he didn't just kill
[1:17:35] Ahab and he didn't just kill Jezebel but
[1:17:38] he killed all the influence of Ahab
[1:17:41] because juu was anointed to destroy not
[1:17:45] only the the family heritage of Ahab but
[1:17:48] he was anointed to tear down and cast
[1:17:51] down every Idol
[1:17:55] it was all under the ministry of
[1:18:00] Elijah and benad did the king of Syria
[1:18:03] at the time he had fell sick and he went
[1:18:06] down there he was wanting to ask the
[1:18:09] prophet Elisha if he was going to ever
[1:18:11] recover from this recover from his
[1:18:13] illness and Elisha answered him said no
[1:18:17] Hil is the one that is Anointed to be
[1:18:20] king So ail was to destroy those that
[1:18:23] came out to war
[1:18:25] and J's family or or and J ahab's family
[1:18:29] that didn't come out so Hil and J were
[1:18:33] anointed to
[1:18:40] destroy I'm not here to kill you this
[1:18:43] morning I'm here to show you that
[1:18:45] there's Glory behind
[1:18:48] this there might be people that get
[1:18:50] upset at Elijah's Ministry but there's
[1:18:52] some Glory behind this are you with me
[1:18:56] ju ju was going to slay Ahab and AIA was
[1:19:00] going to slay them but it did not stop
[1:19:02] there Elisha was standing there one day
[1:19:05] and there were some people that had
[1:19:07] mocked the message and had mocked the
[1:19:09] ministry and there were some people that
[1:19:11] still worship that that bail God down
[1:19:13] there living in bethl and they come down
[1:19:15] there and they started making fun of
[1:19:16] Elisha and making fun of him and calling
[1:19:18] him old Baldi and he called he called
[1:19:21] out some she Bears out of the mountains
[1:19:23] and killed 42 children that was mocking
[1:19:26] the message mocking the ministry trying
[1:19:28] to stop
[1:19:30] it Hallelujah you might be in a cave you
[1:19:35] might be in despair but wait for his
[1:19:39] glory you might think you're all alone
[1:19:42] you might see
[1:19:43] only you might only see Jezebel turning
[1:19:46] down the message but there's going to be
[1:19:48] some re bu be some real Believers that
[1:19:51] believe what you say that say Amen to
[1:19:53] what the tape say that believe what a
[1:19:55] prophet
[1:19:57] said what did God do he
[1:20:02] veiled
[1:20:03] himself and predestinated sons of God
[1:20:07] that was going to carry out his
[1:20:10] plans he got all of
[1:20:12] that while waiting in a
[1:20:16] cave don't you worry Elijah Don't You
[1:20:19] Worry Elijah I'm going to do I'm going
[1:20:22] to do what I said would do I would do so
[1:20:25] ju was anointed to destroy and he put a
[1:20:28] sword in his hand to throw down every
[1:20:30] Idol and every V baale worshipper in
[1:20:34] every hybrid religion I love what Paul
[1:20:37] said in 2 Corinthians 10:4 y'all breathe
[1:20:41] y'all breathe okay y'all breathe I'm
[1:20:43] coming to you I'm coming to you I ain't
[1:20:46] come here to slay you I'm coming here to
[1:20:48] tell you that God is going to take
[1:20:49] vengeance upon your
[1:20:52] enemies it ain't people it's a spirit
[1:20:55] that God's taking Vengeance on that's
[1:20:57] what God is after he said for the
[1:21:00] weapons of our Ware are not cornal but
[1:21:02] Mighty through the through God to the
[1:21:05] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[1:21:07] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:21:09] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:21:11] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:21:14] thought to The Obedience of Christ and
[1:21:17] having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[1:21:21] Disobedience when your obedience is ful
[1:21:24] F fi yes Lord the prophet said in the
[1:21:28] spoken word he said Christ was
[1:21:29] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:21:31] devil God's word which destroys the
[1:21:34] works of the hybrid devil he said is
[1:21:36] that right he was done he was done to do
[1:21:38] that he was born to be that to destroy
[1:21:41] the works of the devil now his body is
[1:21:43] to do the same because the body is aead
[1:21:46] and the body is together and if Christ
[1:21:49] is the head was the word his body has to
[1:21:51] be the same as his head was right a
[1:21:54] church of the Lord a church of the word
[1:21:57] born to be born of the word virgin born
[1:22:00] from the word not denominational but a
[1:22:03] virgin born from the word of God the way
[1:22:06] the body operates is by the head so when
[1:22:11] you see something come into your life
[1:22:13] you do the same thing that Christ did he
[1:22:16] was born to destroy the works of every
[1:22:19] hybrid devil of every Creed of every
[1:22:22] sadducee devil yeah
[1:22:25] of every Pharisee devil that brought
[1:22:27] itself and exalted itself against the
[1:22:29] message that he was
[1:22:34] bringing so God's going to Veil himself
[1:22:37] in you yes Lord to cast down
[1:22:42] imaginations to overcome inlay osia to
[1:22:45] overcome
[1:22:46] lukewarmness don't forget what you're
[1:22:48] fighting here don't forget what you're
[1:22:50] fighting here it's a spirit on an age
[1:22:52] that's trying to make you cold it's
[1:22:55] trying to make you lukewarm it's trying
[1:22:57] to put you in a naked position but don't
[1:22:59] you forget that you have been anointed
[1:23:03] you have been anointed to stand against
[1:23:05] the coldness of leosia against the
[1:23:07] lukewarmness of Leota against everything
[1:23:11] you have been
[1:23:12] anointed that you are the veil that God
[1:23:16] is gloring himself in you say well I'm
[1:23:20] not much brother Andrew and I ain't got
[1:23:22] much to my name I ain't got wisdom I
[1:23:24] ain't got intellects I ain't got
[1:23:26] understanding Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[1:23:28] 1:27 but God ha chosen the foolish
[1:23:31] things of this world to confound the
[1:23:33] wise and God have chosen the weak things
[1:23:36] of the world to confound the things
[1:23:38] which are Mighty and base things of the
[1:23:40] world and things which are despised hath
[1:23:42] God chosen yay and the things which are
[1:23:45] not to bring to not the things that are
[1:23:47] that no flesh should glory in his
[1:23:51] presence you and I have no right to
[1:23:55] glory in our
[1:23:57] flesh but of him are you in Christ Jesus
[1:24:01] who of God has made unto us wisdom and
[1:24:03] righteousness and sanctification and
[1:24:07] Redemption you're not worthy but he is
[1:24:11] you are not able you don't have the
[1:24:13] mindset like the rest of the
[1:24:16] world Lord but God chose the foolish
[1:24:20] things the things that were despised the
[1:24:23] things that were ready
[1:24:25] what right does a Peter have preaching
[1:24:27] after cussing after he saw Jesus
[1:24:33] hung but he is our wisdom our
[1:24:37] righteousness our sanctification and
[1:24:39] Redemption that according as it is
[1:24:41] written he that
[1:24:44] glorieth let him
[1:24:49] glory in the Lord this ain't Homer
[1:24:52] phasers Church come on this ain't Ron
[1:24:56] Spencer's church this ain't my church or
[1:24:58] William or Matthew or any other preacher
[1:25:00] this ain't our church this is God's
[1:25:05] Church the reason why there's a church
[1:25:08] on this hill is because God wanted to
[1:25:11] Glory himself in a veil that would not
[1:25:15] back up that would believe he's still
[1:25:17] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:19] when the rest of the world doesn't want
[1:25:21] to identify with a message there is a
[1:25:24] the
[1:25:26] church we're not gloring in William
[1:25:28] brandham but we are gloring in the
[1:25:33] Lord if you can ever find out who you're
[1:25:35] worshiping it's not a man it's not a
[1:25:38] dead man it's not a man locked up in a
[1:25:41] tomb it's not a man that's still that's
[1:25:43] still fighting your battles he's still
[1:25:46] there's blood on a throne for
[1:25:48] you you're worshiping the Lord of hosts
[1:25:53] the king that is Mighty in
[1:26:00] pattle and if you don't believe it God
[1:26:03] will make a fool of your enemies
[1:26:07] amen come on somebody you watch on

[1:29:45] you William brandom stood there all
[1:29:47] alone all alone when the rest of the
[1:29:50] world said there's nothing to this
[1:29:52] Divine Healing they told told him he was
[1:29:54] just a little bitt on nothing just like
[1:29:56] he told David he was a little bitt old
[1:29:58] rut he was a little bitt on nothing what
[1:30:00] are you doing down here but William
[1:30:02] brandham said I know what this slingshot
[1:30:05] of Faith Can Do I've seen what it did
[1:30:07] for a congressman Upshaw so I know what
[1:30:10] it'll do that's why David didn't take
[1:30:12] some ecclesiastical vest he didn't take
[1:30:14] Saul's armor but he took in what he knew
[1:30:17] he said this killed go he said this
[1:30:18] killed a bear this killed a lion I put
[1:30:21] this to work that's what William
[1:30:23] brandham said I accepted a challenge to
[1:30:25] to preach Divine Healing to a world that
[1:30:28] didn't want it yeah
[1:30:34] amen I challenge
[1:30:36] you now the Bible said in 2 Corinthians
[1:30:40] 3 if y'all don't know this I have
[1:30:42] preached three sermons to you
[1:30:46] already I'm giving them to you in
[1:30:49] stages you may have been in a
[1:30:52] cave you may have come underneath a
[1:30:55] juniper tree and you just had some of
[1:30:57] the best cornbread you ever ate in your
[1:30:58] life hallelujah amen but you've been in
[1:31:02] the
[1:31:03] cave you've heard a voice now you're
[1:31:06] anointing people and now you're the veil
[1:31:09] that God is using and the Bible said in
[1:31:12] 2 Corinthians 3 and 6 who also hath made
[1:31:14] us able that word able means to qualify
[1:31:17] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[1:31:19] the letter but of the spirit for the
[1:31:21] letter kth but of the but the spirit
[1:31:23] gives life but if the ministation of
[1:31:26] death the law written and engraven in
[1:31:29] Stones was glorious so that the children
[1:31:32] of Israel could not steadfastly behold
[1:31:33] the face of Moses for the glory of his
[1:31:36] countenance which Glory was to be done
[1:31:39] away Christ didn't come to put it away
[1:31:42] he come to magnify the law which Glory
[1:31:45] was to be done away how shall not the
[1:31:47] ministration of the spirit rather be
[1:31:51] glorious for if the ministration of
[1:31:53] condemnation be glory much more do the
[1:31:56] ministration of righteousness exceed in
[1:31:58] glory for even that which was made
[1:32:01] glorious has no glory in this Respect by
[1:32:04] reason of the glory that excelth for if
[1:32:08] that which was done away was glorious
[1:32:11] much more that which remaineth is
[1:32:16] glorious amen so if it was that glorious
[1:32:19] that Moses had to Veil himself to the
[1:32:22] children of Israel because his face
[1:32:24] Shone with the glory of the Lord that he
[1:32:26] had to Veil himself they didn't want to
[1:32:29] hear from God so God veiled himself in a
[1:32:31] prophet so he spoke his law through a
[1:32:34] prophet's lips and Paul is saying if
[1:32:38] that was glorious how much more when the
[1:32:41] Holy Ghost wasn't given then but now it
[1:32:44] is given you see he rote on Stone then
[1:32:48] but that stone couldn't live that stone
[1:32:50] couldn't praise that stone couldn't
[1:32:52] shout that stone couldn't amen but now
[1:32:55] he's got a body now he has wrote it on
[1:32:58] the tables of your heart and it's got
[1:33:01] life it's got power it's got
[1:33:04] manifestation God didn't want to just
[1:33:07] Veil Veil himself behind bads or skins
[1:33:10] and a whirlwind and a pillar of fire but
[1:33:12] God wants your
[1:33:16] tent God wants your tent and you might
[1:33:19] think you're on the verge of giving up
[1:33:22] you might be in a pit of dis spare when
[1:33:24] nobody
[1:33:27] else I'm very careful with this I don't
[1:33:30] ever let this word loose but I'm going
[1:33:32] to let it Loose today because I feel it
[1:33:34] you might be in a spot where you think
[1:33:36] you all the best thing in your life is
[1:33:38] to take your
[1:33:44] life Hallelujah but God does hallelujah
[1:33:48] you're not alone God loves you God gave
[1:33:52] his life for you he died on a cross for
[1:33:57] you don't let that devil lie to you and
[1:34:01] tell you you're not worth it don't let
[1:34:03] that devil tell you you don't have a
[1:34:04] life worth the Holy Ghost I come in the
[1:34:07] name of Jesus Christ to rebuke a devil
[1:34:10] that would steal a young person's
[1:34:12] life I come in the name of
[1:34:15] Israel May that demon be
[1:34:22] mocked Hallelujah God don't want just
[1:34:25] tables of stone he don't want just the
[1:34:27] Ark of a covenant he don't want just a
[1:34:29] rod he don't want just man in a pot he
[1:34:32] wants your tent he wants your Veil

[1:35:03] name of Jesus Christ you have no power

[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:19] pole God want
[1:35:22] you worst than you want
[1:35:26] him thank I sat down a couple weeks ago
[1:35:29] with brother Benjamin King he's not here
[1:35:31] I I specifically asked this question
[1:35:35] and I believe I've got authority to say
[1:35:38] this
[1:35:41] here but as you can see there is a move
[1:35:44] in the Amish
[1:35:48] community that God set this up because
[1:35:53] God had a elected people down in
[1:35:55] there he had elected genan seeds of God
[1:35:58] that were down there hiding
[1:36:01] hiding hiding you want to find where God
[1:36:04] wants to hide at he wants to hide in you
[1:36:05] brother Melvin he wants to he wants to
[1:36:07] hide in you he wants to hide in every
[1:36:08] one of you but religion had held these
[1:36:12] people back but when they got a taste to
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:15] message let me tell you something you
[1:36:17] ever get a taste of this message I'm in
[1:36:19] a good dose of this message I ain't just
[1:36:20] talking about some feeling I ain't just
[1:36:22] talking about some intellectual thing
[1:36:23] that somebody told you about the message
[1:36:25] and what William brandham did but I'm
[1:36:26] talking about a taste of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:29] and what this message is is Jesus Christ
[1:36:31] you can't walk away from this message
[1:36:33] you can't walk away from this
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:40] power and I I was talking to a brother
[1:36:43] and basically basically how how how I
[1:36:46] understand this has been transpiring is
[1:36:49] that there's a brother brother Matt
[1:36:50] Morris and some other brothers that have
[1:36:52] been working and having telephone
[1:36:54] hookups and they have been working with
[1:36:57] the amus community and been been just
[1:36:59] basically taking this phone call and
[1:37:01] preaching preaching the message over
[1:37:03] over the just basically just going over
[1:37:05] some fundamental things in the message
[1:37:08] and people started listen to William
[1:37:09] brand they started listening to the
[1:37:10] message they got it they got it through
[1:37:12] different forms and got it different I
[1:37:13] don't care how you get the message as
[1:37:15] long as you get the message is that
[1:37:18] right a prostitute can testify about
[1:37:20] this
[1:37:21] message a drug addict can testify about
[1:37:24] this message so God can use every form
[1:37:27] every form because how are them formed
[1:37:30] how was the internet created what was it
[1:37:32] created it wasn't created for the devil
[1:37:34] it was created to bring forth a message
[1:37:38] now men have corrupted every form of it
[1:37:40] is but the real form of what every every
[1:37:43] scientific thing is to bring the message
[1:37:47] out that ain't a pet Doctrine that's
[1:37:49] just that's just how it
[1:37:51] is and and people were grabbing the
[1:37:53] message and you can go and ask you can
[1:37:55] go ask them and I had heard heard this
[1:37:57] so I asked brother Benjamin and it it's
[1:38:00] it's a family member that is connected
[1:38:01] to them and the kids were about 18 19
[1:38:04] years old and they had been listening to
[1:38:06] the message they' been listening to the
[1:38:08] message but the parents wouldn't listen
[1:38:09] to it didn't want anything to do with it
[1:38:11] but the kids were were of age and they
[1:38:13] was listen to the message and and and
[1:38:16] and on their home place the kids were
[1:38:18] inside the house and they were they were
[1:38:20] listening to the message and the Daddy
[1:38:23] was over this way maybe 100 yards in a
[1:38:25] shop that way and the mother and
[1:38:27] everybody else was over this way and
[1:38:29] while they were listening to the prophet
[1:38:31] on the inside of that house all of a
[1:38:34] sudden William brandom said come out of
[1:38:36] her my people and be you separate amen
[1:38:38] he said that on that tape and you know
[1:38:40] how loud your phone is you can't hardly
[1:38:42] hear it if somebody's talking in the
[1:38:43] background but these these brothers and
[1:38:46] sisters were out there 100 yards away 50
[1:38:49] yards away and they heard a prophet's
[1:38:52] voice say come out of her my people and
[1:38:55] they came to the message they come in
[1:38:57] there say what was that where did that
[1:38:59] come from where did that voice come
[1:39:02] from said Mama daddy that's some tapes
[1:39:05] we've been listening to and they all
[1:39:07] heard William brandom's voice a 100
[1:39:10] yards away now tell me if God is for you
[1:39:15] and God sees you then God will call you
[1:39:20] when nobody else wants to hear it
[1:39:22] because he's still still got
[1:39:24] plans he still got Glory plans behind
[1:39:28] his
[1:39:30] voice William Brad May went to a grave
[1:39:33] they may have tried to shut him up but
[1:39:35] his voice still resounds and it's still
[1:39:38] calling out a
[1:39:43] people what got you here what caused
[1:39:46] your attraction what brought you to this
[1:39:49] situation
[1:39:51] Moses Moses what got you here the last
[1:39:55] thing they remember about you is a
[1:40:01] murderer I love what the prophet said
[1:40:03] and if you want the message I'm just
[1:40:04] going to preach it but if you want the
[1:40:05] message I'll give it to you after church
[1:40:07] but William Brandon said this about
[1:40:09] Moses he said Moses he said I'm going to
[1:40:12] glorify you in the midst of them and he
[1:40:15] said I'm going to prove I'm going to
[1:40:17] prove to you that you didn't lie to them
[1:40:20] in telling them that you met me but I'm
[1:40:23] going going to prove I'm going to prove
[1:40:27] I'm going to prove that what I said to
[1:40:29] you up there in that Pillar of Fire is
[1:40:31] nothing but the
[1:40:34] truth God was veiled in Jesus Christ the
[1:40:37] word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us
[1:40:40] and we beheld his
[1:40:44] glory and the prophet said that if God
[1:40:47] is in you then God is still in flesh
[1:40:54] he's still in your flesh is he he's
[1:40:56] still he's still working don't you give
[1:40:59] up you may have seen him in the miracle
[1:41:00] of your son you may have seen him in the
[1:41:02] miracle of your daughter but he's still
[1:41:04] working he's in your flesh if you got
[1:41:06] him in you he's still in flesh I don't
[1:41:10] care how how you masas get so tormented
[1:41:13] sometimes with your children and you're

[1:43:27] put means to entrust it means to give up
[1:43:32] it means to deliver it means to yield it
[1:43:35] means to produce that's why Jesus said
[1:43:38] if my words abide in you ask what you
[1:43:41] will and it shall be done unto you I
[1:43:44] will put my spirit in you that word put
[1:43:49] is the same word that Jesus uses over
[1:43:52] Matthew chapter nine when he's standing
[1:43:54] there and said no man entrust an old
[1:43:56] garment no man puts an old garment a new
[1:43:59] garment or old garment and no man
[1:44:03] entrust no man entrust old bottles with
[1:44:06] new wine no man puts new wine new
[1:44:10] revelation new stimulation in some dried
[1:44:13] up cow
[1:44:15] hide you might put water on the inside
[1:44:17] of that thing but water is what
[1:44:20] remaineth after ashes and hydrogen it
[1:44:23] ain't got no life in it but if you've
[1:44:25] got wine you got life you got power
[1:44:29] that's why the message had to make you
[1:44:33] new he had to rid you part five part
[1:44:37] five he had to rid you of every doctrine
[1:44:40] that you came out of that's why the
[1:44:42] message said come out of her my people
[1:44:45] and be ye
[1:44:47] separate come on somebody he could not
[1:44:50] put this message the wine of stimulation
[1:44:53] by Revelation he could not put that down
[1:44:55] there in the Church of Christ in the
[1:44:57] Church of God in the Assemblies of God
[1:44:59] in the brethren in the methodists in the
[1:45:01] men in the menite or the Amish he had to
[1:45:04] put it in new bottles new powerhouses
[1:45:07] that could handle it because wine has
[1:45:09] got life in it it's got to
[1:45:14] move I feel like a Pentecostal up here
[1:45:17] you put this on the inside of some dried
[1:45:20] up
[1:45:21] CDE it'll bust it'll say it's nothing
[1:45:24] add ain't nothing to that but you put it
[1:45:26] on a new bottle that's been made a new
[1:45:30] in Christ Jesus it can handle the power
[1:45:33] it can handle the rejoicing it can
[1:45:35] handle the shouting it can handle the
[1:45:37] speaking in tongues it can handle the
[1:45:39] dancing it can handle it it's built to
[1:45:41] take it God entrusted you with the
[1:45:45] greatest message
[1:45:58] for if that was done away was
[1:46:01] glorious much more that which
[1:46:04] remaineth is
[1:46:06] glorious all I see is
[1:46:13] me all I see is my
[1:46:15] mistakes all I sees my failures God was
[1:46:19] going to take a Moses God was going to
[1:46:21] take a Paul God was going to take a
[1:46:23] William
[1:46:24] brandom and he was going to Veil his
[1:46:27] glory behind
[1:46:30] it that he can manifest his
[1:46:34] power you well I I don't feel like I I
[1:46:37] don't feel like I have the ability to
[1:46:41] witness and maybe sometimes you don't
[1:46:43] even know sometimes you don't even know
[1:46:46] sometimes it's just
[1:46:50] awkward now you're going to be honest
[1:46:51] with yourself sometimes it's awkward to
[1:46:54] tell that you believe in a last day
[1:46:58] Prophet I ain't ashamed but sometimes
[1:47:00] it's
[1:47:02] awkward I'll just be dead honest with
[1:47:04] you you you try to stand in my in my in
[1:47:08] my shoe sometimes when you're talking to
[1:47:12] trinitarians how did you get this
[1:47:14] knowledge well if it wasn't for a
[1:47:16] prophet I wouldn't have this
[1:47:19] knowledge and now I made it awkward for
[1:47:22] them
[1:47:24] yeah wait a minute well you believe a
[1:47:26] Bible don't you you believe in Malachi 4
[1:47:29] don't you well sure I do well then
[1:47:31] you're you you should be expecting that
[1:47:33] there's got to come four and five elijas
[1:47:36] in this
[1:47:37] generation and now you put it back on
[1:47:39] them but sometimes you're just LED down
[1:47:41] the road and you don't know what in the
[1:47:42] world why am I even doing this I was
[1:47:45] woke up about 2:38 this morning and I
[1:47:48] had a brother on my mind up all the way
[1:47:49] on the other side of the West Coast and
[1:47:51] this brother one day he was was he was
[1:47:54] uh he was just driving home from work
[1:47:56] and he he he's a real go-getter and he
[1:47:58] works real late but something something
[1:48:00] told him she to leave work early leave
[1:48:01] work early this morning leave work early
[1:48:04] here and go down this road and he said I
[1:48:06] don't I don't typically do that but he
[1:48:07] left work and and the spirit of God said
[1:48:09] turn down this road and he I don't ever
[1:48:11] go why would I even go down that road
[1:48:12] and he goes down this road and the
[1:48:14] spirit of God tells him turn down this
[1:48:15] road and all of a sudden he he says the
[1:48:18] spirit of God tells him go in this go in
[1:48:20] this health store and he goes in this
[1:48:22] health store and he hears a man standing
[1:48:24] there and he starts talking about the
[1:48:25] problems that he's in here we are he
[1:48:28] starts talking about the problems that
[1:48:29] he's in he start talking about he come
[1:48:31] to a spot where he didn't know how much
[1:48:32] more he could take of of pain of of life
[1:48:34] and all these things and all of a sudden
[1:48:37] this man recognizes why he's here why
[1:48:40] he's been LED
[1:48:42] here you may not be ever called behind
[1:48:44] the pull pit but maybe God wants to use
[1:48:46] you to drive down this road and drive
[1:48:48] down that road because he's got a
[1:48:50] brother or sister or maybe he's got some
[1:48:52] Sons out there that don't know him just
[1:48:54] yet so he's going to use you he's going
[1:48:56] to Veil himself on the inside of you so
[1:48:58] that he could witness the power of Jesus
[1:49:01] Christ and there brother Dave walner was
[1:49:03] is a very powerful witness he begin to
[1:49:06] testify to him that that God did not
[1:49:09] give you the spirit of fear and the
[1:49:11] spirit and the spirit of this world but
[1:49:13] he give you the spirit of love and power
[1:49:15] and a sound mind and that man came and
[1:49:19] gave his heart to the Lord and's been at
[1:49:21] church the last I heard him
[1:49:23] so God can take a man that doesn't look
[1:49:26] like a preacher doesn't act like a
[1:49:28] preacher but make him a witness that the
[1:49:31] message still
[1:49:36] works
[1:49:41] am if
[1:49:42] God if God wakes you up he's he's
[1:49:45] dealing with you you know sometimes you
[1:49:47] just wake
[1:49:49] up on your own but then there's those
[1:49:52] times when there Spirit of God's dealing
[1:49:53] with you and typically it's between the
[1:49:55] hours of 3 and 5: brother Brandon would
[1:49:58] say it like this that's when demons go
[1:50:01] to rest so God can start dealing with
[1:50:04] your
[1:50:06] subconscious a few years ago at sister
[1:50:08] Karen pu's funeral memorial
[1:50:12] service brother Jason Jackson had had
[1:50:14] went to the the the after the after the
[1:50:18] Memorial they were all there brother
[1:50:20] Tim's house and they just started
[1:50:22] testing about the goodness of God and
[1:50:23] all of a sudden brother Jason the spirit
[1:50:26] of God began to work on him and he I I
[1:50:29] believe brother Jason even told this
[1:50:30] here but he he he told that the spirit
[1:50:33] of God began to work on him he he said I
[1:50:34] literally thought I was beginning to
[1:50:35] speak in tongues I thought I was going
[1:50:37] to speak in tongues and he said he said
[1:50:38] I shut my mouth and walked outside and
[1:50:40] he said then I realized maybe that was
[1:50:42] for somebody here or something like that
[1:50:43] so he began to tell he began to tell
[1:50:45] brother Timothy about it and he he took
[1:50:47] him through the whole story brother Ron
[1:50:49] came down at that time so they started
[1:50:51] talking about the Miracles and all these
[1:50:52] things
[1:50:53] things and sister Esther had had dealt
[1:50:56] with barrenness for so long and she had
[1:50:57] a very very hard miscarriage and and it
[1:51:02] been very heavy on her and all of a
[1:51:05] sudden the spirit of God began to
[1:51:06] speak begin to speak to them here sister
[1:51:10] Karen goes beyond the veil of
[1:51:13] tears and Beyond the curtain of time and
[1:51:17] all of a sudden the spirit of God began
[1:51:18] to speak to them said you think they may
[1:51:20] she may have been shaking this one's
[1:51:21] hand but she was shaking the ones of
[1:51:24] those grandchildren of miscarriages that
[1:51:26] had went there they were some of the
[1:51:29] very first hands they were shaken
[1:51:33] am you think well could God use me like
[1:51:37] that God wants to use anybody he
[1:51:41] can yes Lord if he's in
[1:51:44] you he's
[1:51:47] still God in
[1:51:49] flesh because when Moses went up
[1:51:53] here part
[1:51:54] six and Moses went up there part six a
[1:51:58] real short
[1:52:01] one Moses went up there all of a sudden
[1:52:05] he got the same characteristics that
[1:52:06] Jehovah had because brother brandom said
[1:52:09] it like this that the pillar of fire
[1:52:10] went off that bush and went into
[1:52:14] Moses and went into
[1:52:16] Moses it went into Moses and Moses went
[1:52:19] down there with the same creative power
[1:52:21] of the characteristics of Jehovah
[1:52:23] because no man's words will act like
[1:52:25] that no man's words can create no man's
[1:52:27] can speak flies and frogs and lice and
[1:52:30] and kill cattle and turn blood water
[1:52:32] into blood but the same characteristics
[1:52:35] that was on the inside of Jehovah was
[1:52:37] now made manifest on the inside of Moses
[1:52:41] what was it the same power that same
[1:52:43] Pillar of Fire that came off that bush
[1:52:45] that went into Moses was the same Pillar
[1:52:47] of Fire that went into Paul that same
[1:52:49] Pillar of Fire that went into Paul went
[1:52:51] into William Bram that same message that
[1:52:53] William Brandon preached has now come
[1:52:55] into a body that believes the
[1:52:57] supernatural that will produce that will
[1:52:59] speak William brandham said it in in the
[1:53:02] word the letter to the church he said
[1:53:04] this bride has thus sayith the Lord or
[1:53:07] she stands
[1:53:14] still the part Seven's my
[1:53:19] favorite because now he's got you in
[1:53:25] flesh he's got a man by the name of
[1:53:27] William brandom he starts working
[1:53:28] through working through him said I see a
[1:53:30] great dignitary back
[1:53:33] there I see a great dignitary back here
[1:53:35] he's been he's been injured in an
[1:53:37] accident in a farming accident and he's
[1:53:39] laid as an invalet state for 66 years I
[1:53:42] see you as standing at some great
[1:53:44] Statesman or whatnot and he recognizes
[1:53:47] that it's Congressman Upshaw that is
[1:53:49] standing there and he says congressman
[1:53:53] and Congressman UPS was in a in a brown
[1:53:55] shirt or a brown suit he said
[1:53:57] Congressman he said do you have a blue
[1:53:59] suit he said sunny I just bought it
[1:54:01] yesterday he said well thus sayith the
[1:54:02] Lord he said you're going to be healed
[1:54:04] he said I saw you walking down the road
[1:54:06] in that blue
[1:54:12] suit he only lived a year and a half
[1:54:16] after his healing but he lived
[1:54:18] completely free and testified to Kings
[1:54:21] and potentates and that's how the
[1:54:23] message got to
[1:54:24] England Hallelujah you never know what
[1:54:28] your healing will do you never know what
[1:54:30] your touch will do you never know what
[1:54:33] the voice of God will do to you when
