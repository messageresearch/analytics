[45:06] and grieve not
[45:09] the holy spirit of god
[45:11] whereby ye are sealed
[45:14] unto the day
[45:16] of redemption and now if you're trying
[45:18] with me to john 19 and while you're
[45:20] flipping there john 19 verse 25
[45:24] with help of the lord i'd like to speak
[45:25] to you this evening with the power of a
[45:27] seal
[45:29] a finished work
[45:31] and if the lord will just help us grab a
[45:32] hold of this i believe it'll change on
[45:34] how we on on how we think of ourselves
[45:36] many times we've got to recognize
[45:39] who we are as christians you say brother
[45:41] william that's preached all the time
[45:43] across this pulpit that's exactly right
[45:45] because that's what the message of the
[45:46] hour is is to teach us brother shannon
[45:48] who we are
[45:50] because if you don't know who you are
[45:52] then you can't exercise your authority
[45:54] over the devil
[45:56] in john 19 verse 25 now there stood by
[45:58] the cross of jesus
[46:01] his mother and his mother's sister mary
[46:03] the wife of cleopas
[46:05] and mary magdalene
[46:07] when jesus therefore saw his mother and
[46:09] the disciples standing by whom he loved
[46:12] he saith unto his mother woman
[46:14] behold thy son
[46:16] then saith he to the disciple behold thy
[46:18] mother and from that hour that disciple
[46:21] took her unto his own house
[46:23] and after this jesus knowing
[46:27] that all things were now accomplished
[46:29] that the scripture might be
[46:31] fulfilled saith
[46:33] i thirst
[46:35] now there was set a vessel full of
[46:37] vinegar
[46:38] and they filled a sponge with vinegar
[46:40] and put it upon hyssop and put it to his
[46:42] mouth when jesus therefore had received
[46:45] the vinegar he said it is finished
[46:50] and he bowed his head and he gave up the
[46:52] ghost
[46:53] god bless you you can be seated the
[46:56] power of a seal we know that a seal
[46:59] means a finished work so when jesus was
[47:01] dying on the cross he went through all
[47:03] that agony and he when he said it is
[47:05] finished what does that mean that means
[47:07] that what is finished redemption is
[47:09] finished salvation is finished your your
[47:13] healing is finished everything that you
[47:15] have need of
[47:16] was finished when he paid the full price
[47:19] now jesus walked in a very conscious
[47:22] manner
[47:23] jesus knew and as he walked on the earth
[47:25] he knew exactly where he was he knew who
[47:29] he was
[47:30] and he was able to make powerful
[47:32] statements like this brother jerry he
[47:33] said i came from god
[47:36] and i go back to god
[47:38] he knew where he came from he knew where
[47:40] he was he knew what his work was what
[47:43] his purpose was and he knew where he was
[47:45] going
[47:46] well if the groom knows that then the
[47:48] bridegroom the if the bridegroom knows
[47:50] that rather then the bride must also
[47:52] know where she came from why she's here
[47:55] on the earth and where she's going
[47:57] there's libraries and multitudes of
[47:59] books that are written about find your
[48:01] purpose in life
[48:03] a purpose-driven life what is the
[48:05] purpose we know what purpose we have to
[48:08] be here on the earth we know why god has
[48:10] called us unto this hour so when you
[48:13] know where your position is you know who
[48:15] god called you to be you can then stand
[48:18] in authority and you can then stand toe
[48:20] to toe with the devil because you know
[48:22] there's no power within yourself but you
[48:24] have all of heaven that is behind you
[48:33] when you read the scripture
[48:35] in jesus all the agony that he went
[48:38] through
[48:39] all the suffering that he went through
[48:41] all the cruel beating that he had gone
[48:43] through he was on the cross
[48:46] all of his organs they say you could see
[48:48] them through the ribs he was beat so bad
[48:49] he was still in that state yet he was
[48:51] still conscious enough to know that
[48:54] there was still a scripture left off
[48:56] so the bible tells us in saint john that
[48:59] knowing that the scripture might be
[49:01] fulfilled
[49:02] he was hanging on the cross with nails
[49:05] in in his hands and in his feet with all
[49:07] the sin of the world upon him
[49:10] with your sin with my sin yet he was
[49:12] still conscious and knew
[49:14] there was a word that still needed to be
[49:16] fulfilled so in order to fulfill that
[49:18] word he said i thirst
[49:21] and when they took that that when they
[49:23] took that reed that sponge and they gave
[49:25] him that vinegar
[49:26] he then said it is finished because in
[49:29] psalm 69 21 david said they gave me also
[49:32] golf for my meat and in my thirst they
[49:34] gave me vinegar to drink
[49:38] jesus knew
[49:40] he had one more scripture to fulfill
[49:42] and when that final scripture was
[49:44] fulfilled he then said it is finished
[49:47] now a seal as i said is a finished work
[49:49] and we are perfect
[49:51] in him
[49:52] remember the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:54] the holy ghost on your soul is a
[49:56] finished work
[49:59] you say i still see so many mistakes in
[50:01] my life i still see so many things i
[50:02] need to change but god gives you the
[50:04] holy ghost based on predestination he
[50:07] gives you the holy ghost not knowing
[50:09] what you're going to do tomorrow or the
[50:10] next day or what you're going to do with
[50:11] it he gives you the holy ghost knowing
[50:13] that it's going to take you it's what
[50:15] you need and he knows that you're going
[50:17] to stay with it and in it because it's
[50:20] keeping you
[50:21] so your the holy ghost is keeping you so
[50:23] he gives it to you based on
[50:24] predestination
[50:26] and even though as newborn babes the
[50:28] bible says we desire the sincere milk of
[50:30] the word and we're born again
[50:33] and we need to grow up in that stature
[50:36] the bible talks about of a perfect man
[50:38] but god gives you the holy ghost now to
[50:40] equip you for that
[50:43] and then you're then transformed you're
[50:45] go from glory to glory and god knows
[50:48] that you're gonna be there
[50:50] because he's given you the down payment
[50:52] of it he's done sealed you
[50:55] and once something's been sealed you
[50:56] can't unseal it
[51:00] we are justified by faith in the
[51:02] finished work of calvary
[51:05] we are benefactors of calvary 2000 years
[51:07] ago right now
[51:09] this very moment
[51:10] because we know that the holy ghost is
[51:12] the literal life of jesus christ that is
[51:14] how that is proof of his resurrection
[51:17] it is proof of his resurrection because
[51:19] the same life that lived in him lives in
[51:22] the holy ghost believer
[51:25] so if the same life that was in him is
[51:28] in you is going to make you act the same
[51:30] way
[51:31] it's going to make you attracted to the
[51:33] word the same way it's going to make you
[51:37] overcome the devil the same way
[51:39] it's going to make you know your
[51:41] position in scripture the same way
[51:47] the prophet teaches us that everything
[51:48] we have need of
[51:50] everything that you'll ever need in life
[51:54] is given to you at the time of the
[51:56] baptism of the holy ghost he said
[51:58] including the rapture
[52:01] but see it's a seal it's in there
[52:03] everything you have need of
[52:05] is in you at the time of the holy ghost
[52:08] it's there it's just got to be come out
[52:10] well how does it come out by feeding it
[52:12] with the word
[52:14] not just from week into weekend all week
[52:16] long every day is an experience and it
[52:18] draws the life of christ out of your
[52:20] very being
[52:22] didn't jesus say that about person that
[52:24] has the holy ghost out of his belly
[52:25] shall flow rivers of water
[52:30] brother brahm told us and brother
[52:31] shannon you you'll be familiar with this
[52:33] about loading train cars
[52:36] and he told us about how he used to work
[52:37] with his dad on the trains
[52:39] and how they would load the trains up
[52:40] and but before the inspector could set
[52:42] the seal on the train car he would had
[52:44] come by and make sure that everything
[52:46] was just right
[52:48] because they knew the inspector knew the
[52:50] company hired the inspector to cover
[52:52] their to keep their damages to an
[52:54] absolute minimum or if not eliminate
[52:55] them altogether
[52:57] because they knew that that train would
[52:59] go through areas and maybe come to where
[53:01] they have to make really really hard
[53:03] breaks maybe have to stop really fast
[53:05] and things had to be packed just right
[53:07] yes
[53:10] just like god has things in order he's
[53:12] got steps he's got justification and
[53:14] sanctification
[53:15] and if there's still things
[53:17] or bad habits that are hanging in your
[53:19] life that you haven't been sanctified
[53:21] from god's not going to fill you yet
[53:24] because the train car is still rattling
[53:26] around
[53:28] but once everything you've been cleaned
[53:30] out then the inspector sets the seal on
[53:32] you and when the great inspector sets
[53:34] the seal on you nothing can touch you
[53:37] until you've reached your destination
[53:41] now with the holy ghost
[53:43] satan likes to try and water down the
[53:45] power of the holy ghost
[53:47] with the holy ghost the prophet said we
[53:49] have enough power
[53:51] within us
[53:53] to create a world
[53:56] and go live on it
[53:57] if we ever feel like doing it it's now
[54:00] if i ever felt like creating my own
[54:02] world and going to live on it it's right
[54:03] about now
[54:06] but you know that's not god's perfect
[54:08] will
[54:09] which is why he set
[54:11] a guard there because it's according to
[54:13] your faith
[54:14] and that's not god's plan for us for us
[54:16] to all go create our worlds and go live
[54:18] on it his plan is that we all go with
[54:19] him where he is there may we be also and
[54:22] then we're all going to come back
[54:23] together as the great family of god back
[54:26] to earth again that's his plan
[54:28] but the prophet was making an example of
[54:30] just how powerful the holy ghost is
[54:34] because if the holy ghost if satan can
[54:36] get us to doubt our weapon
[54:38] he's got us wicked
[54:40] no matter how powerful your weapon is no
[54:43] matter how wonderful your armor is
[54:46] if the enemy has got you bluffed until
[54:48] you think of thinking and to get you to
[54:50] think that it's not enough he's got you
[54:52] whipped
[54:54] yet all the angels of god yet all of
[54:56] heaven looks down and sees what you're
[54:58] equipped with
[55:01] in another dimension but yet satan can
[55:03] get a believer in a corner in such a
[55:05] weak state
[55:07] and make you think that your weapon
[55:09] ain't strong enough your weapon
[55:11] is the same weapon that jesus christ had
[55:13] you think he he beat satan with the word
[55:16] every single time and he gives you the
[55:19] exact same weapon
[55:20] to beat the same devil with
[55:23] we're fighting the same devil think of
[55:24] this we're fighting the same devil that
[55:26] jesus did
[55:29] we're fighting the same spirits of
[55:31] phariseeism we're fighting the same
[55:33] spirits of sadducees
[55:35] the same spirits the same holy ghost the
[55:38] same life of christ everything is set
[55:40] still the same it's just the flesh has
[55:42] changed
[55:46] now when you see the order of the
[55:48] scripture jesus is coming to passover
[55:51] and he's coming to passover and he
[55:53] begins the disciples are on the edge of
[55:55] their seats they're waiting on the
[55:56] messiah to kick out all the romans
[55:58] they've got in their own idea of what
[55:59] the messiah is going to do and when
[56:01] jesus comes he's healing the sick he's
[56:02] cast out devils that's great but they've
[56:04] always got a sword somewhere
[56:06] they're waiting for jesus to to take
[56:08] over
[56:10] so jesus begins to lay out the order of
[56:12] events
[56:13] and he begins to say that somebody is
[56:15] going to betray me and that all of you
[56:17] i'm going to be forsaken by all of you
[56:19] and i must go up to jerusalem i must
[56:22] fall into the hands of wicked man i must
[56:24] be crucified and the disciples are
[56:26] having to try without the holy ghost yet
[56:29] they're having to wrap their minds about
[56:31] around all this
[56:32] because they put all their hopes in
[56:34] jesus christ which is a wonderful thing
[56:38] but what they missed was the crucifixion
[56:41] they missed that the holy ghost had to
[56:43] come back
[56:45] so as jesus was beginning to lay all
[56:46] this out they began to get really
[56:48] worried they began to get real sorrowful
[56:50] and that's when peter went ahead and
[56:52] said you know all men forsake you i want
[56:56] in saint john 14 jesus said it's verse
[56:58] 16 and i will pray the father and he
[57:01] shall give you another comforter that he
[57:03] may abide with you forever
[57:06] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[57:08] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[57:10] neither knoweth him but ye know him
[57:13] for he dwelleth with you
[57:16] that was wonderful but listen how it's
[57:17] about to get better and shall
[57:20] be in you
[57:22] that's better being him being in us is a
[57:24] whole lot better than him being just
[57:26] with us in the body
[57:28] i will not leave you comfortless you
[57:30] talk about some beautiful words
[57:32] he says i won't leave you comfortless
[57:34] the world's without comfort the world is
[57:36] without peace but he says i won't leave
[57:38] you comfortless
[57:41] i will come to you
[57:43] yet just a little while right now they
[57:45] see me they're about to crucify me
[57:47] they're about to stick a spear in my
[57:49] side but he said yet a little while the
[57:51] world won't see me no more
[57:54] he said but you see me
[57:56] who do we see every weekend who do we
[57:58] see in our lives who do we see when we
[58:00] open up the bible who do we see when we
[58:02] go to work
[58:04] who do we see in the car with us who do
[58:06] we feel when we pray
[58:08] the world don't feel that
[58:10] but you feel that because of this
[58:12] because he said the world ain't going to
[58:13] see me no more but you're going to see
[58:15] me and i'm not only going to be with you
[58:17] now i'm not then going to be in you
[58:21] because i live
[58:23] that's key we can't live apart from him
[58:25] he says because i live ye shall live
[58:28] also
[58:29] there would be no holy ghost without a
[58:31] crucifixion there'd be no holy ghost
[58:33] without a resurrection
[58:34] the holy ghost is his is the proof of
[58:37] his resurrection
[58:40] when the pillar of fire would come down
[58:42] and do all their miracles
[58:44] and brother brahms meetings when it when
[58:45] that ministry was ordained to be on the
[58:47] earth it was the holy ghost that did it
[58:49] because it was the same spirit that
[58:51] dwelt in jesus that came that was in his
[58:53] prophet that came down and did the exact
[58:55] same works
[58:57] in john 16 7. nevertheless i tell you
[59:00] the truth it is expedient for you that i
[59:02] go away for if i go not away the
[59:05] comforter will not come unto you but if
[59:08] i depart i will send him to you many
[59:10] times we see weakness in the wrong way
[59:12] weakness is actually strength
[59:15] the disciples were all worried and tore
[59:17] up oh my goodness jesus was we had such
[59:19] a hope when you read in the scriptures
[59:21] when they were on the way to on the road
[59:22] to emmaus
[59:24] they said we had hoped that he would
[59:25] restore the kingdom of israel but here
[59:27] he was crucified what are we going to do
[59:30] peter and john the disciples they were
[59:31] so discouraged they went fishing
[59:35] but it was a time for them to draw
[59:37] strength
[59:38] because god was getting ready to change
[59:40] dispensations
[59:42] when the prophet of god was taken off
[59:43] the scene imagine the discouragement
[59:45] brother matthew that here they were
[59:46] expecting on every single meeting the
[59:49] rapture could come the rapture could
[59:50] come they'd see god manifest
[59:53] expecting the rapture at any time and
[59:55] that's the way we should be at every
[59:56] service but all of a sudden their phone
[59:59] rings and they pick up the prophet has
[1:00:00] been in an accident
[1:00:02] how can this be
[1:00:04] how can this be i thought he was going
[1:00:05] to be on the earth he made comments that
[1:00:08] said he hopes that he believes god will
[1:00:09] let him see the rapture and things
[1:00:11] how can this be he's in the hospital
[1:00:13] everybody's praying everybody's praying
[1:00:14] everybody's praying then all of a sudden
[1:00:16] christmas eve right there he slips away
[1:00:21] imagine how discouraged everyone felt
[1:00:24] i would have felt very discouraged
[1:00:27] but you find that god ordained it that
[1:00:29] way because it was time for message
[1:00:31] believers to quit just looking to him
[1:00:33] and look at what he said
[1:00:35] to look at what he said take what he
[1:00:36] said back to the scripture and see the
[1:00:38] vindication of the message
[1:00:40] but when he was here on the earth they
[1:00:42] were just following the meetings they
[1:00:43] were overwhelmed by the amount of truth
[1:00:45] they were receiving
[1:00:46] but now we've had all these 70 years or
[1:00:49] 60 70 years time's gone by so fast to
[1:00:51] look into these things and get ready for
[1:00:53] the rapture so we're gonna have to be
[1:00:55] we're gonna be without excuse
[1:00:58] so that was a time when the bride was in
[1:01:00] like a moment of weakness that then she
[1:01:02] began to print the books and really go
[1:01:04] back and listen to the tapes and really
[1:01:06] investigate and start eating the book
[1:01:10] it was god's way
[1:01:12] but it was it felt like it was just in a
[1:01:14] moment of weakness
[1:01:16] he says how be it when he the spirit of
[1:01:18] truth is come
[1:01:20] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:01:22] shall not speak of himself but
[1:01:23] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:01:25] speak and he shall show you things to
[1:01:27] come
[1:01:28] the holy ghost will lead you
[1:01:30] and he'll guide you
[1:01:34] you remember brother went into a factory
[1:01:36] of a machine shop and he talked about
[1:01:38] going in at a certain time the bell
[1:01:40] would ring and all the machinists would
[1:01:41] hang their aprons up and things and a
[1:01:42] big magnet would come across and pick up
[1:01:45] all the shavings
[1:01:46] the holy ghost is like a magnet
[1:01:49] magnet has an unseen force
[1:01:53] and how many as an experiment i remember
[1:01:55] as a kid you know you'd get a magnet you
[1:01:57] put on top of a table
[1:01:59] and you'd get the other magnet and you
[1:02:00] put it underneath the table
[1:02:02] and you would move it around and you
[1:02:04] couldn't see
[1:02:05] the magnet underneath the table if you
[1:02:07] weren't the one holding it
[1:02:08] but yet you could see the effect of the
[1:02:11] magnet on top of the table brochure as
[1:02:13] it would move across
[1:02:15] that's how the holy ghost is
[1:02:18] it leads us and got us and people can't
[1:02:20] see it with their physical eyes but yet
[1:02:22] you can see the movement of it and it
[1:02:23] leads us and it guides us if we'll just
[1:02:25] yield to it
[1:02:28] it'll yield it'll lead you and guide you
[1:02:30] into all truth
[1:02:32] it'll lead you and guides you into what
[1:02:34] job you should get what relationship you
[1:02:36] should be in it will lead you and guide
[1:02:38] you see god is the god of detail
[1:02:42] whenever he created the flowers or or
[1:02:44] things he didn't just say oh all white
[1:02:46] it's a lot easier that way oh they'll
[1:02:48] all just be yellow it's a lot easier
[1:02:49] there he is a he is a master designer
[1:02:53] and he's an incredible decorator and he
[1:02:56] took such care to make sure that that
[1:02:59] this was this color or or the fish or in
[1:03:01] any kind of animal create
[1:03:03] kingdom you want to look into
[1:03:06] he was so careful the mind of god is so
[1:03:08] infinite and if he cares that much about
[1:03:10] his creation how much more does he care
[1:03:12] about you
[1:03:13] to be he cares about every single aspect
[1:03:16] every single hurt you have
[1:03:18] every single concern there may not be
[1:03:20] someone else's concern but whatever lays
[1:03:22] heavy on your heart he cares about he
[1:03:24] cares
[1:03:27] and we're sealed in the hand of god
[1:03:30] we are the bible says that my sheep hear
[1:03:32] my voice this is jesus's own words and i
[1:03:34] know them
[1:03:36] he knows you brother andy
[1:03:39] he knows what your problems are he knows
[1:03:41] what's on your mind he knows what
[1:03:43] bothers you
[1:03:46] he says and i know them and he even
[1:03:48] knows us by name
[1:03:51] you know that would have take a very
[1:03:52] passionate shepherd they're not just my
[1:03:54] sheep
[1:03:56] it's brother davey it's sister cassie
[1:03:59] it's brother jeff he knows his sheep by
[1:04:02] name
[1:04:03] and he knows your name and he knows what
[1:04:05] you're going through and he knows when
[1:04:07] you lay your head on your pillow at
[1:04:08] night what bothers you
[1:04:10] and he says and i give unto them eternal
[1:04:12] life and they shall never perish
[1:04:14] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:04:17] my hand
[1:04:19] my father which gave them me is greater
[1:04:21] than them all and no man is able to
[1:04:23] pluck them out of my father's hand
[1:04:27] satan can't pluck you out of his hand
[1:04:30] amen
[1:04:31] because the holy ghost is our portion of
[1:04:33] god
[1:04:35] it is our inheritance it belongs to us
[1:04:39] when god gives you the holy ghost he's
[1:04:41] literally given you brother matthew a
[1:04:43] part of himself and it belongs to you
[1:04:45] you can't give it to someone else
[1:04:48] you can't you you can't show it to
[1:04:50] someone else necessarily in a physical
[1:04:52] way but yeah it's god's inheritance it's
[1:04:54] god's portion to you
[1:04:56] it's a part of god
[1:04:58] that he gives to you
[1:05:01] and that is why you can never be
[1:05:03] separated from god
[1:05:05] how god cannot be separated from himself
[1:05:07] in fact not only can he not be separated
[1:05:09] he then says to april becomes obligated
[1:05:12] to you because remember god is obligated
[1:05:15] to his word
[1:05:17] and god proves his word well who's who's
[1:05:19] his word
[1:05:21] the bride
[1:05:23] the word made flesh
[1:05:26] and god is obligated
[1:05:28] we as
[1:05:30] us husbands
[1:05:31] we're obligated to our wives
[1:05:35] we are obligated to take care of them
[1:05:38] and to our families and to nurture them
[1:05:40] and to make sure they've got footy
[1:05:42] security shelter all these things that
[1:05:44] is a natural way because you all
[1:05:45] understand that god allows marriage in
[1:05:49] every way in every area and every form
[1:05:51] to express a spiritual truth
[1:05:55] that is the whole purpose
[1:05:58] is that we can experience things in
[1:06:00] marriage or in a family as an example
[1:06:03] and it helps us to understand god
[1:06:05] because god is so far above us we
[1:06:07] understand him sometimes by natural
[1:06:10] things
[1:06:12] we understand whenever we love our
[1:06:14] spouse like we should
[1:06:17] we then get an idea of what it must be
[1:06:19] like for god to love us
[1:06:22] when if
[1:06:24] if god forbid the the situation arises
[1:06:26] where you must provide immediate safety
[1:06:28] to your family
[1:06:30] and even if it doesn't
[1:06:32] lord willing you know you that attribute
[1:06:35] is in you to immediately at all cost
[1:06:37] even if it means your own life you
[1:06:38] protect your family
[1:06:40] it then gives you an idea of god coming
[1:06:44] down and giving his life for his family
[1:06:47] because he refused to be separated from
[1:06:49] you he refused to have you separated
[1:06:52] from him rather
[1:06:54] and the adoption brotherhood says after
[1:06:57] you have died
[1:06:59] after you have passed into that land and
[1:07:01] you're standing there with your loved
[1:07:02] ones you are still filled with the holy
[1:07:05] ghost
[1:07:06] it's yours for eternity
[1:07:08] it is yours he gives it to you and he
[1:07:10] doesn't take it back it is yours it
[1:07:13] belongs to you
[1:07:16] the holy ghost is a way of god himself
[1:07:18] saying that i promise you you're going
[1:07:20] to get a body change
[1:07:24] the holy ghost is god saying i promise
[1:07:27] you you're going to overcome
[1:07:29] well i can't overcome i've got this
[1:07:30] fault i've got that fault i'm just such
[1:07:32] a human i know but he's overcoming in
[1:07:35] you
[1:07:36] that's why that's not that's why it
[1:07:37] takes the holy ghost to have that
[1:07:39] promise
[1:07:40] to overcome
[1:07:43] when you have the holy ghost is god
[1:07:44] promising you're going to see your loved
[1:07:46] ones that have already gone on
[1:07:48] because it's already done it's a seal
[1:07:51] it's finished he said it was finished
[1:07:54] it's already done
[1:07:56] he said brother i'm speaking the church
[1:07:58] book he said now works are fine but they
[1:08:00] don't save you they don't make you
[1:08:01] perfect it's christ or perish
[1:08:05] now this just
[1:08:07] smacks the the modern religion and
[1:08:10] modern christianity right in the face
[1:08:11] and i love it
[1:08:13] because they try and and say you know oh
[1:08:15] there's more than one way to this city
[1:08:17] there's more than one way it's whatever
[1:08:19] no
[1:08:20] there's one way
[1:08:22] there's one way he says it is christ or
[1:08:25] perish it's not even christ and works
[1:08:28] it's christ alone
[1:08:30] he said this age began the years of
[1:08:31] armenianism that did not believe in
[1:08:33] christ as a reality it does not sing of
[1:08:35] nothing but the blood but it sings of
[1:08:37] nothing but the blood and my own conduct
[1:08:39] now i believe in good conduct if you are
[1:08:40] saved you will do righteously we've
[1:08:42] already gone over that but let me tell
[1:08:44] you now salvation is not jesus plus
[1:08:48] it is jesus alone
[1:08:52] salvation is of the lord from start to
[1:08:54] finish it's all god let his life be in
[1:08:56] me let his blood
[1:08:58] let it be his blood that cleanses me let
[1:09:00] it be his spirit that fills me let it be
[1:09:02] his word in my heart and mouth let it be
[1:09:04] his stripes that heal me
[1:09:06] let it be jesus to jesus alone not by
[1:09:08] works of righteousness which i have done
[1:09:10] no sir christ
[1:09:12] in my life
[1:09:16] because if he walked out of the grave
[1:09:19] we're going to walk too
[1:09:21] if the holy ghost that jesus christ had
[1:09:25] walked out of the grave then the holy
[1:09:26] ghost that you have is also going to
[1:09:28] walk out of the grave if the holy ghost
[1:09:30] that he had changed him and gave him a
[1:09:33] new body what's it going to do to you
[1:09:36] it can't do anything different if it's
[1:09:37] the same holy ghost
[1:09:39] so it's already done he's already done
[1:09:41] it he was the first fruits of the
[1:09:43] resurrection what does that mean that
[1:09:44] means he was the first one that raised
[1:09:46] from the dead and then after he raised
[1:09:48] from the dead the old testament saints
[1:09:49] raised with him
[1:09:54] because if he walked out of the grave
[1:09:55] sister tracy
[1:09:57] i'm walking out too
[1:09:59] he ascended up on high 500 people seen
[1:10:01] them we're going to
[1:10:03] because if that same spirit that raised
[1:10:05] christ jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:10:08] it'll also quicken your mortal body
[1:10:10] there's no other way it's finished he's
[1:10:12] already done it well i can't see it
[1:10:15] forget looking through your own humanity
[1:10:18] he's already done it
[1:10:20] he's a christian not me
[1:10:23] he's the christian not you
[1:10:25] but he's living it out through you
[1:10:29] i'm speaking on a body level
[1:10:31] on the soul level we are christians
[1:10:34] but it's him living through us we have
[1:10:36] nothing to bring to him is what i'm
[1:10:37] trying to say
[1:10:39] now we are a triune being
[1:10:42] we're made in the image of god god is
[1:10:44] father son holy ghost
[1:10:47] we're body we're spirit and we're soul
[1:10:50] now as if you can in your own
[1:10:53] understanding
[1:10:55] separate this about yourself
[1:10:58] it will really help you in your
[1:10:59] christian walk
[1:11:01] you have to understand that you're still
[1:11:03] flesh and blood
[1:11:04] that you still have a human spirit
[1:11:07] and then there's a soul in you too
[1:11:09] and your soul is the real you
[1:11:13] the body that we see walk in church
[1:11:15] every weekend
[1:11:18] is the house you live in
[1:11:21] but the soul is the real you now there's
[1:11:25] five senses to our bodies
[1:11:29] i better look down so i all know them
[1:11:31] here see taste
[1:11:33] feel smell and here
[1:11:35] you've got five
[1:11:37] well that's your natural body but your
[1:11:40] human spirit has also got five senses
[1:11:44] and that's reasoning
[1:11:46] memory
[1:11:47] affection
[1:11:49] conscience and imagination
[1:11:53] but in your soul
[1:11:55] there's only two senses
[1:11:57] one or the other should i say there's
[1:11:59] only one sense
[1:12:01] but you the either you're either ruled
[1:12:02] by faith
[1:12:04] or you're ruled by doubt
[1:12:07] so we all as people
[1:12:09] have the same bodily senses we all feel
[1:12:11] the same thing if something if something
[1:12:13] hurt to me more than likely it's going
[1:12:15] to hurt to you
[1:12:16] if you hear something then i'm going to
[1:12:18] hear it
[1:12:20] if if you find something really sad
[1:12:24] more than likely i'm going to find that
[1:12:26] sad because we're humans and we
[1:12:27] sympathize
[1:12:30] but in the soul
[1:12:32] it all depends on who the king of your
[1:12:34] soul is
[1:12:35] on who resides in there
[1:12:38] because in the body and in the spirit is
[1:12:40] where the human dna
[1:12:42] that we take from our parents that's
[1:12:44] where the problem lies
[1:12:47] we get our physical attributes from our
[1:12:49] parents or grandparents or it comes down
[1:12:50] the line in our bodies
[1:12:53] and then in our human spirits is where
[1:12:56] we get the spiritual problems
[1:12:59] from our family dna that's where the
[1:13:01] temper can be
[1:13:03] that's where complexes will be
[1:13:07] that's where hatred or whatever maybe
[1:13:10] that is in that human spirit
[1:13:12] and that is the part though that must be
[1:13:15] overrode
[1:13:17] by the king of the heart
[1:13:19] now it takes a born-again experience
[1:13:23] to keep your other 10 senses in check
[1:13:26] because just because you're
[1:13:27] you're born again on your way to heaven
[1:13:30] but you're still gonna have to fight
[1:13:33] and you still gotta fight them five
[1:13:35] senses
[1:13:36] of the spirit and five senses of the
[1:13:37] body so it's really one against ten
[1:13:41] for the born-again christian it's one
[1:13:43] against ten
[1:13:45] you talk about being tough
[1:13:48] you remember brother ram said that faith
[1:13:49] had
[1:13:50] hair on the chest and big muscles
[1:13:53] i don't get nervous sisters that's
[1:13:54] spiritual
[1:13:58] big muscles
[1:14:00] because you have to fight
[1:14:03] 10 different things at once
[1:14:06] because remember your soul is can get
[1:14:08] born again but your body and your human
[1:14:11] spirit is not born again
[1:14:14] that is why we still get sick
[1:14:17] that is why satan will try and attack
[1:14:19] you with depression and fear and anxiety
[1:14:21] where is that coming from it's coming
[1:14:22] from hell but he can't get to your soul
[1:14:24] because you're sealed
[1:14:26] so he'll attack your human spirit
[1:14:29] and he tries to affect your soul
[1:14:32] through them them avenues
[1:14:35] because remember the greatest battle
[1:14:37] ever fought is in the mind
[1:14:41] now remember
[1:14:42] the mind battles that you're facing
[1:14:46] does not define who you are
[1:14:49] it's what's in the soul that defines who
[1:14:51] you really are it's it's our attitude
[1:14:53] toward the word is what defines who we
[1:14:55] really are
[1:14:57] as the word comes forth
[1:15:00] when we hear the word it don't matter if
[1:15:01] it's through a minister
[1:15:03] it doesn't matter if it's through a tape
[1:15:04] it doesn't matter when we read the bible
[1:15:05] it goes into our minds first
[1:15:09] and the prophet of god said we have free
[1:15:10] moral agency
[1:15:12] to accept it
[1:15:13] or to refuse it
[1:15:16] when the word comes forth and it's uh
[1:15:18] it's even a battle in church because
[1:15:20] what do i mean it's a battle well one
[1:15:22] good example is the word goes forth
[1:15:25] you can be healed in jesus name
[1:15:27] you can be saved in jesus name the holy
[1:15:29] ghost is for you all these promises that
[1:15:31] are constantly spoken and preached but
[1:15:33] satan will come in and say it's not for
[1:15:35] you
[1:15:36] you send away your day of grace
[1:15:38] if you would you know i you thought that
[1:15:41] so now you don't qualify for this it's
[1:15:43] the devil it's a battle
[1:15:46] and it's going on right here
[1:15:49] so when we hear the word preach we're to
[1:15:51] receive the words but it's not to just
[1:15:53] stay here that's called mental faith
[1:15:55] it's not to stay here it is to drop
[1:15:57] within our hearts
[1:15:59] and when it drops within our hearts then
[1:16:01] it becomes a revelation then it becomes
[1:16:03] unshakable then it becomes unmovable
[1:16:09] that's how the word is received
[1:16:12] you receive the word
[1:16:14] by accepting the word
[1:16:16] and not just remember that parable jesus
[1:16:18] said people go out the door and they let
[1:16:20] the fowls of the air come and take it
[1:16:21] they let the chokes of the world choke
[1:16:23] it out it becomes unfruitful but when it
[1:16:26] lands on good ground where's the good
[1:16:27] ground it's in your heart
[1:16:29] that's where the good ground is as long
[1:16:31] as it just stays in our mind that that
[1:16:34] don't scare the devil but let it be in
[1:16:36] your heart
[1:16:38] let it then it becomes a reality and
[1:16:40] then it becomes part of your life
[1:16:42] and then when satan comes and tries to
[1:16:44] attack you through your human spirit
[1:16:45] because remember
[1:16:46] memory
[1:16:47] satan will come back to you
[1:16:50] and he'll try and remind you of what
[1:16:52] you've done
[1:16:53] whenever wherever you are
[1:16:56] but he doesn't tell you he's the one
[1:16:58] that made you do it he was the one that
[1:16:59] was that influenced you rather
[1:17:02] so he'll try and use your memory against
[1:17:05] you
[1:17:06] he'll try and use all of these avenues
[1:17:08] and then bring you in the house of god
[1:17:09] with conviction
[1:17:12] you can't do that you've got to come to
[1:17:14] the house of god saying lord i'm
[1:17:16] justified
[1:17:17] it's as though i've never even done it
[1:17:19] in the first place the blood that was
[1:17:20] years ago that doesn't matter
[1:17:22] but satan will use the memory to affect
[1:17:24] he'll be trying to use your memory or
[1:17:26] trying to use your imagination or
[1:17:27] anything those are see
[1:17:29] the god created them senses of the
[1:17:31] spirit
[1:17:33] but as soon as they cross the word
[1:17:37] you rebuke them
[1:17:39] you say you're prayed for and you
[1:17:41] believe that god's going to heal you and
[1:17:42] it's a revelation in your heart but yet
[1:17:44] you can still feel the pain
[1:17:46] pain is real
[1:17:48] and it takes some faith to be there and
[1:17:50] be hurting so bad
[1:17:53] but yet god's word says that you're
[1:17:55] healed
[1:17:58] you feel it your natural sense fills it
[1:18:01] that's a battle
[1:18:04] but god put something in you to overcome
[1:18:06] that
[1:18:09] because satan works on these senses
[1:18:12] and he works on every single christian
[1:18:16] and he'll come on them inlets and he'll
[1:18:17] try and attack you like i said with
[1:18:18] depression
[1:18:20] just out of nowhere he'll try and attack
[1:18:21] you with fear and anxiety like what in
[1:18:23] the world's going on
[1:18:25] but you have something on this on the
[1:18:27] throne room
[1:18:29] you've got something in your soul that
[1:18:30] can rise above and say get thee behind
[1:18:32] me satan
[1:18:34] that's not me that's not my thought
[1:18:36] that's not my reasoning
[1:18:38] that's not me
[1:18:41] i'm sealed
[1:18:43] and satan is jealous that he can't get
[1:18:44] in there
[1:18:46] he can't touch you
[1:18:50] but he tries to get you to doubt your
[1:18:51] position and keep you leaving a defeated
[1:18:53] life it's not god's will for you to live
[1:18:55] a defeated life it's not god's will for
[1:18:57] you to feel defeated
[1:19:01] because remember the holy ghost in a
[1:19:03] believer's soul is just as eternal
[1:19:06] as god is because it is god
[1:19:09] your flesh our flesh has an end our
[1:19:11] human spirit has an end but the holy
[1:19:14] ghost in you never had a beginning so we
[1:19:16] can never have an end because remember
[1:19:18] it's zoe
[1:19:20] it's god's own life
[1:19:23] that is why the entire christian
[1:19:25] principle
[1:19:27] is based on rest
[1:19:33] different denominations they believe
[1:19:34] that the evidence of the holy ghost is
[1:19:36] keeping at the sabbath day
[1:19:39] god's rest
[1:19:41] the holy ghost is our rest
[1:19:43] because we now have quit trying we've
[1:19:46] quit it's not him it's not it's not i
[1:19:48] that live but it's he that liveth in me
[1:19:50] ain't that what jesus said that's the
[1:19:52] testimony of the bride
[1:19:56] you as a christian i as a christian
[1:19:59] you as a christian
[1:20:01] can do anything you want
[1:20:04] do you know that
[1:20:06] he said bless god i'm gonna go get drunk
[1:20:08] then
[1:20:11] christian
[1:20:12] you're not a christian
[1:20:16] because as a christian be very careful
[1:20:19] here for the record
[1:20:22] i'm calling the prophet if you don't
[1:20:23] realize that
[1:20:25] he said i can do anything i want.
[1:20:30] so if you have the holy ghost you don't
[1:20:32] want to get drunk
[1:20:34] if you have the holy ghost you don't
[1:20:36] want to tell a lie you don't want to sin
[1:20:39] you want to do what's right
[1:20:41] so you do what you want
[1:20:43] if you feel
[1:20:44] bound then you're being religious
[1:20:48] there's freedom in the holy ghost
[1:20:52] there's freedom
[1:20:53] you do what you want
[1:20:56] you don't have to be arrested for it
[1:21:00] unless a real maybe day of pentecost
[1:21:01] breaks out and
[1:21:03] they arrested them
[1:21:05] but you understand what i'm saying as a
[1:21:07] christian you can do anything you want
[1:21:09] because nothing you desire to do is
[1:21:11] going to be out of here
[1:21:13] out of the bounds of here it's all going
[1:21:15] to be in here
[1:21:19] you know
[1:21:20] when they when the flesh and human
[1:21:22] spirit drop away
[1:21:24] this is a very serious subject here
[1:21:27] only the soul is what appears before god
[1:21:30] so what you have is you have people
[1:21:33] remember brother adam told the story
[1:21:34] about daniel greene
[1:21:36] he had a dream
[1:21:37] he was an evangelist on the earth and he
[1:21:39] won people to jesus christ
[1:21:41] and he dreamed that he died
[1:21:43] and he had approached the throne and
[1:21:45] everything and they couldn't find his
[1:21:46] name on the role and they sent him to
[1:21:47] the to the throne of judgment judgment
[1:21:50] throne now this is just a dream
[1:21:52] and he said that
[1:21:55] the voice that was speaking to him in
[1:21:56] this light he approached his life and he
[1:21:58] said the voice that was speaking to him
[1:22:00] said daniel greene
[1:22:03] did you ever lie
[1:22:06] and daniel green in his mind he said he
[1:22:08] thought he was a good fellow and he
[1:22:10] never lied but he said in the presence
[1:22:12] of that light
[1:22:14] he remembered some things that he said
[1:22:16] that weren't just right
[1:22:18] and he had no choice but to tell the
[1:22:20] truth
[1:22:21] because he knew that light knew
[1:22:24] he said yeah lord
[1:22:26] i did
[1:22:27] and then that voice came out and said
[1:22:28] did you ever steal
[1:22:32] and he said i thought i was an honest
[1:22:33] man
[1:22:34] he said but in the presence of that
[1:22:36] light i remember pulling some deals that
[1:22:37] just weren't quite right
[1:22:40] and he had no choice but to tell the
[1:22:41] truth
[1:22:42] so he said yes lord
[1:22:44] i did
[1:22:45] and remember he said that right when he
[1:22:47] expected to hear a boom and voice they
[1:22:48] depart into
[1:22:50] everlasting punishment he said he felt a
[1:22:52] hand come on his shoulder
[1:22:55] and he said lord and it was the face of
[1:22:56] jesus and he said
[1:22:58] it's true though daniel green did some
[1:23:00] things that that weren't right he
[1:23:01] said but daniel green also stood for me
[1:23:07] so what we take away from that is that
[1:23:09] the mental senses
[1:23:11] when they see reasoning
[1:23:13] you remember the story of that woman
[1:23:14] that brother bran tells
[1:23:16] and she was in in the church i don't
[1:23:18] remember if it was his or not but she
[1:23:19] did she did some things and went and got
[1:23:21] remarried and and did some things and
[1:23:23] went and took a very horrible
[1:23:25] road
[1:23:27] and brother were trying to reach out to
[1:23:28] her and she just
[1:23:30] refused it and said some blasphemous
[1:23:32] things
[1:23:33] and she went and joined some
[1:23:34] denominational church and she was told
[1:23:36] she was okay and on her way to heaven
[1:23:37] and she was a sunday school teacher and
[1:23:38] she had all
[1:23:40] this sin on her that she wouldn't repent
[1:23:41] of
[1:23:42] well a venero disease caught up with her
[1:23:44] because of the way that she was living
[1:23:47] and on her deathbed
[1:23:49] her mental faculties begin to kind of
[1:23:51] break up
[1:23:53] all the reasoning all all the senses of
[1:23:56] her spirit all the fronts that she had
[1:23:57] well i'm okay because my pastor said i'm
[1:24:00] okay because of this i'm okay because of
[1:24:01] this the mental faculties began to break
[1:24:03] apart
[1:24:04] and when the mental faculties began to
[1:24:06] break apart she then seen herself as a
[1:24:09] soul before god
[1:24:12] and then she realized that she was lost
[1:24:17] her soul brother ram said caught up with
[1:24:19] her see she was meeting god on the
[1:24:21] condition of her soul not her body or or
[1:24:25] or the pastor patting her on the back
[1:24:26] telling her what a good person she was
[1:24:28] she was meeting god on the basis of her
[1:24:31] soul
[1:24:32] and she realized she was lost
[1:24:35] and when they called the pastor in
[1:24:38] he kept encouraging her encouraging the
[1:24:39] doctors to keep pumping her full of
[1:24:41] painkillers and things and she died with
[1:24:43] saying i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost
[1:24:46] because the mental faculties begin to
[1:24:48] break apart
[1:24:49] and you have all these atheists and
[1:24:51] people that have left the message that
[1:24:52] are fighting the message
[1:24:54] right now they've got reasoning they've
[1:24:56] got they've got the mental faculties but
[1:24:57] wait till they start breaking apart wait
[1:24:59] before they've got to meet god as a soul
[1:25:02] in the presence of that light
[1:25:04] wait before they have to answer in the
[1:25:07] presence of that light and they can't
[1:25:08] deny it
[1:25:13] no matter what happens though
[1:25:15] now here's the wonderful rest that we
[1:25:18] have as believers
[1:25:21] because the holy ghost is a seal and our
[1:25:22] soul is sealed sometimes satan is very
[1:25:25] vicious and sometimes when people start
[1:25:27] slipping away and it's their time their
[1:25:29] mind will start slipping
[1:25:31] their bodies start slipping
[1:25:33] but yet no matter what they may think in
[1:25:35] their minds and all of a sudden just
[1:25:37] start slipping
[1:25:39] their soul is sealed
[1:25:42] it doesn't matter
[1:25:44] it doesn't matter if satan starts
[1:25:46] attacking them right he's got a punch
[1:25:47] coming
[1:25:49] so if on someone's death they begin to
[1:25:51] just really just all of a sudden
[1:25:54] start really slipping in their mind as i
[1:25:56] said and maybe sometimes people can even
[1:25:58] say harsh things it's their soul is once
[1:26:01] it's sealed it's sealed god don't take
[1:26:03] the holy ghost back
[1:26:06] because god god's uh covenant is
[1:26:08] unconditional
[1:26:14] aren't you glad to be serving a god
[1:26:15] that's unconditional
[1:26:17] no matter in your bad moods and your
[1:26:18] good moods and your because again back
[1:26:20] to the senses
[1:26:22] you're not going to feel saved every day
[1:26:25] you're not going to feel like jumping up
[1:26:26] and down every single day you're not
[1:26:28] going to feel like praising god every
[1:26:30] single day
[1:26:32] but yet
[1:26:34] in the midst of the storm
[1:26:36] the soul which is the boss takes control
[1:26:40] and you praise him in the middle of your
[1:26:42] storm when satan makes you feel like
[1:26:43] you're just the worst sinner in the city
[1:26:45] you say satan i don't care i have the
[1:26:47] holy ghost and i'm gonna believe what
[1:26:49] god's word says about me not what my
[1:26:51] mood says which comes and goes not what
[1:26:54] other people say it's what your word
[1:26:56] says about me that is our anchor despite
[1:26:59] of what your emotions go because your
[1:27:01] emotions can go in any which way
[1:27:04] how you feel may go in any which way it
[1:27:06] can go in any direction amen
[1:27:10] the prophet of god didn't said he didn't
[1:27:11] feel saved every day
[1:27:14] it's not how you feel
[1:27:16] we take the basis of what he said
[1:27:20] you say oh i'm you you know we're in
[1:27:22] church and we're praising the lord i
[1:27:23] don't
[1:27:25] i really don't feel like raising my
[1:27:26] hands raise them anyway
[1:27:28] that's not being hypocrite that's not
[1:27:30] being hypocritical that's saying flesh
[1:27:32] you're gonna get in line you don't feel
[1:27:34] like it
[1:27:36] but i'm gonna praise the lord anyway
[1:27:39] i don't you're satan is trying to make
[1:27:41] me feel like i don't feel like singing
[1:27:42] but i'm gonna sing anyway why because
[1:27:44] there's a boss on the throne room of
[1:27:46] your heart that gets your body under
[1:27:47] subjection
[1:27:50] that makes you that makes you brothers
[1:27:52] us brothers turn our heads
[1:27:55] that makes us sisters
[1:27:57] watch not watch the the wrong thing on
[1:27:59] the internet not post the wrong thing on
[1:28:00] facebook or whatever it may be
[1:28:03] because you've got you've got somebody
[1:28:05] on your throne that brings your body
[1:28:07] under subjection
[1:28:09] when you in your body you may feel like
[1:28:11] doing something you may not feel like
[1:28:13] doing something but your your soul takes
[1:28:16] preeminence
[1:28:18] and brings the body under subjection
[1:28:23] when somebody cuts you off and you just
[1:28:25] ready to go for that horn
[1:28:28] it's okay it was there for a reason
[1:28:32] but we bring our bodies under subjection
[1:28:35] we bring our human spirit under
[1:28:36] subjection
[1:28:39] you feel like flying off the handle
[1:28:40] because something just really upset you
[1:28:43] bring that spirit under subjection amen
[1:28:45] bring it under subjection
[1:28:47] god equipped you for that
[1:28:50] but god makes his covenant unconditional
[1:28:54] brother graham teaches us about abraham
[1:28:57] he made an unconditional covenant with
[1:28:59] abraham
[1:29:01] and then he goes and he tells the story
[1:29:03] about how when abraham went and abraham
[1:29:06] asked god to confirm the covenant there
[1:29:07] and he he told them to what animals to
[1:29:10] take and how to divide them apart and to
[1:29:12] and then the pillar of fire went between
[1:29:14] the animals you remember you can find
[1:29:15] that in genesis 15.
[1:29:17] and god made this covenant with abraham
[1:29:18] unconditional
[1:29:20] and brother bran then comes along and he
[1:29:21] brings about how on the orientals about
[1:29:23] how they would make a covenant
[1:29:25] and how they would stand between these
[1:29:26] dead beasts and they said they'd make an
[1:29:27] agreement they'd make a sacrifice and to
[1:29:29] tear the beast apart and they're divided
[1:29:31] and they said let our bodies be as this
[1:29:33] beast if we don't keep that was a
[1:29:34] serious
[1:29:36] covenant then brother tells us a story
[1:29:39] about the chinese laundry men when they
[1:29:40] would come and they came to america and
[1:29:42] they couldn't couldn't read or couldn't
[1:29:44] write and so all they knew but they were
[1:29:45] great at laundry
[1:29:47] so all they could do is they'd rip the
[1:29:48] paper in a certain way and that's how
[1:29:50] you'd go pick up your laundry
[1:29:52] brother brand picks that up
[1:29:54] and he says because jesus christ is our
[1:29:56] unconditional covenant
[1:29:58] jesus christ is our relation to god
[1:30:02] and god's relation to us
[1:30:04] jesus was torn apart
[1:30:08] on calvary
[1:30:10] his body went to heaven and his spirit
[1:30:13] came back on the earth
[1:30:16] came back to the church on the day of
[1:30:18] pentecost picks that up he says watch
[1:30:21] god was then in spirit how could god be
[1:30:24] tore apart
[1:30:25] but one day god was made flesh and dwelt
[1:30:28] among us the lord jesus christ the
[1:30:29] emmanuel and then there at calvary the
[1:30:32] covenant god wrote with us he took the
[1:30:35] christ to calvary and tore
[1:30:38] him apart
[1:30:40] soul embody
[1:30:42] and he took up his body and set it at
[1:30:44] the right hand of his majesty and sent
[1:30:46] the spirit back on earth to make a
[1:30:47] covenant
[1:30:48] to carry out the gospel
[1:30:51] and the same dovetail power that jesus
[1:30:53] christ had he's the same yesterday today
[1:30:56] and forever and the church is given a
[1:30:58] covenant and the covenant is the baptism
[1:31:01] of the holy ghost which is the seed of
[1:31:04] abraham
[1:31:05] bring him to us
[1:31:08] then god making this covenant that every
[1:31:10] man that's called into the grace of god
[1:31:13] by the holy ghost has the same promise
[1:31:16] that abraham had
[1:31:19] of eternal life
[1:31:21] i made this a little illustration
[1:31:25] of a covenant
[1:31:27] this is like jesus christ
[1:31:30] and he's on the earth
[1:31:32] and the bible says that all the fullness
[1:31:34] of the god godhead bodily dwelt in him
[1:31:37] he was god from beginning
[1:31:39] to end
[1:31:41] and evermore
[1:31:43] he was not one spec human in on that
[1:31:46] level he became flesh to experience the
[1:31:48] things that we experience
[1:31:50] he became a man because it takes a man a
[1:31:52] kinsmen redeemer had to purchase our
[1:31:55] salvation a kinsmen redeemer had to shed
[1:31:58] his blood when melchizedek came
[1:32:01] to abraham he spoke that body in
[1:32:03] existence and he spoke that body out of
[1:32:05] existence
[1:32:07] but melchizedek didn't come in that form
[1:32:10] to give his life for us
[1:32:12] he came to confirm the covenant to
[1:32:14] abraham and he did his work and god just
[1:32:16] breathed that body he stepped in the
[1:32:18] angels did it breathed and it was gone
[1:32:20] but with jesus he became a man
[1:32:24] he came and he was born in a nasty barn
[1:32:28] he was a super sign he came to
[1:32:30] experience the disappointment he came to
[1:32:33] experience the loss of his best friend
[1:32:35] he came to experience sickness he came
[1:32:36] to experience a headache he came to
[1:32:38] experience all them things
[1:32:41] so he fulfilled his work
[1:32:43] and when he fulfilled his work just like
[1:32:45] abraham was abraham took them sacrifices
[1:32:48] and and tore them apart and
[1:32:50] we just read the quote what brother adam
[1:32:51] said about jesus when he when they
[1:32:53] nailed him to a cross they then whenever
[1:32:55] he whenever they stuck that spirit in
[1:32:57] his side and he said it is finished god
[1:33:00] tore his covenant
[1:33:02] god tore his covenant apart and you see
[1:33:04] how
[1:33:06] that says jesus but when he tear it
[1:33:07] apart
[1:33:09] it takes two to make him
[1:33:12] so his body went up and is on the right
[1:33:14] hand of the father but on the day of
[1:33:16] pentecost he sent his spirit
[1:33:19] the holy ghost
[1:33:21] in the believer in the individual and it
[1:33:24] is to indwell us
[1:33:26] because remember he said now i'm with
[1:33:28] you
[1:33:30] but he said i'm gonna be in you
[1:33:34] so when and people wonder how jesus
[1:33:36] prayed to himself
[1:33:39] well if you have this on the inside of
[1:33:40] you how do you pray to him
[1:33:45] so the holy ghost-filled believer is
[1:33:47] walking around with this brother danny
[1:33:49] they have the covenant
[1:33:51] they've got the other half
[1:33:53] they've got everything that he had
[1:33:56] they've got
[1:33:58] let's see i ran out of room with the
[1:34:00] things to write on here
[1:34:02] joy it's in you
[1:34:06] faith
[1:34:07] it's there
[1:34:08] it's not far off
[1:34:10] it's in you
[1:34:12] but as long as satan can keep just
[1:34:13] throwing something over it throwing
[1:34:15] something over and trying and trying to
[1:34:16] keep it snuff snuffed out and you're not
[1:34:18] living up to your potential you're not
[1:34:20] living to to where you're called to live
[1:34:24] he's trying to throw dirt on you
[1:34:27] a sound mind
[1:34:30] in this mind age we need a sound mind
[1:34:35] people are crazy
[1:34:38] and i i i'm not saying that in the wrong
[1:34:40] way but they are hell has come up
[1:34:45] we went into uh i don't mean to get off
[1:34:47] on this
[1:34:48] but we went to walmart the other day for
[1:34:51] the first time in
[1:34:52] a long time i actually physically go in
[1:34:55] i don't recommend it
[1:34:58] i i don't recommend it they don't have a
[1:35:01] sound mind
[1:35:03] but god has promised this to you
[1:35:07] i think there was more colored hair in
[1:35:08] there than there is on on that color
[1:35:10] wheel or something
[1:35:12] or maybe they each have their own color
[1:35:13] wheel i'm not sure
[1:35:16] but
[1:35:17] you've got peace
[1:35:19] you've got a sound mind you know that
[1:35:21] could be us if it wasn't for the grace
[1:35:23] of god i'm not trying to say that our
[1:35:25] flesh is so we're better than them no
[1:35:26] it's it's praise be to god
[1:35:30] it's praise god it's sad it's you know
[1:35:33] it's that way because they rejected this
[1:35:35] message it's that way because they
[1:35:37] rejected the word that's why we have the
[1:35:39] solution
[1:35:41] and god help us to be a light and we
[1:35:43] will gladly witness to anyone of the
[1:35:46] hope that lies within us
[1:35:48] i'm just trying to make the point of how
[1:35:49] dark it is out there but he you've got a
[1:35:51] sound mind it's in the holy ghost for
[1:35:53] you healing is there overcoming power
[1:35:57] love meekness gentleness long suffering
[1:35:59] temperance temperance goodness
[1:36:02] your body change
[1:36:05] it's all in here the resurrection
[1:36:06] because remember as they sang that
[1:36:08] wonderful song if he walked out of the
[1:36:10] grave with this
[1:36:12] then if i've got part of it and you've
[1:36:14] got part of it then you're walking out
[1:36:16] too
[1:36:18] because you're a part of him
[1:36:21] this this looks weird by itself don't it
[1:36:24] this don't look complete
[1:36:26] he's not complete without you
[1:36:29] because you're holding the other half
[1:36:32] so whenever you put the two together
[1:36:36] look how
[1:36:37] look how great that is
[1:36:40] not my artwork but look how wonderful
[1:36:43] him coming together we're
[1:36:46] bone of his bone we're flesh of his
[1:36:48] flesh we're spirit of a spirit if that
[1:36:50] same spirit same one it's not some third
[1:36:53] person or some second person it's the
[1:36:55] person of jesus christ living in you
[1:36:57] then sister caitlin you can overcome
[1:36:59] every devil that he did
[1:37:01] saints you were fighting the same devil
[1:37:05] you can overcome the same devil you can
[1:37:07] have the same authority
[1:37:09] because remember if one spoonful of the
[1:37:11] ocean
[1:37:13] is the same chemical that's in the rest
[1:37:14] of the ocean
[1:37:16] and you hold the other one so when the
[1:37:17] great magnet of the holy ghost comes
[1:37:19] over on resurrection morning and every
[1:37:21] person that was buried that went into
[1:37:23] the grave holding this
[1:37:27] now they're in their theophany they're
[1:37:28] on the other side
[1:37:30] but for the sake of illustration when
[1:37:32] that great magnet comes over there's
[1:37:33] gonna be a resurrection
[1:37:36] because it fits
[1:37:37] because the same life that was in him
[1:37:40] was in them it's still in them because
[1:37:42] remember there are loved ones that have
[1:37:44] already passed over they're enjoying the
[1:37:45] blessings of god they're enjoying the
[1:37:47] fruits of their labor they're enjoying
[1:37:49] the fruits of the battle
[1:37:51] they're enjoying the spoils of war if
[1:37:53] you will
[1:37:54] that's not sacrilegious to say they're
[1:37:56] enjoying that now
[1:37:58] so when they on resurrection morning
[1:38:00] they're gonna rise up and they're going
[1:38:01] to meet it and it's going to be a
[1:38:03] dovetail
[1:38:05] i'm not a carpenter whatsoever but
[1:38:07] dovetail from my understanding on
[1:38:09] cabinets or any on on furniture whenever
[1:38:12] it fits a joint
[1:38:14] and that's how this fits
[1:38:17] your the spirit that's in you not your
[1:38:19] human spirit now remember this is on the
[1:38:21] level of the soul around this you got
[1:38:24] the five senses of your human spirit
[1:38:25] which is
[1:38:26] can be sticky
[1:38:28] you've got the five senses of your
[1:38:29] mortal body
[1:38:31] which will try and your own body your
[1:38:34] own human spirit will try and challenge
[1:38:36] you
[1:38:37] on what on this
[1:38:41] but that is where the soul
[1:38:43] is able that is where the holy ghost on
[1:38:46] the inside of you is able to overcome
[1:38:47] all ten senses
[1:38:49] if if the sight agrees with it bless god
[1:38:51] god gave us sight god gave us all these
[1:38:53] senses
[1:38:55] but see it's not redeemed yet so satan
[1:38:57] enters that's his channels that's how he
[1:39:00] tries to come and fight us is through
[1:39:02] our mortal senses
[1:39:04] but we hold the covenant
[1:39:07] that is why
[1:39:09] every person with the holy ghost has
[1:39:11] this within them
[1:39:14] the bride collectively has this
[1:39:17] so when the bride collectively as a
[1:39:19] whole those that are resurrected those
[1:39:21] that are alive and remain whenever she
[1:39:23] ascends because remember going to meet
[1:39:25] him in the air it's going to be a
[1:39:28] perfect fit
[1:39:30] the ministry that jesus had when he was
[1:39:33] on the earth and he met the woman at the
[1:39:34] well
[1:39:35] countless other ones when he went and he
[1:39:37] would cast out evil spirits when he
[1:39:39] would heal the sick when he would raise
[1:39:41] the dead he did all them works
[1:39:43] you can we read it in our bibles and we
[1:39:45] believe every one of them
[1:39:47] whenever he ascended upon high and he
[1:39:48] sent the holy ghost them disciples and
[1:39:50] apostles that had this in them did the
[1:39:53] exact same works
[1:39:56] whenever god sent a prophet
[1:39:58] with the ministry
[1:40:00] of jesus christ the son of man ministry
[1:40:04] he did the exact same thing with this
[1:40:05] part
[1:40:08] in fact he said that god did more
[1:40:10] through his ministry than eve was even
[1:40:11] recorded in the bible
[1:40:14] so it's the same
[1:40:16] ministry
[1:40:18] these signs shall follow them that
[1:40:20] believe
[1:40:21] my name they shall cast out devils if he
[1:40:23] did it you can do it
[1:40:27] the works that i do shall
[1:40:29] you do also with this
[1:40:33] this isn't half the power this is the
[1:40:36] same power but just
[1:40:38] in a smaller form
[1:40:40] it's the same amount you've got just as
[1:40:42] much you've got authority over the devil
[1:40:46] because you hold this you hold
[1:40:48] that's your covenant and that belongs to
[1:40:50] you and no matter what that will always
[1:40:52] be yours brother vernon that will always
[1:40:54] belong to you god don't say okay you're
[1:40:56] done you made a mistake i'm taking this
[1:40:58] back no he gave it to you he sealed you
[1:41:01] with it this is your seal and it will
[1:41:03] take you through this life's journey
[1:41:07] your body change everything is in this
[1:41:14] because she
[1:41:16] is him
[1:41:18] he says if it does something different
[1:41:20] from the groom it isn't the bride
[1:41:21] because she's flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:41:23] his bone life of his life power of his
[1:41:26] power she
[1:41:28] is
[1:41:29] him
[1:41:32] you're miss
[1:41:33] jesus christ
[1:41:37] whenever you go to the altar and you get
[1:41:39] married
[1:41:40] and they pronounce you mr and mrs so and
[1:41:43] so
[1:41:45] and the bride takes on the name of the
[1:41:47] love of her life
[1:41:49] she beams with joy she beams with beauty
[1:41:52] she beams with gladness
[1:41:54] because all of her hopes
[1:41:56] she's put in this man
[1:41:59] all of her trust
[1:42:01] she's put in this man
[1:42:03] all of her confidence and her future and
[1:42:05] family and and being provided for and
[1:42:08] security she's put in this man
[1:42:11] that's how the bride is
[1:42:14] that's why we should be the happiest
[1:42:15] people on earth because everything we
[1:42:17] have need of he's taken care of it's him
[1:42:19] he's living the word through you you
[1:42:21] can't live this word within yourself you
[1:42:23] can't be a christian by yourself
[1:42:26] you keep falling you keep falling you
[1:42:27] keep trying you keep trying
[1:42:29] it takes him
[1:42:32] you say i've got the holy ghost and i
[1:42:33] still make mistakes yeah we all do
[1:42:36] but this will pick you back up
[1:42:39] this right here will say lord i'm sorry
[1:42:42] i did not mean to do that
[1:42:44] just don't let the devil make you think
[1:42:47] his thoughts are your thoughts
[1:42:50] don't let him do that because he loves
[1:42:51] doing that he loves whispering behind
[1:42:54] your ear and and and giving you the
[1:42:56] wrong idea or giving you the wrong
[1:42:57] thoughts making you reason or whatever
[1:42:59] and then coming up front and saying
[1:43:01] you're just an awful person
[1:43:03] i can't believe you just thought that i
[1:43:06] can't believe that you were reasoning
[1:43:07] that and you call yourself a christian
[1:43:09] and he'll go back behind you and start
[1:43:11] whispering in your ear
[1:43:13] and it's the same devil that gave you
[1:43:15] the thought that's then accusing you
[1:43:18] you talk about a devil
[1:43:26] but we serve a god that can deliver
[1:43:30] the holy ghost is vital and i'm gonna
[1:43:32] try and bring this to a close but the
[1:43:33] holy ghost is vital
[1:43:36] jesus said you must be born again
[1:43:39] you've got to it's not i should it'd be
[1:43:41] a good idea to make my life easier to
[1:43:42] make my parents like me more and make my
[1:43:44] wife like me more my husband no you must
[1:43:46] be born again
[1:43:49] you must
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:51] say how do i know if i have the holy
[1:43:53] ghost let's cover that how do i know
[1:43:55] that i have the holy ghost in second
[1:43:57] corinthians 5 17
[1:43:59] paul said therefore if any man be in
[1:44:01] christ
[1:44:02] he is a new creature
[1:44:04] old things are passed away behold all
[1:44:06] things are becoming new now this is not
[1:44:08] sanctification this is not just god
[1:44:10] cleansing you and that's a work of grace
[1:44:12] but see whenever you're trusting god for
[1:44:14] the holy ghost and he justifies you and
[1:44:16] then god sanctifies you whenever in the
[1:44:18] middle of your week don't get your mind
[1:44:20] on the things of the world and we all
[1:44:21] have things we have to do but don't go
[1:44:23] out and left field and expect to just
[1:44:25] live from week in a weekend stay in the
[1:44:27] atmosphere
[1:44:29] of the holy ghost stay in the atmosphere
[1:44:32] of the word
[1:44:33] and then god will draw near to you
[1:44:36] because whenever god accepts your faith
[1:44:39] god is obligated to give you the holy
[1:44:41] ghost
[1:44:43] he's obligated because god is obligated
[1:44:45] to his word
[1:44:48] says
[1:44:49] that so there is a genuine evidence of
[1:44:51] the holy ghost he's never told me
[1:44:52] anything wrong yet that is it is the
[1:44:55] evidence of the holy ghost is he who can
[1:44:57] believe the word you can receive it
[1:45:00] now there's a difference between just
[1:45:02] believing it there's lots of people with
[1:45:04] a with with a beer bottle on their hands
[1:45:06] that look at the message and say
[1:45:08] i can't live it that's the truth
[1:45:12] a cigarette in their hands i can't live
[1:45:14] it but that's that that's the truth
[1:45:17] i believe that brother brown was a
[1:45:18] prophet
[1:45:20] that's not receiving the word
[1:45:22] that's not even hearing the word
[1:45:25] hearing means to understand so whenever
[1:45:27] the word when you have the holy ghost
[1:45:28] the word comes to you brother stephen it
[1:45:31] comes to you it finds you
[1:45:33] just like that mama eagle went searching
[1:45:35] for that egg that she laid and it finds
[1:45:37] you and you're able to receive the word
[1:45:39] and when you receive the word it then
[1:45:41] lives through
[1:45:43] you
[1:45:45] because you receive it on the level of
[1:45:46] your soul and then all of a sudden
[1:45:48] you're not trying to work from the
[1:45:49] outside in you're not trying to to to
[1:45:51] get sober and and go to alcoholics
[1:45:54] anonymous or go here or go there and
[1:45:56] read and once i get to this stage it's
[1:45:58] not that's religion
[1:46:00] that's just on the level of the human
[1:46:01] spirit but you receive the word in your
[1:46:03] soul and it will change you you receive
[1:46:06] the word in your soul and then it begins
[1:46:07] to push out into your human spirit
[1:46:10] and then it begins to push out in your
[1:46:11] body then your body does line up with
[1:46:13] the word
[1:46:15] then it's not so hard for for ladies to
[1:46:18] to lay down pants or or men to to wear
[1:46:20] pants for men to wear pants and for
[1:46:22] ladies to wear dresses it's not hard
[1:46:23] because then they receive the word in
[1:46:25] their souls and it begins to push out
[1:46:30] but we don't but
[1:46:31] if there was someone here that walked in
[1:46:33] off the street and and and a woman had
[1:46:35] pants we wouldn't be up here you should
[1:46:37] be ashamed of yourself you should be
[1:46:38] ashamed of yourself we would try and
[1:46:40] introduce her to jesus christ and let
[1:46:42] him do it he'll teach her he'll bring
[1:46:44] her on if there's a new birth it will
[1:46:46] come about to be it will come to be
[1:46:49] we don't sit here we're not religious
[1:46:53] we want to we're
[1:46:55] you know we want to introduce people to
[1:46:57] jesus christ fall in love with jesus
[1:47:00] fall in love with his word and all these
[1:47:02] other things will be added unto you
[1:47:04] the same can apply to doctrine don't get
[1:47:06] so overwhelmed and oh i don't understand
[1:47:09] the 70 weeks i don't understand the
[1:47:11] thunder let the word is simple it's man
[1:47:14] that complicates things
[1:47:16] so the bible said that he'd lead you and
[1:47:18] guide you into all truth
[1:47:21] so we
[1:47:22] introduce people to jesus christ
[1:47:25] he is the word i promise you when that
[1:47:28] born again when that new birth takes
[1:47:30] place in the soul
[1:47:32] it'll take care of everything else
[1:47:34] it's not stop doing this stop doing that
[1:47:36] stop doing that it's not religion it's
[1:47:38] not commandments
[1:47:41] that's not how god runs this house
[1:47:45] what did jesus say if you love me you'll
[1:47:47] keep my commandments
[1:47:51] if
[1:47:52] this sounds silly but if if god's
[1:47:54] requirement is that we stand in our head
[1:47:55] for the holy ghost there'd be some head
[1:47:57] standing
[1:47:59] you know as an example if god if god
[1:48:01] would require us to do something on
[1:48:03] being extreme
[1:48:04] to make you to get us to understand that
[1:48:06] it's whatever god wants i'll do
[1:48:10] if he said be baptized in the name of
[1:48:11] the lord jesus christ that's what we'll
[1:48:12] do because that's what he said
[1:48:17] because we love him
[1:48:22] he said brother i'm saying a think of
[1:48:24] man's filter now if you want the
[1:48:25] evidence of the holy ghost there it is
[1:48:27] when that soul of yours will line up
[1:48:29] with the word of god in every respect it
[1:48:32] shows that you've drawled your life
[1:48:33] through the think commands filter
[1:48:35] god's filter
[1:48:38] when we hear the word and we see and
[1:48:40] that's why we come to church one of the
[1:48:41] reasons is to see where we fall short
[1:48:44] and the minister gets up on the pulpit
[1:48:45] and god anoints him and he's preaching
[1:48:47] he's speaking and you realize lord
[1:48:50] i i don't pray as often as i should
[1:48:53] you know or or man i haven't been like i
[1:48:55] should be
[1:48:58] god uses that and we go and we say lord
[1:49:01] help me with this
[1:49:03] i realize that i'm actually not quite
[1:49:05] i'm you know i'm still a christian
[1:49:09] but i'm not quite where i should be
[1:49:11] i need to come up a step higher i need a
[1:49:13] fresh revival in my home or where i need
[1:49:16] a fresh revival in my own life or
[1:49:17] whatever it is
[1:49:20] that's lining up with the word
[1:49:22] because if you have growth that shows
[1:49:24] there's life
[1:49:26] before you can have growth you've got to
[1:49:27] have life
[1:49:29] because remember
[1:49:31] grace is what god did for us
[1:49:34] and works is what we do for him
[1:49:37] that's why we don't works is wonderful
[1:49:39] paying people's hospital bills or or
[1:49:41] donating or doing this and that that's
[1:49:43] just in the human spirit that doesn't
[1:49:44] merit salvation
[1:49:46] there's not one thing we can do to merit
[1:49:48] salvation
[1:49:51] remember paul said though i give my body
[1:49:52] to be burned as a sacrifice and all
[1:49:54] these things and though i have not
[1:49:55] charity i'm nothing that's right
[1:49:58] christians do them things but that's not
[1:50:00] how you merit salvation you marry you
[1:50:02] can't merit salvation you receive
[1:50:04] salvation by accepting it see how simple
[1:50:06] that is
[1:50:08] people you think of all the millions of
[1:50:09] dollars that people spend and
[1:50:10] organizations and churches spend
[1:50:12] to try and merit something
[1:50:15] amen the only way we'll ever get to
[1:50:17] heaven is because of what he's done for
[1:50:19] us
[1:50:20] and our faith in that
[1:50:22] remember god abraham believed god
[1:50:26] and his faith in god was counted to him
[1:50:29] for righteousness
[1:50:31] but not only now believing
[1:50:34] is wonderful but god said abraham you
[1:50:36] believe me
[1:50:38] there's your righteousness it's
[1:50:39] accounted to you for righteousness but
[1:50:41] i'm going to show that i accepted you
[1:50:44] by giving you the seal of circumcision
[1:50:47] and that is how god proves to you that
[1:50:49] he has accepted your faith
[1:50:52] is when he gives you the holy ghost you
[1:50:53] say how do i get it
[1:50:55] that's a wonderful hungry question how
[1:50:57] do you get the holy ghost
[1:50:59] because you need the holy ghost to be in
[1:51:02] a rapture
[1:51:03] if you don't if you don't have this in
[1:51:05] you
[1:51:07] then when this comes down you don't have
[1:51:10] nothing to meet
[1:51:13] you can't meet the head if you're not in
[1:51:15] the body
[1:51:16] and the only way to get in the body is
[1:51:18] by one spirit one spirit
[1:51:20] so whenever you have this
[1:51:23] you're then a candidate for the rapture
[1:51:25] no matter all the
[1:51:26] you see all the mistakes you're we're
[1:51:28] looking at the flesh you're looking at
[1:51:30] your human spirit there's always that
[1:51:32] you're gonna have that until our bodies
[1:51:33] are changed
[1:51:34] look at this
[1:51:38] because this is the word this is the
[1:51:40] part that god deposited in you
[1:51:44] and that's what we look to
[1:51:46] so without this then you're not part of
[1:51:48] the covenant
[1:51:49] now we're not
[1:51:51] born with the holy ghost
[1:51:53] we predestinated but yet we come to the
[1:51:56] earth
[1:51:57] with a nature
[1:51:59] a simple
[1:52:00] nature we don't come on the earth with
[1:52:02] no holy ghost
[1:52:04] we come with the sinful nature we have
[1:52:06] the desire for the things of the world
[1:52:07] we have a thirst for the things of the
[1:52:09] world
[1:52:10] no one has to teach us how to lie cheat
[1:52:11] still
[1:52:12] amen we already know that because of our
[1:52:15] first birth
[1:52:17] but because ye are sons
[1:52:20] and daughters of god
[1:52:22] because god did slip the ring of
[1:52:24] predestination on your finger before the
[1:52:26] foundation of the world you had the
[1:52:28] ability to receive something
[1:52:31] that the world knows nothing about you
[1:52:33] have the ability to receive
[1:52:35] the holy ghost
[1:52:38] so because you're predestinated god then
[1:52:41] at the time of the new birth you're
[1:52:43] filled with the holy ghost you're sealed
[1:52:46] in the kingdom of god satan can't take
[1:52:48] you out
[1:52:50] nobody can take you out you're sealed
[1:52:52] until the day of your redemption
[1:52:55] so in closing how do i get the holy
[1:52:57] ghost
[1:52:59] like everything else in god's word is
[1:53:01] very simple
[1:53:03] in acts 2 38 2 37 and when they heard
[1:53:06] this they were pricked in their hearts
[1:53:07] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[1:53:08] apostles men and brethren
[1:53:10] what shall we do this how do we get this
[1:53:12] holy ghost
[1:53:15] then peter said unto them see peter had
[1:53:18] the holy ghost at this point so he could
[1:53:19] tell others how to get it
[1:53:22] and peter said unto them repent and be
[1:53:24] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:53:27] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:53:29] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:53:32] holy ghost
[1:53:33] we can stand musicians can come
[1:53:35] for the promise is unto you and to your
[1:53:37] children and to all that are far off
[1:53:39] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:53:42] call
[1:53:44] if you repented and you've been baptized
[1:53:46] in the name of jesus christ stay under
[1:53:47] the atmosphere of the holy ghost keep
[1:53:49] praying for it it's a promise
[1:53:52] that's right
[1:53:53] in acts chapter 10
[1:53:56] and peter in 10 34 then peter opened his
[1:53:59] mouth and said
[1:54:01] of a truth i perceive that god is no
[1:54:03] respecter of persons
[1:54:05] but in every nation he that feareth him
[1:54:09] and worketh righteousness is accepted
[1:54:11] with him
[1:54:12] the word which god sent to the children
[1:54:14] of israel preaching peace by jesus
[1:54:16] christ he is lord of all that word i say
[1:54:18] ye know which was published throughout
[1:54:19] all judea and begin from galilee and
[1:54:22] after the baptism
[1:54:23] which john preached how god anointed
[1:54:25] jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost
[1:54:27] and with power who went about doing good
[1:54:29] and healing all that were oppressed of
[1:54:30] the devil for god was with them and we
[1:54:32] are witnesses of all things which he did
[1:54:35] both in the land of the jews and in
[1:54:37] jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a
[1:54:40] tree
[1:54:41] him god raised up the third day and
[1:54:44] showed him
[1:54:45] openly
[1:54:47] not to all people but unto witnesses
[1:54:50] chosen before of god
[1:54:52] even to us who who did eat and drink
[1:54:55] with him after he rose from the dead
[1:54:57] and he commanded us to preach into the
[1:54:59] people and to testify that it is he
[1:55:02] which was ordained of god to be the
[1:55:04] judge of the quick and the dead
[1:55:07] to him gave all the prophets witness
[1:55:10] that through his name whosoever
[1:55:12] believeth in him shall receive the
[1:55:14] remission of sins
[1:55:16] while peter yet spake these words that i
[1:55:19] was just reading amen the holy ghost
[1:55:22] fell on all them which heard the word
[1:55:25] amen
[1:55:26] it's in scripture orders in perfect
[1:55:28] scripture order to receive the word
[1:55:30] while the holy while the word is going
[1:55:32] forth
[1:55:34] don't miss your moment
[1:55:37] reach out god can feel with the holy
[1:55:39] ghost right where you're sitting
[1:55:42] you could have desired it for years and
[1:55:43] years months and months cried and went
[1:55:45] to the altar and everything else but yet
[1:55:47] right where you're sitting god could
[1:55:48] give you the holy ghost right where
[1:55:50] you're sitting god can give you a
[1:55:51] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:55:54] because it's a promise
[1:55:56] when paul passed through the upper coast
[1:55:58] of ephesus he said have you received the
[1:55:59] holy ghost since
[1:56:01] he believed not when since
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:05] they might have been in church for
[1:56:06] decades
[1:56:08] they might have been in service after
[1:56:09] service after service they might have
[1:56:10] believed everything paul said their
[1:56:12] messenger
[1:56:13] but he said have ye received the holy
[1:56:16] ghost
[1:56:17] since you believed
[1:56:21] our opening text in ephesians
[1:56:24] was in whom ye also trusted
[1:56:27] after that ye heard the word of truth
[1:56:29] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:56:31] also after that ye believed ye were
[1:56:34] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[1:56:38] you have the holy s if you have the holy
[1:56:40] ghost in your soul there's not a devil
[1:56:42] in hell that can touch you
[1:56:44] don't matter what he whispers in your
[1:56:46] ear it don't matter what mind battles he
[1:56:49] tries to give you
[1:56:50] it don't matter you're sealed he can't
[1:56:52] touch you
[1:56:54] you're on your way to a body change why
[1:56:56] because he walked out of the grave
[1:56:58] you're walking too
[1:57:00] he walked into a new body you're gonna
[1:57:02] walk too because if that same spirit
[1:57:07] if that same spirit that raised christ
[1:57:09] from the dead dwell in you it'll also
[1:57:11] quicken your mortal bodies
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:15] we can't look at our mistakes
[1:57:17] if we've experienced that new birth
[1:57:19] we've got to look at what he said about
[1:57:21] us
[1:57:23] if we haven't received a new birth
[1:57:26] we must
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:29] we must
[1:57:30] be born again
[1:57:32] when the word when there when there's
[1:57:34] things in our lives they don't quite
[1:57:35] line up like it should when there's when
[1:57:37] there's failures and faults and and
[1:57:39] things and we all like to say we all
[1:57:41] have them but when when there's major
[1:57:43] things in the life that really god
[1:57:45] really needs to to take care of
[1:57:48] he promised the holy ghost
[1:57:51] service after service the spirit is
[1:57:53] always so willing
[1:57:55] so willing
[1:57:57] to pour out his spirit
[1:57:59] to deliver
[1:58:01] to heal
[1:58:02] but it's got to go from from our minds
[1:58:05] to our hearts
[1:58:06] brothers and sisters
[1:58:11] may you be encouraged
[1:58:14] may you be encouraged to either seek the
[1:58:16] holy ghost like you've never sought it
[1:58:18] before
[1:58:19] and seek the new birth and cry out to
[1:58:21] god
[1:58:22] and follow the order of the scripture
[1:58:24] and then he's under obligation to fill
[1:58:25] you he's under obligation god can't lie
[1:58:30] we talk all the time about what god
[1:58:33] can do
[1:58:35] but there's something he can't do
[1:58:38] he can't lie
[1:58:40] he can't go back on his word
[1:58:43] he is obligated to his word
[1:58:47] if he said it
[1:58:49] and we follow in that
[1:58:51] scriptural order we've got to get the
[1:58:53] same results
[1:58:56] because he's jesus christ the same
[1:58:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:59:01] amen let's buy our heads and our hearts
[1:59:05] the gracious heavenly father
[1:59:07] lord how we love you and how we thank
[1:59:08] you lord jesus for these moments in

[1:59:32] tell us we look to the word
[1:59:36] we look to the word father lord and
[1:59:38] that's what we're trusting we're resting
[1:59:39] on that
[1:59:41] we're riding on that lord jesus lord

[1:59:57] accept it i believe it you said that in
[1:59:59] your word about me i accept it i believe

[2:00:09] soul
