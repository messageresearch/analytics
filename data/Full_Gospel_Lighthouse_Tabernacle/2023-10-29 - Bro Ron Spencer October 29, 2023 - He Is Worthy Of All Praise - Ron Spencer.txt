but the fishing's great amen so maybe the hunting's great it's just not the killing that so much and so amen Revelations chapter 5 and I want to worthy of all praise today Revelations chapter 5 and we're a part of the scripture and I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strange a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David ha prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four Beast and the in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain have having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the all the Earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book and the for Beast and the four and 20 Elders F fell down before the lamb having everyone of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song and this is our part and I'd like for you to read it with me saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the Seven Seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation next verse and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth let's pray Lord Jesus we love you today so good to be in the house of the Lord Lord we don't know what is going to be our last service and I just ask you that you would anoint our hearts and anoint our lips today I pray that not only as a speaker but also as a hearer strengthen Us in this this hour minister to us in a special way today in Jesus Christ's name we pray you may may be seated God bless you amen I'd like to talk to you as a pastor and also as a father just for a few minutes before I before I begin to preach any of you that are watching the news and I would say most of us are we realize that we're in a very in a very special time now for the Bride of Jesus Christ she's very aware we have tomorrow's newspaper and the reason that we have tomorrow's newspaper is because God sent us a message it came through a prophet Prophet is a sear of the word he is the voice to of God to that generation he posts the church on where we're at what is going to go on not just in the past and puts all the puzzle together but also takes the word and puts it into a new Administration and the bride is begins to begins to make herself ready and we begin to put the wedding dress on and we begin to place our we begin to take our place and we realize that we're the in the end of the Gentile dispensation this is the last days where the lsy is going to go right into the tribulation period and we realize that we've got to leave we got to leave we got to we we we we have come to the point to where the token is applied to our household we realize that the death angel has hit the denominational world we realize that people are confused Sodom is here the world leaders taken their place and they're doing their job militaries are rising and they're doing and they're saying all different kinds of things but if all of that be going on we eat the lamb we eat even the parts that are difficult for us to to eat but it's also an hour for prodal children to come home and uh we want to make sure that we've got everything ready now here's the part I want to talk to you as a father of this church listen if there's anything that is not right between you and God that standing between you and God I want you to get that ready get that taken care of if I could come to your home and sit down at your table as the prophet of God would do before communion he would go around and he say now get that right before you take communion get that right I'm not a prophet neither do I want to take brother brandom's place but I want to tell you we could be at the very end no man knows the day or the hour this isn't a play in time church we realize that every nation is coming against Israel even our nation leaders are saying the right things but our inner system of our nation our colleges our young people don't understand that they're under a spirit they're under a spirit that is leading this nation in a realm to where that it'll come against Israel and let me just say this to you it's prophecy it ain't a time for us to get in a political fight it's a time to put the dress on [Music] now if you remember just for a type for you elzer as a messenger as a type of of the messenger in this day he would go and the angel would go before him and Rebecca would would would would would actually receive the message and and she would tell her people I got to go with the man so she would leave her denominal system and and she would begin to make her way with elzer and on the journey the message would tell her what Isaac liked and he would tell her that this is how he wants you to dress and this is how he wants you to conduct yourself and this is what your future home is going to be like because we wasn't marrying elesar we were marrying Jesus Christ and so when they came to the certain spot there would come to a certain spot that they would come to to where elzer would would come over to a hill and in the field Isaac was standing there and she would know that that's him listen that's him that is Among Us now and we're not worship the prophet NE neither are we worshiping a man we're worshiping Jesus Christ and he that is Among Us he is worthy of all [Music] worship are you with me he has taken the book and he revealed the seals That's History now that's history all the lucans have been tied together not to build another denomination that's right right not to even head headquarters in Jeffersonville but to present us and get us ready because it's him that is Among Us he's worthy of all your praise for anybody that's on the internet watching now we're not wanting to build the personality of a Ministry of a kingdom neither do we want to point you to different places in the Earth but I want to point you to the word and there's anything that that you just haven't applied just right yet go ahead and get that taken care of because he already knows you say well brother Ron but I'm so ashamed he already knows he already knows he's he he knows what's going on but if you remember there's a lot of things that we look in our Humanity that is so big to us we can't hardly get across it but when God looks at it he don't look at it like a man does you was a in a mess before God got a hold to you but he's we're not Catholics here we don't have to keep doing penants or qu keep paying for prayers listen we just thank him for our Grace and his mercy and we march on [Applause] are you with me now now let me just give you a little point of reference here when the angel came in a tree to brother brandham as a boy he was carrying water to his to his father's steel that was making making whiskey right now a lot of people might get tangled up on that but God didn't look where that water was going are you with me he wasn't looking at our past brother Roger he wasn't looking at the nonsense of our life he had a work for him to do don't don't never smoke or drink or all of those different kind of don't get tangled up in that I got a work for you to do now I want to say this to you we got to finish this thing and those things that are in your life that's just needs to be taken care of get it taken care of he's got a work for us to finish just now is that all right is that all right in John chapter 1 and verse one and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God yeah now so many times we get so tangled in that you was in the word right Hallelujah and we're identified in the word and and the same was in the beginning with God and the things all things were made by him and and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not and there was a man that was sent from God whose name was John and the saying came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lightthe world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them he gave power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God you're an offspring of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among them oh don't you love the Lord and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth I don't know when I read that I just feel like running all over the building cuz that tell was my life story now think about this just for a moment brother brandom says these words he says what do you think of him whose son is he why in birth he was wonderful in his birth he said do you believe that in his birth he was wonderful in wisdom there was never a man like that that spoke like this man do you believe that in sacrifice he was perfect right Amen in death he was the Redeemer when he arose he proved that he was God hallelujah that's right he said he was and when he was on Earth he said he was God he looked like God he acts like God he preached like God he rose like God oh I like that he was God hallelujah he rose like God he was God he said Emmanuel unveiled in flesh walking among men he was God Emmanuel he fulfilled the father he thrilled the hearts of poets Great Men down Through the Ages and every man that ever mounted to a hill of beans was somebody that put their trust in him that he was a son of God H Give the Lord a good hand right there now Jesus was the highest revelation of God Amen I think we could all say Amen Jesus literally means Jehovah savior he is the fullness of the revelation of God that name has it all he said all the former Revelations of God he is MDC he is the priest and King he is elsh he is Jehovah Gyra he is my provider he is Jehovah Nissi he's my banner he is Jehovah rapi he said he's my healer everything let's just say it everything is in that one name he said Jesus the name the name that is highest of all names he is highest of all names go ahead and say it he is the highest of all names there is not a greater revelation of God than Jesus and from him comes all other Revelations if if Jesus Is God incarnate then Jesus is is the greatest name that has ever been revealed Matthew chapter Matthew chapter 1 and verse 21 and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus it was said by angels and the first time that his name comes across human lips a baby that's dead in the womb comes to life so let me just say don't fail to let that name come across your [Music] lips because he is Jesus he is the savior he's my king he's my bridegroom Philippians chapter 2 verse 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in Earth of things under the Earth Jesus is the highest name of all names there is no other name given among men whereby we shall be saved are you with me acts 4 and verse 10 be it known unto you and to all people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by whom do this man stand but here before you hold this is the stone which the was set at the KN at the Builders of the which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other name there is not another name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be sa sa D Matthew 28 and verse 19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost these are titles but when the Revelation come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's how that's a scriptural baptism Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace no none of those titles is his name but his name Shall be Called all of these things in the name of Jesus wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of Peace every bit of that is in the name of Jesus when you say Jesus he is wonderful when you say Jesus he is our counselor when you say Jesus he is a mighty God he is the Everlasting father he is the Prince of Peace father is not a name no more than wonderful counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God our Everlasting father there's no salvation in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost you must know that the Holy Ghost is and if you don't know the Holy

to bed Jesus deserves our best amen amen amen tell your neighbor Jesus deserves our best last night I was just I was overwhelmed last night brother George Quinn was here and he's become a friend become a real bosom buddy through the years and years ago when I was in Christiansburg he would put on overhauls and go with me to clean chimneys people didn't know who he was but they loved that accent and they love that wonderful positive attitude even years later they would ask me about that Irish guy that was in their home how much they enjoyed him we had him in our home since Thursday afternoon took him up on the mountain and it was a day to where we saw more deer than we've ever seen we saw bucks there we able to show him bears and you know he thought he was in heaven we put him on the golf cart and he he talked all the way around and I said dear God with him talking we won't see an animal he was just so enthus and as God would have it we'd ride right up on three deer and they'd be standing there and you know and and they'd be standing right there and and he said said isn't this wonderful then they would Trot off and he said they must have heard the golf cart I didn't tell him what they [Applause] heard I've been in this home and the suit that I wore last last week last night he bought for me and as it turns out it's the only s suit that actually fits now and so so I I wear it with pride and I you know walked into the place and he said I want to buy the best suit that I can buy for him and this is where this all comes in let me just say this to you where where we want to treat we want to treat God the best that we can you know not just on Sunday morning every day we want to have an atmosphere around us you know when he comes in the room you can feel that warm out atmosphere you can feel it when it the atmosphere just changes and we want to take the time to worship him he's more important than anything on the television he's more important than any book that you could ever read listen he wants to change your life and if we're not careful we'll get so carnal and so caught up with everything that's around us listen I want my house house to and I've said it before and I I I'm telling you the truth I want my house to be a place that he can come he don't have to dig through my closets he don't all that's been cleaned out he don't have to come through my life all of that's been cleaned out I'm afraid he'll find it he already knows but I want my house to be a place to where he can he can come and he can dwell and he can enjoy not only he but I want when God's children comes to to sit down they can feel the presence of God just Illuminating brother George gave me a gift you know and it was a gift that really just took my breath for a bit it was a it was words out of Pilgrim's Pro progress it was talking about the Palace of a home that how you could go there and you could enjoy and you could feel refreshed and you could feel charged by the presence of God and he said brother Ron that's your home I I just was breathtaken by it this is your home he had taken quite a bit of time to to transcribe those words cuz it's definitely two full large pages and he pulled all that from Pilgrims Progress and I was just breathtaking God made my home be like that but I don't want just my home I want your home I want your home Not A Home of fussing and stewing driving the spirit of God away it should be a home Amen to where at any time you could fall on your knees and begin to talk to God I'm not talking about just you but I'm talking about you and your wife how long has it been since you fell on your knees and you begin to pray and you felt the spirit of God come and sweep through the room oh brother Ron we were looking for Rapture are you ready are you ready because you need to have an atmosphere here to go there that's right are you ready remember in the air you don't change if if you die here that's what you'll be there if you're a liar here you'll be a liar there if you're a cheat here you'll be a cheat there let me just drop this to you you remember the rich man in Hell the rich man in hell he he had done a lot of things on earth that wasn't pleasing to God matter of fact he had an opportunity he came to Jesus right as a Rich Young Ruler but in hell he got religious let me go back and tell my brothers don't come here the angel told him he said Moses is there the prophets are there but they won't hear them they wouldn't hear you but I want to capture something here that man is still 2,000 years later is still in that torment he's still in that torment 2,000 years have passed America's been discovered yeah we raise our flag we're only just a couple hundred years old but that man is still still in hell and the deal is it is not over he still got a long stretch to go I read a statement the other day from a from a famous preacher he said if we could just lift the lid of hell and and let people see he said our altars would be full but listen fear don't make you converted let me just say I don't know how many services are left the word of God should draw on your life when I'm saying this about your home don't live one way at work and one way at school in one way it's highly unlikely that the Rapture will happen here on Sunday morning it may happen that way and I'm not dis qualifying now but most likely somewhere between 600 and 9:00 I just want to say this to you I want to be ready but brother Ron I've been done a lot of ways in my life it don't matter that's just tough that's just stuff ask God to forgive whatever it is well brother Ron but I have a lot of things in my life it's okay it's just stuff you can tell that I'm not a I'm not a marathon runner you can tell that but I am a walker and when I walk I I put on the best walking shoes I got I don't put on coveralls I don't put on knit hats I try to I try to walk with the temperature I try to wear the lightest clothes that I can walk not shorts but I try to wear the light lightest clothes that I can we walk with but if I was a marathon runner I wouldn't put on heavy boots I wouldn't put on heavy clothes I wouldn't get my weights out and put them on my shoulders I'd lay aside every weight and I'd prepare for a while you know you if you're a marathon runner and you're really Ser serious you know you start doing hello this might work you you start getting yourself ready you you run a 100 yards and then you run a half a mile and and then you run a mile and then you run three miles and go hey it's working pretty good before long your lungs get built up you can suck through the nose and you could feel your lungs strong and after a while you can do eight miles and after a while you do 10 and it didn't long you you know that you got to do more than 26 to to for you to be able to compete in a to you know to at least get a ribbon and so you might work your way up to 40 miles so at 26 you're still on I don't want to just make it into the Rapture hanging on for the Rapture is in me and I want to feed it the Rapture is not an accident it's not an accident the Rapture is already going [Applause] on you've been beeding on the message some of you for 40 years whether you know it or not God be to pull you into the Rapture 40 years ago one morning it'll finish is that all right is that all right brother he was more than that to me that was God and a man he was a he was a man when he come to the come off the mountain that day hungry looking around the trees to to find some figs to eat he was hungry he was hungry like a man but when he took five little biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 that was more than a man that was God in a man who could break that bread and multiply the Loaves and cook fish and produce it that's right he was more than a man amen and it is true that he was a man when he was laying there and on the boat that night a storm come up and 10,000 Devils of the sea swore that they had drowned him he was so tired from seeing visiones and praying for the sick he was a little old boat like a bottle stopper out there bouncing up and down the devil saying we got him now he's asleep he was a man when he was tired and sleeping but when he put his foot on the brow of that boat and he looked up and said Peace be still and the winds and waves obeyed him and there was they they were that was more than a man that was God speaking through that man he was a man that cried on Calvary my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me he was a man that he was cried for Mercy but on the third day when he broke the seals of death hell in the grave and Rose up he proved that he was God now one of the poets gets it's inspired that that the life of of every poet and every author that's ever wrote a song any man that's ever amounted to a hill of means believe all of that to be the truth he begins to sing all hail the power of jesus' name let Angels prostate fall bring forth a holy diadem and crown him Lord of all all hell all hail the power of jesus' name let Angels prostrate fall oh my on Christ that Solid Rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand what a could I say of Fanny Crosby what do you think about it she said pass me not oh gentle savior and hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by for thou art the stream of all comfort more than life to me whom have I on earth besides thee or whom in heaven but thee let whatever be said cherubin of God whom than heaven but thee one said living he loved me Dy and he saved me buried he carried my sins far away Rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day I like it when he stops he said we are disputing with a conquered enemy that's enough to shout about all day long brother seab breze the devil's whipped loved your song this morning the devil is whipped now if he can fight knowing he's whipped like the way he does how about you who's read the back of the book and you're the Queen of Heaven that'll stand for eternity by his side how much more should we be able to fight Give the Lord a good hand right [Applause] there he said oh he said have faith in God how the devil has to recognize the supr authority of Jesus Christ not me he hates me he doesn't have to mind me but he has to mind who I represent he has to mind who sent me here amen I love that don't you when he says about the mighty conqueror he said I can see him as heavens and earth turned black and the rocks are beling and the the Mount of the mountains the whole Heavens the moon and the stars refus to sign he conquered it and when he went down and descended down and knocked at the door and those Souls that was there and when the doors open and those people who laughed and made fun of Enoch who made fun of Noah I can hear him say I am the one that Enoch said would come with 10,000 of his Saints why didn't you believe Enoch why didn't you believe Noah I'm going to add this why didn't you believe William ranom everything had to know that he' conquered when he shut the door on them why didn't you believe Homer Frasier why didn't you believe Donnie Reagan I just feel it why didn't you believe Tim PR why didn't you believe Ron Spencer oh my brother Ron I see their Humanity didn't you see God too but I see Andrew's Humanity but look deeper I challenge you look [Applause] deeper why'd you go back to that brother R I felt I felt a thunderbolt everything had to know that he'd conquered when he shut the door on them the days of Mercy was passed on down through the lowest pit of Hell he went and he knocked on the city doors of the devil's hell and the Devil comes to the door and when when he we look to see there he was were well here you are after all I was sure that I had you when I killed the prophets I was sure that I had you when I cut John's head off in prison but here you are After all you've got here and I can hear him as he straightens himself up and say Satan I'm the Virgin born the son of a living God my blood's still wet on the cross I paid the price I have conquered it and I've come down to take over and strip you of everything that you can claim that you had he reached over on his side and jerked the keys of death hell and the of off of him and kicked him back to the place where he belonged he conquered hell where he rose he had the keys of death and the hell hanging on him what's the church scared about then that's right he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered [Music] hell what more can we say right here death is conquered hell is conquered you don't have to go there [Applause] brother Brandon preaches a sermon on he that is in you brother George spoke last night of course he didn't know what I was going to speak today and he said the life that you live now quit beating yourself for the life that you once lived you're not that man no more you're not that woman no more it may look like the same house but that guy don't live here no more and I want to just give you a few quotes out of it Greater is he it's God God the Creator the winds and the waves had to obey him demons become paralyzed all nature obeyed him because he was greater he was the creator of nature oh when we think it takes a bite out then we understand these things you see what is it it isn't man man cannot do it man is part of creation but it's the winds and the waves that obeys the Creator and and takes the Creator to do it he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world he that can cause the turmoil that's he that's in the world he that's in you is the creator who made the WIS he can rebuke every devil out of the Winds and there is Cal he can rebuke the devil out of the storm and there is no storm he's the Creator and greater is he that is in you are you catching this now he lives in you I want to ask yourself where does he live at I want to just tell this story last year you was there brother Gabriel will you stand we was in the prayer line where was that at Louisiana what what was it was it Easter meeting Easter meeting one of the last people in the prayer line was a wife of a brother in church and she had taken on a spirit it's easy to take on a spirit negative Spirit comes along and before long it gets inside of you listen just because the spirit comes along you don't have to take it on somebody tells you something and you get in that spirit and you start getting negative and before long that Spirit controls you Hey listen you you watch a man it gets so old and he starts buying sports cars start dying his hair and he's he's feeling young again and he's he knows that he's not built for a 20 he's built for 50 and and you know he's changing his life but he takes on a spirit I can be young again well it ain't made to do that in this life does same thing to ladies they go through menopause if they're not careful they'll take on a spirit brother brandom tells us that I'm not telling you this brother brandom tells you that you take on a keep saying and they and they'll take on a spirit and if you're not careful that spirit will destroy you it can go to such a point to where you don't know your husband you don't know one another Pastor a friend of mine his wife got so bad she hated him every day she became bedfast he he waited on her hand and foot took care of her and she hated the ground and he knew it was a spirit and one day that spirit left she has said in this church multiple times you didn't know that she look like a pastor's wife she looks like a queen she looks like a you know Mrs perfect but you didn't know the war that she went through the war don't have to Define you the war don't have to Define you keep fighting that's why you got to have good friends around you no matter what you're going through they won't give up on [Applause] you this girl was standing before us I'd say she probably she probably watch this so I got to be careful maybe 40 he said that she she locked eyes with me and when she locked eyes with me I knew I was dealing with a demon and she locked eyes and I knew I knew now it was going to take more than a man she was in the line because she wanted to be free of that she wanted to be free and she' came to the right place I knew that I needed more than myself but I also knew that I had have such a life inside of me that that Devil Couldn't call nothing out that's right come on now listen if you're not right that devil has a right to call you out listen that just should happen with brother brandham men of God we have a right to cast out Devils but you got to be right that's right and I just stood there for a while and I stood there and I stood there and I knew if I didn't get to the root cause of why this devil was there I'd never be able to help her was you there and in just a moment probably five minutes I said ' I see what it is you was molested at four years old and she crumbled I said you don't have to live under that thing you can be free and in a moment I'm talking about it in a moment greater than he that was in me amen spoke to the winds and the storms of her life and in a moment she was totally different [Music] she came in the prayer line just a few weeks ago at brother Tim's a completely different atmosphere and I said I see that you're free hair was different her atmosphere was different because greater is he are you with me now greater is he the night that she got delivered they came and met me where I was sleeping and they shook that trailer I shook that trailer and I woke up to see a wolf's head with a lot of others that was with him and they shook that trailer and they screamed at me Andrew on the other end of the trailer heard the racket heard the noise and I looked at it knowing who I was even laying in the bed and I said you go to the river and go drown yourself in that River because the same one that lives in me 2,000 years ago at Legion listen he don't only clown the storms that are on the ocean but he clowns the storms in our lives I'm on a mission now he can CL the storms in your life you don't have to be you don't have to be tormented tell the devil right now leave go back to where you came from I am a Son of God I am a daughter of [Applause] God while you're standing and the musicians are coming the same God is with us tonight not only is he with us he's in us he's proved that he's in US greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world what are we afraid of Greater is he that was in Moses than he was in the Egypt greater is he that's in Moses than any Pharaoh could do with all of his enchantments greater was he that was in Moses than he that was in The Magicians greater he was in Daniel was greater than the Lions he could stop those hungry lies so anything that can stop it anything is greater than what can be stopped oh King I'll see you in the morning oh King I'll see you in the morning hey he can stop the cancer he
