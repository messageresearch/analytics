and so i'm really looking forward to this so amen so love you i so loved last night i was i i'm a daddy i'm a natural daddy and so and when i watched andrew preach last night i just sat there for a little bit thinking of how proud i am of what god has done and i know that i didn't do nothing but just try to have a good atmosphere in the home and played the tapes in the home and we prayed in the home and then god did the rest and so and god's did a lot of a lot of rest and so sister katie is a queen in that home there and you know it takes a real lady she didn't ask to be a pastor's wife she

we love brother kelly and sister myra and we have we've had a lot of good times together we're going to spend eternity together brother canard we're going to spend eternity together that's what we're going to do amen amen so if you would remember us in prayer and andrew andrew glover andrew glover will be with us saturday night and then andrew spencer will be with a sunday morning so it's the a a show so amen amen and this one will really cure you yeah yeah amen i'd like to speak to you on an interesting thought today i i think you'll enjoy just the title of it and i'd like to call satan's name by by just pointing him out real quick satan has underestimated you [Music] got a smile just at the title he has underestimated you i'd like to ask him have you forgot who you're fooling with here i had an experience one time where they had told me that i was paralyzed and would be that way the rest of my life and i looked up from that bed and i said you don't know who you're talking to there was a fire that took place in my life and they were going to harvest my organs and they had come to a decision we're going to do it at such and such a time but five hours before they were to harvest my organs i woke up i still had need of that now i face cancer and they gave me four months two and a half years ago so i guess i can can as a minister stand here and preach this sermon satan you underestimated us second corinthians chapter 10 and verse 3 this morning ii corinthians chapter 10 and verse 3 for though that we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfire are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ you might have a need this morning you'd just like to say lord would you remember me today let's just pray father you see our hands up this morning you know our needs you know before we even think it or we even ask it but you taught us to ask that we might receive you taught us to believe and we do and now we stand in this atmosphere of expectation that all things are possible now today anoint us like never before inspire us lord strengthen us for the journey that lays ahead father refill us with the holy spirit lord let us not lay on yesterday's experience or 10 years ago but may it be fresh may it be fruitful in our lives dear god we pray in jesus christ's name we ask a man a man and a man and a man amen you can be seated i'd like to announce to you that we have a champion our champion's not has never lost a war our champion has never lost a war he's never lost a battle satan would have to even testify that our champion has whipped him every time he's never been in crisis he never has a stress meeting in heaven and what he promises will come to truth he's not a political scientist he's not just wondering if it will happen he's wrote the book and if you ever was the thought of god god will never forget you that's a good basis a star didn't it but we get our mind on what men think or what our feelings think or what others think about us all of those things don't matter let's just look at what really matters what other people think of me don't matter what you think about yourself really don't matter but it's what god thinks about me [Applause] it such as two opponents in a boxing ring they both are testing each other's strengths and each other's abilities now let me just lay it like this god created his own enemy god created his own enemy and in creating his own enemy the reason that he did it was to show parts of himself that would never be showed in any other way inside of god there had to he wanted to show that he was a savior so somebody had to be lost he wanted to show that i am a healer i am a writer listen in him he wanted to show that i am the word i am the light so he had to show an enemy that could believe that he could win had to build an enemy that would believe in himself that he could win and god knew he couldn't i like it i like it when you're on the wind inside this is a red court this is a rigged war i don't know if you've understood it yet but you have been invited and put in a war that you will win there will be times that you think i'm not going to make it through but you will win you will get through this there's a contrasting of opposites there's a law of opposites there's two kingdoms of opposites but we realize that we came from god and we're going back to god and you must never never never forget where you came from the scripture says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers rules of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places our prophet would speak to us a contest if you haven't listened to it lately it's a powerful sermon go back and listen to it contest is a strength is a test of strength we have been given the greatest strength that you could possibly ever be given are you with me now remember these simple principles as we would start nothing great has ever been done without persistence there's always some sweat equity in it we serve an infinite god that knows the end from the beginning retreat is never in our vocabulary that must be kind of when when we live in a world where people quit where people burn out where people give up where people don't want to go on any longer where suicide is rampant we as christians sit in churches all across the world under the message of the hour and retreat is never in our vocabulary because we believe that there is nothing impossible with our god now the scripture tells us that fear not fear is real fear is mentioned in the scripture 600 times but jesus even the angels would tell brother branham fear not i believe that can be said for me and you today regardless of our circumstances or situations or what the doctors are telling us fear not just keep speaking faith allow the faith worse to go across your lips remember this you're the final frontier as gentile believers you're the final group that will fight an enemy such as we're fighting we're that final group that satan has mustered all of his enemies to get ready to fight against as a matter of fact the river euphrates has been loosened against the bride of jesus christ and all of hell is against the bride of jesus christ and he still don't have enough say it with me and he still don't have enough let's have a participation service and he still don't have enough let's say it like our sister saying it it's gonna take a stronger win than this hallelujah we have been given the right in the word that will defeat the devil anywhere any place at any time the scripture says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so you must not think what you think you've got to think what god thinks about you you might think you're a shriveled up little nobody but god says you're an overcomer of laodicea that you're an invincible army so i choose to believe god [Applause] whether you're in a lion's den or you've got a six-foot stick in your hand like shamgar had or a stone in a rope you are the winner [Applause] at the end of the day daniel walked out of the lion's den at the end of the day david pulled a giant's head up to the top of the hill at the end of the day schanger stood there with a stick and there wasn't one enemy standing at the end of the day we'll be in a rob trap brother branham said the right mental attitude even in a cancer center they're telling us every day said it's your attitude toward cancer if you believe you're going to lose you're going to lose you're going to lose you get up fearing it every day you're going to lose you get up in a bad attitude every day you're going to lose shake yourself shake yourself get up out of the bed and say what am i going to do today it don't matter what you feel like it don't matter what you think it's what god said and if i've got god's attitude toward the battle that is facing me i'm going to win [Applause] [Music] the scripture says let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me a lot of people have trouble but they don't know where their source is a lot of people wary but wary is the opposite of faith where it has no virtue in it it has absolutely no strength wary will never fix your problem punch your neighbor and tell him where he will never fix your problem the scripture says count it all joy if the devil's not trying to get you you can finish the sentence if the devil hasn't got you so if he is at war with you counted joy when the enemy arranges to come around you engage him. the enemies are the enemy's fighting engaging send him back to hell don't testify for him so many people testify for him and actually blow his balloon up come on help me church i'm not the only one who wants to have a good time here this morning don't blow the devil's balloon up he is a loser so don't make him feel like a [Applause] oh winner i'm in a lot of circumstances they don't matter never look back the runner that looks back loses the scripture tells us to press towards the mark of the high calling press press say it press now satan's job is to exalt itself it's doubt its reasonings it's his questions about the revealed word of this hour but faith can reach where science can never reach it's good to have confidence in your good old doctors but faith overrides all of their practicing ability because they're practicing physicians and our god is a perfecting one but brother ron i'm under pressure who ain't who in this building is not under pressure our youngest children are under pressure moms and dads are under pressure old people in nursing homes are under pressure they ring the bell and nobody comes brother ron i'm busy in my life who ain't busy just tell me who ain't busy and i'll give them something to do but most of our situations is where we create our own problems and then we blame the devil for our problems we create our own problems and then expect god to come rushing on the scene for the things that we created we ate those donuts we ate that cake we ate all that pie and then we asked god to drop a hundred pounds for us baby you put it in you're gonna have to work to get it off [Applause] you thought that i would leave it there you watch those filthy movies you read that filthy trash and now you've got demons hanging all in your life you got to go on your knees [Music] there ain't no quick fix here you got to drive them demons out of your life there's work to be done you got to drive them out you invited them into the throne of your room of your heart them things stay there you let them in you got to drive them out we want some preacher to say all kinds of hocus pocus over top of us or speak in tongues over top of us to get rid of the nonsense in our life that we let in our life god gave you a word to put protection around you but you let them demons in you gotta fight you gotta engage them to get them out of your life but don't you feel like it's over just cause they're there fight when a man falls get up get up i preached it for years when you foul get up it's not a shame to foul get up brother ron i have disappointments your next-door neighbor has disappoints the people of the earth have disappointments we have calamities brother ron everybody has calamities but we're sick the devil puts sickness if you've went to the hospital lately you're not the only guy in the hospital if you went to the hospital lately you're not the only one with cancer but you've got a prescription you've got a helper for you i'm a christian brother ron and disasters has come my way i don't know if you read the newspaper but there's people walking with their children just simply shopping going to get ice cream going into mcdonald's going into 7-eleven and get shot they didn't get up that morning and go well today's my last day on earth they didn't expect it to happen and then there's funerals multiple funerals take place and they're wondering maybe worse god what happened why is the world so wicked it's gonna get worse don't take a day for granted there's a sister here sister connie came here and i'm gonna read this i've read it before and maybe i didn't ask her permission but i'm going to read it in canada as well but i believe it's going to help somebody she came to this building 15 years ago last weekend and brother tim pruitt preached two services i mentioned them to you last week feeling the water i was filling the water in that service sometimes you don't understand what what happens to a preacher while he preaches especially if he's a gifted man toward the end of the service you saw me get enormously emotional and being led off of the stage but as i talked to you about the woman washing jesus's feet i saw the most phenomenal vision i've ever seen in my life as i was talking to you about her laying there under those blankets and men would get up and throw their filthy their filthy money down on top of her i was seeing that in vision but that wasn't all the vision where i got to incredibly emotional is is the vision transferred to standing behind the lord jesus and watching her wash his feet and when i saw that it was over in this building brother tim pruitt was preaching yes he's my friend but he was seeing what many of you maybe many of you didn't get to see but i was laying and the doctors had now given me up and i'd slipped into a non-responsive state sister carney came to service because that's our source of strength and i want to say it again satan has underestimated you so here under the pressure of her husband that has preached all of these years and now is laying in a spot to where that the doctors have given up and there's no more that they can do god is saying across this pulpit god will have a testimony she writes these notes our daily walk with god trials satan cannot destroy us until god gives him permission now help me preach i want to say this to you and leave that lay this with you satan can't touch a hair of your head he can't touch a hair of your head until he goes before our god and gets permission to do it then you can count it all joy because god's got confidence in you that you can make it through your trial so let's quit thinking negative about the trial hallelujah god has a reason for everything god is in control real christians with heart disease cancer real christians families with financial troubles all kinds of tribulation there is a reason for it where god can produce spiritual growth we got to understand god's grace we got to understand that the footsteps of the righteous are you with me the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord our brother's sitting back in the wheelchair he's listening to me preach and god speaks supernaturally using my voice you can get help there they moved a long way because god supernaturally spoke to him you get help there isn't that true yeah that's true god knows how to speak to your heart sister connie just raise your hand there's a lot of people in the world haven't seen you she came to church knowing that i had slipped into a non-responsive state and she sat behind you and sister evelyn and sister joyce and she spoke to you guys that it wasn't good but that wasn't what you heard from the pulpit am i right that wasn't what you heard from the pope i'm preaching to you today it's just part it's just i just took a little part here that wasn't what you heard from the pulpit your troubles today may not be non-responsive activity but look at the result 15 years later but the best goal is brother connor you know brother biscuit very well brother brother biskell is 3 000 miles away he's in his study real early in the morning they bout they built they bought mount baker camp god speaks to him that the hearing is the last to go and he calls sister connie matthew's in one hospital i'm in another hospital in a coma and he tells her tell brother put it in his ears tell brother ron that you'll be the speaker next year at mount baker camp not just be alive but you'll be the speaker next year at mount baker camp god knows you're tomorrow sister carla god knows your tomorrow sister janetta i love you he knows you're tomorrow you just sung about him he knows you're tomorrow sister joyce shall sit with queens in the eternity so why should we worry about today sister nancy you're set with queens in the eternity queens will sit there as as ministers wives of the men that carried the gospel of jesus christ as those men's hands are the earth names are called and that you join as you walk up that great that gray stairs that day audience will chill so what you cheer what you fear today doesn't matter the aggravation of this life doesn't matter it's not what today holds for us but it's what eternity [Applause] brother brown said you you know your enemy you train for him you train for a contest that you're going to have to meet him because you're going to meet him and you know know what his strength is and train for the contest and when you do meet him for it's one sure thing that you're going to meet him so train for the contest now training for a contest is like a boxer his enemy that he is going to meet out there in this contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent he knows his lips he studies his licks he knows where he's fighting where he leans forward hangs back fights right left-handed brother branham was saying all those things because he was an undefeated fighter this is more than a quote he was given us the training that he had as a young man that now he's using in a pulpit are you with me and he's saying those dark lines going all across the building he's watching them he's not only watching the angel the lord and the presence of the lord and the pillar of fire of the lord but he's watching those demons run for cover and yet he's standing there preaching the gospel because he knows that is what will defeat the devil anywhere any place anytime now here's what i want to do with all of that you may not be able to see dark lines in the building demons running for cover but what you can do is take the word of god and defeat the devil anywhere any place [Applause] god is our strength psalms 46-1 god is our strength and a very present help in trouble because god knows you're as human beings you're gonna have it you guys in school you just graduated congratulations to you guys in school you're 13 now teenager happy birthday but even 13. there's trouble trouble with little brothers that will never leave mary have 14 children of your own because it runs in your family god is our strength a refuge a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains will be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake and the swelling thereof salah there is a river and the streams whereof shall make glad and the city of god the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high god is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved and he uttered his voice and the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us and the god of jacob is our refuge i like just reminding the devil whose side i'm on [Applause] i may be five foot five seem absolutely insignificant but you don't know devil who's on the inside of here come behold the works of the lord what the desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow that cutteth the spear and the sunda he burneth the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heather and i will be exalted in the earth the lord of the host is with us the god of jacob is our refuge why don't you just tell your enemy right now if he's setting close to you and i'm not talking about your wife god is my refuge brother braham said god said i am the lord thy god that heals all of your diseases [Applause] do you really believe that so that means he heals all your diseases but brother branham's brother ron so and so died he healed that disease he healed it i die in the morning don't you have no weeping doubting party cause i'm gonna be dancing i'm gonna be running i don't know how many hands i'm going to shake before i start running like never before i'm going to be free no more 20 pills in the morning and 20 at night i'm going to be free no more nausea no more headaches no more seizures no more is situations i'm gonna be free if he sets me free here no more none of that either way i'm gonna be a winner jesus said if a house is to be divided against itself if satan cast out satan then then the kingdoms divided don't you underestimate the devil he's too smart for that satan ain't going to cast himself out he's just got you confused that's all no sir satan can't cast out satan me cast myself out well i know better than that notice and don't unders underestimate jesus either here's where this came from i'm not that smart because he's the power over all powers won't you say it my jesus is the power over all powers every devil in hell big ones little ones middle size ones squirmy-eyed devils boastful demons temper devils stubborn devils lustful devils jesus is more powerful polio devils he's more powerful so the more that you look at that little boy's arm your jesus is more powerful than the demon that affects that now maybe you're here this morning and you're a sinner you don't know god but let me just say this to you i don't care what you're saying is my jesus is greater than that sin maybe you're sitting on the internet somewhere another and you live in such a defiled life and your life is raunchy and you feel like you can't crime out the bottom of the gutter my jesus has got the cure for that i had a taxi dry cab driver in china and he was homeless he had nothing he slept on the streets and somebody put a book in his hand and he believed what that book said about him became a preacher had a family when i got there had a taxicab business lived in a good neighborhood god knows how to fix you in every way that you can be fixed i want to say it to you if you think you can't be fixed you haven't met my jesus [Applause] [Music] and just just to give you a recount the woman at the well thought she couldn't be fixed legion thought he couldn't be fixed the man that was a leopard thought he could not be fixed [Applause] don't underesti underestimate this jesus don't underestimate this jesus don't underestimate that when jaybird back there started playing tennis i thought tennis have you seen jay have you seen james that don't that don't look like a tennis player and then i got to hear and he's winning i'm sure people walked out on the on the court this is okay jay walked out on the court and said look who i'm playing today [Applause] this is going to be fun here comes old skinny nelly and he walks out there and he starts serving to that old boy over there on the court and all of a sudden he's running places he ain't never running his life and he's this guy over here has underestimated his enemy [Applause] i'm sure the devil walks up to you sometimes and looks and goes oh that's my assignment today [Music] they sent me to his address i got a ride in a tractor trailer with him today and then he starts playing a prophet's mess and you go oh i met him in the prayer line oh baby huh [Applause] and that little girl walked up i think it was two different occasions walked up and nothing but white in its eyes and brother branham stood there prayed for it i'm sure there was a lot of skeptics in the building sure they were and in the middle of the prayer brother branham stops and says what color eyes would you like to have [Applause] blue and when when the baby turned they were the most beautiful blue eyes you ever see that's my jesus don't underestimate him don't underestimate him brother brahma is standing and he said i felt so sorry for this man he had been a worshiper of the son and he said he would be about my daddy's size notice brother branham the man and he said i put my shoe beside of his shoe to see if my shoe would fit him i put my hands around him and he said i wondered if my suit would fit him there was a lot of critics out there and brother branham saw a vision that he was healed now let me just say this to you once that vision breaks that prophet could stand there before every devil in hell because he knew that the god that said let there be a son and believed his own word i'm coming to a finish i'm not going to be much longer hang with me and he believed his own word in the same and it came into existence don't underestimate what god can do he created he created a sun that will never burn out because he likened it unto himself it'll never exhaust and so he sees a vision of this man well so now he can stand in front of every devil in hell and none of them none of them can step forward which of your gods will come heal this man your gods are so powerful which one are your gods you've been challenging me which of your gods will come heal this man brother branham had been put on the spot over and over and over again remember when he walks in and there's a witch that's got a table in the air and she challenges him and he calls all kinds of names but when he called the name of jesus christ that table came down so hard it broke the legs off of it maybe people want to steal skepticize brother branham and they always will because they don't even know who they are they want to challenge who brother branham was but they don't know who they are the reason we can stand with such boldness is brother branham taught us who we are we came from god and we're going back to god we're as eternal as god as eternal god created us before the foundation of the whereas he knowed my name he wrote it down and we can stand with boldness like that prophet stood with boldness and declare that this man in a couple of moments is going to see don't underestimate my god don't you underestimate my god we'll tell something very personal now i had a funeral year year and a half two years ago i was invited i was actually shocked i was invited to reach a funeral and god told me i said i'm in this and i went into the room the family room and i knew what god told me i'm in this and if god's in in business he's got business to do god just don't show up to to fool around i'm in this i prayed with the family i walked out i walked up to the chapel and i turned around and god spoke to me again i'm in this and sister janetta sits in this church today because god was in that

the chain somebody's designed to break the chain somebody's going to break the chain [Applause] so far the most difficult surgery of my life was when they took me in and i kissed sister connie goodbye and they took me in and put an apparatus on my head that would hold my head completely still for four hours and they would put me to sleep but even when you're still you sometimes squirm but they had to have my brain completely quiet i put eight stainless steel bolts in the structure of my brain the structure of my skull they told me that i would go to sleep for about seven minutes and wake up in excruciating pain and the woman at the end of the at the end of the bed was from a place called check check is seven miles from pilot where i grew up and i talked to her and she said keep your eyes focused on me and she said i'm a countdown for you and she said it's going to be it's going to be you're going to go to sleep and then we're going to wake you up and you're going to be fully alert but in excruciating pain and i said okay and when i woke up i had a harness all across my head steel rods going down this way steel rods going around my face and around my head and and that's what they would have to do to do brain surgery and so when i woke up i never had pain like that in my life and they said now we're going to give you some shots for the pain and they did didn't affect it and as they were going down the hall they took me by the lunch facility and i rolled my head forward and connie was on the phone sitting at one of the tables and i called out to her and she couldn't hear me but i called out to a higher authority than her and i said jesus jesus you're gonna have to help me i've never told this here i don't think and as they wheeled me down through a very dark hallway and went went across the guy that was willing to buggy i just began to pray i prayed what god laid on my heart god let me be the cycle breaker of this cancer because they had told me that it's a hereditary thing my mama had it on her skin her mother had it on her skin i they don't know where that i were that it started in my body so therefore they don't they can't go get the mother of it all but god knows where that's at and i said god here's what i pray and the reason i brought those two children up here they were impossible to start off with it was impossible for those children to be born but there was a vision and people that think that god don't do those things no more god gave us a vision that we were going to have those children listen the signs are in the church now they're all over the world not just here but these signs shall follow them that believed we had tongues speaking here we had prophecy here just a couple of weeks ago it's operated in the church getting us ready for the rapture and i prayed the prayer lord don't let me have to go through this without this being the cycle breaker of my family when i got to the room the man behind me said that is the most precious prayer i have ever heard in my life i'm going to tell you something when they laid me on that bed that man laid his hand on me and he prayed for me he said i'm gonna pray you're gonna be okay they gave me two more shots of medicine to help me to calm down and then just before just before the surgery would begin to take place they would give me another shot and they say we want you to lay steel brother roger when they put me in that tube and started doing surgery on me they they said we're going to play music behind you what would you like to hear and i said i'd like to hear some piano gospel and i went to sleep in about three minutes of that pioneer gospel and about three minutes before the surgery was completely over i woke up to amazing grace how sweet the sun like sorry sometimes sermons become very personal i want you to say it with me again satan you underestimated us the standard feet we could have a prayer line for the people that's here that's got all kind of situations during your life some of them seem almost impossible could you just raise your hand if you're one of those yeah you're on the internet and you're in that situation too just just raise your
