in the Bible was they as they were beating him and they were putting them lashes on his back and I was trying my best to get to him and help him and I remember in that dream how real that dream was to me and and I wanted to get to him and and help my Lord Jesus and there was something holding me back and I was watching some people walk in the room and in that big space and I was thinking to myself surely they'll help him and they just walked right past him just totally ignored what was going on and I woke up that morning after that dream and I was just really overwhelmed by by that moment and

wedding yesterday for brother Seth and Sister Sarah Beth and and the Lord granted us a space in in the weather there and we just had a beautiful wedding and we just pray the Lord's blessings would shower them throughout their marriage I want to continue to lift up our pastor these this this weekend and next weekend while he's away that God would use in a very special way amen first Samuel chapter 17 and verse 4 and the Bible said and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and to span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass and he had Grieves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam and his Spears head weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him and he stood and cried under the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in Array and not I a Philistine and you servants to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he'd be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us and the Philistine said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together and when Saul and all of Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid Matthew chapter 27 and verse 26 amen Matthew chapter 27 and verse 26 then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a Scarlet robe and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying Hell King of the Jews and they spit upon him and took the Reed and smold him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own garment on him and led him away to crucify him as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross and when they were coming to a place called yagatha that is to say a place of a school may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord I would like to speak to you today upon a thought that the lord has laid upon our heart for this this weekend on silencing the champion silencing the champion and I don't know exactly where we will get this weekend or with this thought even tonight and even if it's in a spot I I'm going to get to a certain location here and to a destination and it doesn't matter if it takes me 15 minutes to get there or if it takes me an hour to get there I'm going to get there and it might be in an odd spot to leave Jesus in an odd spot to leave David but I'm going to get to a spot tonight and we'll just trust the Lord but as we said we'd like to speak to you on silencing the champion we see here that tonight that we have before us two great scenes that show us two great Champions that were set before the children that were set before the children of God these are champions that at that time had never lost a battle they had never went into a battle and ever thought about defeat but they were getting ready to you see the one that you're looking at is by the name of Goliath and the other one is by the name of death and we recognize that that Webster tells us that a champion is a man who undertakes a combat in the place or cause of another it also is a man who fights in his own calls or in a duel he is a hero He's a brave Warrior of one who is bold in contest as a champion for the truth it is also that to challenge to a combat a champion can be known to to challenge somebody to go to a combat and brother Brandon before he goes and breaks into the seals he preaches a very powerful message on the contest and he said he said you know that the Indian used to put a fire and they used to put a fire out there and they would have a tug of war and they would have a contest of strength to see which one had the most power they had one man on one side and one on the other and they put that fire right in the middle of them and the the one would pull the losing party across the fire he said but I want to speak to you for a few minutes quickly upon the greatest contest that there is that's between the church and Satan the great strength of Satan and we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church he said now this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the Earth and then it became and then he became an enemy to God's people and since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires or into his fires so notice those words that brother random said he tried he's tried to pull God's people that is he's trying to make an attempt to pull God's people into his own fires that he's built he said but we know that who has the most power God does and God when he give his people the best thing that he could ever to combat Satan with was his word now because the word is God and who's stronger than God so the word is God and the word becomes our strength let's say that together the word becomes I our strength so God in the church becomes its strength to both Satan to his own fires that he has made and the tug goes on because Jesus said in Mark 16 that in my name shall they cast out devils and these two Champions that we see sitting before us they had raised their voices one for 40 years and one for over four thousand years it had raised its voice One champion was the descendant of anak which was which was of those of the anakims and these Giants that were of The anakim Descendants they served in a capacity that was similar to what we would compare to a foreign mercenary these were men that you called out when you knew that you needed the battle to be won and this one that David is getting ready to face or the children of Israel is getting ready to face is one by the name of Goliath he's nine foot nine he's a monster of a man he's bigger than anybody that's in the building or standing on top of somebody else he had a head like a washed up he had a head like a wash tub he had eyes that was big as a bowl and his armor appeared unto all of the children of Israel to make him appear as if he was invisible a helmet that he had upon the wash tub was over 30 pounds the spearhead that he had upon the end of his of his spear weighed over 15 pounds this Joker had 200 pounds of armor upon him he had more armor upon him than what I physically weigh in my own human vessel so to appear this man had had a complete man that was setting upon him that was covering him and Goliath's name means to uncover or it means to reveal and Goliath went down there with a purpose to go down there and try to uncover that the god of Israel was not as strong as he was but we recognize that we understand the rest of the story that Goliath was getting ready to walk down into that on that battle as a champion for the very last time but we recognize that there was one thing that that that always when men would meet men like this there was one thing that always kept them from winning and it was death and we recognize that this other Champion by the name of death he had circled thee they circled the world for four thousand years ever since the Garden of Eden he had circled and he was looking for men that he could take by the way of the grave and they could no longer live amongst their kin they could no longer be amongst those that they loved and men would look look for a spot where they could get out of that spot of death even job would he would look upon the trees he would look upon the flowers he would look upon the natural world and he would wonder about these things he said I see the tree live again but man can man live again but one day there was a revelation that struck job's heart he said I know that my redeemer lives you see because when the Revelation struck job's heart he recognized that it wasn't just for the natural life it was for his life that he was going to be able to look past what happened the vision took job all the way on the other side of Easter because men had always looked for the ability to escape death but there was a this Champion by the name of death had never lost the battle you look at men throughout the Bible Great Men by the name of Moses of Abraham you look at Men by the name of Daniel even by the name of David they were Heroes of the faith that you read about in in Hebrews chapter 11 that we recognize that the Bible tells us that they cannot be perfect without you and I but we watch as those strong figures as they as they make their entrance into the scene of the Bible we recognize that death came by their way so even though they had a stature in God's mind even though they had abilities in God's mind even though they became anointed in the presence of the Living God would come upon their vessel and my goodness they would prophesy and they would speak things that would bring life to wounds they would speak things that would bring bring life to dead situations but they still bit went to a way by the way of the Grave because death was a doorway for them because we recognize that all the way back in the Garden of Eden that there God spoke to Adam and he told him said the day that you eat thereof that day you die now you know if you go to studying out Adam's life he didn't immediately die right there but death started working in his mortal bodies there was nobody that ever lived Methuselah was the oldest one that ever lived in the Bible times and he never met he never Rich the the space of a thousand years because of that Reign is for a special people hey people that have the abilities to walk out of every chaos and live you see because God was not going to allow anybody to get to that spot of life and to prove that they had a millennial Reign but God only has a select people that have the ability to Reign throughout the millennium but you notice that all of those victories that Joshua had and Moses had and and Abraham had when he was down there fighting for Lord and his family that thing's fighting me so I'm not going to fight it but and we recognize that all of their victories that they had that they they were simply temporal victories thought Moses he went right back in the bondage and Israel went right back into bondage again and they these Heroes say they fought and they died and they still do it in Wars today in the natural Focus but you notice that they continually finally come a thing that these men would fight they would win they would fight and they would win they would fight but then they'd come to a time when they came to a spot that death took them regardless it didn't matter what their statue was it didn't matter what their last name was death came by their way but they went right on still fighting and dying fighting and dying winning victories and dying winning victories and dying but you see that man was not made to die you see it doesn't matter how sick that you are it doesn't matter what condition that you get in there is something laying there in the germ of humanity that makes you want to fight to live you find people that are on their deathbed and they're they're right there and they're waiting for their last family member to come in there and say their last I love use what are they doing they are fighting to live until a certain spot so you see man was not made to die man was made to live it doesn't matter how many achievements he had he still died just the same and he went to the grave and they buried him and that settled it this Champion had won some battles this Champion had never lost a battle when it come to dealing with Humanity but there was going to come an hour when someone was going to challenge death and put it to a combat and the one that was going to meet him is going to say that I have power to lay my life down and I have power to raise it up again the one that is going to challenge death has the ability to say to death take your hands off of God's Property this one is going to be challenged and he is going to lose I'm not just talking about Goliath here I'm talking about death there was somebody that had the guts to go down into a valley there was somebody that was willing when everybody else was willing just to stand back and look at it and look at the fight and look at how the battle was set in a ray but there was somebody that was willing to cry that was willing to cry that was willing to climb that was willing to go through the pain willing to put put blood out of their own out of their own vessel so that somebody else could understand the meaning of life foreign but David said in Psalms 3 and 6 that I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about arise oh Lord Save Me O my God for thou has smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth through the Lord thy blessing is upon thy people Salah so notice there is there is somebody that is willing to go with you no matter what you're going through there is somebody that is willing to silence the voices in your life that say you can't make it but say you're not good enough that says you're not elect there's somebody that is in the room that wants to silence the voice of the champion of death of the Goliath of cancer that keeps screaming of the Goliath of depression or the Goliath of suicide or the thing that attaches itself to your liver or to your brain or to certain things or somebody that is wanting to be the champion of champions here tonight all right I want you to grab this picture I want you to grab this picture of Jesus standing in the midst of a crying mob you're in a spot right now where everybody here is your friend as far as I know there ain't nobody in here wanting to kill anybody in here maybe in the husband and wife maybe but you know there's nobody really in here that's in sincere danger here tonight but I want you to picture this here that that Jesus is in a spot where everybody is against him his own friends have denied him his own friends have walked away from him because Jesus is going to a spot that nobody else can go to because if you're going to ever have Victory you've got to have somebody that is willing to go to a spot that nobody else is willing to go to I want you to picture this in your mind that this one that is standing here in 16 elements that came through a virgin birth that that went through with through the Pains of coming out of his mother and coming out into this world and taking upon him the Robes of humanity so that you could understand the way that he understands the one I I present to you tonight that is standing here is none other than our Lord Jesus Christ he has the ability to turn a water into wine he has the ability to walk on Waters he has the ability to speak and things go out of their existence I want you to understand that the one that I'm speaking about In the Flesh has the ability to cast out devils and do the supernatural the one that I'm speaking to you about has the power over death when he walked to lazarus's grave he wept as a man but when he stood there in his robes as a dual nature human being standing there in the power of Jesus Christ ending there in his robes as a Son of God standing there be able to call death and show that death had met its maker this one Jesus has the ability to walk by the Widow of name's son and lay his hand upon upon the casket as it's walking by and bring life to it this man has the ability to cast demons out of legion this man has the ability to to look into things that the world cannot see he has the ability to put his hands upon something and bless it he has the ability to to feed five thousand he has the ability to preach sermons without speakers he has the ability to do all things because Jesus said all power in heaven and in Earth dwells on the inside of me there had never been anybody that was as good as our Lord Jesus Christ there was never been anybody that had ever walked upon the face of the Earth and said that if you destroy this hippo I raise it up again and everybody screaming crucify him crucify him the one that done all of these things that we just went through the one that saved your mother the one that saved your brother the one that helped you it's turning upon him what is it it is a release soul of devils that have been released in a moment of time to indict our Lord Jesus Christ to bring a curse upon him because the Bible said cursed is a man that hangs upon a tree and everybody has turned on him it's what they've done in this age they've turned on the word they say we want nothing to do with this word we want nothing to do with this what they call the message of the hour what are they doing they are again crucifying our Lord Jesus Christ they are putting him on trial before the rest of the world churches and their communes and their communism of the world he's sitting before them everybody in here if you don't mind doing something for me just start screaming real quick it's okay I'm giving you permission [Applause] now turn that voice to hatred can you stand where you're standing at when everybody hates you it was said that when Herod or pilate was standing there and he's watching the crowd and the crowd is screaming crucify him and it's screaming crucifying crucifying crucify him the only thing that pilate heard was Jesus is silence there's power and silence and your silence right now doesn't scare me but it next lets me know that you understand the power of Revelation because you're not on the side of those hollering crucify him they didn't realize what they were doing when they were crying crucify him and let his blood be upon us but when when Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini went after those Jews down there and those demonic Powers were released upon those upon them to get out upon them and anoint them to chase down those Jews what is it the Holocaust is going to be a picnic or the tribulation or the Holocaust is a picnic compared to what the tribulation is going to be like those demon powers that have been released by the river of Euphrates are going to come down and hunt out those foolish virgins but his silence was proof of Prophecy because Isaiah said that he stood before them dumb like the Sheep notice what the Bible said in Psalms 31 and 18 let the lying lips be put to silence which speak Grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous somebody is going to be a defeater of these champions now notice when he was here on Earth he was a great conqueror he said now now notice what brother random says here he said let's take a look at him just a moment he said there he goes up yargotha there's a noise in the street I can hear some of them say there goes that religious that religious fanatic thus goes the one who broke up our churches listen at them I can see him as he's going up the hill and his little old pale face is swole all swollen gobs of mockery is spit hanging from his beard a crown of thorns has been placed on his on his head and blood and and hot tears of Sorrow dripped off his cheek he's in that some way to conquer foreign men and women are not willing to conquer are not willing to suffer to conquer but it's the only suffering that you can conquer by there he goes every time the cross hits that little old Cobblestone his little shoulders were hurting and I noticed his robe was on his robe I noticed his robe has little Rich spots all over it and the further at the hill he goes those little spots get bigger and bigger and after a while they come to one great big bloody splotch and and his load beating you down I ditched his legs and the bee of death has begun to hum around him the sting of death he has got to taste it he must taste and when that bee began to hum around him he knew that death had laid just ahead of him but he must conquer that was the purpose he was born for was to conquer not with an atomic bomb but with a sacrifice life to Jehovah God here he is inhumanity and a flesh it didn't know sin but he took upon sin his intros are hanging out where they've took in the cat of nine tails and they've beat him this sure looks like a way to Victory don't it they hang him on a Roman Tree he placed him up on the cross and he's standing there trying to catch his breath he drops down to catch his breath as the blood begins to fill his lungs he raises back up father forgive him for they know not what they do but he's got somebody in his sight that he's looking for he's looking for the one that's called your grandmothers and your grandfathers by the way of the Grave he's looking for the one that has made your family history go down and have DNA Cycles up in them that they'll live with this certain condition where they have to battle alcoholism or they have to battle lust he's looking for that one and as Jesus is upon this cross there begin that one to begin to circle around the cross he said that's the one that I'm looking for he's looking for that champion that had never been defeated but there David is getting to a spot into the camp where all of a sudden there comes out one by the name of a Champion by the name of Goliath that is wanting to uncover that he has the greatest abilities that he has the powers to conquer every Earthly foe that come up against him he ain't never lost a battle he's a mercenary he's hired out for the job but this day was a different day for the camp of Israel because this time the Bible said when Dave or when Goliath begin to preach his message that David heard them I'm so glad that there was one by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that heard the message of Satan that said they'll never be able to get through they're never able to live again there was somebody that heard the voice of our adversary screaming at us he's still preaching the same message that he preached when they got down there in the valley send me somebody down here send me somebody down here and same devil still preaching the same message there is no power in healing there is no Holy Ghost there is no Comfort there is no Rapture the days of Miracles are passed but this day his message has failed on their own ears because Jesus is still Jesus it might look a little bit differently he's not robed in a Galilean robe but he's in the robe and the veil of humanity [Applause] David come to a spot that he said enough is enough because Goliath the Challenger thought that he was the greatest he thought that he was the greatest now let me say something to you if you have won some battles you have the ability to say that you are a champion thought and you have not lost you have the ability to say that I have combated in many of challenges and I've never lost a battle Ang Goliath was a warrior ever since he was born because he was born with the abilities to fight when you're built like a life's built you are called unto a purpose do you realize that depression has a purpose he's built for a purpose what is his purpose is to destroy everything that you think that you can become he's trying to keep you from your happiness he's trying to keep you from your joy he's trying to keep you from the the the the the the expressions of life he's built for a purpose and when you are built by like goliathius you're going to be used in Warfare and Goliath was built for a purpose but his purpose was not going to stand his purpose even though he had won even though he'd been battled even though he had all these all these scars over top of him probably had a gnarly looking scar over his face where men had had to try to get behind that 30 pound helmet probably scarred up and ugly as all get out you imagine a guy with the size of a face of a wash tub let me tell you Max Factor ain't got anything to make that guy look good the only thing that I know that can make that Goliath look any better than he does is a rock and there's somebody that's willing to go down into a valley and make sure that he gets the appearance that he's requested I believe there's somebody that recognizes that Goliath was built for a purpose or Depression was built for a purpose or anxiety was built for a purpose or pain in your body was built for a purpose but somebody recognizes that they've got to change the looks of their oppressor somebody is going to look upon this guy on this July this giant this Goliath and say I'm more than able there's somebody that's willing to take a sling to it but you see this giant didn't have a clue he thought he was the greatest but there was a little old boy on the other side of that Hill that had had a revelation that the God that he met was more than able that the God that he had met up there on the backside of that desert that had delivered him from the bear and had delivered him from The Lion was more than able to deliver him from the mouth of this uncircumcised for listing but you see every single time that God's people start to do something the enemy always has a challenge and a challenge for you and this prehistoric giant stood out there with 14 inch fingers on him and a spear in the head in his hand the size of a Weaver's needle this spear that he's got in his hand is over 20 foot tall he could just hold that thing out there and just poke fun at David you can't even get near me isn't that how the devil does you he makes you feel like like you're a puppet on a string that all he's got to do out there is reach out with his Weaver's needle and go out there and Cut You Down and you'll start collapsing isn't that how he does you that you're going to fall you're going to fall by this circumstance you're going to fall by this family tradition but you see that's what the enemy always does when he thinks he's got the upper hand upon you you see if that devil knows that there's somebody out there that really believes that they can have faith in their maker and they can conquer that brother random say that that devil will never do that when he looks out there and he sees that real conquering faith you see the devil recognizes when there's real faith and when there's an intellectual Faith let me tell you there was nobody that was willing to walk down into that Valley with their laptop or their iPad but there was somebody that was willing to go down to that Valley that had met God face to face somebody that knew what it was like to go through the fires and go through the floods and prove that God was still God come on somebody I don't face enough of these critics that all they want to do is sit behind their iPads and sit behind their keyboards but I'm a kind of guy that I know the kind of God that I serve and it's God of David he was God of Moses he was God of Paul he was God of William Branham and he's my God you might be serving a God that's a wimpy God that doesn't know how to show up to battle but the god that I'm serving is the kind of God that never leaves you where you are God did not bring you to this battle so that you could lose you're going out one way or never going out you're going out in Victory blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] he said he won't come near that real Sanctified holy life that's what shakes the devil I was reading today brother by name is he's going through a line of discernment and he's standing there and he says what about you sir sitting on the edge of your seat there he said I see you believing I see you believing for your need and he tells him his need and he said he said that kind of scared you he said you didn't realize you had that much faith in you and it might shock you tonight how much Faith you got sitting here how much power that you got sitting here you think when I just come into the building like I did every other weekend you had enough Faith to sit down in the chair you didn't test the chair out before you sat down in the chair you didn't test your car out before you went out there and started it you had enough faith to go out there and start the car come down the road you didn't come here we didn't come here and sit in all these chairs and say Well they're cable to hold about 200 pounds in each of them you simply had enough Faith to set down upon that chair well I don't know if I got faith or not that scared you didn't it that kind of shocked you that you had that kind of faith and you may not realize that you got the kind of Faith have the ability to go Goliath down into a valley and said I'm your Champion today it's time that you start silencing the voices in your life come on somebody you want him to be your protector voice your opinion to almighty God you want him to be your provider let him be a provider foreign it might shock you but if I was you I'd take a leap of faith but the enemy's always going to stand up there and taunt at you and hunt at you as long as he thinks he's got the edge on you but I'm like Paul said in Acts chapter 20 and 24 none of these things move me well I'm going through struggles and I'm going through pain you recognize that the Bible said in second Samuel 5 and 17 that when David was anointed king over Hebrew that the Philistines when they heard this they immediately started to seek after David let me tell you when you got something that's worth having you're going to have a contention you're going to have a Warfare on your hand and if you've got Holiness the devil's going to fight you for it if you've got a real clean atmosphere the devil's going to fight you for it but power is developed by resistance a Canon can only throw forth its power twice its power because of the exploding power of the resistance electricity is produced in a Powerhouse Yonder by sharp friction of the revolving of the wheels and the presence and the the afflictions that you've gone through you are going to turn around and say that Satan was used to be your blessing what am I saying to you I'm saying that everything that you're going through it's worth fighting for let me tell you if Holiness is worth fighting for if it's worth having then somebody's got to fight for it come on somebody if mamas and daddies if the Holy Ghost is worth having you got to fight for it come on if we want to if we want to look like the world and dress like the world it shows that something is missing on the inside of us because the enemy's going to stay there as long as you let him stay there come on young girls your Holiness is worth fighting for come on mamas and daddies [Applause] your abilities to be men and to be women is worth fighting for brother Bynum said cut every enemy if an old spook oh Spirit make you feel he said cut that thing away he said with the word of the Lord he said but our strength the joy of the Lord is my strength so what you've got to do is every enemy that you come up against you've got to cut him down by the word of the Lord and say get away from me whack cut him you've got to cut him with a word whether it be a demon whether it be an enemy whether it be sickness whether it be disease whatever it is take that word and pull it with a sword and if you whack it the first time and it don't seem to move whack it again and whack it again and whack it again and whack it until you chipped a hole right through like a chicken or an eagle pooping its way through pimp yourself right on through that old Shell of sickness cut your way out and say hallelujah where's the next one that's the battle there's a soldier that's the soldier of the Cross knock out every enemy but the enemy's always standing around wanting to give a compromise I tell you what you do I'll come down here and fight and you send me somebody else out here that you think's worthy enough to fight me what is he looking for he's looking for a way out but I'll say that it's time that you serve notice on the devil I'd say we're not compromising I'll tell you what he does he'll show you something out there in the world and say that it's okay for you to bring into the house of the Lord what is he wanting you to do he's wanting you to compromise he want to compromise on your dress he'll compromise on your spirit he'll compromise on your worship he'll compromise on your prayer life he will make you compromise well you know what you prayed yesterday morning and you've had enough time with the Lord let me tell you if Suzanne Wesley had 17 children and she had enough time to go out there into a river and go out there and clean 17 children their clothes and get out there and pray two or three hours a day she didn't have the ability to press a button but she had the ability to serve God she didn't dabble in the things of the world she began to serve the Lord what is it worth I'll tell you what it's worth it produced one of the greatest songwriters that's ever been and It produced a church-aged messenger by the name of John Wesley well you say well I don't know what I'm going to do I will say this that your prayer life might be the prayer that changes the situation in these young people's lives God keep our young people God protects him keep them with a standard of Holiness like never before I'll say that that prayer is worth praying but he wants you to compromise this might be a little bit strange but in 1996 there was a there was a baseball convention that took down in Nashville Tennessee down at the Opryland hotel and there was over four four thousand four thousand uh baseball coaches all the way from Little League all the way to Major League Baseball that came and they were having this great convention and all these coaches are sitting there and they come here with the anticipation to hear some of the greatest baseball coaches that had ever been some of the greatest trainers that have had learned certain techniques and they they come to the the climax of the meeting and they were talking about they were talking about who's going to be the evening speaker and there was a man there was a coach by the name of John scoilenis that that is known for being a football coach and a baseball coach and he's he's got an unlimited wealth or unlimited knowledge in the in the world of baseball and men were looking forward to hearing him speaking and so they had all of the events of the evening and as John comes up there and he's standing there before all of these thousands of people and they're under great anticipation we're going to hear how that better we're going to hear how how to have I have better home runs going to hear all of these things and and John comes up there and he stands behind the podium but when they get up there when John gets up there he's got this string around his neck got this string around his neck and on his up on the bottom that string he's got a full-size home-based plate there hanging off of his neck and everybody begins to chuckle and laugh about it and John gets up there and he speaks for 25 minutes and everybody's like man this dude says I lost it he's giving he's giving his speech but everybody can't pay no attention to his speech because he's got this home plate that's hanging around his neck he said now I know y'all think I'm old and y'all think I'm crazy he said but I want to teach you something about baseball that I've learned throughout the lessons of life and he said now he said uh anybody in here know how wide and Little League baseball home plate is and somebody they they begin to roam around all those thousands of people that are sitting there and they said somebody said is it 17 17 inches wide he said that's right and so he said now what about those up here in that League of baseball uh or Babe Ruth Babe Ruth league he said how wide is that home plate up there he said uh somebody said well I'm 17 inches he said you're right he said now what about in high school when he asked the same question 17 inches what about up there in college up here at the college League he said is it is it how wide is it he said 17 inches he gets up there he goes on up to minor league baseball he said how wide is a home plate base he said 17 inches and you know everybody's catching on hey it's 17 inches he said what about what about those a bear in pro baseball how wide is the home plate in pro baseball he said 17 inches he said now what do we do if we get a pro baseball pitcher that cannot hit the target over 17 inches he said what do we do he said do we say well you know what since you're so great and you can throw 99 mile an hour we'll compromise on it a little bit and we'll get you a 20 inch plate or a 25 inch plate he said no what you're going to do is you're going to send him back to training he said but what do we do he said coaches what do we do when we have one of our best players come into our midst and we've asked them to dress a certain way and they don't dress that way if we've asked them to be clean saving and they come out with a full beard what do we do he said what do we do if we catch them out there drinking or catch them out there smoking because they're our best player do we just uh do we change the rules so that they can fit in or do we do we make them accountable for what they're doing so just because you can't hit the target we don't change the status and just because you're living the type of life that you're living and you don't have the results of the power of Holiness doesn't mean that the message changes we didn't change the message to fit you we didn't change the dress where we didn't change the way that we look just to fit you the message came don't widen the plate preach the message leave the message be the message read your Bible pray don't widen the plate mamas and daddies don't make it easy for them preach the message come on somebody if it was good for William Branham it's good in my household [Music] [Applause] come on somebody we're not widening the plate we're not compromising we know we got a message that'll hit the targets Hallelujah don't wide in the place don't make it easier on them preach the truth let's stand somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the devil's wanting you to compromise the Devils want you to listen to him I'm gonna pick this up in the morning but if you leave Goliath setting where he's sitting you're going to end up like Saul without an anointing you got one job I left that better than I thought I was going to leave it I thought I was going to have David down in the valley all night I think y'all be able to sleep better with him up here on the hill right amen it's the word of the Lord isn't it this is more some baseball clinic is his life this is life and I'll tell you what you got young people it's worth having so why Satan is trying his best get you to look like the world dress like the world [Music] he wants you to be like an Esther I said let me let me match the masterpiece let me find him and if I can look at him I don't have to stretch one scripture I don't have to adjust it down because the Bible said in the beginning of the book in the middle of the book and at the end of the book said If any man adds or takes away his part shall be taken from him you see what you're doing when you're widen it or you're stretching it or you're trying to make it say this or say that you're taking away the authority of it you said well brother Andrew I want you to I want you to help my young person or help my daughter help them help them have overcoming life let me preach the message let me preach the message [Applause] it might hurt [Applause] but David all the training that you're going through says that you're more than able to walk down there and do the job God bless you tonight as we sing a song [Music] we'll let you be dismissed tonight come expecting hope I didn't leave you hanging too much air and I believe you're well studied enough to know we got a battle on our hands amen God bless you tonight brother Matthew [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh he's greater than the great [Music] is Crown away and he's more Mighty than the mightiest and he reigns from above for he's the old time free champion of love he is higher than the highest and he heart all the highest or he's greater than the great and no one could ever take his crown away [Music] Mighty then my tears and she raised oh he's the old time [Music] oh victory is mine will victory is mine oh Victory today it is [Music] Victory today is my Victory is my jewelry is I'm [Music] Satan you better get thee behind cause of Victory today it is Mississippi oh joy it is [Music] it is it is [Music]
