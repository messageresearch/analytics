[58:33] important it is to not a gettin out of
[58:36] order and when God created the animals
[58:41] and he created everything man comes
[58:44] along and destroys one one part of a
[58:47] specie but that that specie has a real
[58:51] important part and then brother Branham
[58:55] said nobody can take your place I don't
[59:01] think about that just a moment nobody
[59:04] can take your place brother John if if
[59:10] you decide to step aside and say you
[59:14] know I don't care anymore
[59:16] what about your boys it's generational
[59:22] what about your children what about your
[59:26] children's children the children's
[59:29] children's children's children well we
[59:32] know that God will watch over his seed
[59:35] because he's got a plan I thought about
[59:42] brother Joe said in here brother Homer
[59:47] but this church has meant at this place
[59:52] but the home were working in a stockroom
[59:56] an inviting brother Joe and brother Joe
[1:00:03] which I don't know some of your new he's
[1:00:06] one of the most brilliant men I've ever
[1:00:08] met in my life
[1:00:10] he's like EF Hutton if he says that I I
[1:00:14] write it down and so brother Joe was
[1:00:22] invited to church and he says he's made
[1:00:25] a determination if I go to the service
[1:00:29] tonight and if I don't see brother homer
[1:00:32] outside I'm not going in and something
[1:00:35] nudges brother Homer to go outside and
[1:00:38] stand on the porch you think god don't
[1:00:42] care about you he said what does that
[1:00:48] have to do it has a whole lot to do with
[1:00:51] the baby dedication this morning God's
[1:00:55] watched over your lineage he's watched
[1:00:59] over your seed and and toward the end of
[1:01:03] the message brother Branham preaches a
[1:01:05] sermon called
[1:01:06] and it's just a little little little
[1:01:09] sermon but it's powerful one in a
[1:01:13] million
[1:01:16] one in a million
[1:01:18] if you haven't if you haven't read it
[1:01:20] lately go reread it God washed over that
[1:01:24] one cell in a million no funeral for the
[1:01:31] 999 no funeral but he's watched over
[1:01:42] that seat he's protected that Saint
[1:01:49] William to watch over you watched over
[1:01:54] that everything has an order how great
[1:02:04] it is

[1:17:23] had I'm not steady in my eyes anymore
[1:17:26] and so they don't let me drive Matt
[1:17:29] might be a great thing and so and then
[1:17:31] some days I'm not steady in my vision
[1:17:34] which causes me to be dizzy but my
[1:17:37] family is very very wonderful to me
[1:17:43] and you're a wonderful audience forgive

[1:18:30] Day to you and we love you with all of
[1:18:33] our hearts and and I'd like to speak to
[1:18:38] you this morning the best of my ability
[1:18:41] that he will give me
[1:18:42] I must get to Jesus and I want to preach
[1:18:55] this with a personal Flair
[1:19:04] I felt like a fella said can I do this
[1:19:09] can I do it but today as a sermon I want
[1:19:15] to preach it this way I'm the one that's
[1:19:19] got to get there I gotta get to him this
[1:19:27] is life and death I gotta get to him
[1:19:35] brother Branham said this he says
[1:19:40] there's no one cares not Jesus knowing
[1:19:48] that his body as a high priest in a
[1:19:54] mediatorial work that he's doing now
[1:19:58] that body must be in the presence of God
[1:20:04] at all times for intercession that God
[1:20:08] cannot see the sinners sin he only sees
[1:20:14] the blood of his own son and knowing
[1:20:18] that he sent back the holy spirit to
[1:20:21] continue to work comfort his people does
[1:20:27] he care certainly he cares he says now
[1:20:33] he was to continue to care for the
[1:20:36] people his people here on the earth in
[1:20:40] the same manner that he cared for him
[1:20:43] them when he was here and I believe that
[1:20:50] he's the same God for me right now
[1:20:52] brother Greg and maybe you're sick
[1:20:56] wherever you're at and maybe you're in
[1:20:58] the same need that where I'm at now and
[1:21:01] say he cares for brother Ron you cared
[1:21:04] for me and means how many it's got a
[1:21:07] need this morning you just like to say
[1:21:09] you care for me
[1:21:12] a man a man mark chapter five and verse
[1:21:21] 21 and when Jesus passed over again by
[1:21:30] the Shipman to the other side that much
[1:21:32] people gathered under him and he was
[1:21:37] nigh unto the sea and behold there
[1:21:43] cometh one of the rulers of the
[1:21:45] synagogue
[1:21:45] Jarius my name and when he saw him he
[1:21:49] fell at his feet and besought him
[1:21:51] greatly saying my little daughter lieth
[1:21:56] at the point of death and I I pray they
[1:22:00] come and lay thy hands on her that she
[1:22:04] may be healed and she shall live and
[1:22:08] Jesus went with him and much people
[1:22:11] followed and thrown him on a certain
[1:22:14] woman which had an issue of blood twelve
[1:22:17] years and he suffered many things of
[1:22:21] great physicians that had spent old and
[1:22:26] she had spent all that she had and
[1:22:30] nothing bettered but rather grew worse
[1:22:34] so this was a last resort and when she
[1:22:40] had heard of Jesus compressing behind
[1:22:43] touched His garment and she said if I
[1:22:46] may touch but his clothes I shall behold
[1:22:49] you talking about desperation and
[1:22:53] straightway the fountain of blood was
[1:22:55] dried up and she felt in her body that
[1:22:58] she was healed of that plague and Jesus
[1:23:02] immediately knowing in himself that
[1:23:04] virtue had gone out of him turned him
[1:23:08] about in the press and said who touched
[1:23:11] my clothes and the disciple said unto
[1:23:15] Him thou seest the multitude thronging
[1:23:19] thee and sayest thou who touched me
[1:23:23] and he look around about to see because
[1:23:27] he cared that's why he looked he cared
[1:23:33] to see what had been done by this thing
[1:23:36] and the woman fearing and trembling
[1:23:39] knowing what was done and came and fell
[1:23:43] down before him and told him all the
[1:23:44] truth and he said unto her daughter thy
[1:23:49] faith hath made thee whole
[1:23:51] go in peace and behold of thy plague
[1:23:58] notice that in that moment 12 years of
[1:24:04] agonizing in that moment the very
[1:24:08] elements of her body were changed and
[1:24:16] while he yet spake there was a ruler of
[1:24:18] the synagogue's house certain which said
[1:24:24] they daughter is dead why troubled the
[1:24:27] master in him any further and as soon as
[1:24:32] Jesus as soon as Jesus heard the word
[1:24:39] that was spoken he said to the ruler of
[1:24:43] the synagogue be not afraid you talking
[1:24:48] about being in control of a situation
[1:24:53] there's a theme that's going on here
[1:24:57] look past what you see think pass what
[1:25:02] you think and Jesus is standing with the
[1:25:07] decide with this man and he's just
[1:25:11] gotten news that his daughter has died
[1:25:16] and Jesus's whole journey is to go to
[1:25:20] his house and if I'm on the way to the
[1:25:25] house no matter her condition she's
[1:25:31] going to be well
[1:25:33] and if he put this on my heart for weeks
[1:25:40] he's on the weight of this house and I
[1:25:47] may be weak to preach this sermon but
[1:25:50] I'm going to be well
[1:26:03] the spring Almighty God we love you with
[1:26:08] all of our hearts today and Lord that
[1:26:14] some things are way bigger than us and
[1:26:19] you're a great God and so not only for
[1:26:23] myself but there's needs that I'm
[1:26:25] carrying from around the world to this
[1:26:29] pulpit today that are burdened on my
[1:26:32] heart I ask you that you would touch
[1:26:36] those needs stretch forth your hand of
[1:26:40] mercy and go beyond the realm of my own
[1:26:43] flesh now and bring me strength to be
[1:26:47] able to preach one X again help me
[1:26:51] Father I ask you now in Jesus name Amen
[1:26:55] amen you can be seated I want to just
[1:27:02] catch a couple of scriptures if I may or
[1:27:05] a couple of quotes if I may in parts of
[1:27:07] them brother Branham is preaching in a
[1:27:10] very important meeting in Tacoma and he
[1:27:15] and the title of his sermon was he was
[1:27:18] to pass this way now sometimes you think
[1:27:24] well that's just a sermon title no
[1:27:26] that's an event
[1:27:29] Jesus is passing this way not 2,000
[1:27:35] years ago he's not a historical God
[1:27:41] death but he's using his prophet as a
[1:27:45] divine seer and he's standing in a
[1:27:48] pulpit
[1:27:49] and he's saying some words Jesus is to
[1:27:53] pass this way and then in the paragraph
[1:27:58] 37 he says Zack is a set in the tree and
[1:28:03] he raised his leaf and he began to look
[1:28:06] and Jesus walked along with his head
[1:28:09] borrowed and he stopped all at once
[1:28:16] and he looked up in a tree and he said
[1:28:19] Zacchaeus come down out of that tree I'm
[1:28:25] going home with you today of all the
[1:28:30] people in the city of all the people in
[1:28:36] the city he picks him because of a wife
[1:28:43] at home because of the predestinated
[1:28:49] seed that fell in love with Jesus's
[1:28:54] ministry and she's prayed that God would
[1:28:58] get a hold of her husband brother
[1:29:06] brother Masood he knew his name he knew
[1:29:10] his heart and he's the same yesterday
[1:29:14] today and forever he's that same God
[1:29:18] here right now all brethren but this is
[1:29:22] just another service is it I want you to
[1:29:31] just notice brother Denny there's
[1:29:34] something about when you're in the
[1:29:36] presence of Jesus you know there
[1:29:39] sometimes you think well if I was in the
[1:29:41] presence of a a great man I'd like to
[1:29:48] ask him some questions and then all the
[1:29:56] sudden you you're there in your mind's
[1:29:58] blank a lot of people said that about
[1:30:01] being around brother branham they'd have
[1:30:03] a lot of questions about when they were
[1:30:05] in that presence
[1:30:06] everything was just blank
[1:30:17] you can't be in Jesus's presence and
[1:30:19] never ever be the same now I'm not
[1:30:23] talking about being the presence of a
[1:30:25] church and I'm not talking about being
[1:30:29] in the presence of a pastor or influence
[1:30:31] of a man I'm talking about being in the
[1:30:33] presence of Jesus but the brand would
[1:30:37] caution people in the presence of that
[1:30:39] angel now there's something standing
[1:30:42] between you and I listen it would change
[1:30:46] their life forever decades had passed
[1:30:51] and they lived maybe decades 50 60 years
[1:30:55] and they walk on the prayer line and and
[1:30:58] in that moment everything's different
[1:31:03] everything's different and in that
[1:31:07] moment when you meet Jesus and I'm
[1:31:10] talking about really meeting it you know
[1:31:14] I you know I've been around a while now
[1:31:16] and you see people do a lot of petty
[1:31:20] things and you get you you know
[1:31:23] sometimes you as an audience get real
[1:31:25] concerned about people you see things
[1:31:27] still hanging in their lives and trivial
[1:31:30] things are happening and they go this
[1:31:33] way that way it's because they haven't
[1:31:35] met Jesus but once you fall in love with
[1:31:39] Jesus it cleans you up always all those
[1:31:44] things still hanging on don't worry if
[1:31:47] they get in the presence of Jesus
[1:31:49] interchange their life you know what's
[1:31:53] wrong with American Europe right now
[1:31:56] they really didn't meet Jesus God sent
[1:32:01] him a prophet but they didn't meet Jesus
[1:32:04] and what's going on in the streets of
[1:32:08] America and our politics in the White
[1:32:10] House I take a pill they call it a pill
[1:32:14] at home why it's called truth pill I'll
[1:32:16] tell you what's going on I'm gonna use
[1:32:19] that pill just now
[1:32:22] we're reaping what we've sowed will reap
[1:32:27] in what we've sowed we've got precedents
[1:32:31] that don't know Jesus
[1:32:33] we've got statesmen that don't know
[1:32:36] Jesus they took this book out
[1:32:45] they decided they didn't need this in
[1:32:48] their schools or they don't mean it in
[1:32:50] their government and they sewed never
[1:32:58] gonna read there's no stopping it it's
[1:33:05] headed to a Tribulation Period it's
[1:33:10] headed to a Tribulation Period in there
[1:33:12] and that's where it's going but this
[1:33:15] message has built you for this hour my
[1:33:23] brother on my mind is so much on
[1:33:25] everything that's around hey listen
[1:33:29] don't get your eyes on that they're
[1:33:33] tearing down statues they're doing that
[1:33:37] in Europe they're doing that in the
[1:33:39] Philippines they're doing that all over
[1:33:41] the earth because it's a tribulation
[1:33:44] move it's the children of the wicked
[1:33:49] we're headed to a lawless Society and
[1:33:53] the reason we're headed to a lawless
[1:33:56] society is because they turned down
[1:33:59] Jesus and when you turn down the
[1:34:03] headship of the word before long you
[1:34:07] start throwing stones at the Prophet a
[1:34:11] few years ago they were throwing stones
[1:34:14] at brother branham and then they started
[1:34:17] tearing up their Bibles
[1:34:24] and then there's throwing stones at
[1:34:26] ministry now they're tearing down George
[1:34:33] Washington and Columbus Winston
[1:34:39] Churchill in Europe and they're tearing
[1:34:42] down all these statues all over the
[1:34:45] place but they're going to get a king
[1:34:50] you see there's two kings coming to the
[1:34:53] earth less two teens coming you thought
[1:34:59] I didn't have anything to do with this
[1:35:01] but there's two kings coming Jesus came
[1:35:04] under Zacchaeus history King was coming
[1:35:09] the intercessor was coming he's come
[1:35:13] today and King Jesus is coming back to
[1:35:19] earth again there's a broad that's
[1:35:22] waiting on him
[1:35:23] [Applause]
[1:35:31] but there's another king that's going to
[1:35:33] sit during the Tribulation Period and
[1:35:37] he's going to be king over this chaos
[1:35:44] are you with me
[1:35:46] you think it's chaos man you take this
[1:35:53] bride off of the earth you get a better
[1:35:59] get ready Jesus has come you better get
[1:36:04] ready Jesus is coming
[1:36:13] Zacchaeus went when he went when he when
[1:36:19] he had Jesus to his house he said Lord I
[1:36:23] if I if I robbed any I'll make it good
[1:36:29] I'll do anything I love that words I
[1:36:36] love that two more examples before we
[1:36:44] get into the scripture there was a woman
[1:36:49] that brother Branham talks about an
[1:36:53] incredible amount of time and especially
[1:36:57] in the unwelcome Christ and here's what
[1:37:03] brother Branham says she said I want the
[1:37:07] best alabaster box that you've got in
[1:37:13] this place I want the best cleats the
[1:37:23] money and when that man sees the money
[1:37:26] it's different now I want the best that
[1:37:31] you've got and here's what I want to say
[1:37:38] I want to give God the best I don't want
[1:37:49] to be this place to be ever be a place
[1:37:51] to where we come and they've become a
[1:37:54] social agenda this Father's Day let's
[1:38:11] rededicate our lives but I want this
[1:38:13] place to become a place like never
[1:38:16] before that Jesus is welcome here the
[1:38:24] Jesus of this message is welcomed here
[1:38:27] to live and this message is more than
[1:38:30] just a good recipe or a good formula you
[1:38:39] can know this message from the beginning
[1:38:42] from 47 to 65 and all the way back but
[1:38:47] if it don't live on Monday Tuesday
[1:38:50] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
[1:38:52] Sunday I wanted to live I want to live
[1:39:00] and you may not be able to quote a quote
[1:39:03] but that doesn't matter let it live in
[1:39:08] your life he's worthy of the best
[1:39:20] Chris he's worthy of our best what do
[1:39:25] you do - for him give him you give him
[1:39:29] the leftover and you run around and you
[1:39:32] give him three minutes a night or before
[1:39:34] you go to bed he deserves your best he
[1:39:41] deserves everything that you've got what
[1:39:45] you what are you going to do about it he
[1:39:47] said give him everything you you just
[1:39:51] give him anything and he takes it he
[1:39:54] takes it anyway but she said I want the
[1:39:59] best he said it cost her everything and
[1:40:11] here's what I want to do with that quote
[1:40:16] on December the 22nd when God dealt with
[1:40:20] me he asked me for my life
[1:40:36] and we could talk about a lot of
[1:40:39] miracles that have happened in in our
[1:40:41] inner church here but on that visitation
[1:40:48] God asked me to trust him with my life
[1:40:59] my life
[1:41:24] Andrew last night my doing okay
[1:41:31] I missed something there sometimes we we
[1:41:42] trust him with our money but money comes
[1:41:50] and goes
[1:41:52] maybe we trust him with the car or a
[1:41:55] house but that'll it's temporary but
[1:42:01] when we're talking about our being
[1:42:10] here's what I here's what I missed
[1:42:14] sometimes when it's a friend or a family
[1:42:21] member or somebody that's real close to
[1:42:24] us it gets real close to the heart it
[1:42:27] gets real emotional but it makes a
[1:42:35] phenomenal amount of difference when
[1:42:41] it's you
[1:42:46] how many how many times have you heard I
[1:42:50] was listening to her to a prayer request
[1:42:54] that went across brother Donnie Reagan's
[1:42:58] pulpit the other night and it was a
[1:43:02] request about a person that was getting
[1:43:05] ready to be tested for cancer and then I
[1:43:10] heard it a prayer request for here and
[1:43:13] someone was here was getting ready to be
[1:43:15] tested for cancer and sister Mike walls
[1:43:23] she she's in between her biopsy now and
[1:43:28] and the test for cancer heme he's been
[1:43:31] in that boat before the test for cancer
[1:43:35] and then it's coming that dread can you
[1:43:41] attach with me that dread between that
[1:43:44] point and this point that two weeks or
[1:43:50] whatever it is it's phenomenal it's
[1:43:56] almost overwhelming and then the doctors
[1:44:01] report that says you have cancer how
[1:44:06] many's been there you can attach now
[1:44:17] going in and out of the Cancer Center
[1:44:19] has been very I remembered sister Connie
[1:44:22] walking off of the elevator and she just
[1:44:25] about the first time she just about
[1:44:28] hyperventilated which she saw everybody
[1:44:31] that was sitting there because in that
[1:44:34] moment it's come to your house remember
[1:44:41] that moment
[1:44:44] it's now at your house here here about
[1:44:54] eight weeks ago brother Nathaniel sister
[1:44:58] su you were there we were in the
[1:45:01] emergency department and they called the
[1:45:04] voice and they're telling us that we
[1:45:08] have brain cancer and sister Connie
[1:45:13] doubles her head between her legs she
[1:45:21] literally puts her head between her legs
[1:45:26] it's no longer on paper
[1:45:38] and walking the floor last week and
[1:45:40] walking down the aisle and the guy
[1:45:45] that's with me and we just begin to talk
[1:45:49] and he said well you you know it's
[1:45:51] spreading it just looks at me and he
[1:45:55] said it's just cancer I thought about
[1:46:02] this sermon that will only be a few more
[1:46:06] minutes but it's hot now here's what I
[1:46:13] want to say this to you
[1:46:14] we don't want pity we don't want you to
[1:46:22] feel sorry for us we want to tell you
[1:46:25] and I want to tell you this morning the
[1:46:28] doctors headed to my house
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:40] said all right that's what I wanted to
[1:46:44] do it with I want to tell you he's left
[1:46:47] the boat I want to tell you there's a
[1:46:52] woman that has touched the hem of His
[1:46:54] garment and she was made whole I want to
[1:46:59] tell you that my messenger that was that
[1:47:02] had left the house and maybe you've give
[1:47:06] up and maybe you've thought it you know
[1:47:10] there's no hope I can only imagine
[1:47:13] Jarius as he's leaving the house and he
[1:47:16] looks over at his daughter and he's
[1:47:19] tried everything his religion hasn't
[1:47:22] worked out I remember in China it would
[1:47:29] be one of the last phenomenal meetings
[1:47:33] and I remember as I standing beside her
[1:47:37] brother Murphy Wang and I'm preaching
[1:47:39] and I'm preaching on Jesus has come to
[1:47:43] this house and it came and maybe you've
[1:47:49] thought it cabal has been written over
[1:47:51] the door and maybe you thought that
[1:47:53] you're dying and life's not going to go
[1:47:57] on anymore
[1:47:58] but Jesus is on his way and you may be
[1:48:04] at that spot this morning - were that
[1:48:07] you feel like this nobody can help me
[1:48:11] there's nobody that could turn this
[1:48:14] around for me I'm living in dispersed
[1:48:18] this way it's always gonna be let me
[1:48:20] just say put your hat on this morning
[1:48:23] and go find Jesus
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:36] when he looked over this little girl
[1:48:39] laying there maybe he thought in his own
[1:48:42] mind I've done the best as a father that
[1:48:45] I can do and here it is Father's Day but
[1:48:49] I've done everything that I can do for
[1:48:51] you baby doll and if this moment is the
[1:48:54] last goodbye honey I love you
[1:48:57] but I must it to Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:49:34] [Applause]
[1:49:43] [Applause]
[1:50:00] no doubt
[1:50:01] critics were standing outside of his
[1:50:03] house were you going
[1:50:08] it didn't matter no doubt there was
[1:50:13] people there that was full of doubt but
[1:50:16] today they didn't matter no doubt there
[1:50:21] were people that were saying a lot of
[1:50:22] things but it don't matter all they've
[1:50:28] got it's just stuff to say but God does
[1:50:33] everything well Janice gets there in
[1:50:37] time to see a woman that it's been 12
[1:50:41] years and in that moment the chemicals
[1:50:46] of her body changes that's more
[1:50:51] important than fishes and loaves that's
[1:50:55] more important than literally the water
[1:50:57] into wine the chemicals of her body
[1:51:01] changes and she walks into a service and
[1:51:05] says if I can touch the hem of His
[1:51:08] garment it don't matter who else is in
[1:51:13] the building
[1:51:14] I've just got to get to word that I can
[1:51:16] touch the hem of His garment I don't
[1:51:18] mean any further on the say anything to
[1:51:20] me I don't mean to call me by my name
[1:51:23] but if I can touch the hem of his
[1:51:26] garment if we would come with that kind
[1:51:42] of an expectation to the services and
[1:51:49] walk out the walk in these doors and put
[1:51:53] everything that we've got on the line
[1:51:55] for this service
[1:51:58] it will take care of those little
[1:52:00] problems in your home it will take care
[1:52:06] of those weaknesses that you've got from
[1:52:08] week to week to week to week to week if
[1:52:10] you just lay it all on the line they'll
[1:52:15] hold nothing back just lay it on the
[1:52:17] line and just say this service is going
[1:52:20] to change my life and when I leave here
[1:52:23] today I'm gonna be different I don't
[1:52:27] know what the service is gonna do for
[1:52:28] other people but when I sit in my peel
[1:52:32] touch the hem of this garment I'm gonna
[1:52:41] be well jesus knows who Jarius is cuz he
[1:52:55] knows who you are he don't need a real
[1:52:59] formal introduction he's the reason God
[1:53:04] always has a reason God always has a
[1:53:08] purpose he's always got a plan he's
[1:53:13] always got a plan sometimes we get all
[1:53:19] nervous about situations and you think
[1:53:22] well how is that ever going to be or
[1:53:31] he's got a plan he don't start and then
[1:53:38] quit now I won't be just a couple more
[1:53:43] minutes
[1:53:46] and Jesus is on his way and Jerry's is
[1:53:53] talking to the woman is healed and
[1:53:59] somebody comes and says don't trouble
[1:54:03] the master don't trouble it
[1:54:09] your daughter's dead Jesus can go
[1:54:20] somewhere else that he's needed
[1:54:33] this is important so I want to get it to
[1:54:36] you now Jesus knows that if I'm going to
[1:54:41] his house she's going to live so what
[1:54:49] this messenger has just come and told
[1:54:53] Jarius don't matter but Jarius is like
[1:54:58] Ron Spencer a lot of times sometimes you
[1:55:04] don't know the plan because you can't
[1:55:07] see way down the road and brother Joe
[1:55:11] you couldn't see the baby dedication
[1:55:14] this morning many years ago but God had
[1:55:17] a plan did you get that did you get that
[1:55:25] God's watching over his seed when you
[1:55:28] can't watch over them in your prayers
[1:55:31] sometimes you're praying this is ever
[1:55:33] gonna work out but God's got a plan and
[1:55:52] Jesus
[1:55:55] be not afraid
[1:56:01] be not afraid
[1:56:05] be not afraid isn't it awesome when God
[1:56:14] steadies us isn't it awesome when God
[1:56:24] just turns around to us and he tells us
[1:56:29] I got this some of you've been there
[1:56:39] done that you know what I'm saying right
[1:56:41] now I got this God sometimes does things
[1:56:49] for us that that it's just nice it's
[1:56:54] just nice you just go I'm prayed for
[1:57:01] things for years and it's and it all
[1:57:03] just all the sudden happens and then
[1:57:07] it's disco wasn't that nice what not
[1:57:11] just nice
[1:57:22] I got a ring on my finger it's my class
[1:57:24] ring and maybe it's the first time
[1:57:26] you've ever seen me wear it but I lost
[1:57:31] this ring about two years ago two three
[1:57:36] years ago and periodically I'll go look
[1:57:39] for it because there's times I just feel
[1:57:42] like there's tons I feel like what is
[1:57:46] where it's my class ring and it's it was
[1:57:50] it's made exactly like my mother's class
[1:57:53] ring and so I just like to wear it
[1:57:58] well I'd lost it and I searched the
[1:58:02] world over and I lost it and so Connie
[1:58:08] is going to give crystal a pocketbook I
[1:58:12] said okay I'll tell you that
[1:58:14] Toula and so it's gonna give her a
[1:58:18] pocketbook so she shakes it and she
[1:58:20] shakes it and she shakes it and that'll
[1:58:23] tell you how long it's been since she
[1:58:24] used it but she's shaking it and she's
[1:58:26] shaking it and she's shaking it this
[1:58:29] week and a lot of stuff falls out of it
[1:58:32] she puts her hand down in it and she
[1:58:34] runs it and and she comes hollering
[1:58:37] through the house look what I found
[1:58:40] [Applause]
[1:58:49] I put it on my finger and thought about
[1:58:55] what it meant for this week and I
[1:58:59] thought it meant nice because that which
[1:59:14] was lost now is found and the life that
[1:59:31] has left that little girl and seemed to
[1:59:35] have escaped her lungs and now her
[1:59:40] spirit is going out into the realm of
[1:59:42] the spirit world
[1:59:44] Jesus has got ahold of it and he knows
[1:59:52] how to bring it right back to her and
[1:59:55] put it right back in her body
[1:59:58] [Applause]
[2:00:09] hallelujah lujah and the God that note
[2:00:17] this trial before it ever began knows
[2:00:22] how to take the strength from Ron
[2:00:25] Spencer's body and reach and grab ahold
[2:00:30] of it and put it right back into that
[2:00:34] body
[2:00:35] [Applause]
[2:00:50] but the joshan are great difficulty to
[2:00:53] thumb Jesus in a great difficulty to
[2:01:00] find Jesus sometimes we have to go
[2:01:02] through some desperate things and
[2:01:07] sometimes we lose our strength and even
[2:01:10] lose our way I don't know how to eat
[2:01:24] this this this pit is will be but
[2:01:34] brother Nathanael we will all agree that
[2:01:37] Jesus is on his way
[2:01:49] and he's all he's waiting more than just
[2:01:53] my house and I wrote this note down this
[2:02:00] week early in the morning and I want to
[2:02:04] share it with you if I get to a spot to
[2:02:09] wear that I can't remember my name
[2:02:12] somebody take a hold of my hand and get
[2:02:16] me to Jesus will you make me that
[2:02:24] promise
[2:02:40] I must get to Jesus amen Andrew could
[2:02:51] you sing that song again he's in the
[2:02:56] house now I want to just close if I
[2:03:04] could with this and thank you for being
[2:03:06] such a wonderful audience
[2:03:14] unconscious that you are thinking about
[2:03:17] my need and even yours
[2:03:21] but really what about your need why
[2:03:28] don't you just call your name now your
[2:03:32] situation why don't you just lay
[2:03:35] everything on the line no matter where
[2:03:39] you're out if it's in the Philippines
[2:03:41] it's in Europe sister Pascal sister
[2:03:47] Christine sister Johnson with cancer the
[2:04:01] needs that are coming in all over the
[2:04:03] world it seems like such a simple thing
[2:04:15] but what about about your relationships
[2:04:21] don't you put God first and everything
[2:04:24] in your life young man young lady
[2:04:28] there's nothing worth putting in front
[2:04:30] of Jesus let me just say there's the
[2:04:33] world is falling apart it's like falling
[2:04:36] off of a cliff and many people are
[2:04:39] reaching and grabbing whatever rock that
[2:04:41] they can get or but let me just say
[2:04:43] there's no answer in the earth but Jesus
[2:04:46] and there's a lot of people think I'm
[2:04:50] preaching a simple sermon when it's way
[2:04:52] beyond anything that they can get
[2:04:57] because a lot of people saw we and
[2:05:00] Brenham and they didn't see Jesus and
[2:05:06] there's a lot of people see our favorite
[2:05:08] preachers and how well they preach but
[2:05:11] they don't see Jesus and Andrew I want
[2:05:15] them to not just hear your fiery sermon
[2:05:18] but I want them to see Jesus and at the
[2:05:22] end of the day all the sermons that are
[2:05:24] preached in my life
[2:05:25] they don't mean nothing unless they've
[2:05:31] seen Jesus life means nothing unless you
[2:05:42] met him
[2:05:44] I love you with all my heart with all my
[2:05:55] heart
