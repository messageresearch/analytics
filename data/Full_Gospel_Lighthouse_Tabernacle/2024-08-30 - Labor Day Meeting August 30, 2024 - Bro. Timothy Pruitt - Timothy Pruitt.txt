Sons and Daughters of God can worship they can worship in a school auditorium they can worship in their car they can worship in a chur Church they can worship in their bedroom because Sons and Daughters of God were built for worship hallelujah hallelujah God richly bless you tonight we we welcome you here to Full Gospel Lighthouse our our annual Labor Day meetings and we are absolutely Beyond honored that you would come and spend your time and your vacations and to be a part of these meetings and we just want to say God richly bless you and we are under great anticipation for these meetings that God will do specific and great things here this weekend and I I just like to read you a few things brother brandham brother brandham prayed this prayer in hear ye himym and I pray that this is the same effect that the same effect transpires here this weekend he says shall we bow our heads our blessed Heavenly Father we thank thee tonight for the privilege that we have of assembling here in this great Arena to worship thee we ask that you will sanctify our efforts and may it be to the glory of God and may many be saved and healed in this place and may it be such a memorial to many as they pass by here in the days to come if Jesus terries here may they be able to say in that place God forgave my sins or in that place God healed me may it be a time of History Lord might be Lord might be be made for the Church of the Living God he said forgive us of our sins as we forgive those who sin against us and we pray that you will all together gather us tonight under the wings of his abiding presence as a hen gathers her chicks may we be gathered this night and may the Holy Spirit visit us with great power for we ask it in Christ's name amen I pray that in these meetings this weekend that your expectations whatever they may be I pray that they get met in every single possible way no matter what it is I want to ask you question how big would you ask if you knew you couldn't fail how big of a healing how big of a miracle how big of a change in your life how big would you ask if you knew you couldn't fail I happen to believe that you're the Church of the Living God you're the most powerful people on the face of the Earth and God ordained you for this time I don't believe there's anything too hard for the children of God again our Prophet would say now we we got two more he said we got two more great nights Friday and Saturday night and we're expecting our Lord to do great things in these nights and we just don't know what lays ahead yet tonight I like that because you can be expecting just anything to happen we don't know just what time that God might just come into here and give us another Pentecost we don't know we don't know just what time that God might just come into here and give us another Pentecost that's what we need and I would be so happy to be right in here with you to enjoy the fellowship and the freshness of the Holy Spirit and I tell you our land really needs that and I say if a prophet was saying that in 1959 I'd say it's the same thing today that's what our land needs is another Pentecost I say in this meetings we want you to have your Liberty and accept the word of God in all of its fullness and its truth we want you to experience the Holy Ghost we want you to get so filled on the Holy Spirit if you want to clap your hands with give you Liberty to clap your hands if you want to stand up and amen the word of God you just go ahead and stand up and amen the word of God if you want to shout then you just go ahead and shout if you want to dance just go ahead and dance we say brother Andrew we don't do that in our church just look around you're not in your church but what I want you to do most in this weekend this meeting I want you to amen the word of God because when you begin to amen the word of God it releases a supernatural it doesn't matter how emotional you get but when you be get get behind the word of God and amen the word of God what the preacher's putting out there the supernatural begins to get released I is something powerful that transpires when a man of God gets anointed and begins to preach the anointed word of the hour and Believers begin to pull on it and say Amen to it that it recognizes all of Heaven recognizes that there's a pull in this hour I say this unto you tonight don't waste your time this weekend move right on into the Supernatural hallelujah we're so honored to have our brother Timothy puit here to speak for us tonight have our brother Tim puit to speak for us tomorrow evening and our brother Donnie Reagan to speak these men of God have been used all around the world but they have been a very special spot a very special place here in Elton Virginia for Full Gospel Lighthouse and we've seen the supernatural in their lives and I I want you to know that no matter what case that you're setting in that our Lord Jesus Christ that these men of God represent he has come here it doesn't matter it doesn't I know that sometimes in an auditorium it's not the setting that you're typically used to but just just to remind yourself that the prophet would stand in Auditorium and in coliseums and the pillar of fire would show up in a Coliseum we don't have to wait on him here tonight he's already here so I want you to lift your faith I want you to lift your amens I want you to anticipate the Almighty God to come by your way tonight maybe we'll just sing that song I Believe for it key of A is brother Timothy makes makes his way here amen if you wouldn't

opportunity to shake your hand to greet you but if we don't have the opportunity we love you with all of our hearts thankful for each one that's here tonight amen I'm thankful to minister along alongside two of my heroes amen that's had such an impact on my life and amen through uh through the moments that God would call me into the ministry and actually was uh right there at the very moments that brother Donnie was ministering at our church and he's speaking on The Potter's will and he come down to the end of it he says you know if God calls you to preach he doesn't give you a check box it says Check Yes or No just goes down along the lines and I knew the Lord been dealing with my heart and went down and ask him to pray for me so you know those those are some special moments that you never forget and U we're thankful for each man of God that God has called in this hour Amen to Herald the message of his coming amen I believe that's what we have as a message of his coming amen that he's going to come back and he's going to take his home to be with him what a wonderful consolation that is especially in the day that we're living in amen amen let's turn to First Kings 17 and verse 1 it said and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before before whom I stand there shall not be do nor rain these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came un him saying get thee hence and turn thee Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and I've commanded the Ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the book Brook cherith that was before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he rose and went to zerath and there he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called her and said bring me I pray thee a morel of bread in thine hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil and a cruise behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me their of a little cake first bring it unto me and after make of thee for thy son for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the crws of oil fail unto the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the Cru of oil fail according to the word word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah amen we let you be seated like to speak to you tonight on certain in uncertain times excuse me certain in in uncertain times certain as we know the word is known is it means known for sure or established Beyond doubt and the opposite is uncertain which not is not able to be relied on or not known or definite you know we're living in an uncertain time it's an uncertain time for the world but we're living in a certain time for a certain people of God and why we can be certain is because we've heard a certain sound amen it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ the word of God for this day amen I believe I believe we're living in the fulfillment of Prophecy thank you I believe we're living in a time that what can be shaken will be shaken Amen brother Bram would say it like this he said don't be discouraged he said we're living in a terrible time but it's a terrible time for the unbeliever but a wonderful hour for the believer amen for we're nearing the end time to which we're looking for the coming of our blessed Lord that's why we're here but we're living in time in a time of shaking he says things in in the in the trumpet gives an uncertain sound he says things of the earth is shaken you can't put confidence in anything everything's uncertain and anything that's uncertain I would just rather stay away from it or leave away from it he said home life has become uncertain National Life is uncertain and the world is uncertain now this is 63 what are we in today amen we're just living in a place to where the whole world is having a nervous prostration looks like shaking all over every nation everybody one afraid of the other one they talk of Peace he said one time oh we fight the first world war and all our boys go over there that'll settle all wars he said it wasn't too long and then it fell apart and here we were in another world war he said everything is shaking political life is shaking National Life is shaking everything is shook up he said even Church life has shook up and uncertain amen the people don't even know hardly what to do you know I was actually looking at this and just this week an article come out uh was said many many parents would probably say raising CH children isn't easy he said now the US Surgeon General is agreeing with them the Surgeon General this week released an ad advisory to parents regarding the effect of raising children that might be having on their mental health he said aside from the act of raising and caring for children many parents are even more succeptible to the stressors of concerns that are economic and societal than those without kids so even the Eternal attorney general is putting out warnings you know because people are becoming so stressed out they're becoming so worried and they they ought to be worried because we're living in a world that's headed toward destruction amen the world that we live in is uncertain the government's uncertain listen it doesn't matter who they put in the uh in the white house it's still going to be uncertain amen life is uncertain people are grasping at ideas or whatever to prop themselves up why because of uncertainties no one knows what next no one knows what the next day hold even the best of times of Life are uncertain amen we don't know when our last times together are here upon this Earth amen even these meetings are uncertain we don't know if we'll have another one amen just go back to co you know how quick that shut down amen we don't know if we would what we hold dear today will be gone tomorrow things are uncertain and brother R would say it like this he said each age has his pressures for example he said a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches of soft living of nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfit to live in he said I preach to more tired people another place I preach to more tired people than anybody in the world people are so tired they're so mentally strained until they fill in the insane institutions in the hospitals they went in such nervous condition that they don't know what they believe and they don't know what what they want anymore they're just laying there they don't know what to do it's such a sad spot amen he says you but listen brother you can't drink it off you can't shout it off you can't play Cloud cards you can't take a thousand csas and try to sleep it off amen you you can't do it all of our little remedies only thing it does is help symptoms we got to have a cure for the disease amen all the all the symptoms is there he says the Cure is the blood of Jesus Christ amen not take a rest at the seashore not get an Anthem of choir to sing songs it's what we're trying to do today sing it off oh we got to make ourselves like this one or do that we're trying to do something different trying to educate it out there's only one way to do it face the facts if you're upset and you're frustrated come to Jesus Christ amen come to him he is the only thing that is [Applause] certain he was saying the trumpet gives an uncertain sound he said you're painting an awful picture there dark picture he said I intend to do that he said I did it for a purpose that I might say this is there anything certain yes there's one thing that is certain I'm so glad of that there's one one thing we can put our confidence and be sure that it's right when everything is gone and everything is shaking there will be something still standing heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail certain and uncertain times there's only one thing we can do is place our confidence in the word of God what he said will come to pass amen our money is not certain our homes and lands are not certain nothing Earthly or temporary is certain he'd continue on he said we need today is not a lot of material things we have that we don't need maybe greater churches or greater congregations we don't need more on the radio or television we don't need so many more of these things but what we need today is to be spiritual Amen to be spiritual is a person that is with willing to Humble themselves before God if they ain't got a penny they'll pray till that Spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and Revival that take place inside their heart that'll change their attitude it'll change their attitude and the atmosphere that they're living in you know your attitude affects your altitude amen that's what they talk about I'm not a pilot but I I've read about it was I studying some things amen the pilots talk about they adjust the flaps and they adjust this and that and the other and they're they're actually call it adjusting the plane's attitude and as they adjust the attitude it affects the altitude amen so if we can get our attitudes adjusted and we can get our hearts in the right place amen this weekend let's get it off for next week and what happened today what happened yesterday the fuss you had on the way to church get it off your mind get your attitude right and it'll change your atmosphere and pretty soon the clouds you've been looking at you'll be flying over the top of them why because your attitude has been [Applause] changed hallelujah amen thank you so if we can get our attitudes adjusted to the right place it'll change our atmosphere we're living in that's right say how can I do that he said he said you're if you're Abraham's seed how many is Abraham's seed then you're then you're when you're dead in Christ all frictions static is tuned out your motive is one your heart's one you're one with [Applause] Christ come on now some of us got a lot of static in our lives some of you may not be old enough but I'm old enough to remember those dials on the radio you know you now just push a button put put a number in you get whatever but they used to have those dials how many remembers that there a lot of old people in here they had those dials and you you turn it one way and you get the news and just turn it too far and you get something else or you get something you know and many and that's that's the way our lives are amen too many times we're tuned into too much stuff we're tuned into news we're tuned into this we're tuned into that amen man I trust God can take his tender hand and reach down into our hearts this weekend and tune Us in to what happening on the other side amen if he can just tune Us in tonight to realize there's angels of God in this place and they've been here before you even got here preparing the way preparing you for your healing preparing for you to your for deliverance there's angels of God are here that say God I need all the static tuned out of my life I need you to come down and tune me in when you get tuned in then what he said is first and the rest is nonsense that's a direct quote what he said is first and the rest is nonsense listen this world is nonsense what this world is saying is [Applause] nonsense well who you think's going to be the next president I don't know I'm not even worried about it we're living in the Fulfillment of Prophecy so if it w woman's there is because there's a prophecy it's fulfilling the scripture if there's a man there it's because there some prophecy amen it's fulfilling scripture amen we're here to take God's word Amen brother brandom you know was in Canada one time and he was having a meeting he was walking down the street and there was a man selling televisions he said I'd like to sell you a set fell brother said I'm just a tourist he said I see you just passing through he said well actually here to have a service couple of Serv Services he said well you wouldn't happen to be around this

anything that cannot be scientifically proven when I think there's nothing to it I said well I don't be like to be different but I have to be now he said that the things that can be scientifically proven is not real it's only the things that's not scientifically proven that's real he said that's ridiculous I said all right I want you to ask you something could you tell me what love is could you go down to the drugstore and buy me a quarter's worth of love you can't see it it's unseen show me what life is I I I need a little more life could you buy me a quarter's worth of more life he said what was it he said these things are temporal and perishable but if we can we put so much emphasis on that he said so much concerned about the natural things and so little about the spiritual things he said for I said for instance coming through this room right now is a television picture you have to show me the picture or I won't believe it's what he's telling this guy he said of course it hits the crystal goes on down the tubes it shows a picture here and I said well that man's in the United States you're picking him up way down there it's coming through the air he said but we can prove it because he's a picture showing that it's here I said yes and we can prove ours too for in glory we got a Risen Savior and he's sending forth the holy spirit is here to reveal it and make it positive therefore we got a sending station and a receiving station that's correct God in heaven who knows all things can so put a gift in his church and he can magnify it and reflect himself through it and say things which is absolutely impossible to be proved by science but we don't walk by what we see we walk by things we don't do not see like Noah before there was one drop of rain ever fell from the heavens he started building an ark why did he do that cuz God told him to amen and they found out real quick that what they thought was certain what they thought they their instruments that they could they could go up into the heavens and prove there wasn't no rain they thought that was certain but what was certain God said build an ark and so here he is hammering on this raw Ark and people were coming and laughing and making fun of him and why you doing this and why you doing that are you crazy you're you're you're you're just that's just nothing but a bunch of emotion oh but of critics they ain't died that Spirit hasn't died he wants to look right in on us and criticize this and criticize that and criticize it but you just keep building on the ark amen you just keep doing what God's ordained you to do you just keep preaching you keep living you keep singing you keep [Applause] shouting Noah what what what are you doing I'm just building on the ark he said what was it he had heard the word there was something beating in his bosom like a pulsation it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain hello we may not have that same pulsation of it's going to rain but it there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a body change there's going to be a body change there's going to be a body change Fox news is saying this CNN saying this this one's saying that that there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a body Chas it's a pulsation down on the inside of it everybody else may not believe it but God's got a people on this Earth that believe what he said he said it I believe it he said it it is done he said of that same pulsation he said if these people here in these wheelchairs or on CS or you that's sick to die you can hear the word of God tonight don't try to figure it out don't think how long you've been sitting in that [Applause] condition it's time you forget about the condition and think about your God amen amen see he said don't figure don't try to figure it out don't think how long you've been sitting there how long you've been sick think what God Said and there come a pulsation of the Holy Spirit In Your Heart say it's the truth it's nothing but the truth how do you know it's the truth cuz God's word says it's the truth how do you know you're going to be healed cuz God's word said I'm going to be healed Hallelujah I know it's the truth he say something begins to pulsate in your bosom it's the truth then make ready then make ready how many is making ready tonight you're com coming out of there you're coming out of there make ready you're coming out of there just as certain as I'm standing in the pull pit tonight don't look at what you see how bad you're crippled how sick you are what the doctor said don't look at that look at the [Applause] unsa he said I think that Holy Spirit can lead a man and tell him things and make him act different make him believe things and receive things the world can never believe I'm a witness he said I once was a blind man once myself practically had to be led so I know what I'm talking about that is the holy spirit he said oh can't you feel the pulsation of the spirit begin to rise in your heart saying Jesus Christ is our midst amen this might not be in your normal setting it might not be in your church but he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be so a pulsation begins to rise up Jesus is Among Us Jesus is Among Us amen there was a woman the scripture calls her a certain woman she heard that Jesus was coming by and she said hey this is my time this is my opportunity this is my moment if I can just Reach Out And Touch the Hem of His Garment pulsations something moving like a heartbeat is pumping energy to your spirit thank you Lord you feel the atmosphere start changing it becomes more than just a school room becomes a throne room it becomes a place and has maybe inhabited all kinds of things but all of a sudden a few Believers get together they start singing the songs of Zion and they start singing about the things of God and the atmosphere start changing Hallelujah it starts pumping energy into your spirit it starts pumping energy into your mind then last the things that your eyes see black out amen I pray that we can get so lifted up in the presence of God we don't see cancer no more we don't see sickness no more we don't see problems we don't see depression we don't see anxiety we don't see fear we see Jesus Christ we see Jesus Christ risen from the dead Noah didn't wait till he saw a cloud hello Noah he didn't wait till he saw a cloud that's right well I just wait till the atmosphere gets right why don't you start doing something about your atmosphere Amen Let God start moving in your heart and all of a sudden the pulsation of fear will turn from that to a ation of Faith amen and Faith begin to rise in your heart he's the same yesterday today and forever it doesn't matter where I am I can be in my car I can be in my home I can be wherever God will meet [Applause] me oh if we could tune our hearts he said let the C let the reasonings go but with our hearts could tune it to the word of God we'd see a Revival break out hallelujah amen hallelujah anyways see a Revival break out a pulsation something's going to take place he said when that happens nothing's going to stop it that's right I'm here to tell the devil you ain't got enough to stop it hey devil if you could have put this fire out you'd have put it out thousands of years ago but you couldn't put it out then you're not going to put it out now amen because it's a pulsation on the inside I have the same gospel that Paul preach that Peter preach I have the same Holy Ghost the same power that's on the inside of me is on the inside of Believers there's something certain about that amen it said it's like building a fire on a windy day amen it just keeps blowing as the Holy Spirit fans the fire it'll keep burning till it becomes a reality to you let me just deal with that for a moment amen another place there he said there's something within us it's a fire that's burning it's a light that's been lit by [Applause] God Lord amen it's a light that's been lit by God no Breeze can blow it out there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference among the people there's no persecution of the world that can blow out a flame that God has lit for it's God's purpose that is torch light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no power can blow it out they will only make it get brighter you hear that devil go ahead and blow go ahead and how go ahead and make your threats all your hot air ain't doing nothing but causing the flame that's been lit by God to grow lie Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher listen I'm here to tell you if the devil could have put you out he'd have put you out a long time ago if he could have stomped that fire out he'd have stomped it out a long time ago but he knows he can't do it cuz this is not a fire that's been lit by seventh grade Kentucky this is a fire that come from the Throne of [Applause] God hallelujah he said what'll happen he said that pulsation will just keep going it'll keep moving and you'll begin to have these thoughts in your mind God is God Amen three words God is God well if he's God today he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer he's still a savior he's still all that we have need of come on now if he ain't he ain't God right but if he ever was he ever will be right so if he proved himself one time to be a Healer and he's still God he's still a Healer if he proved himself one time to be a Savior and he's still God he's still a savior amen so if we can tune our thoughts not the Fox News CNN and Google or whatever amen but we can tune it to God is God woo Hallelujah they can't you feel the atmosphere is changing God is God some of you need to look at that devil in the eye and say my God is still God he's still the same yesterday today he's still the same one that defeated you 2,000 years ago he's still God I'm here to tell you once again he's still God over cancer we said this one that I don't have nothing to do with he's still God over cancer he's still God over brain bleeds he's still God over every situation God is God Hallelujah Hall the Bible says in Psalm 46:1 it says God is our refuge and strength he's a very present help in time of trouble Hallelujah therefore we will not fear hello though the Earth should change though the mountains be shaken into the midst of the sea though the waters Roar and foam though the mountains tremble at it swelling in turmoil saah I got to looking at that you know what Salah means it means to pause and calmly think about it wait a minute we will not fear the Earth's going to change the mountains going to be shaken in there into the Seas the water's going to Roar and form the mountains are going to tremble SA why can we have Salah in the middle of all this chaos because he is the god of Refuge he's the present help in the time of [Applause] trouble God is in the midst of her thank Lord amen she shall not be moved God will help her right early at the dawn of the morning the nation rage and the kingdoms have tied and were moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted and the Lord of host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge say come Behold The Works of the Lord who has wrought desolation and wonders in the earth he maketh Wars to cease to the end of the Earth he breakthe bow into pieces and snaps the spear in two he burns the Chariots with fire but be still and know that I am God all this other may cause a lot of uncertainty but if you go back to this be still and know I'm God he hasn't lost control of this this Earth is not out of control this nation is not out of control as far as God's concerned amen he's got it right where he wants it to be it's been prophesied to be destroyed that's right come on I kind of get tickled at everybody around the earth and want to send me text about you know about what the prophet said about the United States I said but have you forgot what the Bible said about the whole world that's right don't sit there in your Pious feelings and think we're such a bunch of low down skunks and you're just as bad as we are come on Amen every one of us going to get burned with fire every country this whole earth is going to melt as an oven it's going to burn with an intense heat amen so it's people are getting in the atmosphere for Destruction their minds are being tuned towards it their thoughts are going towards it amen they're going towards destruction but there's another group of people their mind is not upon destruction their mind is upon a Rapture their mind is upon a leing here so be still and know recognize and understand I will be exalted among the Nations I will exalt the Earth and the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge our high tower and stronghold saor pause and cly think about that there's another I'm borring this from a buddy of mine but there was another certain woman in the Bible right after Gideon had fought his race and he had died one of his sons by a concubine had taken over and he was R ruthless and he was killing all the other sons and he had chased them up and brought come to this city and but they said there was something about this city and this city was a strong tower that's right and so they went up into that strong tower oh my and they went up in there and here ailec comes against the tower and he's walking there making his threats and he's making his threats and he's saying I'm going to burn you down I'm going to kill you just like I did everybody else but there was a millstone up in that Tower and the Bible said a certain woman she grabbed a hold of a millstone and she just went over the top and looked down dropped it on him she dropped it on him and his head was caved in and he looked at his sword bear and he said please thrust me through so it won't be said of me I was killed by a woman but she wasn't just any woman she was a certain woman she was standing upon her promises and she got backed up into a strong tower I tell you the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous can run into it don't run into your frustration don't run into your depression don't run into your fear run to the Lord run to the Tower and in there you will find the promise and when the comes against your [Applause] door I'm looking at a certain woman I'm looking at a devil defeater I'm looking at a serpent stomper I'm looking at somebody that knows who they are cuz they knows who they [Applause] are they knows who's they know who who they are we're not just anybody we've been placed here for a purpose back to our scripture how this he said how this little woman must have been the caliber of Elijah that's amazing huh the caliber of Elijah because usually your action shows what you are if you going to just cower down to the devil shows who you are but if you grabb that Millstone throw it on his rotten head yeah huah amen he said for we see that God would not have called her if she hadn't been worthy to entertain God's Prophet let me say this tonight he would not have called you if you wasn't worthy of the call so you must be of the same caliber of [Applause] Elijah amen for he would have never sent his Prophet to that house who was unworthy see it was not his choosing the prophets it was God's choosing hello somebody and it wasn't her bidding it was God's bidding he had been placed by the Brook and the stream had run out and God commanded him for something for a time to be there but it came a time he said see God surely went to a believer of the same nature of Elijah that she could believe just as he believed come on somebody that could she could have the same faith that he [Applause] had this message is not resting just Upon A a seventh angel but God has called a people of the same caliber of the same faith of the same anointing of the same power the Holy Ghost is the same in that life as it was in his [Applause] life she was a widow woman in other words her husband was dead you know and she wasn't even a Jew she was a gentile this ain't our type I don't know what it is and here here she he came death was coming right to the gate at her door death was about to get to her but before before death got there before all hope was was lost before it was going to be impossible for her to ever return before she was going to cross the line she heard a voice and the voice be to speak to her and there was something on the inside of her says that's nothing but the [Applause] truth hallelujah come on death was trying to take some of you drugs and alcohol and every kind of thing it was trying to take you to a point of no return before it could get you there God stepped to your gate God stepped in and his voice screamed out and it called you by name said you never was a chicken you was always an eagle you don't belong there that's not who you are you never belong to the devil death has no hold on [Applause] you death was coming but the voice got there first yes amen oh she must have got real sincere about her prayers you let stri you let that strike your home or you'll get sincere I've seen people as Church of Christ don't believe in miracles don't believe in healing but you let them get sick I knew of a man that was overseas preaching you know you don't go to doctors don't go to doctors you denying your faith first thing you know he got sick first thing he did is went to a doctor but you know people got all kind of ideas till it comes to their house that's right amen so she could look at the pale lips of her little boy about three or four years old she could see her own bones dwelling away the flesh was leaving must have been a terrible thing as a mother seeing those things going on yet with her hands before God praying day and night now we got one we're down lord we're down to one hand fi we got one left we got one spoonful one we got one last chance you know God allow you to get to that place he say it's a strange thing God he said may God let this soak into every one of you if you never hear me preach again let this be a message it's the most strange sometimes that God does things that way he said no you know when you confessed your sins and you met every requirement that God requires and we believe on God there's a circumstances the circumstances have been met and it's according to his will we've confessed our sins we made all our wrongs right we've done everything we know how to do every requirement God has made or ask yet he lays silent he just won't answer us I'm sure I'm speaking to people this morning who's come to that place he said I've been there many times myself when I went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and I find that I did something wrong then I'd go confess and say Lord I may want to make this right then come back again say no Lord Thou Art God you will answer me surely I've met every request you required me every requirement I've met and he still won't move amen seems to set silent that's when you got to be certain he is [Applause] God Amen don't be discouraged in those moment the only thing is that is your heart it has to be in your heart I am certain he's God yes I am certain he has heard my prayer I am certain he sees my knee I am certain he's going to [Applause] moveen be certain first before you do anything be certain in your heart that it's God and when you met everything he said then you're sure he's God that's when Faith goes to work right there Faith stands steady for it knows that he is and you met every requirement you believe that he is is Faith holds steady he said oh blessed be his name Faith won't move for it's sure that God is and he's the rewarder of those that diligently seek Him He said may this go down deep and never move you brandom Tabernacle if you ever met God's requirement and in your heart you believe that he is God's only testing your faith for he loves to do that Hallelujah we don't love that he does it amen but he loves to do that said you've confessed your sin you made a requirement to God and still he lays silent remember faith says he is then Faith holds on to it not knowing what's it's all about but it knows that he is it's certain that he is it knows his word is true you know he loves to test us yeah he loves to see the reaction of your faith right so it's an action that cause a reaction God allows something to come to see how you're going to react to it yeah yeah will you react in faith or will you react in fear will you re react in speaking the word of God or will you Rea and speaking your your your reasonings and your doubts and your misunderstanding and all how how are you going to react come on now I knew it get a little quiet right there God likes to see how you will react you know I just like to speak my mind well won't you to speak his [Music] word amen speak his word what he said not what you think right not what you believe it ought to be not the way you think it ought to happen speak his word I don't know how he's going to do it I just know his word said he will do it so we're not here speaking our thoughts and speaking what we think and speaking speaking and speaking so we ain't got no words left no we're speaking what he [Applause] said than you Lord when you say oh Lord I believe you Thou Art My Savior I Believe You're My Healer I believe you're the one who gives the Holy Spirit the things that I'm required you're the God who gives that and then you confess all your sins and promise God that you'll do if you he'll let you get well and then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere God can't use that there's no way for him to use that there's no way for him to answer you because he only Answers by faith that's right then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer we we got the scripture you know when he when I come when I return will I find faith we put that at the coming of the Lord and I believe believe that yeah but it also means when he comes in this service will he find faith when he comes to your Pew will he find faith when he comes to your heart will he find Faith amen when I return will I find Faith you know he does that he's only wanting or waiting to test you that's right he did it many times the Hebrew children they wouldn't bow to an idol he let them get right down to their last step their last place hope I can get through this cuz it's is very special for me but he lets them get right down to their last place and brother B said let's look at a different picture now and he tells us to look up and he says the angels are gathered around he says Lord God don't you see what's going on down there he said yes I've been seeing I've been watching he sees you he's heard you cry he's heard you stand against that enemy but he's letting you walk down to the last step it seemed like it's about to be over wormwood said let me go Gabriel said let me go Michael said no no this is a job for me brother R said he caught a light and a zigzag of lightning and a roll of thunder down through there he went and as they stepped into the fire there was a fourth man it takes the fire to bring the Fourth Man it takes trials it takes tribulation it takes these things that we go through sicknesses sicknesses is only a path for God to come to [Applause] you they were going to the fiery furnace knowing they were certain that if God let them burn he was going to raise them up that's they were certain of God because they knew that God would work everything for their good that's right that's a good scripture to be certain about all things work together for the good to them that are the called according to his purpose amen they made one statement they were certain and they're walking down will you bow no we ain't bowing we know this is your decree with the decrees you be throw in the fire well whatever King live forever we're not going to bow to your image bind their hands bind their feet and start them to the furnace and they walk with their face to the fire amen God still standing looking at that and they were certain he was still God and they walk right up to the fiery furnace right up to the last moment and there he came riding out of Heavens on The Chariot of wind fan the breezes off them while he talked to him and consol them see God let your faith come to a spot to where it can react that's another place he said we find in those hours of real stress that's usually when the spirit of God moves in he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved a muscle never moved a hand but when he moved he moves hallelujah amen you might feel like you're getting to your last moment but when God moves he moves Hallelujah you might look like you're getting your last threat of Hope but when God moves he moves there's some of you that was dangling over hell and fire was trying to burn the last thread but God rich in Mercy moved on your behalf and snatched you [Applause] out job got in one of those spots you got one of those spots of course you go through those things you know people want to accuse you of being a secret sinner well he must have you know his comforters came and and my wife listened through all that I didn't find hardly I didn't find a word of comfort amen job kept having said no wait a minute I offered a sacrifice that's right well surely you'd have done you know surely no I I got a sacrifice amen I don't like those kind of comforters I like real friends that'll come and lift you up want to accuse you of something when you're going through a hard time well surely you know you you're talking the devil's language right how do you know because I know when my son got got his first breath of air and the devil tried to collapse his lungs and they stuck together and they were running him down the hall first thing that came on my shoulder was what did you do that's right what did you do to deserve this surely you must sin surely you've done something wrong surely God wouldn't do this to you if you was righteous surely you wouldn't go through a hard time and lose your mother if he was a righteous man surely you wouldn't go through a hard time and lose loved ones if he was doing that's the devil's [Applause] language amen he wants to come and bring false accusations against the people of God Amen but I realized real quick I was going through this trial so God could show me who he is so God would give me my own [Applause] testimony when God so when when a man keeps what God said he would do he's certain he's God God has to answer may not be the answer we want but God has to answer Faith calls him on the scene every time when you've done what you know is right when you met his requirements when you've confessed and made things right done restitution laid it before God I don't care how silent he is he's still God he's waiting to put that Faith there youve done your works now he wants to see your faith by your Works he wants to see what you will do if you've been anointed and prayed for and God's waiting to see what you'll believe about it I run up the next Sunday or the next day where the next healer comes to the city we're waiting he's waiting to see your reaction on your faith not walk back the next day and say I feel so bad I don't guess I got healed you're not fit for the prayer line in the first place smoke we got them everybody's got them people come up for prayer and they talk to they talk them El out out of their healing before you can ever say a word start speaking all the doubts and all the frustrations and all the problems and all fin look say hey is God God or what amen we're not here Amen to go back on what God's done for us we're not here to deny our faith or push it back amen we're here to stand on our faith amen when it doesn't like I don't feel like it doesn't got nothing to do with our feelings a got nothing to do what I think or how I feel it all has to do with what he [Applause] said he said well brother brandom I disagree with you said well your own actions Pro what you are by your fruits he shall know them if a man says he's a Christian he still drinks smokes gamble tell dirty jokes say he's part of the Bible writing part's not he'll might preach the gospel and not part of it he's still a sinner all right he's not right yet but when you openly confess that God is the same God and your life applied into his hands to be go Lord I Am The Clay Thou Art the Potter then ask what you will Faith Will Never Move it'll stand right there that's right job made his offerings he done everything he knew that he was right and here com his church members job he might as well confess that you're a sinner for God wouldn't punish you like this unless you sin job said well I made my confession I burnt the offering before God I'm not a sinner he knew where he was standing then everything went on and just on and on just as hard getting worse getting worse D job down getting places of bulls but he would not D deny God and he would not deny his offering and the very minute you take action upon anything that you confess it shows your weakness your doubt of God you ask God for anything and you walk around doubting it you're a doubter not a Believer that's right job you're so miserable his wife said why don't you just Curse God die he said y speak us like a foolish woman amen he said he was certain there yeah you going to say that to your wife you better be certain amen he was certain there he was God he had met the requirement he said I he knew that he had met God's requirement he said and he said when we've met his requirement repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the of your sin ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's his promise any among you sick call the Elders of the church let them annoy with oil in prayer the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise them up that settles it that's right you met God's requirements and signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and drink deadly things and are not har them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it is settled his wife said why why don't you curse him and die you're getting worse all the time he said how Satan loves to throw that at you that's right that's right why you're no better than when you got anointed you no better than when them preachers prayed for you them preachers ain't right in the first place direct quotes I don't matter it doesn't matter about that preacher it's your faith in the Living God what counts it's not what the preacher is it's what God is come on somebody amen too many people are like that man that laid by the well what 38 years Jesus comes ask him a question you want to get well yeah what a question that was 38 years he laid there and he asked him if he want to get well but Jesus saw something else is going on he said well I ain't got nobody to take me to the water you going to take me the way I got he started throwing up all of excuses for the one he wouldn't need any excuses he would needed to know do you want to get well do you want to be healed do you want to be delivered well I ain't got certain so and so to pray for me I ain't got certain certain do this I ain't got it doesn't matter do you want to be well cuz it ain't about a preacher or it ain't about a certain person it's about as Jesus Christ in the building and if he's in the building and I know he is I'm certain he is you say why have you felt him have you seen him no not all of that maybe not but his word said he is amen amen I read a quote one day brother Brandon said the pillar of fire is here you said do you say you say brother Brown do you see it he said no he said but it's here he said because his word said it would be that's right come on people people get all about preachers and all about this and all about that certain places certain atmosphere certain that it ain't all about that I've seen people get healed when there wasn't nobody else around I've seen people delivered when they wasn't a preacher to pray for them physically sure he's praying for him in other rounds but they would he wasn't there but this young man was so far away from God over there he walked into his room and when he did the presence of God fell down rank Center been in all kinds of things but he knew God was there he fell on his knees and gave his heart to the Lord still serving God today be certain he puts our faith to test to see if we really believe he is God do we really believe what he said amen and he put This Woman's Faith to the test it wasn't like she could go back and get more this was her last meal this was everything she had this was her last moment on Earth she felt like and she hears a voice say go make me a cake see God is calling you today he wants you to give us your all cuz if you're willing to give your all then he's willing to give his all and his all is greater than your all she couldn't produce more meal she couldn't produce more all but he could and all he needed was a willing heart that'll dig down in that barrel and get the last me brother BR said you know what that represented he said that represented Jesus Christ and he said those sticks he said it said two sticks that was a cross of self sa sacrifice he said when you're willing to lay yourself upon that cross God will come down and minister to your [Applause] need we make church about all about us well I don't like this and I don't like
