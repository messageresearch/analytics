[0:30] god bless you all
[0:31] such a wonderful honor to be able to
[0:33] greet you in the name of the lord jesus
[0:35] christ
[0:36] i certainly hate that we have to greet
[0:38] you in this manner
[0:39] knowing that our all of our hearts
[0:41] desires to be in the house of god
[0:44] as we know that the bible tells us to
[0:47] forsake not the assembling of ourselves
[0:49] as we see the day approaching knowing
[0:52] that we can't assemble ourselves in that
[0:54] manner
[0:56] it certainly breaks our heart but
[0:58] knowing that we're facing
[0:59] unprecedented times like never before
[1:02] facing a sickness called covet that we
[1:05] know that is just a fancy name for a
[1:07] demon
[1:08] and many have been affected and been
[1:11] sick by this
[1:12] by this sickness and
[1:16] many have been in the hospital many have
[1:18] tested positive and
[1:20] different things felt different effects
[1:22] because of this sickness been in
[1:23] quarantine
[1:25] and we have certainly been praying for
[1:26] every one of you
[1:29] and whether you you're sick whether
[1:31] you've been in quarantine or not we've
[1:32] been praying for you
[1:34] that it would not come nigh thou
[1:35] dwelling even our pastor brother ron has
[1:38] tested positive this past week for
[1:40] covet the doctors determined that
[1:42] brother ron had coveted pneumonia
[1:44] and so we want to be in much prayer for
[1:46] brother ron sister connie as well
[1:48] by the time you're hearing this it's
[1:49] been about 12 days that she's been sick
[1:52] been a been affected by it and very worn
[1:54] out and weak as many others that i've
[1:57] prayed with over the phone and spoke
[1:58] with that have been sick and
[2:01] we're certainly praying for every
[2:02] individual every home
[2:04] that god would come and minister to your
[2:07] lives like never before
[2:09] just because you tested positive because
[2:11] of covet
[2:13] does not mean that you lost the faith
[2:15] does not mean that
[2:17] that you don't have the token or the
[2:18] holy ghost it just proves that you're
[2:20] human
[2:21] and because of adam's fall in the garden
[2:23] this is why you
[2:25] get sick now time may terry and we may
[2:28] be here another 10 years
[2:29] you'll overcome this and you may get
[2:32] sick again i'm sure of it
[2:34] but we're going to a land that will
[2:35] never get sick and we'll never have
[2:37] sorrow
[2:37] never cry never be in pain that's what
[2:40] we're pressing forward to
[2:42] we don't want to speculate or spend time
[2:45] wasting our energies thinking about
[2:47] where we contacted this sickness from
[2:50] or contacted this covet from whether it
[2:52] was
[2:53] due to colleges moving back in or or
[2:56] whether it was
[2:56] work or vice versa that doesn't matter
[2:59] what matters is that that this sickness
[3:02] came from
[3:03] him and as sons and daughters of god
[3:07] we bind this enemy in the name of jesus
[3:09] christ
[3:10] and we tell it to take its hands off of
[3:12] god's property
[3:14] we were redeemed by the blood of the
[3:16] lamb
[3:17] and cancer covet whatever the sickness
[3:21] you're facing is
[3:22] cannot be held and cannot hold you
[3:26] any longer in the name of jesus christ i
[3:30] speak those things over you
[3:33] we have been robbed of many of things in
[3:36] this past year
[3:37] many evangelists that couldn't come
[3:39] through
[3:40] many meetings that were canceled even
[3:42] our past labor day meetings this past
[3:44] weekend were cancelled
[3:46] our hearts were hurting in such a way
[3:48] knowing that the ministers that we had
[3:50] coming
[3:50] were preparing and been praying about
[3:53] things
[3:54] what they would speak to us but we had
[3:55] to cancel due to covet 19.
[3:58] we've been robbed of a lot of things and
[4:00] that's that's why we've presented these
[4:02] past
[4:03] labor day meetings to you in this way
[4:06] is to present meetings that have that
[4:09] have changed
[4:10] lives that have spoke volumes to our
[4:12] heart transformed our thinking our souls
[4:16] and stirred us in in faith like ever
[4:18] before
[4:19] tonight we'll be playing the service
[4:21] revealing of sons by brother tim pruitt
[4:24] that spoke to us that service at our
[4:26] labor day in 2018
[4:29] and that service was such a powerful
[4:31] service
[4:32] the pillar of fire was seen positions
[4:36] were seen
[4:37] in their lives and spiritual amnesia was
[4:39] thrown away
[4:41] and they sons came to themselves what an
[4:44] awesome service this will be for you to
[4:46] go back and listen to
[4:48] i have went back and listened to it many
[4:51] times
[4:52] and i have prayed much about the
[4:55] services that we would play to you
[4:56] during this time
[4:58] brother ron and myself we consulted and
[5:00] prayed about these things that we would
[5:02] pray
[5:02] and that we would play to you and
[5:05] knowing we wanted the mind of god
[5:07] and i believe that we've tapped into a
[5:09] channel so tonight as you listen
[5:13] know that the pillar of fire that was
[5:15] visible
[5:16] in 2018 in these services
[5:19] can be visible in your home whether you
[5:22] see him whether you don't he said that
[5:23] he'd be there
[5:25] if you gather in his name he'll be there
[5:28] and we agree together as a body of
[5:30] believers that we will be affected by
[5:32] these services
[5:33] though these services may be
[5:35] pre-recorded
[5:36] the god that we serve and the god that
[5:38] we preach
[5:40] is not a pre-recorded god he's a god
[5:42] that is always the same
[5:44] he never changes and is not affected by
[5:48] what men do or what they say
[5:50] but there is a god that is fighting for
[5:52] you in the midst of all of this
[5:54] he's fighting your battles i'd like to
[5:56] share a few quotes
[5:58] uh brother brother branham spoke on
[6:00] these things
[6:01] uh that i found this evening i'd like to
[6:03] share some of these things with you
[6:06] we also find in hebrews 12th chapter and
[6:09] 24th verse
[6:10] that the new testament the blood speaks
[6:12] better things the blood is speaking
[6:14] then the blood has got a voice and the
[6:16] voice of the blood is the word
[6:17] hallelujah
[6:18] that's what makes it whether it's right
[6:20] or wrong the word is identified by the
[6:22] voice of the blood
[6:23] the voice of the blood is the holy ghost
[6:25] that brings life
[6:27] it is life and it brings life to the
[6:29] word and quickens it amen and amen amen
[6:32] sure the blood speaks it speaks a better
[6:34] thing the old testament
[6:35] the blood spoke of guilt in new
[6:37] testament it speaks of redemption
[6:40] in the old testament it spoke of death
[6:42] and sorrow in the new testament it
[6:44] speaks of resurrection and life it
[6:45] speaks of healing it speaks of joy it
[6:47] speaks of power
[6:48] it speaks of life it speaks of heaven
[6:51] hallelujah
[6:52] and that same blood that was shed upon
[6:54] the ground
[6:56] that called out after his dead brother
[6:58] or called out after his brother that had
[7:00] killed him the blood of jesus christ
[7:02] covers all of our sins
[7:04] and speaks peace and resurrection and
[7:06] power and life and healing
[7:08] and all the redemptive blessings that
[7:09] the blood was shed for it speaks for us
[7:12] certainly the blood speaks omaha we must
[7:14] believe for ourself like they did down
[7:17] there in egypt
[7:18] and also for the house like they did in
[7:20] egypt and jericho and so forth we find
[7:22] out in acts
[7:23] 16 and 31 where that the roman centurion
[7:28] was
[7:28] to take his own life and was going to
[7:30] stab himself to death and paul told him
[7:32] to believe on the lord jesus and i
[7:35] and thy house shall be saved church this
[7:39] is a time
[7:40] not to be controlled by fear no worry
[7:43] nor
[7:44] doubt it is a time to be controlled by
[7:47] faith
[7:48] and if we allow fear to control our
[7:50] thinking control
[7:52] well are we going to get sick or where
[7:54] we're not going to get sick
[7:55] if we allow fear to control us
[7:59] our faith will never operate sons and
[8:02] daughters of god do not operate on fear
[8:04] they operate on faith the bible tells us
[8:07] in
[8:08] hebrews 11 and 1 now faith is the
[8:10] substance of things hoped for
[8:12] the evidence of things not seen
[8:15] we cannot see it but brother branham
[8:18] told us that there is a perfect body
[8:19] that is standing in front of us
[8:22] we walk right into that body because we
[8:25] know
[8:26] that the bible tells us that he was
[8:28] wounded for our transgressions he was
[8:30] bruised for our iniquities
[8:32] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[8:33] him and by
[8:35] his stripes we are healed we as a bride
[8:38] are facing a giant he may
[8:41] stare us down he may be as ugly as sin
[8:45] may have snot hanging down from his nose
[8:47] and a big old
[8:48] ugly unibrow teeth missing a great big
[8:52] loud voice just like goliath you
[8:55] remember that he's nothing but a bluff
[8:58] and all that he shoots at us as
[8:59] believers is lies
[9:01] but we as believers will take this giant
[9:03] down as david took down goliath
[9:06] no matter what comes remember he's the
[9:09] high priest of our confession
[9:11] and we didn't get to choose this battle
[9:14] but we get to choose our weapon
[9:16] we'll take the sword of the spirit and
[9:19] the shield of faith
[9:21] faith destroys the fiery darts we don't
[9:24] have to accept what he shoots at us
[9:27] we are made of faith and we are born
[9:30] to believe for the impossible we are
[9:32] believers
[9:33] and believing is what we do the enemy
[9:37] has thrown many
[9:38] grenades at us and we just keep crawling
[9:41] right over top of the pile of grenades
[9:44] and we come out winning every time you
[9:46] see the enemy is such a stupid devil
[9:48] that he forgot to pull the pen and if he
[9:51] did pull the pen it would blow up in his
[9:53] own face
[9:55] know this church there's no weapon that
[9:57] is formed against us that shall prosper
[10:00] that if god before us who can be against
[10:04] us
[10:05] god bless you as you listen to the
[10:07] service may your hearts be blessed
[10:09] and stirred god bless you keep the faith
[10:16] amen

[13:40] to god be the glory
[13:44] for the things which he has done
[13:47] now you can be seated just a moment
[13:49] wasn't that a presidential wave
[13:53] amen could he stay here just a moment
[13:56] with me
[13:56] you stay close to us
[14:00] so that night drew and i walked across
[14:04] the platform
[14:05] and i began to speak to them this
[14:07] predestinated moment
[14:10] and i think tonight is a predestinated
[14:12] moment
[14:12] [Applause]
[14:14] and i said as we we walked across the
[14:17] platform backwards and forwards
[14:19] tonight we're going to have a prayer
[14:21] line
[14:23] and where this little boy is walking god
[14:26] supernaturally touched him
[14:30] and tonight there's going to be miracle
[14:32] after miracle happen in this building

[14:47] was losing her hair
[14:49] and she was going bald and her hair was
[14:52] leaving and there's no reverse to it
[14:55] i can imagine what that does to to
[14:59] your your psyche and your emotions

[16:20] hallelujah
[16:30] now you can be seated again
[16:38] as a prayer line went forward
[16:41] there were many miracles that happened
[16:43] and we believed in this
[16:46] he's the god that does it and he's the
[16:49] god that's among us
[16:53] about three quarters the way through the
[16:55] prayer line they they carried me away

[31:57] with all my heart tonight
[32:01] the scripture would say as you find in
[32:04] daniel chapter 12 verse 1
[32:07] he would tell you in chapter 11
[32:10] just a little phrase i'm going to quote
[32:12] to you
[32:13] but the people that do know their god
[32:15] shall be strong
[32:17] and do exploits verse 2
[32:20] 1 of chapter 12 and at that time
[32:24] shall michael stand up the great prince
[32:26] which standeth for the children of thy
[32:28] people
[32:29] and there shall be a time of trouble
[32:32] such as never was since there was a
[32:34] nation even to that
[32:36] same time and at that time that people
[32:39] shall be delivered
[32:41] every one that shall be found written in
[32:43] the book
[32:45] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[32:47] of the earth shall awake some to
[32:49] everlasting life and
[32:51] some to shame and everlasting contempt
[32:54] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[32:57] brightness
[32:58] of the firmament and they that turn
[33:01] many to righteousness as the stars
[33:04] forever and ever
[33:08] but thou o daniels shut up the words and
[33:11] seal the book even to the time
[33:14] of the end many shall run to and fro and
[33:18] knowledge shall
[33:19] be increased and we'll drop down to
[33:21] verse eight and i heard but i
[33:24] understood not then
[33:27] said i o my lord what shall be the end
[33:30] of these things and he said
[33:31] go thy way daniel for the words are
[33:34] closed up and sealed
[33:36] till the time of the end and many shall
[33:39] be
[33:39] purified and made white and tried
[33:42] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[33:44] none of the wicked shall understand
[33:47] but the wise shall understand
[33:50] god bless you can be seated
[33:55] i'm going to speak to you tonight on the
[33:57] revealing of sons we're living in a
[34:00] wonderful
[34:01] hour it's one of the greatest hours that
[34:03] there's ever been on the face of the
[34:05] earth as god
[34:07] winds up end-time events
[34:10] and it's promised in the end time that
[34:12] there is to come
[34:14] an understanding a people that
[34:17] know their god in daniel's prophecy we
[34:20] see
[34:21] michael stands up he sees that
[34:24] at that time there's an understanding
[34:27] that comes
[34:28] something that happens to cause the
[34:30] elect
[34:32] those whose names are written in the
[34:34] book
[34:35] to believe john
[34:38] also in the book of revelation when you
[34:40] look at the end
[34:41] of the new testament there in that
[34:44] wonderful book of
[34:45] symbols the book of revelation um is
[34:48] very
[34:49] it's very similar as to what is seen in
[34:52] the book of daniel
[34:53] and daniel and john sees the archangels
[34:56] stand up
[34:58] and when he comes to understanding
[35:01] that um and when this angel stands up
[35:04] there comes an understanding
[35:06] that has been sealed from other
[35:09] generations
[35:11] you know daniel is the book of
[35:12] revelation to the jewish people
[35:15] as it's full of symbology as to what god
[35:17] will do
[35:18] for the jews and it's important
[35:22] though that we understand when we look
[35:24] at
[35:25] this that we you know there is um not
[35:28] just one seed of abraham there's a
[35:30] physical seed
[35:31] and then there is a royal seed and we
[35:34] are the royal seed of abraham by the new
[35:37] birth
[35:38] so the book of daniel shows the angel
[35:41] coming to the jews
[35:43] and the book of revelation shows the
[35:45] archangel coming to the gentiles
[35:48] and we are living in a time of great
[35:52] scriptural fulfillment
[35:54] god is moving in a very uh particular
[35:58] way where he is fulfilling the end time
[36:01] prophecies
[36:03] and we should be under a tremendous
[36:05] expectation
[36:07] because this is a time where there is
[36:11] great things that are happening this is
[36:13] a time of
[36:14] actually action that where heaven is
[36:17] moving
[36:18] in a way that other ages have never been
[36:21] privileged to see
[36:23] there can you know as as god works
[36:26] uh sometimes in his mysterious ways that
[36:30] there can actually be years and years
[36:32] and years sometimes
[36:33] of silence and then there will be a time
[36:36] of fulfillment and you
[36:40] are a blessed people in that that you
[36:42] are living in a time or season
[36:45] of fulfillment where god is
[36:48] actually acting doing some spectacular
[36:53] extraordinary things where heaven
[36:56] is pouring out on our behalf as
[37:00] he finishes the um the
[37:03] the pouring out of his spirit upon the
[37:06] gentile ages
[37:08] something that began back on the day of
[37:10] pentecost
[37:11] where he said in the last days that's
[37:14] the last 2 000 years days
[37:16] i will pour out my spirit upon
[37:20] all flesh and we are here in the day
[37:22] where he
[37:23] is finishing the pouring out the
[37:26] completely emptying
[37:27] out of his holy spirit right here
[37:31] in this last in the age and
[37:34] this is as i said is not a time where
[37:37] god is silent
[37:38] but where god is bringing an
[37:40] understanding
[37:42] revealing things to this generation as
[37:45] it wraps up
[37:47] the gentile dispensation and gets ready
[37:50] to take a pride in the rapture
[37:53] it's a great time where scripture that
[37:55] has been held in darkness
[37:57] for years and years and years
[38:00] now has come to light so we'll look in
[38:03] revelation chapter 10
[38:05] and verse 1 we'll see a parallel to the
[38:07] book of daniel and
[38:09] and we see in revelation 10 and 1 and i
[38:12] saw
[38:12] another mighty angel come down from
[38:15] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[38:17] rainbow was up on his head
[38:20] you see this is symbolic of his covenant
[38:23] as god reveals himself in
[38:27] his seven colors of the rainbow as
[38:30] as you know god does this uses that
[38:33] number seven
[38:34] in symbology in the scripture especially
[38:37] in the book of revelation
[38:39] and we would see the seven ages
[38:42] and seven horns on the lamb and seven
[38:45] eyes
[38:46] on the horns and seven stripes of blood
[38:49] and all of these all these things you
[38:51] know that god
[38:52] um expresses himself as
[38:56] as he descends from heaven with as a
[38:59] mighty angel clothed with a cloud
[39:01] and a rainbow is up on his head
[39:05] what an hour this is his face as as it
[39:08] were
[39:08] the sun the full countenance of
[39:12] the word of god the full illumination
[39:15] not a partial illumination but the full
[39:19] the fullness of his of his revelation
[39:23] coming forth the enlightenment of god's
[39:25] word
[39:26] and and his power of his strength to
[39:29] this generation this parallel was also
[39:32] the book of zechariah
[39:34] who would say you know after a dark and
[39:37] a dismal day
[39:39] after a time where um not much light has
[39:43] been that there will come a time that in
[39:45] the evening
[39:46] time it shall be light
[39:49] because the light would shine on parts
[39:52] of the word even that
[39:54] has never shown on before because god
[39:57] is bringing an understanding to the
[40:00] people of this
[40:01] generation amen and you're a blessed
[40:04] people because
[40:06] for you are as in the days of jesus
[40:09] when he said i speak to them in parables
[40:12] but to you it is given to know
[40:15] the mysteries of the kingdom for i say
[40:19] you are
[40:19] blessed you know your eyes have seen
[40:23] and your ears have heard what other
[40:26] generations was not
[40:27] able to see what prophets and wise men
[40:30] and seers
[40:31] were not able to see and yet god has
[40:34] imparted an
[40:34] understanding to the people of this last
[40:38] day
[40:39] i mean there were things that was once
[40:41] dark mystery
[40:42] that was just rich in symbology but
[40:45] that other ages walked in partial lights
[40:48] and gloomy days
[40:49] but as he said but it shall be light
[40:53] in the evening time and we're here
[40:57] in the time of that fulfillment of a day
[41:00] of an hour of a time where light
[41:04] has come in a generation to bring
[41:07] and illuminate the word hallelujah to
[41:10] make it
[41:11] plain before us so that we there would
[41:14] be
[41:14] no mistake so that we would have an
[41:17] understanding of the day and our
[41:21] visitation
[41:22] [Applause]
[41:24] hallelujah and the bible said and
[41:27] his feet were as pillars of fire
[41:32] hallelujah his feet is pillar of fire
[41:35] where his feet is upon the earth
[41:38] his feet is as pillars of fire because
[41:42] that's his body that's his believers
[41:48] where he touches the earth with the
[41:50] blessed holy spirit where the
[41:52] pillar of fire that same pillar of fire
[41:55] that was seen in the old testament that
[41:57] came on the day of pentecost
[41:59] that divided itself and then came
[42:01] individually upon the 120 in the upper
[42:04] room and
[42:05] then filled 3 000 souls afterwards
[42:08] and on and on and on and on and on
[42:12] hallelujah what was it you it is god
[42:16] in his church a triumphant church
[42:20] an overcoming church hallelujah one with
[42:24] feet that is upon the earth amount there
[42:28] is that
[42:28] powers are that the powers of that's in
[42:31] the sea
[42:32] and the powers of the earth is held
[42:34] under the dominion
[42:36] of a body a body of believers
[42:41] hallelujah saying that all things were
[42:44] under his feet
[42:46] and the clothes are under his feet and
[42:48] you are his body
[42:49] that means they are under your feet
[42:52] [Applause]
[42:55] hallelujah i'm speaking tonight to an
[42:58] invincible army
[43:00] i'm talking to a people in this
[43:02] generation
[43:03] that have been called for a purpose and
[43:06] for a reason
[43:08] to stand here in this last day a people
[43:11] with understanding
[43:16] so when a god is in his body
[43:19] and he will be here in the end time with
[43:22] his feet on the ground
[43:25] hallelujah but he's going to do it
[43:26] through a bride body
[43:28] an invincible army because as a
[43:31] precursor
[43:32] to his corporal coming he comes first in
[43:35] bride form
[43:37] before we can meet him in the air where
[43:40] two sons of god are revealed
[43:43] and manifested in the last day because
[43:45] all creation has been groaning
[43:48] and travailing unto this day waiting for
[43:51] you to get here
[43:53] and you are here
[43:55] [Applause]
[43:57] i'm talking about sons of god to be
[44:00] manifested
[44:02] and you are here
[44:03] [Applause]
[44:05] hallelujah now is your hour now is your
[44:08] season now is your time
[44:11] and you are now the actor on the scene
[44:14] others may have been the actor on the
[44:16] scene

[44:30] the jacob
[44:31] you are to be the joseph and let me just
[44:34] say
[44:34] you are to be the jesus manifested
[44:38] in bright form
[44:45] this is a glorious day and you have been
[44:50] called to be an integrable part
[44:53] of this day god can't do it without you
[44:58] because you're his feet you are
[45:02] where he has the boots on the ground
[45:05] hallelujah i mean 2 000 years ago he
[45:10] overcame to the body
[45:11] of the man of galilee but he's using
[45:14] your body tonight
[45:16] amen to overcome sin to overcome the
[45:19] darkness of this world
[45:20] to stand in this evil generation
[45:25] hallelujah amen
[45:28] he had in his hand a little book that
[45:30] was open
[45:32] and he said as you see it was previously
[45:35] closed
[45:36] in revelation 5 but now it is open
[45:40] aren't you glad tonight that we can say
[45:43] we are preaching from an
[45:45] open book we're no longer preaching from
[45:49] a closed book
[45:50] and trying to pry into it and guess what
[45:53] is in the contents
[45:56] but because god has opened the book
[46:00] he has brought an understanding in the
[46:02] last day
[46:02] [Applause]
[46:04] amen so there there he is his
[46:07] he's conquering remember who he is
[46:10] conquering through
[46:12] as i said he's already overcoming the
[46:14] man of galilee
[46:16] as a man of galilee he defeated devils
[46:20] amen but this time he's going to defeat
[46:22] the devil using your body
[46:26] i'm looking tonight at a bunch of devil
[46:29] defeaters
[46:30] a bunch of serpent bruisers
[46:34] come on church that seed of the woman
[46:38] that was seen and prophesied from
[46:40] generations back
[46:42] in the days of of adam where he said i'm
[46:45] gonna send
[46:46] a seed and that seed is gonna be a
[46:49] serpent bruiser
[46:50] i'll bruise the head of that serpent
[46:55] and i'll tell you you're not generations
[46:58] or offsprings of vipers
[47:00] but you are generation an offspring of
[47:03] almighty god that just as he was a
[47:06] serpent bruiser
[47:07] you have been called to be a serpent
[47:09] bruiser in your generation
[47:17] hallelujah the same glory that was in
[47:21] jesus
[47:22] is to be manifested in a people in the
[47:25] last day
[47:27] and he cried with a loud voice as when a
[47:30] lion roared
[47:32] it's a prophetic ministry and when he
[47:35] cried or shouted seven thunders uttered
[47:38] their voices
[47:40] these thunders are the voice of god but
[47:42] in john's day
[47:43] it wasn't to be understood yet
[47:46] amen you know john was a little
[47:49] different from daniel
[47:51] you see daniel heard it and didn't
[47:53] understand it
[47:55] john heard it and was going to write it
[47:57] and couldn't write the understanding
[48:01] it wasn't for them it was reserved for
[48:05] you to give
[48:06] you an understanding in the last day
[48:10] so you would know your position in the
[48:13] word
[48:14] and you would know the authority to
[48:16] which you have been
[48:18] called to
[48:23] hallelujah glory to god
[48:27] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[48:29] their voices i was about to write and i
[48:32] heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[48:34] me seal up those things which the seven
[48:36] thunders uttered
[48:37] and write them not and the angel which i
[48:40] saw stand upon the sea upon the earth
[48:44] and lifted up his hand to heaven and
[48:45] swear by him
[48:47] that liveth forever and ever who created
[48:50] heaven and the things that therein are
[48:51] in the earth and the things that therein
[48:53] are in the sea
[48:54] and the things which are therein that
[48:57] there should be time
[48:59] no longer i won't
[49:02] i won't delay the holding back
[49:06] of this to another generation now
[49:09] is the time to impart an understanding
[49:16] hallelujah why so that people that know
[49:19] their god
[49:21] can do x-voice
[49:24] are you with me now amen notice
[49:27] it tells you there comes an end to
[49:30] silences you know john
[49:31] john was going to write he said don't
[49:33] you write it
[49:34] set up don't you write it amen but they
[49:37] don't finish there
[49:39] but in the days of the voice of the
[49:43] seventh angel
[49:44] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[49:48] of god should be finished
[49:50] as he had declared to his servants the
[49:53] prophets
[49:54] are you with me now amen notice
[49:58] notice this will look at the next verse
[50:00] and the voice
[50:01] which i heard from heaven spake with me
[50:04] again

[50:06] seven
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:09] amen that's a good revelation to
[50:11] understand god sent us a forerunner
[50:14] amen that's a good under a revelation to
[50:17] understand there was a message in this
[50:19] last day
[50:20] come on amen but look at the next verse
[50:24] and the next verse said in the voice
[50:26] listen it
[50:27] it continues it continues
[50:31] past it doesn't end
[50:34] with the seventh angel it continues
[50:38] past and continues on
[50:41] and i heard the voice which i heard from
[50:44] heaven
[50:45] speaking to me again notice he's not
[50:48] finished he doesn't finish it all he
[50:50] didn't wind it all up
[50:52] with the seventh angel he continues on
[50:56] after the seventh angel finishes
[50:58] sounding his
[50:59] message and he said go and take the
[51:03] little book
[51:05] which is open you know you don't have to
[51:09] open it
[51:11] hey man none of us have to go and and
[51:14] walk into that pillar of fire and get
[51:16] the revelation
[51:17] of the seven thunders it's already been
[51:19] done

[51:24] hallelujah but you've got a job to do
[51:26] and that is

[52:09] give me that little book get me that
[52:13] person
[52:13] give me that word let me have it
[52:18] i want what you've got to offer god if
[52:20] you're given something in this
[52:22] generation
[52:23] i want it i've got a heart
[52:26] ready to receive it give me the little
[52:30] book
[52:33] hallelujah and he said and i'll take it
[52:36] and eat it up
[52:38] it'll make that belly bitter and it
[52:40] shall make but shall be in that mouth
[52:42] sweetest honey
[52:43] and i took the little book out of the
[52:45] angel's hand and ate it up
[52:46] and it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[52:49] and as soon as i ate it
[52:52] my belly was bitter you see the word
[52:56] causes a war within your
[52:59] inner being
[53:01] [Music]
[53:01] [Applause]
[53:03] throwing out unbelief throwing out doubt
[53:07] throwing out the fears throwing out
[53:09] traditions of man
[53:12] come on now amen and so is the
[53:15] message god gives us in the last day
[53:18] causes a struggle
[53:20] within you but i got some news for you
[53:24] somebody's gonna keep it down
[53:34] i've seen a lot of people in this day
[53:36] speeded up
[53:39] but i'm one of those that's gonna keep
[53:41] it down
[53:45] i ain't giving up on what god gave me
[53:49] i've ate this word and i'm keeping it
[53:51] down i don't care how
[53:53] big my belly gets bitter i don't care
[53:55] about the struggle within me
[53:57] but i'm keeping that word down i'm not
[54:00] picking it up
[54:07] hallelujah somebody's going to eat it
[54:10] and digest it
[54:12] until it becomes a word a word out of
[54:15] their life
[54:16] [Applause]
[54:19] because there he says thou must prophesy
[54:24] again you see when if you keep it down
[54:28] it's going to come up as a word out of
[54:31] your life
[54:33] thou must prophesy again before many
[54:36] peoples and nations and tongues and
[54:39] kings they that know their god
[54:43] shall be strong and do exploits
[54:47] it's the time for the bride's prophecy
[54:51] amen to prophesy again
[54:54] amen it was prophesied to the seventh
[54:56] angel
[54:58] we're not adding to it we're not taken
[55:00] away from it
[55:03] we don't need to embellish it amen
[55:07] you don't need me to bring clarity to it
[55:10] amen god said it the way he wanted and
[55:13] he wanted it the way he said it
[55:15] and i'm satisfied with it all i'm going
[55:18] to do is eat it
[55:20] digest it let it become a life in me
[55:24] and speak it that's my promise
[55:27] that's my word
[55:29] [Applause]
[55:32] amen and when your word becomes the same
[55:34] as god's word
[55:36] i'll tell you what all hell has to give
[55:39] way to the name of jesus christ
[55:41] [Applause]
[55:46] these words of the prophet daniel
[55:50] were spoke of the people of israel it's
[55:52] a promise left to them
[55:54] however the scripture is not only to the
[55:56] natural seed of abraham
[55:59] but it's also to the royal seed
[56:02] amen you are living in a blessed hour
[56:06] amen it's a time of michael standing up
[56:12] daniel 12 parallels revelation chapter
[56:14] 10 the scene just varies a bit
[56:17] and so is different because daniel's
[56:18] prophecy is to a natural israel
[56:21] and their promised restoration where
[56:23] they are gathered in their land
[56:25] but there's also a spiritual israel
[56:28] the royal seed of abraham who are also
[56:32] been restored
[56:33] back to their land amen who are in the
[56:37] homeland of the word of god tonight
[56:40] revelation chapter 5 also shows us the
[56:44] lamb
[56:44] standing up to take in the book to
[56:46] remove its seals
[56:48] you see the scripture um
[56:52] you know is is manifesting itself even
[56:54] as we speak
[56:56] you see just just as the resurrected
[56:59] christ
[57:00] appeared on the road to emmaus
[57:03] even so the the resurrected christ
[57:07] is appearing to his people here in the
[57:10] last day
[57:12] amen where he walked with his disciples
[57:14] after the resurrection he was
[57:16] bringing them an awakening of the
[57:19] meaning of the scriptures
[57:22] you see he in that emmaus walk he would
[57:25] actually
[57:26] open up the scriptures to them and point
[57:29] out to him it was
[57:30] written in isaiah it was written in
[57:32] jeremiah
[57:33] it was written in the psalms concerning
[57:36] me
[57:37] is that right because the reason why he
[57:40] was having to
[57:41] bring this understanding was because
[57:44] though he had walked with him for three
[57:46] and a half years
[57:47] that that they were being blinded
[57:50] because there was a terrible blinding
[57:52] coming upon israel the jews at that time
[57:56] are you with me amen so they they were
[57:58] not
[57:59] even the disciples close by jesus was
[58:02] not even
[58:03] seeing the purpose of jesus christ
[58:07] and this was the reason of their
[58:10] delusion
[58:12] amen because because
[58:15] and the discouragement they had you know
[58:17] that that they were going through
[58:19] then and if you notice when and he
[58:22] had given them specific instructions you
[58:25] go
[58:25] and meet me or go to go to a certain
[58:29] place and
[58:30] i'm going to meet with you and carry in
[58:32] jerusalem and
[58:34] wait there until there's power endued
[58:36] from on high
[58:38] but instead these these men are so
[58:41] disillusioned
[58:42] they're walking the opposite direction
[58:44] they're going down to emmaus
[58:47] but i want you to understand these were
[58:50] predestinated seed
[58:53] and god wasn't going to lose of one of
[58:55] them
[58:57] amen so they're going the wrong
[58:59] direction so he just goes and starts
[59:01] walking with them
[59:03] and begins to open the scripture to them
[59:05] to
[59:06] open their understanding
[59:09] to what was happening in their day in
[59:12] their hour
[59:14] oh may he walk with us tonight
[59:17] may you walk down these aisles tonight
[59:20] may come
[59:20] right down to your seat tonight amen and
[59:23] open your
[59:24] understanding to the day the hour that
[59:27] you are living in
[59:30] that you'll know what your message is
[59:32] what your purpose is
[59:35] amen because our purpose is more than
[59:38] just to come into a nice little building
[59:40] in a nice little church and
[59:42] have something as nice as we did and the
[59:44] baptist methodists are pentecostal
[59:47] or maybe even a little nicer than we had
[59:49] back there our purpose is more
[59:51] than that it's more than just a church
[59:54] membership
[59:55] it's more than being a pretty good
[59:57] christian
[59:58] it's more than being a denominational
[1:00:01] minded
[1:00:02] individual there that in and out and up
[1:00:05] and down and has no
[1:00:06] passion amen but i'll tell you when he
[1:00:10] revealed himself to them
[1:00:12] he they had a passion to get back there
[1:00:15] to jerusalem
[1:00:17] to tell the rest of them and he appeared
[1:00:19] to me
[1:00:20] he came to me he turned my life around
[1:00:25] amen he came to me he revealed himself
[1:00:29] in a
[1:00:30] particular way he opened up the
[1:00:31] scripture when our eyes were
[1:00:34] open we knew him
[1:00:37] i seek god open our eyes
[1:00:40] with the blinding that's going on in
[1:00:42] laodicea
[1:00:43] opening our eyes should we feeling of
[1:00:46] christ
[1:00:50] no matter what you what direction you're
[1:00:53] headed
[1:00:54] that resurrected christ is
[1:00:58] is there to reveal himself to you to get
[1:01:01] you turned back around
[1:01:04] amen to bring you back to the promise
[1:01:08] to bring you to the realization of the
[1:01:10] scripture
[1:01:11] that is being fulfilled in this hour
[1:01:15] now once again it must be fulfilled even
[1:01:18] as
[1:01:18] jesus would say to them that in all
[1:01:21] things
[1:01:22] then all things must be fulfilled
[1:01:26] which were written in the law and the
[1:01:28] prophets and the psalms
[1:01:30] concerning me and i want you to
[1:01:34] understand
[1:01:35] he brings it right now down to this hour
[1:01:37] to this day
[1:01:38] and he says it all things must be
[1:01:41] fulfilled
[1:01:43] amen all things of the old and the new
[1:01:46] testament
[1:01:47] must be fulfilled which were written
[1:01:51] amen in all the scripture concerning the
[1:01:54] bride
[1:01:55] in this end time hallelujah
[1:01:59] and then the bible said he opened their
[1:02:02] understanding
[1:02:04] that they might understand the
[1:02:06] scriptures
[1:02:09] hallelujah an understanding came
[1:02:12] that wiped away the blindness of the age
[1:02:17] hallelujah you see jesus
[1:02:20] he he was not affected by the blinding
[1:02:23] of the age
[1:02:24] but he would look into the scripture and
[1:02:26] he would see himself
[1:02:28] as jonah was in the belly of the well
[1:02:32] he would look back to abraham and he
[1:02:34] would say
[1:02:35] um and see himself there and he would
[1:02:38] say before abraham was
[1:02:40] i am he would look and see
[1:02:43] himself in solomon and say but a greater
[1:02:46] than
[1:02:46] solomon is here amen he relied on the
[1:02:51] scripture
[1:02:52] to tell him his day his hour
[1:02:55] his moment because the scripture must
[1:02:59] be fulfilled amen if i can get something
[1:03:03] to you tonight
[1:03:04] the scripture in this day
[1:03:07] must be fulfilled hallelujah
[1:03:10] and he opened their understanding that
[1:03:12] they might understand the scripture
[1:03:14] oh god strike our hearts tonight with
[1:03:17] that understanding
[1:03:19] that comes to your heart that gives you
[1:03:22] a passion for god
[1:03:24] a passion for truth daniel wanted to
[1:03:27] know but it was not
[1:03:29] time to know john wanted to write it and
[1:03:32] it wasn't time for it to be written
[1:03:35] and daniel would say oh my lord
[1:03:38] what shall be the end of these things
[1:03:41] but there comes an end
[1:03:45] to the lack of knowledge
[1:03:49] and he said go thy way daniel come on
[1:03:52] now
[1:03:53] for the words are closed up and sealed
[1:03:58] until the time of the end
[1:04:03] there comes a time where
[1:04:07] understanding comes
[1:04:10] and this understanding comes so that it
[1:04:13] can
[1:04:14] manifest all the scripture that has been
[1:04:17] written
[1:04:18] of sons of god
[1:04:22] hallelujah now he says here
[1:04:26] go thy way daniel verse 9 for the for
[1:04:29] the words are closed up and sealed to
[1:04:31] the time of the end
[1:04:32] but many shall be purified
[1:04:35] and made white and fried but the wicked
[1:04:38] shall be shall do wickedly and
[1:04:42] none of the wicked shall understand
[1:04:46] i'm glad he didn't stop there but he
[1:04:49] said but the wise
[1:04:51] shall understand
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:56] amen oh i want to be purified
[1:05:00] i want to be made white amen but i also
[1:05:03] want an understanding
[1:05:05] i want to understand my day my hour my
[1:05:08] visitation
[1:05:10] amen god does some extraordinary things
[1:05:14] to get you to believe
[1:05:18] get you to recognize your day an hour
[1:05:21] he does extraordinary things to get you
[1:05:24] to start
[1:05:25] having faith you know he wondered
[1:05:28] himself as he
[1:05:29] had mused and looked so far ahead
[1:05:32] and he says i wonder when the son of man
[1:05:35] cometh
[1:05:36] will i find faith on the earth
[1:05:39] is that right amen he was looking down
[1:05:42] and was wondering
[1:05:43] if there would be faith and actually
[1:05:46] friends
[1:05:47] he can look ahead and see there wouldn't
[1:05:50] be any faith
[1:05:53] we're in a faithless age in a faithless
[1:05:55] generation
[1:05:56] in a faithless society even among
[1:05:59] faithless
[1:06:00] churches that call the name of jesus
[1:06:03] christ
[1:06:05] amen and we were all in that kind of
[1:06:07] condition
[1:06:09] but god was so determined that he would
[1:06:12] have a pride
[1:06:13] he would send elijah the prophet to turn
[1:06:17] the heart to faith again
[1:06:19] amen so he saw that there would be a
[1:06:22] need
[1:06:23] to send some extraordinary things
[1:06:26] to turn your heart from unbelief to
[1:06:30] faith amen
[1:06:32] because he said if i don't send elijah
[1:06:35] i'll have to just
[1:06:36] wipe the whole thing off with a curse
[1:06:42] hallelujah amen
[1:06:45] now in the days of sarah sarah you know
[1:06:49] she was she was in years of unbelief
[1:06:52] not just days years
[1:06:56] you know maybe she started off with a
[1:06:58] hope
[1:07:00] you know and then every year it passes
[1:07:02] and you know she
[1:07:03] sees the barren woman and you know and
[1:07:06] despair gets worse
[1:07:08] every year
[1:07:11] then she reaches a certain age and she
[1:07:14] gives up
[1:07:16] it ain't for me i can never do it
[1:07:20] i'll never have this child i'm past
[1:07:24] child baron
[1:07:27] amen the god would allow her to get way
[1:07:31] past child parent so he could
[1:07:34] show that this was not a child of man
[1:07:39] but this was the seed of god
[1:07:41] predestinated to come forth
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:46] hallelujah amen and god would do some
[1:07:50] extraordinary things
[1:07:52] to start getting her heart to believe
[1:07:55] she was if you even listen to brother
[1:07:57] branham about it he would talk about
[1:07:59] sarah
[1:08:00] and even her attitude
[1:08:03] she had a rotten attitude she was so
[1:08:06] full of unbelief it
[1:08:08] ain't for me and you know and he said
[1:08:10] that day when the angel comes she was no
[1:08:13] in no mood to even receive it
[1:08:16] maybe that's the way you are tonight
[1:08:18] you're just not in any mood
[1:08:21] i've heard of a god and i heard he can
[1:08:23] do and he's done it for this
[1:08:25] but i ain't in any kind of humor to
[1:08:27] receive it for myself
[1:08:29] but god is a god that will not allow his
[1:08:32] seed to sit there
[1:08:34] and unbelieve in a faithless situation
[1:08:37] he'll do extraordinary things to cause
[1:08:41] them to start believing
[1:08:47] hallelujah amen god would
[1:08:51] actually pull from the elements
[1:08:54] create himself a body
[1:08:57] a man you stumble about squirrels god
[1:09:00] created himself a body
[1:09:04] pull the elements out of the earth and
[1:09:06] pull them all together and step
[1:09:08] right down into it and god begin to walk
[1:09:12] down among
[1:09:12] abraham and sarah because god was
[1:09:16] determined
[1:09:18] that this little woman who was a part of
[1:09:20] the promise
[1:09:21] would not remain in unbelief
[1:09:27] oh if god was that determined for sarah
[1:09:30] how much more is he determined for his
[1:09:34] pride in this last day i will not
[1:09:37] leave her sitting in unbelief
[1:09:49] i'll do extreme things
[1:09:52] amount i'll do extraordinary things
[1:09:55] but i will get sarah to start believing
[1:10:05] hallelujah you ought to know tonight god
[1:10:07] ain't gonna leave you
[1:10:08] sitting in a lukewarm complacent
[1:10:12] condition
[1:10:14] amen god's going to do the extraordinary
[1:10:19] i'm looking for extraordinary things in
[1:10:21] this service tonight
[1:10:23] [Applause]
[1:10:26] amen god using some extreme
[1:10:29] measures a man she'd sat for years and
[1:10:33] years
[1:10:34] an unbelief but it would take an
[1:10:36] awakening of her faith
[1:10:40] amen amen that's what we're saying
[1:10:44] now you see it isn't
[1:10:49] that the faith isn't there
[1:10:53] amen there needs to be an awakening
[1:10:58] faith has gone dormant
[1:11:01] even today in too many souls
[1:11:06] we have allowed the confusion of the age
[1:11:08] to crowd out the voice of god
[1:11:12] and it isn't that the faith isn't there
[1:11:15] it is that
[1:11:15] faith needs an awakening
[1:11:19] to realize that you are the generation
[1:11:23] you are the people chosen
[1:11:26] you are the one that he said would be
[1:11:29] delivered
[1:11:30] everyone whose names are in the book
[1:11:34] is your name in the book well he's
[1:11:37] destined you for deliverance
[1:11:40] and he ain't gonna leave you sitting
[1:11:42] down in
[1:11:43] unbelief and darkness and lukewarmness
[1:11:47] in a backslidden condition this god will
[1:11:50] go to extraordinary measures
[1:11:54] to reach right down to where you are
[1:11:57] [Music]
[1:11:58] [Applause]
[1:12:03] god would do extreme things
[1:12:07] he would take on flesh so he could
[1:12:10] change an old grandma
[1:12:13] 90 years old and change her
[1:12:16] and make her so beautiful in so much
[1:12:20] that a
[1:12:20] king would want to marry her
[1:12:25] that's pretty extreme
[1:12:30] hallelujah amen you think about sarah
[1:12:34] i'm thinking about another old woman
[1:12:36] who's been
[1:12:37] barren for 2 000 years and she's been
[1:12:40] decrepit
[1:12:41] in unbelief walking around on an old
[1:12:44] cane
[1:12:45] of doubts and fear but i'll tell you you
[1:12:48] have had an awakening
[1:12:49] faith has started coming in your heart

[1:13:33] into heart
[1:13:34] and keeping your soul
[1:13:37] who she is in this last day
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:44] hallelujah
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:50] god said he would go to the extreme
[1:13:54] to get his people to believe
[1:13:57] he will have a pride and he will have
[1:14:00] her ready
[1:14:02] and he'll do extreme things to get her
[1:14:04] ready
[1:14:06] amen in the first exit is god went to
[1:14:08] extreme things
[1:14:10] amen to get to israel in her homeland
[1:14:13] this was necessary to get her from
[1:14:15] unbelief to faith
[1:14:17] to get her back to believing again
[1:14:20] satan ideas was so beat down and
[1:14:22] defeated in slavery
[1:14:24] until it would take extreme measures
[1:14:29] amen to give them faith to believe

[1:14:38] the word to have to create things to
[1:14:42] call for frogs

[1:14:47] without he would actually the word would
[1:14:49] actually do
[1:14:50] things go out in creation
[1:14:54] that was way beyond the magic of the of
[1:14:57] the egyptians
[1:15:00] amen that was so extreme
[1:15:05] come on church god wanted his people to
[1:15:08] believe amen
[1:15:10] he had to give them a faith and meant to
[1:15:13] get up out of that old that old slave
[1:15:16] camp
[1:15:18] leave that old home of bondage
[1:15:21] leave that slave master behind
[1:15:24] and get here and follow this prophet
[1:15:28] in an exodus
[1:15:34] hallelujah amen
[1:15:37] in exodus from sin when jesus came
[1:15:41] had jesus only hung on the cross he
[1:15:44] would have just been one of those
[1:15:46] nameless jews that had died under the
[1:15:49] roman powers
[1:15:51] that's pretty common they did it for any
[1:15:54] reason for
[1:15:55] every reason but because god did extreme
[1:15:59] things
[1:16:00] there were angelic visitation that would
[1:16:03] even announce the forerunner's birth
[1:16:08] amen to make him make him a forerunner
[1:16:10] of his
[1:16:11] of his coming god would do
[1:16:14] something very extreme he would take an
[1:16:18] unmarried woman a virgin
[1:16:21] and bring forth a child in her womb
[1:16:25] having never known a man now that is
[1:16:28] pretty extreme
[1:16:31] amen this has never been duplicated
[1:16:35] god took a girl who had never known a
[1:16:38] man
[1:16:38] and that which was conceived of her was
[1:16:42] the holy ghost
[1:16:44] amen jesus jesus well in his ministry he
[1:16:49] took it even to a higher level of doing
[1:16:52] extreme
[1:16:53] things amen his miracles were extreme
[1:16:57] miracles i mean they
[1:17:00] think about it it was thousands and
[1:17:03] thousands of years
[1:17:04] of jewish history and perhaps never a
[1:17:08] blind eye
[1:17:09] open but jesus would take a man
[1:17:12] with no eyeballs
[1:17:16] and he would take and spit in the dirt
[1:17:20] and get that spindle of clay and roll it
[1:17:23] around in his hands
[1:17:26] and he would make an eyeball and would
[1:17:30] stick it in an
[1:17:30] empty socket
[1:17:34] amen and then take and spit again
[1:17:37] and he would take that and he would roll
[1:17:39] another eyeball
[1:17:41] and stick it in the other socket
[1:17:45] and then he would say now go and wash
[1:17:47] the excess out
[1:17:48] over in the pool of siloam
[1:17:52] and the man came back seeing
[1:17:56] he had eyeballs he could see
[1:18:00] hallelujah amen oh
[1:18:03] hallelujah god was doing some extreme
[1:18:06] things
[1:18:09] i can just imagine brother when jesus
[1:18:12] did this
[1:18:13] he reached down he says you know this
[1:18:15] reminds me when i made man
[1:18:18] in the beginning and when i created when
[1:18:21] i
[1:18:21] formed his body out of dust and i made
[1:18:25] and made out
[1:18:26] those sockets there with my thumb
[1:18:29] and i rolled out my balls
[1:18:32] of clay and i stuck it in there
[1:18:38] amen then i breathed upon it and said
[1:18:41] live
[1:18:41] [Applause]
[1:18:43] and the breath of life entered there but
[1:18:46] light came in the
[1:18:47] eyeballs in the ears and everything else
[1:18:50] the creator
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:18:53] we're standing there again doing some
[1:18:56] extreme
[1:18:57] things
[1:18:58] [Applause]
[1:19:02] creating eyeballs all over again
[1:19:06] hallelujah amen to get people to believe
[1:19:11] amen there he would heal the sick he
[1:19:14] would raise the dead
[1:19:16] he would let lies was not not just get
[1:19:19] sick and have a healing
[1:19:20] he would wait until he dies then he's
[1:19:23] buried for four days
[1:19:28] amen so there's no question
[1:19:32] and then he would say roll away the
[1:19:33] stone
[1:19:35] and call his name and a man who had been
[1:19:39] dead in the grave four days come out of
[1:19:41] there
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:43] hallelujah amen what was it god was
[1:19:47] doing
[1:19:47] extreme things he would do it until
[1:19:50] demons would
[1:19:51] actually beg him
[1:19:55] beg him not to torment
[1:19:59] them anymore
[1:20:04] amen toward the tormentors devils
[1:20:07] themselves crying out
[1:20:12] are you with me cry up don't don't
[1:20:15] don't torment me
[1:20:20] i want to get something to you friends i
[1:20:23] mean this

[1:20:30] tonight
[1:20:36] blessed are the people whose god is the
[1:20:39] lord
[1:20:40] [Applause]

[1:20:50] things in this
[1:20:51] last day amen i you know i don't have
[1:20:55] time to go in it tonight but
[1:20:57] i i think if you just look up some of
[1:20:59] the history
[1:21:00] of little david walker nine-year-old boy
[1:21:03] that he would call to the ministry he
[1:21:06] was
[1:21:07] just as a five-year-old boy he got he
[1:21:10] got um
[1:21:11] blindness in his eyes got an infections
[1:21:13] he went blind
[1:21:14] and um you know he at five years old he
[1:21:17] asked his daddy
[1:21:18] if he could fast he said i feel led to
[1:21:21] fast daddy and daddy said
[1:21:23] let me fast for you i see you're too
[1:21:26] young to do it and he said no
[1:21:28] i need to fast and this five-year-old
[1:21:31] boy began to fast he fasted for three
[1:21:34] days
[1:21:35] and after on the third day after he had
[1:21:37] given up
[1:21:39] and he was discouraged because that
[1:21:42] nothing had happened and
[1:21:43] he was still blind he had a he heard a
[1:21:47] voice
[1:21:48] that spoke out and above him and he said
[1:21:50] look up
[1:21:52] and he opened his eyes and he could see
[1:21:55] and this little five-year-old boy began
[1:21:57] to shout and speak in other languages
[1:22:01] nine years old he had a vision of heaven

[1:22:05] into heaven and then was told to preach

[1:24:08] little ad in the newspaper and he put
[1:24:10] one about this big

[1:24:16] coming out and this little boy
[1:24:18] having nothing to say i'm talking about
[1:24:21] god doing extreme things
[1:24:24] amen and so he he would he he would he
[1:24:27] would then go and take

[1:24:31] he said ah

[1:24:35] it's a little bitty ad and nobody will
[1:24:36] come

[1:24:39] and he told the woman
[1:24:40] that it was written listen i've got i've
[1:24:42] made a deal with my boy and i've got to
[1:24:44] go through with it and really you know i
[1:24:46] don't think there'll be anybody here but
[1:24:47] we're going to
[1:24:48] have this meeting anyway tonight
[1:24:52] now the doors opened that night and the
[1:24:55] fire chief came and the mayor and
[1:24:58] pretty soon there was 700 people in the
[1:25:01] building
[1:25:02] [Applause]
[1:25:04] you know why because if god calls you to
[1:25:06] preach he's going to have somebody
[1:25:08] that'll listen
[1:25:12] amen and so he started you know
[1:25:16] that that um that particular night
[1:25:19] he he his dad uh you know they got up
[1:25:22] and sang some songs and whatever he said
[1:25:24] okay folks
[1:25:25] i don't know what little david's got for
[1:25:27] us tonight but come on little david
[1:25:28] and and and and speak and little david
[1:25:31] took a text
[1:25:33] opened his bible and began to open his
[1:25:35] mouth
[1:25:39] and some 30 minutes later the whole the
[1:25:41] holy spirit began to take him over some
[1:25:43] 30 minutes later
[1:25:44] the altars were full people repenting
[1:25:48] and calling out to god
[1:25:52] little david went from there into an
[1:25:53] international meetings he preached
[1:25:55] meetings with william branham for some
[1:25:57] services in california and
[1:25:59] florida and he and and he would say
[1:26:01] brother branham
[1:26:02] william branham's gift was unmatched
[1:26:06] nobody has ever been able to impersonate
[1:26:08] it said
[1:26:09] it was accurate time after time
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:14] amen so you see god would you do that to
[1:26:18] take a little boy
[1:26:19] like david walker to show it wasn't
[1:26:22] education you needed
[1:26:24] no it wasn't degrees from a seminary but
[1:26:27] it was god
[1:26:28] calling an anointing that's what was
[1:26:31] needed
[1:26:32] amen showing again that he would bring
[1:26:35] forth the capstone
[1:26:36] as as zechariah said and it wouldn't be
[1:26:40] by
[1:26:40] might and it wouldn't be mine by men's
[1:26:43] power
[1:26:44] but it would be by my spirit saith
[1:26:47] the lord and god would do that with a
[1:26:50] little boy
[1:26:51] to show an extreme measure because he
[1:26:54] was about to send
[1:26:55] a prophet on the scene with a seventh
[1:26:58] grade
[1:26:59] education
[1:27:02] and he was showing before he even came
[1:27:04] that god
[1:27:06] could take a little nine-year-old boy
[1:27:08] and make a preacher out of him
[1:27:12] that would win souls around the world
[1:27:14] because he's about ready to send a
[1:27:17] prophet
[1:27:19] uneducated untrained
[1:27:23] halting grammar to use him
[1:27:26] because god was doing extraordinary
[1:27:30] things
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:34] hallelujah i'm only one hour now into my
[1:27:38] two hour sermon
[1:27:47] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:27:51] 1933 and on the ohio river
[1:27:55] 85 years ago now there was a voice from
[1:27:58] heaven that said as
[1:28:00] john the baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:28:03] first coming of christ
[1:28:05] you're sent with a message to forerun
[1:28:08] the second coming of christ
[1:28:11] amen that was god's word
[1:28:14] amen he said i'm going to send a message
[1:28:18] to forerun to prepare the people
[1:28:21] for the second coming of christ you know
[1:28:24] it wasn't good enough for god to do that
[1:28:27] once
[1:28:28] god would do that again and again
[1:28:31] and again
[1:28:35] amen in 1946 these are these are now
[1:28:38] two prophecies 72 years ago
[1:28:41] through tongues interpretation there
[1:28:44] down in texas
[1:28:45] way down in their brother branham was in
[1:28:47] them in a meeting there
[1:28:49] and and someone jumped up a man jumped
[1:28:52] up and began to speak in tongues another
[1:28:54] man stood up and interpreted
[1:28:56] and he said as john the baptist was sent
[1:28:59] for on the first coming of christ you're
[1:29:02] sent with a message to forerun the
[1:29:04] second coming of christ
[1:29:08] amen these are not secret things they're
[1:29:11] right there
[1:29:12] you can read them for yourself and a man
[1:29:14] sent from god
[1:29:16] written by none other than that than the
[1:29:19] contemporaries of brother branham at
[1:29:20] that time gordon lindsay and jack moore
[1:29:24] they were testifying of what god was
[1:29:26] speaking
[1:29:29] hey man when brother branham heard those
[1:29:31] words he he stopped and
[1:29:33] and came out and said that man that
[1:29:35] spoke in tongues where are you from and
[1:29:36] he
[1:29:37] told him and said do you know this man
[1:29:38] here no i've never seen him before
[1:29:42] and he said you know but the holy spirit
[1:29:44] had fallen upon
[1:29:45] one with tongues and then the other
[1:29:47] interpretation and began to say the same
[1:29:50] thing
[1:29:51] that was set down at the river because
[1:29:54] god
[1:29:55] was wanting this generation to
[1:29:58] understand he was doing something
[1:30:01] spectacular
[1:30:03] amen he was sending a message
[1:30:09] to foreigners first of the second coming
[1:30:11] of christ
[1:30:13] amen then it would happen again
[1:30:16] would happen over in kansas again it
[1:30:19] would
[1:30:20] it actually would happen three different
[1:30:21] times in brother branham's
[1:30:23] meetings there but in the in the third
[1:30:25] incident i believe it was was anna
[1:30:27] schrader
[1:30:28] who was in kansas and stood up in the
[1:30:31] meeting there this is all the year
[1:30:32] 1946 and said ask john the baptist
[1:30:36] was sent for around the first coming of
[1:30:38] christ you're sent with a message to
[1:30:41] forerun his second coming
[1:30:44] amen it would be it would be a jack coe
[1:30:48] that would say
[1:30:49] i i realize when i was
[1:30:52] there in the meeting and even if i can
[1:30:55] recall this
[1:30:56] you know the way that it was um i didn't
[1:30:59] look at my
[1:31:00] history tonight before i came but but
[1:31:03] jack cole was sitting there in unbelief
[1:31:07] he come there and he just he believed
[1:31:09] that brother branham was
[1:31:10] you know was a charlatan he wasn't
[1:31:13] really
[1:31:14] uh this wasn't real you know how it is
[1:31:17] he was skeptical amen
[1:31:21] and his brother and and there was a man
[1:31:24] there
[1:31:24] that without eyeballs in the meeting
[1:31:28] and and brother branham um prayed for
[1:31:31] him and said in three days
[1:31:33] you will be seen jack said
[1:31:36] anybody could say that
[1:31:40] you know the audience will never know
[1:31:42] the difference this man disappears and
[1:31:44] you know we won't know because in three
[1:31:47] days he'll be seen
[1:31:49] and brother branham on his way out of
[1:31:51] the tent that night
[1:31:53] he walks by him and he pats him on the
[1:31:56] leg
[1:31:58] and he said don't just keep their
[1:32:01] doubting
[1:32:03] you're going to have a ministry like
[1:32:05] this yourself
[1:32:08] you'll pray for the sick also
[1:32:12] well you know that in itself thrilled
[1:32:14] jack to hear that
[1:32:16] but he still was unconvinced and he
[1:32:19] waited around in the meeting till three
[1:32:21] days later here come that blind man with
[1:32:23] eyeballs in his head
[1:32:25] seed because
[1:32:29] even he was taking jack coe and making a
[1:32:32] believer
[1:32:33] out of him i mean
[1:32:36] t.l osborne added his voice to the
[1:32:38] others he said the first night
[1:32:40] i heard and saw brother branham minister
[1:32:43] i didn't hear a voice
[1:32:44] i didn't know it had been said of him
[1:32:46] and i didn't know that the voice from
[1:32:48] heaven had spoken these words
[1:32:50] i knew nothing of that i had not been
[1:32:52] with any of the other ministers that
[1:32:54] believed in him
[1:32:55] for most of those i was with did not
[1:32:58] believe in him
[1:32:59] but like a voice and yet not like a
[1:33:02] voice i heard it
[1:33:03] i know it it came to me as john the
[1:33:06] baptist was sent as a forerunner of his
[1:33:08] first coming
[1:33:10] william branham his son is a forerunner
[1:33:12] of his
[1:33:13] second coming
[1:33:16] amen you see once more god would take
[1:33:20] men who were called of god to preach
[1:33:24] in that era in time and reconfirm this
[1:33:27] time upon time again that god was doing
[1:33:31] something spectacular
[1:33:33] to prepare a people for his
[1:33:36] second coming i'm just going to say
[1:33:39] tonight we cannot afford to go to sleep
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:44] amen god has spoken particularly to your
[1:33:49] day to your
[1:33:50] hour to awaken your faith
[1:33:54] god doing some extreme things to let you
[1:33:57] know
[1:33:58] that you're in the very cycle the very
[1:34:01] hour you are in the very day
[1:34:04] of his coming how can you sit complacent
[1:34:10] how can you treat these moments as
[1:34:13] just another moment in time
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:20] i want to ask you tonight could god have
[1:34:22] made a mistake
[1:34:25] the god who time after time showed
[1:34:28] himself accurate with his word
[1:34:30] and how accurate his word could be could
[1:34:33] he have made a mistake
[1:34:36] could he could he could it be that the
[1:34:38] age would get so faithless
[1:34:40] and the time so evil and laodicea would
[1:34:44] get so bad even that the majority of the
[1:34:47] aides would put him outside
[1:34:48] his church and god would finally just
[1:34:51] have to give up
[1:34:52] on his divine plans and go back into the
[1:34:55] heavens and forget it all
[1:34:57] and just become an absentee creator of
[1:34:59] the earth
[1:35:00] is that possible amen could it be that
[1:35:04] god made a mistake
[1:35:06] saying that this was the forerunner of
[1:35:08] his second coming could it be
[1:35:10] that god misjudged that
[1:35:15] that there would be a mistake made or or
[1:35:17] maybe he would get off at the end or
[1:35:20] or he would go contrary to
[1:35:22] denominational thinking
[1:35:24] and all of a sudden god would have to
[1:35:26] say i changed my mind
[1:35:29] this man can't be my forerunner
[1:35:33] amen but but let me tell you tonight
[1:35:36] there is no mistake in the word
[1:35:42] god has sent a forerunner to prepare
[1:35:45] hearts for the coming of the lord
[1:35:47] and it must prepare your heart
[1:35:52] you must be one that opens your heart to
[1:35:55] it
[1:35:56] and say god prepare me we ought to be a
[1:35:59] church tonight to say
[1:36:01] god prepare this church as a church
[1:36:05] they may prepare this preacher this man
[1:36:08] of god
[1:36:09] for the coming of the lord
[1:36:12] hallelujah you see gordon lindsey and
[1:36:16] jack moore who witnessed it
[1:36:18] and were scribes of that day they would
[1:36:20] scream bible days are here again
[1:36:25] they saw it then i want to know has god
[1:36:28] changed any
[1:36:30] then bible days are still here
[1:36:33] we are in a living in a time of
[1:36:36] fulfillment of scripture
[1:36:38] and that makes bible days here again
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:43] what an opportunity you have tonight
[1:36:46] and why why why you could just wander
[1:36:50] your life away
[1:36:51] in a baptist tomb or methodist tomb or
[1:36:54] catholic tomb but god has given you a
[1:36:57] great opportunity
[1:36:59] amen for god to reveal himself to you
[1:37:02] for him to come where you were walking
[1:37:05] in the wrong direction
[1:37:06] where you were lost out in sin or you
[1:37:09] were steeped in the traditions of man
[1:37:12] and this god would let you alone
[1:37:15] this god went looking for you and said i
[1:37:18] gotta get them to a pentecost
[1:37:20] i've got to get them to an upper room
[1:37:23] i've got to get them to a place
[1:37:25] where they are filled with my spirit
[1:37:27] because if
[1:37:28] i can get them filled with the holy
[1:37:30] ghost they will believe
[1:37:42] i tell you why the reason of so much
[1:37:45] faithlessness in this day and hour is
[1:37:47] because
[1:37:48] people are lacking a new birth
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:53] the holy ghost will cause you to believe
[1:37:56] the word of god and
[1:37:58] say amen amen and agree to every word of
[1:38:02] god
[1:38:03] so that it can live out of your life
[1:38:09] they would say of william branham said
[1:38:11] the story of william branham is so out
[1:38:13] of this world
[1:38:14] and beyond the ordinary
[1:38:18] i'm i'm quoting from a man sent from god
[1:38:21] amen something that was wrote now 70
[1:38:24] something years ago
[1:38:25] 70 72 or three years ago
[1:38:28] and that ought to be the testimony
[1:38:30] tonight the story of your life
[1:38:34] that it's so out of this world and
[1:38:37] beyond the ordinary
[1:38:40] come on god didn't call you to be an
[1:38:43] ordinary christian he
[1:38:47] called you to be a real born-again
[1:38:50] blood wasp a man
[1:38:53] son or daughter the living god to reveal
[1:38:56] himself in
[1:38:58] you and make something out of you than
[1:39:01] an
[1:39:02] ordinary christian
[1:39:05] [Applause]
[1:39:11] the life of william branham is so out of
[1:39:13] this world beyond the ordinary
[1:39:15] that where they're not available a host
[1:39:19] of infallible proofs which document and
[1:39:23] attest
[1:39:23] is authenticity one might be
[1:39:27] well excused for considering it
[1:39:29] far-fetched
[1:39:31] and incredible
[1:39:34] this is what they said this was 70 years
[1:39:38] ago
[1:39:40] come on amen but the facts are so
[1:39:44] generally known and of such a nature
[1:39:46] that they can be so easily verified
[1:39:49] by any sincere investigator
[1:39:54] that they must stand as a witness god's
[1:39:57] witness to his willingness
[1:39:58] and purpose to reveal himself again to
[1:40:02] men
[1:40:02] as he once did in the days of the
[1:40:05] prophets and apostles
[1:40:07] the story of this prophet's life for
[1:40:09] heals a prophet
[1:40:11] though we infrequently use the term
[1:40:14] indeed
[1:40:15] witnesses to the fact that bible days
[1:40:18] are here again
[1:40:23] it would be the full gospel
[1:40:25] businessman's voice
[1:40:27] in in february 1961 issue
[1:40:30] that said in bible days there were men
[1:40:33] of god
[1:40:33] who were prophets and seers but in all
[1:40:36] the sacred records
[1:40:37] none of these had a greater ministry
[1:40:40] than that of william branham
[1:40:42] a prophet and a seer of god whose
[1:40:44] photograph appears on the front cover
[1:40:47] of this issue of of the full gospel
[1:40:50] businessmen's voice branham has been
[1:40:53] used by god
[1:40:55] in the name of jesus to raise the dead
[1:41:01] hallelujah what was it god has done some
[1:41:04] extreme things
[1:41:06] some incredible things some unbelievable
[1:41:09] things
[1:41:11] unbelievable to most hearts but somehow
[1:41:15] there were some people here tonight that
[1:41:18] can believe it
[1:41:20] amen it has turned you to faith to
[1:41:23] believe in the god
[1:41:24] that did extreme things 2 000 years ago
[1:41:29] is here in this generation doing extreme
[1:41:33] things again to stir your heart back to
[1:41:37] faith and truth again
[1:41:41] amen jack moore would write this account
[1:41:44] and i know i knew jack moore is a boy
[1:41:47] been in his services sat in his church
[1:41:51] i was daring some of brother branham's
[1:41:53] meetings there
[1:41:54] but jack moore wrote to his account as
[1:41:57] he would scream out again
[1:41:59] bible days are here again and he would
[1:42:02] report
[1:42:03] of the first time william branham came
[1:42:07] to his church and he said surprise
[1:42:10] and bewilderment were among our mixed
[1:42:13] emotions
[1:42:15] that first sunday evening of brother
[1:42:16] branham's visit to us
[1:42:18] when we arrived early at our large frame
[1:42:21] tabernacle
[1:42:22] and found the bible the building so
[1:42:25] congested that we could hardly get in
[1:42:28] this had never happened before on the
[1:42:31] first
[1:42:32] night of any meeting but
[1:42:35] this was a branham meeting a steady
[1:42:38] stream of traffic had
[1:42:40] wound its way through arkansas hills and
[1:42:43] louisiana valleys that day
[1:42:45] reverently tracing the path of this 20th
[1:42:48] century prophet
[1:42:49] whose prayers would cause diseases to be
[1:42:53] accursed
[1:42:54] broken homes to be reunited
[1:42:57] drunken fathers to repent
[1:43:00] prodigal sons to return feuding churches
[1:43:04] to stack
[1:43:05] arms and make peace and lukewarm
[1:43:08] christians
[1:43:09] to be rekindled by the fire of their
[1:43:12] first love
[1:43:14] that's what the message did back then
[1:43:16] and that's
[1:43:17] what the message will do tonight
[1:43:29] hallelujah amen jack morris said
[1:43:33] it was bible days he said it was as if
[1:43:37] jesus of nazareth had passed our way
[1:43:41] amen and he said you know it's just like
[1:43:44] he said
[1:43:44] and we can almost go back and just close
[1:43:47] our eyes
[1:43:48] and say we're there again we're there
[1:43:51] again we're back
[1:43:52] on the dusty trails of galilee
[1:43:56] and faithful devotion to a lowly
[1:43:58] carpenter
[1:43:59] who claimed to be the messiah of israel
[1:44:02] and he said in our visionary
[1:44:04] procession we passed by the place of the
[1:44:06] tombs
[1:44:07] where from which erupted a naked
[1:44:10] demoniac screaming and hissing an
[1:44:12] objection
[1:44:13] to the presence of christ but then sat
[1:44:16] at his feet
[1:44:17] a moment later and clothed in his right
[1:44:20] mind
[1:44:22] amen we were among the joshua and mob
[1:44:25] around jesus when he asked the abrupt
[1:44:28] question
[1:44:28] who touched me and saw a trembling
[1:44:30] little hand
[1:44:32] of a woman who cast herself at his feet
[1:44:34] and declare
[1:44:35] before all the people for what cause she
[1:44:38] had pulled at the
[1:44:39] border of his robe and how she had been
[1:44:41] healed immediately
[1:44:43] and then we follow on to jairus's house
[1:44:45] and
[1:44:46] and juris's house and saw the raisin of
[1:44:49] his daughter
[1:44:50] we heard the plain words of a deaf and
[1:44:52] dumb child
[1:44:53] after his tongue was loosed by the
[1:44:56] master's touch
[1:44:57] and we laughed to see a lame man
[1:45:00] leap for joy we clambered for a seaside
[1:45:03] seat with five thousand other men who
[1:45:06] had forsaken the anvil
[1:45:08] and the hammer and closed the doors of
[1:45:10] their shops to spend the day
[1:45:12] hours and wrapped attention listening to
[1:45:15] the wonderful teachers
[1:45:17] of the divine philosopher we wept with
[1:45:19] the women as we gazed on his beautiful
[1:45:22] face
[1:45:22] and recognized the sorrow and grief
[1:45:25] there that spoke of a broken heart
[1:45:26] and felt that melting warming sensation
[1:45:30] from one glance of his kind eyes could
[1:45:32] bring
[1:45:33] through the soul yes bible days were
[1:45:36] here again
[1:45:38] and here was a man that practiced
[1:45:41] what we preached
[1:45:44] amen may it be said tonight
[1:45:48] that we are a church
[1:45:51] that we don't just preach the holy ghost
[1:45:55] but we are a practicing church
[1:45:58] a man that can have an up to
[1:46:01] experience hallelujah with the same
[1:46:05] pillar of fire
[1:46:06] that smoked fall down on the road to
[1:46:09] damascus
[1:46:10] happened happens our young people happen
[1:46:12] for our old people
[1:46:14] happen to a church and bring a church
[1:46:16] back to life again
[1:46:18] with the power of the holy ghost
[1:46:20] [Applause]
[1:46:24] hallelujah we don't just preach of a
[1:46:27] glorious salvation
[1:46:28] with the fullness of the holy ghost we
[1:46:31] got to practice that
[1:46:33] we don't just preach the promise of
[1:46:35] divine healing saying
[1:46:36] god can
[1:46:40] we got churches and marching around the
[1:46:43] country saying
[1:46:44] god can if god
[1:46:47] will god can but it's more than that we
[1:46:51] practice that we not only know that
[1:46:54] god can but we know that god
[1:47:06] will
[1:47:10] hallelujah a people that know
[1:47:14] their god not what he was
[1:47:18] not what he will be but who he is
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:26] you see what it was they could see the
[1:47:28] days of jesus
[1:47:29] all over again
[1:47:32] amen it would go on to say it has been
[1:47:36] well said
[1:47:37] that unique in brother branagh's
[1:47:39] ministry is amazing gift that enables
[1:47:41] him to detect and discern the diseases
[1:47:43] that people have
[1:47:45] this manifestation is
[1:47:48] 100 percent perfect
[1:47:57] this is what they said
[1:48:01] amen oh i know we got scoffers in this
[1:48:03] day
[1:48:05] and they wasn't there
[1:48:09] but these were men that were there
[1:48:14] but you see there has to be scoffers
[1:48:16] arising the last day
[1:48:18] because this is a part that's a part of
[1:48:20] the rapture
[1:48:22] do you know that peter said in the last
[1:48:24] days
[1:48:25] that scoffers shall arise
[1:48:29] saying where is the sign of his coming
[1:48:32] amen in other words what is this all
[1:48:35] about
[1:48:36] he was going to send a prophet a
[1:48:38] forerunner
[1:48:39] where is the sign of his coming
[1:48:43] because now since the prophet has fallen
[1:48:44] asleep everything remains as it was from
[1:48:46] the beginning
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:50] are you with me now amen but we're to
[1:48:52] have scoffers
[1:48:55] in the last days and some people's got
[1:48:58] to fulfill that
[1:49:00] i'm thankful that ain't my part
[1:49:02] [Applause]
[1:49:04] amen hallelujah but you see the
[1:49:08] pentecostals in that day had to say
[1:49:10] it was 100 percent perfect
[1:49:15] he said it is a continuous and
[1:49:18] astonishing thing
[1:49:20] for brother branham is by the spirit of
[1:49:23] god is able to perceive
[1:49:25] in seconds without error
[1:49:30] what sometimes only weeks of observation
[1:49:33] in a clinic
[1:49:34] is able to duplicate this
[1:49:37] is a mighty sign proving that
[1:49:40] god is visiting his people
[1:49:45] a still and greater and more remarkable
[1:49:47] than uh
[1:49:48] and more recent manifestation of brother
[1:49:50] branham's ministry is a gift
[1:49:52] his gift of discernment word of
[1:49:53] knowledge that enables him when he is
[1:49:56] under the anointing to instantly tell
[1:49:57] the people the secrets of their heart
[1:49:59] sometimes there are sins which people
[1:50:02] have hidden away
[1:50:04] and are unconfessed which
[1:50:07] hinder them from receiving their healing
[1:50:11] i know that to be a fact
[1:50:15] i happen to be there the night when when
[1:50:17] a when a
[1:50:18] man who called himself mr teenage
[1:50:22] america
[1:50:24] claim to fame and supernatural powers
[1:50:28] was being able to take his freeport
[1:50:30] phone book and tear it in half
[1:50:32] and it was that thick oh now that was
[1:50:36] his claim
[1:50:38] mr teenage america this is my strength
[1:50:44] but a little prophet walked by him and
[1:50:47] said you sir
[1:50:48] last night you were out with oh god
[1:50:51] forgive me
[1:50:53] okay you've repented all right we won't
[1:50:56] say no more
[1:51:01] amen amen this amazing discernment
[1:51:06] once manifested in the ministries of
[1:51:08] christ
[1:51:09] and elisha is profound unique and
[1:51:11] glorious
[1:51:12] its exercise brings a solemn spirit over
[1:51:15] the meeting
[1:51:16] and indeed transports the beholder back
[1:51:20] to the miraculous bible days
[1:51:24] yeah bible days are here again
[1:51:27] they testified it back then i'm shouting
[1:51:30] it tonight
[1:51:32] amen bible days are here again not only
[1:51:35] with
[1:51:35] bible signs and bible miracles but a
[1:51:38] message
[1:51:40] bible doctrine is here again to manifest
[1:51:44] and bring forth sons of daughters of god
[1:51:47] back to the faith that was once
[1:51:49] delivered to the saints
[1:51:52] amen but god wanted you to know
[1:51:55] more than his doctrine
[1:51:58] god wants you to know his life let me
[1:52:01] tell you tonight bible life is here
[1:52:04] with the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:52:07] where you don't have just a little
[1:52:08] part a little dip of the spirit
[1:52:14] that would justify your little greater
[1:52:16] dip that would sanctify you another
[1:52:18] little depth in your speaking tongue
[1:52:20] but for deity to come and tabernacle
[1:52:24] your flesh
[1:52:27] to refill you to call you as a son
[1:52:33] hallelujah a born son a full son
[1:52:37] an adopted son somebody that knows their
[1:52:42] god
[1:52:44] who can do exploits
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:49] hallelujah amen you know i think it's
[1:52:53] mockery today to say well i'm leaving
[1:52:55] the message to get back to the bible or
[1:52:57] get back to jesus
[1:52:58] that's the biggest mockery i've ever
[1:53:00] heard in my life
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:04] amen you know the jesus denominations
[1:53:07] portray
[1:53:08] as jesus happens to just be one of the
[1:53:11] three people in the trinity of gods
[1:53:14] is it jesus that don't care about what
[1:53:16] kind of sin you live in
[1:53:20] amen but he'll he'll save you and then
[1:53:22] let you live on in your sins
[1:53:24] it's a jesus that cares not about his
[1:53:26] word
[1:53:28] who despises bible holiness
[1:53:31] and accounts and discounts it only is
[1:53:33] men's opinion
[1:53:36] amen it is the opinion of the eternal
[1:53:40] god
[1:53:41] amen who said and he said this
[1:53:46] you have heard it said of all time
[1:53:49] thou shalt not commit adultery but i say
[1:53:52] unto you here's the eternal god speaking
[1:53:55] the eternal word saying
[1:53:57] that whosoever looketh upon a woman to
[1:54:00] lust after in his heart hath committed
[1:54:03] adultery with her already
[1:54:05] in his heart amen
[1:54:08] adultery with her signifying it's not
[1:54:12] just a man's fault
[1:54:14] well this is a man's fault you know he's
[1:54:16] got a dirty mind he looked he lusted so
[1:54:19] he committed adultery no adultery is an
[1:54:22] act between two willing people
[1:54:25] and this shows she is a participant to
[1:54:27] an act
[1:54:29] she was willing she stripped herself
[1:54:32] she wore seductive clothes inviting a
[1:54:35] man to
[1:54:36] commit adultery with her in his heart
[1:54:39] amen a lady who is properly dressed is
[1:54:42] not a party to an adulterous act
[1:54:45] but when she wears tight and seductive
[1:54:48] clothes
[1:54:52] amen you know i we we ought to be down
[1:54:54] the road where i
[1:54:55] wouldn't have to preach holiness reason
[1:54:57] i'm having to preach holiness
[1:54:59] because we still got unconverted people
[1:55:04] and we're having to show them there's a
[1:55:06] sin problem
[1:55:08] in your life and that's why you're
[1:55:10] living
[1:55:11] unholy that's why your bowels
[1:55:14] look like you're melted and poured into
[1:55:17] it that's why your clothes are
[1:55:19] see-through
[1:55:20] that's why your dresses are above your
[1:55:22] knees that's why
[1:55:24] all of these other sinful things and
[1:55:26] seductive ways are going on

[1:55:35] a
[1:55:35] bible holiness that'll teach you some
[1:55:38] modesty

[1:55:42] preaching a while ago but i'm preaching
[1:55:44] right now
[1:55:46] amen hallelujah

[1:56:42] amen and if your jesus says you will
[1:56:44] make it to heaven cross-dressing
[1:56:48] wearing man's apparel when his
[1:56:51] unchanging word says
[1:56:53] is an abomination to god for a woman to
[1:56:56] put on a garment that pertains to a man
[1:56:59] and yet you think you're going to go to
[1:57:01] heaven from that in god's face
[1:57:04] that which he hates amen it ain't going
[1:57:07] to happen let me read to you what god
[1:57:10] what what god says about heaven that
[1:57:13] people
[1:57:13] think they're going to revelation 21 27
[1:57:17] of that city
[1:57:18] and there shall be no wise enter in it
[1:57:21] anything that us neither whatsoever
[1:57:25] worketh abomination or maketh a lie

[1:58:06] now not that is not the opinion of our
[1:58:09] church well that's the problem

[1:58:13] the opinion of christ in the bible
[1:58:16] it's time you want to go back to the
[1:58:18] bible well then go back to the bible
[1:58:21] go back to the jesus of the bible who
[1:58:23] called sin
[1:58:24] sin and right right and wrong wrong
[1:58:28] who preached a hole in us that without
[1:58:31] holiness
[1:58:31] no man shall see the lord
[1:58:37] you've got men wanting to dial
[1:58:39] themselves up and wear some
[1:58:41] specified shorts and necklaces and
[1:58:44] bracelets
[1:58:45] i mean you're not to wear anything that
[1:58:47] pertains to a woman
[1:58:49] and to do so is an abomination
[1:58:52] it's something that god hates and
[1:58:55] detests
[1:58:56] god said it ain't welcome in my city
[1:58:59] well if it ain't welcome in his city
[1:59:02] and i can't wear it there i ain't going
[1:59:04] to wear it here
[1:59:05] because it wouldn't welcome his presence
[1:59:08] now
[1:59:09] and he would reject me then
[1:59:18] amen that jesus the world is offering
[1:59:21] said there's many ways to come to god
[1:59:23] that offers tolerance and acceptance of
[1:59:26] any behavior
[1:59:27] in almost any sin
[1:59:32] amen it's a jesus said just try to be
[1:59:34] good
[1:59:36] you know and spread a little goodness in
[1:59:38] the world but demands no change of
[1:59:40] behavior
[1:59:43] amen no change of nature you got people
[1:59:46] sitting on the pews who have never
[1:59:48] received the bible jesus
[1:59:50] and that's why they're into pornography
[1:59:55] that's why they're they're into the
[1:59:57] things of sin
[1:59:58] and unbelief that's why they're they're
[2:00:00] struck and they're addicted to this
[2:00:02] gaming out here
[2:00:04] [Applause]
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:06] amen you're to have an addiction and
[2:00:08] that addictions to the word of god amen
[2:00:12] it's a jesus who offers a catholic
[2:00:15] theology of the trinity of gods
[2:00:18] with jesus only being one of the members
[2:00:21] of the godhead
[2:00:23] we got 3.5 billion people in the world
[2:00:28] called christians today there's more
[2:00:30] than that in the world but
[2:00:31] that's how many there are christian 3.5
[2:00:34] billion christians so-called in the
[2:00:37] world
[2:00:38] and most every one of them are following
[2:00:40] a catholic theology
[2:00:42] of a trinity of gods
[2:00:45] with jesus only being one of the members
[2:00:48] of the godhead
[2:00:50] but bible doctrine does not say that
[2:00:53] jesus is in the godhead but that the
[2:00:56] fullness of the godhead dwelt in
[2:01:00] jesus hallelujah
[2:01:04] bible doctrine teaches there's one lord
[2:01:07] one faith one baptism amen
[2:01:10] that is it but you see church energy it
[2:01:13] will offer you anything the world is
[2:01:15] offering
[2:01:16] the mind out the mind the altering wine
[2:01:20] of its adultery and offering you a drink
[2:01:23] [Applause]
[2:01:25] they tell you just drink of it and
[2:01:26] you'll you'll lose your s
[2:01:28] you know when you drink it you'll lose
[2:01:30] your senses
[2:01:31] now wait a minute i just read you in the
[2:01:33] bible that you were to take this word
[2:01:35] and eat it
[2:01:37] they are offering you a cup and saying
[2:01:39] drink it
[2:01:42] amen just drink it you'll lose your
[2:01:45] senses
[2:01:46] you'll lose your vision you'll have an
[2:01:49] ecstasy that it's all good it's all fine
[2:01:53] and now then your vision will blur
[2:01:56] and makes one god into three different
[2:02:02] people
[2:02:04] i know of people around the message that
[2:02:06] drank some of that
[2:02:07] and they saw two of them
[2:02:10] there's two lords for them
[2:02:14] look like they you know look like we
[2:02:15] would got established on the rock
[2:02:18] the revelation of who jesus is
[2:02:22] amen but instead of that we're taking a
[2:02:24] philosopher somewhere
[2:02:25] i tell you the problem they need a new
[2:02:27] birth
[2:02:28] and when you get a new birth your faith
[2:02:30] will be there on that anchor
[2:02:32] of knowing who jesus is and nobody will
[2:02:35] ever
[2:02:36] sell you a two lord or a three god
[2:02:38] doctrine anymore
[2:02:46] hallelujah amen the church by and large
[2:02:49] is called a
[2:02:51] because he left the bible jesus that she
[2:02:53] was married to
[2:02:54] and taken in the seeds of theologians
[2:02:57] and that's what makes her and so
[2:03:00] deny his name in salvation when the
[2:03:02] bible says
[2:03:03] there's only one name given under heaven
[2:03:07] whereby men must be saved
[2:03:10] it's not an option
[2:03:13] there is one name given under heaven
[2:03:20] hallelujah glory to god
[2:03:25] hallelujah but you see in the last day
[2:03:27] in laodicea
[2:03:28] he's put out of the church he's unwanted
[2:03:30] he's unloved
[2:03:32] and he's undesired hallelujah
[2:03:36] amen for those of you are interested my
[2:03:38] timer just went off
[2:03:42] hallelujah i set that for you so you
[2:03:46] would know
[2:03:47] that i was conscious of your time
[2:03:51] amen but you see the bible said the
[2:03:54] world will be under a deception
[2:03:57] and then paul called it a great falling
[2:03:59] away
[2:04:00] say well doctrine isn't really important
[2:04:02] just as long as we got love
[2:04:04] well ii john 1 and 9 said whosoever tres
[2:04:08] tres transgression transgresses and
[2:04:11] abideth not in the doctrine of christ
[2:04:13] hath not god

[2:04:34] a little bit uncomfortable
[2:04:38] amen i do hope it does make you a little
[2:04:40] uncomfortable
[2:04:42] i hope it causes a faith to start stern
[2:04:45] on the inside of you
[2:04:46] and you decide you decide i'm going to
[2:04:49] serve god
[2:04:50] with a passion with the drive to know
[2:04:53] his word
[2:04:54] and have a love a love for truth
[2:04:59] because everybody that don't have a love
[2:05:01] for truth will be damned

[2:17:25] was taken to the school of the blind the
[2:17:28] deaf and the dumb
[2:17:30] and the and there in that one visitation
[2:17:34] 152 deaf and dumb
[2:17:37] people received their ears and began to
[2:17:40] talk
[2:17:44] what was god not not just 152
[2:17:48] if god could give the ears to 152
[2:17:53] deaf and dumb children
[2:17:57] what can god do with your ears tonight
[2:18:01] to cause you to stop hearing and
[2:18:04] believing the word
