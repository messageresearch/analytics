before they had gone up and if it was going to go up a little bit more I was well they wanted for me to start treatments and they're not nice it's a form of chemo that they give you give it into your hips and it's just something it hurts you know it takes all your hormones out of your body so you have I know a lot of people have hot flashes will not have them about two or three times an hour and uh so I went back and I and I was I was really was hurting Sunday I've been hurting for a long time you know and just hurt I hurt and uh I woke up Monday morning with no pain so so you know what up

the cartridge out well they had a cartridge great big thing and it was about that big and so what it was they had a trap door and a tank and it would drop down on the ground well they had a uranium in them and so what do these guys do they got a hold of them they would pick them up and use them as souvenirs and they didn't know it was it was very dangerous uranium it was just it was bad and so all of them had got some reason of dying because they had I know one boy he was in Ohio you know when you got 21 of these young men they're like your children so I have followed them all through these years and most of them I'd say about 70 percent of them uh have bodies of 70 and 80 year old men they are have so many diseases that they've they've got uh and one boy's 52 years old and he stayed 27 years in the military and he is just completely his body is completely gone you know he he can't sweat he can't stand up he's got to take it it's just so many things that's wrong with him they can't

[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] here today [Music] [Applause] foreign you'll have to wait to eat those donuts still afterwards or thank you thank you for allowing us to uh share this life together and uh the reason we know how to give is because our Lord Jesus Christ showed us the power of giving and I was thinking today before we come to church and begin to think about about the scripture that said to to receive a prophet is to receive a prophet's reward mother Branham said that he said what that reward is is to receive him as a friend to be the friend of a prophet and you remember when brother Branham was there and he's that that black or the black mom was chasing him he's going after his friend and all of a sudden he he stopped him and he started coming back to him I'm glad that there was a prophet that stood up for us that stood up for us and to think that we we receive this Prophet this prophet's message and to to be a friend of a prophet that that a prophet stood there and called and we recognized it was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that broke the power of that mamba you know we we watched it in our Lord Jesus Christ we've watched it in brother Branham the the sacrifice of given we've watched it in our pastor brother Ron and to to me we're just one of the most blessed people that there is upon the face of the Earth to be standing and living in this hour and to have a pastor like brother Ron I tell you I the Lord sure has been good to us and those are His blessings amen amen thank you thank you sister Anna Sister Barbara sister Carly for for all the things that you've done these little children they have our hearts and and my goodness they mean the world to us and I tell you what I've been you're right brother Donnie that choir so we we're going to be working on some Christmas things and and so that may be coming back in order so so you just be praying for us and we've got so many young people we just don't know how to how to get them all on this stage but the Lord if the Lord Wills we'll we'll have them here or there so uh y'all be praying with us on that but we want to just just thank you for all all the prayers that have went up for us and the meetings this past weekend my goodness the Lord certainly blessed us in a very Supernatural way and uh brother Ron I know we'll be making some statements about that but just to before we change here the order I just want to remind you that tomorrow is a fall Fellowship day and it's a day of Fellowship it's a day that we remember one another and you know take time to sit down and spend time with ones that you don't typically do Fellowship around the message of the hour Fellowship around their testimonies and we're going to be starting tomorrow around at one o'clock sharp and at that at one o'clock I'll begin to give orders of events but as soon as those events those orders are given we're going to eat promptly and you brothers and sisters if y'all want to bring your your music your instruments please do so we'll have a keyboard there for you sister Cassie the sisters have some games that are prepared as well but also we want to brother Donnie started it off tonight but this is something that's been on our heart for our youth group but we hasn't we haven't been able to do it because of because of different things and but we've been wanting to have a testimony service and so tomorrow we're going to open open that up for if you have a testimony don't share your whole life but if you've got something that that the Lord has done for you that feel like it would be a blessing to somebody else maybe a short three four minute clip or a testimony there and I know it would be a real blessing to us and my goodness to hear the report of her brother Donnie we received that we received that Monday morning as we were just sitting around us brothers and getting ready to leave and we received that report that that doctors doctor said it's non-detectable and yeah I'll tell you what when you receive a report like that it's in line with his report amen the effectual prayer the fervent prayer of a righteous one availeth much and and uh tonight I want to I want to sing a song that that was seen last weekend at brother Tim's October meetings there and the Lord certainly blessed us in a very Supernatural way we've seen so many Supernatural things happen and just Just Amazing Just an amazing thing to watch brother Ron be able to roll back the time as it were and to preach like a 25 30 year old man and just stand there and I tell you it blessed my heart I know that you're a faithful uh streamers and you you're I'm sure you've already caught up on those things but I know where to stir your heart it'll stir your faith and it'll give you a kick in the pants if you're down in the dumps and uh this man right here has been used by almighty God to beat down every excuse that the enemy would try to throw in make us want to miss church but we watch this man weekend after weekend sick whether he's sick or not he's coming to this pulpit and he and he's just a faithful faithful man if you haven't listened to Sunday morning brother Wayne Lawson on the change the mystery of our change go back and listen to it about 15 or 20 times it's one of the most dynamic messages I've ever heard in my life and and just uh just a powerful powerful message I believe that the season of change is upon us as the body of Jesus Christ and and uh last weekend brother Michael had sang a song brother Michael Dexter had sang the song and uh I believe it was the first time them singing it there and uh my the presence of the Lord just dropped into the room and and he he's singing I believe two times there and every single time the Lord just dropped into the room and he asked me later he said are you going to sing that song I said man I said after the presence of the Lord fell like that I almost feel commissioned that we need to do so and you ever been into a room where you've been just having a maybe like what we'll have tomorrow have a little fellowship or you've been into a place where you've been invited in and you've been sitting around the table or you've been sitting around and just enjoying one another's fellowship and you just don't want time to end that's what this house is it comes every weekend every single time that we're here it comes in touch to such a place that you know that it's the presence of the Lord and you just want to stay in his presence you don't want to leave his presence you don't want to go back to the rest of the world the way things are but you just want more of him and that's what this song is and I trust her to be a blessing to you we've never we've not practiced it this week because of the business of the week but the musicians have been putting some things together and hopefully they can carry us but just just begin to enter into worship as brother Ron prepares to come this evening let's invite the Lord Jesus to come by our way now you've appreciated us as pastors but let's appreciate him with our worship tonight do you love him won't you stand with us maybe you can play some of that sister Cassie you have the words right [Music] Hallelujah just inviting to come by your way [Music] he said Lord speak to me tonight I got needs in my body and he's here to meet him [Music] to be in the presence of the Lord [Music] and not know what time it is [Music] restored well because we stayed here [Music] presence of the Lord [Music] couldn't even make a sound Hallelujah

my [Music] [Applause] God you're my prince [Music] foreign [Music] makes such a wonderful difference when he comes by our hearts would just be so overcharged the king of glory would come to our house maybe to spend an afternoon [Music] I wouldn't be uncomfortable with that I wouldn't have to hide anything he sees it all because he come to this house a long time ago that's what we felt here this afternoon [Music] don't leave I don't want you to go just stay because he can do more than just in a few moments [Music] and doctors psychologists can do in an entire lifetime he can walk into a cemetery [Music] where a man has got chains and naked and love him enough to change his life and he went there with a mission he can go to a place where they won't wash his feet because he knows there's going to be somebody there she won't be accepted by the rest of the churches but he'll accept her and after today she'll never carry those sins and she'll never feel that common denomination ever again [Music] Hallelujah that's what's brought us together all of us have a book we have a story but God that's rich in Mercy we wasn't looking for God but God came looking for us [Music] and he didn't stop when you turned and even walked away [Music] he knew there'd come a season where you would turn and it then he would call you like he did to the woman at his grave Mary [Music] a woman with the worst sins of all Humanity he would have her to be at his grave [Music] just stay Lord I don't want you to go Hallelujah isn't he good to us is any good to us amen thank you thank you so much for that amen good to be home good to see each and every one of you new friends Among Us amen God bless you for being here amen Oliver our new ones that are here amen we're so glad to have brother Chris Morrison Sister Mary now with us and until the Rapture and so we're he asked me the other day said would you would you take the responsibility to be my pastor and I said yep but I'm going to pray about Sister Mary so we're honored to have you guys with us and amen tomorrow is going to be a special day for those that haven't been among us tomorrow is a special day to where we can Fellowship we actually designed it like that to where we don't it's no stress on us and and it's not a stress for me to have any Council sessions with none of you I can't fix you no way but I know Jesus can and so so you know so I I just trust that the Lord would give me strength to be able to to do that tomorrow and you just pray for us that God will give us that strength and sometimes it's in the fellowship that I get a little bit wore out and if you see my family take take me home for a little bit you don't get offended at them they're just trying to protect me or take care of me and so Amen brother Joe is going to be with us next next week you've already announced that okay amen brother Joe Adams is going to be with us from brother Tim pruittz he's going to be with us and so we are going to take a little hunting trip and so we're going to be gone so you remember us there amen we can you know it's just that time of year and so we're not having a family divorce we're just going to go on a little hunting trip and so and so if you would just remember us brother Joe was an incredible preacher I know you'll be blessed by him and amen we're missing brother William and sister Gabrielle and and uh and we just love them with all of our heart we all understand those things and and they're on that baby watching that baby will come exactly right on time and so amen so we're just praying for them that that it God would just help them with that amen if you would turn with me to Revelations chapter 21 and verse 1. I've got a few things that I want to share with you before we go into the word this afternoon but I want to read the scripture while we are while we are here I want to speak tonight on Back to Eden Back to Eden one I won't get done but I'll get it started as the Lord would give us strength we find this is the closing of the scriptures and John is coming to the end to where the fullness of all things would be and this is our time and John is writing about you writing about what is laying ahead of you listen we've got good news the world is falling apart they're headed into a tribulation period but we've got some really good news here and so amen and so I just want to just want to share a few things with you if you could just help me tonight and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for former things are passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely and he that overcometh how many of you say that's now I'm one of them shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful unbelieving abominable murderers whoremongers Sorcerers idolaters all liars shall have their part in the Lake of Fire which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death you may be seated this afternoon foreign I want to share this with you sister Connie Perry made me this amen isn't that beautiful amen she said when I go to the brother Fred said when I will come over on this site now said when I go to the hospital it'll keep me warm well all right that'll that'll do because their little old sheets won't keep you keep you warm amen when they say I'll get you a warm blanket I'll take two and so amen thank you sister Connie give her a good hand for that for most of us that have been around the message for decades and I've been around the message since I was a little boy we have been watching the bride's Revival escalate we have watched it move from cycle to cycle the opening of the word began to happen somewhere around the 80s and and the word just began to open itself up to the Bride of Jesus Christ and it became an unfolding revelation we realized that we were the people of the open book citizens of another kingdom we realized that this was more than the message of a man of William Branham this was not going to be a denomination we realized that it wasn't going to return us to Azusa Street the Revival of Pentecost of of the 1900s but it's returning us back to Acts 2. it's returned us back to where God is inside of man and the adoption of sons and daughters have come together we realize that we're a part of that that we've returned to Eden again and so we as we have watched these things and we see our meetings become so much more powerful we came through Seasons to where that personalities of men would rise up and and people would follow personalities who's going to be the next great one well let me just say there's none greater than Jesus Christ we're not wanting to build a kingdom we're not wanting to build a kingdom after ourselves we're wanting to build a kingdom of Jesus Christ and we're Christians we want we want him to live inside of our lives we have we have witnessed over the last months and even the last couple of years phenomenal miracles happen here we witnessed tonight brother Donnie talking about being being free of cancer and and we've witnessed that the God is just just watched over him brother Alden and I were standing in the back of in the back back there just getting ready to come out and he was talking about those 21 Men brother Alden made a statement I think he was reading my mind he said those 21 Men preserved their lives because of no doubt Donnie was there Donnie had a daddy that was praying for him Donnie would be a Christian man that would be on this stage that would play the music and and Satan couldn't take his life and no doubt the angel of the Lord was very near to watch over him and and protect him we witnessed that we witnessed that tonight as we said here sometimes when we hear phenomenal Miracles we we we go well isn't that nice or isn't that what we don't realize that was God that was God doing a work and so we're thanking for that last year we had was it last year or two years ago we had brother Timothy Pruitt here was it last year or two years two years sister Karen just before sister Karen's passing last June June August okay and so brother Timothy was preaching and brother brother Timothy as he was preaching he was he was coming down to the end of his service and sister Karen was in the hospital with her brain bleed and she had been fighting with brain bleeds and it's coming now close to the end of her to her passing to her homegoing brother Timothy has an iPad just like I have here and he's out in front of the stage and he's he's talking about God's doing something and so as he's beginning to speak about it we were sitting there and I was watching his iPad go from one app to another app how many has an iPad or an iPhone you realize that that don't do that by itself and so I told I told the guys here I said the angel of the Lord is standing at the pulpit hey and he's went from one app to another app and he's going to a certain place in the message to play and brother Timothy didn't know how it was happening and he didn't even grasp a hold of what was really going on but he began to talk about the man that that that that that wrote this song down from his glory and and they begin to talk about that song and as brother Timothy would go home it would be it would be sister Karen's one of her last last actions in her body which she would sing the song down from his glory we have witnessed him come to us in this generation we have witnessed God on the scene for us we have seen him December the 22nd of 2022 of 2020. he spoke to us that if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before we have trusted him maybe thinking that it would be maybe a a higher realm of ministry or or higher gift of that but it would be cancer would come to our body and it would be one level at another and we would discover it through through a Mennonite doctor here that's that's local and a dear friend to us all and he would tell me that it was going down a dark Road and and then at first he thought it was prostate cancer and then it was in the lung then it was in the lymph nodes and then and then after a few a couple of months we would find out it was in the brain a death sentence was give to us but God is the one that has the final report about a two weeks ago we were sitting with the doctors and they were just saying we're just blown away of what all you're doing and so as I Was preparing this message I thought you know after hearing brother Donnie's brother Donnie's words of a testimony I think I'd like to give a little testimony of this year I'm not going to go back to last year but I'm going to give a little testimony of this year we stood at your meetings at brother Sean's and spoke to about 1100 people and we spoke a sermon called nothing can stop us and the prayer line went to about two o'clock in the morning and on the way home they begin to speak in tongues and God began to pour out his glory amongst our people God just continued to Pour That Glory out over and over again it was there I think sister of Julia began to speak in tongues we had went to Easter camp with brother Tim Pruitt and that would be with brother Andrew and myself and brother Donnie would be there and one phenomenal Miracle after another happened in that meeting and on that stage we had a prayer line and it was the first prayer line that I was able to stand through the whole prayer line and brother Tim Pruitt and myself danced at the end of it and they were singing a song you don't know like I know then I brother Harold Hildebrandt would pass and I would want to go to his place but I was in a weakened condition and just could not go two weeks later we went to Brother biscal's meeting for his 50th Anniversary meeting Brother David Mayer was there brother Tim Pruitt brother Timothy Pruitt and myself held that meeting and God did some incredible and incredible things once again a prayer line would ensue once again brother Tim and I would dance on the stage it's going to be a trend at the end of the at the end of the meeting it was on Monday afternoon we were at Brother Sam Rays brother biscoll and myself and and brother Tim Pruitt was sitting on at the kitchen table and we were rehearsing so stories about the supernatural presence of God how the angel had came to us on on occasions and Howard came into our house and into our room how that we've seen visions and they come to pass how we've seen the glory of God that is Among Us things that would prophesy that would come is now happening in our churches brother bisca would we would come to the winding down of that brother biscoll said I'll tell you this he said there was a time that I sat at the table with brother brother Branham and he said we were sitting with brother bud and he said brother Branham looked over at me and he said I'll tell you brother Eddie he said that Pillar of Fire is hanging about two foot above this table right now and he said I'll tell you brother Ron and brother Tim he's hanging two feet above this table right now we went to Brother Ed hammermeister's in in in July brother Tim Pruitt

that meeting that next week on Tuesday brother Donnie Reagan would start at brother Joe Greene's meeting missions meeting brother Donnie would speak and then I would speak on Wednesday brother Donnie would speak on Thursday and then I would speak on Friday and to me it was the most phenomenal Supernatural medium that happened there in that meeting we came back here for our Labor Day and you are a witness you're a witness we're all a witness brother Timothy Pruitt brother Tim Pruitt brother Tim spoke on he spoke on Entertaining Angels Entertaining Angels and God came and amen the word two hours would go by with worship after the service was over let me just say in his presence time just stand still miracles happen situations took place many were baptized the next day tongues and interpretations of tongues happen here Among Us you can say it's for another day but it's for this day [Applause] we are people of the open book brother Donnie would come back the next day and would begin to preach about there would about unclogging pipes how we've got to get our pipes unclogged so that we can catch what's going on blowing up the beaver dams and letting the power of God flow in our midst that's what we want to happen Among Us we were at brother Tim's last week excuse me we went to Brother Kelly hildebrandts it was brother Kelly hildebrandt's largest and most powerful services that we have ever witnessed them I spoke on renewal I've never seen wave after wave quite like that ever with the audience like what we had it was the glory of God just wave after wave after wave after wave this is not a man this is not a man it's God we were at brother Tim's last week brother Andrew went with us brother Andrew spoke on Wednesday night I spoke on on Thursday night brother Wayne Lawson spoke on on on Friday night Andrew spoke on Sunday on Saturday morning I spoke on Saturday night and brother Wayne spoke on Sunday morning on Sunday morning wave after wave again we

Among Us God is Among Us no man can orchestrate these things just before our leaving going there we baptized two weeks ago 37 people [Applause] brother Donnie Reagan was supposed to be with us at the meeting last week at brother Tim's he couldn't come but God orchestrates everything when the meeting was over with brother Tim got a a letter and and brother Kalin from South Africa sent a picture with his letter and this was the picture that he sent [Applause] he said God bless you brother Tim I asked brother Tim if I could read it I didn't ask brother Kalin I felt like he was far enough away if he watches this he's not going to hit me with a dart no way God bless you brother Tim I'm sure you must be really tired after such powerful week of services may the Lord bless you for all your benefits and reward you with health and strength all I can say is evening light Tabernacle has waged War Wayne Andrew and Ron on the kingdom of hell that saw the bride realize that she is Anointed and he now he begins to take the sermon titles and themes of the sermon and begins to blend it together on the kingdom of hell and saw the bride realize that she is the anointed to accept what Eve turned down this has made her cry out let's finish this for she is an is the anointed body bride body of the Lord Jesus Christ she is now feeling the effect of the vision and as it draws Dawns on her Satan has underestimated her all of those were our texts for he cannot stop her from stepping into the mystery of change oh Hallelujah Hallelujah you hit me wonderful we had with us Belgium from Belgium brother Joshua and brother Isaiah and and and and and sister Julie that is from Brother Guido's family Joshua has now been preaching seven years and it was in a meeting as I walked by him I turned to him and said God's calling you to preach he has now preached seven years Isaiah was not a Christian in one of Guido's prayers to us was pray that my son Isaiah and his his wife that are that are that are in a broken situation pray that they become Christians in the meeting last week they were all at the altar and as Isaiah was worshiping with the hundreds of people I just began to say you're standing a Holy Ground at the same time sister Julie is standing there and she feels a hand on her shoulder and later they would come to find out what nobody ever lay in a hand on her shoulder but it was a supernatural God [Applause] now people don't believe in Visions you just put your fingers in your ears just now but us three preaching the meeting had significance we never preached a meeting before in this quite this way and so brother Wayne myself and brother Andrew are going to speak and so anyway we in in the vision before I had saw that we had black pants and white shirt and we walked into a place and and in in this place we we walked into we walked into it and we would eat a honey bun well Wayne had asked his wife to pack him a blue shirt and it was dirty so he wore a white shirt so on the way to the restaurant brother Tim tells you he says this place it's about an hour out this place has the most incredible cinnamon buns that you can eat we would see the picture on it as we walk in and we would walk to the counter that I saw in the vision and they didn't have cinnamon rolls they had cinnamon buns so I ordered 12 to make sure Hallelujah I believe we're standing on some incredible grounds don't you do we have time to preach a little bit since we're not going to have service tomorrow we're going to have Shirley with us sister Nancy's cousin yeah yeah amen I want to share a couple of quotes with you what a beautiful picture of Christ who heard from Heaven that we were lost and came and pursued the enemy all the way to hell and captured the lost soul and brought us back and restored us to everything that we had before the fall we backsliders we that were born to be sons of God that's perverted into sons of the devil and when when after the things of the world and done wrong and run into greedily like lot did selling out our birthrights and going after the things of the world Christ come down Christ come down through though Fallen God knowed in the beginning who would be saved and who would not therefore God come down and pursued the enemy notice how he says it God came down and pursued the enemy through life through death through Paradise into hell and all the way from God to Hell glory to hell he took over the powers of hell and the keys await took the keys away from the devil and rose again and restored mankind that he can be Sons and Daughters of God again that's what God did for me and you God left Glory God left glory and went to the ramparts of hell to defeat hell that it could restore us back to be sons and daughters again for those that don't know why I repeated what we've done in the last year I say take that devil foreign gives you a death sentence do something with it turn it right around on him [Applause] when they tell me nobody else is doing what you're doing I'm telling you there's a God that knows how to restore my body what hell wanted to take away from me God has restored and God gives us strength what I believe Adam walked out of we're going to walk right back into we have walked right back into I believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this is a real place for God started Us in this spiritual growth in this place I believe that heaven is a place just as real as this is where we don't go up there for eternity and just sit up there on the cloud and strum a harp and all of this and that and the other he said but we're going to a real place where we're going to to do things where we're going to live where are we going to work where we're going to enjoy where we're going to live we're going to have life real eternal life we're going to heaven a paradise just like Adam and Eve worked that live that eat that enjoined the Garden of Eden before sin ever came we're on our road back there we're not done here we're on our way back there [Applause] in the Garden of Eden before sin came in we're on road back there again the first Adam through sin taken us out the second Adam Jesus Christ through righteousness brings us back again justifies us as though we never did it in the first place Revelations chapter 5 and verse 9. if you'll notice in Revelations chapter 5. God's there man's there but there's somebody's missing the Accuser and they sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nation and it's made us unto our Gods Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth don't that make you feel good and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels and the round and their Thorn and the Beast and the elders and the number of them's Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand and thousands and thousands and thousands let's just pick up another place for us Revelation chapter 19 and verse 6. and I heard as it was a great voice of multitude a great voice of many Waters a voice of Mighty thunderance saying hallelujah the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine lineness of righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto them these are the true sayings of God amen leadership brother Branham is getting ready to preach his last sermon other than communion and now he's preached on leadership and taken a lot of different thoughts on the Holy Ghost leadership for the bride in this day and he comes down to his final prayer and I've always found that the prophet's prayer is as powerful as his sermon he said our great leader of eternal life we accept your promise tonight father I plead for this people I plead for every one of them in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I pray Christ the son of God will come into their hearts every one of them Lord and mold us and make us into new creatures in Christ Jesus Grant it Lord God we love you we want our dispositions our change to come into us that we can be your children and fill the your spirit moving in our hearts Lord tendering us bringing us to realization of this insane age that we're living in granted God when we see young women so ought to so caught up in the web of the devil young men perverted Minds children dope addicts cigarette smoking drinking immorality Satan's Eden God had taken 6 000 years according to the Bible to build in Eden and you put your son and his wife there in his broad to rule over it Adam and Eve to keep the garden and Satan come around and perverted it and he's got 6 000 years and he's built his own intellectual Eden the one we're living in through science and education and so-called intelligence and he's built it into a mass of death people don't know what's right what's wrong they don't know what's reality and what's fake they don't know what's fiction or what's fact it's that way in their news it's that way and the government's not just ours it's that way in the societies it's that way in their music it's that way in their school systems what they're trying to say here even in our state of Virginia to where parents can't take care of their children or even call their little boys boys or little girls girls our state we'd have never saw this coming 50 years ago but look where we're at today a whole lot worse than that's going on but God's going to take us back to Eden again he's got a people that's on the Earth amen come on come here amen that can live in Two Worlds at the same time that could be the keeper of our Gardens of our homes God can come and live with us I want you to just notice in the Old Testament I don't want to go too long but in the Old Testament it was it was God over man and if you remember Adam what he lost was to have the god-likeness to be able to speak to the storm and call it back or move a mountain or move trees by nature or even call The Animals by name none of them were vicious Eden was a place that no leaves ever fell to the ground but when When sin came into the garden he found his wife with a strange seed in her womb [Music] and remember what God told him the day that you eat thereof it's the day you die Adam had a choice Adam had a choice right here and I'm going to go too deep in it but Adam had a choice because he reflected where he came from he reflected the Messiah and he was an amateur God on Earth he knew God wouldn't kill him so he placed his seed on the inside of her and then God came down why did you sin who told you this Adam blamed the woman the woman blames the serpent the serpent was cast to the ground to her where he was unidentifiable the woman was cursed to where that she would have babies by natural conception and through the womb she would carry the seed and that baby that's that's what sister Gabrielle is going through contractions five minutes apart she's watching those contractions she's went to the hall to the hospital a couple of different times she don't want to miss it it is not William and her having a baby bye it's William in the same car William in the same hospital room but she's having a baby because it was part of the natural curse upon the woman but William has to be the worker he has to be the head by thorns and thistles and work and sweat of the brow by the economies you have to work but God's going to bring us back to Restoration [Applause] [Music] now think about this just I just want to just think about this Moses was standing at a Red Sea and God tells him to stretch her on his rod over that body of water it would be almost like what Adam would do when he would stretch his Rod out he would watch God opened that body of water it wasn't Moses opening it but he was taken God in his word and God was saved why are you crying to me speak there was a tribe that had already walked out into the water they was not going to walk back [Applause] and they'd already got it to their noses they were trusting God there's sometimes you've got to trust God when there's nothing else to do you've got to trust God and they walked across go ahead and let the critics say they walked across on dry reefs well let me just say this shoe the same critic has to answer that God took those dry reefs and drowned the biggest army that was in the world [Applause] Daniel because he prayed and he fellowship with God his enemy told him he couldn't pray no more and he couldn't worship no more so they signed a decree that he would have to go to the Lion's Den lines that were hungry and lines that would would destroy a man in just a few seconds the king even prayed that Daniel's God would help him to preserve but Daniel would say I'll see you in the morning Daniel walked into this dungeon it wasn't Daniel that caused those lines to lay down and not be hungry but it was an angel of the Lord God himself in the room it was that same God that would have Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to not bend their knees to the to the mighty mighty image of Daniel but they would be cast into a fiery furnace notice all of these events are natural events Lions Red Sea Elijah and Elisha Elijah when he comes to the end and he had incredible miracles in his life but when he comes this time to go home he won't go home by Death but he'll go home by a chariot as a matter of fact brother Adam said he would walk across and there would be chariots at the bushes and he would go over and pick one so there's a lot of other chariots that are waiting on me and you and he'd go over and get in that Chariot and Elisha had asked for a double portion of the blessing he had just smote that Jordan River and that Jordan opened up and Elisha came back to that Jordan and he screamed out where is the Lord God of Elijah and it opened up again Elisha would have all but one Miracle to equal the double portion and they buried no doubt had an incredible ceremony for Elisha as they buried him in the cave no doubt the critics said he come up one short don't you never underestimate our God one day there was a battle going on and a man died and his friends were carrying him they'd carried him as far as they could go and he had died and they throwed him in that cave those Dry Bones lay in there have the power of Promise of Resurrection let me just say that Resurrection power's still alive today your body may go back to the ashes and the glasses but God made you a promise on Resurrection morning I'll raise you up out of the ground that was under the blood of bulls and goats but our Messiah come he would come to the Earth he would leave the ivory palaces of Heaven take upon the form of a man he didn't come like the world was looking for he didn't come to their schools he didn't come to their thinking he come out of a a little a little nesty place Bethlehem it would be a barn setting because they wouldn't have room for him in the end Mary would be called a woman of ill refute many would say because of her testimony that it was a supernatural birth they would say that she'd had a relationship with a Roman soldier before Jesus ever arrived Satan was putting a bad name on him I'd say this to you before you ever came to Jesus now if you could just think about this just for a moment I'm not going to get done but if you could just think about this for a minute you're a predestinated seed and you know you're walking in darkness but there's something on the inside of you that you've never discovered for yourself oh there might be times of moments to words you'd you'd feel a warm presence come to you and you knew that you couldn't explain that and you knew there was a higher calling for you but in your life you've no doubt made some mistakes and had some failures and yet something kept holding you friends were getting all different kinds they would fall apart and this and that but something had a hope to your life what you see was God was making his way in your direction and if you could see it in a spiritual form there was a light that was coming to that seat and listen the devil watches for that light and he's watching for it to come so he begins to battle you and sends you in the wrong directions your free moral choice will take you away from God it wasn't you choose God God chose you it was the law of election he elected you before the foundation of the world that's Grace he knew who would come to him we talk about the marriage supper of the Lamb he knows exactly how many seats to have there in John 14 he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am going to build you a tabernacle that'll never age it'll never get gray-headed it'll never be touched by cancer sin will have no issue with it oh no pressures with it whatsoever listen this isn't a fairy land Adam fell but God has restored Eden again now it was God above them then it was God with them I don't know what it was like or what sensation they would have had when Jesus turns water to wine because that don't happen in a science lab that never seen that ever done before and then the disciples said the people are here and they're hungry do we have any food well we've got a little boy that's come skipping school that's what brother Braham said so we're just taking Betty's word he said he come and Skip in school and said he's got some Fish and Loaves that means he got he's got some fish and loves and he said well bring him here and Jesus blessed them can you imagine what he told his mom and dad that night I learned things in science and Anatomy I never thought I would this man it's kind of a bearded man Slender Man and this man blessed him and then he just sat and watched us and he would break it off and break it off and break it off and I watched him when he broke it off it multiplied again and watched him broke it off and he multiplied again I watched when the fish came out it looked like it was empty and it multiplied and they fed over five thousand that don't happen in the science class Satan didn't know what he was doing when pilate told them to take him and beat him that it would fulfill Isaiah 53. because we would need to be restored to Eden and these bodies that would have certain sales that are supposed to be killing us God would be able to say now that's far enough [Applause] that's far enough and as they beat him one whipping after another whipping even to where that his body would open up till his organs would show he was beat like no other human band but yet had the power to call Ten Thousand Angels so in his quietness he was greater than he was in his words Hallelujah somebody shout right there in his quietness he was much more powerful when he was revolved he reviled not again so he put that inside of you knowing you would need it in this layout to see you when they revile you and you can't hold yourself you just set still and your Stillness has more power [Applause] foreign on calvary's Cross he said father into thy hands I commit my spirit if Satan would have known what he was what was going on here he was losing the rights to the Garden of Eden what he had caused in the fall he was losing his rights to hold because this man would show up in his kingdom and he would come through paradise and release every one of them from Abraham all the way down all the prophets couldn't do it Moses as great as he was he lied as great as he was John the Baptist as great as he was was not as great as this man Jesus listen there's not a name greater than Jesus Christ and he would go to the paradise of the realm and open the doors of paradise and set them free [Applause] he would go down into hell and preach to the souls in hell and tell them you had Enoch you had all the prophets and you wouldn't listen to them and you wouldn't listen to me then he went to the headquarters of hell and knocked on the door of hell and Satan came and said I got you haha he said my blood's still wet on that cross I fell but I come down here to over I take it over take over the keys of death hell in the grave isn't no wonder Paul could scream oh death worship sting oh grave worship [Applause] two thousand years we had churches but God sent us a prophet in this day because the word had to be released to us to restore us back to Eden again that Mark chapter 11 would be fulfilled in our lives not that we're looking for the Revival to come but it's happening now not that we're looking for some great day for something to take place but it's happening right now what other atmosphere is taking place while Putin is doing what he's doing the angel of Destruction is holding his hands back he would have already dropped a lot of atomic bombs if he could he is screaming to fulfill his part in the scriptures he will don't you worry but it will not come one day too soon because there is a bride [Applause] oh Hallelujah now you see we're playing our part he said we can see the marriage suppers at hand he says if I never see you again remember the marriage suppers at hand the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great millennium and the taking up of the church and the destroying of the wicked and the world under the Sixth Seal to be purified by volcanic to take all the corruption the sin of the world and mold her out again and bring her bring her forth a bright New Millennium for the age that is to come notice these words you got just a couple more minutes the world seems to be in the most evil age that there ever was never an age like did women ever act like that never before has there been destruction of the and alluvian World Jesus referred to it has God lost his control or is he just permitting another Angel an agency to control the true answer to this question to my opinion there's two opposing Spirits at work in the world today at work there can't be no more than two two heads one of them is the holy spirit at work the other is the spirit of this the devil and the these last days in deception and I'm gonna base my thoughts on this for this message the two Spirits one of them is God's holy spirit the other is the devil Spirit working in deception the people of the Earth are now making their choice I've always thought that was a powerful statement the people of the Earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ he's doing it by vindicating his word a promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ so who is it among us in these meetings so I come down to this who is it Among Us in these meetings it's not other than the mighty Angel himself all over the world he's doing this we're not just alone in this he's all over the world moving getting the bride in position she's heard the message it's more than a script to her she stepped into the Fulfillment of the time but the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is supposed to see in this age the eye will see the spirit of God as it grows into a full stature of God and it is the age that we're living now the holy spirit is here vindicating I love this part vindicating the message of the Allah as we watch the other day as brother Timothy was standing here and his iPad begins to do what it did when we listened to brother Andrew preach and God just comes and then we begin to Worship the Lord and it's wave after wave after wave that's not some rock and roll [Applause] are you with me I'm thankful for music but it's way more than music it's a wave of the Holy Spirit of a people that want to worship God oh my the devil with his holy with his Unholy spirit is here calling his church by error by perversion of the word of God like he did back at the beginning so it's repeating Eden again for both spirits amen Satan going back to the Garden of Eden and taken just one word out of your Bible and all it takes is one word to curse you but God takes the word and restores it and puts you back into position again and then you become a keeper and then you fellowship with the angel of God in your home you feel that warm presence come in your home and you just know that's him that ain't the devil wanting you to pray then all of a sudden you're standing in the kitchen and you're worshiping the Lord and you're going whoo what a presence here you've you've created a home to where God wants to come and be with you can I I'll leave you with this one night I woke up and I recognized he was in the room and I just stood up it was about four it was 404 in the morning and I just stood up we heard we heard the testimony sister Julie with the hands on that hand on her shoulder I knew what she was talking about and I was standing there and I was standing facing away from the bed and if you ever had anybody kind of just turn you they just kind of turn you and it was like a father just turned me and he was standing behind me and then he began you heard us preach it now Ron I want you to see past what you see buried and he said I want you to think past what you think why did I need that when you're faced with a death sentence you can't look at this flesh when you're faced with issues of life and many of you are brother Jerry me and you stood under oak tree and he just came down then you came in a prayer line and it was told to you the angel stands at your property under a certain tree and watches over your property you've probably never seen that angel but God made it known to you that he's there and then you too wanted to get married under that tree and now God's taken that property and doing some very special things with it you tell me he's not among us amen oh do you love me so we're brother Ron it's not for our our carnal life you mind if I tell you one more story amen we were working at a customer or partner and I'm never told this here and Matthew looked over at me and said Dad what's wrong and I said I'll tell you later and he asked me he said what's wrong Dad I said I'll tell you later we go to lunch and I said I'll tell you now I had a visit with the angel of the Lord while we were working and they told me what's going on at that company and I need to talk to the owner so Andrew said well I need to go somewhere else will you go and will you go see him so I I went to see him and they were sitting on some pipe about this tall they were sitting there he was sitting with a welder and he said Ron we've lost about five hundred thousand dollars in the last month and he said we're going bankrupt by the day and I said I'll tell you something if you if you'll trust me I just got a visit about an hour ago they told me exactly what's going on in your company I don't know your books I don't know your situation but I know three people that are stealing from you and one of them is your general manager and two is your other managers and you got to get rid of them you got to get rid of them right away within them within six weeks within six weeks they were totally restored Hallelujah and that welder was there he said I'll tell you that's God if I've ever seen God that's God we don't do this to try to make money with but God sent this message for us that we can live an overcoming life [Applause] why are you with me now we can live an overcoming life that a People Like Us can go tomorrow and have a fall festival together knowing there's coming a day where we'll never separate ever again there'll never be something called time that we'll have to worry with ever again never be sick or never be weary there will be no wheelchairs there foreign no hospitals no dying I thought of this the other day and not another competitive spirit there no jealousy no jealousy what a day I will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved May by his grace when he takes may buy the hand leads me through Promised Land what a day glorious day the other day I was in brother Tim Pruitt's home during the night I begin to dream I dreamed that brother Tim and I were

this going on we've told it from this side can you imagine Hale's year in review [Music] I lost this one I lost that one I lost that battle I thought I had him with suicide I thought I had him with depression I thought let's go back through Satan's reader and review I lost Ron Spencer I lost Erica Parker I lost I lost this when I thought I had him bound to alcohol but I lost them I say he that is in you that is is greater than he that is in the world and then he took us the things that are to be you're going to be there you're going to be there you're going to walk down these Shores you're going to walk down these gold and pave ways you're going to walk down through those things I'm one of those things that are to be there because we have accepted a perfect Eden the Bible said in Isaiah
