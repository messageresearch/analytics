knees as the Lord forgot us and look to his word they could find the way and this song is about a man who didn't do it in time a king Made A Feast for a banquet invited all his men to come and play

chaotic world that we live in father the Lord we're very aware Lord that we are living in an age that is full of neurotics father but Lord I believe that there's real peace in your presence so hard and Lord that's why we sing from all of our heart Lord we want you to stay and Lord it's it's not a presence that comes and goes but Lord we we recognize father there are things in this world that can scare or push away your presence and our Prophet would tell us that it's kind of like the Holy Spirit like a dove he goes and flies on a limb and he just invite the dove of the Holy Spirit to come fly over our hearts Lord just now Lord and or do you just draw us closer to you Lord by your by Your Word it's just how you do father Lord any man can open up the pages of the Bible but when you begin to take a letter after letter Lord and begin to address Us in this sweating gown father or do we recognize that you're the one that is has made the dress father for us so so we could be a fitting to the image that you took of us before the foundation of the world Lord everything within us cries out we want to match the image father Lord we're a piece of the master and Lord Jesus we recognize that man couldn't put what they marred back into place but because of Calvary you took us and you placed us and restored us into our rightful position and Lord I pray tonight that that under the sound of my voice father that you administer to your children Lord we've gathered in your name we've come to glorify it father and we're asking Lord that you would touch your children's Heart Lord we know that you're very near and we ask God that you touch every hand that's been lifted up by the need that is upon their heart Lord we'll be careful to serve you and praise you and oh Lord I Thank you for being here for us tonight in Jesus name amen amen if you ever Bibles this evening would like to look over and two portions of scripture in the New Testament there in the book of Hebrews chapter 12. and verse 22 and then also down to Revelations Revelations chapter 1 and verse 10. Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 22. I know we got technology that we can read our Bible from but it's nothing like reading it hearing the pages of the Bible begin to open up it's just I believe those I believe the devil just just begins to fly off when he knows that his children are getting ready to read the word of God ma'am Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 22 but you are come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and the Jesus the mediator of the Covenant and to the blood of a sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn not away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heavens and this word yet once more signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire Revelations chapter 1 and verse 10 if you're not aware where that's at it's at the back of the Bible Revelations chapter 1 verse 10. and I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seeest is right in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia under Ephesus under smyrnia and pergamus thotara under Sardis under Philadelphia and under lay artisan notice and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now pay attention listen real closely and in the midst of the seven golden or seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle now you're looking at him face to face right here now watch his personages his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow in his eyes were like as a flame of fire and his feet under the fine brass as if they had burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp to its sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord I'd like to to read this this portion of a quote here and the brothers sisters have it there for you tonight and I'd like for this to be where we draw our context tonight he said now everybody can't be a preacher he said but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach he said if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that'll bring the reproach to them whose that will bring the reproach to them who reject it they say no one can put a finger on his or her life there their their sweet living they if if there was ever a man of God it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you're you'll get it all mixed up anyhow messed up and you'll get people tangled up and you don't you won't know well you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preachers called to preach is and to live it too and and if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and in Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians and that's what we want to be real Christians real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or that or or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil just like well you say well if he could preach like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts a great influential speaker oh oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing he said you get all of that theology you wanted to and all the Seminary training and the devil just sit back and laugh at it but when he sees that life but when he sees that life you see tonight I'd like to speak to you from this thought tonight on the Thunder that shakes the devil the Thunder that shakes the devil you see the devil doesn't care how much you holler the devil doesn't it doesn't care how loud you scream it doesn't matter how loud you shout but what hurts the devil and I think it's something that I absolutely love as a Christian doing is hurting the devil but What Hurts The Devil is to see that real Sanctified holy consecrated life to almighty God and to think that tonight but that that you could have all of his Theology and all the intellects of the world and all the Seminary training but What Hurts The Devil is to see that real Sanctified holy life and remember when Jesus is there with his disciples and that man brought his son that was a lunatic to him I referred to that to you just a few weeks ago but you remember the disciples stood there and that man the little boy had the spirit of epilepsy that was upon him that often comes cast him into the fire but you remember when those disciples when they stood there because of their lack of faith they cannot make that enemy move you see the enemy you can't Bluff the enemy the enemy knows if you've got the goods or not you see you don't have to tell the devil how big you are the devil recognizes a life on the inside of you and you can profess to be a Christian but the devil knows whether you're really living and out or whether you're just making an open confession before men or or others but you see the devil stayed right there upon that epileptic child and Jesus Jesus rebuked them because of their little faith but when the devil that was on the inside or was upon that little child that epileptic devil when he turned around and he seen Jesus he seen something different on the inside of him that he didn't see in the disciples as of that time because they had not been to an upper room yet but you see that devil turned around and he got good and scared right there when he looked over there and he seen that life that was on the inside of that body and let me I'm going to borrow a statement from from Brother Wayne Lawson that devil looked on the inside looked at Jesus and he said how in the world did that man get on the inside of there how did that life get on the inside of that vessel and to think that tonight that sitting here tonight in Earthen vessels tonight that you have this treasure on the inside of Earth and vessels and it's a power under the Holy Ghost it is the life of the word that scares the devil off of what is rightfully yours so they will steer the squatter off of your life you see what it is it's the life that scares the devil it isn't how loud you pump the music up it isn't how loud you scream that scares the devil it is the real Sanctified Holy Ghost life now I can hear every little every little critic already hollering well if that's all it is then why do you do all of that hollering you see there's a life on the inside of us that causes a burden of the word on the inside of our life and I believe that if we can live this message then we ought to be able to shout this message if we can really preach this message and and be a real light in this generation then we ought to be as excited about Jesus Christ as to the world is excited about ball games and everything else out there if we can live this message through its Truity and live it in his Purity then we ought to stand toe-to-toe with the Devil by the life of the word I don't think it's something some people say well well we ought to just we ought to quit our jumping and we ought to quit our shouting because we can't live no higher than this I'll say if you'd start living higher you can be able to start jumping higher if you can start living at a higher level of life and a higher level of faith you'll be able to move into the heavenlies what is it it is the life of the word that has caused a quickening power to come upon our life and quickened us and made us a life you see what Jesus is he is the life Giver to the seed word that he deposited and when you have been birthed by the Holy Ghost by the genuine Holy Spirit it brings the life to the word that he deposited you see in a few silence my life you're silencing my voice and if you can silence the life of Jesus Christ you will silence the voice of the Bride in this hour if you're silencing Jesus then you're silencing us is that right if you silence our life and you're silencing our voices you'll notice that that what did covet try to do he tried to shut us up I know I'm not going to spend too much time on that and I don't care whether you did or whether you didn't but I want you to know that what covet tried to do he tried to shut the very mouth of the people of God up but it's something about the children of God is is they don't take too lightly to shutting up their mouths because we know that if we can put this word upon our lips tonight and really live it not just speak it into the atmosphere as some mental Christian today but really live out what you're praying and really live out what you're saying that the enemy will Run for Cover all right is that right now notice what the Bible said in Revelations 4 and 5 that out of the throne preceded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God what is that it is God speaking to the church he's reflecting himself through those seven spirits and when the true anointed of God speaks it is the voice of God can you say Amen when the true anointed of God speaks it is the voice of God and to reject it is to remove the Candlestick now you cannot remove us from the seventh Church age because if you remove us from the seven Church age you are not just removing us you're removing the voice out of that seventh Church age but we are here right now and there is an anointing here to speak the same things that Paul spoke and it's by a restored word but we recognize that Thunder when you see thunder in the Bible that Thunder is the very voice of God you remember when Jesus goes up there and those Greeks come and they said they wanted to see Jesus but they couldn't see him because of the veil that Jesus prayed a prayer and he in John chapter 12 and 28 he said father glorify thy name and a voice came from heaven and it said I have already glorified it but I will glorify thy name again and there were those that were standing around and said well it thundered and others said that an angel spake but what is it it was the voice of God and Jesus answered them and said the voice didn't come for my sake but the voice came for your sake to think that today that you're living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the Angel's voice that came in this generation came for your sake and Lord still has a voice in this generation and I'm going to blow some of your minds right now but your voice is his voice your voice is his voice if you want to accept it or whether you don't I'm quoting to you William Branham he said your voice is his voice that's why that Satan wants to shut you up put you in a corner because he knows that if the same spirit that was back there in the early Apostles took that word and manifested the same life that was on our Lord Jesus Christ if you take it it'll manifest the same exact thing in this generation you see because deity is not just in heaven but deity is on the inside of a bride of Jesus Christ and Jesus said that heaven and earth will pass away Matthew 24 and 35 Heaven and Earth will pass away but my voice will never pass away is that right his word is his voice because in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the word was you see when God begins to speak he gives strength when he speaks it's forever settled in heaven you see there's a lot of people that can run off at the mouth but when God speaks he's not just blabbering off things but when God says something he means it if God says he loves you if God says he's for you if God says he's your healer if God says he should deliver if God said he's your way maker if God said he'd be your provider it's forever settled in heaven you see when he speaks all hell moves nothing can stand in his presence you know brother random was one time he was preaching there in my commission and he was standing there he said you see he said he said I am just your brother by the grace of God he said but when the angel of the Lord moved down he said it becomes then a voice of God to you he said if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that might been resented now not watch this here's the man trying to ask he felt the way he felt that it was resented he said if I offended you forgive me but watch what the voice of the Lord did he said but I am God's voice to you see I say that again that time was under inspiration he said I felt bad about the first time but it repeated it you see there is something that is in control of the age of that we are living in and we are under the greatest message that the world has ever seen do you recognize that this message that went around the world over seven times but it was not the man William Brandon's voice that caused the attraction to the Lord Jesus Christ it was the voice behind the voice you see because Elijah went up there in that cave you remember he went up there in that cave and he was he thought he was the only one that was serving God in his own in his own stead he thought he was the only one up there but you remember how the Lord came by there and fire and wind and an earthquake but none of them had grabbed his attention but when God spoke to him through a still Small Voice he recognized the presence of the Lord and the reason why you are here tonight it's not because I called you it's not because a man called you it's because the voice of almighty God Came Calling by your way and when you God when God called you if you were his if you were his you could not stay in the pig pen that you are in and in that condition but there was an angel that stood in this generation night after night that stood there you've seen it before service tonight but you watched he was an angel he was an Angelic being that would stand there time and time again that would point out and say now I see this or I see that what was it it was the operation of the Holy Ghost he said it's not my voice it's his voice Hallelujah you see what it is I am God's voice to you what is this in this generation you are God's voice whether the world wants to receive you or not whether the world wants to cast you down or not you are God's voice why don't you just say it with a little bit of prefervency and a little bit of zeal in this generation right now speaking into the atmosphere I am the voice of almighty God God has got to have hands to work through God's got to have a mouth to work through God's got to have a body to work through I am his voice I know it's taken some of you just for a little bit but just for a little bit but you that know the message know that I'm telling you the truth if you know your Bible you know I'm telling you the truth what was it that David did when he stood out there and he turned down all of Saul's ecclesiastical verse he was turning down the intellectual voices that were trying to tell him that he had to go that way but David took the voice he took the voice of a conqueror that had defeated a lion and had defeated a bear and he took the voice of the inside and he went out there and he grabbed those five smooth stones and he defeated Goliath what was it it was one voice and I'll say this to you tonight there was one William Branham but he screamed back on top the hill said boys this is for Divine Healing he took that voice and went out there and all of Israel got behind David's voice oh what are you doing in this generation we're behind our great warrior David we're behind the Lord Jesus Christ we are his voices and if God's wanted to sound out a message he's got to have a body that he can speak through the Bible says in Ezekiel chapter 10 verse 4 that then the glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub and stood over over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with a cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's Glory and the sound of cherubims wings Was Heard even to the outer courts as the voice of the almighty God when he speaks now think about this that the glory of the Lord it began to remove back and the angels and the angels went back and when their wings begin to flock together when they begin to Wings when they begin to Flap together and they were hanging over the very threshold of the house of the Lord that the glory of the Lord filled all the house and the angels Wings when they moved with a sound it was the sound of el shadiah it was the voice it was as the voice of almighty God when the Angels begin to beat their wings it was as the very voice of el shadiah now I know you don't see him tonight but there are angels that are all around this room tonight they are gathered here to make sure that you're okay they're gathered here to protect you they're gathered here to watch you worship because nobody can worship like the redeemed of the Lord can worship but when they if if those angels can and they move in such power that their wings begin to they make a sound it's like the very voice of el Shady eyes speaking now I don't have to tell you what else Shady eye is he is the almighty God he is the breasted one and I'll say this that out of el shadia Abraham got a new body there's an angel in this generation and out of this generation there's been an angel a covenant angel that has stood here and this bride is taking the voice of their Shady eye she's putting on the new garment she's getting ready for rapturing faith you see those angels you may see them and you may feel them as you begin to worship you're bumping into angels all the time you are bumping into a supernatural world now if angels can move their wings and it's like the sound of el shadiah how much more when the Sons and Daughters of God begin to move into the rhythm of the sympathy and they begin to scream out Shalom it is the changing of the beat again and it's a sympathy getting in order and brother random told us he said now you go looking at the Old Testament in Psalms 34 and 7 he said those angels that the angel of the Lord encampeth about them that fear Him Now notice those angels are not leaving you those angels are having a camping party around you those angels are making sure they're not going to sleep when you go to sleep they're watching you we always used to sing that little song we as children angels watching over me but do you recognize that you can't do anything without the angel of the Lord watching over you Hallelujah do you recognize that the voice of el Shady high is covering you in this generation If Abraham can nurse on El Shady eye and he could pull out himself a new body went out to Church of the Living God be able to do be able to nurse off the Old Testament and New Testament you're not in as bad as cases Abraham was Abraham was a hundred years old Abraham didn't have he didn't have any sign of it coming In the Flesh but you've got it coming In the Flesh you feel it working in your spirit but he just leaned over on the breast of el shadiah and he pulled out what'd he do what did he do the same one that had talked to him all of his life had led him to this moment and he didn't call him Abram he called him Abraham ain't Angel stood in this generation said I'm not going to call you Church I'm going to call you bride so that you understand what I'm talking about the reason why you're here is because you recognize the very voice of the Lord and just like John he recognized that voice and when he turned to see he didn't turn he didn't turn to hear the voice he turned to see The Voice because the person and the voice are one and the same you see and John recognized his voice and every son and daughter of God that are here tonight or throughout the Bride of Jesus Christ you are here and he calls to you and you recognized him well it was Peter out there doing when he was fishing he recognized that was his Lord out there when he told him cast his net on the other side he recognized it was the Lord out there when the two disciples that had walked with him all day long when they watched him in his actions what was it they were watching the voice that had spoke to them now create exactly exactly what they were thinking in what they were hoping he would be you see if you can ever really get to seeing the word you'll begin to get to see Jesus if you can get to where you really see the word that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and if you can really get to seeing the word you'll begin to see Jesus you're not seeing a man here tonight I didn't gather you here it was not my emotions it was not my Charisma that gathered you here it was the voice of another world that called you here is that right I'm gonna lay some words for you tonight and just as Moses was talking to a burning bush and the voice talked out of that burning bush I'll say the same one is as close to you right now as he was standing there with Moses at that burning bush he's walking the aisle tonight and he's beginning to open up your hearts and he's as close to you right now picture it in your mind Moses talking to a burning bush but picture it right now our Lord Jesus Christ having a conversation with you now don't get mistaked by the veil don't get your eyes on the veil you look at who's talking to you you see because if it's God's voice it'll line up with the word but you watch John recognized it was that same voice that was talking to him it was the same one that done those all of those actions it was the same boys in the midst of the seven Church ages he wasn't on the outside of the church he was walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which represent all of the church ages so it doesn't show it doesn't show he shows us that right here right now son of man is working in this place you've not built up your mind to think that it's that it's something all for something off in a distance but you recognize that the son of man is here right now he's revealing himself by the very preaching of the word and this bride's Revival that you are in it's not something that you're you're it's not something that you're just shook up about and is it something new this message turned our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers you know you know why I'm preaching you the truth because brother random said in trying to do God a service he said hey Revival will never come until the Sovereign God sends it he said it would take some it'll take some little nitwit they can't even sign his own name and do with it that knows that it don't even know good English let alone Greek but what is it the spirit of the Lord can never send a Revival a revival can never come until the spirit of the Lord sends it it's for an appointed time and it's for an appointed season and you remember what William Branham preached to us in the third seal he said the bride's not had her Revival yet she's still waiting on this is 1963. he said the bride's not had a Revival yet he said it'll take those seven Known Unknown Thunders back there to wake her up this bride I know we're living in a generation that want to call themselves woke but we've been woke up to a long time ago when the Thunders woke us up to who we really are the rest of the world is getting woke up and thinking they're coming out of the closet but the Bride of Jesus Christ knows exactly who she is that's what the Bible said in revelation 22 and 10 seal not up these prophesies still not enough still not up the sayings of this book what is it it is a restoration of the Bride tree the same one that was there the same fruit that was in the bridegroom is in the bride tree again and you could not have been here without a restoration but because he said unseal the book unseal the book that is exactly what the Seven Seals or the opening of the seals did it is the revelation of the seven Thunders and you have been woke up to the fact I am a bride I am his chosen I am elected that's what shakes the devil is because you know who you are you know who you believe it's a voice on the inside of the body you've been woke up to the fact that you've got a pedigree you've been woke up to the fact that you got an abstract title deed you've been woke up to the fact that you've got the very token life of almighty God and you can't rock me back to sleep little devil you can't put me back to sleep you can't play enough soft moves music to shut me up Hallelujah I've been woke up to the fact that I'm the final voice in this final age and I can't go to sleep on it [Applause] that's the Thunder that shakes the Devil is a voice that lives it out a voice that believes it a voice that takes it when he and his wife get in speaking conditions again then an Eden will come foreign brand I'm standing there and he preaches to us the anointed ones at the end time and he stands there and he goes on through there and he goes and takes the opening of the seals the third pool Ministry or the face of the seventh seal he goes in there and he connects the third pull to Luke 17 30 to Malachi 4 and the revelations 10 and he opens a mystery to the Bride of Jesus Christ that there is Christ there's a prophet and there is a bride in this generation in all of those verses I'll just give you brother Branham pointed us in our anointed ones at the end time that the third poll is connected to the bride's Ministry so you see it's no longer the king's sword is no longer in the mighty Angel's hand he's the one to give it but it's not in the mighty Angel's hand it's not in the prophet's hand but this this sword of the Lord is in the hand of the Bride you have the saith the Lord you will shut down hell Hallelujah that's the Thunder why don't you start speaking out what do you have in your hand Moses if Moses could stretch her Rod out brother joy and it could open up rich sea and you walk over on dry ground and have one of the greatest phenomenals I say it'll be this bright that takes this third pool Ministry and opens up all the laodicea and we walk out of this chaos well I don't know about you I'm ready why don't we take an Enoch stroll real quick you couldn't put nothing on Enoch's life and everybody could criticize him everybody could say all kinds of needs about him but he had a virtuous life he was so pleasing to God that God was so pleased with his life that one of those days he just took him why don't we just have a walk with Higher King theophany oh and notice what the Bible said in Zechariah 4 and I'm not going to read it to you but I I you can go back and read it a little bit later but I want to I want to gather this song just for a minute because Zechariah say it in verse verse 1 of chapter four he said in the angel that talk of me came again and wake me as a man that had waken me out of his sleep that awakened out of his sleep you go and read that that there Zechariah is shown he he looks all the way into the church ages he sees the same thing that John was looking at he saw the seven golden candlesticks he saw the two olive trees of which those lamps were gathering their oil out of both old and both New Testament and you recognize and you know good and well that the oil represents the Holy Ghost you see and all of those lamps they were lit off of the original fire that came off of the altar what was it it was that fire that God sent down out of Heaven that was ordained to go to the church ages and so the priests would go over and he would take the fire off of The Altar and he'd come over and he would light the first one that was on top of the bowl and it would take from that first lamp he would gather the fire from the first lamp and he would take it over to the second lap he'd take the fire from the second half onto the third onto the fourth and all the way down until all of those lamps were burning what was it they were burning with the same fire that came from the original altar what are you burning with you are burning with the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost the same holy ghost that Paul had you have what is it it's an oil it's an oil and it's a never-ending oil it can't run out he's the all-sufficient one he is your satisfying portion Abraham everywhere else couldn't satisfy Abraham but El shadiah was his satisfying portion I've had the world but give me Jesus I've had the World by itself but give me Jesus he is my satisfying portion drugs couldn't keep me alcohol couldn't steal me the Devil Couldn't kill me because God is my satisfying portion Hallelujah Hallelujah it's the same fire that's what shakes the devil it's the same life it can be more I know there's a whole lot of professors and there's a whole lot of confessors but you can watch them professors in their confessions your watch ain't nothing but a bunch of Spectators that have set on the sideline and when you're facing the real devil they'll Run for Cover and they'll be nothing what by what they're good for nothing but a bunch of good benchwarming people that'll never stand there and take your back they'll back off when you're really facing a devil you watch a good spectator announce one of the generals that he's got cancer in his body you watching you watch those little you watch those little Devils they'll begin to run forgive me if I've offended you but I'm not here to be a spectator and I'm not here to take a side with somebody that'll back off and give off I'm here to be with somebody that's not afraid to shake the kingdom of hell laughs what is it God ain't looking for some intellectual Giant he said you know he said what the problem is with the world he said they want their intellectual preachers he said they want one of them Whispering Whispering preachers one of them Whispering pastors he said but what God wants is thunderbolts he wants somebody that recognized the voice of God if Moses Moses was back there on the backside of a dancer but one time in the presence of the Lord and he went down there to Egypt and he took over what was it it was a son of man making Invasion down there into Egypt I'm trying to bottle up the preacher just for a moment but God didn't want some sissified soul that can stand back here and says take my intellectual armor put it on it'll do you good but there's a bride like little David said I never proved that before but I have proved this word it's killed lines it's killed Giants it's killed bears I can take Hebrews 13 8 and I can tell you it works I can take Isaiah 53 and I can tell you that it works somebody's going to put this word on their lips because they know that they were dealing with a closed book they're dealing with an open book They're Not Afraid of the restoration of the gifts back into the body they're not afraid because you have been given a restoration all right so right I'm telling you the truth you're not under you're not under some gospel that ain't been restored you're under you are under the ministry of Malachi 4 where your hearts have been turned back to the faith of Paul and the apostolic fathers now notice notice what it did it was in three days that God restored and he showed that he was alive again on the first day in Luther's day there was no life there in Wesley's day there was no life there and on the third day it was a rumor that he was up but on but at the end at the evening time they recognize that the same one that they'd walk with on the shores of Galilee was showing himself openly before the generation what is this generation sin it's the restoration of the broad tree Hallelujah brother Andrew what about all these other churches they say they're the Church of God they say they're the Church of Christ that's a name that they tacked on there God didn't attack that name on there he only put his name in one place and there's good people in them churches some of the finest people you ever meet down there in them churches but remember it was this church age that spew that kicked Jesus out put him on the outside what was it they didn't want the life of it you remember America turned her back on this message they put him on the outside they didn't want him in the schools they didn't want him in the house they didn't want him in their churches they definitely don't want him behind the pulpit but you watch they can stand there and they'll go on professing that they are the mouthpiece of God but notice God says she's not my mouthpiece she she'll go on professing and saying that she is the voice to the world but it's very contrary to the very word of God come on somebody now I know that it looks close but remember the seed is not air with the shuck it's not it you see what happened Pentecost had to push you out Pentecost had to separate so that you could show what was really on the inside the same seed that went down into the ground it's the same one that's resurrected again what is God coming back for the same life he said I am Alpha and I am Omega what you saw in the first stage was the alpha bride what you're seeing in the Southern church age is the Omega bride she's born of his bone life of his life power is power same anointing same work same actions Satan can't stand the thought that you are going to be the same Jesus he lost at the cross he lost at the grave he lost with the weather that had a dead baby and he still losing he lost in Mexico he lost in Memphis he lost in Tennessee he lost in Elkton he will lose the battle because we are not born of this world we are born of another world [Applause] Satan I got bad news for you you're gonna keep on losing and we're gonna keep on winning we've been burst from above it's your kingdom not just in word but since it's a kingdom in power God has a voice and his voice is in his wife now your brothers know you either have a real marriage I make you testify you don't be too scared if you got a real marriage anyway your brothers know you've got a real marriage there ain't nobody you trust more than your wife trust her with your secrets you trust her with your bank account you trust her with your life you trust her with everything now who could God trust with with all of his power and all of his authority what is he going to have to do he's going to have to give her the same mind that was in him it's going to have to be in the bride because William Branham said she knows what he once done with the word now how could you know what he once done with the word unless you had his mind how could you know that he's still marks 16 in action how can you still know that there's still gifts in the body how can you still know that there's healing and there's powers in The Miracle what is it it's the dynamite on the inside of your mind that says Jesus is still Jesus you go show me that word power it's dunamis it means The Miracle Worker you watch how did you get that power little Dynamite Packaging just dropped off on the day of your Resurrection up in heaven before the foundation of the world and when the life of the Holy Ghost comes slipping over your life boom what's wrong with them people we got short triggers it's like you like it's like you like that little little Tracy freezer and all of a sudden Boop some had to get on the inside of you I could point that all of you throughout here today well it's not all of you but I'll point at some of you I don't want to scare you but I got faith that you can get it you mean to tell me that I'll act like that let me tell you if you get the same Dynamite that I got if you get the same package dropped off at your house I signed for it I accepted it it's rightfully mine well I don't know if I can handle it you just stand here long enough and let the watering of the word wash over your life and you'll be amazed at what you'll do before long you'll stand there say well all I'm going to do is give a little golf clap about what he's preaching about and before along your old Methodist foot is stomping around think of my goodness I'm acting like a bunch of rest of him what is it it was a dynamite that almighty God did posited before the foundation of the world and if you are Dynamite that means he is Almighty Dynamite [Applause] Satan you better be careful this place is tend to blow he says more than C4 this is more than TNT we're going to blow this whole world and we are going to walk out on the ashes we're going to walk out we're going to rise above it all because we are elected to overthrow every devil in hell blessed be the name of the Lord the Thunder that shakes the devil live voices live it out live it out you're setting under a powerful Ministry but live it out he's not scared of a dead voice he's not scared of an intellectual voice he's not scared of a seminary voice but what shakes The Devil Is that real Sanctified live voice live it out live it out oh my I just don't know live it out take a deep breath you're gonna be okay you ain't got to figure this all out in one Accord you ain't got to figure it out in one day you ain't got to figure it out the Bible said I believe in the book of Deuteronomy he said I give you the land little by little that it won't overtake you but I will be an adversary to your adversaries and when the enemy Rises against you I will rise I will rise and you are going to destroy the kings of the earth go study it out I believe it's Deuteronomy 7. I think that's right I'll give it to you after church if you don't believe me but I'm telling you the truth he said he said and you will destroy the names of their kings so let me tell you the king of sin the king of worry the king of doubt the king of depression you've got to destroy him little by little you can do this you're an overcomer you're not just a Survivor you're gonna do it live it out live it out [Applause] it's a real voice there's power behind his voice because he spoke and there was he said let there be and they're once so the same one has got to be speaking through you brother Chris but you've got to break the carnality out of your life I know it's going to get sticky but I promise you it it'll get better but you've got to break the voice of reason you've got to break the voice of carnality well we've did our new service we've sang a few songs the preacher read some scriptures he made a funny comment he looked a little funny he did his he did his part let's sing a song at the end let's be dismissed the days of watering the not watering the seed are over too many times churches around the message have set and barely watered the seed they set back and they only pour a little bit of water on it let me tell you when it's in the driest of Seasons you brothers that are gardeners you make sure to put the water on the seed because you want it to come up but the days of only barely watering the seed are over this is the hour that we take our worship to another level we don't worship from this ground we worship From Below above come on I'm happy with one Sean we'll get out of here I'm sorry I'm sorry I know that he likes worship I know where he's blessed you at and I am not afraid to worship whether I burn your rose burn your chicken burn your hide I don't care we have come to the king of kings and we are going to worship Him don't like long Services you just never should have said under Paul because Paul preached all night long and a guy fell over and he died you thought he got the point but he went back there and resurrected him and he went back to preaching [Applause] come on now come on now I ain't held you all night I ain't held you all week long get with me preach with me if you want to see Deliverance stand up on your feet one good time get over yourself pity get over your ideas why don't you shake the devil out of your life and try to say well just impress me just excite me [Applause] I got the same problem that I had two weeks ago I tried what you said and I gave up that's the reason you still got the same problem but if you really live it out you're living like job lifted it didn't matter what everybody else saw it didn't matter what everybody else seen you could put Joan in a belly's well you could put Daniel in the Lion's Den but it was still and overcomer you love me you love me yeah I won't shut up and I won't sit down because I'm not the one that brought this message to this town the Holy Ghost has brought this message by your way and we will not back off on the seven seven seals mystery we won't back up the fivefold ministry we will stand here and preach to you a live voice we will preach to you that you can win you can overcome foreign to me for Moses why grind me speak we're living in a very second time look at the earthquake look at the ring of fire around the world it won't be long it won't be long but you watch worlds are shaking Financial statuses are shaking politics are shaking but you've received a kingdom that cannot be shook come on somebody the rest of the world's shaking the rest of the world's nervous but you have received a kingdom that cannot be shook because you receive the kingdom of God and God cannot shake himself God ain't getting Shook Up in Heaven say well hell my goodness I didn't see that one coming God ain't shook up and so should you not be shook off you received a kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Ghost a kingdom of God that cannot shaken but this voice shakes the very Kingdom of hell what is the kingdom of Satan brother Andrew it's anything that's contrary to the word of God he's going to make you all kinds of promises but he can't give you salvation he can't give you peace he can't give you happiness what is he going to bring to you he's going to bring to you anything that's contrary to the word of God but the Bible said in Corinthians 4 and 20 that the kingdom of God is not in word but it is in power is that right you see what that word is it's the word that is made flesh it's John 1 and 14. the Word was made flesh and it dwelt amongst us and the kingdom of God comes on the inside of you and when it becomes on the inside of you that he that abideth in me ask what you will and it shall be done unto you when the kingdom of God is on the inside of you what is it doing it makes itself word and it says exactly what it said David said in Psalms 1 16 and 10 he said I believe therefore I speak we've not followed Conley devised Fables We are following the voice of the almighty one all right all right hold the message up hold the message up and your watch stays open up the intelligence that brought you here set boundaries around you I'm going to say something very powerful right here that the intelligence that brought you here has set boundaries about you that Satan can only go so far if the moon sets the boundaries of the sea so does this bride have a voice to say Satan that's far enough I've had enough of you I'm sick and tired of you stealing my joy that's what this age is to restore it's to restore all that the canker worm the Palmer worm the caterpillar all of those things all in all ate off Satan that's far enough you've ate it my joy long enough you've ate at my peace long enough you've aided my happiness long enough happiness Lord is joy and the joy of the Lord is my strength what was it what was it Zachariah Zechariah when the angel of the Lord asked him said do you understand what you're looking at you understand what you're looking at and he said oh Lord he said I'm saying this he said it's not by might and it's not by power but it's by my spirits saith the Lord you don't know how many times I've set an altar spent hours with people countless saying these words I just can't live it and they gave up I just I just can't live it well I want to give you a news flash to all the world you couldn't live it either come on now you know good and well you tried and you tried and you tried and you tried but you just couldn't live it but one morning one moment one time he made the difference where you couldn't live it but now he's living it on the inside of you I'm telling you you hold on to him he'll hold on to you it ain't some Mama's religion it ain't your daddy's religion it ain't some coattail religion it's him living it out on the inside of the Bride [Applause] yeah you want to start digging some ditches though cause it's time for some water to flow come on now you know you've been going through a dry spell it's all right you know you've been going through a dry spell and you've been thinking I can't live this I feel like I'm I'm unstable in my ways I'm here I'm this way this way and I'm that way that way it's time you start digging some ditches stop living a double life stop going and beating your head against the wall it's time to live it hear my voice young people hear my voice it's time to live it it's time to live it he said well I just can't do it when Jesus went up there in Matthew chapter 4 . in Matthew chapter 4 after the greatest greatest event that had happened till this time comes out in Matthew chapter 3. and he walks out into the Jordan and he walks out there and he said I have need to be baptized of the John foreign suffered to be so and he baptizes our Lord Jesus Christ there they are the Holy Ghost shows up and a voice from Heaven saying behold hear ye him but Jesus walks up show the weakest of Christians you can live it out you can live it out I don't know if I can do it or not I don't know if I can go an extra mile I don't know if I can go any further I'm so hungry for a move of God I'm so thirsty for him to come by my way Jesus had fasted for 40 days was that his weakest condition foreign you could see the very interest of his body he'd been up there and Satan oh when the Lord showed me this yesterday I it took me rather a long time to come back foreign where I'm at here's the author of life here's the one that created the moons the Stars the molecules created life created everything that created Lucifer here he is and he's he's in his weakest condition he's in the worst spot that he's physically been in until the cross his jaw is sunk in his eyes are deep set his veins are very barely flowing he's in a weakened condition and he hears his creation tempting him if you be the son of God I'm done seeing some things in your life and I just heard what happened down there on Jordan River I've heard about you getting a baptism of the Holy Ghost if you really got the goods you can you can manifest you can manifest some real power right here somebody's heard that before if you really got the Holy Ghost why don't you go lay hands on Brother on I got every devil in Hale's attention right now I'm going to show you a real key if you be who you say you are why don't you turn these stones in the bread come on now come on now if you're really a real message believer if you're really under the voice of the seventh angel why don't you show me won't you show me who you are come on now come on now come on now show me who you are can you imagine the creation talking to the Creator like them and you get in your weakest spots and you say God why'd you do this to me why'd you allow me to go here oh my God I can't go no further God I can't dig in no more I can't battle this on my own you're in a weak spot but you can win and you can overcome Jesus was Jesus was making an example for the weakest of Christians it is written man shall not live by bread alone come on now if you really be the Son of God why don't you cast yourself down off of this Pinnacle and why don't the Angels carry you up thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God you ought to know who you're talking to I'm the one that created you I'm the one that brought you into existence Lucifer he really wanted to he could have shown all of his fine qualities it all had all the anointing he had everything laying in him and all he had to do is just speak it and Lucifer is gone but he wanted to show you when you couldn't give another inch and when you couldn't go another Mile and when you felt like you done did everything on your own you felt like man everybody else is living it but I can't live it everybody else is living a real Christian life but I've had enough I can't do it I'm so weak but brother random said that when the weakest of Christians goes on their knees all of hell trembles you might be weak but in your weakness he is made strong [Applause] it's time to speak little bride it is written take your hands off of God's Property it is written by his stripes we are healed it is written that I have repented of my sins been baptized in his name it's time to be filled with the life of almighty God I'm gonna make it I'm going to win I'm gonna make it I'm going to overcome I'm gonna be spotless I'm going to be blameless I'm going to be pure I'm going to be righteous I'm going to be holy I can live this message I can be consecrated I can be I can have a greater devotion I can have a greater fervancy the Seal of his house has eaten me

granddaddy I'm gonna see my Grandmama I'm going to see the Lord Jesus I'm gonna make it I'm going to win [Applause] I'm done I'm not foreign I'm not going to be like Lucifer I'm not going to tempt the creation I'm not going to attempt the Creator your ways are hiring them always you understand what I can go through you understand what I can take and when it gets far enough that intelligence says take your hands off that's more enough I'm gonna drop this story to you and then let the musicians come and I'm but I want you to stay Just Like You Are in this in this moment this intelligence that is in this room understands what you are going through remember when he was standing there with an infidel when he starts talking to him about an apple and he starts preaches back to him he said he said oh you preachers are a bunch of lying dogs you're barking up the wrong tree he said but there is one I'd like to see he said because there was a sister on top of hill here was dying I said I heard this awful noise that was going on and hurt his awful noises going and thought well she doesn't die we'll just wait until the morning take the wagon up there and we'll take her take her to the Undertaker so we went up there and there was a man that had prayed over a handkerchief and they laid it on this woman and she was up fixing them breakfast the next morning he said I'd like to meet him I'd like to meet that guy he said what makes this happen because they're starting to fall off he said the life's leaving the tree it's going back into the ground he said he said what's doing that and he said he said well it's it's just nature you know the story he said but he said I'll tell you he said the same intelligence the same intelligence that tells this tree to run itself all the way down in The Roots he said it is the same intelligence that told me to do that she said it's the same intelligence now there that intelligence will stand in front of that Infidel all those days that same intelligence was standing there preaching to him time and time again that intelligence that you need to really live this message is in this room some of you are tired of fighting you're tired of fighting tired of wondering am I going to make it that intelligence is in the room to give you overcoming power you know I'm telling you the truth and you're aware that I didn't create this atmosphere but he dropped in here to tell you the weakest lowest the people that's lived double lives of people let's live this way or the that way he's wanting you they're going to come to call the righteous I come to call The Sinner to repentance you're exactly what the son of man is looking for you're exactly what he's looking for gonna break the carnality out of your life you've got to break the sin out of your life stop talking about Old Flames stop talking about this one and that one that you use today don't put that adulterous Spirit back into your family don't put that lust spirit in your home
