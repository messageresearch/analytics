[40:59] we received all of our family back from
[41:01] the Louisiana Camp there on Monday and
[41:04] they all got back in and and every one
[41:07] of them were just so elated with their
[41:09] each of their experience and and each of
[41:13] them receiving their own personal touch
[41:14] of the Holy Spirit how that he dealt
[41:16] with them individually and that's what I
[41:18] love about the Lord he's so personal and
[41:20] he's so real and you know he knows how
[41:23] to come to us and speak to us and what
[41:25] might seem small to somebody it's very
[41:27] major for somebody else and I just love
[41:30] how the Lord can can express his love to
[41:33] us and what are you doing there you
[41:36] supposed to be over here threw me off
[41:40] man oh oh man that's an awful powerful
[41:44] amen coming from that second row there
[41:47] so so well well that's right make room
[41:50] hey let's let's make room in this place
[41:53] we we believe in making room here so but
[41:57] uh uh we we just thank the Lord for for
[41:59] all of his grace for all the all the
[42:01] helpers the drivers that were able to go
[42:04] they were hey when when we got
[42:06] counselors coming back and saying they
[42:08] were perfect kids you know and just just
[42:10] great all the way no hiccups no
[42:12] accidents that's a long way 17 hours one
[42:15] way and 17 hours back with no accidents
[42:17] that's the grace of the Lord and then to
[42:20] receive them back and to see them full
[42:22] of the Holy Ghost and charged and I tell
[42:25] you what it's just just it just does our
[42:27] heart great
[42:30] good God bless you Sister CL good to see
[42:38] you and then they took good great care
[42:41] of our pastor down there Louisiana I
[42:43] want y'all know that they took really
[42:44] good care of him and they were the best
[42:46] that they could be to him but you know
[42:49] uh we just we serve a real we serve a
[42:51] real God and we Face a real enemy and uh
[42:55] you know it had been said that brother
[42:56] Ron r back the clock and preach like a
[42:59] young man and then he come back here on
[43:02] Monday and spent the day with us and on
[43:04] Tuesday had a had a severe heart attack
[43:07] there and and brother Matthews already
[43:09] went through those details and so we
[43:12] just want to be mindful and of our of
[43:14] our pastor and be remembering him and
[43:17] got home from the hospital there
[43:18] yesterday and and uh yeah he's home and
[43:22] he's and uh I've give him full
[43:24] permission to stay home as long as he
[43:26] needs to and
[43:27] and uh
[43:38] so you know the Lord is in control of
[43:40] every situation because while brother
[43:43] Ron is sitting in the hospital he's
[43:45] having the heart attack it if it had
[43:47] been 20 minutes difference you know it
[43:49] could have been a been a major thing you
[43:51] know basically this is how you look at
[43:53] things we were 20 minutes away from a
[43:55] funeral this week and and so we we just
[43:58] realize how how powerful our Lord is
[44:00] that he controls every circumstance of
[44:02] our life for his calling in our life and
[44:05] so we just we want to be mindful of our
[44:08] pastor and want to be praying for him
[44:10] and I'll be taking the services for
[44:12] quite some time here and until brother
[44:14] Ron feels feels like coming back and
[44:17] taking the pull pit he he he definitely
[44:19] wants to uh be here for your your
[44:21] wedding sister Hannah brother Chester
[44:23] wants to be be a part of that and and uh
[44:27] so so we just we're just going to take
[44:29] our time with the Lord and let the Lord
[44:31] work out all the details in brother
[44:33] Ron's life he's he's got him here this
[44:35] far and he'll take him the rest of the
[44:37] way and so I'll be taking the services

[44:43] ministering for us on Saturday night and
[44:46] then uh Lord willing we're going to be
[44:48] having a wedding that Sunday and still

[44:59] service to remove this platform here and
[45:02] certainly thankful to have brother Isaac
[45:03] coming and speaking for us next weekend
[45:05] he's a young man that's full of the Holy
[45:07] Ghost and the Lord's put a a very unique
[45:09] gift in his life to preach the message
[45:11] and and uh we're very grateful to have a
[45:13] man of God like brother Isaac and we've
[45:16] told him he cannot come here without
[45:17] sister Bethany and amen so if he comes
[45:21] here without her we just we ain't going
[45:22] to let him preach so and so I asked him

[45:30] one day so so but uh so but when brother
[45:34] Ron gets back in this pull pit the devil

[45:51] so how many love the Lord tonight amen
[45:55] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[45:56] let's just go to the Lord in prayer here
[45:58] tonight Heavenly Father we come boldly
[46:00] before your throne father Lord
[46:03] recognizing how great that your mercy
[46:06] and your grace is Upon Our Life father
[46:08] that every detail Lord every
[46:10] circumstance is a part of our calling in
[46:13] our election father Lord we can never
[46:17] can never discount Lord one instance in
[46:19] our life father because it's it's you
[46:21] getting us to a place that you have
[46:24] destined for us father in this journey
[46:27] and Lord we just want to be very
[46:29] sensitive to the call of the Lord Upon
[46:31] Our Life father that we that we match
[46:33] the very promise of your word in this
[46:35] hour Lord and we just we ask Lord that
[46:38] you would come amongst us with a
[46:40] supernatural charge of the Holy Ghost
[46:42] here tonight Lord there's some things
[46:44] that you've dealt with me on this week
[46:46] father and I just want to get myself out
[46:49] of the way father and to minister these
[46:51] things and Lord I cannot do this on my
[46:54] own so father I invite you father to
[46:56] take this P pit just now take Lord over
[46:59] my vessel father as I give over to you
[47:02] and yield over I pray that the blessings
[47:04] of God would come Lord and you would
[47:06] deliver a word in due season for your
[47:08] children now father we'll be careful to
[47:10] serve you and praise you and give you
[47:12] all the glory and honor I pray you be
[47:14] very mindful of our pastor brother Ron
[47:16] here tonight Lord he's Lord he's it's a
[47:19] miracle that how that you have kept his
[47:21] life so many times father there's
[47:24] brother Ron's testimony is just is it's
[47:27] an amazing story of Grace father and
[47:30] Lord Full Gospel Lighthouse has seen the
[47:32] very hero of Faith raised right up
[47:34] amongst them Lord and to see the faith
[47:37] of of a man Lord to preach this message
[47:40] and to live it out father and I I pray
[47:42] God that you would just bless him
[47:43] abundantly Lord in his body Lord it it
[47:46] hurts us Lord to to look at a man to see
[47:49] that he has to go through all of these
[47:50] things but Lord I I'm so grateful to
[47:53] know that you have a plan in every one
[47:54] of our lives and I pray father that you
[47:57] would just restore him he's had a great
[47:59] big week father in his body but I serve
[48:02] a great God that paid for all of his
[48:05] healing right there in Isaiah 53 when
[48:08] you were at the cross father you paid
[48:09] for brother Ron's healing and I pray
[48:11] father for a surge of the Holy Ghost to
[48:14] go by the way of the Spencers just now
[48:17] and you'd minister to him in a very
[48:19] special way father we ask these things
[48:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:25] amen and amen
[48:27] if you have your Bibles this evening
[48:28] wouldd like to look over in the Book of
[48:30] John
[48:32] 3:14 John 3 verse
[48:50] 14
[48:55] Hallelujah
[49:04] you love the
[49:06] Lord John
[49:08] 3:14 and as Moses lifted up the Ser
[49:12] serpent in the
[49:13] wilderness even so must the son of man
[49:18] be lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[49:21] him should not perish but have eternal
[49:24] life for God so so love the world that
[49:28] he gave his only begotten son that
[49:32] whosoever believeth in him should not
[49:34] perish but have everlasting life may God
[49:38] bless his word you may be seated in the
[49:41] presence of the Lord I would like to
[49:43] speak to you tonight on the 11th
[49:47] commandment the 11th commandment and
[49:49] this we know that that God is is is so
[49:53] powerful and that his ways are higher
[49:56] than our ways
[49:57] and we know that by the studying out the
[50:00] Bible that that God is love and that God
[50:03] is that God is the word love is found
[50:07] throughout all of the Bible over 300
[50:09] times so God laced in his word a very
[50:13] very attribute of himself which is love
[50:16] and God God laid some very powerful
[50:19] things in scriptures on love and it
[50:21] would take us it would take us quite
[50:22] some time to be able to express what the
[50:25] love of God truly is and brother randam
[50:27] said that the mightiest Force there is
[50:30] on Earth is love that's exactly there's
[50:34] nothing that will break down love no
[50:36] matter what it is brother bam one time
[50:39] would use an analogy about talking about
[50:42] he he would talk about the love of God
[50:44] and how powerful that the love of God is
[50:46] he said could you imagine taking all of
[50:48] the water that there is here on Earth
[50:51] and take it and and you would pack it
[50:53] into us in a into a pipe and that would
[50:55] maybe be this big around he said and he
[50:57] put it up there at the top he said you
[50:58] can imagine all the thousands of miles
[51:00] of air of pipe that would be there he
[51:03] said and he said then he said all of
[51:05] that water he said all of that pressure
[51:07] that is on top of that pipe he said that
[51:10] would be equivalent to the power of
[51:12] God's love that is trying to work in
[51:15] this building or work in this meeting or
[51:17] work in our lives he said just that very
[51:20] pressure of divine love everything he
[51:22] said that's what he's trying to do is
[51:25] his love is trying to press its way into
[51:28] a people so we recognize that by the
[51:31] prophet's language that love is a very
[51:34] powerful very powerful thing brother
[51:36] Brandon would preach on love God's love
[51:38] projected he would preach right here in
[51:40] Harrisonburg on on on love he would say
[51:43] some very powerful things and even
[51:45] prominent things to our area right here
[51:47] in that message of Love brother brandom
[51:49] said that love is a powerful force and
[51:52] he said when love is projected and when
[51:54] it comes to the end of its strength then
[51:56] Sovereign Grace will take it up from
[51:58] there and will grant the object that
[52:01] love has asked for he said that is the
[52:03] reason that we have a savior tonight
[52:06] that God so loved the world that his
[52:08] love being projected toward the World
[52:11] produced a savior he said God wanted so
[52:14] much to see you well that his love went
[52:17] out and it produced an atonement for
[52:20] your sickness as well as your sins he
[52:23] said it was the love of God that
[52:25] constrained him to to do it he said
[52:27] nothing is greater than love he said it
[52:29] brings trust it brings faith it brings
[52:31] part and love has no fear love cast out
[52:35] fear I have found a great deal of fear
[52:38] amongst Christians he said this is not
[52:40] he said this is not right and should not
[52:42] be so he said because the fear is the
[52:45] lack of
[52:46] confidence fear is the lack of
[52:48] confidence he said but if you love and
[52:50] have confidence you will Cast Away fear
[52:54] God wants you to have love and
[52:56] confidence confidence in him he said and
[52:58] this will Cast Away your fears and bring
[53:01] you to serve him with a greater love
[53:05] that's what the love of God does it
[53:07] literally throws away your fear the idea
[53:11] that you can't live up to the status of
[53:13] being a Christian the love of God throws
[53:16] that away the idea that you will not get
[53:19] made will not be made whole Love cast
[53:22] that away the idea that you won't be in
[53:25] a Rapture love cast that away now love
[53:28] is not based on legalistic laws laws
[53:32] that we have to keep love is based on
[53:35] faith in one another faith in God trust
[53:38] in God and confidence in God that's what
[53:41] love is based on he said I will tell you
[53:44] this my friends that when the love of
[53:46] God comes into your heart you won't go
[53:48] around hurting or being hurt when you
[53:51] believe God you really believe him and
[53:53] get married to him that you die out to
[53:56] the things of the world then God
[53:58] projects his love and his love is what
[54:02] makes you what you
[54:04] are love is what makes you what you are
[54:08] you think about the love that a husband
[54:10] has towards his wife it's amazing what
[54:13] that love can do that love can literally
[54:16] change a human being it literally can
[54:19] make them and that is just a human love
[54:22] it can literally change them because
[54:24] they want to match the Desir of their
[54:27] helpmate and I I'll just tell you right
[54:29] now Love Is in the Air there's been more
[54:32] there's been more engagements in the
[54:34] last in the last three months amongst
[54:36] the people of the Bride then then I then
[54:39] I I'll be honest I was really praying
[54:41] about these things I was I was praying
[54:43] very he heavily about these things
[54:45] because I was I was concerned about it
[54:47] then all of a sudden we we had a little
[54:49] thing at our youth group and I I'll tell
[54:51] you brother Vernon you'd have been proud
[54:52] of brother Matthew I asked him to just
[54:54] kind of give a little a little session
[54:56] on love and what it is to love somebody
[54:58] and find a help mate and I tell you ever
[55:00] since Matthew gave that conversation I
[55:02] tell
[55:04] you I tell you what anybody needing a
[55:07] church that's got young people that are
[55:08] afraid to talk and get and get hooked up
[55:11] together and talk to each other we'll
[55:12] we'll hire brother Matthew
[55:17] out I mean look at
[55:20] it I got Malachi and sister Khloe over
[55:23] here engaged he wasn't even here when
[55:25] Matthew told it that's how power
[55:26] powerful that it
[55:27] was now notice now notice I'm still in
[55:30] line with our thought on the dividing of
[55:33] inheritance because if you don't have
[55:34] love you can't move into the promises of
[55:36] God that's just how it is if you don't
[55:39] love God if you don't love his word if
[55:41] you don't love this message you can
[55:43] never do anything for god without the
[55:45] love of God being on the inside of you
[55:48] you've got to love him for this message
[55:51] to become a reality you've got to love
[55:54] the message for you to Express what the
[55:57] message is you've got to love God now
[56:00] notice what the Bible said in
[56:01] Deuteronomy 11:11 but the land with you
[56:04] go to possess it it is a land of Hills
[56:07] and Valleys and drinketh water of the
[56:09] rain of Heaven A Land which the Lord thy
[56:12] God carth for the eyes of the Lord thy
[56:15] God are always upon it from the
[56:18] beginning of the year even un the end of
[56:20] the year and it shall come to pass that
[56:22] if you hearken diligently unto my
[56:24] Commandments which I command man you
[56:26] this day to love the Lord your God and
[56:31] to serve him with all of your heart and
[56:33] with all of your soul notice how
[56:36] powerful that that that this word is
[56:39] that he says that I will give you the
[56:41] rain of your land in its due season the
[56:45] first rain and the latter rain that thou
[56:47] mayest Gather in thy corn and thy Wayne
[56:50] thy wine and thine oil you think how
[56:54] powerful that this love of God God that
[56:56] all of your heart that that if you love
[56:59] his Commandments if you diligently seek
[57:01] him if you think about it in this aspect
[57:04] that love is the controlling factor that
[57:07] it is hanging upon the contingencies of
[57:10] the promises all of these are contention
[57:13] upon loving God and serving God do you
[57:16] recognize that the latter R which is the
[57:19] Holy Ghost is literally contingent upon
[57:25] love
[57:27] now notice brother manam here in
[57:29] Harrisonburg said this he said therefore
[57:31] John 3:16 tonight he said although it's
[57:34] small in portion he said it holds enough
[57:36] value to save the
[57:39] world and the church said he said it's
[57:42] got enough value in it to heal every
[57:44] sick person that's on the Earth today
[57:47] it's a pardon to every sinner it's joy
[57:50] to every weary person it's hope for the
[57:52] Hopeless it's food for the saint it's
[57:55] healing for the sick it's pardon for
[57:57] those who are troubled he said it's all
[58:00] those things if you you receive it it as
[58:04] as that if you receive it as that it's
[58:07] got enough value in it to save you it's
[58:11] got enough power in it to heal you if
[58:13] you receive John 3:16 it's got enough
[58:17] value to save the world now love is is
[58:21] is very
[58:22] descriptive now love has got two
[58:25] different meanings with two different
[58:26] words to describe it in the Greek One
[58:29] Love is called fio that is a natural
[58:32] love that you would have for your wife
[58:34] but agape love means divine love and
[58:37] these two loves are very contrary to
[58:40] each other for example with the love
[58:42] that you have for your wife he said if a
[58:44] man would insult her you would kill him
[58:47] on the spot that would be filio love but
[58:51] with agap love or Divine love you would
[58:53] pray for the man's lost soul how many
[58:56] needs a little bit more of love in
[58:58] their
[58:59] life he said that is the difference he
[59:01] said I'm almost sure that many of us
[59:03] have been deceived with fio love and
[59:06] thinking it was agape love fio love is
[59:09] an intellectual whereas Agape comes
[59:12] agape love comes from the heart human
[59:15] love or affectionate love is from the
[59:17] mind the love of God is from the heart
[59:20] now felo love will always doubt and
[59:24] question it's a amazing when you begin
[59:27] to study these things out that you'll
[59:29] find what kind of faith and love how
[59:31] that they are intertwined together that
[59:34] felo love will always doubt and will
[59:37] always question but agape love will
[59:40] always rest and be in PE in peace human
[59:43] love is always reasoning but Godly love
[59:47] never does so if you're constantly
[59:50] reasoning about the word of God it shows
[59:52] what kind of love that you have in your
[59:55] heart but but if you have a kind of love
[59:58] if you have that kind of faith that
[1:00:00] Godly love is Perhaps Perhaps in its
[1:00:04] trust it produces faith when you really
[1:00:07] love with God's kind of love fear is to
[1:00:12] distrust
[1:00:14] God that's what fear is fear is
[1:00:17] constantly wondering wondering or
[1:00:19] putting and reasoning things in your
[1:00:21] mind if am I going to get well am I
[1:00:24] going what fear does it paralyzes you so
[1:00:27] that you can't operate in perfect love
[1:00:30] but perfect love cast out fear now
[1:00:34] notice that when Jesus comes down to
[1:00:37] John Chapter 13 I'm just going to lay
[1:00:39] some foundational things here tonight
[1:00:41] that when Jesus comes down here in John
[1:00:44] Chapter 13 and he starts coming in there
[1:00:47] and he's getting ready to take them into
[1:00:49] things that are to be that Jesus begins
[1:00:52] to lace this commandment of love right
[1:00:55] there in in in in the chapter of verse
[1:00:58] chapter 13 but notice when he begins to
[1:01:01] express he begins to express the this
[1:01:05] new commandment it is after he exposes
[1:01:08] his Judas
[1:01:10] betrayal notice what he says here in
[1:01:13] verse 33 little
[1:01:15] children now ain't nobody understands
[1:01:18] love like a little
[1:01:20] child you can take little Uriah right
[1:01:23] there or you could take little aah or
[1:01:25] any of these little children and they
[1:01:27] can there there's nothing like the love
[1:01:29] of a child because you could take
[1:01:31] yourself and you put yourself in the
[1:01:33] picture and they won't look at you the
[1:01:35] same way that they look at brother
[1:01:37] Gabriel or Sister Sarah it's because
[1:01:39] something is different you might hold
[1:01:41] them the same way that they do you might
[1:01:43] you might handle them the same way that
[1:01:45] they do but it's something that they are
[1:01:47] connected but notice how that the Lord
[1:01:50] identifies a little child in this
[1:01:53] picture of love it's because a child
[1:01:56] implies great tenderness and
[1:01:59] affection the little children yet a
[1:02:01] little while and I'm with you and you
[1:02:03] shall seek me as I had said unto the
[1:02:05] Jews whether I go you cannot come so now
[1:02:07] I say to you a new commandment the 11th
[1:02:11] commandment a new commandment I give
[1:02:13] unto you that you love one
[1:02:17] another as I have loved you and that you
[1:02:20] also love one another by this you shall
[1:02:24] know that all men that all men know by
[1:02:27] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:02:29] disciples if you have love of one
[1:02:34] another not by you going out and
[1:02:36] speaking a storm out of existence not by
[1:02:39] you going out and creating squirrels not
[1:02:41] by you going out and moving mountains by
[1:02:44] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:02:48] disciples when you have
[1:02:51] love one to
[1:02:54] another I tell you one thing thing that
[1:02:56] this age is lacking is love and it's not
[1:03:00] the kind of love that the world is
[1:03:01] trying to produce but it's the very love
[1:03:04] of almighty God that this world is
[1:03:07] lacking what is it it's lacking love for
[1:03:10] the
[1:03:11] word I tell you your love I'll tell you
[1:03:14] what Jesus is saying here he's saying
[1:03:16] Your Love would look like my love by
[1:03:19] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:03:22] disciples that you follow me is that
[1:03:24] when you have love
[1:03:26] one towards another it's not a worldly
[1:03:28] love that looks like look like Le osa's
[1:03:31] love I know a lot of people got their
[1:03:33] ideas of what love is or what men think
[1:03:35] love is or or what they think the love
[1:03:37] of God is but God is perfect his life is
[1:03:41] perfect his word is perfect the holy
[1:03:43] spirit is perfect and even men amongst
[1:03:46] the message have tried to take what
[1:03:48] brother randam said there in in stat of
[1:03:50] a perfect man and isolated down into a
[1:03:53] thought of what they think that perfect
[1:03:55] love is and they build it up so that a
[1:03:57] man cannot attain power he cannot attain
[1:04:00] he cannot attain full truth it's because
[1:04:03] it's because men have taken away what
[1:04:06] love truly
[1:04:08] is is that right that one day will be
[1:04:12] perfect that one day will receive
[1:04:14] perfect love and that one day will'll be
[1:04:17] able to keep all of these promises what
[1:04:19] are they doing they're trying to keep
[1:04:20] the promises of God at a distance trying
[1:04:23] to show that it's one day in the future
[1:04:25] that that it's one day out there what
[1:04:27] are they doing they're trying to keep
[1:04:29] the very power of God away from the
[1:04:32] Church of the Living God because brother
[1:04:35] random said in a statue of a perfect man
[1:04:37] he said notice notice the prophet would
[1:04:39] progress but many people stop at the
[1:04:42] Statue of a perfect man and don't go all
[1:04:44] the way down through the seals notice he
[1:04:47] says he said the next thing is to add
[1:04:50] charity after brotherly kindness he said
[1:04:52] which is love he said that's the capping
[1:04:55] Stone one of these days in the church
[1:04:58] but notice what brother random goes on
[1:05:00] to say in paragraph 344 he said but when
[1:05:03] we not in an imaginary way but portrayed
[1:05:06] ourselves before a living God in a
[1:05:08] living virtue a living knowledge a
[1:05:10] living patience a living godliness a
[1:05:13] living power coming from a living God
[1:05:16] making a living man Liv in image the
[1:05:19] stature of God so what is when Peter is
[1:05:23] preaching these things add to your faith
[1:05:25] virtue out of your virtue knowledge out
[1:05:27] of your knowledge Temperance and
[1:05:28] patience brotherly kindness now it's not
[1:05:32] works love is not works I do not work
[1:05:37] myself way my work my way up so that my
[1:05:40] wife loves me she loves me you are never
[1:05:44] going to work your way up by doing good
[1:05:47] deeds to people so that God loves you
[1:05:50] the reason why God loves you is because
[1:05:52] he elected you before the foundation of
[1:05:55] the world
[1:05:57] he said the same thing that Jesus did
[1:06:00] walking the same way that he walked
[1:06:02] doing the same thing that he did because
[1:06:04] it's not an imaginary thing these are
[1:06:07] not just these are not just attributes
[1:06:10] these are not just works but it's a
[1:06:12] reality that proves because when brother
[1:06:14] brandham comes on the back side of the
[1:06:16] seals and he preaches the token life he
[1:06:20] said when you come back and he said
[1:06:21] watch what's come after them Seven Seals
[1:06:24] he said it's the uniting of the people
[1:06:26] United signs the red lights flashing in
[1:06:28] the last days he said the sign of women
[1:06:30] getting prettier and Men what would they
[1:06:33] do he said now all of these signs of the
[1:06:35] Holy Spirit leading then can come right
[1:06:38] back up to the capping off of all of the
[1:06:42] messages since the Seven Seals he said
[1:06:45] it's capped off in this one thing the
[1:06:48] token there is the capping Stone well
[1:06:52] brother Andrew one of these days we'll
[1:06:54] have perfect love
[1:06:56] brother bandam said it's going to take
[1:06:58] perfect love to get in there because
[1:06:59] that's the only thing that was there is
[1:07:02] perfect love now if it's going to take
[1:07:04] perfect love to get in there surely
[1:07:06] we've got to be able to attain perfect
[1:07:09] love it's not something out there in the
[1:07:11] future the token is the capping Ministry
[1:07:16] of the message the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:19] Ghost is your adoption robe it is your
[1:07:22] Abstract title deed that's why Paul
[1:07:24] would say in r Romans chapter 8 it is
[1:07:27] your adoption message there is therefore
[1:07:30] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:07:33] Christ Jesus who walked not after the
[1:07:35] flesh but after the spirit there it is
[1:07:39] church what shall we say to these things
[1:07:42] if God be for us if God be in us then
[1:07:46] who can be against us nay and all these
[1:07:49] things we are more than conquerors
[1:07:51] through him that loved us for I am
[1:07:55] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:07:57] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:08:00] nor things present nor things to come
[1:08:02] nor height nor death nor any other
[1:08:05] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:08:09] from the
[1:08:10] love of
[1:08:13] God how can you
[1:08:17] separate ah I'm trying I'm trying to be
[1:08:20] my best here but how can you separate me
[1:08:23] from the message how can you separate
[1:08:26] the messenger from the message how can
[1:08:29] you separate me from Christ in all of
[1:08:32] these things in trials in heartaches in
[1:08:37] heart attacks in
[1:08:39] cancer in Demon oppression in Demon
[1:08:42] depression in all of these things
[1:08:46] nothing shall be able to separate
[1:08:50] us from the
[1:08:54] love not of humanity but the love of
[1:08:58] God now notice when brother bandam comes
[1:09:02] and I'm just laying some things out and
[1:09:03] if you want any of these notes here
[1:09:05] tonight I'll give them all to you I got
[1:09:07] 30 pages and I ain't going to preach
[1:09:08] them to you all tonight but I'm going to
[1:09:10] get to some spots and I want to I want
[1:09:12] you to just lay these things in there so
[1:09:13] if you want them I'll give them to you
[1:09:15] I'll give them to the brothers and they
[1:09:16] can give it to you but brother brandom
[1:09:18] said in a th TI in church ches he said
[1:09:20] yes sir if you're a Christian you're
[1:09:22] going to do what's
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:27] that's pretty powerful ain't it if
[1:09:29] you're a Christian you're going to do
[1:09:30] what's right well brother Andrew do I
[1:09:31] got to do this if you're a Christian
[1:09:33] you're going to do what's right I got
[1:09:35] people come to me and say well I got I
[1:09:37] ain't done this right I ain't done that
[1:09:38] if you're a Christian you're going to do
[1:09:40] what's
[1:09:41] right well I I I wouldn't I I would and
[1:09:44] did this wrong thing if you're a
[1:09:45] Christian you're going to do what's
[1:09:47] right I don't know how to make it more
[1:09:49] simple than that if you're a Christian
[1:09:51] you're going to do what's
[1:09:52] right look at your neighbor say if
[1:09:54] you're a Christian
[1:09:56] you're going to do what's right your
[1:09:58] Works will show that your heart is right
[1:10:01] and it won't be something that you put
[1:10:02] on for you will do his will when no one
[1:10:06] but God sees you and you will do his
[1:10:09] will even if it cost you your
[1:10:13] life I know your love notice he he he
[1:10:16] pulls from second Timothy he said I know
[1:10:18] your love your service faith and
[1:10:19] patience he said you will note that
[1:10:22] their love is placed between works and
[1:10:24] service and that is the right place for
[1:10:27] it because without love our works are
[1:10:29] not accepted before God and neither is
[1:10:31] our service Paul speaking to the
[1:10:33] Corinthians said without love I am
[1:10:35] nothing and whatever I do is without
[1:10:37] profit unless it is done in
[1:10:41] love now you can see right here that
[1:10:44] these Believers weren't in that nickel
[1:10:49] ladyann or to be admired by men they did
[1:10:53] their works out of the love of God that
[1:10:57] was shed abroad in their hearts by the
[1:10:59] holy ghost that love in their hearts was
[1:11:03] God's Own love for his own Jesus said by
[1:11:06] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:11:09] disciples that you have a love for one
[1:11:12] another notice what he says he said the
[1:11:15] pagans who sold the lives of the early
[1:11:18] Christians said
[1:11:21] behold how they love each
[1:11:24] other
[1:11:28] amen behold how they love each other
[1:11:32] well you don't know I look that person
[1:11:33] up on Facebook and I know their
[1:11:36] backdrop behold how they love one
[1:11:42] another well brother Andrew if You' had
[1:11:45] Facebook this week if you'd have seen
[1:11:47] what I seen you wouldn't have that kind
[1:11:49] of love towards him behold how they love
[1:11:54] one another
[1:11:56] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:11:59] my disciples when you have
[1:12:02] love not when they make a mistake not
[1:12:05] when they fall but when you love them
[1:12:10] when they shouldn't receive
[1:12:13] love what kind of love are you talking
[1:12:15] about I'm talking about the Father's
[1:12:19] Love if you love somebody when they done
[1:12:22] you wrong it's proof that that ain't
[1:12:25] your love that's the Father's
[1:12:30] Love
[1:12:32] Hallelujah Matthew 22 and 36 when a
[1:12:35] lawyer came to him and said Master what
[1:12:38] is the great commandment in the law
[1:12:40] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[1:12:42] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[1:12:44] thy soul with all thy mind this is the
[1:12:47] first and great commandment and the
[1:12:50] second is lik unto it Thou shalt love
[1:12:53] thy neighbor as thyself under these two
[1:12:56] Commandments hang all the law and the
[1:13:00] prophets now Jesus emphasizes the power
[1:13:03] of this commandment is to love thy
[1:13:06] neighbor as thyself when all of Israel
[1:13:10] is not just given 10 commandments
[1:13:12] they're given
[1:13:14] 613
[1:13:17] Commandments they couldn't keep them
[1:13:20] they couldn't live up to it but Jesus
[1:13:22] summarized all of the six 63 laws that
[1:13:27] was given to them in these two
[1:13:29] Commandments the Lord love the Lord with
[1:13:32] all our heart with all thy soul and with
[1:13:34] all thy might and to love thy neighbor
[1:13:38] as
[1:13:39] thyself what does that mean brother
[1:13:41] Andrew that means that you love yourself
[1:13:44] more than anybody else in this
[1:13:46] building you watch a fire break out in
[1:13:48] this building you might love the people
[1:13:51] right beside you with a filo love but
[1:13:53] Who you gonna get out first number one
[1:13:58] baby well not me brother Andrew I'd be
[1:14:00] right here to the very end I'd stand
[1:14:02] there in the smoke right near
[1:14:04] fire that's pretty impressive you must
[1:14:07] have that son of man kind of fire about
[1:14:10] you that you can stand right there in
[1:14:11] the midst of it you love yourself more
[1:14:13] than anybody
[1:14:16] else who'd you dress this morning who'd
[1:14:19] you feed this morning who is the very
[1:14:21] first one you got coffee for you or your
[1:14:24] neighbor
[1:14:33] Hallelujah thou shallal love the Lord
[1:14:35] thy God with all thy heart with all thy
[1:14:37] soul with all thy
[1:14:38] might because if you love
[1:14:41] God you love
[1:14:45] others is that right brother random
[1:14:48] would say it like this and I completely
[1:14:49] agree he said if you want to do
[1:14:50] something nice for me he said do it to
[1:14:52] my
[1:14:54] children don't do something for nice for
[1:14:56] me I tell you right now biggest fight
[1:14:58] you ever going to get in with me you can
[1:15:00] say anything you want to about me but
[1:15:01] don't you dare say nothing about my
[1:15:03] children or my
[1:15:07] parents you want to do something nice
[1:15:09] for me do something nice for my
[1:15:12] children let me move on he said now when
[1:15:14] you say you go to church and you do good
[1:15:17] things that's fine but when you live
[1:15:19] your life to yourself you haven't
[1:15:22] eternal
[1:15:23] life
[1:15:26] wow when you live your life for yourself
[1:15:29] you don't have eternal life when you
[1:15:32] look about upon this age that it's
[1:15:34] exactly what what what what we read in
[1:15:38] the what happened in heaven that Lucifer
[1:15:40] was all about I lifting myself I I I I I
[1:15:44] this is the age of I of people's rights
[1:15:48] but if you live your life to yourself
[1:15:51] you haven't got eternal life eternal
[1:15:54] life is living for others it proved it
[1:15:58] when it come into the Lamb of God he
[1:15:59] lived he had eternal life because he did
[1:16:02] not live for himself he lived for others
[1:16:05] and you receive eternal life by
[1:16:07] receiving that day that that you don't
[1:16:10] live for yourself no more you live for
[1:16:13] others someone said how can you stand
[1:16:16] and any let anybody call you such bad
[1:16:18] names you don't live for yourself you
[1:16:21] live for others that you might redeem
[1:16:23] that man he he said you become Sons he
[1:16:26] said and the trouble of it is the church
[1:16:28] has forgot that they were Sons you're
[1:16:31] Sons you're taking Christ Place your
[1:16:34] sons so don't live for
[1:16:38] yourself live for
[1:16:40] others well what's it all about what's
[1:16:43] the message about live for others one of
[1:16:46] the most powerful things about the Holy
[1:16:49] Ghost is when you experience it for
[1:16:52] yourself it's about passing it on to
[1:16:55] somebody
[1:16:57] else you watch any of these young people
[1:17:00] you watch any of them they received the
[1:17:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost what's the
[1:17:04] first thing that they want to do they
[1:17:05] want to testify about it but we live in
[1:17:09] an age where men want to squash out
[1:17:11] living for others and silence our voices
[1:17:14] so that we don't testify about how great
[1:17:17] the love of God is well let me testify
[1:17:20] right now that if he loved me when I was
[1:17:24] unlovable
[1:17:25] and when you is
[1:17:27] unlovable then he's got enough love left
[1:17:30] in his bank to redeem
[1:17:40] Humanity let's get into a sticky
[1:17:43] situation well brother brandham I can
[1:17:46] live for this brother because he sure is
[1:17:48] a nice
[1:17:51] man that's not it live for the that man
[1:17:56] who hates you live for that person who'd
[1:17:59] kill you if they could that's what they'
[1:18:02] done to him they killed him and he died
[1:18:05] that he might save them that's eternal
[1:18:09] life when you get that in your bosom
[1:18:14] you're facing heaven
[1:18:17] then you're facing heaven then but you
[1:18:20] sacrifice your own things and give them
[1:18:22] up like a little sheep gives up its wo
[1:18:24] you look on towards Calvary what are you
[1:18:27] talking about brother Andrew I'm talking
[1:18:29] about the kind of love that when brother
[1:18:31] bandam is standing down there in Mexico
[1:18:33] and that blind man is standing there and
[1:18:35] he's he's a old daddy and brother B said
[1:18:37] my heart just went out for him he said
[1:18:40] we done watch that little baby that had
[1:18:42] been dead for 10 hours how that that
[1:18:44] mother had that kind of a love that she
[1:18:47] wouldn't bury that baby she loved that
[1:18:50] baby and she took that baby through the
[1:18:52] waters through the rain stood at there
[1:18:55] it was a mother's love that was
[1:18:58] projected that produced Sovereign grace
[1:19:01] that brought her baby back that kind of
[1:19:05] love is a goap love It's Supernatural
[1:19:09] love brother brandham stood there he
[1:19:12] said I looked on that old blind man he
[1:19:15] said I looked at him and he said he said
[1:19:19] the greatest success of any prayer is
[1:19:22] being able to put yourself in that
[1:19:25] person's burden he said so I literally
[1:19:28] put myself in his shoes and said father
[1:19:33] bless this old blind daddy surely he's
[1:19:35] got babies back there surely he's got
[1:19:37] grandchildren surely he's got work to do
[1:19:40] he said and when I put myself in his
[1:19:43] shoes when I got into such a spot of
[1:19:47] sympathy he said then I heard him sing
[1:19:50] out shout out Glory
[1:19:52] because what
[1:19:56] love was
[1:19:58] projected love was projected what was it
[1:20:02] it was a surge of love that went through
[1:20:03] him what was it that that David's Mighty
[1:20:06] Men all of
[1:20:09] them David's an outcast David's hiding
[1:20:12] in the hiding in the cave but what made
[1:20:15] them stick with him
[1:20:18] love love made him do that when Saul was
[1:20:21] hunting him out love made him stay with
[1:20:23] him because they saw something on
[1:20:26] David's life that sa didn't
[1:20:30] have that's powerful when you're hiding
[1:20:33] in a
[1:20:34] cave and you so love God when you so
[1:20:40] love God you care about you care more
[1:20:44] about the kingdom of God than your
[1:20:46] circumstances that you're
[1:20:49] in that's we're overcoming is we you can
[1:20:52] look into a cave and you can still see
[1:20:54] that you're right in purpose it's like
[1:20:57] David David so loved God he so loved God
[1:21:02] that he was not going to allow Goliath
[1:21:04] to stand there and defile the name of
[1:21:06] the almighty God so he shut up a Goliath
[1:21:09] he so loved those sheep that he went
[1:21:11] after the bear and he went after the
[1:21:13] lion why because he had
[1:21:16] love notice in Romans 13 and8 oh no man
[1:21:21] anything but to love one another for he
[1:21:24] that loveth another hath fulfilled the
[1:21:28] law for this Thou shalt not commit
[1:21:31] adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt
[1:21:33] not steal Thou shalt not bear false
[1:21:35] witness Thou shalt not covet if there be
[1:21:38] any other commandment it is briefly
[1:21:40] comprehended in this saying namely Thou
[1:21:42] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love
[1:21:47] worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore
[1:21:51] love is the
[1:21:53] fulfilling of the
[1:21:56] law I know what the world's done I know
[1:21:59] what the world's done they've taken
[1:22:01] they've taken the power of these
[1:22:02] scriptures right here and they watered
[1:22:03] it down and tried to make the word of
[1:22:04] God to fit their
[1:22:06] agenda you just go reading some of their
[1:22:09] of their pages and you begin to read
[1:22:11] some of their you begin to read some of
[1:22:12] their thoughts and man it looks exactly
[1:22:15] like the scripture you go to reading
[1:22:17] first John 4 and I'm going to give you
[1:22:19] some homework go read first John 4 all
[1:22:21] on your own maybe labor in some some of
[1:22:23] those salts here but you'll find that
[1:22:26] that this age says that we
[1:22:30] love because he first loved
[1:22:33] us that's what they
[1:22:35] say well that that it's really it's
[1:22:37] really something it's really something
[1:22:40] but they left out one key part we love
[1:22:43] him because he first loved us the kind
[1:22:47] of love that LE utsy is producing is not
[1:22:50] the kind of love that God is I was
[1:22:53] standing in Disney World not too long
[1:22:54] ago at Christmas time and I thought it
[1:22:56] pretty pretty Supernatural that there we
[1:22:59] were standing in Disney World one of one
[1:23:01] of the most I'll tell you what it takes
[1:23:04] a love of God to be able to go down
[1:23:05] there and actually live
[1:23:07] right and I ain't talking about cotton
[1:23:09] candy and all them waffles or anything
[1:23:11] like
[1:23:11] that but Sodom is right there in your
[1:23:14] face but here they were they they
[1:23:16] actually had something pretty profound
[1:23:18] they had a they had a a uh I had at a
[1:23:21] concert deal where they was putting on
[1:23:23] they was B basically telling the birth
[1:23:25] of Christ and they were telling all I
[1:23:27] thought man that's pretty powerful right
[1:23:28] here in Disney World when he got Sodom
[1:23:29] all around but the picture they were
[1:23:32] painting is that the power of the story
[1:23:35] is
[1:23:36] love they didn't point one thing to
[1:23:39] Jesus they didn't put one thing on
[1:23:41] Christ and that's the kind of love that
[1:23:44] New York wants that New Jersey wants
[1:23:46] that Texas wants that California wants
[1:23:50] that kind of love is
[1:23:52] psychology that kind of love is is is
[1:23:54] knowledge but the love of God is Not
[1:23:57] psychology the love of God is Not
[1:23:59] knowledge the love of God is not some
[1:24:01] mental workup the love of God is power
[1:24:04] the love of God is Jesus the love of God
[1:24:06] is truth the love of God is life the
[1:24:08] love of God is
[1:24:10] corrective the love of God is
[1:24:13] pure the love of
[1:24:18] God love is when you see your child out
[1:24:22] there in the street brother Brandon
[1:24:24] would say
[1:24:25] and you got enough love about yourself
[1:24:27] to go out there and get him out the
[1:24:29] street but the kind of love that lay OS
[1:24:32] see is wanting to produce is Johnny
[1:24:35] you're okay out there you'll get up out
[1:24:37] of that mess one of these days you'll
[1:24:38] figure it out on your own you'll be okay
[1:24:40] that's
[1:24:41] psychology that's knowledge that's
[1:24:44] that's putting that's putting something
[1:24:45] over that's putting something over on a
[1:24:47] child that a child ain't
[1:24:50] got well we just love our children
[1:24:53] brother aners so we got to give them
[1:24:55] anything and
[1:24:57] everything that ain't love
[1:24:59] baby love is a protective kind of love
[1:25:04] love will protect you from sin love will
[1:25:07] protect you from change love will
[1:25:09] protect you from depression
[1:25:12] love and parent it's our duty to love
[1:25:16] our children with a corrective kind of
[1:25:23] love
[1:25:28] I sure loved a rid Rider BB
[1:25:31] gun I sure did I killed myself a lot of
[1:25:35] Indians with that
[1:25:36] thing but it was real love when my daddy
[1:25:40] saw me going to the gun cabinet trying
[1:25:42] to get a 30 out 6 when I was 6 years
[1:25:48] old not
[1:25:50] today a day will come for that but today
[1:25:53] is not that day
[1:25:55] but the kind of love that LE ought to
[1:25:56] see said well just give it to
[1:25:59] him and you think why we got the mess
[1:26:02] that we're in let me preach let me

[1:28:31] love Susi well some of y'all ain't never
[1:28:33] watched I love Susi and some of his kids
[1:28:34] don't even know what it is but they'll
[1:28:37] sure stay home to watch a ball game and
[1:28:40] to stay home and to look at all kinds of
[1:28:43] evil manner
[1:28:46] things I don't know about this brother
[1:28:48] Andrew it's getting too hot and heavy
[1:28:49] for
[1:28:50] me
[1:28:52] rejoiceth at truth
[1:28:56] what verse we on six man we got a long
[1:28:58] way to
[1:29:00] go beareth all things believeth all
[1:29:03] things hopeth all things endureth all
[1:29:06] things
[1:29:09] charity never
[1:29:12] fails love conquers all but whether they
[1:29:16] be prophecies they shall fall whether
[1:29:19] they be tongues they shall cease whether
[1:29:22] they be knowledge it shall fish away for
[1:29:24] we know in part and we prophesy in part
[1:29:27] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:29:30] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:29:32] away when I was a child I spake as a
[1:29:33] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:29:36] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:29:39] away childish
[1:29:42] things well brother Andrew we see right
[1:29:45] here that when perfect love comes that
[1:29:48] all this speaking in tongues and
[1:29:49] shoutings and physical workings that'll
[1:29:52] be done away with we'll move on to
[1:29:53] maturity
[1:29:58] now God wants us to have a heart God
[1:30:01] wants us to have tenderness of a child
[1:30:04] but not to be
[1:30:07] childish there's a major difference
[1:30:09] between being childlike and being
[1:30:12] childish and to sit there and to think
[1:30:15] that when perfect love comes that all
[1:30:16] these things will be done away
[1:30:18] with here is childish I'll tell you what
[1:30:22] you got on you you got your when I'm
[1:30:24] Alexander Campbell Church of Christ
[1:30:26] Spirit on you that's a Church of Christ
[1:30:29] idea that would sit there and say now
[1:30:31] when perfect love has come we'll do away
[1:30:34] with those things let me tell you we
[1:30:36] ain't perfect
[1:30:40] yet we have a portion of perfect love
[1:30:44] but we are not in a perfect body but
[1:30:46] when we get to heaven we're not going to
[1:30:49] need to speak in tongues and to prophesy
[1:30:52] and to lay hands on the sick and to see
[1:30:54] them recover when that which is perfect
[1:30:57] is come then that which is in part will
[1:31:00] be done away with we still need
[1:31:04] prophesying we still need speaking in
[1:31:06] tongues we still need the gifts of the
[1:31:11] body and perfect love will put them
[1:31:15] perfectly in line in the bride's
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:22] body it's like brother R would talk
[1:31:24] about an apple tree he said it's like he
[1:31:27] said it's he said it's like an apple
[1:31:28] tree it's got all the attributes of the
[1:31:30] tree he said but you get out there and
[1:31:32] you start picking up the apples and you
[1:31:34] think you really got it but you don't
[1:31:36] have the tree yet he said the
[1:31:38] Pentecostal Sky he said it's it's the
[1:31:41] Pentecostal skies are loaded right now
[1:31:43] he said but Pentecost is an experience
[1:31:46] that constrains you to the love of God
[1:31:49] he said all of these things he said
[1:31:51] they're attributes he said it's apples
[1:31:53] on a tree that fall off the tree he said
[1:31:55] but don't get the Apple before the tree
[1:31:58] get the tree and you'll have the
[1:32:01] apples oh come on and preach with me
[1:32:04] brother Andrew I believe I will get a
[1:32:08] hold of the tree of life and you'll have
[1:32:10] the fruits of the
[1:32:14] spirit well brother Andrew we got to
[1:32:16] work our way through faith we got to
[1:32:18] work our way up through sanctification
[1:32:19] we got to work our way through up
[1:32:21] through justification sanctification
[1:32:23] restoring of the gifts and finally that
[1:32:24] we'll get there one day that we'll
[1:32:26] receive our adoption robes you're
[1:32:28] absolutely wrong when you receive the
[1:32:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost as a Son of
[1:32:34] God it is your adoptive robe right there
[1:32:37] to operate as a
[1:32:40] son and when you have the Holy Ghost not
[1:32:43] something on the Motions not something
[1:32:45] on the flesh but on your soul as a Son
[1:32:49] of
[1:32:50] God you have
[1:32:52] love
[1:32:57] I'll tell you how powerful The Love
[1:33:03] Is Love is a very powerful thing is very
[1:33:06] powerful Philo love is a very powerful
[1:33:08] thing I tell you how powerful love is
[1:33:10] that brother brandom actually thought
[1:33:14] that love was the evidence of the Holy
[1:33:17] Ghost it's how powerful that it is
[1:33:20] because when brother brandham is sitting
[1:33:22] down with brother lale and he ask him
[1:33:24] said now brother Bram what is the
[1:33:26] evidence of the Holy Ghost he said well
[1:33:29] I can't say it's the evidence he said I
[1:33:30] can't see the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:32] of speaking in tongues he said I can't
[1:33:33] see that he said well I can't see that
[1:33:36] either he said then I would have to say
[1:33:39] that love is the evidence of the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost and while brother berham is
[1:33:43] sitting there talking the spirit of the
[1:33:45] Lord speaks to him and tells him that
[1:33:48] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being
[1:33:51] able to receive the word of
[1:33:55] God that's the evidence of the Holy
[1:33:59] Ghost you see you see we can have we can
[1:34:02] have the full train we can have the
[1:34:04] train setting out here on the tracks we
[1:34:06] can have the MOG mahogany floors we can
[1:34:08] have all the bells and whistles on it
[1:34:10] but if it ain't got no steam in it if it
[1:34:13] ain't got no power in it if it ain't got
[1:34:15] no love in it then it'll set right there
[1:34:17] dead as a doornail but if you can put
[1:34:20] love in there if you can put some
[1:34:22] bowling power of faith and love working
[1:34:25] together it'll boil the very sin right
[1:34:28] out of your
[1:34:30] life that's the kind of
[1:34:37] love I tell you how powerful Love
[1:34:41] Is Love covers a multitudes oh yeah of
[1:34:48] sins what is it that makes you forgive
[1:34:50] your brother what is it makes you
[1:34:52] overlook their weaknesses love makes you
[1:34:55] do
[1:34:56] that if you don't have that kind of love
[1:34:59] in your marriage your marriage is not
[1:35:01] going to last very long if you
[1:35:03] constantly stay there in your first year
[1:35:05] of marriage of bickering what kind of
[1:35:07] toothpaste that you're going to use and
[1:35:09] your toothbrush goes on the left side
[1:35:11] and hers goes on the right side you are
[1:35:13] going to live a miserable
[1:35:21] life if you ever learned to figure this
[1:35:23] out that when your wife is cooking for
[1:35:26] you and she makes you cornbread and she
[1:35:29] don't make it like your mama made
[1:35:31] it and all of a sudden you say what you
[1:35:35] put in
[1:35:37] there that ain't like Mama fixed it you
[1:35:40] going to live a miserable
[1:35:45] life one of our Elder deons deacons here
[1:35:48] taught me that very early in my marriage
[1:35:51] don't say what I
[1:35:52] said it'll get you in trouble because if
[1:35:55] you don't figure out how to say the
[1:35:58] right things and how to let things
[1:36:02] go anybody can sit there and argue to
[1:36:04] they're mad and the blue in the
[1:36:06] face but it takes a real
[1:36:10] man a real
[1:36:14] man
[1:36:15] man real
[1:36:22] man I I I I'm
[1:36:26] sorry I really don't think you meant
[1:36:29] it how you
[1:36:32] know cuz your actions are speaking
[1:36:35] different than your
[1:36:39] words you remember when brother Brandon
[1:36:41] was there in the home and sister m is
[1:36:43] all stewed up and
[1:36:45] everything brother brand said I had to
[1:36:47] change the atmosphere the kids ain't got
[1:36:50] nothing to eat and everything else
[1:36:51] everything's hot and bothered and she
[1:36:52] goes in through there build the kids
[1:36:54] I've had so many people running through
[1:36:56] here and so many people coming in for
[1:36:57] prayer and she was so worked up another
[1:37:00] man said I simply went in there and I
[1:37:03] started saying little little little
[1:37:05] things to her he said I started changing
[1:37:07] the atmosphere how in the world am I
[1:37:08] here and I start changing the atmosphere
[1:37:12] and saying the right kind of things love
[1:37:15] covers a multitude of sin Jesus said in
[1:37:19] John 14 if you love me keep my
[1:37:22] Commandments verse 23 said if a man
[1:37:25] loved me he will keep my words so you
[1:37:28] could not love him in your natural birth
[1:37:32] you couldn't keep his word in your
[1:37:33] natural birth you couldn't love him in
[1:37:36] your natural birth there was something
[1:37:38] on the inside of you that draw you to
[1:37:41] him but you kept breaking his word but
[1:37:45] when you were born
[1:37:47] again when you were born from another
[1:37:49] realm you could really love him and love
[1:37:52] his word
[1:37:56] notice 1 John 4 and 8 he that loveth not
[1:38:01] knoweth not God for God is love and in
[1:38:06] this was manifested the love of God
[1:38:08] towards us because they God sent his
[1:38:10] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:38:13] might live through him herein is love
[1:38:16] not that we love God but that he loved
[1:38:18] us and sent us his son to be the
[1:38:21] priation for our sins verse 12 no man ha
[1:38:25] seen God at any time if we love one
[1:38:28] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[1:38:31] is perfected in US hereby know we know
[1:38:35] we that we dwell in him and he in us
[1:38:38] because he giveth us of his Spirit Verse
[1:38:41] 18 there is no fear in
[1:38:47] love if you fall you're not
[1:38:52] afraid
[1:38:54] that's perfect
[1:38:56] love perfect love is when you fall
[1:38:59] you're not afraid he's going to cast you
[1:39:01] away You're a part of
[1:39:03] him but love will make you go to him and
[1:39:09] repent oh my there is no fear in love
[1:39:13] but perfect love cast out fear because
[1:39:16] fear hath torment he that fearth is not
[1:39:19] made perfect in love we love him because
[1:39:23] he first loved
[1:39:25] us let me ask you a question what makes
[1:39:29] you long and live for this
[1:39:32] message really what what makes you
[1:39:35] what's so different about you than all
[1:39:38] these other people that walk past these
[1:39:40] streets go past this road go past this
[1:39:41] sign looked at these same books looked
[1:39:44] at these same pictures heard the same
[1:39:46] stories what makes you love this message
[1:39:50] like you
[1:39:52] do
[1:39:56] other people heard it other people's
[1:39:58] looked at it other people stood there
[1:40:00] but what makes you love him the way you
[1:40:04] do it's because he loved you first we
[1:40:07] love him because he first loved us we
[1:40:11] love this message because this message
[1:40:13] first loved us so he changed us to match
[1:40:17] his kind of
[1:40:19] love Esau Esau looked like the right
[1:40:22] kind of man man and Jacob didn't but
[1:40:26] Jacob had the heart of the father so he
[1:40:30] Chang Jacob's name to match the
[1:40:34] character that was on the inside of him
[1:40:37] look at Abraham he couldn't produce what
[1:40:40] he was to produce as the name of Abram
[1:40:42] so God changed his name to Abraham to
[1:40:46] match the character of what was on the
[1:40:48] inside of
[1:40:50] him oh come on that's why chain saw PA's
[1:40:53] name to Paul was because he had to put
[1:40:56] he had a character on the inside of him
[1:40:58] that was not matching up with the name
[1:41:01] that he was currently in so he changed
[1:41:04] his name and before you ever heard your
[1:41:07] name called I'm preaching before you
[1:41:10] ever heard your name called you had the
[1:41:12] character of a bride on the inside of
[1:41:15] you so he changed your name and he don't
[1:41:18] call you Church no more he called you
[1:41:20] bride because you got the bride kind of
[1:41:22] a love
[1:41:24] oh blessed be the name of the Lord they
[1:41:26] can have it they can look like it but
[1:41:29] your name matches the
[1:41:38] love what was it in that woman up there
[1:41:41] in John 4 what was it something was on
[1:41:44] the inside of
[1:41:46] her that made him draw towards her I
[1:41:50] want you to look at this and go to
[1:41:52] Genesis chap 24 and you look at these
[1:41:55] two women that are at a well when you
[1:41:57] look at Rebecca she's sitting there look
[1:41:59] what is the drawing attraction it's the
[1:42:01] whale it's deep and they're there for a
[1:42:04] purpose they're both thirsty they're
[1:42:07] both doing their jobs but they each meet
[1:42:09] a man at a wh where' he find you at is
[1:42:14] when you were thirsting for him he
[1:42:16] drawed you he called you he elected you
[1:42:20] you didn't come to God God came to you
[1:42:24] elaser tell me more about my Isaac tell
[1:42:28] me about him tell me how he loves me
[1:42:31] tell me what he done for me tell me how
[1:42:33] he died for me elaser tell me more tell
[1:42:37] me
[1:42:39] more one's a prostitute one's a virgin
[1:42:43] but the same caliber of a man is sitting
[1:42:46] at the well one with the power to change
[1:42:48] her from a prostitute to a
[1:42:51] virgin Hallelujah
[1:42:57] he saw something in that
[1:43:01] prostitute that drawed him to
[1:43:07] her Rebecca didn't even know what she
[1:43:09] was doing Whitney she had no idea what
[1:43:12] she was doing but she was literally
[1:43:15] matching the prayer of the Prophet
[1:43:19] messenger when she stepped out there and
[1:43:22] he said now
[1:43:24] Lord I want you to send me a virgin I
[1:43:27] want you to send me a woman that'll be
[1:43:30] that will match the caliber of My Father
[1:43:33] Abraham and he prays all of these
[1:43:36] prayers how did how did she match the
[1:43:40] vision of what elaser prayed it was
[1:43:43] because God had already saw
[1:43:46] her and he put the desire on the inside
[1:43:49] of William brandham to say the right
[1:43:51] kind of thing that would draw the right
[1:43:53] kind of a lady come on somebody if he
[1:43:56] was preaching Billy Graham or or Roberts
[1:43:58] he'd have called for money he'd have
[1:44:00] called for this he'd have called for
[1:44:02] thousands but he wasn't calling for them
[1:44:05] he was calling for a rainbow trout kind
[1:44:07] of people because you're that kind of a
[1:44:10] people you're a
[1:44:13] golden you're a golden age kind of
[1:44:15] people you're a golden age you're a
[1:44:18] covenant kind of
[1:44:19] people the messenger knew what he was
[1:44:22] called call in
[1:44:24] for Lord don't let her just water me but
[1:44:29] let her water the power that'll take her
[1:44:31] in a Rapture let her water it Lord and
[1:44:35] when she came there when she came there
[1:44:38] she said I'll he said will you draw me a
[1:44:40] little bit of water and when he Jesus is
[1:44:43] standing there and said will you give me
[1:44:45] something to drink watch what draw them
[1:44:49] together she said not only will I draw
[1:44:51] for you but I will draw for your 10
[1:44:58] cels it
[1:45:00] said that a Thirsty Camel that has went
[1:45:03] as far as these camels went can drink 30
[1:45:06] gallons of
[1:45:09] water 30 time 10 300 gallons of water
[1:45:13] the Well's deep but she's got something
[1:45:15] on the inside of her there's a
[1:45:17] supernatural strength when everybody
[1:45:19] else would have gave up Rebecca still
[1:45:21] whirling sir Rebecca she'll saying amen
[1:45:24] when everything ain't going right for
[1:45:25] her Rebecca standing there at the well
[1:45:27] because she knows there's a power she
[1:45:29] knows there's a power that will lead her
[1:45:31] to her Isaac and when everybody else is
[1:45:33] walking away and when nobody else is
[1:45:35] loving the word Rebecca's still pulling
[1:45:37] on that
[1:45:38] power she didn't know what she was doing
[1:45:41] but she was in love all that time
[1:45:45] Hallelujah and sometimes it don't make
[1:45:49] sense sometimes it don't make sense to
[1:45:52] be pers
[1:45:54] but love faileth
[1:45:56] not love don't give up love believes all
[1:46:00] things hopes in all things that's the
[1:46:03] kind of love that Rebecca
[1:46:12] had over 60
[1:46:15] trips dropping the bucket in and getting
[1:46:18] it back
[1:46:20] out do you have what it takes
[1:46:23] do you have what it takes to fight like
[1:46:26] David's Mighty Men when all hope is gone
[1:46:29] when everybody else is surrounding you
[1:46:31] and threatening your king do you have
[1:46:33] that kind of love for your king that
[1:46:36] you'll fight through 800 Philistines
[1:46:39] that you'll fight through 15 miles of
[1:46:42] philistine armies to bring him a fresh
[1:46:44] drink of Pentecostal water do you love
[1:46:47] him that much when your wife don't want
[1:46:50] to love him you still love him when your
[1:46:53] children Don't Want To Praise Him you
[1:46:55] still praise him do you love him that
[1:46:57] much when the doctors give up do you
[1:47:01] love him that
[1:47:09] much hallelujah what are you saying
[1:47:12] brother Andrew I'm saying that the 11th
[1:47:14] commandment is
[1:47:17] Supernatural what was it when that
[1:47:19] Maniac when that Maniac ran at him and
[1:47:22] all them preachers were
[1:47:24] fearful all of them was fearful some of
[1:47:27] them was calling for police officers he
[1:47:29] said but oh no this is a battle this is
[1:47:32] a spiritual
[1:47:34] warfare brother mam said I found this
[1:47:37] amazing brother Chris he said I didn't
[1:47:39] hate the
[1:47:40] man he said because it wasn't the man he
[1:47:43] said that man had a good family had a
[1:47:46] good home he said but it was the devil
[1:47:49] on the inside of that man that hated me
[1:47:53] he said so instead of hating him I loved
[1:48:01] him do you have the kind of love that
[1:48:04] you can walk past a homosexual spirit
[1:48:07] and love the person that it's on but
[1:48:09] hate the spirit that's behind
[1:48:12] it remember these people that come
[1:48:15] against this message these people that
[1:48:17] criticize truth these people that are
[1:48:19] filled with demon power they're people
[1:48:22] like you
[1:48:26] you I preach to me the message brother
[1:48:28] Andrew I am I'm preaching his hard as I
[1:48:31] can do you have that kind of
[1:48:36] love I'm going tell you right now it
[1:48:38] makes every red blooded male here when
[1:48:41] two men are sitting there kissing on
[1:48:42] each other make you sick to your
[1:48:45] stomach but you don't hate that
[1:48:50] man how about when you do with an
[1:48:53] atheist how about when you're dealing
[1:48:54] with a muhamad how about when you're
[1:48:56] dealing with a Buddhist do you have the
[1:48:59] kind of love of
[1:49:02] Jesus do you have that kind of love and
[1:49:04] said father forgive them for they know
[1:49:08] not what they
[1:49:12] do I didn't hate
[1:49:15] him I loved
[1:49:17] him that's the kind of love that God
[1:49:21] projects
[1:49:23] it takes a real man to handle rejection
[1:49:26] anybody can handle being
[1:49:28] accepted we got we got kids right here
[1:49:30] in this church that are literally right
[1:49:33] now being bullied in their in their
[1:49:34] school for for believing what you
[1:49:37] believe they're they're literally being
[1:49:39] pushed around for dressing holy for
[1:49:41] living holy and I commend these young
[1:49:43] people for standing up for what's right
[1:49:45] no matter if they bully you around or
[1:49:47] make fun of you God bless
[1:49:51] you
[1:49:55] ain't no child deserves to be
[1:49:58] rejected but it shows what value that
[1:50:01] you have when you can stand
[1:50:05] rejection he's telling the brothers in
[1:50:07] the
[1:50:08] back it's powerful how valuable that you
[1:50:12] are is that the the
[1:50:15] messenger literally stood the rejection
[1:50:18] of The ecumenical move and the church
[1:50:21] councils he allowed them to reject him
[1:50:26] when William brandham did nothing but
[1:50:28] love
[1:50:29] them that I'll tell you right now when
[1:50:31] you you start studying love you can
[1:50:35] match William brandom's life to
[1:50:41] love I don't care what critic you come
[1:50:43] up against there ain't
[1:50:46] nobody I'll be honest I'm still working
[1:50:48] on
[1:50:49] me we talking about it in the back that
[1:50:52] time that brother brother Brandon was
[1:50:54] standing out there and they the man
[1:50:56] calls him out comes out before and
[1:50:58] brother Brandon was supposed to preach
[1:51:00] and supposed to preach and the man gets
[1:51:02] up there and say well brother Brandon
[1:51:04] wasn't able to come brother Brandon
[1:51:05] standing right back there behind that
[1:51:07] curtain said brother brandham had some
[1:51:09] prior engagements and he wasn't able to
[1:51:10] come brother Bisal said i' have stepped
[1:51:12] right on out there
[1:51:14] brother brother Bram said oh I couldn't
[1:51:16] have done that brother Eddie brother Ed
[1:51:18] said that's right there right there when
[1:51:20] I figured out I was not called to be the
[1:51:22] prophet
[1:51:26] I'm going to tell you right now there's
[1:51:27] some things I'm still working on because
[1:51:29] I've been in fields when killer BS well
[1:51:31] I thought they was going to kill me
[1:51:32] anyway got out there and thought I was a
[1:51:35] Bronco and thought I'd be somebody cool
[1:51:37] and get out there with Popa Charlie's
[1:51:38] black anguses and meanor in a junkyard
[1:51:41] dog
[1:51:42] and cuz they had an infection in them
[1:51:44] they typically wasn't that way but man
[1:51:45] they got stinking
[1:51:47] mean Papa Charlie said oh he won't hurt
[1:51:49] you he won't hurt you that dude that
[1:51:51] dude stood up about broke that fence
[1:51:53] down me hit me right in the face don't
[1:51:55] tell me I still working on perfect love
[1:51:58] brother Jonathan I be honest I didn't
[1:52:01] love him right there that minute if IID
[1:52:02] had a pistol I'd probably shot
[1:52:09] him I'll be honest with you you won't
[1:52:12] ever make a God out of
[1:52:15] me I still got some things I got to work
[1:52:17] on my brother R said instead of hating
[1:52:20] that boy I love him instead of hating
[1:52:24] them Hornets I love
[1:52:28] them when them dudes buckle you up in
[1:52:31] the shoulder and roll you upside down a
[1:52:33] hill and you rolling down 48 48 pil of
[1:52:35] Road you don't feel like love right
[1:52:36] there at that
[1:52:37] moment that's power that's real power
[1:52:41] Powerful Love is that when you can stand
[1:52:44] there and say forgive me I didn't mean
[1:52:47] to disturb your nest just going back
[1:52:51] here there's some things we still going
[1:52:53] to work on brother Chester we're going
[1:52:55] to work on that he's still
[1:52:59] working but to think that the prophet
[1:53:03] literally showed the love of God that he
[1:53:06] would allow the church world to reject
[1:53:10] him to show the love that God has for
[1:53:14] you because the Sheep had to pull away
[1:53:17] from the genuine seat the shuck had to
[1:53:20] pull away from it because God had to
[1:53:24] allow the rejection to prove his
[1:53:27] exception of
[1:53:30] you let me let me go on down
[1:53:33] here I'm closing musicians
[1:53:37] come God said in Isaiah 49:15 can a
[1:53:41] woman forget her suckling child that she
[1:53:43] shall not have compassion on the son of
[1:53:45] her womb yay they may
[1:53:49] forget yet I will not forget
[1:53:54] you that's love love produces Faith love
[1:53:58] produces confidence it don't
[1:54:01] have it ain't got fear in it notice what
[1:54:04] brother Brandon
[1:54:06] says and God come down in that muck what
[1:54:09] you were and sought you out and brought
[1:54:11] you out that ought to create a perfect
[1:54:15] love look what you was and look what you
[1:54:18] are what did that somebody
[1:54:23] that loved
[1:54:24] you can you have faith in what he's
[1:54:27] promised you then real genuine love will
[1:54:30] create will create a confidence in his
[1:54:32] word if God when I was an alien from him
[1:54:37] so loved me till he stooped down to get
[1:54:40] me and pick me up that gives me
[1:54:43] confidence that he wants to use me he's
[1:54:46] got a purpose in doing it he's seen
[1:54:48] something in me he's seen something in
[1:54:51] you he had a reason to save you look at
[1:54:54] the peoples that's unsaved today look at
[1:54:57] the millions he could have took beside
[1:55:00] you but he took
[1:55:03] you amen no one can take your place amen
[1:55:07] you're in God's economy no one can do it
[1:55:10] that's his love to you then won't you
[1:55:13] love won't Your Love reach right back to
[1:55:17] him and there's a love
[1:55:20] affair that no matter what the situation
[1:55:23] is it circumstances is governed by this
[1:55:26] love that creates faith that God loves
[1:55:29] you and you love God and you love one
[1:55:32] another and that brings the faith then
[1:55:35] it can't keep from bringing out exactly
[1:55:38] what God promised it would
[1:55:41] do that's perfect faith is
[1:55:46] pure why brother Ron stay here this week
[1:55:49] is because God loved him so much he had
[1:55:52] a purpose in saving
[1:55:57] him and I got notes all around this
[1:56:02] world all around the world I tell you
[1:56:04] when you want to find out how much
[1:56:06] Somebody Loves You just get sick one
[1:56:09] time it's amazing the kind of
[1:56:13] love people love our
[1:56:17] pastor they really love him they see
[1:56:20] something genuine in him brother Chris
[1:56:22] I know there's a whole lot of I know
[1:56:24] there's a whole lot of mistakes and a
[1:56:25] whole lot of man there that are out
[1:56:27] there in the world but we got a real
[1:56:29] Pastor somebody that we can somebody
[1:56:31] that we don't lift up and make a God but
[1:56:32] we got somebody that we can admire and
[1:56:34] have faith
[1:56:44] in but he had confidence in him that he
[1:56:46] could send him through it and I was
[1:56:48] hearing from all the world I thought
[1:56:50] this is amazing brother Joel
[1:56:54] all over all over Europe all over all
[1:56:56] over New Zealand Australia all over us
[1:57:00] and people were saying from Ireland even
[1:57:02] they're saying I never feared one time
[1:57:05] because I knew God had something left
[1:57:07] for brother Ron to
[1:57:10] do perfect love cast out
[1:57:15] fear well perfect faith is pure just as
[1:57:20] pure as love is and when you love
[1:57:22] somebody you love your husband and you
[1:57:24] love your wife now there's no need of
[1:57:26] anybody telling you that you don't do it
[1:57:29] because you do it and you know you do
[1:57:31] it you think I could talk Jeff out of
[1:57:34] saying he don't love you I don't think I
[1:57:36] could you think I could talk Katie
[1:57:44] out I don't think anybody
[1:57:48] could cuz ain't nobody
[1:57:51] else
[1:57:56] she had to be crazy to love somebody
[1:57:58] like
[1:58:01] me ain't it amazing that when you
[1:58:05] there's been some moments in my life I
[1:58:06] have embarrassed
[1:58:10] her the first year of our our marriage I
[1:58:13] probably embarrassed her more than
[1:58:14] anything
[1:58:16] else it wasn't by stupid mistakes that I
[1:58:19] did out in public it was was because
[1:58:21] something wasn't right
[1:58:23] here but she didn't give up on
[1:58:25] me she wore me out brother Timothy she
[1:58:29] wore me out in prayer man she she'd stay
[1:58:32] up all night i' to get up next morning
[1:58:33] at 4:00 in the morning she'd be having a
[1:58:35] prayer meeting God have mercy I got to
[1:58:37] go to
[1:58:39] bed but she loved me because something
[1:58:42] on the inside of her saw something
[1:58:45] valuable before I ever seen it she loved
[1:58:49] me even when I didn't look like the
[1:58:52] product that she was wanting as a
[1:58:54] husband she loved me when I didn't match
[1:58:58] the
[1:58:59] description but there was somebody
[1:59:02] working don't give up on the people that
[1:59:05] don't match the picture don't give up on
[1:59:08] them because they don't match what God's
[1:59:10] love is don't you give up on them don't
[1:59:13] give up don't give up don't give up well
[1:59:17] this person hurt me that person said
[1:59:18] something that person let me down don't
[1:59:21] you give up upon them because pure love
[1:59:25] has pure faith that God will see it
[1:59:33] through there's no need of anybody
[1:59:36] telling me that I don't love her because
[1:59:38] I love her and there ain't no need of
[1:59:40] any devil trying to talk me out of I'm
[1:59:42] not going in a Rapture because I know
[1:59:43] I'm going in a Rapture there's no need
[1:59:46] of no devil trying to raise up and tell
[1:59:48] me that I can't have the Holy Ghost
[1:59:50] because I know I got it there's there no
[1:59:52] need of any skeptic devil trying to shut
[1:59:56] us down it's because I love
[1:59:59] him you can't tell me I don't love him I
[2:00:02] love him because he first loved
[2:00:08] me by this shall all men know that
[2:00:11] you're my
[2:00:13] disciples when you
[2:00:16] love one or
[2:00:19] another what you saying to us brother
[2:00:23] be the kind of love that expresses God's
[2:00:27] love I think that's something very
[2:00:29] powerful about brother
[2:00:31] Ron is that he can meet a
[2:00:34] stranger
[2:00:37] and there's many of men that we know but
[2:00:39] brother Ron's probably inFAMOUS or
[2:00:41] famous for this I mean I don't know if
[2:00:43] that's the right word to use right there
[2:00:44] or not but anyways he can literally meet
[2:00:47] anybody he can be on a cruise ship and
[2:00:48] people fall in love with the
[2:00:50] man
[2:00:52] he could be in a gas station and people
[2:00:54] just want to be with
[2:00:58] him what is
[2:01:00] that literally what it what what's the
[2:01:02] drawing power of that it's the love of
[2:01:07] God people get so MX stood I've heard
[2:01:10] sister say I don't know how to take
[2:01:11] brother on he said he loved me he ain't
[2:01:13] talking that kind of
[2:01:17] love you'd be some kind of idiot to
[2:01:19] think that kind of thing there's some
[2:01:21] idiots out there
[2:01:23] I wonder when he says I love you I love
[2:01:26] you buddy what is say that's the kind of
[2:01:29] love that God ex expresses
[2:01:35] out love is Lac throughout all the
[2:01:38] message I'm way over time but I'm I'm
[2:01:40] I'm done I'm moving on from this thought
[2:01:42] I'm going somewhere else tomorrow so let
[2:01:44] me Express this to you love is laced
[2:01:46] right into the third
[2:01:48] pole because when brother bandham comes
[2:01:50] and Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[2:01:52] he lays in there that this is God's
[2:01:54] expression of love he said that God and
[2:01:58] man could be one it was his expression
[2:02:00] of love and when he comes down to the
[2:02:02] end of it he says now go on and love one
[2:02:05] another and he goes into paragraph 637
[2:02:08] and he says now you that are spiritual
[2:02:11] he said look at the clock it's 2:00 on
[2:02:13] the dot he eles love in the message of
[2:02:16] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[2:02:18] said it's a sign that the second pull is
[2:02:21] ended and that the third pole is at hand
[2:02:24] love is laced right into the message of
[2:02:27] the third pole what produced a king
[2:02:30] sword in this generation
[2:02:33] love God bless you do you love
[2:02:36] me do you love one
[2:02:41] another do you love one
[2:02:45] another do you really love your
[2:02:49] neighbor do you really love him
[2:02:52] really love him you don't want to see
[2:02:55] nobody go to
[2:02:57] hell but this kind of love is not the
[2:03:00] kind of love that you just I love him
[2:03:02] because I want to escape hell you love
[2:03:05] him that even if he would send you to a
