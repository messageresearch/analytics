author of his word Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord we stand on this side Lord Jesus of of great meetings we sit here Lord in your presence Lord and we've gathered One More Time Lord this same God has come to meet Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle one more time one more weekend you've given us ample opportunity to praise you and to lift your name on high now father we pray God that you would just would just come Lord and you would visit us and you wouldd allow us to entertain you Lord Jesus you'd allow us just to handle the word of life and may we be a witness of your resurrection power Lord we just ask Lord as we humble ourselves before you Lord we want you to hear through us we want you to speak through us we ask Lord that you would bless us abundantly here tonight Lord we we've gathered here Lord Jesus in your name and you said where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them and Lord we just ask Lord that you take the things that you've done maybe we didn't see the full effect of what took place at the meeting but I pray that the impact of the Holy Spirit would begin to ReSound the words that were spoken through mortal lips from a Heavenly realm I pray that you would take the things that were delivered to us Lord by our brothers and you would make them just so impact our soul and may we see the the fruits of our labors and the benefits of those meetings poured out in our community poured out in our church poured out in our life Lord we love you with an undying love and we are here tonight and we ask that you would bless us according to your riches and Grace we humble ourselves before you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles we we'd like to look over in the book of Isaiah chapter 31 and then to Romans chapter 8 and 1 John the first John the Epistle of John chapter 4 thank you I was I was studying last week while we were in the meetings and and uh I'd been looking for some quotations on brother brandham would make about having services in auditoriums and Arenas and while I was looking for these quotes of Lord just dropped this thought in my heart and and I I'd like to speak to you just for a few minutes and uh on God is in your corner God is in your corner and and one of the quotations I was looking at was brother Brandon I'm just going to just kind of read just portion of it but in there brother Brandon would say he said I won the bantamweight championship of three states and was not defeated he said I give it up to preach the gospel he said but I tell you I got a greater fight now than I ever had in all my life he said I ain't F fighting my buddy I'm fighting the devil just as hard as I can and I always remember the different techniques and way to watch and different things from the guard and so forth in boxing and you have to be certainly on your toes when you're fighting this great great enemy that we have now amen Isaiah CH 31 and verse one woe to them that go down to Egypt for help and stay on horses and Trust in chariots because they are many and Horsemen because they are very strong but they look not on the Holy One of Israel neither seek the Lord yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arve against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity now the Egyptians are men and not God and their horses are flesh and not Spirit when the Lord shall stretch out his forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor obas himself for the noise of them so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion and for the heal thereof Romans 8:31 so notice in the last scripture there verse four the noise didn't scare the lion away from his prey there was a lot of voices that came in amongst that line but Jesus are voices of men that raise against his will Romans 8:31 what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us and then 1 John chapter 4 and verse four ye are of God little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world may God bless his word you may be seated tonight here in the presence of the Lord as we said we' like to speak to you on God is in your corner mother brandom in he that is in you he said he said if we could only receive this truth he said not just a now just a moment he said if we could only realize what this scripture mean he said he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world he said we can't understand that yet we say we believe it we know it's true but we really don't understand it Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so here is a prophet speaking to well-trained Christians he said we say that we believe it he said but we really don't understand it he said but greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world he said what is in you that's greater it's Christ the Anointed God that was in Christ is in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world then if he is in you it's not what in he said it's not you anymore living it's him living in you it's not your thinking what you would think about this it's what it's what he said about this then if he is in you he would absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he has said he is trying to find a person that he can vindicate himself through again in here ye him I would like to draw this draw this together basically this thought tonight from this entire context brother random would say he said one day when Adam's race was backed in the to a corner where the law and the judgments and the prophets and everything that had been sent had failed nothing could be done the human race was doomed and great armies of hell were marching on well trained in their ranks and every man to his place they backed Adam's children into the corner where they could go no further they sent the law and they couldn't keep it they sent judgments they wouldn't listen to it they plunged right on they sent the prophets and they stoned those and nothing could be done they were backed into a corner but in glory one day the most precious thing Heaven of Heaven stepped out before the angels of God and said this day I will give my life for the sons of Adam this day will I do something that'll break the ranks of the enemy the angels all said what will you do what will you do and he came to Earth a virgin at a Calvary when he went to Calvary he stood on this Earth and he preached the gospel said I'm going to give you some material I want you to go up to the city of Jerusalem and I want you to wait there for I'm going to dress you I'm going to make you soldiers to fight against the Ws of the enemy but first before you go into Battlefront go up to Jerusalem and wait there and what I give you you follow me and fight as best as you can I say what God has given unto us we ought to do everything that within us and we ought to fight the best that we can he said there on the D dark day of Calvary the Lamb of God the precious son of God that came down from Glory never taken the way of denomination he never taken the way of some easy Road he never taken the form of some ecclesiastical system but he went to the darkest and the roughest part of the spears the Valley of the shadow of death and he grabbed all the death and threw and threw it into his bosom and he died a hero and he sent down the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost lost he said now men and women we've got he said what we've got let's fight there's good Corner coaches and there's bad Corner coaches and I believe that if we're going to be in a fight we want the best that we can absolutely get because I believe that we are in a fight for our life I believe that we're in a fight for the supernatural we're in a fight for our ministry we're in a fight for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're in a fight for Supernatural events we're we're in a fight to leave this whole world we are we are in the greatest fight that ever has been and not just here in our mind but it's something that that's where the battle starts but I believe that if we're going to fight in this battle then we want the very best corner coat that we can absolutely get we want somebody that that has watched Men that not just rose up and fail but men that rose up to be real champions of Deliverance me real champions of Victory and that good Corner coach he he knows his fighter he has he has studied that fighter and he knows what the fighters reach is he knows what his weight is he knows how that he's going to stand in the fight he he has studied that man he has spent he has spent time studying out his D there are certain men that can only fight for maybe certain rounds so he has got to train them in such a way so that he he maybe he gets to the fifth got to pull his man from the fight he knows when the fight is too much on him so he he literally when he gets to that spot where he has watched him he throws in the tow in the tow because he recognized that they were in a war of of attrition and that Muhammad Ali was literally going to kill Joe Fraser and Joe Frasier got so mad at Eddie fooch because he going to put anything upon us that we are not going to be able to fa that that we're not going to be able to handle but God is faithful he is faithful in such a way that he knows how much we can handle he knows how much we can take he knows how much we can go through so the Bible said that in that time in that Temptation that God Will Make A Way of Escape for us when we get to that spot of the battle when we can't go no far far further in our fight when we can't go no more in our emotional realm when we can't go no more in our Humanity God says I'm going to step in Hallelujah aren't you thankful that God has made a way you see it's just like when Noah had 120 years he was sitting there and he was preaching you see and Noah and his family was the only ones that was saved in the ark you see and they turned it down it was judgment to them but it what what it was to Noah was an atonement because it it gave him a way of escape and I know that God as a god that is called Jehovah Gyra that no matter how dark this place and he knows how much of Le osia that you can take so he's made a Rapture so that you can get out of it brother Adam said Satan May pin you in a corner with cancer but God Will Make A Way of Escape Satan May pin you down under a car but God Will Make A Way of Escape Satan may take your family away but God Will Make A Way of Escape God has a way now the corner man he is the he is the voice in the fight there's a thousand other voices in the fight there's a thousand other fans in the fight and his character he's been with him when he was bleeding he was he's been with with him when he was wounded in the battle he's been with him in pain so this man trust this voice he trust the voice of the guy that's in his corner he knows he won't let him go too far he knows how much it can take so he trusts that voice I say this unto you the god that is in your corner the voice that is in your corner knows how much you can take he knows you're going to win the battle you see that corner man he's got a voice and he knows his voice is the most important voice you see you see the fighter might hear the other voices but he's not paying attention to them voices he's not paying attention to the ecclesiastical system voices he's paying attention to the voice of the son of man because the son of man made him a promise he was not going to leave him here hallelujah that Corner man finds the right words he finds the right words for the boxer in the situation that he's in and the trick is to send that boxer back out there with the will and the knowhow and the belief that he's going to win you see if you got a corner man that's telling you you're not good enough you need to fire the corner man if you got a corner man that's telling you that you're never going to make it fire the corner man if you got a corner man that tells you that you're never going to be healed fire the corner man but if you got a corner man that says get back out there you were born for this you were born to take the paddle what is he doing he's grabbing the fleeting moments of the battle to refocus his athletes mind so that he takes him back to his training now I had to be honest with you I had to to do some real study to get into this mindset just to be honest because it's typically not the the world that I study in but I had to literally study to get myself in the mindset of a corner man and I I I read what brother bandam said he said now I he said I don't watch that he said I don't watch Boxing no more and I don't listen to it on radio he said because he said it's in my blood he said he said it's in my blood you understand what he's saying I to be honest with you I studied this out I I spent some time I spent some time listening to the great Corner man's I spent some time listening to Mike Tyson's Corner man I spent some time listening to to Muhammad Ali and Joe frasers I listened to their voices and I have to be honest with you you wouldn't want to showed up in my study right there cuz I tell you what it was in my blood the corner man I'm glad you didn't show up but the corner man is the guy that if the boxer's winning and he's succeeding you don't see the corner man you don't see him you see the fighter but if the if the fighter has fallen and he's not succeeding and he and he has failed in his battle the corner man is the one that you see you see he's standing up between the public and his fighter oh I hope you hear what I'm saying to you you see because you see there might have been failures in your life but you don't see the fighter you see the corner man man you may have seen wounds you may have seen a battle but you don't see the mistakes you see the corner man because a corner man is a man that's been trained to talk to the public he's been trained to show up he knows how to handle the criticism he knows how to handle the mocking he knows how to handle when he's been when his Fighter's been defeated and the corner man he knows the words to say Lord a a top Corner man he's got to possess a range of complimentary attributes that many of people that'll they'll never attain in their life the corner man has got to have the ability to be able to detach himself from the boxer he can't let his feelings get involved because he's got to allow the fighter to fight he's got to allow him to get into the ring with not getting emotional about it because there's going to be times in the fight when his fighter doesn't look like he's winning so he's got to be able to detach himself so Jesus knows how good the battle that you're in is for you so he's not going to throw in the towel because he knows you got something on the inside of you that's willing to go the distance but at the at the same time the corner man's got to have an unwavering Devotion to the boxer's well-being the corner man has got a desire he has to have a desire to watch every characteristic of the boxer's performance but out of necessity he's got to examine every detail of the other guy he's got to study him and he's got to study his own people he's been studying Satan for 6,000 years but he's been studying you and he knows that what you got on the inside of you is where it has the ability to go all the way you see because what the other guy does not know is that the corner man deposited himself he deposited himself on the inside of the fighter so he knows Hallelujah he knows there's no give up in him he knows there's no backup because he deposited himself into him in the natural the corner man's got to be a psychologist he's got to be able to assist the fighter through the emotional mindfield that is in the preparation for combat the corner man's got to be a strategist he's got to have the knowhow how to handle the battle that's in front of him and the one that's that the one how much how he's going to throw punches he's got to have a strategy on how he's going to beat this guy the corner man's got to be a general he's got to be able to see what's going to take what's going to what it's going to take to secure Victory and offering the kind of tactical advice that can be put into practice in the in in the crucial battle that he's in this corner man's got to be n a nutritionist we got the best we can ever have because Jesus said man should not live by bread alone but by every word word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and you're feeding off a seven course menu you got the best nutritionist that there can be the corner man's got to be a medic he sent his word and he healed them and he delivered them from their destructions the corner man's got to be a role model that's why Paul said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus in short a good man needs to possess a range of qualities I'd say we'd be here all night if we start to be able to express the attributes of almighty God you see as a corner man I hope it's okay if not if not I'll I'll preach to myself as a corner man it's not just that he's got to say the right words and be a motivational speaker but he's got to be honest with a fighter because the Bible said that iron sharpens iron is that right so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend so he's got to be honest with him like Angelo Dundee when when he was standing out there with Sugar Ray L and Tommy Hearns was whooping him in 1981 he took him all lat into the 14th round and he about about beat his brains out and and Sugar Ray Leonard he got into such a spot that that Tommy Hearns had put him into a place that that that that Tommy Hearns had had outpointed should Leonard in every single way possible when he got back in the corner Angelo Dundee stood there he didn't say hey you're doing all right just keep up what you're doing he didn't tell him that he said son you're blowing it you're blowing it sometimes you need a voice in your corner that say you're blowing the greatest chance you ever been given you've been given a chance at the Holy Ghost you've be given a chance to be a champion of the world you need somebody say you're blowing it you're blowing it you've got a chance at the message of the hour you got a chance at a supernatural event you're blowing it that's all it took for Sugar Ray Leonard he got back out there and put on the greatest show of boxing has ever seen in one round and in one round he turned the fight around Hall ah Hallelujah maybe you've been in that kind of a week or maybe been in that kind of a spot and a corner man he starts preaching on Divine Healing he starts preaching on clothesline religion he starts preaching on Holiness he starts and the corner man get your attention what are you going to do with this when you get done hearing the voice of the corner man sugar L Sugar Ray Leonard would have lost right there if he wouldn't have put into action with the corner man head that's right but it's known as one of the greatest rounds of boxing that's ever been seen because he listened to the voice now God is the ultimate trainer just as a coach prepares a boxer for each fight God prepare prepares and equips you for every battle that you going to face he provides you with wisdom he provides you with strength he provides you with guidance he provides you in every situation because he knows he knows the opponent that you're facing brother random would talk about it like this he said he said when I was going into a battle when I was going into a fight I think it's pretty awesome I think it's pretty awesome he had a prophet that had never lost the battle he was so serving a God that had never lost a battle he said but when I would get in there and I would train he said we studied out the mechanics of our opponent he said we studied him out how he used his eyes how he came out of the corner whether he ran or whether he Ste how he moved his feet where it was a jab or a punch of the throat he he said we studied him he said but we know the strike of the enemy he said we know what his tactics are and he said we're here tonight with the scripture to cover him up so he can't move cuz the enem is on every hand what are you saying in all this brother Andrew I'm saying God's given you every every tactic he's giving you every opportunity he's giving you every blessing he's giving you the greatest thing that he ever could give you to cover up Satan the Bible said that I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto me but my un come to the father but by me and the prophet said he said there's only you know there's two ways for all things he said you're aware of that he said that's your way and God's way and you can't be and have your way and be in God's way at the same time you've got to get out of your own way to let God have his way isn't that true he said if it it's he said it's either right or left he said if you're going he said if you're going your way you're out of God's way and if you cease from your own way you can you if you cease from your own way you get in God's way I hope I read that right and if you cease from your own way you get out of God's way God can have his way when you cease to have your way but as long as you're having your way God can't have his way so you've got to go one or the other ways so let's just let's just are on our own way drop tonight let's God have God's way because God has a way I'll say this our corner man knows a way because the Bible said in Isaiah 35 and8 that a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness so God is saying I am the leader on this road I am a God to the wandering soul I am a teacher to the ignorant I am example to All I'm going to tell you right now you're not going to win this battle doing this on your own you're not going to conquer lay see you on your own you're not going to get out of your slack on your own there ain't the Bible or the Bible tells us he is the way so if we're going to find the way we've got to find him another B would talk about a chicken about it about it uh pipping its way through a through a through its eggshell he said they ain't found no better way for that that chicken to peep its way through there knock itself he said it's got a little it's it's got a little thing on the end of its beak and it just scratches along the eggshell and it's scratching in there he said he said they ain't found no better way for it he said because that's God's provided way he said but what that science doesn't recognize he said is that little bird is gaining strength while it's down there peeping and stretching its neck out it's down there and it's working trying to get its way out trying to peep its way out of that shell he said that's a way that a Christian's got to come they've got to come God's provided way you can't help them out of their trouble they got to get out of it themselves come on somebody we had somebody come here one time they was full gung-ho they was ready to make Full Gospel Lighthouse there their church until they found out that we didn't have a book where they could sign their name they well I can't do that I got to have something I can put my name on I tell you brother I tell you I got the best way God put my name name on his book before the foundation of the world I don't need to see my name written in pen of ink here in humanity as long as I can see it by the blood that's God's way he said that's the way it is with Christians he said if you take it away from them he said they're weak jellyfish Christians he said but if they come down to an altar and die after to themselves die out to their ideas he said that's God's provided way I got to studying that out how long it takes a chicken to break out it takes 21 days for him to break out of that's what science says I ain't sit there and watched it but I say are pretty close it takes about 20 it takes about three weeks for that chicken to stand there and while he's doing it science says while he's doing it I found this amazing for 21 days he's standing there and he's getting ready to Break Forth into New Opportunities he said sign said that that little chick has got to persevere to get outside of that shell you might been in a battle like Daniel was in a battle for 21 days they kept praying he didn't give up but he kept praying when the Prince of Persia was there Daniel kept pray praying when trouble was there for 21 days I say it's time for you to persevere in prayer like a corner man's taught us to pray pray pray everywhere break through oh Hallelujah he's a way of Salvation there ain't no other way to Salvation he's the way to all the blessings of the Covenant of Grace he's the the way to heaven he's the way to our healing he's the way to our deliverance he opened up the way by his blood he opened it for his people he is the way well I'm tell you right now brother Andrew I'm going to win this battle on my own I highly doubt that one bit but if God is on your side I'm going tell you what I ain't never found another way outside of this message come on young people I can tell you you can look in every enti in thing cigarettes won't hold you alcohol won't hold you the things of the world won't hold you but this way this power this [Applause] anointing there is no satisfying portion down there in Le but this message is my satisfying [Applause] portion brother bandam said he said what if that little chicken on the inside of that little egg he said a little bird what if he was afraid to hit the shell what if he would have heard a sound on the outside don't hit the shell you might hurt yourself he said but the nature itself on the inside of that bird tells him knock a hole in it how many of you heard that same devil say you better not do that you better not preach that you better not believe that but the nature on the inside of a Believer says knock a a hole in it knock a hole on it he they say the days of Miracles has passed knock a hole in it they say he don't give the Holy Ghost knock a hole in it I say it unto you Peck your way out how do you do it blasting thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord finally you finally you begin to smell some fresh air thus sayth the Lord you got your head on the outside thus sayith the Lord he never goes back to the cell again I ain't got nothing to go back to I destroy the bridges I burn them to the [Applause] Ground God has a way God's got to way when you can't understand it when you can't SE on your own God has got away sometimes you need some encouragement in the battle I'll be honest I as a minister I don't look at this as a real sermon I know it is but I'll be honest I just looking at it in the scope of it it probably is a sermon probably shouldn't said that probably somebody criticized me and hang me on the cross but that's all right I look at this as one of the a a great encouragement said no matter what you go through that God is there you know what one time Matthew was a football coach and did a pretty good job he was a pretty good player so he did a pretty good job but he worked alongside with a coach coach ball I believe this right coach ball was a funny funny dude well he he was he was in the college realm as a as a coach and and he he seen that his team was the underdog one night and they wasn't going to win they W going to win this whatsoever well the team had a they had a team dog that was with them everywhere they went and so here right before the game comes they getting ready you know how football football players do they they get their head into it and they they sitting there and sometimes they got to play classical music and sometimes it's hail's Bells they're trying to get their mind in it it's amazing we we played one time we played in a what was it State semi-final game and they the team that we was playing is trying to L us to sleep and they played this classical music out there on the auditorium while we was practicing and training they thinking it they thinking it was going to Mellow us out well they didn't realize that our running back had add and it had the opposite effect on them and that joker ran all night long some of the greatest scoring we ever had in Fort Defiance but anyways Coach B right before the right before the team's getting ready to go out on the field he carries in the dog and the dog is completely lifeless he walks in there said look what the other team did look what the other team did they killed our dog man I'll tell you what these guys that were underdogs and they was stirred up they went out there and beat the socks off that team because they had something to fight for they had done something personally to them when they got back in and they was rooting and hauling around in the locker room here comes a dog running back through air he give him some sleeping pills well maybe you need some motivation maybe you're in that kind of a spot where the enemy tried to come in and take everything away from you maybe you need some encouragement so let me encourage you by saying this we won't be low to sleep we will have we got the greatest Corner man God has got a away and this message is his way remember him said now God's got way he said I ain't got nothing to brag on in my first birth he said because in my first birth he said it was Gung Slingers he said it was Bootleggers it was sinners in there he said there ain't nothing in there I can brag on he said but in my second birth he said I can brag on that he's my father he's my savior He's My Redeemer I'm his son I'm not ashamed of my second birth God's got a away I just feel the drop this right here I've been holding this for a for a little bit but the Bible said in Deuteronomy 23 and2 that a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to the 10th Generation shall it not enter into the congregation of the Lord now now this is I got this while I was there preaching for brother Kelly hilderbrand I've seen this it's a personal letter it's a personal letter that was that was two sister Dalton that was two sister Dalton from the brand and because illegitimacy was an issue throughout all of Christianity and throughout the message that IL illegitimacy was an issue that had baffled and worried the generations of Christians and sister dton knew that she had had some bastard children and some illegitimacy in her family's history and in November of 1960 her husband had the had the opportunity to sit down with brother Rand and some brothers there in his din room and he's sitting there and they and they begin to ask him some questions about about illegitimacy and he began to ask his questions on his wife's behalf and brother Dalton presented the question of illegitimacy and here is what the letter says that November the 12th 1960 sister da is sitting here alone the brother brother dton is ritten out the sister da said sitting here alone with brother Ram Ed Jean and I heard him explain a bastard child he said if it was in the Old Testament a type of under grace brother brandom said that we're all bastard children and are brought to God by Christ we must be rebred by the truth and being born again our being being born again our being born again of Christ changes everything it changes us from illegitimate to legitimate Sons and Daughters of God in Adam we were hybrid birth but in Christ we are the true birth and brother brandham signs it and writes a note to Sister Dalton says do not fear sister Dalton your new birth or anyone's New Birth corrects it all God is in your corner the new birth corrects it all oh I got a prophet's word he said if I bought a piece of ground it isn't yours until you got an abstract but if you've got an abstract it shows that everything that was ever against that piece of CR has been struck off and then when you have become a Christian and accept Christ as your savior then when God sends down the abstract it shows that no matter what your father did what your mother did what anybody else did what your mother your Daddy might have been drunken prostitutes whatever it is every sin is stricken off you got an abstract title your new birth the Holy Ghost baptizing you corrects it all men have tried to Discount you and say you're not worthy of this message the key to winning this battle is redemption the way out is not given up you got to fight for every single inch you see God gave you the greatest weapon that he ever could have gave you when he gave you this word so I say step out and fight we got to step out and fight brother bam said he said he said every good Christian he said they got to do some training they got to start training with John 3:16 the Golden Roll he said start out with that he said that'll get you on the floor he said but then train for The Knockout punches because you're going to have to use them come on somebody we're not just a bunch of school girls we're not just a bunch of literar that know how to read our Bible we are a people that have trained for The Knockout Punch come on somebody we a we been feeding you this message here at Full Gospel Lighthouse just to make you another church we've been feeding you this message to keep the punches off of you and to train for The Knockout punches the prophet said man wants to see some heroism men are waiting for a gallon stand the world's waiting to find a man who can step out he said here not long ago he said when Divine Healing he said 10 years ago he said when I started out on the field he said they said you can't do it brother brandom I love it when you tell a man of God he can't do something you can't do it brother brandom science is against you doctors is against you modernism is against you but I said but Christ just for me well I don't care if God be for me who can be against me the corner coach he don't get a timeout he's there through every round he don't leave the fighter out there in the ring all by himself but he is constantly Dro him dropping him hands full on purpose he's there with him round after round he's there to encourage him he's there to give him strategy and when he's there after each round when the bell goes off he's there to patch up his wounds God's doing the same thing for you he doesn't abandon you when the fight gets tough he stays with you helping you recover and adjust your strategy so to make sure that you win the battle they asked brother Brandon one time said are you ever afraid that you're going to make a mistake he said absolutely Ely not he because I Hallelujah he said I know he's right there and as long as he right there he said as long as I can feel he's right there how can I make a mistake when I know he's right there how am I going to fail when I know he's right there how am I going to lose when I know he's right there because the Bible said in Psalms 46 and7 the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Jeremiah 1:19 said and they shall fight against thee but they shall not Prevail against thee for I am with thee sayith the Lord to deliver thee you got some time for the word from a corner man Psalms 56 be merciful unto me oh God for man would swallow me up he fighted daily oppressive me my enemies would daily swallow me up for there be many that fight against me oh thou most high what time I am afraid I will trust in thee in God will I praise His word in God I will put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me every day the rest they rest my words all their thoughts are evil against me for evil they gather themselves together they hide themselves and Mark my steps when they await for my soul shall they escape by iniquity and thine anger cast down the people oh God now tell my wonderings and put my tears into a bottle are they not in my book He's numbered them he knows when Satan's trying to destroy you and he's counting the tears and he's putting them in a bottle let me say this God will Revenge you God will Revenge you Muhammad Ali were standing in the battle in the ring one time with Larry Holmes and Larry Holmes beat all over top of beat all over top of him CU cuz deato called Muhammad Ali right after the battle he watched it he said why did you let him beat on you like that why did you do that why you know you could have beat him cuz got to cry and he was so upset because Muhammad let him beat him and there was a little guy in the car that was a little bitt old nothing at the time and he spoke up said Muhammad when I get to be a big man I'm going to Revenge you so when Mike Tyson steps into the ring with Larry Holmes and Muhammad Ali is there as an honorary guest he walks in there Muhammad Ali leans over to Mike Tyson it says beat him for me Revenge him for me let me say this to you Satan may have whipped you every which away but God is your [Applause] Avenger he knows how many times you've quied yourself to sleep wondering if you're going to make it wonder if you have the goods to go through it or not but God has numbered your tears when I cry unto thee then shall my enemies turn back this I know for God is for me the prophet said I don't care what size they are it's a fire it's a fight that's in the dog that's what counts he said it's the faith that's in the individual if you're a coward get back to your cuddle hole he said but brother if you're a soldier stand out there a battle on right and Wrongs engaged let's fight Psalms 1:18 and6 the Lord is on my side I will not fear what man can do unto me I got to studying it took me a little bit to get this so just dare bear with me I I'll be honest I've been studying this this little this little quotation right here for about four months I got to studying on Satan's testimony so we're going to bring up Satan's testimony Satan was cast out of Heaven Satan was cast to the ground every single time that Satan came up against Jesus Jesus cast Satan out and the final edge of his testimony is at the end of it he is cast into the Lake of Fire so his testimony is being cast down cast down cast down I don't care what he said About You cast him down I don't care what he's whispering in your ear cast him down I don't care if he's telling you you're going to remain sick cast him down Satan has a testimony of being cast down but your testimony is being brought up he didn't cast you down he didn't make fun of you the Redeemer that hung on the cross the prophet said Satan's armies bring diseases he said but God's Army cast them out hope you enjoyed my four month's testimony little study there I want you to know that if he comes against you I feel I feel the anointing of God if he comes against you cast him down that's his testimony that's his speech that's his knowledge that's Hallelujah cast him down get him out of your mind get him out of your reasonings get him out of your home cast him out I'm not doing a part two so you're going to have to deal with me but a corner man has spent some real time with his fighter he's numbered out the bag and while his fighter is hitting the bag he's not just standing there beating the air but he's got certain positions that he's hitting he's got certain numbers on the bag and he calls out sequences of numbers give him the 012 give him the 7321 you see because he's he's trained him that way so that when he gets in the middle of a battle when he gets out there he can just holler out some noises he can holler out Isaiah 53 he can holler out Isaiah 54:17 no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper come on somebody give him the old Revelations 10:7 give him the old Malachi 45 come on somebody if God be for me give him the old one to give him John 3:16 give him Deuteronomy 33 and 29 happy Art Thou o Israel who is like unto the old people saved by the Lord The Shield of thy help who is a sword of thy Excellency and thine enemies shall be found Liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places give him the old background for Rapture give them old psalms 27 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell they failed in their purpose so the Lord put stumbling blocks in their way and their March and hindered them from executing their designs how's that for Satan's testimony though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this well I be confident it's not the Flesh of man that is against you we are in a Warfare with strongholds of principalities and powers and rulers of the darkness the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple a Chinese philosopher philosopher one time he studied out all the religions of the world he studied out the Quran he studied out Buddhist teaching he studied out the religions of all the world he studied out James he studied out the siks he studied them all out he standed he studied the Hindu religion out and he made this remark that Christianity is the most stunning religion for this one scripture of Ephesians 2 and22 in whom you are also build it together for in habitation of God through the spirit he said because of that one scripture he said Christianity is the greatest religion of the world that the god of Heaven wants to dwell on the inside of you by this one scripture by this one scripture he wants to live on the inside of you he ain't no good if he's out there on the outside he ain't no good if he's just God with us but it's got to be God in us come on somebody we don't want to just to fill him on our flesh we don't want to just fill him in our spirit we want him in our soul that's why Paul could say in Romans 837 nay in all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us you're not just a conqueror you're a super conqueror I'm a super conquerer I'm an overcomer I'm a devil Destroyer I'm a serpent Bruiser I'm a devil master in all of these things amen and possessing the enemy's gate and I'm closing aren't you happy this morning to know that we stand now more than a conqueror more than a conqueror there's nothing to fight about the fight's over the whistles blowed and the flag gross and in the midst of every sin pile every midst of sick room is The Old Rugged Cross planted by the blood of Jesus Christ a conqueror the only thing we have to do is believe look and live I'll be with you I'll prove people come in the last day they say oh well that was but I'll be with you and the Very things that I did here on Earth I'll be and you doing the very same thing then they'll know then they'll know they'll see me my people will see me the Seed of Abraham will see me they'll know me they'll recognize me for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and shall he set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up I don't care how bad the devil's got you down lift your head up I don't care how big how big the devil that you're facing I don't care how low you feel lift your head up and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord lift your head up I don't know how much I got left in me do you know it's harder for you to quit than it is to fight it's harder for you to quit than it it's a fight because quitting is a terminal sentence that you have to live with for the rest of your life come on somebody everybody has been a quitter sometime in their life but a real fighter refuses to give up come on somebody if you quit you're going to live in the prison of regret for the rest of your life if you quit on this message you're going to regret it all the days of your life if you quit on God you'll regret it but if you'll fight for his kingdom one of these days he'll say step in The Chariot with me and let's ride Soldier Hallelujah we got the greatest Corner man that the world has ever seen [Applause] you can win you can win you can go in a Rapture you can beat depression you can beat a terminal illness come on somebody you can beat you can beat the influence of hell you can beat the voice of Destruction you can do this you can do this let me tell you I'm not in your corner telling you to give up I'm not in your corner telling you to back down I'm in your corner and I'm saying you're going to win you're going to go through some stuff but you're going to win nobody had ever been knocked out by Mike Tyson and got back up nobody but Buster Douglas was in the ring with him I'm sorry I had to go into all of that but I had to get my mind into this into this realm Buster Douglas was in the ring and Mike Tyson knocks him out and the referee's down there on the on the on the canvas and he's counting him out one two three and Buster Douglas is out and all of a sudden the Bell Rings they gathered Buster Douglas up and put him back in his corner and they started talking to him now nobody had ever knocked out Mike Tyson and nobody had ever been Mike been knocked out by Mike Tyson and got back in the ring but for the world when Buster Douglas steps back out into the ring the world ain't a never seen this before they knew that any minute that Mike Tyson was going to knock Buster Douglas out but all of a sudden Buster Douglas goes to fighting and beats Mike Tyson and knocks him out and wins a battle when it comes to the end of the fight and the microphone comes to Buster Douglas said how did you do it what did the corner man say he said it wasn't a corner man he said my mama told me two days ago she died two days ago in the hospital but two days before she died she told the entire world that I was going to beat Mike Tyson she said he said I did it for Mama's sake now with a voice from a world that's done gone on can encourage a man in a natural fight how about a voice of Malachi 4 how about a voice of the Resurrection nobody had ever died before and got back up but on Eastern morning he rose up with a code of a corner man and said I am he that was dead but I am alive forever [Music] more Hallelujah the corner man is the god in the [Applause] fight come on on Matt give that guy a microphone come on we done got him down on the floor get him get him one two three for Seven Ages it looked like we were going to be defeated but in the seventh age the son of man has showed up in the bride's body to prove he is the resurrection and the life he is the way God bless you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise well we train for The Knockout punches [Music] hallelujah hallelujah I'm Overcomer by the blood of the
