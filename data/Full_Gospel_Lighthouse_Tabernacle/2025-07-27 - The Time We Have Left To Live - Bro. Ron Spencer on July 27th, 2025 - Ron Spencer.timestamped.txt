[35:25] I hope this can come out. I've got a
[35:26] confession. Hold on to your seats. But
[35:30] it's weighing on my heart. And after
[35:32] brother Matt asked me to sing and he
[35:33] sung that song while ago, Falling in
[35:36] Love, I knew this was supposed to be
[35:39] said. So I hope I say it right.
[35:43] I'm coming up on eight years since the
[35:45] Lord called my son home.
[35:49] Many of you know the testimony of our
[35:52] our sister,
[35:53] my brother, the tragedies.
[35:57] And I remember going to brother Reagan's
[36:01] he coming up on eight years
[36:04] and brother Louie reached out to have me
[36:07] sing a song
[36:09] and this song crossed my mind and this
[36:11] is my confession.
[36:13] I couldn't sing it.
[36:16] It's crossed my mind many times and you
[36:18] all know it. So I hope when I try in a
[36:20] moment you'll sing with me.
[36:25] And that is
[36:27] when the Lord takes me. The first thing
[36:29] I could only think of is I want to see
[36:31] my son.
[36:33] God, if if you've read my testimony in
[36:36] the book,
[36:37] God did many things for me to prove that
[36:40] he's there. I'll never forget that
[36:42] morning I sat in brother Reagan's office
[36:44] and he looked at me. He said, "He's
[36:45] there. It's God's servant and I know
[36:48] he's there." And all I can think about
[36:51] is
[36:53] hugging my son.
[36:57] So the song Jesus is what makes it
[36:59] heaven for me. It's my confession.
[37:02] The Lord already knows my sorrow for
[37:04] feeling that way. But I wanted to say it
[37:07] today that I couldn't sing that song
[37:11] cuz all I could think is, yeah, I love
[37:15] the Lord,
[37:17] but I want to feel my David hug again. I
[37:20] want to see him first.
[37:22] I'm ashamed of that, but I'm honest.
[37:26] I've got some integrity. I'll tell you
[37:28] straight.
[37:30] And as time went on, I
[37:34] I grew up in what we call a holiness
[37:37] church. And I'm not passing any
[37:39] discredit to any of that in the past,
[37:40] but I'm just my testimony
[37:42] that as an adolescent or young teen, we
[37:45] learned of the prophet and we learned of
[37:48] the ch church ages and we learned of the
[37:50] seals and the serpent seed.
[37:55] But I never learned to love God the way
[37:56] I've learned in these last eight years.
[38:00] When I look back and I that day he
[38:02] drugged me out of an ocean that I was
[38:04] gone and in my heart I said bye to my
[38:07] family.
[38:09] Pulled me out of that car called DOA
[38:11] operic down.
[38:14] And when I reached suicide losing my
[38:16] family and my child,
[38:19] he reached down
[38:22] and all the things he did for me under
[38:23] brother Reagan. And then I got here and
[38:25] he reminded me that 22 years ago I was
[38:28] on a plane that
[38:30] brother Ron knew he'd meet me again
[38:32] someday
[38:34] and he'd take over the reigns and help
[38:35] lead me.
[38:37] And I tell you that don't make you love
[38:39] the Lord.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And I my son could look over the portals
[38:44] today and I believe he could. I think
[38:45] he's saying I'm going to hug you too,
[38:47] Dad, but Jesus is what makes it heaven
[38:50] for me.
[38:56] I've heard of a land that is wondrously
[39:01] fair.
[39:03] They say that it splendor
[39:07] is far beyond compare.
[39:11] In that place that's called heaven. Oh
[39:15] my soul longs to be
[39:19] for where Jesus
[39:22] is, it will be heaven for me. Let's all
[39:27] sing it. Oh, heaven
[39:30] for me.
[39:32] Oh, heaven
[39:35] for me. Oh Jesus
[39:39] will be what makes it heaven
[39:43] for me. All its beauty and its wonders
[39:50] all I've been longing
[39:53] to see.
[39:55] Oh Jesus
[39:58] will be what makes it heaven
[40:02] for me.
[40:04] Oh, if walls there weren't jasper, and
[40:09] if the streets were
[40:11] not gold.
[40:13] Oh, if mansions
[40:16] would glisten.
[40:18] Oh, and if folks still grew old, still
[40:23] I'd see
[40:25] everything
[40:27] I've been longing
[40:30] to see.
[40:32] For if Jesus
[40:35] is there, he'll make it heaven.
[40:39] Sing it with me. Love him. Oh, heaven
[40:44] for me.
[40:46] Oh, heaven
[40:49] for me.
[40:52] Oh, Jesus
[40:54] will be what makes it heaven
[40:58] for me.
[41:00] All its beauty
[41:03] and its wonders
[41:05] I've been longing
[41:08] to see.
[41:11] Oh Jesus
[41:13] will be what makes it heaven
[41:17] for me.
[41:19] Oh heaven
[41:22] for me.
[41:25] Lord heaven
[41:27] for me.
[41:30] Jesus
[41:32] will be what makes it heaven
[41:37] for me. All its beauty
[41:42] and his wonders
[41:44] I've been longing
[41:47] to see.

[41:52] will be what makes it heaven
[41:57] for me.

[47:22] I'm an overcomer
[47:26] by the blood of the lamb
[47:31] and by the word
[47:34] my testimony.
[47:38] Anybody got a testimony this morning?
[47:46] We got some testimonies here this
[47:48] morning.
[47:50] All right. How about if I share a little
[47:51] something this morning?
[47:54] Last night I you you saw how I was
[47:56] nervous like ever before and I battled
[47:58] with one quote in particular about we're
[48:00] battling with blind spirits.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; You you remember the quote I I told you
[48:04] to pay real close attention. Sometimes
[48:06] you start talking through scriptures and
[48:08] a man of God doesn't exactly know what
[48:10] he's doing, but he's just following the
[48:12] leadership of the Lord. And I fought so
[48:13] hard about putting that quote in there
[48:15] last night. I fought so hard. Even back
[48:18] there in the back, I was just so tore up
[48:19] about it. And I said, "No, God, you you
[48:21] dropped that in my heart. I'm just going
[48:22] to I'm just going to drop it." And I
[48:23] realize now what it was. It was Satan
[48:25] battling me because we got a testimony
[48:27] in here.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; We got a testimony in here. Because two
[48:32] years ago, Brother Teddy went through a
[48:34] camp meeting there in Louisiana and he
[48:36] wanted his healing in his eyesight. He
[48:39] come out of that meeting and he crushed
[48:41] he crushed his glasses. Said, "I'm done
[48:44] with these things." I want I I respect a
[48:46] man that's got that kind of faith. Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; That's that's powerful faith right
[48:50] there. But yet he still he his eyes were
[48:54] about perfect except for one eye.
[48:55] Correct.
[48:57] Well, last night while the Lord was
[48:59] moving, Brother Teddy got his complete
[49:01] healing last night.
[49:07] Anybody else got a testimony this
[49:09] morning? They want to thank the Lord for
[49:12] that's no small thing.
[49:15] God honors our faith.
[49:19] Key of F.
[49:20] [Music]
[49:22] Oh, as I look out across the land, I see
[49:26] God's mighty hand. The bride of Christ
[49:30] adorning a wedding gust
[49:34] like in the days of old. Well, they
[49:38] stood in courage and they took that old

[52:23] We the new test. We rise.
[52:28] [Music]
[52:29] If you think it's all long gone and the
[52:33] miracles are done, Brother Teddy said,
[52:37] "I've got some good news to bring to
[52:39] you."
[52:42] In the last days, he will pour of his
[52:46] spirit more and more. And like a mighty
[52:49] king with your strength, he'll renew.
[52:54] And we'll rise above.
[52:57] We rising up

[53:05] Are you a part of that number?
[53:08] Are you glad to be identified as a New
[53:11] Testament church?

[1:03:43] CT Stud made this statement or po poetry
[1:03:48] and CT Stud I'm not going to give you
[1:03:50] his life story but he would
[1:03:53] he would create this and it would become
[1:03:55] almost scripture. He was a man that gave
[1:03:58] up wealth and gave up a lot of different
[1:04:00] types of careers like sports to become a
[1:04:04] preacher.
[1:04:05] And he says these words and they're so
[1:04:07] profound. only one life to live and it
[1:04:11] will soon be passed.
[1:04:14] What we have did for Jesus
[1:04:17] is the only thing that's going to last.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Matthew chap 28 and verse
[1:04:24] 18.
[1:04:41] I want to announce my text this morning
[1:04:43] and I don't want you to get carnal with
[1:04:45] me. But
[1:04:47] the time we have left to live
[1:04:51] and brother Matt McClar said anybody can
[1:04:54] preach this sermon. I can preach it. But
[1:04:56] all of us are terminal without a
[1:04:58] rapture.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; All of us. All of us are terminal
[1:05:02] without a rapture. We came we came from
[1:05:05] the dust of the earth and to the dust of
[1:05:07] the earth we will return. But we become
[1:05:10] more conscious when we begin to fight
[1:05:12] heart issues or or cancer issues or
[1:05:15] begin to take chemo. And and and and we
[1:05:18] have taken chemo for five years now. And
[1:05:21] and um
[1:05:24] and uh this subject came to me on Monday
[1:05:26] morning. And uh so here we are. And
[1:05:31] every one of us have to look at the days
[1:05:33] that we have. And so I I want to share a
[1:05:36] few thoughts that are on my heart with
[1:05:38] you.
[1:05:40] Matthew chap 28 and verse 18. These are
[1:05:43] the last words
[1:05:46] that will be with Jesus in two passages
[1:05:49] I'm going to read. And Jesus came and
[1:05:51] spake unto them, saying, "All power is
[1:05:55] given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go
[1:05:59] ye therefore and teach all nations,
[1:06:01] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[1:06:03] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
[1:06:07] teaching them to observe all things,
[1:06:09] whatsoever I command you. And lo, I am
[1:06:12] with you always, even
[1:06:15] unto the end of the world. We know that
[1:06:18] baptism was in the name of the Lord
[1:06:19] Jesus Christ according to Acts chapter 2
[1:06:22] and verse 38. Acts chapter 1, he will
[1:06:25] speak again.
[1:06:27] And when they therefore were come
[1:06:29] together, they asked him, saying,
[1:06:33] Lord, will thou at this time restore
[1:06:37] again the kingdom of Israel? Now, I want
[1:06:40] you to think about it. They have seen
[1:06:42] the resurrection Christ, and they're
[1:06:44] still thinking about him going to be the
[1:06:47] king on this earth, but he didn't come
[1:06:50] that that time to be the king, but he
[1:06:54] will come.
[1:06:56] And he said unto them, "It is not for
[1:06:58] you to know the times or the seasons
[1:07:03] which the Father hath put in his own
[1:07:04] power, but you shall receive power after
[1:07:08] that the Holy Ghost has come unto you.
[1:07:11] And you shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:07:13] in Jerusalem,
[1:07:15] and in Judea, and in Samaria,
[1:07:19] and unto the uttermost parts of the
[1:07:21] earth." And when he had thus spoken
[1:07:24] these things, while they beheld, he was
[1:07:27] taken up, and a cloud received him out
[1:07:31] of their sight.
[1:07:33] I can not imagine the presence that they
[1:07:36] were standing in.
[1:07:39] While they looked up steadfastly toward
[1:07:41] heaven, as he went up, behold, two men
[1:07:45] stood
[1:07:47] stood by them in white raignment,
[1:07:51] which also said, "Ye men of Galilee,
[1:07:55] why stand you here gazing up into
[1:07:58] heaven? The same Jesus which is taken up
[1:08:02] from you into heaven shall so come in
[1:08:07] like manner as you have seen him go into
[1:08:11] heaven. You may be seated this morning.
[1:08:14] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:08:15] word.
[1:08:30] I was I was just I was just impressed
[1:08:34] yesterday morning to share a couple of
[1:08:37] stories with you. We are we're preparing
[1:08:40] to go to brother Tom Rays, brother
[1:08:42] Bisclls, brother Michael Rays to for
[1:08:44] their for their camp meeting and we've
[1:08:47] been invited we've spoke that several
[1:08:50] times now and brother Andrew and brother
[1:08:52] Matthew are going to be there with me
[1:08:55] and speak in that meeting as well. And
[1:08:58] sometimes the new ones among us don't
[1:09:00] quite understand connections or how
[1:09:03] we're connected and but we're connected
[1:09:05] by the message of the hour
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; by a supernatural realm of of what God
[1:09:11] has done for us in our lives. And so I I
[1:09:15] in 1978 sat in the meetings that brother
[1:09:18] Biscllow would preach here in Virginia
[1:09:21] and he would tell he would tell about
[1:09:23] brother Brandham and their stories and
[1:09:26] he would once again do that in Lime,
[1:09:28] Ohio. Then he would do it brother Tim
[1:09:29] Fruitz and of course he would do that at
[1:09:31] at his own church. Through the years, I
[1:09:34] began to be known to brother Biscll and
[1:09:36] we begin to be friends and then it was
[1:09:39] at the meetings at Billy Andrews that
[1:09:41] every year at the Thanksgiving meetings
[1:09:43] and that was my mother and father's
[1:09:45] anniversary and so they would attend
[1:09:47] that meeting and we would attend it as
[1:09:49] well. Then he would preach at brother
[1:09:51] Henry Greens and brother Dan's and then
[1:09:53] brother Joe's later at the camp meeting
[1:09:56] there that the mission meeting that's
[1:09:57] getting ready to go on here in a week or
[1:09:59] so. And so he would preach those
[1:10:01] meetings and then of course he spoke
[1:10:04] here several times and and he just
[1:10:07] phenomenal services that we had here and
[1:10:09] then we would be at their place and then
[1:10:11] at brother Tim Puit's place and we would
[1:10:14] have quite a bit of time together. one
[1:10:17] particular occasion
[1:10:19] uh maybe about 15 years ago uh he called
[1:10:23] me one morning and he said, "Brother
[1:10:24] Ron, I' I would like for you to come
[1:10:27] with me and speak at Switzerland and I
[1:10:30] I'd like for you to do that and come
[1:10:33] every year and be with it with me and
[1:10:35] speak those meetings." And and I'll be
[1:10:38] honest with you, I had no illusion that
[1:10:40] I would do that. And I just told him, I
[1:10:42] said, "Brother Biscll, I I I definitely
[1:10:44] can't do that this year. I already have
[1:10:46] meetings planned. And he said, "So plan
[1:10:48] next year to to come to the meeting." So
[1:10:51] we were there about nine I'm I'm
[1:10:54] thinking nine years together
[1:10:55] successfully one back to another. And we
[1:10:58] would see a lot of supernatural events
[1:11:00] take place. And in those in those
[1:11:03] meetings and one right after another
[1:11:05] through the meetings and through the
[1:11:06] times that we would have and it was just
[1:11:09] glorious times.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He came to a spot in his life to
[1:11:13] where that he would have a he would have
[1:11:15] a heart attack and and u and so he would
[1:11:20] have a heart attack and they were going
[1:11:21] to have to do open heart surgery on him
[1:11:24] and it was a midday for us and our me
[1:11:28] and the boys were together and we was in
[1:11:30] a was actually in a pickup truck and he
[1:11:33] said, "Brother Ron, I'm sitting on the
[1:11:34] side of the bed and I've got some
[1:11:36] decisions to make. They're going to do
[1:11:38] open heart surgery." He said, 'I'd like
[1:11:40] for you to pray for me. I believe God
[1:11:42] would speak to me and give me strength
[1:11:44] in in in the prayer. So, we begin to
[1:11:48] pray in the truck. And you could feel
[1:11:50] the presence of God just drop in that
[1:11:54] truck. as we were praying and we were
[1:11:58] praying that God would anoint a doctor
[1:12:01] to step forward. Maybe even not even a
[1:12:05] doctor that has been on the scene, but
[1:12:07] another doctor that would step forth
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; and and he would be anointed for the
[1:12:13] challenge to help brother Biscll that
[1:12:16] this surgery might be easier. Not going
[1:12:18] to tell the long story, but the very
[1:12:21] last day he had been attended by a lot
[1:12:24] of doctors, but the very last day, a
[1:12:28] doctor from either New Zealand or
[1:12:30] Australia was in the in the building and
[1:12:33] he came in and he was a young man. He
[1:12:35] came in and shook brother Ed's hand and
[1:12:38] he said, "I'll be doing your surgery
[1:12:39] today."
[1:12:43] And he said, "Now, I don't do it like a
[1:12:46] lot of other doctors do it. Other
[1:12:48] doctors take your heart out of your
[1:12:51] chest and work on it." He said, "But I
[1:12:54] have a new procedure that I do and it'll
[1:12:56] be much easier on you and
[1:13:00] and and you'll be okay."
[1:13:03] And he remembered that prayer. This is
[1:13:06] exactly the prayer that was prayed.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The next time I was at
[1:13:11] brother Bisclls and
[1:13:14] and he wasn't supposed to be moving
[1:13:16] about, but he couldn't help to come but
[1:13:18] come out and have dinner with me and
[1:13:20] share those things.
[1:13:22] It was things like that that we watched
[1:13:24] through the years that were supernatural
[1:13:27] events that linked us together.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; A lot of things and to which I'm not
[1:13:34] really going to go into, but God links
[1:13:37] us all together.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] He has a way that the Holy Ghost can
[1:13:43] move and shows us in supernatural ways
[1:13:46] that I'm with you. I'm in all of this.
[1:13:51] A couple of years ago, the family of
[1:13:54] brother Tom Ray was with us and the all
[1:13:56] three boys was here. All three of those
[1:13:59] boys were supernaturally born because
[1:14:01] they couldn't have any children. So they
[1:14:04] would go to brother Biscll and say, "We
[1:14:06] would like another child." And so every
[1:14:09] time they would go, God would somehow in
[1:14:12] his supernatural thinking would bring
[1:14:15] would bring those children on the scene.
[1:14:18] And so and so anyway, they were here.
[1:14:21] The Lord had spoken to me before they
[1:14:24] came because I thought of it deep. God,
[1:14:27] you're in the arrangements kind of in
[1:14:29] the arrangements of maybe why you're
[1:14:31] here today.
[1:14:36] God don't do anything accidental.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He's not just moving things around just
[1:14:41] to see if he can move these around. And
[1:14:43] so all three of the boys was here, their
[1:14:46] wives. And that was quite an incredible
[1:14:47] thing to to be able to get them here,
[1:14:50] their wives, and some of their children
[1:14:51] was here. And I was just praying and I
[1:14:56] was praying about it and had great
[1:14:57] thought. I what what is this all about?
[1:15:02] And the Lord spoke to me and said,
[1:15:04] "Deliver these words unto them." And so,
[1:15:08] and so anyway, the meeting came. We had
[1:15:11] a lot of fellowship together. And then,
[1:15:14] and then we found oursel in the living
[1:15:16] room between between Brother Andrew's
[1:15:18] house and my house. And and it was just
[1:15:21] just the right arrangement was there.
[1:15:24] Sister Connie was in the kitchen.
[1:15:27] And so, well, I begin to share with them
[1:15:29] a story. I looked at this and and God is
[1:15:33] in the details of having you all here.
[1:15:36] And so, I just shared with them that the
[1:15:39] Lord spoke to me to to share some words
[1:15:42] with you.
[1:15:44] I didn't know how powerful they would
[1:15:46] be. But when I shared these words
[1:15:51] with the family, the Holy Ghost just
[1:15:54] fell.
[1:15:56] It just fell in the room. And when it
[1:15:59] fell in the room,
[1:16:02] those boys went on their knees and
[1:16:04] weeping and crying out to God. One of
[1:16:07] the daughter-in-laws, one of the one of
[1:16:10] the grandchildren's
[1:16:12] daughter-in-laws received the Holy
[1:16:14] Ghost. Sister Connie was in the kitchen.
[1:16:17] She be to worship the presence of the
[1:16:20] Lord. When they went back home,
[1:16:24] Brother Sam was he's a businessman.
[1:16:28] When they went back home, him being a
[1:16:31] businessman
[1:16:33] and in some in some of the words that
[1:16:35] was said to him that God was going to
[1:16:37] bless them and he's going to
[1:16:39] supernaturally bless them.
[1:16:42] He went back home and I believe it was
[1:16:44] the next Friday.
[1:16:47] He got a call
[1:16:49] and there was there was a man that had
[1:16:52] three businesses that was linked that
[1:16:55] they did some work together and he said,
[1:16:58] "I don't know why that that I'm even
[1:17:00] calling you, but I'm calling you. I want
[1:17:02] you to bring your checkbook to my
[1:17:05] office. I'm going to sell you
[1:17:10] three businesses today.
[1:17:13] Now, we're not talking about small stuff
[1:17:15] here.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; This is the kind of stuff that you would
[1:17:18] think about taking months to consider,
[1:17:21] but because of the the the what was
[1:17:24] spoken to him in the living room and the
[1:17:27] power of God fell,
[1:17:30] God worked out all the details.
[1:17:45] We were in Switzerland.
[1:17:47] Hope this is okay to tell. We were in
[1:17:50] Switzerland and I was speaking a sermon
[1:17:52] called what will you be remembered for?
[1:17:55] And let me just let me just say this
[1:17:57] before I go any further. When we tell
[1:17:59] these stories,
[1:18:01] remember this. I can do nothing.
[1:18:05] Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; I am only
[1:18:10] the instrument just like these guys are
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; through which God can use.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; We can't make it happen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; It's all in God's control.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; And I was speaking a sermon on what will
[1:18:26] you be remembered for? And let me just
[1:18:29] give you a little background.
[1:18:32] I had become so sick in Switzerland.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; It was the sickest I'd ever been as far
[1:18:38] as throwing up. This is before cancer.
[1:18:42] Throwing up, it was uncontrollable.
[1:18:44] I called Connie in the middle of the
[1:18:46] night, which which would be late
[1:18:48] evening. I called her in the middle of
[1:18:50] the night and she heard me. She heard me
[1:18:52] doing all of that and I said, "I just
[1:18:54] need help. Get the people to pray for
[1:18:56] me. It's in the middle of the night.
[1:18:58] Nobody's up. I'm so sick. I can't even
[1:19:01] go out into the hall. And we begin to
[1:19:04] pray together. And Brother Glenn Grunert
[1:19:07] came to my room and knocked on the door
[1:19:09] and said, "Brother Ron, I felt impressed
[1:19:11] for you to to come and knock on your
[1:19:13] door. What's going on?"
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And he brought me a bottle. I I should
[1:19:19] have a bottle of that now cuz it could
[1:19:21] cure cancer.
[1:19:28] So by the next morning it was as though
[1:19:30] it never happened.
[1:19:32] And so I went but I was weak and I just
[1:19:35] asked that I could trade a service and
[1:19:38] and so one of the brothers was so
[1:19:40] graceful to to trade a service with me.
[1:19:42] So I would speak on Monday morning which
[1:19:45] would be the last service of the
[1:19:47] meeting. And so, and I spoke that sermon
[1:19:50] and in that sermon, God was just moving
[1:19:54] in a very in a very special way. And
[1:19:57] Brother Biscll said, "I I've got to get
[1:19:59] to prayer. I've got to get to brother
[1:20:01] Ron to get to prayer."
[1:20:03] And so, and so he said he compared that
[1:20:06] meeting to another meeting. I'm not
[1:20:08] going to share that, but and so anyway,
[1:20:11] he
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I prayed for some on the
[1:20:14] stage and then and then I just
[1:20:16] disappeared. The deacons came and got me
[1:20:18] and I I prayed for I think it was
[1:20:20] brother Joshua Vanderbront and he just
[1:20:23] he just collapsed on the floor. And then
[1:20:25] as I stepped forward, Brother Biscll was
[1:20:27] with his wife and his daughter and he
[1:20:30] just shared what he needed and he said,
[1:20:32] "I've been working on a project for 12
[1:20:34] years and he said, I've got the best of
[1:20:36] the best of the best trying to perform
[1:20:39] this project for me." And he said 12
[1:20:41] years we have not been able 12 years we
[1:20:44] have not been able to form it. I want
[1:20:47] you to pray.
[1:20:50] We prayed and as we prayed the spirit of
[1:20:53] the Lord dealt with us and as we prayed.
[1:21:00] He went back home
[1:21:04] and about three months later he called
[1:21:06] me and I was walking on my driveway and
[1:21:09] he said, "Brother Ron," and he was
[1:21:11] excited, "Brother Ron, I've got to tell
[1:21:13] you something." He said, "You remember
[1:21:15] when I came to you at Switzerland?" I
[1:21:17] said, "I do." He said, "Do you know we'd
[1:21:20] worked on that for 12 years and it was
[1:21:22] impossible to make happen? Just
[1:21:25] impossible to make happen." He said, '
[1:21:28] Did you know I got home? It's 90 days
[1:21:32] later and it's over.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, we serve an
[1:21:40] incredible God.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; An incredible God.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; How many on the YouTube has seen Brother
[1:21:50] Biscll interview Charlie Mitchell?
[1:21:55] Brother Charlie Mitchell was a preacher
[1:21:57] that I grew up with that operated
[1:21:59] brother Falter's church and also was a
[1:22:01] pastor in a place called Coburn,
[1:22:03] Virginia. Does anybody know where Coburn
[1:22:06] Virginia is at? Sure you do. You're from
[1:22:08] that you're from that country. And
[1:22:10] brother Charlie, brother Charlie was the
[1:22:12] kind of guy that he was the kind of
[1:22:14] preacher he called himself a shotgun
[1:22:16] preacher.
[1:22:18] He said, "I'll just shoot all over the
[1:22:19] tree. I know I'll get you.
[1:22:24] And so anyway, I I witnessed him one
[1:22:27] night. He was preaching and there was a
[1:22:28] baby that was screaming and crying and
[1:22:30] screaming and crying. That was before
[1:22:32] nurseries and uh Yeah. And so there was
[1:22:36] screaming and crying and Charlie just
[1:22:37] went and got that baby and he preached
[1:22:40] with that baby in his arm and that baby
[1:22:43] was as quiet.
[1:22:48] No, I'm not going to come get your baby.
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:54] And you can keep your squeaky toy, too.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ron, children
[1:23:07] disturb me." Well, you know, go to an
[1:23:09] old folks home. You'll appreciate kids.
[1:23:16] So, so anyway, Charlie had had cancer in
[1:23:20] his lung and brother Fulture took him to
[1:23:24] brother Brandham's meeting and so they
[1:23:26] couldn't get a prayer card, so they sat
[1:23:29] in the very back of the building. I
[1:23:30] heard Charlie tell it over and over
[1:23:32] again in the back of the building. And
[1:23:34] so, he sat in the back of the building.
[1:23:36] They were disappointed. They didn't have
[1:23:38] a prayer card. Actually, brother Falter
[1:23:40] and brother Charlie was separated
[1:23:42] sitting in the back of the building and
[1:23:44] here he had a tumor on his left lung and
[1:23:47] and he was up to die. He's up for an
[1:23:49] operation. You know, back in those days,
[1:23:51] they just didn't give you much hope at
[1:23:53] all. And so he was sitting in the back
[1:23:55] of the building and and brother Brandham
[1:23:58] begin to discern
[1:24:00] and he discerned one. It was right in
[1:24:02] front of brother Charlie. And then
[1:24:04] brother Charlie said, "I saw an eye
[1:24:06] about that big staring me down."
[1:24:10] And brother Ramon began to discern,
[1:24:12] "Brother Charlie, and you have a tumor
[1:24:14] on your left lung. You're not from here.
[1:24:16] You're from West Virginia." The doctors
[1:24:19] and they begin to go, he went right down
[1:24:21] the line. Precise, totally accurate,
[1:24:24] exactly right. Go home, be well.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Well, he went right back to the same
[1:24:30] doctors. And when he got back home to
[1:24:33] the same doctors and they began to take
[1:24:35] the X-rays all over again, Brother
[1:24:37] Charlie was 100% healed.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Biscll, this is in the
[1:24:51] early days. Brother Biscll came to to
[1:24:54] Virginia to the meetings and he took
[1:24:57] brother
[1:24:59] Charlie Mitchell to to um to one of the
[1:25:04] uh television broadcast. And so and so
[1:25:07] anyway, they went there. They went to
[1:25:09] the studio. They had set it up and they
[1:25:11] went there. They sat down and all the
[1:25:14] lights were on. The cameras started
[1:25:15] rolling. Brother Biscll introduces
[1:25:18] Brother Charlie Mitchell. They start
[1:25:19] talking and they're 30 minutes exactly
[1:25:24] to the tea. Well, they had just had a
[1:25:27] politician there
[1:25:30] trying to do a minute commercial and it
[1:25:33] took them hours to do a com a minute
[1:25:36] commercial with that politician. And
[1:25:38] here, Brother Buscoll comes with brother
[1:25:40] Charlie Mitchell. They sat down and they
[1:25:43] tell the story. 30 minutes right on the
[1:25:46] dot. It was over. And the director said,
[1:25:51] "We just had a politician here
[1:25:56] and it took him hours to do a minute
[1:25:58] commercial
[1:26:01] and here you do a 30 minute interview
[1:26:06] and you don't take a break at all." He
[1:26:07] said, "Well, the difference is we're
[1:26:09] telling the truth.
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:21] So
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; So I I I'll jump through a lot of stuff.
[1:26:25] So the first meeting the first meeting
[1:26:29] that I will speak
[1:26:32] is at brother Bisclls and brother Tom
[1:26:34] Rays after I received the diagnosis of
[1:26:37] cancer was in my lungs. We didn't have
[1:26:39] it that was in my brain yet, but we had
[1:26:42] it that was in our lungs.
[1:26:44] And so they said he'd be getting an
[1:26:46] important call.
[1:26:48] Five minutes before brother Tom would
[1:26:50] pick me up, I got the call.
[1:26:54] That night I would be preaching on
[1:26:56] courage, not knowing anything.
[1:26:59] And I'm preaching in brother Biscll's
[1:27:01] pullpit
[1:27:03] with cancer in the lungs. And I thought,
[1:27:07] how fitting that God is.
[1:27:11] I was raised with the man that did that
[1:27:14] interview
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; that was healed by being in the meeting
[1:27:19] with William Brham
[1:27:21] and here I am speaking at brother
[1:27:23] Biscll's on courage
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; and they're giving me a terminal
[1:27:30] diagnosis
[1:27:32] cancer in my lungs and in a few days it
[1:27:34] will be cancer in the brain.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this God's in control.
[1:27:44] when he begins to leak up friends and
[1:27:47] neighbors and from across the world.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Without this message, we would not have
[1:27:52] known one another.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; But God had a book.
[1:28:07] He knows exactly how to release your
[1:28:09] seed of life into the earth.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; You'll not come a day early
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; or a day late.
[1:28:19] He knows exactly because in God's
[1:28:22] pre-planning,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; he knows you've got to be born under a
[1:28:27] certain, don't get lost here, under a
[1:28:29] certain zodiac sign
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; that will form your nature
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; and not out of bounds. I'm right with
[1:28:35] the message.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly because he knows he
[1:28:41] wants you a certain way.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Don't never get discouraged whether
[1:28:45] you're too tall, too short. Come on.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Too small, too fluffy.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Whether you're a type A personality or
[1:28:58] whether you're extremely quiet,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; some will dance and shout.
[1:29:03] [Applause]
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Some will scream and turn quiet wheels.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Others will stand still and tears will
[1:29:10] run out of their eyes. It's all God's
[1:29:13] planning.
[1:29:23] He'll have us all born under in a in a
[1:29:25] certain way, in a certain place.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Your mother will eat your body out of
[1:29:31] the ground of the earth.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; I find it amazing. I'm off target topic
[1:29:38] now, but Brother Brown said, "She'll eat
[1:29:40] your body out of this cursed earth."
[1:29:43] Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; God knew the potassium that he would put
[1:29:47] in the ground. He was preparing you
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; when he was saying, "Let there be."
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Yes, sir.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; I think about an amazing God
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; that had us to be a born in this certain
[1:30:13] age to believe the message of the hour.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; We could have been born in Luther, but
[1:30:20] that wasn't our time.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; We could have been born in Wesley, but
[1:30:24] that wasn't our time. We could have been
[1:30:26] born in Pentecost, but that wasn't our
[1:30:29] time.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You remember the life has to come
[1:30:32] through the stalk.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; And and listen, they were they were
[1:30:36] phenomenal revivals that God was with
[1:30:39] them,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; but they could not believe in their
[1:30:42] denominational system that the life
[1:30:45] would pass,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:48] And they would constantly be trying to
[1:30:50] you ought to have been here when it
[1:30:51] happened or trying to rebuild that
[1:30:53] revival or try to relive that revival.
[1:30:56] But once it passes,
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; once that life travels through, it
[1:31:02] travels and it'll never return to that.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Now even you
[1:31:13] every day is important.
[1:31:18] That's the theme of this sermon.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Every day that you live is important.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:31:26] I read a statement the other day that
[1:31:28] says you may not control everything in
[1:31:30] your life,
[1:31:35] but you do control how you live the day
[1:31:38] that's in front of you.
[1:31:42] your attitude,
[1:31:43] your disposition,
[1:31:45] your faith in the Lord.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Job would begin to say things like this
[1:31:51] in Job chapter 14 and verse 5. Now we're
[1:31:54] beginning. You can set your clocks now.
[1:31:56] You can begin.
[1:31:59] See, and his days are determined. God
[1:32:01] knows exactly how long you'll be here.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; The number of his days are with thee.
[1:32:07] Thou hast appointed his bounds
[1:32:11] that he cannot pass.
[1:32:14] Psalms 39 and4. Lord, make me to know
[1:32:19] mine end
[1:32:21] and the measure of my days, what it is
[1:32:25] that I may know how frail
[1:32:28] that I am. That's right.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; You know, when you're when you're 18
[1:32:32] years old and you're full of strength,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; you're full of you can run like a deer.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; You got a lot of strength inside of you.
[1:32:41] You You think
[1:32:44] I'm going to live forever.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're out of bounds. Well,
[1:32:48] Brother Brandon said he was sitting at
[1:32:49] the table and he looked up at his daddy,
[1:32:52] right?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Had those curls in his hair, those
[1:32:55] strong shoulders. He said, "My daddy
[1:32:58] will live forever."
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham couldn't understand
[1:33:03] as a little boy what the cycles of life
[1:33:05] was.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; But but years later, he would hold
[1:33:10] brother Brandham in his arms or he he'd
[1:33:13] hold his father in his arms and he would
[1:33:16] expire from this life
[1:33:21] trauma event.
[1:33:24] Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 27 says,
[1:33:29] "And as it is appointed unto men
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; once to die,
[1:33:36] and after that this the judgment."
[1:33:39] There's only a couple places in the
[1:33:40] scripture where this don't work. Lazarus
[1:33:43] came back,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; but he had to die again.
[1:33:47] In Proverbs chapter 27, do not boast
[1:33:51] about tomorrow,
[1:33:53] for you do not know what that do day
[1:33:58] may bring.
[1:34:01] Psalms chapter 39 and verse 4, show me
[1:34:04] Lord my life's end and the number of my
[1:34:08] days.
[1:34:10] Let me know how fleeting my life is.
[1:34:13] David was asking these questions.
[1:34:16] And I know some of this is from a
[1:34:18] different translation, but you just hang
[1:34:19] with me. Galatians chapter 6 and verse
[1:34:22] 9. Let me
[1:34:25] let us not grow weary
[1:34:29] in welloing.
[1:34:33] For in the proper time we shall reap
[1:34:37] if we faint not.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 1 and verse 21. For
[1:34:41] to me to live is Christ, but to die is
[1:34:47] gain.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; You're familiar with this quote. Brother
[1:34:52] Rand will say this. He says, "As you
[1:34:54] begin to see the days of your life
[1:34:57] drawing close,
[1:34:59] then it begins it begins to you begin to
[1:35:04] pack up closer getting ready for that
[1:35:06] great event.
[1:35:08] It's a continuing of this life. life in
[1:35:11] another world, another place.
[1:35:16] Then he will say this, your birth
[1:35:20] here was pre-planned.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; I guess you believe that. I absolutely
[1:35:26] do.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that our birth
[1:35:30] was pre-planned. Did you know that your
[1:35:33] being here never originated as a myth or
[1:35:35] a thought? Everything was all
[1:35:38] pre-planned by God before the foundation
[1:35:41] of the world.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; That you would be here. The infinite God
[1:35:46] knowed.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; The infinite God knowed. And to be
[1:35:52] infinite, he had to know every flea that
[1:35:54] would ever be in the earth. How many
[1:35:57] times it would bat its eye. Boy, he went
[1:35:59] to the extreme on that one.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's infinite. See you, our
[1:36:06] little minds cannot fathom what infinite
[1:36:10] means. The infinite God, he knowed all
[1:36:15] things.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be." We was in
[1:36:21] his mind.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; When the clinker of the earth fell off
[1:36:26] of the sun, we was in his mind.
[1:36:29] Before anything that was ever formed, we
[1:36:33] was in his mind.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Before he was even called God.
[1:36:48] When you buy a used car,
[1:36:54] it's one of the greatest gamles you'll
[1:36:55] ever make in your life.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; When you buy a used car, no matter what
[1:37:02] it is,
[1:37:05] you're only buying
[1:37:07] what's left, the life in that car.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Now, that car may have been $140,000
[1:37:16] new. Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; But when it's got 120,000 miles on it
[1:37:25] with Katie driving it,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; you would not be a good businessman
[1:37:39] to buy that car.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; To buy that car at its original price.
[1:37:46] That's right. Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; So, you want it at an extremely
[1:37:50] discounted price
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and then you want a good mechanic
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; cuz now you're the individual that's
[1:38:02] going to have to work on it.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Well, what's buying a car have to do
[1:38:09] with me sitting here today?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; You've only got so much life left on
[1:38:13] your speedometer.
[1:38:22] Are you with me? You've only got so much
[1:38:24] life on your adometer,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but I'm going to live
[1:38:29] forever. I don't know what you've been
[1:38:30] reading,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; I I don't know exactly what you've been
[1:38:37] gobbling in, but I don't care how many
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; OS that you have.
[1:38:45] herbs that you have,
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; vitamins that you're taking.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; When you pass 21 years old, you start
[1:38:54] dying.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had doctors. Talking to
[1:39:01] those doctors, he would ask them, said,
[1:39:03] "I eat the same thing that I ate as a
[1:39:05] boy."
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, you eat better. Now you
[1:39:11] got money.
[1:39:13] So you you eat the same thing. You you
[1:39:16] drank the same thing before you were
[1:39:19] growing
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; and you thought about I want to be 6'
[1:39:24] tall. That was a dream for me. If I can
[1:39:26] get to 6' tall
[1:39:29] somewhere seven inches didn't come.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; So I had to be satisfied
[1:39:39] with running behind guys like this as a
[1:39:42] running back.
[1:39:44] But I want you to understand now you're
[1:39:47] eating the same thing that you did.
[1:39:50] You're trying to eat better,
[1:39:53] but it seems like as you progress in
[1:39:55] life, you're getting weaker.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Your muscles are deteriorating. Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would
[1:40:08] would begin to, you know, think about.
[1:40:11] Brother Brandon,
[1:40:13] I've been around this forever, but
[1:40:15] Brother Brandham, when he when he got
[1:40:16] near 50 years old, he had some sort of a
[1:40:19] complex that he felt like he was an old
[1:40:21] man. Now, you guys that are 85 here
[1:40:24] today, when you were 50, you felt like
[1:40:26] you was young. You would look back on it
[1:40:29] say, "Well, I was young. I was young at
[1:40:31] 50." But brother Brown had a lot of
[1:40:33] miles on his odometer.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; We could say seven times around the
[1:40:39] world, preaching in very difficult
[1:40:41] places, huge coliseums that he would
[1:40:44] preach at to huge crowds of people under
[1:40:47] extreme pressure. He's just not another
[1:40:49] preacher. He He's a prophet.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; It's dispensational change time. And
[1:40:56] he's delivered the word. It's hard on
[1:40:58] his natural body
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; and he's even even contemplating maybe
[1:41:02] going into the mountains to stay because
[1:41:05] the pressure was so hard on his body.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; It was difficult on his body and he
[1:41:11] could see his end coming.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; He could see I I can't do this forever.
[1:41:17] I can see my end coming.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; And in doing that he would preach
[1:41:21] sermons like sers is this the time?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:41:27] He would preach sermons that would begin
[1:41:29] to grip what that what that clock is
[1:41:32] doing to his life.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if we feel that way
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; do we stop and understand as that clock
[1:41:47] is ticking we will not relive yesterday.
[1:41:54] I want to drop a couple of very simple
[1:41:56] principles here.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; You won't relive yesterday.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; What Satan beats you with in your past
[1:42:06] life, it's gone.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ has taken care
[1:42:11] of it and it's gone.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Can I say it? You can't relive it. You
[1:42:20] can ask God to forgive you.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And God will wipe away
[1:42:27] and then there's no more condemnation to
[1:42:29] the them that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; But you can't do anything about
[1:42:34] yesterday. But you can sure take care of
[1:42:36] today.
[1:42:42] Brother says, "God be an infinite
[1:42:46] who cannot lie.
[1:42:50] He He cannot speak anything that's
[1:42:52] contrary.
[1:42:54] He knows everything. And just as perfect
[1:42:58] at the beginning as he is at the ending
[1:43:00] and just as perfect at the ending as at
[1:43:03] the beginning, God's endless like
[1:43:06] eternity."
[1:43:09] He said, "You can never find the corner
[1:43:12] of God's perfect circle. You can run and
[1:43:16] run through the ages and eternity, but
[1:43:18] there'll never, never, never, never,
[1:43:20] never, never, what a stress, be an end
[1:43:22] to it."
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; That's the way God is.
[1:43:31] It's mindblowing.
[1:43:33] And and when he be first that was and
[1:43:37] which always was and was infinite
[1:43:40] perfect to begin with, he'll always be
[1:43:43] the same. He'll never change.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; He's perfectly the same.
[1:43:52] Notice these words. Now this great chain
[1:43:55] of perfection was broken by time space.
[1:44:00] time can because of sin. He said, "Let's
[1:44:03] draw a picture. It's a picture a picture
[1:44:06] of a perfect circle. However, forever
[1:44:10] forever, forever and then all at once
[1:44:13] sin dropped in."
[1:44:15] And then my wife calls it a little
[1:44:17] hickey
[1:44:20] or a little drop in the chain. And so it
[1:44:23] comes down. Eternity continues on, but
[1:44:25] it's not in its perfect condition. And
[1:44:28] here's a little gap that comes down and
[1:44:30] breaks over this way and goes out this
[1:44:33] way. And God had to do that because
[1:44:36] Satan caused it.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; And it dropped down to a space of time
[1:44:45] for the trying and for the perfecting
[1:44:50] and for the purging of the lost.
[1:44:53] Goded by his sovereign grace
[1:44:57] might someday
[1:44:59] lift that little hickey back or gap back
[1:45:03] into a perfect circle.
[1:45:06] Then when the roll is called up yanda,
[1:45:12] it'll be just the same
[1:45:15] time.
[1:45:17] Now time in this little loop, it loops
[1:45:20] around and Jesus was Jesus was from
[1:45:24] eternity to eternity. But he stepped
[1:45:27] into a space of time and was made flesh
[1:45:30] and came here in order to sanctify and
[1:45:34] put a streak of blood all across this
[1:45:36] place to redeem it
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; and to connect it back together.
[1:45:43] Amen.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; When he connects it back together, it's
[1:45:48] for eternity.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Makes a statement. He says,
[1:45:59] "You stepped out of time.
[1:46:02] You stepped out of eternity into time."
[1:46:08] It's just like a couple. You step out of
[1:46:12] eternity into time
[1:46:14] and maybe you can't figure out why you
[1:46:17] even fell in love with each other.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Why did she marry that guy?
[1:46:24] Why did Dorothy marry Matt?
[1:46:27] Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; She's a such a calmnatured person
[1:46:32] and he is a
[1:46:37] red bull in human flesh.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; But they stepped out of time, out of
[1:46:51] eternity into time.
[1:46:53] But that's not the end of it.
[1:46:55] They stood and got married. They had
[1:46:58] children. One of these days, they'll
[1:47:01] step back into eternity again.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; But while in time, God molded character
[1:47:08] here.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; It isn't just for no reason at all.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It isn't for just
[1:47:18] no reason at all. God's shaping
[1:47:21] character. As the prophet said, we're
[1:47:23] invited to shape our character to his
[1:47:27] character.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; This is the only place that's going to
[1:47:30] happen.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, your character is not developed
[1:47:33] in rapture morning. Your character is
[1:47:35] developed in your whole life.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; And listen, we got work to do.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Why am I still here, Brother Ron? You
[1:47:45] got work to do.
[1:47:50] I've read this several times, but I want
[1:47:52] to read it again today.
[1:47:55] Choice is huge. It's absolutely huge.
[1:47:59] Lot one time had to make a choice.
[1:48:04] It may be this morning that there will
[1:48:06] be men and women sitting here that'll
[1:48:09] make your final choice.
[1:48:13] You are today what you are because
[1:48:17] several years ago, you chose to be what
[1:48:20] you are now.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; It's pretty big.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; You are what you are right now because
[1:48:29] several years ago, you chose to be what
[1:48:33] you are now.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Now, let's take that a little further.
[1:48:42] And what you chose now will determine
[1:48:45] what you'll be five years from today.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Five years from today, you may be a
[1:48:52] missionary.
[1:48:53] Five years from today, you may be a
[1:48:55] renowned Christian. Five years from
[1:48:58] today, you may be in hell.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:06] My brother who is a minister as well had
[1:49:10] a man sitting in his office and this man
[1:49:12] was cussing him and making all kind of
[1:49:14] challenges to him tell him he was going
[1:49:17] to kill my brother.
[1:49:20] My brother couldn't do anything to calm
[1:49:22] him down. He just was at a total loss of
[1:49:24] trying to call him calm him down. That
[1:49:27] man made all kind of threats. He walked
[1:49:29] out of my brother's office said I'm
[1:49:32] going to go home. He went home
[1:49:35] and that's the last time anybody heard
[1:49:37] from him.
[1:49:39] A few days later they found him. He
[1:49:42] committed suicide.
[1:49:46] My brother was left with the with the
[1:49:49] pain of what could have I done
[1:49:51] different.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; What could have I done different to
[1:49:56] cause this man to think about his life?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; But listen, that man chose that.
[1:50:04] You're choosing today what you'll be
[1:50:06] next week.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; You're choosing today what you'll be
[1:50:08] next year.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, it's up to the pastor.
[1:50:14] Let me just say we preach the word.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And you're making a choice how I'm going
[1:50:20] to receive it.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Even sitting the building, we can sit
[1:50:24] with a critical spirit
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; and the enemy will cause us to miss the
[1:50:29] whole thing.
[1:50:32] Are you with me?
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; He builds preachers a certain way to get
[1:50:36] to certain people.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; And God develops men to be able to
[1:50:41] deliver the word of life. We're go not
[1:50:44] going to marry you. We're just
[1:50:46] responsible to preach to you.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; We're your spiritual cheerleaders. Come
[1:50:52] on, let's finish this race.
[1:51:02] Paul would said, "Let's press the mark."
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; He would say, "Let us run this race with
[1:51:08] patience." He's telling us, "You've only
[1:51:10] got a few minutes left or a few days
[1:51:13] left. Run,
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; brother, I got a bucket list that I'm
[1:51:20] trying to do. I I got to go here and I
[1:51:22] got to go there and I got to go over
[1:51:23] here. I want to see the tallest
[1:51:25] mountains. I want to go to the oceans,
[1:51:27] to the beach. I want to see this animal.
[1:51:29] I want to see that. Let me just say what
[1:51:31] should be number one.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Serving Jesus Christ.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Making 100% sure that the wedding
[1:51:48] garment fits.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Some of you that have
[1:51:56] got married and
[1:51:58] had huge weddings.
[1:52:02] You don't a week before the wedding go,
[1:52:06] "Well, I better get a dress."
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; You that's got married, you know how
[1:52:12] that works. Months come and you've got
[1:52:15] an idea how your wedding should look
[1:52:17] like and you're you're beginning to
[1:52:20] think, I I want to look a certain way.
[1:52:23] and you go to a certain tailor, you go
[1:52:25] to a certain person that could make sure
[1:52:27] that your dream becomes reality and that
[1:52:30] dress is what you're looking for. Well,
[1:52:34] you know, the groom on the other side,
[1:52:37] he just he just needs to wear clean
[1:52:40] pants.
[1:52:44] You know,
[1:52:46] you know, he may decide on a suit or
[1:52:49] maybe a tuxedo and he rents it. Now, I I
[1:52:54] listen, there's a lot of things going in
[1:52:56] that office right there on wedding days.
[1:52:59] We should have a bag
[1:53:02] of bobby pins back there.
[1:53:05] Pins that'll make things tighter. But
[1:53:09] I've also seen suits that Hey baby,
[1:53:14] you're not going to get in that.
[1:53:18] And all the king's horses and all the
[1:53:20] king's men
[1:53:23] are not going to get you in that.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you this.
[1:53:36] When it comes to this rapture message,
[1:53:40] You can't feed on all the nonsense of
[1:53:42] the world
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; and get in the dress.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Well, Ron, I need a quote. Okay, I'll
[1:53:55] give you one. I'm going paraphrase here
[1:53:57] for it because I don't have it here.
[1:53:59] Elisha,
[1:54:03] Elisha, the robe is going to be handed
[1:54:06] down to him.
[1:54:08] God didn't trim the robe to fit Elisha.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; He trimmed Elisha to fit the robe.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? This bride must be
[1:54:21] trimmed.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And arrayed in a certain way.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, God is going to have a life.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; I I don't know where you're at in your
[1:54:34] walk with life, but God's going to have
[1:54:36] a rapture.
[1:54:37] There is coming a resurrection with or
[1:54:40] without you.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; I'm sitting on the fence. You better get
[1:54:51] off.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; You better get busy.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Every sun every sunrise is a gift.
[1:55:08] I'm sorry if I'm drinking Coke here for
[1:55:10] you, but my sugar is crazy today.
[1:55:14] But every sunrise is a gift.
[1:55:20] Every heartbeat is a blessing.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes we think, I'm I'm going
[1:55:31] to put some things off.
[1:55:34] I'm gonna put some things off.
[1:55:36] I'm not going to serve the Lord now
[1:55:38] because I'm too busy
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; doing what?
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not the seals, but it'll
[1:55:48] get you to the seals.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I was stepping this I was
[1:55:53] trying to get something deep. Okay.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is deeper than a lot of you
[1:55:57] guys realize
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; cuz a lot of you wasting days and
[1:56:02] wasting time.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; You're just you're you're just not
[1:56:09] taking time seriously. You're not taking
[1:56:12] you seriously.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Not that you're not taking me serious.
[1:56:16] You're not taking you serious.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; You're the temple of the living God.
[1:56:22] Treat yourself that way.
[1:56:25] I'm not talking about other people treat
[1:56:26] treating other people. You need to do
[1:56:28] that as a Christian. But treat yourself.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; And if you will treat yourself as if God
[1:56:34] lives on the inside of you, you won't
[1:56:36] watch the wrong things. You won't listen
[1:56:38] to the wrong things. You won't
[1:56:40] participate in the wrong things.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Well, go deeper. Okay? You won't carry
[1:56:48] that critical spirit.
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:52] You go somewhere and get rid of that
[1:56:54] jealous spirit
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; cuz you can't be
[1:56:59] you can't be a Christian carrying
[1:57:01] jealousy
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; and bitterness
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; and pride.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; You've got to get rid of it
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; and replace it with love and joy and a
[1:57:13] sound mind.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Fall in love with Jesus.
[1:57:20] But this is the way my family was.
[1:57:23] Break the cycle.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm doing what other people
[1:57:41] do. Other people may not be going in no
[1:57:43] rapture.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. I have this crowd has
[1:57:48] changed over and over again. But I want
[1:57:49] you to understand I just keep preaching
[1:57:52] the same message.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I just keep preaching the same message.
[1:57:58] God's going to have a wife.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; There's going to be people here that
[1:58:04] believe this with all their hearts.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; But I had I've had a lot of goats said
[1:58:09] here.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to per personalize that.
[1:58:13] I've had a lot of goats said here. I
[1:58:15] preached the word to goats
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; and they buted their heads and they had
[1:58:20] all kinds of opinions. Listen, your
[1:58:22] opinion don't matter to me. None
[1:58:24] whatsoever.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Your feelings does not matter to me
[1:58:30] whatsoever. I keeping my eyes on the
[1:58:34] master.
[1:58:37] [Applause]
[1:59:00] and he swore by himself. Brother Brandon
[1:59:02] says this, "You're here to fulfill it.
[1:59:07] Just walk unconscious of fear.
[1:59:13] Walk unconscious of criticism.
[1:59:18] We got some teachers here in this
[1:59:19] building and I want to tell you
[1:59:23] my hat is off to you guys.
[1:59:28] I would not trade jobs with you
[1:59:34] for all the money
[1:59:38] in the world. Because no matter how good
[1:59:41] you do
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; or how difficult you do, you're going to
[1:59:47] have complaining parents.
[1:59:53] And there's going to be people complain
[1:59:55] here the day after the rapture.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; You thought I'd quit preaching.
[2:00:03] We're going to have people here complain
[2:00:05] the day after the rapture.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron didn't get me ready.
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Sweetheart, let me just say this to you.
[2:00:15] You got to get ready.
[2:00:18] [Applause]
[2:00:24] You've got to have a powerful family at
[2:00:26] home,
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; not just here.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; The work that you do at home. Church
[2:00:33] starts at home.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; You can't fuss and fight all week long
[2:00:38] and come and sit beside each other and
[2:00:40] hold each other's hands.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; You might get an Oscar for that.
[2:00:50] This ain't the place to make up.
[2:00:54] [Applause]
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; You got to pray together.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; You got to read your Bible together.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; You got to love one another. Come on.
[2:01:03] Somebody ought to be helping me preach
[2:01:04] right here.
[2:01:06] [Applause]
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Brother, that ain't spiritual. Oh,
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said he come in and he
[2:01:19] could feel the friction in the house.
[2:01:22] He could tell that she was upset.
[2:01:26] You know what he did? He went and got an
[2:01:28] apron.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; And started singing a song. And he began
[2:01:34] to wash dishes.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; He didn't give her scriptures and
[2:01:38] quotes.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Most powerful preacher in the world.
[2:01:42] Doesn't use no power.
[2:01:45] He washed the dishes.
[2:01:58] Thank you, Lord.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram, how do I cast the devil
[2:02:00] out of my wife? He said, "Well,
[2:02:03] might want to give her some roses."
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Might want to give her some chocolates.
[2:02:09] And I've said this before, sisters,
[2:02:13] if your husband this week sends you
[2:02:16] roses and chocolates,
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; you might want to ask him, "Do you think
[2:02:25] I got a demon on the inside of me?
[2:02:28] [Applause]
[2:02:41] walk unconscious of criticism. Now
[2:02:44] listen, that's huge.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; That's huge. We just we just remember a
[2:02:49] couple weeks ago I I talked to you about
[2:02:51] keeping your your spirit clean.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; It's a bigger sermon than you think it
[2:02:56] is.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; And this one is too.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you will get it tomorrow.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Walk unconscious of the world.
[2:03:05] Walk as you walk in Christ. Walk with
[2:03:07] him. Not paying any attention the right
[2:03:10] or the left. Just keep walking on. If
[2:03:12] something comes up in the church, walk
[2:03:14] with God.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; If your sickness strikes you, walk with
[2:03:18] God.
[2:03:19] If the neighbor don't like you, walk
[2:03:22] with God.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Just keep walking with God.
[2:03:33] Don't let your world fall apart
[2:03:37] because of the doctor says you got
[2:03:40] cancer.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Random said don't fear it.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But it's in my family.
[2:03:49] Heart's in my family. So I'm worried to
[2:03:51] death. I'll get it. Even if you get it,
[2:03:55] walk with God.
[2:04:00] Are you with me? Remember this. You were
[2:04:02] walking with God the day before the
[2:04:05] appointment.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, the chemo just destroys my
[2:04:13] day. No matter how bad you feel, get up.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Walk with God.
[2:04:29] Enoch one day walked like that.
[2:04:32] You know what he did? He walked all the
[2:04:35] way home with God. He got so far up the
[2:04:38] road he didn't want to come back
[2:04:40] anymore.
[2:04:43] Walk with God when the doctor says
[2:04:45] you're going to die. Walk with God.
[2:04:49] The doctor says you can't get well. Walk
[2:04:51] with God. Are you getting the picture?
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Just walk with God. That's all. For God
[2:04:57] has promised you, I'll never leave you.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Even to the end of the
[2:05:10] world.
[2:05:12] He took an oath and by a covenant that
[2:05:17] he give you that he would confirm it.
[2:05:20] Just walk with God.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Someone walked to the altar last night
[2:05:30] and said, "I'm so nervous. I'm so tore
[2:05:33] up. I'm so I you know, I I don't know. I
[2:05:37] may be I may be mental. I have a mental
[2:05:40] illness."
[2:05:41] And I said, "What you need is peace.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; What you need is peace.
[2:05:47] It don't matter what the doctor says
[2:05:49] about you. You just need peace.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Some of your homes need peace.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Some of your children needs peace.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; No matter what you're fighting, you need
[2:06:01] peace in your life.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Quit beating yourself up.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You need peace in your life.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. She wrote me a letter
[2:06:12] this morning saying, "After you prayed
[2:06:14] for me, it was a wave of peace came over
[2:06:17] me."
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "You're going to
[2:06:24] have your ups and downs." Being a
[2:06:26] Christian does not exempt you from
[2:06:29] having ups and downs.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Your checkbook's going
[2:06:37] to get low.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; But it would have got low if you'd have
[2:06:42] been serving the devil.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I just don't like paying
[2:06:48] my ties. You already did when you was in
[2:06:50] the world.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; You played You paid Bud Michel
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Miller.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; You sucked it in a straw.
[2:07:08] I never done none of those things. You
[2:07:09] went to Baltimore and watched the
[2:07:10] baseball games and paid $500 to watch
[2:07:13] your team lose.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; The devil takes more than 10%. I want
[2:07:20] y'all to know right off of the bat,
[2:07:23] God's a good God.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; The devil may tell you different, but
[2:07:27] God's a great big God.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I lost my job today. Don't
[2:07:32] worry.
[2:07:34] McDonald's is hiring.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Bies is hired. $25 an hour.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I see these guys with these signs and
[2:07:55] they're smoking a cigarette.
[2:07:59] They look healthier than I look
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; and want just a little help. A little
[2:08:06] help that I could give them is Jesus.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Brother, do you ever give them money?
[2:08:11] No. No. But I have told them find Jesus.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz my idea is they're going to take
[2:08:19] that money and spend it on beer and
[2:08:21] alcohol and drugs.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; They're going to be right back here
[2:08:24] tomorrow. Amen.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; And they stop they stop volkswagons. And
[2:08:29] I'm not going there.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; But you're going to have ups and downs
[2:08:34] in your life.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you the difference. He's
[2:08:38] going to be with you.
[2:08:42] You're going to go through some brier
[2:08:44] patches,
[2:08:46] over some sharp rocks, over bluffs,
[2:08:50] down over the hillsides,
[2:08:52] up through the mountains,
[2:08:54] over waters, but God will be with you.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; There's so many hills that you're going
[2:09:03] to have to climb.
[2:09:08] I got a list here I'm going to give you
[2:09:10] in just a minute. And it seems when you
[2:09:13] get to the end of the way, oh my, just
[2:09:16] look up here there. All that's that's
[2:09:20] been look back at your footprints.
[2:09:25] It won't seem very much.
[2:09:29] Now, sometimes we think, well, I've been
[2:09:32] in a real trial.
[2:09:34] I've been in some difficult situations.
[2:09:37] We celebrated my 25th anniversary of
[2:09:39] preaching to you, but I've actually been
[2:09:42] preaching since 1983.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; During that time, I've had a couple
[2:09:49] things happen to me.
[2:09:53] Maybe you don't have a list, but
[2:09:56] I just wonder, do we get mad at God
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; when something happens?
[2:10:03] Do we get frustrated when we get over
[2:10:05] one trial and all of a sudden?
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Here comes another trial.
[2:10:13] You mentioned a couple things last
[2:10:15] night. Didn't know it was in my notes,
[2:10:19] but you know, I fell off of a house 40T,
[2:10:22] landed on concrete, and they said I'd
[2:10:24] never walk again.
[2:10:26] My dad walks in and prays for me. And I
[2:10:29] remember his prayer.
[2:10:32] He said, 'Father, I am your son
[2:10:36] and you gave us authority to pray for
[2:10:38] the sick and this is my son who is also
[2:10:43] your son and you spoke to me on the way
[2:10:47] to this place
[2:10:50] and said he will walk out of the
[2:10:53] hospital. They are saying he's paralyzed
[2:10:55] and never walk again. But you said Amen.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; But I am not in a wheelchair today.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; I got up and walked out of that hospital
[2:11:09] that night.
[2:11:18] I laid in in RMH with eight days with a
[2:11:22] stroke. Could not stand the light. On
[2:11:25] the last day that I was there, a girl
[2:11:27] came in at three o'clock in the morning
[2:11:29] and she went.
[2:11:32] When she came in, she come around the
[2:11:34] bed. She said, "Mr. Spencer, are you
[2:11:36] awake?" And I said, "Yes, ma'am."
[2:11:38] She said, "They have told me that you're
[2:11:40] a preacher." I said, "Yes, ma'am."
[2:11:43] She said, "When I walked into the room,
[2:11:45] I felt a presence."
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; I felt the presence. Have you been
[2:11:49] praying? I said, "Yes, ma'am. How far
[2:11:52] away is he?" I said, "He's right here in
[2:11:55] the room."
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; She said, "I need Jesus."
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; I need Jesus. I took her by the hand
[2:12:06] and I began to pray for her and I heard
[2:12:09] her weeping because it was dark. I heard
[2:12:12] her weeping and crying. And she said,
[2:12:15] "I'm giving myself to you today. Father,
[2:12:19] forgive me of my sins." Let me tell you
[2:12:21] what happened. I'd been eight days and
[2:12:23] couldn't stand light.
[2:12:26] And instantly after that prayer,
[2:12:29] everything was well.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; God knew there was a predestinated seed
[2:12:35] that was there.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; And I had to be there on the eighth day
[2:12:40] that I could meet her.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody help me preach.
[2:12:47] Your trial
[2:12:51] is not in vain. The things that you go
[2:12:54] through is not in vain.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; There is a rainbow that will form after
[2:13:01] your storm. God made the promise.
[2:13:05] [Applause]
[2:13:17] I was burned in an explosion.
[2:13:20] My arms burned, my face burned, my lungs
[2:13:22] burned,
[2:13:25] basically destroyed. The doctor said I
[2:13:27] wouldn't live.
[2:13:29] On the worst day, brother Biscoll called
[2:13:32] Sister Connie and said the Lord spoke to
[2:13:34] her to him that I would be the speaker
[2:13:37] at the next Mount Baker camp.
[2:13:43] You talking about going out on a limb,
[2:13:44] you better know it's God.
[2:13:50] That was the day that they gave me up.
[2:13:53] But God had more plans. I want to tell
[2:13:55] you, God's got more plans for you.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:59] God's got more plans for you.
[2:14:03] Jumping from that story to here, we have
[2:14:06] fought cancer for five years, over five
[2:14:09] years.
[2:14:12] I asked a doctor the other day, I said,
[2:14:14] "Where am I at in my walk with this?"
[2:14:18] And he said, "Rephrase it."
[2:14:20] I said, "Where am I at?
[2:14:23] Am I coming out of the woods
[2:14:26] in this journey? He turned his recorder
[2:14:29] off and he said, "Ron, you're not coming
[2:14:31] out. You're in the middle of the forest.
[2:14:34] But I want to tell you, keep walking."
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Aren't we frustrated with God when we
[2:14:51] have issues?
[2:14:54] What are we going to do with today?
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with this
[2:14:59] afternoon? What are we going to do with
[2:15:00] tomorrow?
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; What's left of time in our life?
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; What's left? Maybe there's chapters
[2:15:11] left.
[2:15:13] Sister Wanda, you can't look at this as
[2:15:15] the end of the trail.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; You got a lot of You got grandbabies to
[2:15:19] take care of.
[2:15:31] Brother, I don't know if I can make it
[2:15:33] through chemo. I want you to understand
[2:15:35] if you got God with you.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; If you got God with you, he'll help you.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; You having trouble on your job, God will
[2:15:45] help you.
[2:15:52] Young people going to school. You may
[2:15:54] get frustrated every day you're going
[2:15:56] through it, but God will help you. Your
[2:15:59] friends will see the light around you.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; You may think you're not getting
[2:16:05] anywhere with them, but they'll look
[2:16:06] back and see you as a real Christian.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Not something phony, not something made
[2:16:12] up.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; But if I ever met a real Christian,
[2:16:35] Brother Ron, I just have so much
[2:16:36] trouble. Okay, I got a quote for you and
[2:16:39] I'm gonna quit.
[2:16:42] Brother Brandon must have felt like this
[2:16:44] a day or two.
[2:16:53] The devil hates me.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; The devil hates me. And I know he hates
[2:17:01] you, too.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; And he's my enemy. Boy, I want it like
[2:17:05] that. Don't you?
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; But as long as God is my friend,
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have no fear of him.
[2:17:16] Won't you look over at your neighbor and
[2:17:17] tell them, "The devil is my enemy."
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; And this may be the only time you'll
[2:17:25] ever use this word in this church, but I
[2:17:27] want you to tell them, "I hate that
[2:17:29] devil."
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Hate's a strong word, Brother Ron. You
[2:17:36] need to be teaching love. I hate the
[2:17:37] devil.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; I am not on his side. I never have been.
[2:17:42] I never will be. And I never in the
[2:17:43] future.
[2:17:53] The devil hasn't got one legal right
[2:17:57] nowhere.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; He's just the devil.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; And it's a password. That's all. He
[2:18:05] hasn't got no legal right to any man.
[2:18:09] They'll accept the promise of Jesus
[2:18:11] Christ. He's whipped.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; So why are we afraid of him?
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; He's whipped.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; He's been whipped a long time.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; So when he jumps in your ring, whip him
[2:18:28] again.
[2:18:30] [Applause]
[2:18:39] Okay. Okay.
[2:18:42] Well, the devil knows he ain't got much
[2:18:44] time to work either.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; He realizes he ain't got much time
[2:18:48] because the book says he ain't got much
[2:18:49] time.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; So, I want him to know. He keeps telling
[2:18:52] me I don't have much time. I want him to
[2:18:54] know. You don't have much time, old boy.
[2:19:00] morning in hell. What it's likemen,
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Satan has given assignments to the the
[2:19:08] demons cuz Lucifer can't be everywhere.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's not God. He be only in one
[2:19:15] place at one time. So he sends spirits
[2:19:18] out against you. And all of a sudden,
[2:19:24] that spirit is assigned to you, Stephen.
[2:19:28] He's assigned to come to your house.
[2:19:32] Your house, brother Shannon.
[2:19:34] Go to his house and destroy his day. I
[2:19:38] would like for it to be said by the
[2:19:40] devils. Please don't send me to his
[2:19:44] house.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Please don't send me to his house.
[2:19:54] I did everything that I could to stop
[2:19:56] him and he just turned and whipped me
[2:19:58] over and over and over again.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; I get headaches from having to beat on
[2:20:10] him. I'm wore out when I come back down
[2:20:13] here to hell cuz he has beat me so bad.
[2:20:19] I would like for it to be said that we
[2:20:22] are Satan's nightmare.
[2:20:25] [Applause]
[2:20:37] You know what a nightmare is? You go to
[2:20:40] sleep. You were thinking love of God
[2:20:43] thoughts. You were talk thinking special
[2:20:46] song thoughts. and all of a sudden you
[2:20:48] just slip off into a deep sleep
[2:20:52] and all of a sudden you find yourself in
[2:20:55] a nightmare and you can't wake yourself
[2:20:58] up.
[2:21:01] It's the most horrible thing you've ever
[2:21:02] been in. You sweat, you cry, you get all
[2:21:06] emotional, you tear the sheets up that
[2:21:08] you've got on you, and you finally wake
[2:21:11] up and you go, "Thank you, Jesus.
[2:21:16] Thank you, Jesus. That was just a
[2:21:19] nightmare.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Finishing with this.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; But Satan can't wake up.
[2:21:38] So whatever time you got left, beat him.
[2:21:41] Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him.
[2:21:46] Fight. Fight. Fight.
[2:21:56] Hallelujah.
[2:21:58] Hallelujah.
[2:22:00] Don't whine
[2:22:02] because you've only got a few days left.
[2:22:05] Go work hard.
[2:22:08] Get it.
[2:22:11] Every day is a new day.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Me and Jesus has got a lot of work to
[2:22:16] do.
[2:22:19] Stand to our feet this morning.
[2:22:21] Thank you for being such an attentive
[2:22:23] audience.
[2:22:46] I want to bring a quote to life before I
[2:22:49] walk from the stage.
[2:22:51] Five years ago, you were making plans to
[2:22:53] be here today.
[2:22:56] Maybe two years ago, maybe one year ago,
[2:22:58] you made plans. Some of you are brand
[2:23:00] new.
[2:23:02] But God had plans for you.
[2:23:05] And your plans is getting you in
[2:23:07] rapturing condition.
[2:23:09] You're walking closer to God every day
[2:23:11] of your life. You're walking closer to
[2:23:13] God.
[2:23:16] What you did yesterday, it's over. What
[2:23:18] you're doing today, you enjoy. Amen.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; But don't let the day go through and not
[2:23:24] appreciate the moments that you're
[2:23:27] living in.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; We've all lost loved ones real quickly
[2:23:32] and you wish you'd have told them
[2:23:33] something.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Don't neglect to love your your your
[2:23:37] your family and one another. So, I'm
[2:23:41] going to give you some practice just
[2:23:42] now. I want you to shake three people's
[2:23:44] hand and tell them, "I want you to know
[2:23:46] today that I really love you.
[2:24:05] Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Don't that feel good?
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Don't that feel good?
[2:24:13] What an awesome God.
[2:24:17] What an awesome God.

[2:25:10] to live.
[2:25:13] I want to give
[2:25:17] until there's just no more
[2:25:24] to give.
[2:25:26] I want to love
[2:25:31] love till there's just no
[2:25:37] more love.
[2:25:40] I could never
[2:25:43] ever
[2:25:45] love
[2:25:47] the Lord
[2:25:50] because
[2:25:52] he lives.
[2:25:58] I can face

[2:26:19] is gone.
[2:26:23] Hallelujah.

[2:26:31] Yes, I know.
[2:26:34] He holds
[2:26:36] my future
[2:26:42] and life
[2:26:46] is worth
[2:26:48] the living
[2:26:50] just
[2:26:52] because. Sing that again. Amen. Amen.
[2:26:57] Hallelujah.
