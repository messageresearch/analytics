[42:47] each and every one of you we thank you
[42:49] for taking
[42:50] taking the time to be here this morning
[42:53] i believe god's got some special things
[42:55] in store for us and
[42:56] uh before we go to the word i just want
[42:58] to make a few mentions i know brother
[42:59] matthew has went over these things about
[43:02] the fall fellowship
[43:03] just it pays to go over things twice
[43:06] because sometimes
[43:07] we become feeble-minded and forget what
[43:09] was said and
[43:11] and
[43:11] we i know there's a lot of distractions
[43:13] during the day but we want to make sure
[43:15] that you get the the message
[43:17] and so
[43:18] just a reminder that next sunday
[43:20] there'll be no service here at the
[43:21] church but it'll be grand caverns there
[43:24] in grotto's if you don't know the
[43:26] directions you can look it up on you on
[43:28] your google and uh they it'll be
[43:31] starting at 11 we'd like for you to be
[43:32] there around 11 o'clock
[43:34] and then we'll start to eat around 11 30
[43:36] 11 45 and during that little gap or
[43:39] window we'll be doing some preliminary
[43:41] things and setting up throughout the day
[43:43] and different things making some
[43:44] comments maybe maybe speaking just for a
[43:46] few moments there but but we're planning
[43:49] to eat around 11 30 11 45
[43:52] and
[43:52] we were able to do it again and uh
[43:56] so
[43:57] i think you all enjoyed it pretty good
[43:58] so we we went ahead and ordered the ice
[44:00] cream truck
[44:01] again for you
[44:03] and uh
[44:08] i know
[44:09] i know i sure i sure enjoy those things
[44:12] so so just
[44:14] be a real witness to to anybody that you
[44:16] see we're gonna we're gonna have it on
[44:17] speakers and we never know what what the
[44:20] lord will witness i know that sometimes
[44:23] even jesus had people that followed him
[44:25] for the fishes and the loaves and i'm
[44:26] sure there'll be somebody that'll show
[44:28] up there you
[44:30] might
[44:32] just smile and nod and say god bless you
[44:35] and uh but dress decently like you
[44:37] always do but dress accordingly to the
[44:39] time and the season normally we make
[44:41] this about a fall deal and so you can
[44:43] dress according how you want to don't
[44:44] show up in your pajamas
[44:48] but we're going to be putting this in a
[44:49] church book and if
[44:52] sister sue when you go to put that thing
[44:54] together somebody shows up in their
[44:55] pajamas you show it to me first i don't
[44:57] want that in there
[44:59] i don't believe that anybody here will
[45:01] but we may have a strangler show up that
[45:03] might do that so
[45:05] so anyways but so we we thank you for
[45:07] preparing for that we thank you we
[45:09] always enjoy this time and this this
[45:12] we were
[45:13] we all we always just joy our fellowship
[45:16] there's
[45:17] there's a lot of churches that that are
[45:18] blessed around the the message and
[45:21] have some of the finest people but
[45:24] there's no church like full gospel
[45:25] lighthouse
[45:27] and i always enjoy getting to set
[45:29] shoulder to shoulder with you and enjoy
[45:31] the day it's it's a type of what we'll
[45:33] be doing in eternity
[45:35] and we're just looking forward to that
[45:37] also just another mention because of
[45:40] uh
[45:40] because of the app that we have been
[45:42] using for our youth our young adult
[45:44] choir some of some of the attendants
[45:47] that that use that app if you don't use
[45:49] it in a while it'll this uh
[45:51] this load there but this evening at the
[45:54] cabin uh there'll be
[45:56] there'll be a youth group for for 12 and
[45:59] above it's not for anybody below that
[46:01] age but it's for the 12 and above and
[46:03] that is it from 5 to 7 this evening and
[46:07] if you have not have not received that
[46:09] text or whatever just please let us know
[46:11] but we want to make you aware
[46:13] that's for the 12 and above you know how
[46:15] to get there by now

[51:51] the church world can put on their shows
[51:54] the church world has to have a stage
[51:56] light and they have to have fog machines
[51:59] to create an element of atmosphere
[52:01] but the bride of jesus christ
[52:05] sets the atmosphere by her worship
[52:08] they have to set with fog machines and
[52:11] different things to create a cloud
[52:13] but that cloud has followed
[52:15] this bride
[52:17] he's the one that makes the presence
[52:20] milky all over

[53:09] to opening the door
[53:11] that will unlock every answer
[53:13] father i pray you lord as we would
[53:16] just step into the word just for a
[53:18] moment
[53:19] the holy ghost would take over
[53:21] you would begin to minister
[53:23] lord i i understand the
[53:26] responsibility that is placed upon the
[53:28] shoulders of the priest
[53:30] so i'm asking lord for
[53:33] just a little a lift lord i'm asking
[53:35] that you would take me and set me down
[53:36] in a corner
[53:38] as i yield myself to you father
[53:41] lord may you use this tabernacle
[53:43] in the name of jesus christ
[53:46] and the bride says
[53:48] amen if you have your bible this morning
[53:49] we'll turn again over into revelations
[53:52] chapter 1
[53:54] and verse 1.
[54:11] trust me we didn't bore any of you last
[54:13] night
[54:18] i'm doing a little bit of foundation
[54:20] work
[54:21] so that we can do a little bit of
[54:22] preaching today so if you'll help me
[54:24] preach
[54:28] i believe god will do something real
[54:30] special for you
[54:31] amen so by the help of the lord we'd
[54:33] like to speak to you again on this
[54:35] thought the time
[54:36] the time is at hand
[54:40] revelations chapter 1 and verse 1
[54:44] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[54:46] gave unto him
[54:48] to show unto his servants things which
[54:50] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[54:52] and signified it
[54:53] by his angel
[54:55] unto his servant john
[54:57] you can find
[54:59] that john
[55:00] describes and prescribes here
[55:02] that all of these things were sent and
[55:04] signified by the angel all the way
[55:07] through the book of revelation you'll
[55:08] see john writing these things
[55:10] who bear record of the word of god and
[55:13] of the testimony of jesus christ
[55:15] and of all things that he saw
[55:18] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[55:20] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[55:23] those things which are written therein
[55:26] for the time
[55:28] is at hand may god bless his word you
[55:30] may be seated in the presence of the
[55:32] most high god blessed is he that readeth
[55:35] and they that hear the words of this
[55:37] prophecy
[55:39] and keep those things which are written
[55:41] therein for the time
[55:43] is at hand and we realize that as we
[55:46] went through last night that god is is
[55:48] an eternal being and he does not operate
[55:50] in time but god has a time piece and he
[55:53] is working and if you want to see god's
[55:56] time peace we are told that we are to
[55:58] look and see that israel is god's
[56:00] timepiece you watch where israel's at
[56:03] and you'll see where god is moving in
[56:05] and we realize that the very same night
[56:08] that the angel of the lord came and gave
[56:09] a commission to go and to take this
[56:11] message to a gentile bride that it was
[56:13] the same night or in the same hour in
[56:16] the same moments of time that the angel
[56:18] that the angel was commissioning a
[56:20] prophet to come and bring a message to
[56:22] this generation it was at the same time
[56:25] that israel was becoming a nation where
[56:27] she hadn't been a nation for over
[56:29] thousands of years and now we are
[56:31] looking at a scene that has been set up
[56:33] by the kingdom of god and now now we
[56:36] look as human beings if we if we maybe
[56:38] been in a state of a coma and we've been
[56:40] out of things and we can't understand
[56:42] time and we're coming back too and and
[56:44] we've been out and we haven't seen
[56:45] different things we maybe been in a
[56:47] hospital or something all you have to do
[56:49] is just look out the window and look at
[56:51] the scene that you're seeing and you can
[56:53] see the time and the season that you're
[56:55] in you can look out the windows now and
[56:57] you're starting to watch that we are in
[56:58] the season of fall you're watching
[57:00] people put on put on flannel jackets and
[57:03] and flannel flannel shirts and different
[57:05] things you're seeing that they are
[57:07] recognizing that there is a time that is
[57:10] coming and you begin to watch that the
[57:12] season is at hand even nature will tell
[57:16] us what the seasons are but we're not
[57:18] just watching to recognize what nature
[57:20] is telling us but we are recognizing our
[57:23] day and its message and when you begin
[57:25] to watch and recognize the day and your
[57:28] message then there becomes a release so
[57:30] a power to bring an understanding just
[57:33] like when jesus was walking with his
[57:35] disciples on the road to emmaus they
[57:37] didn't know that that was him they drew
[57:39] not because he he drew an eye unto them
[57:42] because they were speaking about these
[57:44] things and that's how he will always
[57:46] draw close unto you as a people is when
[57:48] you begin to fellowship and you begin to
[57:50] talk about the things of god and you
[57:52] begin to rehearse what he was doing and
[57:53] what he was what he what he did and we
[57:55] thought this was the messiah but you'll
[57:57] watch as it began to take them and she
[57:59] began to walk with them down the road he
[58:01] took them he took them all the way from
[58:04] genesis all the ray to revelation he
[58:06] showed them who he was by the scripture
[58:09] but we realized that the preaching of
[58:11] the word never did no good it didn't he
[58:14] didn't recognize they didn't recognize
[58:15] that this was him but notice what they
[58:18] did when it come down to the end of the
[58:20] day they come down there and they
[58:22] constrained him the bible said that they
[58:24] pulled on him to come on the inside and
[58:27] when he got on the inside that's when he
[58:29] showed himself and when you get christ
[58:31] on the inside of you that is when you'll
[58:34] begin to recognize that this is him and
[58:36] we are aware that this is him that is
[58:38] doing these works this is him notice it
[58:41] took them all day long to take this
[58:43] journey but in a minute in a moment in
[58:45] time they begin to run back to the city
[58:47] where they had just came notice they
[58:49] were hitting the wrong way they were
[58:51] going away from where he was going to be
[58:54] but he said go back and tell my
[58:55] disciples that i that you have handled
[58:58] me you have seen me and this is the
[59:00] resurrected lord jesus christ and that
[59:02] is the same thing that he is doing here
[59:04] at full gospel lighthouse he didn't move
[59:06] on your pastor's heart just to set out a
[59:08] bunch of chairs for no reason he set it
[59:10] out lord placed it on our heart to fill
[59:13] this place and it is your job and our
[59:15] job to compel them to come we must work
[59:18] while it is day for night is coming we
[59:21] realize that over in the book of
[59:22] zechariah in 14 that we realize that it
[59:25] shall be light in the evening time and
[59:28] we realize that the light that is
[59:29] shining on the word of god today is your
[59:32] life it is taking you to a spot in a
[59:35] place of time and putting you into
[59:37] eternity this light won't leave you the
[59:39] light left the denominations but the
[59:41] light won't leave the bride of jesus
[59:42] christ we are destined to fulfill what
[59:46] he has said in the scriptures that there
[59:48] will be a people that'll be perfect
[59:50] that'll be blameless that'll be spotless
[59:52] there'll be blood bought
[59:55] have you had have you come to have
[59:57] church this morning
[59:59] [Applause]
[1:00:00] hallelujah
[1:00:05] now notice in in in the church age book
[1:00:08] he says now the time is at hand reading
[1:00:10] from genesis or revelations one he said
[1:00:13] the time is at hand the time was not at
[1:00:15] hand previously in the wisdom and
[1:00:17] economy of god this mighty revelation
[1:00:20] though fully known to god
[1:00:22] could not come forth hitherto
[1:00:25] thus we immediately learn a principle
[1:00:27] the revelation of god for each age can
[1:00:30] come in that age only
[1:00:33] and at a specific time he says look at
[1:00:35] the history of israel
[1:00:43] look at the history of israel
[1:00:45] the revelation of god to moses came only
[1:00:47] at a specific time of history and even
[1:00:50] more specifically it came as the people
[1:00:53] cried unto god and jesus himself came at
[1:00:57] the fulfillment at the fullness of time
[1:01:00] notice let me read that again look at
[1:01:02] the history of israel the revelation of
[1:01:04] god to moses came only at a specific
[1:01:07] time of history and even more
[1:01:09] specifically it came as the people cried
[1:01:12] unto god notice there was a season for
[1:01:15] these things to come to pass notice god
[1:01:18] knows the time but there was a desire on
[1:01:20] the people's heart and he heard the cry
[1:01:23] of his people he said i am going down
[1:01:26] there to take over i have heard the cry
[1:01:29] of my people he knows what you've been
[1:01:31] crying in this last day he knows what
[1:01:33] you're going through he understands the
[1:01:35] times and the season that you're
[1:01:37] operating in let me come down just a
[1:01:39] little bit more in the natural for you
[1:01:40] he understands what you're going through
[1:01:42] in your body he understands that you're
[1:01:44] in a time element you're in a time
[1:01:46] element in a body and he knows exactly
[1:01:49] what you have need of if if he says that
[1:01:52] there's healing for you you're in the
[1:01:54] perfect season for healing
[1:01:57] are you with me we look back in the
[1:01:58] river in the old testament and by
[1:02:00] revelation we look and see that there
[1:02:02] was a bomb in gilead and they could go
[1:02:05] to a physician that would heal their
[1:02:06] bodies but here what was it pointing to
[1:02:09] is that there was one coming that would
[1:02:12] take the stripes at pilot's judgment
[1:02:14] hall and he would completely make you
[1:02:16] healed if you would operate the faith to
[1:02:19] step into that realm
[1:02:22] what happened 2000 years ago was just
[1:02:25] what was seen before the foundation of
[1:02:27] the world now let me let me come down a
[1:02:29] little bit further when you receive that
[1:02:31] healing it was also seen before the
[1:02:33] foundation of the world you may have
[1:02:35] received it in this time but it was
[1:02:37] happening before the foundation of the
[1:02:39] world god saw what you were going
[1:02:42] through
[1:02:45] notice
[1:02:46] and jesus himself came at the
[1:02:47] fulfillness at the fullness of time he
[1:02:50] being the complete revelation of the
[1:02:52] godhead and in this age of laodicea and
[1:02:55] the revelation of god will come in its
[1:02:57] due time it will not falter
[1:03:00] neither will it be premature
[1:03:02] think on this and heed it well for we
[1:03:05] are in the end time today
[1:03:08] we realize that and i've been setting
[1:03:10] this before you not even knowing what he
[1:03:12] was leading me to but i've been setting
[1:03:14] this before you that this is the
[1:03:16] grandest of all days that the
[1:03:18] opportunity that you and i have been
[1:03:20] given is the opportunities that paul and
[1:03:22] the band enoch and elijah they long for
[1:03:25] these opportunities and we realize that
[1:03:27] we are living in the grandest and the
[1:03:29] greatest of all times because this is
[1:03:32] the finishing up of redemption and we
[1:03:34] are watching the blending of time with
[1:03:37] the blending of eternity that which was
[1:03:39] a prophet's prophecy you are now the
[1:03:42] fulfillment of it and here we are in
[1:03:45] this element of time each and every one
[1:03:46] of us have 24 hours in our day we have a
[1:03:49] lot of time that we are going to live
[1:03:51] but what are you going to do with your
[1:03:53] time
[1:03:54] what are you going to do with the rest
[1:03:56] of your life young people what are you
[1:03:57] going to do are you going to choose to
[1:03:59] serve mammon are you going to choose to
[1:04:01] serve god are you going to choose to
[1:04:03] serve yourself in the pleasures of life
[1:04:05] or are you going to live a dedicated
[1:04:07] life yield it completely to the holy
[1:04:09] ghost it's up to you what you do but
[1:04:11] this is your time this is your moment
[1:04:15] and i am determined to live my moment
[1:04:18] out i'm determined to live my life out
[1:04:20] i'm determined this is my time this
[1:04:23] ain't this a day this ain't the day of
[1:04:25] paul this ain't the day of luther this
[1:04:27] ain't the day of wesley this ain't the
[1:04:29] day of the pentecostals this is the day
[1:04:32] of the bride of jesus christ this is our
[1:04:35] time
[1:04:37] and if it is our time i'm going to live
[1:04:39] it out i'm not going to live it out
[1:04:41] halfway i'm going to put all that i've
[1:04:43] got into this thing
[1:04:46] well you say brother andrew i don't know
[1:04:48] i don't know how i'm going to make it i
[1:04:49] don't know what you're going to have to
[1:04:51] make some tough decisions to come out
[1:04:53] and stand for this message you're going
[1:04:55] to have to make some tough decisions to
[1:04:57] go into a rapture you're going to have
[1:04:58] to make some tough decisions to make a
[1:05:01] body change but it'll be worth it all
[1:05:06] you know you well i just i keep getting
[1:05:08] knocked down why don't you get up and
[1:05:09] try if you might shock yourself how well
[1:05:12] you will succeed at some point
[1:05:14] this is what i keep on losing but
[1:05:16] sometimes people get comfortable with
[1:05:18] losing
[1:05:20] they get comfortable with always failing
[1:05:22] some people get comfortable with
[1:05:24] backsliding in church and they sit there
[1:05:26] like a bump on a pickle they sit there
[1:05:28] like a bump on a log never lift their
[1:05:30] hand i'm not talking about anybody here
[1:05:32] but i'm just preaching to spirits that
[1:05:34] don't want to die
[1:05:37] and they get comfortable setting in
[1:05:39] their comfort zone and sitting there in
[1:05:41] their backslidden condition you didn't
[1:05:43] backslide when you got out there in the
[1:05:45] world you got sick you got backslidden
[1:05:47] right here in church
[1:05:53] you have a day of visitation and when
[1:05:55] you turn it down you are backsliding and
[1:05:58] you get cool on god and think my jesus
[1:06:01] nobody loves me nobody understands what
[1:06:03] i'm going through are you even alive
[1:06:08] this is the greatest time that the world
[1:06:10] has ever seen you are the most powerful
[1:06:13] people on the face of this earth this is
[1:06:16] your time this is not your time to have
[1:06:18] a pity party this is not a time to stay
[1:06:20] in a backslidden condition this is your
[1:06:22] time to have full and complete victory
[1:06:25] this ain't a time to get upset this is a
[1:06:28] time to get upset at the devil this
[1:06:30] ain't a time to get discouraged this is
[1:06:31] a time to take courage and be quick like
[1:06:34] men
[1:06:40] young people it's the greatest day that
[1:06:41] you ever lived here you are living in an
[1:06:43] hour you're living in an hour
[1:06:46] we're watching in the dispensation of
[1:06:47] the baptism of the holy ghost when those
[1:06:50] that long to have it when david would
[1:06:52] have loved to have it
[1:06:55] you are now sitting there in heavenly
[1:06:58] places enthroned by
[1:07:01] the holy ghost
[1:07:08] i've been dealing with
[1:07:10] a certain individual
[1:07:12] and i wouldn't say this
[1:07:14] i wouldn't say this openly or i wouldn't
[1:07:16] even say this because i understand that
[1:07:18] when you recognize something that demons
[1:07:21] when you mention something that demons
[1:07:22] get scared
[1:07:23] and to begin to run and i'm real careful
[1:07:25] i'm real careful about mentioning this
[1:07:27] the spirit but i i want to identify
[1:07:30] where you're at
[1:07:32] personally
[1:07:33] i have i have prayed
[1:07:37] i have prayed for more suicide in the
[1:07:39] last year than i ever have in all of my
[1:07:41] life
[1:07:42] i have prayed for more depression this
[1:07:44] year than i ever have in all of my life
[1:07:46] why it's because of the timing and the
[1:07:49] seasons
[1:07:50] now notice notice now now now i wouldn't
[1:07:53] stand up here and say i wouldn't stand
[1:07:55] up here and say that there is a power
[1:07:57] that can knock that suicide spirit down
[1:07:59] unless there was
[1:08:01] i wouldn't stand up here and say that
[1:08:02] there's a power that is greater than a
[1:08:04] depression spirit and an anxiety spirit
[1:08:07] and even the spirit of unworthiness even
[1:08:10] the spirit of i'm not wanted or even the
[1:08:12] spirit of i i don't know you know i
[1:08:14] don't know if i can make it or not it is
[1:08:16] a spirit of the time of the age you
[1:08:18] notice you have never seen an age like
[1:08:21] this where women have had so much
[1:08:23] trouble to have babies
[1:08:26] it seems like there's a barrenness upon
[1:08:28] the ladies of this day that they long to
[1:08:30] be a mother they long to have a child
[1:08:32] but notice it's a spirit that is on the
[1:08:35] age to try to shut down the very life
[1:08:38] that is coming out because you see it
[1:08:40] doesn't matter what you go through it
[1:08:42] doesn't matter what happens to you if it
[1:08:44] is an elect seed it's got to come forth
[1:08:47] just like when moses was put in a bull
[1:08:50] rush it didn't look like he was going to
[1:08:51] make it in the natural eye but there was
[1:08:54] angels that was encamped about it
[1:08:59] and he told gable to go down there and
[1:09:01] put your foot on the ark of that bell
[1:09:04] and when there would be a crocodile come
[1:09:06] up if he would have gotten a little
[1:09:07] whirlpool gabriel was there to get him
[1:09:10] out of it and if there's an elected seed
[1:09:12] don't you worry about that barren spirit
[1:09:15] don't you worry about that suicide
[1:09:17] spirit don't you worry about that

[1:13:16] time for him to conquer it's my time to
[1:13:18] conquer it's my time to win it's my time
[1:13:21] to see these young people get a baptism
[1:13:23] of the holy ghost and stop living with a
[1:13:25] lie of the devil they tell them to never
[1:13:27] be good enough they'll never be healed
[1:13:29] they'll never make it
[1:13:31] i'm here to prove that the devil is
[1:13:33] alive he told me i'd never make it he
[1:13:36] told me i'd never be a son of god i am
[1:13:38] here to prove that the devil is a liar
[1:13:43] there were some people turned down that
[1:13:44] message book but there was two sons of
[1:13:47] god that said i'll be identified this is
[1:13:50] my time
[1:13:52] hallelujah
[1:13:55] let us a lot of so-called christians of
[1:13:57] the day didn't want none of this acts 2
[1:14:00] 38 blabbering hollering screaming acts 2
[1:14:02] 38 young is that that she thinks they
[1:14:04] are but this is the only kind that the
[1:14:07] word can bring forth them important
[1:14:09] people wouldn't rise up but god raised
[1:14:11] up a generation
[1:14:15] it was a time in moses day when the
[1:14:17] generation they wouldn't go no far they
[1:14:19] wouldn't go no farther they done had
[1:14:21] their sacrifices they didn't had their
[1:14:23] complaint but god said i'm raising up a
[1:14:25] new generation
[1:14:36] hallelujah
[1:14:38] father the hour has come
[1:14:40] the time has come that god will gather
[1:14:42] his church together under one great big
[1:14:44] banner of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:47] and pour out his powers among them and
[1:14:50] great signs and wonders will take place
[1:14:52] the time has come
[1:14:53] the time has come for the pentecostal
[1:14:55] church to make a stand the time has come
[1:14:57] to circumcise the church and call out
[1:14:59] this foolishness the time has come to go
[1:15:02] back to the old landmark the time has
[1:15:04] come for the outpouring the time has
[1:15:06] come for the gathering of the people the
[1:15:07] time has come for jesus to come and the
[1:15:10] time will be here soon to give out all
[1:15:13] the rewards the time is here
[1:15:17] you're dealing with a time vessel but
[1:15:18] this is your time
[1:15:21] you remember when joshua when he was
[1:15:22] standing there in the worst of times
[1:15:25] when the river was all muddy and it
[1:15:26] looked like there was no way possible
[1:15:28] for them to get across you know god
[1:15:31] chooses some of the hardest times to
[1:15:33] bring his children through something
[1:15:38] you ain't dead you've been living you
[1:15:40] take a look what you're looking for day
[1:15:42] but god is still god
[1:15:44] take a look about what you've been going
[1:15:45] through the past year and a half as a
[1:15:47] church then just take a look at what
[1:15:48] kovit's done it's it is so it is such a
[1:15:51] dividing spirit that it's coming to
[1:15:53] vision and try to break up the unity of
[1:15:56] the church of the living god but i am
[1:15:59] going to stand here as a pastor and i am
[1:16:01] going to break the bondage
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:06] a division that would try to come in and
[1:16:09] divide you amongst the people and say
[1:16:11] well you got to have it this way or you
[1:16:12] got to have it that way it is god's way
[1:16:14] or no way
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:18] you can take a shot if you want to you
[1:16:20] can take a pill if you want to you can
[1:16:21] wear a mask if you want to but i'm going
[1:16:23] to stick with jesus that don't bother me
[1:16:26] in the human realm you do whatever you
[1:16:27] want to but you better have the seal of
[1:16:29] the holy ghost the seal of the holy
[1:16:31] ghost is the only thing that'll keep the
[1:16:32] devil off of you and the reason why
[1:16:34] you're afraid to say amen is because you
[1:16:36] don't have to seal the holy ghost on you
[1:16:38] but if you did it
[1:16:41] i'll go over here and preach to the flag
[1:16:43] at least she stands for liberty
[1:16:46] if you'd get up and get the holy ghost
[1:16:48] one good time you'd stop your pounding
[1:16:50] spirit you'd stop your little pity party
[1:16:53] i got cancer look at our pastor he has
[1:16:56] been beaten down over and over and over
[1:16:58] again
[1:17:00] it was not his time to die it is his
[1:17:02] time to live it's his time to preach
[1:17:05] it's his time to dance over top of the
[1:17:07] devil
[1:17:16] what did joshua do
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:20] so go out there and get some rocks
[1:17:22] go out there and get some rocks and set
[1:17:23] them up
[1:17:24] as a memorial
[1:17:26] that this is where we crossed over
[1:17:30] this is where it happened at
[1:17:32] we're leaving everything behind us over
[1:17:34] here
[1:17:35] we come out of egypt but we can't think
[1:17:37] like egyptians no more we can't think
[1:17:39] like slaves no more man
[1:17:42] we can't think like that more no more we
[1:17:44] can't feel like the enemy is going to
[1:17:46] chase us down remember your enemy
[1:17:48] already died in the red sea
[1:17:51] if you'd stop thinking with that kind of
[1:17:52] mentality that it's the devil's time but
[1:17:55] you need to wake up and realize this is
[1:17:56] your time the enemy that you see today
[1:18:00] you will see no more what say brother
[1:18:02] andrew if you go to reading over there
[1:18:04] in exodus chapter 14 moses said that why
[1:18:07] christ speak and he said that and the
[1:18:09] waters opened up and they crossed over
[1:18:11] on dry ground but did you notice
[1:18:14] did you notice brother andrew they
[1:18:16] actually did see their enemies again
[1:18:18] when they were floating on top of the
[1:18:20] water drowned
[1:18:23] it was not their bodies that he was
[1:18:24] talking about he was talking about them
[1:18:27] spirits
[1:18:34] well i guess the prophet failed
[1:18:38] he got us this far but
[1:18:40] he couldn't get us to rest away let me
[1:18:42] tell you
[1:18:43] every demon has been defeated
[1:18:46] every spirit has been defeated the only
[1:18:48] way that it ain't been defeated is if
[1:18:50] you resurrect that thing and you give it
[1:18:52] power
[1:18:57] oh come on somebody the only way that
[1:19:00] people walk around with a pity party is
[1:19:02] because they give it life
[1:19:04] the only way
[1:19:07] you ain't got to live under the bondage
[1:19:08] of the devil not a day one more time you
[1:19:11] ain't got to live under depression you
[1:19:12] ain't got to live under anxiety and all
[1:19:14] of those things are back problems and
[1:19:16] cancer and mind battles you are the one
[1:19:18] that's given that thing life i choose to
[1:19:21] live
[1:19:22] i choose to worship god i choose to
[1:19:25] stand on my two feet and proclaim the
[1:19:27] ver the very liberty of jesus christ
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:34] you stack these things up right here
[1:19:36] you stack this word up you stack this
[1:19:38] word up and you point back to them this
[1:19:40] is where we came over
[1:19:42] and this make it down mark it down as a
[1:19:44] memorial
[1:19:46] as a memorial that you can go back and
[1:19:48] remember remember
[1:19:51] remember what you came out of
[1:19:57] there's power in remembrance
[1:20:00] but not the devil's remembrance
[1:20:03] there's power in remembrance
[1:20:05] i'm deciding i'm gonna burn the bridge
[1:20:09] for there's no way for me to get back
[1:20:11] over there
[1:20:14] i don't know who i'm preaching to but
[1:20:16] i'm preaching
[1:20:18] set it up as a memorial that you
[1:20:20] remember this you tell your children you
[1:20:22] tell your children this how we came over
[1:20:24] you mark it down this how i got the holy
[1:20:26] ghost and the bible said in acts chapter
[1:20:28] 2 and verse 38 repent every one of you
[1:20:31] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:20:33] jesus christ for the remissions of your
[1:20:35] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:20:37] the holy ghost this promise is unto you
[1:20:39] and to your children as many as our lord
[1:20:41] our god shall call what the church had
[1:20:43] in pentecost was her inalienable right
[1:20:46] and it cannot be taken away from her
[1:20:48] and if god is still calling the
[1:20:50] apostolic days are not over yet mark it
[1:20:53] down you can have the holy ghost micah
[1:20:56] you can have it
[1:20:58] sharon knows you can have reagan and
[1:21:00] india and titus
[1:21:04] can apollo john and dan can have the
[1:21:06] holy ghost
[1:21:19] joshua ran his race
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:22] georgie carter ran her race
[1:21:24] congressman upshaw ran his race
[1:21:26] had hannah wright ran her race but you
[1:21:29] got something to remember young people
[1:21:31] you got something to remember brian of
[1:21:33] jesus christ you can point back he's
[1:21:35] just saying yesterday today and forever
[1:21:37] he got me out of that hole one time
[1:21:39] he'll get me out of the hole again
[1:21:42] [Applause]
[1:21:44] david would say in psalms 31 and 15 my
[1:21:48] times
[1:21:50] are in my hand
[1:21:55] my times
[1:21:57] are in
[1:21:58] thy hand
[1:21:59] deliver me from the hand of my enemies
[1:22:02] and from them that persecute me
[1:22:04] so here david is saying everything that
[1:22:07] is pertaining unto him was under the
[1:22:09] control and the disposal of god and he
[1:22:12] would live as long as god said that he
[1:22:15] would live
[1:22:19] i don't know what the future looks like
[1:22:22] but i know i'm in good hands
[1:22:26] i can't tell you what tomorrow looks
[1:22:28] like
[1:22:29] but i had a pastor tell me a couple
[1:22:30] weeks ago
[1:22:31] my future is clear
[1:22:35] it was clear wasn't it sister julia
[1:22:37] it's clear
[1:22:39] it's clear god's got your timing and
[1:22:41] when god speaks anything he forces it to
[1:22:44] a place and if you go to studying out
[1:22:46] the message of junction of time take it
[1:22:48] down write it down listen to it this
[1:22:50] week couple times three or four times
[1:22:52] but the junction of time it's one of the
[1:22:53] most powerful to me it's one of the most
[1:22:54] powerful messages and you'll get nuggets
[1:22:56] out of there like nobody's business but
[1:22:58] brother branham is coming and he's
[1:23:00] preaching about the junction of time
[1:23:02] that there is junctions on the road the
[1:23:04] highways that you and i work at and what
[1:23:05] we drive on but what is it it's a
[1:23:08] changeover a junction is a changeover on
[1:23:10] the road it's a blending of roads the
[1:23:12] two are coming and you're watching
[1:23:15] you've got to make a decision which way
[1:23:17] you want to go it is a junction of time
[1:23:20] and you remember that that the bible
[1:23:21] said in revelations chapter 3 when he
[1:23:24] was speaking to the church and to give
[1:23:26] the angel that the angel was come to say
[1:23:29] that this is given unto you that the key
[1:23:32] would be to him to open and no man
[1:23:35] shutteth and to shut and no man open and
[1:23:38] here the bible said jesus is standing
[1:23:40] there preaching to the church age the
[1:23:42] philadelphian church age he said i have
[1:23:44] set before thee an open door that no man
[1:23:48] can shut for thou has a little strength
[1:23:52] for thou has little strength and has
[1:23:54] kept my word and become has not denied
[1:23:57] my name
[1:23:59] but notice what he is doing he is saying
[1:24:01] he is saying to you i have set before
[1:24:03] you an open door and we realize that
[1:24:06] this last stage the six age and the
[1:24:08] seventh age are an overlapping they are
[1:24:10] melting together there is a junction of
[1:24:13] time and there's never been a time like
[1:24:16] the last two ages when you watch the
[1:24:18] spirit of revelation of who god is
[1:24:20] blossom out in these last two ages like
[1:24:23] it has here in the six age and the
[1:24:25] seventh age brother branham said the six
[1:24:27] age came to abrupt end he said he said
[1:24:30] it didn't come to abrupt end he said it
[1:24:32] just flowed right into the next age
[1:24:36] and here it was overlapping and he said
[1:24:38] i have set before you an open door and
[1:24:40] we all know that jesus told us over in
[1:24:43] john chapter 10 he said i am the door to
[1:24:46] the sheepfold and if you go and i'm not
[1:24:48] going to spend much time on it but if
[1:24:49] you you go and study out what this
[1:24:52] shepherd is that over in the eastern
[1:24:54] country that the shepherd actually
[1:24:56] becomes the door he lays down at the
[1:24:59] door so nothing can come in and nothing
[1:25:02] can go out unless it comes by the
[1:25:04] shepherd and jesus said i have set
[1:25:07] before you an open door we know who the
[1:25:10] door is it's never been like this before
[1:25:12] all the other five ages they were
[1:25:14] looking at it they were looking at it
[1:25:16] through the reformation but here we are
[1:25:18] with an eagle eye anointing
[1:25:21] and not only is do we see the door but
[1:25:24] we see the opening of the door
[1:25:27] there is an entrance that is being
[1:25:29] ministered under the bride of jesus
[1:25:31] christ and you're realizing that god is
[1:25:34] who he said he is that jesus is god that
[1:25:38] there's no other name like the name of
[1:25:40] jesus christ there's nobody like our
[1:25:42] lord there's nobody more powerful than
[1:25:44] our lord it's only in the name of the
[1:25:46] lord jesus christ that the sick are
[1:25:48] healed it's only in the name of jesus
[1:25:50] christ that salvation comes it's only in
[1:25:53] the name of jesus christ that cancer is
[1:25:55] defeated it's only in the name of jesus
[1:25:57] christ that the laodicean flu is
[1:25:59] defeated
[1:26:02] but here in this age of melting together
[1:26:04] of the junction of time you are watching
[1:26:07] as there is an overlapping because thou
[1:26:10] has little strength notice what this
[1:26:13] revelation of who he is does it brings a
[1:26:17] strength to the church to stand there in
[1:26:19] the word and to never deny his name this
[1:26:22] open door
[1:26:24] is set before you young people and no
[1:26:26] man can shut it
[1:26:33] it was not the time for the door to open
[1:26:35] in past age
[1:26:38] but here we are
[1:26:39] at a junction
[1:26:41] if you go to listen that message i'm
[1:26:42] gonna point some things out to you
[1:26:44] because you you're gonna you're gonna
[1:26:45] listen to it i know you will but brother
[1:26:47] random brother madam said now he said
[1:26:48] you watched those junctions every single
[1:26:50] time that there was a junction there was
[1:26:52] there was angels there was signs that
[1:26:55] were there and miraculous was done to
[1:26:57] prove
[1:26:58] the omnipotence is that right
[1:27:01] is that right
[1:27:02] now notice notice and always in the days
[1:27:05] gone by and the dispensations has always
[1:27:08] come to their end and we hit a junction
[1:27:10] and there's junctions on the highways
[1:27:12] the junction on the road
[1:27:14] that we travel on this world they
[1:27:16] junction on this grand old highway that
[1:27:18] we travel to glory and it always takes
[1:27:20] the miraculous to speak of omnipotence
[1:27:23] and omnipotence is the all-powerful and
[1:27:25] it takes the miraculous to vindicate the
[1:27:27] omnipotence and only the miraculous can
[1:27:30] do that you'll notice
[1:27:33] teaching of the word is a very fine
[1:27:35] thing
[1:27:36] and when it can we when it comes faith
[1:27:39] comes by hearing and hearing the word
[1:27:41] but it always takes the miraculous to
[1:27:43] vindicate that the omnipotence still
[1:27:46] lives and reigns we must
[1:27:49] have the miraculous at every single
[1:27:52] junction in time he performed the
[1:27:54] miraculous and prove that omnipotent
[1:27:56] still was miraculous so there was a
[1:28:00] prophecy and then there it met in time
[1:28:03] and the miraculous was produced
[1:28:06] just like when abraham when abraham had
[1:28:08] been promised for all of those years
[1:28:10] that he was going to bring forth he was
[1:28:12] going to bring forth a child and he
[1:28:14] patiently endured waiting for the
[1:28:16] promise he'd been told that he was going
[1:28:18] to come he had been told that it was
[1:28:20] going to happen but like i told you last
[1:28:23] night don't look at the clock
[1:28:26] look at the promise don't look at the
[1:28:28] calendar don't look at the ears don't
[1:28:31] look at that look don't look back but
[1:28:33] look at what the promise said
[1:28:36] your case is a whole lot better than
[1:28:37] abraham's
[1:28:40] your case a whole lot better than
[1:28:42] sarah's it seemed hopeless it seemed
[1:28:44] impossible but i'm gonna ask you like
[1:28:46] the lord ask them is there anything too
[1:28:48] hard for the lord
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:54] is there anything too hard for the lord
[1:28:58] i'm like paul would say in ephesians 3
[1:29:00] and 20
[1:29:01] unto him that is able
[1:29:03] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:29:05] that we can ever ask or think according
[1:29:07] to the power that worketh in us i
[1:29:10] believe that he's able because he's able
[1:29:12] i believe that he will because he will
[1:29:14] we're not just a people that believe
[1:29:16] that he can i believe that he will
[1:29:19] i don't just believe that he can put me
[1:29:21] in a rapture i believe he will put me in
[1:29:23] a rapture i don't just believe that he
[1:29:25] can heal my pastor i know that he will
[1:29:28] heal my pastor
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:38] but against our odds
[1:29:40] against all the all the time that was
[1:29:42] stacked up before him
[1:29:44] time and science is god's greatest enemy
[1:29:49] because men get caught up in the delay
[1:29:51] of time
[1:29:52] and they think well god hasn't done it
[1:29:54] yet
[1:29:55] but against all these odds abraham
[1:29:57] believed he believed and what was
[1:29:59] abraham doing that day he was sitting
[1:30:02] out there at the tent of the door and he
[1:30:04] was creating an atmosphere
[1:30:06] maybe the party behind it wasn't
[1:30:08] creating the right kind of an atmosphere
[1:30:10] but abraham was out there creating the
[1:30:12] right kind of an atmosphere for the
[1:30:14] miraculous to come and the atmosphere
[1:30:16] was set and when those angels came at
[1:30:19] the junction there melchizedek met him
[1:30:22] and the miraculous took place notice
[1:30:25] what the bible said in genesis 21 that
[1:30:28] at the void at the appointed time that
[1:30:30] the lord visited sarah it was a set time
[1:30:37] so let me say it to you like this
[1:30:39] your miracle is a setup
[1:30:44] your healing is a setup
[1:30:48] oh my i hope i hold myself together just
[1:30:50] now
[1:30:52] my miracles are set up the signs and
[1:30:54] wonders is a setup they're at a set time
[1:30:57] and you may figure everything out in
[1:30:59] your reasoning power but it's a set up
[1:31:01] to show that god is still god and he
[1:31:04] still works miracles and he still does
[1:31:06] the miraculous
[1:31:07] and every time at a junctions the angels
[1:31:10] come
[1:31:12] to prove that he's still the omnipotent
[1:31:21] abraham created abraham created an
[1:31:23] atmosphere i don't know what he was
[1:31:25] doing out there maybe he was
[1:31:26] fellowshipping maybe he was maybe he was
[1:31:29] just thinking about all the promises
[1:31:30] brother saying that he'd been told about
[1:31:32] that he'd been told about his son that
[1:31:34] was that was going to come to pass and
[1:31:36] maybe he got the singing a song
[1:31:38] well there's a happy land a promise over
[1:31:41] in the great beyond i don't know how
[1:31:44] isaac's going to get there but i'm going
[1:31:46] to produce a son
[1:31:49] and he got out there and he created an
[1:31:51] atmosphere
[1:31:52] and he began to worship and all of a
[1:31:54] sudden melchizedek came what did brother
[1:31:56] burnham said that he went over there and
[1:31:59] he started nursing off the bosom of el
[1:32:01] shaddai that he went over there and what
[1:32:04] was he doing i want you to know that el
[1:32:06] shaddai is the strong one he is more
[1:32:09] powerful than any interview your foes
[1:32:11] and all you got to do is nurse on the
[1:32:13] old and the new testament he is the
[1:32:16] breasted one and watch what abraham did
[1:32:19] he nursed on the bosom of el shaddai and
[1:32:22] he pulled out a new body and he pulled
[1:32:24] out a new son
[1:32:28] what are you doing proud of jesus christ
[1:32:31] you're nursing your body change right
[1:32:33] out of our shady eye
[1:32:40] i'm gonna get wrapped up
[1:32:43] tied up
[1:32:44] tangled up in jesus
[1:32:46] [Applause]
[1:32:53] he was creating an atmosphere
[1:32:55] and the miraculous took place
[1:33:03] this third pool cannot be impersonated
[1:33:10] the devil can try all he wants to to tap
[1:33:12] into the resource and the channel that
[1:33:13] we're in brother jerry
[1:33:15] but he don't know nothing about it
[1:33:18] now now i want you i want to make
[1:33:20] something real clear to you i know that
[1:33:22] there's impersonators in the land
[1:33:25] and i'm not foolish enough to think that
[1:33:26] there's no impersonators in the message
[1:33:31] you watch people sometimes how they
[1:33:33] worship and how they how they do things
[1:33:36] they're not
[1:33:37] entering into a worship with him
[1:33:41] worship is not about a show
[1:33:43] but worship is about worship
[1:33:46] it's about praise it's about honor it's
[1:33:48] not about a show
[1:33:50] anything that happens up here let me
[1:33:52] tell you if it happens up here out of
[1:33:54] show you won't get to sing again
[1:33:56] i won't get to sing again i won't get to
[1:33:58] preach again i won't do anything i won't
[1:34:00] do anything that'll hinder this ministry
[1:34:03] but if it's a show
[1:34:05] if it's a show it'll not produce any
[1:34:06] works but if it's a real worship
[1:34:10] and abraham had tapped into a channel of
[1:34:12] worship
[1:34:14] and the bride of jesus christ has tapped
[1:34:16] into a channel of worship
[1:34:18] and you might you might say well i don't
[1:34:20] know if i need to be sitting this close
[1:34:21] or not i you know i'm up here in that
[1:34:23] corner where it seems to be a lot of
[1:34:25] jumping going on i don't necessarily
[1:34:26] know if i need to be up there you might
[1:34:28] stick around
[1:34:29] that angel might bump into you
[1:34:34] but notice what brother branham he comes
[1:34:36] all the way down from christ the mystery
[1:34:38] of god revealed he preaches
[1:34:40] preaches three hours and 57 minutes i
[1:34:42] count that as four hours in my book
[1:34:47] he comes and he preaches a four-hour
[1:34:49] message on christ the mystery of god
[1:34:51] revealed yeah listen to it go listen to
[1:34:53] it
[1:34:54] i listen that thing over a hundred
[1:34:56] sometimes and every time i get something
[1:34:58] new but you come down all the way to the
[1:35:00] end of paragraph 6 37 and you see
[1:35:04] brother brandon he starts singing a song
[1:35:07] he said now if you're if you're if
[1:35:08] you're spiritual he said if you're
[1:35:10] spiritual you catch these things he said
[1:35:12] he said now look he said the clock is at
[1:35:14] two o'clock right on the dot he said
[1:35:17] showing that the second pool has been
[1:35:20] manifested it's time for the third pole
[1:35:23] to come into view and he starts singing
[1:35:26] that song that he's singing about jesus
[1:35:28] coming down and jesus is is the great
[1:35:31] high priest and he said now notice he
[1:35:33] said the third pull is at hand and he
[1:35:36] starts singing that song and he said did
[1:35:38] you watch what he just did when the
[1:35:41] angel got into the worship he took the
[1:35:44] praise to a higher octave showing that
[1:35:47] the third pole was at hand let me say
[1:35:50] this to you you're not a second pool
[1:35:52] people you're a third pool people you're
[1:35:55] the opening of the word and you stand
[1:35:57] here

[1:36:06] produce it the third war the third pole

[1:36:11] it'll produce christ it'll produce sons
[1:36:14] ahead of right it'll produce squirrels
[1:36:16] but more than that it'll produce real
[1:36:19] sons and daughters of god it'll manifest
[1:36:22] exactly what it is

[1:37:59] what's cancer
[1:38:08] notice
[1:38:10] angels appear in the end time all the
[1:38:12] prophets in a signpost point saying this
[1:38:15] day that angels will appear prophets
[1:38:17] will arise and signs and wonders and if
[1:38:20] god did that for those little junctions
[1:38:22] back there what will he do now when all
[1:38:25] hell is turned loose
[1:38:27] if all those signs if those angels came
[1:38:30] back there at those little junctions
[1:38:32] what will he do right now when all hell
[1:38:34] is turned loose he said all heaven will
[1:38:36] turn loose angels appearing signs and
[1:38:39] wonders on the earth and counterfeits
[1:38:41] arising but god is proven which is right
[1:38:44] and which is wrong
[1:38:48] angels have appeared
[1:38:49] all hell has tried to enlarge itself and
[1:38:51] tried to swallow you up but all of
[1:38:53] heaven has turned loose on you
[1:38:56] whatsoever you bind on earth shall be
[1:38:58] bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose
[1:39:00] on earth shall be loosed in heaven oh
[1:39:02] god may the holy ghost be loose
[1:39:07] it's time that you turn him loose in
[1:39:08] your body it's time that you start
[1:39:10] speaking to your body and you must start
[1:39:13] making your body obey your confession
[1:39:15] mind battles it's time for you to learn
[1:39:18] it's time for you to leave i'm turning
[1:39:20] heaven loose on this
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:23] i'm turning heaven loose on our
[1:39:24] prodigals i'm turning heaven loose on
[1:39:26] this knee i'm turned heaven loose on
[1:39:28] this church
[1:39:32] time
[1:39:33] is at hand
[1:39:34] notice when it come time for moses
[1:39:38] time to arise god wouldn't lift a finger
[1:39:42] he didn't lift a finger
[1:39:44] because all those rabbis down there
[1:39:46] thought that the days of miracles were
[1:39:47] gone by they thought that that that god
[1:39:50] had done went out of the existence and
[1:39:52] he didn't do those things no more
[1:39:53] brother donny
[1:39:56] but he wouldn't even lift a finger
[1:39:59] until out of that humble little tribe of
[1:40:01] levi there came one by the name of moses
[1:40:06] and what did he do
[1:40:07] he went down there and showed
[1:40:10] that he met an angel
[1:40:12] and he started producing signs and he
[1:40:14] started producing the miraculous because
[1:40:17] the time
[1:40:18] of their deliverance
[1:40:19] was a
[1:40:20] hand this is this is powerful right here
[1:40:24] brother brown said now he said they had
[1:40:26] joseph's bones
[1:40:29] they had something that joseph had in a
[1:40:32] revelation don't you lay don't you leave
[1:40:34] my bones down here when you leave
[1:40:35] because we are promised that we're going
[1:40:37] to leave
[1:40:38] he said now he said they had joseph's
[1:40:40] bones down there and he said that was
[1:40:41] all right he said but they needed a
[1:40:43] fresh scene of god
[1:40:48] you've been sitting here and you you've
[1:40:49] been you've been wondering when when
[1:40:51] will it be my time i i've seen it work
[1:40:55] i've seen it look for a little i worked
[1:40:57] for a little isaac
[1:40:59] that there was a promise
[1:41:00] there was a promise
[1:41:02] and then there came a fulfillment
[1:41:04] i've seen it work for brother ron i've
[1:41:06] seen it work for these others i've seen
[1:41:08] it work for william brown i've seen it
[1:41:09] work for hattie right i've seen it work
[1:41:11] for brother denny i seen it work
[1:41:13] what about my time
[1:41:15] the angels are here
[1:41:18] they are appearing and the omnipotence
[1:41:20] has got to be produced
[1:41:24] he is the one that produces the
[1:41:26] miraculous
[1:41:28] what happened over there in john chapter
[1:41:30] 5
[1:41:31] when there come a certain time in a
[1:41:32] certain season
[1:41:34] become a troubling of the water
[1:41:37] it was not the water it was the angel
[1:41:39] that was on the water
[1:41:41] the effects that you're feeling
[1:41:43] is not humanity
[1:41:45] it's divinity
[1:41:47] and you watch as you begin to enter into
[1:41:49] that realm
[1:41:50] and we realize that there's voices that
[1:41:52] are flowing through here this morning
[1:41:54] you don't see them
[1:41:56] you don't hear them
[1:41:57] but there's an instrument by by the name
[1:41:59] of a radio that you can pull up or you
[1:42:01] can tap into your phone and there's
[1:42:03] voices that are floating all around here
[1:42:06] but it takes somebody with an instrument
[1:42:08] to tap into that channel
[1:42:10] now faith is your tapping into the
[1:42:13] channel
[1:42:14] and if you tap into the channel you'll
[1:42:17] hear that he is still the omnipotent one
[1:42:19] the all-powerful and if you begin to tap
[1:42:22] into that voice he will say i am
[1:42:24] speaking to you in this last day by my
[1:42:27] son and i am saying these things
[1:42:30] if you go to watching what will happen
[1:42:32] when you go to tapping into that channel
[1:42:34] it'll bring down something to your body
[1:42:37] and it'll prove to that that it was your
[1:42:39] time to receive your miracle
[1:42:58] blessed is he that comes in the name of
[1:43:00] the lord
[1:43:04] the time
[1:43:05] is at hand isn't that right
[1:43:08] we're in the greatest dispensation
[1:43:10] that's ever hit
[1:43:12] the earth
[1:43:16] and this is him
[1:43:17] this is him that's doing this work
[1:43:20] who will it be
[1:43:22] who will it be that heals ron spencer
[1:43:27] who will it be that produces a baby
[1:43:31] who will it be that gives strength
[1:43:35] to the weak
[1:43:36] who will it be
[1:43:42] who will it be that'll give life to
[1:43:44] wesley so he can walk
[1:43:47] who will it be that'll go and hunt down
[1:43:49] that'll hunt down our lost who will it
[1:43:52] be that'll go where it seems like it's
[1:43:54] impossible to go but god will have some
[1:43:56] humanity
[1:43:59] god will have some humanity and a
[1:44:01] predestinated spot to step in and say
[1:44:03] this is your time this is your moment
[1:44:06] what was it that worked on that little
[1:44:07] lady she says well i see she's got a
[1:44:09] prayer card in her hand i don't need to
[1:44:11] go pray for her but god dropped on her
[1:44:13] heart go pray for that woman give her
[1:44:15] your seat what was he working through
[1:44:18] humanity
[1:44:21] which he went through that line she said
[1:44:24] but the prophet looked at her said well
[1:44:26] that that thing's already taken care of
[1:44:28] that little lady up there in that
[1:44:30] balcony the lord did the work while you
[1:44:32] was up there in that little balcony
[1:44:35] you've been waiting for me to do
[1:44:36] something over top of you but it's
[1:44:38] already been done
[1:44:41] it's been shown before your eyes
[1:44:44] this is melchizedek
[1:44:48] ain't that right
[1:44:49] this is him this is him that stood on
[1:44:52] that platform this is the same one
[1:44:55] we're not producing something that that
[1:44:57] we're trying to work up in our own human
[1:44:59] emotion and try to elaborate and try to
[1:45:01] make ourselves something this is the
[1:45:03] lord jesus christ
[1:45:10] last weekend i was told
[1:45:17] i was told
[1:45:19] because i was in another world
[1:45:21] but i was told that there was
[1:45:23] there was like a tongue and
[1:45:24] interpretation that went forth from the
[1:45:27] audience
[1:45:28] you can take this you can take this
[1:45:30] however you want to but
[1:45:32] i know what was happening
[1:45:34] and these young people can identify but
[1:45:35] they were
[1:45:36] to me i didn't know what was happening
[1:45:38] but i went back and what people referred
[1:45:40] to me and told me
[1:45:42] you remember when brother branham would
[1:45:43] talk about those
[1:45:45] how they would talk over there
[1:45:47] in the foreign country with those clicks
[1:45:49] and those clacks
[1:45:50] how that they would make certain word
[1:45:52] they they use the language like
[1:45:54] they click
[1:45:57] last weekend i i don't know if you
[1:45:58] watched it or not but you could you can
[1:46:00] hear it on the streaming
[1:46:01] but there began began to be a word that
[1:46:04] came forth
[1:46:07] and the word was going forth under
[1:46:10] an element of time
[1:46:13] and showing that heaven had come down
[1:46:17] and the word said hey hey hey hey
[1:46:22] i am here
[1:46:24] i am here
[1:46:25] listen unto my servant
[1:46:28] who was that speaking of me
[1:46:30] absolutely not
[1:46:32] it was speaking of him
[1:46:34] and then you watch the work
[1:46:38] of the servant
[1:46:40] you watch them as they begin to work
[1:46:42] but notice
[1:46:45] you can get offended at this or however
[1:46:47] you want to take it
[1:46:49] maybe i shouldn't say it
[1:46:54] i'll just say it in this way
[1:46:56] but god had used this this this sister
[1:47:00] and said i can't use you
[1:47:03] i miss you open your mouth
[1:47:07] i don't want to offend you i don't want
[1:47:09] to offend you in any way so i'll just
[1:47:11] say it like that
[1:47:12] god can't use your mouth unless you open
[1:47:14] it
[1:47:16] god can't oh god can't you you can't you
[1:47:19] can't be used unless you be yielded
[1:47:24] and what did the prophet tell us
[1:47:26] he said the greatest gift of any man is
[1:47:29] to get himself
[1:47:30] out of the way
[1:47:32] this is not about producing carnality
[1:47:34] this is about producing christ
[1:47:36] because this third pool will only
[1:47:39] produce
[1:47:40] the elect
[1:47:41] it'll only produce christ it'll only
[1:47:44] produce proven signs and proven wonders
[1:47:47] because he's come at this time
[1:47:49] for such a certain season
[1:47:55] there was a sister one time that was
[1:47:57] dealing with an issue
[1:48:00] and she said i wondered
[1:48:02] when is my time
[1:48:05] when is my time
[1:48:09] and he said
[1:48:10] right now

[1:48:20] they had they he he said entertained him
[1:48:23] all day long
[1:48:26] he said sirs of the religions of the
[1:48:28] world you've had your time he said but
[1:48:30] now it's his time
[1:48:33] and you watch what he did during that
[1:48:35] time
[1:48:37] it's an angel
[1:48:39] it's an angel at work
[1:48:41] it's an angel that's producing these
[1:48:43] things
[1:48:44] it was an angel that woke up the
[1:48:45] prodigal
[1:48:58] david wondered
[1:49:00] when shall i go
[1:49:03] when shall i go
[1:49:07] these philistines have
[1:49:09] have hurt my family these these devils
[1:49:11] have come in
[1:49:13] surrounded us
[1:49:15] and the word said
[1:49:17] wait here
[1:49:18] wait right here
[1:49:23] but when you hear the sound of a going
[1:49:29] brother brown said to me
[1:49:30] here he was laying under those mulberry
[1:49:32] trees

[1:49:37] all of a sudden there came a wind
[1:49:40] it was an angels that was rustling up
[1:49:42] that mulberry trees
[1:49:44] he said now's your time to go
[1:49:46] and pursue
[1:49:49] oh yeah
[1:49:50] david bestow yourself
[1:49:52] you've been waiting for an answer when
[1:49:54] it's your time to get up and when it's
[1:49:56] your time to fight back
[1:49:58] david it's your time
[1:50:00] david it's your time to rise to the
[1:50:02] challenge
[1:50:05] brother william shared share with me a
[1:50:07] quote last evening he said he said when
[1:50:09] when that when he would go through a dry
[1:50:11] parts time and there's a season of a dry
[1:50:14] parts time he said he said but when you
[1:50:15] again brother began to say
[1:50:17] in the whole armor of christ he said but
[1:50:19] he said but when you begin to see when
[1:50:21] noah knew that the promise was coming he
[1:50:23] said he could feel the wind coming
[1:50:26] he could feel the wind coming and
[1:50:28] showing that it was about to come
[1:50:33] that wind has been blowing just like it
[1:50:36] was blowing in the oneness of unity and
[1:50:38] it sounded off a voice
[1:50:40] but now's your time to go and pursue and
