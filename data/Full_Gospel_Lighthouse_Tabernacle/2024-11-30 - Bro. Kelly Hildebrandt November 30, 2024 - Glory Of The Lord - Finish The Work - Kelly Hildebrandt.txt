arrived in it was a little late when we got in but we're here uh one time when we came it was three three days to get here wasn't quite that this time it was just a few extra hours but we're here and just en enjoying your beautiful weather for you it's cold to to us it's just like we got we flew into Hawaii that's that's what it feels like to us you guys got green grass and haven't seen any palm trees but maybe there's a few hanging around somewhere uh we've had a beautiful fall up until about 2 weeks ago and uh we had 5 in of snow and then we had s another 12 in of snow within about a week time period and the temperature went from plus 16 celsus and it dropped down uh brother Jonas told me this morning when he was driving it was -30 celsus so so we're kind of in a warming Trend right here with Y all where you're at I know to you it's cold but to us it feels quite well it feels good it feels good we have a deep appreciation for brother Ron and for the Spencer family and we certainly do love sister Nancy she's over here she's a real friend to us over the years love her with all of our heart and I was thinking about as sister Nancy one time I don't believe it's going to be very long we'll see brother Homer again and those that have lost your loved ones we're looking forward to the general resurrection of of the Saints of the Living God that's why we strive is for that also it's a blessing to see brother Vern sister Kathy God bless you we love you all and and brother alen sister Tracy uh we love them we love you all amen and brother Paul and sister roshani God

to be here with every one of of us with every one of you thank you for making us feel so at home it's a wonderful atmosphere in your assembly and we certainly do appreciate the Lord and his moving amongst the people but if you have your Bibles tonight let's just turn to the word of the Lord and I don't know uh if we'll stand if we can stand I'm going to put my timer on here make sure I don't go too much over time but you pray we'll preach You Pull and we'll preach I'd like to turn to Exodus 40: 33 to 35 incredible scripture that we're going to read here one that no doubt has been read many times over this Podium we' like to take a context out of it tonight Moses has just finished building the Tabernacle of tents it says and he reared up the court round about the Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the hanging of the Gate of the Court gate so Moses finished the work let's say finish the work finish the work say it one more time finished the work then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud Abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle God bless you you may have your seats tonight I'd like to speak tonight for a few moments of time on the glory of the Lord and if I could i' like to subtitle it finished the work finished the work it must have been an incredible day when Moses after having collected all of the articles for the temple and the historians have different different timelines and different days but they he was collecting for approximately for 8 months or more and then they had to do the actual construction I don't know about you but construction isn't always the always the pleasantest of things sometimes things go good sometimes things don't go well but it comes a time when everything is complete as we'd say the last nail has been put in it's been filled and and we would say that it's finished I don't know about you but when a construction project is finished I feel like going and celebrating because it's finished there's nothing like something being finished right in this case over here Moses is is doing this according to a blueprint it wasn't of his own design it wasn't of his own making but it was a blueprint that he had received from God and that blueprint was important because it was laying and opening up the door to the mind of God that would not just be for the times of Moses and their generation ation of time but would transcend all the way to where we are living today this was only a temporal habitation this was only a a place where God was going to come and meet the people but it was part of of his great architectural mind and it's so wonderful to see that Moses didn't put his own interpretation to it he didn't put his own ideas into it he he did it according to the way that God had had made had shown him on the mount right we can look at it today there's many different interpretations of things like that but God still has a proper Channel by which he works that's right and if we follow into the channel according to the word of the Lord then God is always going to allow his glory to come upon the people amen I think this when they were doing this here and Moses has finished the work and the work uh the word finished in in the dictionary means complete means perfect one of the parts that really caught my attention was that it says that it was polished to the highest degree of perfection in other words there was not one thing out of place every latchet every little piece that had to be in place was in its proper place and and it was not Moses saying it was finished but but the Bible declares and the work was finished I say I say Lord we're close to the Finishing Line ourselves in this generation I want to say that the work amen the work is being finished amen I I say if you don't know the Lord now it's a good day to get to know him amen amen this is the day of the Lord we know that God had taken Moses up into his presence and showed him the Heavenly pattern to build the Tabernacle the tents and he finished the work in Hebrews 8:5 it says who serve unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he is about to make the Tabernacle fore saith he that thou make all things let's say all things tonight all things let's say with some passion all things all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount amen so Moses was very very cautious in what he did and I make this a very strong point tonight because it's very important that we follow the word of the Lord amen sometimes the people wonder why do we praise the lord well we have a reason to praise the Lord amen sometimes people wonder why we get happy in church because we have a lot to be happy about we have a lot of things to praise God about thank the Lord for we look at our troubles but God doesn't look at our troubles I I read something I thought was incredible God will allow the worst things to happen to you to bring out the best in you many times we wonder why the Lord allows certain things he's just trying to polish the diamond he's trying to bring things to a certain place and when I look back in life I realize the hand of God that has been over my life over my my wife and myself over our our lives and you start to realize that the most difficult ult times became actually the most glorious victories that we ever had in life we sometimes wonder can we take another day and I say yes we can amen I would say it like this tonight is there's no quit in us what are we going to go to where are we going to go some people say this message doesn't have enough I say it has more than enough to take us from here all the way into the Rapture and all the way into the glories of the Lord this message is what we needed for the hour that we living in today and to discount it is to Discount what God is doing amongst his people today I say thank you Lord for this message thank you Lord for your grace thank you Lord for your mercy and thank you Lord for opening our eyes of understanding so that we can follow in the footsteps of our maker amen we know that that that that was a condescending God we know that it was God above us and God With Us and and now it's God in us amen and and God had to move everything a certain way what was he doing he was hiding his plan from the enemy amen because the enemy could never figure out what is God trying to do amen and we come all the way 6,000 years later we can look back on History we can say yeah the Lord was doing this here and the Lord did this here and now he's doing this today and I say don't miss your day of hesitation amen God is wanting to unveil himself openly to the people amen we no longer look into a into the book obscurely we look into the book with Revelation in this hour amen somebody say praise the Lord prise Lord amen God is wanting to get inside his people amen I'll say this on the onset of this meeting here tonight is they enjoyed the glory of the Lord because the Bible said when it was complete the glory of the Lord came down upon the upon the the tent and and it had an effect on the Ministry of that day but today the glory of the Lord can come on you amen today the glory of the Lord doesn't want to just give us anointing on the outside amen but the glory of the Lord wants to come to the inside of the inside amen he wants to share his glory with you he wants you to shine in all of his Illumination in this hour amen and we have a lot that we can be thankful for amen I also want to read Colossians 1: 26 just to put a bit of a platform down it says even the mystery which hath been hid if you could just give me just a shade more monitors make a squeal but just a shade more my voice is kind of giving me some issues today even the Mysteries which hath been hid from the ages from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you amen let's say Christ in me Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus that word perfect in Christ Jesus does not mean that you're not going to have the flesh problems that we deal with but what it means is that he's going to bring you into a place of maturity amen this message will bring you to a place of maturity I want to say it is bringing us to a place of maturity or it's bringing us to a place of full age Amen in other words we're no longer in childhood anymore we're no longer as a teenager anymore we're we are men and women who are ready for a Rapture amen my message over the years is never changes we're having a Rapture God has planned it he's going to have a people we believe we're part of those people amen and we need the glory of the Lord living within our heart amen not just a flesh anointing you see many times we can have a good meeting but then you talk to somebody Monday and it's like were they even in church where are they at you wonder sometimes in your heart we had special meetings and you have special meetings you have great ministry that's here but in Monday morning it seems like all hell breaks loose and you wonder where is God I want to tell you where he is he's inside of your heart amen Satan's only trying to see if it's real in your our heart amen we don't understand the the mind of God we want everything to be good we want to be patted on the shoulder all the time we want everything to go our way but that's not how God works God will allow Satan to turn your world upside down just to see what you're going to do about it amen but I want to say this with a declaration this morning amen we are more than Overcomers we are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we're part of him and he's part of us amen he's living within our heart and we're shining forth in the glory of almighty God hallelujah we are his children not to be babied around where his children were rugged people amen coming to a place of perfection amen God is a god of order there's nothing that God does is out of order that's right when I consider and and I always love to talk about it that he tellthe stars and he calleth them all by their names amen he's acquainted with every one of them amen he just didn't just didn't put everything into disarray but he's the one that can take chaos and Chaos in our lives and turn it into a wonderful thing amen he can bring order into our lives amen one time when when you weren't serving the lord you watch your your life not out of control but you give your heart to the Lord it doesn't mean you won't be tempted but what it does do it gives you an order in life amen and God is a god of order that's why he showed Moses the the example that how he wanted the Tabernacle man built amen because he's a god of order can you imagine a God that would just have everything just in disarray all over the place that's not how our God works as brother brandham said the wheels of the Lord turn slowly but they turn true Amen in our lives they turn slow many times but they turn true amen as that one sister had to say I'm not what I used to be I'm certainly not what I want to be I'm not not what I used to be and we can see the working of the Holy Ghost in each one of our Lives amen do you love the Lord tonight amen amen that's why the scripture said the Earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the of the waters God was going to move it into a place that would be a paradise for his children amen Satan's had 6,000 years now and he's made a complete disaster of it amen you can change your political leader we can change our political leader I'll tell you what it's going to do it's only going to bring us that much closer to Rapture somebody's with me tonight amen we're looking for they're looking for a savior I've got the Savior what they need is Christ in their lives amen what they don't want is Christ but what we need is Christ in our lives and he's the only way into the Sheepfold it's through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen they want to bring order to it but God said that he'll bring order back into a position amen and we know that it's going to be order when he takes the Throne of his father David amen and things that are to be said now remember these are only temporal gifts and type now we know that Moses in building the Tabernacle in the wilderness or preparing it he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in heaven so the Earthly things only express what the Eternal things are and if this Earth that we live in today being so great we love it we we love it uh excuse me that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if that if this here is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's Eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man here struggling to LIF somebody in a hospital or in a sick bed or in an accident struggling and death rattling in their throat pulling and crying screaming for Life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that see it just doesn't do it amen and we're struggling for that time we're looking to that time amen but I'm thankful to almighty God for the Holy Ghost in This Hour amen which is the earnest of our inheritance amen it gives us a a resting place in life amen sir I would see Jesus says may I go and Recon it now and say this that I believe that the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can take the right attitude toward that promise now if Moses would have decided I'm going to build this the way I wanted it to be built the glory of the Lord would never fill in amen if in your heart you're not prepared to empty everything out of your heart why would he come and fill your heart amen he want you to empty it out and allow Christ to come into your heart amen so the glory of God can be inside of your bosom amen you say brother Kelly why do you preach like this I think one of the greatest things that we need amongst ourselves is the Holy Ghost meetings and not just falling on the Flesh of a man but falling on the inside of a man amen completely changing that individual into a new creation in Christ Jesus Hallelujah that'll put a bounce on your heel on Monday and I'll put a bounce on your heel on Friday amen you come to the house of the Lord give me another charge oh god of your presence Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord but you have to take the right attitude toward the word if you take a wrong attitude toward it then it's not going to have any result as I ministered to the people back home on a couple Wednesday night a nights ago and and I and my Ministry was very simple talk topic do you have confidence in your prayer a lot of people pray as a hope so that's a lot of people pray as I don't know if it's going to happen we've got to change our attitude toward him amen we've got when we ask the Lord to do something we've got to have a confidence in our heart that he either keeps his word or he doesn't keep his word amen if we take the right attitude toward it he's going to keep his word you may say I don't see any results who's looking at results it's up to us to believe the word of God Amen we have some Believers here tonight amen do you believe the word of God you pray God will answer your prayer we got to believe the word of God we have to have confidence in him brother brandham talked about a man that was that was kind of had a little had a little problem with brother brandham when it came to water baptism in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the man went home he was a contractor he went to sleep that night and he started to build a house and he decided that he didn't want to B that bay window shouldn't have been there am I don't know about you all but I have some contractors sometimes they they do things differently you want they say that's not how I want it come on that's for free and the Man in the dream the the owner of the house came home he looked at his blueprint he looked at the house and it wasn't according to the blueprint that's right the man said I want you to take it down and I want you to make it according to the blueprint that's right the next day he talked to brother Brown and he said told him this dream he had he said well there Creek CR down here for you to get baptized in there's only one way to approach God Amen we got to approach him the right way with the right mental attitude all the time amen we think we can dilly dally around our God is a god of order amen there's nothing out of order but you come the Divine Way that God has according to scripture and you watch what's going to happen in your life amen in all of our Lives amen I think brother brownon one time we have too many quack Builders if you go back into Exodus 35 you'll find out that God anointed man with specific gifts in order to to do the work that was laid out before him right they were going to work with all different types of natural articles in this hour God has anointed us special men in order to to be able to minister the gospel the fivefold ministry amen people think we don't need a five full ministry I I say it like this as God put it in the Bible you take it up with the boss that's right it's not up to me to argue with you CU I'm not going to argue with you you don't want a five full ministry that's up to you but I know I need a fivefold Ministry amen I need him to minister to my heart amen we need the washing of the Water by the word amen God has an ordained way in that's the way that he's going to minister to his people amen people say well I've got the prophet well we all have the prophet amen but we're supposed to do what the prophet said to do amen he said go to church that's what we do we're here tonight in church amen I traveled a lot of miles to be here with you all in church amen why we're here to to allow the glory of the Lord to come down amen you say can to come down in my car it's came down in my car many times can it come down in my house has come down in my house many times amen but there's something about being with the saints of God I hope this okay tonight there's something about being with the saints of God you start singing the songs of glory amen something starts to stir within your heart amen you hear the word come forward something starts to move within your soul amen what is it it's the glory of the Lord It's the atmosphere I say thank God for the fivefold ministry I I tip my hat to every one of them amen we need them remember years ago they told me there was no more Ministry I said well who took it out God put it in we're still here amen but I'm looking more at the coming of the Lord every day he finished the temple the Bible said the glory of the Lord came down upon it if we look at Solomon and the temple that he built took him seven years to build that Temple I look at it similar to the New Testament Church we've had seven Church ages some people want to put us into an eighth Church age but it's not in the scripture it's not just not biblical there's seven Church ages or seven prophetic Ministries we've had reformers and then we had a major prophet amen he came for a reason and for a purpose that wasn't himself but it was God he he would even declared himself you think I was talking about me he said no not me you think I was talking about the angel I'm not talking about him but we we're feeding on the body word of the son of man amen so God knows exactly what he's doing amen he doesn't need an extra Messenger to to help us that's right I heard one brother one time say that that this message only brings me to the open to The Awakening of the five wise and five foolish virgins we look for somebody to take us further in that and I said who is it is it you hope this okay I I'm I'm feel at home I said if this message is only to awaken us who's going to take us all the way through who's going to be the one and yet this m yet this uh uh Prophet that we've had brother brandham he gave us exactly what God wanted the church to have amen I'm not looking for another one to rise we already have it right amen and it's doing a good job as far as I'm concerned this message is our life it's our everything amen what are you looking for brother Kelly I'm looking for the dead in Christ to rise right I'm looking for a new body yes sir amen I I'm I'm just waiting for the Finish Line that's what we're all waiting for is for the Finish Line that's where we want to go across amen I say the word has been fully restored I think the the Revelation and the Mysteries that had to be revealed according to Revelation 10:7 they've been revealed amen people want to argue about this and that say Hey just let's let's just read what's in the book what's in the scripture what's in the on the tapes amen we have everything we have need of we look into it and we can see by by the grace of God and by faith we can acknowledge and see our names in the Lamb's Book of Life amen and we're striving in in for that great hour of of our change amen I believe one day it's going to be a finished last one's going to come in amen I'm not looking at trying to save the world World we're only brother Bram says we're only sinning we're are saying we're only pulling in the ones that are there whoever they are it's not up to me to determine that amen but this message is not to save the world this message is for a bride her name is Mrs Jesus Christ and one day it's going to be over amen I say and I encourage every one of you don't dilly dally around amen amen be fervent for God Amen be a Christian on Monday and Tuesday every day be a Christian amen let your light shine let your fathers and mothers let your light shine before your children amen they're watching God in your life and sometimes you would have to say I don't know if I'd want that God in my life on hope that don't don't hurt too bad amen but we we've got to we've got to be real men we got to be Christians in this hour amen we have to be full grown we've got to know how to conduct ourselves and carry ourselves amen this the the the the thing is winding up amen politically it's winding up amen the religious world is winding up amen but the bride is get getting ready for for a takeoff time amen I say with all that I have within my heart tonight don't miss it amen keep yourself focused on the word you say brother Kelly if you only knew my life if you only knew my life amen we all have a story to tell but we can say one thing has been the Amazing Grace of almighty God that has brought us and it's keeping us thus far press forward it's just about done it's just about over amen don't give up now right amen there should be no give up in anybody's heart and in their life all the devil tries to comes and tells you the about church just kick them Moses finished his work came a time when Solomon would finish his work in 2 Chronicles 51-14 I love the scripture and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy Place 2 Chronicles 511 14 for all the priests that were present were Sanctified and did not wait by course also the Levites which were the singers all of them of ASF and hemon and judian and their sons and their Brethren being array in white linen having symbols and Sal trees and harps stood at the East End of the altar with 120 priests sounding the with trumpets I did a study years ago on on David and and the orchestra that he had and they said he in certain times he would have have a thousand piece Orchestra and they would pay play by their course so one part would come out and another part would come in and they'd keep keep repetive uh keep playing for days on end I thought if they could do that that's absolutely incredible amen without the baptism of the Holy Ghost what about us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost everyone sounding trumpets and it came to even to pass as trumpeters and singers were as one to make one a sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord Lord when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praised the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God Amen when I was thinking of of that Moses's and and and brother Bram said that Solomon took the exact same blueprint as what was given to Moses and and he built the house according to that blueprint amen had to have us outer Court inner court and the holiest of holy amen and in the holiest of holies it had to have the have the the Mana which was inside of it amen and we know that we don't live by bread alone but we live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen every word of it amen it's fresh every day amen you can read something yesterday and read it the next day and it's fresh all over again amen and they built this temp temple and it must have been a beautiful Temple all the gold overlaid on it everything was there and they were having a dedicational service that to in the presence of the Lord and the Bible says that the house of the Lord was filled with the glory of the Lord amen I I think what a wonderful thing is that if they if you would have your life dedicated unto the Lord a temple a tabernacle fill with the Holy Ghost a life of service used for the glory of God Amen and they had everything in Array I would have loved to be there that day on the inauguration of it amen when every trumpet everything become one voice as one sound amen that the glory of the Lord filled the whole house to the place where they couldn't even even uh stand to minister for the glory of God what would happen here tonight in this Tabernacle in this church tonight with Tabernacles of the Holy Ghost Amen in such a a one Accord to to the word of God that the glory of God would fall down among the people amen until you'd lose consciousness of who you are or who's around you and all that would matter is you and almighty God Amen I'd say we'd have an oldfashioned Holy Ghost filled meeting one more time amen not wondering about tomorrow or the next week but worried about what's happening right now amen that God would take control Hallelujah I say Lord may it happen I look for every service that I'm in amen for the glory of God to fill the house we lose consciousness of where we are and what we're doing all that matters at that moment is you and God Amen sicknesses start to leave amen problems start to leave people's lives marriages are restored everything comes into a union again why because the glory of God would fill the house house must have been a grand time David wanting to build it but of course he wasn't allowed to but it didn't stop him from preparing he knew that his son would build it so he started Gathering all the necessary things that he needed to gather amen but Solomon had the privilege to building Solomon's blueprint was identical to the blueprint that Mo that Moses had had amen and he didn't build it the way he wanted to build it he built it the way God wanted to be built and if God wanted to build his church upon the the prophets and upon that that's God's Own Business it's up to us just to take it and say Lord I'm going to walk in what you want me to walk in Amen in the dedicational message in 62 because we must always stay line by line with the scripture brother Brown Say now if you notice Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern that Moses saw in Mount sini in heaven Moses when he returned from his vision pitched the tent made it just exactly like he saw in heaven and when Solomon built the temple he made it just exactly the way he seen the pattern the type amen Moses pitched the tent for a Perpetual type in other words something that would continue because it was moving from place to place but Solomon he made the Tabernacle just exactly in the fashion that Moses had seen in heaven it was all put together set in order just exactly and he says what a spiritual application we could apply here that we never are never to leave the scripture stay exactly with the pattern amen and one one brother said he was looking for all the quotes about going to church I said well Paul and they said we should be in church he said be gathered together that more as you see that day approaching amen that's the scripture amen if we're supposed to follow scripture then I say let's follow the scripture amen and brother Bram said that's the reason I believe that the way the first church was patterned that's the way the next one should be patterned that's the way everyone should be patterned just the way it was at the beginning amen so if there was a a book of Acts church I believe we're the continuation of the book of Acts amen if the Holy Ghost fell upon them the Holy Ghost will fell upon will fall Upon Us amen if there was healings there's still healings today amen if they're speaking in tongues they're still speaking in tongues today if there's prophecies they're still prophesying today amen why we've got the same church hallelujah amen I feel like shouting right now my voice is just starting to give out on me but you pray for me amen church we we we should not discount ourselves amen we should let the Lord Lord move in any way he wants to move amen if he wants to sweep over say let him sweep amen if you want to get happy you just get happy it's not going to affect me at all amen it doesn't matter if if if God wants his way that's what we should be concerned about that God moves amongst the people amen you say well I want some deeper Revelation what's deeper than God moving on your heart come on church amen I'm preaching like I preach at home so forgive me for it but but I just I'm just so zealous for for my own people I say Lord we've got to move allow the Lord to move amongst us amen why do we want to hinder the lord well the music's too loud or the song leaders too loud or they sing too fast or they sing too slow or it's too hot or it's too cold church we got to lay a side all of our sides amen and get into worship Hallelujah everything has to be in its order you say I don't feel like it today then give a praise offering anyhow amen you say I'm just tired and wore out praise Him anyhow amen give him glory in the house tonight hallelujah praise Him anyhow praise him when it's sunny praise him when it's windy praise him when it's cloudy it don't make no difference Just Praise the Lord we need to praise Him amen the Bible says that he inhabits the Praises of his people it's no wonder the devil wants to bring that down I say bring it [Applause] up worship Him in spirit and in truth people say you're going to have a lot of Frolic brother brother Kelly I never seen the Holy Ghost get out of out of get out of order in anyway the building was a great building it was a great grander Solomon made overlaid with silver precious stones gold type of deity beautiful beautiful place the people had a great expectation they didn't know what was going to happen but everything came in its order just like tonight everyone prepared for service musicians start to play could immediately feel the Holy Spirit moving in the back room they started to worship you could start feeling the presence of the Lord amen Prayer Warriors No Doubt been praying at home an expectation I hope you came with an expectation and when everything got to a certain place something started to happen we know on the day of Pentecost it was out they had to come in one heart one mind one Accord took them 10 days to get there but they got there and they they were anointed they were filled with the Holy Ghost but you know back in the time of Solomon even the grander of the temple that they had everything wasn't in place until the Ark of the Covenant actually came into its sockets when the Ark of the Covenant dropped in the veil closed behind it they started to get ready for that inauguration ceremony Solomon did exact ly as as he was shown by the blueprint everything was in its order and I love how the Bible is so detailed on exactly what transpired everything running down into its course even 120 trumpeters everything running down to its course and it says when they become to make one noise then the glory of the Lord fell and it filled all of the temple with the glory of God Amen to the place where they they ultimately couldn't even administer to what they wanted to administer I thought if if that could happen with a natural Temple how much more for these temples that are made without hands for the end time Church the end time bride of Jesus Christ coming to its final spot final place what would the Lord want for his people then I read about brother brandham how when brother Brandon would Minister sometimes he said I found myself sitting on the pulpit he said I come to myself he said I got out of the pulpit he said the next thing the Holy Spirit struck me again and he said I started running down the preaching down the aisle rolling up my Pat leg and he say I come to myself again and he said really what am I doing rolling my Pat leg I thought if that could happen there I believe that that we can have that atmosphere and that Spirit amongst us amen it shouldn't be something that's foreign it should be something that that that is a desire within our heart amen I just don't want to know the doctrine of him I want to know the power of him I want I want the spirit of him living through my life amen we've had a lot of Doctrine but what is the doctrine has just made people better arguers I look at it we we need to let that word permeate our heart heart permeate our soul Amen to the place when Lord whatever you want I'm here I'm your servant it's not that you try to work it up or work it down they never did that they just got in one mind one Accord amen become one voice and worshiping and praising the Lord and and the glory of the Lord fell in the temple amen if it did it for them in those days and a did it for them on the day of Pentecost I believe that same God is here tonight Amen to do the exact same thing amen if we can get ourselves in position for it Amen brother bradam in the in the message dedication I hope it's okay if I read a few quotes he said he said how beautiful 10 Hebrews 105 but a body has not prepared me showing that God was going to dwell in a body prepared me and when this body had made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed and there was coming forth and God came to his own body which was his bride and there had been 20 temples that God had created was ready for dedication that got all their unbelief I say Lord get our unbelief out of the way that's hindering the people amen they got all their unbelief beat out of them and they gathered in the upper room and waited for 10 days for a dedication service and when completely surrendered God came down again in the shik glory and filled all the house where they were sitting what did God do it was like the ark dropping into its proper rockets for the message of that day God dropped back into his proper Channel not into denomination or into a building made with hands but Into the Heart of men I say may drop again he dropped in this place for the days which said Pro Prophet The Prophet Joel I shall come to pass on the last day I'll pour out my Shak upon All Flesh your sons and daughters and shall prophesy your old young men shall dream dreams old men shall see Visions God came to his resting place where he finds finds rest not in a building but in the heart of his people he finds rest when the word finds a resting place in the heart of the people then they are not tossed as my words about every wind of Doctrine they have a peace and a Stillness and a Harmony and unity with God Amen and the Bible said when they started to say for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and they became one voice amen if you have your Bibles tonight can we just I just like to read psalms 136 will that be okay I love Psalms 136 amen let's read it oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let's say his mercy endureth forever amen can you imagine they got in one mind and one Accord for his mer God is good for his mercy endureth forever and every verse it says the same oh give thanks unto the the god of gods for his mercy endureth forever somebody help me oh give thanks to the Lord of lords for his mercy endureth forever to him who alone doth great wonders for his mercy endureth forever to him that that by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy endureth forever to him that stretched out the Earth above and the waters for his mercy endureth forever I don't know about you church but I say we serve a merciful god amen who's willing to fight your battles for you blessed be the name of the Lord to him that made great lights for his mercy endureth forever the sun to rule by day for his mercy endureth forever the moon and stars to to rule by night for his mercy endureth forever to him that SM Egypt and their firstborn for his mercy endureth forever and brought out Israel from among them for his mercy endureth forever with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm for his mercy endureth forever to him that divided the Red Sea into parts for his mercy endureth forever and made Israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy endureth forever amen but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the Red Seas for his mercy endureth forever I want to say he's defeated every devil amen every enemy he's defeated everything the horse rider is in the ocean Heen Satan is completely helpless why because his mercy endureth forever if we look at ourselves we say yes I I could never make it but God says I've already provided the way for you got to take a hold of it sir believe his word I'm so thankful amen over through Pharaoh his host on the Red Sea for his mercy endureth forever to him which led his people through the Wilderness for his mercy endureth forever to him which smoke great Kings man I can read my name in here and slew famous Kings for his mercy endureth forever amen the enemy that one time had had dominion over your life is no longer in Dominion but he underneath your feet now amen I said it for years he's if you're if he's not under your feet you're at a position amen it's time to put him under our feet [Music] [Applause] again slew famous Kings for his mercy and doth forever Shiloh King of the amorites for his mercy and doth forever and OG the king of Bashan for his mercy and doeth forever and gave their land for Heritage for his mercy and doeth forever even an heritage un to Israel his servant for his mercy and doth forever who REM REM remembered us in our lowest state for his mercy endureth forever and hath let's say hath hath redeemed us from our enemies amen for his mercy endureth forever amen somebody should shout here tonight who giveth food to All Flesh for his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks unto the god of Heaven for his mercy endureth forever I say Church what more could God do for us if he did that for Israel how much more has he done for the Church of the Living God in this generation of time our God is mindful of his people his mercy endureth forever he never chose you because you were a good person he chose you because your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life his mercy endureth forever Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah I got a quote I'll share with you at the at the end of the service brother Brown said that God never chose you because you were good people because we're good people he chose you because your name let's say my name your name was written in the L's book of life before the the foundation of the world Hallelujah we can say with a declaration for his mercy endureth forever when they became in one mind and one Accord the glory of the Lord came upon the people amen it was a beautiful Temple but until the glory of the Lord came onto it it was just a temple amen when we were not a people in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies but when the Lord came AP part of your life what shines out of your life is the glory of God hallelujah oh my I think it's wonderful the glory of the Lord filled all the house Acts 2 which we're very familiar with we know they got into one mind one Accord and the Holy Ghost came upon the people Amen to the place where they actually lost consciousness of who they were they went up into the upper room afraid they came out of the upper room with a great Assurance in their heart amen I would say one moment in the presence of the Lord will change you forever amen just one moment it doesn't take a long time it just takes a moment and if the first church was birthed that way I believe the church in this last hour is birthed the same way amen what does God want to do he wants to have Fellowship When sin stopped the stopped the pl well it moved the plan of God into position but when sin in the Garden of Eden became God above us amen he was he was feared to get into his presence but then we know that the scripture tells us that a god condescended came down to earth amen when he came to Earth it was God walking and talking with the people but that was not the the completion of his plan even though all the grander of the the temples were built if you go to Jerusalem today that Temple Solomon builts not there the one that Ezra rebuilt isn't there amen that's that wasn't what his glory was was was pointed to his glory was pointed to each and every one of us a habitation a place for the Holy Ghost to come and dwell in the lives and the hearts of his people amen hallelujah and God's provide a place of worship that's what's a matter with the church today we're full of theology without any Dynamics in it that's right in other words you've got to have the spark to the gasoline or the gasoline is no more it's not even as good as water as long as there hasn't gotten no spark to it so that's the way no matter how well we're taught how well we'll believe and how much of the Bible that we say is true we and believe and we believe it all true it's got to be the Dynamics it's got to be there the spark to set that word of fire and make it start rolling amen it's got to have it if it don't the church sits still the car sit still you'll sit still but no matter how much you say I sympathize I believe every word of that you got to have something to spark that off to make that 100 octane go to fire rate and the Big Church of God go go to moving on it's God to take the Dynamics with the mechanics nothing wrong with the mechanics but lacking Dynamics he says and I think that's what's a matter with the church today we're lacking the dynamical power to to press this word and make it live for this day Martin Luther had mechanics dynamics of his day John Wesley had them of his day Pentecost had them with their day he says what about our day this is another time the church should be fully grown let's say fully grown now ready to go meet Christ with the manifestation of my with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the Bible operating that great body where he promised that he would meet the people and be worshiped in this great church of his amen what does he want he wants a church that's living a church that's alive amen a church that when when you pray we respect results amen right amen praise the Lord amen I believe that's what he's coming for I believe that with all my heart brother Brown in another place he said he said the church should be on fire for God she should be moving on in the spirit of God and I believe today if we ever need the spirit of God maybe I'm speaking out of to my own people that are listening online if there's anything we ever need is we need a church that is moving on in the fire of God Amen we need to be refilled and refilled and refilled amen and refilled with the Holy Ghost every time I go into service I come with my cup turned up I say Lord here I am today Lord refill me one more time with your presence amen may your word become so real to me it becomes just a natural part part of my being amen hallelujah a church on fire for God a church unconscious of who's sitting around them amen a church that's willing to allow the Holy Spirit to move I believe I'm speaking those kind of people here today amen a church that wants God to move in a dynamic way not just when the music is on but when the music isn't on Amen a church that's moving in the power of God the glory of the Lord filling every life full of the beauty of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord amen do you love the Lord with all your heart amen I'm going to call the musicians forward now if they would come forward I'd like to sing that song Psalms 34 if we could sing that today in the message communion 1957 brother Brown says you're not saved because you a good person you're saved because Christ chose you no man seeks God God seeks man Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first and if we could stop just for a few minutes and realize the great importance of that one thing that it was God who chose you not willing that you should perish but give to you the opportunity and call you and elected you to be his servants what could be more precious than that without having a choice it it would be a total impossibility for any man to seek God for he's by nature is a sinner and he has nothing within him to give a desire to serve God I thank God that he came by each and every one of our ways amen the glory of the Lord you pray for me for tomorrow morning my voice is giving me a little problems tonight but we're going to trust the Lord for it in the morning amen I say Lord here I am where your people what we want is just the moving of the Lord amen it doesn't take a long sermon it doesn't take a short sermon it just takes God to move one time that's let's just sing that song Psalms 34 if you feel like standing stand if you don't then just remain seated tonight I the Lord and he answered me when to live me from every fear those who look on him are [Applause] radi don't never be ashamed never be ashame for this poor
