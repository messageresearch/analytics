[0:15] here's some time ago
[0:16] over in africa i was talking to him
[0:19] to an old saint he said brother brandon
[0:22] i know you believe in the supernatural
[0:24] and i said certainly my brother
[0:26] he said years ago i used to think i was
[0:29] somebody
[0:30] so i thought i was really a christian
[0:32] and he said then up in our church i had
[0:34] to climb a hill
[0:35] where i stopped my little car and said i
[0:37] had to climb a hill about
[0:38] over three or four hundred yards to get
[0:40] around the bushes and things getting up
[0:42] and said we'd have prayer meeting up
[0:44] there and said
[0:46] i thought i was really a christian he
[0:48] said i know
[0:49] all the bible i said it all the hebrew i
[0:52] studied all the
[0:52] right pronunciations of the words and
[0:54] said anybody walk up to me i can talk to
[0:56] him like that about the bible
[0:58] i know what i was talking about he said
[1:00] one night i was going up to church
[1:02] there'd been a lot of conflict in our
[1:04] church said this little
[1:06] party's against one another you know i
[1:07] raised i said yes sir he said oh my road
[1:10] up the hill i was walking
[1:11] and all at once i become conscious
[1:14] that somebody was following me
[1:17] and said i thought i'd wait just a
[1:19] little bit forever it was to catch up
[1:21] and i talked to him a little while
[1:23] as we went up the road you know
[1:26] that's kind of a good thing you just
[1:29] wait a little while
[1:31] it says as i walked up the hill
[1:34] come up a man came up the hill and said
[1:37] he had a bundle on his back
[1:39] they were way bigger than the man and
[1:41] said he was just a
[1:42] painting and a blowing hand making his
[1:45] little short steps trying to get up
[1:47] and i said fella can i help you pack
[1:50] this load up hill he said no
[1:52] i got a packet but i looked at his hands
[1:56] so i knew that it was a vision he had
[1:58] scars in his hands
[2:00] so i fell down and i said lord are you
[2:03] packing the sins of the world and that
[2:04] cycle said no i'm just packing yours
[2:07] just getting you up the hill just so you
[2:09] can get up
[2:12] that's where it is if we just look
[2:14] around we find out he's packing ours

[31:58] house i won't be praying for her and
[32:01] brother ricky and the family there as
[32:02] they're going through this
[32:04] bless your brother shannon
[32:11] i'd like to just thank god
[32:14] for answering prayers and for all
[32:16] y'all's prayers for my cousin dwayne
[32:19] uh the other couple weeks ago when i
[32:20] brought that prayer request
[32:22] in he has a leukemia that is a
[32:26] very aggressive cancer the one that he's
[32:29] battling and
[32:30] the treatment that they gave him was
[32:31] just as aggressive and it's
[32:33] injured his kidney some but it damaged
[32:35] his heart greatly
[32:36] to where he couldn't get the stem cell
[32:38] transplant that he's needing
[32:41] and his heart got down to 30 percent and
[32:43] they wouldn't even consider it unless he
[32:44] could get his heart rate back up to 60.
[32:47] so they said he was going to need a uh
[32:50] pacemaker
[32:51] for his heart but he didn't even have a
[32:53] strong enough heart to take the
[32:54] procedure for that
[32:56] but with our prayers and ungodly answers
[32:58] he went just the other week and
[33:00] his heart has come up he's not gonna
[33:02] need no pacemaker
[33:03] any longer and i know that that's god
[33:05] that's done that and he
[33:06] he's not strengthening his heart for
[33:08] nothing if he's healing his heart he's
[33:10] going to heal his body as well
[33:12] and i believe that and i just like to
[33:13] thank you all for your prayers and thank
[33:22] god
[33:26] all throughout my history
[33:32] your faithfulness has walked beside me
[33:39] the winter storms made way for spring

[51:02] lord that is our true desire lord is to
[51:05] be
[51:06] in the place of revelation only with you
[51:09] lord
[51:10] lord not with our own ideas or mans
[51:13] the lord just to walk into the holies of
[51:17] holies
[51:19] lord and to catch a new glimpse of you
[51:23] or maybe in a way that we haven't seen
[51:25] that attribute before
[51:27] maybe that way we haven't seen your
[51:29] glory come down before
[51:32] lord we just want to be with you or we
[51:35] can't describe
[51:36] that feeling of being in the room and
[51:39] everyone else is standing around but
[51:42] you're standing right there
[51:45] you're ministering to our heart and
[51:47] you're delivering souls
[51:50] lord and without even saying a word
[51:53] you're right there you're right there
[51:56] father and you
[51:58] are speaking to our heart lord i believe
[52:01] that every person gathered here this
[52:03] evening lord
[52:04] their desire is to see you
[52:07] lord that you would open up the pages of
[52:09] the bible and you would start revealing
[52:11] yourself
[52:13] lord is the two brothers that were
[52:15] walking on the road to emmaus that day
[52:19] nor david it'd been so close
[52:22] but lord only when you did what you did
[52:25] before
[52:26] did they see that the one they'd been
[52:29] dealing with
[52:30] was jesus i pray that we would be very
[52:34] conscious here tonight
[52:36] hearing on the internet that jesus is
[52:39] closer than we think
[52:42] here to minister and here to touch i
[52:45] pray father
[52:47] as we yield our members to you tonight
[52:49] that you would take complete
[52:51] supreme control of this service i give
[52:54] myself
[52:54] over the kingdom of god
[52:58] jesus name
[53:02] amen god bless you this evening you have
[53:04] your bibles i'd like to look over in the
[53:06] book of john chapter 14
[53:08] verse 10.
[53:11] trust everyone had a good week and
[53:15] man praise the lord lord
[53:27] i'd like to continue thought
[53:31] lord woke me up with these words on
[53:34] finishing what was started
[53:36] finishing what was started here and we'd
[53:38] like to take
[53:40] take our thought from john chapter 14
[53:42] and verse 10
[53:44] and jesus jesus said believeth thou not
[53:47] that i am in the father
[53:49] and the father and me the words that i
[53:52] speak unto you i speak not of myself but
[53:54] the father that dwelleth in me
[53:57] he doeth the works the father that
[53:59] dwelleth in me
[54:00] he doeth the works believe me that i am
[54:03] in the father
[54:04] and the father in me or else believe me
[54:06] for the very work's sake
[54:08] verily verily i say unto you that he
[54:10] that believeth on me the works that i do
[54:12] shall he do also and greater works than
[54:15] these shall i do because i go
[54:17] unto my father and whatsoever you shall
[54:20] ask in my name
[54:21] that will i do that the father may be
[54:24] glorified in the son
[54:26] you shall ask anything in my name i will
[54:28] do it
[54:29] if you love me keep my commandments and
[54:31] i will pray
[54:32] the father and he shall give you another
[54:35] comforter
[54:36] that he may abide with you forever even
[54:39] the spirit of truth whom the world
[54:41] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[54:43] neither knoweth him but ye know him
[54:47] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[54:50] you
[54:51] amen god bless his word you may be
[54:53] seated tonight in the presence of the
[54:55] lord
[54:56] so we we're very familiar with this
[54:58] scripture as believers but we understand
[55:01] that
[55:01] jesus is saying that he would continue
[55:04] his same works
[55:06] through the believers and through the
[55:08] life of his believers
[55:10] and here we are standing in this day and
[55:13] the day of
[55:13] utter chaos and really if you it doesn't
[55:16] take much of a look around and even if
[55:18] you don't listen to the news or whether
[55:20] you're not
[55:20] very much attached to social media or
[55:22] whatsoever but it doesn't take much to
[55:24] figure out that we're in the last day
[55:26] and that we're in perilous times
[55:29] but even in the midst of of total
[55:31] darkness and total chaos
[55:33] god still has a light in this generation
[55:35] and and god is still doing miraculous
[55:38] things and that
[55:39] that god is still proving and
[55:41] manifesting himself like never before
[55:43] and
[55:43] we've seen him standing right here
[55:45] amongst us we've seen him stand here
[55:48] in the person of the holy ghost and
[55:50] manifesting himself more and more into
[55:52] his church body and
[55:54] coming into his church body and making
[55:56] himself known
[55:57] and that's the reason why these things
[55:59] are happening
[56:00] and you're drawing closer to the father
[56:02] as the father's drawing closer to you
[56:04] and
[56:05] it seems like like darkness is trying to
[56:07] press the light out but really
[56:09] light is pressing the darkness out and
[56:11] here we
[56:12] we see that that god has given us a
[56:15] great commission
[56:16] to stand here in this hour and to finish
[56:19] what was started now to to entrust
[56:22] somebody with
[56:23] with such a thing that jesus himself has
[56:26] he's getting ready to make his departure
[56:28] and
[56:28] we can look over in mark 16 and we can
[56:30] look over in the book of john as
[56:32] as jesus is getting ready for his
[56:34] departure
[56:35] that jesus entrusted his most trusted
[56:39] people
[56:39] he entrusted the disciples that that
[56:42] didn't have a didn't know how to write
[56:44] their own name
[56:45] they didn't know they didn't know much
[56:47] about the sanhedrin court they didn't
[56:48] know about
[56:49] they didn't know about scriptures but
[56:51] yet jesus
[56:52] entrusted the father's business to his
[56:56] closest friends
[56:57] on earth so here jesus is is entrusting
[57:00] these believers this
[57:02] this man called simon peter the man that
[57:05] was
[57:05] the man that was a real man and here he
[57:08] is entrusting men like
[57:09] like saul with with his with his gospel
[57:12] with this business to take this and
[57:14] and run with this and you see he's
[57:17] telling them now you don't have to build
[57:18] a new platform
[57:21] you're not going to have to start a new
[57:22] religion but you just simply take what
[57:25] i've taught you do
[57:26] what you've seen me do you just step
[57:29] right into the role of what i was doing
[57:31] and you step right on in and you watch
[57:34] as the invisible union takes place as
[57:36] as i come down and i surround you and
[57:39] envelope you with the presence of
[57:40] almighty god
[57:42] you'll see that christ is the mystery of
[57:44] god revealed
[57:45] you'll see that i'm united with the
[57:47] headship you'll understand
[57:49] that i i'm depositing something on the
[57:51] inside of you and
[57:53] it's something that when god goes to
[57:55] trusting you with something
[57:57] it's amazing when we trust god simply
[58:00] when you
[58:00] walk by faith but when god goes to
[58:02] trusting you
[58:05] to me that's a whole nother level of
[58:07] faith that god would
[58:08] god would entrust human beings that are
[58:11] so
[58:11] so flipsy and flopsy when they're it
[58:14] this way in that way but yet
[58:16] god entrusted human beings he ain't
[58:19] entrusting your
[58:20] five sentences he ain't entrusting your
[58:23] faith and he ain't entrusting your
[58:25] your senses of of of seeing and feeling
[58:28] and tasting
[58:29] he's entrusting that which is down on
[58:31] the inside of your soul
[58:33] he is entrusting that soul realm of
[58:35] faith
[58:37] he was not looking at thee he was not
[58:40] looking at simon peter
[58:42] he was not looking at andrew and mark
[58:44] and luke he was not looking at the human
[58:47] realm
[58:47] he was looking into a realm that that
[58:50] nobody else around him could see
[58:52] there was a lot of people that were
[58:54] walking with jesus that didn't
[58:55] understand
[58:56] where jesus was walking they didn't
[58:58] understand the realm that jesus was
[59:00] living in
[59:01] that jesus had the ability to walk into
[59:04] a realm
[59:05] and pull down certain things that that
[59:07] only god
[59:08] himself would know about and there god
[59:11] was able
[59:12] was able to show jesus as he's walking
[59:15] into these realms
[59:16] he's walking with human beings but jesus
[59:19] is walking in another world
[59:20] and he's pulling these things out
[59:22] pulling them out of this realm and bring
[59:24] them
[59:25] in into this realm and he's showing you
[59:27] that
[59:28] maybe there is a life that's filled with
[59:30] blackness
[59:32] maybe there's a life that's filled with
[59:34] all kinds of addictions and maybe
[59:36] there's a life that's filled with all
[59:37] types of
[59:38] all types of things that were unpure
[59:42] but he's able to reach into this realm
[59:44] and
[59:45] show that now the one you're living with
[59:47] that's not your husband and you've been
[59:49] with five
[59:50] and he's able to take that blackness out
[59:52] of that soul
[59:53] and take that life and put it over that
[59:56] soul
[59:56] and make it pure white you see he's able
[59:59] to grab something out of that realm
[1:00:01] and bring it into this realm so that you
[1:00:04] would realize
[1:00:05] that you're not walking with just
[1:00:07] another man
[1:00:08] there were people that walked with moses
[1:00:11] that realized that moses was still moses
[1:00:13] after he did
[1:00:14] certain things when they let his temper
[1:00:17] loose they realized that moses was still
[1:00:19] moses
[1:00:20] but when the closest people on earth
[1:00:22] were walking with jesus
[1:00:24] they were recognizing this is more than
[1:00:26] moses this is more than
[1:00:28] a prophet this is more than a man this
[1:00:30] is
[1:00:31] something special that's taken place i
[1:00:34] say unto you that there is something
[1:00:36] special that is happening here
[1:00:38] it's more than a man it's more than a
[1:00:40] church it's more
[1:00:42] than a story it's the son of man and
[1:00:44] he's walking right down this room
[1:00:47] he's walking through this place and he's
[1:00:49] going to bring something out of this
[1:00:51] realm
[1:00:52] into this realm and you'll watch as that
[1:00:54] light
[1:00:55] begins to spread and push back the
[1:00:57] darkness
[1:00:59] and god will say over it is good
[1:01:03] it's good you see here the spirit is
[1:01:07] working through the flesh just like it
[1:01:09] did in
[1:01:10] jesus it's now working in the flesh
[1:01:13] of humanity and the bible says in
[1:01:16] colossians 2 and 12
[1:01:18] that buried with him in baptism wherein
[1:01:21] you also risen with him
[1:01:23] through the faith of the operation of
[1:01:25] god who hath raised him
[1:01:28] from the dead so here we see that
[1:01:31] believers are quickened
[1:01:33] and changed and saved by the means of
[1:01:36] faith in the operation of god you see
[1:01:39] believing
[1:01:40] is something that you do but it's
[1:01:43] god's obligation to his promise to make
[1:01:47] sure that the promise
[1:01:48] comes to that faith that beliefs you see
[1:01:51] believing is the act of the soul
[1:01:54] so you could say that believing is what
[1:01:56] the soul does
[1:01:58] so when you look at something and it may
[1:02:00] look extraordinary or it may look
[1:02:02] extreme to the outside world
[1:02:04] you're just saying i'm doing what i was
[1:02:07] built to do
[1:02:09] there's some people that can't believe
[1:02:10] for healing but
[1:02:12] you as a believer just believe because
[1:02:14] that's what you do
[1:02:16] you you walk you you walk on water maybe
[1:02:19] it might be in a different
[1:02:20] maybe it be in a different form it might
[1:02:22] be walking on ice but yet you're walking
[1:02:24] on water
[1:02:25] because you believe and you might be
[1:02:28] able to walk on something that somebody
[1:02:30] else
[1:02:30] ain't able to walk to are you with me
[1:02:33] there's some people they can't walk on
[1:02:35] the promises
[1:02:36] of malachi 4. there's some people that
[1:02:38] can't walk onto revelations 10
[1:02:40] and 8 that they can't prophesy what has
[1:02:43] been spoken
[1:02:45] but you're able to walk into a realm and
[1:02:48] do what the soul was
[1:02:49] built to do so the the act of the soul
[1:02:54] believing is the act of the soul but the
[1:02:56] power to believe
[1:02:58] comes from god himself
[1:03:01] are you with me the power to believe
[1:03:04] comes from god almighty himself
[1:03:06] and the bible said in john chapter 1
[1:03:08] that he came into his own and his own
[1:03:10] received him not
[1:03:11] but to them but to them that believed on
[1:03:15] him
[1:03:16] to them gave he the power to be the sons
[1:03:19] of god
[1:03:20] even to them that believe on his name
[1:03:23] so the belief the power of believing
[1:03:26] comes from god
[1:03:30] there are some things that are hanging
[1:03:31] out there that are way too
[1:03:33] that are way too power for you to grab
[1:03:35] in your own human realm
[1:03:38] but what faith does faith is a substance
[1:03:42] of things hoped for the evidence of
[1:03:44] things not seen
[1:03:46] so there are things that are out there
[1:03:48] that are hanging and i
[1:03:49] and i'm just kind of putting it saying
[1:03:51] it that it's that it's out there
[1:03:53] there are things that are out there that
[1:03:55] you're not seeing
[1:03:56] there are things that are moving that
[1:03:58] you're not seeing
[1:03:59] but faith says it's going to happen
[1:04:02] faith looks into that realm it says i'm
[1:04:05] able to take that promise
[1:04:07] i'm able to receive that holy ghost i'm
[1:04:09] able to get this
[1:04:10] faith is reaching into a realm that you
[1:04:13] don't see
[1:04:14] and coming into the eternities and bring
[1:04:16] it into the naturality
[1:04:18] of life and humanity puts on divinity
[1:04:22] when it starts believing in the deity of
[1:04:25] jesus christ
[1:04:26] that that same deity that walked in
[1:04:29] jesus
[1:04:30] is walking in humanity and believing
[1:04:32] like jesus did
[1:04:33] and acting like jesus did and speaking
[1:04:36] like jesus did
[1:04:39] what is it when a believers start belief
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:42] they're doing what jesus did
[1:04:46] what did jesus do when he laid his hand
[1:04:48] on the leper he believed that he was god
[1:04:51] and when you lay your hand on the
[1:04:54] promises of god
[1:04:55] you're not believing as a humanity
[1:04:58] you're believing
[1:04:59] as a son of god and when you start
[1:05:03] acting like a son
[1:05:04] and believing like a son you'll stole
[1:05:07] hallelujah
[1:05:08] you'll start bringing things that are
[1:05:10] way too high for your humanity
[1:05:14] oh hallelujah there's no way you can
[1:05:16] live right in your humanity
[1:05:17] there's no way that you can talk right
[1:05:19] in your humanity there's no way that
[1:05:22] you can get into the spirit in your
[1:05:24] humanity
[1:05:25] but when you start believing
[1:05:28] there is something that comes over
[1:05:30] humanity
[1:05:33] that's for me that's for me
[1:05:37] and you start doing what jesus said do
[1:05:44] now when you look when the father starts
[1:05:47] entrusting the son
[1:05:50] he starts entrusting a son just
[1:05:53] like in a natural realm when a father
[1:05:55] starts watching a son how he's growing
[1:05:57] up
[1:05:58] how he's how he's matured in a way
[1:06:01] and then he starts entrusting him with
[1:06:04] things that only he would normally do
[1:06:07] but he starts entrusting the son with
[1:06:10] the family business
[1:06:12] and jesus said now he said you know
[1:06:14] where i would be yet
[1:06:16] you didn't expect me to be out in the
[1:06:18] world doing the things or
[1:06:19] building things like like joseph my
[1:06:22] protector
[1:06:24] but you expected me you you found me
[1:06:27] where i was built to be at here i am
[1:06:30] doing
[1:06:30] the father's business
[1:06:35] you can find me in the place of the
[1:06:37] father's business
[1:06:41] and here the father starts entrusting
[1:06:43] the son
[1:06:44] it's just like in galatians chapter 4
[1:06:47] when that
[1:06:48] that when it begins to talk about
[1:06:49] adoption and it talks about placing of
[1:06:52] sons
[1:06:53] that the son is no different than the
[1:06:55] servant even though he be lord of
[1:06:57] all but yet it comes to a time
[1:07:01] when the father is looking over him and
[1:07:03] that son
[1:07:04] is under governors and tutors until
[1:07:06] appointed time of the father
[1:07:09] and that tudor is taking that son and
[1:07:11] he's and he's leading that son and he's
[1:07:13] teaching
[1:07:14] he's teaching that son about the
[1:07:16] father's business
[1:07:17] he's telling him about the father's
[1:07:19] business that if
[1:07:21] if your father was here this is how your
[1:07:23] father would act
[1:07:24] if your father was here this is what he
[1:07:27] would say if your father was here
[1:07:29] he wouldn't he would move this way he
[1:07:31] would he would be moved with compassion
[1:07:33] if the father was here this is the way
[1:07:35] he would handle the business
[1:07:37] and the tutor is then instructing the
[1:07:40] son
[1:07:40] that this is the way it does this is the
[1:07:43] way the father does his business
[1:07:45] this is the way he handles his business
[1:07:48] relationships
[1:07:49] and the son starts stepping into the
[1:07:51] role of what the father would do
[1:07:54] and you're starting to see that god
[1:07:57] loved
[1:07:57] fatherhood so much so that he could
[1:08:00] produce
[1:08:01] himself a son
[1:08:04] oh hallelujah it's not just one son but
[1:08:08] many sons
[1:08:09] and now the father is entrusting his
[1:08:11] children
[1:08:12] with what he said do and that tutor
[1:08:15] he would go to the father and sometimes
[1:08:18] maybe he would go to the father
[1:08:20] and the tutor would ask him now how's my
[1:08:22] son doing and maybe one time he brings
[1:08:25] back a report well
[1:08:26] you know he you know he's showing some
[1:08:28] great characteristics
[1:08:30] but he's just not up to par yet he's not
[1:08:33] quite there
[1:08:34] and i'll just i'll keep i'll keep
[1:08:36] watching you
[1:08:37] i watch how you do business and i'll
[1:08:39] keep instructing the son how he does
[1:08:42] business and and i'll bring and i'll
[1:08:45] start
[1:08:45] messing your your great ideas
[1:08:48] and i'll start messing your great works
[1:08:52] into the sun and i'll start making these
[1:08:55] things happen
[1:08:56] i make i'll just start telling that this
[1:08:58] is the way it's done
[1:08:59] but it's not quite there yet just give
[1:09:01] me a little bit more time
[1:09:04] but i'd say that there is a time that
[1:09:06] the holy ghost could come back and say
[1:09:09] now they are your children they do they
[1:09:12] do just like you do
[1:09:14] they love just like the father loves
[1:09:16] they act just like the father loves
[1:09:18] they they move just like the father
[1:09:20] moose
[1:09:21] they're a chip off the old block
[1:09:24] i watched you one time the father i
[1:09:27] watched you
[1:09:28] how you moved and i watched how you
[1:09:30] handled this situation
[1:09:31] and then i watched that son you see the
[1:09:34] father is now identifying
[1:09:36] that the son has come into a spot and
[1:09:39] he's getting ready to place him
[1:09:41] he's getting ready to place him as a son
[1:09:44] and so the father takes his son
[1:09:46] that he's watched as he's come to
[1:09:48] maturity he takes his son
[1:09:50] and he takes him out and he makes a
[1:09:52] public testimony of him
[1:09:54] and he puts a special robe over his son
[1:09:57] and he shows
[1:09:58] to the entire public that this is my son
[1:10:02] he's got the same authority that i've
[1:10:04] got his name on the checkbook is just as
[1:10:07] good as mine
[1:10:09] hallelujah you see when you got the
[1:10:12] baptism of the holy ghost you didn't
[1:10:14] have to go through
[1:10:15] seven steps till you get till you got
[1:10:18] place
[1:10:19] when you received the baptism of the
[1:10:22] holy ghost
[1:10:22] you were adopted you were placed as a
[1:10:26] son
[1:10:26] and when you act like the father you're
[1:10:29] not acting like yourself
[1:10:31] you're acting as the father you're doing
[1:10:34] like the father would do
[1:10:35] and when you sign that check your name
[1:10:38] is as good as it
[1:10:40] as it is jesus on that check because you
[1:10:42] can't separate
[1:10:44] you and the father brother branham would
[1:10:47] tell us that you're as eternal
[1:10:49] as god is eternal so that means you
[1:10:52] can't do without god
[1:10:53] and god can't do without you
[1:10:56] he's tell no somebody to believe him
[1:10:59] tonight he's counting on somebody
[1:11:01] to take his promises
[1:11:05] jesus went to a realm that nobody was
[1:11:08] willing to go to
[1:11:09] when he walked into a tomb and there was
[1:11:12] a man by the name of legion
[1:11:13] he was walking where nobody else wanted
[1:11:16] to go
[1:11:17] but this was a different man than a
[1:11:19] bunch of security cats up there in the
[1:11:21] said henry court
[1:11:22] that didn't want nothing to do with this
[1:11:24] man but this was the right
[1:11:26] candidate for jesus
[1:11:29] jesus was looking at a man
[1:11:32] and he's would say my message will work
[1:11:34] on him
[1:11:37] the things i'm doing and the things i'm
[1:11:39] preaching and who i
[1:11:40] am they'll work on him i wonder if
[1:11:43] anybody can identify
[1:11:44] when jesus come walking to the tombs
[1:11:48] and he looked at you and he said my
[1:11:50] message will work on you
[1:11:52] you've been in jail you've been in
[1:11:53] prison you've been in sin
[1:11:55] my message will work on you
[1:11:59] my message will so work on you that i'm
[1:12:02] going to entrust you
[1:12:03] with the same power that i got
[1:12:09] oh hallelujah
[1:12:12] oh hallelujah
[1:12:16] hallelujah
[1:12:20] what good would it do what good would it
[1:12:23] do if i gave my life
[1:12:26] if i gave my life and you would say that
[1:12:30] you have the life of andrew spencer on
[1:12:32] the inside of you
[1:12:33] and you weren't doing the works of
[1:12:36] andrew spencer
[1:12:37] my life would be in vain is that right
[1:12:41] if i let me just bring us into a realm
[1:12:43] so that i can make it personable to
[1:12:45] young people
[1:12:45] if i would tell you that i had the life
[1:12:48] of
[1:12:49] of magic johnson or or michael jordan or
[1:12:52] lebron james on the inside of me
[1:12:54] you would expect me to do the works of
[1:12:57] these great basketball heroes of some
[1:12:59] people
[1:13:00] and if i don't go out there and i don't
[1:13:02] have the ability
[1:13:03] to reach up there and dunk a basketball
[1:13:06] and do an alley-oop and do all these
[1:13:08] things you would say well that guy's
[1:13:09] just a fraud
[1:13:10] he's not really doing what he don't have
[1:13:13] that life
[1:13:14] it's something missing there and when
[1:13:16] people
[1:13:17] say they got the holy ghost and when
[1:13:20] there is no life to back up what they're
[1:13:22] saying
[1:13:23] there's something missing there so if i
[1:13:26] tell you i got the life of shakespeare
[1:13:28] i'll do the works of shakespeare if i
[1:13:30] tell you i got the life of a great
[1:13:32] mechanic on the inside of me
[1:13:33] i can work on cars if i say i got the
[1:13:36] life of jesus
[1:13:37] on the inside of me you'll expect me to
[1:13:40] finish the works
[1:13:41] that jesus did
[1:13:46] hallelujah jesus is saying you've seen
[1:13:49] me at work
[1:13:51] now do what i've done he's entrusting
[1:13:56] not just human beings not just people of
[1:13:59] religion
[1:14:00] but it's in trusting sons
[1:14:05] i was thinking about this i was thinking
[1:14:08] about the
[1:14:09] these thoughts today as i was i was
[1:14:11] looking over these things and
[1:14:14] that god is entrusting that god is
[1:14:17] entrusting you to believe
[1:14:20] that this whole message has told us that
[1:14:23] god almighty
[1:14:25] is entrusting you with the same power as
[1:14:28] he had
[1:14:30] but on december the 22nd 2019
[1:14:33] there was a one that came from another
[1:14:35] realm and said
[1:14:37] that if you'll trust me i'll use you
[1:14:40] like you never before so you see
[1:14:44] it's a relationship of trust
[1:14:47] that god is entrusting you with this
[1:14:49] power but if you'll trust that power
[1:14:53] if you'll trust that power that's on the
[1:14:55] inside of you
[1:14:56] if you'll trust the power that that life
[1:14:58] that i gave at calvary
[1:15:00] if you'll trust the promises of god
[1:15:04] if you'll trust that i'm still the same
[1:15:06] yesterday today and forever
[1:15:08] if you trust that i'm bigger than cancer
[1:15:10] if you'll trust that i'm bigger than
[1:15:11] kovy
[1:15:12] if you'll trust me i'll use you like
[1:15:14] never before
[1:15:17] brother ron i know that was spoke
[1:15:19] directly to you but i want to say that
[1:15:21] we have watched
[1:15:23] we have watched this ministry as it's
[1:15:26] been
[1:15:26] trusting the almighty god and it's been
[1:15:29] used like never before
[1:15:31] it has walked us into another realm
[1:15:36] a realm of trust that only the father
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:44] you think about the miracles that's
[1:15:45] happened in the last year and a half
[1:15:48] you think about the the prodigals that
[1:15:49] have returned in the past year and a
[1:15:51] half
[1:15:52] you think about the life that's been
[1:15:53] changed in the last year and a half
[1:15:56] what caused that trust did he trusted
[1:15:59] you
[1:15:59] and you trusted him
[1:16:01] [Applause]
[1:16:04] oh hallelujah the cogs of prophecy
[1:16:07] are rolling right on time the oil of the
[1:16:11] holy spirit
[1:16:12] is on the wheels and everything's
[1:16:14] rolling
[1:16:18] hallelujah
[1:16:23] now watch what the prophet said
[1:16:27] when their eyes were open he said he
[1:16:29] said did you imagine the iq they
[1:16:31] required on the day of pentecost
[1:16:37] think about that just that segment did
[1:16:40] you
[1:16:40] imagine the iq that was required on the
[1:16:43] day of pentecost
[1:16:44] faith in god that's what they required
[1:16:49] right that's the requirement if thou
[1:16:51] believe us these signs shall follow them
[1:16:53] that believe jesus said
[1:16:55] he never said test them for their iq
[1:16:58] he said go into the whole world
[1:17:00] missionaries make disciples of all
[1:17:02] nations
[1:17:03] these sons shall follow them that
[1:17:04] believe that's the iq
[1:17:07] that's god's iq it's faith in god
[1:17:11] is all that god requires i'm so thankful
[1:17:14] that he didn't give us butcher hillbilly
[1:17:16] an iq test
[1:17:18] we couldn't hardly figure out our name
[1:17:19] in crayon when we was five years old
[1:17:22] much less when we get to be 30 something
[1:17:24] years old how to write it
[1:17:26] but thank god he didn't give us an
[1:17:28] intellectual test most of us wouldn't be
[1:17:30] sitting here tonight
[1:17:33] now i'm not trying to degrade your your
[1:17:36] intellects but i'm just simply saying
[1:17:39] if god would have trusted in your
[1:17:42] humanity
[1:17:43] you'd have never been setting here if
[1:17:46] god would have trusted in your intellect
[1:17:48] you'd never been setting here he didn't
[1:17:51] call the greater
[1:17:52] ideologies and the great einsteins of
[1:17:54] the day
[1:17:55] he called people that would believe
[1:17:59] he got people that were that were rugged
[1:18:02] believers
[1:18:03] that would stand square to toe to toe
[1:18:05] with the devil
[1:18:06] they'd say well hey i can't hardly spell
[1:18:08] my name but i believe that god said
[1:18:10] that i'm bigger than you
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:18] we're a body and the body works together
[1:18:23] it takes a team to build a house
[1:18:26] everybody loves seeing when the finisher
[1:18:30] comes in
[1:18:31] because they realize that the house is
[1:18:33] getting close
[1:18:35] i'm getting ready to move in i'm getting
[1:18:38] ready to make his home my home i'm
[1:18:40] getting ready to decorate the walls the
[1:18:41] way i want to decorate it
[1:18:43] there have been people all through this
[1:18:44] house that's been plastering the walls
[1:18:47] people painting it but when the finisher
[1:18:49] comes in
[1:18:50] and he's putting the final touches on
[1:18:53] on the house you know you're getting
[1:18:55] close to moving in
[1:18:58] everybody enjoys everybody enjoys the
[1:19:01] finisher
[1:19:02] but the man that laid the foundation had
[1:19:05] as much part in it
[1:19:06] as the man and the finisher is that
[1:19:08] right
[1:19:09] the man that the man that laid the block
[1:19:12] has as much a part in it
[1:19:14] as the man that puts the key in the door
[1:19:17] and makes sure it works and then comes
[1:19:19] the key hands the key to the owner of
[1:19:21] the house
[1:19:22] and said it's ready for you to move in
[1:19:24] [Applause]

[1:19:29] hour worker in this day
[1:19:31] and the same message that paul preached
[1:19:33] that started out there on the day of
[1:19:35] pentecost
[1:19:36] and it worked its way through seven h's
[1:19:38] down through the dark ages and it looked
[1:19:40] like it wasn't ever going to come
[1:19:42] through
[1:19:42] but the house was still getting built
[1:19:44] and then coming through the middle of
[1:19:46] luther and wesley but then there was a
[1:19:48] promise of an end time message
[1:19:51] that they would receive the same thing
[1:19:53] that paul received
[1:19:54] because they would receive the same
[1:19:56] thing that that paul
[1:19:58] that peter and james and john and all
[1:20:00] them believers they would receive
[1:20:04] may not have been working for maybe 20
[1:20:06] or 30 years
[1:20:07] but you got the same reward coming that
[1:20:10] paul
[1:20:10] that paul received that same holy ghost
[1:20:14] that paul received
[1:20:15] you got here we are preaching what paul
[1:20:19] preached
[1:20:19] and we're seeing the same works that was
[1:20:22] produced in paul's ministry
[1:20:23] being produced in the last day ministry

[1:20:41] looking over the banisters of time

[1:20:46] seeing the final touches
[1:20:47] being put on the house and they're
[1:20:50] looking at this house
[1:20:51] that everything's in order everything's
[1:20:54] in line

[1:23:26] did to zion and our
[1:23:28] king of the amorites and under the land
[1:23:30] of them whom he destroyed

[1:24:50] there's a beautiful there's a beautiful
[1:24:52] beautiful sermon on the power of a reach
[1:24:55] that when moses
[1:24:56] starts reaching into a realm and he
[1:24:58] brings back into the memory
[1:25:00] of the people of what god has done
[1:25:03] it's amazing thing when you go to
[1:25:05] reaching into that memory
[1:25:07] and you start pulling into that memory
[1:25:09] channel and you start
[1:25:10] showing it before your own eyes and your
[1:25:13] own eyes start
[1:25:14] seeing what god has done and moses
[1:25:16] starts telling them
[1:25:18] about one of the greatest victories that
[1:25:20] they ever had
[1:25:21] and he starts reminding them of what god
[1:25:23] did to zion and ock
[1:25:26] and he starts telling them that there
[1:25:28] there's going to be that same god
[1:25:31] that walked with you and showed his
[1:25:33] power over
[1:25:34] zion and og he's going to be with you
[1:25:36] when you walk into this land
[1:25:38] that i commissioned you to go in now
[1:25:41] there's going to be some people that
[1:25:42] won't walk with you
[1:25:43] but you're going to walk there because
[1:25:45] the lord's going to go before you
[1:25:48] i'm making a way for you and moses is
[1:25:51] telling them
[1:25:52] you can be of goods here you can walk
[1:25:55] into that land
[1:25:56] and know that it's yours the obstacles
[1:25:58] you see might be big
[1:26:00] but it's yours
[1:26:03] you're showing them the power of god
[1:26:05] wasn't changing
[1:26:08] and that what god could do and what he
[1:26:11] did
[1:26:12] he's able to do it all over again
[1:26:15] what you've seen in zion and og he's
[1:26:18] getting ready to
[1:26:19] finish it through you and if god
[1:26:22] commanded them if he commanded the
[1:26:24] israelites to tear down the canaanites
[1:26:26] surely he would give him enough power to
[1:26:28] do so he'd give them power in their
[1:26:30] hands
[1:26:31] hands of war he'd give him weaponry that
[1:26:34] that the enemy wouldn't know nothing
[1:26:36] about
[1:26:37] the enemy had tactics they've been
[1:26:39] warriors for great times the amalekites
[1:26:41] but yet there was a weaponry that the
[1:26:44] americans didn't know nothing about
[1:26:47] when it looked like the amla kites had
[1:26:49] the israelites surrounded
[1:26:51] then god rained down hailstones they
[1:26:53] said we know
[1:26:54] nothing of this weaponry where does this
[1:26:57] power come from
[1:26:58] and moses is telling them you can be of
[1:27:01] good courage
[1:27:02] i'm telling you you can be confident in
[1:27:05] my promise
[1:27:07] because the god that well that walked
[1:27:10] with me
[1:27:10] and told me to go down to the red sea
[1:27:13] that god's gonna walk with you
[1:27:16] joshua you walk right into your
[1:27:19] commission
[1:27:19] you go out there and you too you've seen
[1:27:22] me do what i've done
[1:27:23] now you walk out there and finish what
[1:27:26] was begun
[1:27:30] he's telling him under my commission
[1:27:34] you meditate on these things and you'll
[1:27:36] have good success
[1:27:38] you speak these things and you'll have
[1:27:39] good success if you'll be confident in
[1:27:42] my promise
[1:27:43] if you'll be confident in the god that
[1:27:44] we serve he will take down all of your
[1:27:47] giants
[1:27:50] you go out there it was my job
[1:27:54] to get us right here now it's your job
[1:27:59] to lay out the land it's your job
[1:28:03] what day are you living in we're living
[1:28:06] in the parallel
[1:28:07] of joshua in the day of ephesians that
[1:28:10] this is a parallel
[1:28:12] that all of the property of god is laid
[1:28:14] out before you
[1:28:15] and paul would stand there and say
[1:28:17] blessed are you
[1:28:20] blessed are you are you happy quickened
[1:28:23] and you hath he made alive and you did
[1:28:26] he predestinate
[1:28:27] you can walk all around these promises
[1:28:30] because they're yours
[1:28:34] you remember you remember one time i was
[1:28:36] having a great deal
[1:28:37] i was having a great deal of of pressure
[1:28:40] while i was preaching here
[1:28:41] you as full gospel lighthouse you
[1:28:42] watched it we were having a great deal
[1:28:45] of carnality pressure
[1:28:46] that was keeping the holy ghost from
[1:28:48] moving and i watched as that separating
[1:28:51] line
[1:28:51] as it separated the unbelievers from the
[1:28:54] believers
[1:28:55] and god took me over in a corner and
[1:28:57] said look
[1:28:58] where you're standing
[1:29:01] church where are you standing at you're
[1:29:04] not standing with lot
[1:29:06] you're standing with abraham look all
[1:29:10] around look at the east look at the west
[1:29:12] look up look back all of these things
[1:29:14] are yours
[1:29:19] these are yours these are yours
[1:29:24] what is that that you need that's yours
[1:29:28] what jesus said ask anything in my name
[1:29:32] and i will do it
[1:29:36] you remember the drama that the prophet
[1:29:37] would tell us about he said if you had
[1:29:39] that great
[1:29:40] if you had that great arcade that great
[1:29:41] department store you just climb up on
[1:29:44] the ladder if you need a little bit of
[1:29:45] joy
[1:29:45] just climb up there and get that joy
[1:29:50] if you needed something to break fear
[1:29:56] just climb up there and maybe you get
[1:29:58] one of them
[1:29:59] doohickeys it's got that reacher on it
[1:30:04] and you it looks like you ain't never
[1:30:06] going to get there to get it
[1:30:08] but you just reach up there and you take
[1:30:09] that little doohickey
[1:30:11] and you get that thing down
[1:30:14] see the enemy thought that he could take
[1:30:16] that he could take and stick those
[1:30:18] promises
[1:30:19] way so high up there
[1:30:24] what the enemy doesn't realize that
[1:30:26] we're not messing with a doohickey
[1:30:28] i don't even know what to do hickey is
[1:30:30] we're not messing with a doohickey
[1:30:32] we're messing we're dealing with an open
[1:30:35] word
[1:30:38] that's able to reach into that realm
[1:30:40] when maybe you ain't got enough faith to
[1:30:42] get up there
[1:30:43] but there's somebody that's standing
[1:30:46] there that's bigger than you
[1:30:47] are
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:30:50] oh hallelujah and all of a sudden the
[1:30:53] holy ghost
[1:30:53] maybe you can't reach it but maybe there
[1:30:56] comes a wind of the holy ghost
[1:30:58] and knocks a jar of joy over on top of
[1:31:00] you
[1:31:02] and all of a sudden joy gets all over
[1:31:04] you and you start
[1:31:05] dancing in the spirit and you start
[1:31:07] shouting in the spirit
[1:31:09] and you start speaking in unknown tones
[1:31:12] i say let the holy ghost come
[1:31:14] and knock all the promises over his
[1:31:16] children
[1:31:18] [Applause]

[1:31:24] doohickey tonight

[1:33:49] it joshua and caleb said we were built
[1:33:51] to be there
[1:33:54] when everybody else brought back a bad
[1:33:55] report about this holy ghost
[1:33:57] when everybody brought back a bad
[1:33:59] reporter how big
[1:34:01] cove it is it's a bad devil

[1:34:17] else was afraid to walk into that land
[1:34:19] there was two believers

[1:34:29] that covet was big
[1:34:32] help me preach they didn't deny that
[1:34:35] cancer was bad
[1:34:37] they didn't deny that laodicea was bad
[1:34:40] they
[1:34:40] simply said that god said that it was
[1:34:43] for us they didn't deny that there was
[1:34:48] giants in that land
[1:34:49] they just simply agreed with what god
[1:34:53] said and they said
[1:34:57] we're more than able to take it
[1:35:03] sure they had some giants when they went
[1:35:05] over there to jericho
[1:35:06] sure they had some big walls over there
[1:35:08] when they went over into that land
[1:35:10] but they said we don't know how he's
[1:35:12] gonna do it
[1:35:13] but power to believe has come from god
[1:35:17] i didn't make myself believe this i
[1:35:20] didn't make myself walk into this
[1:35:22] something on the inside is working on
[1:35:24] the outside
[1:35:26] and i started tearing down the
[1:35:27] amalekites and i started tearing down
[1:35:30] old dirty websites and parasites and all
[1:35:32] these things
[1:35:34] i started walking into what he said
[1:35:39] prophet said you're more than a match
[1:35:43] for the enemy
[1:35:46] we're more than a match for the enemy
[1:35:51] that mean you don't match up to the
[1:35:54] devil
[1:35:58] that mean that you don't size up to the
[1:36:00] devil
[1:36:01] it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean
[1:36:03] that you're
[1:36:04] as smart as the devil it means you're
[1:36:07] smarter than him
[1:36:09] it doesn't mean that you're equal to him
[1:36:11] it means you're bigger than him
[1:36:13] it means you're stronger than him it
[1:36:15] means you're wiser than him
[1:36:17] it means that you're able to do
[1:36:19] exceedingly abundantly above all that i
[1:36:21] could ever ask or think
[1:36:23] according to the power that works on the
[1:36:25] inside of me
[1:36:26] i'm more than a match for the enemy
[1:36:29] what is it it's the god on the inside
[1:36:31] that says i'm more than a match
[1:36:35] you got more diseases than you ever
[1:36:37] could imagine in this day
[1:36:40] you got more surgeries you got more you
[1:36:42] got more things more people going to the
[1:36:44] doctor
[1:36:45] than they ever have in this whole entire
[1:36:47] world
[1:36:49] but every single time that jesus come up
[1:36:52] to a case
[1:36:53] he was more than a match for it
[1:36:57] he was more than a match for brother
[1:36:59] madam said now there's a real devil out
[1:37:01] there
[1:37:02] and he said he's just as real as you are
[1:37:06] he said but if you'll start taking and
[1:37:09] you'll start believing
[1:37:10] he said you'll start recognizing that
[1:37:12] the god on the inside of you
[1:37:14] is greater and mightier than he is he
[1:37:17] said then by the grace of god
[1:37:19] you're more than a match for the devil
[1:37:22] oh hallelujah when you start recognizing
[1:37:25] that the almighty god
[1:37:27] that created the heavens and the
[1:37:29] universe and all the suns and the stars
[1:37:32] if you'll start realizing that that same
[1:37:35] power
[1:37:35] that raised christ jesus from the dead
[1:37:37] is alive in you
[1:37:40] it's gonna quicken your mortal bodies
[1:37:49] now to the scientific world they can't
[1:37:51] understand that
[1:37:53] how did that little little girl
[1:37:56] get that great power on the inside of
[1:37:59] her
[1:38:01] well we don't know if we can walk that
[1:38:02] way or not it's not for the unbelievers
[1:38:05] to walk this way
[1:38:07] it's for the believers and believers
[1:38:09] just walk right into it
[1:38:13] oh hallelujah just walk right into it
[1:38:17] just walk right into it it's an amazing
[1:38:20] thing
[1:38:21] when you can start letting yourself
[1:38:22] loose i was talking to some brothers and
[1:38:24] sisters this week
[1:38:25] i was talking to them it's amazing thing
[1:38:27] when you can go to start letting
[1:38:28] yourself
[1:38:29] loose to the promises of god what will
[1:38:31] happen
[1:38:32] it's something very special that'll take
[1:38:34] place when you guard start letting
[1:38:35] yourself
[1:38:36] loose to the promises of god and start
[1:38:38] letting yourself loose to worship
[1:38:40] you ever watch somebody when they're in
[1:38:42] the moment of worship
[1:38:44] that you realize that they're not just
[1:38:46] singing a song but they're worshiping
[1:38:50] they're worshiping they're worshiping a
[1:38:52] god that's able to go
[1:38:54] farther than what they're even imagining
[1:38:58] you ever watch that person now there's
[1:39:00] some people that can sing
[1:39:02] and man they can just really sing and
[1:39:05] it's
[1:39:06] it's like they got the most trained
[1:39:07] voice that you ever heard in all your
[1:39:09] life and you're thinking
[1:39:10] my goodness how did they get to that
[1:39:13] realm of singing they
[1:39:14] they reach to that they reach into those
[1:39:16] keys and they've got such
[1:39:18] range but they can't hold
[1:39:21] the anointing whatsoever there's not a
[1:39:24] leak of anointing on them
[1:39:26] they get up and sing beautifully and it
[1:39:28] rolls off of you
[1:39:29] like your water does on a duck's back
[1:39:32] same way it does with the person that
[1:39:34] does i'm not pointing out anybody here
[1:39:35] i'm just speaking
[1:39:37] but you watch and you can find somebody
[1:39:40] that
[1:39:40] man they can't hardly sing they're a
[1:39:42] little bit out of tune
[1:39:44] but they get into a realm of worship
[1:39:48] and they don't care who's around them
[1:39:51] they don't care who's watching them they
[1:39:54] don't care
[1:39:55] they don't care if their voice squeaks
[1:39:57] they don't care if the the piano is out
[1:39:59] a little bit
[1:40:00] but man they're in a realm and they
[1:40:02] start letting themselves loose to
[1:40:04] worship
[1:40:05] and they start praising god and all of a
[1:40:07] sudden they let themselves loose
[1:40:10] and all of a sudden heaven comes down on
[1:40:13] that human
[1:40:13] and all of a sudden god just starts
[1:40:15] blessing not just the singer
[1:40:18] but he starts blessing the audience what
[1:40:21] is it
[1:40:21] that person knows how to let themselves
[1:40:25] loose
[1:40:27] when they go into that realm they've
[1:40:29] been there before
[1:40:30] and they want to stay there
[1:40:34] there's a realm of worship when you get
[1:40:36] to letting yourself
[1:40:37] loose that all of a sudden it's no
[1:40:39] longer you and the piano but it's you
[1:40:42] and jesus
[1:40:42] and you're making love with jesus and
[1:40:45] jesus is talking back to you
[1:40:47] and cooing to your heart and he's saying
[1:40:49] something real special
[1:40:50] because you let yourself loose
[1:40:54] you ever watched how the children of god
[1:40:56] started letting themselves lose to the
[1:40:58] promises of god
[1:40:59] when they started sitting back and they
[1:41:01] said now
[1:41:02] i know there might not be some people
[1:41:04] that can reach into that realm and bring
[1:41:06] them promises down
[1:41:07] but i'm letting myself loose i'm letting
[1:41:09] my faith loose
[1:41:10] into that promise of prayer and i'm
[1:41:12] gonna bring it down here
[1:41:13] and mary reached into that realm of a
[1:41:16] promise that was 800 years old
[1:41:18] she let herself loose to the angel's
[1:41:20] words and the angel
[1:41:22] spoke the name jesus and mary gave birth
[1:41:26] because she let herself loose to what
[1:41:28] the angel said daniel let himself loose
[1:41:33] and lions couldn't get him david let a
[1:41:36] rock loose
[1:41:36] because he let himself loose to the
[1:41:38] anointing of god that was on horn
[1:41:41] and there was no goliath going to stand
[1:41:43] in his way
[1:41:46] because he started letting himself loose
[1:41:50] what would happen in this place if you
[1:41:53] start letting yourself loose
[1:41:58] help me preach right here i'm about to
[1:42:00] quit
[1:42:03] resurrection power just struck the
[1:42:05] audience
[1:42:07] but what would really happen when you
[1:42:09] don't get worried about the time
[1:42:12] when you don't get worried about oh my
[1:42:14] goodness
[1:42:15] they weren't wearing a mask when they
[1:42:17] walked yet how dare they
[1:42:19] walk in my presence
[1:42:24] you'd think that we've been to church
[1:42:26] enough
[1:42:27] that we could realize that this is the
[1:42:29] most holy place
[1:42:31] that we could be in
[1:42:35] it's not about well i was clapping and
[1:42:39] somebody they must have been new here
[1:42:42] they just got to
[1:42:43] clapping off beat and mess me up and i
[1:42:45] just couldn't praise him right
[1:42:47] let me tell you if you've got a problem
[1:42:49] with the beat and you can't clap
[1:42:51] yourself right because of somebody else
[1:42:53] sitting behind you
[1:42:54] you need to let yourself loose to some
[1:42:56] real worship
[1:42:58] because when you start letting yourself
[1:42:59] loose to real worship to real praise
[1:43:02] you won't care who's singing behind you
[1:43:04] you won't care who's singing in front of
[1:43:06] you
[1:43:06] you won't care you'll start letting
[1:43:09] yourself
[1:43:10] loose and god will start letting himself
[1:43:12] loose to you
[1:43:16] i've instructed people that's come here
[1:43:18] and asked me can i sing this song or
[1:43:20] can i do this song don't you i have
[1:43:22] instructed people don't you ever get up
[1:43:24] here and sing a song that don't mean
[1:43:25] something to you
[1:43:28] because if it don't mean something to
[1:43:29] you it won't mean nothing to me
[1:43:32] i've instructed young preachers around
[1:43:34] this message don't you ever get up
[1:43:36] and preach something that ain't real to
[1:43:38] you or doesn't mean something to you
[1:43:41] because if it don't mean something to
[1:43:42] you it won't mean nothing to nobody else
[1:43:47] but if you can ever get into a tune and
[1:43:49] god drops a song on your heart and you
[1:43:52] say hey
[1:43:53] i gotta do something for the lord and
[1:43:55] you start letting that worship loose
[1:44:00] you know what i'm talking about you know
[1:44:02] what i'm talking about some people just
[1:44:04] get up to sing that don't impress me
[1:44:05] whatsoever
[1:44:07] but when you get up and you start making
[1:44:10] love to jesus
[1:44:13] you walk into his presence prayerfully
[1:44:16] say god so all leaders gonna sing his
[1:44:21] song
[1:44:22] music's gonna be going this way
[1:44:25] and i'm letting myself loose you ain't
[1:44:28] gotta be up here to let yourself loose
[1:44:33] what would happen to the people that are
[1:44:35] sitting around you
[1:44:36] tonight if you start letting your faith
[1:44:39] loose into the promises of god
[1:44:42] the things that you prayed and it seems
[1:44:44] like and it's never going to happen
[1:44:47] what would happen if you start letting
[1:44:48] yourself loose
[1:44:52] would it be just like paul and silas
[1:44:56] when they started letting herself loose
[1:44:58] and they didn't look at their
[1:44:59] circumstances
[1:45:00] they didn't look what was around them
[1:45:02] but they was looking
[1:45:05] into a realm of praise and worship
[1:45:12] not only did it let paul and silas loose
[1:45:16] it let everybody around them loose
[1:45:20] what would happen what would happen in
[1:45:23] this place
[1:45:26] around this message around this around
[1:45:29] the internet now
