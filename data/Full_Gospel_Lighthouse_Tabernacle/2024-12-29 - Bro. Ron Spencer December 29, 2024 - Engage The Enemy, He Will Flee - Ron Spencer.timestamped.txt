[3:02] to say in the adoption series tell me my
[3:05] brother tell me my sister when was the
[3:09] time that the sons of God was ever to be
[3:11] manifested outside of this time
[3:15] now when was there ever a time in the
[3:18] history there's the Manifest a time to
[3:21] deliver all
[3:23] nature nature the nature itself is
[3:25] groaning waiting for the time of the
[3:27] manifestation
[3:29] while before the atonement was made
[3:31] before the Holy Ghost was ever poured
[3:33] out before all the all the Old Testament
[3:36] on down there there couldn't have been
[3:39] manifestations it had to wait till this
[3:41] time now all things has been brought
[3:45] coming shaping up to a headstone to the
[3:50] manifestations of sons of God coming
[3:54] back and the spirit of God coming into
[3:56] these men so perfect
[4:00] until their ministry will be so close
[4:03] like Christ till it'll John him and his
[4:06] church
[4:09] together what is that
[4:11] Ministry when a little bitty old girl
[4:14] that had alap that the ministry of Tim
[4:17] PR would stand there and say we are here
[4:20] to restore the glory of almighty God
[4:23] back to that little girl it was the
[4:26] manifestation of the king and the Queen
[4:30] coming together what was it when when
[4:37] when when Doug Hill was sitting here and
[4:40] he died in the service much like this
[4:43] all of a sudden the king's Ministry and
[4:45] the Queen's Ministry come together and
[4:48] it was a
[4:50] manifestation what was
[4:52] it when Connie ma was watching a stream
[4:56] and all of a sudden she felt so pulled
[4:58] when a man from Louisiana was preaching
[5:01] a message and she said I got to get in
[5:03] that building was that Aaron oglesby's
[5:06] Ministry or was that the king's
[5:10] Ministry come on
[5:13] somebody
[5:14] hallelujah
[5:16] hallelujah what was it what was it that
[5:19] turned my wife's womb when she couldn't
[5:22] have children but all of a sudden the
[5:24] king's Ministry come in line with the
[5:27] Queen's Ministry
[5:30] and we had a prayer
[5:32] line and during that prayer line sister
[5:35] Katie came in and you will probably meet
[5:37] her during this meeting brother Andrew's
[5:40] wife and she came through the prayer
[5:42] line and uh and they whisk me away and I
[5:46] was in the back and and I was still
[5:48] praying
[5:50] and and it came to me that sister Katie
[5:53] had a problem with her
[5:55] womb and Andrew came and he was
[5:58] attending with brother Michael
[6:00] and they were attending to me and and I
[6:04] told Andrew I said when we come home and
[6:06] the spirit of the Lord comes in a
[6:08] meeting I I'm going to call for Katie
[6:11] cuz now I know what's
[6:13] wrong and so sister Katie it was
[6:16] probably about two months later and I
[6:19] call for Andrew and Katie to come down
[6:23] during the service and I prayed for
[6:26] her and we spoke life to her
[6:30] wom and Miss Reagan is the product of
[6:42] that what was it when Dave Breeden was
[6:44] so wrecked up all of a sudden the king's
[6:47] Ministry and the Queen's Ministry tied
[6:50] together and you saw the physical
[6:53] manifestation of the
[6:55] king
[6:58] hallelujah how about every one of you
[7:00] that was backsliding on God you got Cod
[7:02] on God you done gave up on God but the
[7:05] king's
[7:08] Ministry but the king's Ministry started
[7:11] working through an eve that would not
[7:14] fail that would not give up you are
[7:17] predestinated to live out this
[7:26] hour brother M was with one of his
[7:30] managers by the name of Ern Baxter I've
[7:33] coming to this very special moment I
[7:36] don't want your expectations to come to
[7:38] a heighten now I'm coming to I'm coming
[7:40] to the climax just
[7:42] now ER bter is with brother
[7:47] Brandon and all of a sudden ER Baxter ER
[7:50] Baxter and William brand may see a man
[7:53] that's going down the street and er
[7:55] Baxter turns to William brandom he
[7:56] starts crying and weeping and throws his
[7:58] arm around William William brandom
[8:00] William brandom said what's all the fuss
[8:02] brother ER he said you see that's my
[8:06] king he said here where he was Ern baxer
[8:08] was a CA was a Canadian he said if a
[8:11] Canadian could act that kind of way
[8:13] could act that kind of way about a
[8:15] natural King how much more as Sons and
[8:18] Daughters of
[8:20] God come on somebody he was God for
[8:23] Mariah puit that was nobody that wasn't
[8:26] Tim puit that was a king who was it that
[8:29] raised Ron Spencer out of the hospital
[8:32] when he broke every vertebrae in his
[8:33] back that was my king who was it that
[8:37] raised him up out of fire that was my
[8:39] king who was it that gave me that gave
[8:43] me two little beautiful girls that's my
[8:46] king who was it that gave sister Whitney
[8:49] breeding her complete
[8:52] healing when she couldn't eat nothing
[8:55] she was on the strictest of diets where
[8:57] every time she would eat I'll just be
[8:59] very very plain with you when she would
[9:00] eat she would get sick to her stomach
[9:02] and lose everything she ate but all of a
[9:05] sudden the king came in a
[9:08] tent and he manifested his
[9:13] glory who was it that night and Doug
[9:15] heel got his healing it was not Ron
[9:17] Spencer it was a
[9:19] king who was it that restored you back
[9:21] to your rightful position when Satan
[9:24] tried to rob you and feed you all kinds
[9:26] of Filth it was my king
[9:30] now if Ern bter could act that kind of
[9:32] way about a natural

[31:48] you there was a time I thought that I
[31:53] could
[31:54] conquer
[31:56] anything I knew it
[31:58] all had nothing left to
[32:03] try and blindly to
[32:07] disaster my world kept spinning
[32:11] faster till felt the very soul of me
[32:16] would die but
[32:20] desperation brought me back to The Old
[32:25] Rugged Cross
[32:28] when my world had turned so black I
[32:32] couldn't
[32:36] see oh and like a frightened child lost
[32:42] in the
[32:43] night I search for
[32:45] life oh but in my
[32:50] desperation oh Jesus shined on me
[32:58] oh I'm a man who can walk again and be
[33:04] proud of who I
[33:07] have the sins I once held tight are now
[33:12] let
[33:13] [Music]
[33:15] go oh and all my days are filled with
[33:21] sunshine and not a cloud will ever
[33:24] darken my
[33:26] mind oh oh I tell you now it
[33:30] wasn't always
[33:34] so oh but
[33:37] desperation it brought me
[33:40] back to The
[33:42] Old Rugged
[33:45] Cross to my world had turned so black
[33:50] that I could not
[33:53] see oh had like a fr and child lost in
[34:00] the
[34:01] night I search for
[34:04] light oh but in my
[34:09] desperation Lord you shined on me I want
[34:14] to say something real briefly and that
[34:18] second verse
[34:19] again I hesitated this because I gave
[34:21] the short testimony the last time I
[34:24] visited brother Reagan's the song had
[34:27] fell on my heart heart I used to sing
[34:29] quite
[34:30] often and Satan kind of jumped on my
[34:32] shoulder and said you can't sing
[34:34] that all your days are filled with
[34:37] Sunshine not a cloud darken your mind
[34:40] the people know you some of them have
[34:42] read your your story and we know you cry
[34:47] but then on my mind on the way to
[34:49] Johnson City that day went to went to
[34:51] the sermons that I'd heard brother
[34:53] Reagan brother
[34:55] Ron that sun Beyond those clouds that
[34:57] predestination has settled in my heart
[35:00] from that airplane ride to so much
[35:02] that's just orchestrated as brother Ron
[35:05] said so I know in the devil's face I can
[35:07] sing that
[35:09] verse I'm a man who can walk again and
[35:14] be
[35:14] proud of who I
[35:17] am for the sins I once held tight I've
[35:22] now let
[35:26] go and all my days are filled with
[35:31] sunshine and not a cloud will ever
[35:34] darken my
[35:36] mind but I tell you
[35:38] now it
[35:40] wasn't always
[35:43] so oh the
[35:47] desperation it brought me back to The
[35:52] Old Rugged
[35:54] Cross when my word had turned so black
[35:59] that I could not
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] see and like a frightened child lost in
[36:10] the night I search for
[36:14] light oh and in my
[36:19] desperation I said in my
[36:23] desperation Lord in my desperation

[57:14] James CH 4: 7 and while you're turning
[57:17] there I just want to make this note this
[57:20] is not a flesh and blood affair right
[57:23] you're not fighting one another amen
[57:26] sometimes the enemy will try to get you
[57:28] to fight one another in your family on
[57:31] your job or in the church try to get you
[57:35] diverted to fight one another that's not
[57:37] what this is about amen come on oh man
[57:42] did you catch that this is not a flesh
[57:45] and blood Affair so I I don't want us to
[57:48] be carnal and think well he's preaching
[57:50] about somebody no no no no no come on
[57:54] this battle is with principality ities
[57:57] and power against spirits in the Realms
[58:00] of the
[58:02] spirits none of us and I I hope I can
[58:05] say this none of us would want our worst
[58:09] enemy if you have
[58:11] one to go to
[58:16] hell and if you do there's an
[58:20] altar I think about the worst en about
[58:23] what hell's about none of us would want
[58:25] our worst enemy to go there that's why
[58:28] we preach that's why we sing that's why
[58:30] we come together is we we want to get
[58:33] closer to God and this is the only place
[58:36] that you can get it done it isn't after
[58:38] you die that you get it fixed this is a
[58:41] spot that we get it fixed remember
[58:44] brother brandom says you go into that
[58:45] realm and You Begin to Fall and he said
[58:48] it's like falling for an
[58:51] eternity then he begins to tell us of
[58:54] how you're naked
[58:57] naked in Hell there's no friends there
[59:00] on it's a constant
[59:03] torment it's a nightmare that never
[59:08] ends amen listen folks I don't want to
[59:11] spend 10 minutes
[59:14] there I I don't I don't want to go there
[59:18] so we come to church and we want to get
[59:20] everything that we can look deep in our
[59:24] hearts make sure that everything in our
[59:26] life is right with God and so as we
[59:29] begin to go into a new year we realize
[59:32] that we're still in a battle and that
[59:35] battle will only get tougher and tougher
[59:37] and tougher the darkness will get darker
[59:39] and darker and darker but ye are the
[59:42] light of the
[59:45] world you are the light of the world
[59:49] Amen James chapter 4 and verse 7 submit
[59:54] yourselves therefore to God
[59:57] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:00:00] you I want us to read that again submit
[1:00:04] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:00:07] devil and he will flee from next verse
[1:00:11] let's read it together draw nigh to God
[1:00:14] and He will draw nigh to thee cleanse
[1:00:17] your hands you sinner purify your hearts
[1:00:21] ye double-minded may the Lord bless the
[1:00:24] reading of his word amen you can be
[1:00:29] seated Matthew 4 and verse 1 and then
[1:00:33] Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the
[1:00:36] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[1:00:39] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[1:00:42] nights he was afterward and
[1:00:45] hungered notice at his weakest moment
[1:00:49] that the tempter came
[1:00:53] right and when the tempter came came to
[1:00:56] him he
[1:00:57] said if thou be the Son of
[1:01:01] God command that these stones to be made
[1:01:05] bread but he answered and said it is
[1:01:08] written man shall not live by bread
[1:01:10] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:01:15] out of the mouth of God brother brandom
[1:01:18] said he didn't whip him by his power he
[1:01:21] whipped him by his word amen now the
[1:01:24] enemy will come to you you because
[1:01:26] you're Sons and Daughters of God and he
[1:01:29] wants your position and he may not he
[1:01:32] may not come to you quite like he did
[1:01:34] Jesus but he will say if you are a son
[1:01:37] of
[1:01:40] God if you are a daughter of
[1:01:46] God and then you can't whip him with
[1:01:50] power but you can whip him with the word

[1:03:34] little BB just a small place there and
[1:03:39] it was a little sign about like this and
[1:03:41] it said Peter cartright's grave
[1:03:45] site I said
[1:03:48] Matthew Peter cart right's buried
[1:03:51] here
[1:03:54] really so we went we followed the sign
[1:03:56] and we followed another sign and finally
[1:03:58] it said here's Peter cartright's
[1:04:02] grave there was a huge graveyard we
[1:04:05] drove up in and there was the grave site
[1:04:07] it was a I don't have the picture with
[1:04:09] me this morning but it was a huge huge
[1:04:13] uh Memorial to Peter cartright and his
[1:04:17] wife and for those that knows Peter
[1:04:20] cartright he was
[1:04:22] in he's the one that's mentioned in the
[1:04:24] greatest battle that was ever ever
[1:04:27] fought brother Rand appropriately
[1:04:29] mentions him and uh maybe you don't
[1:04:32] remember the story but brother brandom
[1:04:34] says that he went into a town and he was
[1:04:35] going to have a
[1:04:37] Revival and and the bully of the Town
[1:04:40] came in and says uh you you can't have a
[1:04:42] Revival here until you first whip me
[1:04:46] Peter carite was cleaning windows
[1:04:49] climbed off off the ladder took his
[1:04:51] jacket off rolled his sleeves up and he
[1:04:52] said I'll do that next then right come
[1:04:56] on and he whipped the man and they had a
[1:04:59] meeting that night and that night that
[1:05:00] man got
[1:05:01] saved and then that man became the
[1:05:04] pastor of the
[1:05:06] church Peter clar R was in a meeting and
[1:05:10] 30 different
[1:05:12] insurrectionist came into the meeting
[1:05:14] and and they were going to stir up the
[1:05:17] meeting just hundreds and hundreds of
[1:05:18] people were there and they were going to
[1:05:20] stop the meeting Peter cartright got
[1:05:22] right down in the middle and he whipped
[1:05:24] one at a time and he whipped 30
[1:05:27] different
[1:05:29] men that might have been quite a you
[1:05:31] know unusual Christian
[1:05:34] service on so they came back to Sunday
[1:05:38] service and Peter cartright he was there
[1:05:41] and and so anyway they asked him they
[1:05:44] said who's going to speak and he said I
[1:05:48] will well none of us feel speak after a
[1:05:51] meeting like we just had Wednesday night
[1:05:53] that was on a Wednesday night
[1:05:57] and he got up and he preached the Gates
[1:05:59] of Hell shall not
[1:06:01] Prevail and he preached he preached
[1:06:04] about a half an hour and when he let out
[1:06:07] the the worship went all day on Sunday
[1:06:10] all day on Monday all day on Tuesday and
[1:06:13] on Wednesday they baptized 300
[1:06:16] people that's quite a service isn't it
[1:06:20] now Peter car a is known to be such a
[1:06:23] powerful speaker but he is also in
[1:06:28] politics and this might be something of
[1:06:30] interest to you
[1:06:32] but he whipped the greatest president in
[1:06:35] the United
[1:06:38] States Abraham
[1:06:40] Lincoln they ran for congress
[1:06:43] together and Peter cartright won the
[1:06:46] race against Abraham Lincoln and then
[1:06:50] turned around and won it
[1:06:52] again so he was quite a fight
[1:06:56] in a whole lot of
[1:06:58] Realms I'm not going into
[1:07:02] politics but I think when when I look at
[1:07:05] him you can tell
[1:07:07] he I came home and I ordered the book I
[1:07:09] actually ordered the book before we got
[1:07:11] out of the
[1:07:16] graveyard and I would have read more of
[1:07:18] it but it's got such small writing I've
[1:07:20] got to take my time to make sure I get
[1:07:22] it I'm thinking about WR I'm thinking
[1:07:25] about ordering another one of the bigger
[1:07:29] letters but God's had fighters in every
[1:07:33] age brother brandham was quite a fighter
[1:07:36] right and in his realm he was a in the
[1:07:39] natural realm he was a boxer and he won
[1:07:42] 19 I
[1:07:44] believe professional
[1:07:46] fights and in that in that realm he was
[1:07:50] never
[1:07:51] whipped God Was preparing him for a
[1:07:54] different realm amen one that you didn't
[1:07:57] fight naturally against human flesh but
[1:08:01] you fought against principalities and
[1:08:03] powers in another dimension right you'll
[1:08:07] not win that war with your fist you'll
[1:08:10] not win that war with hateful words
[1:08:12] you'll win that war by the word of
[1:08:15] God in John chapter 14 and verse 12 said
[1:08:19] verely verely I say unto you he that
[1:08:21] believeth on me and the works that I do
[1:08:24] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:08:28] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:08:30] father notice these next words and
[1:08:33] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[1:08:36] I will I do and that the father may be
[1:08:40] glorified in the son notice these words
[1:08:43] if ye shall ask
[1:08:48] anything
[1:08:50] anything in my
[1:08:52] name I will do it
[1:08:56] amen Jesus prays this prayer after this
[1:09:00] manner therefore pray you our fathers
[1:09:02] Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 Our Father
[1:09:06] which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:09:09] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:09:11] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[1:09:13] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[1:09:16] debts as we forgive our debtors I I love
[1:09:19] this next verse and lead us not into
[1:09:23] temptation but Deliver Us from from Evil
[1:09:26] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:09:30] and the glory
[1:09:33] forever it's it doesn't have a time
[1:09:35] limit on it
[1:09:38] forever
[1:09:39] amen on Hallelujah the scripture says
[1:09:43] for with
[1:09:45] God
[1:09:48] nothing shall be
[1:09:50] impossible for with God nothing shall be
[1:09:57] impossible brother R makes this
[1:09:59] statement I think it's very powerful he
[1:10:01] says look what that day on Calvary did
[1:10:04] to
[1:10:05] you it paid your
[1:10:09] price it settled the
[1:10:12] question your sins be as Scarlet they
[1:10:17] shall be white as snow red like
[1:10:21] Crimson white like
[1:10:24] wool then you have no
[1:10:27] sin you are
[1:10:30] perfectly
[1:10:35] sinless Lord you are perfectly
[1:10:39] sinless and as long as you've accepted
[1:10:42] Jesus Christ as your
[1:10:44] savior your sins are
[1:10:48] forgiven anything that is Forgiven is
[1:10:52] remitted and forgot about thank thank
[1:10:55] you Lord amen I'm going to read that
[1:10:58] again because I think I've got a sleepy
[1:11:00] crowd
[1:11:02] come now I'm the one that's been sick
[1:11:05] all night come on I'm the one that's
[1:11:08] fought just so I could be in the pull
[1:11:11] pit and I'll be very honest with you if
[1:11:14] I could have called in sick today would
[1:11:16] have been my
[1:11:18] day are you with me now so I'm going to
[1:11:21] need a little help
[1:11:28] now look what that day on Calvary did to
[1:11:31] you it paid your
[1:11:35] price it settled the
[1:11:38] question your sins be a Scarlet they're
[1:11:42] white as snowl red like Crimson white
[1:11:46] like wool then you have no sin you are
[1:11:51] perfectly
[1:11:52] sinless no matter what you done or what
[1:11:56] you do you're still
[1:12:01] [Applause]
[1:12:10] sinless I I told Brother Alden because I
[1:12:13] had knew this quote was in front of
[1:12:15] me many of you with a
[1:12:18] history many of you were with a history
[1:12:22] wouldn't be accepted in some legalist
[1:12:24] Church
[1:12:29] but you happen to God lead you to a
[1:12:32] church that had a
[1:12:35] pastor that understood
[1:12:48] Grace as the preacher said do you know
[1:12:52] Grace who what Grace Gra the great
[1:12:56] amazing grace of
[1:12:59] God a God that can take our history and
[1:13:03] tear it up and wash it
[1:13:05] away I want you to think how powerful
[1:13:08] our God is he created the Sun the moon
[1:13:12] the
[1:13:13] stars he created an earth in such a
[1:13:16] design till every place has a certain
[1:13:19] Beauty to it the desert the mountains
[1:13:22] the the caves of the Earth
[1:13:25] the Seas he created it all with a
[1:13:28] certain Beauty with so much power he
[1:13:31] spoke it into existence let there
[1:13:36] be yet his grace and his blood is so
[1:13:40] powerful until he cannot remember your
[1:13:44] sins
[1:13:47] [Applause]
[1:13:58] that's powerful what I just
[1:14:00] said we're not Catholics where we beat
[1:14:03] oursel over the back over and over and
[1:14:05] over again right we're not that listen
[1:14:08] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:14:11] Amen to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:14:14] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:14:16] the spirit forget those things in the
[1:14:20] past move on
[1:14:23] [Applause]
[1:14:33] listen brother brandham would have been
[1:14:34] a
[1:14:36] murderer he would have been a murderer
[1:14:39] as good a shot as William brandham
[1:14:42] was he would have killed them boys with
[1:14:44] that rifle he'd have killed every one of
[1:14:48] them boys with that rifle that's right
[1:14:50] he would have been a murderer that's
[1:14:53] right brother brand
[1:14:55] hated
[1:14:59] women I'm quoting him hated women
[1:15:03] because of what he saw happen as his
[1:15:05] little bo as a little boy watching
[1:15:08] watching with that whiskey
[1:15:10] steel that's right he got deep complex
[1:15:13] but God let him overcome
[1:15:17] himself where that the message would be
[1:15:19] so powerful it would raise women to a
[1:15:22] higher level
[1:15:27] sisters this message liberated
[1:15:30] you and if I can say it properly women
[1:15:35] you are
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:44] loose God is our refuge and
[1:15:47] strength a very present help in in
[1:15:50] trouble therefore will not we fear
[1:15:53] though the Earth be moved and though the
[1:15:55] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:15:56] the sea though the waters therefore Roar
[1:16:00] and be troubled though the mountains
[1:16:02] shake with the swelling thereof sayah
[1:16:05] there is a river in the streams whereof
[1:16:07] shall make glad the city of God and the
[1:16:11] Holy place of the Tabernacles of the
[1:16:13] most high God is in the midst of her and
[1:16:17] Shall Not Be Moved God shall help her
[1:16:20] and right early and the Heathen raged
[1:16:23] and the kings were moved moved and he
[1:16:25] uttered his voice and the Earth melted
[1:16:28] the Lord of
[1:16:30] hosts is with us
[1:16:36] am let me just say you couldn't have
[1:16:39] anything better than to have God with
[1:16:46] you you could have the biggest
[1:16:48] Tabernacle in
[1:16:50] Virginia and the huge marble pillars and
[1:16:54] and all this statues that you could have
[1:16:57] but if God's not there I don't want to
[1:16:59] be
[1:17:00] [Applause]
[1:17:07] there you could have degrees all across
[1:17:10] your walls of how what all you have
[1:17:13] accomplished but if God's not
[1:17:16] there you could be the richest person in
[1:17:19] the United States of America but if you
[1:17:22] don't have God
[1:17:25] if you don't have God you don't have
[1:17:29] [Music]

[1:17:41] America that by their
[1:17:44] riches shape our
[1:17:47] politics and shape our economy one
[1:17:50] family but if they don't have God right
[1:17:55] if they don't have God they think
[1:17:57] they've got power you got no power in
[1:17:59] this life this life is temporary you're

[1:20:30] cancer nowhere nowhere I thought it
[1:20:33] might be greater gift to be able to help
[1:20:36] the people but God has used this trial

[1:22:12] give up on you
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:26] brother random said God is
[1:22:28] God and Satan is
[1:22:30] Satan and if you don't believe a there's
[1:22:33] a devil he said when I first got started
[1:22:36] I I run headlong into him every day
[1:22:39] don't tell me there's no devil because I
[1:22:41] know better I have to fight with him
[1:22:43] every day so I know that there is a
[1:22:46] devil and you must be trained when you
[1:22:48] go to meet him not trained in some kind
[1:22:51] psychology or trained in education or
[1:22:54] train he but be trained by the Holy
[1:22:58] Spirit God's power in the word to make
[1:23:01] it manifest know your
[1:23:07] enemy oh what a cruel thing he
[1:23:17] is I get called once a
[1:23:22] month I wouldn't go in here this morning
[1:23:24] but seems like I'm here I get called
[1:23:27] once a month to
[1:23:30] renew my
[1:23:32] chemo my chemo is about $30,000 a month
[1:23:37] now I could do it
[1:23:39] online but there's about a six day
[1:23:43] window to where that one medicine is
[1:23:46] paid for and then the other medicine is
[1:23:48] not paid
[1:23:50] for well I did that one time and they
[1:23:54] sent me a bill for
[1:23:57] $118,000 listen $188,000 in whatever
[1:24:00] world is is I I don't have
[1:24:04] that are you with me that's just a
[1:24:07] 30-day Supply actually it's a 22 day
[1:24:10] supply and
[1:24:12] so and so they call me and they'll ask
[1:24:15] me every month they've been doing this
[1:24:17] for about four and a half years and they
[1:24:20] say we need you to sign up on the online
[1:24:23] I said no
[1:24:25] no I did that one time and it cost me
[1:24:28] $188,000 and I told you I wasn't going
[1:24:30] to pay for
[1:24:34] it and they'll go we understand Mr
[1:24:38] Spencer so they take me through a lot of
[1:24:40] questions and asking me how I'm doing
[1:24:42] and all these different kind of things
[1:24:43] take about takes about 12
[1:24:46] minutes so we got done with the call
[1:24:49] yesterday or
[1:24:50] Friday and so anyway the lady was really
[1:24:53] nice and so she said Mr Spencer I need
[1:24:56] to tell you
[1:24:58] something I said
[1:25:00] okay you're the longest living
[1:25:05] patient on this kind of
[1:25:16] chemo to God be the glory
[1:25:29] somebody told me that if you take chemo
[1:25:31] it's not a
[1:25:33] miracle so I've just proved that
[1:25:38] wrong I want you to just think something
[1:25:40] I'm going to drop some principles here
[1:25:42] God's word is
[1:25:47] eternal God's
[1:25:49] word is eternal it doesn't have an
[1:25:52] expiration date to it your milk has an
[1:25:57] expiration date to it just drink it 30
[1:26:01] days after that expiration
[1:26:03] date and it been about 20 minutes you'll
[1:26:06] know that that milk was no
[1:26:10] good everybody on the same page with
[1:26:13] me this word is
[1:26:18] eternal this word is eternal I don't
[1:26:21] know if that means just don't let that
[1:26:23] go over your ears this word is eternal
[1:26:26] amen and if God said we're healed we're
[1:26:38] healed now I want you to understand the
[1:26:40] word of God is a
[1:26:43] weapon is a weapon in our
[1:26:47] Arsenal can you imagine going to a a
[1:26:51] fight and you've got a knife
[1:26:54] and the other God has got an
[1:26:58] M16 your chances are not going to be
[1:27:01] good right I want to remind Satan that's
[1:27:04] about how we
[1:27:06] stand he comes to us with his questions
[1:27:09] and he he comes to us with his ifs he
[1:27:12] comes to us with his reasoning power he
[1:27:15] comes to us with all of his doubts and
[1:27:17] we have an atomic Bond
[1:27:21] [Applause]
