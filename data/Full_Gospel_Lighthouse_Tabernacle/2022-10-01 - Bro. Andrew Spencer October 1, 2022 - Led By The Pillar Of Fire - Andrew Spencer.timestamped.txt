[35:07] I want to just make a few comments here
[35:10] this evening and a few reminders about
[35:13] tomorrow morning's service that after
[35:16] service will be having our baptismal
[35:19] Service A New Beginning service and and
[35:22] there's quite a few that have desired to
[35:25] be baptized and we just ask that if you
[35:28] desire to be baptized to to come with a
[35:32] repentant heart and you do your part and
[35:35] God will do his
[35:37] and uh if you desire to be baptized just
[35:42] a reminder to bring a change of clothes
[35:43] bring a towel and if you will be taking
[35:46] there will be brothers and sisters or
[35:49] sister Connie or sister Katie will be
[35:50] taken pictures but if you desire to have
[35:54] your own camera bring that the streaming
[35:57] will be cut off after the service while
[35:59] the baptismal service is going on
[36:02] and so if you if anybody would desire to
[36:06] change into their baptism close before
[36:08] you can do that at the back and then
[36:10] make your way make your way up this way
[36:13] and then we'll just bring you in an
[36:14] orderly fashion we were able to uh
[36:18] Sister Mary Vance Frazier had desired to
[36:22] be baptized and she had no idea
[36:25] that we were going to have this service
[36:28] or have a baptismal service but she had
[36:31] text sister Katie
[36:33] um
[36:34] that day or the day of and was asking if
[36:37] she could be baptized well remember we
[36:39] were taking communion and and she she
[36:41] didn't catch she didn't catch that part
[36:43] so God was working on both ends but
[36:46] because of her work schedule she
[36:47] wouldn't have been able to be here so we
[36:49] were able to baptize Sister Mary Frazier
[36:51] on the river this this past week and
[36:54] also brother Vijay Frazier and you know
[36:57] God's already
[36:58] these brothers and sisters have already
[37:00] got got it started and the angels in the
[37:03] waters and so we're just we're looking
[37:06] under the horn
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:10] when you see a pastor come under a
[37:14] burden like that you recognize that it's
[37:16] the Lord that is behind it and you see
[37:19] people's hearts that have been been
[37:21] sitting here for 30 and 40 years that
[37:24] that have come under a burden to just to

[42:00] if you have your Bibles this evening
[42:02] would like to look over in the Book of
[42:03] Genesis chapter 1 and to Exodus chapter
[42:06] 13 verse 21.
[42:28] I would like to speak to you this
[42:30] evening
[42:31] on led by the pillar of Fire
[42:35] led by the pillar of Fire
[42:37] Genesis chapter 1 and verse 1 in the
[42:40] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[42:42] Earth
[42:43] and the Earth was without form and void
[42:46] and darkness was upon the face of the
[42:48] deep and the spirit of God and moved
[42:50] upon the face of the waters and God said
[42:53] let there be light
[42:55] and there was light
[42:57] Exodus chapter 13 and verse 21.
[43:11] and say Amen when you have it this
[43:13] evening
[43:16] and the Lord went before them by day in
[43:18] a pillar of cloud to lead them in the
[43:22] way
[43:23] and by night in a pillar of fire to give
[43:26] them light to go by day and night
[43:29] and he took not away the pillar of cloud
[43:31] by day nor the pillar of Fire by night
[43:34] from before the people may God bless his
[43:37] word he may be exceeded in the presence
[43:39] of the Lord
[43:42] so said we'd like to speak to you this
[43:43] evening on lead by the pillar of Fire
[43:47] and brother Burnham said in the anointed
[43:49] ones at the end time he said I wasn't
[43:50] the one that appeared down there on the
[43:52] river he said I was only standing there
[43:54] when he appeared he said I'm not the one
[43:56] that performs these things and foretells
[43:58] these things that happens as perfect as
[44:00] they are I am only the one that's nearer
[44:02] when he does it I was only a voice that
[44:05] he used to say it it wasn't what I knew
[44:08] it's what I surrendered myself to
[44:11] that he spoke through it isn't me it
[44:14] wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[44:16] the manifestation of the son of man it
[44:19] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[44:22] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[44:24] it's God the angel was not the son of
[44:27] man he was the messenger from the son of
[44:30] man the son of man is Christ let's say
[44:33] that together the son of man is Christ
[44:35] he is the one that you're feeding on
[44:38] you're not feeding on a man
[44:40] you're not feeding on a man a man's
[44:44] words his words will fail but you're
[44:46] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[44:50] the son of man the son of man is Christ
[44:53] and you're feeding on the unfailing body
[44:55] word of the son of man and if you
[44:58] haven't fed fully if you haven't fed
[45:00] fully on every word to give yourself
[45:02] strength to fly above all of these
[45:05] denominations and things of the world
[45:07] will you at this time do it while we
[45:10] pray and we recognize that that the
[45:13] children of Israel after they've been
[45:14] after they've been drawn out of Egypt
[45:16] that God how that he'd come down through
[45:18] the miraculous works of the supernatural
[45:21] that we recognize that that Moses had a
[45:24] meeting up there but you you watch as as
[45:27] Moses comes back down he's got a vision
[45:30] he's got a vision that is before him
[45:32] that no matter what goes on and no
[45:34] matter what happens who the children of
[45:36] Israel along that path he knows that
[45:39] he's coming back to worship on that
[45:40] Mountain that no matter no matter what
[45:43] they come up against as far as
[45:45] opposition no matter what Pharaoh said
[45:47] about them no matter how long Pharaoh
[45:49] held them down there in Egypt no matter
[45:51] how many plagues that God had to show
[45:53] forth God God had given Moses a vision
[45:56] that he was going to go back to that
[45:59] mountain and he was going to Worship On
[46:01] That Mountain and you know as a children
[46:04] of the Living God that God has given you
[46:06] a promise that you are going to be able
[46:09] to worship Him in spirit and in truth
[46:12] and no matter how many men have tried to
[46:14] come in with intellectual ideas you know
[46:17] that the air is a powerful word that is
[46:20] given to the Church of the Living God
[46:22] that you are going to be worth be able
[46:24] to worship Him in spirit and in truth
[46:27] and no matter how many obstacles that
[46:29] had came against the Church of the
[46:31] Living God as they were moving out there
[46:33] in Israel when they were moving out
[46:35] there God that God had already give them
[46:37] a promise that he was going to be with
[46:39] them he was going to to guide them and
[46:42] he was going to lead them notice they
[46:44] were not under the leadership of Moses
[46:46] because if they were under the
[46:47] leadership of man man would have took
[46:49] him on a 10-day journey and he would
[46:51] have went on in to the promised land but
[46:54] God was doing some wondering he led the
[46:56] children of Israel allowed them to
[46:58] wander throughout there to get all of
[47:00] the excess cut off of them to get all
[47:02] the unbelievers out there and notice the
[47:05] True Church of the Living God was their
[47:07] Journey Through the Wilderness for 40
[47:09] years and they never had to go by
[47:11] Walmart they never had to go by a
[47:13] department store they never had to go by
[47:15] a hospital because God had given them a
[47:18] prescription that I am the Lord thy God
[47:21] that healeth all of thy diseases and if
[47:24] you fully obey my voice that all of the
[47:26] diseases that came upon the Egyptians
[47:28] shall not come upon you and you
[47:30] recognize that there was a God that was
[47:32] leading them to true worship he was
[47:35] leading them in the path that he'd
[47:37] already designed he had already set up a
[47:39] blueprint and Men He that God knew that
[47:41] men would criticize criticize his plan
[47:44] for taking them through the desert and
[47:46] taking them through here but God doesn't
[47:49] care what critics say about his plan he
[47:52] only cares about his church and he only
[47:54] cares about his word coming to fruition
[47:56] so I don't care what critics say about
[47:59] this message I don't care what ideas
[48:01] come up against us or what we're doing
[48:03] we are simply being led by the pillar of
[48:06] fire and I'm not going to argue with the
[48:08] one that made the plan I'm not going to
[48:10] argue with the one that is leading on
[48:12] leading us on the way I tell you this
[48:14] the children of Israel could go against
[48:16] everything there they that they come up
[48:19] against and they could go out there
[48:20] because Jehovah was leading them and
[48:23] that's why we can stand here as a bride
[48:25] of Jesus Christ with tenacity in our
[48:27] voice within a resilience in our heart
[48:29] and recognize that Jehovah is the same
[48:32] one and he's leading the Church of the
[48:34] Living God right into her destination
[48:36] I'll say this that the same one that led
[48:39] Moses is the same one that is leading me
[48:41] tonight that's leading us through these
[48:44] scriptures that's leading us through
[48:45] these healings that is leading us
[48:47] through these baptism that is leading us
[48:49] through the healings he's leading us
[48:51] through Miracles he's leading us through
[48:53] divine order and he'll be the same one
[48:55] that'll lead us right into a body change
[48:57] he ain't going to lead you off straight
[48:59] he ain't going to take you off course
[49:01] there's only one destination and the
[49:03] pillar of fire knows where you're going
[49:05] the purifier knows where to take you to
[49:07] he knows where to take in the scripture
[49:09] and give you courage he knows where to
[49:12] take you there and give you peace he
[49:13] knows where to take you and give you a
[49:15] strong a strong courage like never
[49:18] afford to believe that he's the same
[49:19] yesterday today
[49:22] and forever
[49:28] it wasn't Moses that was doing the
[49:30] leading it wasn't Moses that was given
[49:32] Miracles it was the angel of God what
[49:36] did it look like that that led Israel it
[49:38] was a pillar of Fire by night and it
[49:40] clouded by day and I believe that he
[49:42] should still the same one that is
[49:44] leading on tonight he's still the same
[49:46] Leading the People today as he was then
[49:49] and you recognize us as every one of us
[49:51] if you go through the sermon leadership
[49:53] that brother random would tell us that
[49:55] that from your very first step you had
[49:57] to have somebody that would lead you you
[49:59] had to have a strong hand that would
[50:00] help you up in your in your baby's steps
[50:03] and that same one that same one that led
[50:06] you that led you through through your
[50:08] toddler stage or through through this
[50:10] stage or that stage was the one that
[50:11] that led you as a parent he was your
[50:13] parent that was leading you he he was
[50:16] there the mother was there to lead you
[50:18] to lead you and show you things that
[50:21] were wrong as a child or how to how to
[50:23] not get in trouble or how not to fall in
[50:25] a hole or how to get there it was a man
[50:27] or a woman that was is leading you that
[50:30] was going to make sure that you got out
[50:32] of trouble he was somebody with a loving
[50:34] heart that kept there kept their
[50:36] protecting hand upon you as a child to
[50:40] make sure that if you if you got a fever
[50:42] in the night there was somebody that
[50:44] stayed up with you and and prayed with
[50:45] you that that cradled you that hugged
[50:48] you and and was there it was somebody
[50:49] that was watching out for you and to
[50:52] think that that as parents we we don't
[50:54] want to let our children sometimes get
[50:56] out of our quarter or get out of our
[50:58] sight because we want to be the one that
[51:00] protects them we want to be the one that
[51:02] we have sometimes parents that have a
[51:04] hard time letting go of their children
[51:06] but the same one that that got them here
[51:08] will be the same one that will protect
[51:10] them all the days of their life and I
[51:13] think it's amazing thing tonight to
[51:15] recognize that that the church the Bride
[51:18] of Jesus Christ is not under the
[51:20] leadership of a man that could fail her
[51:22] that could that could falter and get off
[51:24] the word but the church is under she is
[51:27] under the influence of the Almighty
[51:29] Angel we're not under the influence of a
[51:31] theologian we're not under the influence
[51:33] of a of an intellectual child but we are
[51:36] followers of Elohim I'm the omniscient
[51:39] one that knows our battles before we
[51:41] ever get in them he is El Shady high he
[51:44] is the god that is Almighty he is he is
[51:48] the all-powerful one and he knows he
[51:51] knows how much power it takes for you to
[51:53] get out and lay on us here I'll say this
[51:55] that this powerful one that is leading
[51:58] us the almighty is powerful enough to
[52:01] take you through laodicea and not lose
[52:03] you he's strong enough to take you
[52:05] through every one of your battles and
[52:07] your troubles won't overtake you he can
[52:09] take you through the fire and the Fire
[52:11] won't burn you he can take you to the
[52:13] floods and they won't overtake you you
[52:15] see he is the one that is leading Us in
[52:17] the battle and that's why he said take
[52:19] myself upon you put on the whole armor
[52:22] of God I'll say this that the one that
[52:24] is leading us into battle he ain't never
[52:27] lost one battle he's not one loss lost
[52:29] one case his record is complete and his
[52:33] record is perfect he's perfect in
[52:35] getting prodigals he's perfect in
[52:37] performing Miracles he's perfect in
[52:39] producing healing he's perfect
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:43] he's perfect he's perfect in giving an
[52:46] answer when no man can answer you he's
[52:48] perfect
[52:51] he's the one that's leading you
[52:53] it's been said that an army of sheep
[52:55] that's led by a lion will always defeat
[52:58] an army of lions led by a sheep so it
[53:01] matters who you're being led by and the
[53:04] church is being led by none other than
[53:06] the lion of the tribe of Judah I want
[53:09] you to know the only thing that scares a
[53:11] lion in the natural is another lion and
[53:14] I know that the Bible tells us that the
[53:16] devil's like a roaring lion seeking whom
[53:18] he made of our but the only one that can
[53:21] scare him is our great Jehovah and
[53:23] William Branham told us that you are kin
[53:26] to the lion of the tribe of Judah you
[53:29] have a sterness you have a firmness and
[53:31] you have a bravery and if he stood up as
[53:34] a lion of tribal Judah he is standing up
[53:37] and showing that I am your God I am I
[53:40] have enough bravery about myself when
[53:42] others won't stand up when others won't
[53:44] take the fence for you I am your defense
[53:47] I am your offense I am I am the god that
[53:51] heals you
[53:53] let me tell you the one that stood up
[53:56] for you is not a weak God it wasn't some
[53:59] wimpy line that ain't fed that ain't fed
[54:01] in nearly half a century he's been
[54:04] feeding he's been preparing and he knows
[54:06] what it takes to get you through I'll
[54:09] say this it did it pays to who your it
[54:12] matters who you're being led by
[54:15] it matters who you're being led by
[54:17] because the Bible tells us in Proverbs
[54:19] 28 and 8 28 and 1 that the wicked flee
[54:22] when no man pursue with him but the
[54:24] righteous are as bold as a lion it
[54:27] matters who you're being led by the one
[54:30] that we are being led by he ain't never
[54:32] ran for cover he's never hid and he's
[54:35] never went into Retreat the pillar of
[54:37] fire is still moving in the church
[54:40] he's not backing off of his promises
[54:43] he's not scared of cancer he's not
[54:45] scared of covet he's not scared of germs
[54:48] he's not scared of anxiety he's not
[54:51] scared of depression you can't scare the
[54:53] line of the tribe of Judah off of his
[54:56] promises and if we're kin to the line of
[54:58] tribe of Judah you'll not scare me off
[55:01] of God's promises
[55:02] [Applause]
[55:04] if he promised me healing I'm gonna get
[55:06] healing if he promised me Deliverance
[55:08] I'm going to get Deliverance if he
[55:10] promised me a holy ghost I'm going to
[55:12] get the Holy Ghost
[55:14] foreign
[55:21] Moses could take them right up to the
[55:23] ridge see
[55:25] no wonder Moses could put them right in
[55:27] the face of pharaoh
[55:28] because Jehovah was the one leading
[55:34] we know
[55:36] that the angel that led Moses was the
[55:38] angel of the Covenant
[55:39] which was Christ the son of God or the
[55:42] logos that came out of God which was the
[55:44] son of God and God delivered the
[55:46] children of Israel when they were in
[55:48] bondage and couldn't help themselves
[55:50] he said today God's people are not in
[55:52] bondage I want you to listen to gay
[55:55] God's people today God's people are not
[55:57] in bonded spiritually for they're
[55:59] delivered by the power of the Holy
[56:00] Spirit
[56:03] and if you're sitting here and you
[56:05] recognize you're a child of God and the
[56:08] enemy is telling you that you're still
[56:09] in bondage I have just read to you that
[56:12] your God has already set you free and
[56:15] you are not in bondage it's simply
[56:17] somebody that knows that the key has
[56:20] been took out of the door that is trying
[56:22] to make you think that you can't walk
[56:23] out of the prison house but the same
[56:26] Pillar of Fire that led Peter out of the
[56:28] prison house that led Paul out of the
[56:30] prison house he knows how to create an
[56:32] earthquake in this place to let you
[56:35] recognize that their doors already open
[56:37] and all you've got to do is walk out of
[56:39] the door of cancer walk out of the snare
[56:41] of the Fowler walk out of it because
[56:43] there's an angel that is encamped about
[56:45] the church
[56:47] today God's people are not in bondage
[56:50] spiritually for they are delivered by
[56:52] the power of the Holy Spirit and no man
[56:56] has to stay in bondage of sin any longer
[56:59] because the Holy Spirit brings him from
[57:01] the bondage of sin
[57:10] here was this one
[57:13] in the very beginning
[57:16] brother random said let's go back a
[57:17] million
[57:18] a million years
[57:20] and he said let's just take you out over
[57:22] the banister of time and he said allow
[57:25] you to look through the lattice
[57:27] and see this great light
[57:30] but in the beginning
[57:32] God was there
[57:35] in the beginning there was darkness that
[57:36] covered the Deep
[57:38] but in the beginning God said let there
[57:41] be
[57:43] he said now we watch as a logos of God
[57:46] goes out
[57:48] it goes out from the bosom of the father
[57:50] he said it is the word of God he he said
[57:53] it is our Lord Jesus Christ he said it's
[57:56] like a little child playing before the
[57:59] door he said that logos went out he said
[58:02] that is our Lord Jesus Christ he said
[58:05] now God is not a former in a body form
[58:07] he said because God is a spirit and they
[58:10] that worship Him must worship Him in
[58:13] spirit and in truth he said so when out
[58:16] God God went out out of God went a
[58:18] little Mystic light a little Halo that
[58:21] was back there in the very beginning he
[58:23] said it was God up there he said now who
[58:26] is that same one that is in the midst
[58:29] today he said it's none other than that
[58:32] same light that was back there he said
[58:35] when God began to speak he said let
[58:38] there be light he said and then nothing
[58:41] happened he said and all of a sudden and
[58:43] Adam rolled over
[58:45] because the one that had the authority
[58:48] to speak to the darkness wrote an atom
[58:51] over he wrote an atom over and it come
[58:53] into creation because the one that was
[58:56] there in the beginning held the
[58:57] authority to be able to speak to the
[58:59] darkness I'll say this there is a man
[59:02] that is can turn on the light right here
[59:04] and it may not look like anything's
[59:07] happening for you and you watch let him
[59:09] speak he's still got the same Authority
[59:11] he's still got the same power he's still
[59:14] got the same anointing and he could
[59:16] speak let there be light over darkness
[59:18] and you watch you watch what he did back
[59:22] there he created a world and out when a
[59:25] son and he created the Earth and the
[59:28] Earth was without form and it was void
[59:31] and brother banham said he said that
[59:33] Earth was dripping wet with all the
[59:36] water he said so he sent the son to go
[59:39] around that Earth to dry off all of the
[59:43] excess water that shouldn't be there
[59:45] I'll tell you as a church let me let me
[59:49] let the preacher out just for a minute
[59:51] that same sun is circling your Earth
[59:54] he's drying off the excess problems and
[59:57] saying you're not going to have to deal
[59:59] with this much longer I am letting the
[1:00:01] son Circle you and tell you that you're
[1:00:04] mine you were in me before the world was
[1:00:07] formed before I created the sun you were
[1:00:09] there before I created molecules you
[1:00:12] were there before there was an atom that
[1:00:14] rolled over and created light you was
[1:00:17] already there little bride
[1:00:19] and the lamb was slain before the
[1:00:22] foundation of the world
[1:00:27] God
[1:00:29] let meteors
[1:00:30] let Stars little clinkers roll off of
[1:00:33] his fingertips
[1:00:34] and let them roll for a half a million
[1:00:36] years and he'd stop them right there
[1:00:38] where they were
[1:00:42] what is he doing he's writing his first
[1:00:44] Bible in the heavens
[1:00:47] brother random said that God was writing
[1:00:49] his first Bible in the heavens so that
[1:00:51] man could look up and see that's where
[1:00:54] Jehovah lived at
[1:00:57] foreign
[1:00:58] you may not be able to see it tonight
[1:01:00] because of the clouds and things of the
[1:01:02] storm rolling through but they're still
[1:01:03] there
[1:01:06] they're still there whether you see the
[1:01:08] sun shining or not he's still there
[1:01:11] whether you feel his anointing he's
[1:01:14] still there whether you feel his healing
[1:01:16] power he's still there the god that
[1:01:18] wrote the Bible has never backed off one
[1:01:21] of his promises he's never backed off
[1:01:23] one thing and he's controlling your
[1:01:26] Earth
[1:01:27] yeah
[1:01:28] and he said let us make man in our image
[1:01:32] what did he do he said he said he needed
[1:01:35] somebody
[1:01:36] to lead the animal life
[1:01:40] he said that was man
[1:01:42] not to the trinitarian to think well
[1:01:43] God's having a conversation with
[1:01:45] somebody here
[1:01:46] let us make man in our image let's
[1:01:49] settle the debate when God created man
[1:01:52] how many did he create let us make man
[1:01:55] in our image God is one so man out of
[1:01:58] man came one
[1:02:00] and to think that God allowed this man
[1:02:03] over in Genesis chapter 2 and 7 that he
[1:02:06] created man Out of the Dust of the earth
[1:02:08] and he breathed into him the very Breath
[1:02:11] of Life he breathed into him and he came
[1:02:14] out of the Dust to the Earth and he
[1:02:16] began to lead these animals and he began
[1:02:18] to name those animals and you watch the
[1:02:20] faith of Adam at work
[1:02:22] that what the father had asked him to do
[1:02:25] here Adam is working as the father is
[1:02:28] leading him name the tiger Shiva name
[1:02:32] the lion this way name the dove this
[1:02:34] wave name the horse this way because of
[1:02:36] his power and because of his nature
[1:02:39] watch his faith in action and now God
[1:02:42] said or he said now he said let's watch
[1:02:45] what God is doing he's using man to lead
[1:02:48] nature
[1:02:49] Hey sir but now the Church of the Living
[1:02:52] God is to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:02:55] now watch as man in the first Adam as
[1:02:59] he's there and he's controlling nature
[1:03:01] because he'd watch the one back there in
[1:03:03] the beginning and with the authority of
[1:03:05] the word speak to creation and it come
[1:03:07] to fruition exactly like he spoke it now
[1:03:10] the first Adam comes into existence and
[1:03:13] he begins to speak to creation and
[1:03:15] Creations got to listen to its master
[1:03:20] come into existence and there he is and
[1:03:23] he's making creation obey its Master
[1:03:26] brother random told us that faith is the
[1:03:29] master of every circumstance so every
[1:03:32] circumstance that you could come up
[1:03:33] against every problem that you can come
[1:03:35] up against you are taking the same
[1:03:37] Authority that Adam took back there in
[1:03:40] the beginning and controlling nature you
[1:03:42] by your faith Hallelujah are being led
[1:03:45] by a spirit to control the things in
[1:03:48] your life
[1:03:51] thank you
[1:03:54] we got Satan a little bit nervous
[1:03:55] tonight
[1:03:59] we're in a good spot then
[1:04:02] we're in a good spot
[1:04:04] so he tells us brother man tells us and
[1:04:07] who is God powerful message in 1950 he
[1:04:09] said he said who is God the one that
[1:04:11] stood there and rolled the Stars off of
[1:04:13] his hands and wrote the worlds out of
[1:04:15] his hand and made the things which do
[1:04:16] not appear deity
[1:04:19] deity himself lives in man the Creator
[1:04:21] that made heavens and earth lives in
[1:04:23] mankind he said why no wonder cripples
[1:04:26] when you realize that can straighten out
[1:04:28] the Creator's here no wonder blind and
[1:04:31] they can't see opens their eyes the
[1:04:33] creators here the Creator realize if you
[1:04:36] could just realize who we are that the
[1:04:38] Bible says that we are the sons and
[1:04:41] daughters of God we are his offspring
[1:04:44] and when God has heard Jesus is heaven
[1:04:47] he's having a conversation with
[1:04:49] Nicodemus when Nicodemus said I know
[1:04:52] that thou thou master or come from God
[1:04:54] can no man can do these Miracles unless
[1:04:56] God teach him I need Jesus speaks these
[1:05:00] words
[1:05:01] pretty profound
[1:05:03] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:05:07] the kingdom of God
[1:05:08] so a man that has never been birthed
[1:05:11] never had a born-again experience cannot
[1:05:13] understand what you're talking about
[1:05:15] tonight there's a lot of people that are
[1:05:17] sitting here or maybe listen on the
[1:05:19] internet that'll sit here and they'll
[1:05:22] have a clue what's being said to them is
[1:05:24] because they've never been birthed under
[1:05:26] this message
[1:05:27] but you watch when somebody grabs a hold
[1:05:30] of it gets a new birth and you watch
[1:05:32] them as God places them in the Kingdom
[1:05:34] as a fully adopted son and daughter of
[1:05:37] God you are always his son you never did
[1:05:40] becomes you didn't become some because
[1:05:42] you see the seed was already in you and
[1:05:45] because you were see
[1:05:47] you could be reporting the reason why
[1:05:50] you understand what I'm giving out
[1:05:52] tonight is because you've already been
[1:05:54] here
[1:05:55] you've already said here that Gene seal
[1:05:58] of God already knows what I'm preaching
[1:06:01] to you is the absolute truth
[1:06:03] [Applause]
[1:06:14] we recognize
[1:06:16] that God built us
[1:06:18] foreign
[1:06:20] with Body Spirit and soul but he gave us
[1:06:24] five contacts to contact this Natural
[1:06:27] Earth
[1:06:30] the ability to see is an amazing thing
[1:06:34] the ability to smell is an amazing thing
[1:06:37] if you had covet you recognize how
[1:06:40] precious that smell was
[1:06:43] hadn't that taste
[1:06:45] don't act like you didn't get it
[1:06:50] it can't be allergies all the time
[1:06:59] but anybody
[1:07:01] if you have you ever tried telling
[1:07:03] somebody have you dealt with a blind
[1:07:04] person
[1:07:07] that doesn't see
[1:07:10] I was with
[1:07:11] I was out of place
[1:07:14] and there was a father that was blind
[1:07:17] and it was he was standing at a place
[1:07:19] where a parade was going by and his
[1:07:22] daughter was out in front of him and he
[1:07:23] couldn't see
[1:07:25] but as his father the Man's father was
[1:07:27] standing there and he was describing
[1:07:29] everything that was going on
[1:07:32] and he just turned around and said is my
[1:07:34] daughter having a good time
[1:07:36] he couldn't see what was going on
[1:07:40] so to understand the power of sense to
[1:07:43] be able to contact is an amazing thing
[1:07:45] and brother random told us that God gave
[1:07:47] us these five senses to contact our
[1:07:50] Earthly home he said if you'd ever watch
[1:07:53] a man that would that would go and he
[1:07:55] would say I simply refuse to say that
[1:07:58] the sun shines and he would close his
[1:08:01] eyes he'd close his eyes and go live in
[1:08:03] the basement the rest of his life and
[1:08:05] say the sun doesn't exist you'd say
[1:08:07] there's something wrong with that man
[1:08:10] but somebody that really is blind they
[1:08:13] long they long to see
[1:08:18] that the woman I believe it Helen Keller
[1:08:21] is that the right name
[1:08:23] when she when she walked into Israel and
[1:08:27] she went into the Tomb of Jesus she went
[1:08:30] in there and somebody led her there her
[1:08:32] lady that would lead her into these
[1:08:34] places there was a man that was a was an
[1:08:37] author of Great books and he happened to
[1:08:38] be there at the same time that Helen
[1:08:40] Keller walked into the Tomb of Jesus
[1:08:42] completely blind and she walked out of
[1:08:45] the Tomb of Jesus and said I can find no
[1:08:47] darkness in here at all
[1:08:50] if a blind woman could walk into the
[1:08:52] Tomb of Jesus what about the Church of
[1:08:55] the Living God that walks in where the
[1:08:57] resurrection's at you are aware of the
[1:08:59] lightest hat you are where the message
[1:09:01] is half you're not in blindness no
[1:09:03] wonder John said you are not the
[1:09:06] children of Darkness but you are the
[1:09:08] children of the lights
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:11] I can find no darkness in this message I
[1:09:14] can find no darkness in this truth
[1:09:16] there's simply light all around us
[1:09:20] you've got a contact on the inside of
[1:09:23] your spirit and it's the baptism of the
[1:09:25] Holy Ghost and you're recognizing this
[1:09:28] is the anointing this is the truth
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:34] and people that say it ain't true it's
[1:09:36] because they've never believed in it and
[1:09:38] they can't contact it so why would you
[1:09:40] let somebody that's walked in blindness
[1:09:43] of this truth all of your life why would
[1:09:46] you let them sit there and tell you it
[1:09:48] ain't right when you've already come in
[1:09:50] acquaintance with the one that is the
[1:09:52] truth
[1:09:54] I've contacted the one that set my soul
[1:09:56] free
[1:10:03] I don't understand a whole lot about
[1:10:05] electricity I just know you don't want
[1:10:07] to touch it with a screwdriver
[1:10:10] but if one of them wires got knit
[1:10:12] it's Pro there's a ground that's off
[1:10:15] somewhere
[1:10:16] it's a ground that's off somewhere
[1:10:18] there's something that's that's knocked
[1:10:19] it off and brother I heard I heard
[1:10:21] brother man I'm saying on the way to
[1:10:23] church
[1:10:24] um God's provided place of worship he
[1:10:26] saw what the problem is his people have
[1:10:29] grounded Jesus Christ from getting off
[1:10:33] I'm not going to sit back and ground
[1:10:34] Jesus Christ from Lifting me up I'm not
[1:10:37] going to ground this airplane I'm not
[1:10:39] going to ground what God's got set for
[1:10:41] this I'm not going to ground anybody
[1:10:43] foreign
[1:10:45] but I ain't gonna go there right now I'm
[1:10:48] not going to ground any of my children
[1:10:49] right here I'm going to tell you if you
[1:10:51] want to be re-baptized tomorrow you get
[1:10:53] re-baptized if you want a fresh
[1:10:55] anointing you get your fresh anointing
[1:10:58] there's not one Minister that's here
[1:10:59] tonight that's going to ground you and
[1:11:02] gonna stick you in some corner
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:16] notice he said that if you've got the
[1:11:18] holy spirit in you then you're a
[1:11:20] candidate for association with the
[1:11:22] Unseen World and the supernatural
[1:11:25] with you
[1:11:26] you're a candidate for the Unseen
[1:11:29] if you've got the Holy Spirit In You
[1:11:31] I'll say that anything that you desire
[1:11:34] in Christ as long as it's in the word
[1:11:36] it'll come to it'll come to pass in your
[1:11:38] life if you can bring anything through
[1:11:40] the filter of God's word and brother
[1:11:42] Branham told us in the thinking man's
[1:11:44] filter the only thing that can pass
[1:11:46] through the word is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:49] the only thing that can pass through
[1:11:51] there is a holy ghost your ideas won't
[1:11:53] pass through there your carnality won't
[1:11:55] pass through there your troubles won't
[1:11:57] pass through there so why don't your
[1:11:58] troubles tell why don't you tell your
[1:12:00] troubles this is your stop to get off
[1:12:02] I'm going the rest the way through
[1:12:04] through the word and you got to get off
[1:12:06] you can't pass through the word troubles
[1:12:09] you can't pass through there little
[1:12:10] ideas and little complexes and little
[1:12:13] stigmas won't pass through the word why
[1:12:15] don't you let the Holy Ghost lead you
[1:12:17] right through the word
[1:12:19] he's here he ain't got a sticker of your
[1:12:22] problems the rest of your life the son
[1:12:24] of man is here
[1:12:27] the son of man is here to make sure you
[1:12:29] make it to get every promise that's
[1:12:31] yours
[1:12:32] you're right in the Third Exodus and
[1:12:35] brother Branham told us it he told us
[1:12:37] that the Third Exodus is when the son of
[1:12:39] man the purifier goes in there and gets
[1:12:42] the bride out of the church
[1:12:45] where'd you come from Brother Jill it
[1:12:47] was a Third Exodus showing who you are
[1:12:50] you should have never been here
[1:12:53] you should have never been here but
[1:12:55] because of purifier went by your way
[1:13:01] should have never been here brother
[1:13:03] Meadows but because her Pillar of Fire
[1:13:05] said you're not going to commit suicide
[1:13:11] cancer could have killed you a long time
[1:13:13] ago if it wanted to but the pillar of
[1:13:15] fire is here
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:22] Hallelujah
[1:13:25] Christopher
[1:13:33] so what world are you contacting
[1:13:36] what world are you contacting
[1:13:41] where's your spirit being led
[1:13:43] where's your heart being led
[1:13:48] we recognize
[1:13:50] at the pillar fire is the Angel of the
[1:13:51] Covenant
[1:13:52] and God's got angels
[1:13:55] sitting by his side waiting for them to
[1:13:58] carry out the message
[1:13:59] that's what an angel is he's to carry
[1:14:02] out a message he's an intermediate
[1:14:04] between man and God and you watch when
[1:14:07] Daniel was down there and he's down
[1:14:10] there in Babylon and he's praying he's
[1:14:12] praying and he's praying and he's
[1:14:15] praying for 21 days he's praying
[1:14:18] for 21 days he's praying but when the
[1:14:21] angel came to Daniel he said Daniel Thou
[1:14:24] Art beloved you can go read it and find
[1:14:26] out if I'm telling you the truth in
[1:14:27] Daniel chapter 10. he said Daniel Thou
[1:14:31] Art beloved
[1:14:33] he said I couldn't get to you because a
[1:14:36] prince of the power of Persia had
[1:14:39] withheld me for 21 days but then Michael
[1:14:43] stood up
[1:14:44] and you may have prayed and you may have
[1:14:47] felt like you're about giving up I'm
[1:14:48] telling you don't you give up on your
[1:14:50] prayers Michael is standing up the lamb
[1:14:53] stood up for you the mighty Angel stood
[1:14:55] up for you
[1:14:57] and you watched the words that have
[1:14:59] spoken today and you'll buy buy the
[1:15:02] angel
[1:15:03] Daniel I heard you the first time you
[1:15:07] cried
[1:15:09] and I the angel am come for thou art
[1:15:16] I am come for thy words
[1:15:20] when it doesn't look like I am coming
[1:15:22] I'm coming for thy words when it doesn't
[1:15:25] look like it's on the way I'm coming
[1:15:27] because of thy words when it doesn't
[1:15:29] look like man's gonna do man's gonna do
[1:15:32] its part I am come for thy words little
[1:15:35] brother I have come for thy words the
[1:15:38] angel is here the anointing is here the
[1:15:42] pillar of fire that'll take you in a
[1:15:44] body change is here I am come for thy
[1:15:47] words I want to commission you don't you
[1:15:50] give up
[1:15:51] don't you back off your prayer life
[1:15:53] don't you back up on asking
[1:15:57] don't give up
[1:16:04] you contacted a world
[1:16:07] because of the Holy Ghost you have an
[1:16:08] association with the Unseen
[1:16:11] and brother bear told us and how can I
[1:16:13] overcome he said there's a major
[1:16:14] difference between the pillar of salt
[1:16:16] and the pillar of Fire
[1:16:18] he said it depends on which way you turn
[1:16:22] which way are you turning tonight have
[1:16:24] you turned your eyes towards on them
[1:16:26] have you turned your eyes back there to
[1:16:28] your loved ones thinking oh my and
[1:16:31] you're hearing their cries it matters
[1:16:33] where your eyes are
[1:16:36] I have chosen the path of the pillar of
[1:16:40] Fire
[1:16:46] now the Bible
[1:16:47] tells us in Exodus 23 and 20.
[1:16:52] that behold I send an angel before thee
[1:16:54] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[1:16:56] thee in the place which I have prepared
[1:16:58] beware of him and obey his voice and
[1:17:02] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[1:17:04] your transgressions for my name is in
[1:17:06] him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his
[1:17:08] voice and do all that I speak then I
[1:17:11] will be an enemy unto thine enemies and
[1:17:14] an adversary under thine adversaries and
[1:17:16] brother random said now let's take a
[1:17:18] look at what this Angel looked like in
[1:17:20] Exodus 23 and 20 that I'll send an angel
[1:17:22] before you he said roll over to Exodus
[1:17:25] 13 and 21 and the Lord went before them
[1:17:29] by day in a pillar of cloud and to lead
[1:17:31] them in the way and by night in purifier
[1:17:33] to give them light to go by the night
[1:17:35] that's what the angel looks like
[1:17:39] the one that is leading you through the
[1:17:42] word that is your god is the pillar of
[1:17:45] fire he is the Angel of the Covenant
[1:17:48] and when the angel of the Covenant begin
[1:17:51] to pull the children of Israel out of
[1:17:54] Egypt they were no longer called the
[1:17:57] people of God they were the people of
[1:17:59] God until they were called out of Egypt
[1:18:01] and then they became the Church of God
[1:18:04] and the same angel that was leading the
[1:18:06] church then is the same Angel that's
[1:18:09] leading the church now
[1:18:12] foreign
[1:18:15] Moses is up there
[1:18:17] and he's having a conversation with a
[1:18:19] bush
[1:18:22] a pill or fire was exactly what Moses
[1:18:26] was lacking
[1:18:29] and Moses had that fire
[1:18:33] and the fire was in Moses
[1:18:36] and the fire performed the signs because
[1:18:39] the pillar of fire left the bush
[1:18:41] come on Moses
[1:18:47] that's your prophet
[1:18:49] and the absolute
[1:18:53] the pillar of fire left the bush and
[1:18:55] come on Moses
[1:18:56] but notice
[1:18:59] the pillar of fire couldn't live in
[1:19:00] Moses
[1:19:02] he could come and anoint his flesh
[1:19:05] and he could go because there was no
[1:19:07] perfect Lamb slain for him yet
[1:19:09] the anoint him would come and go on
[1:19:11] David
[1:19:12] the anointed would come and go on Isaiah
[1:19:15] the anointer would come and go on
[1:19:17] Ezekiel because there was no perfect
[1:19:19] Bloodshed yet but when the Redeemer
[1:19:22] Christ came that Blood Washed what Moses
[1:19:26] couldn't have the pillar of fire he
[1:19:28] couldn't have it living on the inside of
[1:19:30] his soul but he loaned for the day that
[1:19:32] you're living in
[1:19:34] as he could not he couldn't take away
[1:19:36] his ride he couldn't take away his
[1:19:38] temper it couldn't take away his lust
[1:19:40] because there was no perfect Redeemer
[1:19:42] yet but when Christ the perfect lamb
[1:19:45] stood up for you it takes away your lust
[1:19:48] it takes away your temper it takes away
[1:19:51] your pride and he leads you by the power
[1:19:54] of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:56] it's the glory of the Lord
[1:20:00] that's the one that set the atmosphere
[1:20:02] that's the one that's come week in after
[1:20:04] weekend
[1:20:08] he watches he begins to move over a
[1:20:10] congregation like this
[1:20:13] most of you would have never acted the
[1:20:16] way that you act or would have never got
[1:20:18] out of your comfort zone if it wasn't
[1:20:19] for the glory of the Lord that's come
[1:20:21] over you
[1:20:22] you hear it on tape nice brother random
[1:20:24] said no no how do you watch you watch
[1:20:26] the face of this woman just she sees as
[1:20:29] she's nearing as the pillar fire is
[1:20:31] nearing her what is it the glory of the
[1:20:33] Lord is coming over her and it's
[1:20:35] changing her countenance it's amazing
[1:20:38] thing when you when you're standing
[1:20:39] there and you've got a revelation from
[1:20:41] the Lord and somebody's asking a
[1:20:44] question about the Bible and they have
[1:20:46] no clue what it is but they've come with
[1:20:48] a sincere heart and they're asking now
[1:20:51] what does baptism mean or what is the
[1:20:53] Holy Ghost what is exactly it is and you
[1:20:55] begin to take them through the
[1:20:56] scriptures and Revelation strikes their
[1:20:59] heart you watch the countenance that
[1:21:02] comes upon that person and makes them a
[1:21:04] solid believer it's the glory of the
[1:21:07] Lord It's not the teaching of man that's
[1:21:09] doing it it's the glory that is
[1:21:11] revealing himself to the people and you
[1:21:14] watch when the spirit of God begins to
[1:21:17] move out there and cast The Spirit of
[1:21:20] the devil out you watch your countenance
[1:21:22] come over that person it's because that
[1:21:24] demon recognizes he's getting ready to
[1:21:27] be exposed he said now Satan hates
[1:21:30] Revelation but you and I love revelation
[1:21:34] it's the reason why you're standing here
[1:21:36] bold as a lion you've got a revelation
[1:21:39] that God cannot leave you here
[1:21:46] let me tell you as an astronaut you know
[1:21:49] where you're going
[1:21:51] you know you're getting ready to break
[1:21:52] past the sound barrier you're getting
[1:21:54] ready to leave this Dimension and as the
[1:21:57] Bride of Jesus Christ you are in an
[1:21:59] astronaut age and you've got rapturing
[1:22:02] fuel on the inside of your soul and you
[1:22:05] can't stay here
[1:22:08] I only got one destination and the one
[1:22:11] that is controlling me that is
[1:22:14] controlling the tube it's not me he
[1:22:17] knows where to push the button and he
[1:22:19] knows the time all I got to do is get in
[1:22:25] foreign
[1:22:35] I ain't been able to find my seat for
[1:22:39] the past for the past month I've had to
[1:22:41] set somewhere else every single time I
[1:22:43] come in here
[1:22:47] and you think you just simply found your
[1:22:49] spot
[1:22:55] I know how Humanity works
[1:22:59] but let me quote a prophet there was an
[1:23:01] angel that was standing by the aisle
[1:23:03] that led you to your pew
[1:23:06] let me roll you over into the spiritual
[1:23:09] just now don't get trouble when you
[1:23:11] can't find her see the Angels got your
[1:23:13] seat already picked out
[1:23:16] come on somebody come on somebody
[1:23:18] there's an Angel that's already went
[1:23:20] before you and he's prepared away for
[1:23:23] you all I can say is I want to find my
[1:23:25] seed and I want to get ready I'll tell
[1:23:28] you Church of the Living God don't even

[1:23:47] you by the way
[1:23:52] Satan can't even bind these services
[1:23:54] without somebody letting him control
[1:23:57] them but we are not led by the devil we
[1:24:01] have been led by the Holy Ghost so we
[1:24:03] say God have your Liberty lead us
[1:24:06] through the word lead us to our promise
[1:24:09] lead us to our body change

[1:25:09] what made the match
[1:25:13] the story
[1:25:15] it's a perfect love story
[1:25:18] that no author can write
[1:25:25] but the one that holds a pin
[1:25:27] is here
[1:25:30] and there's not one man going to put a
[1:25:32] period behind your life
[1:25:35] there's not one body there's not one
[1:25:37] person that's going to come behind your
[1:25:39] love story and said it's over
[1:25:41] until the one that holds a pin
[1:25:49] the one that's holding the PIN
[1:25:51] said I have loved you when no man loves
[1:25:54] chewing I have loved you when others
[1:25:56] gave up on you
[1:25:58] but your story is not over
[1:26:00] I hold the pen in my hand
[1:26:05] there's nobody gonna put a period on it
[1:26:08] until I take you through the Rapture and

[1:26:20] here

[1:26:48] touches God's anointed
[1:26:51] you recognize Who You Are
[1:26:54] God's anointed
[1:26:57] it's a dangerous thing when a man
[1:26:59] touches a man of God but you as the body
[1:27:03] of Jesus Christ are his Messiahs
[1:27:06] and curse should be the man that touches
[1:27:09] God's anointed
[1:27:11] curse it be Satan and the day he touched
[1:27:13] your life curse it be the day covet came
[1:27:16] by your way cursed me the day the
[1:27:18] depression came by your way curse it be
[1:27:21] the day that said and it wouldn't come
[1:27:23] by your way God ain't put a period to
