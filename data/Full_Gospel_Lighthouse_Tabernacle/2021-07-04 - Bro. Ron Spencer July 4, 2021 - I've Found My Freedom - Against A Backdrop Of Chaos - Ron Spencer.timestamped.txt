[53:05] i want to remind you and i apologize for
[53:06] taking this time and
[53:08] even in both realms but i i want to say
[53:10] this to you when jesus was
[53:12] walking with jarius and
[53:15] his daughter he's at his last end to
[53:17] come to get jesus
[53:19] and he's willing to do whatever to get
[53:21] jesus to his house
[53:23] jesus told him to fear not and he looked
[53:26] at him and said fear not
[53:28] and even when they came to tell him that
[53:30] your daughter has died
[53:32] it didn't change the story with jesus
[53:37] it didn't change the story last year
[53:40] when i spoke
[53:42] we must get to jesus and then the
[53:44] following week we went to louisiana
[53:47] sister karen was in a brain bleed
[53:49] situation there
[53:51] we're in a much more dire situation even
[53:53] now

[53:58] he says absolutely the same so i would
[54:01] like for you if you would if you would
[54:02] join with me in prayer this morning
[54:05] and i want us to pray and i want you to
[54:07] pray from your position

[57:19] and verse 32
[57:24] then jesus to those jews which believed
[57:28] on him
[57:31] he said these words if you continue in
[57:34] my word
[57:37] then are ye my disciples indeed
[57:41] and you shall know the truth
[57:44] and the truth shall make you
[57:48] free verse 36 he says
[57:53] if the son therefore shall make you free
[57:57] you shall be free indeed
[58:02] you don't have to turn there but trust
[58:04] me romans 8 and verse
[58:06] verse 1 i'm sure they'll put it there
[58:08] quickly
[58:09] there is therefore now no condemnation
[58:13] to them which are in christ jesus who
[58:16] walk not after the flesh but after the
[58:19] spirit
[58:20] for the law of the spirit of life in
[58:24] christ jesus
[58:25] hath made me free from the law
[58:29] of sin and death you may be seated today
[58:35] very familiar scripture revelations
[58:37] chapter 5 and verse 2.
[58:41] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[58:43] with a loud voice
[58:45] who is worthy to open the book and to
[58:49] loose the seals thereof
[58:52] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[58:54] neither under the earth was able to open
[58:57] the book neither to look thereon
[58:59] and i wept much because no man was found
[59:03] worthy to
[59:04] open and to read the book neither to
[59:05] look thereon
[59:07] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[59:09] not
[59:10] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[59:13] the root of david
[59:15] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[59:19] loose the seven seals thereof
[59:21] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[59:23] throne and of the four
[59:25] beasts and in the midst of the elder
[59:27] stood a lamb
[59:29] as it had been slain having seven horns
[59:32] and seven eyes which are the seven
[59:34] spirits of god sent forth into all the
[59:36] earth
[59:37] and he came and took the book out of the
[59:40] right hand of him that set up on the
[59:42] throne
[59:43] and when he had taken the books the book
[59:45] of redemption
[59:46] the the four beasts and the four and
[59:48] twenty elders fell
[59:49] down before the lamb having every one of
[59:52] them hearts and golden vials full of
[59:54] orders
[59:55] which are the prayers of the saints
[59:57] notice these next words
[59:59] and they sung a new song
[1:00:03] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:00:06] and to open the seals thereof
[1:00:08] for thou was slain and hath redeemed us
[1:00:11] to god
[1:00:13] by the blood out of every kindred
[1:00:16] and tongue and people and nation
[1:00:20] and has made us unto our god
[1:00:23] kings and priests and we
[1:00:26] shall reign upon the earth
[1:00:30] amen and amen and amen
[1:00:34] i'd like to just speak to you for a bit
[1:00:36] this morning
[1:00:38] i have found my freedom
[1:00:43] i have found my freedom
[1:00:47] against a backdrop of chaos
[1:00:53] kind of a complex thought but i want to
[1:00:55] convey it to you
[1:00:57] today is for americans we celebrate our
[1:01:00] freedom
[1:01:02] thank god for the freedom that we have
[1:01:05] we're losing it quickly
[1:01:07] but thank god for the freedom that we
[1:01:09] have
[1:01:11] we we raise our flag fireworks went off
[1:01:14] through the night last night and and uh
[1:01:18] we raise our flag and we are americans
[1:01:20] brother brandon said many things about
[1:01:22] us being americans
[1:01:24] and how that we we are entering our
[1:01:26] glory and we're in and our shame
[1:01:29] we're americans and we we have been able
[1:01:31] to have a prophet to come from this land
[1:01:33] and
[1:01:34] a message went forth out of her
[1:01:37] and and through that we've been able to
[1:01:40] send the message around the world
[1:01:43] especially brother harold's brother
[1:01:45] harold's group
[1:01:46] sent books by the millions
[1:01:49] to out throughout the earth and even
[1:01:52] when i was a young man
[1:01:53] coming into the message i grew up in the
[1:01:55] message but i
[1:01:56] didn't know jesus but when i met jesus
[1:02:00] and i became
[1:02:01] free i began to read those books many of
[1:02:04] those books would have three or four
[1:02:06] messages within a book and uh they was
[1:02:09] just
[1:02:09] powerful still in my study today but
[1:02:12] but we stand with freedom we we thank
[1:02:15] god for freedom
[1:02:17] but freedom comes with incredible cost
[1:02:21] young men have to go away to war they're
[1:02:24] they're at war and
[1:02:26] we as a nation we only had our civil war
[1:02:29] which cost
[1:02:30] literally tens of thousands even
[1:02:32] hundreds of thousands
[1:02:34] of people's lives i don't think they'll
[1:02:35] ever have an exact number of how many
[1:02:37] lives it took
[1:02:39] but let me just say war is war is when
[1:02:42] two demons rise against one another
[1:02:45] challenges whether it's a people or a
[1:02:47] nations or
[1:02:48] whatever they are we realize that we're
[1:02:51] coming to the end of all wars
[1:02:54] it's coming so we must enjoy our freedom
[1:02:58] even as we speak here today
[1:03:02] our freedom had a great cost
[1:03:07] to be a christian came at great cost
[1:03:11] to have the life of jesus living on the
[1:03:13] inside of us
[1:03:15] cost the greatest preacher the greatest
[1:03:18] king
[1:03:19] the greatest man that ever lived on
[1:03:21] earth the most
[1:03:22] innocent precious lamb of god
[1:03:25] god came to the earth to manifest and
[1:03:29] destroy the
[1:03:30] works of the devil and to proclaim that
[1:03:33] the prince of this world
[1:03:35] is judged and when he was on the cross
[1:03:40] he was redeeming every one of us
[1:03:46] i want you to know no man could save
[1:03:49] himself
[1:03:50] no prophet could save himself
[1:03:54] our prophet of this day could not save
[1:03:56] himself he was
[1:03:58] born of sinful flesh he couldn't even
[1:04:01] pay for his own sins much less the sins
[1:04:04] of others
[1:04:06] god had to take a redeemed man
[1:04:09] and give him a redeemed word that would
[1:04:12] be able to preach to a redeemed bride
[1:04:15] to get her ready for the marriage supper
[1:04:18] of the lamb
[1:04:19] and the rapture
[1:04:24] it came at great cost must remember
[1:04:28] we must remember i i i found this the
[1:04:31] other day and it just
[1:04:32] spoke volumes to to me
[1:04:40] if the son has made you free you're free
[1:04:43] indeed
[1:04:46] during the national observance of the
[1:04:49] 100th anniversary of the statue of
[1:04:51] liberty
[1:04:52] in a new york harbor
[1:04:57] i was struck by the great emphasis of on
[1:05:00] the number of
[1:05:01] immigrants who had often left everything
[1:05:04] behind
[1:05:06] coming to america with nothing but the
[1:05:08] clothes on their back they risked their
[1:05:10] lives
[1:05:11] for something that they valued more
[1:05:13] highly
[1:05:18] then everything that was left behind
[1:05:22] freedom amen they did not take their
[1:05:26] adopted country's
[1:05:28] hard-won freedom for granted neither
[1:05:31] must we
[1:05:34] their experience is a picture of what we
[1:05:36] must do
[1:05:37] when we come to christ we must forsake
[1:05:40] the allegiance of the world
[1:05:42] amen and leave behind all
[1:05:46] that it offers and become
[1:05:49] citizens of a new kingdom the kingdom of
[1:05:53] god
[1:05:54] his stature of liberty came in the form
[1:05:58] of a cross
[1:06:00] the statue of the new york harbor lifts
[1:06:03] her
[1:06:04] lamp beside the golden door the statue
[1:06:07] of liberty on that
[1:06:09] our hill is outside of jerusalem lights
[1:06:12] away to eternal love
[1:06:17] no one braves the treacherous journey to
[1:06:19] america in order to live as a
[1:06:21] as they would in their homeland likewise
[1:06:26] christ did not leave glory and suffering
[1:06:30] agonizing death so that you could live
[1:06:33] anything less than absolute
[1:06:36] freedom
[1:06:39] hallelujah our money tells us that in
[1:06:43] god
[1:06:44] we trust our nation has forgotten that
[1:06:49] but we as christians must never forget
[1:06:54] as i spoke last week on hold your
[1:06:56] position
[1:06:58] never forget who you trust in
[1:07:03] there's some fights that we're going to
[1:07:05] have to struggle with
[1:07:07] some spiritual wars some physical
[1:07:10] battles
[1:07:13] we're going to have to battle faith
[1:07:15] versus wisdom
[1:07:17] intellectual ability sometimes faith has
[1:07:21] to look at the
[1:07:21] unseen and the unproven
[1:07:26] things that you cannot explain
[1:07:31] some things that you just go it's in
[1:07:33] god's hands
[1:07:35] but you have faith that god's going to
[1:07:37] take care of it some way
[1:07:40] somehow
[1:07:43] we must remember that as christians
[1:07:45] we're no longer a slave to the world
[1:07:49] sometimes when we talk about slavery we
[1:07:52] think of
[1:07:53] of different races of people but i want
[1:07:56] you to understand to the world
[1:07:58] everybody's a slave
[1:08:01] just the conditions are different the
[1:08:04] egyptians became
[1:08:06] slave by circumstance in egypt
[1:08:11] but god had promised him the deliverance
[1:08:15] he promised them a deliverance there's
[1:08:18] where i would like to start this morning
[1:08:21] when moses is standing there before the
[1:08:23] greatest phenomena that ever happens
[1:08:26] he's standing in a red sea with a rod in
[1:08:29] his hands
[1:08:30] and the people begin to grumble and
[1:08:32] complain with good matter
[1:08:34] and reason by the things that you see
[1:08:40] they are getting ready to see a very
[1:08:42] complex miracle
[1:08:45] they have believed a message they have
[1:08:47] been let go out of egypt
[1:08:49] and they begin their journey and they
[1:08:51] come to the face of the red sea
[1:08:56] are you with me now and i want you to
[1:08:59] remember
[1:08:59] god had hardened pharaoh's heart
[1:09:06] and pharaoh turns all of his military
[1:09:09] loose
[1:09:11] and he sends them forth leading them
[1:09:14] to destroy the children of israel
[1:09:19] two million people let me just say this
[1:09:22] to you
[1:09:24] in the face of freedom if we could look
[1:09:28] the backdrop of that is the greatest
[1:09:30] army
[1:09:31] that has ever stood ready to destroy
[1:09:34] them
[1:09:35] in a moment's notice if only they can
[1:09:38] get to them
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:40] but god sent a pillar of fire and held
[1:09:43] them at bay
[1:09:46] while he could open open up a basically
[1:09:49] an ocean
[1:09:50] for them to be able to walk across on
[1:09:53] dry land
[1:09:55] in the phenomena of a phenomenal miracle
[1:09:58] to set them free from their slavery
[1:10:02] and set them free from the economy and
[1:10:04] the politics of egypt
[1:10:07] god has to hold the enemy at faith
[1:10:15] come on church for the believers you've
[1:10:18] got to anchor your soul in jesus christ
[1:10:33] behind every great story there's a
[1:10:36] backdrop
[1:10:39] caleb tells the people that we're more
[1:10:41] than able
[1:10:44] to take the land
[1:10:48] we're more than able god's dropped this
[1:10:51] in revelation
[1:10:52] i've been here 40 years and the promise
[1:10:55] is still true
[1:10:56] and he tells the people with victory in
[1:10:58] his heart
[1:11:00] you've heard these 10 spies tell them
[1:11:02] that how big the giants are
[1:11:04] and how horrible the conditions are but
[1:11:07] god's more than able
[1:11:10] he's more than able to take us through
[1:11:13] sure there's giants
[1:11:14] sure there's great adversary there but
[1:11:17] god's greater than that
[1:11:18] he's made us a promise he told abraham
[1:11:22] at the tent
[1:11:23] how make your seed possess the gates of
[1:11:25] their enemy
[1:11:27] wear his seed
[1:11:29] [Applause]
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:38] to summarize abraham
[1:11:41] is a very complex story
[1:11:44] abraham's the richest
[1:11:48] of any any around you may not see it he
[1:11:51] looks like he's traveling like a nomad
[1:11:55] but god's with him sometimes whether you
[1:11:58] realize or not you're the richest in
[1:12:00] this world
[1:12:04] i'm not talking about your billfold your
[1:12:05] checking account your ira or whatever
[1:12:07] you've got
[1:12:09] but you've got jesus
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:12] and it's beneficial to your not only you
[1:12:15] but your family
[1:12:16] your children's children your children's
[1:12:18] children and there's a blessing that is
[1:12:20] pronounced upon them
[1:12:23] are you with me companies are blessed
[1:12:26] because of you
[1:12:28] this nation continues to be blessed
[1:12:31] because of you
[1:12:33] your prayers
[1:12:37] your prayers
[1:12:42] are you with me holes at bay the enemy
[1:12:47] holds at bay pestilences and torments
[1:12:50] it holds at bay
[1:12:54] bombs can't drop on america
[1:12:59] they're coming but they can't drop till
[1:13:01] you leave
[1:13:03] so men can build bombs and let me just
[1:13:06] say this you
[1:13:06] they're not just building them to put
[1:13:08] them in a warehouse
[1:13:13] they made better swords they made better
[1:13:15] knives they made better guns
[1:13:19] man is always evolving they made bombs
[1:13:22] and they made
[1:13:23] hydrogen bombs they made atomic bombs
[1:13:26] they're not
[1:13:26] making them just to store them in a
[1:13:28] warehouse or to make a threat
[1:13:31] it was like israel a few maybe a decade
[1:13:33] ago
[1:13:34] they had their enemy was going to try to
[1:13:36] overtake them
[1:13:38] they just simply pulled all of their
[1:13:40] atomic material
[1:13:41] planes of war fire out put them right on
[1:13:43] the air bases so the enemy could see
[1:13:45] them
[1:13:48] israel is determined i'm not going to
[1:13:50] lose a war
[1:13:53] they're determined i'm not going to lose
[1:13:55] a war
[1:13:57] are you with me they're not going to
[1:13:59] lose a war it's been promised that
[1:14:01] they'd be here
[1:14:02] jesus is coming back to that city one of
[1:14:04] these days
[1:14:06] they're not going to lose a war i'm
[1:14:07] going to tell you
[1:14:09] this gets to biting today i want you to
[1:14:11] know joe they're not going to lose a war
[1:14:14] you better take her aside she's not
[1:14:16] losing
[1:14:24] and i want to remind you as believers
[1:14:26] we're not gonna lose the law
[1:14:30] we're gonna stand and fight for our
[1:14:31] god-given rights
[1:14:33] our promises are the word of god we'll
[1:14:36] not lose a lord
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:54] first john chapter 3 and verse 7 let
[1:14:56] little children let no man deceive you
[1:14:59] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:15:02] and as he is righteous he that
[1:15:05] committeth sin is of the devil
[1:15:08] but the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:15:10] for this purpose
[1:15:12] the son of god was manifested
[1:15:15] that he might destroy the works
[1:15:19] of the devil and whosoever is
[1:15:22] born of god doth not commit sin
[1:15:27] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:15:30] cannot sin
[1:15:31] because he is born of god in this the
[1:15:34] children of god are manifest
[1:15:36] and the children of the devil whosoever
[1:15:39] doeth not righteous this is not of god
[1:15:41] and neither he that loveth not his
[1:15:44] brother
[1:15:45] we will destroy the works of the devil
[1:15:49] that's what we've been sent here to do
[1:15:50] in this age
[1:15:56] brother brandon makes a statement it
[1:15:57] just just burns on my heart even now
[1:16:01] he said the whole burden of all the
[1:16:05] world
[1:16:07] rested upon him calvary the dark
[1:16:11] hours of gethsemane laid before him
[1:16:15] and all as as he went he never noticed
[1:16:19] their scoffing
[1:16:21] what a background that's right you know
[1:16:24] when someone says something evil about
[1:16:26] you you want to take it up and get angry
[1:16:28] about it
[1:16:29] just shows you haven't went deep enough
[1:16:31] yet with god
[1:16:32] big men don't do those things but what
[1:16:36] made him god to me
[1:16:38] he was big he didn't have to notice
[1:16:42] their little scoffing
[1:16:44] he had a purpose
[1:16:48] what a background it was many years ago
[1:16:51] i was laying in my bed and i was
[1:16:53] i've been contemplating maybe for days
[1:16:56] of
[1:16:57] you know brother branham tied the loose
[1:17:00] ends together and he would go and grab
[1:17:01] from this and he would grab from this
[1:17:03] commentary and he'd grab from this
[1:17:06] this teaching of this man or this
[1:17:08] teaching from that man over there
[1:17:10] he'd go back into the 1700s or back
[1:17:12] martin luther
[1:17:14] or he would grab from wesley or he would
[1:17:16] grab from other great writers
[1:17:18] he would grab from them and they always
[1:17:20] kind of
[1:17:21] kind of made me kind of mind-boggled of
[1:17:24] in his short life how did he grab so
[1:17:27] many things that were so powerful
[1:17:32] and i went to bed that evening i had my
[1:17:34] hands behind my bed and i
[1:17:36] my head and i was just i was laying
[1:17:37] there and i have a collection of books
[1:17:40] it's uh
[1:17:41] it's a c c h m set of books
[1:17:46] and i think it was written in the 1800s
[1:17:50] maybe
[1:17:51] and it was a gift to me many years ago
[1:17:54] as a minister
[1:17:55] and i was just i was just laying there
[1:17:59] and the lord impressed on me to go
[1:18:01] to my library and so i went to my
[1:18:04] library and i knew you had a plan
[1:18:07] and they and these thoughts on my mind
[1:18:09] how did brother branham get
[1:18:10] certain things or how is he led or you
[1:18:13] know you just can't read volumes in a
[1:18:15] short lifetime
[1:18:16] and i'm standing there before it
[1:18:20] and i'm impressed to pick one book and i
[1:18:22] just opened it just like that and i let
[1:18:24] it just fall open to a page
[1:18:28] and i begin to read that page and
[1:18:31] and the writer is saying jesus's
[1:18:34] atmosphere
[1:18:37] what's so powerful amen
[1:18:40] he was so powerful until
[1:18:44] when he's standing before pilate
[1:18:49] the backdrop was the whole nation was
[1:18:52] screaming for his blood
[1:18:55] and they were screaming and only days
[1:18:57] before miracles had happened and
[1:18:59] miracles
[1:18:59] but they came under the realm of the
[1:19:01] demons of hell
[1:19:03] to kill jesus christ
[1:19:06] are you with me a few days ago they're
[1:19:08] screaming hosanna to the king
[1:19:11] but now now listen rights is no new
[1:19:14] thing
[1:19:16] the devil has stirred riots forever
[1:19:21] but that don't make god nervous
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:25] i don't make him nervous and jesus is
[1:19:27] standing before
[1:19:28] pilate and all of them are screaming
[1:19:31] crucify him
[1:19:33] crucify him and it's literally mind
[1:19:36] boggling how they're screaming against
[1:19:39] jesus christ
[1:19:44] and the writer said jesus's presence
[1:19:49] was so deafening till he never heard the
[1:19:53] mob
[1:19:55] amen amen
[1:19:59] he was in control amen
[1:20:02] standing even right there before pilate
[1:20:05] and he has a conversation with him
[1:20:08] to which he would remind him of what
[1:20:11] kingdom he was from
[1:20:15] my kingdom is much more powerful than
[1:20:18] this one
[1:20:21] you think about where we are today
[1:20:26] when jesus was here israel
[1:20:29] wasn't even governed by jews amen
[1:20:35] when we think about his greatest moments
[1:20:39] he's literally in the hands of a roman
[1:20:42] government
[1:20:45] your freedom
[1:20:48] came with great cost
[1:20:51] with every demon in hell screaming at
[1:20:54] him
[1:20:55] trying to destroy his body
[1:20:59] we're praying for sister karen today but
[1:21:02] her
[1:21:02] healing her freedom from that
[1:21:06] stroke was paid for 2000 years ago
[1:21:13] and satan was full bore trying to
[1:21:16] destroy that body
[1:21:17] beating on it but satan couldn't realize
[1:21:22] the more he beat
[1:21:23] the more he set free
[1:21:29] we still need his healing touch
[1:21:33] we still need his miracle working power
[1:21:36] today
[1:21:37] to set us free from cancer to set us
[1:21:40] free from tuberculosis
[1:21:42] to set us free from the mms to set us
[1:21:45] free
[1:21:46] from anxieties of the world freedom came
[1:21:49] at much cost
[1:21:50] but it is paid for
[1:21:53] it's paid for
[1:21:55] [Applause]
[1:22:08] brother brown said one day when adam's
[1:22:09] race was backed into a corner
[1:22:12] the law had failed justice had failed
[1:22:17] prophets had failed the judges had
[1:22:20] failed
[1:22:21] everything that god sent to the earth
[1:22:24] had failed
[1:22:26] and adam's race stood defeated
[1:22:29] sickness among them death among them
[1:22:31] everything the death horrors in every
[1:22:33] place
[1:22:34] nothing could be done but in heaven
[1:22:36] there was one that stepped out
[1:22:39] the son of god and said this day i give
[1:22:42] my life for adam's race
[1:22:46] what will you do cried the angels what
[1:22:48] will you do he came to the earth
[1:22:51] he looked upon the bunch of men and
[1:22:52] women that wanted to serve the lord
[1:22:55] they couldn't there was so much
[1:22:58] temptation and so much sin
[1:23:00] and so much sickness and so much
[1:23:02] troubles on every hand
[1:23:03] they couldn't everything had failed he
[1:23:06] looked till he was
[1:23:07] found in the darkest place of man's
[1:23:10] field
[1:23:11] and that was death it's always been and
[1:23:14] he ran right to calvary and got the
[1:23:16] thickest spears
[1:23:17] and throwed him into his heart and cried
[1:23:19] back
[1:23:20] take what i leave you the baptism of the
[1:23:23] holy ghost
[1:23:24] and fight as hard as you can
[1:23:28] i take it as a mandate and i take it as
[1:23:30] commission of the word of god
[1:23:32] we won't be and we won't bow we won't
[1:23:34] turn back we won't give up
[1:23:37] we have been commissioned by the holy
[1:23:39] ghost to preach this word with all of
[1:23:41] our hearts
[1:23:44] jesus has the answer to every need that
[1:23:46] you've got
[1:23:52] brother and i mean if there ever was a
[1:23:53] time when those disciples picked up the
[1:23:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:57] one of the mightiest weapons that's ever
[1:23:59] been given into the hands of men
[1:24:01] and they cut a hole today through sin
[1:24:04] they defeated the devil
[1:24:05] and running him back with sickness and
[1:24:07] all of these things
[1:24:08] men wants to see heroism
[1:24:11] men are waiting for a gallop to stand
[1:24:15] the world's waiting to find a man who
[1:24:18] can step
[1:24:19] out
[1:24:22] what about you wherever you're listening
[1:24:26] to this sermon
[1:24:29] i heard a sermon one time and said
[1:24:32] lay aside every weight in the sin which
[1:24:34] just so easily beset you
[1:24:37] amen i was sitting in about 1500 people
[1:24:40] when i heard that
[1:24:42] it impacted me i didn't wait on somebody
[1:24:46] else to get the answer
[1:24:47] it impacted me what will you do with
[1:24:50] your life and what will you do with your
[1:24:52] 24 hours
[1:24:54] it's not about how much money you have i
[1:24:56] probably couldn't have afforded anything
[1:24:58] at that point
[1:24:59] but i want you to understand i committed
[1:25:01] my life
[1:25:04] i have preached with great passion
[1:25:06] through all of these decades now
[1:25:08] i have preached with great passion i
[1:25:09] have not been i have not bowed
[1:25:11] i have not turned around i've been
[1:25:14] preaching this message all of these
[1:25:16] years
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:22] in the backdrop that is behind me even
[1:25:24] now
[1:25:27] i don't stand with fear
[1:25:34] storms come storms go
[1:25:47] on down into the regions of the demons
[1:25:50] on down to the very gates of hell he
[1:25:53] knocks on the doors of hell
[1:25:56] and when he did the devil come out and
[1:25:58] they said i can hear him say oh
[1:25:59] so finally you've you've arrived i
[1:26:02] thought you i had you when i killed abel
[1:26:05] you see when the seed was promised in
[1:26:09] the garden of eden the devil was
[1:26:11] constantly trying to destroy that seed
[1:26:14] and death and the death of abel and the
[1:26:17] coming of seth
[1:26:18] was just a death burial and resurrection
[1:26:22] of christ that's the seed
[1:26:25] must continue he tried to destroy it i
[1:26:29] thought i had you when i destroyed abel
[1:26:31] i thought i had you and i destroyed the
[1:26:33] prophets i was positive if i had you
[1:26:35] when i beheaded john
[1:26:37] and now after all you've arrived and
[1:26:39] i've got you now
[1:26:41] and i can hear him say satan come here
[1:26:45] and he reaches over and he grabs the
[1:26:47] keys of
[1:26:48] death hell off of his side and hung it
[1:26:52] on his own side
[1:26:53] i want to serve notice on you you've
[1:26:56] been a
[1:26:56] bluff long ago and i am the virgin born
[1:27:00] son of the living god and my blood is
[1:27:03] still
[1:27:04] wet on the cross and the full debt is
[1:27:06] paid
[1:27:07] you have no rights no more you are
[1:27:10] stripped
[1:27:13] give me those keys and he turns around
[1:27:15] and he gives them
[1:27:16] a good healthy kick and slams the door
[1:27:19] together
[1:27:20] and said stay in there i'm the boss
[1:27:23] from now on
[1:27:35] i like it when god reminds the devil i
[1:27:37] am the host
[1:27:39] i have the keys of death hell and the
[1:27:41] grave and you are nothing but a bluff
[1:27:47] here he starts up and where is job and
[1:27:49] where is abraham where are they at
[1:27:51] where are those fellows that trusted god
[1:27:53] in his word has he forgotten them did
[1:27:56] death annihilate them
[1:27:58] what was the what was the after all
[1:28:01] never never god has to keep his word and
[1:28:04] i see sarah and abraham walking around
[1:28:06] there and after a while something
[1:28:08] come the door abraham goes and opens up
[1:28:10] the door and he said honey come here
[1:28:13] look here
[1:28:15] look here the very same one that stood
[1:28:17] with me under that oak tree that day
[1:28:20] he's abraham's god and jesus i can see
[1:28:24] daniel over there over his shoulder and
[1:28:26] say
[1:28:27] that's the rock that was hewed out of a
[1:28:29] mountain just as certain as i'm standing
[1:28:31] here
[1:28:32] i see job raised up and said that's my
[1:28:34] redeemer
[1:28:35] that i see that lived that i knew and
[1:28:37] lived and someday i would stand
[1:28:39] upon the earth my body may not be
[1:28:42] but a little spoonful of ashes but i'm
[1:28:45] 15 minutes
[1:28:46] i'll be in and again that's him
[1:28:52] ezekiel looks over the top and said i
[1:28:54] see the same person
[1:28:56] as a will within the middle of the wheel
[1:28:58] turning way up in the middle of the air
[1:29:00] then enoch says i saw him coming ten
[1:29:04] thousand of his saints to execute
[1:29:06] judgment
[1:29:08] there was the old testament saints
[1:29:10] waiting sure they was under the
[1:29:11] atonement of the blood
[1:29:13] they could not go in until the presence
[1:29:15] of god
[1:29:16] god of heaven because goat and sheep
[1:29:19] blood
[1:29:20] could not take away sin but he said my
[1:29:23] brethren i'm the one that you think that
[1:29:25] i
[1:29:26] am
[1:29:29] i am the one that you think that i am
[1:29:32] you may be trapped in abraham's bosom
[1:29:35] for
[1:29:36] all of these hundreds of years look at
[1:29:38] the backdrop
[1:29:39] but today you are free
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:30:04] um
[1:30:07] the other day i was riding through my
[1:30:09] woods on a golf cart
[1:30:13] i needed a moment
[1:30:17] i was riding through the woods and this
[1:30:20] is going through the woods i just
[1:30:21] stopped
[1:30:27] i said lord i want to talk to you
[1:30:32] i want to thank you that i'm not even
[1:30:35] the same man that it was before you met
[1:30:38] me
[1:30:43] and i'm going to say some very deep
[1:30:45] things right now
[1:30:48] man that was born of charles and charlie
[1:30:52] and christine spencer that blood runs
[1:30:55] through my veins
[1:30:57] but it could not keep me
[1:31:02] amen because i was born of sin
[1:31:07] and that blood would have only taken me
[1:31:09] back to the earth
[1:31:12] and would have taken me into the realm
[1:31:13] of lost
[1:31:16] and all of their weakness i was i was
[1:31:18] sharing with the world
[1:31:20] life of party alcoholism
[1:31:24] the wrong kind of associates and friends
[1:31:28] the wrong kind of desires i was driven
[1:31:33] i was driven with a drive inside of me
[1:31:39] to go as hard as i could into the world
[1:31:43] you see i've been raising the message
[1:31:45] but i didn't know the author
[1:31:49] being raised in church is one thing but
[1:31:52] when you meet
[1:31:56] jesus
[1:31:58] when you meet jesus with a supernatural
[1:32:01] birth
[1:32:02] and let me just say for these preachers
[1:32:04] that want to explain a supernatural
[1:32:06] birth away
[1:32:07] you have admitted yourself
[1:32:17] this is more than a formula
[1:32:20] this is more than some recipe this
[1:32:23] is more than come under some preacher's
[1:32:26] anointing
[1:32:27] or some kingdom anointing this is
[1:32:30] more than any of that this
[1:32:33] is meeting this message is jesus
[1:32:36] christ himself
[1:32:40] that's not going to rapture your books
[1:32:42] and your tapes and your pictures
[1:32:44] he's going to rapture human flesh that
[1:32:47] he's come to dwell
[1:32:48] on the inside of us
[1:32:52] and yes you was a stinking caterpillar
[1:32:55] that nobody wanted but god by the
[1:32:58] transforming power
[1:32:59] of jesus christ
[1:33:01] [Applause]
[1:33:04] didn't just make you over he made you
[1:33:07] new
[1:33:09] [Applause]
[1:33:24] thank you
[1:33:43] so i thank him
[1:33:46] that i'm not the same man that's right
[1:33:51] that i used to be
[1:33:54] where'd he go he died
[1:34:04] i think sometimes we must think about
[1:34:05] those things
[1:34:07] it used to be you had a taste for beer a
[1:34:09] taste for wine
[1:34:11] taste for drugs takes for the wrong kind
[1:34:13] of
[1:34:14] associates when i come to jesus i'm
[1:34:18] going to have to leave so many friends
[1:34:20] oh no you got that wrong
[1:34:21] they're going to need you
[1:34:30] whether you realize that cool beer that
[1:34:32] you're drinking it's destroying your
[1:34:34] brain cells
[1:34:37] that drugs that's made you high today
[1:34:40] you'll need
[1:34:40] more of that tomorrow than what you had
[1:34:43] today to make you have
[1:34:46] and without jesus you can't keep your
[1:34:50] vows
[1:34:50] when you say i do oh you may now cheat
[1:34:54] with another woman
[1:34:56] but because of your lustful nature
[1:35:01] i'm preaching now
[1:35:04] you'll be a porn habit backslidden
[1:35:08] rotten human being that'll corrupt your
[1:35:11] wife
[1:35:13] and you'll fall right to your children
[1:35:14] come on that's why you need a new birth
[1:35:18] you can sit in a church view without a
[1:35:21] birth and you're still as rotten as you
[1:35:23] ever was but when you meet jesus
[1:35:27] you're free and you'll never be the same
[1:35:30] the rest of your life
[1:35:41] i must admit the man that sister connie
[1:35:43] married
[1:35:44] is very disappointing to me now
[1:35:50] but i want you to know the one that he
[1:35:51] became
[1:35:54] she can be proud of
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:08] we occasionally have some real
[1:36:10] conversations at our house
[1:36:17] maybe you don't have them but in the
[1:36:21] backdrop of what we're facing we have to
[1:36:23] have real conversations
[1:36:27] this ain't hollywood saints this ain't a
[1:36:31] fairy tale
[1:36:37] someone sent me a note the other day
[1:36:38] said it must not be as bad as what
[1:36:40] they say it is i just send them back a
[1:36:44] note
[1:36:44] glad it's not you
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:51] you see i just had an eye seizure before
[1:36:53] i walked into the building this day
[1:36:55] you see satan is always at attack but i
[1:36:58] can preach with one eye as good as i can
[1:36:59] preach with two
[1:37:12] brother timothy pruitt was here with us
[1:37:14] the other day
[1:37:16] and he said something about sending a
[1:37:18] cannon fire
[1:37:21] said they were looked like they were
[1:37:23] crushed
[1:37:24] and was telling them to give up and so i
[1:37:27] responded with cannon fire
[1:37:31] so that's what i've done
[1:37:35] i'm only responding again with cannon
[1:37:37] fire this morning
[1:37:40] edmonton you may not have watched all
[1:37:42] the services in the last year and a half
[1:37:45] but i want you to know i've stood at my
[1:37:46] duties
[1:37:48] sometimes hanging on to this place many
[1:37:51] times not feeling like preaching
[1:37:53] but you got to look right square in the
[1:37:55] devil's eyes and spit right in his eyes
[1:37:58] pull it short against him and tell him
[1:38:00] he does not have that victory
[1:38:02] over top god is greater than cancer
[1:38:25] you see god is watching over everything
[1:38:30] there's a purpose in your life
[1:38:34] many years ago i was sitting studying
[1:38:38] in edmonton it was on a saturday
[1:38:43] i was studying at a little little tiny
[1:38:45] desk in the
[1:38:46] the hotel room i don't remember the
[1:38:50] the year i haven't conferred with
[1:38:52] matthew about this but
[1:38:54] i was sitting there and as i was sitting
[1:38:56] i saw a vision
[1:38:58] i saw a vision of matthew sitting beside
[1:39:00] the side of the road rubbing his knee
[1:39:04] and i saw his motorcycle on the mountain
[1:39:07] as
[1:39:07] and the wheels were still turning
[1:39:14] i called him
[1:39:18] brother matthew if you'll stand just now
[1:39:22] he's our song leader here now he's a
[1:39:23] preacher here now
[1:39:27] you see satan would like to destroy you
[1:39:29] because he knows there's potential
[1:39:31] inside of you
[1:39:35] but though i might be whatever two
[1:39:37] thousand twenty five hundred miles apart
[1:39:41] everything's just right together
[1:39:45] so god chose me the vision of matthew
[1:39:47] and iraq and i just i just called him i
[1:39:49] said
[1:39:49] how you doing good
[1:39:55] you know you can answer without telling
[1:39:57] everything
[1:39:59] good so we talked for just a couple
[1:40:02] moments and i said
[1:40:04] how was a wreck well he knew nobody
[1:40:08] knew but john that used to come here
[1:40:13] and he would have his shirt unbuttoned
[1:40:15] down to here
[1:40:18] a long bushy hair
[1:40:21] he called john you know you'll meet him
[1:40:25] again in heaven
[1:40:29] but god would have it so that he would
[1:40:30] give his heart totally to god
[1:40:32] the last service he was in
[1:40:36] [Applause]
[1:40:45] he said that nobody knows cassie knows
[1:40:47] cassie's
[1:40:48] you know
[1:40:52] andrew knew well then boys are
[1:40:55] inseparable
[1:41:01] so how was the wreck
[1:41:04] and he began to explain it to me hit a
[1:41:07] rock
[1:41:07] hit some rock in the road and the bike
[1:41:09] went one way and he went the other way
[1:41:12] he said how's the knee had his hand on
[1:41:15] his knee at that point
[1:41:18] he said well brother ron what does that
[1:41:19] got to do with it
[1:41:21] god was showing matthew
[1:41:24] amen i see you
[1:41:30] i see you i'm preaching a meeting for
[1:41:33] your congregation brother ed brother
[1:41:35] harold
[1:41:43] and that boy is on god's mind
[1:41:49] and he would have never told me had god
[1:41:50] not showed me
[1:41:54] that bite's gone now
[1:41:58] he wasn't a song leader nor a preacher
[1:42:00] at that time
[1:42:04] but god was watching over him
[1:42:11] give the lord a good hand
[1:42:29] brother shannon you were sitting at a
[1:42:30] table with a lot of bottles on your
[1:42:32] on your table
[1:42:39] but you're not that man anymore
[1:42:49] but that you might know god's got you
[1:42:52] where you are
[1:42:53] because there's a seed there
[1:42:59] you've been having a question about it
[1:43:01] there's a seed there
[1:43:04] and he's caused a lot of backdrop behind
[1:43:06] you
[1:43:09] but he's got a purpose
[1:43:15] hallelujah
[1:43:18] he's watching over your life he's got a
[1:43:22] hold of it amen
[1:43:24] he knows exactly the situation that's
[1:43:26] going on
[1:43:27] in your life how you know
[1:43:31] god spoke to me on that deal
[1:43:36] i was walking across the road with
[1:43:38] brother timothy pruitt the other day
[1:43:43] we're going across the road and
[1:43:46] and i just shared with him something
[1:43:48] that would be maybe of a little answer
[1:43:52] i said brother timothy i was kind of
[1:43:54] looking at
[1:43:55] kind of where i'm at and god took
[1:43:59] me to a quote about caesar
[1:44:03] and he was going to have a parade and he
[1:44:06] was looking for somebody to ride with
[1:44:08] him
[1:44:11] and all the officers got their their
[1:44:14] their
[1:44:15] all of their brass ready polished it
[1:44:18] their plumes ready they got everything
[1:44:20] just right
[1:44:21] and caesar makes a ride through them and
[1:44:24] he finally comes to a man that's got all
[1:44:27] kinds of scars on him
[1:44:29] really rough shape and he asked him
[1:44:33] where'd you get those scars and he said
[1:44:35] i got them
[1:44:36] in the battle for you my lord that's
[1:44:39] right
[1:44:39] amen and he said you'll ride with me
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:46] god dropped that in my heart
[1:44:50] here's my consolation we might have to
[1:44:53] go
[1:44:54] through some very difficult things but
[1:44:57] god is telling us you're right with me
[1:45:12] can you give me just a little bit more
[1:45:14] to preach to you
[1:45:17] brother branham says these words
[1:45:20] he said oh he said trials come churches
[1:45:23] gets all shook
[1:45:24] up and gets so easy for a congregation
[1:45:26] to do when something don't seem to
[1:45:28] happen the way that it's supposed to do
[1:45:30] god makes a way god brings tensions into
[1:45:34] a church
[1:45:36] for every son that cometh to god must be
[1:45:38] tried
[1:45:39] and proven and tested listen to these
[1:45:42] words
[1:45:42] he let sickness strike you he lets
[1:45:45] diseases come on you
[1:45:47] to test you to prove you to show the
[1:45:49] world that you're
[1:45:50] truly the seed of abraham
[1:45:56] he permits it by his own will he permits
[1:45:58] disasters
[1:45:59] he permits at the friends to turn
[1:46:01] against you
[1:46:02] he permits all of these things and turns
[1:46:04] the devil loose to tempt you
[1:46:06] he'll do all but take your life
[1:46:11] he could throw you on the bed of
[1:46:13] affliction he could turn you over your
[1:46:15] your neighbors against you he could turn
[1:46:17] the church against you
[1:46:18] he could do almost anything and it's
[1:46:21] god's will for him to do it
[1:46:23] amen and we are taught it's more
[1:46:26] precious to us
[1:46:33] you're talking about a backdrop
[1:46:37] i've been preaching to you over the last
[1:46:38] few weeks praising him in the storm
[1:46:42] amen
[1:46:45] are you with me now it's not an easy
[1:46:47] thing
[1:46:48] when you go through a storm and it looks
[1:46:50] like all hell is turned loose on you
[1:46:52] but i want to remind you god's got an
[1:46:55] anchor for you
[1:46:58] when your bank account one won't hold
[1:47:00] you and your insurance won't hold you
[1:47:04] and the world turns against you you can
[1:47:07] hold on
[1:47:08] to god's word
[1:47:17] let me just say a few things here before
[1:47:19] we go
[1:47:21] this message that is so phenomenal
[1:47:24] amen let's just remind ourselves
[1:47:28] it was preached to us behind two world
[1:47:32] wars
[1:47:34] a battle in korea vietnam starting up
[1:47:41] it was delivered just after a depression
[1:47:46] industrialization begins to take off
[1:47:49] music begins to change from the good old
[1:47:51] boy hillbilly singing
[1:47:54] to rock and roll and all hell being
[1:47:57] turned loose
[1:47:59] through the beatles and elvis presley
[1:48:01] and those people that begin to
[1:48:03] let me just say they were inspired of
[1:48:05] health
[1:48:08] that might hurt your feelings but they
[1:48:10] should not be your hero to start off
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:16] with
[1:48:26] brother brown points those spirits out
[1:48:29] seven visions comes forth
[1:48:34] i don't have to take you through it but
[1:48:36] adolf hitler
[1:48:38] would lead germany to world war
[1:48:41] ii let me just say you didn't need an
[1:48:44] ambassador we had a prophet to tell us
[1:48:48] we're getting ready to go into battle
[1:48:49] the world war
[1:48:52] it would tell about leaders that would
[1:48:54] hang and come to a shameful death
[1:48:58] call them out by name not wishy-washy
[1:49:01] call them out by name
[1:49:02] i'm never ever ever amazed at people
[1:49:05] that will go back to a man like
[1:49:07] nostradamus
[1:49:08] and say he was a great man and could see
[1:49:11] vague things
[1:49:13] he wasn't accurate on anything but you
[1:49:16] had a prophet of god in this day
[1:49:18] that called people by name their address
[1:49:21] the condition that they had
[1:49:23] what the doctors told them their
[1:49:25] children their children's children
[1:49:26] tell them where they live
[1:49:31] and yet people will set and question
[1:49:33] brother branham
[1:49:38] well i got a better idea or cut it apart
[1:49:40] or slice it apart who
[1:49:42] are you what vindication do you
[1:49:54] have
[1:50:04] stood there and told him about adolf
[1:50:06] hitler told him
[1:50:08] he told them about how the cars would be
[1:50:12] made like they are now we're even
[1:50:15] advanced to that so it's already
[1:50:16] fulfilled you don't have to wait on that
[1:50:18] it's already fulfilled
[1:50:20] when you see a tesla going down the road
[1:50:21] that that fulfilled that vision very
[1:50:23] well
[1:50:26] still with me also told us of women
[1:50:29] getting the right to vote
[1:50:31] are you with me then told us about a
[1:50:33] woman of purple are you with me now
[1:50:41] and the other day when you saw an
[1:50:42] inauguration she stood there in a purple
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:50] dress
[1:50:59] i don't know if you paid any attention
[1:51:00] to your news this week that her staff
[1:51:02] don't even like to be around her
[1:51:05] of how cruel that that woman is listen
[1:51:08] she slept her way to the top
[1:51:11] go ahead go ahead and send it out on the
[1:51:13] media
[1:51:15] she slept her way to the top to become
[1:51:17] the governor of california
[1:51:21] she slept her way there let me just say
[1:51:26] don't you put your trust in no politics
[1:51:41] i'm not a coward i will preach in an
[1:51:45] open public
[1:51:46] pulpit where people will get behind a
[1:51:49] computer someone another
[1:51:53] and send out an anonymous text
[1:52:12] sodom and gomorrah is here
[1:52:17] against the backdrop
[1:52:21] of a gender that don't know who they are
[1:52:26] they're fighting for their rights
[1:52:31] brother branham stood there and preached
[1:52:32] the seals
[1:52:35] and then and went to almost seven times
[1:52:38] around the world
[1:52:39] and preached the message against the
[1:52:41] backdrop
[1:52:43] a martin luther king and this nation
[1:52:45] almost
[1:52:46] upside down and people being washed by
[1:52:50] fire hoses crawl
[1:52:54] listen all men were created equal
[1:52:58] we got no problems with none of that
[1:53:02] all men were created equal
[1:53:05] god's blood pays for every sin
[1:53:12] let me just say god will clean the worst
[1:53:15] harlot
[1:53:15] the worst homosexual
[1:53:20] and worse than all of that is these
[1:53:22] religious demons
[1:53:24] he can wash all of that away
[1:53:27] and set you free
[1:53:50] the book of revelations is written
[1:53:57] and we we read six phenomenal
[1:54:00] scriptures in the book of revelations
[1:54:02] it's our book
[1:54:04] it's close to the close to the minds of
[1:54:07] denominational systems around the world
[1:54:09] that have tried to open the book
[1:54:11] billy graham tried to open or roberts
[1:54:14] tried to open it
[1:54:14] many men tried to open it spurgeon
[1:54:18] actually had enough sense to say
[1:54:20] men leave this alone a prophet will come
[1:54:22] and reveal this
[1:54:24] warned all of these preachers don't fool
[1:54:26] with the book of revelations
[1:54:27] it is for a prophet to come and open up
[1:54:30] at least she had that much observation
[1:54:33] but let me just say this to you
[1:54:36] in the backdrop of all of that john was
[1:54:38] in the worst prison
[1:54:40] on the isle of patmos had been boiled at
[1:54:42] all
[1:54:44] it was known as the worst prison that
[1:54:46] there was
[1:54:47] and in the midst of all that backdrop
[1:54:50] he could write i was in the spirit of
[1:54:53] the lord's day
[1:54:55] i heard behind me a voice and i turned
[1:54:58] the scene
[1:55:01] and i fell in his feet it's dead his
[1:55:05] flesh was in prison
[1:55:09] but he was enjoying another room
[1:55:14] notice the scriptures and i see a new
[1:55:17] heaven
[1:55:18] and i see a new earth yet standing in
[1:55:21] prison
[1:55:24] oh i'm trying to behave i'm trying to
[1:55:26] behave
[1:55:28] there he may have been in a backdrop of
[1:55:30] the worst prison that there was
[1:55:32] not being fed well wasn't clothed well
[1:55:35] but god was giving him the greatest
[1:55:37] revelation
[1:55:38] ever given to man and god sends a
[1:55:46] prophet not out of the schools of
[1:55:48] humanity
[1:55:50] but his daddy's a bootlegger
[1:55:55] as a teenager brother branham would have
[1:55:57] been a murderer
[1:55:59] had the gun went off they had to change
[1:56:03] their name from
[1:56:04] uh six letters to seven letters
[1:56:08] because his daddy was on the run from
[1:56:09] the law
[1:56:12] so brother branham could not be proud so
[1:56:14] much of his mother and father and their
[1:56:15] earthly descendants
[1:56:17] but he met jesus
[1:56:29] neither was you
[1:56:34] neither was you i don't talk too much
[1:56:37] about the negative
[1:56:40] but it doesn't take long for you to
[1:56:42] search your family heritage
[1:56:45] to know you were a stinking rascal
[1:56:57] you were rotten you were this absolutely
[1:56:59] rotten roxy
[1:57:00] you were wrong
[1:57:06] ed hammer meister said he was a little
[1:57:08] boy listening to the brother harold
[1:57:10] sleeping sitting up against the wall but
[1:57:13] now
[1:57:14] operating as a pastor of the church god
[1:57:17] had a plan
[1:57:19] maybe even his family didn't believe it
[1:57:21] but god had a plan
[1:57:24] are you with me now god's got a plan for
[1:57:26] your life
[1:57:29] he's got a plan for your life
[1:57:36] what you may have thought was a mistake
[1:57:38] in your life god used it as a
[1:57:40] glory
[1:57:48] i'll never forget when i first met you
[1:57:52] sister connie should never forget that
[1:57:55] i'll never forget it satan whispered in
[1:57:58] my ear said she'll never believe this
[1:58:03] you talked about what a mess your life
[1:58:05] was remember that remember that
[1:58:07] conversation
[1:58:08] it's been a long time ago you're not
[1:58:11] even the same woman
[1:58:12] that's set back here you're not even
[1:58:16] that woman
[1:58:17] what happened jesus
[1:58:24] i could go all across this audience
[1:58:26] brother jim spent time with me telling
[1:58:28] me about his
[1:58:29] mom and their past the wrecks and moving
[1:58:33] this and moving there and moving here
[1:58:34] moving there moving here and moving
[1:58:36] there
[1:58:41] then he meet charlene
[1:58:44] is that an accident oh no oh no children
[1:58:48] had to be come forth
[1:58:49] you see in the lamb's book he knows
[1:58:51] you're coming
[1:58:55] you know there's things you can't
[1:58:56] understand but solomon had to come out
[1:58:58] of david
[1:58:59] and the sibo
[1:59:04] and against the backdrop of murdering a
[1:59:06] man
[1:59:07] solomon is born
[1:59:10] maybe you've even questioned your life
[1:59:12] and wanted to walk away
[1:59:14] if you could have
[1:59:19] reason things out
[1:59:26] how can i how can i
[1:59:31] possibly be his child
[1:59:34] just trust me
[1:59:39] you walked into a service
[1:59:44] you probably thought i'll never believe
[1:59:46] that and here you are
[1:59:48] decades later amen
[1:59:55] maybe you walked into this service today
[1:59:58] and you thought i'm just going to come
[1:59:59] through
[2:00:00] visit set through the service and think
[2:00:03] you know well this is just
[2:00:04] something i'll do to kind of see people
[2:00:06] or do this
[2:00:08] and you come and god speaks to your
[2:00:09] heart and he begins to explain
[2:00:12] and goes back through all the backdrop
[2:00:13] of your life
[2:00:15] and you look at the mistakes and you
[2:00:16] look at the failures and more than a
[2:00:18] preacher has discerned your heart
[2:00:20] and you sit and listen for about an hour
[2:00:23] and it wasn't a man
[2:00:24] it was god
[2:00:28] he can take care of your past and he's
[2:00:31] really interested in your future
[2:00:41] you see i'm not guessing now i'm on
[2:00:43] target
[2:00:45] and i'm taking my time it's kind of like
[2:00:48] sitting at the hospital waiting on a
[2:00:50] grandchild to be born
[2:00:52] you know it's coming you just don't know
[2:00:55] how long it's going to take
[2:00:59] and i'm preaching and watching god move
[2:01:05] and just waiting for the right time for
[2:01:07] you to get it
[2:01:16] is that all right is that all right
[2:01:19] sometimes our services are an hour hour
[2:01:21] and a half sometimes two hours sometimes
[2:01:23] two and a half hours
[2:01:25] who orchestrates the service he does
[2:01:34] you know sometimes we or even have the
[2:01:37] ability as humans to shake it off
[2:01:40] and go back out
[2:01:43] eat go back to our routine
[2:01:47] and then when we're preparing to lay
[2:01:50] down
[2:01:51] he begins to deal with us again amen
[2:01:54] you see he knows your future because you
[2:01:58] don't know you
[2:01:59] he knows your future
[2:02:15] while i'm waiting i want to share a
[2:02:17] story with you
[2:02:22] i was preaching in florida at a meeting
[2:02:26] and the lord woke me up and said go home
[2:02:28] today
[2:02:29] well my flight was tomorrow
[2:02:33] and so i called the airline
[2:02:36] and i told them my situation i needed to
[2:02:38] go home today
[2:02:41] i don't know who it was it must have
[2:02:42] been an angel on the other end of the
[2:02:43] line she said i've got you fixed up
