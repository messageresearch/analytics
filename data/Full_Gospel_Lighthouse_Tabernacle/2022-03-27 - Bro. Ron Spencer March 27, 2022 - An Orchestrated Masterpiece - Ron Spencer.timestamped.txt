[56:49] today i would like to look at
[56:52] an orchestrated masterpiece
[56:55] i just feel to share some things that's
[56:57] on my heart
[56:59] i'd like for us to go to isaiah chapter
[57:01] 53
[57:03] remembering that every prophet
[57:06] being a writer
[57:09] they would write the words of god as god
[57:11] would speak to them
[57:13] maybe some songwriters that are sitting
[57:15] in the building today that or even that
[57:18] will hear this
[57:20] you get us you get a song kind of like a
[57:22] preacher gets a sermon
[57:25] and you may just get a couple of words
[57:27] and then it will add from one word to
[57:29] another word
[57:31] it was a man one time and i'm sorry to
[57:33] pull it this way but there was a man one
[57:36] time that was
[57:38] and share what
[57:39] two different ways
[57:40] a man one time went to
[57:42] to nashville and he he was young he was
[57:46] he was
[57:46] just a skinny boy and
[57:49] he went into the producers and said i
[57:51] have a gift to be able to write songs
[57:53] and sing them
[57:55] and so he handed him a couple of songs
[57:57] and he said well
[57:58] here's a
[57:59] an empty paper if you're really gifted
[58:02] if there's here's an empty paper
[58:05] you you go outside and sit down
[58:08] at that chair and you write us a song
[58:10] and come back in just a few minutes
[58:12] and then we may believe in you
[58:15] he sat there for a little bit and he
[58:17] came back in about 15 minutes later
[58:22] there was a song there that became one
[58:23] of the top songs that was ever sung
[58:27] today i met you on the street my heart
[58:29] fell at your feet i can't help it but
[58:31] i'm still in love with you
[58:34] his name was hanker williams
[58:37] the song that you heard just a little
[58:39] bit ago
[58:44] was quite a writer
[58:47] and he lost it all
[58:50] in losing it all
[58:53] his family had went across the seas
[58:57] and he had had to stay back
[59:00] his entire family would would perish
[59:04] in the middle of the ocean
[59:09] you know not no doubt the devil
[59:11] whispered in his ears
[59:16] and so
[59:18] he chartered
[59:20] a ship
[59:23] and he got on that ship and he they took
[59:25] him to the place where that happened
[59:27] that wreck happened
[59:29] and he was standing there feeling really
[59:31] sorry for himself
[59:34] about all of his loss
[59:38] and he was leaning looking down into
[59:40] that water
[59:42] the words of it is well
[59:45] came to him
[59:48] so let me just say this to you whether
[59:50] it's cancer
[59:52] where there's very great difficulties
[59:55] it's well
[59:58] we're just hours before the rapture and
[1:00:00] we're believing we're getting ready to
[1:00:02] step over
[1:00:03] and no matter how
[1:00:05] dark that your world is
[1:00:08] there's sunshine
[1:00:10] coming down your way
[1:00:12] amen and we so love you today with all
[1:00:14] of our hearts
[1:00:16] now isaiah is quite a writer as well
[1:00:20] isaiah is going to
[1:00:22] write some scripture
[1:00:24] and he's going to tell us behold a
[1:00:26] virgin shall conceive
[1:00:28] now he would say the believers of that
[1:00:30] message and maybe the
[1:00:32] for hundreds of years they wondered why
[1:00:34] didn't it happen if he was a prophet
[1:00:37] but that word would circle for hundreds
[1:00:39] of years
[1:00:40] and then would be manifested on the
[1:00:42] earth
[1:00:44] one day you got under inspiration and
[1:00:46] these are more than just mere words
[1:00:49] but this is the power of god released
[1:00:53] isaiah chapter 53 and says it like this
[1:00:58] who hath believed our report
[1:01:02] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:01:04] revealed
[1:01:06] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:01:08] tender plant as a root out of dry ground
[1:01:10] and
[1:01:11] he hath no form nor calmliness and when
[1:01:13] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[1:01:15] we should desire him
[1:01:17] he is despised and rejected of men
[1:01:20] a man of sorrows
[1:01:22] acquainted with grief
[1:01:25] and we hid is it where our face is from
[1:01:27] him
[1:01:29] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:01:33] surely he hath borne out griefs and
[1:01:35] carried our sorrows
[1:01:37] yet we did esteem him smitten stricken
[1:01:40] and smitten of god and afflicted
[1:01:43] i love these scriptures
[1:01:46] i want us to read this next one together
[1:01:48] if we could
[1:01:49] but he was wounded for our
[1:01:51] transgressions
[1:01:53] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:01:56] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:02:00] him
[1:02:01] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:02:04] amen maybe you ever need your dr sherrod
[1:02:06] this evening just raise your hand before
[1:02:09] the lord
[1:02:10] almighty god
[1:02:12] we're a very needy people
[1:02:15] just moments ago i received a video from
[1:02:18] ukraine a church standing rejoicing
[1:02:24] special services going on there today
[1:02:28] father
[1:02:29] you're with them in an
[1:02:31] incredible
[1:02:32] storm and it just proves to us that your
[1:02:36] eye is on the sparrow and you're
[1:02:37] watching over our lives
[1:02:40] the god that is in ukraine is the same
[1:02:42] god that's here and around the world
[1:02:44] this morning
[1:02:45] angels have been dispatched to watch
[1:02:48] over us
[1:02:49] they're greater than any presidential
[1:02:52] guards that there could be
[1:02:54] but father we ask you now that
[1:02:56] you would come and
[1:02:58] touch our bodies and minister to us
[1:03:01] lord minister across this audience just
[1:03:03] now
[1:03:05] lord may there come a supercharge
[1:03:08] from the heavenlies down
[1:03:10] lord come by my way and touch my own
[1:03:13] body
[1:03:14] lord across this audience may it be a
[1:03:16] sweep of your presence now
[1:03:18] as the word is released and words have
[1:03:21] power words have inspiration words have
[1:03:24] strength dear god i ask you that you
[1:03:27] would anoint vocal cords and ears to
[1:03:29] hear
[1:03:30] and we give you all the glory in jesus
[1:03:33] christ's name we pray amen and amen you
[1:03:36] may be seated
[1:03:46] in revelations chapter 21
[1:03:50] and i saw a new heaven
[1:03:54] and a new earth
[1:03:57] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:03:59] were passed away
[1:04:02] and there was no more sea
[1:04:04] and i john saw the holy city the new
[1:04:07] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[1:04:09] heaven
[1:04:10] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:04:12] husband
[1:04:14] and i heard a great voice
[1:04:16] out of heaven saying
[1:04:18] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[1:04:22] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:04:24] shall be his people and god himself
[1:04:26] shall be with them and be their god
[1:04:29] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[1:04:32] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:04:34] death
[1:04:35] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:04:37] there be any more pain for the former
[1:04:40] things are passed away
[1:04:41] and he that set up on the throne
[1:04:44] said behold
[1:04:46] i make all things new
[1:04:49] and he said unto me right
[1:04:52] for these words
[1:04:54] are true
[1:04:56] and faithful
[1:04:58] these words have been written about 2
[1:05:00] 000 years now
[1:05:03] they were vision form god thought it
[1:05:06] then it became inspiration
[1:05:09] and john begin to write it and it's been
[1:05:12] read for about 2 000 years uttered
[1:05:15] across human lips
[1:05:17] but today i stand before
[1:05:21] the great orchestra that is preparing to
[1:05:24] step from this dimension to another
[1:05:26] dimension
[1:05:29] revelations 5 same writer
[1:05:32] same author
[1:05:34] and they sung a new song
[1:05:38] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:05:40] and to open the seals thereof
[1:05:43] for thou was slain has redeemed us
[1:05:46] to god
[1:05:48] by the blood of every out of every
[1:05:50] kindred tongue and people and nation and
[1:05:54] has made us unto our god kings and
[1:05:58] priests and we shall reign upon the
[1:06:02] earth
[1:06:04] isaiah chapter 60 and verse 1 arise and
[1:06:08] shine for thy light has come
[1:06:11] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[1:06:13] thee for behold darkness shall cover the
[1:06:16] earth and gross darkness the people but
[1:06:19] the lord shall arise upon thee and his
[1:06:23] glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:06:26] and the gentiles
[1:06:30] shall come
[1:06:32] to thy light
[1:06:35] and kings to the brightness of thy
[1:06:38] rising
[1:06:39] let me just back this up just for a
[1:06:41] moment with the scripture
[1:06:43] for a foundation
[1:06:44] in ii peter chapter 1 and verse 16 for
[1:06:48] we have not followed comingly
[1:06:51] devised fables
[1:06:53] but we have been made known unto you the
[1:06:55] power and the coming of the lord jesus
[1:06:58] christ
[1:06:59] but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:07:03] this is more than just some poetic
[1:07:05] justice we stood there and saw the glory
[1:07:09] of god
[1:07:10] we were in that holy mountain when moses
[1:07:13] and elijah appeared and we heard the
[1:07:16] voice of god
[1:07:19] we're more than just preachers
[1:07:21] we've met him
[1:07:30] verse 19
[1:07:31] we have also a more sure word of
[1:07:34] prophecy
[1:07:35] where unto you do well that you take
[1:07:38] heed as unto a light that shineth in a
[1:07:40] dark place
[1:07:42] until the day dawn
[1:07:44] and the day star arise in your hearts
[1:07:48] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:07:51] the scripture is of any private
[1:07:53] interpretation
[1:07:55] for the prophecy came not in old time by
[1:07:58] the will of man but holy men of god
[1:08:02] spake as they were moved by the holy
[1:08:08] ghost i'll just read some more if i if i
[1:08:11] can take it from the book of elijah if i
[1:08:13] can do this just now
[1:08:15] he said the church has not realized
[1:08:17] recognized her day
[1:08:20] like israel back in her promised land
[1:08:24] she she don't know how she got back
[1:08:26] there
[1:08:28] she was just automatically put back
[1:08:30] there
[1:08:32] why
[1:08:33] national force put her in her place
[1:08:37] and now i'm going to say something
[1:08:38] national force put israel in her
[1:08:41] homeland
[1:08:43] national force will put the church in
[1:08:45] the world council of churches
[1:08:49] but the power of god
[1:08:51] will put the people in the bride
[1:08:55] oh what a gathering
[1:08:59] the world forces this way and the world
[1:09:01] forces that way but god forces upward
[1:09:05] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:09:07] god my word is spirit and life we'll put
[1:09:11] the bride in her place
[1:09:14] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:09:16] the word
[1:09:17] then then she's in christ will put her
[1:09:21] in her place no national force will do
[1:09:25] that
[1:09:26] but the national force did drive israel
[1:09:30] to the homeland national forces will put
[1:09:34] the council of churches will drive every
[1:09:36] organization
[1:09:37] into it but the power of god
[1:09:42] the power of god
[1:09:45] will
[1:09:46] um we'll raise the bride into glory
[1:09:54] that's what we're under
[1:09:56] that's what we're experiencing
[1:10:08] about a year ago
[1:10:12] i was awakened with a vision
[1:10:14] wasn't a dream
[1:10:19] i was awakened with a vision
[1:10:22] and this vision was total darkness it
[1:10:24] looked like it was just right at evening
[1:10:26] time
[1:10:27] just like like it was so dark you could
[1:10:30] just barely see for those hunters that's
[1:10:32] one of the prime times
[1:10:34] for hunting and
[1:10:35] it's just right at dusk you just
[1:10:38] you can just barely see
[1:10:41] and i was standing in that darkness
[1:10:44] in front of a great big gates
[1:10:48] and i was standing i was preaching
[1:10:52] on the other side of the gate i saw
[1:10:54] brother tim pruitt
[1:10:56] working brother tim pruitt is preaching
[1:10:59] in louisiana today
[1:11:02] brother donnie is preaching in johnson
[1:11:04] city
[1:11:06] men around the world
[1:11:08] are standing at their pulpits
[1:11:10] proclaiming in the midst of this
[1:11:12] darkness
[1:11:15] under inspiration
[1:11:17] orchestrated by god himself
[1:11:21] this message is more than a man
[1:11:24] this was not william branham's message
[1:11:26] this was the lamb's message
[1:11:29] and we stand under the influence of that
[1:11:32] message and we scream to a lost and
[1:11:35] dying world
[1:11:40] and we're screaming into the darkness
[1:11:43] coming to the ark of safety before it's
[1:11:45] too late
[1:11:47] as we would gather one after another the
[1:11:50] gates would open
[1:11:53] and i heard the most beautiful singing
[1:11:56] i'd ever heard in my life
[1:11:59] and as it was just beyond that gate and
[1:12:02] the light was so bright
[1:12:04] and it seemed like the light was coming
[1:12:07] out of that gate like beams of
[1:12:10] beams of light
[1:12:12] shining
[1:12:14] and i looked at it and i i thought how
[1:12:16] glorious
[1:12:18] those beams of light is
[1:12:20] one by one people were stepping from
[1:12:23] that darkness into that glorious light
[1:12:27] and i thought of our job i thought of
[1:12:29] our situation our passion to preach the
[1:12:32] message
[1:12:36] you know some time ago our worship
[1:12:40] came under criticism
[1:12:44] songs would be taken from
[1:12:47] of the blood would be taken out of
[1:12:49] churches
[1:12:51] they wanted people not to rejoice well
[1:12:53] we wouldn't have none of that here
[1:12:57] i want you to understand this is a place
[1:13:01] it was trees on this hill
[1:13:03] this hill needed to be bulldozed this
[1:13:05] hill needed to be be arranged it hasn't
[1:13:08] always been like it is
[1:13:11] many of you men have worked incredible
[1:13:13] but this church was built to serve god
[1:13:17] this was built to be a lighthouse
[1:13:21] to shine in a dark world
[1:13:32] our worship
[1:13:34] is not to a man or to excite one another
[1:13:37] but our worship is to jesus christ
[1:13:43] birds
[1:13:44] worship horses
[1:13:47] animals
[1:13:48] scream out to the maker
[1:13:51] an eagle was brother kenny and
[1:13:54] sister rachel took pictures an eagle
[1:13:56] just right down the way here flew down
[1:13:59] over top of their car and we were coming
[1:14:01] by just as he had his camera and that
[1:14:04] eagle screamed down over top of our car
[1:14:07] and was making its way back up i i don't
[1:14:09] know if i've ever been quite that close
[1:14:11] to a wild eagle like that and i thought
[1:14:14] about this place as a white place that's
[1:14:16] welcome
[1:14:18] it's a welcome place for eagles
[1:14:22] when brother harold shifflett was
[1:14:24] was taken way too soon
[1:14:26] we were loading his body into the into
[1:14:29] the casket three eagles begin to fly
[1:14:32] around the front of our building here
[1:14:35] i i think god has a great way of how
[1:14:37] that he takes his children home
[1:14:57] brother brandon would stand and
[1:14:59] tell us about going beyond the curtain
[1:15:01] of time
[1:15:05] there wasn't nobody else talking like
[1:15:07] that
[1:15:09] excuse me
[1:15:13] this age has been shown every sign and
[1:15:15] we're not going to get another
[1:15:19] but
[1:15:20] brother branham
[1:15:21] he talked to us
[1:15:23] can you imagine how difficult
[1:15:26] knowing the criticism
[1:15:28] but he would walk to the pulpit
[1:15:31] and talk to us about the angel of the
[1:15:33] lord in the cave
[1:15:36] talk about the angel lord is here now
[1:15:41] and knowing there would be a collection
[1:15:43] of people that
[1:15:46] make all kind of fun of it call it
[1:15:48] everything in the world
[1:15:52] he would tell about the
[1:15:54] going beyond the curtain of time
[1:15:58] and experience beyond any mortal
[1:16:01] words
[1:16:03] and we found ourself in it when we
[1:16:05] screamed we're resting on that
[1:16:09] this is not the end this is this is only
[1:16:12] really the beginning
[1:16:14] where we'll step one day beyond that
[1:16:16] realm
[1:16:18] and many of our loved ones have stepped
[1:16:20] an experience in that now
[1:16:25] and he would stand in he
[1:16:26] and he would say it
[1:16:28] and he would say it with all honesty
[1:16:31] and then he would tell us whatever you
[1:16:33] do don't miss it
[1:16:35] talk about what an atmosphere that it is
[1:16:44] there was a story that was related in
[1:16:47] the
[1:16:49] in historical days
[1:16:52] moody would actually be one of the ones
[1:16:53] that would begin to tell the story
[1:16:56] about an armor
[1:16:58] and company's son
[1:17:02] of how that all the girls that was in
[1:17:04] the community there
[1:17:06] didn't fit the character that he was
[1:17:08] looking for
[1:17:10] a lot of girls a lot of pretty girls
[1:17:13] but he was looking for
[1:17:15] but he was sent
[1:17:17] he was sent west to to go to a ranch
[1:17:21] to look
[1:17:22] to see if he could find a wife
[1:17:26] and all the girls there
[1:17:28] dressed themselves up they planned to
[1:17:30] party
[1:17:31] they had live music
[1:17:34] and this boy as he began to
[1:17:37] as he began to watch the event
[1:17:40] what he was seeing was just like home
[1:17:44] and he was looking for something that
[1:17:46] was real not artificial
[1:17:49] or not put on
[1:17:51] he was looking for something real
[1:17:54] and so
[1:17:57] he excused himself
[1:18:00] the party went on
[1:18:02] the music went on
[1:18:04] and he was standing beside of the corral
[1:18:08] maybe having his foot up on the corral
[1:18:10] watching watching the night
[1:18:14] maybe looking at the stars
[1:18:16] and he hears the swish of water
[1:18:19] and there was a girl that was there that
[1:18:21] was throwing out the
[1:18:23] the water from washing the dishes
[1:18:26] barefoot
[1:18:28] she didn't have a beautiful dress and
[1:18:31] she wasn't all fancied up
[1:18:34] and he began to have a conversation with
[1:18:36] her
[1:18:39] and as he begins to have a conversation
[1:18:42] he finds that in her
[1:18:46] she was the reflection of what he was
[1:18:49] looking for
[1:18:53] orphan child
[1:18:58] but she was what he was looking for
[1:19:02] you how are what our lord jesus
[1:19:06] has been looking for
[1:19:08] since before the foundation of the world
[1:19:12] he knew where you would be
[1:19:14] he knew what condition that you would be
[1:19:17] in
[1:19:18] he was not ashamed of how he found many
[1:19:21] of you in trouble
[1:19:22] and in deep sins he would provide the
[1:19:25] blood that would wash away
[1:19:28] every stain of your life
[1:19:34] he would bring you peace
[1:19:37] he would bring you strength
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:43] it would be more than churchianity
[1:19:46] it would be more than signing a book or
[1:19:49] shaking a preacher's hand
[1:19:51] or turning over a new leaf
[1:19:54] but he would give his own life to live
[1:19:57] on the inside of you
[1:20:00] for you see he would deposit something
[1:20:02] on the inside of you that you were
[1:20:05] looking for all your life
[1:20:08] and in that moment it just clicked and
[1:20:11] you came to life
[1:20:14] and in that moment you would never be
[1:20:16] the same
[1:20:30] he sealed his
[1:20:32] conversation
[1:20:34] and his promise
[1:20:37] with the kiss
[1:20:45] she had to go back
[1:20:47] to cleaning dishes
[1:20:53] now i want to just pull some things
[1:20:54] together here
[1:20:58] to those other girls
[1:21:01] it was just like

[1:23:41] i saw a new heaven
[1:23:44] and i saw a new earth
[1:23:47] that's what we're built for
[1:23:52] in this dream i saw brother branham we
[1:23:54] were sitting kind of like you are now
[1:23:56] and i was sitting quite on the edge
[1:23:59] and brother branham was speaking
[1:24:04] he was young
[1:24:06] he had on the most beautiful suit i'd
[1:24:07] ever seen it was a it was a fabric like
[1:24:10] i'm i've not ever seen here
[1:24:13] and he was i was kind of enamored with
[1:24:15] that i
[1:24:16] i liked that
[1:24:18] and he was kind of speaking
[1:24:20] he was telling kind of telling stories
[1:24:23] kind of almost in the same
[1:24:26] vein of talking like i am now and he was
[1:24:28] just kind of going
[1:24:30] and he came toward the end of the sermon
[1:24:32] and
[1:24:33] and he turned
[1:24:35] and he walks right straight to me i was
[1:24:37] sitting about where that
[1:24:40] that speaker would be
[1:24:42] and we were sitting on the line connie
[1:24:43] was sitting beside of me
[1:24:45] and the boys were sitting there william
[1:24:47] was sitting with us
[1:24:49] and he just walked right straight to me
[1:24:51] and he just kind of come right right to
[1:24:52] me
[1:24:54] and he handed me a book he said
[1:24:56] would you like to have the book that
[1:24:58] i've used tonight
[1:25:00] and it was the way of a true prophet
[1:25:03] and i told him i said brother branham
[1:25:06] i believe this message
[1:25:09] with all my heart
[1:25:12] and i preach it with everything
[1:25:14] that is within me
[1:25:21] and he just patted me on the cheek
[1:25:24] he just patted me on the cheek and he
[1:25:26] said you're gonna get well ron
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:42] now
[1:25:43] these are just seasons of inspiration
[1:25:45] that i'm just dropping to you
[1:25:53] brother branham would preach a
[1:25:55] sing a song
[1:25:57] at the end of
[1:26:00] snow white dove
[1:26:03] and as he would sing it
[1:26:05] he would come to the last verse and then
[1:26:08] he would make up a verse
[1:26:11] now that verse was his life
[1:26:16] though i have suffered in many ways
[1:26:20] i cried for healing both night and day
[1:26:24] now maybe in your life
[1:26:27] you went down a lot of very difficult
[1:26:31] very difficult situations
[1:26:36] but god knew before he released you into
[1:26:39] the earth
[1:26:41] the difficulty that you would have to go
[1:26:43] through
[1:26:46] knowing the things that you would have
[1:26:48] to go through he
[1:26:50] he he prepared for your coming
[1:26:55] and i want you to understand never feel
[1:26:57] like you're ever alone
[1:26:59] god's with you
[1:27:02] he's made some promises to you i'll
[1:27:04] never leave you i'll never forsake you
[1:27:07] i'll be with you to the very end
[1:27:10] and you may feel like you're at the
[1:27:11] bottom of your bell
[1:27:13] you may feel like that you've just
[1:27:15] turned your drink over you may feel like
[1:27:18] the world is upside down
[1:27:22] put it on the wrong side i can't see
[1:27:23] that side
[1:27:26] but i understand this
[1:27:29] god knowed before
[1:27:33] even your arrival
[1:27:35] all of your valleys
[1:27:37] all of your hurts
[1:27:39] all of your sorrows all of the things
[1:27:42] that you would go through
[1:27:43] he knew it all
[1:27:46] and yet he prepared for your arrival he
[1:27:49] prepared for the strength that you would
[1:27:52] need to get through it
[1:28:05] just as any great orchestra would be
[1:28:09] any great orchestra there's
[1:28:12] there's an elected people that comes
[1:28:17] understand when the national convention
[1:28:19] or the national orchestra is played
[1:28:22] not just anybody gets to show up
[1:28:27] and play
[1:28:29] it's just not to just anybody
[1:28:33] it's to a select group of people
[1:28:37] and just when the devil whispers in your
[1:28:39] ear remind him this
[1:28:42] i didn't put myself here
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:48] i can't even keep myself here
[1:28:51] but god that is rich in mercy
[1:28:56] place something on the inside of me that
[1:28:59] allows me to be a part of this great
[1:29:03] orchestra
[1:29:12] my life is playing the music
[1:29:17] my life
[1:29:19] my time period
[1:29:21] is playing whoa it's playing scripture
[1:29:27] it's playing a song
[1:29:29] you may not hear it but the angels stand
[1:29:33] in awe
[1:29:34] of your life
[1:29:37] [Applause]
[1:29:47] i understand
[1:29:49] not everybody can play the trumpet
[1:29:54] not everybody can play the drum
[1:29:57] not everybody can play the piano
[1:30:00] but everybody's got a part
[1:30:07] now don't you worry about casting people
[1:30:09] out of the orchestra
[1:30:12] god knows who he invited
[1:30:19] and quit looking at yourself as some
[1:30:21] feeble member
[1:30:25] there's no big eyes and little views
[1:30:28] god don't have a bunch of stars that he
[1:30:30] brings together where everybody
[1:30:33] stands and barrels
[1:30:37] everybody's apart
[1:30:38] and complementary to one another
[1:30:42] we're not feeding on personalities here
[1:30:45] we're feeding on the body word of the
[1:30:47] son of man
[1:30:48] our whole ambition is that our life
[1:30:53] plays the sheep music
[1:30:55] perfectly
[1:31:07] when we can get past that i'm the
[1:31:09] important one
[1:31:14] when we can get past it's all about me
[1:31:22] and realize it's only all about the
[1:31:24] music
[1:31:32] the reason that you see people that
[1:31:34] think that they're so important they
[1:31:35] really haven't been born again yet
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:40] the reason that people can't get beyond
[1:31:42] themselves is they haven't met christ
[1:31:46] the reason that people
[1:31:48] shun the holy ghost and the experience
[1:31:51] of god living in her life
[1:31:53] is because they've never met him
[1:31:56] and if can you can you i heard andrew
[1:31:59] speaking last night
[1:32:01] try to explain
[1:32:03] the burning bush experience
[1:32:08] you can't
[1:32:10] try to explain the electricity in a cave
[1:32:15] with an angel of god
[1:32:19] and every time he comes it almost takes
[1:32:21] your life
[1:32:24] knowing as you're telling the story
[1:32:27] he's only standing a few feet away
[1:32:41] now some of you were delivered the the
[1:32:43] sheep music
[1:32:45] and you got it
[1:32:48] when you first started playing
[1:32:51] nobody likes to be around
[1:32:53] the one that first starts
[1:33:01] maybe it's a banjo
[1:33:08] it's the most obnoxious thing in the
[1:33:10] entire world
[1:33:15] sister cassie played in a lot of special
[1:33:17] concerts
[1:33:20] she married
[1:33:24] a redneck
[1:33:31] she was still in college and she was
[1:33:33] preparing to play in a lot of special
[1:33:35] places and play in the music
[1:33:38] and she said she was playing one day and
[1:33:40] she looked
[1:33:41] she looked across
[1:33:43] the room and there was matthew
[1:33:46] and he had a recording
[1:33:48] of a turkey call
[1:33:52] and he would listen to the turkey call
[1:33:54] and he cut it off and he'd try to do it
[1:33:58] and he listened and
[1:33:59] she's playing bach in one room
[1:34:05] and turkey call is going on in the other
[1:34:07] room
[1:34:08] don't try to explain god
[1:34:14] don't try to explain god
[1:34:17] god knows how to put all of these things
[1:34:19] together
[1:34:22] and he's got him coming from australia
[1:34:24] and from south america and he's got him
[1:34:27] coming from all over the world
[1:34:29] every nation
[1:34:33] every nation under her banner is
[1:34:36] stepping forward
[1:34:44] hallelujah
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:50] brother brown saw one just kind of
[1:34:52] stepping out of line a little bit and he
[1:34:54] screamed stay alive
[1:34:57] stay in line
[1:35:01] and if you hear us preaching and all of
[1:35:02] a sudden it comes to your address
[1:35:05] listen thank god for that
[1:35:08] because that is the
[1:35:10] that is the conductor screaming to you
[1:35:13] sailing
[1:35:23] but brother ron i've struggled he knows
[1:35:25] your struggle
[1:35:28] he didn't tell you away
[1:35:33] he knows your
[1:35:35] your insecurities and your complexes
[1:35:38] he knows your private situations
[1:35:43] he knows the things that dominate your
[1:35:45] life
[1:35:47] yet you keep reading

[1:35:55] psalms 23 you just kept reading and you
[1:35:58] read the word and you apply the word and
[1:36:00] you read the word and the token is
[1:36:02] applied and the life that's in the word
[1:36:05] lives now on the inside of you
[1:36:08] and now you just breathe
[1:36:11] it's no longer trying to do it you just
[1:36:14] breathe
[1:36:33] now
[1:36:38] so we're going to have a massive concert
[1:36:45] we'll just call it reunion day
[1:36:49] could we just do that let's just call it
[1:36:51] you know for lack of a better word let's
[1:36:54] call it reunion day
[1:36:56] you know that's kind of where
[1:36:59] you get everybody together
[1:37:03] you don't just get the ones that are
[1:37:05] here together
[1:37:08] but you get those that are
[1:37:10] that died in faith
[1:37:13] they come together
[1:37:17] i mean the message is there
[1:37:20] we've had a prophet
[1:37:23] you know and everybody's doing their
[1:37:25] place in the world
[1:37:26] they come together and there comes a
[1:37:28] time
[1:37:29] you know there's a certain time that's
[1:37:31] set
[1:37:32] now don't you worry about time you
[1:37:34] you'll be there
[1:37:35] don't you worry sometimes you get in a
[1:37:38] hurry but it ain't time yet
[1:37:41] are you with me and it's not way out
[1:37:42] yonder but now it's getting real close
[1:37:48] and so
[1:37:50] it's time to start bringing people into
[1:37:52] their spot
[1:37:53] now remember
[1:37:56] now remember this
[1:37:58] the world's gonna get to be a spectator
[1:38:04] are you with me now
[1:38:05] now
[1:38:07] i've always marveled at people that come
[1:38:09] to a place like that
[1:38:11] i i had a reason for wearing a bow tie
[1:38:16] those kind of concerts are they're
[1:38:18] dress-up concerts
[1:38:21] you don't wear your hog pins attire
[1:38:25] you know you wear your your very best
[1:38:29] now you know and and you have a seat
[1:38:31] number
[1:38:33] and and and you go and you're sitting
[1:38:35] there
[1:38:37] and if you've got an appreciation for
[1:38:39] orchestra
[1:38:41] you're going and you're sitting in the
[1:38:43] seat
[1:38:45] you know there's not a word that says
[1:38:46] turn off your cell phone
[1:38:51] it's not a word
[1:38:52] quit watching movies while the service
[1:38:54] is going on
[1:38:58] nothing that says that your sports team
[1:39:00] that
[1:39:01] it's going to work out
[1:39:04] but you sit there in full attendance
[1:39:06] you're ready
[1:39:09] because you know that the greatest
[1:39:11] orchestra that's ever been played
[1:39:13] is now getting ready to play
[1:39:16] now some of those people have came from
[1:39:18] australia
[1:39:20] and some of them have came from south
[1:39:22] america and some of them came from
[1:39:24] tennessee and some from arkansas
[1:39:28] and louisiana
[1:39:30] and even us from virginia
[1:39:33] will come to take our place
[1:39:36] it won't be about what size home we have
[1:39:38] what kind of car that we drive
[1:39:41] the difficulties that we've been through
[1:39:43] over the last weeks
[1:39:45] all of that will be hidden
[1:39:49] are you with me it's kind of like
[1:39:51] charleston heston getting ready to play
[1:39:53] moses
[1:39:54] they're not going to tell us how many
[1:39:55] wives that he's had and how many
[1:39:57] children and grandchildren and all of
[1:39:58] this is going to be in his life and how
[1:40:00] rich he is or where he lives at
[1:40:03] all you're going to see is
[1:40:06] moses it's not about our trouble help me
[1:40:09] preach
[1:40:10] it's not about what we're going through
[1:40:12] in our life
[1:40:14] this is not about cancer
[1:40:17] my life is not defined by cancer
[1:40:21] it's not been defined by by fire or
[1:40:24] fallen off of a house it's not defined
[1:40:27] by that it's defined by the sheep music
[1:40:34] that i've been able to be a part of
[1:40:40] when i realized my life is more
[1:40:43] than my humanity
[1:40:47] my weaknesses and my failures
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:55] god wants to borrow a body
[1:40:58] that he can play a message through
[1:41:13] so when i take my place
[1:41:16] i'm not trying to outdo anybody else
[1:41:26] setting amongst millions
[1:41:28] i'm not trying to be better than anybody
[1:41:30] else
[1:41:35] the sheet music that is laid before me
[1:41:40] i don't even get the option
[1:41:43] of trying to play it like i want to play
[1:41:47] it
[1:41:55] the composer
[1:41:57] heard it a certain way
[1:42:01] and no doubt he throwed away a lot of
[1:42:03] paper but one day
[1:42:06] he created a masterpiece
[1:42:11] when you hear beethoven you don't hear
[1:42:12] his sorrow
[1:42:14] how he lost his hearing
[1:42:16] and he became isolated from the world
[1:42:20] this may this may be a shock to you
[1:42:25] but i'm one guy
[1:42:26] that loves classical music
[1:42:29] probably the biggest redneck preacher in
[1:42:31] the message
[1:42:33] and here i love classical music
[1:42:41] you probably love things that i don't
[1:42:42] love
[1:42:44] but god built me that way
[1:42:48] he built me that way
[1:42:50] sister connie and i sometimes just
[1:42:52] prepare we're preparing for bed and
[1:42:54] we're about an hour before going to bed
[1:42:56] and i'll just start playing her music
[1:43:01] and she'll just sit over in the other
[1:43:04] other thing looking at recipes
[1:43:09] and ron's playing her love songs
[1:43:12] and classical music
[1:43:15] and i remind her you want this music to
[1:43:17] keep playing
[1:43:20] because the day the music stops in this
[1:43:22] house gonna be tears
[1:43:31] so sometimes we need to appreciate the
[1:43:32] music while
[1:43:34] it's playing
[1:43:42] i preach in my heart
[1:43:45] i don't know any other way
[1:43:47] but i pray for my heart
[1:43:53] and the reason i want to go here
[1:43:56] is i'm afraid too many people walk in
[1:43:59] to services like this
[1:44:14] and they keep asking themselves the same
[1:44:16] question why am i here with an attitude
[1:44:26] you say brother ron but that's way out
[1:44:28] of line
[1:44:29] because i picked up on your spirit
[1:44:32] and i want to tell you don't bypass your
[1:44:35] day of grace
[1:44:39] people in hell would love to have your
[1:44:41] pew
[1:44:43] they were millionaires and billionaires
[1:44:45] and they were hollywood stars and they
[1:44:48] were great people in life but they
[1:44:50] didn't have time for jesus
[1:44:53] but god gave you time for jesus don't
[1:44:56] let your seat
[1:45:09] i don't have time for it explain that in
[1:45:12] hell
[1:45:16] why you didn't have time to read the
[1:45:18] shoot see sheet music
[1:45:21] why you didn't have time to surrender
[1:45:23] your life
[1:45:24] to be a part of the greatest orchestra
[1:45:26] that's ever been assembled
[1:45:30] just because you're talented just
[1:45:32] because you can you can do great things
[1:45:35] in life
[1:45:36] don't mean you're committed
[1:45:43] how many people go through
[1:45:45] college
[1:45:48] and waste four and five years and
[1:45:50] hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1:45:58] how many doctors wait on patients they
[1:46:01] really hate their job
[1:46:05] how many people that get into an
[1:46:07] airplane
[1:46:08] and want to become an astronaut but
[1:46:10] there's only just a handful about 10
[1:46:13] a year is selected for the program
[1:46:18] a lot of people go to church
[1:46:23] but not everybody gets to play in the
[1:46:25] orchestra
[1:46:41] i'm not going to get done so i'm just
[1:46:42] going to finish it like this
[1:46:46] i'll tell you
[1:46:48] i throw the dishwater out
[1:46:55] i know this don't mean nothing to you
[1:46:56] but
[1:46:57] i throwed the dishwater out
[1:47:00] and i heard his voice
[1:47:02] he caught my attention
[1:47:04] and he talked to me
[1:47:09] i'll tell you
[1:47:11] i'm just gonna be honest with you i may
[1:47:13] be like joseph but i'm gonna be honest
[1:47:15] with you
[1:47:16] he told me that he didn't want women
[1:47:18] like you
[1:47:25] but he asked me
[1:47:26] would i be his wife
[1:47:32] and he told me in about a year
[1:47:35] he's going to come back for us
[1:47:39] he told me a year from now
[1:47:42] abraham you're going to have a baby
[1:47:44] he told me a year from now tim pruitt
[1:47:46] you're going to have a baby that you can
[1:47:48] hold in your arms
[1:47:52] if you knew what i knew
[1:48:01] i could hear those girls go
[1:48:03] she is so silly
[1:48:05] isn't she so vain
[1:48:08] that she thinks that the owner
[1:48:10] himself
[1:48:12] come here
[1:48:13] and he picked her
[1:48:22] i need some eggs
[1:48:25] i need some eggs and and i need you to
[1:48:27] i need you to make up my room
[1:48:30] okay i'll do it i'll do the best that i
[1:48:32] know how to do
[1:48:34] and she just kept working
[1:48:37] and they did their year they did their
[1:48:39] whirly-ism
[1:48:40] they went to their parties
[1:48:42] they went to their nonsense
[1:48:45] they didn't have time for church
[1:48:56] she sat there
[1:48:57] she watched them
[1:49:00] but you you see she was the only one
[1:49:02] with promise
[1:49:06] you know there will be churches churches
[1:49:08] and
[1:49:10] there will be bride's brides
[1:49:13] but you're the only one
[1:49:15] with promise
[1:49:20] you can make fun if you want to
[1:49:22] you cast aside if you want to
[1:49:25] or you can get on the ark
[1:49:30] you know when it came down and let me
[1:49:31] just let me just finish for you for the
[1:49:34] strength of my body

[1:49:50] she was getting a dress ready and you
[1:49:52] know what when she put on the message of
[1:49:54] the hour
[1:49:58] it fit
[1:50:09] she didn't have to pull out a part and
[1:50:11] pull out a part and pull out a part
[1:50:13] and she didn't say this is for them or
[1:50:15] this is for that or this is somebody
[1:50:17] else's thought we need to rewrite the
[1:50:19] bible she didn't have to go all through
[1:50:21] that she just said i put it on i've eat
[1:50:24] the book
[1:50:25] and it lives
[1:50:27] [Music]
