[43:40] to produce the same works that jesus did
[43:44] acts chapter 1 and verse 4
[43:48] and being assembled together with them
[43:50] commanded them that they
[43:51] should not depart from jerusalem but
[43:54] wait
[43:54] for the promise of the father which
[43:56] saith
[43:58] he ye have heard of me for john truly
[44:02] baptized with water
[44:03] but you shall be baptized with the holy
[44:05] ghost not many days hence
[44:08] verse 8 but you shall receive power

[44:13] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[44:15] both

[44:19] samaria and under the uttermost part of
[44:22] the earth
[44:23] acts chapter 2 and verse 1.
[44:32] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[44:34] come
[44:35] they were all with one accord in one
[44:37] place and suddenly there came a sound
[44:39] from heaven
[44:40] as of a russian mighty wind and it
[44:42] filled all the house where they were
[44:44] sitting
[44:45] and there appeared under them cloven
[44:47] tongues like as a fire
[44:49] and it set upon each of them and they
[44:52] were all filled with the holy ghost
[44:54] and began to speak with other tongues as
[44:57] the spirit gave utterance
[44:59] and there were dwelling at jerusalem but
[45:01] devout men
[45:02] out of every nation under heaven
[45:06] now when this was noised abroad the
[45:08] multitude came together and were
[45:10] confounded
[45:11] because that every man heard them speak
[45:14] in his own language and they were all
[45:17] amazed
[45:18] and marveled saying one to another
[45:19] behold are not all these which speak
[45:23] galileans and how here we every man in
[45:26] our own tongue wherein
[45:28] were we born parthians and medies and
[45:31] elohimites and the dwellers of
[45:32] mesopotamia and judea
[45:34] and cappadocia and politics and asia
[45:38] for gaia and paphilia and egypt and the
[45:41] parts of libya
[45:42] about syrian and strangers of rome jews
[45:45] and proselytes
[45:47] cretes and arabians we do hear them
[45:50] speak in our own tongues
[45:51] the wonderful works of god and they were
[45:54] all amazed and were in doubt saying one
[45:57] to another
[45:57] what meaneth this others mocking said
[46:01] these men are full of new wine but
[46:04] peter standing up with the eleven lifted
[46:07] up his voice
[46:08] and said unto them ye men of judea and
[46:11] all ye that dwell at jerusalem
[46:13] be this known unto you and hearken to my
[46:16] words
[46:17] for these are not drunk as you suppose
[46:20] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[46:23] day
[46:24] but this is that which was spoken by the
[46:27] prophet
[46:28] joel and it shall come to pass in the
[46:30] last days saith my
[46:32] saith god that i will pour out my spirit
[46:35] upon all flesh
[46:36] and your sons and your daughters shall
[46:38] prophesy
[46:39] and your young men shall see visions and
[46:41] your old men
[46:42] shall dream dreams and on my servants
[46:46] and on my handmaidens i will pour out
[46:49] on in those days of my spirit
[46:52] and they shall prophesy let us go to the
[46:56] author of the word this evening
[46:58] making known our request and our
[47:00] petitions for we are a needy people but
[47:03] he is the god that supplies all of our
[47:05] needs
[47:05] let's just call on the god of heaven in
[47:07] one word and one accord just now
[47:10] father god we have come before you
[47:12] tonight lord as we humble ourselves
[47:15] under the presence of the most high god
[47:17] realizing father that thou art here
[47:20] because your word spoke it
[47:22] and we believe it father that two or
[47:24] three are gathered in your name there
[47:26] you would be in the midst of them
[47:27] and father we agree father to us now
[47:30] that you're going to
[47:31] do mighty things amongst us and i ask
[47:34] father that as the spirit would go forth
[47:37] just
[47:38] now and give utterance to the things
[47:39] that that are desired to be said
[47:42] lord you know those things before there
[47:44] ever spoke it and we pray that you would
[47:46] control our tongue
[47:47] to the things that you'd want once said
[47:49] and open our tongue to the things that
[47:51] you do father
[47:52] we ask father that you would meet the
[47:54] needs of your people
[47:56] those that have needs in their body we
[47:58] pray that you will present yourself to
[48:00] them
[48:01] as the great physician and i ask father
[48:03] that you would be mindful of every
[48:05] person
[48:06] on this on the way of the internet just
[48:08] now that you would minister them
[48:10] abundantly lord we pray god that you
[48:13] would come and pour out your spirit upon
[48:15] us afresh
[48:16] i know that there are those here that
[48:18] are desiring
[48:20] a fresh pentecostal experience
[48:23] and i asked father that they would
[48:25] experience the god of heaven
[48:27] more than a man and more than a church
[48:29] service but may the holy ghost
[48:32] birth them anew into the kingdom just
[48:34] now i pray father that you would make
[48:36] yourself known
[48:37] in this service in a mighty way in the
[48:40] name of jesus christ and the church says
[48:44] amen and the church said amen you may be
[48:48] seated in the presence of the lord i
[48:50] would like to speak to you tonight
[48:52] on the only kind that the word can
[48:56] bring forth the only kind that the word
[48:58] can bring forth and we know that if we
[49:00] would begin to look over
[49:02] in the book of genesis that we would see
[49:04] that that is the seed chapter
[49:06] in which we would be able to read and we
[49:08] won't take time for
[49:10] for time's sake to go through those
[49:11] things but we look through there in the
[49:13] first
[49:14] three chapters and we see that that god
[49:17] was bringing forth out of the
[49:19] out of the dust of the earth and we see
[49:21] that god would bring forth and the bible
[49:23] said let them bring forth
[49:25] of their own kind and we realize that
[49:28] god
[49:28] is in the business of producing sons
[49:32] of god and we look here and we see
[49:35] something quite amazing
[49:37] if you begin to look at the text you'll
[49:39] see that there's a hundred and twenty
[49:41] empty vessels
[49:42] that have gathered themselves in an
[49:44] upper room wherein
[49:46] and they're there in one accord but we
[49:48] we know that if we're very knowledgeable
[49:50] on the scriptures
[49:52] that the bible tells us over in the book
[49:54] of corinthians that there
[49:55] was seen of him of 500 at one time
[49:59] but yet god was not surprised that 380
[50:03] of them were missing
[50:04] and did not make it up into the upper
[50:06] room because
[50:07] god knows all things and god knew who
[50:10] would be there and even the
[50:12] mary the mother of jesus christ had to
[50:15] be there because you see
[50:17] it had to be more than just carrying
[50:19] jesus in the womb
[50:21] it has to be jesus on the heart and we
[50:24] realize that the
[50:26] the the word can only bring forth of
[50:29] its kind and we know that there has been
[50:32] a promise that has been hanging over
[50:34] the children of god throughout the ages
[50:37] throughout throughout the the old
[50:39] testament you can see
[50:40] that there were promises that were
[50:42] hanging over the children in the days of
[50:44] abraham
[50:45] it was the promise or it was the time
[50:48] for the promised son of isaac to come
[50:50] forth
[50:50] in the days of jacob it was a time for
[50:53] joseph to rise to his position
[50:55] and his brother's bow before him but it
[50:58] had to come to a spot when faith
[51:00] would be arise or awaken to see that
[51:03] this was the time
[51:05] of visitation that god was coming to
[51:08] deal with his seed upon the earth at
[51:10] that time
[51:11] at that season and god does things in
[51:14] uncertain times and in uncertain ways
[51:17] but we understand that god is perfect in
[51:20] his timing
[51:21] and we get caught up in the delay a lot
[51:24] of times as human beings we get caught
[51:26] up thinking
[51:26] well god needs to do this or we need to
[51:28] see god do that
[51:30] or we need to move but god is perfect
[51:33] in his timing and in the deity of jesus
[51:37] he said the only thing you have to do
[51:39] when you see something in the bible
[51:41] that sounds just a little mystic and a
[51:43] little superstitious to you
[51:45] is just give god a little bit of time
[51:48] god's in no hurry we're the one that
[51:50] gets in a hurry
[51:51] just give god a little bit of time and
[51:53] you'll see the old prophetic wheels
[51:56] of cods run right up into the picture
[51:58] it'll develop
[51:59] just like bringing up out of a picture
[52:03] and again god's word must every time be
[52:06] fulfilled
[52:07] the cogs of god's prophecy grind slow
[52:11] but sure they grind slow
[52:14] but sure and if the vision is for an
[52:18] appointed time
[52:19] it will come to pass in the season in
[52:22] which
[52:22] god has destined it to come forth we
[52:25] know that it's a time to sow
[52:27] a time to plant and a time to harvest
[52:30] there is a time
[52:31] in which god is going to bring forth
[52:34] and we notice that it's just about the
[52:36] time that when joseph
[52:39] sends the gentile bride to the palace
[52:42] so that he can show himself as the son
[52:45] of righteousness
[52:46] as the son of prosperity to show himself
[52:50] to his brethren that the time of
[52:52] fulfillment
[52:54] is at at hand and the time is now
[52:57] for the gentile bride to move forward in
[53:00] the promises
[53:01] that god has laid out before her this is
[53:04] not a time to move back
[53:06] but it is the time to press the battle
[53:09] that
[53:09] was the voice that was heard from the
[53:11] other side
[53:12] when the prophet came back into this
[53:14] dimension he heard the voice saying
[53:17] press the battle press the battle
[53:20] press the battle and as the gentile
[53:22] bride of jesus christ
[53:24] it is the time not to give up it's a
[53:27] time to stand
[53:28] sure on the promises of god for this
[53:32] is the sure word of prophecy
[53:35] you're not going to help figure out god
[53:37] you're not going to out reason god
[53:39] you're not going to out figure god
[53:41] but this is a time to be quickened under
[53:44] the promises
[53:46] and if there is something that is going
[53:48] to bring forth then something
[53:50] has got to be pregnant before
[53:54] something can ever come out of the womb
[53:56] there's got to be a seed that is
[53:58] deposited
[53:59] and the prophet said that before the
[54:02] foundation of the world
[54:03] he knew you he saw you
[54:06] he called you by name he elected you he
[54:09] chose you
[54:10] he predestined you and he deposited
[54:13] that gene seed of god
[54:16] [Applause]
[54:18] god knows who his bride is god knows
[54:21] where she's at
[54:22] you can search the world over you can
[54:25] try to find it yourself
[54:26] but god sees her god knows her
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:31] this message will produce message people
[54:35] this message will produce miracles
[54:37] believing people
[54:39] because there is a people that believe
[54:42] that
[54:42] bible days are here again
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:47] hallelujah and christ is a mystery he
[54:50] said then all of our actions should
[54:52] declare him
[54:53] we have his name is that right we should
[54:55] bear his name
[54:57] and remember we are now as his bride
[54:59] pregnant
[55:00] with his spirit oh my the church bearing
[55:03] children see
[55:04] impregnated by his spirit with his name
[55:07] bearing his name bearing his life
[55:09] bringing forth the signs of life evident
[55:11] with the preeminences
[55:13] evidence of his resurrection showing
[55:16] that he is not dead but alive
[55:19] forevermore
[55:20] this is eternal life and vindicated
[55:23] vindicates to the world that we
[55:25] are alive in him how do you know
[55:28] because you're a church member no
[55:31] because
[55:31] christ is living through you so pregnant
[55:34] with his spirit that you're a prisoner
[55:37] to anything else
[55:38] you're confined oh my to the gospel
[55:41] confined to the word
[55:42] and all the children that you can bring
[55:44] forth as that because you're
[55:46] a prisoner you cannot commit adultery
[55:50] you're already pregnated glory he can't
[55:53] take hold
[55:55] the womb of life is closed to anything
[55:58] else
[55:59] you're already his by predestination
[56:02] that seed has come to life and no world
[56:05] can get in you see he has healed you
[56:09] until the day of redemption
[56:14] nothing can get in and nothing can get
[56:16] out
[56:17] what a testimony tonight that if the
[56:20] holy ghost has so sealed you
[56:22] you can't sin away your day of grace you
[56:24] can't
[56:25] make god mad and leave god ain't having
[56:28] a bad day
[56:29] god ain't having a bad hair day god
[56:31] ain't upset at you
[56:32] you're sealed
[56:36] you're filled with his spirit he
[56:38] deposited that seed
[56:40] and you're pregnant you're impregnated
[56:44] with a spirit
[56:45] no world can get in there no cosmos can
[56:48] get in there
[56:49] no laodicea can get in there no
[56:52] cancerous cell can get in there
[56:56] oh hallelujah you see god is not willing
[56:59] that your womb
[57:00] would be contaminated with the king of
[57:03] egypt
[57:06] he's not willing that your womb would be
[57:08] contaminated
[57:09] with serpent seed and you would carry
[57:11] about the reasoning and the ideology
[57:13] of humanity in this hour
[57:17] but he is watching over that seed and
[57:20] he's watching over that womb to make
[57:22] sure that nothing comes by
[57:24] and contaminates it
[57:32] he is watching over that seat
[57:35] to make sure that it gets to its final
[57:39] resting spot and we realize that the
[57:42] battle of the day and the battle
[57:44] throughout the ages has always been that
[57:47] of wisdom versus faith and we realize
[57:50] that it's two
[57:51] sources that were introduced in the
[57:53] beginning and they're being introduced
[57:55] again
[57:55] in this day it's wisdom versus faith and
[57:59] it's always a battle that we're there
[58:01] and we understand
[58:02] and we find out that god is the author
[58:05] of faith
[58:05] to believe for the people to believe and
[58:08] to trust his word
[58:09] and satan is the author of wisdom and
[58:12] he's trying to get the people to accept
[58:15] his wisdom
[58:16] and pull them away from the faith that's
[58:18] in god's word
[58:20] you see every time satan comes in and
[58:22] offers you education
[58:24] it's to steal away your knowledge of
[58:27] faith in the lord jesus
[58:29] it's not that we're against education
[58:32] it's not that we are against higher
[58:33] knowledge
[58:34] but there are two things that are an
[58:36] enemy to god and that's time
[58:38] and science and the very thing that
[58:41] started this whole mess that we're in
[58:43] this whole sin this whole system that
[58:46] we're in
[58:47] it was because satan produced a better
[58:50] plan or wanted to produce
[58:52] a better plan than god's he produced
[58:55] wisdom to eve
[58:56] that they might eat from the tree of
[58:58] knowledge but wisdom
[59:00] will not bring you closer to god it will
[59:02] take you further away from
[59:04] god but faith will bring you closer
[59:07] and actually if you have walked out on
[59:09] the tree of knowledge on wisdom
[59:12] faith will make you walk back that tree
[59:15] till you find where you left him at
[59:19] you might have left him at the school
[59:21] you might have left him at the book or
[59:23] you might have been like the one
[59:24] that left him at a baby that he was
[59:27] praying now
[59:28] and lay me down to sleep if you cannot
[59:32] find god go back to where you left him
[59:36] are you with me you see this message of
[59:39] today
[59:40] is to restore the faith back back to the
[59:43] faith
[59:44] of the pentecostal fathers you see doubt
[59:47] will come in and wisdom will come in
[59:50] but doubt will bring forth death i'm
[59:52] more of a positive man a whole lot more
[59:54] than i am a negative man
[59:55] and if the enemy comes in i just like to
[59:57] flip things around on the devil
[59:59] if he tells me that my children ain't
[1:00:01] going to make it
[1:00:04] what are you doing brother andrew you're
[1:00:06] flipping a negative
[1:00:08] into a positive they say that this
[1:00:10] message is just for you
[1:00:13] they say healing was for days gone by
[1:00:17] they say we ain't gonna make it we are
[1:00:20] gonna make it
[1:00:21] they say we're not elected that means we
[1:00:23] are elected they say we don't know
[1:00:25] nothing about god
[1:00:26] shake and whispers all kinds of lies in
[1:00:28] our ears
[1:00:29] we're turning the negative into the
[1:00:31] positive
[1:00:32] because this is a faith-building message
[1:00:37] the faith of paul was that we
[1:00:41] are more than conquerors through him
[1:00:43] that loved us
[1:00:44] the faith of paul said death where is
[1:00:46] this
[1:00:47] king o grave where is thy victory
[1:00:50] what is faith doing it's taking you from
[1:00:53] hearing ground
[1:00:54] to receiving ground you see you can hear
[1:00:57] it here
[1:00:58] but faith will take you where it's at
[1:01:01] faith will take you
[1:01:02] to where there's a handle at and you can
[1:01:04] open up the wells of almighty god
[1:01:08] it's the only kind that the word can
[1:01:11] produce is a
[1:01:12] faith believing people i wonder if
[1:01:15] there's anybody in the house of god that
[1:01:17] faith brought them
[1:01:18] to the result that they see that faith
[1:01:22] brought them to a promise and the
[1:01:24] promise brought you the result
[1:01:25] that the word promised and you say well
[1:01:28] i ain't seen it come to
[1:01:30] fruition yet you just hold on
[1:01:33] you just hold on it may look like he's
[1:01:36] not looking
[1:01:37] it may look like he's not walking your
[1:01:39] way but the son of man
[1:01:41] has got you held up behold the hands
[1:01:45] of jehovah
[1:01:48] confucius can't hold you buddha can't
[1:01:51] hold you
[1:01:52] muhammad can't hold you but behold the
[1:01:55] hands
[1:01:56] of jehovah he is upholding you and if
[1:01:59] you are in his hands
[1:02:00] no man can pluck you out of it
[1:02:06] hallelujah faith brought me to this
[1:02:11] faith will move mountains why will faith
[1:02:14] move mountains because the word calls
[1:02:17] for it to do so you see because the word
[1:02:21] called for it to do so there's going to
[1:02:23] be an elect
[1:02:24] bride in this day a gentile bride in
[1:02:26] this day why
[1:02:27] because we preach it or because we think
[1:02:29] it no because the word called for it
[1:02:33] there's a people that's destined for a
[1:02:34] rapture why because a word calls for it
[1:02:38] there's a people that's dressed why
[1:02:39] because the word
[1:02:41] calls for it and when you look over in
[1:02:44] the bible you see that there was a
[1:02:46] promise
[1:02:46] of a messiah that was coming because the
[1:02:49] word
[1:02:50] called for it and the bible said over in
[1:02:52] deuteronomy 18 and 15
[1:02:54] that moses was standing there and he
[1:02:56] said the lord our god will raise
[1:02:58] up a prophet like unto myself
[1:03:02] right out of the midst of me and when
[1:03:04] when when
[1:03:05] philip found nathanael and he came to
[1:03:07] him running he said
[1:03:09] we have found him oh what a testimony
[1:03:12] service that must have been
[1:03:14] we found him the one that moses spoke of
[1:03:18] you ever went looking for something that
[1:03:19] you couldn't find and you looked all
[1:03:21] over
[1:03:22] you even searched for a whole lot of
[1:03:24] times and you couldn't find it
[1:03:26] but there had been thousands of years
[1:03:29] that have passed
[1:03:30] and the cogs of prophecy were rolling
[1:03:32] right in time
[1:03:34] it may have looked like the messiah
[1:03:36] wasn't coming but when
[1:03:38] philip found nathanael he said we
[1:03:41] have found him who moses spoke of
[1:03:44] who all the other prophets spoke of and
[1:03:47] here was the word himself
[1:03:49] declaring that he was there
[1:03:53] it was laying there all of that time
[1:03:57] but it was now the time of fulfillment
[1:04:01] all the prophets had foretold of his
[1:04:03] coming that a star will rise out of
[1:04:05] jacob
[1:04:05] he'd be born in bethlehem he'd be
[1:04:08] despised and rejected of men and the
[1:04:10] government would be upon his shoulders
[1:04:12] what was it it was history was being
[1:04:15] made
[1:04:16] and prophecy was being fulfilled
[1:04:20] so we could say it into this in this
[1:04:22] service today
[1:04:24] this day this scripture
[1:04:27] is fulfilled in your ears there's a lot
[1:04:30] of people
[1:04:31] that are coming forth with blasphemous
[1:04:33] names and
[1:04:34] idolatry against versus christianity
[1:04:38] and there's a people that have no
[1:04:40] leadership
[1:04:41] but this day this scripture
[1:04:44] is fulfilled that there is a people
[1:04:47] on earth that is connected to the
[1:04:50] headship
[1:04:51] that body knows what to do because the

[1:05:15] this is your place
[1:05:18] you don't have to get shook up by what
[1:05:20] the world is producing
[1:05:22] they're bringing forth members all the
[1:05:23] time but you
[1:05:25] are going to produce what boaz puts you
[1:05:27] here to do
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:31] hallelujah this is your time this is
[1:05:34] your time
[1:05:35] you've been sitting here waiting waiting
[1:05:37] for somebody to say when is your time
[1:05:40] now is your time you've been waiting for
[1:05:43] somebody to say
[1:05:44] when you could get the holy ghost i'm
[1:05:46] here to tell you now's your time
[1:05:48] you've been waiting for your time for to
[1:05:50] come for healing
[1:05:51] i want to say your time is right now
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:56] you say well brother andrew it's way
[1:05:58] past me i want to tell you your time is
[1:06:00] right now
[1:06:01] and if you go to testifying and
[1:06:03] witnessing that the time
[1:06:05] of the vision is now fulfilled
[1:06:11] when it was laying there that there
[1:06:12] would become a forerunner before the
[1:06:14] messiah
[1:06:15] and when john was standing there
[1:06:17] baptizing those
[1:06:19] what they would call somebody that there
[1:06:20] that was dunking people in the water
[1:06:22] trying to drown them
[1:06:24] he said he said i indeed baptize you
[1:06:28] with water
[1:06:29] but there's one coming after me whose
[1:06:31] shoes
[1:06:32] i'm not worthy to bear or to loose he
[1:06:35] said i
[1:06:36] baptize you with water but the one that
[1:06:38] is coming after me
[1:06:39] is mightier than myself he won't just
[1:06:42] baptize you with water
[1:06:43] he'll baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:06:46] and with fire
[1:06:47] what was john doing he was pointing to
[1:06:50] the one that was coming
[1:06:52] and the word always stays the same the
[1:06:55] word came to the prophet
[1:06:57] and the prophet spoke it and god never
[1:06:59] changes his system
[1:07:04] so it had to be a prophet standing this
[1:07:06] day
[1:07:07] to forerun the second coming of christ
[1:07:11] [Applause]
[1:07:12] what was that on the ohio river in 1933
[1:07:15] as john the baptist's message for run
[1:07:17] the first coming of christ
[1:07:19] so will your message william branham
[1:07:21] forerun the second coming of christ
[1:07:23] there will be a people that will rise up
[1:07:26] out of the scriptures
[1:07:27] that'll believe that message why because
[1:07:30] the word
[1:07:31] called for it to be so
[1:07:37] it's the only kind that the word
[1:07:40] can bring forth
[1:07:47] that which was spoken by isaiah
[1:07:51] just going through some promises that
[1:07:53] which was spoken by isaiah
[1:07:55] was conceived in the womb of mary
[1:07:58] which was a prophecy was now a reality
[1:08:05] abraham had a promise that there was
[1:08:08] coming one
[1:08:10] he would be he would be the son
[1:08:14] he wouldn't be ishmael he wouldn't be a
[1:08:16] wild one
[1:08:17] but he would be one that is born out of
[1:08:22] laughter what was it
[1:08:25] it was a vision at one time but when
[1:08:27] isaac came
[1:08:28] forth it was a reality
[1:08:33] it was in vision form when jacob
[1:08:36] when jacob which was the forefather of
[1:08:39] the tribes
[1:08:40] he was a it was a problem it was a
[1:08:42] promise
[1:08:43] because he was a prophet and he would be
[1:08:45] able to look way out into the future
[1:08:48] because god is giving his prophets
[1:08:51] the ability to look past what they see
[1:08:55] and look into the future and jacob said
[1:08:58] don't you bury my bones down here
[1:09:00] and joseph being a prophet got that same
[1:09:03] revelation
[1:09:04] and he looked way out into the future
[1:09:07] when they were still in slavery
[1:09:09] when they were still getting whipped
[1:09:11] when they were still in trouble
[1:09:12] when pharaoh's mighty hand was upon him
[1:09:15] he said don't you bury my bones down
[1:09:17] here
[1:09:18] there ain't no resurrection power down
[1:09:20] here in egypt
[1:09:21] but take my bones up to palestine
[1:09:25] where there's coming a resurrection and
[1:09:28] the life
[1:09:29] what was it on easter morning that which
[1:09:32] was prophecy
[1:09:33] was made reality when the bible said
[1:09:36] there was an earthquake and many were
[1:09:38] seen by the pharisees
[1:09:40] of that land you know what kind of thing
[1:09:43] it was to done
[1:09:45] to to the high priest when he looked out
[1:09:47] there
[1:09:48] and said who's that that's abraham
[1:09:51] that's sarah
[1:09:52] what was it doing and then they vanished
[1:09:55] right before their eyes
[1:09:56] it was prophecy but now it's made a
[1:09:59] reality
[1:10:01] it's modern events made clear by
[1:10:04] prophecy
[1:10:07] they say oh brother andrew you know what
[1:10:09] you're doing i'm following the
[1:10:10] leadership
[1:10:12] of the lord what was it
[1:10:17] joseph was testifying that there was one
[1:10:20] coming
[1:10:25] so can i have the spirit of prophecy
[1:10:28] just now and say there's one coming to
[1:10:31] your situation
[1:10:33] there's healing coming to your body
[1:10:36] there's miracles that are being spoke
[1:10:38] over your life
[1:10:39] i'll say oh brother andrew that's that's
[1:10:41] pretty far out there that's pentecostal
[1:10:43] that's too far let me say this the son
[1:10:46] of man
[1:10:46] is making an invasion right now he's
[1:10:49] coming through your warfare
[1:10:51] he's coming through your mind battles
[1:10:53] he's coming through your circumstance
[1:10:55] the son of man is interested in
[1:10:58] breaking apart the darkness by the light
[1:11:01] of the word
[1:11:02] [Applause]
[1:11:07] oh my the bible says in first john 3 and
[1:11:12] 7
[1:11:13] he says little children let no man
[1:11:16] deceive you
[1:11:18] he that doeth and you look at that word
[1:11:19] doeth it means work
[1:11:22] righteousness is righteous even as he
[1:11:26] is righteous and we know that if this
[1:11:29] verse means anything at all it means
[1:11:31] that
[1:11:32] what a man does he is
[1:11:36] you're known by your works
[1:11:40] god sees your faith but everybody else
[1:11:42] sees your works
[1:11:43] so if you put forth a half-hearted
[1:11:45] effort you're going to produce
[1:11:47] half-hearted results
[1:11:52] if you only put half the check in the
[1:11:54] bank you're only getting
[1:11:55] half the check out the bank are you with
[1:11:58] me
[1:11:59] if you only come here with with the idea
[1:12:02] of just another service or just another
[1:12:04] meeting
[1:12:05] you're only going to get just another
[1:12:07] meeting but if you put your whole heart
[1:12:09] into it
[1:12:10] and you seek him with your whole mind
[1:12:12] you seek him with your whole heart
[1:12:13] you seek him with all your energy and
[1:12:15] all your spirit you're gonna get some
[1:12:17] results
[1:12:18] that only the word can bring forth this
[1:12:21] ain't some man that's trying to puff you
[1:12:23] up work you up if this word doesn't take
[1:12:26] you to another level
[1:12:27] you need to get your bail checked
[1:12:29] because if this don't make your bell
[1:12:32] ring a little bit
[1:12:35] something's wrong you lost your bell
[1:12:40] they say oh brother andrew you don't
[1:12:42] know what you're talking about a bunch
[1:12:43] of bells oh yes i do
[1:12:44] when you walk into the hole he's a
[1:12:46] holiest you got to have your bells on
[1:12:49] screaming holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:12:52] god
[1:12:53] that priest was dressed right that
[1:12:55] priest had blood dripping off of his
[1:12:57] face
[1:12:57] he walked in there with the ephit and it
[1:13:00] was the most
[1:13:01] important thing that he was wearing it
[1:13:03] had the breastplate of righteousness
[1:13:05] upon it
[1:13:06] but on that ephod was the shoulder
[1:13:08] pieces
[1:13:09] and there upon those shoulder pieces was
[1:13:12] the names
[1:13:13] of israel so when the high priest walked
[1:13:16] in there
[1:13:16] he was not walking in there alone he was
[1:13:19] walking in there
[1:13:20] with the tribes of israel upon them and
[1:13:23] when jesus
[1:13:24] went to the cross he was not alone but
[1:13:27] you were identified
[1:13:29] with him he was carrying you upon his
[1:13:32] shoulders
[1:13:33] the government shall be upon his
[1:13:44] shoulders
[1:13:49] now we got your bells wrong we got them
[1:13:52] set up right let's ring the devil's bell
[1:13:55] you're the only kind that the word can
[1:13:56] bring forth
[1:13:59] the word can't produce some half-hearted
[1:14:02] people
[1:14:02] the word can't produce some chickens of
[1:14:04] the age
[1:14:05] the word can only produce eagles the
[1:14:08] word can only produce
[1:14:10] daughters the word can only produce sons
[1:14:13] and if we are sons of god we're going to
[1:14:17] do the same works
[1:14:18] that our father did
[1:14:23] hallelujah
[1:14:26] amy it's got to be more than you
[1:14:30] like a black bird trying to stick
[1:14:31] peacock feathers in his in
[1:14:33] his coat trying to say he's a peacock
[1:14:36] all he is doing is trying to put up on a
[1:14:38] show and try to make himself
[1:14:40] self something that he ain't you see
[1:14:42] you've got to produce
[1:14:44] what's laying there are you with me
[1:14:49] are you with me just now you've got to
[1:14:52] produce the life that's laying on the
[1:14:53] inside of you
[1:14:55] that sheep does not manufacture that
[1:14:57] wall
[1:14:58] he just bears it because it's coming out
[1:15:00] he don't work himself up
[1:15:03] oh let me lay before the lord
[1:15:06] and let me work myself up to speaking in
[1:15:08] tongues oh no no
[1:15:10] no no no no no that sheep just
[1:15:13] bares it out that fruit tree that you
[1:15:17] got
[1:15:17] sitting out there that's full of oranges
[1:15:19] full of grapes and
[1:15:21] full of apples just now what is it it's
[1:15:23] simply bearing
[1:15:25] the life that's in it and you're only
[1:15:28] going to produce what's on the inside of
[1:15:30] you
[1:15:31] you can get worked up all you want to
[1:15:32] but until you're born again
[1:15:35] you'll never produce that which was
[1:15:37] laying there
[1:15:39] because we know we know that if a man
[1:15:42] is born of the word he will produce
[1:15:45] the word the work
[1:15:48] or the fruit of his life will be a
[1:15:50] product of the kind
[1:15:52] of seed or the life that is in him
[1:15:55] his works will be scriptural works
[1:15:58] if it's a scriptural birth the wind
[1:16:02] bloweth where it listed
[1:16:03] and man knows not where it cometh
[1:16:07] but that same wind that blew into the
[1:16:09] upper room
[1:16:10] is blowing through the building and he's
[1:16:13] bringing
[1:16:14] change he's bringing changes to
[1:16:18] circumstances
[1:16:22] you see it's got to be something that's
[1:16:24] laying on the inside
[1:16:26] before it can ever be produced if i
[1:16:29] would tell you that i have the life
[1:16:31] of a musician on the inside of me you
[1:16:34] would expect me to be able to play
[1:16:36] all of these instruments that are
[1:16:37] setting up here
[1:16:40] now i might be able to take some lessons
[1:16:42] and i might be able to gather a little
[1:16:44] bit of knowledge on how to play the
[1:16:45] piano
[1:16:46] but if i told you that i was a musician
[1:16:49] and i got up behind the piano and i
[1:16:51] couldn't play it then something would be
[1:16:54] wrong with my testimony
[1:16:56] is that right and if i told you that i
[1:16:59] had the life of
[1:17:00] uh of a mechanic laying on the inside of
[1:17:02] me and i i could build cars and i could
[1:17:04] put back cars
[1:17:06] and you you had a buddy that tore down
[1:17:08] you tore down your chevy truck and
[1:17:10] he ain't gonna put it back together but
[1:17:12] i told you i had the life of a mechanic
[1:17:14] on the inside of me
[1:17:15] you would come to me and say brother
[1:17:16] andrew said you're a mechanic you say
[1:17:18] you are
[1:17:19] i want you to go back in there and and
[1:17:21] take my chevy truck and put it back to
[1:17:23] pieces
[1:17:24] and i want you to put it back the way it
[1:17:26] it's meant to be and if i went in there
[1:17:28] and i started grabbing a manual and
[1:17:30] looking all over it and i was trying to
[1:17:32] put
[1:17:33] i was trying to put the fan belt over
[1:17:35] top on
[1:17:36] on the engine block somewhere that it
[1:17:38] wasn't supposed to be at
[1:17:40] you would say that there's something
[1:17:42] wrong with my testimony
[1:17:44] and if if i stand here and i say that
[1:17:48] i have the spirit of christ and i don't
[1:17:51] produce the spirit of christ
[1:17:53] then something is wrong with my
[1:17:55] testimony
[1:17:56] now i can learn some scriptures and i
[1:17:59] could learn
[1:18:00] how to say amen i can learn how to sing
[1:18:03] and i could learn how to say hallelujah
[1:18:05] but if there's no life behind my
[1:18:07] testimony
[1:18:08] then it's of no value
[1:18:11] are you with me if i had the life of a
[1:18:13] carpenter and i couldn't put up a
[1:18:14] a 10 shack then something's wrong with
[1:18:17] my testimony
[1:18:18] and if people are telling you that
[1:18:20] they're born again christians
[1:18:22] but never can never can make the bible
[1:18:25] talk for itself
[1:18:27] something's wrong with their testimony
[1:18:30] because jesus said
[1:18:32] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:18:35] and greater works than these shall you
[1:18:38] do
[1:18:39] because i go and to my father if you ask
[1:18:42] anything in my name
[1:18:43] i will do it
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:48] i want to tell you i as a preacher of
[1:18:51] this restored faith
[1:18:52] i'm not surprised by the mighty works
[1:18:54] that's going on and taking place
[1:18:56] because this is the hour and the time of
[1:19:00] restoration
[1:19:02] i'm not surprised because we know that
[1:19:04] this is the hour
[1:19:06] when the born-again experience has been
[1:19:08] restored
[1:19:09] divine healing that which was told was
[1:19:12] for the atonement on the other side has
[1:19:15] now been told to you
[1:19:16] that it is of the same atonement it has
[1:19:20] been
[1:19:20] restored back yes
[1:19:26] are you with me days old days gone by
[1:19:29] they said that it was
[1:19:30] that mark 11 was before the atonement
[1:19:34] was
[1:19:34] ever made but this what you have
[1:19:37] is an eternal atonement
[1:19:41] it covers before and it covers after
[1:19:47] let me bring it down to your knowledge
[1:19:49] so you'll gather what i'm saying
[1:19:50] it covers you before you were a
[1:19:52] christian and it covers you
[1:19:54] after you're a christian
[1:19:57] hallelujah this message has told you
[1:20:00] that you
[1:20:01] have the right to enforce the claim upon
[1:20:04] the enemy
[1:20:05] and tell him he's nothing but a squatter
[1:20:08] that's been
[1:20:09] restored back to you
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:13] miracles has been restored signs has
[1:20:16] been restored
[1:20:17] wonders has been restored and the spirit
[1:20:20] has got to follow this word
[1:20:22] if it's if it's a true word it's got to
[1:20:24] follow it
[1:20:26] it's just like a conductor it follows
[1:20:29] that spirit
[1:20:30] follows where the word goes
[1:20:33] you can flip that switch on and
[1:20:35] electricity will come on
[1:20:37] where it's at and if it doesn't come on
[1:20:39] there there is something
[1:20:41] that is not arrived something's off
[1:20:45] somewhere
[1:20:46] but if you can get it fixed
[1:20:49] if you can get it turned around it'll
[1:20:52] produce
[1:20:53] the light that it was called to produce
[1:20:56] because it said that it would do it
[1:20:59] and if the word be preached in its
[1:21:01] fullness and believed and received
[1:21:04] it'll bring forth exactly what he said
[1:21:09] the bible says greater is he that is in
[1:21:10] me than he that's in the world so if
[1:21:12] he's greater
[1:21:13] why don't you let him be greater
[1:21:16] are you with me if he says that there's
[1:21:18] no weapon that's formed against you
[1:21:20] why don't you let it be no weapon that's
[1:21:22] formed against you
[1:21:24] if he said he sealed you till the day of
[1:21:25] your redemption why don't you let him be
[1:21:27] god
[1:21:28] and why don't you let yourself be the
[1:21:30] human and try and stop
[1:21:32] trying to get yourself involved in
[1:21:34] figuring out how the timing of it's got
[1:21:36] to be worth if he's greater
[1:21:38] let him be greater if he's stronger let
[1:21:40] him be stronger
[1:21:42] if he's wiser let him be wiser
[1:21:46] he's god he's god and the father
[1:21:49] he's god in the son he's god in the holy
[1:21:52] ghost
[1:21:52] he's god all three and one
[1:22:02] we'll produce only what the word
[1:22:06] said it would produce
[1:22:09] i look upon this church
[1:22:12] this is the only kind that the word can
[1:22:15] bring forth
[1:22:17] because the bible says in psalms 107 and
[1:22:19] 20 that he sent his word and he healed
[1:22:21] them and delivered them
[1:22:22] from their destructions and so we know
[1:22:26] that
[1:22:26] that christ in the true church is a
[1:22:30] continuation of the book of acts
[1:22:32] is that right so if it's a continuation
[1:22:35] it's got to bring forth the life
[1:22:37] that's laying there so let me say the
[1:22:39] life that's laying on the inside of this
[1:22:41] bride
[1:22:42] is not the life of confucius it's not
[1:22:45] the life of muhammad
[1:22:46] where they bring it to some idea this is
[1:22:48] not the idea
[1:22:50] uh uh this is not the life of buddha
[1:22:53] that'll bring you to some quiet food
[1:22:55] where you get yourself quiet and you get
[1:22:57] into a spot of solitude
[1:22:59] and you begin to think the right kind of
[1:23:02] thing and it'll produce
[1:23:03] what you think it will be that kind of
[1:23:06] life
[1:23:07] is as powerless as the grave they're in
[1:23:11] but the life that's on the inside of
[1:23:13] this bride is the life of the almighty
[1:23:16] of sufficient el shaddai the almighty
[1:23:20] jehovah the one that provides the one
[1:23:23] that sustains
[1:23:28] that life is there so it's got to be a
[1:23:31] continuation
[1:23:32] and shaken knows that if the people get
[1:23:34] the true revelation
[1:23:36] of the true church and what she is and
[1:23:39] what she stands for
[1:23:41] that she can do the greater works that
[1:23:44] she will
[1:23:44] be an invincible army if they get a true
[1:23:48] revelation
[1:23:49] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:23:51] of the christian church
[1:23:52] and by god's holy spirit discern and
[1:23:55] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:23:57] satan will be powerless before her
[1:24:03] let me remind you of some things you're
[1:24:05] more than a match
[1:24:06] for the enemy jesus was more than a
[1:24:10] match
[1:24:11] when he come against satan on the amount
[1:24:13] of temptation
[1:24:14] he was more than a match when he came
[1:24:16] against him at the garden of gethsemane
[1:24:18] he was more than a match for him when he
[1:24:20] come against him at calvary
[1:24:22] so let me say this to the true bride
[1:24:24] there ain't no circumstance
[1:24:26] there ain't no cancer there ain't no
[1:24:28] brain bleed
[1:24:29] there ain't no unthink unclean thing
[1:24:32] there ain't no disease there ain't no
[1:24:35] problems
[1:24:36] gonna stand in front
[1:24:41] there ain't nothing gonna stand in front
[1:24:42] of me get into my promise
[1:24:46] i am who i am because the i am tells me
[1:24:50] who i am
[1:24:54] same works same signs same miracles
[1:24:58] same healings same life same word
[1:25:03] same results same faith
[1:25:06] not something different but the same
[1:25:08] faith
[1:25:11] psalms 33 says by the word of the lord
[1:25:14] where the heavens made jesus
[1:25:18] trusted his own word he trusted and he
[1:25:22] believed his own word
[1:25:23] and the prophet said that he wrote the
[1:25:25] worlds off of his fingertips
[1:25:27] and he gave us insight into his mind
[1:25:33] i'm just like the spirit of the bride
[1:25:37] she has the mind of christ she only does
[1:25:40] what he commands
[1:25:42] so we get insight into his mind and he
[1:25:45] is saying to you church
[1:25:47] that if i did it you can do it
[1:25:52] if i took a man that had a withered hand
[1:25:55] and i told him to stretch out his hand
[1:25:58] and he stretched out his hand and it
[1:25:59] came forth
[1:26:00] and he didn't have no problems in his
[1:26:01] elbow no more and that which wasn't
[1:26:04] produced
[1:26:04] before was produced then because the
[1:26:07] author of life
[1:26:12] you see god wasn't concerned if it was
[1:26:13] going to be produced or not
[1:26:15] and god ain't concerned whether you're
[1:26:16] going to come to fruition or not
[1:26:19] let me get a little personal god ain't
[1:26:21] concerned if wesley's gonna walk
[1:26:23] or not he knows he's gonna walk god
[1:26:25] ain't concerned if hannah thomas is
[1:26:27] gonna walk down this aisle with a baby
[1:26:28] in a brown dress
[1:26:29] little girl come walking down that aisle
[1:26:31] god ain't concerned about that
[1:26:33] god ain't concerned if ron spencer gets
[1:26:35] well of cancer he's already seen him
[1:26:37] well
[1:26:38] god ain't concerned whether you're going
[1:26:40] to make it or going to lay out a seal
[1:26:42] and go by the way of the grave god said
[1:26:44] they're going to be a generation
[1:26:45] that'll rise up god ain't concerned
[1:26:49] god ain't shook up god ain't worried
[1:26:51] about what's going to go on
[1:26:53] it will produce what he said it would
[1:26:57] produce
[1:26:58] don't get caught up in the time of the
[1:27:00] things don't get caught up every morning
[1:27:02] he ain't seen yet god is as good as his
[1:27:05] word
[1:27:08] and he's looking for believers people
[1:27:10] that's got courage
[1:27:12] there's a lot of people got a lot of
[1:27:13] intellect but they don't have the
[1:27:15] courage
[1:27:15] to stand up behind the word of god but
[1:27:18] there's a people
[1:27:19] the only kind that the word can come
[1:27:21] forth out of
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:24] they'll be courageous when they stand
[1:27:26] before the prince of persia
[1:27:27] for 21 days and it seems like god ain't
[1:27:30] going to answer their prayer
[1:27:31] but daniel stayed there and he kept on
[1:27:34] praying
[1:27:36] when it looked like nobody was going
[1:27:38] with david down into the valley
[1:27:40] there was one mightier than himself that
[1:27:43] walked down into that valley
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:51] the bible says in job 26-7 that he hangs
[1:27:55] the world
[1:27:56] on nothing
[1:28:02] i've been good for nothing my whole life
[1:28:05] i have been
[1:28:06] i have done wretched things all my life
[1:28:09] if god can take this universe and he
[1:28:12] holds it on nothing surely he can take a
[1:28:14] good for nothing nobody
[1:28:16] and make something out of him you're not
[1:28:19] nothing
[1:28:19] you're a child of the most high god
[1:28:24] the air that you breathe you think is
[1:28:26] just common as the blades of grass upon
[1:28:29] the
[1:28:29] upon the land out there but i want to
[1:28:31] tell you it's that air
[1:28:33] that sets the mighty eagles into its
[1:28:36] soaring path
[1:28:37] you look out upon it you can't even see
[1:28:39] it but it's
[1:28:40] that air that makes the eagle rise to
[1:28:43] another level
[1:28:45] what the enemy thinks is nothing is your
[1:28:48] everything
[1:28:49] [Applause]
[1:28:55] you thought you was just walking into a
[1:28:56] service you thought that this was just
[1:28:59] another time
[1:29:00] you didn't just walk in here with
[1:29:02] nothing you're leaving here with
[1:29:03] everything
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:07] everything you have need of her life
[1:29:09] journey was given to you
[1:29:10] when you got the baptism of the holy
[1:29:12] ghost his word is infallible
[1:29:16] when he said there'd be a 42 inch
[1:29:17] caribou that would have been a 42 inch
[1:29:19] caribou
[1:29:21] whether he had been out there for 10
[1:29:23] years waiting on somebody to come kill
[1:29:25] him
[1:29:26] or whether he was produced in a matter
[1:29:28] of seconds

[1:29:51] checkered shirt

[1:29:58] supposed to be there
[1:29:59] he was supposed to be on another trip
[1:30:03] had biscuit wasn't supposed to have a
[1:30:05] green checkered church
[1:30:06] he said ruth you throw that thing away

[1:30:14] you can try to throw me away you can try
[1:30:16] to shut me up
[1:30:17] but i'm a part of the vision just as
[1:30:19] much as that green checkered shirt was a
[1:30:21] part of the vision
[1:30:23] [Applause]
[1:30:27] he asked him to man he don't have a
[1:30:29] green checkered shirt
[1:30:30] he said is there any animals like this

[1:30:43] service

[1:30:47] nothing but you carried something in
[1:30:49] here
[1:30:49] that's a part of the vision
[1:30:53] you could be sitting there and you might
[1:30:55] fall into a trap and get yourself
[1:30:57] soaking wet
[1:30:59] in a mess thinking why new world
[1:31:02] did my wife pack this green checkered
[1:31:05] shirt

[1:31:10] that's what brother biscuit told us he
[1:31:12] said he said my mind
[1:31:14] wasn't on the vision
[1:31:17] he said he said but when i stood there
[1:31:20] at that 42 inch caribou
[1:31:22] he said i began to feel strange
[1:31:26] he said there's that green checkered
[1:31:28] shirt
[1:31:32] and bud's trying to pull that tape out
[1:31:35] he's trying to make it lay just right
[1:31:38] and it won't stay in place he says
[1:31:40] blaine put your hands there

[1:31:47] hands
[1:31:48] laid on the horns of that 42-inch
[1:31:51] caribou
[1:31:52] brother branham said there it is
[1:31:58] which was spoken years in advance took
[1:32:01] six
[1:32:01] hours to produce
[1:32:04] you might die you might doubt what's
[1:32:07] coming to pass in this moment
[1:32:10] but the time is right now his
[1:32:13] word is infallible
[1:32:16] when he told his disciples you go up
[1:32:18] there and you wait
[1:32:20] until you're endued with power you're
[1:32:22] going to be in dude not many days hits
[1:32:24] what if they'd have got up there i said
[1:32:26] well we would have been up here six days
[1:32:28] seven days well we've done we don't walk
[1:32:31] with jesus we've done seen everything
[1:32:33] we know how to work like he works we've
[1:32:35] seen how he broke bread
[1:32:37] but somebody stood up saying no he said
[1:32:39] wait until you know
[1:32:41] wait until you are endued with power
[1:32:46] what were they doing up there all that
[1:32:48] time
[1:32:49] they were just sitting around the
[1:32:51] prophet said they were up there praising
[1:32:53] god
[1:32:54] until he came oh you might sit here and
[1:32:59] you're wondering
[1:33:00] when will it ever come to pass will the
[1:33:02] vision ever make its way
[1:33:03] you're sitting here you've got more than
[1:33:06] a green checkered shirt on
[1:33:07] you have a predestinated seed of god
[1:33:13] just praise him till it comes to pass
[1:33:17] and when it comes to pass it's going to
[1:33:18] be real and you won't have to bluff the
[1:33:21] devil the devil know you got it
[1:33:23] and the devil will run for cover you
[1:33:25] just praise him
[1:33:27] for his mighty acts praise him in the
[1:33:29] high sounding symbol
[1:33:31] praise him on the low sounding symbol
[1:33:37] they knew it would come to pass
[1:33:42] they waited there until the day of
[1:33:44] pentecost was fully come
[1:33:46] and when it was fully come there came a
[1:33:49] sound like a mighty rushing wind on the
[1:33:51] inside of there
[1:33:56] and it set upon them
[1:33:59] they knew they had it they knew they had
[1:34:04] and when they broke out everybody on the
[1:34:06] outside knew they had it
[1:34:10] because the word can only bring forth of
[1:34:13] this god
[1:34:17] peter a man that denied the lord stood
[1:34:20] up three days after that
[1:34:23] and said such as i have give out in the
[1:34:25] name of jesus christ
[1:34:28] when a man that that held the coat of
[1:34:30] stephen
[1:34:32] there when they were stoned in him his
[1:34:34] name was saw at that time
[1:34:36] but there came a pillar of fire by his
[1:34:38] way and he changed
[1:34:40] him from saul to paul to the greatest
[1:34:42] preacher
[1:34:43] in the new testament one that would
[1:34:45] write 14 books of your new testament
[1:34:48] bible
[1:34:49] and the bible said in acts chapter 16
[1:34:52] when paul was sent by way of a vision
[1:34:55] over to macedonia and he was sent there
[1:34:58] he walked into a spot and the holy
[1:34:59] spirit don't say nothing
[1:35:01] he said don't just say nothing but he
[1:35:02] went over to macedonia
[1:35:04] and the holy spirit said speak on and
[1:35:07] when he started speaking and he started
[1:35:09] preaching the gospel
[1:35:11] there was a soothsayer a woman a
[1:35:13] divination
[1:35:14] that followed him around and said these
[1:35:17] are servants of the most high god now
[1:35:20] the bible said that this went on for
[1:35:21] days
[1:35:22] she was following them around following
[1:35:25] them around and saying these are
[1:35:26] servants
[1:35:27] of the most high god and the bible said
[1:35:29] that because
[1:35:31] of her sue saying that she being a
[1:35:33] fortune teller
[1:35:34] had brought the people and the men of
[1:35:36] influence much
[1:35:37] gain because of that spirit of
[1:35:40] divination
[1:35:41] you know what a spirit of divination is
[1:35:43] brother branham said it's a christian
[1:35:45] that's got a perverted spirit on them
[1:35:48] and here she was following them around
[1:35:51] saying these are servants of the most
[1:35:53] high god
[1:35:54] but paul didn't need no help from the
[1:35:56] devil to tell him who he was
[1:35:58] he knew who he was he knew he had power
[1:36:01] over that thing
[1:36:02] but paul was so led of the holy spirit
[1:36:05] that he would not cast that thing off
[1:36:07] until the holy spirit said rebuke
[1:36:10] that thing and when he rebuked that
[1:36:12] thing it immediately left
[1:36:14] and the men of influence got so upset
[1:36:17] because they lost
[1:36:18] their way of making money in the land
[1:36:21] they got so upset because they was
[1:36:23] preaching jesus christ
[1:36:24] of nazareth was the same yesterday today
[1:36:27] and forever
[1:36:28] and he was doing miracles and he was
[1:36:30] bringing forth healings
[1:36:31] they got so upset that the bible said
[1:36:34] that they threw them in the prison and
[1:36:37] they locked up
[1:36:38] their feet you know that's what the
[1:36:40] devils want to do to do
[1:36:41] to you today is lock up your feet to
[1:36:44] keep you from dancing
[1:36:46] but the bible said at the midnight hour
[1:36:49] that paul and silas sing
[1:36:51] songs and praises unto god
[1:36:54] and at that hour the earth began to
[1:36:57] quake
[1:36:58] and everybody not just paul and silas
[1:37:01] but everybody sitting in the prison
[1:37:04] house
[1:37:04] was set free let them break for the
[1:37:07] praise in this place
[1:37:09] that not only the parents not only the
[1:37:11] children
[1:37:12] but everyone all of our loved ones would
[1:37:15] get
[1:37:15] set free and you could go to dancing
[1:37:25] it's a time you take the shackles off of
[1:37:27] your feet
[1:37:30] you got something to dance about you got
[1:37:32] something to praise god about
[1:37:35] you're the only kind that the word
[1:37:38] can bring forth
[1:37:43] i want you to keep this in mind and i
[1:37:45] want you to
[1:37:46] conceive in your mind that the holy
[1:37:48] ghost is right here right now
[1:37:52] i want you to conceive in your mind
[1:37:55] that you're the only kind that the word
[1:37:58] can bring forth say that from your lips
[1:38:01] i'm the only kind
[1:38:03] that the word can bring forth
[1:38:07] now now now now if they could put up
[1:38:09] this quote for us in the invisible union
[1:38:13] he said he's speaking of the modern
[1:38:15] church he said you see
[1:38:17] she's pregnant with something because
[1:38:20] she's bringing forth members all the
[1:38:22] time
[1:38:24] but she don't want none of them
[1:38:25] screaming hollering
[1:38:27] blabbering acts 2 38 miserable creatures
[1:38:30] that she thinks that they are
[1:38:32] it would certainly embarrass her
[1:38:36] it would ruin her and her educated
[1:38:38] ethical scientific society
[1:38:40] church that she belonged to here they
[1:38:43] would throw her out
[1:38:44] at the next council she can't have it so
[1:38:47] she don't want to be pregnant
[1:38:49] with the word because that's the only
[1:38:51] kind
[1:38:52] that the word can bring forth born of
[1:38:55] the spirit of god
[1:38:56] it has the spirit of god in it no
[1:38:58] intellectual church
[1:38:59] join cree going bold hair painted face
[1:39:02] there's no such a thing as that
[1:39:04] in all of it you don't find that in the
[1:39:07] word of god
[1:39:08] you find are you seeing yourself you
[1:39:12] find an old-fashioned
[1:39:13] sanctified holy ghost-filled child born
[1:39:16] of the spirit of god
[1:39:17] screaming hollering shouting praising
[1:39:20] god
[1:39:20] that's the only kind that the word can
[1:39:23] bring forth
[1:39:28] what's going on brother andrew i'm
[1:39:29] bringing forth
[1:39:31] that which was deposited
[1:39:34] why you act that way i'm bringing forth
[1:39:37] i'm the only kind that the word
[1:39:39] can bring forth
[1:39:42] martini which was my grandma christine
[1:39:45] spencer we've known rustini all of our
[1:39:47] life and i'll tell you why we know her
[1:39:48] like that she didn't want to be called
[1:39:50] grandma
[1:39:51] so we caught her teeny my teeny
[1:39:56] i think she's known around as the bride
[1:39:57] of jesus christ by tina that's okay
[1:39:59] y'all can call her tina if you want to
[1:40:02] she's my teenia
[1:40:05] but my teeny was martini was was a very
[1:40:09] very very spirit-filled lady
[1:40:12] and at a very young age at a very young
[1:40:15] age she had joined
[1:40:16] the i believe it was the methodist
[1:40:17] church and she had signed her name to
[1:40:19] the church book
[1:40:21] and she'd come to the message and come
[1:40:22] to the knowledge of truth and she wanted
[1:40:24] to get her name
[1:40:25] off of that book here she was as a young
[1:40:27] little girl
[1:40:29] and they called in all the bishops and
[1:40:31] the priests of uh of that
[1:40:32] of that church they called her in they
[1:40:35] put her parents outside
[1:40:36] and they sat teeny right down in the
[1:40:38] middle of all of these men
[1:40:40] and they tried to convince her that she
[1:40:42] was doing the wrong thing
[1:40:44] but she stood there in the face of all
[1:40:47] of those bishops and so-called priests
[1:40:49] of that day
[1:40:50] and shut them up because of the word of
[1:40:53] truth
[1:40:54] this was a lady that was a only kind
[1:40:57] that the word could bring forth she knew
[1:41:00] who she was
[1:41:02] she knew where she came from and she
[1:41:04] knew where she was going
[1:41:06] and a few years back she'd been gone a
[1:41:08] couple years but a few years before she
[1:41:10] was gone
[1:41:11] she had went down to this message church

[1:41:29] in the spirit
[1:41:30] and began to speak in tongues and
[1:41:32] stepped out into the aisle began to
[1:41:34] dance
[1:41:34] and the deacons of that church came and
[1:41:37] set her down
[1:41:39] said we don't want none of that here
[1:41:43] and they're now dead it's 12 o'clock why
[1:41:46] because they had the spirit of my kale
[1:41:48] upon her

[1:41:52] no more because they don't want knowing
[1:41:55] those acts 2 38
[1:41:56] hollering blabbering speaking in tongues
[1:41:59] screaming
[1:42:06] they don't want it but we welcome it
[1:42:10] it's the only kind that the word can
[1:42:13] bring forth
[1:42:19] as well i don't know about all that
[1:42:20] shouting i don't know all about that
[1:42:22] excitement
[1:42:22] let me give you a scripture for it any
[1:42:24] time that jesus ever touched anybody
[1:42:28] they begin to shout
[1:42:31] the bible said that when the ten lepers
[1:42:33] came to him
[1:42:34] he told them go your way and show
[1:42:36] yourself to the high priest
[1:42:38] and as they went one turn back and
[1:42:41] shouted with a loud voice

[1:42:57] testament the bible said in first
[1:42:59] chronicles 15 and 28
[1:43:01] thus all israel

[1:43:06] lord
[1:43:07] with shouting and with sound of the
[1:43:11] cornet
[1:43:12] and with trumpets and with symbols
[1:43:14] making a noise
[1:43:15] with sultries and hearts
[1:43:19] i like a dead service where men
[1:43:22] say amen and they say words with
[1:43:26] great intelligence when they can speak
[1:43:28] it out and hush the crowd
[1:43:30] you need to get born again you catholic
[1:43:43] i don't get excited about that i think i
[1:43:45] think i think it ought to be just
[1:43:48] the preacher shouldn't get excited
[1:43:52] maybe just the just the real worshipers
[1:43:55] people that know how to carry a tune
[1:43:57] in the bucket
[1:44:03] let me tell you can i give you some
[1:44:06] scripture
[1:44:09] i'm a bible preaching
[1:44:12] preacher i was told by a critic
[1:44:16] right here brother andrew you need to
[1:44:19] learn your bible
[1:44:20] you know what i did i wouldn't learn my
[1:44:22] bible
[1:44:27] like i didn't know it in the first place
[1:44:29] oh you better be quiet just let the
[1:44:31] worshipers
[1:44:32] worship preachers should just preach the
[1:44:35] word
[1:44:36] just speak jesus okay
[1:44:40] ezra 3 and 11 and they sing together
[1:44:46] sit down

[1:44:53] and giving thanks unto the lord because
[1:44:56] he is good
[1:44:57] for his mercy endureth forever toward
[1:45:00] israel
[1:45:00] and all the people shouted with a great
[1:45:04] shout
[1:45:05] when they praise the lord because the
[1:45:07] foundation of the house
[1:45:09] of the lord was laid
[1:45:16] they all shouted this ain't just for the
[1:45:18] worshipers
[1:45:19] verse 12 but many of the priests and
[1:45:23] levites
[1:45:24] of the chief of the fathers who were
[1:45:27] ancient men
[1:45:28] men that knew how to worship men that
[1:45:31] had seen the first tabernacle put in
[1:45:33] place
[1:45:34] they had seen the first house when the
[1:45:37] foundation of this house was laid before
[1:45:39] their eyes
[1:45:40] wept with a loud voice and many shouted
[1:45:43] aloud for joy
[1:45:46] so that the people could not discern the
[1:45:48] noise of the shout
[1:45:50] of the joy from the noise of the weeping
[1:45:53] of the people
[1:45:54] for the people shouted with a loud shout
[1:45:56] and the noise was heard
[1:45:58] afar off
[1:46:02] don't tell me to be quiet and to go sit
[1:46:04] down in my pew
[1:46:05] because if you felt like i felt
[1:46:09] you'd be shouting to
[1:46:15] you're talking about a shout that's the
[1:46:18] only kind
[1:46:19] that the word can bring forth
[1:46:23] the modern church don't want it but the
[1:46:26] bride
[1:46:28] she knows where she at
[1:46:34] psalms 5 and 11.
[1:46:37] you can put it up there but i'm going to
[1:46:40] give it to you in the passion
[1:46:41] translation
[1:46:43] psalms 5 and 11 because people
[1:46:50] people want their new age bible
[1:46:54] they don't want that king james version
[1:46:56] that's too old for them
[1:46:58] let me give you the passion translation
[1:47:03] but let all them be glad those who turn
[1:47:07] aside
[1:47:08] to hide themselves in you may they keep
[1:47:11] shouting
[1:47:12] for joy forever
[1:47:15] overshadow them in your presence as they
[1:47:18] sing and rejoice then every lover of
[1:47:21] your name
[1:47:22] will burst forth with endless joy
[1:47:27] may they shout may they keep on shouting
[1:47:31] forever well
[1:47:35] i'm going to take a trip on that good
[1:47:38] old gospel ship
[1:47:41] i'm not just excited down here it's just
[1:47:44] a foretaste of what's coming up there
[1:47:47] i'm not just shouting down here on earth
[1:47:50] but the bible tells me
[1:47:51] i will shout for joy forever
[1:47:56] there's power in your shout out
[1:48:02] they don't want it because they like
[1:48:05] living with walls
[1:48:08] but israel shouted all the israel
[1:48:10] shouted
[1:48:12] and walls fell down when jesus was
[1:48:15] making this triumphal entry into the
[1:48:17] city when he told his disciples
[1:48:19] he said over there by that way there's a
[1:48:21] coat that's tied
[1:48:22] you go in there and if anybody asks you
[1:48:24] what you're doing you tell them that the
[1:48:25] lord has need of them
[1:48:27] and when they saw this thing that was
[1:48:30] done
[1:48:30] on which a coat had never been ridden on
[1:48:33] the bible said that the disciples came
[1:48:35] forth shouting with a loud voice
[1:48:38] praising god
[1:48:39] for his wondrous works that they had
[1:48:42] seen
[1:48:42] and it caused such an uproar like the
[1:48:45] pharisees
[1:48:46] and the so-called highfalutin message
[1:48:48] people of the church
[1:48:50] said hey why don't you rebuke your
[1:48:52] disciples
[1:48:53] for worshiping you like that he said if
[1:48:55] these hold their peace
[1:48:57] the rocks will immediately cry out
[1:49:00] i never seen one rock
[1:49:04] that can sing like i can i ain't never
[1:49:07] seen one boulder
[1:49:08] that can roll over and make a joyful
[1:49:10] noise
[1:49:11] like i can i'm the only kind that the
[1:49:14] word
[1:49:15] can bring forth
