[53:48] book of revelations chapter chapter 1.
[53:52] amen
[53:58] i certainly
[54:00] miss not being able to have brother
[54:01] danny steaming here with us this weekend
[54:03] and
[54:04] and uh
[54:07] and we'll be rescheduling him
[54:10] and so we'll work that timing out and
[54:12] let you know we we try to keep these
[54:14] meetings that we have lined up during
[54:16] these during these things kind of
[54:19] tight-lipped as it were and and so
[54:22] because we never know what's going to
[54:24] have to happen because of the covet
[54:26] situation and so
[54:28] he kind of got a little bit exposed
[54:30] there to it and just didn't want to
[54:32] bring anything to you and we say god
[54:34] bless you brother danny thank you very
[54:36] much we certainly appreciate that
[54:38] amen so
[54:40] while i was speaking last weekend and
[54:42] brother jose
[54:43] before i knew brother danny had had
[54:45] canceled and and all of these things i
[54:48] while i was actually preaching the lord
[54:50] dropped this this this thought in my
[54:52] heart and i i'll just tell you i've been
[54:54] building this thought for about three
[54:55] years now
[54:56] and uh finally the lord gave me
[54:59] permission while i was actually speaking
[55:01] during the meeting the lord was dealing
[55:03] with me and i should have known right
[55:04] there that i i was going to be speaking
[55:06] to you this weekend so
[55:09] so
[55:10] you just help us preach this evening
[55:13] amen by the help of the lord i'd like to
[55:15] speak to you on the time is at hand
[55:19] in revelations chapter 1 and verse 1 the
[55:21] bible says
[55:23] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[55:26] gave unto him
[55:27] to show unto his servants things
[55:30] which must shortly come to pass
[55:33] and he sent and signified it by his
[55:35] angel
[55:36] unto his servant john
[55:39] who bear record of the word of god and
[55:41] of the testimony of jesus christ
[55:44] and of all of these things
[55:46] and of all things that he saw
[55:50] blessed is he that readeth
[55:52] and they that hear the words of this
[55:54] prophecy
[55:56] and keep those things which are written
[55:58] therein
[55:59] for the time is at hand
[56:01] brother branham would mother brandon
[56:03] would come and he would speak and he
[56:04] would say these things blessed is he
[56:06] that readeth or blessed is he that
[56:07] understandeth
[56:10] and what a blessed people that we are
[56:12] to understand that this book is not for
[56:14] another people
[56:16] but this book is for you amen god bless
[56:18] you you may be seated in the presence of
[56:20] the lord
[56:21] i know that i about scared you to death
[56:23] there i've been building this sermon for
[56:24] three years i won't preach three years
[56:26] of notes to you this evening
[56:29] but god lays no god lays thoughts on us
[56:32] on our hearts as ministers and he has a
[56:34] certain time that he wants to bring
[56:36] forth a word at a certain season and
[56:37] maybe as humanity we don't understand
[56:40] everything why not deliver it but god
[56:43] god has his timing in all things and god
[56:46] we realize about the attributes of god
[56:48] that that that god is eternal and we
[56:52] realize that that there is no other
[56:54] being outside of god and the
[56:56] predestinated of god that that are are
[56:59] able to comprehend the the mindset of
[57:01] eternal
[57:02] we as human beings we can't necessarily
[57:05] understand what what eternal life is
[57:07] like but yet we have been dropped into a
[57:10] space of time that we might live under
[57:13] the auspices of the great pouring out of
[57:15] the holy ghost and realizing that god
[57:17] had all of these attributes that were
[57:19] laying on the inside of him before the
[57:21] foundation of the world and god wanted
[57:23] to come and he wanted to express himself
[57:26] he wanted to express himself and there
[57:28] we know that throughout all of the
[57:30] cycles of billions and trillions of
[57:32] years that god was already there and god
[57:34] was god had no beginning and he had no
[57:37] ending but god god didn't have a start
[57:39] date and god don't have a finish date
[57:42] and because god is god he is not
[57:45] changing he's not going he's not coming
[57:47] he's here and he is he
[57:50] he stays in that realm of eternal and
[57:52] you and i necessarily we operate in a
[57:55] world in a world of time everything is
[57:57] moved in our world of time but just to
[58:00] just to kind of set a stage just for a
[58:02] moment for you that god god is not
[58:05] controlled by time because god is
[58:08] eternal and there we can go back and
[58:10] look in the very beginning where we we
[58:12] see where the genesis is there when
[58:14] where we look at the beginning and there
[58:17] when we watch as the logos of god when
[58:20] it begin to go forth and it began to
[58:22] speak and there were things that were
[58:24] laying there and you remember when
[58:26] brother branham would say did you ever
[58:27] draw out a picture in your mind and he
[58:29] said that's what god did there in the
[58:31] very beginning he drawed these things
[58:33] out in his mind that these things were
[58:36] going to be set up and before before it
[58:38] could be a word spoken of let there be
[58:41] light or let there be trees or let there
[58:43] be a sun or let there be rivers or
[58:45] waters it had to be a thought first and
[58:48] brother branham said that god drew a
[58:50] great picture he drew this great picture
[58:53] and he seen that it seemed good to him
[58:56] therefore he spoke it and noticed that
[58:59] word went forth and it expressed out of
[59:02] the one it came out of the one that had
[59:04] the thought and knowing this that god is
[59:07] eternal he cannot change his mind he
[59:10] looks at a thought and he looks at it he
[59:12] looks at his scene and he sees it he
[59:14] speaks it and it's got to come to pass
[59:17] and god will never have to back up on
[59:19] what he has said now as human beings we
[59:22] have to back up on mistakes or or
[59:24] promises that we can't keep because
[59:26] we're human beings but god does never
[59:29] have to back up on what he has said
[59:31] there's many a times that your family
[59:32] members let you down or humanity has let
[59:35] you down but there is one person in this
[59:37] life that you are very acquainted with
[59:40] that has never let you down and that is
[59:42] our lord jesus christ he is he has
[59:44] always been the constant in your life
[59:46] he's always been there and we live in a
[59:49] world where things are constantly
[59:50] changing when when when men are changing
[59:53] their thoughts when when democrats and
[59:55] republicans are changing their ideas and
[59:57] and but we're living in a place where we
[1:00:00] realize that god is infallible in all of
[1:00:03] his ways and we're working and and here
[1:00:06] we are working with the infallibility of
[1:00:08] the very spoken word of god and we
[1:00:11] realize that through the message that
[1:00:14] that brother branham would say that that
[1:00:16] god had these attributes in him you see
[1:00:19] they were already there and there god
[1:00:21] would begin to express himself and he
[1:00:24] said he said the reason he said he loved
[1:00:26] fatherhood because he was a father he
[1:00:29] didn't he didn't he didn't because he
[1:00:31] didn't just he didn't just think it but
[1:00:33] he was one he was already a father but
[1:00:36] be so he could express himself as a
[1:00:38] father he had to come forth and express
[1:00:42] himself and express himself through and
[1:00:45] become a son of man and they're here
[1:00:48] just to give a a a identification or or
[1:00:52] or a a and a knowledge to what god is
[1:00:55] god is eternal and so we realize that
[1:00:59] the duration of god is everlasting it is
[1:01:02] to it is eternal it is it is something
[1:01:05] that you and i in our human beings we
[1:01:07] realize that god has given us an
[1:01:10] allotted time to live there god would
[1:01:13] make a promise that we would live 70
[1:01:15] years old to each and every one of us
[1:01:17] some of us are granted to live above
[1:01:19] that some some we we go by the way of
[1:01:21] the grave prematurely or different ways
[1:01:24] or satan would come and rob us and rob
[1:01:26] us from our time but god is on your
[1:01:30] track to get you to where he wants you
[1:01:32] in time and god is the only one that is
[1:01:35] eternal and so only way that you can be
[1:01:38] eternal is if he is indwelling on the
[1:01:41] inside of you you see there's something
[1:01:44] that is laying there that can identify
[1:01:47] itself with this word eternal and that
[1:01:49] is the gene seed of god that he
[1:01:52] deposited before the foundation of the
[1:01:54] world it is eternal as god is eternal so
[1:01:58] let me say this that if that seed that
[1:02:01] was deposited on the inside of you
[1:02:03] before the foundation of the world and
[1:02:05] he knew when you would come to a place
[1:02:07] of awakening and arise and you would see
[1:02:10] yourself it was a time that you were
[1:02:12] coming you see you could not come in the
[1:02:15] day of luther because it was not your
[1:02:17] time you could not come in the day of
[1:02:18] wesley because it was not your time but
[1:02:21] the reason why that you're here is
[1:02:23] because god is operating in a world
[1:02:26] where all things are known he is
[1:02:28] omnipresent he is omniscient and he is
[1:02:31] omnipotent and everything is happening
[1:02:33] by him and the reason why you live is
[1:02:36] because he lives now let me say this now
[1:02:39] satan is saying that you will be
[1:02:40] destroyed and you'll never overcome but
[1:02:43] the gene seed of god says differently
[1:02:48] the enemy can whisper all kinds of lies
[1:02:51] in your ear as young people and tell you
[1:02:53] that you'll live with this habitat or
[1:02:55] you'll live with this this habit or
[1:02:56] you'll live with this thing in your life
[1:02:58] but the word of god says differently
[1:03:01] about your situation
[1:03:04] but in the realm of eternal
[1:03:07] time it does not exist
[1:03:10] and you remember when brother branham
[1:03:11] would preach the message on perfection i
[1:03:13] i i love how he did this he said now he
[1:03:17] said now this great chain of perfection
[1:03:19] was broke by time space
[1:03:23] perfection was broken by time space
[1:03:27] time came because of sin he said let's
[1:03:29] draw a picture of time he said let's see
[1:03:32] a perfect circle forever and forever
[1:03:34] then oliver wants sin dropped in and put
[1:03:37] a little as my wife calls it a little
[1:03:40] hickey or a little drop in the chain so
[1:03:43] it comes down
[1:03:44] now and eternity continues on but it's
[1:03:47] not in its perfect condition and there's
[1:03:50] a little gap that comes down or breaks
[1:03:52] over this way or goes out this way he
[1:03:54] said god had to do that because satan
[1:03:57] caused it
[1:04:00] the reason why you deal with a time
[1:04:03] being is because satan caused it
[1:04:06] but there is nothing that surprised god
[1:04:11] and it dropped down notice it dropped
[1:04:13] down to a space of time for for the
[1:04:15] trying and the perfecting and for the
[1:04:17] purging of the lost that god by his
[1:04:20] sovereign grace might someday lift that
[1:04:22] little hickey or gap back into the
[1:04:24] perfect circle then she rolls on just
[1:04:27] the same you see now time now time is
[1:04:30] the little loop that loops down jesus
[1:04:32] was from eternity to eternity but he
[1:04:35] stepped into the time spaces made flesh
[1:04:38] and came through here in order to
[1:04:41] sanctify or put a streak of blood all
[1:04:43] across this place
[1:04:45] to redeem it and connect it back with
[1:04:47] god again for all eternity you see
[1:04:50] that's that's all that time is
[1:04:54] now now just to give you a glimpse of
[1:04:57] what or put something to put in your
[1:04:59] imagination to to identify with this
[1:05:02] quote is brother random would talk about
[1:05:04] a perfect circle you would you would
[1:05:06] look maybe you that are married you look
[1:05:08] at your wedding band and you would look
[1:05:10] at it that it's a perfect circle that
[1:05:12] you are identifying that you are going
[1:05:14] to live with this woman till death do us
[1:05:17] part and you're going to live in that
[1:05:18] spot and you're going to watch you're
[1:05:20] you're tied with them throughout all
[1:05:23] eternity but notice what brother branham
[1:05:25] would do he would take and he would say
[1:05:27] that now time came and it caused a gap
[1:05:30] in it and so we would take a perfect
[1:05:33] circle and we would take just a portion
[1:05:35] of that gap out of that perfection and
[1:05:38] brother branham said that it dropped
[1:05:40] down and he said that's what he came to
[1:05:42] do in that little spot of time was to
[1:05:45] put a blood over that time you see there
[1:05:48] in that time we know that before the
[1:05:51] foundation of the world began that the
[1:05:53] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:05:55] the world the reason why you're here
[1:05:57] tonight is because you are attributes of
[1:06:00] him the reason why you understand these
[1:06:02] things is because you are an attribute
[1:06:05] of him and so we realized that before
[1:06:08] you ever got here god knew what was
[1:06:10] going to take place god knew what would
[1:06:12] happen and he would know what would
[1:06:14] happen to you in time he knew what satan
[1:06:17] would cause you to do he knew what satan
[1:06:19] would try to trick you into he knew what
[1:06:21] satan would whisper in your ear but
[1:06:23] before satan can make you believe a lie
[1:06:27] and go out there and be damned by it the
[1:06:29] bible said that he was a lamb slain
[1:06:31] before the foundation of the world so
[1:06:33] the blood in god's mind was already over
[1:06:36] top of the surprise that satan thought
[1:06:39] that he was going to work over on the
[1:06:41] children of god before satan could ever
[1:06:43] begin the blood was over top of time
[1:06:51] now notice now god does not operate god
[1:06:54] does not operate by time because god is
[1:06:56] eternal but you and i operate by time
[1:07:00] god is not in chaos but without you and
[1:07:03] i having the ability to look at a clock
[1:07:06] or to look at a calendar and to look at
[1:07:08] a schedule we would have utter chaos
[1:07:10] because you and i operate
[1:07:13] by time
[1:07:16] the reason the reason why we have a set
[1:07:18] schedule you you come to church at seven
[1:07:21] o'clock
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:27] seven o'clock
[1:07:29] is because there is a schedule to get
[1:07:32] you out of the chaos of laodicea and to
[1:07:36] get you into the schedule of god's
[1:07:38] ordained plan for you to be in the house
[1:07:42] of god and it's more than a custom
[1:07:44] but we're working by a schedule to bring
[1:07:48] all of the chaos your whole week has
[1:07:50] been in chaos but what happens about six
[1:07:54] o'clock or maybe early in the morning
[1:07:57] you're realizing that time is coming to
[1:07:59] a spot that you are called to go to a
[1:08:03] place that you were destined to go
[1:08:05] because of time
[1:08:08] because of time it's the way that it is
[1:08:11] there is a set up time for you to get
[1:08:13] your deliverance there's a set up time
[1:08:16] for you to be free there's a set of time
[1:08:18] for you to hear the word of god
[1:08:22] we operate by schedules we operate by
[1:08:24] calendars we operate and we plan things
[1:08:27] around time because in the realm of
[1:08:30] humanity timing is necessary
[1:08:35] timing is necessary if you're trying to
[1:08:37] plan out your day
[1:08:38] timing is necessary if if if we would
[1:08:41] want to wish somebody a happy birthday
[1:08:44] we would do it in perfect time and just
[1:08:46] like today is brother stephen short's
[1:08:48] birthday we want to wish you a very
[1:08:50] happy birthday today god bless you
[1:08:51] brother stephen
[1:08:55] brother heaven mays had one this week we
[1:08:57] say god bless you happy birthday but if
[1:08:59] we would want to wish somebody a very
[1:09:02] happy birthday and we realize that today
[1:09:05] is their birthday
[1:09:07] but if we waited two months
[1:09:09] to and we know that we're two months
[1:09:12] late and we would go say hey you know
[1:09:14] what i want to wish you a very happy
[1:09:16] birthday you know god has laid it on my
[1:09:18] heart that just today's gonna be a very
[1:09:21] special day and that person look at you
[1:09:23] say hey man you missed my birthday about
[1:09:24] two months ago it's nice that you cared
[1:09:27] but you miss the time you see they miss
[1:09:30] the mark it's like me getting up in here
[1:09:32] and singing jingle bells
[1:09:34] in the middle of august or july or
[1:09:36] something like that i am missing the
[1:09:38] timing i ain't gonna be singing jingle
[1:09:40] bells anytime soon from the pulpit
[1:09:44] but to bring to your attention the
[1:09:46] timing would be off if i started singing
[1:09:48] christmas songs right here in the midst
[1:09:50] of this you'd say hey what world is he
[1:09:53] living in my timing is off it's just
[1:09:56] like maybe let me put it in let me put
[1:09:57] it into into a perspective for you if i
[1:10:00] would hear that you needed five dollars
[1:10:03] and you didn't get your paycheck till
[1:10:05] friday but you needed five dollars so
[1:10:07] that you could put gas in your tank so
[1:10:09] that you could go to work and get your
[1:10:11] paycheck so that you could deposit or
[1:10:13] maybe you needed five dollars go buy you
[1:10:15] a nasty cheeseburger down down to
[1:10:17] mcdonald's where they mess up your order
[1:10:19] and everything else but you needed that
[1:10:20] five dollars go get that nasty
[1:10:22] cheeseburger i'm not i'm not against
[1:10:23] mcdonald's but they against me
[1:10:26] and so
[1:10:30] hallelujah
[1:10:32] but if i gave you that if you told me
[1:10:34] you needed five dollars to go get that
[1:10:36] cheeseburger go get that paycheck now if
[1:10:39] i would go and maybe let's just step out
[1:10:41] in time just for a moment but let's go
[1:10:43] out five or ten years and all of a
[1:10:45] sudden
[1:10:46] 10 years later you're a
[1:10:47] multi-billionaire you're a
[1:10:49] multi-billionaire you've built an empire
[1:10:51] of businesses somebody's saying
[1:10:52] hallelujah talk about me lord jesus
[1:10:58] but you become a multi-billionaire and
[1:11:01] you you become an empire you create an
[1:11:03] empire of businesses and you got
[1:11:05] unlimited wealth and you got a fleet of
[1:11:07] cadillacs you're starting to sound like
[1:11:09] elvis and you got everything in order
[1:11:11] but i would come to you ten years later
[1:11:14] and i would say now look brother i done
[1:11:16] heard i didn't heard that you was in
[1:11:18] need to get five dollars so that you
[1:11:20] could go put some gas in your tank so
[1:11:22] that you could go down and get your
[1:11:25] paycheck or go get you a cheeseburger
[1:11:27] that'll mean something to you and i got
[1:11:29] your five dollars what would happen you
[1:11:31] look at me and say brother you don't
[1:11:33] miss the mark i got my five dollars a
[1:11:35] long time ago and i got a whole lot more
[1:11:37] of that now see this is like
[1:11:40] this is like somebody trying to tell you
[1:11:43] that the days of miracles are done gone
[1:11:45] by they are missing their muck
[1:11:49] that's like people trying to tell you
[1:11:50] that god don't give the holy ghost some
[1:11:52] more they don't miss the mark you have
[1:11:54] done receive a deposit from the holy
[1:11:57] ghost that only he can give you
[1:12:00] you're not missing the mark you're
[1:12:02] exactly in the timing of god and
[1:12:04] everything that you are seeing is
[1:12:07] manifesting because there is a spoken
[1:12:09] word that happened in eternity but it's
[1:12:12] taking place in humanity it's divinity
[1:12:16] that's taking over to put you back into
[1:12:18] heavenly places
[1:12:27] oh come on somebody but notice that god
[1:12:30] doesn't even operate he doesn't even he
[1:12:33] that god operates in the realm of
[1:12:35] eternity but he knows exactly what you
[1:12:38] need in the spot of time
[1:12:41] you see and god doesn't show satan all
[1:12:44] of his timing he doesn't show him his
[1:12:45] plans he doesn't show him how he's going
[1:12:47] to do things
[1:12:49] i just give you an alert that's greater
[1:12:50] than any fox news or whether channel app
[1:12:53] notification is coming by your way god
[1:12:55] does not show satan all of his timing
[1:13:00] you can receive that as a blessing or a
[1:13:02] curse but god does not show satan
[1:13:05] everything in his time and just like
[1:13:07] when lazarus had been dead for four days
[1:13:11] in the realm of humanity it looked like
[1:13:13] jesus had done miss the mark
[1:13:15] but in eternity he was right on time
[1:13:18] because he knew
[1:13:20] he knew that there would be people that
[1:13:22] maybe had been gone past their day of
[1:13:24] grace maybe they've done bid dead for
[1:13:26] days maybe they didn't give up on god
[1:13:28] four five six years ago but god is a god
[1:13:32] of first chances that god has second
[1:13:34] chances a god a third and fourth he's a
[1:13:37] god that is rich in mercy
[1:13:39] and god you and i operate in a world of
[1:13:42] time and we would think that we've done
[1:13:44] missed it but god is a god
[1:13:46] yes he's a good god yes he's a god of
[1:13:48] judgment but god is obligated to his
[1:13:51] word and he's got to come by every
[1:13:54] single one of your way
[1:13:55] it might look like you don't turn them
[1:13:57] down but god is obligated to come by
[1:14:00] your way
[1:14:05] he's obligated
[1:14:07] and he's showing himself
[1:14:09] when he stepped in
[1:14:11] and he took on
[1:14:13] the realm of humanity
[1:14:16] he took on the realm of
[1:14:18] of humanity
[1:14:20] and he would stand there
[1:14:22] and he would say roll away the stone
[1:14:30] and he would speak
[1:14:33] he would speak in a realm
[1:14:37] that every devil would know
[1:14:40] that this is him
[1:14:42] he would speak into a world
[1:14:44] that even though lazarus was in a whole
[1:14:47] other dimension and fellowshipping with
[1:14:50] the saints that had done going on he
[1:14:52] spoke
[1:14:58] he took him from a spot
[1:15:01] he took him from a spot
[1:15:03] that that that there he was
[1:15:05] fellowshipping
[1:15:06] and he brings him back
[1:15:08] into a lot of space of time to show that
[1:15:12] he had the power over death
[1:15:15] hell and the grave
[1:15:17] you know that that up in heaven god was
[1:15:21] eternal and he could not show up there
[1:15:23] in the corridors of heaven that he had
[1:15:26] the power over death hell and a grave
[1:15:28] but he came and robed himself in the
[1:15:31] ropes of humanity and he stepped into a
[1:15:34] time body and eternity began to manifest
[1:15:37] that this was him this was the same one
[1:15:41] that spoke back there in the very
[1:15:43] beginning and said let there be it was
[1:15:45] the same one that spoke to lazarus and
[1:15:48] said lazarus come forth he was the same
[1:15:50] voice nature had to recognize that the
[1:15:53] atoms and the elements had to give way
[1:15:56] this was the son of man that was
[1:15:58] speaking and this is what is happening
[1:16:00] in this day when you watch more than
[1:16:02] squirrels come into existence when you
[1:16:04] watch more than storms be spoken into
[1:16:06] existence when you watch more than
[1:16:07] tumors we spoke off you watch as sun
[1:16:11] start calling prodigals
[1:16:13] it's a time and the time is at hand for
[1:16:16] the prodigal to return
[1:16:19] [Applause]
[1:16:23] it's time that all the prodigal start
[1:16:25] looking at the enemy say hey i changed
[1:16:27] my mind
[1:16:28] i gave up
[1:16:30] i gave up all of that life for this it's
[1:16:32] time to get your head out of the hog pin
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:46] the church can't understand this
[1:16:49] the church world can't understand this
[1:16:53] why
[1:16:54] they missed their day
[1:16:57] they missed their day of visitation
[1:16:59] and they're living
[1:17:01] off of the glare
[1:17:03] of days gone by
[1:17:06] but not you
[1:17:08] you're a different people
[1:17:10] you've got a different covenant over top
[1:17:11] of you you've got a different promise
[1:17:13] over top of you
[1:17:15] this is the time
[1:17:16] this is the time of the pouring out of
[1:17:18] the holy ghost this is the time the
[1:17:20] visions come back this is the time that
[1:17:22] prophets come back in visions and in
[1:17:25] dreams and the pouring out of the holy
[1:17:27] ghost it's a time of fulfillment when
[1:17:29] you watch brother branham when he is
[1:17:31] standing there in the junction of time
[1:17:32] and he starts grabbing over in job
[1:17:34] chapter 2 and joe in acts chapter 2 he
[1:17:37] said it's amazing it's amazing that
[1:17:40] these writers put it and identified over
[1:17:43] in the chapter two it was a time for
[1:17:45] fulfillment
[1:17:48] that which was laying there had laid
[1:17:50] there for thousands or hundreds of years
[1:17:52] was now coming to a time of fulfillment
[1:17:57] humanity can get upset because they look
[1:17:59] at the things that they see more than
[1:18:02] the things that they that they realize
[1:18:04] that promises are laying there i just
[1:18:06] want to tell you don't look at the clock
[1:18:08] look at the promise
[1:18:12] don't look at your situation look at the
[1:18:15] promise don't look at your schedule what
[1:18:17] you've got figured out on how this one's
[1:18:19] going to come how that one's going to
[1:18:21] come stop putting god in a box
[1:18:23] i would have liked to have woke you up a
[1:18:25] long time ago but now
[1:18:28] and now it's a time to arise over all
[1:18:30] that sleepless and awaken for this is
[1:18:32] your time
[1:18:35] you say well i got a certain date over
[1:18:36] top of me when god gave the holy ghost
[1:18:39] it's for you
[1:18:40] it's for you if you just stop rejecting
[1:18:42] it it's already in his timing for you to
[1:18:45] get the baptism of the holy ghost it's
[1:18:47] in his timing for you to get a
[1:18:48] pentecostal blessing it's in his timing
[1:18:51] for you to get the rapturing faith it's
[1:18:53] in his timing but if you could wake up
[1:18:55] to watch that this is christ
[1:19:01] hallelujah
[1:19:05] it's him
[1:19:07] and there's none more
[1:19:08] great than him he is the author and he
[1:19:11] is the finisher of our faith
[1:19:13] and we're watching him work through
[1:19:15] humanity
[1:19:20] i'm not trying to preach to you some
[1:19:22] pious guy i'm not trying to tell you
[1:19:24] something of days gone by or something
[1:19:25] that's coming you're here
[1:19:27] you're here you remember when when there
[1:19:29] was in daniel chapter two that there was
[1:19:32] a king that had a dream and he had asked
[1:19:35] he had asked all of the the the
[1:19:37] physicians or the magicians in that day
[1:19:39] and all the magis and the wise men why
[1:19:41] don't you come why don't you come and
[1:19:44] and tell me what i dreamed and you
[1:19:46] remember their conversation back with
[1:19:47] the king and they said now can you tell
[1:19:49] us your dream and you will tell you what
[1:19:52] it means he said no you tell me what it
[1:19:54] means or you tell me what i dreamed and
[1:19:56] then you tell me what it means or i'm
[1:19:58] gonna kill all of you you had put them
[1:20:01] in a spot of desperation and these men
[1:20:03] realized that they didn't have the goods
[1:20:05] to dissolve all of his doubts
[1:20:08] but there just like in daniel chapter 5
[1:20:11] when it was with belshazzar notice the
[1:20:13] same one was operating with
[1:20:15] nebuchadnezzar and a different kingdom
[1:20:17] over in belshazzar when there was a
[1:20:19] handwriting on the wall there was a
[1:20:21] little lady that said hey don't you be
[1:20:24] upset about all these things there is a
[1:20:26] dissolver of doubts that is in the land
[1:20:28] and i want to tell you that there's a
[1:20:30] lady that is standing up in this hour
[1:20:32] all of your questions can be settled
[1:20:34] there is a dissolver of doubts that is
[1:20:36] in the land again he won't just tell
[1:20:38] your dream he'll tell you what your life
[1:20:40] means you got a purpose man you got a
[1:20:43] purpose young lady
[1:20:46] the dissolver of the doubts is the holy
[1:20:48] ghost
[1:20:54] but what did daniel say when he went up
[1:20:56] there notice what he did he went up
[1:20:57] there in daniel chapter two you can go
[1:20:59] back and read it and see if i'm right on
[1:21:01] this or not but notice what he did he
[1:21:03] went up there with his friends and they
[1:21:05] entered in and desired to seek the lord
[1:21:09] over this dream
[1:21:12] the prophet wasn't alone
[1:21:14] there was a purpose ahead
[1:21:17] there was deliverance at hand
[1:21:19] notice
[1:21:20] notice if daniel doesn't go in there in
[1:21:24] a place of time and bring down eternity
[1:21:27] the king is going to kill all of them
[1:21:30] but because there was a people that had
[1:21:32] gathered themselves around the prophet
[1:21:36] they had been up there praying and the
[1:21:38] bible said that god the lord came to him
[1:21:41] in a night vision and he spoke to him
[1:21:43] these things and daniel said blessed is
[1:21:46] the lord most high and he began to say
[1:21:48] that you o lord changes the time changes
[1:21:51] the times and the seasons you make men
[1:21:54] and kingdoms to rise and you make
[1:21:56] kingdoms to fall
[1:21:59] so there is nothing that can be removed
[1:22:02] and there's nothing that can be set up
[1:22:04] it's daniel 2 and 21 if you want to go
[1:22:06] and read it don't read it right now i'm
[1:22:07] trying to preach to you
[1:22:10] but here you watch it that he here he is
[1:22:12] that notice he removes the kingdom so
[1:22:15] that he can set up a kingdom so there is
[1:22:17] nothing that is removed without there
[1:22:19] something to be coming getting already
[1:22:21] set up
[1:22:24] god's got a plan
[1:22:27] and you need to say this i'm in it
[1:22:31] you may not understand this timing you
[1:22:33] may not understand why you're going
[1:22:34] through what you're going through but
[1:22:35] you need to identify yourself that
[1:22:37] you're in his plan
[1:22:39] there is nothing that is removed
[1:22:41] and there is nothing that is set up
[1:22:43] unless it comes from almighty god
[1:22:46] knowing about it
[1:22:47] now notice let me let me bring this to
[1:22:50] you in a level of modern day where we're
[1:22:54] watching
[1:22:55] events become clear
[1:22:57] by prophecy there could not be a removal
[1:22:59] of a trump don't get political on me
[1:23:01] right now i'm i'm too fired up to get
[1:23:04] political with you i could care less
[1:23:06] what you think about politics politics
[1:23:08] is of the devil i'm quoting a prophet
[1:23:10] and we realize that those kingdoms will
[1:23:12] come to an end but notice there could
[1:23:14] not be a removal of a trump
[1:23:18] unless there was something in god's mind
[1:23:21] to set up abiding
[1:23:25] notice what happened on that
[1:23:27] inauguration day you watched as prophecy
[1:23:30] rolled right into time you thought it
[1:23:33] was happening maybe years ago and you
[1:23:35] watched it as it stood there in that
[1:23:37] royal purple
[1:23:39] see america's been sold out to purple a
[1:23:42] long time ago and now you're watching
[1:23:44] that dragon and that beast rise in power
[1:23:48] we got more catholicism in america than
[1:23:51] we've ever had because america sold out
[1:23:53] a birthright
[1:23:57] but that didn't surprise god with all
[1:23:59] the communism and all the colonism and
[1:24:01] all of these isms down through there
[1:24:03] this bride is not built upon isms
[1:24:07] there is no schism amongst the pride
[1:24:09] there is only a unity of the power of
[1:24:11] the holy ghost that was set up before
[1:24:14] time ever began
[1:24:15] [Applause]
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:24] there could not be a removal
[1:24:26] of your first birth
[1:24:28] unless there was something in the plan
[1:24:30] of god to set up a new birth
[1:24:33] there could not come a fall of a kingdom
[1:24:35] unless there had been one arising
[1:24:38] the reason why you pushed satan off of
[1:24:40] his throne was because there was a deep
[1:24:42] calling to the deep
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:48] i go to church all my life i've heard
[1:24:50] these things all my life brother andrew
[1:24:51] i've been in church i grew up in church
[1:24:53] i've heard the sunday school lessons
[1:24:55] i've heard all of these things i know
[1:24:58] between right and wrong then do it
[1:25:07] you can change your hair
[1:25:09] and that won't fix you
[1:25:11] you can change your dress and that won't
[1:25:13] they won't fix you
[1:25:14] you can take off your makeup
[1:25:20] now let me drop this right here
[1:25:22] that that that you're sitting there you
[1:25:24] can take off your makeup and you can and
[1:25:26] you can call yourself a christian but if
[1:25:29] you got to make up heading back here in
[1:25:30] the corner just for a rainy day
[1:25:33] but watch them rainy days you put that
[1:25:35] makeup on everybody gonna know you got
[1:25:36] it you go to crime one good time you'll
[1:25:38] watch that thing wash off of you i'm not
[1:25:40] here to preach to you about a makeup but
[1:25:41] i'm talking about a makeup of the soul
[1:25:44] but notice you can change your makeup
[1:25:47] you can take off your makeup you can
[1:25:48] take off your you can take your weave
[1:25:50] out of your hair you can change your
[1:25:51] color your hair you can change your
[1:25:53] residence but it does not change the
[1:25:55] person that's living there
[1:25:57] you can take a bad driver and put him in
[1:25:59] a brand new car he's still a bad driver
[1:26:01] because you never took his habits away
[1:26:04] he's still a bad driver just like a man
[1:26:06] one time he was driving down the road he
[1:26:09] was driving down the road and he was a
[1:26:10] taxi driver and he picked up his lady on
[1:26:12] the side of the street and she got in
[1:26:14] there told him where she wanted to go to
[1:26:15] and all of a sudden while they was going
[1:26:17] down the middle of the road she reached
[1:26:18] up here and tapped the taxi driver on
[1:26:20] his shoulder and wanted to tell him
[1:26:21] something all of a sudden that taxi
[1:26:23] driver run off the side road ran into a
[1:26:25] curb he erected into a building ran into
[1:26:28] all kinds of different things he went
[1:26:29] over this way and went over that way and
[1:26:31] finally when he come to a halt they're
[1:26:32] both sitting there taxi driver and a
[1:26:34] lady in the back hey just they're just
[1:26:36] breathing hard as a kid thinking man
[1:26:38] alive we just made it through happy
[1:26:39] happy are we happy here we and she said
[1:26:42] sir i want to apologize to you if i'd
[1:26:44] have known that tapping you on the
[1:26:46] shoulder would have caused a wreck like
[1:26:48] this i'd have never done it he said
[1:26:50] ma'am it's not your fault my last job
[1:26:52] was a hurt driver
[1:26:56] you see you can change cars but if you
[1:26:59] don't change your mentality and you
[1:27:00] don't change your heart you're never
[1:27:02] going nowhere you'll still drive the
[1:27:04] same way you'll still operate the same
[1:27:06] way you'll still have the same kind of a
[1:27:08] thinking you'll think there's a dead man
[1:27:09] that's hanging on to you but when you
[1:27:11] are a new man the old man has been put
[1:27:13] off and you put on the new man
[1:27:17] you don't think like an old man you
[1:27:19] don't drive like the old man you don't
[1:27:20] talk like the old man the old man is
[1:27:22] gone and the new man has put on faith
[1:27:25] has put on virtue has put on all of
[1:27:28] these fruits of the spirit and you
[1:27:30] mortify the deeds of your flesh why
[1:27:32] because you killed the old man
[1:27:35] if the old man starts tapping you on the
[1:27:37] shoulder it shows that you got more to
[1:27:39] kill out
[1:27:43] but thank god he's given you a time to
[1:27:46] make it right
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:55] we're glory
[1:27:58] hallelujah
[1:28:01] since i laid
[1:28:03] that old man down
[1:28:06] i buried him
[1:28:08] in the name of jesus and he ain't
[1:28:11] getting up out of that ground
[1:28:14] [Applause]
[1:28:17] now notice what what what the prophet
[1:28:19] isaiah would say in isaiah chapter 55 my
[1:28:22] thoughts are not your thoughts and my
[1:28:24] ways are not your ways the only way that
[1:28:26] you can think his way is to have the
[1:28:29] very mind of christ but notice what he
[1:28:31] would say when you go down and find it
[1:28:33] down in verse 10 and verse 11 so shall
[1:28:36] my word be that goeth forth out of my
[1:28:38] mouth he will prosper in the thing that
[1:28:40] i sent it to do and it will bring to
[1:28:42] pass it will bring to pass all that i
[1:28:45] have written of it to do
[1:28:46] notice in the element of time you were
[1:28:50] predestinated before the foundation but
[1:28:52] in the element of time you are
[1:28:54] expressing the bible word
[1:29:04] just like 2 000 years ago
[1:29:06] it looked like there was never going to
[1:29:07] be a removal
[1:29:09] of the fall
[1:29:10] off of mankind
[1:29:12] off of humanity but at the fulfillment
[1:29:15] of time all the prophecies hooked in one
[1:29:18] man
[1:29:18] for the setting up of a new kingdom
[1:29:22] for the setting up of a new kingdom they
[1:29:23] come arise they come a fall and they
[1:29:25] come around
[1:29:26] and there has to be of one kicking off
[1:29:28] the old serpent of the heart
[1:29:32] and it has to come a dove
[1:29:34] come and land
[1:29:36] on the throne room
[1:29:38] but he won't land there
[1:29:41] if you still got a wolf nature
[1:29:45] if you're always barking at everything
[1:29:49] you always barking about this and
[1:29:51] barking about that one how was she just
[1:29:54] better than that
[1:29:57] don't you know she's been fixing her
[1:29:58] hair like that for the last 20 years
[1:30:02] get a new style if you're always barking
[1:30:04] at something it shows that there's still
[1:30:06] a nature on the inside of you
[1:30:09] and that holy spirit can fly all around
[1:30:13] he can get on your loved ones he can get
[1:30:15] on your neighbors and you'll think why
[1:30:17] in the world any landing on me why
[1:30:20] because you still got a wolf nature
[1:30:23] he's afraid that you bited him
[1:30:27] like that's what the bible said over in
[1:30:29] ezekiel 36 i believe it's 36-27 that
[1:30:33] that god has come to give you a new
[1:30:35] spirit and then he places a new spirit
[1:30:38] and then his holy spirit comes on top of
[1:30:40] you brother branham said that he'd give
[1:30:41] you a new spirit so that you could get
[1:30:43] along with the holy ghost when he come
[1:30:47] can you imagine the audacity of man
[1:30:50] barking at the holy ghost
[1:30:54] i don't know about that brother hey just
[1:30:56] go down to the local church you'll see
[1:30:58] them barking at one another because they
[1:31:00] can't live right
[1:31:02] they've got the rules set up that this
[1:31:04] is the way things are going to go
[1:31:06] or you're getting a boot
[1:31:10] the reason why the local church has to
[1:31:12] boot so many preachers out of the pulpit
[1:31:14] is because
[1:31:17] they ain't got nothing they can live by
[1:31:24] lord you got me into this
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:29] well
[1:31:32] so far
[1:31:34] all this is about fresh as it gets
[1:31:39] i guess that's what three years of
[1:31:40] building will do for you
[1:31:43] notice what he did
[1:31:45] he come into a space of time
[1:31:48] to redeem those
[1:31:50] that were his
[1:31:53] because of the fall because of the fall
[1:31:55] you became in a fallen state and adam
[1:31:58] looked right adam did the job but
[1:32:01] because of direct disobedience to the
[1:32:04] very word of god he was not entitled to
[1:32:06] the token life
[1:32:09] because he deliberately walked out
[1:32:13] he disobeyed god and he walked out
[1:32:15] but notice what he does christ does in
[1:32:18] this day
[1:32:19] he comes to redeem all those
[1:32:22] that are his
[1:32:24] you see before
[1:32:26] you fell
[1:32:28] before you got trapped into it before
[1:32:30] you came in your first birth
[1:32:33] you are already his
[1:32:37] how do you say those words i am his i am
[1:32:40] his
[1:32:41] but notice what he did because you were
[1:32:43] his and the devil put you in his pawn
[1:32:46] shop
[1:32:48] and said that you were his
[1:32:50] there came a good man that walked in
[1:32:52] there and took you off the shelf
[1:32:54] because you were already his you don't
[1:32:57] have to pay for it you don't have to go
[1:32:59] in there and sign for anything else walk
[1:33:01] out
[1:33:03] just walk out of that pawn shop don't
[1:33:05] let the devil lie to you no more don't
[1:33:07] let him whisper in your ear no more walk
[1:33:10] out of the pawn shop you ain't got to
[1:33:12] pay for your sin you ain't got to build
[1:33:14] up something you ain't got to work up
[1:33:15] something you're already free
[1:33:17] there's been a price put on you you have
[1:33:20] been bought with the blood of the lamb
[1:33:22] not born of a corruptible seed but of an
[1:33:24] incorruptible seed just like when boaz
[1:33:27] looked out there and he seen a fair
[1:33:29] woman out there
[1:33:32] boaz looked out there and said that is
[1:33:34] my wife
[1:33:37] she may not have looked at it she may
[1:33:38] not look like it in that state but i
[1:33:41] want you to know when he went down there
[1:33:43] and redeemed naomi's estate he got ruth
[1:33:47] in it
[1:33:49] and when he went down there ruth was no
[1:33:51] longer known as ruth the moabitess she
[1:33:54] was known as boaz's wife
[1:33:57] boaz means in him is strength in him is
[1:34:01] virtue in him is power
[1:34:05] he she is no longer known as ruth
[1:34:08] as ruth that walked with naomi as ruth
[1:34:11] as roof as the wife of melion but she
[1:34:14] was known
[1:34:16] as the wife of boaz
[1:34:19] her first marriage had been stricken off
[1:34:22] and there was an invisible union that
[1:34:24] had took him place when he said you wait
[1:34:26] here while i go down there and do the
[1:34:29] kinsmen redeeming work
[1:34:32] and he went down there and made a public
[1:34:34] display and he kicked off his shoe and
[1:34:37] saying i am paying for her she is
[1:34:39] rightfully mine
[1:34:41] is there anybody is there anybody that's
[1:34:44] a closer kin that can raise up but there
[1:34:46] was somebody that didn't want to mar
[1:34:48] their testimony
[1:34:50] and brother branham said there was one
[1:34:52] that was closer there was one that was
[1:34:54] closer by your first birth but by your
[1:34:57] second birth
[1:35:02] you identified what fishbowl has
[1:35:06] you go to studying out boaz boaz means
[1:35:08] strength boaz means in him is virtue in
[1:35:10] him is power
[1:35:12] and you go and look over in solomon's
[1:35:14] temple that it is one of the columns or
[1:35:17] the pillars of the brazen or the brazen
[1:35:19] pillars that is set up in solomon's
[1:35:21] temple that is over on the left-hand
[1:35:23] side of the temple it's 18 cubits high
[1:35:25] and it is placed there as a strength
[1:35:30] what does the book of revelation say
[1:35:32] about him that overcometh i will place
[1:35:35] as a pillar
[1:35:36] as a pillar and you are not somebody
[1:35:39] that can be pushed off there is a
[1:35:41] strength
[1:35:42] the church age was in no strength at its
[1:35:45] time but there was an overcomer that had
[1:35:47] tapped into a resource of strength
[1:35:51] and in the time element
[1:35:53] boaz stepped in
[1:35:55] i said this is mine
[1:35:57] i am worthy enough to pay for it
[1:36:00] i'm worthy enough to call it mine
[1:36:02] and what did he say in this age i'll no
[1:36:04] longer call you church but i'll call
[1:36:06] your bride so you might understand it
[1:36:13] but now you notice
[1:36:15] now you notice this
[1:36:18] here
[1:36:19] in the unveiling of time
[1:36:22] he come to show himself
[1:36:24] and to show himself
[1:36:27] christ in full view to the church
[1:36:30] but notice notice what what the prophet
[1:36:32] does
[1:36:34] in revelation of jesus he said the greek
[1:36:36] word for revelation is apocalypse
[1:36:38] which means unveiling this unveiling is
[1:36:40] perfectly described in the example of a
[1:36:42] sculptor unveiling his work of statuary
[1:36:46] exposing it to the onlooker so so here
[1:36:49] you can imagine you can imagine that
[1:36:51] maybe we would have a statue
[1:36:54] of what's whatever maybe a statue of a
[1:36:57] person or maybe a statue of a
[1:36:59] confederate soldier or different things
[1:37:01] but you could guess that it all you want
[1:37:03] to
[1:37:04] because a sheet is over top of it and
[1:37:06] you can't see well i can see that it
[1:37:08] kind of looks it kind of looks like a
[1:37:09] man behind it but you don't really know
[1:37:11] you're just guessing at it
[1:37:13] but notice when the sheet is pulled off
[1:37:15] of it and he exposes himself to the
[1:37:18] onlooker you can look at the work that
[1:37:20] is done by the master you can say that
[1:37:23] is him
[1:37:24] you can see that that that's exactly
[1:37:26] what i thought it was and that is what
[1:37:29] he has been doing in this hour as
[1:37:30] revealing himself as jesus christ is
[1:37:33] saying yesterday today and forever that
[1:37:35] that maybe you thought that that was him
[1:37:37] you watch anybody that come out of a
[1:37:39] trinitary background and come over here
[1:37:41] and realize that jesus is god
[1:37:43] they'll go back in their mind and think
[1:37:46] man life that was him all that time you
[1:37:49] know i kind of thought that that was him
[1:37:51] but now i see that it's him it's no
[1:37:53] longer guessing at it but that was him
[1:37:55] that was him that put the groceries on
[1:37:57] your porch when you didn't have the
[1:37:58] money to do it it was him that kept that
[1:38:00] car from wrecking into you he was him
[1:38:02] that was there he exposes himself to the
[1:38:05] onlooker and blessed are your eyes for
[1:38:08] you see and blessed are your ears for
[1:38:10] you here
[1:38:13] notice
[1:38:14] man had always wanted to get a glimpse
[1:38:17] of god
[1:38:18] and when moses was the was the prophet
[1:38:21] of the law
[1:38:22] and moses wanted to get a glimpse of him
[1:38:27] what did he do
[1:38:29] god hid him over in the clip of the rock
[1:38:33] he hit him in the cliff of the rock and
[1:38:36] there he began to watch behind part of a
[1:38:39] man as he was walking what was he seeing
[1:38:42] he was watching and he caught a glimpse
[1:38:44] of him walking away the hind part the
[1:38:47] back part of a man but notice what has
[1:38:49] been revealed to you in this hour you go
[1:38:51] in the book of revelations chapter one
[1:38:53] and you'll see that you are seeing
[1:38:55] christ face to face you can look and you
[1:38:57] can see the seven personages of jesus
[1:38:59] christ laying right there in the very
[1:39:02] first book of revelations it's not open
[1:39:05] to everybody
[1:39:06] they'll look at it and say man what was
[1:39:09] john eaton when he started writing that
[1:39:11] down but you look at that and you see
[1:39:14] the symbol that this is him that is
[1:39:16] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[1:39:18] candlesticks
[1:39:21] notice
[1:39:22] what was he doing
[1:39:24] moses was catching a glimpse
[1:39:26] of where he was going
[1:39:29] just where he was going
[1:39:31] he was catching a glimpse of where
[1:39:33] he was going where he was hitting but
[1:39:36] notice in this hour you're not just
[1:39:38] watching where he's going you're seeing
[1:39:40] where he's at
[1:39:42] you're not just looking into the future
[1:39:44] you look back and you see that's been
[1:39:46] him through the prophets that's been him
[1:39:48] i see him working a future work in our
[1:39:51] future home and setting it up but this
[1:39:54] is him that is setting up this kingdom
[1:39:56] that is showing this is him you're not
[1:39:58] just looking at the back part of the man
[1:40:00] and seeing where he's going he is taking
[1:40:02] you with him
[1:40:13] my goodness
[1:40:16] this is
[1:40:18] the time
[1:40:21] this is the time of the unfolding
[1:40:23] and the unveiling
[1:40:24] that this
[1:40:26] this is him
[1:40:28] you remember when brother branham
[1:40:29] excuse me
[1:40:31] my brother branham is there
[1:40:34] and he's out there early in the morning
[1:40:36] and i i'm setting something up for you
[1:40:40] when brother branham was out there early
[1:40:41] early one morning and it's he said it
[1:40:43] was a cloudy foggy day
[1:40:46] and he said
[1:40:47] he looked and there was those three
[1:40:49] rainbows you remember
[1:40:50] there's some three rainbows out there
[1:40:52] and he said it was something attracting
[1:40:53] me what no sun out there that could have
[1:40:55] caused that but something was attracting
[1:40:56] me to it
[1:40:58] and when he began to get so close to it
[1:41:00] that the angel said now that's close
[1:41:02] enough
[1:41:03] and then he started to speak that
[1:41:05] jehovah of the old testament is jesus
[1:41:08] christ of the new
[1:41:10] notice notice he said that was a
[1:41:12] confirmation of my message of him this
[1:41:16] is not a message of a man this is not a
[1:41:18] message of uh of of of of a prophet this
[1:41:22] is not a message of william branham this
[1:41:24] is a message of him and what is it it is
[1:41:27] a message and the time is at hand if god
[1:41:30] if there was no people that would have
[1:41:32] been ready to receive it there had been
[1:41:34] no message come forth but because there
[1:41:36] was a people that was on the land at a
[1:41:39] predestinated time and the time was at
[1:41:41] hand because there was a people ready to
[1:41:44] receive it he could come forth and show
[1:41:47] himself and the reason why he did was
[1:41:49] because it's a deep calling to the deep
[1:41:54] the time
[1:41:55] was
[1:41:56] at hand
[1:41:58] but notice notice in daniel chapter 12
[1:42:00] look look just for a moment i i hope i'm
[1:42:03] not wearing you out
[1:42:07] i believe i'm preaching a message preach
[1:42:09] uh believers
[1:42:10] you are preachers
[1:42:12] and your own ranks in your own home
[1:42:15] but i believe i'm preaching the message
[1:42:16] believers
[1:42:19] i'm not preaching something to you over
[1:42:20] top of your head i'm preaching to you
[1:42:22] exactly what the message is
[1:42:24] and if you feel like i'm preaching over
[1:42:25] top of you is because you've not spent
[1:42:27] enough time
[1:42:28] in this message but if you'll spend your
[1:42:30] time digging into this you'll find that
[1:42:32] this is him and this is the time of
[1:42:35] releasal but look in daniel chapter 12
[1:42:37] with me verse 1 and at the time shall
[1:42:39] michael stand up the great prince which
[1:42:42] stands for the children of thy people
[1:42:43] and there shall be a time of trouble
[1:42:46] such as never was since there was a
[1:42:48] nation even that's even to that same
[1:42:51] time and at that time thy people shall
[1:42:53] be delivered every one that shall be
[1:42:56] found
[1:42:57] written in the book and many of them
[1:42:59] that slip in the dust
[1:43:01] of the earth shall awake some of the
[1:43:03] everlasting some to everlasting life and
[1:43:05] some to shame and everlasting contempt
[1:43:07] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[1:43:10] brightness of the firmament and they
[1:43:12] that turn many to righteousness as it
[1:43:14] starts forever and ever but thou o
[1:43:16] daniel shut up the words and seal the
[1:43:19] book even to the time of the end many
[1:43:23] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[1:43:26] be increased lotus what we are living in
[1:43:29] and what we are looking at is that the
[1:43:31] book of daniel shows that god is coming
[1:43:34] to the jews but if you look it is
[1:43:37] perfectly identified with revelations
[1:43:39] chapter 10 that the mighty angel stands
[1:43:42] up but here in the book of revelation it
[1:43:45] shows that god is coming to the gentiles
[1:43:48] but notice what is it he always comes
[1:43:52] at the time of trouble
[1:43:55] and you're going to look it out on the
[1:43:56] land just for a second you ain't got to
[1:43:58] spend much time and you are living
[1:44:01] in a time of trouble but it's in the
[1:44:03] time of trouble that michael stood up
[1:44:06] which is christ in angelic form
[1:44:08] and notice in this day there we see the
[1:44:12] mighty angel standing and putting his
[1:44:14] foot on the land of sea the land and the
[1:44:16] sea and his feet were as a pillar of
[1:44:18] fires notice that is his body
[1:44:23] that pillar fire has been swooping and
[1:44:26] sweeping over your life and protecting
[1:44:28] you for such a time as this
[1:44:32] esther didn't come to the kingdom for
[1:44:34] any other time but this time
[1:44:38] there was a setup of a kingdom so that
[1:44:41] she could be a queen and this is your
[1:44:43] time
[1:44:45] young people this is your moment
[1:44:47] this is your hour to set up not an
[1:44:49] earthly kingdom but a spiritual kingdom
[1:44:51] notice what the disciples were always
[1:44:53] asking him he said at this time that
[1:44:55] you'll set up your kingdom
[1:44:57] he said it's not for you to know the
[1:44:59] times and the seasons
[1:45:01] notice when you go down to revelations
[1:45:03] chapter 10 and verse 6 you'll notice
[1:45:05] that there he swore he took a sworn
[1:45:08] affidavit there is none greater than god
[1:45:12] so he swore by himself just like when
[1:45:15] you look over in romans chapter 4 that
[1:45:17] he swore by himself
[1:45:19] there was nobody greater so he made a
[1:45:21] sworn after david and he confirmed an
[1:45:23] oath and he swore by himself that time
[1:45:26] would be no longer
[1:45:28] notice notice what he is saying that the
[1:45:30] time of holding back all of these
[1:45:32] mysteries is no longer and it's before
[1:45:35] the people now
[1:45:38] that which that was bound at the door of
[1:45:40] creeds and dogmas has now been released
[1:45:43] to the bride of jesus christ the time is
[1:45:46] here
[1:45:49] notice what david would do
[1:45:51] when david
[1:45:52] was the one that would write
[1:45:54] would write most of the book of psalms
[1:45:58] notice what he did
[1:46:01] he would reach over there
[1:46:04] and having prophetic vision
[1:46:07] and he would reach over there and he
[1:46:08] would write songs
[1:46:11] he didn't know what he was doing but he
[1:46:12] was portraying christ
[1:46:15] he didn't know what he was doing
[1:46:17] he didn't know what he was doing in
[1:46:18] psalms 22. he didn't know what he was
[1:46:20] doing in psalms 23
[1:46:22] but he was portraying christ
[1:46:25] but when he reaches over and it comes
[1:46:27] down to psalms 27
[1:46:30] and the bible said the lord
[1:46:33] is my light
[1:46:36] you watch
[1:46:37] you go back and you can study all the
[1:46:39] history books
[1:46:40] i've done it
[1:46:42] you can go back you can study larkin you
[1:46:44] can study all of these men you can study
[1:46:46] luther you can study wesley when they
[1:46:47] come to the preaching of the rapture all
[1:46:50] of them go to first thessalonians in
[1:46:52] first corinthians 15 they go back there
[1:46:54] and they start preaching the word
[1:46:56] rapture and the word rapture is not even
[1:46:59] found in the bible but it means a
[1:47:01] catching away but here they are david is
[1:47:05] here and he's tapping into a channel and
[1:47:07] he's bringing out an element in time and
[1:47:10] he's bringing and showing it in eternity
[1:47:13] that this is a people that is going to
[1:47:15] say
[1:47:20] this you are
[1:47:22] the people
[1:47:24] there's a lot of people that read psalms
[1:47:26] 27. there's a lot of people that look
[1:47:28] over there's a lot of people that
[1:47:29] identify that this is their favorite
[1:47:31] scripture
[1:47:33] but there's nobody like you
[1:47:38] because you had a prophet
[1:47:40] that would come here
[1:47:42] and he would speak in 1965
[1:47:44] and he would take this thought
[1:47:47] to lace it right in there
[1:47:50] and put it in there
[1:47:52] right before things that are to be
[1:47:57] notice
[1:47:59] he says
[1:48:00] now just a little background
[1:48:03] for this message on
[1:48:04] the rapture
[1:48:06] but the prophet said this is the
[1:48:08] background this is the backdrop
[1:48:13] you know where
[1:48:15] when you go into
[1:48:17] to buy
[1:48:19] a beautiful diamond
[1:48:21] they set it
[1:48:22] on a black canvas
[1:48:24] and they put light over top of it
[1:48:27] to show forth its beauty
[1:48:32] the reason why
[1:48:34] you can sing this psalm is because
[1:48:36] there's a light over top of you
[1:48:40] this light didn't just stop following
[1:48:42] when it was following the children of
[1:48:44] israel when they were coming out in
[1:48:45] exodus chapter 14 in exodus chapter 15
[1:48:48] this light has been following you all
[1:48:50] the days of your life
[1:48:53] and that pillar of fire has been
[1:48:55] circling
[1:48:56] and he's calling his children
[1:48:58] and notice what he's doing he is here to
[1:49:01] usher in
[1:49:03] us right into the rapture
[1:49:06] notice what he's doing he is taking her
[1:49:10] by the arm
[1:49:12] and he's leading her through all of
[1:49:14] these promises
[1:49:16] this is
[1:49:17] your time
[1:49:20] this is your moment
[1:49:22] this is your hour
[1:49:24] notice your backdrop
[1:49:27] look at the chaos that's going on
[1:49:29] look at the concerning scenes that you
[1:49:31] look at on the news
[1:49:33] you can get upset all about the politics
[1:49:35] you can get upset about knitting
[1:49:37] netanyahu getting moved off and you can
[1:49:39] get upset about trump getting moved off
[1:49:40] or you can get upset about biden losing
[1:49:42] his brain you can get upset about all of
[1:49:44] these things
[1:49:46] i'm being i'm being serious here you can
[1:49:48] get upset about these things
[1:49:50] it's an upsetting time
[1:49:52] but this world is not our home
[1:50:07] history is being repeated
[1:50:11] you're watching this chaos
[1:50:15] right here in the midst of all of this
[1:50:16] darkness
[1:50:18] but there's a people that identify
[1:50:22] the lord
[1:50:24] is my light
[1:50:28] the lord
[1:50:30] is my light
[1:50:32] and my salvation
[1:50:35] [Music]
[1:50:37] whom shall i fear
[1:50:41] brother andrew have you looked at this
[1:50:43] chaos of covet have you looked at how
[1:50:46] many
[1:50:47] kobe cases we're seeing are you looking
[1:50:50] are you looking what we're seeing
[1:50:52] i'm not looking at that
[1:50:54] i'm looking up
[1:50:56] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:51:00] whom shall i fear
[1:51:07] the lord
[1:51:08] is my boaz of my life he is my strength
[1:51:14] of whom shall i be afraid
[1:51:16] when the wicked
[1:51:18] even my enemies of my foes came upon me
[1:51:21] to eat up my flesh
[1:51:24] you think kovit's bad there's a plague
[1:51:26] that's coming that they will rot in
[1:51:28] their flesh
[1:51:30] there's something coming a whole lot
[1:51:32] worse than covet there is a plague of
[1:51:34] sin that is over top of this generation
[1:51:37] and the only thing to get out of it is
[1:51:39] the blood of jesus christ
[1:51:46] but when my enemies and my foes come
[1:51:48] upon me to eat upon my flesh they
[1:51:50] stumbled and fell
[1:51:54] when they come to snatch you up when
[1:51:56] they kind of then they tried to come up
[1:51:58] and eat up your experience they stumbled
[1:52:01] and fell
[1:52:02] though in hosts should encamp against me
[1:52:06] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:52:09] rise against me in this will i be
[1:52:12] confident
[1:52:14] i ain't confident in fox news i ain't
[1:52:17] confident in conservative news i ain't
[1:52:19] confident in cnn i ain't confident in
[1:52:22] biden i ain't even coveted in trump i
[1:52:24] ain't confident who you want to be in
[1:52:26] 2024 the only confidence that you can
[1:52:29] have is in the king of kings and the
[1:52:31] lord of lords
[1:52:34] he's come to set up more than a
[1:52:36] presidency he's come to set up a kingdom
[1:52:38] that you would be kings and priests
[1:52:42] in this will i be confident
[1:52:49] you can't be confident in yourself
[1:52:58] when my enemies encamp about me
[1:53:03] this you can be confident in church
[1:53:06] this you can be confident in
[1:53:08] that the angels of the lord
[1:53:11] and camp about them that fear him
[1:53:14] so if the enemy is setting up
[1:53:17] his camp around you he's got more than
[1:53:20] you just to deal with he's got angelic
[1:53:23] beings that are there to war him off
[1:53:26] in this will i be confident that the
[1:53:29] bible said in exodus 23 and 20 that i
[1:53:32] will send my angel before thee to keep
[1:53:35] thee in the way he knew what you would
[1:53:37] go through in laodicea he knew what you
[1:53:40] would face he knew what you go through
[1:53:42] but in this will i be confident
[1:53:46] this message will pick us up and
[1:53:49] translate our bodies we will walk like
[1:53:51] he not walked
[1:53:54] we will take a step like enoch's steps
[1:53:57] we will change like sarah changed
[1:54:05] one thing
[1:54:06] have i desired of the lord that will i
[1:54:09] seek after that i may dwell in the house
[1:54:12] of the lord all the days of my life to
[1:54:15] behold the beauty of the lord and to
[1:54:17] inquire in his temple for in the time
[1:54:21] of trouble
[1:54:26] when did michael stand up
[1:54:28] in the time of trouble when does the
[1:54:30] mighty angel stand up in the time of
[1:54:33] trouble let me say this to you michael
[1:54:35] is standing up the mighty angel is
[1:54:37] standing up and the bride of jesus
[1:54:39] christ is on her feet
[1:54:44] she is on her feet because a prophet
[1:54:47] said in christ the mystery of god
[1:54:48] revealed he said she won't be shut up
[1:54:51] she'll be taken up
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:54:58] you're not standing alone
[1:55:01] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:55:04] me
[1:55:05] in his pavilion
[1:55:07] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:55:09] hide me
[1:55:14] i thought there was a tent minister to
[1:55:15] come brother andrew
[1:55:18] you're the tent
[1:55:22] you're the tent
[1:55:24] where's that third pole working at in
[1:55:26] the tent
[1:55:28] where's it operating at oh you can get
[1:55:30] mad at me all you want to but where is
[1:55:32] the third pool operating at in the tent
[1:55:35] of humanity
[1:55:39] you will meet me in there
[1:55:41] you'll find me in there you'll find this
[1:55:43] message in there it is operating in the
[1:55:46] tin of humanity because it came from
[1:55:50] divinity
[1:55:51] [Applause]
[1:55:53] he will hide me
[1:55:55] in his tabernacle
[1:55:58] the tabernacle of his word has enclosed
[1:56:01] me and enveloped me
[1:56:02] [Applause]
[1:56:10] and i i know i'm over time for tonight
[1:56:12] but i'm sitting i'm setting something up
[1:56:16] because i can do that
[1:56:18] i'm setting this up for tomorrow so you
[1:56:20] just go ahead and buckle up for tomorrow
[1:56:22] what did brother branham say he said
[1:56:24] that third pool cannot be impersonated
[1:56:28] he said
[1:56:29] that i must be loyal to that third pole
[1:56:34] what is it what is laying there and that
[1:56:37] old dead bag of bones but the very life
[1:56:41] can these live again
[1:56:44] can these prophesy can they say what
[1:56:47] john saw over there of taking a book and
[1:56:50] eating a book in the time of trouble
[1:56:53] there's a people that have set up
[1:56:55] themselves to be a kingdom and have
[1:56:57] preached to god
[1:57:00] what is she loyal to
[1:57:04] that's her boy
[1:57:10] i hear
[1:57:12] here's where satan gets in trouble
[1:57:16] this can't be impersonated
[1:57:20] and it can't be operated outside of this
[1:57:26] sure there was a lot of there was a lot
[1:57:28] of people that looked right
[1:57:31] sure there's a lot of people that looked
[1:57:33] like they would fulfill it
[1:57:38] you mean to tell me
[1:57:41] that's the people of the third pool
[1:57:45] that bunch of chaos
[1:57:50] if i was going to choose somebody
[1:57:53] i'd choose one of jesse's first sons
[1:57:57] i'd have chose somebody maybe a little
[1:57:59] bit bigger in stature
[1:58:03] oh
[1:58:04] bethlehem thou art least amongst all the
[1:58:08] tribes
[1:58:11] you are set up oh good lord and mercy
[1:58:14] you are set up to be the very house
[1:58:17] of david
[1:58:20] i'll chose somebody else to run with
[1:58:21] that message i'd have chose somebody
[1:58:23] else that was a little bit better a
[1:58:25] little bit stronger
[1:58:27] he didn't chose you he didn't choose you
[1:58:29] because you were you were good to look
[1:58:31] upon and you were coming to look upon he
[1:58:34] chose you because the before the
[1:58:36] foundation of the world he knew that you
[1:58:38] would drop down in this element of time
[1:58:41] and there would be a word deposited and
[1:58:43] you would grab that and you'd say in
[1:58:45] this will i be confident
[1:58:51] oh let me finish it and we'll bring it
[1:58:53] to a close
[1:58:55] in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:59:07] it's a secret
[1:59:09] that the rest of the world don't know
[1:59:10] nothing about
[1:59:13] they look upon you as a
[1:59:16] as a bunch of backwash
[1:59:19] look upon you as a people that were not
[1:59:21] identified
[1:59:23] with the so-called religions of the
[1:59:25] world
[1:59:26] that's exactly what we are
[1:59:29] we're not identified with them but we
[1:59:31] are identified with him
[1:59:33] and if i am identified with him he
[1:59:35] cannot leave me he cannot forsake me he
[1:59:38] cannot run off and leave me i am his
[1:59:41] thoughts i am in him and i cannot be
[1:59:43] forgotten
[1:59:46] on rapture mourning you won't be
[1:59:48] forgotten sister heather he is good as
[1:59:51] his word you'll be there because i met
[1:59:55] you in that third pool
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:04] oh hallelujah
[2:00:07] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[2:00:09] have me he shall set me up on a rock
[2:00:13] you think about this revelation that
[2:00:15] you're set on no man can impersonate it
[2:00:18] no man can take it from you you didn't
[2:00:20] put yourself there you didn't build up
[2:00:22] his church he set you there
[2:00:26] now get ready because brother branham
[2:00:28] said after the seals were released he
[2:00:30] said everything would be worship
[2:00:35] everything would be worship verse 6 and
[2:00:38] now shall my head be lifted up above my
[2:00:41] enemies round about me therefore will i
[2:00:44] offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[2:00:47] joy i will sing
[2:00:51] yea i will sing praises unto the lord
[2:01:00] what is that
[2:01:01] that you're looking at
[2:01:03] that's him
[2:01:05] that's him it stepped out
[2:01:07] a template stepped out of eternity
[2:01:11] it stepped down
[2:01:13] into a little
[2:01:14] hickey of time
