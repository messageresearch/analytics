cannot even see the things in our past the things in our future and the things in our present tonight we have brother nathaniel greene with us this evening we've asked him to come and take the service for tonight certainly thrilled to have brother nathaniel sister caitlyn we feel like they are family because they are we are so proud of him and to see what the lord has done in his life and we're just looking into the lord this evening as brother nathanael comes this evening let's sing that song it reaches to the highest mountain for it reaches to the highest mountain oh [Music] it will never [Music] nathaniel comes let's sing that again [Music] he's already foreign great praise the lord amen as brother ron would say stupid devil hey man it's just a wonderful privilege and a humbling experience to be here to not be at home with the saints by full gospel lighthouse just a lovely bunch of people and like andrew said we're family because we are family and i bring you greetings from my dad brother joe this evening and he sends his love and wishes he could be here i'm sure he's tuning in right now if you have your bibles this evening let's turn to second peter three and as you're doing that i want to pray this evening and if you will i just got a text from dad actually that my aunt kimberly has tested positive for the covet and she's having some real tightness in her chest and stuff so if y'all remember her this evening let's bow our heads and pray kind and gracious lord jesus we come before you this evening with humble hearts lord that we're able to stand here behind this sacred desk and bring this word to this portion of your bride lord god i ask you come down tonight lord use me like you've never used me before as i yield my body to your service one more time father lord bless everyone under the sound of my voice lord the ones that are listening on the internet just now god i ask that you just have your way in the service in your precious holy name we pray amen second peter 3 and verse 9 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen have your seats this evening i want to speak to you this evening for just the next little bit by the help of the lord on a promise keeping god now if any people know about the promises of god it's full gospel lighthouse you've seen so many miracles and you're still seeing miracles uh i just sit back in in all at every time i watch one of your services at how god moves and it's not just in full gospel lighthouse it's in churches across the message across the world you know the the promise that the lord gave your pastor trust me and i'll use you like never before that was for brother ron but it's for the bride also i believe that with all my heart he's he's taken full advantage of that so we should take full advantage of that hey man i was sent the other day when i was uh i was preparing this thought i was sending a text from a friend of mine who what used to be a police officer in his chapel and still sends him little sermonettes as he calls them so i want to read this i thought it was very fitting he starts by quoting hebrew hebrews 11 which says these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth he goes on to say is anything in anything harder in life than keeping promises making promises is easy keeping them is another matter for those who have children and he says here especially daughters they say i promise never to do that again dad and then flutter their eyes at you then of course you melt and say it's okay sadly everyone has broken a promise or at least not kept a promise as well as they would have intended i would like to think that it's more the latter i know our intentions for the most part are good we are just wanting to be people pleasers anybody else here like that or is it just me i say i'm gonna do something and then something comes up and i forget about it or something else takes my attention away brother jim and i don't get to it and that makes me look like a bad person in their eyes and i that's one of the worst feelings in the world to me is to look like a bad person in one of my friend's eyes but he goes on to say to the circle the way that we react to things and how we look at things can be traced back to our experiences to the circumstances that align our views or how we feel and our experience of breaking promises can perhaps lead us to wonder about god and his promises if we don't always keep ours does he we tend to look at god from a horizontal perspective rather than a vertical we are born into sin it's part of our nature but god is sinless he is perfect in every way the scriptures tell us and reveal many things about our god and keeping his promises is one of them god doesn't say okay i will walk with you and then all of a sudden he's gone he doesn't say you're forgiven and then throws it back in our face he's right there with us through all of the storms life has to throw at us stop and realize that god's promises are true and foundational we can build our life around and upon them and they will never let us stand we will never be let down know this god did not promise days without pain laughter or sorrows nor son but what he did promise was strengths for the day comfort for the tears and a lot for the way and he ends by saying you've got this and god's got you amen aren't you thankful that he's got us in the palm of his hand this evening amen going back to our original scripture reading the word slack it means decrease or reduce in intensity quantity or speed to work slowly or lazily i don't know about you but my god's not lazy he is you you know you look at your dad sometimes and i know all the girls and nathan look at brother jim and see how hard of a worker he is they don't say jim's lazy her dad's lazy you've never seen that man i've hardly ever seen him sitting still and when i do he's thinking about a job or doing something else keeping his mind sharp because he's not lazy he wants to get the job done and most people say well he takes forever no offense i love you but he takes he takes a while to do the job but when the job's done it's right and that can go to they can go to the spiritual too god may take a while to do the job but it's going to be done right you're not going to have to hire somebody else to come do it when jim noel does the job if you want a job done well call jim noel amen amen forgive my folly this evening but through the foolishness of preaching as they say the word promise means a declaration or assurance that one will do a particular thing or that a particular thing will happen if he's promised it it will happen it may not happen brother andrew when we want it to happen it may not happen how we want it to happen i know this is simple tonight but y'all are pulling so i'm preaching but it's going to happen brother justin it's going to happen amen ii peter 1 4 says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we have to get rid of things he's given us everything but in turn we have to get rid of everything in order to get what he has for us in order to get where we need to be we have to lay aside the weight of the world that does so easily easily beset us we have to lay aside the lust for money or the lust for a big house nice job or we have to lay aside the anxiety and the things like that that would weigh us down this evening we have to get rid of all that stuff clean ourselves out so that he can come and fill us fill us up again we have everything at our disposal we have a book of promises endless promises thousands upon thousands of promises will we ever use them all probably not but they're there if that situation arises brother william and we need that promise you know and in the message dr moses he he talks about moses having that medicine box with the brass serpent and everything we have need of every kind of medicine is right here this is our this is our medicine cabinet tonight second corinthians 1 and 20 says for all all the promises of god in him are ye and in him amen unto the glory of god by us not one quarter of the promises or three-fourths of the promises but all that word all is one of my favorite words it means all inclusive without exception every one the word yea is an affirmative answer and the word amen means so be it two positives in that right there if i close my bible now and we went home we could say we had church tonight just by that one scripture right there his all his promises are in in him are ye and in him amen affirmative so be it so when he tells you i've promised you that i'm going to heal your pastor of that cancer he means it it's an affirmative answer so be it we've already claimed that promise as i was talking to brother jim today about his experience he said i don't then brother ron's motto don't accept anything less than full victory that's what we're looking for tonight is full victory he don't give you half of his promises he gives you all his promises every single one brother branham tells the story of the well i was listening to brother billy paul's testimony a while back and one of my all-time favorite stories is when brother branham the little girl comes up and she has the box of shoes under her arm she walks up and says and he asked her what she has under her arm she says a box of shoes i'm walking out of here without these crutches so then he gets to a point where he says you go sit down there on the front row and i'll get back to you in a little bit so he begins to start praying for more people praying for more people and his brother don i believe it was was in the background and he started to think he started to let the devil get into thinking that he's forgot about this little girl and we all know the story all of a sudden he turns around and says i haven't forgotten her and he calls her back up and he says is your faith built up yet that's where we got to get tonight is to a point to where our faith matches our promise because once we get to the where the faith matches the promise it's going to happen it has to happen because he said it's going to happen when you think he's forgotten all about you my goodness when you think he's forgotten all about you and all of a sudden he comes to you so sister gabby i haven't forgotten you i haven't forgotten you he's just waiting for your faith to catch up to your promise john 10 verse 34 and 35 says jesus answer to them is it not written in your law i said ye are god's if he if he called them gods and to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken it cannot be broken nothing can be taken away from it he says it you can take it to the bank as the saying says you can take it to the bank cash that check because it's on the way and the message and then jesus came prophet god says listen at him watch his emotions oh how he wants to get the hearts tonight like that thy brother shall rise again he said talking about lazarus here listen to this beautiful young hebrew girl yea lord he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day now there never was a man able to say this before or since or never will be outside of him the bible said there was no beauty we should desire him probably a little fellow in stature he pulled his little shoulders up and said i am the resurrection in life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die that was his eternal promise and he himself said the scriptures cannot be broken what consolation do we have then tonight when god said something and then he says where have you buried him when god says something it's going to happen and the prophet of god said if he would have just said come forth it would have been a general resurrection but he called him by name he's calling you by name tonight and telling you that your promise is on the way god don't tell you about your problems he tells you about his promises i believe i was talking brother andrew in the back i believe i got that from brother ron but that's just too good not to reap and use again but he don't sit around and tell you well you've got this going on and you've got this going on this and such and such and you've been to the doctor all these times and they're telling you there's no hope and your friends and family are telling you there's no hope he don't sit around and tell you about that he says i've told you i promised you in my word that by my stripes you were healed before the foundation of the world you've been healed since then you've just got to get that faith to meet that promise i've got more promises than i got problems oftentimes i used to i do have a a great aunt that would sit around every time you'd ask her how she was doing and she'd say well my arthritis is acting up or such and such happened to me today she was always she was never positive never positive but when you told her well we say we used to tell her well you got one good thing going for you jesus loves you and she'd kind of perk up a minute and then she'd go back to saying the same thing again but you have to trust god's promises even when you don't know the details when you don't know how he's going to work it out or when he's going to work it out he's going to work it out it's in his time not ours we can't sit around and well we sit around and wait on it but while we're waiting on it we're letting our faith build like that little girl sitting on the front row waiting to put on that new pair of shoes we got to get our faith to a point tonight to where it matches our promise so we could step into that promise i'm gonna testify a little bit it's all right that little fella sitting right back there in his nana's arms he was prayed for on august 7. brother owens told you all this but i'm going to tell you again i might go into a little more detail he was born prayed for we were prayed for on august 7th on a wednesday he was born a year to the day wednesday august 5th this was we were prayed for in 2019 he was born august of this year to a wednesday to down to the day and you can't tell me that ain't god you can't tell me that i think the promises of god we asked for a child and he gave it to us not only did he give it to us he made it a specific time he was due on the eighth on the saturday but god wanted him to come on wednesday for the purpose of his testimony now we're not done yet his testimony he's he's got such an awesome testimony for a little guy and i can't wait to he he's able to tell it he'll probably do a better job than i do but we look and see that he was born we ended up in charlotte at the nicu at levine's children hospital and if any of your kids ever have to be there i pray that they don't but that is the top-notch best hospital treats you like royalty when you go in there but we we were distraught as any new parent would be a kid just born and caitlyn hadn't even got to hold him i barely got to touch him and here he comes in the room in a box about this big all hooked up and ready to fly on a helicopter so we were naturally distraught calling everybody saying we all pray we all pray we're headed to charlotte don't know how long we're going to be there but y'all just pray with us but let me tell you how god works let me tell you how god works we got there he was immediately off the oxygen still had the feeding tube and and the iv because his blood sugar was kind of low so he had the iv and things for about three to four days i believe maybe a week and got rid of that and got kept the sugar up and they kept they kept wanting to want his sugar to crash so they could do some tests but i tell you the whole 28 days he was there his sugar never fell below 55 because that's what they wanted to fall below 50. his sugar never fell below 55 they had to actually make his sugar fall down to get the test they wanted because that's my god he's promised he's a miracle he promised sister caitlin and i that miracle sitting back there he's not going to take him away he may have you may have to go through some things but he's not going to take him away he uh we we kept battling with the the feeding tube they wanted him to eat but yet when he's getting pumped full of food all day he don't want to eat so that was the only thing that kept us there for probably 20 out of those 28 days in the meantime i never missed i only missed a week's worth of work never missed a bill no late payments well how do you do that because jehovah jireh my provider how do you do that brother nate because i put my trust in him i had a friend at work that said she woke up one morning and felt impressed to start a facebook fundraiser maybe many some of you donated to it and i appreciate you god richly bless you for it but in it was less than a month in maybe three weeks time god allowed that fundraiser to raise and i'm not bragging on me i'm bragging on god now i'm not bragging on because who who i may be or who i associate with well i am bragging on who i associate with but that that fundraiser was able to produce just about three dollars shy two or three dollar shot of six thousand dollars i never missed a payment i never kaitlyn sister caitlyn never missed a payment we never missed a bill we just bought a house right before he was born never missed a mortgage payment that is that is my god that is jehovah gyra this evening meanwhile we were thinking that they wouldn't let us go back home and come back and go back home and come back because of the covet stuff so we were fortunate enough to spend one night in a motel and had to pay for it one night out of the month and it was at a discounted price so out of one month i paid 45 dollars for a month's worth of room service room and board they they have programs through the hospital that uh would would pay for like a ronald mcdonald house is a wonderful thing we didn't have to pay for supper or breakfast the only time i had to pay for food the whole time i was there is if me and sister caitlin got out to get away for a little bit or or lunch every day i can say out of a month i probably spent maybe 200 that's that's amazing i like numbers my my dad was as an accountant so i like numbers i'm not good at them but i like them but so so all these things started adding up sister caitlin and i looked the other day and they were they were breaking down on the ronald mcdonald facebook page there that uh what each day cost and it rounded to about 142 so that would have cost us over would you say twenty one hundred dollars twenty five hundred dollars for a month a month we stayed there ain't got good any good to give us so many blessings undeserving amen and now we have charlie back there and he's growing like a weed and we just give all the glory to god and we we're so thankful for his many blessings and if he does it for us how much more can he do it for all the rest of his children he's no respecter of persons tonight amen in the patriarch abraham brother branham says regardless of how unreal it seems how unnatural it seems to the natural mind yet god cannot make a promise that he is not big enough to take care of we believe that same thing today every true seed of abraham believes the same thing no matter what circumstances in how much knowledge we've accumulated how many things has happened how unnatural it is to the natural mind how foolish it is rather to the natural mind it doesn't make a bit of difference if god said so that's it and the seed of abraham are settled upon thus saith the lord that settles it his word i promise that settles it that's all you got to worry about i promise brother gabe that settles it second kings chapter seven verses three through seven and there were four leprous men at the entering of the gate and they they said one to another why sit here why sit we here until we die if we say we will we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die verse 5 and they rose up in the twilight to go into the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there for the lord had made the host of this of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the king of the hittites and the king of the egyptians to come upon us wherefore they arose and fled into twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even even that camp as it was and fled for their life i'm gonna go ahead and put satan on notice there's a there's a host camped around about us that's made him flee tonight that's made him get out of our hometown it's made him get out of our camp tonight i'm part of that host tonight hey man he's he's on his way out he's got his tail tucked and he's running just now those those four lepers their victory was motion activated they got up and did something about it they didn't just sit there and die they got up and walked into that victory and that's what we got to do tonight we got to get up and walk into our victory brother randy we got to get up off our seat to do nothing and walk into our victory walk into the promise tonight we need to have an action to start a reaction we need to start the reaction we need to to get going get up start walking toward it brother matthew i feel like preaching now get up and do something about it grab hold of the promise it's right in front of you i preached a message a while back pick it up it's right in front of you it's sitting there for you to pick up it's sitting right in front of you to pick up he's gave it to you brother thomas he's gave it to us all we got gotta do is reach out by faith and grab it tonight putting that faith into action and the hours come brother branham says you must and it's a lengthy lengthy quote but bear with me you'll like it you must have it the same tonight the same way tonight a quick decision now choose you this day who you'll be who you'll serve take god at his word the word has been preached the signs has been done the holy ghost is here the time the hour has come for a decision made amongst the people what more can god do send it down with signs and wonders discernments proved it scientifically put it on a picture send it across the world thousands times thousands are witnessing others are being healed what about you they arose in the middle of the night and started down towards walking by faith towards the host of the syrians and god honored their faith and it caused a great storm to come on the desert to roar run all the syrians away they went right on in they got plenty to eat got some mine and got happy my and they didn't only save their life but they saved the whole city there's a lot of sick people here tonight with heart trouble a lot with tubercular and a lot was bound in chairs why don't you deny why don't you sit there to you why do you sit there til you die the hour has come for you to make the decision now god can't do no more about it it's up to you you've got to make the decision why do we sit here till we die and he says and look you're not invit you're not invited to go down and you don't have to go down to the enemy's camp you come to a father's house where he's expecting you to not he wants you to come he sent his son he died he put the deposit in there for your healing and the hour has come for you to make your decision now amen the hour has come the hour has come for us to get up the hour has come for us not to get up and walk but they get up and run towards our promises to get up and run into the city where there's food where there's drink where we can be happy to run into the presence of god tonight because we have a promise the hour has come for us to make that decision the decision is on you god's done his part you know i told the church the other day i preached at home and and i told them about the book where the red fern grows i love that book because i used to hunt all the time when i was younger and skinnier and i talked about how the boy he goes and he trains his dogs and he takes him out to this big tree and he he chops and he chops and he chops till he can't chop no more and he says all right god i've done my part we do yours well he's saying to us tonight i've done my part you do yours i've done what i'm what i promised i'll do it's up to you to walk into the by faith into that promise tonight we look at the promise to abraham he had to wait 25 years i heard the prophet prophet today he said he had to wait all this time but he staggered not he didn't lose faith he kept going down to the store and buying diapers he kept going down to the kroger and buying diapers when they were on sale or booties or this and that maybe they were deteriorated by time isaac got here because they've been they've been in the closet so long but he went he went on anyway he went by faith walking by faith exercising his faith tonight he didn't sit around and and get fat on not on being lazy and not exercising his faith he was not physically fit he was spiritually fit he was he was in the promise he was walking in the promise every day he kept walking in the promise today's the day today's the day today's the day for 25 years sometimes we get mad when we have to wait three days what we get annoyed by god embraces to manifest that he is jehovah jireh he uses what annoys us to be able to work in a way where to us there seemeth to be no way we've prayed and we've cried and we've prayed and we've asked for god to intervene he's waiting he's got it but he's waiting what is he waiting on he's waiting on you to let go and let god he's waiting on your faith to build up to a level to build up to that level that abraham had now abraham didn't start out with all the faith in the world maybe that's why it took 25 years maybe he had may not have been his faith he may had to encourage sister sarah to get her faith up a little bit but he waited and he staggered none psalms 37 and 4 delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart excuse me a minute he will never leave you he's always there when your earthly friends have let you down if i had a million dollars that i got in the inheritance and i come down to brother shifflet right here and and uh told him that i was going to give him ten thousand dollars to do some home renovation projects or something and i'll don't shake his hand or anything i just said i'll get with you when i get the money it's you know it's going through the legal process and everything 10 months down the road he calls me and he sees me here next time we come up to visit you know you promised me that ten thousand dollars man i just bought a new hunting cabin and a new hunting lease and i really don't have it i'm sorry i forgot you think he's gonna think highly of me then i don't think so i'd be pretty upset at least invite me hunting in your new hunting cabin or your new hunting land but god's not that way tonight he's going to come down and he'll he'll shake your hand and he'll tell you brother andrew i've got what you got need of it's yours you can have it i promise amen hebrews 13 5 says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee he's always there even when nobody else is he's always there like i said i know this is simple tonight but i hope it's a blessing deuteronomy 31 and 8 and the lord he and the lord he it is that doeth doth go before thee and he will be with thee and he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed don't be discouraged tonight even when you don't see him he's working even when you don't feel him he's working he's always working like i said at the beginning he's not a lazy god he don't sit around and say well i'll let somebody else do it michael will you go do that gabriel will you go do that he's an ever present god in our times of trouble in our times of joy in our times of grief he's always right there he's never too far away he never leaves us sometimes we get away from him but he's still there waiting on us to come back to the spot where we left him he tells us in his word over and over again how to get what we have need of and it's simple john 14-13 says and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything some things if you shall ask some things in my name i might do it can you clean these for me i don't know i don't know if i read that right i'm sorry i'm joe green's son if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it not i'll think about it or i'll get back to you you know sister caitlin always asked me if i would get ready to do something she's like you want to do such and such or do this or can we do this and i'll say i'll pray about it and nine times out of ten if i can get out of it that means no but i'll tell her i'll pray about it it's hard being a preacher is why i fainted sweetheart john 15 and 16 says you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever ye ask shall whatever whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you when you need comfort he's promised to be your comforter when you need a friend he's promised to be that friend you know brother andrew was one of my best friends in the whole wide world but there's times where brother andrew is dealing with other things and i call him up and he's like i'll call you back later or or maybe uh i can't talk right now but when i need a friend that i know i can count on and most of the time i can count on brother andrew there's not been many times that i haven't been able to count on him even when he tells me things i don't want to hear that's a that's a different story for a different day but he's always there he always picks up the phone as it were he'll always he'll never put you on hold or say i'll call you back he's always got to listen in here and a shoulder to cry on john 14-18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you we don't have to try to make it to him he will come to us when we're in need of comfort when we're in need of healing when we're in need of of uplifting he comes to us whether it be through a church service much like this one or somebody calling you on the phone or sending you a text message saying i love you i'm praying for you or whatever it is that you have need of in that moment god knows he knows how to come down and tell you just exactly what you've had on your heart and we know that back back when before all the computerized and all the things happen if you made a man a promise you shook his hand and that handshake as the saying is a man's word is his bond if you shake that if you shake his hand that means that you promised to do something and you better hold up your end of the bargain isaiah 41-13 says for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee tonight we just need to slip our hand into his and trust him not slip our hands into man's hand but put our hand in god's hand a man's word is his bond i know where this is covered but i'm gonna shake your hand tonight i promise you brother andrew whatever you have need of whatever it is it's yours i've gave you the promise in my word whatever you have need of amen claim it just now amen i'm gonna tell you how easy that is i was ministering at home there on sunday and god began to deal with things and we had a we have a sister in our church and her husband i if i called her name you would know who they are and they may be listening and not she desire they desire a child they've been married 16 years tomorrow and they've had some miscarriages and so forth and they desire a child so on sunday i was ministering at church and i was kind of preaching along these same lines and i did that same example and i walked around the different ones and and was saying things to him and i walked to her and i can't exactly remember what i said but it was something about hannah i said hannah hannah prayed and she prayed and it seemed like she was not getting anywhere and then that last time she prayed she got through to god i shook her hand and i told her it's coming well unbeknownst to me at the same time my dad was preaching 50 miles away in hendersonville and he was talking about the promise of abraham and another brother that goes to our church was there with his wife and he said as soon as dad said that abraham's promise wasn't just for abraham was for us to he said the lord began to show him getting a prayer cloth out of his wallet that nobody has ever touched he's never gave it to anybody it's a piece of brother brandon's pillowcase so he said i saw myself getting this prayer cloth out of my wallet and taking it up to the front to be prayed for to give to this sister because god showed me that it's getting time you know so he did that and then they met him up afterwards and and they they went to eat together and he gave her this this prayer cloth and he said he told her i want it back in 10 months he said i'll give you extra month but i want it back in 10 months so they begin to converse about the things that happened and they were telling what happened at our church and they and they were telling what happened there at the other assembly and they ate their lunch and they went outside in a parking lot and the brother felt led to pray so he began to pray and he told this brother to put the prayer cloth on his wife's stomach they began to pray and then after they were done she told him of a dream that she had that my wife was in the nursery with charlie and his wife was in the nursery with a new baby and this other sister was there as well well we were rejoicing in things and then the brother called me that evening he said i got to tell you something i said what's that i said i can hardly stand anymore i feel like enoch i'm about to take a take a rapture and he said he said i was i was getting brow beat by the devil just sitting here on the couch you know how he does after a good service he don't even wait till monday morning anymore he'll get you as soon as you walk out of the church doors but he'll he started browbeating him and make trying to make him doubt and he simply said god help me and he said all of a sudden the lord started showing him this dream that the sister had and then while he was showing him this dream he said the lord asked him the question why do you think this sister was in the nursery with your wife and sister caitlin i would say who knows but god knows it's on the way the promises is on the way i was listening to your pastor today from this past sunday i believe brother andrew said it at the end of the service we're seeing miracles we're seeing more miracles now than we have ever before some of us maybe some of you older ones and the veterans that are in here that have seen these things over the years but it's time now that these miracles are starting to take place again you have to trust his process this is saying goes trust the process you put your faith in his process not the faith in the preacher's process or your neighbor's process because they can pray with you but he's the only one that can answer that prayer he's the only one that we need to put our faith in yes it's good to have faith in your pastors because they lead you they shepherd you but put all your faith in his process matthew 24 and 35 says heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away i quoted it earlier a man's word is his bond and god's word has an even stronger bond than that you know when you weld two pieces of metal together if the weld's good and strong it takes a lot of pressure it takes a lot of pressure before that that metal will break but i can tell you right now the devil can throw all his sledgehammers he can throw all his sawzalls he can throw everything he's got at it tonight but this bond's better than loctite brother matthew this bond between god and his bride is a million times stronger you can't even put it on a number how much stronger the bond of jesus christ and his bride is gorilla glue ain't got nothing on this duct tape ain't even got nothing on this and that's stronger than gorilla glue sometimes the power of a promise like we said if if i promise you something and you know that i'm a man of my word you hold me to that promise you hold me to that standard of being a man of my word but i'm a human and as a song says humans forget now you can remind me and i may forget again and you keep reminding me that i may forget again but when we go to him and tell him what we have need of we don't have to ask him anymore we can remind him every now and again god i know you're working on this it's there you know you look at something you order something and you look at the tracking number and you track that thing every day is there is there any progress is there is it when's it gonna be here i'm i'm an amazon prime junkie when's it gonna be here i need it two days ago and sister caitlin gets me every time i've told her that i'm gonna quit but i'm a human and humans forget most of them now it's hunting stuff because it's hunting season and she asked me the other day she said when is this money spending going to quit and then i look over her and she's checking the paypal invoice off i said when is this money this money spending gonna quit hebrews 10 and 23 says let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised he is faithful that promised the word faithful it means you ain't got to worry about if he's going to do it or not that's a redneck definition there and that ain't webster that's redneck you ain't got to worry about if he's going to do it if he's going to keep his word he's already kept his word like we said he's just waiting on you to keep your end of the bargain and the message of the reaction to an action and if and if you're sure that you're born of the spirit of god that you have the holy ghost and that the promises of god is yours i don't care what the devil does you can still rest assure faith takes its unmovable stand faith cannot rest upon the shifting sins of man's theology but it takes its solemn stand on the rock of ages which is unmovable there it rests with assurance no matter what comes or goes my faith holds how sick i get how contrary it looks how this is my faith is anchored within the veil and nothing can move me my faith is anchored in the rock my faith can't be broken sometimes i feel like i don't have the strongest faith but i look back in his word again i look back at all the promises this this little black back book right here is chock full of promises his promises are in him yea and in him amen that means it's already done that means it's already been fulfilled you just have to wait you just have to get into that channel of faith to where you can step into that promise you know brother ron is getting to that point in his faith to where he's going to step into that new body he's going to step into that cancer-free body and i don't believe it's gonna be much longer he's gonna step right into that cancer-free body and we're gonna see brother ron preach like he did on sunday every service i thought he preached good when we were here the last time until i watched that today man i'm talking about preach like like brother ron preaches it was just awesome to see that god is building his strength every day god is building your strength every day your spiritual strength and if you need it your physical strength you just have to put your trust in him no matter how bleak the situation looks to us he has promised to help us and he can't break that no matter how hard the devil tries to throw things at you like well he ain't done it yet he ain't gonna do it if he ain't done it yet you know he's supposed to work like this sometimes he says yes sometimes he says no other times he says wait a while when he says wait a while you know what he's waiting on he's waiting on us he's waiting on us to get to that point like we talked about the whole service he's waiting on us to get to that point to where our faith outweighs our problems those circumstances will this brother branham again and be certain of god 1959 those circumstances will seem to fall from right and left but that faith never moves because you're certain that he's god and if he's god he keeps his promise he can't make a promise and break it if he's god he's got to keep his promise oh i love that he's got to stay with it he's not an indian giver you know i had to when i was little i used to play with my cousins and stuff and we trade toys back and forth all the time well i got a little action figure and by the time i got home her mom was calling my mom saying she wants it back she gave it to me she told me i could have it she never played with it but once i got once i took it away and took it to my house to play with it she wanted it back god's not like that tonight no it wasn't katie it wasn't katie katie i'd give spending with katie and she'd just leave me in the room by myself and don't even worry about it but god's not like that tonight when he gives you something he's not taking it back again forgive my folly tonight he's not taking it back whatever he gives you it's yours whatever he gives us it's ours we don't have to say well you can borrow it but i want it back brother gabe if i gave you my hunting rifle to borrow to go hunting i want it back don't get any scratches on it but he gives it to you and it's yours you don't want it he don't ask for it back he don't ask for it back satan is going to try every way he can to destroy your testimony that god is working on but he can't do anything like brother ron preached on sunday you can't stop it you can't stop it once that faith is in motion that faith is in action you can't stop it in the power of the devil brother branham says the devil's nothing but a bluff anyhow snorting and blowing all thunder and no lightning but i tell you brother the lightning power of the resurrected jesus christ puts a reality there that shocks the soul from a dead slumber of these earthly bound things into the immortal realms to believe god and take him at his word and call those things which are not as though they were amen redeemed by the blood of the lamb called out set aside a church bought and washed and ironed out without spot or wrinkle that's what he's coming for god help us to get our faith in the right place to not move out on the battlegrounds there and say satan you're a liar jesus christ died to make me free and it's mine get out of here i can tell him that tonight it's mine get out of here why do we hold back when he's promised us everything why do we continue to worry and fret and get overwhelmed we let the naysayers come in and sit on our pew and tell us that well god did it for somebody else but he's not going to do it for you or we let our neighbors say well why are you still believing that it had happened yet you've been waiting for 15 16 years for it to happen why why are you why have you not given up because my faith won't let me give up my faith in him and whom i put my trust and my faith he won't let me it won't let me give up no matter how hard i want to give up no matter how hard i want to quit trying and just throw in the towel as it were and sit down and not do anything my faith and my trust and my god won't let me and hear ye him he says upon such a word as that i wonder this afternoon our listeners how can we be so petty then and dilatory about reaching out and taking hold of the promises of god when he gave us this blessed promise to his church i'll be with you even in you till the end of the age and then we set along as if god never said it whatsoever you bind in earth i'll bind it in heaven what you loose on the earth i'll loose it in heaven whether it's sickness whether it's disease whether it's whatever it is god gave this blessed promise and it's our privilege to pick up this promise and use it it's our privilege you know they say driving is a privilege you when you're in school you can get your license taken or your permit taken away for bad grades but he's not going to take it away it's a pretty it's a privilege but it's a privilege that we get to use all the time if we'll use it but that's the thing we got all the tools brother jim what would it be if your tools set in the shed all the time and you didn't use them what good would they be they'd just be collecting dust and and you'd be losing money but if you put those tools to use in the trade they don't they they're rewarding over and over again they pay for themselves as it said this is paid for itself over and over again it's paid for itself with healing it's paid for itself with salvation it's paid for itself with deliverance it's paid for itself with whatever you have need of he paid the ultimate price for it it's already paid for the tools are already paid for we just got to put them to use you know this this next verse here it says many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us word they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered i can't put a number on how many times i've been blessed i can't put a number on how many times he's met my needs i can't put a number on how many promises that he's kept there's no end to the promises that he's given us we can't even begin to fathom what he's given us and there won't be enough time when we get over there to thank him we'll thank him for a million years and we'll still be thanking him we'll thank him for all eternity and it still won't be enough for what he's done for us we'll thank him throughout the endless ages but we still will still be thanking him over and over again when i get there y'all gonna have to wait in line because you're gonna be behind me and i'm gonna spend the first ten thousand years with him thanking him just starting to thank him and then i'll let somebody else i'll come back later and thank him again in the message then jesus came and called brother brown says is he identified among you enough that you can accept him do you believe he's here you believe that that's him friends if i could come down there in that audience and heal any one of any of you people i'd sure do it i would gladly do it with all my heart i would do it but i can't do that i don't have any way of doing it but the only thing i have is this little gift that i was showing you and that identifies the scripture promise that jesus christ is right here with us keeping his promise oh that ought to set our hearts on fire my just think of jesus that wonderful name i just think that he's here right now he's here right now brother greg if i got to come down and give you what you had need of i'd do it it's like the prophet said but i can't because he's already done it you just have to have the faith build up to that point to where you can step into it i keep repeating that but i'm trying to drive a point home there this verse here this in psalms 34 3 and 8 it tells us what to do i believe you read it the other night i tried to sing it but i can't sing it oh magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this is my verse right here this poor man cried and the lord heard me and saved him out of half of his troubles all of his troubles the angel of the lord encampeth are around about them that fear him fear him and delivered them o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him he's given us all these prop promises not problems he's given us everything we have need of like i said not when we need it or when we think we need it but when he knows for a fact that we need it we think we need it right now we think we need it yesterday but he knows exactly when and where and what time we need it and he's there to give it to us at that specific time and not a minute before or a minute after and i'm preaching to myself here because i'm one of the most impatient people you'll ever meet i'm a green and that runs in the blood i i'm a i don't like to wait i like to be on time i like to get there so i know that i'm if it's at a restaurant i like to get a good seat or if i'm going somewhere where i have to get a good seat maybe in church or something i want to get there so that i can get there and make sure that i'm there i don't want to run in at the last minute if i can help it but now he's telling us here that i've give you all these and he gives us the instructions here to magnify his name to praise him with everything that was within us because that's what we were created to do we can sing praises that the angels can't even dream about singing we were made we were created to praise him and we have the right to praise him because he's done so much for us even if he's only done two or three things for you that's more than enough that's more than we deserve i know each and every one of us sitting here tonight have had promise after promise miracle after miracle this and that after that that he's done for us and we know that he is the same yesterday today and forever so if he did it for somebody over here yesterday and he's going to do it for somebody out here he can do it for you right now if it's your time if you've stepped into that faith tonight if you've stepped into that faith where you need to be he's here and he's well able to perform he is faithful that he promised amen god bless you this evening let's just bow our heads kind and gracious lord jesus god i feel we've give what you put upon our heart lord i ask that that it'd be a blessing to the people lord let their hearts receive it god let them take it home and and mull it over as it were and think about it as the week to come lord until they meet again god of the promises that you've given us your promises are in him yea and in him amen that means they have to be done well you've done everything that we have need of tonight let us be able to get our faith to that point to where we can meet it where we can put our faith in action and step into that promise this evening god i ask you bless this
