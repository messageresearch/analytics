yesterday the word perfect was use Lord I've read it we don't know what you're up to father we know God that when you are on the scene that something good always happens when you come father a parade then you know the unseen and the unspoken requests for dinner all artists man on your children's hearts I pray that Mister Lord set me down over in a corner there's asbestos on your surface you have your Bibles this morning what to turn over to several scriptures today you keep your Bible handy but first we'll turn over to the Book of Psalms chapter 37 and verse 3 and then also down to 2nd Peter chapter 3 and verse 9 I'd like to speak to you today I'll help the Lord on on the bride's commitment the bride's commitment Psalms chapter 37 and verse verse 3 the Bible says here to trust in the Lord and do good and so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed delight thyself also in the Lord what a place to delight our self in not in Dairy Queen a Burger King but delight ourselves in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of the heart commit thy way unto the Lord and Trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass let's read that last verse verse 5 commit thy way unto the Lord Trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass 2nd Peter chapter 3 and verse 9 the Bible says here the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord where you are and commit your way into the Lord this morning so said we'd like to speak to you by the help of the Lord on the bride's commitment now commitment is the trait of sincere and steadfast fix of purpose it is the act of bonding oneself to a course of action commitment describes the person who is willing to give their time and energy to something that they believe in and I believe that is that is truly the bride's commitment today is this word of God it describes us as as Christians as us his sons and daughters of God that the word commitment describes who we are so I like for just a little bit of time to speak on the thing that describes you and and and I trust that these things will these things will stir your heart that these things will describe a people that are willing to give their time willing to give their energies to the things in which they believe in this message that has been delivered to the bride of Jesus Christ is not just not just her Reformation but it is a transforming message that has changed it has changed and transformed our thinking into his thinking that we no longer have our thoughts but we take on his thoughts as the Bible says in Philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now notice what the word the word about what the Bible is saying there that Christ humbled himself and here we take on the Spirit of Christ in humility and we commit ourselves to have his mind and then committing ourselves to have his mind we no longer take on our mind we don't longer take on our thinking but we take on his thinking now the Bible says here in Hebrews 12 and 1 we'll be looking over into the great cookbook today if you keep it handy and I and our notepad just to write these things down that you can go back over the Bible says here in Hebrews 12 and 1 wherefore seeing we are we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us I'd every weight and the sin which dust so easily beset us and let us run with since the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus notice where our Aswan we we spoke this past week with the the young people and where our eyes should be by the way of a video conference on where our eyes should be but notice young people where our eyes are to be it's looking unto Jesus it's not on the world it's not on what Fox News is saying or seeing it in saying but we're looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith notice what he did who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross for the joy of it despised the shame for the joy of it and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God verse 3 for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds consider him consider this one who for the joy for for your sakes endured the cross of despising the shame in considering him in the greatness of who he is as God the Son of God the heir of all things in his offices of prophet and priest and King as the Saviour of lost sinner's the leader and commander of the people consider him as the Apostle the high priest have I profess and consider him in his human nature consider him in his conversation on earth and what he did and suffered from men consider him how that in his nature he was pure and holy in his conversation harmless in a sin and in his manner meek and lowly who went about doing good to the souls of men and at last suffered and died and is now glorified first we want to consider him today we look telling this commitment consider him consider him in his commitment consider him and his commitment to his chosen to you and here in your life and the days that you know that there's nobody else around but you consider him that he's always there consider him when you can't get to the doctor that he's your doctor when you can't get to that when you can't get to the grocery store that he will supply and he will fear your refrigerator consider him when you can't get to the pasture that he is your burden bearer consider him and his commitment to you that he will not leave you that he will not forsake you but he'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that his counsel is true that his ways are perfect that he is the utmost and the up and the greatest one that you could ever turn your eyes upon for the Bible says in Psalms 33 and 11 the counsel of the Lord stands forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance the Lord looketh from heaven he behold of all the sons of man he beholds all the sons of man from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth he fastest their heart alike he considereth all their works youth you see today that God is obligated to his word he's obligated to keep what he said in the things that he said that he would bring to pass he promised it he'll make it to happen he promised then it Aaron it'll show up you see for we know that he is committed into bringing his word to pass you see as a human being you try to work yourself up and try to figure out how God is going to work all the details out and you try to figure out how this is going to happen and how that is going to happen that God's got to do this and God's got to do that to bring it to pass and what you're doing is you're locking God up in a box that that you're saying that God's got to do this and God's got to do that he's God he's a God of miracles he's a God of impossibilities he's a god that looks past what doctors say he's a god that looks past what we see he's a God that is committed to his word and he's a God that changes not for the Bible says that he is not a man that he should lie for the Bible said in Isaiah 55 that so shall my word be they goeth forth out of my mouth that I will accomplish it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I sent it to do now God has sent a word to you in this hour and he has committed that word for a such a time as this for a purpose that he has in store in your own life and God is committed in to bring that word and bringing it to pass in your life you see he is determined to bring forth life you see if there if there is an air that is shut up in your loins it's got to come forth and bring forth life because God is the author of life because God is not the author of death it's the enemy that wants to kill it's the enemy that wants to steal it's the enemy that wants to destroy but God's purpose will never be defeated for he is committed in bringing his word to pass if there is a miracle that is on the way there is a people that will have faith for that miracle to be established in if God has a rapture for a people there will be a people to take a rapture God is committed in bringing his word to pass and right here in the midst of Satan's Eden when the world is in chaos and when Satan is the king of the world God's seed will prevail I'd say to you today that you are God's seed and you will overcome you will make it you will be victorious you will not be defeated you will not be cast down you will not be perplexed you will not be destroyed but you will overcome you say what about if I fail you say you say what about if I fail you see God has not come to me when I failed it says Andrew I'm going to divorce you because you have failed you see he has a lasting commitment to me there's a lot but here nah but whether I love him but whether I feel him or whether I know he's there he is committed to me hallelujah and just because I failed him Oh Tuesday or I fail him on Wednesday God is not riding out a law of divorcement to you but he has committed to you that he will never leave you and he will not forsake you he's a god that is obligated to the word you see and you commit that word God have committed that word to the ground in the Garden of Eden and every one of those seeds would bring forth other kind and you watch as the Holy Ghost goes to moving in your life and goes to working over nature that it's the Holy Ghost that brings it to pass you committed to the ground you committed to the ground of your heart and you watch as God is committed to bring it to pass you see God is our great provider God is our great sustainer God is the God that is with you in your tour mo you see God's got everything already worked out you and I try to walk into a building and we look for the exit door where we know how to get out but God's already got your exit plan figured out he is committed in bringing you out in this day he is our great provider you remember we just heard about winter when brother Wayne was here that when David hit it over that Hill Tomika life he didn't go down there with a stone in his pocket he went down there and picked up stones because in that valley was the same valley that joshua had been in and joshua chapter 10 when he stopped the Sun and God rain down hailstones on top of the Assyrians and the enemy there and David walked down into that Valley and he grabbed five of those smooth stones those stones were from another world you see it and walked down in that Valley with stones he went down there to get those fed those stones that were proving stones those stones had killed the enemy before and day it'd be in the annointed walked down into that Valley and grabbed those proven stones you see what the last mistake was is that he allowed David to get to those stones the stones that have been placed in your hands are not man's ideas their message stones and they have been proven they have been anointed hallelujah these stones have been committed into your trust for you to take them and slay your tides the enemy's mistake is that he has allowed you to get to these message stones whoo hallelujah hallelujah when the Bible says in Isaiah chapter 22 verse 22 and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he saw so he shall open it and none shall shut and he shot a nun so open but where is the key brother Branham says in the church age book where is that key that is placed in the house of David that I will lay upon his shoulder he said where is that key he said it's on his shoulder it's on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it read in Isaiah 9 and 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom hallelujah that she takes off her veil and places it over on the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and the care and that he alone and no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of David God being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his body he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and he to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church notice when she takes off her veil and she places it over on his shoulder it is signified that all that I am I am committing to your trust and he is saying that all that you are I am committed and taking care of you I am committed in providing for you I am committed in taking care of you whoa hallelujah I'd say we could dismiss right now let's hey we done had church for this guy when you have committed your trust over to him you saying I got this I've got this do you realize today that you are placing your veil over all top of Poppa God and he's big enough he's committed enough he's strong enough he's good enough I don't know that's a correct English enough but he's right enough he's powerful enough he's anointed enough he's committed enough hallelujah he's the Almighty he's not backing off of his promises he is committed to you whoa when you look at two lovebirds when they start coming down to a spot when they're coming down to a spot of engagement and they take on their marriage vows and you watch those true they are committing themselves to one another they're committing all that they are it's not that you're saying that all that I have is yours and all that you have is mine but you're saying you're saying everything that I have I'm giving you half of the kingdom you see marriage is not marriage marriage is give-and-take but there's some people that are more take than they are give they're always wanting to take from you they're always wanting to rob from you they're always taking but they're never given but marriage is a little bit of both brothers it's not her always taken but it's you having to give your will over you see there are some people that are definitely a whole lot lower than take their whole lot more take than they are give but if you watch those two young people as you watch them as they take on their vows that if they've got the mindset of walking into this marriage that if this one don't work well I'll just get another this ain't like a pair of underwear that when it gets worn out you can put on another one if you walk into a marriage thinking well if this don't work I'll just get a divorce I will show you some marriage a marriage that will not last if you walk into a job and say well if this job don't pay out and they don't give me a paycheck and if I get fired well I'll just go get another job I'll show you somebody that's not committed to the job you see when that marriage is taking place when you say for better or worse you better mean better or for worse because you don't know what's coming down the road I was speaking to sister Whitney when her and Davey were in their father when they were in their first steps of engagement and I looked at her she asked me what I thought I said do not make the come but unless you're willing that if this man is paralyzed interrex wrecked up or different things that you are willing to take care of him I didn't realize what I was saying would become a reality for sister Whitney but you watched as sister Whitney it was more than a love through the accident it was a commitment there she was committed to him on bad days and on good taste she was committed to him when it didn't feel good she was committed to him in the hospital he was committed to him in the rehab she was committed to him you see you see people that come together whoa we got to get married we're so in love but they're not committed to one another you will see a marriage that will never work young people I hope you hear me it's got to be a commitment that if they are ripped up in life if they're torn up in life that you're committed to them no matter what comes you see whoo now I'm gonna drop some to you God is committed to you whether you're in health or whether you're in sickness he's committed to you he's committed to you whether you're poor or whether you're rich whether you feel good whether you feel bad God's committed to you well the Bible says in Proverbs 6 and 30:16 3 commit thy works under the LORD thy God under the Lord and thy thoughts shall be established I wonder during this farm during this time when you're not able to come to the house of God when you're not able to be here you're not able to come to the altar and pertain or tell me the things that are pertaining to your life laid upon the later form the pastor's shoulder then he may pray for you and lay his hand upon you wonder in these moments what are you really hungry for what are the things that you're committed to what are the things that you're longing for what your hunger for darkness did your hunger for movies did you hunger for restaurants did you hunger for social parties of gathering together did you hunger for Matt March Madness did you hunger for ball games did you hunger for concerts Christian concerts or did you hunger for church did you feed your souls during this crisis did you feed your life during this crisis were you committed to the calls his word is always available restaurants aren't available movies aren't available concerts aren't available but the Word of God is available the Holy Spirit is available did you feed your soul is a God that has provided everything that you can ask of everything that you have need of you don't need me to lay my hands on you yes it is commission that I lay my hands on the sick and they shall recover but what about you what about you you're constantly sending notes to the pastor pay for this one pay for that one what about you committing your life to prayer I'm preaching to you today I'm preaching to you today that only inside of you he's a committed trust that whether Andrew Spencer is or helps whether you have the opportunity to text me or not whether you have the opportunity to call on call on brother on or not that you have a committed trust that you have the ability and the access of prayer to reach the throne are you committed are you committed I know this is I know this is a little bit down-home but let it be down-home if it puts you in rapture in tradition let it put you in rapture and condition be committed in this time last weekend we spoke to you on Satan's nightmare and fill-in your mouth with the Word of God it's filling your mouth with ideas and what you feel and what you see but filling your mouth with the Word of God brother Branham said it over over again he said only by your confession can you be saved he said notice that's the most powerful weapon that God put in the hand a man the most powerful weapon that God has put in the hand of man is a committal and the confession it'll do it every time if you believe it accepted on those basis and believe it and stay with it and keep confessing it the greatest weapon that's placed in your hand is a committal to God Lorraine says and he cares do you care he said I found among some people a lack of sincerity and I wonder why here was one man that was healed purpose or one one man in particular I'm speaking of the man had a great affliction and he was healed this night standing there and before we left five days the affliction the affliction was back to him again because in the presence of the Holy Spirit he took that off of him just like it did this young woman while ago out here in the yard and the young man last night but there must be a deep sincerity to know that the God that can take it away from you now with that same anointing can keep it away from you you're seeing then the Holy Spirit spoke to me one morning about May light and said get up on the platform in somewhere and bring these people up there and make them confess everything they did before you pray for them see the deepness of sincerity you see if you're committed to God and leave it there you can't plant a seed and go out the next day and pick it up see if you got a corn stalk of corn but you got to leave it there you gotta commit it to God and when you committed to God he will keep it away what would happen if we go to committing ourselves during this hour during this crisis during this moment what would take place if we go to committing ourselves to God today is about challenging you to believe to go higher to take a step higher to live at the next level to be committed to the message that's been delivered to you this is not a Pentecostal message this is an eagle message to take you higher stop floating with the rest of the world but raised above raised above what you see raised above the denominations yes the world's having their drive-ins and I'm not against drive-ins I'm not saying that yes the world is doing that but we don't want to be committed to what the world's doing we want to be committed to God what kind of people should we be if the Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't lose that you don't use your own thoughts that you don't use your own mind that you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built unto your thoughts and your being is God's Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be what kind of people would we be this morning if Brandon tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why when you don't even use your own mind don't even use your own thoughts no didn't even use no you merely old humility of your own but just to be led by the spirit what kind of people would we be if we were so embodied with the Holy Ghost if anyone should be shining in this moment it should be the bride of Jesus Christ this is a time to rise and trim your laugh for the bridegroom is coming for the random said that the real wick on the inside of that candle is a believer that believer has fire on one end and he's got on the other end it's dipped into the order and he's constantly burning constantly in the oil of the Holy Ghost he's constantly staying there hallelujah what a church what a power what a place to be in the place that God ordained us to be it's a time that we arise and trim off the world trim off the fashions of the world trim off the things of the world and get ready through the hours ahead the Bible says in Hebrews six and 11 and we desire that every one of you do the same show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope under the end that you be not slothful that you be not inactive but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises now you be not slothful that you be not be not slack be not inactive but be committed you see people that always want to change they want changes over here they want changes over there they want God to do a work in their life they were got areas in which they want God to do something but without a commitment nothing is ever going to happen you see a procrastinator is only good when they're threatened they're only good when they're put on the spot well I'll just wait till this happens or I'll just wait till the last minute and I'll get it done because they are procrastinators there are people there are preachers in this message that only study when it's their time to be called upon the preach it is old there are people in this message that never spend their time in the word only when they know they're going to church because they're not committed they're procrastinating well I'll just wait for the preacher I'll just wait for the perfect time and they're procrastinating and they're only good when you put their position on the spot you see God don't like laziness and I don't like laziness and if you are lazy God can't use you there are some people that have never thrown themselves said anything they'll put offshore they'll put all themselves into everything they want the ass this is the age of our iPhone iMac and iPad and all these things and it's all about me me me me me ah ah but they're never concerned or committed to God they've never given themselves given their all to anything so how can they give their all to God when they don't even know how to do it in the natural you see a people that have never been committed and some of the most uncommitted people are the most talented people that I know of because talented people will lay upon their talents and use their talent to cover up their lack of commitment and because they're talented enough to get by they will aimlessly run through life and make themselves see that they're committed you're not committed you're just talented enough to get by you never know what you could have been if you threw all of yourself or really committed all of your life you're just talented enough to get by they're just acting apart they're going through the motions they just want to smack on the back from the preacher but if the preacher can't be there shake their hand talk to them and encourage them they're not committed well I'll just get back to church when the government says we can get back to church I've been having but I have been having church every day but the Allen's been working at my house every day I walk out there for the Allens listen in the toilet ain't been around and studying these brothers and sisters they're in they are in this message they didn't come to talk about the message they come to get in the message they're committed they're not just acting apart but you see some people are never sold out to the idea they're never truly born again well I'm just doing this because they're only serving God for the benefits some people only pay their ties because they know they know that God has a blessing that is behind their times but they never do it because out of the abundance of the heart they only do it they only do it because they want the benefit package you ever been around somebody that's a whole lot better on paper than they are in person you get some people you get some people on a computer or man they're a bulldog they'll rip your head off they'll tell you what you are what you should be and what you ought to be doing they'll tell you how to preach they'll tell you what you need to preach they'll tell you how to speak they'll tell you how not to speak they'll tell you all these things but get them in person they once was a bulldog on the other side of that computer but there are wiener dog when they get in front of you because you see they are only a paper dragon they're not committed to what they're really saying they are some people can sure talk a good talk but they can never walk what they say they're not committed to the cause and they're not committed to this message that God gives them all they can tell you how to preach but they never preach today in their sight in their life they never got up and testified oh if I was you I'd preach it like this way I want to know if you've testified to the milk man to the bread man to the UPS man to the FedEx man and once you but not testify to them then I might give you a chance to tell me your testimony some people hold mouth they'll tell you everything they got on their mind you better save what you got on your mind you may need that tension some people they're a whole lot better on paper you can look at stats of of individuals of sports man on paper on paper they should be outperforming other people but when they get in person they're never living up to the statistic in which they should be living I know people personally that don't have an education that will outwork form out thrive people that have degrees people that have walls of degrees and people that don't have an education will outwork filled out serve them out I'll do them because they are willing to put the effort in they're willing to grind it out willing to get in did the shoulders go to get their feet dirty and dive in that's the kind of people that God is looking for look at our prophet seventh grade education mark made fun of but he stood he stood in the face of the ecclesiastical giants of the day he had no peer that he could look to he was the only man that said he'd met an angel he didn't have an education they made fun of him because he said his hits and his hates and his hopes and his boats and different things he said he said Pope read it sent a pope in and they made fun of him but they could not stand against the enemy because they were not truly committed you look at the rich young ruler young people we point to the rich young ruler we look at him look at the leadership look at his influence and look at those Saints but look at it this morning he was unable to commit all the way sure he could do all the easy things sure I could serve God when it please his mom and daddy sure I can serve God but when things are in my corner sure I can serve God anybody can do easy things but the rich young ruler refused to make the investment you see he was born he was born to be and said at the throne that sit there at Jesus's feet but he allowed the distract myths of life and the monies of life and hid the the cause of Jesus and the cause of the commandments of God became irrelevant to the cause that he was living in you see it had become it had become so irrelevant to him because he was unable to commit to the things of God you see you cannot reap where you have not sown and you cannot sew where you're not willing to go but where you're willing to go you can reap there where you're willing to sew it you say I want a blessing in my family you say I wanna know anything in my family you say I want to buy more power for prayer life in my family you say I want a greater walk with my family you will watch somebody that is totally devoted totally dedicated because they are willing to go to the extent to breathe a purpose to bless you watch somebody that's willing to channel the power or challenge the talent or challenge the gift that they've been placed in their life that they won't waste their talents and they won't waste their opportunities that they have been given in life but the random said that every generation gets a fresh chance at the word every one of you have been given an opportunity for the same message that I have been given this generation has an opportunity this morning but will you waste your talents and will you waste your opportunities Butler on sent me his devotion this morning and it was about it it was about a preacher in generations gone by and this man this preacher this clergyman was there and went to the bedside of a dying man mister dying man all of his life had never testified of the power of God he was a weak Christian he was real shy about telling about what Jesus did for him and as the clergyman was laying there sitting beside his bedside the dying man said oh I could just shop the prices of God he said why didn't you do it when you are living why didn't you why didn't you take the opportunity to testify and shout the praises of God when you had people surrounding you you say well you said well I don't I'm just too shy to do it some people will criticize you some people talk about the way you sing but they'll never get up they'll never do anything they'll never put in a hard day's worth of work so they don't know what it is to put in a hard day's worth of work but the Bible sentence and I say a 16-1 arise and shine a rising sound for the light is coming the glory of the Lord is risen upon me you see now is the time it is not the time to waste opportunities it is not the time to waste the talents that you've been given right now is the time to Bree right now is the time to dig here right now is the time to get committed to God this is a time that he's one to set you free this is the time where he's wanting to watch you work when you're all alone well Ron's got a statement my faith that ain't can't be tested can't be trusted if you cannot overcome on your own you cannot overcome in public you see everybody can overcome when everybody's around them making them pump pump them up and make them feel good but when you're all alone in the past right there and y'all going tearing your Deacon a tear and the preacher ain't there well I you know I was going to do this as a song says excuses excuses we hear them every day excuses excuses you see everybody's got excuses for why they didn't do this so while they did commit their life to God but so did the rich young ruler he had his excuses but inhale inhale he lifted up his voice I said let father Abraham come and dip my tongue with a cold dip of water let me go back and testify let me go back and testify to my brothers and my family there you should have done it why you had a chance when daddy uses that song I'm going to praise the Lord while I have a chance but I may not have a chance anymore there's a lot of people that are wishing that they would have served God there's a lot of people that wish they would have committed their life to God I was praying with a young man one time had a spirit of witchcraft and the spirit of rebellion on him and I watched as the Spirit of the Lord became ever so near and begin to discern the various secrets of his heart and I watched the light of the Holy Ghost circled that boy and I watched a window of darkness just begin to fade away and the light begin to enter in but all of a sudden that spirit of witchcraft and rebellion closed up that window and he shut down his opportunity you see he was not willing to commit to his freedom he loved living with that spirit and if you loved worshiping a sickness there ain't no need for me praying for you there ain't no need for me giving my all when you're not willing to commit yourself you see if you're not willing to give it all you're going to get half the results you see if you put in half the work you get half the results and you wonder why you're never no further than you are today we got a note just this past week from a man that's in prison and then he's relayed a story about a time that he walked to this altar and he said that the pastor spoke to him and said now I can't do it for you and he said I walked away and I didn't get it you see he turned down his day of visitation you're in prison you can live Rock sure in prison you can overcome but when you're out and lay out seal are you willing to commit your life are you willing to give your Hall are you willing to give everything come on somebody it's easy to serve God when you got a good job but can you serve when you've been fired can you serve God when you like when you let go can you commit your ways when things ain't good can you commit you away when the doctor says he got four months or can you commit yourself when you know that you're going by the way of the grave can you still commit yourself this is life you cannot just dream yourself into character you gotta work you gotta grind it out you've got to be willing to stay whether you bother you got to be willing to sit there and you got to be willing to you say you got to be willing to give it all you shoot for the stars every single time whether you hit a stump every time and on you keep shooting for the stars you keep pressing this battle you can say I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me you need to come down to a spot in your life and you say I'm wholly committed to God for this is the whole duty of man to commit my ways yeah I can dress right when all my other sisters are around and the sisters are around and they're they're making me they're making me they're making me be their what they're making me be convicted to dress right sure I can do it sure I can be committed but can you be committed when you're all alone can you be committed when there ain't nobody when the brothers are around you sure you can wear your shorts all around you won't - you won't wear them when you're around their brothers and sister but you'll wear them around when you know a million ain't nobody else around oh yeah you know you know summer times coming up and you just getting ready to break him sorts out and whew I'm gonna get myself a good tan ain't nobody wants to look at your knock knees on your hairy legs sure you can dress right when everybody else is around but are you committed that when the pastor don't see are you committed to live right a lot of people want supervisor pay but they don't want supervisor responsibilities a lot of people want the ruiers but they don't want the risk but you see a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory when you look at the Olympic athletes when they give their all when they give their energies when they spend years preparing for just a short moment of time to stand on a podium going for a little-bitty medal they'll starve themselves to death they need no whoppers and they eat no Big Macs norther are they eat enough healthy fries that you can get now these are not dipped in this certain kind of oil these are dipped and avocado hard you can have these and these are better for you they need no french fries they are starving themselves for one purpose to get on a podium for three minutes and stand there America America they stand there for three minutes waiting they spend the whole life waiting for these three moments where everybody can clap at them and he'll go hang that medal up they have spent their lifetime in pain they spent their lifetime getting ready and preparing for just a little bit of glory but God God is not offering you a lifetime of glory he's offering you an eternity of glory God is asking for first place God is asking for your priorities God is asking for your whole heart God is asking for total commitment hallelujah if you could ever get out of the rut of a spiritual laziness where you don't give your all but you can get out and say hey I was born to give it all I was born to overcome I was born to be committed I was born to take a rapture that's the branch commitment is to stay true in the moments of a pandemic the Bible says in Psalms 119 and 2 blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart Jeremiah 29 and 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart he don't want your mind he don't want your strength he don't even want all of your energies he wants your heart because if he's got your heart he's got your energies if he's got your heart he's got your mind if he's got your heart he's got your strength if he can only get your heart today brothers and sisters oh if he can only get on the inside of the inside I'm not just talking on the flesh realm and not just talking in your spirit I'm talking on the inside of your soul if he could get your heart he's got a human being whether come here or come high water they're committed they can walk through hell knowing that they're committed because they gave their whole heart to God the burn of my her brother burns say it this week in a prisoner he says sometimes I believe one of the greatest things that I found in this day is the lack of sincerity of what we believe he didn't say what all our works all our efforts but in what we believe if God in the days of John Wesley would have done in that day what he has done today what would it have done in the days of Martin Luther oh what more as what we see him doing both proven by the church or by the spirit and by science and every move it's emotion has to recognize and God's Word here declaring it and telling it before it comes to pass and then moving on and prophesy and showing the very thing that he said he'll come to pass perfectly exactly what he said and still we sit kind of slothful as if we wonder or wondering if that could mean me wondering if it could mean just the church in the whole or wonder if I'm really included in this we sit there with a lack of sincerity of what we believe and there's going to be people I don't see everybody here today because I don't see where your listeners this at but there's gonna be people to listen to this today and say hey you wasn't talking about me he was talking about her you see they got that pitchfork of religion they just pitch it right on over he's not talking about me I'm committed oh yeah you're just talented talented and pitching it over on the neighbor but the Bible says in Romans 12 and 11 not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation continuing on instant in prayer let me give it to you in the plant in the pass in translation be enthusiastic to serve the Lord keeping your passion toward him bowling heart radiate with the glow of the Holy Spirit and let him fill you with the excitement as you serve him you see nothing is ever achieved unless you've got enthusiasm you won't go to work and really work to your full capacity if you don't like your job you see the reason why I have been successful in business is because I like what I do you see the reason why you see souls being saved for the ministry or brother Ron Spencer is because he loves what he does there have been thousands of people that have told brother on you need to slow down you know you really need to slow down but I still want you to come to my June meeting I still want you to come in July still once you come in August and brother on through all of these treatments all of this battle all this cancer what do you think he's doing you think he's just laying around on the couch eating eating Cheetos and having himself a mountain Dew he's digging in he's eating this word and we as a people are coming to pray for him that maybe next weekend maybe the weekend after that maybe the next month after that he'll be in this pulpit preaching us again he's not just laying around he's studying the Word of God with everything that's within him because he realizes the power of this word will with the devil anytime anyplace under any circumstance he's enthused about it why would you preach something like this brother Andrew it is a challenge to believe it is a challenge to rise higher sure there sings in every single one of our lives even in the preacher's life there's things that he could commit more to God biggest thing that the bride maybe I shouldn't say the bride but the biggest thing that people deal with today is that little thing they carry in their pocket it ain't necessarily little thing they carry in the pocket ain't necessarily things they look at on fox news but it's a four-letter word they're committed more to reading what trump says what Biden does what this one does or what the hell one does more than what God says you can read Fox News tomorrow morning and it's going to tell you maybe a stat of fifty three fifty four thousand people have died in America because of this but can I give you a stat from the Bible that we overcame him by the blood of the lamb in the word of our testimony that we love not our lives unto the death that there is a people that no weapon that is formed begins them shall prosper Oh hallelujah there's a people that is greater that is he that is in them than he that is in the world there's a people that's the stats that I'm pointing through this morning people that's committed to God not just when they got friends around them not just when they got to Pastor round you say well oh I just ain't got to around me to rally me up brother Andrew let me ask you something let me point out some characters to you look at Daniel and the three Hebrew children they were the only four that we have record Hough throughout the Babylonian captivity that remained committed and they read they remain committed and did not cave in to the brainwashing of the Babylonian people but they stayed committed through captivity to the one true God and the Bible said that Daniel purposed in his heart not to defile himself with the king's drink he didn't have nobody else around him but he purposed in his heart that I will not defile myself with the things of Laodicea you see we make our decisions and our decisions turn around and make us whether good or bad we make our decisions and her decisions turn around and make us you see a choice in time yields a destiny in eternity just like when Ruth was standing there with Naomi and Orpah sin drew said where you go I will go your where you large I would Hajj your people my people your God my God where you die I will die she wise committed not to turn back not to turn back to Moab and the things of the world but to press the battle that was in front of her well the bantam said that I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God to the devil don't know what to do with that's a committed Christian a man could so completely serve God to the devil don't know what to do what to do with I'd say that the Apostle Paul was that kind of a man when he would say in first Corinthians 2 and 2 for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified here's a man that knew the letter better than anybody else but he determined not to know anything but the Lord Jesus Christ can look at Paul to see all that he went through of him murdering the Christians a the persecution of the church and his experience on the road to Damascus but the homra would always say that the devil Menace max when he met Paul because Paul was not a coward Paul was persuaded that neither death nor life nor things present nor things come would be able to separate him from the love of God Paul was not a coward Paul was committed and the biggest trouble with people today in the church today is a bunch of fear they're always scared they're scared of the devil mother banner said don't be scared be brave you don't have nothing to be afraid of about it was so committed Paul was so committed that he stood there in Acts chapter 28 when it had to prison guard standing around him he said Here I am bound with this chain he was so committed in a dungeon that there were guards that wanted to be assigned to his detail as Paul was sitting there in a dungeon and rats running around snakes running around different things going around those days and pause they were not blessing most days imposed they were not perfect but Paul remained committed to the cause of Jesus Christ because he had one thing an experience and when Paul was standing there in 2nd Corinthians 11 and 24 and Paul is proving his vindication of being a prisoner of Christ against and he's proven to the false anointed ones that he was committed to all that he went through 2nd Corinthians 11 and 24 but I've been through some things with Andrew you just don't understand of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one price was i beaten with rods once was i stolen fries suffered shipwreck a night in the day I've been in a deep in journeyings often in perils of waters and perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold nakedness beside those things which are without that which cometh upon me daily the day the care of all the churches who is weak and I am NOT weak who is offended and I'm banned I burn not if I must needs go hurry I will Gloria the things which concern my infirmities the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed forever more noise then I'll are not Colossians 3 and 23 whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the Lord and not in the men knowing that knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ the bride isn't just serving him because of a status she's committed to him she's committed to him when it looks like the wagon will never come down the road when it looks like the baby ain't come and Abraham and Sarah were still committed when it looked like the promise was being taken away and Jobe would still say that though God slay me yet I will trust him Joseph when he was in a dungeon he still was committed when he was tempted when he was tempted by Potiphar's wife he was still committed there was no brother's around him but he was committed I heard a story about a blind woman from Canada that one golf tournaments all over the US and all over Canada a blind woman the only thing her husband would travel with her and he would line her up in the direction that she needed to hit the ball she won tournaments all over the pros would come and they'd watch this lady they'd watch her as she would as she would swing and they watched her stroke how that it was perfect they said well I couldn't do anything like that she did not allow her limitations to hold her back you look at men you look at men that play the piano that are blind that although they did they started to do they sit down at the piano and they started to play and they asked that God would anoint him they were blind you look at Fanny Crosby when you look at her which she was so enormous to write some of the most anointed and powerful songs of the Christian of the Christian realm but she would not sell out because she was committed to him she could had money she could have had Fame and they mocked her and they scorned her and she wrote the song that I will know him I will know him how will you know him by any crosby I will know him by the nail prints in his hands she was committed to lay it all on the line you look at Beethoven when he got to a spot in his life he could no longer he could no longer perform in his way he did not allow his limitations to stop him he was committed to his talent he chopped the legs off of his piano and he learned how to play by vibrations he did not allow his limitations to hold him back look at Clinton Cunningham he was burned in a fire as a young boy as a school as a school fire and they told him that he would die and he didn't and he made it through they told him that he never walked again that he would be committed to that wheelchair for the rest of his life and that day after day he would go out and throw himself out of that wheelchair pull himself by the picots of a fence build strength dragging his feet dragging his legs and his legs all to pieces I said I will not be bound to a wheelchair and he finally reestablish held a walk and then he started running and he was the first man to ever run a four-minute mile a man that said that he would never walk he did not allow his limitations to hold him back brother Branham said that if you can eliminate God you limit Christ and if you limit the church today in its possibilities you're limiting God but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe and usually receive them and you shall have them these people did this in a naturally realm but a what about you little bride what about you and your own spiritual determination will you go further will you press the battle that's what the voice said to brother Branham when he was coming back from beyond the curtain of time press the battle press the battle press the battle let's say if homer Fraser Steve Thomas big brother Mickelson they holler out to us press the battle stay committed stay in line stay in line little brah get back in line little bride Oh hallelujah you watched my little wife this morning get up and sing so embarrassed to stand in front of people so shocked so so even shook up their even stand in front of people but because of her commitment to serve God she wanted to put what God wanted first what if we would give 100% of our self what are the things that you've been holding back all of your life what if you would have the determination like a little Mexican woman they had a little bit baby that died with pneumonia and nine o'clock in the morning but she heard that there was a healer in the land and there was 300 Usher's that would not stop her that could not stop her and Billy came and said daddy there's a little woman back there that's trying to get to you that we can't stop Oh hallelujah and her determination allowed her to push through her circumstance push past strength of man to get to where brother Randall was what if you would push past your fears I know I ain't got you screaming at me today but I want you to scream it on that side of the telephone and that side of the internet why are you holding back what are you willing to give wait what if you gave all brother Branham said what type of people should we be today we're not asking for you to tell us what you're going to do but show us what you're going to do brother BAM said live me a sermon don't preach me sir the people will receive it hold on more well I got a headache I can't come to church wake ain't nobody come to church right now except for the few chosen but thank God we're not the frozen Chosin but when I kicked coming back to church I'm over you know this is one thing I've wondered you know normally when the song leader gets done and the preacher starts to take his position there's a halftime I wonder how many of you have had to go use a restroom while you've been sitting in your lazy boy but you'll come back to church and about 35 to 45 minutes in and you'll go running back to the bathroom because a little Johnny or a little Suzy says you know what I just gotta go but are you committed in your own house they're doing the same thing that you did in church I want to see it when you come praise God well I'm not gonna come to church because I got a headache and I've got I've got all kinds of circumstances and and you know I just I just been feeling really blue this is the best place that you could be in when you're feeling down whether you're feeling up whether you're feeling down granddaddy look at him had his leg cut off and still wanted to be in church and his leg cut off and still preach to you this gospel was feeling bad taking medicine during service but still wanted to say it man still wanted to preach I'd say that we have had leaders in front of us for gospel lighthouse to challenge us to rise to the challenge to be committed to God with everything that is within us every time I walk out of that back office back there I say God I commit my all of my fibers my beings if you want to make me drunk in a spirit make me slobber all over this place make me dance make me shout do whatever I admit myself do you some people don't want to go down to that altar boohoo and make their sever mess and come back they're afraid they're gonna wash the mascara off their face I don't want that unless you're willing to go to the Pigpen you know willing don't put in half the work expecting the full reward hello somebody I'm preach to do myself here today I'm preaching every single one of you today let's dig in like never before let's pray like never before let's be out there let's be let's dive in hallelujah let's be live voices let's be live forces brother branham said mother bantams said now everybody can't be a preacher we had a young man one time come here stood in the back office with me and brother on where I'm preaching today let me just go ahead I'm preaching this young man he come back here and said brother Ron the Lord has sent me back here so that I can help you preach this gospel but Ron look at me so what you think but Dad Andrew well don't look too good for my he said son until you can be fully committed you'll not stand behind this pulpit this young man had moved from here moved from there but yet he wanted to breach the gospel this man never had a birth but yet he wanted to preach the gospel this man had studied had spent his time thought he had had himself a sermon prepared but he did not know how to live right when it comes to Monday you think I'm gonna allow you stand behind this pulpit and you don't even know how to live right Paul cry walk right absolutely not brother Miriam said now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher oh I wanted to position it ain't about the position it's about living it you're still a preacher but live the people sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that'll bring reproach to them who rejected they say no one can put a finger on his life or her life their sweet living if there ever was a man of God it's a man or a woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you'll get all mixed up anyhow and mess up and you'll get people tangled up or you'll ruin them and you'll ruin yourself to just live your sermon the preachers called to preach this and deliver to and if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons alright how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of live voices the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and in holiness purity undefiled laughs walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir that's the thunder against the enemy now that's Satan's worst nightmare the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil are you ready it ain't what makes ain't you shall make make are you talking in tongues ain't you jumping up and down screaming but weren't hurts the devil is to see that sanctified Holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on now I say because there are some times there's an old man that wants to come rising up when somebody says something about my dad who said something but my wife says something about my children there's a man on the inside wants to raise up but then the Holy Ghost says shut up shut up Andrew he st. your time to speak walk on that's what scares the devil is to see that holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be and move right on threat that froze him away that's the Sun Thunder that shakes the devil now I could read you the I could read you the quote - that you brother BAM said you could try to be so humble and oh you got us a wishbone and the devil beat you every which way around but there are spots in your life you need to humble yourself down live a real sweet holy consecrated life now I know I'm not alone cuz I know the kind of people they setting this church sure we want to rise up but why don't we let God arise why don't we let God speak instead of putting forth our mouth and our sense and our thoughts let's let him speak let's let God speak let's like blood live when I'm trying to live right I'm trying to do this I'm trying to commit my ways just uh just this message came to produce live voices not a mechanical tape the jeffersonville wants to produce today I think it's amazing it brother Ron brother Branham would say oh how we need today in Jefferson vo thousands of live voices he didn't say we need tape players he says we need to live voices people that'll live this message the devil ain't scared of your tape player because your tape player can be employed but you can't be unplucked because you are plugged in you're plugged in to the source of power and yeah the enemy can make you sick but yet there's still a power on the inside of you that's greater than a tape player greater than a CD it's the power of Almighty God Paul said I am persuaded I am committed as I finish with this alts and the musicians come may you be able to say these things that I have committed no matter the sickness no matter the enemy no matter the punches I take no matter the troubles I see no matter the doctors report no matter the test results no matter what the critics say no matter what they say no matter what the agnostics say no matter what the unbelievers say no matter how I feel no matter what comes no matter what goes no matter who stands with me and who doesn't stand with me quitting is not an option turning around is not an option recanting is not an option and giving up is not an option you're his elect you're his chosen your placed here at Satan's Eden to be committed to overcome to be victorious not to be overrun by your own self to be filled of him and to keep your eyes on him we must work while it is day for night cometh when the hour when no man can come as Jesus said I must be about my father's business a twelve-year-old boy a twelve-year-old boy that had not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost at the time but twelve years old said I must be about my father's business may we be committed how much more having received the baptism of the Holy Ghost to stand in the face of opposition in the face of the enemy said I am committed to the cause of Jesus Christ his pledge is his word he's obligated to you to take care of you but will you take care of him will you take care will you give your all housewife's you think oh how in the world can I give my all more I'm watching - this is all I can take care of the hamper I'm taking care of the laundry I'm taking care of this be committed to stay in this message this is where rapturing faith is it's right here in this message right here in this message right here in this message one less salt mother Brennan said be determined don't be defeated you can't be defeated you're children of God I know sometimes as mamas and daddies you get disturbed by what goes on in your household but don't let that shake you and your faith stay committed I know sometimes you you want the promise to come to pass sooner than what it is but he's the one that is committed and bringing it to pass god only requires for you to do your part I stay committed whether you see it whether you're doing to stay focused on the promise that God they said ah and accepting that obligation love you now I saw her I want to see the miracle I want to see the miracle but God is under obligation to his own word not to my feelings not to my emotions but he's obligated to his word and if I and the as you could ever realize that you've taken your veil and you've placed it over on him now if you take it off of him you're showing that you are not committed to him and he's not committed to you but just leave it the hair on his shoulder you see the Bible says Jesus said that by the finger the enemy is kicked out notice he can kick the enemy out with his finger but when it comes to carrying out of sheep he places him upon his shoulder upon the strongest part of the man's body where all of his strength is being shown that's where he's caring in you and all of his words that he's had to you let's bow our hearts this mornin Heavenly Father we come before your throne of grace lord I did not choose to preach this sermon because of people are uncommitted or anything that they even see but because I felt a push of the Holy Ghost to speak these things this is not a time to rely upon our talents and be reluctant be procrastinators but it is a time you're calling for a true committal be gone may we just leave this harvested day with this song that the greatest one of the greatest weapons it's placed in a man is a community garden if I only would have said those few words right there I believe the sermon was entitled was completely set out in those words father you heard the much speaking that was done today father you see or every word that was spoken maybe one for a year one for them or even one for myself God may we be challenged to stay true to this gospel surely this message throw to you well we don't see the promise coming in due time on which we want maybe not take her veil off of your souls or there's a whole lot of towns going which is one a ton we just want the nightmare we just want the dream or we just want the thing to stop coming but you have allowed these things to happen for preparedness in a heart to me because of the coronavirus it has not made me study more it's not necessarily made me pray more but I'm sure there is some that have prayed more they've had more time to pray he had more time to study lord I will say it has made me aware that you are very near to see the warfare of germs to see the things that your prophet is said Lord our hearts are stirred Lord we want to be accounted worthy to escape the things that article Oh God I can't go around make choices for people or even I can't make people Brian I can't even make my own self pride but I can't choose you as my savior that's my dealer is my wave maker is my promise keeper I choose you but I certainly feel on the inside of my heart that you have called me abroad by the phase that I've heard the mighty angel disperse to us Lord Jesus may we be committed to eat not just half of the book by the hope even the parts and terrors from lending limit scenes may we eat it may we swallow it may we double chiton let it go down sure it's gonna cause war in our belly but may it produce film that prophesy again may we be as a congregation of Full Gospel icons fulfill our purpose or our portions we've seen the mighty angel standing we've seen the mysteries of God revealed by revelations since 7 may we fulfill our purpose or our force in the revelations 10 8 through 11 may we prophesy again may we be committed to the call the Lord these words are true these are the true sayings of God I've committed my life to God maybe they're setting in their homes people are committing their lives to you repenting of things they've done wrong or said wrong or maybe even would ask if it'd be a way that I can lay my hands on they don't meet my hand they just need you to lay your hands upon I pray that you'd instruct them in the way that they should go teach them may we not rely upon our talents we're all gifts may we not turn down the opportunities that we've been given may we throw our whole self the things of God and may you be pleased with the outcome name of Jesus Christ they make me more like you if you have to break me Lord bless the broken pieces [Applause] I [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Applause] [Music] yes the vision of the Mamas snake is coming and it couldn't come here he said there was something that held it off I'd say there's Lord's been here holding things off but maybe it went after one that was weak he said it went after his brother went after he said the angel said you've been given power to bond been given power to loosed an angel said you must be honest he wasn't saying that brother Branham wasn't sincere but he was calling for a deeper sincerity if he would ask the Prophet to be more sincere what about us what about our focus what about our life say Oh God that's reverse that's a murse [Music] we just want to be committed to you more and more every day may God richly bless you where you're at now urania remain committed through this time whether you
