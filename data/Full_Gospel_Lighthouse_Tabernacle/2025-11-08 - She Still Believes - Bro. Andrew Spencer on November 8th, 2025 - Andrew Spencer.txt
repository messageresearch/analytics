With my faith all [singing] but gone, I met that one [music] who came looking for me. He [music] came looking for me.

[music] Lord, truly that is our desire is that the Holy Spirit would cover us, Lord Jesus. Lord, that you would be the atonement over our lives and that that peace that passes all understanding. [music] Lord, you would hide us in the shadow of the Almighty. Lord, we would ask Lord God, today that [music] you would come, Lord. We are a needy people. And what a privilege it is for us as your children to call upon the God of heaven, Lord, to realize how close that you've been this past week, Lord. to see you working through every situation. [music] Problems that have arisen, Father, circumstances that seem to not go away. Lord, you have been right there all that time. Father, we thank you for your mercies that are new every morning. Lord, we thank you for your presence that we feel in [music] this place. Lord, we're so thankful that we have the ability to be able to echo out [music] the praises of the most high God. And we ask, Lord Jesus, that our praise that has went forth to you, that it would be pleasing to you, Father, that it would go up as a sweet savor, an incense to the most high, and that you would allow your Holy Spirit to come and reside over your children tonight. Lord, we desire, Lord, to have fellowship with the master. Lord, to walk in the cool of the evening time, [music] Lord, there's something special about an evening service. Lord, it's when you would come down and you would walk with your children. And Father, if we could just realize it's that kind of an atmosphere in this place tonight that you would want to walk through the garden of your word and minister to your children. Father, I pray, Lord. Lord, I would like to be like Adam and Eve tonight and just maybe hook my arm over in your arm. Just begin to walk through the word, Lord, and let the people realize that it's not a man, [music] it's not me. I have nothing to do with this really. I'm just a microphone. But I pray Lord for those that may doubt. I pray that you would give them inspiration to believe. Lord, I pray for those that would question. I pray that you would just answer the very things that upon their [music] life. For every situation here, we invite the Lord, the Lord to come and take control. We humble ourselves in your presence just now. We pray God for your word to be blessings to our body. Lord, as we will receive it unto our soul, Lord, may it give us strength to go through life's journey. Father, we love you so much. We thank you for your presence that we feel. [music] We invite you to come and break the word just now in Jesus name. Amen. [music] And amen. If you have your Bibles this evening, we'd like to look over in the book of Joshua chapter 2 and John 11 verse1 17. Man, [clears throat] Joshua chapter 2 and verse one and Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shidam two men to spy secretly. It's always amazing to me that he didn't send out 12 like Moses did. He sent out two because two was the ones that came back with a true report. Two men to spy out secretly saying, "Go view the land, even Jericho." And they went and came into a harlot's house named Rahab and lodged there. John 11 and verse 17. Say amen when you have it this evening. Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about four or 15 furongs off. Many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother. Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him. But Mary sat still in the house. I believe that's a way a lot of people do &gt;&gt; when they know that Jesus is coming. They're still sitting in the house. Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; There's a lot we could say right there. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou had us been here, my brother had not died. But I know But I know that even now, &gt;&gt; whatsoever thou will ask God, God will give it thee. Notice she never lost her faith. She had went through the trial of her life, but she had not lost her faith in him. &gt;&gt; But I know that even now that whatsoever thou will ask God, God will give it thee. And Jesus saith unto her, "Thy brother shall rise again." Woo, that's powerful. Martha said unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. And Jesus said unto her, I am &gt;&gt; woohoo. I am the resurrection and the life. And he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die, believest thou this. And she saith unto him, "Yay, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world." And when she had so said, she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, "The master has come and calleth for thee." As soon as she heard that, she came. She arose quickly and came unto him. May God bless his word. You may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord. I'd like to speak to you a little thought that God's laid on my heart for this service here tonight on she still believes. She still believes. Brother Random said in the same Jesus tonight in Switzerland, he said that God was in that man. She ran to him and she fell on her face the right way of approach. She looked up at him and give him right the right title and she said,"Lord, if thou wouldest have been here, my brother would not have died." Look at the reverence. Now look, here's a faithful heart by the side of the fountain. It's got to happen coming the provided way. She recognizes him as Lord in the faith in the face of death. She still believes him in the face of death. She still believes him. I think that sometimes when we go through our deepest of crisises that we begin to lose sight of who really is amongst us. But I think it's wonderful that Martha didn't lose hope. I think it's wonderful that we've got a testimony in Martha when she was busy about the work when Jesus was sitting there and fellowshipping over the word of life. When the real trial came on there, Martha was very, very showing her very colors that God had put on the inside of her that even in the face of death, she still believes him. Because anybody can believe Jesus when things are going good. Anybody can believe Jesus when everything is working out according to their plan. But when things go ary and things start to get a little clamored and maybe they maybe they begin to get a little hazy and you can't see the picture as clear. I wonder if YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT HE'S STILL JESUS WHEN THINGS OF LIFE begin to get in to turmoil. NOW THE PROPHET SAID IN FROM THAT TIME he said as I was speaking the other night he said now the natural man has only five senses but the believer when he meets God he gets something different. Are you with me? When the believer meets God, he gets something different. He said it's a super sense. He said that lifts him above the shadows. Hallelujah. It makes him believe that things impossible come to pass. That's a real believer. THINGS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE ARE ABLE to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He still believes they will come to pass because God said so. And when a man meets God, something takes place. You know good and well that in your LIFE BEFORE YOU MET GOD, YOU were filled with all kinds of doubt and unbelief and fear. But as SOON AS YOU MET THE MASTER, IT WAS IN THAT MOMENT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TRANSPIRED IN YOUR LIFE. THE PILLAR OF FIRE COME LOOKING JUST FOR YOU. WHY? BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT YOU WAS BORN TO BELIEVE WITH. And &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS GENERATION. I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN DEPOSITED IN THIS GENERATION to give the PEOPLE OF GOD A FAITH to believe for the supernatural. I'll just say it like THIS IS THAT MELZDC HAS COME IN DUST AGAIN IN THE REALM OF FLESH AGAIN AND PUT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF THAT VESSEL SO THAT YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE WHO HAS COME WALKING. NOT ANOTHER MELZDC. NOT A MELZDC OF 4,000 YEARS AGO. AND NOT A MELZDC OF 2,000 YEARS AGO, BUT THIS MELZDC HAS COME AGAIN IN A BRIDE FORM. HALLELUJAH. AND HAS COME AND MINISTERED TO A PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO BELIEVE AGAINST OUR ODDS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So many times people come and say, "Well, I wish I had great faith." And I love what the prophet said to that. He said, 'Well, you had faith enough to come to church, didn't you? HE SAID, 'WELL, YOU TAKE THAT SAME KIND OF FAITH THAT YOU GOT TO COME TO CHURCH AND YOU put it in his hands. And he said, when you put it in his hands, when you put it IN HIS HANDS, THEN THE MIRACLE HAS GOT TO TAKE PLACE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRODUCE MIRACLES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE THAT LITTLE SIMPLE FAITH that you got and place IT IN THE HANDS OF THE MASTER. I WONDER DO YOU STILL BELIEVE? &gt;&gt; You see WE BECOME A BYPRODUCT OF THE ENVIRONMENT that we are in. I I believe that I believe that many of times that we are whether you can accept IT OR NOT IS THAT YOU MAKE ACTIONS and reactions according to the environment that you are in. And you know good and well that there have been times in your life if you can look back THAT YOU REACTED TO CERTAIN SITUATIONS A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE OF THE certain influence that you were in or the environment that you were in in that certain moment. BUT IF YOU WOULD LOOK BACK TO THAT CERTAIN PARTICULAR time when you made that rash DECISION FROM THE SPOT THAT YOU'RE STANDING AT IN THIS MOMENT, YOU WOULD HANDLE THINGS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVING FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE. You see, NO MAN EVER STEPS in the water one man and EVER STEPS OUT THE SAME AGAIN. THE WATER'S NOT THE SAME AND THE MAN IS NOT THE SAME WHEN HE STEPS BACK IN THERE. I LOVE WHAT THE PROPHET SAID. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, WHAT ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE IN, JESUS WILL COME ANYWHERE YOU CAN BELIEVE. HE WILL COME ANYWHERE THAT YOU CAN BELIEVE. HE SHOWED UP IN A FIERY FURNACE ONE TIME. HE SHOWED UP IN A LION'S DEN ONE TIME. HE SHOWED UP IN THE BELLY OF A WHALE ONE TIME. HE SHOWED UP in a pig PIN WHEN A PRODAL WAS AWAY FROM HOME JUST TO PROVE THAT HE WAS GOD. I'LL SAY THIS THAT GOD SHOWED UP IN A CAR ONE TIME JUST TO PROVE THAT THIS WAS THE MINISTRY OF MALACHI 4. HE SHOWED UP IN THIS BUILDING ONE TIME JUST TO PROVE THAT HE WAS A HEALER. I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES HE SHOWED UP ACCORDING TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU ARE A PART OF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You begin to think about this family that Jesus had been so accustomed to spend time with. &gt;&gt; Ain't it wonderful to realize that Jesus wants to spend time at your house? &gt;&gt; They had become in such a place that they were bosom buddies. YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. THROUGH THE PROPHET'S MINISTRY, we're able to gather a glimpse into Lazarus's life beforehand. before he is known as a man that's raised from the dead. The prophet looks back into his past environments and sees him that he was born and he was wanting to be a scribe. He was wanting to do something for the Lord. AND SO HE WENT IN THERE AND HE WENT TO SCHOOL and he was studying to BE A SCRIBE. AND HIS SISTERS MARTHA AND MARY, THEY WERE MAKING TAPESTRIES for the temple and they were wanting to do something FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD. BUT WHEN JESUS CAME ALONG, HALLELUJAH, they got rid OF ALL THEIR TRADITIONS, THEY GOT RID OF THEIR FRIENDS, THEY GOT RID OF THEIR creeds just to begin to associate with Jesus. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A way that a lot of us have done. WE HAVE LEFT OUR FRIENDS. WE have left our families. We have we have left religion just to COME AND BE ACCUSTOMED WITH YOU. BE ACCUSTOMED WITH JESUS. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? I'D SAY A LOT OF YOU, IF YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU WERE IN BEFORE JESUS GOT A HOLD OF YOU, AND YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE IN CURRENTLY, YOU WOULD SAY THAT SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; Martha and Mary and Lazarus, THEY GAVE UP EVERYTHING. THEY HAD BEEN STUDYING THE MINISTRY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST, THE PROPHET SAID. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THAT LAZARUS WAS A CLOSE LISTENER TO JOHN THE BAPTIST. AND HE SAID HE GOT HE GOT TO PREACHING THAT THERE WAS A MESSIAH COMING. SO HE STARTED LOOKING FOR THAT MESSIAH. AND HE WAS THERE ON THAT DAY. HALLELUJAH. THAT THERE WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST SAW JESUS COMING SAID BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD WHICH TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. JOHN THE BAPTIST LOST HE LOST THE CONVERT THAT DAY BECAUSE LAZARUS WAS NO LONGER FOLLOWING JOHN THE BAPTIST. BUT HE WAS FOLLOWING JESUS. HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO FOLLOW JESUS. I WOULD SAY THIS, THEY LEFT EVERYTHING BECAUSE THEY WAS BELIEVERS. I KNOW YOUR STORY. I KNOW YOUR STORY. AND THE REASON WHY YOU ARE HERE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE A BELIEVER. YOU HAD TO SEPARATE AND TO LEAVE SOMETHING JUST TO FIND &gt;&gt; THAT he's still Jesus. &gt;&gt; You find this little girl. You go back into her life and you begin to see there's something about this girl. She's born in a different kind of environment. She's in an environment that she's forced in a very young age to go out and provide for her family and she's sent out there and she becomes a harlot. Now, how would you like it when your story is written in the Old and in the New Testament? &gt;&gt; You're w down as a harlot. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL ABOUT YOUR STORY. THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL ABOUT YOUR STORY IS THAT YOU DON'T STAY IN THE ENVIRONMENT, HALLELUJAH, that you was pushed into. YOU SEE THIS WOMAN RAHAB, SHE WAS FORCED BY HER MOTHER AND HER FATHER TO GO out there and to live a life of prostitution. SHE WAS RECORDED AS ONE OF THE TOP FIVE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN THROUGHOUT ALL THE GENEALOGIES AND HISTORY OF STUDYING WOMEN. THIS WOMAN RAHAB IS IN THE TOP FIVE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. But I love what the prophet said. But at the first opportunity that she had to accept God, she did it. &gt;&gt; You see, SHE REFUSED, HALLELUJAH, TO BE A PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT SHE WAS BORN INTO. A LOT OF PEOPLE, HALLELUJAH, &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE BORN IN A MESS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE BORN IN RAGS. HALLELUJAH. BUT THEY REFUSE TO STAY IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. [cheering] Brother Brandham said, he said it in W little Bethlehem. He said that I might add here. He said that I MIGHT ADD HERE. SHE TYPED THE GENTILE CHURCH. SHE WAS A GENTILE TYPE OF THE GENTILE CHURCH. WHEN THEY HEARD THE MESSAGE, WHEN WE WERE ALL OUT IN SPIRITUAL PROSTITUTION, COMMITTING COMMITTING SPIRITUAL FORNICATION, FORNICATION AGAINST GOD AND ALL OF HEAVEN AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF, ALL KINDS OF DENOMINATIONS and religions. Woo! Mercy, Jesus, WHEN YOU WAS OUT THERE SERVING THE LORD UNDER THE NAME OF A CATHOLIC, YOU WAS COMMITTING spiritual fornication. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love you. I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND I LOVE WHAT YOU CAME through the exomage. You didn't realize it, but you was committing spiritual fornication. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. COMMITTING SPIRITUAL FORNICATIONS AGAINST THE GOD OF HEAVEN AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF, ALL KINDS OF DENOMINATIONS AND RELIGIONS. BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THERE WAS A GOD THAT STILL LIVED AND COULD PERFORM MIRACLES, QUICKLY QUICKLY SHE RECEIVE THE MESSAGE. WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE HEARD THE WORD SOMETHING TOOK PLACE. NOW the prophet said it when he comes and preaches a door in a door. He said now this is very unusual setting that we see this morning in our scripture reading. He said it's unusual in many ways. He said because one of the it's one of the most pathetic scriptures that there is in the Bible here is this scripture. It's speaking of this age that we're living in. He said in the age where Jesus CHRIST HAS BEEN PUT out of his own church and standing at the door knocking trying to get back in and riches and pleasures of the world has drove him from the church until the church becomes lukewarm. It's very pathetic picture of all the other churches in the church ages. I just GOT GOING THROUGH GOT DONE going through them at my church and returning back now beginning the 17th to take them seven seals. AND NOW IN THIS WE find that all the other churches had accepted but the last church age the LEOSAIC CHURCH AGE CHRIST had been taken from the people and they PUT HIM OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH and he was trying to get back in there taken knocking at the door. He said THEY BECOME BLIND. HE SAID IT'S VERY UNUSUAL. HE SAID BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES it's the unusual things in where God appears. God appears in unusual THINGS BECAUSE GOD IS UNUSUAL. He does unusual things. HE APPEARS AT UNUSUAL TIMES. He is seen at unusual TIMES. WHEN TIMES YOU WOULDN'T THINK that you would he would be there, he's there. &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY UNUSUAL. HIS WORKS IS MYSTERIOUS. HE WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. THE BIBLE SAID HIS wonders are to perform. Therefore, that makes him unusual. He said WE GET INTO AN unusual trend of things and we miss God. We get in unusual things and we miss God. HE SAID WHEN WE DO THAT, we might make a a a a big and mighty and terrible mistake. It's when we GET TO THAT SPOT. BUT I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE REAL HONEST WITH YOURSELF IS THAT GOD HAS been working in your life in an unusual way. THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT GOD. IF WE WOULD JUST LOOK BACK THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE, WE WOULD SAY THAT GOD DID THAT AND GOD DID THAT AND GOD DID THAT AND ALL OF IT WAS UNUSUAL. WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT THIS WAY? WHY? BECAUSE GOD is unusual. That word unusual, it means it's something that is not coming or ordinary. IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT TYPICAL. IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EXPECTED. It came in an unexpected WAY. IT DIDN'T COME IN A NORMAL WAY. AND I WOULD SAY, HALLELUJAH, IF WE WOULD LOOK AT GOD, THAT GOD IS UNUSUAL. HIS WORD IS UNUSUAL. HIS PEOPLE are unusual. IF WE WOULD LOOK AT HALF OF THIS CHURCH TONIGHT, &gt;&gt; there's a few names in here. They're unusual people. You know, that way that brother William preaches, it's just unusual. The way Brother Matt McClard, there's a lot we could say about Red Bull. It's just unusual. AND THEN THE WAY BROTHER ANDREW IS, BROTHER RON, BROTHER MATTHEW. THEY'RE [screaming] ALL JUST UNUSUAL. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF. TAKE A LOOK AT SISTER ROXY. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE AND THAT ONE. THEY'RE UNUSUAL. &gt;&gt; WHY IN THE WORLD? WHY? BECAUSE GOD, I know it's a mysterious thing sometimes, but God uses unusual people. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So therefore, when we see the unusual, it's proof that God is real close. &gt;&gt; This is thing I found out about God. He's a great big lot. And I found out about good fishing holes that if you want to fish a good hole and you want to do it at night time, you better have a good light. Because if when you got that light out there across that water, all of a sudden it starts bringing in my bugs. And them old water bugs come flying around that light there and them fish start gathering around them bugs. You watch, there's more nuts in this message. There's some nuts in THIS MESSAGE. BUT DON'T MISS WHERE GOD IS TRULY AT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU with me? I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M SAYING IT, BUT I'M SAYING IT. THERE IS SOME REAL UNUSUAL PEOPLE THAT ATTACH THEM. THERE IS SOME PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE MESSAGE ODDBALL AND THEY TAKE IT LITERAL AND TRY TO BE THE WEIRDEST PERSON IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; God ain't saying that. My God, I better move on or y'all going to cast ME OUT. NOTICE GOD USES unusual things. NOTICE THIS QUEEN OF SHEBA. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HER HEART. WHEN THE HEART GOES TO HUNGERING FOR GOD, GOD AFTER IT GOES HUNGERING FOR GOD, TROUBLES DON'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING. YOU'VE GOT YOUR MINDSET. NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY CALLS YOU, THEY CAN CALL YOU NO MATTER WHAT. HALLELUJAH. No matter what they say or whatever they want to, THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT TO. THEY CAN TRY TO PUT A STUMBLING BLOCK IN YOUR WAY, BUT IF YOU'RE THIRSTING for God, you're going to find it somewhere. He said, "There's nothing GOING TO STOP YOU. YOUR HUSBAND ISN'T GOING TO STOP YOU. YOUR WIFE AIN'T GOING TO STOP YOU. YOUR CHURCH AIN'T GOING TO STOP YOU. YOUR PASTOR ain't going to STOP YOU. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN KEEP AWAY A SAINT from God if he really WANTS TO SEE IT." AND THIS WOMAN HAD DESIRED, EVEN THOUGH SHE NEVER MET SOLOMON, BUT SHE JUST HEARD ABOUT IT. AND SOMETHING GOT TO STIRRING ON THE INSIDE OF [screaming] HER HEART. AND IF YOU GET IN THAT KIND OF A CONDITION, YOU CANNOT STAY AWAY. YOUR PARENTS CAN'T KEEP YOU AWAY. YOUR FAMILY CAN'T KEEP YOU AWAY. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO FIND OUT THAT JESUS IS A REALITY. THERE HAD SOMETHING STRUCK ON THE INSIDE OF THAT LITTLE WOMAN. IT WAS A GENE SEED OF GOD. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS LIVING IN A HEATHEN NATION, &gt;&gt; she still believed. Notice what Paul said in Hebrews 11:31. By faith the harlot, Rahab, perish not with them that believe not when she received the spies with peace. Notice when you look AT RAHAB, SHE WAS IN SHE HAD FAITH IN THE MOST CORRUPT ATMOSPHERE. SHE HAD FAITH IN THE WORST OF ENVIRONMENTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT JERICHO'S ATMOSPHERE, IT IS FULL OF IDOLATRY. THE WALLS AND ECHOES HAD SHOUTED OUT DEFIANCE AGAINST GOD. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SIN. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS FEAR. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS IDOLATRY. BUT THERE WAS ONE WOMAN THAT STILL BELIEVED. IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF ALL THE CHAOS OF A CITY, THERE WAS ONE WOMAN THAT STILL BELIEVED. PAUL SAID IN ROMANS 10:10, "FOR WITH THE HEART MAN BELIEVETH under righteousness, AND WITH THE MOUTH CONFESSION IS MADE UNTO SALVATION. SHE DID NOT KEEP IT TO HERSELF." &gt;&gt; SHE SPOKE WHAT WAS IN HER HEART. &gt;&gt; So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing. How'd he do it? Hearing by the word of God. And here you just begin to look at the drama. She brought these men into her home. Preachers, message preachers packing Joshua's message, packing Joshua's commission. Notice these spies come in there and they start having a little testimony service. It's amazing when you get men of God, people of God on the inside of a house, you're going to find out real quick whether they're believer or not. AND THEY GOT TO TALKING ABOUT WHAT God did down there. And they got to TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT GOD MOVED OVER AAG and over a down there and got to working and moving out and different things and proving. And brother Random SAID THAT WHEN SHE GOT to hearing those things, he said she NEVER SAID, "NOW YOU BRING UP HERE JOSHUA and then I'll see if I believe it." HE SAID SHE BELIEVED IT AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY GOT TO TALKING TO HER. HE SAID THE WORD [screaming] OF THEM SPIES WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THAT LITTLE WOMAN. &gt;&gt; THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAD TRANSPIRED TO HER HEART. Now notice they're having a testimony service. They're talking about what God does, GOD DID, AND WHAT HE'S STILL DOING. AND THEN RAHAB STARTS TESTIFYING IN VERSE 9. She has her little testimony service. Do you want to read it with me tonight? AND SHE SAID UNTO the men, I know THAT THE LORD, CAPITAL L. NOW, WAIT A COT AND PICK A MINUTE. HOW IN THE WORLD DID SHE EVER HEAR THAT NAME? &gt;&gt; WHERE DID SHE GET THE NAME JEHOVAH? WHERE DID SHE HEAR ABOUT IT? WHAT DID SHE STUDY IN HER IDOLATRY TO KNOW THAT NAME? &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HAD TRANSPIRED IN HER HEART. &gt;&gt; The Lord hath given you the land, and your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are faint because of you. And you think you're a nobody &gt;&gt; and you think that you can't conquer your own self. But there little do you know there's an entire city walled up because of you. &gt;&gt; So turn that on the devil. &gt;&gt; You will not tell me that I'm nothing. You will NOT TELL ME THAT I can't conquer. YOU WILL NOT TELL ME THAT I'M NOT ANYTHING. I WAS BORN TO SHUT up the walls of Jericho. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FOR WE HAVE HEARD. IT'S AMAZING HOW THAT IN LEOA THERE'S STILL A PEOPLE HEARING HOW [screaming] THE LORD DRIED UP THE WATER OVER IT SEA FOR YOU WHEN YOU COME OUT OF EGYPT AND WHAT YOU DID UNTO THE TWO kings of the Amorites were on the other side of Jordan, ZION, AND O and where whom ye utterly destroyed. And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt. Neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you. For the Lord your God, HE IS GOD IN HEAVEN ABOVE AND IN EARTH BENEATH. NOW THEREFORE, I PRAY YOU SWEAR UNTO ME BY THE LORD SINCE I HAVE SOLD YOU KINDNESS THAT YOU WILL ALSO SHOW KINDNESS UNTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND GIVE ME A TRUE TOKEN. YOU SEE, SHE CREATED A DIFFERENT atmosphere &gt;&gt; in the same house. &gt;&gt; IN THE SAME HOUSE SHE'D SINNED IN. IN THE SAME HOUSE THAT SHE'D BROUGHT OTHER MEN IN. IN THE SAME HOUSE. IN THE SAME HOUSE. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SHE INVITED AND HEAVENLY ENVIRONMENT, AN ATMOSPHERE ON THE [screaming] INSIDE OF HER HEART. AND MAYBE MAYBE THIS IS JUST ME, BUT I THINK JOSHUA GOT THIS FROM RAHAB. SHE SAID, "AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL SERVE THE LORD." [applause] Rahab was greater. Let me just make it real plain. Rahab was greater than the environment of Jericho. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She was bigger than the atmosphere of sin. SHE WAS BIGGER AND GREATER THAN THE INFLUENCE OF A HARLOT'S LIFE. YOU SEE, THE ENVIRONMENT OF THAT CONDEMNED CITY WAS NOT NO LONGER ON THE INSIDE OF THAT WOMAN. WHEN SHE HEARD THE WORD, THERE WAS SOMETHING PRICRICKED HER HEART AND IT CHANGED HER WHOLE ENTIRE ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? SHE BECAME A PROPHET. HALLELUJAH. She was no longer a product of the environment, but she BECAME A PROPHET AND SHE STARTED TALKING TO THOSE STONES. Everything around me is GOING DOWN, BUT I'M not going down with THEM STONES. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THAT STONES IS CONFESSIONS AND WITH YOUR MOUTH YOU MAKE A CONFESSION UNTO THE LORD. SHE SAID, "I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITH JERICHO. I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITH MY SIN. I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITH MY PAST, BUT I'M RAISING UP. &gt;&gt; You can either change your environment &gt;&gt; or you can become a victim of it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach. YOU ARE EITHER QUALIFIED BY YOUR NEW BIRTH for the environment that you were born TO LIVE IN OR YOU ARE EITHER QUALIFIED TO STAY IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF SIN AND DOUBT. Like Martha, Rahab refused. She refused to let the surroundings DICTATE HER FAITH. SHE WAS NOT GOING TO BE CONTROLLED BY WHAT SHE SEEN, WHAT SHE HEARD, WHAT SHE FELT, WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT HER. CHILDREN, do you hear what I'm saying to you? Do you hear what I'm saying to you? You cannot allow your friends to dictate what you believe. You cannot allow your school friends to make you dictate how you believe this message and how you see this message. You were put HERE TO BE THE MASTER OVER TOP OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT GOD PUT you in. Let me say this TO YOU. YOU CANNOT LOOK LIKE THE WORLD AND influence the world to be a Christian. YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR EYE WINKERS ON. YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR FINGERNAIL POLISH. WELL, BROTHER ANDREW, it's pink and it doesn't show up. Let me say this. IF A PROPHET PREACHED IT, THEN IT'S STILL RIGHT. A PROPHET PREACHED ABOUT OUR WOMEN AND THEIR SISTERS WEARING SLITS IN THEIR SKIRTS UP TO THE GATES OF HELL. IF A PROPHET PREACHED IT, THEN IT'S STILL RIGHT. WELL, JOHNNY DOES IT AND SUSIE DOES IT OUT THERE AND THEY CALL THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS. WE ARE NOT IN THAT KIND OF AN ENVIRONMENT. OUR ENVIRONMENT IS A MESSAGE ENVIRONMENT. SO THEREFORE, OUR PRODUCT. IF WE'RE PRODUCING THE PRODUCT IN THE HOUSE, THEN THE PRODUCT [screaming] OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE THE MESSAGE, TALK LIKE THE MESSAGE, SING LIKE THE MESSAGE, DANCE LIKE THE MESSAGE, BELIEVE LIKE THE MESSAGE. [applause] WELL, IT MIGHT BE OLDFASHIONED, BUT IT'S STILL THE TRUTH. YOU MIGHT GET MAD AT ME, BUT I'D RATHER YOU GET MAD AT ME HERE THAN TO GET MAD AT ME ON JUDGMENT DAY. IF A PROPHET PREACHED IT, THEN I BELIEVE IT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You will never change their environment by trying to look like them. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WAS PUT HERE TO BE THE MASTER OVER LEOSA. LEOSA [screaming] CANNOT CONTROL ME. You see what it is? It's lukewarmness that slips in and tries to creep its way into our children, slip its way into OUR YOUNG GIRLS AND SLIP OUR WAY, SLIP ITS WAY IN RIGHT INTO OUR YOUNG BOYS TO MAKE THEM THINK THAT IT'S OKAY TO LOOK LIKE THE WORLD, DRESS LIKE THE WORLD, ACT LIKE THE WORLD, AND BE A CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; But that ain't my environment. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me say this about this bride. She still believes. &gt;&gt; She believes in old time fashion holiness. &gt;&gt; She believes IN AN OLDFASHIONED POURING OUT OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. YOU CAN SHOUT AND SING WITH ME ALL YOU WANT TO WHEN WE'RE MOVING AND DANCING IN THE SPIRIT, BUT YOU OUGHT TO BE A SHOUT ABOUT THAT [screaming] &gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS YOU ARE WHEN THE SINGING'S GOING FORTH. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S GOT THE SAME POWER, SAME ABILITY FROM THE SAME SOURCE. &gt;&gt; She still believes. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15 and 33, "Be not deceived. Evil communications corrupt good manners. So we become a byproduct of our environment. &gt;&gt; Our environment. Let me deal with this just a minute. The more that we spend time with the world and conversations of the world and conversations that we tolerate and we allow their atmosphere to come into our atmosphere, before long, we're going to start producing that kind of seed. Eventually, it's going to get on the inside of you. You see, I believe that so much. I keep hanging out with Sister Dorothy McClord. me and brother Matt and her wife, we get to hanging out and I'm praying, "Good Lord, how I have a great influence on her." And I switch her from being a vegetarian over to being a real It probably ain't going to work. She's probably going to work her way on my wife and then come over here. But I refuse that. I refuse that. &gt;&gt; Well, what are you saying, Brother Andrew? I'm saying it like this. I had to break your spirit just so that you'd love me again. But it's kind of like putting a new shovel that you got at Lowe's. Real nice blue cobalt shovel. Got a real nice metal edge on it. Man, it's a beautiful thing. But you let it sit out there in the weather too long. You let it sit out there and it gets in the environment of the dew falling every day and the rain falling on it, before long it's going to start to corrode and it'll start taking on the atmosphere. The atmosphere is actually changing the very chemicals and the very status that it was built to be. And the more you hang out the Hallelujah. I ain't talking about vegetarians now. The more you hang out with that kind of people, you will start producing that kind of life. And the more you start hanging around with negativity, I tell you what, I hate negative people. I really do. I I I I'll just be honest. People like that need to be smacked in the mouth. People all the time negative all the I was I was sitting with a pastor one time and this woman, she was just yakking, yacking, yakking, yakking, yacking about everything about life. I mean, she she was from the tribe of yakamal. I tell you what, she was yakking about everything, talking about everything. Most the most negative person. This pastor, I was so proud of him. I tell you what, I couldn't been more proud of my pastor. He stood there and he looked at that man that was her husband. He said, 'I'll tell you what that woman needs. He said, 'What's that?' He said, ' One of these. You know, sometimes you need somebody to shut up the negativity in your life. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, let me give you another one. I had a young man one time before I was saved. Praise God. He come up and knock he kind of kind of knocked me around saying some few things about me. He said, 'The reason why you were born to be a believer is because you was born in the right kind of a family, in the right kind of a home, and you got the right kind of atmosphere around you. I wasn't saved at the time, so I just punched him right in the mouth. And I found out right there, I was kined to Peter Cartwright. And I looked at him, he had it coming. I LOOKED AT HIM, I SAID, AND I'LL tell you what, it wasn't only that, but I I figured he good enough that he was good enough to say it. He was good enough to get this, too. I said, ' Let me tell you this. Just because I was born in the right kind of a family and the right kind of an atmosphere does not make me a believer. What makes me a believer is the new birth. &gt;&gt; It didn't help him. What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm saying it like this. I was born in a message family. Let me say this. I had one of the best environments for the message that could ever be asked for. I was born in a message home. I was born in a family of nine preachers on the Spencer side. I was born Hallelujah. I was born in a great family. And I'll tell you what, I'm thankful. I'm thankful I was born in a Spencer family. I remember my childhood growing up in this message was not sitting around playing video games. I was sitting down on the floor playing with tractors, John Deere tractors, and playing out cowboys and Indians while we was listening to William Brandon preach. But that still didn't make me a believer. And we've got brother David Pierce right here. AND HE WAS NOT BORN IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT. HE DIDN'T KNOW nothing about the message. HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND anything about the message. PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RELIGION at all. He wasn't born in the same kind of environment that I was born in. But look at us now. [applause] You will either be a victim Hallelujah. You will either be a VICTIM TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE IN. SOME PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, I IF I WAS BORN IF I WAS BORN like you, I that's why I knocked that boy in the mouth." He said, "I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth." So, I knocked him right in the mouth. He deserved it. I wasn't born with a SILVER SPOON. I WAS BORN TO BREAK THE ENVIRONMENT THAT I WAS IN. Let me say this. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT STILL LIVE IN THE PAST OF Homer Frasier. &gt;&gt; THEY STILL LIVE IN THE PAST OF DAYS GONE BY. WELL, IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE, JOHNNY, WHEN I WAS SERVING GOD 40 YEARS AGO, THINGS WAS A LOT DIFFERENT NOW. LET ME SAY THIS. YOU CANNOT BE A VICTIM TO 40 YEARS AGO OF JESUS OF 40 YEARS AGO. YOU GOT TO HAVE A FRESH. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'm I feel like preaching tonight. I do. I really do. [applause] I better move on to some quotes or ain't going to think I'm a message preacher. What are you saying? What What am I saying in all that? If you can change your environment, you can change your outcome. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people I could call out their name right now. Some of them I should just to prove a point, but I won't. But there's a lot of people sitting here that were born in the wrong kind of environment. &gt;&gt; To be honest, you didn't have a chance at this message. That's right. &gt;&gt; To be honest, you didn't have a chance to be blessed in the environment that you were in. &gt;&gt; You know, I find it amazing that sometimes, my goodness, I I wish this spirit wouldn't have got on me, but I feel like preaching it tonight. My wife is one of the loveliest preachers wives in this message. I'll just be real honest. I'm so proud of her. She wasn't born in a pastor's family. She wasn't born in a preacher's home. She didn't understand how preachers work, their lives work, that everything that you do and say will be held against you. She didn't understand certain things about the ministry. But to be honest, it was one of the greatest benefits to us is because we begin to look through the lens of somebody that didn't see preachers &gt;&gt; the way that maybe we saw. Some people look at preachers as soon as they get done preaching. They ought to think that a preacher ought to go out there and start shaking everybody's hands. She said, "Now, I never didn't understand that until I became your wife." She said, "Because the anointing comes on you." And she said, "All of a sudden, that weakness." She said, "I never would have understood that unless I was born or I married into your family." And what I'm trying to get to is that my wife, God bless her, she's probably going to hang me up and kill me later, but I'm going to use her. My wife gets to set in some decent spots because she's my wife. We get to go certain places because we're ministry in the ministry. And a lot of people think, man, it's a vacation. &gt;&gt; I sure would love to go where you get to go. Preach where you get to preach. do what you get to do. &gt;&gt; I'd like to give you a glimpse of some of those things sometimes. &gt;&gt; Some of you never seen a man that's so strung out on the Holy Ghost that he don't know which way's up or which way's down. He's crying himself to sleep. But she was born to take care of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let me let me in saying that she get we get to go some decent spots and I I do appreciate that. I do. But I I'm bringing all this around to say this. My wife, let me help me, Lord. My wife has never thought of herself of anything. She has never thought that she was better than anybody. She has never thought that she deserved to sit in certain circles just because she was my wife. She never thought that she deserved to get special treatment because she was my wife. Matter of fact, there's a lot of people that look at the ministry completely wrong. If you'll realize who we are, we are lower than you. &gt;&gt; If you'll really realize that, we are lower than you. I am your servant. To be honest, my wife gets plum upset when people start setting her at a better table because she's my wife. She would rather sit down and I would too. Rather sit out there and fellowship with the brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK WE'RE ANYTHING. WE DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE ANYTHING SPECIAL. ABSOLUTELY NOT. But there are certain people &gt;&gt; just because they're certain preacher, they born into a certain family, married into a certain family, WELL THEY BECOME A PART OF an environment and they think that they deserve special treatment. Let me say this. When preachers and preachers wives start thinking that they deserve special treatment, they have messed up. I understand that a minister is worthy of his reward. And I I believe that you ought to respect the ministry. I really do. I believe that it's something that is a lost art in homes is that people don't teach their children how to respect the ministry anymore. They'll talk that the pastor did this and the pastor did that and before long my ministry can no longer be effective because of what you said in front of your children. &gt;&gt; I said all that to say this. I said all that to say this. You can either break the environment that you were born in or you can become a victim of it. You see, the reason why you could not succeed in the brethren church, in the Methodist church, in the Catholic church, is because that was not your environment. Because you were born to believe the word against all odds. AGAINST ALL ODDS. YOU LOOK AT THE ATMOSPHERE IN BETHANY. IT WAS HOPELESSNESS. IT WAS MOURNFUL. IT WAS unbelief in a home that ONCE HAD JOY, HAD PEACE, HAD HOSPITALITY. BUT LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. FAITH IS SENSITIVE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. FAITH IS SENSITIVE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. GEORGIE CARTER HAD A HOME THAT WAS FULL OF FAITH AT ONE TIME AND SHE GOT INTO A CONDITION BECAUSE SOMEBODY DID HER WRONG. SOMEBODY MESSED UP. &gt;&gt; But she did not become a victim of what happened to her in her life. SHE CHANGED HER ENVIRONMENT BY HER FAITH. YOU SEE, FAITH IS NOT BORN IN COMFORTABLE SITUATIONS. FAITH IS BORN IN THE DARKEST OF CONTRAST. Even Jesus come to a position and waited until the environment had fully exposed man's limitation so that he could show his divine power. And when he got to that spot, he found one heart that still believed. We could look at a little girl, Mary, 16 years old, but she was born to believe. She had heard a word from an angel that she was going to bring forth a child, and she was going to call his name Jesus. and he was going to save his people from her sins. She was 16 years old, but she still believed. My word, the prophet said it like this, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches." How tragic is it that this first age did not listen to the spirit. Instead, it listened to man. But thank God in this last age, there will be a group rise up. The true bride of the last day, she will listen to the spirit in that day of GROSS DARKNESS. THE LIGHT WILL return by the pure word. And we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus. You see, IT WAS JUST MARTHA OUT THERE WHEN SHE HEARD that Jesus was coming. AND SHE WALKS out there in the city of Bethany. And all of them people said, "There she is." That woman that believed that Jesus was a healer. and she walked right past him and she went down there and there's the Sadducees and the Pharisees and they're looking at her and said, "Do you still believe that Jesus is a healer?" But when she came to Jesus, she said, "Even now, Lord, I believe that you're so much God," she still believed IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL. YOU SEE, IT WAS A MARTHA, BUT THERE WAS GOT TO COME A MARY, TOO. THE PROPHET said that the bridegroom CALL WILL COME RIGHT through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together. The church has to BE THE WORD. NOTICE IN JOHN 11, NOBODY ELSE writes this but John under the eagle anointing begins to write this that in verse 28 THAT WHEN SHE HAD SO SAID SHE WENT HER WAY and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth FOR THEE. IF YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THAT'S THE THIRD POLE. IT'S A SECRET WORK THAT NOBODY ELSE IS NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE PROPHET SAID WHEN HE'S PREACHING THE SEVENTH SEAL, he said there's a secret that lays beyond that. What was it? You look in 1956 and brother Random starts talking about the tent vision. He starts talking about the three pools. And he said, notice, he said, NOTICE, HE SAID, I WILL MEET you in there. That will be your third pole. But when he goes up there to Zabina Cannon and there drops a sword in his hands. The word of the Lord spoke to him SAYS, "DON'T FEAR. THAT'S just that's just the vindication of your ministry. It is THE THIRD PULL. WHAT WAS IT? IT'S EXACTLY WHAT DAVID SAID IN PSALMS 27. ONE THING HAVE I DESIRED OF THE LORD THAT WILL I SEEK AFTER, THAT I MAY DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, TO BEHOLD the beauty of the Lord, AND TO INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE. FOR IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE &gt;&gt; HE SHALL HIDE ME IN HIS PAVILION. In the SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME IN THE SECRET OF IT. What is it? Brother Brandham said there's three layers to the third pole to the seventh seal. He said I don't know nothing about it. What is it? It's the day and the hour of the coming of the Lord. It is IN SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE. SHALL HE HIDE ME? SHALL HE SET ME UPON A ROCK? HE HID IT AND REVEALED IT BY HIS SECRET. You remember when the prophet he started talking about Romeo and Juliet? He said now he said notice. He said there she was up there in her quarters. He said and oh Romeo threw his ladder up there. Threw his ladder up there against the wall. And he said, he said, 'It's a secret thing. He said, 'Honey, I'm here, Juliet, I'm here.' He said, notice, he said, when the Lord comes in a twinkling of an eye, it'll be a secret coming. THE REST OF THE WORLD WON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. HE'LL COME AS A THIEF IN A NIGHT. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES. IT'S BEEN A FEW MOMENTS SINCE HE SAID HE WAS COMING, BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES. Do you hear the wagon wheels? &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You know good and well that the rancher son told you he was coming back for you. Are you still believing? And you got the rest of your cousins up there mocking you on the street, mocking you, saying, "What are you doing all that for? Why are you up there WORKING LIKE THAT? WHY are you up there DOING ALL THAT? WHY ARE YOU PREPARING LIKE THAT? BECAUSE a bride do ONLY HIS WILL. SHE HAS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD." OR SHE KEEPS STILL. THAT LITTLE GROUP THEN, THAT TRUE SEAT OF THE WORD OF GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST A BELOVED BRIDE, A VIRGIN, a virgin of his word, the word of his PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT WAS IN MARY, GOD HIMSELF MADE MANIFEST. HE WILL ACT HIMSELF by his own word of promise. He's going to have a people to be honest. Leona has thrown a whole lot at you. &gt;&gt; And you still believe. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that have lost their faith. There's a lot of people that have walked away. They have sealed their doom by not receiving the seal of the Holy Ghost. But you still believe. I know it's not thought of to be a great thing, but you still believe of laying hands on the sick &gt;&gt; and they shall recover. You still believe in casting out demons in the name of Jesus Christ. I know it's a very unusual thing and people get so misunderstood about praise and worship, but you still believe that God deserves all the praise, the honor, and the glory. WHY? BECAUSE YOU are his children and you cannot produce anything EXCEPT FOR WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY DEPOSITED ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU. Now is the time to praise and to worship &gt;&gt; because THE PROPHET SAID AFTER THE SEALS IS OPEN EVERYTHING will be worship b then you say brother Andrew. &gt;&gt; I wasn't born in a church that shouts like you. Get out of that environment. Well, brother Andrew, I don't I don't get it. Why do you dance? Well, if you was in the environment that I was in. &gt;&gt; Well, really, what environment is that? Well, it's a Bible environment. &gt;&gt; We is talking to our girls on the way to church. We don't do anything here unless it's backed up by this Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; We gave a we gave a little prayer cloth to somebody and they didn't receive it too well and I don't know what they'll do with it or whatever. But the reason why we still believe in prayer cloth ministry is because it's in the Bible. The reason why we still preach baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is because it's in the Bible. The reason why we preach serpent seed, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BIBLE. THE REASON WHY WE PREACH IN OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST PENTECOSTAL HOLINESS IS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BIBLE. THE REASON WHY WE SING BEFORE WE PREACH IS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BIBLE. [screaming] THE REASON WE TAKE UP TITHES AND OFFERING IS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; WELL, WE HAVE A RESTORED WORD, SO WE OUGHT TO BELIEVE THIS BIBLE. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. People have criticized you. They have made fun of you. They have lied on you. They have said ungodly things about you. They said, "You're doing the wrong thing. You shouldn't be dressing yourself in the robes of this message." But you're still here. &gt;&gt; You're still dressing yourself in the unfailing body word. You're still doing it because you still believe. You let Satan come in one time and you think that he can't get to you. He got to Eve in a perfect paradise. &gt;&gt; Perfect. No sin, no doubt. And he got to her. What are you just saying, brother Andrew? I'm saying if it wasn't for this word, Satan have done got you. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for the fornication of this Holy Ghost, Satan would have done got you. He got her in a perfect Eden. &gt;&gt; But he will not get you in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WILL NOT GET YOU. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A MESSED UP WORLD. THIS IS SATAN CHEATING. BUT HE WILL NOT GET YOU TO DISBELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. WHY? BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN TO BELIEVE IT. MY IDENTITY IS NOT HOMER FRASER'S IDENTITY. MY IDENTITY IS NOT RON SPENCER'S SON. MY IDENTITY IS THE IDENTITY OF A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; Can you still believe it? Can you really believe it? &gt;&gt; When peer pressure gets on you young boys &gt;&gt; start looking like the world, dressing like the world, listen to music like the world. Can you still believe what this prophet taught? &gt;&gt; I was hoping for one of them shouting meetings. Oh, it'll make you shout. &gt;&gt; It will. I promise you. I promise you it will. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was sure hoping I sure hoping we'd have one of them dancing services. &gt;&gt; Oh, it to make you dance. &gt;&gt; Because when you believe this, &gt;&gt; when you believe this, it'll take this environment and put it in that environment up there. And you think I shout here because of preaching of the word. You wait till I get there. &gt;&gt; You wait till I get there, brother Matt. And all of a sudden, THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT, THE PEOPLE THAT I THOUGHT THAT WOULD NOT BE THERE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT BELIEVE IT, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET IN. LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU. HEAVEN WILL BE FULL OF PEOPLE THAT you do not expect to be there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'll never give up on you. &gt;&gt; IT'LL MAKE ME SHOUT KNOWING THAT A 90YEAR-OLD WOMAN WAS UP THERE BEYOND THE CURTAIN OF TIME AND SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS PAST HER PRIME TO RECEIVE THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. BUT IN A MOMENT, &gt;&gt; SHE STILL BELIEVED. SHE WAS ON THAT SIDE BECAUSE &gt;&gt; SHE believed it. &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. Things get tough sometimes when you're preaching. And I get to thinking, why in the world? The Lord give me this thought in April and it just now let me preach it. And I thought, why now, Lord? Sometimes as a pastor, Brother Jeffrey, you get to looking at things like, why right now? Why does he want me to preach this right now? It's because somebody needs encouragement to still believe it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they need to check up. Sometimes they need to look over, tighten up the armor a little bit. &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you. When I'm sitting in my study and I start and the Lord starts putting them things together, I say, "Oh Lord, it going to hurt. They ain't going to love me." But I'll tell you this, a real [music] seed cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; A real seed will SAY AMEN TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; A REAL SEED WILL SAY THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; I say let us live it. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. It ain't good enough just to read it. &gt;&gt; It ain't good just good enough to have it in our home. Do you still believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. And brother Matthew, [music] want you to sing for us? I believe, oh Lord. I believe all things are possible. Lord, I believe. [music] Only [singing] [music] believe.
