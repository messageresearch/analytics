e e e e [Music] you [Music] h [Music] to say in the adoption series tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when was there ever a time in the history there's the Manifest a time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation while before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all the all the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestations it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestations of sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfect until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it'll John him and his church together what is that Ministry when a little bitty old girl that had alap that the ministry of Tim PR would stand there and say we are here to restore the glory of almighty God back to that little girl it was the manifestation of the king and the Queen coming together what was it when when when when Doug Hill was sitting here and he died in the service much like this all of a sudden the king's Ministry and the Queen's Ministry come together and it was a manifestation what was it when Connie ma was watching a stream and all of a sudden she felt so pulled when a man from Louisiana was preaching a message and she said I got to get in that building was that Aaron oglesby's Ministry or was that the king's Ministry come on somebody hallelujah hallelujah what was it what was it that turned my wife's womb when she couldn't have children but all of a sudden the king's Ministry come in line with the Queen's Ministry and we had a prayer line and during that prayer line sister Katie came in and you will probably meet her during this meeting brother Andrew's wife and she came through the prayer line and uh and they whisk me away and I was in the back and and I was still praying and and it came to me that sister Katie had a problem with her womb and Andrew came and he was attending with brother Michael and they were attending to me and and I told Andrew I said when we come home and the spirit of the Lord comes in a meeting I I'm going to call for Katie cuz now I know what's wrong and so sister Katie it was probably about two months later and I call for Andrew and Katie to come down during the service and I prayed for her and we spoke life to her wom and Miss Reagan is the product of that what was it when Dave Breeden was so wrecked up all of a sudden the king's Ministry and the Queen's Ministry tied together and you saw the physical manifestation of the king hallelujah how about every one of you that was backsliding on God you got Cod on God you done gave up on God but the king's Ministry but the king's Ministry started working through an eve that would not fail that would not give up you are predestinated to live out this hour

fire that was my king who was it that gave me that gave me two little beautiful girls that's my king who was it that gave sister Whitney breeding her complete healing when she couldn't eat nothing she was on the strictest of diets where every time she would eat I'll just be very very plain with you when she would eat she would get sick to her stomach and lose everything she ate but all of a sudden the king came in a tent and he manifested his glory who was it that night and Doug heel got his healing it was not Ron Spencer it was a king who was it that restored you back to your rightful position

briefly and that second verse again I hesitated this because I gave the short testimony the last time I visited brother Reagan's the song had fell on my heart heart I used to sing quite often and Satan kind of jumped on my shoulder and said you can't sing that all your days are filled with Sunshine not a cloud darken your mind the people know you some of them have read your your story and we know you cry but then on my mind on the way to Johnson City that day went to went to the sermons that I'd heard brother Reagan brother Ron that sun Beyond those clouds that predestination has settled in my heart from that airplane ride to so much that's just orchestrated as brother Ron said so I know in the devil's face I can sing that verse I'm a man who can walk again and be proud of who I am for the sins I once held tight I've now let go and all my days are filled with sunshine and not a cloud will ever darken my mind but I tell you now it wasn't always so oh the desperation it brought me back to The Old Rugged Cross when my word had turned so black that I could not [Music] see and like a frightened child lost in the night I search for light oh and in my desperation I said in my

we're a family together we love you with all of our hearts everything that you did for my family we'd like to thank you for what you did I'd like to thank Brother Ray uh for setting the manger scene this year like always and uh him and his his team of guys and we thank you for that uh what they're doing this morning we thank you for that and we certainly are privileged uh a privileged people um amen Amen brother Ben and sister Rebecca amen they here I'm looking I'm looking I'm looking yes there you are amen Still Still the announcement they're moving to Arkansas and uh you'll need a work visa out there it's another country and so amen they're moving to Arkansas with some of their family there and so they've been s so journeying with us for for quite a while and so we're have really enjoyed you being here and uh and so we're just praying that your journey would go well one day we'll all be at the same place we'll be neighbors together and won't be all of this all of this stuff and so we're just we're just thankful for that amen this is my fifth year anniversary uh fighting fighting this disease and so we're grateful to have the fifth year anniversary and so we're thankful for that am there's been some really tough times and been some good times and tough times and good times and tough times and and we're in one of those spots and so if you'll remember us over the next couple of months that that they're doing going to be doing some different kinds of things for us and trying to help us and so if you could just remember some of that so you take chemo and sometimes chemo does more damage than it does good and so we're kind of in that spot now and so so we we would ask you to be praying for us I know you have been for 5 years we would ask you to be praying for us that God would just be with us in a special away amen I'd like to speak to you with this morning Engage The Enemy come on he will flee amen God bless you brother D amen he will flee if you will turn with me to James CH 4: 7 and while you're turning there I just want to make this note this is not a flesh and blood affair right you're not fighting one another amen sometimes the enemy will try to get you to fight one another in your family on your job or in the church try to get you diverted to fight one another that's not what this is about amen come on oh man did you catch that this is not a flesh and blood Affair so I I don't want us to be carnal and think well he's preaching about somebody no no no no no come on this battle is with principality ities and power against spirits in the Realms of the spirits none of us and I I hope I can say this none of us would want our worst enemy if you have one to go to hell and if you do there's an altar I think about the worst en about what hell's about none of us would want our worst enemy to go there that's why we preach that's why we sing that's why we come together is we we want to get closer to God and this is the only place that you can get it done it isn't after you die that you get it fixed this is a spot that we get it fixed remember brother brandom says you go into that realm and You Begin to Fall and he said it's like falling for an eternity then he begins to tell us of how you're naked naked in Hell there's no friends there on it's a constant torment it's a nightmare that never ends amen listen folks I don't want to spend 10 minutes there I I don't I don't want to go there so we come to church and we want to get everything that we can look deep in our hearts make sure that everything in our life is right with God and so as we begin to go into a new year we realize that we're still in a battle and that battle will only get tougher and tougher and tougher the darkness will get darker and darker and darker but ye are the light of the world you are the light of the world Amen James chapter 4 and verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you I want us to read that again submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from next verse let's read it together draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to thee cleanse your hands you sinner purify your hearts ye double-minded may the Lord bless the reading of his word amen you can be seated Matthew 4 and verse 1 and then Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered notice at his weakest moment that the tempter came right and when the tempter came came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God brother brandom said he didn't whip him by his power he whipped him by his word amen now the enemy will come to you you because you're Sons and Daughters of God and he wants your position and he may not he may not come to you quite like he did Jesus but he will say if you are a son of God if you are a daughter of God and then you can't whip him with power but you can whip him with the word the song says Onward Christian soul soldiers marching as to war brother Brandon made an incredible statement that he read off of a a a football stadium one time on the wall and he said it is not the size of the dog that's in the fight it's a size of the fight that's in the dog engage is a is a war term means to be embattled heart pressed fighting emraw equipped for the battle battle ready AR raay in Battle Order prepared for the battle fortified with the armor of God Ephesians chapter 6 in verse 11 says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for you wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of the darkness of the this world and get spiritual wickedness in high places now notice this next verse in verse 13 I want you to read it with me wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand when brother Matthew and I was hunting just a couple of weeks ago in Illinois we were we were going to a to a store we' left the camp and we were going to a store because we couldn't hunt in the mornings and we were going to the store and we went to a just a little BB just a small place there and it was a little sign about like this and it said Peter cartright's grave site I said Matthew Peter cart right's buried here really so we went we followed the sign and we followed another sign and finally it said here's Peter cartright's grave there was a huge graveyard we drove up in and there was the grave site it was a I don't have the picture with me this morning but it was a huge huge uh Memorial to Peter cartright and his wife and for those that knows Peter cartright he was in he's the one that's mentioned in the greatest battle that was ever ever fought brother Rand appropriately mentions him and uh maybe you don't remember the story but brother brandom says that he went into a town and he was going to have a Revival and and the bully of the Town came in and says uh you you can't have a Revival here until you first whip me Peter carite was cleaning windows climbed off off the ladder took his jacket off rolled his sleeves up and he said I'll do that next then right come on and he whipped the man and they had a meeting that night and that night that man got saved and then that man became the pastor of the church Peter clar R was in a meeting and 30 different insurrectionist came into the meeting and and they were going to stir up the meeting just hundreds and hundreds of people were there and they were going to stop the meeting Peter cartright got right down in the middle and he whipped one at a time and he whipped 30 different men that might have been quite a you know unusual Christian service on so they came back to Sunday service and Peter cartright he was there and and so anyway they asked him they said who's going to speak and he said I will well none of us feel speak after a meeting like we just had Wednesday night that was on a Wednesday night and he got up and he preached the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and he preached he preached about a half an hour and when he let out the the worship went all day on Sunday all day on Monday all day on Tuesday and on Wednesday they baptized 300 people that's quite a service isn't it now Peter car a is known to be such a powerful speaker but he is also in politics and this might be something of interest to you but he whipped the greatest president in the United States Abraham Lincoln they ran for congress together and Peter cartright won the race against Abraham Lincoln and then turned around and won it again so he was quite a fight in a whole lot of Realms I'm not going into politics but I think when when I look at him you can tell he I came home and I ordered the book I actually ordered the book before we got out of the graveyard and I would have read more of it but it's got such small writing I've got to take my time to make sure I get it I'm thinking about WR I'm thinking about ordering another one of the bigger letters but God's had fighters in every age brother brandham was quite a fighter right and in his realm he was a in the natural realm he was a boxer and he won 19 I believe professional fights and in that in that realm he was never whipped God Was preparing him for a different realm amen one that you didn't fight naturally against human flesh but you fought against principalities and powers in another dimension right you'll not win that war with your fist you'll not win that war with hateful words you'll win that war by the word of God in John chapter 14 and verse 12 said verely verely I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father notice these next words and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that I will I do and that the father may be glorified in the son notice these words if ye shall ask anything anything in my name I will do it amen Jesus prays this prayer after this manner therefore pray you our fathers Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors I I love this next verse and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever it's it doesn't have a time limit on it forever amen on Hallelujah the scripture says for with God nothing shall be impossible for with God nothing shall be impossible brother R makes this statement I think it's very powerful he says look what that day on Calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow red like Crimson white like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless Lord you are perfectly sinless and as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything that is Forgiven is remitted and forgot about thank thank you Lord amen I'm going to read that again because I think I've got a sleepy crowd come now I'm the one that's been sick all night come on I'm the one that's fought just so I could be in the pull pit and I'll be very honest with you if I could have called in sick today would have been my day are you with me now so I'm going to need a little help now look what that day on Calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be a Scarlet they're white as snowl red like Crimson white like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you done or what you do you're still [Applause] sinless I I told Brother Alden because I had knew this quote was in front of me many of you with a history many of you were with a history wouldn't be accepted in some legalist Church but you happen to God lead you to a church that had a pastor that understood Grace as the preacher said do you know Grace who what Grace Gra the great amazing grace of God a God that can take our history and tear it up and wash it away I want you to think how powerful our God is he created the Sun the moon the stars he created an earth in such a design till every place has a certain Beauty to it the desert the mountains the the caves of the Earth the Seas he created it all with a certain Beauty with so much power he spoke it into existence let there be yet his grace and his blood is so powerful until he cannot remember your sins [Applause] that's powerful what I just said we're not Catholics where we beat oursel over the back over and over and over again right we're not that listen there is therefore now no condemnation Amen to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit forget those things in the past move on [Applause] listen brother brandham would have been a murderer he would have been a murderer as good a shot as William brandham was he would have killed them boys with that rifle he'd have killed every one of them boys with that rifle that's right he would have been a murderer that's right brother brand hated women I'm quoting him hated women because of what he saw happen as his little bo as a little boy watching watching with that whiskey steel that's right he got deep complex but God let him overcome himself where that the message would be so powerful it would raise women to a higher level sisters this message liberated you and if I can say it properly women you are [Music] [Applause] loose God is our refuge and strength a very present help in in trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be moved and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters therefore Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof sayah there is a river in the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God and the Holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and Shall Not Be Moved God shall help her and right early and the Heathen raged and the kings were moved moved and he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us am let me just say you couldn't have anything better than to have God with you you could have the biggest Tabernacle in Virginia and the huge marble pillars and and all this statues that you could have but if God's not there I don't want to be [Applause] there you could have degrees all across your walls of how what all you have accomplished but if God's not there you could be the richest person in the United States of America but if you don't have God if you don't have God you don't have [Music] [Applause] anything I read an article yesterday there's one family in America that by their riches shape our politics and shape our economy one family but if they don't have God right if they don't have God they think they've got power you got no power in this life this life is temporary you're one heart made away from [Music] eternity there was a very large man I was a butcher at one time meat cutter for those that don't understand butcher very large athletic man had his elbows up on the on the meat thing there and you know he thought he had it all wasn't an old man was always kind of a belligerent type of person and The Undertaker the man that owned the the funeral home across the street he walked up beside him and they begin to talk and you know the Undertaker always had a way of doing he turn he turned to look at you kind of look at you up and down it was just his way he would just turn and look at you up and down and he says this guy is standing beside him he said don't look at me you won't be seeing me for a long time the next day the next day that man that said that to him that man was dressing his body you don't have the promise of tomorrow that's right come on don't get yourself in an ever in an attitude to where I've got I've got life made two days before I was diagnosed with cancer two days I danced with sister Connie I twisted her around she don't like to dance but I grab her and dance sometimes she's my dancing partner she going to be that way for eternity get used to it [Applause] I was dancing with her and I said things could not be better two days before cancer diagnosis was was struck two days you know when God spoke to me said if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before nowhere in my mind would I have thought it would be the trial of cancer nowhere nowhere I thought it might be greater gift to be able to help the people but God has used this trial to be an inspiration to many of you sister Teresa sitting in the back she just got diagnosed with cancer Teresa don't fear it don't fear it others that are fighting cancer let me just say this to you take one day at a time understand what is really important in your life what's really get all the fluff and all the stuff and well this one's doing me bad or this one's doing me this listen come on listen 90% of the people that are fighting you are going to hell [Music] anyway are you with me so just ignore the nonsense ignore the noise and March on Hallelujah March while I'm here he's God in your good days he's God in your bad days he's God when you don't feel like worshiping he's God when you're on top of the mountain he's God in the deepest valley that you're there he's God and he'll never give up on you [Applause] brother random said God is God and Satan is Satan and if you don't believe a there's a devil he said when I first got started I I run headlong into him every day don't tell me there's no devil because I know better I have to fight with him every day so I know that there is a devil and you must be trained when you go to meet him not trained in some kind psychology or trained in education or train he but be trained by the Holy Spirit God's power in the word to make it manifest know your enemy oh what a cruel thing he is I get called once a month I wouldn't go in here this morning but seems like I'm here I get called once a month to renew my chemo my chemo is about $30,000 a month now I could do it online but there's about a six day window to where that one medicine is paid for and then the other medicine is not paid for well I did that one time and they sent me a bill for $118,000 listen $188,000 in whatever world is is I I don't have that are you with me that's just a 30-day Supply actually it's a 22 day supply and so and so they call me and they'll ask me every month they've been doing this for about four and a half years and they say we need you to sign up on the online I said no no I did that one time and it cost me $188,000 and I told you I wasn't going to pay for it and they'll go we understand Mr Spencer so they take me through a lot of questions and asking me how I'm doing and all these different kind of things take about takes about 12 minutes so we got done with the call yesterday or Friday and so anyway the lady was really nice and so she said Mr Spencer I need to tell you something I said okay you're the longest living patient on this kind of chemo to God be the glory somebody told me that if you take chemo it's not a miracle so I've just proved that wrong I want you to just think something I'm going to drop some principles here God's word is eternal God's word is eternal it doesn't have an expiration date to it your milk has an expiration date to it just drink it 30 days after that expiration date and it been about 20 minutes you'll know that that milk was no good everybody on the same page with me this word is eternal this word is eternal I don't know if that means just don't let that go over your ears this word is eternal amen and if God said we're healed we're healed now I want you to understand the word of God is a weapon is a weapon in our Arsenal can you imagine going to a a fight and you've got a knife and the other God has got an M16 your chances are not going to be good right I want to remind Satan that's about how we stand he comes to us with his questions and he he comes to us with his ifs he comes to us with his reasoning power he comes to us with all of his doubts and we have an atomic Bond [Applause] I want to say this to you no matter how you feel how you look you win maybe I didn't get it no matter how you look how you feel you win remember brother on my loved one died you're not looking far enough standing beyond the realm of what you can see they're standing in a well body they'll never be sick again they'll never die again there'll never be a rainy day for them it'll never be cold where they're at Hallelujah [Applause] I want you to understand as Sons and Daughters of God you've got more Authority than the angels that are in heaven the devil is more scared of you than you could ever be of him so he tries to make you forget who you are and if he can make you forget who you are you will not use the word on him that will defeat him anywhere any place at any time you have the power to bind the devil you have the power to bind the devil listen the devil is bound when you constantly believe God's word but you also have the power to loose him by doubting did you catch the that you have the power to loose him how many's ever been around a mean dog I'm talking about a mean dog A mean dog now listen I'm not a Gody that believes in chains on a dog but there are some dogs need a chain and then some of them need a real tight chain now if you know where the end of the chain is you can stand there go but if you turn that dog loose come on church if you turn that dog loose you got a problem on your hand listen don't feel sorry for the dog that dog has a reputation the devil has a reputation I want to give credit to Brother Dan daisley Brother Dan daisley stood in this pull pit and used this two times that I know of and he said there was a man that found a rattlesnake and it was cold and that rattlesnake was froze just still wrapped up in a ball head sticking up poor God's creature poor God's creature and he took him in beside the fireplace and that rattlesnake be to warm up and after a while that rattlesnake he went down to pet him again and that rattlesnake bit him and he said Mr rattlesnake I saved your life and I brought you in here where you could warm up and there's no appre appreciation for you and you turn around and bite me let me just say this to you don't give the devil an [Music] inch don't feel sorry for him come on Church don't feel sorry for him he is the devil he knows that he's going to be C into outer Darkness he can read the book just like me and you can read the book but while he has the chance to fight he's going to fight like a winner knowing he's a loser so don't you fight like a loser think Victory talk victory walk victory preach it to Sister Connie preach it never give up whether you know it or not you was not invited to the first service the first Ser service took place in my kitchen when I went in for prayer and we were standing beside the china cabinet that I put way too much money in my fault my bad I did it I did it I like it but it was a place of pull pit for sister Connie this morning she grabbed my head pulled it down on her shoulder prayed for me like there was no tomorrow when she raised me back up she said don't you never give up Hallelujah don't you never give up Peter cartright must had a wife like her so I'm G to say it to you don't you never don't you never give up Mary Sister Mary look over brother Chris tell him don't you say it with Attitude it don't do no good unless you say it with attitude look over at your wife look walk over your neighbor and tell them sister barara look over brother Thomas don't you never give up brother Kenny I know you got one that could say it with [Applause] Attitude thank God for Grace we know that we got counterfeits everywhere that's right it's a battle you got to know your enemy and you got to know your armor your armor is the word your enemy is something that'll reason against it Satan is against the spoken word seed and you have to train for the contest I thought sister Cassie this morning played way way over top of herself I turned I turned a monitor up back there TV monitor up back in the back and I turned it up to where I could hear her real good Matthew came back and I said she's playing Way Beyond what she normally plays but you can't do that unless you practice some people people want to be a Christian on Saturday or Sunday listen you got to be a Christian every day of your life you got to pray you got to read your Bible you got to arm yourself you got to listen to The Prophet to know what this message is all about and your most powerful weapon you take the word of God and you believe the word of God and you place it across your lips now back in the time of Indians they would they would fight and they would take great ropes and they would pull their enemy into the fire and that was a huge event to pull your enemy into the fire and then the one that won became a legend I want to say that we got about 250 Legends sitting in this building and you may never pull the enemy in a fire here but on a Tuesday about 12:00 when the enemy comes to you when you're all by yourself you grab a h of the rope and tell him you showed up you wanted to fight this fight hang on Big Boy your Feet's about to get hot our only defense is the word of God your feelings will not work listen you cannot go by your feelings cuz somebody will hurt your feelings right and you'll take yourself about two weeks to get over it right brother Ron I don't know about that okay in every service there's a blooper you know it you know don't sit there like a bunch of angels every service the preacher Has a Little Blooper isn't it amazing that the enemy will cause you to remember the blooper and there'll be 200 scriptures read 100 quotes will be gone across in 45 minutes but the enemy will cause you to remember the blooper Luke chapter 10 and verse 19 behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over the all the the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you just read it again read it again because you most of us have a 30 second attention span it's why commercials are not two minutes they hit you with a 15-minute commercial and you get and you go to you go immediately to the cabin and get yourself a Hershey candy you was not hungry Pizza you was not hungry and all of a sudden you're calling Pizza in you wern't hungry I want you to read it with me behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you I'm not looking for the best dress church I'm not looking for the richest church I'm looking for the most powerful Church where a teenage girl turns the devil on his head where a little woman is washing dishes and all of the sudden the enemy comes and she turns on the enemy listen you're powerful if you just realize it engage him he come for a fight engage himu by the way this is a Stonewall Jackson for those that are in different parts of the world we are in Stonewall Jack in territory and the Civil War here is still going on he would say don't let the enemy get by with it engage him I think I have three statues of Stonewall Jackson it's all right auction comes up I probably have four Joshua 23 verse 10 one man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you how many's ever heard of shamgar shamgar shamgar was sent 600 Philistine Devils now listen the devil's not real smart so don't give him as much credit as you do he knows the scriptures laying here hundreds of years before it's ever ever used here and and shamgar is a seat of Abraham where God God spoke to Abraham and said thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy and one man shall chase a thousand and the devil only brought 600 go ahead and laugh it'll be all right the devil struggles with meth not meth mouth there's your bloofer a that good that the devil struggles with meth means he don't have no teeth [Applause] yeah baby yeah baby this is only getting better shamgar had been beat brutally for years but today he engaged him and since they didn't bring enough he whipped 600 Philistine Warriors right shamgar didn't have great big muscles he was not 7 foot tall but he had a stick and he had a God all you need is God it doesn't mean you're biceps and how fast you can run as long as you got god brother Dylan my understanding is you were quite a fighter in your time in your time and wasn't scared of anything but you don't need your your strong arms now and you don't need your solid fist you got what you need it's a God and he's not a statue he's not a flag on the wall he's not a picture in your library he's a living God remember our God is still the god of of Elijah he's still the god that has ever was he's the same God he moves in the same Cycles he does the same thing he is the same yesterday today and forever he said have faith in God oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of Jesus Christ not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind who I represent he has to mind who sent me here now watch him as he prays Satan you who bound these people you're exposed ton not your grip is lost you have no no legal Authority at all Jesus Christ robbed you at and stripped you at Calvary
