every way [Music] remains [Music] christ was born and brought us [Music] that jesus christ that [Music] just to testify the lord i know many of us know i spoke with speaking with brother ron and i don't think we can ever brag enough on our lord and he's certainly been good to me and i spoke to you about the job and many of us here know about the situation but maybe there's some over the internet that don't know and maybe this testimony might help somebody believe this morning in the promises of the lord and his word if i can remember because my memory ain't the best but i'm going to try to give god glory for what he's done because the job that i now have is without doubt was the hand of the lord it's better than i even imagined this week all the final tests and everything are over they finally came they certified me as a conductor for the railroad i didn't realize it was all that much to it as it was but a lot of tests a lot of things went on but back in december when they came to me and brother greg and gave us news right there two weeks before christmas they was closing our shop and that december 29th would be our last day of working for the railroad and it was a job that i enjoyed a lot just something i enjoyed doing the type of work and but i knew that god was with me he says he's with me and i knew that if that door closed he had something for me and then not having a job brother ron preaching one night under the anointing spoke and he said they thought that they hurt you by taking your job away but god's going to bless you he said the latter will be better than the beginning and i'm here to tell you tonight that it is more so than i ever imagined [Music] but as time went and i heard about an opening coming up on the cnw that's where i wanted to get and that's where the lord placed me i kept trying to reach out to people and the bosses i went all the way through the command of here local to the ones that do the hiring in mcdonough georgia and atlanta georgia and i talk to people no one knew of this position that i kept asking for for the cnw they're not a union part on the railroad so it's not known about too much and i just kept getting nowhere and i wanted to get back to the railroad i felt guilty in the heart because the god had blessed me i had a good job that he gave me at mckee a job that i spoke to the lord there'd be many men would like to have the job that i had but it just wasn't what i was wanting to do in life kind of difficult when you had a job and it's really what you want to do when you get up and go to work and you're happy that this is what you like doing and then you got a job where it's a good job just not quite what you want to do but i felt bad about that now and i just talked to the lord i said lord i it's not that i'm not grateful i know you gave me this job and how it worked out but i'd just like to get back to where i was and i had a lot of time invested there in that retirement and things and just praying and asking to the lord that he would move for me and that position come up on the cnw but they were hiring in shannon door also and no one knew how to get to the cnw the only thing i could do was apply for the position in shannon door and the downfall of that was if they put me in shannon door it was going to pull me out of church greatly i would miss more than i would be here and the only hope i had of getting over there was by applying for conductor and shining door and hoping that it would move and get me there but i asked the boss who i have now what have i got to do to get over there they should be like winning the lottery to get this spot that you're wanting [Music] so one night there in the prayer line well first we had an interview i applied for that conductor's job i got an interview and i prayed to the lord i said lord if it be your will then let it be for the cnw because if it's not for the cnw lord that job will take me away and i don't want that i didn't want to miss coming here i knew who i was before this and i know you go to miss and it won't be long you'll fall right back to where you was and i thank god for the hunger in my heart because this is where i like being when these doors are open so there was a prayer line one night there after just right directly after that interview and i asked jenny i had to go to work that night on third i said go through that prayer line and ask about that situation and about our son and before i left i said don't mention don't mention the job i said god's well aware of the job now me and her haven't said nothing to no one about this job situation i said if it's important to the lord he's going to lay it on brother ron's heart and we'll know she come through that prayer line for our son and after praying for him she went to walk off from brother ron grabbed her by the shoulder and he said god's got that job situation [Music] i knew then because as i was praying to the lord i said god i know we don't ask for things to for signs and things but it's really important this move could pull me out of church and i just need to know lord is it your will or not and i spoke to the lord about gillian about how he gave him two signs he gave him one sign and that wasn't enough he asked for another i said i'm not asking for two but i'd like to just know lord well there was a sign right there jenny texted me that night at work when i come out on break and i seen it and i was so excited because i was sold i knew then he didn't know that about that job situation so the next day after church i text brother ron i said i want to tell you something about what the lord has done he said call me so when i called him i went to tell him about what the lord done he said wait i want to tell you something [Music] you say anything three weeks before i even had the interview god doesn't give this to brother ron and says shannon's gonna be a conductor on the railroad the statue of a conductor that was three weeks before the railroad even knew they was giving me an interview when we got that me and jenny both agreed we can go ahead and give the notice and we gave my notice and six weeks we went without hearing a thing no one contacted me no job now you know the enemy likes to whisper but his me and brother denny spoke that night when i told him about that statue i went to that i said god you said i'm going to be a conductor and i'm here to tell you this week that i am a conductor [Applause] when they got rid of me there on the railroad i just did reach three weeks vacation they've hired me back in january i got five weeks paid vacation that's what the lord does i won't even get into all the other benefits but i sure love him that's why i'd like to sing how can i keep from singing [Music] there is [Music] and all the storms [Music] how can i keep from [Music] how amazing is your love oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] i will lift my is [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] how can i keep [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am [Music] cause you pick me up [Music] in prayer [Music] angels and the saints around the throne how can i keep your praise how amazing is [Music] i know i am [Music] you know i think on that testimony of a job i know for me i have a son that i'm praying for greatly he needs god as each one of us did but if god would so care about a job something that ain't got no much eternal value but if he would hear us and answer a prayer like that for a job how much more for a lost loved one that we may have maybe someone sick maybe a loved one a brother or sister we're praying for you know if he cared for a job how much more for something eternal for a loved one's soul right let's think on those things as we go to these prayers because he's in the miracle working business that's where he does his best work when the impossible comes [Music] let's pray for brother fred perry sister linda kreger's son he's had some x-rays done and uh waiting to

testimony you'd like to share this morning you know after brother shannon gave that testimony i'm a firm believer in and out of the mouth of two or three witnesses and as we sat down i texted danger and i said if it's okay i'd like to like say a testimony before before he came out and started and i just want to say brother shannon that that was an awesome testimony and at first if there's a true light just look at just take a look at brother shannon and he is a true light to this message and you know i wear this i wear this pen um for many reasons you know brother ron gave it to me and uh you know it's it's very special to me because the night before his brain surgery and i've told this testimony many times i just pray i can get through it so you guys can understand it without me crying but there was a pool in my heart to go and to go and speak with brother ron and i'm saying this testimony again because maybe there's somebody on the fence maybe there's somebody that doesn't certainly understand which way to go and i'm just here to tell you that if you take god at his word he's going to open doors that you don't even know that you can that you can walk through and i went and stood there before brother ron and i i opened my heart to him and i said you know i've i've done things and i've lived a life that i know i shouldn't be living and a lot of you probably gonna ask sarah to come up and get prayer after i get done because you don't know what she got into but she knows and i told him i said you know i'm tired of running from it i'm tired of running i'm ready to come home and you know there's a reason brother ron's going through this going through this trial and i'm a firm believer in that because i'm a testament of that because ever since that time you know but that week and i was i was actually just to go through what i what god's opened the door um since that time you know for a long time it was hard for me to actually give my full testimony and i've only i've only gave a couple of people the testimony because to be honest it's been it's embarrassing to know exactly where i was at and one night after service but the ron came down to me and he said you don't have to worry about the rest of it you're going to be there he said don't worry about the past well i was working the same job making the same money having to pay the same bills but i was living in a place that when i would go to work i would get up and i would be dusting concrete dust off of my pants just to go as my dad put it i was living in a dungeon and many people they may look at me and say you know you're starting to live this way because it's your uncle well believe it or not when he went through the fire he was still my uncle and believe it or not i was still leaving his his services when he would come and preach meetings i was still leaving him early to go do things of the world and go to parties and do things that that i thought was going to make me a popular and make me a better man so to say that you know he's my uncle this is only reason i want to live this life is you know absurd to me but god has used this trial to bring me closer to him as soon as i made that decision i didn't know what to do i didn't know where to go and he told me he said just you know we can get you a job up here you know you work with harrisonburg you can do um what you need to do and i said well let me just try and put a transfer letter in you know they can transfer me up here um and i'll find a place to stay and we'll figure something out and in two weeks they had me transferred up here and they had me transferred up here and in two weeks i had to find a house well the housing market was already getting crazy i couldn't i didn't know what i was going to do about a house and then one day a house opened up and i was moving i was supposed to transfer up here in a week and i called my realtor and i said hey call that house that's a house we're gonna get we're gonna make a show and put an offer on it well we ended up not even being the high the highest bidder and they decided that they wanted to give me the house because they wanted me to come into there well since that time we have sarah came down and that's when we first started talking and she came down and she helped us fix it up and terry came down and helped me fix it up and we got it together well i still wasn't satisfied i told sarah i said we're too far too far out once we get married it's too far of a drive for you or too far from family so we've got to figure something out to get us to get us closer and um he said i'm going to have to transfer because i can't live up as far as grottos i can't do anything like that so i was praying about it praying about it and then back the last week in august policy changed with the state police to where we could live 45 minutes away well grotto's is 40 minutes away so i said well i don't have to transfer or just start looking for somewhere and so i went and i knocked on labor day i decided you know i'm just going to go knock on um a gentleman's door that he he has uh land right there beside uh terry and brenda i said you know if he he tells me to go on and they'll tell me to go on but i'm just going to ask if he wants to sell property i knocked on his door and he sat there he looked down and he said you want to look at survey and i'd already told terry i said i can only take it if he gives me for this certain price and everything was skyrocketing at the time we went in there and he gave he he gave me a price exactly what we were looking for and then in that same that same week me and sarah we started looking at at plans and uh we said you know we'll just see if we got somebody that we can put a house together for a good price when that same week we found a contractor that they were ready to move and they they were ready to go for it so i said well we'll have to find see if we can sell the house well we go to get married and our house sold the day of our wedding and we laughed and we said you know i guess we're coming home homeless and so so uh and all of this has just came together so perfectly and uh so the house sold and everything's lining up and they were fine with us going uh to do that but you know i still wasn't satisfied and it goes back to that job situation you know i wasn't satisfied i was i couldn't be in church every i couldn't be in church every weekend and if you asked me what i was doing in two weeks i couldn't tell you i was probably gonna be at work because it was rotating schedule and then there was one service and you know i just in the middle of service andrew was preaching and i bowed my head and i said lord i don't care what it is i don't care what i'm doing whether it's with the state police whether it's doing whatever it is i want a job to open up that you know i can be in service every weekend because at the end of the day the job i don't care what comes with it it's just going to put food on the table it's going to put a roof over the head i you know main thing is trying to be in church as soon as i finish saying that prayer request or praying right there andrew stepped to the right side of the the pulpit and he looked right at me and pointed at me and said i'm gonna bless you and he i don't even know if he realized what he had done but god had just anointed him and told him that he was gonna bless me well the week before our wedding a job came open as a job that when i took i said i'd never take that job and then i started talking to the guys about it well i went ahead and i put in for that job and well i sit down with the captain of that division this week they gave me the job and he said it's unheard of to get this job at three years on he said it's never been done it's never been done at all and he said you know you don't have to worry about getting a phone call after five o'clock on friday he worked six to two and every answer to that prayer has been answered and here in the next next couple of weeks me and sarah we're going to be able to we're getting out of the house we're we're going to be able to have everything work out just as god has planned it to do and a lot of times you know it you may look at it and say it seems stressful and we're going to have storms we have storms that come across but when we have an acre there's no there's no storm that's going to blow us from our path and we've we've stood there and you know i we we've talked about it's like you know through all the changes all the changes that's going on as it has not been one one ounce of stress on us we're just taking it one step at a time and you know not only that going back to you talking about you praying for your son well when i got baptized i went back there and i said you know there's a still small voice that said malachi is going to be okay but my michael was sitting in it back here and i told i told andrew and i told ron i said there's one guy here that i want to pray for and i wasn't going to tell this testimony until he saw him walk in the doors and god has changed his life but i want to do this for you because i've had that prayer and here a couple weeks ago you know michael he's like i said he's bro he's not going to watch the service he might but but that's just where he's at right now but i know he's coming because i rece i received a word and a couple weeks ago brother andrew he i didn't know what he was doing but he called me up here and he said in in his statement he said what god gives he's not going to take away and he handed me a hundred dollar bill and i tried to give it back to him tried to give it back to him he wouldn't take it well i told sarah i said this hundred dollar bill is never gonna be spent because i'm gonna write that word on it and i'm gonna put it right in the bible right where it lays well that next day that same promise that he gave me the night before he came down and spoke to brother ron and he gave me that promise and he he came down right before everybody was getting baptized and he came down and he said michael and alexis coming hello and you know it's just like that that's an eternal blessing that we could just lift our faith that if there's a loved one out there that we're praying for i know because i'm a testament but we're going to watch my brother come in the doors that you know he's not even living that way right now as we hand it to brother andrew i'm just believing that this morning god can move move on situations that that we don't even know he can move on the doors that will open that we don't even know will open and i just thank you for for giving me this time to have that testimony [Applause] what's your mouth in this morning what's your trial we set those wings on the winds of faith i tell you when we just lay our trust in god because i didn't speak well ago i forgot it was so much but you know when i went for that job i didn't know it was cnw until i got there and they called roll call that morning and they said you're here for the cnw i said yes sir i am. when i knew god if when god then said i was going to have that job and knew he wasn't giving me the one that was going to take me from here and that's what i laid on thank you brother gabriel wonderful let's stand and as we prepare to turn the service over to the word of the lord this morning as the deer [Music] desired [Music] you [Music] strength [Music] you are [Music] two words [Applause] you're my friend and you are my brother [Music] i love you so much [Music] much more [Music] you are my strength [Music] my [Music] are my heart [Music] you my shield and i belong to the world [Music] hallelujah i believe if you can't feel the presence of the lord in this place you're just known god is so good to us [Music] already this morning we there have been great testimonies that if god has decided to bless you he's going to bless you [Music] i'm so thankful that he chose us to be blessed to know that blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord amen we certainly love and appreciate you this morning and and uh so thankful for what the lord is doing amongst

worship and here i am to bow down here i am to say that you're my god [Music] together [Music] maybe as they played that let's just let's just turn to luke chapter two this morning [Music] i know we take time to read over these scriptures at christmas time but laying here is one of the greatest scenes that's ever been seen let's read it together this morning and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made by cerrinius when cyrenius was governor over syria and all went to be taxed every one into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea under the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary is a spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered as she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in that same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you that you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with an angel the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will towards men and it came to pass that as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe line in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the same which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wandered at those things they wondered at those things what a wonderment our jesus christ is they were wandered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all those things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them how many he has a need this morning that you'd like to make known unto the lord amen especially want to be remembering sister janetta's family in prayer this morning let's just go to the author of life father we approach your throne of mercy mercy and grace just before we dive into the word of god this morning lord we invite you to come and take complete preeminence in this service lord as we are nearing into this christmas week father we know that without the first christmas there would be no christmas today and father i know that the current world that we are living in has changed and shook up some things but there's one thing that remains the same in that as you and father i pray that you would bless your children you see their hands you see their needs i ask lord in the name of the lord jesus christ that you'd go by their way as we take the word of life today may you just come and be the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart may you move us out of this out of the way and set us down in a corner as it were begin to speak lift your ear to your children today we love and appreciate you and we bless your holy name amen amen god bless you this morning you may you may be seated also if you could turn with me over into colossians chapter 1 verse 16 this morning i'd like to speak to you on a thought on out of these shall come a ruler out of these shall come a ruler colossians 1 6 tells us that that for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and we we know that as we've just read over this this chapter in the book of luke here and we realize that there are so many prophecies that are packed here in this one segment of scripture that we take time to read of and but we realize that all of the all of these prophecies that are laying there you could go back and you could take you could go back and take each scripture and you could look into the scriptures and you could see how that god at laced throughout the old testament the oncoming messiah that was coming to the generation of 2000 years ago and you could look at it and you could you could maybe look at it and you could see it and maybe it would be like it would be like a it would be like a clock and on the inside of that clock there's all kinds of little mechanisms that are that are working everything but it's all one main source that's making it work or maybe you could maybe you could take a shotgun and you could shoot it at a piece of paper and you could see how that how that it was scattered how that that little those beads would be shot into a different place and you could see how that how that it was scattered but you realize that it came from one source and you look back into the old testament and i absolutely love going through the old testament and finding those old prophecies that are laying there those those hidden gems that are laying there but if you could go back and just in your mind just for a moment and you begin to conceive in your mind about the about the ages of god and how that god rolled down throughout the ages and you can begin to think back as far as humanity and science can begin to think back how far and when the beginning was and you can go back way before you can think of and god was already there and you can hear a prophet when he would say when he said i see him when he rolled those little clinkers off of his hand he he he rolled he spoke it into existence and he rode the stars and the moon and the sun right off and you recognize really quick that you'll see that the author of life was holding all of these promises that are laying there we know that that before it could be a word it had to be a thought and when you're looking at all of those prophecies you're looking and you're seeing that there is an author over top of life and you can see when it begins to speak into existence in the very beginning that god is that you are in the evidence in the beginning so way back before you can ever think of god was already there god is the god of all things and so when we begin to trace back and look and lace back all of the prophecies that are laying there throughout the old testament you can source it back and it come from one source you can look at all those mechanisms in there but they're working for one time for one purpose is to keep that time and we realize that it's the little things that hold the big things together you and i could not be here without him this morning but he is counting on each and every one of you to hold your place to hold your position to stay right in line because every single one of you are in a spot and in a position to bring about a promise in this hour and we realize that it's not man that is doing all of these things when you look back when you look in the old testament and you can see daniel when he would prophesy about the messiah when you could see isaiah it was not man that was doing it but the bible tells us that men of old were moved by the holy ghost when they were inspired so we realized it's not man that is making this work but it's the holy spirit that's working in the great economy of god that's moving all of these small pieces and building a picture and building a drama so so if you could take just one scripture and you could lace it there and you can look back in zechariah you can look about the evening light you can look back in isaiah that that we will be there with our offspring but all of those things are pointing to one thing and that is our messiah and all of these things are lacing together if you look at a puzzle this morning you can look and you've got to make sure everything's lining out but notice the one that's helping you put your life together is the designer of it all notice what the bible says in zechariah 4. that then he answered and spake unto me this this is the word this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting's crying grace grace unto it and moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this house his hands has his hands shall also finish it and they shall they shall know that the lord of hosts capital l o r d the lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those with those seven and the eyes of the lord which run to and fro throughout all the earth so we look and you look in this scripture and you see that the angel that was speaking to zechariah was as much as saying this that what you see means that the church of the living god cannot do anything or accomplish anything by its own might or by its own power but it's got to be done by the holy ghost it's not you and i that are putting this together it's not brother shannon or brother gabriel's testimony that's lacing this that's lacing this ministry this morning but each and every one of them are tying together and somebody will get blessed out of it and somebody will be a touch buy out of it maybe one scripture maybe one life maybe somebody looking at your life walking through walmart they'll watch that testimony that you're living never said a word but almighty god has been working throughout your life because out of you shall come a rule you're not going to make yourself a ruler but out of your very bowels out of your soul it's going to come a rule like you're going to rule over top of laodicea you'll rule over top of cancer you'll rule over top of depression your depression will not rule you death will not rule you but you are placed here in this hour of the laodicean church age not to be a whip and not to be a survivor but to be an overcomer in this hour but out of thee out of thy bellies shall come and live in water and right out of you in this hour god is bringing about a body that will do the same works that jesus did but notice what what was spoken about the city about the city bethlehem the bible also says in in psalms 87 and 3 that glorious things are spoken of the old city of god salah notice in micah 5 and 2 but thou bethlehem ephrata though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of these shall he say he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from old and from everlasting to begin to think and just reflect over this one this one powerful scripture that was laying there in the old testament and you begin to think about the true eternity of god that the eternity of god is boundless it's all existing it it's all at once to the duration it's a duration without beginning and without end and without change and notice when you look at that word translated in in the very latter part of micah 5 and 2 it means that word there from of old and you go to studying out the greek lexicon from old it is also used of the eternity of god in habit chapter 1 and verse 12 that he is the god of before so we realize that the title this is a title that is chosen to express that he is before all things which he had made so we could say that god is the dweller of a for he is the dweller of before time so let me put it into your mind just to just to illuminate your illumination or your imagination this morning that god is so big that that devil can't even touch him that god is so great that humanity can never build anything that can outgrow our god but yet our god is so big but he becomes so humble that he wanted to come into a baby and live and live in a little baby to feel like a little baby to understand like humanity to understand like a mother that maybe have a little child that maybe they have an upset stomach he wants to understand like a child he wants to understand like what it's like to be a two-year-old child and and wise men come from afar and bring him gifts he wants to understand like a 12 year old man that could stand there and make and he could thwart the minds of the theologians of the day he wants to understand what it's like to get a headache he wants to understand so god is so big but yet he can become so small that's what makes him god to me is that he wants to feel like humanity but notice out of these shall come forth to me a ruler in israel notice when joe when judah was setting up that that bethlehem was a part of the thousands of judah notice judo uh bethlehem was so small that they had no political power whatsoever she was so small that she was so insignificant and that it was so small that that not that not anybody was rarely known out of this one city but out of that one city would come a ruler would come a ruler that would rule over top of that generation and the generations before and the generations afterwards so let me put it to you like this out of a 16 year old girl out of a 16 year old girl would come would come and rule or would come the author of almighty life but how is this going to happen the holy spirit will all will overshadow you the holy spirit will overshadow you and the power of the most high will come out of you the heart that thing that will be born of you will be a holy one and he shall save his people from their sins and you think god can't use you you think god doesn't care about you and where you're at and where you're living at it what the obstacles that you're facing about if he can use a 16 year old girl if he can use a girl that that's been made rumors about throughout 2 000 years that she had an affair with a soldier if he can use a 16 year old girl that people made fun of her all of her life they called her all kinds of names they called her son an illegitimate son if he can use a 16 year old girl what can he do with your life are you with me mary is the only one throughout the whole entire bible that could say that she got jesus twice one time in the belly on the other time is on this hole and notice when she got him on the soul where was she at she was in the upper room and if mary had to go to the upper room so do you have to go to the upper room that ruler won't come there unless you invite him to come in there out of this little city well i'm just i'm too insignificant he bypassed all the theologians he bypassed herod's house he bypassed caiaphas house and he came to humble little shepherds that come day come to humble little shepherds that were that were unlearned they were unintelligent didn't know how to write their own name but they come to a little city that was insignificant didn't have didn't have no power to it but out of that little city out of that little city would come forth a child and all of those all of those prophecies and all those wise men knew that there was something that was laying there when herod began to ask where is he going to be born at they told him that there's a prophecy that is laying there in micah chapter 5 and it said out of bethlehem and notice what was laying there that herod was trying to kill every child from two years old and on and younger so he's trying to get to the little child that was so insignificant well i my child my this baby's life is insignificant oh really what if abortion laws were in play right there you see what the enemy was trying to do he was trying to stop the life of almighty god from getting to you he wasn't just trying to stop it 2000 years ago he wasn't just trying to stop a ruler from coming on the scene and living in bethlehem and living in jerusalem and walking on the shores of galilee and healing the left person and healing the blind and healing those that were lost he was coming he was trying to stop the ruler from coming to you and offering you almighty god but out of this city bethlehem which means the house of god's bread it's insignificant oh really who is the one that feeds you daily who is the one that says i am the bread of life but you think well i'm my part or my past is too heavy the things that i've been through through spirituality and through religiousity and throughout my own humanity it's too much let me ask you was it too much for rahab when rahab was the one that founded bethlehem and you think god ain't wanting to set up something on your life but rahab was the one you think about a paradox that rahab truly is that rahab was the one that set up bethlehem and you're a complete paradox that god wants to set up his bethlehem in your life and you you think about the paradox that that's happening there in jericho and here she's got two spies that are hiding in her house hiding underneath the flats hiding from it from the men of jericho and her testimony is we're afraid of you we're afraid of you and you're up there hiding what a paradox what's god doing he's after his seat he's after his lineage because out of rahab she's noted as as one in the lineage of your lord and your savior jesus christ her her story may have been insignificant to the men that she had been with but it was not insignificant to almighty god because he had a plan that out of bethlehem would come a ruler if you stop if you stop rahab you stuck the city if you stop this bride you stop the city from coming to pass if you stop this bride you stop almighty god from setting up a city in john chapter 14 behold i have gone to prepare a mansion for you if you stop ernest meadows if you stop gabriel spencer if you stop the fraser family you are stopping us from our city somebody give the lord a hand clap a priest [Applause] but whoever despised the day of small things notice the world is after great things they're after the greatest present right now russian and busy and about whether what i'm going to get this one or this one bought something for me so now i gotta go now i gotta go get something for them don't make christmas about outdoing somebody else make christmas what christmas truly is but the bible tells us that that that who hath despised the day of small things they're they're looking for the next big revival they're next they're looking for the next billy graham they're looking for the next healing campaign they're looking for great things and christ and christ to come riding on the clouds but they have missed him they have missed him in the coming uh in the return of his people they missed him in a still small voice they missed him in a kentucky preacher they missed him they missed him when he was there as a baby and a manger but shepherds didn't miss him why did he come to shepherds it's because shepherds were willing to go to the message of the angels you see if it had come to herod herod would have never went there if it had come to the theologians he'd never went there but god knows where to send his message to god knows who will receive it god knows what he'll do what did those shepherds do when the angel testified of the things that was happening the bible said they ran down there you ran to jesus that's what happened in your life there's a lot of people that never would have came there was a lot of people that said i'm not going to that pig pen i'm not going down there and ain't nothing but a bunch of moly grubs and there's a lot of people that's a backwash god thought more of you than a backwash of christianity god thought that you were so great that he slipped on the wedding brand of a wedding band of a predestinated grace on your life he thought something of you they missed him in a manger they missed him in a 12 year old boy they missed him in a 30 year old man that said before abraham was i am they missed him when he fed the 5 000. they missed him when he raised the dead they missed him when he was hanging on a cross they missed him in paul they missed him in irenaeus they missed him in luther they missed him in wesley they missed him in william branham they missed him in uni today they're looking for a messiah that would come to their ranks and come to their denominations and they miss the very author of life but god so chose your 16 elements when i hear a man i hear a man by the name of denny vance a lot of people would rode off jesus would you just come to spend the evening with us you think about that's christmas that's christmas every day is when jesus comes and spends your present day with you every one of you should have been rolled off by the ranks of the world nathaniel holmes should have never been sitting in a service like this michael buchanan should have never been sitting in a service like this where you say well brother andrew i'm no different than anybody else sitting here i live a normal life and i i go through life and i i do the same things every day i buy some of the same christmas gifts same stocking stuffers every single year keep the starbucks coming going to work the same way every single day and i buy the same i eat the same breakfast i eat the same oatmeal i see the same people i shake the same hands i i go through the motions every day i i clock in i clock out i get in the car i come home i make i make my husband breakfast i make my husband dinner hallelujah my life is just a normal life if you've got the holy ghost your life ain't normal if you've got the baptism of the spirit your life is not insignificant you're not a nobody you're a somebody if mary was overlooked you'll be overlooked but you're not overlooked by god god has got his eyes on you he's got his eyes on your circumstance he's got his eyes on your problems hallelujah because out of you has got to come something out of you's gotta become a ruler ruling the day and ruling over your problems and ruling over your circumstances i'm nobody moses all he had was a staff david all he had was a sling sampson all he had was a jawbone rory had all she had was a string only jesus jesus only had a whip mary only had some anointment aaron only had a rod dork has only had a needle but every single one of these things they might have been small but god used every single one of them it may have been insignificant to the rest of the world that he came to shepherds but he come to those that would receive a message notice they didn't care where this messiah was laying at he was in their own environment [Music] he was in their own environment you know where you can find them at you know your environment you know what you're comfortable too you're comfortable to this kind of preaching you're comfortable to this message you're comfortable to holiness and a standard of righteousness you're comfortable and he comes in that environment you're not like the rest of the world saying i'm not going down there with him then put your cry babies and get so worked up when the preacher gets to preaching that they got to feel like they got to give their heart all over to god again you don't mind crying because you ain't going to wipe your mascara off when you cry you ain't dressed up like the world you ain't acting like the world [Applause] it comes to your environment it comes where you know the message will be received where to be vindicated notice your life is the interpretation of this message your life is spelling out this message if i never heard another tape if i never if i never read another scripture and all i got to do was watch a little girl carly frazier i could see the message works i could look all over this build and i could look at the harveys i could look at the van says your life is an interpretation of the message and notice what the bible said in ii peter 1 19 that we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the daystar arise in your hearts knowing that the first knowing this verse that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost so it's god that's setting this up so when isaiah was speaking 800 years before mary got there god didn't have to explain it mary was the interpretation of the message and when the bible said that in the last days that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh that your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young your young daughters and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions when it says in isaiah 28 and 18 when it says there that this is the refreshing of the lord that with a stammering lips and unknown tongues well i speak to this people and this is the rest you are the interpretation of the message he interprets it by bringing it to pass now all the prophets had told about it all the prophets were they had told about a star when when when uh balaam would get so anointed and we would come there with this final prophecy that out of jacob a star shall rise and a scepter shall rise out of israel god using a backslidden prophet using this man but those wise men were looking for it this door had passed over every observatory in every planetarium but there was only three that the bible testified that had seen it there's been a lot of things just like down there on the ohio river on the 17th when the 17th person was getting baptized and that star shown over top of that river and said ask john the baptist for run the first coming of christ so with a message of william branham forerunned the second coming of christ and the papers packed that a mysterious star was seen over top and just in this generation alone as the working wonderful power of the messiah been seen what is he doing he's bringing the interpretation of it all because there was people that were looking for there was wise men that were looking for him and wise men are still looking for him today they were looking for the person of the fulfillment now let me let me just say this that that satan knows that you're coming satan knows that there's going to be a people that's without spot without blemish he's looking for her he's looking for her and he's got his eyes on a people that's dressed right talk right living it out and he knows that it's coming to fulfillment that's why you're battling so hard that's why shading is satan is battling this message so hard it's because he knows that he's coming to the final chapters of the book his end isn't near but your future is clear your future's not a dungeon your future's not a seller your future's not hell your future is heaven because you've got a character that's fit to rule that god has so seen you he knows how you'll handle this message he knows what you're going to do with it power with character is fit to roar these wise men when they come to a two-year-old child they've seen the fulfillment of it that this is that which was spoken in numbers chapter 24 and 17 that the stars arise and they found it the shepherds found him when he was just a baby they found jesus's life was the interpretation of all the old testament and that prophecy that was laying there that something had been foretold and you could say that when the shepherds went there and that thing that had been spoken unto mary that this that this will be the things that will happen as it come out of the mouth of the angel gabriel and those shepherds come there and the angels begin to sing at his birth this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears [Music] you think about this little girl having a conversation with an angel that's about six foot tall dark complected she's walking down just going about her business and all of a sudden she sees a little flicker of light and out of that light steps this this being it says fear not mary i am sent from the presence of the most high god [Music] who was that back there in that cave who was that back there meal in me hotel who was that back there who was that that stepped out of that light when it come and said i'm here to tell you of your peculiar birth i'm here to tell you i'm here to tell you about though that the world won't receive it the world may not receive it but you'll take this message you'll take these signs and you'll pray for kings and you'll pray for potentates what was that it was a sign to a generation when this little girl when this little girl takes this takes this information and she ponders it and she she honors it and she holds it in her heart she so honors this thing these things that the angel has spoke to her you know you know what i'm saying when the when the angel is speaking directly to you and he's got your ear he's got your ear he's called your address he's saying where you came from talking about the doctor that's seen you and the week that you went through the angel's got your ear and he's talking to her about everything that she's went through talking to her and you can maybe call her maybe you call her mary maybe you call a rebecca maybe you call her whatever your name is stephanie or whatever but he's got your attention and he starts speaking to you and you've been given a very important message nobody's going to believe anything you say everybody's going to doubt what you have said about the visitation i don't know if i can believe that i don't know if i can go buddy that's out there man that that is you mean to tell me that you believe you're the final voice to the final age man that's out there what about this little girl they've never been anybody on the face of the earth that had a testimony like mary and mary's packing a message on the inside of her said i got to tell somebody about this i got to tell somebody about what the angel has said to me i think i'll go talk to my cousin you know that's just what you do when you have a conversation with almighty god you want to go talk to your cousin maybe your name's gail and you want to tell us something you know jesus is still jesus i know that he's still a miracle worker he's still a promise keeper he's still a cancer defeater i'm packing a message i got something on the inside that's got to come out now it's going to be people doubt you there's going to be people make fun of you elizabeth i had a conversation with an angel and he told me i was going to bring for the child what do you say the child's name is going to be gail his name's jesus and he's a healer of cancer he's a healer of diseases and when jesus the first time it was ever spoken it brought life to a dead baby what about you that are called to be sons and daughters of god when the name of jesus was spoke over top of your life out of these shall come a ruler trinity didn't baptize you trinity didn't make you no ruler trinity actually made you more dead but when you took on the name of jesus christ when a trinitarian he comes with you sometimes sometimes they're just hung up they're just hung up right there they don't understand they don't understand they got questions about the trinity they've been taught that i had a conversation with the trinitarian pastor and he spoke these words to me i thought man i'd never let the cat out of the bag if i believe something like this he said brother andrew he said we don't even know what we believe i thought my jesus how are you teaching people [Music] how you teaching people about eternal life and you don't even know what you're teaching but when jesus stood there in matthew chapter 28 and he said all power in heaven and in earth is given unto me how could it be but jesus was deity himself and that same deity is one to dwell in humanity these he's not in heaven deities in the sons and daughters of god yes he's god on the throne but he's god in your life he's not wanting you to be rude he's not wanting you to be ruled by laodicea he's wanting you to rule they ought to see you out of a little girl named caitlyn out of name of the little girl named emma out of you is gonna come a ruler you're facing things that i as a young person that that maybe i didn't face and we know that each generation gets 10 times harder but out of view out of you that are facing laodicea when the hell is battling up against you over peer pressure and social media agendas over and over and over again somebody's going to overcome that thing somebody's going to be a ruler of that thing it's not going to whip them peer pressure is not going to whip them but they are going to whip peer pressure there's somebody going to be a real testimony that i overcame this thing i believe in our young people i believe in a shout i believe in a dance but i believe it's got to be something on the inside that makes a shout come forth you watch these young people they're a tentative they're they're they're mature in the word of god why is that they've been eating on this all of their life they know that this message this message that's mary is carrying is going to change her body oh i just ain't this ain't just christmas weight baby i'm pregnant i had to stretch that thing out a little bit too something's on the inside he's working on the outside oh it's making a difference in my cholesterol mary's got a testimony i don't know if i can tell it don't you worry it'll testify of itself you just keep believing that thing you just keep holding on to it you keep pondering no things you don't know how it's going to happen you can't explain it don't you worry you ain't got to explain it mary didn't have to explain it the angel came to joseph don't you worry don't you worry he'll make sure that joseph gets visited by a dream don't you worry about your family god is still in the business of delivering a message don't you worry about it you ain't got to testify about it it'll show it'll start to show man what's going on there's a baby on the inside of me what's his name it's jesus man when i got but i got a hold of him and he got a hold of me man i started acting all kinds of crazy how'd you act like man i'll tell you i i don't know i was sitting there one night and all of a sudden man the whole house got to rock it man i thought that i thought the shingle's going to fly off that place and all i could do was sit there and cry all i could what do you mean it was something it was like somebody was standing right there it was like somebody was telling that man what to say to me he was telling that man what what what you mean i'm telling you that my life is the interpretation of this message when joseph when it come time for him when he was born a dreamer when he was born when he was born i promised seed when he was born that way he didn't make himself that way he didn't he didn't make himself have dreams he didn't make himself have visions he was just born that way and he told that they're there that he's seen his brothers and his mother and his father bowing before him and you look at joseph's life his whole life his whole life is laying here as a type of the lord jesus christ cast into a pit raised raised in potiphar's house cast into a dungeon raised ii in command every time that joseph rose through the city they had to bow before him and there is coming a day that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord joseph didn't realize what was happening through why is this happening to me why am i going through all of this despair god put a gift on the inside of you to get you out of your trouble why am i like this why am i being chased from place to place god if you're really for me why am i going here and there and
