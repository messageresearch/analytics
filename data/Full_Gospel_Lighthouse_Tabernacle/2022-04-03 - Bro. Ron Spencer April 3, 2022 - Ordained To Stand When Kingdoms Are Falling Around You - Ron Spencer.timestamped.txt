[20:23] um i actually wasn't going to sing this
[20:25] song today i actually had something else
[20:27] picked out but uh
[20:29] on the way to church we were listening
[20:30] to brother branham and he started
[20:32] singing only believe
[20:34] and
[20:35] elijah asked why did brother branham
[20:38] always sing that song and a lot at
[20:40] william says
[20:41] because the angel the lord loved it so
[20:43] much
[20:44] and just right then just something just
[20:46] dropped in my heart and said sing that
[20:48] for me today
[20:50] and i kind of forgot about it once i got
[20:52] in church but
[20:54] the quote that they played today
[20:57] also amazing enough where
[20:59] brother brown was talking about the
[21:00] pillar of fire and we were talking about
[21:02] the pillar of fire on the way to church
[21:05] but very softly in the background
[21:07] the song only believed was being played
[21:09] in
[21:10] it just dropped in my heart again seeing
[21:12] only believe
[21:14] and
[21:16] i kind of wrestled with it but i just
[21:19] want to go ahead and relieve my heart of
[21:20] this and just sing it and
[21:22] this is not only brother branham's theme
[21:25] song but i believe that as message
[21:27] believers it is our theme song so just
[21:31] sing it with me as believers
[21:36] [Music]
[21:46] all
[21:48] things are
[21:50] possible
[21:53] only
[21:57] [Music]

[39:37] daniel being a prophet of god could read
[39:40] the
[39:41] the
[39:43] unwritten or
[39:46] undescribed word that was there
[39:50] and nobody else could read it
[39:53] i'd like to say that we had a prophet in
[39:55] this day
[39:58] that could take the book that nobody
[40:00] else could read
[40:02] and was allowed to open the book
[40:05] that you and i can see what god is doing
[40:08] in this day
[40:09] amen
[40:11] daniel chapter 5 and verse 1 and
[40:13] belshazzar the king made a great feast
[40:17] to a thousand of his lords and drank
[40:19] wine before the thousand
[40:22] and belshazzar wiles he tasted the wine
[40:26] commanded to bring golden and silver
[40:30] vessels
[40:32] which his father nebuchadnezzar had
[40:34] taken
[40:35] out of the temple
[40:37] which was in jerusalem
[40:40] that the king and his princes his wives
[40:42] and his concubines
[40:44] made drink therein
[40:47] then they brought the golden vessels
[40:49] that were taken out of the temple
[40:51] of the house of god which was at
[40:54] jerusalem
[40:55] and the king and his princes and his
[40:57] wives and his concubines
[41:00] drank in them
[41:01] they drank wine
[41:03] and praised the gods of gold and of
[41:06] silver of brass of iron and wood and of
[41:10] stone
[41:13] in the same hour
[41:16] came forth fingers of a man's hand
[41:20] and rode over against the candlestick
[41:24] upon the plaster of the wall in the
[41:27] king's palace
[41:29] and the king saw the part of the of the
[41:32] hand that wrote
[41:34] and then the king's countenance was
[41:37] changed and his thoughts troubled him so
[41:39] that the joints of the loins were loosed
[41:43] and his knees
[41:46] his knees smote one against another and
[41:49] the cream
[41:50] king crowd allowed to bring the
[41:52] astrologers
[41:54] notice who he calls
[41:56] he calls astrologers
[41:58] chaldeans
[42:00] soothsayers
[42:04] tell me my future here what is this
[42:06] saying about me
[42:09] and the king spake and said to the wise
[42:11] men of babylon whosoever shall read this
[42:14] writing
[42:15] show the interpretation thereof shall be
[42:18] clothed in scarlet and have a chain of
[42:20] gold about his neck
[42:22] and shalt be the third ruler in the
[42:25] kingdom
[42:27] and then came in all the king's wise men
[42:30] that but they could not read the writing
[42:33] nor make known to the king the
[42:35] interpretation thereof
[42:38] then was king belshazzar
[42:41] greatly troubled
[42:43] and his countenance was changed in him
[42:46] and his lords were astonished
[42:49] now the queen
[42:52] by the reason of the words of the king
[42:54] and his lords came into the banquet
[42:57] house
[42:59] and the queen spake and said o king live
[43:02] forever
[43:05] let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor
[43:08] let thy countenance be changed
[43:11] there is a man in thy kingdom
[43:14] i love this
[43:16] in whom the spirit of the holy gods
[43:19] and in the days of thy father light and
[43:23] understanding and wisdom
[43:25] like the wisdom of the gods
[43:28] was found in him
[43:29] whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father
[43:34] the king say i say thy father made
[43:37] master of the magicians astrologers
[43:40] child deans and soothsayers
[43:43] for as much as an excellent spirit and
[43:46] knowledge and understanding and
[43:48] interpreting of dreams
[43:50] showing a hard sentence dissolving of
[43:53] doubts
[43:54] were found
[43:56] in the same
[43:57] daniel
[44:00] whom the king named belteshazar
[44:04] now let daniel be called
[44:07] and he will show
[44:09] the interpretation
[44:11] hallelujah let the prophet be called
[44:15] he's got the answer for the trouble of
[44:17] this day
[44:19] let's talk to the lord just now lord
[44:21] jesus we love you with all of our hearts
[44:24] so we heard this song just moments ago
[44:27] saying
[44:28] only believe and it was a song that was
[44:32] very much loved by the angel of the lord
[44:35] we believe that same angel is here even
[44:37] now
[44:38] we ask you that you would anoint our
[44:40] hearts and anoint us for
[44:42] for the service of the kingdom today
[44:45] anoint not just speakers singers but
[44:47] anoint this entire audience those that
[44:50] are watching by way of internet father i
[44:52] pray that you'd send your word may the
[44:54] atmosphere of the presence of god
[44:58] touch their lives
[44:59] now we have many needs amongst this
[45:01] audience and we believe that you're the
[45:04] healer of all of them father
[45:06] maybe even our needs i've heard the
[45:08] prophet say this morning it's a hard
[45:10] thing for pentecostals to say but the
[45:13] word backslidden he said in backslidden
[45:16] condition lord if we're backslidden in
[45:18] our spirit father i pray for rekindling
[45:21] of the fire of god
[45:23] touch our hearts today father minister
[45:26] to us
[45:27] you know every need in our lives in
[45:29] jesus christ's name we surrender
[45:32] ourselves to you
[45:34] in jesus christ's name you may be seated
[45:36] this morning
[45:42] quite a kingdom that babylon was
[45:46] as a matter of fact it was the most
[45:48] powerful kingdom in the whole world at
[45:50] that time
[45:52] they built such a city until the prophet
[45:55] would say that they would write they
[45:57] could ride
[45:58] chariot races around the walls
[46:02] it was a
[46:03] it was a a city to which that even the
[46:06] walls they had would have great hanging
[46:08] gardens they called it the second garden
[46:11] of eden in some places
[46:13] of its beauty of its glory of its power
[46:16] of its riches
[46:17] that was there
[46:20] jeremiah had prophesied
[46:23] and remember this god sends warnings and
[46:26] then
[46:27] then there comes judgment
[46:29] jeremiah had prophesied that israel
[46:32] would come into captivity
[46:34] whenever a prophet speaks it may it may
[46:37] be quite a long time before it actually
[46:39] comes to pass
[46:41] maybe nobody hardly listened to jeremiah
[46:44] a weeping prophet
[46:46] but this prophet had prophesied that
[46:48] you're going to go into captivity
[46:51] and in this captivity they they came and
[46:53] they took all the gold and the vessels
[46:55] of the of the tabernacle the riches
[46:58] of of jerusalem they took they took
[47:01] within them with some teenagers that you
[47:04] and i would recognize one was named
[47:07] daniel one was their other three was
[47:09] shadrach
[47:11] meshach and abednego
[47:14] brother adam would tell us a story when
[47:15] he's preaching and handwriting on the
[47:17] wall he said though
[47:20] they be a foreigner in another country
[47:24] and be under captive condition
[47:27] they would be like the slave that came
[47:29] to was brought to america
[47:32] and the broker wanted to buy that slave
[47:34] and he constantly he constantly wanted
[47:37] to buy that certain one
[47:39] and that certain one that conducted
[47:41] himself different that he that he that
[47:44] he did better he worked harder and so he
[47:47] said i want to buy that one he said well
[47:49] he's not for sale
[47:51] he's not for sale well why do you treat
[47:53] him different do you treat him do you
[47:55] feed him better do you do anything
[47:57] different he said well for a long time i
[47:59] wondered about him what was different
[48:01] about him he said but when i discovered
[48:04] that he's a king's son
[48:07] back in his home country
[48:10] and though he be in a foreign country
[48:14] he still conducts himself as a king son
[48:22] and so daniel was a prophet of god your
[48:25] prophet born from birth
[48:28] being a prophet of god with a gift in
[48:30] his life
[48:31] to be able to interpret dreams to be
[48:33] able to read the word of god to also
[48:36] write the daniel parallels the book of
[48:39] of revelations which also parallels your
[48:42] newspaper today
[48:46] so daniel would
[48:48] would be in this in this country
[48:51] and if you remember
[48:53] uh as as as it would be
[48:56] when they first arrived there and then
[48:59] there came trouble in the in the country
[49:03] there there there came a situation to
[49:06] where that the king would would use him
[49:08] to
[49:09] understand a dream
[49:11] and then and then daniel would be lifted
[49:14] to a place as a prophet because gentiles
[49:17] like to worship humanity
[49:20] and they lifted they lifted daniel to a
[49:23] spot to where they wanted to make him a
[49:25] god
[49:27] though he was a prophet he was not a god
[49:30] but god did dwell inside of him
[49:34] and so they built up they built a statue
[49:37] to to daniel and and he would have a lot
[49:39] of parallels inside of it but and in all
[49:42] of that shadrach meshach and abednego
[49:46] to them
[49:47] he was just
[49:49] he was just their brother
[49:52] they had great respect for him but he
[49:55] was their brother
[49:57] he was not god he was their brother
[50:00] and they refused to bend or bow
[50:04] and upon their not refusing to bend
[50:06] their bow they they went to a fiery
[50:09] furnace and
[50:10] and we know the end of that story
[50:13] now decades would pass
[50:15] that king would get high and lifted up
[50:18] in his spirit
[50:20] into which even though that daniel would
[50:23] be the man that would be a man that
[50:25] would
[50:26] that would contribute much knowledge to
[50:29] him
[50:30] yet he wouldn't serve the god of daniel
[50:34] and he was lifted in his spirit there's
[50:36] where men get in trouble
[50:38] is when you get lifted in your own
[50:40] spirit
[50:42] and you become more important
[50:47] and you begin to draw them into yourself
[50:50] let me just say as ministers our
[50:52] responsibility is for to draw people to
[50:56] jesus christ
[51:00] that's our total responsibility it's to
[51:03] draw people to jesus christ no matter
[51:06] how greatly gifted we are
[51:09] no matter how great that we can speak
[51:15] are you with me now
[51:16] we tend as human beings to like this or
[51:19] like that kind of like strawberry ice
[51:21] cream or chocolate ice cream or vanilla
[51:23] ice cream and i don't mean to put that
[51:25] with preaching but we have likenesses of
[51:28] who we like who we don't like who we
[51:30] couldn't care lest ever hear again
[51:32] we're human
[51:34] don't get don't get all
[51:36] sanctimonious on me right quick here
[51:39] we're human beings i have my likes i
[51:41] have my ducalots
[51:45] i'm on i'm just honest here
[51:48] i'm just real honest
[51:54] now daniel would be forgotten
[51:59] he would be forgotten in the kingdom he
[52:01] was still captive
[52:02] god was still working with him
[52:05] but he'd be forgotten in a kingdom
[52:08] how quickly a nation can forget god
[52:11] [Music]
[52:14] how quickly a nation can forget god
[52:17] brother branham was standing preaching
[52:18] handwriting on the wall over and over
[52:21] again brother branham preached it other
[52:23] great evangelists preached hand
[52:25] handwriting on the wall
[52:27] and he comes to america
[52:31] it comes to an a america we forgot god
[52:36] let's just say we're not a christian
[52:37] nation anymore
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] we're not a christian nation anymore
[52:44] you know if you're you've got the idea
[52:46] that we are a christian nation you have
[52:48] forgot
[52:50] or you're not paying attention
[52:53] we took god out of our school
[52:55] we took him out of our governments
[53:00] we've we've taken him out of our voting
[53:02] booths
[53:07] when a puritan college
[53:10] can be polled on whether they're
[53:11] christian or not
[53:13] 70 were socialists
[53:16] 30
[53:17] were were communists
[53:22] not one christian
[53:29] and it's the highest level college for
[53:31] lawyers that there can be
[53:33] and it's a puritan college
[53:36] look how far you can fall
[53:40] look how far you can fall
[53:43] we're a great nation
[53:46] we have been the policemen of the world
[53:49] but we're a weak nation now
[53:54] brother branham would use a couple of
[53:55] illustrations and i i just want to say
[53:58] some things and to get it started
[54:01] brethren it's later than you think
[54:04] sodom and gomorrah little knew that that
[54:06] night that they were living their last
[54:08] hour
[54:10] little did egypt know that death the
[54:12] death angel had predicted to come would
[54:15] come that night
[54:18] little did pearl harbor realize that the
[54:21] raid was that took place
[54:24] we are weighed in the balances and found
[54:26] wanting
[54:28] we are near the end time i could say
[54:31] this to you if he could say that in 1958
[54:34] we are at the end of the end of the end
[54:37] [Music]
[54:41] watch what he says he says satan your
[54:43] days are numbered
[54:45] your kingdom
[54:47] has been numbered
[54:49] your weight in the balance isn't found
[54:52] warning
[54:53] brother animals took it to a higher
[54:55] level
[54:56] than america or russia or rome or any
[55:00] country
[55:01] he's telling satan himself
[55:04] who rules kingdoms
[55:06] your kingdom is your days are numbered
[55:10] only a prophet could stand there with
[55:13] the authority of the word and tell satan
[55:16] himself your days
[55:19] [Music]
[55:27] separate place he says
[55:29] he said he does it out in the military
[55:31] life
[55:32] he said i was reading an article
[55:34] sometime ago on the sudden attack of
[55:36] pearl harbor
[55:38] that wasn't exactly an
[55:40] unknown attack
[55:44] that wasn't ex he said they had already
[55:47] been warned
[55:49] that the jacks were going to come
[55:52] to do that but the sad part was
[55:56] they ignored the warning
[55:59] i don't want these quotes to just go
[56:00] over your head but a lot of people sit
[56:03] in church because of a seared conscience
[56:06] and they get by with sin for years and
[56:09] years and years and just cross their
[56:11] arms and say preacher you don't have any
[56:13] effect on me understand i'm only
[56:16] the messenger
[56:25] and you can ignore the warning for
[56:27] decades
[56:29] but understand this as a nation as a
[56:32] people your sins will find you out
[56:35] god sees everything
[56:47] they had seen signs
[56:49] the japanese army had assembled
[56:51] themselves together
[56:53] the big ships had been loaded with
[56:55] ammunition the threat was in the air
[56:58] and they were just exactly in the line
[57:01] of the for invasion but they ignored it
[57:04] that's the way it is today with the
[57:06] church the church is in the line for
[57:07] judgment but they're ignoring the coming
[57:10] of the lord
[57:12] you can't blame god
[57:15] they said where were noised about about
[57:17] pearl harbor the japs could attack at
[57:19] any time their big fleet was set out in
[57:22] the waters and the sea
[57:23] moving slowly but steadily towards pearl
[57:26] harbor
[57:27] and they laughed at it
[57:29] on nonsense gloom builders you bunch of
[57:32] worrywarts
[57:34] all you think about is some trouble
[57:38] and on the night just before the great
[57:41] attack the next morning
[57:43] there was a great dance
[57:46] a big party given in pearl harbor itself
[57:50] and no matter how much they tried to say
[57:53] that the japs were coming
[57:56] because men sounded the alarm
[58:01] men echoed the alarm all over the
[58:03] country and said they're coming they're
[58:05] invading they're here but because of
[58:08] their drunken revelry
[58:12] they didn't realize that masses of them
[58:15] would be murdered
[58:17] it don't matter if you're the strongest
[58:19] army in the world
[58:21] when you ignore the warnings
[58:26] i say this to you you can set in the
[58:28] strongest church in the message
[58:31] under the most powerful ministers that
[58:34] there are
[58:44] and ignore the warning
[58:47] i don't want to there's a statement that
[58:49] you need to have in your ears
[58:51] left behind
[59:02] the bombs won't always stay in ukraine
[59:11] it's hard for us as human beings can
[59:13] have to have empathy
[59:18] we haven't tasted of it
[59:20] on our own ground
[59:26] we suffered through a civil war
[59:29] 150 years ago
[59:33] on these grounds
[59:35] we fought
[59:36] for our land
[59:38] whether it was a good cause or a bad
[59:39] cause we thought brothers were separated
[59:44] we talk about war sometimes it's become
[59:46] spiritual
[59:51] brother brahman says the titanic he said
[59:53] presbyter tyrion's in the same way
[59:55] nazarene's peel pentecostal pilgrim
[59:58] holis all of them
[59:59] some man-made achievements
[1:00:02] but it's just as sure
[1:00:05] as nimrod's tower
[1:00:08] did
[1:00:09] and nebuchadnezzar city did
[1:00:12] like america's titanic went down
[1:00:16] so will they go down
[1:00:19] every man made achievement
[1:00:24] they'll go down
[1:00:27] where is the titanic today
[1:00:30] in the bottom of the sea
[1:00:32] where is nimrod's tower
[1:00:35] she's fallen to the earth where is
[1:00:38] nebuchadnezzar's immortal city
[1:00:42] it sunk
[1:00:43] where is france's sigrid line
[1:00:47] she's blown to pieces where is germany's
[1:00:49] maganat line just busted to pieces where
[1:00:53] is the denominational church
[1:00:58] dead
[1:01:05] what is it all
[1:01:07] all of it is a historical memory
[1:01:11] that's all that's left of sigfrid line
[1:01:15] is history
[1:01:16] all of left of the maganat line is left
[1:01:19] is history
[1:01:20] all that's left of the towers
[1:01:23] the of the towers is history
[1:01:26] and all the church has got today is
[1:01:29] history
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:32] moody sankey feeney
[1:01:36] smith it's all history
[1:01:40] but god still lives today
[1:01:43] he is the same and he always will live
[1:01:48] when ichabod has been written over the
[1:01:50] door
[1:01:52] ichabod says the spirit of the lord has
[1:01:54] departed there's a reason why god
[1:01:56] departs when you won't keep his word
[1:02:01] you challenge him to a spot to where he
[1:02:04] has to leave
[1:02:05] because he can't stay in a contaminated
[1:02:08] church
[1:02:09] neither can he stay in a contaminated
[1:02:11] vessel
[1:02:13] you can't be a christian on sunday and
[1:02:15] on monday be a complete different
[1:02:17] individual
[1:02:19] [Applause]
[1:02:30] revelations 3 and verse 17 because thou
[1:02:33] sayest i am enrich and increase with
[1:02:34] goods and have need of nothing
[1:02:37] and know us not that thou art wretched
[1:02:39] and miserable and poor and blind
[1:02:42] and naked
[1:02:44] so we have a church world
[1:02:46] that don't need god
[1:02:48] we don't have a service here that we
[1:02:50] don't need god
[1:02:56] i want to declare to you we don't need a
[1:02:58] program
[1:03:01] i don't want to substitute nothing for
[1:03:03] true worship
[1:03:13] and let me just say it's more than about
[1:03:15] a building or a nation it's about you
[1:03:19] don't let the walls of your heart
[1:03:21] where god has to come and tell you
[1:03:24] i'm done with you
[1:03:26] because there is a line of judgment
[1:03:29] there's a line of demarcation there's no
[1:03:31] return
[1:03:33] and then there's not a preacher in the
[1:03:35] world with the most powerful sermon that
[1:03:37] can touch your heart because it's been
[1:03:39] crushed over by sin
[1:03:42] and doubt
[1:03:47] i wonder how this message would be
[1:03:49] received
[1:03:50] at the church that you're now giving
[1:03:52] grace to
[1:03:54] they're okay
[1:03:55] but they're okay brother ron
[1:03:58] maybe those that are listening to me
[1:04:00] today by the way of internet
[1:04:03] and you're tied into a denominational
[1:04:05] system
[1:04:06] ask yourself and be really honest with
[1:04:09] yourself
[1:04:10] would my church
[1:04:12] be comfortable with brother branham's
[1:04:15] message in it
[1:04:20] maybe would it be comfortable with
[1:04:22] having brother ron as kind and sweet of
[1:04:24] man as he is
[1:04:27] and he seems to be politically correct
[1:04:29] in a lot of things
[1:04:34] do you really believe that they would
[1:04:36] want me to be their convention speaker
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:42] so they get men that are politically
[1:04:45] correct
[1:04:47] where their church is constantly
[1:04:49] changing going toward the world
[1:04:52] there's no going back
[1:04:54] why if someone be in the church that's
[1:04:56] trying to get the church back to the
[1:04:58] original revival they're called a
[1:05:00] fanatic
[1:05:02] [Applause]
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:05] [Applause]
[1:05:12] daniel is 68 years old when he's called
[1:05:14] to this event this evening
[1:05:19] he's a man that's a seasoned prophet
[1:05:23] he walks in you notice he's not at the
[1:05:25] party
[1:05:30] you can live in a world but you don't
[1:05:32] have to be a part of it
[1:05:44] notice even even belshazzar's mother
[1:05:48] wasn't at the party
[1:05:50] because she remembered daniel
[1:05:54] and she knew that her husband got lifted
[1:05:57] in his spirit
[1:05:59] and god allowed him to lose his mind to
[1:06:01] where that he was eating grass with the
[1:06:04] cattle
[1:06:06] and the dew was falling on his back
[1:06:09] don't tell me you can lift yourself so
[1:06:11] high
[1:06:14] if this could be preached into the into
[1:06:16] the the
[1:06:18] the circles of washington today
[1:06:21] you forgot god
[1:06:24] you're on the borderline of insanity
[1:06:27] and god's going to judge you
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:40] daniel refused to defile himself
[1:06:44] you know there sometimes has to come a
[1:06:46] line where you as an individual have to
[1:06:48] decide
[1:06:50] it's god first
[1:06:53] and god blessed him regardless of his
[1:06:55] captive situation
[1:06:58] notice
[1:06:59] daniel
[1:07:00] was the prime minister
[1:07:04] of the country
[1:07:06] but they forgot who he was
[1:07:11] he comes in
[1:07:17] i'm going to preach to you this morning
[1:07:18] center
[1:07:21] i got a visitation so i'm going to
[1:07:23] preach directly to you
[1:07:25] god does not destroy him that king
[1:07:29] because
[1:07:31] of his drunkenness
[1:07:35] he does not destroy him because of his
[1:07:38] pornography
[1:07:41] he does not destroy him because of all
[1:07:43] of his concubines
[1:07:46] he destroys him because he goes and gets
[1:07:49] the vessels of honor
[1:07:52] the things that were dedicated to god
[1:07:56] the the things that were set aside that
[1:07:59] had been there for decades
[1:08:02] gold and silver vessels
[1:08:05] that were for communion that were for
[1:08:07] worship that were for dedicated to
[1:08:10] worship god
[1:08:12] the day that you take god's word and
[1:08:14] make fun of it
[1:08:18] the day that you laugh at god's prophet
[1:08:22] the day that you call it from the devil
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:28] and they poured their wine in it they
[1:08:30] began to drink and they got drunk
[1:08:35] the who's who of the kingdom was there
[1:08:38] it was a massive country
[1:08:42] massive
[1:08:43] had incredible leaders there
[1:08:52] they didn't know today we're going to
[1:08:53] die
[1:08:57] they didn't know today they were going
[1:08:58] to die
[1:09:02] fighting what i fight there's a word
[1:09:04] that's called bucket list get this done
[1:09:06] before you die
[1:09:08] get this done before you die
[1:09:12] well i'd have did a few things that i
[1:09:14] enjoyed one was hunting with you
[1:09:18] i spent every quality time that i can
[1:09:20] with my wife
[1:09:23] but i'm not worried about dying
[1:09:25] because the day that i do will be my
[1:09:27] first day there
[1:09:37] i'm the kind of a preacher that's a kind
[1:09:38] of a guy that
[1:09:40] money won't buy me
[1:09:42] popularity won't buy me
[1:09:44] because it'll do you no good in a casket
[1:09:51] the most dangerous preacher to the devil
[1:09:53] is a guy that you can't buy with money
[1:09:56] and you can't buy them with popularity
[1:10:00] and you can't buy them with women
[1:10:05] when that guy will only preach what god
[1:10:07] tells him to preach
[1:10:09] that's a dangerous preacher to the
[1:10:10] devil's kingdom
[1:10:24] he walks in and assesses the situation
[1:10:30] i want you to just notice he doesn't
[1:10:32] worry about himself
[1:10:34] when he preaches the sermon
[1:10:40] you see daniel recognized that those
[1:10:42] words came from his father
[1:10:50] because he was in touch with his father
[1:10:53] and though he lived in that kingdom
[1:10:57] those
[1:10:59] undecipherable words
[1:11:02] were very recognizable to a believer
[1:11:06] it may not matter to the rest of your
[1:11:08] family but because of who you are
[1:11:11] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[1:11:13] christ is a must
[1:11:16] knowing who god is is a must
[1:11:19] having a sanctified holy life in this
[1:11:23] hour is a must
[1:11:25] being sealed with the holy ghost
[1:11:28] is a must
[1:11:33] andrew preached last night and he
[1:11:35] touched on emotions and that's where
[1:11:37] satan's trigger point is satan don't
[1:11:40] mind you going to a rock and roll
[1:11:41] convention and scream and holler and do
[1:11:44] every kind of illicit thing
[1:11:46] he don't mind you going to a ball game
[1:11:48] and worshiping guys
[1:11:50] that make millions and millions of
[1:11:52] dollars
[1:11:59] he don't mind you fanning there but you
[1:12:01] come to church
[1:12:03] and he reminds you to believe
[1:12:06] just believe
[1:12:08] you just believe and and you know that's
[1:12:10] partly correct
[1:12:12] you've got to believe
[1:12:14] but if you believe it's got attachments
[1:12:17] that goes with it
[1:12:20] no emotion is not the certification
[1:12:24] that you got it
[1:12:25] but it goes with it
[1:12:28] are you with me tongues is not the
[1:12:30] evidence but it goes with it
[1:12:33] miracles is not the evidence but it goes
[1:12:36] with it all the gifts go with it and if
[1:12:39] you've got jesus christ inside of you
[1:12:42] which is this message it all goes with
[1:12:45] it
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:56] so don't let no hypocrite
[1:12:59] make fun of your worship
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:03] because they don't have it themselves
[1:13:07] don't let no hypocrite even if he's a
[1:13:09] preacher try to calm you down a little
[1:13:12] bit
[1:13:14] just cause they ain't got enough victory
[1:13:16] to praise the lord don't mean that your
[1:13:19] victory should be shut up
[1:13:37] i'm putting together another sermon i
[1:13:39] preached it many years ago the autopsy
[1:13:41] of a dead church
[1:13:43] and i want to tell you why a lot of
[1:13:45] churches are dead
[1:13:46] they've got a nice machine for a
[1:13:48] preacher
[1:13:49] and he's preaching ice cubes all across
[1:13:51] the audience
[1:13:54] the scripture tells us let everything
[1:13:56] that hath breath praise the lord
[1:14:00] you have a reason not to worship
[1:14:03] if you're dead but if you're alive and
[1:14:06] you've got oxygen in your lungs you
[1:14:09] ought to worship with all your might
[1:14:20] don't tell me about what you're going to
[1:14:21] do on streets of gold you're doing what
[1:14:24] you're doing right here it's what you'll
[1:14:26] do over there
[1:14:28] because death is only your dwell this
[1:14:31] don't change you
[1:14:46] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:50] let the redeemed of the earth say so
[1:15:03] this goes too good with that
[1:15:06] people don't want prayer lines anymore
[1:15:09] but i can take you back through some
[1:15:10] power lines that i have been through
[1:15:15] mariah that had the alcopecia as a
[1:15:18] disease and the last time i was in
[1:15:20] louisiana and she came across that
[1:15:22] platform with three bobby pins in her
[1:15:25] hand
[1:15:27] she believed that when she walked
[1:15:29] through that prayer line her hair would
[1:15:31] begin to grow again
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:34] i want to say this to every devil in
[1:15:36] hell and it did
[1:15:48] it was in a prayer line that i saw the
[1:15:50] vision of drew walking
[1:15:56] i got a picture of him this morning
[1:15:58] fishing at the edge of the lake with his
[1:16:01] little hat on
[1:16:03] saying don't i look dapper today
[1:16:08] let me just say this you god that's rich
[1:16:11] in mercy
[1:16:12] knows how to change your future
[1:16:16] in a moment whether it's a prayer line
[1:16:18] or a powerful service
[1:16:20] whether you're sitting on the front or
[1:16:22] sitting in the back
[1:16:24] [Applause]
[1:16:42] this is the writing
[1:16:43] that was written
[1:16:45] many many tackles safari
[1:16:52] this is the interpretation
[1:16:55] of the thing
[1:16:57] many
[1:16:59] god hath numbered
[1:17:01] thy kingdom
[1:17:02] notice these next words
[1:17:05] and it's finished
[1:17:12] i said this the other day i did it my
[1:17:14] way they sink

[1:17:29] and found wanting
[1:17:32] perez
[1:17:33] thy kingdom is divided
[1:17:36] and given to the medes
[1:17:38] and the persians
[1:17:40] they were drinking
[1:17:43] they had forgotten god
[1:17:46] they no longer wanted daniel as their
[1:17:48] spiritual leader
[1:18:09] if i take a break i got a right to take
[1:18:11] a break
[1:18:21] as great as this kingdom was
[1:18:23] here pro puts it a prophet
[1:18:26] i want to i want to hone in on something
[1:18:28] here just for a moment
[1:18:30] i don't know how much further i can go
[1:18:34] but this kingdom was getting ready to
[1:18:36] fall apart tonight
[1:18:39] tonight
[1:18:41] tonight
[1:18:44] this was the greatest kingdom on earth
[1:18:47] this was the richest kingdom that there
[1:18:49] was
[1:18:52] but sin
[1:18:55] had caused them to rotten
[1:18:59] the scripture bears out that this young
[1:19:01] king had got lifted
[1:19:03] in his spirit
[1:19:12] and now he doesn't realize it
[1:19:15] but if you would take it by time
[1:19:20] he's got hours to live
[1:19:23] not days not months
[1:19:25] he's got the best doctors
[1:19:27] he's got the best military men that
[1:19:29] there is
[1:19:31] he's got some of the greatest advisors
[1:19:33] that you can have
[1:19:34] and he's only got hours
[1:19:38] to live
[1:19:49] you're weighed
[1:19:52] you found wanting
[1:19:54] god won't destroy you until it's the
[1:19:56] measure of the cup is full
[1:19:59] the cup of iniquity is full here in
[1:20:01] america
[1:20:02] i know this is going to a lot of other
[1:20:04] countries
[1:20:05] but america is a awesome nation our flag
[1:20:08] still hangs here
[1:20:10] we are still identified as a nation we
[1:20:13] we still love our country
[1:20:15] but it's rotten it's forgotten god the
[1:20:17] revival's not coming back to it
[1:20:20] we kill so many babies every day it's
[1:20:23] murder i don't care how you say it i
[1:20:25] don't know

[1:20:52] world
[1:20:54] about one percent of the country of the
[1:20:56] whole
[1:20:57] the whole
[1:20:59] place
[1:21:00] has come to a spot to where families
[1:21:02] don't even want to take their children
[1:21:04] there anymore
[1:21:08] it don't take 50 percent
[1:21:11] it just takes one percent
[1:21:16] of the top-level billionaires to start
[1:21:19] making decisions
[1:21:21] because their life is rotten
[1:21:24] their decisions will be rotten
[1:21:27] that's why america has fell apart
[1:21:31] it isn't a common everyday folk
[1:21:43] i'm sorry
[1:21:45] i don't care which party you're
[1:21:47] associated with your party has let you
[1:21:49] down
[1:21:53] your party has let you down and they're
[1:21:56] rotten
[1:22:01] let me just say this to you our prophet
[1:22:03] would say this we're at a point to where
[1:22:05] you could put an abraham lincoln
[1:22:08] and a george washington in every county
[1:22:13] and you couldn't turn it around
[1:22:16] and to give you an example some good
[1:22:18] moral person will begin to speak out and
[1:22:21] immediately
[1:22:24] they will be tormented
[1:22:32] well this ain't new
[1:22:35] have you ever wondered what happened to
[1:22:38] the 56 men that signed the declaration
[1:22:41] of independence
[1:22:44] men that said we don't want to pay
[1:22:46] taxes
[1:22:48] if you're interested in how much taxes
[1:22:50] they were paying
[1:22:51] you as an audience are paying about 40
[1:22:53] percent
[1:22:57] whether you know that or not
[1:22:58] it takes you to the middle of june or
[1:23:01] the end of june to ever start making
[1:23:04] money for yourself
[1:23:06] because we're so taxed here in this
[1:23:08] country
[1:23:11] don't get mad at me i am the messenger
[1:23:18] and these people were tired
[1:23:21] of the foreign country telling us how to
[1:23:23] worship
[1:23:27] and taxing us on their teeth and their
[1:23:30] products
[1:23:31] and they were being taxed
[1:23:33] .5
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:36] not 40
[1:23:39] a half a penny
[1:23:42] was the tax that was being levied
[1:23:44] against him but they said we will not
[1:23:47] let you be ruler over top of us
[1:23:51] 56 men
[1:23:54] men that were not vagabonds
[1:23:56] they were not dear licks they were
[1:23:59] powerful men that owned companies that
[1:24:03] were lawyers
[1:24:09] several of them were millionaires in
[1:24:11] that day
[1:24:15] let me just describe to you what it
[1:24:16] costs to stand up
[1:24:19] sent this to my family this morning
[1:24:20] maybe you're interested in it
[1:24:23] five the signers
[1:24:24] five of those signers
[1:24:27] were captured by the british as traitors
[1:24:31] they were tortured
[1:24:34] to death
[1:24:35] when you see your declaration of
[1:24:37] independence and we all want it to still
[1:24:39] be a part of our
[1:24:40] remember what it cost them
[1:24:44] they were tortured their names was on
[1:24:47] that page
[1:24:48] and for that reason they were tortured
[1:24:51] and would die from their torture
[1:24:53] 12 had their homes ransacked and burned
[1:24:59] two lost their sons serving the
[1:25:01] revolutionary army
[1:25:03] another had sons captured
[1:25:06] nine of the 56

[1:26:20] independence stay with me
[1:26:23] knowing full well

[1:27:07] brother ron i don't like this kind of
[1:27:08] preaching
[1:27:10] hang around i'm only getting grayer
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:24] his possessions were taken from him

[1:27:54] cornwallis had taken over his home for
[1:27:58] his
[1:27:58] headquarters
[1:28:00] this was his response
[1:28:04] he quietly urged general george
[1:28:07] washington to open fire
[1:28:10] and destroy his home
[1:28:13] because he refused the enemy
[1:28:16] come on church
[1:28:18] [Applause]
[1:28:21] these men
[1:28:25] it seemed it seemed glorious that these
[1:28:28] men would be there and sign this but it
[1:28:31] come with cost
[1:28:32] [Applause]
[1:28:34] listen being in a rapture is going to
[1:28:36] come with costs
[1:28:38] [Applause]
[1:28:41] i'm willing to pay the cost
[1:28:44] i'm willing to stand for jesus
[1:28:47] i'm willing to stand when kingdoms are
[1:28:49] falling
[1:28:51] and crashing around us
[1:28:53] like daniel will still be standing
[1:28:58] [Applause]
[1:29:12] thank
[1:29:22] you i'll i'll leave you with this
[1:29:26] for a side note
[1:29:28] john hancock
[1:29:29] when he came his turn to sign
[1:29:31] he said i want to sign it so
[1:29:34] big
[1:29:35] until the king can read my name
[1:29:39] without putting these glasses on
[1:29:47] let me just say this to you
[1:29:49] i'm not i could care less if i'm in the
[1:29:51] top 10 15 5
[1:29:53] preachers in the message
[1:29:55] could care less about that
[1:29:57] but i want to be in the top 10 in hell
[1:30:01] that's the biggest enemy that hell's got
[1:30:11] brother ron i'm afraid to get shot at
[1:30:13] then you're not a warrior
[1:30:17] no doubt daniel
[1:30:19] stood
[1:30:20] and refused to be
[1:30:22] defiled with the king's meat
[1:30:26] but no matter what condition he was in
[1:30:28] he was successful
[1:30:30] regardless of whether he was in bondage
[1:30:33] or captive he still became the ruler
[1:30:38] can you imagine the jealousy that he had
[1:30:40] to deal with
[1:30:43] humans fight because since the garden
[1:30:45] there's been jealousy
[1:30:48] that's why abel was killed because of
[1:30:50] jealousy
[1:30:53] they can't make a god out of you they'll
[1:30:55] make a devil out of you
[1:30:58] they get jealous of when god blesses you
[1:31:01] and because you give your tenth he gives
[1:31:03] you a hundredfold
[1:31:07] no matter what you drive people will be
[1:31:09] jealous
[1:31:10] no matter what kind of home you live in
[1:31:12] people will be jealous
[1:31:14] can't they see that god blesses those
[1:31:17] that bless him
[1:31:21] i'm not preaching a prosperity god but i
[1:31:23] want a prosperity gospel like the
[1:31:25] charismatics do but i'm saying you're
[1:31:28] god's children and you're entitled to
[1:31:30] benefits
[1:31:34] don't let the devil rob your benefits
[1:31:36] away from you
[1:31:38] [Applause]
[1:31:51] jealousy drives critics
[1:31:54] they make comments
[1:31:57] because of their human spirit
[1:32:00] and in their human spirit they cut and
[1:32:03] bite
[1:32:05] look what they got
[1:32:06] do you understand what they went through
[1:32:08] to get what they got
[1:32:13] i drive by brother william's home
[1:32:16] it's okay to pick on you
[1:32:20] i've never had a day where i ever
[1:32:23] ever commented
[1:32:25] on who does he think he is
[1:32:31] i only wish he could have built one
[1:32:33] bigger
[1:32:38] and if he would come in driving the
[1:32:40] greatest luxury car that there is
[1:32:45] it wouldn't cause me
[1:32:48] one drop of jealousy
[1:32:52] if you can't see your brother and sister
[1:32:54] blessed
[1:32:55] [Applause]
[1:33:12] i recently bought a coin
[1:33:14] it was in a package of 12.
[1:33:18] i gave 78 for that package
[1:33:21] at an auction
[1:33:26] people say well how do you make your
[1:33:28] money i'm gonna give you just a touch
[1:33:34] while you're on your couch relaxing
[1:33:37] i'm driven
[1:33:39] cancer will not defeat me
[1:33:41] cause i'm driven
[1:33:43] i'm driven for this gospel i'm driven
[1:33:45] for this message i'm driven in
[1:33:46] everything that i do
[1:33:53] and i bought a package of coins
[1:33:57] i gave 78 i'm not gonna hide nothing
[1:33:59] from you listen money don't rule me
[1:34:05] i gave 78 for that package
[1:34:10] those coins are worth 299 dollars a
[1:34:16] piece let me just say this to you if you
[1:34:19] can get yourself in a spot
[1:34:22] to where god can bless you
[1:34:25] it's not who you are what you are
[1:34:28] it's not
[1:34:29] i make myself let me just say that's a
[1:34:31] good way to fall
[1:34:33] but if you can get yourself into a spot
[1:34:35] to where god can bless you
[1:34:43] we had a young man here preached the
[1:34:44] other day he's 25 years old he's going
[1:34:47] to be a daddy in a few days going to be
[1:34:49] a boy
[1:34:52] and no doubt there's a lot of older
[1:34:53] preachers that are jealous of that young
[1:34:55] man
[1:34:59] a young man that didn't have a fighting
[1:35:00] chance
[1:35:02] a multiracial boy born out of a
[1:35:05] difficult marriage raised by his
[1:35:06] grandparents
[1:35:08] but since he was a child said he was
[1:35:10] going to be a preacher sat on the front
[1:35:12] row
[1:35:13] listen at the louisiana camp got an
[1:35:16] experience with god
[1:35:18] now stands in the pulpits like he did
[1:35:20] ours
[1:35:21] andrew glover the other day
[1:35:24] don't throw a stone at him
[1:35:35] but i want to ask you what are you doing
[1:35:37] with your life
[1:35:41] what are you doing with your life are
[1:35:42] you finding yourself with the critic
[1:35:59] huh
[1:36:13] does critics bother you brother ron oh
[1:36:15] they're supposed to be there
[1:36:18] they're supposed to be there
[1:36:22] all their words all their videos
[1:36:25] they're supposed to do that
[1:36:27] but you see i know
[1:36:30] who i am
[1:36:33] and when the angel wakes me up
[1:36:36] and he talks to me i realize where i'm
[1:36:39] standing
[1:36:40] and it don't matter if there's 10
[1:36:42] million critics against me
[1:36:46] are you getting what i'm saying
[1:36:49] i go too
[1:36:50] steve i go to the big doctor tuesday
[1:36:54] she's a wonderful doctor
[1:36:57] but if she tells me i'm eat plumb up
[1:36:59] with cancer and there's nothing more she
[1:37:00] can do for me i'm going to walk out of
[1:37:02] that place
[1:37:05] just the way that i walked in
[1:37:08] believing another report
[1:37:11] by his stripes i am healed
[1:37:24] brother andy i believe it was you and i
[1:37:26] that had this conversation a lot of
[1:37:27] people can bark and blow and preach and
[1:37:29] do all different kind of things and
[1:37:31] ain't never been in a battle
[1:37:34] but i stand in a complete different
[1:37:35] situation
[1:37:37] i've been through hell and still
[1:37:39] standing
[1:37:46] for those that think it's not as bad as
[1:37:48] they think they are let me just say this
[1:37:50] you this last week we passed the
[1:37:52] million-dollar mark
[1:37:54] on medicine that they put through this
[1:37:57] body
[1:37:58] somebody thinks it's bad stuff
[1:38:05] but being where i'm at
[1:38:07] brother clarence's brother
[1:38:10] that has much of the same kind of
[1:38:11] disease
[1:38:13] brother clarence call me and he said
[1:38:16] brother ron he said my brother eugene
[1:38:19] he needs you to come see you
[1:38:22] well you see immediately i responded
[1:38:25] i'll see him this afternoon
[1:38:28] that's exactly what i said
[1:38:30] you see let me give you a little history
[1:38:32] here
[1:38:33] you'll like this sister sarah
[1:38:36] the last time that i went to see sister
[1:38:38] pearl
[1:38:40] i walked out the door and as i walked
[1:38:42] out the door the spirit of the lord
[1:38:44] spoke to me said the next time that you
[1:38:46] walk through that door you'll lead
[1:38:48] eugene to the lord
[1:39:02] and that's exactly the truth
[1:39:06] and that's exactly what happened on
[1:39:08] monday evening
[1:39:10] not only did i lead eugene to the lord
[1:39:12] but i led his wife loretta to the lord
[1:39:15] as well
[1:39:28] oh
[1:40:03] glory
[1:40:17] i don't think you could probably hear
[1:40:18] that on the internet internet but it's
[1:40:19] worth repeating
[1:40:21] on monday i led him to the lord
[1:40:23] he was wearing sunglasses couldn't stand
[1:40:25] light
[1:40:26] he hadn't hate for days
[1:40:31] now this was the kind of man that didn't
[1:40:32] want no part he said i remember one time
[1:40:34] i talked to him he said i'm not ready
[1:40:36] for that yet i'm not ready for that yet
[1:40:38] i'll tell you what god knows he's rich
[1:40:39] in mercy
[1:40:41] on wednesday brother clarence took him
[1:40:43] ham biscuits around here in virginia ham
[1:40:45] biscuits his royalties better than steak
[1:40:50] took him hand biscuits and he ate it
[1:40:52] then he went outside
[1:40:54] didn't even have his sunglasses on he
[1:40:56] went outside
[1:40:57] and and what son wasn't even bothering
[1:40:59] him that's the kind of god that we serve
[1:41:13] that's our god
[1:41:15] that's our god
[1:41:31] this morning i woke up to a vision
[1:41:34] i don't care what the critic's thinking
[1:41:35] now
[1:41:36] i woke up to a vision of a sister in
[1:41:38] this church
[1:41:40] and there was a dark spirit kept telling
[1:41:41] her she was weak and she was weak and
[1:41:43] she was weak and she was weak and i saw
[1:41:46] her turn on that spirit and say i will
[1:41:48] not put up with you no more
[1:41:50] because when you say i'm weak i am
[1:41:52] strong

[1:43:01] my timers went off but i'm not done
[1:43:09] now that kingdom fell
[1:43:12] because the medes and the persians
[1:43:14] actually turned the euphrates river and
[1:43:16] it became dry
[1:43:18] they actually turned it
[1:43:21] and that city became a dry it became a
[1:43:23] dry river almost overnight
[1:43:28] and this
[1:43:29] most powerful country
[1:43:32] in a night
[1:43:33] the medes and persians
[1:43:35] invaded them
[1:43:38] and destroyed their kingdom
[1:43:43] king gone

[1:44:13] and brother mark we're still going to be
[1:44:14] standing
[1:44:18] [Applause]
[1:44:29] united states is going to be a memory
[1:44:33] rush is only going to be a memory

[1:44:54] through on your job through your life
[1:44:56] your situations that seem like it's way
[1:44:59] overwhelming
[1:45:01] why don't you just
[1:45:02] i know this is kind of unorthodox for
[1:45:04] the end of a service
[1:45:06] why don't you just right this very
[1:45:08] moment say satan you've been tormenting
[1:45:10] me this way in that way
[1:45:13] when you gone

[1:45:37] i'm still going to be standing
[1:45:40] i'm still going to be standing
[1:45:43] that's the constant in this whole story
[1:45:48] let kingdoms fall
[1:45:51] let them rise
[1:45:52] i'm still going to be standing
[1:45:59] the battle today will get you ready for
[1:46:01] the battle tomorrow
[1:46:05] the very next chapter from chapter 5
[1:46:09] that next kingdom that daniel is still
[1:46:12] the prime minister of
[1:46:16] says he's praying too much
[1:46:21] and so that one percent of the nation
[1:46:23] decided he needs to go into a lion's den
[1:46:30] that one percent of the governing party
[1:46:32] said we got to get rid of that guy
[1:46:35] and the king knew what he was at what
[1:46:37] position he was in
[1:46:40] because of the one percent they put him
[1:46:43] in a lion's den
[1:46:45] but because of he who he was who he was
[1:46:53] he was god with me as a boy he was god
[1:46:56] with me
[1:46:58] when he showed me the writing on the
[1:47:00] wall he'll be god with me in a lion's
[1:47:03] den
[1:47:06] oh king
[1:47:07] i'll see you

[1:47:38] [Applause]
[1:47:54] brother mark we never did pay too much
[1:47:56] continuous attention to our critics no
[1:47:58] way so
[1:47:59] why should we pay any attention to them
[1:48:01] now
[1:48:05] i'll stand with generals
[1:48:07] maybe a little shorter than most
[1:48:10] but i'll stand with generals on that day
[1:48:13] and i'll hear my name called
[1:48:15] and when my name is called
[1:48:18] i'll applaud for all of them
[1:48:20] but when my name is called
[1:48:25] don't you expect me to be quiet
[1:48:29] you silly bunch of dead preachers don't
[1:48:31] you expect me to be quiet when my name
[1:48:34] gets called
[1:48:46] don't know how far i'll have to stroll
[1:48:47] but somebody's going to be meeting me at
[1:48:49] the stairs
[1:48:53] a little blond-headed woman will take my
[1:48:55] arm put her hand up under my arm
[1:49:04] we'll spend eternity together
[1:49:09] well if you get the right one here
[1:49:11] you'll have the right one there well i
[1:49:14] got the right one here
[1:49:18] and i'm enjoying here

[1:49:38] and if you ain't fell in love with jesus
[1:49:40] fall in love with him
[1:49:42] and if he wants me to dress a certain

[1:49:46] he wants for me to listen to a certain
[1:49:47] kind of music i'm going to listen to
[1:49:48] that certain kind of music
[1:49:50] if he wants me to dance he wants me to
