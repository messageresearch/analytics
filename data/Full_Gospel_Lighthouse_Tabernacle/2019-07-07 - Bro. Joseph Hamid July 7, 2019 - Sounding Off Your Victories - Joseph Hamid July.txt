[Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah believers here amen I believe he's here this morning I believe the angel of the Lord is in the camp you believe that glory to go and let's have church this morning I believe where the pillar fire is God is I believe the fort man is in the house this morning can you shout him in I believe he's there to bless us one more time how many are expecting a double climax amen a double climax I believe he's here to do that for us well I'll just go ahead and confess to you I didn't really I didn't really think after last night I'll be preaching this morning and they said there were two generals laying back in the chair and these young men were packing us out next thing you know we're going through the parlor of the hotel and brother Marcus said was carrying me and I was staggering through and the woman looked out there so what's wrong with them - wife said they're drunk what do you expect drunken Holy Ghost wine I tell you what's about 130 finally when the anointing start easing off and I dozed off in her sleep and somewhere about 350 for the angel of the Lord woke me up and I felt this presence in the room and I looked to the clock it was 354 and about that time the Holy Spirit swept over my body and a voice spoke to me and said I was sent from the presence of God to strengthen you in your body and spirit and to touch your voice hallelujah I felt the charge of the Holy Ghost came over my body now I am only running in three hours of sleep last night but I felt rejuvenated I woke up this morning I felt like a young man about that time I checked better on he said whatever time that was he musta came by my place soon hallelujah you see you can't put these old general sounds there are non involve Holy Ghost hey man I'm happy to be with you what a joy and a privilege to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning such an honor to be here and to join alliance with Brenner on and another ambassador and general and in the Lord's army and I felt compelled by God to answer these meetings and just for the last two weeks God has been dealing with me and my wife is a witness I would tell her of supernatural things that will happen in these meetings you can meet with her privately and she will share those things with you exactly the way to happened last night those of you know were here last night I want to tell you you were in a divine plan define appointment by the Holy Spirit heaven already knew about it there was no mishap to last night's service now I believe this morning is going to bless this one more time I believe he's here to do that you keep pulling on the word I believe will preach herself right into a body change by the help of the Lord may God bless you on on thirsty we we came in on Thursday evening spend a little time with brother on and sister Connie and then they planned a little time of relaxation for us on Friday before we head into the meetings and what a lovely time we had I certainly appreciate that brother Ron to see the president a home and such like Thomas Jefferson that certainly was an honor to go there and see all those things we came back to the house and it was a little late tonight my spirit was sort of roaming and I'd already had a direction that God was taking me in and pretty much everything in the right line up but somewhere about midnight the presence of God swept in the room and says I want you to preach the climax message tomorrow night that's an okay God whatever you want me to do normally a message I preached at a climax but I'm so thankful not even thinking about it do you realize we were here four and a half hours last night God knew exactly what he was doing because there were some needs in this place it couldn't wait until today God switched the sermon and give us a climax last night and I believe he'll do it again this morning god bless you we love you this morning appreciate all of you invite you to go with me now in the book of Joshua chapter 6 a very old familiar path scripture certainly appreciate the musicians again I appreciate brother Martin sister Kelly being here with us and there have been I tell you they have been boozing friends and co-worker in a ministry with us and so honor and privilege for him a beer today most of the time he's at home and fronting the services and taking the bullets for me and pressing on and and I sort of stole him away this weekend so they'll probably think the rapture happened because brother Mark is not a church amen but I was so glad to have him sister Kelly and their friendship and their respect and Brett Iran they love you they love you and sister Connie and sister Nancy oh my we sure love you folks here god bless you now let's go into the word Pete again it's so nice to have you in Sushma is good to see family in her presence here each and every one of you I want you to I want you to relax this morning even oh it's gonna be well in Jesus name i prophesy on this service great things are going to happen you know why the wise Solomon said the cria thing in a shack on the pass the words of prophecies are within our mouths this morning I speak life over this church in Jesus name Joshua chapter 6 very old familiar paths Joshua now the general after Moses God an appointed Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost to bring the Israelites over we see how that Moses had prepared the people through the laws and brought the law to the people and the covenants and established them to the Israelites but then God moved the Moses off the scene and raised up a Joshua and we noticed that under the Joshua Commission we saw how the Joshua was a man of Valor a mighty man a man that knew how to war a man that knew his enemy he knew how to go in and come out before his enemies and in verses 1 now Joshua or Jericho rather was straightly shut up because of the turn of Israel none went out and none came in isn't it amazing of the Bride of Christ can shut down an entire city realize the power of God is within us that we can cause an entire city to be shut down completely and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into 9 hand Jericho and the kings and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor and he shall come past the city or the man of war and go around the city once thus shalt thou do six days and seven priests shall bare before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and saying the seventh day he shall compassed the city seven times and presa blow with the trumpets and it came to pass that when they made a long blast with the ram's horn and when he hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall flat and the people shall the sin of every man straight before him and Joshua a son on call the and selling to them take up the Ark of the Covenant and let's seven priests there are seven trumpets of rams horns before the Ark of the Lord just for the sake of time I like to drop down to verses 10 and Joshua commanded the people saying he shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout then shall I shout this is very ironic isn't it this is quite a contrast isn't it at one time God is telling the people who shouts out another time he's telling the people to shut up hello somebody cannot bridge this morning you see you got to know what a shouts and you gotta know what'll be solids will help us Jesus turn to your neighbor right now listen neighbor we are gonna make some sound in this place in verses 20 so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet that the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they watch they took the city there were no spectators in the church that did not come to see who shouted last night's that one there to sit in the seat of the scornful they went in the house of God and their chip their inheritance glory my and just for a backdrop go with me now into first Kings 18 quite a setting here backslidden a hat join up alliance with is 450 false prophets my God and 400 men that serve grouse bow to Isles he should have never left this God appointed place as a Israelites but he was back slidden trying to hold a revival hello somebody same where we got a many a Batson preachers channel whole revival with their 450 prophets and 400 that powder art - idolatrous and here he is now somewhere bad I believer are the 19 verse they came to Elijah and a prophet the evening messenger and he said if you want to have a meeting gather all the people on maan camel and we're gonna have a meeting go ahead and bring your 450 prophets with you Balaam if you think that's gonna give you some kind of a some kind of a back up go ahead and bring them and we gonna have a showdown and it was here now where you know what happened he call upon them and challenge them to call upon their gods and and whoever God was God he won't answer by fire I like that hallelujah yes they did and they came and they they brought their sacrifice and they cut their their Rams their blocks they laid upon the altar and their shouted and they danced upon their altar under and all dispensations anointing broke down the altar and Elijah looked out and says where's your God where's your God in the Bible says that he lied to repair the altar hallelujah I'm so glad that he lied to repair the altar in this age I'm so glad at the altar has been restored in the name of Jesus Christ that we can shout and we know what we are shouting about we can dance and we know when we're dancing about we can shout and dance and praise God upon the newfound altar of the revealed word of the our you believe it church amen what a what a message he came he came down he challenged them evening messenger call all the preachers in Chicago and challenged 7 then indicted them as he did right here then he turns around and he blesses the people in verses 41 and he lives his said unto a hat get the up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain there is a sound out of abundance of rain I like to speak to you this morning on a thought sounding off your victories sounding off your victories let us pray our Heavenly Father would deem it such a grand privilege to be with the body of Christ once again we would just ask that you will take preeminence now in this service and may your divine presence just set across this audience Lord and may it be such a holy hush of your glory they'll sweep in this place that they'll not be a person under the sound of my voice that will not witness the presence and know that you've been here I pray God that your Holy Spirit will take its place now as we're settling in a bit if we've engaged the Scriptures I pray that you will now engage the anointing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says amen before you see the turnaround to your neighbor and shake your hands and you may be seated you appreciate him something off your victories in a message just to give a backdrop and the bill for a bad platform uncertain sound red Ram said Jesus sounded his trumpet he sold them by his signs and wonders that he was the Messiah yes sir the Christian soldier is strained to hear the word sound of the gospel the real Christian soldier is strain to that you see Jesus had a sound about him that was different than the sounds that was around him he had a distinction and a sound that didn't sound like the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the religious people of that day his sound was different than the people of this time in a message returned in Jubilee the Prophet said it's time to rise the sons of God in the name of Jesus Christ and the rise to the place so you can return to this Jubilee and hear the sound of the trumpet of the gospel of the word of God now your sounds your words have power the power is in the word that you speak I want you to think about the power of one's voice this morning and remember in the case it will go back in the Old Testament in the case of Cain and Abel God said that the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground that even though that Abel had died in the flesh there was still a power of God within the blood of a Son of God there was a sound that cried into the heavens that reached into the throne of God it was a sound that was so different that even in death the Bible says that it was voice was still alive because God's blood cannot be killed you see it's still rippled through the heavens he could not have been stopped Cain may have tried to destroy that seed but he could not destroy that life that blood the sound that was in that scene of God Abel and even that he died his voice the voice of his blood riffled into the heavenly bread and said there's again a lot of people in land two hundred their message will be the final voice to the final age you see the power of one's voice that voice has power to change the circumstances and situations from defeat into victories this morning or from victories to failures now I want to ask you a question I like to pose this question to you this morning how do you use the power of your voice what are you sounding off this morning the creative power of God is in your mouth today the creative power God is within our mouths and you release the creative power of God by the spoken word you see it all hinges back to a sound sound is powerful this morning sound is captivating today sound will bring you into your position of three today when you release the creative power of God by the spoken word understand that the creative abilities of God I released sir by the sound of words the sound of words releases the creative ability of God within us God's creation is within my bodies the power of God lies within our bodies and creation is released by the sound of her words sound has power we go back and we can give the account of creation and it's all about sound he said God spoke things into existence amen the sound of God's voice cause action and reaction when God spoke the sound that went out of God out of God went forth the logos are the spirit that word that said let there be and there was a power of creation in the sound I was worse and God said let there be light and out of God even emanated a sound and the sound went out into the world and begin to create by the sound of God's voice God spoke things into existence yes the sound of God's voice causes actions and reactions you see sound isn't just used for communication this morning we understand from Genesis that God uses sounds for creation God sets atmosphere and things by the tool of sounds sounds sets the atmosphere and mood of a place you can walk into a restaurant at a certain time whether you're having breakfast or lunch or a fine dining in the evening they know how to manipulate the sound of the music to create the atmosphere and a mood to bring their audience into captivity sounds have the ability to captivate our minds and spirits can you say man you see we underestimate the power of sounds so we fail to investigate its importance this morning so weakness begins to permeate our lives it's time that we let sound reverberates in our life it is time that we allow sound to reverberate in our lives it's time that we allow ourselves to be healed to God and let sound begin to reverberate in our lives this morning you see sound pulls stuff out of you sound pull certain abilities out of your life sound pull out what is on the inside of you this morning by the power of sound you can captivate an audience aiming by that call of a name you can pull out stuff out of people's life hallelujah amen so sound pull stuff out of you this morning I have some grandchildren and when my little Adeline Kate is at the house I know just what to say to pull certain things out of her you see certain sound trolls hair by the things that I do when she hears the candy jar shakes you see sound pulls something out of her am i talking you this morning aimin when she hears our mama says Adeline cake Haltom it sets a different mood because that is the only time when we're trouble that our parents call us by our full names but you just see the sound it pulls stuff out of you I'm talking to you this morning come on communicate with me today hey man I'm gonna pull some stuff out of you this morning because sound cause stuff out of your lives is that correct you see something cause you know dance when you don't feel like dancing why do you think the world spends billions of dollars to outfit venues with mics and amplifiers and speakers they understand the power of sound this morning you see how problem is that our world has learned how to harness the power of sound more effectively than the children of God that's right and the usage imagine imagine sitting down and watching a movie without sound they know just how to bring the right sound into the right scenery because it works under human emotions it brings tears and brings sadness it brings joy and they know how to orchestrate the music to pull herself out of your life am I talking to you and God knows how to orchestrate a church by the sound of the preachers he knows when I bring in a high and a low Amen he knows how to change are the tunes and the keys within the body of Christ amen Millie you could sometimes you come into the church and and there's times you there's a melancholy that is upon you and sadly our gorgeous Thomas and Belle Ron comes appear and suddenly begins to break into an anointing and suddenly he drops into that channel of a certain sound and when he begins a sound off that specific sound on that spirit of Mellon colonist suddenly a man that Mellon colonists that thing is broken by the sound of his voice so as we move forward we need to learn some sound doctrines amen I'm here to pull some stuff out of you this morning a man we're gonna have some sound in the slice everybody say sound in verses Stan in our opening caps Joshua had given orders to the people don't shout andthat's don't even speak not so much as a whisper and she hear me said shout dense shadow way in verses 11 verse 13 he sent the Ark of the Lord on his way around the city and Obama said that it circles once it came back to camp state for a night and Joshua was up early the next morning and the priest took up the Ark of the Lord and the seven priests carrying the seven ram's horn trumpets March before the Ark of the Lord and marching and gone to trumpet with the armed guards marched before the rear guards marching after marching and blowing of the trumpets we understand him on the second day they again circle the city once and return to camp they did this the Bible told us six days and verses 15 and 17 it says and when the seven day came they got up early and more surround the city the same way but seven times yes this day they circled the city seven times this was a different time this was a different season this was a luther's day this wasn't Leslie say this wasn't the restoration of the gifts day this was the opening of the seven seals moments Joshua now is stepping down hallelujah getting ready to tear down all the seven seals and break down the walls and let the people go in to their inheritance so the seven the seven day we understand seven times around breeze blew the trumpet and Joshua signal the people when Joshua signal the people shout they shouted and he said shout because God has given you the city do you see the city and everything in it is under the holy curse and offer up to God now you see your sound that's powering it this morning your sound can put a curse on the entire city in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah and the sound of the sound and entire city came under a holy curse and was offer up to God but let me tell you something you have the power of God within you by your sound to conquer your New Jerusalem your new city your New Jerusalem is that new body that God has prepared for you it's the seal for the body that glorified body you've got some sound inside of you this morning you believe in church holiday the Bible said the entire city now was under a curse to those people but understand the bride is coming to her physician there's another city that we're getting ready to possess by the sound of our voice and we'll snake herself rider do not change you believe in this morning you see the city and everything and it is under the heart of the holy curse now we understand in verses 20 and the priests blew the trumpet when the people heard the blast of the trumpet and they gave a thunderclap shout you know I like a shouts that stays with you I like to hear shouts that just oh my just registers I like to hear or shouts that you'll always remember I don't like some of these little old whiny shouts I like to see somebody shout anyone there shout something is happening in their lives you believe a church I believe the bride has got a thunderclap shot don't you because we are the thunders of this age and I believe the bride is coming to that place this morning it'll stake these seven on long thunders the wake of the bride I believe she's woken up by a thunder our voice you believe it now the Bible said though the walls fell at once and the people rushed straight into the city and took it hallelujah some morning between 6:00 and 9:00 there's gonna be a sound that goes out in the Church of God and a sweeper come over the body of Christ and brother we are gonna rush right into our brand-new bodies hello somebody can I preach and there won't be no grave they'll be able homeless body down hallelujah cuz I'm a come out out on the ground because there be no grave there are all this body now hallelujah when the sound must at the anointing there's nothing can alter back you believe it this morning I want to say this is a very familiar story but you see that's not really my message I could still got to tell you something about sound this morning because that was in Joshua's days can I talk to you about your time right now can I tell you about something that's getting ready to happen you see this this is a familiar story but I want to remind you that it revolves around cell you see sound precedes victory can you say man Joshua give a very special instruction he says March in silence shalt then the wall falls flat notice that he didn't say March wall falls down then you shall are you with me out there you see we have to shout before the wall so we've got the shout before the wall so we've got the sound before Jericho Falls we have got the shout before the walls fall taking it back before it ever manifests you see the sound is within you to speak it and then God will materialize around it I were together now you see too many of us never see the walls fall because we have lost our sounds amen we want to see the thing than shout we will not change the miracle than praise we want to be healed then dance we want to see the provision then shout we have lost the concept of the sounding off of our victory before it even first we want to sit on easy streets we want to sit in the church view and that the preacher bless

big enemy you need a big price anybody have victory that need to sound off this morning come on somebody anybody's got some victory they need to sound off the only ghost is in this place kakazu Cunha cassia got Makoku secrecy glory of God sell this house right now let me ship down for just a moment I want to point out to you that silence is supposed to be for a season I want you to know they'll have no issues with silence the wise Solomon said that it's a time for silence and a time to speak in fact one of my favorite verses in the Bible is revelations 8:1 it declares there will be silent in heaven for the space of 30 minutes but even in boats of those passages silence is a season Joshua's instructions were clear there was a time for silence six days of saying nothing six days of shut up but it was for a season tell somebody silence is only for a season are you there with me silence is just for a season hallelujah may God help us this morning in fact what I will tell you is that the silence was the birthplace of the shout oh did you catch it silence was the birthplace of the south when the Israelites got silence and burnin a shout and then the shouted what garden reveal was manifested in the shout oh my if some of us could just shut up for a few days we might actually have a shout burped within us hello hello somebody are you home I can't have Church with you you got mail you got mail if some of us were shut up for a little while but roughs i shout would be bursted in our spirits a man but you see my concern is that I think that too many of us have become locked in silence permanently permanently who praise the Lord the seven seas has been open in this church we know at the opening of the seven seals there was silence we just don't have to we don't need all that emotion and all that shouting and all that carrying on whose altar are you dancing on Balaam's are Elijah's hello whose altar are you dancing on Pelham's I relax us but many of us have become locked in silence season permanently you see the revelation from Jericho is that if there's no sound there's no victory too many of us have lost our sounds we have lost our sound so we have lost our victory we have no problem with holy hushes and appropriate reverence and what I do have problem with is silence when it becomes deadly come on church this church gets silent you better bury it hey man I got a problem when solids become deadly we got too many dead churches around the ranks of this message because I do silence silence I second preeminence over the people of God we have to know that silence is for a season you see your sound dictates your results your sound dictates your results without my sound this morning a man sounding the Prophet said god hiding revealing simplicity the complete Word of God rests within them at the very command at their own voice is creative power because in them is the Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost as a creator he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes God in action your sound dictates your results come on husband you know it is you can have you can have a moment of intense and your words can either break or make that argument you can choose to say you know I was wrong or you can choose to say I'm the man of this house I wear the pants what I hear a man say that I know he don't if you're wearing the pants why are you gonna tell somebody you got pants on they can see for themselves who's wearing the pants problem God said a woman ought to be on the authority of a man praise the Lord bless the Lord holy God you need to shut up and get reborn again by the Holy Ghost you see we sound the way in a victory but you silent your way into the feet many of God's people are living in impoverishment and defeatism because they fail the song of their victories you see you should have an overflow in your life this morning you shall have an overflow in your life do you believe it and you create overflow as you speak into existence things that are not father Abraham speak things that were not into existence he pulled it out of the celestial realm right into his dimension you believe it French you realize what you have need of is already in existence you got to reach into that celestial realm and drag it into this dimension you see your body is already healed because your spirits has already went into that dimension and see your perfect body it's just now waiting for that body of flesh to get caught up with the revelation that's on the other side hello somebody they even tell your body right now I'm healed notify your body healing it's on its wing notify your family restoration it's on its way I believe it friends I believe it's is this old body even sometimes you're trying to drag it along amen we're trying to just together to convince but my spirit already went into the spirit world and saw my deliverance I already crossed over into Canaan and saw the grace and I'm coming back to tell this body I'm sounding off my victory is alright with you this morning I mean selling off your victories every one of you two came in a prayer line last night aimin keep selling off your victories keep selling off your victories keep selling off your victories the devil tell you all that was just a work up this was just a figment of the imagination that was just our that's just another service no it wasn't it was God I came now you see most of us never win the victory because we remain silent all the time you see you can remain locked out of your inheritance and bounty God has prepared for you if you fail the Sun off this morning in James 3 speaks of the power of the tongue you see you turn the whole body if you turn the tongue you have you you you you got to understand you have to get your tongue your tongue involved in the process of your victory amen you got to get your tongue involved in the process of your victory you believe it Amos of the tongue turns the whole body your tongue turns your all destiny your tongue cancer your your the direction that you're going with so you got to get your tongue involved in the process of your victory Bertram's said it this way he said don't accept accepted or accept God's gift he said don't have a negative testimony don't never let your testimony be negative it turns the whole body you see you can't deal with life's challenges without being horrible you cannot face your problems without being verbose you cannot pull into a shell and say I'm not talking to anybody else in the church anybody has hurt me nobody loves me you see you can never have century until you sound off are you with me now there has to be sound you see silence is the absence of sound not a substitute of sound silence is the absence of sound not the substitutes for sound this morning but while we were in the season of silence our enemies will spread out and Isis spread out spread out relic use insults fear and sicknesses you see Satan thinks he can kill our sound this morning but in essence all he's doing is helping to create some sound in our lives Satan's war I'm gonna kill their sound but a little doesn't know how he's been used by God to create some sound in our life I want to challenge you this morning that you have been if you have been under attack then this message just sent us sounding you today but right

our sounds has to change amen our sound has to change let's all stand amen our sounds has to change we have to exit the silence season with a shout Amen we've got the exit the silent season what a shell notice that their victory did not end with silence they ended that's the test and that Commission what a shout and we got to exit the silent season what a shout you see I'm calling you to move out of the solid season passion release the sound that is in you I have this morning friends I have some serious issue with people that have stoic sounds amen I have serious issue with people to say they believe the Prophet and the son of man and the message yet they have a stoic sound I'm tired of hanging around I've been around enough stoic believers that had no sound inside of them that when God does something for us praise God hallelujah you can be in Walmart you can be in a Dollar General I don't know where you'll be but praise God too many start believers in this message I'm looking for some God believers that realize that sounds proceeds victories this morning I'm looking for some believers that realize that sound pert seeds fig trees they believe it's I believe it's in the name of Jesus Christ may God help us this morning are you willing to say God I'm gonna exit this silent season in my life I'm gonna exit the silent season in my life hallelujah I'm moving into the place with God right now with your heads bowed many have not marched into the level of victory God has for them yet you see sound is the key that can unlock that for us we underestimate its power it can
