have an unspoken request he'd like to lift up to the Lord this morning watch brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just come just pray over these requests this morning gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for allowing us to come here this morning we thank you for such a powerful service that we had last night and the Deliverance as that were made and the testimonies that are going to come forth of that of prodigals coming home Lord and sickness is being delivered and Lord Jesus as we come to you this morning we just ask your children forgive us of every fault every failure that may so easily beset us from you Lord that may hold us back from the Deliverance that we are seeking this morning and Lord Jesus I just think that every time that cancer is spoke across this pulpit that demon trembles because it is it is spoken across in need of prayer to a people that believe every word that you have brought to them in this day and Lord Jesus says the prophet stood time and time again and those demons would flee and those demons would they would have to give way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as you're the same yesterday today and forever and every time that we speak these needs in your name we know that you will come and be with us it's not a guessing it's not a asking when or how we just take your word and we believe it and we stand on it Lord Jesus I just ask that you'll just come down and be with each and every one that are sick the little children that are out the little children that are fighting different colds and different different ailments that are coming across our body even now Lord and we just ask you to be there with the ones that that have brought forth their friends and those ones in need because they they know that we are a church we are a church that believe and We Stand Together We Stand Together against every evil of this day because we are the light of this day and as Darkness creeps across every place as it creeps across into the street as Satan's trying to overtake every single one of your children we are people standing here that believe that you are a God that can put a hedge around each and every one of us and keep us safe we think just as just as we heard last weekend and the testimony that came forth is we could be driving down the road and evil come and try and take our life but you are guiding us and you're directing us your angels your guardian angels are around us and every every moment that we go and Lord Jesus I just ask that you'll just be here with the minister of the hour this morning be with him that he will be able to speak to our needs speak to every uh every answer that we are looking for this morning you know what we are looking for you know the burdens that we carry but I'm believing that each and every one of us everyone in this building needs a closer walk with you we do not need to come to a point to we are stagnant in our walk but we need to be able to draw closer to you at every moment and we strip every every tradition we strip everything that holds us and and binds us from drawing closer to you because one of these days we will take our last step and Satan we will have that last laugh and Lord Jesus I just ask that you will just be there with our be there with our pastor we thank you for what you've done for him there give him strength and give them give them guidance and give give them a nice flight back in Jesus name we pray amen at this time we're going to receive this morning's offering you give as God's bless you we'll ask brother Stephen short if he

actually let you have your seats just for a moment and uh we're hearing wonderful things from the meeting there in in Canada and brother Ron and brother Ron brother Timothy and brother Tim being there and they said they just had such a mighty move of the Holy Spirit and uh so we're just certainly thankful to see that the Lord is not just working in one part of the world but he's he's right here in the midst of the Church of the Living God and I just want to make mention to you again about next Sunday on October the 2nd brother Ron will be speaking on New Beginnings as as you remember and recall from last weekend and it'll be a rededication and a re baptism uh in in the water of the name and taken on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're going to have a anybody that wants to be baptized to take on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're we're opening in it completely up to you and if you want to rededicate your life to the Lord you can do that anywhere that you are but if you desire to be re-baptized we're going to make make this service typically specifically for excuse me specifically for for those that want to be baptized brother Ron will speak and and I just believe that the Lord is going to do something special and you see when you see a man of God get under under anointing like that it's it's the Lord that is up to something and and I know that there are many that are wanting to take on the name of the Lord may it and some that have not been baptized and there are some that that are wanting to be re-baptized and we just want to thank the Lord for that and so just

we just say we'd have none had a good church service and we would close up and went home but this is the hour of the true Pentecostal of a Mark 16 in action your worship has gone forth and it's a time for the word to come forth you won't tag us with Pentecostal names we are true Pentecostals by an experience that which is about to come forth is the most important part to the Bride of Jesus Christ I'd like to speak to you foreign I'd like to speak to you on what you've just witnessed on anointed by accepting [Music] anointed by accepting if you have your Bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the New Testament over them John chapter 1. verse 11. it's a rather nice birthday gift when the Lord comes by happy birthday brother Stephen foreign just for a moment father how we love you Lord we can never thank you enough for what you have done in the midst of the Church of the Living God Lord your presence is so rich here father Lord the the atmosphere is charged with the Holy Spirit Lord the places just milky all over lord which sense that you're here Lord and now we've come to to break bread again father and Lord we've invited you in Lord Jesus and you've come and Lord Jesus as we take this word father Lord no man could break it like you can Lord no man can read it like you can no man can reveal it but you and we ask the Lord that you'd break bread to your disciples today and Lord let us recognize who we are in you father may we recognize where we are and may we recognize that we are in the presence of the same one that was here at the very beginning Lord thank you for your word in Jesus name amen I believe whatever you have need of this morning shall be met in the presence of The Great I Am John chapter 1 and verse 11. and he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory the glory as the of the only begotten of the father full of grace and of Truth and John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received Grace for Grace for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ and no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him he hath openly showed him he hath openly manifested him verse 40. one of the two which heard John speak followed him and was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah Thou Art Thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone may God bless his word he may be seated this morning in the presence in the presence of the Lord as I said I'd like to speak to you this morning on anointed by accepting accepting as you're very aware it is the content consent to receive it is to receive willfully and it is to receive with with with to receive willingly and to give an affirmative answer to an offer or a proposal to say yes to it when you're when you are accepting something you're not turning it down but you're saying yes to it just like when Rebecca was standing there with Eliezer when she when Eliezer asked of the damsel what would be her response would she go to her Isaac and would she go and the and the mother and the brothers wanted her to stay a while longer but he said ask of the damsel what she will say and her response was I will go and what she was doing was accepting the call to go meet her Isaac and I believe that that is what is happening right here in the in the midst of the Church of the Living God is that there is a people that are accepting the call to go to go to their Isaac that is there that will meet us in the sky just like Isaac met his Rebecca out in the middle of the field this same Isaac our Lord Jesus Christ will meet us in the middle of the air in a twinkling of an eye and it is be it has been because you have accepted this Elise are calling this last day you have heard a cry you have heard a word go forth and it's called you by your name and you accepted him you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior you accepted him as your healer you accepted him as your provider you accepted him as your protector and you are anointed by accepting what Eve turned down now anybody that's familiar with the message you know exactly where I'm drawing this from in Christ the mystery God revealed William Branham said that in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church let's say that together through his church and have the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man but now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom notice it isn't the bride that is on display everywhere it's her and her bridegroom you see we're nothing without him are you with us tonight William Branham was nothing without the same bridegroom that you are fellowshipping with he was a man just like you are a man he was anointed just like you were anointed but what made the difference was Revelations 10 1 was with Revelations 10 7 and that same Mighty angel that you read about in Revelations 10 1 is the same Mighty angel with a body in this generation of Revelations 10 8 through 11 and that is your portion of accepting what the mighty Angel asks you to do is to take the book accept the book and eat the book and you're watching what is happening in the midst of the Church of the Living God they are not just accepting or they're not just accepting some ordinary man but they are accepting the son of man that is coming in the body form again and you're watching him move in the Church of the Living God like never before he said it is the anointed man now the anointed people why am I to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word his Spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept what he turned down and we come back he comes back and you and I accept it to think that today that you're sitting here you didn't get drawn here by your mother or by your own fleshly desire but it was a deep call to the deep that was drawing you that made you you couldn't live this way if you wanted to you yeah there's been many of people that tried there's been a media people that stood at the Forefront of it there's been a many of people that that looked on it but they didn't see Jesus like you see Jesus but the Bible tells us in second Peter 1 and 21 that the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost and it is that same moving of the spirit of the Living God that moves upon the waters that is drawing you unto himself and to think that the prophecy of old wasn't wasn't dealt with it wasn't brought by the will of Man by their own determination or by their own choice but it was the spirit of the Living God to think that that same one that is here that was on Jonah The Same Spirit that was that was back there with Noah as we heard about last night the same one that was with Daniel and the same one was with Isaiah he's the same one that is moving the Church of the Living God and that's one thing that Believers always watch for they watch for the Fulfillment of what the prophet said you see it's the identification of his presence is when the Lord has spoke something and then you watch the Fulfillment of it don't take me back 10 minutes ago I have myself a shout and fit all over again but to think that that right here this what you're in is a fulfillment and it is an identification of his presence it's when you watch a man of God like like William Branham or or a man like Paul that stayed with the word and you watch those men that stayed with the word and those Believers that are following that prophet's word they're watching that word they're watching it made manifest they're watching for the hour that it's going to come to fruition and when they are when that prophecy comes to fulfillment William Branham said it was that prophet's credentials I'll say this William Branham didn't get to see everything come to fruition but you are the prophet's credentials you are fulfilling what William Branham spoke of in this generation that there would be a final voice with a fine in the final age and would run this message right onto the coming of the Lord you see those prophets knew that the Messiah was coming the prophets they knew that if the Messiah didn't come that all of them were off all of them has missed it Micah missed it if if Jesus wasn't the Messiah my commenced it if Jesus was in the Messiah Isaiah missed it all of those prophets Moses missed it if he was sent that Messiah but Jesus was the credentials of what those prophets had spoke of and I believe that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled every description that all that the prophets had spoke of him to be that Messiah and the Messiah means to be the anointed one it means to be the anointed king anoint means to authorize and when Jesus was here he is the Messiah and that same Messiah is in the Church of the Living God he's not just with you but he's in you and Jesus said in John 14 and 20 that at that day you shall know that I am in the father and the father and me and I in you and to think that this is that day he wasn't a day gone by but it's right now and when Jesus was there he fully accepted that he was the Messiah he knew who he was he accepted who he was he never walked around and hung his head down saying oh I'm not the Messiah I'm not the Son of God if you believe that if you think that Jesus didn't say he was the son of God you've never read throughout the Bible but Jesus put his voice with what those prophets had spoke so Jesus put his own and he clearly identified that I am he that the prophet spoke of that I am the Messiah what is it you are anointed by accepting what Eve turned down and when he comes back when you go reading over in John chapter 14 and verse 3 that that in my father's house are many mansions that I will come again and here he is in this last stage let's read it together and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again you can do everything you want to me but you can never take that away from me that this is that coming I will come again and receive you unto myself this is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in body form this is the bride coming of Christ coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see you you go and I know that I know that I've got every devil in hell a little shook up this morning because the presence of the Lord is here and they need to be scared every devil needs to run for cover this morning because there is an anointing here that'll drive every sickness away it'll drive every disease away it'll drive every evil spirit of anxiety and depression the anointing of the Lord is here but you go to reading throughout the Old Testament and you can find it in Genesis that that men would build altars and they would anoint they would anoint with oil and they would anoint stumps they'd anoint rocks and you can find over in Leviticus when Moses was setting up the levitical priesthood that he would go in there and he would anoint the vessels in the Tabernacle he'd go in there and he would sprinkle the oil of gladness upon Aaron and his sons and upon all the vessels that were there he would take and he would pour the anointing oil and sprinkle it there he was anointing to sanctify those for service and you can find it throughout the Old Testament that prophets were anointed you can find when when when kings were set up you can look when Saul when Saul come under the rain and he was he was under the ministry of Samuel at the time that Samuel found him out into a field and he poured the oil of anointing upon him you behind when David was being set up when he was back there on the back side of that desert and he went before Jesse's all of his sons and they were stacked out there he didn't never he never poured the anointing oil upon any of those brothers except for David now to think about this that anointing is not Talent there's a major difference between talent and anointing there's a lot of people that can play the piano there's a lot of people that know how to hit the right keys but there's a major difference between somebody that is an anointed piano player there's a lot of people that can speak better than myself there's a lot of people that can sing better than myself but it's a major difference between somebody just speaking reverently or speaking nicely but there's a major difference between just speaking and an anointed speaker it isn't a man's style that makes him anointed it's the anointing of the Holy Ghost that has got a man under supreme power under Supreme control that is moving him I've watched a lot of piano players that never can find the anointing of God but they can play better than anybody else that you've ever heard naturally looking at the talent of it but they haven't no anointing to go with it you watch an anointed piano player your mother be a brother or a sister there when the spirit of the Living God just like sister Cassie caught it she caught that anointing and she began to pray the Lord bless you and the Lord keep you what was it it was an anointing that God on sister Cassie and moved her to play the song for the moment you watch there's a lot of people that can preach there's a lot of people can talk but we don't want just some good talk we want some anointed preaching we want something that'll break the strongholds of Satan off of our life we want something that our girls can come to and recognize that they can be delivered we want an anointing we want an anointing that'll break cancer we won an anointing that'll destroy every devil and there is an anointing in the Messiah and his name is Jesus and that's Saint Jesus is in body form once again I say as a Church of the Living God we want his anointing [Applause] it wasn't the oil that made David anointed because Samuel could have went there and he could have poured that shame oil over top of all of Jesse's sons and they never would have been anointed king because God had seen David and David was a man after God's Own Heart you see you could have took those same oil it was a type of what God had already seen on the inside of David I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna have a hard time today I'm gonna have a hard time today but there's a lot of people that may be stacked up against you bigger in stature got a better education but they can never work their way out of a paper bag but the Bride of Jesus Christ has got such an anointing on her she can sing Down Heaven she can praise Down Heaven she can worship Down Heaven and when the enemy comes in like the flood the spirit that's on the inside of that body will cause sickness sickness call black black gold white white it is the anointing you wouldn't be here if you didn't accept this you're anointed by accepting it and the rest of the world is Anointed by rejecting it you see the Hebrews believe from that day forward that the spirit of God was in David the very Mind Of God was in David it was the oil it was a type of the life of the Holy Ghost that is on the believer today when Elders come and they lay their hands on the sick and they anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith is prayed over them it is a type of the Holy Ghost that is backing up that believer's prayer you watch what will happen if you really come under the office of the Holy Ghost and you ask a man of God or a deacon or some brother or some sister that has the anointing upon them I'm not just talking something far off I'm talking to you that there is an anointing that Isaiah 10 and 27 told us that there would be a burden on you and it will be taken away but it is the anointing that breaks the yoke sister Sean you can have a burden on your life but let the anointing come by your way and it's the anointing that breaks the Yoke off of your life you can have all kinds of things and you watch as the anointing flows and it'll break the very bondage off of your life it's the anointing that does it it isn't the man it's the one that he represents that is doing the work notice what Psalms 28 and 8 says the Lord is our strength and he is a saving strength of his anointed Psalms 45 and 7 thou love is righteousness and hated wickedness therefore God thy God hath anointed thee somebody say thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows second Corinthians 1 and 21 now he would establish us with you in Christ hath anointed us he anointed us is God that the one that is Anointed you is not the man it is God it's just like when David was was writing up Psalms 23 he said you have prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup a runneth over and to think that the anointing has been poured out on this body today that has been poured out upon this body today that your cup is running over when David is saying that he's saying I have an abundance of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and that's what Satan is trying to do he's trying to keep you with a teacup he's trying to keep you so you don't get filled up but my head has been anointed now in hand is my Lord Jesus Christ and they overflow is on the body and Jesus said it's an abundance you know what Satan is to do he's come to kill to steal and to destroy but Jesus said I come to give you life and life more abundantly he's wanting you to flow over run over and I know David said surely in Mercy and goodness shall follow me all the days of my life Hallelujah go back to our text on I came unto my own and my own received me not but to them that believed on me to them I gave power to receive notice what John 3 and 27 said that John answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from Heaven to think that Heavens gave you what you got now notice when you start breaking down that word receive in the Greek Lexicon it is lambeno which means to receive to take to have to catch it is to take with the hand or to take up a thing to be carried to be carried or to take upon oneself to claim for oneself and Jesus said in John 5 and 43 that I am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another succumb in his own name him you will receive how can you believe which receive lambanum which take a hold take a hold for oneself which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that Cometh From God only we don't want to seek the honor of men we want to seek the honor that comes from God and for you to be able to catch that honor it is him that has tooken you he's grabbed you he snatched you out of the hands of the enemy when he thought he was gonna get your sister Hannah God rich in Mercy God rich in Mercy saw something on the inside of your sisters who that men didn't see others didn't see but God Almighty saw you in your weakness he saw you in your condemnation but there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit what's been poured out as a message anointing has been poured out upon this elect lady and you're not just under any anointing but you're under the anointing of a fine equal and you're reminded when you go through the seals that William Branham told us that every single time there went out of a white horse rider a black horse a red horse and a pale horse that there was a there was a power that went forth to combat that thing to watch that when you when you watch when it was the Antichrist that was riding in the first and all the way down through the fourth it was the anointing of Christ that moved on the anointing of a lion and an ox and a man and an ego anointing but this that you are under is a flying eagle anointing and man can't stop this anointing to think that this anointing that you have today I'm doing my best not to not to preach it to you I'm down I'm trying my best to kind of give it to you in a way that I wouldn't typically do but I'm trying to give it to you that the anointing that this body is under was not a man it was the anointing of the Flying Eagle which is Christ which is Christ and when you look up there and you see that anointing and you see that prophets here that eagle was able to pierce through the darkness and to think that your Prophet couldn't even see past 1977 that it was that dark but you're still standing you're still here you're still overcoming you've still got the goods what is it it's the anointing [Applause] we are under the Dominion of the anointed one you see you're under you're under a divine order that came from above this body has a declaration about her and you're under divine order and brother Brandon would tell us that all the way back there in the Garden of Eden I heard him the other day said in the water from The Rock he said you see me he said he said I acted just he said I've handled things where I acted just a little bit different you've seen it on me he said I was watching Adam and Eve walk out of the garden what was it is a prophet that could look all the way back but a prophet could look all the way in the future and to think he wouldn't show him everything but he did show you he did so your Prophet that you would be standing there on the other side of the curtain of time how are you going to get there by accepting this anointing how you going to make it through laodicea by accepting what God said about you if you accept what Satan said about you you wouldn't have been in the building if you had accepted what the critics said about you you'd have never showed up this morning but because you accepted what God has said about you if God before you who can be against you there's a lot of people that's a lot of talking a lot of mouth but the body of Jesus Christ has thus saith the Lord or she sit still this body is under the anointing of Malachi 4 and it will take you all the way into the rapture [Applause] my brother man said that Paul when he went up there in that City he said Timothy he said in that City Timothy was the only one that was up there of like Precious faith that he had he said you know he said the rest of them was a bunch of denominationalism he said but when he got up there into that atmosphere where Timothy was he said you find those things going on you see there was up there and they were having a healing campaign they were up there and they were having Miracles that were done in their life he said when he got in that kind of atmosphere he said you find those kind of things going on he said that's the atmosphere that has created you find people living by faith in that atmosphere you see every one of you sitting here are under the atmosphere of Faith this morning I'm challenging you to believe challenging you to believe that the omnipotence is right here I'm challenging you to believe that the pillar fire is still amongst the Church of the Living God I'm challenging you to believe that there is no cancer there is no tuberculosis there is no skin disease there is no trouble that can stand up to the anointing if William Branham saw that you were going down in defeat he would have told you so if there'd have been another age coming he'd have told you so but William Branham said you're going to be born of his bone life of his life power over his power if that angel stood there I am come from the presence of the Lord we recognize that William Brandon was very specific that the angel that came to him was not Jesus it was the angel of the Lord William Branham told us that he saw Jesus out there in that field he was standing out there Jesus was a real short man but the angel the Lord that came to him was about six foot tall had shoulder length hair had the olive complexion he said but when I was out there in that field he said I saw Jesus out there he said he had such eyes he said if he would have spoke he said the world who could have stopped he could have stopped moving he said but in one moment he said there was such peace about him I'm saying unto you that that same Jesus is here that's saying Jesus is right here and when William Brandon was standing there and he was dealing with patience I know some of you may not understand what I'm saying but there was a healing Angel do you believe that that there was a healing angel that was standing at the pulpit you can go back and I I could pull out ten thousand quotes for you I won't do it because I know that you're well studied and you listen to the message but William Madam would stand there and he would say now now you feel a real you feel a real sweet feeling about you and right around you he said it's the angel of the Lord that's standing between me and you and to think that if I would have brother Gabriel stand up this morning go ahead I'd stand up and I'd say now now you feel this presence that's about you and and you feel it's real sweet and sometimes you can feel it just kind of whip behind you now don't you be nervous about that it's just the angel of the Lord now watch brother Brandon would take a patient like this and he would tell him down now you see I see you you've got this condition you've got this weakness in your body and I see it upon you he said but they're standing in front of you is a well body and if you can get under it and walk to that well body and take your face he said it's the angel of the Lord that'll lead you to that well body thank you to think that there is an angel that is here let's go study the quotes one time about brother random talking about Jacob's Ladder about the Angels coming and ascending and descending upon Jacob's Ladder just go reading over there on that he said brother Adam said that God's got angels that are at their postal duty this morning watching over the aisles watching over his children there's angels that are acting poster duty to make sure that you get it some people would got up and went to the bathroom but there's an angel said stay right there don't go just yet there's something coming for you you think I'm far off brother Brandon said he'd watch evil spirits come and tell people to get up and go to the bathroom and they miss their they miss their anointing that'll make you think twice about going to the bathroom morning now don't Piggy Pants you go ahead that's what it is but I'm telling you you're in an atmosphere where there's an anointing here to make sure you get what you get you didn't you didn't spend all your time asking just for nothing you asked because you wanted to get something from the Lord and to think that all the way back there in the Garden of Eden that there was two atmospheres that was back there go to listening to wisdom versus faith and brother banham said that there Eve got under the wrong atmosphere he said she let go of one atmosphere and went to another and she got out there and she started reasoning with the word of God when Satan interjected one word what was it unbelief broke the anointing that she was under and she went out there and you watch how Satan will move in your life and he'll get you out from an atmosphere of faith and he'll bring you under an atmosphere of knowledge but brother Branham told us he said there's not he said if you can preach this word if the word is preached and it's completely Simplicity and in its completeness he said the knowledge can never overshadow the faith of the people that's in that word now let me bring it to you just a little bit more Elementary so you understand what I'm saying that there's little girls right here that could take this word in its Simplicity and its completeness and speak worlds into existence I don't have to tell you that there is an angel that is here this morning because you feel the anointing of that angel I want to speak to you and tell you that you are going to leave here with that anointing on your life it's not just going to stay in the building Pulpit ain't anointed that wall that drywall ain't anointed but you are anointed you are what God came for God didn't come for that piano yes he can use a piano he ain't come for that guitar yes he can use a guitar he didn't come for the lights he came for you you are the anointed once that's what William Branham told us in the Messiah that he was the anointed one but you are the Lesser lights that makes you just as powerful as Jesus you are the little anointed once and Satan can throw everything that at you but he ain't got enough [Applause] come on somebody what's in your hand Moses it's a rod cast it down he turned into a snake take it up again he turned him back into a rod what was it when Jesus was up there at Calvary and he took the serpent and he took your judgment for you he threw all of your judgment away because he took it upon himself little bride what's in your hand it's the king's sword and I want to speak to you and tell you that what you have in your hand will devour all of Pharaoh's Magic he might have some copycats that'll stand up there by the name of Janice and jambres but I want to tell you that under the anointing of the third poll there can be no mimics there can be no illustrations they can't be no mimics there can't be no makeups they're Satan don't even know what the third pool is but you are the third pool the third pool is in you and the Bride of Jesus Christ is a complete paradox you begin to think about where the message or the message caught you and you begin to think about how far the message has brought you you can't even think the same way laughs I know I ain't alone here but we're all Sinners saved by the grace of God but you can't even think the same way because the Messiah has come by your way and changed your thinking because you no longer have your mind but you have the mind of Christ with Philippians 2 and 5 tells us that this mind let it be in you you can't even think the same way because the message has come by your way and you watch people that have rejected this message they can't even think the same way because they've come under this message you can reject it all you want to but you gather Knowledge from this message and there's a lot of people that are throwing darts back at us because they've got knowledge but where they get that knowledge at they got it under the ministry of Malachi 4 and to think they're anointed by rejecting this message how much more powerful when they get on their blogs and they get on their computers and they make you feel like you ain't nothing but a little old bitty and you stand there and shaken tries to push you back by Darkness don't you accept that you stand there Toe to Toe with that devil there's power in the body you have been anointed to accept know what I'm talking about another man said he said he said now he said you can see now the end time message why it's rejected he said now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery see no denomination the revelation God is not known by a denomination he is known by Revelation and to think that today that Revelation has struck your heart that you can no longer think the same way that you were before you're a complete paradox but William Branham would speak on that six times on the air Paradox and it's incredible but yet it's true I just want you to just take a breather just for a moment and I want you to think about your life as a paradox where your and where you are now that it was the anointing that brought you to where you are I look all over his building it ain't it's full of nothing nothing but a bunch of paradoxes when you begin to read over in the Book of Joshua that that Joshua was there and you can go and read and Joshua 1 all the way down to nine that he was there that as God was with Moses he said so I will be with you that everywhere that the place of your souls tread upon that have I given unto you and Joshua is under commission to breaking down the borders and showing where the children of Israel where they were and you go to reading over in the Book of Joshua it's a great it's a great study how it parallels Ephesians and you can watch that you have been accepted in the Beloved and to think that you're under a Joshua commission and you're watching you go reading over in Joshua and Joshua 1 Joshua 2 Joshua 3 and you read about a paradox Rahab the believer foreign you think about where she was to where she was after the message came by her way it was a complete Paradox saying Rahab was a believer to think I picked on him last weekend might as well get him again to think that out in Frasier would be a believer it's a complete paradox to think that brother Lawrence would be sitting here as a complete Paradox you can call your name it's a complete Paradox to think that where this message caught you and it brought you from and you watch under that jaw that Joshua commissioned that Rahab was brought out Jericho was conquered lands were conquered enemies were disposed and you are under a Joshua commission and you watch every single time you know you know and I'm just I'm just teaching some things here this morning but brother random said he could flip open every Bible and it would flip over to Joshua chapter one and you remember when William Brandon was there that there was a hand that came down from the sky with a cuff and enrolled all the way down from Joshua 1 all the way to Joshua 9. it was showing what commission that the church is under and to think that you have every right this morning you have every right as a son and daughter of God with the authority of a messiah inside of you to cast Satan away to move Satan off of your property to move him off of your household if you've got a Rahab don't you worry she's going to be a believer if you if you got it Jacob don't you worry he's going to be in Israel don't you worry God's going to get his seed [Applause] Believers watch for that fulfillment and watching for it to come to pass is the identification of the prophet's prophecy and when it comes to pass then history has been made and you begin to watch this third pool Ministry that you're under and you watch as it calls to you what is it doing it's pulling you what did it do how do you write uphold her to think that I can accept the impossible as possible I can accept the supernatural As Natural for a believer what was it it was pulling her I heard I heard I think it was brother Wayne he was speaking and he said he said if she'd have been Hattie right would have been under the ministry of Oral Roberts or the ministry of T.L Osborne she'd asked for a million dollars he said but because she was under the ministry of William Branham she asked for her two Souls to the two Souls of her sons and to think that where you are you're not asking for things that are going to pass away but you have this treasure and Earth and vessel and because you're under this ministry you can see exactly what William Branham taught us in Psalms 42 and 7 that a deep cause to the deep and to think that there if there was nothing there they wouldn't make no longing in your heart to draw onto this message and to draw closer to God but because there is a deep call to the Deep there's a deep to respond you can take it to the mess of this and they won't accept it you can take it to the Presbyterians or the Pentecostals down the road and they won't accept it because there's no deep there calling for it but on the inside of this body there's something calling on the inside of her to come up here a little bit closer to him it's a deep call into the deep there's something there's a new life there now brother William could probably I tested this just a little bit better than myself but how long you been married almost 17 years praise the Lord a long time living one woman in if you get the right one today just getting subscribe we love you but your watches hey they went through they went through their their courtship and they went through their engagement and went into the marriage she ate one way she's eaten one way and she's eating that way all the way through courtship she eats the same things all the way through her engagement Jesus same thing through her marriage and all of a sudden she wakes up into the middle of night and she's one watermelon in the middle of January or she's wanting peanut butter on some pickles there's something changed on the inside of her now whether he had a whether he had a pregnancy test to show it or not he recognizes that there's something that is calling that's calling for a craving and you recognize that that in the natural that a woman that a woman could go and she could call she could call for a lot of things that they man how in the world am I ever going to get a pineapple at two o'clock in the morning for this sister how in the world am I going to get that for her what is it it's something on the inside of her that is making her draw for that it's a life on the inside of it and to think that Mary back there when when Gabriel was speaking to her that she began to eat the Lord Jesus Christ's body right out of this Earth and watch what you begin to eat on you didn't just eat on some carry-on you begin to eat on Eagle anointing you begin to eat on the eagle manner you couldn't handle just some some dead carry on you had to have fresh Manna what is it it's showing you that there's life there's something on the inside and it's working on the outside it's calling I've got to have more I gotta have more I've gotta have more it's showing us a life that is calling for it foreign the Holy Ghost is yours the lamb has declared that you're his the land of the Holy Ghost is yours the land of healing is yours the land of Miracles is yours the lands of signs and wonders are yours the land of a right mind is yours the land of perfect healing is yours the title deed of redemption says it's yours you're anointed to accept it laughs I think that you're anointed by accepting what Eve turned out she turned down perfect peace she turned down a perfect Eden she turned down the word she turned down Supreme control she turned down rights to the tree of life she turned down walking and fellowshipping with the father in the cool of the Eden in the cool of the evening to think that she turned us down she turned down Adam being able to speak to creation and creation listen to it she turned down turned down spiritual multiplication she turned down all of these things but you're anointed by accepting what Eve turned out that means you have the power to call creation under its control by the master of the Wind now watch I want to change change gears just for a moment let me let me just drop this right here there's a lot of people and I'm going to read this quote but I want to preface it with this there's a lot of people that don't understand shouts there's a lot of people that don't understand there's a lot of people that don't understand dancing in the spirit there's a lot of people that don't understand they don't understand speaking in tongues or prophesying they don't understand that but I want to teach you that that is the blessings of the Lord now now it isn't necessarily anointing but it is the blessings of the Lord you think that the reason the reason why the children of God are moving where they're moving is is because there's anointing there and they're shouting the way they're shouting is because the anointing has came now a lot of people mix that up and I'm going to read this to you so you understand what I'm saying is there's a lot of people that think that that is when the anointing is there the anointing had already struck and then the blessings came behind it as I already told you there was a healing angel that stood here that stood right here at the platform and that same healing Angel is here this morning and he and he's still healing and he's still moving there is an anointing that is here but watch what brother random and I know it's just a little bit lengthy but I want to I want to lay these things to you but he said now he said he said it struck another woman he's Discerning the hearts and the thoughts of the children and you can go and listen to any tape that you want to and you're going to find you're going to find some of these things he said it struck another woman he said I want anybody that wants to look here look at the woman weeping look at the other woman sitting there normal look at the other woman next to her weeping she had heart trouble the little lady sitting right to her looking at me with your yes that's right you had heart trouble didn't you it's gone from you your faith struck fire with God and you touched him oh that's wonderful see that little lady sitting right there with her head down Praying great-headed Woman stranger to me setting here yes you turned around and looked at her she's got gallbladder trouble she's been praying for God to take it away from her and you was praying then Lord let him call me that's right if that's right raise up your hand how did I know your prayer it's gone from you your faith has healed you go home and be well do you believe if thou can't believe all things are possible but you have to believe still moves in that District of that setting in there right there second from the end high blood pressure If you believe with all your heart sister it's over do you believe God take him at his word all right raise up your hand that's what you was praying for Lord let him call me next with this high blood pressure I'm a stranger to you if that's right wave your hand all right it's gone from you go home and be well he said you see what it is it's faith the anointing's there but it's the children's faith that brings the miracle from Hathaway he said if you can believe it do you believe it he said you see those people out there no prayer cards or nothing he said are you ready to believe is that the way the Lord Jesus did when he was here on Earth he said here is this one man come all right you don't know you don't know what that does to you all to the Branham Tabernacle he said now just look at here on the top of my hand he said you know I don't get like that what is it it's the spirit of the lord it's anointing he said but many people don't understand what anointing means he said they think it means to shout he said that's Joy he said but power comes solemn that's the joy of the Lord he said this what he was doing what he was Discerning of people's heart he said this is the power of the lord it's healing and making whale and why are people so tossed about he said some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is he said did you ever think of that he said when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing he said the greatest anointing that there ever was to give anyone was Jesus Christ he said we have the same Spirit by measure he had it without Messer and he said one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read and said the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he's anointed me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick to give sight to the Blind and now we want to think if such an anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing upon him the full blessing of the anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building and scream and hung her but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down precious words and proceeded from his mouth that's what he's done under the anointing the anointing is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how and that's what's here you watch you watch these people that are moving under the anointing now I know the devil thinks I Don't Dance myself in the corner but the reason why you're dancing and the reason why there's joy is because there's a shout there's an anointing that has caused the shout these people ain't shouting and these people ain't dancing because they've lost their mind they've found their anointing they anointed set them free they anoint and made them who they are in Christ the anointing is supreme power in control the anointing a supreme power not out of control but in control let me give you an example the maniac in Portland it had been in a natural brother Bynum brother Bynum was a boxer and they never lost he never lost one one boxing match I'll tell y'all something when I was in seventh grade they asked us who was the greatest boxer of all time they was looking for Muhammad Ali and I wrote down William Bradham a message from my head and all the way to my toes he lost the battle surely surely in his flesh I can handle this but this man had done beat up preachers in a dumb brother them broke up that broke up meetings time and time again what was it it was a devil that was anointing that man to break up services and cause a distraction in the middle of the service and that man was standing there and he said he's going to break every bone named William branham's body but William Branham what did he do he said tonight you will fall over my feet he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over who's going to fall over who and he come at him and brother random said come out of the man Satan and he fell on William bradham's feet pinned his feet to the floor it was a worship of that demon that was causing that man to act that way William Branham said could you roll him off of my feet he said as I was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for he said that chief of tribe of demons had challenged the spirit of the Living God and he lost the challenge and there was Miracle after Miracle people getting out of wheelchairs because the anointing was in Supreme control telling you that that anointing is here and it's in control of a body it's time you control the storms control cancer control the atmosphere make known for your request unto the Lord ask and you shall be given knocking it shall be opened unto you I got a testimony this morning brother Andy have a brother brother Ronnie long that's preached here he was out in Oklahoma last week and there was a sister there was a sister that had been diagnosed with breast cancer brother Ronnie prayed for her she went through all kinds of immunotherapy and all kinds of ordeals of treatments and those sayings and she said when I first got diagnosed with that she said I said I said this who does Satan think he's messing with she said I didn't go forth asking I went forth confessing my healing and she said when when brother Ronnie was there and he prayed for me she said I just believed it I went home and turned on a tape I believe the tape was expectations that she was listening to and William Brandon was Discerning a person's heart and said you've got a tumor but the tumor is gone now and she fell where that tumor was and it was completely gone I'm telling you that there was an anointing in this message to drive out cancer drive out every disease and there is an anointing not just for the flesh but there's an anointing for the soul to take you right into the coming of the Lord make you live right make you talk right make you act right and one of these mornings you're going to change because the anointing foreign tell him control the atmospheres telling him that was there had his back turned to the tent it was Elohim that was there to platform would speak this to us and they would say he said now he said if that angel came from heaven and stood behind this Pulpit he said or stood right here he said which one has more power now think if an angel from heaven that knows no sin that knows no sickness that knows no troubles if he'd come all the way from heaven and he would stand right here he said which one would have more power that angel or the angel behind the pulpit come on somebody I'm preaching to you this morning to think that William Beckham said he said it's the angel behind the pulpit that's got more power that's got more anointing to think that angel ain't got no clue about Sin but I'm standing here and I am a sinner saved by the grace of God I know what it's like to be redeemed I know what it's like to watch healing come I know what it's like to watch Deliverance come and I'm standing here under the authority of this office and I'm commanding sickness take your leave [Applause] do you accept your healing this morning you're anointed to do it do you accept your deliverance your anointed to do it do you accept your salvation do you accept your bondage be broke off of your life except your healing except your deliverance accept your breakthrough your anointed to do it your anointed that say it's mine your anointed to live this life and you're anointed for Rapture you're going to make it you're gonna make it and Satan can do everything he wants to he will not stop the little bride of Jesus Christ you're going to make it you're going to break through you're going to overcome you're going to live a real life and be a real man you're going to be real sons and daughters of God you're going to make it you're gonna make it [Applause] cancer can't whip grunt Spencer cancer can't whip brand to hickle cancer can't beat Erica Parker teacher can't be Joe Shipley Cancer's got no hold on the Bride of Jesus Christ Our Prophet stood there and they condemned cancer and it condemned every devil in hell and every devil in hell knows that this message is right but you're anointed by accepting it as the truth [Applause] there's an angel got in the car of me and you and sister Whitney it was an angel got in that car last year he told you your will be fixed and he came and he gave you exactly what he spoke ain't that the truth and he said just because so this will be a sign that is coming yo David you'll get the biggest buck of your lifetime ain't that right and last year the week we went hunting they're well cleared up and David Breeden killed the biggest buck of his life God cares about all things that same anointing was here and said Ron Spencer won't go by the way of the Grave he'll go with you in the Rapture I accept the anointing of the Holy Ghost I accept it as thus saith the Lord I accept the anointing of almighty God we're going to make it we're going to press a battle and we're gonna win ask [Applause] there's an angel here no man can teach you these things there's no man who can tell you this he sings the angel knows how to operate into Supreme control and you might think the things that have been spoken and the things have been prophesied are way too hard let me tell you ain't nothing too hard for our God I'm not scared of one prodigal being left behind I'm not scared of one sick person being left here not healed I'm not scared about what the devil can whisper in our ears that we won't that we won't make it but the Bible said that we would be there with our Offspring also and you are their offspring and they will be there I'm speaking to you according to the word that you are the final runners you're anointed to run your anointed to finish there was a whole gang of Believers that went on before us but you're going to run their last Mile and you ain't just going to barely make it they're going to run all the way home [Applause] be the god of Elijah where be the god of Elijah I'd be like that sooner my woman I Got a Boy down here at sick do you know about my Ministry no Annie I don't know honey don't know nothing about that Ministry but I believe that Jesus is coming by my way if you could do it for a little girl in Memphis if you could do it for a blind girl the heck cataracts on her ass what about you this morning what about your problem God and Shook Up you are his lesser lights reflecting his power reflecting his word reflecting his truth and that same one that turned on the light is here I tell you my house then a day gone by my girls ain't got every light in the house on every man can attest to what I'm saying right here you go through your house and click the lights off before you leave amen it's just a flick of a button now if I'm the man that goes through there and turns it off I'm the man that could go in there and turn it on and Satan's tried to come in and turn your light off in your life but there's a man to come by barely making it barely get by struggling you don't don't think I'm off basis right here you watch what William Branham does in the in the in the seals you watch as he comes down through every seal he said now my revelation of this is watch what the angel was teaching him he takes him down through her he said my revelation of this seal is go listen just type it in you'll find it but it comes to the southern seal and he said my revelation of the seventh seal is and he goes on talking about his ministry do you mean to tell me that Malachi 4's Ministry has a part of the seventh seal amen to think that this is a time when struggling is over that this is a time where this is a time when that when's talents when the Silence has gone forth that the time is at hand that strugglings are coming to an end that troubles are coming to an end and you're sitting here enter the breaking of the seventh seal and you're under the greatest ministry that's ever been pronounced throughout the worlds it's across the world and you're under this anointing a Malachi 4 and to think that you're going to make it you're gonna win if I was you I'd just start praising the Lord for your healing I'd start praising the Lord for your breakthrough I'd start praising the Lord I'm gonna make it I'm going to win I'm going in a Rapture I'm going to have a testimony let the musicians come we are accepting the impossible as possible we're accepting there's an Angel that's going to watch over us we're accepting just save the Lord anointed by accepting what Eve turned down just go read the rest of the quote he said she will be a token to the world that she is not like Eve in the beginning that Eve fell in the beginning but this Eve is predestinated and ordained not to fail I know some of you got some bad days I know some of you get under under some mighty heavy things start quoting the word to it you're never going to whip the devil with your own tongue you're going to have to start putting thus save the Lord on your mouth and there's some battles you're going to face here that you can't
