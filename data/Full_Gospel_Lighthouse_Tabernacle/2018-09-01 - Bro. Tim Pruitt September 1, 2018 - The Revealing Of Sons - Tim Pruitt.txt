========================================

god bless you all such a wonderful honor to be able to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ i certainly hate that we have to greet you in this manner knowing that our all of our hearts desires to be in the house of god as we know that the bible tells us to forsake not the assembling of ourselves as we see the day approaching knowing that we can't assemble ourselves in that manner it certainly breaks our heart but knowing that we're facing unprecedented times like never before facing a sickness called covet that we know that is just a fancy name for a demon and many have been affected and been sick by this by this sickness and many have been in the hospital many have tested positive and different things felt different effects because of this sickness been in quarantine and we have certainly been praying for every one of you and whether you you're sick whether you've been in quarantine or not we've been praying for you that it would not come nigh thou dwelling even our pastor brother ron has tested positive this past week for covet the doctors determined that brother ron had coveted pneumonia and so we want to be in much prayer for brother ron sister connie as well by the time you're hearing this it's been about 12 days that she's been sick been a been affected by it and very worn out and weak as many others that i've prayed with over the phone and spoke with that have been sick and we're certainly praying for every individual every home that god would come and minister to your lives like never before just because you tested positive because of covet does not mean that you lost the faith does not mean that that you don't have the token or the holy ghost it just proves that you're human and because of adam's fall in the garden this is why you get sick now time may terry and we may be here another 10 years you'll overcome this and you may get sick again i'm sure of it but we're going to a land that will never get sick and we'll never have sorrow never cry never be in pain that's what we're pressing forward to we don't want to speculate or spend time wasting our energies thinking about where we contacted this sickness from or contacted this covet from whether it was due to colleges moving back in or or whether it was work or vice versa that doesn't matter what matters is that that this sickness came from him and as sons and daughters of god we bind this enemy in the name of jesus christ and we tell it to take its hands off of god's property we were redeemed by the blood of the lamb and cancer covet whatever the sickness you're facing is cannot be held and cannot hold you any longer in the name of jesus christ i speak those things over you we have been robbed of many of things in this past year many evangelists that couldn't come through many meetings that were canceled even our past labor day meetings this past weekend were cancelled our hearts were hurting in such a way knowing that the ministers that we had coming were preparing and been praying about things what they would speak to us but we had to cancel due to covet 19. we've been robbed of a lot of things and that's that's why we've presented these past labor day meetings to you in this way is to present meetings that have that have changed lives that have spoke volumes to our heart transformed our thinking our souls and stirred us in in faith like ever before tonight we'll be playing the service revealing of sons by brother tim pruitt that spoke to us that service at our labor day in 2018 and that service was such a powerful service the pillar of fire was seen positions were seen in their lives and spiritual amnesia was thrown away and they sons came to themselves what an awesome service this will be for you to go back and listen to i have went back and listened to it many times and i have prayed much about the services that we would play to you during this time brother ron and myself we consulted and prayed about these things that we would pray and that we would play to you and knowing we wanted the mind of god and i believe that we've tapped into a channel so tonight as you listen know that the pillar of fire that was visible in 2018 in these services can be visible in your home whether you see him whether you don't he said that he'd be there if you gather in his name he'll be there and we agree together as a body of believers that we will be affected by these services though these services may be pre-recorded the god that we serve and the god that we preach is not a pre-recorded god he's a god that is always the same he never changes and is not affected by what men do or what they say but there is a god that is fighting for you in the midst of all of this he's fighting your battles i'd like to share a few quotes uh brother brother branham spoke on these things uh that i found this evening i'd like to share some of these things with you we also find in hebrews 12th chapter and 24th verse that the new testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it amen and amen amen sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the old testament the blood spoke of guilt in new testament it speaks of redemption in the old testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the new testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven hallelujah and that same blood that was shed upon the ground that called out after his dead brother or called out after his brother that had killed him the blood of jesus christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks omaha we must believe for ourself like they did down there in egypt and also for the house like they did in egypt and jericho and so forth we find out in acts 16 and 31 where that the roman centurion was to take his own life and was going to stab himself to death and paul told him to believe on the lord jesus and i and thy house shall be saved church this is a time not to be controlled by fear no worry nor doubt it is a time to be controlled by faith and if we allow fear to control our thinking control well are we going to get sick or where we're not going to get sick if we allow fear to control us our faith will never operate sons and daughters of god do not operate on fear they operate on faith the bible tells us in hebrews 11 and 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen we cannot see it but brother branham told us that there is a perfect body that is standing in front of us we walk right into that body because we know that the bible tells us that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed we as a bride are facing a giant he may stare us down he may be as ugly as sin may have snot hanging down from his nose and a big old ugly unibrow teeth missing a great big loud voice just like goliath you remember that he's nothing but a bluff and all that he shoots at us as believers is lies but we as believers will take this giant down as david took down goliath no matter what comes remember he's the high priest of our confession and we didn't get to choose this battle but we get to choose our weapon we'll take the sword of the spirit and the shield of faith faith destroys the fiery darts we don't have to accept what he shoots at us we are made of faith and we are born to believe for the impossible we are believers and believing is what we do the enemy has thrown many grenades at us and we just keep crawling right over top of the pile of grenades and we come out winning every time you see the enemy is such a stupid devil that he forgot to pull the pen and if he did pull the pen it would blow up in his own face know this church there's no weapon that is formed against us that shall prosper that if god before us who can be against us god bless you as you listen to the service may your hearts be blessed and stirred god bless you keep the faith amen across the stage with me sister bethany can you bring brother drew amen hallelujah hallelujah to god be the glory for the things which he has done now you can be seated just a moment wasn't that a presidential wave amen could he stay here just a moment with me you stay close to us so that night drew and i walked across the platform and i began to speak to them this predestinated moment and i think tonight is a predestinated moment [Applause] and i said as we we walked across the platform backwards and forwards tonight we're going to have a prayer line and where this little boy is walking god supernaturally touched him and tonight there's going to be miracle after miracle happen in this building that night a precious little girl that had a al i hope i said that right to which she was losing her hair and she was going bald and her hair was leaving and there's no reverse to it i can imagine what that does to to your your psyche and your emotions but that night months before brother tim had felt led to pray for her and that night she walked into that prayer line with three bobby pins and she had a sock hat on that night i'd like to introduce you to mariah sister mariah would you come to god be the glory hallelujah hallelujah you see a woman's glory is her hair and satan had tried to destroy it but god restored her glory hallelujah now you can be seated again as a prayer line went forward there were many miracles that happened and we believed in this he's the god that does it and he's the god that's among us about three quarters the way through the prayer line they they carried me away and i fell into the arms of brother tim winters and they carried me and brother aaron oglesby drove us back to the to the cabin to which they had and they took me in and as they took me in into the cabin and brother aaron and brother andrew

little boy but last august sister sister whitney and brother davey who was cry he was crushed in an accident the year before his hips were crushed his arm shoulders was crushed his ribs were crushed his back bone was crushed his leg was crushed and god 100 restored him and whitney that could not have a baby and they said it wouldn't she it just couldn't happen because of certain physical characteristics that she could not have a baby in that prayer line god spoke said she's going to have a baby [Applause] brother jonathan dameron and sister autumn was next in the prayer line and it was impossible for them and god not only touched sister whitney but sister autumn and brother jonathan and they have a brand new baby in the vision i saw him walking across the lawn and i could only

already eight o'clock here tonight but that time doesn't mean nothing to those that are in eternity amen so we'll try to though um remember those of you that are not amen hallelujah thank you jesus amen praise the lord god is good to us isn't he i love him with all my heart tonight the scripture would say as you find in daniel chapter 12 verse 1 he would tell you in chapter 11 just a little phrase i'm going to quote to you but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits verse 2 1 of chapter 12 and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time that people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever but thou o daniels shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and we'll drop down to verse eight and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end and many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand god bless you can be seated i'm going to speak to you tonight on the revealing of sons we're living in a wonderful hour it's one of the greatest hours that there's ever been on the face of the earth as god winds up end-time events and it's promised in the end time that there is to come an understanding a people that know their god in daniel's prophecy we see michael stands up he sees that at that time there's an understanding that comes something that happens to cause the elect those whose names are written in the book to believe john also in the book of revelation when you look at the end of the new testament there in that wonderful book of symbols the book of revelation um is very it's very similar as to what is seen in the book of daniel and daniel and john sees the archangels stand up and when he comes to understanding that um and when this angel stands up there comes an understanding that has been sealed from other generations you know daniel is the book of revelation to the jewish people as it's full of symbology as to what god will do for the jews and it's important though that we understand when we look at this that we you know there is um not just one seed of abraham there's a physical seed and then there is a royal seed and we are the royal seed of abraham by the new birth so the book of daniel shows the angel coming to the jews and the book of revelation shows the archangel coming to the gentiles and we are living in a time of great scriptural fulfillment god is moving in a very uh particular way where he is fulfilling the end time prophecies and we should be under a tremendous expectation because this is a time where there is great things that are happening this is a time of actually action that where heaven is moving in a way that other ages have never been privileged to see there can you know as as god works uh sometimes in his mysterious ways that there can actually be years and years and years sometimes of silence and then there will be a time of fulfillment and you are a blessed people in that that you are living in a time or season of fulfillment where god is actually acting doing some spectacular extraordinary things where heaven is pouring out on our behalf as he finishes the um the the pouring out of his spirit upon the gentile ages something that began back on the day of pentecost where he said in the last days that's the last 2 000 years days i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and we are here in the day where he is finishing the pouring out the completely emptying out of his holy spirit right here in this last in the age and this is as i said is not a time where god is silent but where god is bringing an understanding revealing things to this generation as it wraps up the gentile dispensation and gets ready to take a pride in the rapture it's a great time where scripture that has been held in darkness for years and years and years now has come to light so we'll look in revelation chapter 10 and verse 1 we'll see a parallel to the book of daniel and and we see in revelation 10 and 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was up on his head you see this is symbolic of his covenant as god reveals himself in his seven colors of the rainbow as as you know god does this uses that number seven in symbology in the scripture especially in the book of revelation and we would see the seven ages and seven horns on the lamb and seven eyes on the horns and seven stripes of blood and all of these all these things you know that god um expresses himself as as he descends from heaven with as a mighty angel clothed with a cloud and a rainbow is up on his head what an hour this is his face as as it were the sun the full countenance of the word of god the full illumination not a partial illumination but the full the fullness of his of his revelation coming forth the enlightenment of god's word and and his power of his strength to this generation this parallel was also the book of zechariah who would say you know after a dark and a dismal day after a time where um not much light has been that there will come a time that in the evening time it shall be light because the light would shine on parts of the word even that has never shown on before because god is bringing an understanding to the people of this generation amen and you're a blessed people because for you are as in the days of jesus when he said i speak to them in parables but to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom for i say you are blessed you know your eyes have seen and your ears have heard what other generations was not able to see what prophets and wise men and seers were not able to see and yet god has imparted an understanding to the people of this last day i mean there were things that was once dark mystery that was just rich in symbology but that other ages walked in partial lights and gloomy days but as he said but it shall be light in the evening time and we're here in the time of that fulfillment of a day of an hour of a time where light has come in a generation to bring and illuminate the word hallelujah to make it plain before us so that we there would be no mistake so that we would have an understanding of the day and our visitation [Applause] hallelujah and the bible said and his feet were as pillars of fire hallelujah his feet is pillar of fire where his feet is upon the earth his feet is as pillars of fire because that's his body that's his believers where he touches the earth with the blessed holy spirit where the pillar of fire that same pillar of fire that was seen in the old testament that came on the day of pentecost that divided itself and then came individually upon the 120 in the upper room and then filled 3 000 souls afterwards and on and on and on and on and on hallelujah what was it you it is god in his church a triumphant church an overcoming church hallelujah one with feet that is upon the earth amount there is that powers are that the powers of that's in the sea and the powers of the earth is held under the dominion of a body a body of believers hallelujah saying that all things were under his feet and the clothes are under his feet and you are his body that means they are under your feet [Applause] hallelujah i'm speaking tonight to an invincible army i'm talking to a people in this generation that have been called for a purpose and for a reason to stand here in this last day a people with understanding so when a god is in his body and he will be here in the end time with his feet on the ground hallelujah but he's going to do it through a bride body an invincible army because as a precursor to his corporal coming he comes first in bride form before we can meet him in the air where two sons of god are revealed and manifested in the last day because all creation has been groaning and travailing unto this day waiting for you to get here and you are here [Applause] i'm talking about sons of god to be manifested and you are here [Applause] hallelujah now is your hour now is your season now is your time and you are now the actor on the scene others may have been the actor on the scene in their day and their time but i want you to know you are the one called in this day amen you're to be the overcomer you are to be the daniel you are to be the abraham you are to be the jacob you are to be the joseph and let me just say you are to be the jesus manifested in bright form this is a glorious day and you have been called to be an integrable part of this day god can't do it without you because you're his feet you are where he has the boots on the ground hallelujah i mean 2 000 years ago he overcame to the body of the man of galilee but he's using your body tonight amen to overcome sin to overcome the darkness of this world to stand in this evil generation hallelujah amen he had in his hand a little book that was open and he said as you see it was previously closed in revelation 5 but now it is open aren't you glad tonight that we can say we are preaching from an open book we're no longer preaching from a closed book and trying to pry into it and guess what is in the contents but because god has opened the book he has brought an understanding in the last day [Applause] amen so there there he is his he's conquering remember who he is conquering through as i said he's already overcoming the man of galilee as a man of galilee he defeated devils amen but this time he's going to defeat the devil using your body i'm looking tonight at a bunch of devil defeaters a bunch of serpent bruisers come on church that seed of the woman that was seen and prophesied from generations back in the days of of adam where he said i'm gonna send a seed and that seed is gonna be a serpent bruiser i'll bruise the head of that serpent and i'll tell you you're not generations or offsprings of vipers but you are generation an offspring of almighty god that just as he was a serpent bruiser you have been called to be a serpent bruiser in your generation hallelujah the same glory that was in jesus is to be manifested in a people in the last day and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared it's a prophetic ministry and when he cried or shouted seven thunders uttered their voices these thunders are the voice of god but in john's day it wasn't to be understood yet amen you know john was a little different from daniel you see daniel heard it and didn't understand it john heard it and was going to write it and couldn't write the understanding it wasn't for them it was reserved for you to give you an understanding in the last day so you would know your position in the word and you would know the authority to which you have been called to hallelujah glory to god and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea upon the earth and lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer i won't i won't delay the holding back of this to another generation now is the time to impart an understanding hallelujah why so that people that know their god can do x-voice are you with me now amen notice it tells you there comes an end to silences you know john john was going to write he said don't you write it set up don't you write it amen but they don't finish there but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets are you with me now amen notice notice this will look at the next verse and the voice which i heard from heaven spake with me again you know a lot of people stop at verse seven [Applause] amen that's a good revelation to understand god sent us a forerunner amen that's a good under a revelation to understand there was a message in this last day come on amen but look at the next verse and the next verse said in the voice listen it it continues it continues past it doesn't end with the seventh angel it continues past and continues on and i heard the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again notice he's not finished he doesn't finish it all he didn't wind it all up with the seventh angel he continues on after the seventh angel finishes sounding his message and he said go and take the little book which is open you know you don't have to open it hey man none of us have to go and and walk into that pillar of fire and get the revelation of the seven thunders it's already been done the mysteries have been revealed hallelujah but you've got a job to do and that is you go to the angel and you say give me the book and then he said and eat the book there's some there's some exact instructions amen it is to be eaten it will be digested come on now go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book i wonder tonight if there would be somebody in this building amanda would say give me give me that little book get me that person give me that word let me have it i want what you've got to offer god if you're given something in this generation i want it i've got a heart ready to receive it give me the little book hallelujah and he said and i'll take it and eat it up it'll make that belly bitter and it shall make but shall be in that mouth sweetest honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i ate it my belly was bitter you see the word causes a war within your inner being [Music] [Applause] throwing out unbelief throwing out doubt throwing out the fears throwing out traditions of man come on now amen and so is the message god gives us in the last day causes a struggle within you but i got some news for you somebody's gonna keep it down i've seen a lot of people in this day speeded up but i'm one of those that's gonna keep it down i ain't giving up on what god gave me i've ate this word and i'm keeping it down i don't care how big my belly gets bitter i don't care about the struggle within me but i'm keeping that word down i'm not picking it up hallelujah somebody's going to eat it and digest it until it becomes a word a word out of their life [Applause] because there he says thou must prophesy again you see when if you keep it down it's going to come up as a word out of your life thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings they that know their god shall be strong and do exploits it's the time for the bride's prophecy amen to prophesy again amen it was prophesied to the seventh angel we're not adding to it we're not taken away from it we don't need to embellish it amen you don't need me to bring clarity to it amen god said it the way he wanted and he wanted it the way he said it and i'm satisfied with it all i'm going to do is eat it digest it let it become a life in me and speak it that's my promise that's my word [Applause] amen and when your word becomes the same as god's word i'll tell you what all hell has to give way to the name of jesus christ [Applause] these words of the prophet daniel were spoke of the people of israel it's a promise left to them however the scripture is not only to the natural seed of abraham but it's also to the royal seed amen you are living in a blessed hour amen it's a time of michael standing up daniel 12 parallels revelation chapter 10 the scene just varies a bit and so is different because daniel's prophecy is to a natural israel and their promised restoration where they are gathered in their land but there's also a spiritual israel the royal seed of abraham who are also been restored back to their land amen who are in the homeland of the word of god tonight revelation chapter 5 also shows us the lamb standing up to take in the book to remove its seals you see the scripture um you know is is manifesting itself even as we speak you see just just as the resurrected christ appeared on the road to emmaus even so the the resurrected christ is appearing to his people here in the last day amen where he walked with his disciples after the resurrection he was bringing them an awakening of the meaning of the scriptures you see he in that emmaus walk he would actually open up the scriptures to them and point out to him it was written in isaiah it was written in jeremiah it was written in the psalms concerning me is that right because the reason why he was having to bring this understanding was because though he had walked with him for three and a half years that that they were being blinded because there was a terrible blinding coming upon israel the jews at that time are you with me amen so they they were not even the disciples close by jesus was not even seeing the purpose of jesus christ and this was the reason of their delusion amen because because and the discouragement they had you know that that they were going through then and if you notice when and he had given them specific instructions you go and meet me or go to go to a certain place and i'm going to meet with you and carry in jerusalem and wait there until there's power endued from on high but instead these these men are so disillusioned they're walking the opposite direction they're going down to emmaus but i want you to understand these were predestinated seed and god wasn't going to lose of one of them amen so they're going the wrong direction so he just goes and starts walking with them and begins to open the scripture to them to open their understanding to what was happening in their day in their hour oh may he walk with us tonight may you walk down these aisles tonight may come right down to your seat tonight amen and open your understanding to the day the hour that you are living in that you'll know what your message is what your purpose is amen because our purpose is more than just to come into a nice little building in a nice little church and have something as nice as we did and the baptist methodists are pentecostal or maybe even a little nicer than we had back there our purpose is more than that it's more than just a church membership it's more than being a pretty good christian it's more than being a denominational minded individual there that in and out and up and down and has no passion amen but i'll tell you when he revealed himself to them he they had a passion to get back there to jerusalem to tell the rest of them and he appeared to me he came to me he turned my life around amen he came to me he revealed himself in a particular way he opened up the scripture when our eyes were open we knew him i seek god open our eyes with the blinding that's going on in laodicea opening our eyes should we feeling of christ no matter what you what direction you're headed that resurrected christ is is there to reveal himself to you to get you turned back around amen to bring you back to the promise to bring you to the realization of the scripture that is being fulfilled in this hour now once again it must be fulfilled even as jesus would say to them that in all things then all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law and the prophets and the psalms concerning me and i want you to understand he brings it right now down to this hour to this day and he says it all things must be fulfilled amen all things of the old and the new testament must be fulfilled which were written amen in all the scripture concerning the bride in this end time hallelujah and then the bible said he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures hallelujah an understanding came that wiped away the blindness of the age hallelujah you see jesus he he was not affected by the blinding of the age but he would look into the scripture and he would see himself as jonah was in the belly of the well he would look back to abraham and he would say um and see himself there and he would say before abraham was i am he would look and see himself in solomon and say but a greater than solomon is here amen he relied on the scripture to tell him his day his hour his moment because the scripture must be fulfilled amen if i can get something to you tonight the scripture in this day must be fulfilled hallelujah and he opened their understanding that they might understand the scripture oh god strike our hearts tonight with that understanding that comes to your heart that gives you a passion for god a passion for truth daniel wanted to know but it was not time to know john wanted to write it and it wasn't time for it to be written and daniel would say oh my lord what shall be the end of these things but there comes an end to the lack of knowledge and he said go thy way daniel come on now for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end there comes a time where understanding comes and this understanding comes so that it can manifest all the scripture that has been written of sons of god hallelujah now he says here go thy way daniel verse 9 for the for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end but many shall be purified and made white and fried but the wicked shall be shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand i'm glad he didn't stop there but he said but the wise shall understand [Applause] amen oh i want to be purified i want to be made white amen but i also want an understanding i want to understand my day my hour my visitation amen god does some extraordinary things to get you to believe get you to recognize your day an hour he does extraordinary things to get you to start having faith you know he wondered himself as he had mused and looked so far ahead and he says i wonder when the son of man cometh will i find faith on the earth is that right amen he was looking down and was wondering if there would be faith and actually friends he can look ahead and see there wouldn't be any faith we're in a faithless age in a faithless generation in a faithless society even among faithless churches that call the name of jesus christ amen and we were all in that kind of condition but god was so determined that he would have a pride he would send elijah the prophet to turn the heart to faith again amen so he saw that there would be a need to send some extraordinary things to turn your heart from unbelief to faith amen because he said if i don't send elijah i'll have to just wipe the whole thing off with a curse hallelujah amen now in the days of sarah sarah you know she was she was in years of unbelief not just days years you know maybe she started off with a hope you know and then every year it passes and you know she sees the barren woman and you know and despair gets worse every year then she reaches a certain age and she gives up it ain't for me i can never do it i'll never have this child i'm past child baron amen the god would allow her to get way past child parent so he could show that this was not a child of man but this was the seed of god predestinated to come forth [Applause] hallelujah amen and god would do some extraordinary things to start getting her heart to believe she was if you even listen to brother branham about it he would talk about sarah and even her attitude she had a rotten attitude she was so full of unbelief it ain't for me and you know and he said that day when the angel comes she was no in no mood to even receive it maybe that's the way you are tonight you're just not in any mood i've heard of a god and i heard he can do and he's done it for this but i ain't in any kind of humor to receive it for myself but god is a god that will not allow his seed to sit there and unbelieve in a faithless situation he'll do extraordinary things to cause them to start believing hallelujah amen god would actually pull from the elements create himself a body a man you stumble about squirrels god created himself a body pull the elements out of the earth and pull them all together and step right down into it and god begin to walk down among abraham and sarah because god was determined that this little woman who was a part of the promise would not remain in unbelief oh if god was that determined for sarah how much more is he determined for his pride in this last day i will not leave her sitting in unbelief i'll do extreme things amount i'll do extraordinary things but i will get sarah to start believing hallelujah you ought to know tonight god ain't gonna leave you sitting in a lukewarm complacent condition amen god's going to do the extraordinary i'm looking for extraordinary things in this service tonight [Applause] amen god using some extreme measures a man she'd sat for years and years an unbelief but it would take an awakening of her faith amen amen that's what we're saying now you see it isn't that the faith isn't there amen there needs to be an awakening faith has gone dormant even today in too many souls we have allowed the confusion of the age to crowd out the voice of god and it isn't that the faith isn't there it is that faith needs an awakening to realize that you are the generation you are the people chosen you are the one that he said would be delivered everyone whose names are in the book is your name in the book well he's destined you for deliverance and he ain't gonna leave you sitting down in unbelief and darkness and lukewarmness in a backslidden condition this god will go to extraordinary measures to reach right down to where you are [Music] [Applause] god would do extreme things he would take on flesh so he could change an old grandma 90 years old and change her and make her so beautiful in so much that a king would want to marry her that's pretty extreme hallelujah amen you think about sarah i'm thinking about another old woman who's been barren for 2 000 years and she's been decrepit in unbelief walking around on an old cane of doubts and fear but i'll tell you you have had an awakening faith has started coming in your heart and you begin to straighten up and you begin to realize i have been called out of the lord been chosen to bring forth the seed the life from the last days hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah i've got some good news tonight the church that was barren for 2 000 years is now pregnant it's beginning to show faith has come into heart and keeping your soul who she is in this last day [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] god said he would go to the extreme to get his people to believe he will have a pride and he will have her ready and he'll do extreme things to get her ready amen in the first exit is god went to extreme things amen to get to israel in her homeland this was necessary to get her from unbelief to faith to get her back to believing again satan ideas was so beat down and defeated in slavery until it would take extreme measures amen to give them faith to believe come on now amen it would actually take the word to have to create things to call for frogs lies amen he without he would actually the word would actually do things go out in creation that was way beyond the magic of the of the egyptians amen that was so extreme come on church god wanted his people to believe amen he had to give them a faith and meant to get up out of that old that old slave camp leave that old home of bondage leave that slave master behind and get here and follow this prophet in an exodus hallelujah amen in exodus from sin when jesus came had jesus only hung on the cross he would have just been one of those nameless jews that had died under the roman powers that's pretty common they did it for any reason for every reason but because god did extreme things there were angelic visitation that would even announce the forerunner's birth amen to make him make him a forerunner of his of his coming god would do something very extreme he would take an unmarried woman a virgin and bring forth a child in her womb having never known a man now that is pretty extreme amen this has never been duplicated god took a girl who had never known a man and that which was conceived of her was the holy ghost amen jesus jesus well in his ministry he took it even to a higher level of doing extreme things amen his miracles were extreme miracles i mean they think about it it was thousands and thousands of years of jewish history and perhaps never a blind eye open but jesus would take a man with no eyeballs and he would take and spit in the dirt and get that spindle of clay and roll it around in his hands and he would make an eyeball and would stick it in an empty socket amen and then take and spit again and he would take that and he would roll another eyeball and stick it in the other socket and then he would say now go and wash the excess out over in the pool of siloam and the man came back seeing he had eyeballs he could see hallelujah amen oh hallelujah god was doing some extreme things i can just imagine brother when jesus did this he reached down he says you know this reminds me when i made man in the beginning and when i created when i formed his body out of dust and i made and made out those sockets there with my thumb and i rolled out my balls of clay and i stuck it in there amen then i breathed upon it and said live [Applause] and the breath of life entered there but light came in the eyeballs in the ears and everything else the creator [Applause] we're standing there again doing some extreme things [Applause] creating eyeballs all over again hallelujah amen to get people to believe amen there he would heal the sick he would raise the dead he would let lies was not not just get sick and have a healing he would wait until he dies then he's buried for four days amen so there's no question and then he would say roll away the stone and call his name and a man who had been dead in the grave four days come out of there [Applause] hallelujah amen what was it god was doing extreme things he would do it until demons would actually beg him beg him not to torment them anymore amen toward the tormentors devils themselves crying out are you with me cry up don't don't don't torment me i want to get something to you friends i mean this is what he did in his body 2 000 years ago what is he wanting to do in his body tonight blessed are the people whose god is the lord [Applause] hallelujah amen even so god would do some extreme things in this last day amen i you know i don't have time to go in it tonight but i i think if you just look up some of the history of little david walker nine-year-old boy that he would call to the ministry he was just as a five-year-old boy he got he got um blindness in his eyes got an infections he went blind and um you know he at five years old he asked his daddy if he could fast he said i feel led to fast daddy and daddy said let me fast for you i see you're too young to do it and he said no i need to fast and this five-year-old boy began to fast he fasted for three days and after on the third day after he had given up and he was discouraged because that nothing had happened and he was still blind he had a he heard a voice that spoke out and above him and he said look up and he opened his eyes and he could see and this little five-year-old boy began to shout and speak in other languages nine years old he had a vision of heaven for five hours were transported there into heaven and then was told to preach everybody went to his dad and said daddy god called me to preach he said yeah son one day god will use you i'm sure you'll be used for the glory of god he said no i'm to preach now and a little nine-year-old little david walker you ever hear of him amen it's on the tapes brother branham talks about him preached with him come on amen and little david walker there has told his daddy well daddy you know i i've got to i've got to preach i've got to preach now and he said no son one day you'll preach but not now he said no the angel of god told me i had to go preach now said well son you're too young he said that's what i told the angel and the angel said no you got to go preach now and so the daddy said well son you'd make a fool out of me you know you you know i want to believe that angel talked to you and you were i know you were out for five hours and all this but you know you're only nine years old you ain't got no business preaching you've never preached in your life and i you know we we can't get you up in front of people and you preach and he said well i'll tell you what i'm not gonna eat another bite till i get the breach and he went on a hunger strike and for one day he he went two days and three days and finally his daddy runs in there with some food and said you're gonna eat today he said well am i gonna preach he said no but you're gonna eat he said no i'm not gonna eat he said okay okay okay i've got to make a deal with you you know i'll tell you little david we'll have a time and we'll let you preach i'll put a little ad in the newspaper and he put one about this big because he was afraid of you know people coming out and this little boy having nothing to say i'm talking about god doing extreme things amen and so he he would he he would he would then go and take uh and put that little ad in there and he said ah ain't nobody gonna come he said you know it's a little bitty ad and nobody will come and and they rented a little auditorium and he told the woman that it was written listen i've got i've made a deal with my boy and i've got to go through with it and really you know i don't think there'll be anybody here but we're going to have this meeting anyway tonight now the doors opened that night and the fire chief came and the mayor and pretty soon there was 700 people in the building [Applause] you know why because if god calls you to preach he's going to have somebody that'll listen amen and so he started you know that that um that particular night he he his dad uh you know they got up and sang some songs and whatever he said okay folks i don't know what little david's got for us tonight but come on little david and and and and speak and little david took a text opened his bible and began to open his mouth and some 30 minutes later the whole the holy spirit began to take him over some 30 minutes later the altars were full people repenting and calling out to god little david went from there into an international meetings he preached meetings with william branham for some services in california and florida and he and and he would say brother branham william branham's gift was unmatched nobody has ever been able to impersonate it said it was accurate time after time [Applause] amen so you see god would you do that to take a little boy like david walker to show it wasn't education you needed no it wasn't degrees from a seminary but it was god calling an anointing that's what was needed amen showing again that he would bring forth the capstone as as zechariah said and it wouldn't be by might and it wouldn't be mine by men's power but it would be by my spirit saith the lord and god would do that with a little boy to show an extreme measure because he was about to send a prophet on the scene with a seventh grade education and he was showing before he even came that god could take a little nine-year-old boy and make a preacher out of him that would win souls around the world because he's about ready to send a prophet uneducated untrained halting grammar to use him because god was doing extraordinary things [Applause] hallelujah i'm only one hour now into my two hour sermon hallelujah praise the lord 1933 and on the ohio river 85 years ago now there was a voice from heaven that said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ amen that was god's word amen he said i'm going to send a message to forerun to prepare the people for the second coming of christ you know it wasn't good enough for god to do that once god would do that again and again and again amen in 1946 these are these are now two prophecies 72 years ago through tongues interpretation there down in texas way down in their brother branham was in them in a meeting there and and someone jumped up a man jumped up and began to speak in tongues another man stood up and interpreted and he said as john the baptist was sent for on the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ amen these are not secret things they're right there you can read them for yourself and a man sent from god written by none other than that than the contemporaries of brother branham at that time gordon lindsay and jack moore they were testifying of what god was speaking hey man when brother branham heard those words he he stopped and and came out and said that man that spoke in tongues where are you from and he told him and said do you know this man here no i've never seen him before and he said you know but the holy spirit had fallen upon one with tongues and then the other interpretation and began to say the same thing that was set down at the river because god was wanting this generation to understand he was doing something spectacular amen he was sending a message to foreigners first of the second coming of christ amen then it would happen again would happen over in kansas again it would it actually would happen three different times in brother branham's meetings there but in the in the third incident i believe it was was anna schrader who was in kansas and stood up in the meeting there this is all the year 1946 and said ask john the baptist was sent for around the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun his second coming amen it would be it would be a jack coe that would say i i realize when i was there in the meeting and even if i can recall this you know the way that it was um i didn't look at my history tonight before i came but but jack cole was sitting there in unbelief he come there and he just he believed that brother branham was you know was a charlatan he wasn't really uh this wasn't real you know how it is he was skeptical amen and his brother and and there was a man there that without eyeballs in the meeting and and brother branham um prayed for him and said in three days you will be seen jack said anybody could say that you know the audience will never know the difference this man disappears and you know we won't know because in three days he'll be seen and brother branham on his way out of the tent that night he walks by him and he pats him on the leg and he said don't just keep their doubting you're going to have a ministry like this yourself you'll pray for the sick also well you know that in itself thrilled jack to hear that but he still was unconvinced and he waited around in the meeting till three days later here come that blind man with eyeballs in his head seed because even he was taking jack coe and making a believer out of him i mean t.l osborne added his voice to the others he said the first night i heard and saw brother branham minister i didn't hear a voice i didn't know it had been said of him and i didn't know that the voice from heaven had spoken these words i knew nothing of that i had not been with any of the other ministers that believed in him for most of those i was with did not believe in him but like a voice and yet not like a voice i heard it i know it it came to me as john the baptist was sent as a forerunner of his first coming william branham his son is a forerunner of his second coming amen you see once more god would take men who were called of god to preach in that era in time and reconfirm this time upon time again that god was doing something spectacular to prepare a people for his second coming i'm just going to say tonight we cannot afford to go to sleep [Applause] amen god has spoken particularly to your day to your hour to awaken your faith god doing some extreme things to let you know that you're in the very cycle the very hour you are in the very day of his coming how can you sit complacent how can you treat these moments as just another moment in time [Applause] i want to ask you tonight could god have made a mistake the god who time after time showed himself accurate with his word and how accurate his word could be could he have made a mistake could he could he could it be that the age would get so faithless and the time so evil and laodicea would get so bad even that the majority of the aides would put him outside his church and god would finally just have to give up on his divine plans and go back into the heavens and forget it all and just become an absentee creator of the earth is that possible amen could it be that god made a mistake saying that this was the forerunner of his second coming could it be that god misjudged that that there would be a mistake made or or maybe he would get off at the end or or he would go contrary to denominational thinking and all of a sudden god would have to say i changed my mind this man can't be my forerunner amen but but let me tell you tonight there is no mistake in the word god has sent a forerunner to prepare hearts for the coming of the lord and it must prepare your heart you must be one that opens your heart to it and say god prepare me we ought to be a church tonight to say god prepare this church as a church they may prepare this preacher this man of god for the coming of the lord hallelujah you see gordon lindsey and jack moore who witnessed it and were scribes of that day they would scream bible days are here again they saw it then i want to know has god changed any then bible days are still here we are in a living in a time of fulfillment of scripture and that makes bible days here again [Applause] what an opportunity you have tonight and why why why you could just wander your life away in a baptist tomb or methodist tomb or catholic tomb but god has given you a great opportunity amen for god to reveal himself to you for him to come where you were walking in the wrong direction where you were lost out in sin or you were steeped in the traditions of man and this god would let you alone this god went looking for you and said i gotta get them to a pentecost i've got to get them to an upper room i've got to get them to a place where they are filled with my spirit because if i can get them filled with the holy ghost they will believe i tell you why the reason of so much faithlessness in this day and hour is because people are lacking a new birth [Applause] the holy ghost will cause you to believe the word of god and say amen amen and agree to every word of god so that it can live out of your life they would say of william branham said the story of william branham is so out of this world and beyond the ordinary i'm i'm quoting from a man sent from god amen something that was wrote now 70 something years ago 70 72 or three years ago and that ought to be the testimony tonight the story of your life that it's so out of this world and beyond the ordinary come on god didn't call you to be an ordinary christian he called you to be a real born-again blood wasp a man son or daughter the living god to reveal himself in you and make something out of you than an ordinary christian [Applause] the life of william branham is so out of this world beyond the ordinary that where they're not available a host of infallible proofs which document and attest is authenticity one might be well excused for considering it far-fetched and incredible this is what they said this was 70 years ago come on amen but the facts are so generally known and of such a nature that they can be so easily verified by any sincere investigator that they must stand as a witness god's witness to his willingness and purpose to reveal himself again to men as he once did in the days of the prophets and apostles the story of this prophet's life for heals a prophet though we infrequently use the term indeed witnesses to the fact that bible days are here again it would be the full gospel businessman's voice in in february 1961 issue that said in bible days there were men of god who were prophets and seers but in all the sacred records none of these had a greater ministry than that of william branham a prophet and a seer of god whose photograph appears on the front cover of this issue of of the full gospel businessmen's voice branham has been used by god in the name of jesus to raise the dead hallelujah what was it god has done some extreme things some incredible things some unbelievable things unbelievable to most hearts but somehow there were some people here tonight that can believe it amen it has turned you to faith to believe in the god that did extreme things 2 000 years ago is here in this generation doing extreme things again to stir your heart back to faith and truth again amen jack moore would write this account and i know i knew jack moore is a boy been in his services sat in his church i was daring some of brother branham's meetings there but jack moore wrote to his account as he would scream out again bible days are here again and he would report of the first time william branham came to his church and he said surprise and bewilderment were among our mixed emotions that first sunday evening of brother branham's visit to us when we arrived early at our large frame tabernacle and found the bible the building so congested that we could hardly get in this had never happened before on the first night of any meeting but this was a branham meeting a steady stream of traffic had wound its way through arkansas hills and louisiana valleys that day reverently tracing the path of this 20th century prophet whose prayers would cause diseases to be accursed broken homes to be reunited drunken fathers to repent prodigal sons to return feuding churches to stack arms and make peace and lukewarm christians to be rekindled by the fire of their first love that's what the message did back then and that's what the message will do tonight hallelujah amen jack morris said it was bible days he said it was as if jesus of nazareth had passed our way amen and he said you know it's just like he said and we can almost go back and just close our eyes and say we're there again we're there again we're back on the dusty trails of galilee and faithful devotion to a lowly carpenter who claimed to be the messiah of israel and he said in our visionary procession we passed by the place of the tombs where from which erupted a naked demoniac screaming and hissing an objection to the presence of christ but then sat at his feet a moment later and clothed in his right mind amen we were among the joshua and mob around jesus when he asked the abrupt question who touched me and saw a trembling little hand of a woman who cast herself at his feet and declare before all the people for what cause she had pulled at the border of his robe and how she had been healed immediately and then we follow on to jairus's house and and juris's house and saw the raisin of his daughter we heard the plain words of a deaf and dumb child after his tongue was loosed by the master's touch and we laughed to see a lame man leap for joy we clambered for a seaside seat with five thousand other men who had forsaken the anvil and the hammer and closed the doors of their shops to spend the day hours and wrapped attention listening to the wonderful teachers of the divine philosopher we wept with the women as we gazed on his beautiful face and recognized the sorrow and grief there that spoke of a broken heart and felt that melting warming sensation from one glance of his kind eyes could bring through the soul yes bible days were here again and here was a man that practiced what we preached amen may it be said tonight that we are a church that we don't just preach the holy ghost but we are a practicing church a man that can have an up to experience hallelujah with the same pillar of fire that smoked fall down on the road to damascus happened happens our young people happen for our old people happen to a church and bring a church back to life again with the power of the holy ghost [Applause] hallelujah we don't just preach of a glorious salvation with the fullness of the holy ghost we got to practice that we don't just preach the promise of divine healing saying god can we got churches and marching around the country saying god can if god will god can but it's more than that we practice that we not only know that god can but we know that god will hallelujah a people that know their god not what he was not what he will be but who he is [Applause] you see what it was they could see the days of jesus all over again amen it would go on to say it has been well said that unique in brother branagh's ministry is amazing gift that enables him to detect and discern the diseases that people have this manifestation is 100 percent perfect this is what they said amen oh i know we got scoffers in this day and they wasn't there but these were men that were there but you see there has to be scoffers arising the last day because this is a part that's a part of the rapture do you know that peter said in the last days that scoffers shall arise saying where is the sign of his coming amen in other words what is this all about he was going to send a prophet a forerunner where is the sign of his coming because now since the prophet has fallen asleep everything remains as it was from the beginning [Applause] are you with me now amen but we're to have scoffers in the last days and some people's got to fulfill that i'm thankful that ain't my part [Applause] amen hallelujah but you see the pentecostals in that day had to say it was 100 percent perfect he said it is a continuous and astonishing thing for brother branham is by the spirit of god is able to perceive in seconds without error what sometimes only weeks of observation in a clinic is able to duplicate this is a mighty sign proving that god is visiting his people a still and greater and more remarkable than uh and more recent manifestation of brother branham's ministry is a gift his gift of discernment word of knowledge that enables him when he is under the anointing to instantly tell the people the secrets of their heart sometimes there are sins which people have hidden away and are unconfessed which hinder them from receiving their healing i know that to be a fact i happen to be there the night when when a when a man who called himself mr teenage america claim to fame and supernatural powers was being able to take his freeport phone book and tear it in half and it was that thick oh now that was his claim mr teenage america this is my strength but a little prophet walked by him and said you sir last night you were out with oh god forgive me okay you've repented all right we won't say no more amen amen this amazing discernment once manifested in the ministries of christ and elisha is profound unique and glorious its exercise brings a solemn spirit over the meeting and indeed transports the beholder back to the miraculous bible days yeah bible days are here again they testified it back then i'm shouting it tonight amen bible days are here again not only with bible signs and bible miracles but a message bible doctrine is here again to manifest and bring forth sons of daughters of god back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints amen but god wanted you to know more than his doctrine god wants you to know his life let me tell you tonight bible life is here with the fullness of the holy ghost where you don't have just a little part a little dip of the spirit that would justify your little greater dip that would sanctify you another little depth in your speaking tongue but for deity to come and tabernacle your flesh to refill you to call you as a son hallelujah a born son a full son an adopted son somebody that knows their god who can do exploits [Applause] hallelujah amen you know i think it's mockery today to say well i'm leaving the message to get back to the bible or get back to jesus that's the biggest mockery i've ever heard in my life [Applause] [Music] amen you know the jesus denominations portray as jesus happens to just be one of the three people in the trinity of gods is it jesus that don't care about what kind of sin you live in amen but he'll he'll save you and then let you live on in your sins it's a jesus that cares not about his word who despises bible holiness and accounts and discounts it only is men's opinion amen it is the opinion of the eternal god amen who said and he said this you have heard it said of all time thou shalt not commit adultery but i say unto you here's the eternal god speaking the eternal word saying that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after in his heart hath committed adultery with her already in his heart amen adultery with her signifying it's not just a man's fault well this is a man's fault you know he's got a dirty mind he looked he lusted so he committed adultery no adultery is an act between two willing people and this shows she is a participant to an act she was willing she stripped herself she wore seductive clothes inviting a man to commit adultery with her in his heart amen a lady who is properly dressed is not a party to an adulterous act but when she wears tight and seductive clothes amen you know i we we ought to be down the road where i wouldn't have to preach holiness reason i'm having to preach holiness because we still got unconverted people and we're having to show them there's a sin problem in your life and that's why you're living unholy that's why your bowels look like you're melted and poured into it that's why your clothes are see-through that's why your dresses are above your knees that's why all of these other sinful things and seductive ways are going on you need jesus you need a bible jesus that'll give you a bible holiness that'll teach you some modesty [Applause] oh i know you wish i had to quit preaching a while ago but i'm preaching right now amen hallelujah i know this in the opinion of hollywood it's not the opinion of the world it's not the opinion of these churches out here but it's bible doctrine it's a bible word it's a bible truth and it was sent to deliver you from sin [Applause] so you can be a people of faith instead of unbelief come on now amen we're preaching bible days are here again and how are you going to have bible days without bible doctrine you say well i i'm just going to believe the bible well then what word is the bible teaching then amen well we'll follow a bible jesus well this is how bible jesus preached he preached the bible holiness amen and if your jesus says you will make it to heaven cross-dressing wearing man's apparel when his unchanging word says is an abomination to god for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man and yet you think you're going to go to heaven from that in god's face that which he hates amen it ain't going to happen let me read to you what god what what god says about heaven that people think they're going to revelation 21 27 of that city and there shall be no wise enter in it anything that us neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life hallelujah lord of god let me tell you you put on a man's garment or a man put on a woman's garment there's no place for you in that city because you're an abomination to god's sight amen to jesus the denominations ain't going to preach that but the bible jesus will preach uh we'll preach it and a bible preacher will preach it and bible people will believe it so well that's you know people say well now not that is not the opinion of our church well that's the problem men value the opinion of the church over the opinion of christ in the bible it's time you want to go back to the bible well then go back to the bible go back to the jesus of the bible who called sin sin and right right and wrong wrong who preached a hole in us that without holiness no man shall see the lord you've got men wanting to dial themselves up and wear some specified shorts and necklaces and bracelets i mean you're not to wear anything that pertains to a woman and to do so is an abomination it's something that god hates and detests god said it ain't welcome in my city well if it ain't welcome in his city and i can't wear it there i ain't going to wear it here because it wouldn't welcome his presence now and he would reject me then amen that jesus the world is offering said there's many ways to come to god that offers tolerance and acceptance of any behavior in almost any sin amen it's a jesus said just try to be good you know and spread a little goodness in the world but demands no change of behavior amen no change of nature you got people sitting on the pews who have never received the bible jesus and that's why they're into pornography that's why they're they're into the things of sin and unbelief that's why they're they're struck and they're addicted to this gaming out here [Applause] [Music] amen you're to have an addiction and that addictions to the word of god amen it's a jesus who offers a catholic theology of the trinity of gods with jesus only being one of the members of the godhead we got 3.5 billion people in the world called christians today there's more than that in the world but that's how many there are christian 3.5 billion christians so-called in the world and most every one of them are following a catholic theology of a trinity of gods with jesus only being one of the members of the godhead but bible doctrine does not say that jesus is in the godhead but that the fullness of the godhead dwelt in jesus hallelujah bible doctrine teaches there's one lord one faith one baptism amen that is it but you see church energy it will offer you anything the world is offering the mind out the mind the altering wine of its adultery and offering you a drink [Applause] they tell you just drink of it and you'll you'll lose your s you know when you drink it you'll lose your senses now wait a minute i just read you in the bible that you were to take this word and eat it they are offering you a cup and saying drink it amen just drink it you'll lose your senses you'll lose your vision you'll have an ecstasy that it's all good it's all fine and now then your vision will blur and makes one god into three different people i know of people around the message that drank some of that and they saw two of them there's two lords for them look like they you know look like we would got established on the rock the revelation of who jesus is amen but instead of that we're taking a philosopher somewhere i tell you the problem they need a new birth and when you get a new birth your faith will be there on that anchor of knowing who jesus is and nobody will ever sell you a two lord or a three god doctrine anymore hallelujah amen the church by and large is called a because he left the bible jesus that she was married to and taken in the seeds of theologians and that's what makes her and so deny his name in salvation when the bible says there's only one name given under heaven whereby men must be saved it's not an option there is one name given under heaven hallelujah glory to god hallelujah but you see in the last day in laodicea he's put out of the church he's unwanted he's unloved and he's undesired hallelujah amen for those of you are interested my timer just went off hallelujah i set that for you so you would know that i was conscious of your time amen but you see the bible said the world will be under a deception and then paul called it a great falling away say well doctrine isn't really important just as long as we got love well ii john 1 and 9 said whosoever tres tres transgression transgresses and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god [Applause] you don't abide in the doctrine of christ you have not god amen there's a deception that is going on as people are there you know and you say well my brother tim i tell you your preaching was good but you made me a little bit uncomfortable amen i do hope it does make you a little uncomfortable i hope it causes a faith to start stern on the inside of you and you decide you decide i'm going to serve god with a passion with the drive to know his word and have a love a love for truth because everybody that don't have a love for truth will be damned amen and i want you to hate people i want you to hate sin amen notice now again as as we go down i i'm going to skip for for those of you i'm going to skip a bunch of things we'll try to get together get it down to you just for a minute but i want you to know we are to come back to a bible jesus a bible look a bible walk a bible water baptism in his name a bible baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] amen you don't find church joining with the bible holy ghost hey man you don't just have somebody come up and recite a creed and say i believe god sent a prophet in this day or you got the holy ghost it's more than that amen the eternal prescription is repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise is unto you and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and in that day you shall know that i'm in the father the father and me and i in you and you and me hallelujah you shall know it ain't something you guess about it ain't something you wonder about it's not something that happened to you and you didn't know it happened it happened and you know it because the people that know their god shall do exploits [Applause] hallelujah glory hallelujah [Applause] a bible baptism of the holy ghost is so intoxicating you can never get enough of it i gotta drink of it one time and i ain't never got over it and i can't get enough of it it keeps me coming back for another drink give me another trick pour it out again lord i won't support that give me another drink of that i'm drinking that holy ghost that changes my nature changes my walk changes my view changes my vision it's a joy that the world didn't give and the world can't take it away hallelujah god wanted you prepared for his coming so he sends a prophet with vindication like no other he goes extreme so he could bring back the authority of the words of jesus where once again the bible is the supreme and final authority amen do you know the revelation of deity to this last day is the amen of god and when god says amen do something ain't nobody else better add anything to it come on church what we heard in this day was the wigged one the supreme court the eternal judge gave you a message to prepare you for his coming and he can't change his mind about it he's got to get somebody to believe in [Applause] hallelujah don't you know what k we're living in in that day michael shall stand up and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven don't you realize what has happened michael has stood up he that is like jehovah has stood up on the behalf of his children [Applause] to do extraordinary things to get you to believe them are you with me now hallelujah you were given examples a while ago you know and you were shown little true who

way you know what's my life going to be like and all of a sudden she changed and began to think of jesus how wonderful he was how great his word was how much she loved him and she raised her hands up and began to thank god and worship him and here he comes sweeping down into the room and as he passes over the bed her eyesight comes back goes right down past the bed to where little drew is sitting on the floor who has never walked who can't pull up and the holy spirit sweeps down by the end of the bed hallelujah who sweeps over little drew up he stands there he stands i am a run and he runs all

believing if that ain't enough when i visited this church when that man was laying there dead in the hospital you said dead he was brain dead and then lifeless there brain dead gonna harvest his organs but we didn't accept that because god is doing extraordinary things as he reveals himself in sons and daughters of god if god can take a dead man and raise him back to life again god can take a
