[3:22] [Music]
[3:26] what a God that we're serving to see hey
[3:31] man I wanted to say that I appreciate
[3:33] your prayers for us this past weekend as
[3:37] we were there in North Carolina brother
[3:39] Joe greens we certainly felt your and
[3:42] your prayers I know that's it's honestly
[3:46] that's what I'm counting on is is that
[3:48] I've got a people back home that's
[3:49] praying for me fighting with me you may
[3:53] think that your prayer is unheard but I
[3:55] want you to know that it's your prayers
[3:56] that that are that are effective and
[3:59] people are able to have breakthroughs
[4:01] and God is able to minister we know that
[4:04] God follows His Word and ministers and
[4:07] so the Lord did marvelous things and he
[4:10] is mighty to be praised brother Joe and
[4:14] the church and the families there they
[4:15] send that greetings back to you and just
[4:18] I just want to wish you there a happy
[4:21] New Year to you and here we are in 2020
[4:25] and who would have thought 20 years ago
[4:29] when everybody was worried about y2k and
[4:31] storing up water and everything else
[4:33] that the whole world is gonna fall apart
[4:35] and we'd be standing here 20 years later
[4:37] nobody anticipated it but God did God
[4:41] knew that we'd be here and I knew that
[4:43] we'd still have young people that that
[4:46] needed to get the Holy Ghost God knew
[4:49] that we'd be here and God's with us he's
[4:52] not left us here alone to fight this
[4:54] battle and and I think it's amazing that
[4:57] our pastor my dad closed out 2019
[5:01] preaching on courage and I say this to
[5:05] you that it's gonna take more courage in
[5:06] 2020 than it did in 2019 because we know
[5:10] that the Bible tells us that hell hath
[5:13] enlarged itself and opened her mouth
[5:15] without measuring and so we know that
[5:17] that we have an enemy that's going after
[5:20] us but I want to speak these words and
[5:23] say them to you that we will not be
[5:25] defeated
[5:26] and we will not be deterred we will give
[5:30] no quarter and we will not show any
[5:32] mercy to the devil we won't show any
[5:35] mercy to sickness to doubt or to fear
[5:38] nor to sin but we're going to run into
[5:40] 20/20 just like we ran into 2019 we're
[5:44] going on with an anticipation that we're
[5:47] going to win we've got one goal and that
[5:50] Surat sir and I've got good news for you
[5:53] there's not one devil that's going to
[5:55] stop us from that rapture so I run into
[5:59] 20/20 with that in our mind hey man so
[6:06] we're gonna do what the Bible tells us
[6:08] over in the book of Hebrews chapter 2
[6:10] therefore we're gonna give more earnest
[6:11] heed to the things which we've heard
[6:13] lest at any time we would let them slip
[6:16] we're not going to neglect this great
[6:18] salvation that's been delivered to us
[6:20] but we're going to receive it we're
[6:22] gonna walk right into that body change
[6:24] we're gonna walk right into that promise
[6:26] walk right into that vision that was
[6:28] seen of you and I they're worshiping God
[6:31] you know as as you that have been here
[6:35] for many years and and have been a part
[6:39] of our own ministry and you know that
[6:41] every year at the beginning of the year
[6:43] I always give a theme for the year last
[6:46] year my theme was of recognizing him and
[6:50] I believe that we recognize Christ
[6:51] amongst us this year I want my my theme
[6:56] for the year to start out and this will
[6:59] be my theme for the whole year that God
[7:02] is with us and we will see miracles
[7:07] God is with us and we will see miracles
[7:11] that's my theme as we go into 2020 and I
[7:15] want to say to you as a church I'm going
[7:17] to tell you and I want you to believe
[7:19] like you've never believed I want you to
[7:22] pray like you've never prayed I want you
[7:24] to ask God big things because he's a big
[7:27] God I want you to accept the things that
[7:29] God has said to you that these promises
[7:31] are unto you that they are yay and amen
[7:34] I want you to receive them just like he
[7:36] said we're going to see God with us in
[7:39] 2020 and we are going to see miracles
[7:41] but if we're going to see those things
[7:43] you're gonna have to believe like never
[7:45] before we're gonna have to take courage
[7:49] but be of good cheer I have overcome the
[7:53] world little children and you shall
[7:55] overcome also amen
[7:58] so we commit our ways unto the Lord and
[8:01] we trust in the Lord and he shall bring
[8:03] it to pass
[8:05] hey man God will not fail us he is with
[8:08] us hey man if you have your Bibles this
[8:11] evening we'll go right into the word
[8:14] here at Matthew chapter 1 and verse 20
[8:17] and then down to John chapter 1 and
[8:21] verse 14 I like to I like to speak to
[8:28] you these things they've been kind of
[8:32] overwhelming my life here in the last
[8:35] last little bit here and I just kind of
[8:39] overwhelmed with this thought and kind
[8:41] of just a very staggering thought in
[8:44] that I spoke a little bit on the on
[8:46] these lines that brother Jose and and
[8:49] I would like to take this theme and
[8:52] maybe I will not title every service God
[8:55] with us for 2020 but that will be my
[8:57] theme you will hear me preach from this
[9:00] thought throughout the whole year you
[9:03] see I've been preaching the same thought
[9:05] I've been preaching from the same
[9:07] message that I started preaching ten
[9:09] years ago on influence that was my very
[9:11] first message and I was I was going back
[9:13] through my notes today and next month 10
[9:17] years 10 years ago I've been preaching
[9:19] 10 years
[9:20] and that just kind of seemed to went
[9:22] real fast but you know I've been feeding
[9:24] off of that that sermon ever since then
[9:27] one sermon just rolls right into the
[9:29] next one you know and I'm still
[9:31] influenced I'm still influenced by the
[9:33] mighty angel amen so I want to I want to
[9:37] preach to you this evening and on God
[9:41] with us and that thought right there is
[9:45] enough to close our Bibles and leave and
[9:48] go home tonight because just that fault
[9:51] right now that he said that he never
[9:53] leaves you and that he never forsake you
[9:55] and he said that where two or three are
[9:58] gathered in my name there I will be in
[10:00] the midst of them where more than two or
[10:02] three here tonight so when they God is
[10:04] here so a man let's just read this this
[10:07] portion of Scripture here Matthew
[10:10] chapter 1 2 verse 20 but while he
[10:12] thought on these things behold the angel
[10:15] of the Lord appeared unto him and a
[10:17] dream saying Joseph thou thou son of
[10:20] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[10:23] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[10:27] her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall
[10:30] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[10:32] his name Jesus for he shall save his
[10:35] people from their sins now all this was
[10:39] done that it might be fulfilled which
[10:41] was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet
[10:43] saying behold a virgin shall be with
[10:46] child and shall bring forth a son and
[10:49] they shall call his name Emmanuel which
[10:53] being interpreted is God with us John
[10:58] chapter 1 and verse 14 a man as you're
[11:04] turning there I just like to make
[11:05] mention to you that next weekend or next
[11:08] Saturday night we will be doing as we
[11:11] did the last few years we will be taking
[11:14] a portion of the service make it a
[11:17] little special service for you for the
[11:18] coming end of the year and brother
[11:20] William brother Matthew myself and
[11:22] brother Ron will be speaking about 15
[11:24] minutes each and just giving giving some
[11:28] things and committing what we're
[11:29] committing unto the Lord we're all
[11:31] taking about 15 minutes
[11:33] but you know brother on has he's got its
[11:36] seniority and he can take as much time
[11:38] as he wants to so so us three us three
[11:42] boys will go first and well let's will
[11:44] let senior Papa come in behind us and
[11:46] and and just go ahead and just show us
[11:49] how it's done so a man John chapter 1
[11:53] and verse 14 and the Word was made flesh
[11:57] and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his
[12:02] glory that's a beautiful thought right
[12:04] there we beheld his glory the glory as
[12:07] the of the only begotten of the Father
[12:10] full of grace and truth
[12:13] amen let's just bow our hearts this
[12:15] evening unto the Lord heavenly father we
[12:17] so thank you Lord Jesus for this
[12:20] privilege that we might bow our heads to
[12:23] the dust of the earth from which we came
[12:25] and Lord we sense your nearness even now
[12:27] father Lord Jesus every time we read
[12:30] over your holy script Lord we realize
[12:33] that we are reading you and in letter
[12:36] form my father we're asking tonight that
[12:39] that the word would come off the pages
[12:41] and that you would speak to us Lord
[12:43] Jesus Lord minister to our hearts and we
[12:46] pray that you would reach out your hands
[12:49] upon this congregation and that you have
[12:51] blessed them in a special way lord I
[12:54] pray that you would bring them a light
[12:56] Lord Jesus may you quicken the word to
[12:59] the hearts just now whatever they have a
[13:01] need of Lord they hold in their heart
[13:03] and I pray that you administer to them
[13:05] in a special way and we'll be careful to
[13:07] serve you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[13:09] Christ
[13:10] amen and amen may God bless you may be
[13:12] seated this evening a man amen
[13:16] as I said would like to speak to you on
[13:18] on God with us God with us hey man you
[13:21] ain't got to get up and leave yet
[13:22] brother Doug hey man I'm thankful to
[13:26] have my mom my buddy and brother Gabriel
[13:28] back here with us and his friends so we
[13:30] so welcome you here in the Lord and
[13:32] their family to us all and just like
[13:35] everyone here where we're a great big
[13:37] family and the family of God man but as
[13:41] we begin to reflect upon this thought
[13:43] here but we as believers no matter
[13:47] how long we've been Christians no no
[13:49] matter if we've had in our experience
[13:50] maybe last week or maybe 50 or 20 years
[13:53] ago whatever whatever the timeslot might
[13:56] be for you but that thought that God is
[14:00] with us it's such a staggering and
[14:03] overwhelming an amazing thought in its
[14:05] own that God is that God is with us and
[14:09] we realize as Christians and any person
[14:12] here we realize that we're absolutely
[14:13] nothing without him and that he is the
[14:17] one that controls you and I tonight and
[14:19] I want you to know that I realize
[14:21] tonight that I'm helpless and hopeless
[14:23] as can be unless he comes but I was I
[14:26] was given a commandment in the word that
[14:28] he told us to preach this message and
[14:31] and Paul said as much as is as much as
[14:33] in me is now I am ready to preach this
[14:36] gospel unto you and so I realized
[14:39] tonight that God that God is not going
[14:41] to use trees to speak to us though he
[14:43] could he could have used wood to speak
[14:45] to us he could have used flowers to
[14:47] speak to us but God chose man to speak
[14:50] to us and he is the one that is in
[14:52] control of you and I and we realize
[14:54] today that we're completely hopeless and
[14:57] helpless without him and he's the one
[14:59] that controls us we speak about the
[15:02] things that happen in 2019 and we talk
[15:05] about the miracles that took place and
[15:07] we could reflect upon those things and
[15:09] talk about those things of how great and
[15:12] staggering the things of the miracles
[15:14] that we have seen amongst us but we
[15:16] realize that that was none other than
[15:17] God that was none other than than Jesus
[15:20] Christ the same yesterday today and
[15:22] forever and we promise that these signs
[15:25] shall follow them that believe and we
[15:28] realize that these promises are to us as
[15:31] believers and and if we believe we
[15:33] realize that if we have reverence under
[15:35] the word and if we respect this word
[15:38] that those things will operate amongst
[15:40] us and that's why I believe that we as a
[15:43] church we have seen so many mighty
[15:45] things amongst us we have seen miracles
[15:48] we have seen we have seen produções
[15:50] comeback we have seen young people's
[15:52] lives completely turned around we have
[15:55] seen them be baptized a fresh for the
[15:57] holy ghost we have seen lives completely
[16:00] transformed we seen livers completely
[16:03] put in place we seen sail on top of sail
[16:06] built upon in the Church of the Living
[16:08] God
[16:09] and we see a mighty God that has amongst
[16:12] us these things are not some far-off
[16:14] they're not just in conventions but
[16:16] these things are every single weekend
[16:18] unto us and we're not just waiting on
[16:21] convention time but I believe that right
[16:23] now that God is here I believe that God
[16:26] can speak to us and God can minister to
[16:28] us in such a way that we would have to
[16:31] say that that was Jesus here and you
[16:34] remember that here that prophet had a
[16:36] little prophet would stand Merritt he
[16:38] would he would roll his shoulders back
[16:40] and he would say now you know I can't do
[16:42] anything unless he comes and he would
[16:45] stand there and talk to you and and he
[16:46] would speak to the patient that would
[16:48] stand in front of him and he would he
[16:50] would speak those sayings and he would
[16:52] say and he said now I'm trying to catch
[16:54] her spirit you've heard those things and
[16:56] and in there there he is he's trying to
[16:59] catch that spirit and trying to speak
[17:01] now he's not contacting their soul but
[17:03] he's speaking to their spirit trying to
[17:05] find their spirit here he is any any he
[17:08] says now you know I can't do anything
[17:10] without him coming but eat all of a
[17:12] sudden he says now he's here now now
[17:15] takes fear I take control of every
[17:18] unsound spirit every evil spirit here in
[17:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[17:23] the glory of the Lord and watch those
[17:26] demons completely defeated we realize
[17:30] that that was not a man but that was God
[17:33] you see no man can produce these things
[17:35] that we're seeing
[17:37] no man can produce the things that we're
[17:39] watching amongst us this is God that is
[17:42] with us now in Christ the mystery of God
[17:45] revealed he said know God's secret
[17:48] mystery he had before the world began
[17:50] now back in the back part of God's mind
[17:53] there was something that he was trying
[17:55] and was going to achieve and he had a
[17:58] motive in doing it in order to let
[18:00] himself be expressed because first there
[18:03] was there wasn't even a moon a star and
[18:06] Adam
[18:06] milah cure anything but he was God but
[18:10] he exactly wasn't God at that time
[18:12] because God is an object to worship here
[18:14] he is Elohim himself but here nothing
[18:17] had been created there so we realized
[18:19] that the very first thing that he
[18:21] created was angels that he might be
[18:24] worshiped we realized that tonight but
[18:27] he wasn't exactly God at that time
[18:28] because God is an object of worship and
[18:31] there was nothing the worship him so he
[18:33] created angels so here in his great mind
[18:36] he wanted these attributes to be
[18:38] expressed and in him was love and in him
[18:41] was to be a father in him was to be a
[18:43] son and in him was to be a savior in him
[18:47] was to be healer and all of these great
[18:49] attributes that we see already expressed
[18:52] these things were in God's mind to think
[18:56] about that that God is with us now it's
[19:01] one thing for you and I to say that
[19:03] somebody is with us but to say that God
[19:06] is with us you know what you know
[19:08] sometimes when you're walking down a
[19:10] dark alley your sisters you're walking
[19:12] down a dark alley it makes you feel good
[19:14] to know that you got your husband right
[19:16] there with you it makes you feel good
[19:18] that you can slip your arm around him
[19:20] now right up underneath of his elbow and
[19:22] you can hold on tight to him it it makes
[19:24] you feel good to know that he's with you
[19:26] but to realize that that God is with you
[19:30] and at any moment at any time in life
[19:33] that you can slip your arm underneath of
[19:36] his great arm of power and that he can
[19:39] take you through Laodicea and realize
[19:41] that you're not alone here in this
[19:43] battle but God is with you God sees you
[19:47] in your prayers God sees you in your
[19:49] circumstance but it's such an amazing
[19:51] fault that that God is with us to me I
[19:55] I'm moved by this thought I can't hardly
[19:58] sleep because of this law I can't hardly
[20:01] I can't hardly pray without crying just
[20:04] thinking about this song
[20:05] I can hardly I can't hardly speak to
[20:08] somebody without these things are cooing
[20:10] out of my soul because this is an
[20:12] amazing God that is with us
[20:15] we're talking about the God of Abraham
[20:17] and Isaac can take up this God is with
[20:19] us the God that robbed the world off of
[20:23] his fingertips that bod is in us that
[20:27] God is with us he didn't leave us here
[20:29] alone to think that the Supreme Being
[20:34] Jehovah the eternal and infinite spirit
[20:36] the creator and the sovereign one of the
[20:39] universe is with you and I the God that
[20:43] is a spirit that must be worshipped in
[20:45] spirit and in truth that God is with you
[20:49] and I the God that is declared to be
[20:53] light and love and the invisible one the
[20:57] god that is declared to be the
[20:58] unsearchable incorruptible eternal and
[21:01] immortal God that God's with you and I
[21:03] tonight the god that is declared to be
[21:06] omnipotent I'm missing the all-knowing
[21:09] God the God that has declared to be the
[21:11] omnipresent God it may feel like Satan
[21:15] has got you surrounded it may feel like
[21:17] the demons of Hell have got you
[21:19] surrounded
[21:19] but those demons are not omnipresent are
[21:23] you with me though that Satan himself is
[21:25] not omnipresent there's only one being
[21:28] that is omnipresent and that's God and
[21:32] God is with you young people when you
[21:33] walk through the halls that God is with
[21:36] you when you go down the hospital rooms
[21:38] brother Nathanael that God is with you
[21:40] when you go to college come on somebody
[21:44] the demons of hell try to whisper in
[21:46] your ear and say that they're there
[21:48] watching your every move but they're not
[21:50] there that's a lie straight from the
[21:52] pits of hell but you can rest assure
[21:55] that God Almighty is there when you wake
[21:57] up he's there when you're sleeping he's
[22:00] there when you're dreaming he's there
[22:02] when you're worshiping he's always there
[22:07] hello yeah he is declared to be the
[22:11] immutable the only wise God the glorious
[22:14] and most have a perfect God the one that
[22:18] is declared to be the holy and just and
[22:20] true upright God the
[22:22] is one the good God a great God a
[22:25] gracious God a faithful God a merciful
[22:28] God the God that is declared to be
[22:30] long-suffering he's jealous and
[22:33] compassionate that God is a consuming
[22:35] fire that God there is none beside him
[22:39] there's none before him there's none
[22:41] like him there's nothing good but he
[22:43] hallelujah he feels all heaven time
[22:46] space and eternity and that God should
[22:49] be worshiped in spirit and in truth to
[22:52] realize today that that God is with you
[22:55] and I I don't care what you came packing
[23:00] in this service tonight but you can walk
[23:03] out right now and realize that all of
[23:06] heaven is behind you whoo God's with me
[23:16] hallelujah to realize that you're not
[23:19] alone in this battle that he is here
[23:22] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[23:24] candlesticks and he held the Stars in
[23:26] his hand they were not here just
[23:29] wandering around on their own like a
[23:30] wandering star but they were in his
[23:32] hands they were in his control and if he
[23:35] had our messengers in his hand
[23:37] how much more as he got you and I on his
[23:39] hand in his control in his power you
[23:44] woke up and you thought yous gonna make
[23:46] out your own plans today God's got this
[23:49] [Applause]
[23:51] hallelujah
[23:53] the Bible said in Genesis Lord that in
[23:56] the beginning God created heaven and
[23:59] earth and the earth was without form it
[24:02] was a bunch of chaos and boy kind of
[24:06] like your life and darkness was upon the
[24:09] face of the deep kind of like your life
[24:12] but all of a sudden the Spirit of God
[24:14] moved upon the face of the waters and
[24:17] God said let there be light and there
[24:19] was light
[24:24] so God here in the beginning the eternal
[24:26] he wasn't even God God's an object of
[24:29] worship we've already established that
[24:31] so he wasn't even that he was ill of him
[24:34] he was the eternal one I will be don't
[24:38] mind me talking about God it's my theme
[24:41] for 2020 God with us hallelujah he was
[24:47] they loved him the eternal one but in
[24:49] him was thoughts that he wanted to
[24:51] become material and what did he do that
[24:54] he spoke a word and the word was
[24:56] materialized and that's the whole
[24:58] picture from Genesis all the way over to
[25:01] Revelation it's nothing wrong its Elohim
[25:04] materializing himself so that he can be
[25:08] touched the self existing one
[25:12] materializing himself so that he can be
[25:15] felt you see I'm not talking about a God
[25:17] of history I'm not talking about a God
[25:20] that was I'm talking about a God that is
[25:22] I'm not talking about a god that's dead
[25:25] I'm talking about a God that's living
[25:26] I'm talking to you about a God that will
[25:29] not and cannot change a god that don't
[25:32] back up and God that does not know the
[25:34] word retreat a god that will fight your
[25:37] battles 2020 maybe staring you down but
[25:42] I want you to rest assure that the God
[25:44] of heaven is with you don't shake your
[25:49] neighbors hand they might be sick to
[25:51] look at them and tell them God's with me
[25:53] if you're sick don't shake my head
[25:58] Alleluia salute thy brethren as Paul
[26:01] said but the Bible said in first a first
[26:04] Timothy three and 16 that without
[26:06] without controversy great is the mystery
[26:10] of godliness God was manifest in the
[26:13] flesh think about that
[26:14] God was manifest in the flesh justified
[26:17] in the spirit seen of angels preached
[26:19] unto the Gentiles believed on in the
[26:22] world and received up into glory God the
[26:25] self existing one robing himself in
[26:27] humanity
[26:30] who the great Jehovah God that was there
[26:33] in the very beginning he came down and
[26:35] he was made tangible by living in the
[26:39] body of his son son declaring and
[26:41] reconciling the world to himself does
[26:44] not the Bible say to you and I that we
[26:46] have a faithful high priest that can be
[26:48] touched by the feeling of our
[26:50] infirmities he knows what you're going
[26:53] through you can look over in the early
[26:57] history of the church and find that
[27:00] Jesus was there sitting by the roadside
[27:02] and that Jesus was groaning with a
[27:05] headache Wow
[27:08] because he had to go through pain
[27:10] migraines like you and I he had to come
[27:13] to earth and be manifested in flesh so
[27:16] that he could feel like you and I could
[27:18] feel are you with me this evening you
[27:23] see because you in the beginning you
[27:25] were in God but God could not fellowship
[27:28] with you there in spirit form
[27:30] we do not believe in preexisting of
[27:32] souls but you were in God
[27:34] as an attribute and you see you were a
[27:37] seed you can find that in God's power to
[27:39] transform that you are a word you are a
[27:41] seed and then now you are manifested so
[27:44] that Christ can work that God can
[27:47] fellowship with you
[27:49] he cannot fellowship with you as the
[27:52] great I am in heaven but God countenance
[27:54] ended and came and native himself of no
[27:57] reputation and he humbled himself into
[28:01] the cross and he took upon in the form
[28:03] of man who this God was there hanging on
[28:08] the cross 2,000 years ago to save you
[28:16] from the sins that you hadn't even
[28:19] committed at 2,000 years ago but this is
[28:23] an eternal atonement that was taking
[28:25] place 2,000 years ago you may not have
[28:28] been manifested here 2,000 years ago but
[28:31] the blood of Jesus Christ has never lost
[28:33] its power it will never lose its power
[28:36] it reaches to the highest
[28:39] it's all the way into the lowest of
[28:41] valleys this blood has the power to wipe
[28:44] away all of your sins you may be the
[28:47] lowest of lows you may have been abused
[28:50] in life you may have been talked about
[28:52] in life you may have been beaten in life
[28:54] maybe not had the right amount of her
[28:56] the right structure as a family but this
[28:59] God is with you you may not have had the
[29:04] right kind of father figure but I want
[29:06] you to know you've always had a heavenly
[29:08] father and he's watched over your seed
[29:11] all the way back from Adam he's been
[29:14] looking for you and you're here whoo
[29:21] hallelujah
[29:22] think about that God wanted to become
[29:25] flesh so that he could feel like you so
[29:27] he could understand like you this great
[29:32] God dropped down from a supernatural
[29:35] being downed into something tangible a
[29:39] God that we could see a God that we
[29:42] could touch a God that we could handle
[29:46] he has anointed me to preach the gospel
[29:49] unto you this day this scripture is
[29:52] fulfilled in your ears this God Elohim
[29:55] was made manifest I'm not talking about
[30:01] a God at 2,000 years ago I'm talking
[30:03] about God right now you see a lot of
[30:06] times people get their eyes on the god
[30:08] of Calvary and they miss the God all
[30:10] right now you see where if we're gonna
[30:14] look for God brother William where we're
[30:16] going to look for Matt we're not gonna
[30:17] look for him robed in a robe of 2000
[30:19] years ago not wearing sandals like they
[30:22] would've wore 2,000 years ago but God in
[30:25] human flesh right now God worshiping and
[30:28] fellowshipping
[30:29] in flesh right now
[30:33] I know this is going to catch you off
[30:36] guard but you know that the Bible says
[30:38] that you are gods that God dwelleth in
[30:42] you and that you are the temple of the
[30:45] Holy Ghost that God the God that created
[30:49] those flowers I thought that created the
[30:53] wood that is built here that God is
[30:56] living in human flesh today yeah you're

[31:05] Catholic Church and you're probably not

[33:02] same God that met Paul on the road to
[33:04] Damascus I met him

[33:49] you here he's gonna change your body
[33:53] [Applause]
[33:59] calm yourself
[34:03] I'm not talking about a god some voice
[34:05] far off I'm talking about a God right
[34:09] now some people want to say that was
[34:13] only said in the 60s but I want to take
[34:15] you all the way back to deity of Jesus
[34:17] Christ 1948 he said deities not in
[34:21] heaven but deities in you come on
[34:25] somebody and if all of the seals have
[34:27] been released off the back of the book
[34:29] what about right now we're in our focus
[34:33] we are heaven we are seated in heavenly
[34:36] places we're blessed to be sitting here
[34:39] in all heavenly blessings he ordained me
[34:43] to this spot whoo he's here and he's
[34:49] declaring himself but he's Hebrews 13
[34:52] and eight the same yesterday today and
[34:54] forever and to think that that God is
[34:58] with us God of creation God that would
[35:09] speak the moon into existence God that
[35:12] would speak the Sun into existence the
[35:18] garden that would watch it roll off the
[35:20] end of his fingertips as it were and let
[35:24] it roll out there a hundred million
[35:26] years and stop it in its place what a
[35:31] drama but a reality that God is with us
[35:36] now this God had been lost throughout
[35:41] the throughout the years as it were he
[35:44] was not lost but the through the
[35:46] preaching of creeds and dogmas here this
[35:49] great God was smothered up by wet
[35:52] blankets that did not want the Holy
[35:54] Ghost moving in the church and here yet
[35:58] we see that even now we see us as
[36:01] critics rising and then the spirit of
[36:04] unity as it were has tried to rise up
[36:07] and bring all the truck the the World
[36:10] Council of Churches together
[36:11] you see God has never said in one place
[36:14] that we would be united as a church but
[36:16] we will be united in him and to think
[36:20] that that God is with us that that back
[36:24] there before he ever spoke that word it
[36:27] was a fault that he would create these
[36:29] things it was a thought and then it
[36:31] became a word and when that word was
[36:33] released those sayings that he had in
[36:36] his mind came into existence and to
[36:39] think that maybe maybe we put it to you
[36:41] like
[36:41] so that the children would understand it
[36:43] that God thought of a tree and God said
[36:46] let there be a tree and there appeared a
[36:49] tree who to think tonight that that Bob
[36:53] was to live on sound the inside of a
[36:56] little bitty boy by the name of Waylon
[36:59] we're a little bitty girl by the name of
[37:01] Al he heard a little bitty boy by the
[37:03] name of no ii think that that bob was
[37:05] syllable me inside of you young kids i
[37:08] want you to hear me loud and clear
[37:10] you ain't gotta wait to your teenager to
[37:12] get it you can get it right now
[37:14] you ain't gonna be a certain age but i
[37:17] believe that you can have the baptism of
[37:19] the holy ghost at 4 or 5 years old i
[37:22] believe that if you repent of your sins
[37:24] and a baptized in the name of the lord
[37:26] jesus christ you shall receive the gift
[37:28] of the holy ghost then a certain age or
[37:31] a certain stipulation and they don't
[37:33] even matter how old your if you're 95
[37:36] years old I believe that the Holy Ghost
[37:39] is for you and wants to be packed on the
[37:41] inside of your soul watch that God as he
[37:51] speaks those things into existence but
[37:54] here we are and the church says in
[37:57] Laodicea and we're watching that same
[38:00] Lord of creation work right amongst you
[38:03] Allah we're watching him as he said let
[38:06] there be light and the Bible said in
[38:09] Zechariah 14 and 7 that in the evening
[38:12] time it shall be light you see when God
[38:15] said let there be light he said let
[38:18] there be light it was once a word but
[38:20] once the light was there it was no
[38:22] longer ordered it was a reality and that
[38:25] which was spoken over thousands of years
[38:27] ago that in the evening time it should
[38:30] be light you and I are watching those
[38:32] things as it comes to pass and the Cubs
[38:35] of prophecy a rolling ride on time you
[38:39] an hour in the moment of prophecy don't
[38:44] miss these things but God the God of
[38:47] reality the god of the I am the God of
[38:50] the prophets is right here
[38:53] and there is all types of things of
[38:56] churches and and creeds and critics that
[38:59] are that are trying to cast more
[39:00] darkness you know that that they're the
[39:03] children of the night love darkness and
[39:06] you find that when somebody begins to
[39:09] speak when they begin to speak Eve will
[39:11] the Lord Jesus Christ you find what is
[39:13] only inside of their soul and that they
[39:15] love darkness and you see what they try
[39:18] to do is cast more darkness but I have
[39:21] found in life if you've got the little
[39:23] list of flashlights no matter how weak
[39:28] to the light is no matter how much the
[39:31] battery is on the inside if there's a
[39:33] light darkness has to leave and you may
[39:37] be a small Christian here today but I
[39:40] want you to know that there's more than
[39:42] an energizer bunny sitting here tonight
[39:44] to give you more power there's a Holy
[39:47] Ghost here that will set your soul
[39:50] flying and give you the light of the day
[39:52] the same Sun that rose in the East is
[39:55] the same one that's Ross that's setting
[39:57] in the West this is the evening time
[40:02] hallelujah no matter how dark it gets
[40:06] out there I want you to hear me no
[40:08] matter how dark it gets no matter how
[40:10] much they want to cast shadows no matter
[40:12] how dark it gets in Egypt are you
[40:14] delivering children yes we'll still
[40:16] headlight here go over in the book of
[40:28] Revelation
[40:29] Revelation chapter 1 and there we see
[40:31] John on the Isle of happiness and here
[40:34] in the revelation of Jesus Christ we are
[40:36] given a glimpse of the supreme deity of
[40:40] Jesus Christ
[40:41] here in Revelations 1 and 8 he says I am
[40:45] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[40:48] end say the Lord which is which was and
[40:50] which is to come the Almighty you see in
[40:53] other words he said I'll be supreme in
[40:55] the first and I'll be supreme in the
[40:57] last you see if he was supreme in the
[41:00] first stage he has to be supreme in the
[41:03] last stage if he was supreme
[41:05] Paul he has to be supreme in the profit
[41:08] of this day are you with me Jesus was
[41:13] there standing with his disciples he was
[41:16] saying to them in Matthew chapter 16
[41:18] that whom the men say that I the Son of
[41:20] Man am and they said that some say that
[41:23] there are larger and some say that thou
[41:25] art John the Baptist but Jesus don't
[41:28] really care what the rest of the world
[41:30] says he wants to know what you've got to
[41:31] say he wants to know what you got to say
[41:35] sister Jada
[41:37] he was understand he wants you he wants
[41:39] to know what you say here that he is
[41:41] Simon Peter answered and said that how
[41:44] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[41:46] and Jesus turned to him and said blessed
[41:49] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[41:51] blood hath not revealed this under thee
[41:53] but my father which is in heaven
[41:55] and he said upon this rock I will build
[41:57] my church and the gates of Hell will not
[41:59] prevail against it it shows to you and I
[42:02] that the gates of Hell will be against
[42:04] it but they will not prevail they will
[42:07] not overcome and Satan hates revelation
[42:11] but you and I love it there's power in
[42:14] Revelation and here we look that this is
[42:19] the revelation of who Guardians that's
[42:25] where he builds his church upon not upon
[42:28] himself but upon the revelation of who
[42:30] he is
[42:31] are you with me not upon Peter though
[42:35] his man his name may be stone but that
[42:38] is not where God built his church upon
[42:40] but he built it upon the foundation of
[42:43] the revelation of Jesus Christ and you
[42:46] can find that over in Revelation chapter
[42:49] three and eight and brother Branham
[42:50] would say that it's the lap over he said
[42:52] it's that step up from the next step and
[42:55] he said there in the lap o Reese and I
[42:57] can show it to you by the scripture that
[42:59] he said there in the closing out of the
[43:02] Philadelphia interchange and the lap
[43:04] over to the Laodicean Church age that
[43:06] Jesus said that I have set before you an
[43:10] open door and no man can shut it
[43:13] no man can shut it what is that open
[43:17] door is the revelation of the supreme
[43:19] deity of Jesus Christ What did he say to
[43:24] the First Church back there he said I am
[43:26] he that was which is and shall come I am
[43:30] the first and the last
[43:32] I am the Almighty he said it three
[43:34] different times he made himself deity to
[43:37] this first Church here before he went
[43:39] into the last church he said I've set
[43:42] before you an open door and if you want
[43:46] to see the revelation here it is where
[43:48] he would build his church and the only
[43:50] way that he could take his church his
[43:52] back to the revelation of what he is and
[43:56] what was the first thing that he reveals
[43:58] himself areas ask but the God of heaven
[44:02] that God is with you
[44:07] not a triune God but one God I know I'm
[44:13] gonna make halo upset but that's okay
[44:15] that's my job
[44:16] not a triune God but one God one God and
[44:21] he reveals himself that way in the first
[44:23] revelation and he speaks it four times
[44:26] in the first chapter so that there would
[44:28] be no mistake and the first thing that
[44:30] you've got to know is that Jesus is not
[44:32] a prophet Jesus is not a Junior God he
[44:36] is not a secondarily God He is God for
[44:40] the Bible said in Deuteronomy 6 and 4
[44:42] here Orissa the Lord your God is one
[44:45] Lord Zechariah 14 and I and the Lord
[44:50] shall be king over all the earth in that
[44:52] day there shall be one Lord and his name
[44:55] one and Paul declared these things over
[44:59] in the book of Ephesians chapter four
[45:01] and verse four that there's one body one
[45:05] spirit even as he recalled in one hope
[45:08] of your calling one Lord one faith one
[45:11] baptism one God and Father of all who's
[45:13] above all through all and in you all
[45:15] that God is with you
[45:18] the God is not one like your finger if
[45:21] you see if you make God one like your
[45:23] finger you
[45:24] Jesus being his own daddy but he was God
[45:28] manifested in the flesh and John would
[45:32] say that the concept of God was
[45:35] expressed in Jesus that God is with you
[45:41] that God who on occasions would manifest
[45:44] his presence by the cloud or pillar five
[45:47] that struck fear in the hearts of men
[45:49] this God whose hearts characteristics
[45:51] were made known only by revelation of
[45:54] words through the prophets now became
[45:56] Immanuel God with us declaring himself
[46:02] that word declare is taken from the
[46:05] Greek root which we often interpret as
[46:08] exegesis which means to thoroughly
[46:11] explain and make clear I know some of
[46:17] you want me to slow down but I only have
[46:24] one gear so stay with me that is what
[46:35] the living Lord Jesus did he brought God
[46:39] to you and I for he was God he revealed
[46:45] God to us with such perfect clarity who
[46:52] now we're getting somewhere we get into
[46:56] a spot that if you realize the principle
[47:00] revelation of the whole entire Bible was
[47:02] Jesus that Jesus is God that he is the
[47:05] supreme deity of Almighty God that Jesus
[47:08] is not a second God or a lesser God he's
[47:12] not the second person in the Trinity but
[47:14] he is God for the Bible said in
[47:16] Colossians 2 and 9 for in him dwelleth
[47:18] all the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[47:21] Jesus is the word and the Word was made
[47:24] flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld
[47:26] him as the only begotten of the Father
[47:29] that great I am that made himself known
[47:31] when he came down a mountain
[47:33] when Moses went up there to get the Ten
[47:36] Commandments from Almighty God and only
[47:39] Moses was allowed to go up on that
[47:41] mountain through sanctification and the
[47:43] Bible said that if any animal would
[47:45] touch that melton it had to be thrust
[47:47] through with a dart that God was
[47:51] unfolding himself to you and I so that
[47:54] he can be felt so that he could be
[47:56] touched that we might touch him whoa
[48:01] what's he doing he's trying he is
[48:04] claiming his Road trying to get into you
[48:07] and I trying to get in the man but will
[48:12] you let this God live on the inside of
[48:15] you come on somebody
[48:20] now I'm getting down with a rubber meets
[48:22] the road
[48:23] will you let this go the god of heavens
[48:26] live on the inside of you you see if you
[48:30] don't let him live there you will not
[48:32] overcome to overcome is to keep life in
[48:36] you and the Bible said that in Isaiah 54
[48:40] and 5 that the maker is on husband the
[48:43] Lord of Hosts is his name and I Redeemer
[48:46] the Holy One of Israel the god of the
[48:48] whole earth shall he be called is he the
[48:52] god over your earth the god over this
[48:56] earth right here is he your God this was
[49:00] not another god this was not another
[49:02] angel this was not a lesser God this was
[49:05] God in flesh and Jesus said in John 5
[49:08] and 43 that I am Tom in my father's name
[49:11] and you have received me not but to them
[49:14] not receive me come on somebody
[49:18] why did any son when he comes he comes
[49:21] in his father's name's there right and
[49:24] with Jesus and when the first time that
[49:27] Jesus is being spoke from the Angels
[49:29] tongues and here when he's speaking with
[49:32] Joseph over in the book of Matthew
[49:34] chapter 1 and he said that thou shalt
[49:36] call his name
[49:38] in Jesus and he shall save his people
[49:40] from his sense this is the name of the
[49:45] Father that God what's the live only
[49:53] inside of you that man child was not
[49:56] Jewish neither was he Gentile he was God
[49:59] manifested in the flesh the only one
[50:02] that could redeem you and I his blood
[50:05] saves us his blood heals us his blood
[50:08] washes us it's his blood that we stand
[50:11] upon - any promise that he made God
[50:14] promised to do it he came in his
[50:17] father's name and that is where God
[50:19] placed his name is in his son that's the
[50:22] only place that you can worship Him the
[50:25] only place that God will ever meet you
[50:27] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:30] Christ that is God's chosen place of
[50:33] worship you can look over in the Old
[50:35] Testament and God said that thou shalt
[50:38] not worship me in all these other gates
[50:40] but only in the gate that I choose to
[50:42] put my name where did he choose to put
[50:45] his name but only in his son Jesus
[50:48] Christ we worship in that name we praise
[50:52] in that name we preach in that name and
[50:55] there is power in that name hello
[50:59] somebody
[51:00] the God that created the moons and the
[51:02] stars and the Sun that God that created
[51:05] the rod that Moses would hold the God
[51:07] that created the rocks the stones that
[51:09] David would pick up and we would kill
[51:12] his your life that God wants to live on
[51:14] the inside of you that God's with you

[51:26] you that he is Emmanuel which is being
[51:29] interpreted God with us and I want to

[51:55] things be done it is not done in the
[51:58] name of the Pope nor in the name of the
[52:00] church but only in the name of Jesus
[52:02] Christ
[52:03] matter of fact he did not manifest
[52:05] himself as God the Savior in God el

[1:00:11] blood still saves and his power still
[1:00:15] heals that God's here that God is with
[1:00:28] us and that God's for us the Bible said
[1:00:34] in Psalms 86 and eighth among the gods
[1:00:39] there is none like unto thee O Lord
[1:00:41] neither are there any works like unto
[1:00:43] thee like unto thy works all nations

[1:01:18] an attitude I'm not talking about
[1:01:22] everywhere I got an attitude I'm better
[1:01:23] than you but I'm talking about
[1:01:24] worshiping with an attitude that the
[1:01:27] demons of hell that are holding you
[1:01:29] bound you start worshiping with that
[1:01:31] attitude that when you go to place it
[1:01:33] the great I am the strongholds of hail
[1:01:35] gain hold you no longer star wars happen
[1:01:38] with an attitude of a conquer as a
[1:01:41] as a warrior that you are going to take
[1:01:44] your Giants down God is with us
[1:01:47] and we will see miracles hallelujah you
[1:02:00] start to realize that that God's with us
[1:02:02] that that God of heaven will protect you
[1:02:05] that the God of heaven will fight your
[1:02:07] battles he will deliver us he will heal
[1:02:10] us he will save us he will change us he
[1:02:13] will wash us and one of these mornings
[1:02:15] he's gonna rapture you and I I'm not
[1:02:19] talking about a God I'm not talking
[1:02:21] about Christ in the manger but I'm
[1:02:23] talking about Christ in you the hope of
[1:02:25] glory you ain't got nothing to be scared
[1:02:28] of of going into the future David wasn't
[1:02:31] worried when he walked down into the
[1:02:32] valley and he realized that he was the
[1:02:35] only one there alone but he realized
[1:02:37] that there was a God that was with him
[1:02:39] he was not worried about it but he knew
[1:02:42] that the God that was with him when he
[1:02:45] saved him from the power of the line and
[1:02:47] the power of the bear would surely
[1:02:49] deliver him from the hand of the
[1:02:52] Philistine and you won't hear me quoting
[1:02:57] from king Saul too much but I'm going to
[1:02:58] quote something to you that I want you
[1:03:00] to do that this is a commission to you
[1:03:03] he said David go and the Lord be with
[1:03:07] thee little bride go go and the Lord be
[1:03:17] with you
[1:03:18] I'm gonna preach this until you believe
[1:03:21] it go in the Lord be with thee I'm gonna
[1:03:25] preach it till you believe it and when
[1:03:27] you believe it I want you to receive it
[1:03:28] and when you receive it I want you to
[1:03:30] shout about it and when you shout about
[1:03:32] it I want you to shout so much to the
[1:03:34] walls come down and when the walls come
[1:03:36] down I want you to testify to somebody
[1:03:39] else and let them testify to somebody
[1:03:41] else and it all started because I
[1:03:43] started preaching what the Bible said
[1:03:46] so what are we going to do we're going
[1:03:49] to believe what the Bible said there by
[1:03:52] his sights we are healed by his Spirit
[1:03:55] we are sealed David knew God was with
[1:04:07] him same God knew that God was with him
[1:04:10] Elijah knew that God was with him when
[1:04:14] you realize that the God of heaven is
[1:04:15] with you ain't no wonder crippled people
[1:04:18] get up and start walking like they never
[1:04:21] walked before
[1:04:22] ain't no wonder blind eyes come open
[1:04:25] when they realize that their creators
[1:04:27] here and then ain't no wonder that sons
[1:04:30] of God are manifested right before you
[1:04:33] well because the god of creation is here
[1:04:41] I'm gonna give you a few more scriptures
[1:04:44] and we're gonna close it down till
[1:04:46] tomorrow night God is with us
[1:04:53] can you echo that God is with us and
[1:05:01] they're surely going to burn out rise up
[1:05:04] enemies that come against you because
[1:05:09] when you start saying that you are
[1:05:10] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:12] Ghost you now have a target on your back
[1:05:14] that every gun of hell is pointed at you
[1:05:19] the Bible said in Deuteronomy 7 and 21
[1:05:22] that thou shall not be a frightened at
[1:05:25] them for the Lord thy God is among you a
[1:05:31] mighty God and terrible and the LORD thy
[1:05:34] God will put out those nations before
[1:05:36] thee my little and little that thou
[1:05:39] man's not consume them at once
[1:05:41] I love how God blends everything out
[1:05:44] perfectly let's the beat's beast of the
[1:05:47] field not the beasts of the field tell
[1:05:50] you what it be Al and I wouldn't want to
[1:05:52] be in land the beach can't hardly stand
[1:05:55] then things I give him over to my
[1:05:57] brother-in-law Davie
[1:05:59] lest the beats the Beast
[1:06:02] get over it drew spit it out
[1:06:05] let the beasts of the field increase
[1:06:07] upon me that's why you love me don't you
[1:06:11] but the LORD thy God said deliver them
[1:06:14] unto thee and shall destroy them with a
[1:06:17] mighty destruction until they be
[1:06:20] destroyed
[1:06:21] you see God knew he wasn't gonna give it
[1:06:25] to you all at one time but he was gonna
[1:06:27] let you conquer it little by little that
[1:06:28] the land would never take you in the
[1:06:31] beasts of the field would not overtake
[1:06:33] you and consume you like God said that
[1:06:37] you're going to destroy him all and
[1:06:38] verse 24 said then he shall deliver
[1:06:42] their kings into thine hands whoo I love
[1:06:47] it and thou shall destroy thy name from
[1:06:50] under heaven and there's so no man be
[1:06:52] able to stand before thee until thou
[1:06:54] hast destroyed them not only are going
[1:06:59] to do are you going to destroy the kings
[1:07:01] that are there that are proclaiming that
[1:07:04] this is their land but you're going to
[1:07:05] wipe their name off of the face of the
[1:07:08] earth not only that name but the name of
[1:07:11] every King under them the Kings sin
[1:07:15] you're going to destroy everything under
[1:07:17] him King fear kicked out King worry King
[1:07:22] unbelief you're going to destroy them
[1:07:29] why because God is with you God's with
[1:07:36] you you don't have to fear God's with
[1:07:42] you
[1:07:48] ah I just share this within and um I'll

[1:07:59] girl Ali is heading somewhere right

[1:08:16] grew up words from a wise man but Ali's
[1:08:29] been going around all week and I I don't
[1:08:31] know how you teach your children but I
[1:08:33] teach my children if you get sick or
[1:08:37] anything comes up don't you start
[1:08:39] talking about that sickness you just
[1:08:40] start rebuking the devil you make all
[1:08:44] your children and and just worship that
[1:08:46] little bit of sickness but that's how I
[1:08:47] do things around my house you just don't

[1:08:50] saying you're he'll start rebuking that
[1:08:54] enemy that's afflict in your body
[1:08:55] because that's what it is it's an enemy
[1:08:57] but Ali's been going around all week
[1:09:00] long for about the last week and a half
[1:09:01] and I have no idea why she's been doing
[1:09:03] it because that not really that she's
[1:09:05] been sick but she's been going around
[1:09:07] saying I refute the devil and she was
[1:09:10] trying to say i rebuked the devil
[1:09:15] we all kind of chuckled about it you
[1:09:18] know and she's going around I refute the

[1:09:51] things that are very near to me and
[1:09:52] they're they're all my heart okay sleep
[1:09:54] I found out you can try to take on sleep
[1:09:57] medicine you won't do
[1:09:59] but God wants you praying for somebody
[1:10:01] you can pray for somebody so if I
[1:10:04] thought of your name this week if I
[1:10:06] thought of somebody's name over in China
[1:10:08] I was calling their name so God had me
[1:10:12] up for purposes this week and I was
[1:10:14] sitting there and I was praying and all
[1:10:16] of a sudden the Lord began to speak to
[1:10:18] me and I begin to think about those
[1:10:19] things that ally been doing I refute the
[1:10:22] devil I refute the devil we are talking
[1:10:25] about and didn't we sister Katie we kind
[1:10:26] of just chuck it about and God kind of

[1:10:39] don't know words unless I have to unless
[1:10:41] I have a dictionary where I could look
[1:10:42] them up so I began to think about this
[1:10:44] if God said that's exactly right I'm
[1:10:46] gonna go look this word up that word
[1:10:48] refute is to deny it is to disapprove
[1:10:51] and prove to be wrong here my little
[1:10:55] four-year-old girl that's getting ready
[1:10:56] to turn five had been walking around all
[1:10:58] week long preaching to me I refute the
[1:11:02] death I refute the devil I refute the
[1:11:05] devil I didn't have a clue what was
[1:11:06] going on but this little girl was going
[1:11:08] around packing the gospel of Jesus
[1:11:11] Christ going around saying I refute the
[1:11:13] devil I refute the devil and in 2020 if
[1:11:16] we're going to believe for miracles
[1:11:18] we're going to have to refute the devil
[1:11:20] he's going to tell us and we're not
[1:11:21] gonna make it but we're going to refute
[1:11:23] the devil we're going to prove him wrong
[1:11:30] come on samba we're going to prove the
[1:11:35] demons of hail that we're going to make
[1:11:37] it we're going to overcome we will see
[1:11:40] miracles we will seek science MA and we
[1:11:43] realize that God is with us
[1:11:47] so devil hear me I refute you in the
[1:11:52] name of Jesus Christ I deny the very
[1:11:57] power of Hell Satan you have come
[1:12:02] against us but I refute you in the name
[1:12:05] of Jesus Christ you are stripped of all
[1:12:08] of your power 2000 years ago and you
[1:12:11] have no legal authority to touch God's
[1:12:14] children whether I'll make that just
[1:12:22] perfect I refute the devil he can
[1:12:29] whisper in your ear just like he's going
[1:12:32] to he can tell you all kinds of things
[1:12:35] but do like my little daughter had
[1:12:38] taught me all week long but it took me
[1:12:41] hours and hours and hours in prayer to
[1:12:44] catch the revelation of what God was
[1:12:46] saying to me out of the mouth of a babe
[1:12:50] deny the devil prove him to be wrong so
[1:12:55] I set out in 2020 with a commission I am
[1:12:58] here to prove the devil wrong and here
[1:13:01] to prove God right let them use this
[1:13:08] let's go
