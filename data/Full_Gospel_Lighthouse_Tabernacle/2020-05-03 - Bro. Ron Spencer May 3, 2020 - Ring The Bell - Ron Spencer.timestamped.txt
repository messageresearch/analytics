[38:55] amen blessed be the name of the Lord I
[38:58] love it when God shows up and snatches
[39:01] us right out of the hand of the enemy a
[39:04] man I pray that you feel what we feel in
[39:09] your homes what we feel here this
[39:11] morning felt like ten thousands of
[39:14] angels have gathered to watch his
[39:16] children worship and that's not just
[39:19] here but that's there in your homes
[39:20] where you're standing at where you're
[39:22] where you're on your feet sitting down
[39:24] where you are there's a Living God that
[39:26] is there that has showed up to watch you
[39:28] and take care of you and minister to you
[39:31] we know that it's here this morning for
[39:33] he told us where two or three are
[39:35] gathered in my name there I will be in
[39:37] the midst of them so we know that he's
[39:39] here and we know that he's working and
[39:41] we're excited to be in the house of the
[39:43] Lord this morning and man we bring you
[39:46] greetings once again trust you all had a
[39:48] wonderful week and and just praying that
[39:51] we're closer to the end of this mess and
[39:54] soon we can reconvene as we want to and
[39:58] it looks like there the government is
[40:00] trying to push and reopen things so we
[40:04] just ask that the Lord would minister to
[40:06] them and help them in their guidance and
[40:07] we want to be back here as soon as
[40:09] possible but we also want to be very
[40:12] aware of the city
[40:13] we're facing so we just pray God's God
[40:16] and so on on every decision that we make
[40:19] also as brother Donny was singing this
[40:21] morning it made me remember so that I
[40:24] can send out a little heads-up remember
[40:26] next weekend is his Mother's Day and so
[40:30] if you if you have your mother and reach
[40:32] out and and send her a happy Mother's
[40:35] Day
[40:36] everyday the Prophet told us every day
[40:38] should be Mother's Day and Father's Day
[40:40] and and not just a certain day of the
[40:42] year or a commercialization of the day
[40:45] but just to remember your mother and I
[40:48] know that there are Saints that are with
[40:49] us that do not have their mother and
[40:51] their mothers done went on went on
[40:54] before them and so we appreciate our
[40:57] mothers and so we just want to make that
[40:58] reminder to you and she don't miss you
[41:01] don't necessarily need flowers but
[41:03] flowers never hurt but you always tell
[41:06] her you love her and just how much she
[41:08] means to you just remember she brought
[41:10] you into this world she could take you
[41:12] away from it if he won't watch yourself
[41:14] so so we want to be remembering these
[41:17] things also want to be remembering
[41:19] brother on this week is a very big week
[41:21] for him this is a week that we've been
[41:23] looking forward to this week he will go
[41:26] go to the doctor to the labs and also on
[41:30] Tuesday they will be doing scan scans on
[41:33] brother Ron's brain and to see if they
[41:37] can if everything is kosher and we
[41:39] believe it is because we found a word
[41:41] that says that by His stripes we are
[41:43] healed and so if the scans are clear
[41:46] they can take them off the steroids
[41:47] which should help with the sugar and so
[41:50] we're very very much praying about that
[41:53] and believing also on May the 11th they
[41:58] will be doing scans of brother Ron's
[42:00] torso which is a very big scan and so
[42:04] just will be remembering these things
[42:05] I'm placing these things before you just
[42:07] so just so you know to be praying about
[42:10] them we've been praying this whole time
[42:11] that they'll be clear and we are
[42:13] expecting that this day on Tuesday and
[42:17] on may 11th that we will see miracles
[42:19] that has been our theme this year that
[42:22] God is with us and we will see miracles
[42:24] and we are believing that that
[42:26] God has showed up and will show out hey
[42:29] man so we're praying that they're all
[42:31] clear and we're just looking forward to
[42:33] the things that God is going to do and
[42:36] God is doing now a man before we go to
[42:39] the word this morning maybe we could
[42:41] sing that song the the power of your
[42:43] love Lord I come to you
[42:45] amen Lord Lord I come to you let my
[42:57] heart be changed renewed
[43:02] flowing from the grace that of
[43:09] [Music]

[43:27] see

[51:01] while he was hungry but when he taken
[51:03] five little biscuits and two fish and
[51:06] fed 5,000 that was more than a man that
[51:09] was God speaking through human lips it's
[51:11] true he was a man that night laying in
[51:14] the back of that little boat out on that
[51:16] stormy sea the little boat was tossed

[54:24] champion forms worlds by his words my
[54:27] champion shows up and the enemy is
[54:29] defeated my enemy the enemy is destroyed
[54:32] and the enemy is defeated when my
[54:36] champion shows up the world right now is
[54:39] looking for a Superman to stop a virus
[54:41] but I have already found my Superman and
[54:44] that is none other than Jesus Christ and
[54:46] if you want to see my champion you can
[54:49] look over into Revelation chapter 1 and
[54:51] you can see my champion standing there
[54:54] with the keys of death and hell in his
[54:57] hand standing in the midst of the church
[54:59] and that champion is standing in the
[55:01] midst of the Church of Laodicea today
[55:04] and he says that I am he that liveth and
[55:07] was dead and behold I am Alive for
[55:10] evermore he cannot die he cannot die
[55:12] again and he said amen to it and I have
[55:16] the keys of hell and of death we started
[55:20] this year off with a theme that God is
[55:22] with us
[55:23] and we will see miracles and I don't
[55:25] know about you but I have seen just that
[55:28] that God has been with us and we have
[55:30] seen miracles God has been with us and
[55:33] every day and every day has been a
[55:35] miracle to be with him we have seen him
[55:39] do mighty acts during this season but no
[55:41] miracle is made without a mess and no
[55:44] miracle is possible without a crisis we
[55:47] look out and look out and we see the
[55:50] preserving of brother
[55:51] our sailors life and all of that and
[55:53] every little detail is a complete
[55:55] miracle that brother Roger is still with
[55:57] us to look out upon our congregation of
[56:00] the guidance of the Holy Ghost in all of
[56:03] their lives and keeping them during this
[56:05] process we look and we think about our
[56:08] pastor brother on his whole process that
[56:11] he's been through of just just giving
[56:14] the things that are laid out in front of
[56:16] him the things that were that were told
[56:18] to us by doctors and we see this process
[56:21] and we see that God has been with us we
[56:24] look back to the dream that brother Tim
[56:26] bruit had and that morning he heard a
[56:28] voice and my mom heard a voice also woke
[56:31] up singing that we will see miracles we
[56:35] will see Giants fall we'll walk on
[56:37] waters
[56:38] brother Tim in another part of the house
[56:41] heard that same hurting him same angels
[56:44] as it were singing we will see miracles
[56:47] and I'm having a dream of buzzards being
[56:50] fed to pigs and and immunotherapy being
[56:54] administered to brother on and it's in
[56:57] it and it did its work and then we look
[56:59] at the weekend that brother Wayne Lawson
[57:02] came and spoke to us on the things that
[57:05] that that were pertaining to us for us
[57:09] to rejoice for joy is coming in the
[57:11] morning and that weekend that weekend
[57:15] when brother Wayne was here our pastor
[57:18] brother on his vision had started to
[57:20] leave and what was happening was Satan
[57:23] was stiffening and tipping his hand that
[57:26] he was coming in for the death blow but
[57:28] what Satan didn't know is that he
[57:30] allowed he allowed and he tipped his
[57:32] hand there was something more than just
[57:35] cancer in the lungs but there was a
[57:38] brain tumor and once again we watched
[57:42] God's show up and we watched doctors as
[57:45] they were able to perform surgeries and
[57:47] remove lemon sized tumors and I say to
[57:52] Satan and all of his hips today that
[57:56] brother on Spencer is still alive
[57:58] so boo devil so take that devil the many
[58:03] might say that we ain't seen God in this
[58:05] but I have seen our champion show up
[58:08] many might say that they haven't seen
[58:10] God in this but I have seen God in this
[58:13] we know that I saw is worth 10 thousand
[58:16] worlds and we have seen soul save during
[58:18] this we have seen many encourage during
[58:21] this whole battle and many encouraged by
[58:24] the strength of brother on of him facing
[58:26] this giant as he went through it we
[58:29] watched as testimonies came forth we
[58:32] have seen God and we have seen miracles
[58:34] and we have watched as this battle has
[58:37] brought forth and brought strength to
[58:41] many and I have seen a mighty conquer
[58:44] stand up and I have said that he is with
[58:49] us and we have seen his miracles who is
[58:52] a church we have seen God so up and we
[58:55] have seen him become the champion of our
[58:58] life we look back at all of it you can
[59:01] look back at your life history and think
[59:03] about the things that God has brought
[59:04] you through and the things that God is
[59:06] from but look behind this pulpit this
[59:09] morning and look to the pastor brother
[59:11] on it look at the things that God has
[59:14] brought him through just his whole life
[59:16] the testimony that we have seen a
[59:19] champion show up in his life when he
[59:22] fell from a 40-foot ladder and he broke
[59:24] every vertebrae down on his back and the
[59:26] doctors told him to prepare that he
[59:28] would never walk again and that night he
[59:31] walked out of the hospital and he's
[59:33] still walking hit by lightning twice bit
[59:37] by a copperhead two strokes a heart
[59:39] attack I'd say that God has been with
[59:41] Brotherhood through a flower that looked
[59:44] like death had worn and he was still
[59:46] preaching on the other side the enemy
[59:49] has tried to kill brother on and we
[59:51] could say that God has been with us that
[59:53] God has been with brother on through a
[59:55] fire and it looked like he would never
[59:57] preach again but he would still come out
[59:59] preaching diagnosed with cancer and he
[1:00:01] still preached two brain surgeries and
[1:00:04] he still preached chemo treatments and
[1:00:06] he's still preached I'd say we have a
[1:00:10] champion
[1:00:11] we have a champion as a savior as a
[1:00:14] deliverer and I'd say we have a champion
[1:00:17] as a pastor for gospel lighthouse and
[1:00:19] today is nineteen weeks today is
[1:00:23] nineteen weeks since the angel of the
[1:00:25] Lord visited our pastor and spoke to him
[1:00:28] and said that if you'll trust me I'll
[1:00:30] use you like never before we have
[1:00:33] watched a champion show up today I'd
[1:00:37] like to introduce you to you more more
[1:00:41] than just a dream of of a heavyweight
[1:00:43] boxer but I'd like to introduce a devil
[1:00:48] destroyer a serpent bruisin champion
[1:00:51] preacher and my dad

[1:03:58] something over the last week just put a
[1:04:00] drive inside of me to to stand here this
[1:04:04] morning the first of the week this week
[1:04:08] we've we were at the doctor's office and
[1:04:11] and by the way I'd like to just preface
[1:04:14] this might be in here yes we're breaking
[1:04:17] a few rules
[1:04:20] but I wanted to be here my doctor I hope
[1:04:24] she doesn't find out that I'm here but I
[1:04:29] I'm practicing safe safe distances so so
[1:04:33] so and I'll go back home and behave

[1:04:40] thank my family for taking care of me
[1:04:42] sister Connie for being such a wonderful
[1:04:44] nurse there's been a lot of good days
[1:04:48] and there's been a lot of difficult days
[1:04:50] and I like to thank them for that I kind
[1:05:00] of feel like this morning now I just put
[1:05:04] some notes down with some very personal
[1:05:06] feelings I don't know what Daniel felt
[1:05:12] like but if he would have been given an
[1:05:17] opportunity to speak from the lines then
[1:05:20] I'd like to give him a voice I don't
[1:05:27] know what Joe would have felt like from
[1:05:30] an ash heap but if he had real believers
[1:05:35] around him and I'm talking about real
[1:05:38] believers that didn't give up and didn't
[1:05:40] think that he had sinned or that was
[1:05:44] with him and that was standing with him
[1:05:47] how he'd like to like to say that God's
[1:05:51] with me David after testify enough of
[1:05:59] holding a bear and a lion by its mane
[1:06:03] and now he's walking off of the hill
[1:06:07] without a rock in his pocket but he knew
[1:06:12] if I can get to the brook if I can get
[1:06:17] down to the brook God's load some rocks
[1:06:19] down there that killed a lot of soldiers
[1:06:23] and Goliath mistake was as he didn't
[1:06:28] kill David before
[1:06:31] he got to the brook and when David
[1:06:35] picked up one he picked up five together
[1:06:40] one fer the Goliath and four for his
[1:06:44] brothers David can't come and speak to
[1:06:49] us today but I can I have been given
[1:07:03] months to live
[1:07:04] by dr. standards a precious doctor came
[1:07:10] in one night while we were in the
[1:07:13] hospital she sat down on my bed and and
[1:07:19] she began to talk to me begin to weep
[1:07:25] with me she said you're between the
[1:07:30] devil and the deep blue sea and I
[1:07:35] reminded her that Jesus was standing in
[1:07:37] that sea she told me that all the
[1:07:43] doctors had convened in a meeting and
[1:07:46] they had come to a consensus and I have
[1:07:51] the most phenomenal doctors I'm just so
[1:07:53] I'm so pleased with them they said they
[1:08:00] are going to do their best for me and
[1:08:05] one particular doctor spoke up and said
[1:08:08] we're going to do our best and we're
[1:08:11] going to give it all we've got
[1:08:12] and his God will take care of him he has
[1:08:23] brother Wayne Lawson was here
[1:08:25] and Satan tipped his hand and for those
[1:08:32] that are looking for the end miracle
[1:08:34] don't miss the miracles that are
[1:08:36] happening in between because there's got
[1:08:40] to be a phenomenal amount of miracles to
[1:08:42] happen
[1:08:43] the in miracle for me to ring the bell
[1:08:47] God's got to keep me he's got to be with
[1:08:52] me and I want to stand and report he has
[1:08:58] where the Wayne law suit would come and
[1:09:01] preach and I would go blind on my left
[1:09:04] side which continues to remain and I
[1:09:08] feel kind of like Jacob with a thigh
[1:09:12] that that the angel had touched
[1:09:15] I believe that Satan touched his hand he
[1:09:19] tipped his hand and came in for the
[1:09:22] killing blow and we knew something was
[1:09:27] wrong something was going very bad wrong
[1:09:29] in the next 24 hours we would find out
[1:09:33] that we had three brain tumors and one
[1:09:35] was the size of a lemon and was bursting
[1:09:38] and at the end of that week they would
[1:09:41] take that out then the next couple
[1:09:45] weekends we would would go back to the
[1:09:47] hospital again and our lungs would be
[1:09:50] filled with with with blood clots in her
[1:09:54] legs and they would do a surgery and
[1:09:57] then at the end of that week we would
[1:09:59] have gamma ray gamma knife ray surgery
[1:10:05] again all of that weakened our body it
[1:10:13] seemed like every week we'd get up we'd
[1:10:15] get bad news but God's been with us
[1:10:19] through every every phase of it last
[1:10:23] night my my sugar went to an
[1:10:26] unregistered amount but I'd like to
[1:10:31] report to you as I stand here in the
[1:10:36] heat of this journey with kind of
[1:10:40] limited strength something's driving me
[1:10:43] this morning to walk with Jesus like
[1:10:47] never before
[1:10:50] I got up as I do every morning and open
[1:10:53] my devotional book and my devotional
[1:10:56] book said it's another day to walk with
[1:11:00] Jesus and I thought how fitting that it
[1:11:03] is fitting that it is that in my first
[1:11:07] couple of quotes walking with Jesus I
[1:11:11] believe God will give me strength for it
[1:11:13] for about 30 minutes if you could just
[1:11:15] help me just for a moment a couple
[1:11:19] scriptures that I want to read with you
[1:11:21] and I will just skip some scriptures if
[1:11:23] if you will just bear with me in Isaiah
[1:11:28] 53 who hath believed our report and and
[1:11:38] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:11:41] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:11:44] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[1:11:46] ground and he hath no form nor
[1:11:48] comeliness and when we shall see him
[1:11:50] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:11:53] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[1:11:57] man of sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:12:02] he's acquainted with where I'm standing
[1:12:05] just now brother Donnie as if we hid it
[1:12:09] were our faces from him he was despised
[1:12:12] and we esteemed him not
[1:12:14] and surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:12:17] carried our sorrows and we did esteem
[1:12:22] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:12:24] afflicted that's the scripture that the
[1:12:30] doctor quoted to me that night
[1:12:32] but he that he was wounded for our
[1:12:36] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:12:42] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:12:48] was upon him and with His stripes and
[1:12:56] not only remind us as believers
[1:13:00] but I want to remind the devil with his
[1:13:04] stripes we are healed Jesus would pray
[1:13:15] these prayer this prayer our Father
[1:13:18] which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:13:24] that kingdom come Thy will be done in
[1:13:28] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[1:13:33] day our daily bread as we forgive our
[1:13:36] debts and we forgive our debtors lead us
[1:13:42] not into temptation but deliver us from
[1:13:44] evil for thine is the kingdom and the
[1:13:48] power and the glory forever amen Romans
[1:14:00] chapter 4 in verse 17 and this is after
[1:14:05] the blood of Jesus Christ is applied I
[1:14:08] have made thee a father of many nations
[1:14:12] before him him whom he believed even God
[1:14:18] who quickeneth the dead and calleth
[1:14:22] those things which be not as though they
[1:14:24] were who against hope believed in hope
[1:14:30] that he might become the father many
[1:14:33] nations according to that which was
[1:14:37] spoken so shall I see be and being not
[1:14:42] weak in faith but consider not his own
[1:14:45] body now dead when he was about a
[1:14:49] hundred years old neither the deadness
[1:14:52] of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the
[1:14:56] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:14:59] strong giving glory to God I'm reading
[1:15:03] about more than a man four thousand
[1:15:05] years ago
[1:15:11] I'm reading about you that are
[1:15:14] struggling with cancer that has been
[1:15:16] given up you that have all kind of
[1:15:19] diseases today across the world that the
[1:15:23] devil says you don't have long to live
[1:15:26] I'm reading about Jude it's not about
[1:15:29] having faith in doctors though we're
[1:15:31] thankful for them and we're thankful for
[1:15:34] what they're doing for us we're thankful
[1:15:36] for the medicine God heals through all
[1:15:38] of those things but when they've done
[1:15:40] all that they can do when they come to
[1:15:44] the end of their rope God is not weak
[1:15:50] he's got us by the hand he'll take us
[1:15:55] through when there's nowhere else to
[1:15:57] look
[1:16:02] not even cancer will stand before you
[1:16:08] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:16:14] had promised he was able also to perform
[1:16:23] we're reminded that God is not a God
[1:16:26] that lasts man gets in crisis I have
[1:16:34] been in a crisis I have come to this
[1:16:39] spot to where that then I can't lean on
[1:16:46] man I've got great friends if phenomenal
[1:16:53] friends that are praying for me and they
[1:16:56] can pray for me and they can say I'm
[1:17:00] standing with you and I'm phenomenally
[1:17:03] thrilled that great men great audiences
[1:17:08] are standing with me in prayer but there
[1:17:12] is a king of kings there is a Lord above
[1:17:17] lords
[1:17:18] that has taken my case he has taken my
[1:17:24] case standing in another round people
[1:17:30] are watching
[1:17:32] strengthening there's a great cloud of
[1:17:34] witnesses but sometimes we're reminded
[1:17:39] that we're standing along with Jesus
[1:17:44] it's not that Jesus is with me it's um
[1:17:50] with him I was being taken to an
[1:18:08] operating from one operating room to
[1:18:11] another with a with an apparatus on my
[1:18:17] head with a pain level of ten and they
[1:18:27] had already given me three shots and I
[1:18:29] knew that I was going to be enough
[1:18:31] chamber for three hours and it's me and
[1:18:37] Jesus or I'm with him
[1:18:45] the transport man was transporting me
[1:18:48] down the hall and I begin to pray and as
[1:18:55] I prayed I said Lord we have been
[1:19:00] reminded by your prophet that we can be
[1:19:06] cycle breakers and then the cycle of
[1:19:11] melanoma which is known to be the
[1:19:14] fastest developing cancer once it
[1:19:18] develops and gets inside and becomes
[1:19:20] stage four it just begin to stack attack
[1:19:23] organs and just attach that it loves the
[1:19:26] brain it just goes to the brain it just
[1:19:30] loves the cells of the brain and there's
[1:19:32] actually a communication between the
[1:19:34] brain the lungs I thought about my
[1:19:41] children my grandchildren the church
[1:19:45] here the bright around the world and I
[1:19:49] began to pray the Lord let me be the the
[1:19:52] cycle breaker that my children walk did
[1:19:55] it my grandchildren won't get it my
[1:19:57] church the bright around the world if I
[1:20:01] have to suffer through this let me be a
[1:20:04] cycle break up and I prayed that in the
[1:20:09] name of Jesus Christ and the transport
[1:20:13] men said and he just in a very quiet
[1:20:16] tone he said that's a prettiest prayer
[1:20:19] I've ever heard
[1:20:26] I'll tell you you know when to pray when
[1:20:29] you get in the spot sometimes it's just
[1:20:39] it's just comforting it's comforting for
[1:20:45] someone to say a kind word it to you and
[1:20:49] a very at a very crisis moment a doctor
[1:20:54] to take you by the hand nurse to take
[1:20:57] you by the hand and say I'm with you
[1:20:59] a preacher to take you by the hand but
[1:21:08] I'm reminded that if we can touch Jesus
[1:21:16] we're touching more than a man we're
[1:21:20] touching Almighty God forgive me for
[1:21:24] sharing some of those very private
[1:21:26] moments brother Branham reminded us over
[1:21:33] and over again I'm not your healer I'm
[1:21:38] no more than a man no more than I'm a
[1:21:41] divine Savior in my limited lifetime the
[1:21:49] limited gifts that I have been given in
[1:21:51] my life I've always always had a thing
[1:21:59] that I look at that jesus said I can do
[1:22:04] nothing except my father shows me first
[1:22:07] I've always been reminded of those
[1:22:10] quotes that brother Branham said I'm not
[1:22:12] the healer I was only there when those
[1:22:15] things happened standing in prayer lines
[1:22:19] all across the world I've saw phenomenal
[1:22:21] miracles happen take place I myself of
[1:22:25] that phenomenal miracles take place but
[1:22:29] once again even with difficult tests
[1:22:34] laying right in front of us
[1:22:36] I felt inspired to come this morning to
[1:22:40] remind us that I want to smack the devil
[1:22:44] in the mouth before he gets the chance
[1:22:48] to smack me over the next couple of
[1:22:51] weeks so I want to remind him that God
[1:22:57] still the healer no matter what test
[1:23:00] results print if the cancer is worse God
[1:23:05] still my healer if it has spread through
[1:23:09] my body
[1:23:10] God still my healer it wasn't the angel
[1:23:15] that brought up cancer it was brother
[1:23:18] Branham that brought up tents even
[1:23:21] cancer jesus said I am the way I am the
[1:23:28] door I am the love I am reminded that
[1:23:32] Abraham was told by God himself I have
[1:23:37] made thee a father of many nations and
[1:23:41] Abraham took him at his word the
[1:23:46] scripture says that now faith is the
[1:23:50] substance of things hoped for the
[1:23:53] evidence of things not seen
[1:23:59] hopeful even take us will not even take
[1:24:02] us but so far their spots to where that
[1:24:06] hope can't take you
[1:24:08] it takes a personal revelation of the
[1:24:12] word of God to hold us brother man says
[1:24:17] you're here to fulfill it to walking
[1:24:21] conscious of fear walk unconscious of
[1:24:24] criticism walk unconscious of the world
[1:24:28] walk us wise you walk in Christ walk
[1:24:32] with him not paying any attention to the
[1:24:35] right hand just keep moving on if
[1:24:39] something comes up in the church walk
[1:24:41] with God
[1:24:44] walk with God hope at nineteen is knows
[1:24:49] nothing to turn around for this is candy
[1:24:52] compared to what's coming in a
[1:24:54] Tribulation Period something comes into
[1:25:00] the church walk with God if sickness
[1:25:02] strikes you walk with God it's a
[1:25:05] beautiful quote as long as sickness
[1:25:07] hasn't struck you but when you are in
[1:25:12] the heat of the battle walk with God
[1:25:18] I spoke with brother Danny Stephen this
[1:25:25] morning he was one of the guys that
[1:25:31] found out it was a secret that I would
[1:25:32] speak today he didn't know it until they
[1:25:37] actually called me and I shared it with
[1:25:39] him because I figured he couldn't tell
[1:25:41] nobody else this morning right quickly
[1:25:43] but I just asked him a question I said
[1:25:51] I'm going to the pulpit this morning I
[1:25:56] said wonder how many wonder how many
[1:26:01] preachers had stood in a pulpit with
[1:26:04] stage-four brain and lung cancer with
[1:26:09] the difficulty sitting right in front of
[1:26:11] them I want to I wonder what the
[1:26:14] conversation is in hell
[1:26:22] I wonder what the conversation is in
[1:26:27] hell we're still a witness that God's a
[1:26:37] miracle working God if sickness strikes
[1:26:49] you walk with God
[1:26:53] if your neighbor don't like you walk
[1:26:57] with God
[1:27:00] just keep walking with God but the
[1:27:04] random must have had one of those
[1:27:05] neighbors like that
[1:27:07] Enoch one day walk like that you know
[1:27:12] what he done he walked all the way home
[1:27:15] with God he got so far up the road till
[1:27:20] he didn't walk back home he didn't want
[1:27:22] to go come back anymore
[1:27:26] with you with walk with God the doctor
[1:27:30] says that you're going to die walk with
[1:27:34] God the doctor says you can't get well
[1:27:41] walk with God just walk with God
[1:27:49] that's all for God has promised I'll
[1:27:53] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:27:56] him I'll be with you to the end of the
[1:28:00] world he took an oath by that covenant
[1:28:05] that he give you that he he'd confirm it
[1:28:10] just walk with God then you're going to
[1:28:15] have your ups and downs I've been
[1:28:19] reading these quotes for 30 years
[1:28:22] although that was training for this
[1:28:25] morning you'll have your ups and downs
[1:28:31] don't worry
[1:28:33] census of a sermon last Thanksgiving
[1:28:35] don't worry you got to go through your
[1:28:39] briar patches and over some sharp drops
[1:28:42] and over Bluffs down the hillsides up
[1:28:47] through mountains over waters but walk
[1:28:51] with God yes sir there's so many hills
[1:28:54] to climb fall upward you've heard that
[1:28:57] old song but but now little it'll seem
[1:29:02] when you get there get to the end of the
[1:29:04] way just look at it all that's been look
[1:29:09] back at your footprints they won't seem
[1:29:14] to be very much it won't be very much
[1:29:18] Abraham considered he's not his own body
[1:29:21] now dead neither the deadness of Sarah's
[1:29:24] womb he didn't think about that he
[1:29:30] didn't consider it it wasn't even
[1:29:32] brought into the understanding he didn't
[1:29:36] even consider it at all these are big
[1:29:38] statements he didn't even consider it at
[1:29:41] all
[1:29:44] he just considered what God said and he
[1:29:50] went on is it a little bit of a theme
[1:29:57] ring the bell it is told to me at the
[1:30:02] end of the journey if I can make the end
[1:30:04] of the journey in the natural realm
[1:30:07] there's a bell that rings it says you
[1:30:09] don't have chance ourselves no more
[1:30:11] I want to ring it today I'd like to ring
[1:30:22] it today
[1:30:28] there's a bell that's ring before every
[1:30:31] champion Andrew didn't know what I was
[1:30:33] going to say I didn't know what he was
[1:30:35] going to say there's a bell that's run
[1:30:39] before every heavyweight champions
[1:30:43] battle now he can be the champion for
[1:30:47] years hold that title for years but
[1:30:52] there is there's always somebody that's
[1:30:55] a challenger and that challenger wants
[1:30:59] to meet now if he's qualified to meet
[1:31:03] and they begin to set the ground rules
[1:31:06] out and they'll a such a time and a
[1:31:08] place and and such a reward then
[1:31:11] training begins to happen whether it's
[1:31:13] months or weeks or a year but there
[1:31:17] comes a time that that that champion is
[1:31:20] sitting there as a champion to remain
[1:31:24] champion he's got to answer the bell
[1:31:29] sometimes we can come to thee to the to
[1:31:32] the journey of the word and feel like
[1:31:35] we're rapture ready
[1:31:36] but between here and the rapture they're
[1:31:40] still going to be battles they're still
[1:31:43] going to be confrontations but you've
[1:31:45] got to be ready and prepared to answer
[1:31:49] the bell lack of preparation will get
[1:31:53] you it but God says I'll never put more
[1:31:58] on you than you can breath we're
[1:32:05] reminded that a faith that cannot be
[1:32:07] trusted
[1:32:09] cannot be tested cannot be trusted we're
[1:32:15] not holding on to some emotional story
[1:32:19] some emotional feeling some emotional
[1:32:23] event some relic kissing of a statue
[1:32:27] we're not we're not even trusting our
[1:32:32] five senses
[1:32:34] because their five senses will take us
[1:32:38] in many directions it'll take us spots
[1:32:42] that will only cause us to get
[1:32:44] disappointed there will be days to where
[1:32:47] we feel like that everything is going to
[1:32:51] be alright there are days that we feel
[1:32:54] like that we're in the bottom of the
[1:32:56] Great Gulf and we can't live through the
[1:32:59] day but we're not trusting that the
[1:33:06] scripture says that every Sun that
[1:33:08] cometh to God must be tested some say oh
[1:33:12] oh if I could only have brother Branham
[1:33:15] here of my favorite preacher here maybe
[1:33:18] if I lived way back there similar
[1:33:20] another I can only go back you see we've
[1:33:26] got a word that lays in front of us and
[1:33:29] goddess gave us the greatest weapon that
[1:33:32] he could give us is his work and it must
[1:33:37] become personal revelation and inspired
[1:33:41] to come off of the pages of the word and
[1:33:44] not just go through your lips as empty
[1:33:47] words that we pour out against the devil
[1:33:50] but there must be an emphasis of
[1:33:53] inspiration an emphasis above the lift
[1:33:57] like an eagle that will go into the air
[1:34:00] and be reminded that I'm a champion
[1:34:02] overtop of a storm and make the
[1:34:07] challenge of the hour we must keep
[1:34:12] herself in a certain atmosphere and stay
[1:34:14] prepared stay focused and there's only
[1:34:19] one that can make the way I'm not
[1:34:22] looking to brother branham and I'm not
[1:34:25] saying that with no disrespect at all I
[1:34:28] thank God for this message I preached it
[1:34:31] for all of these years now but I'm
[1:34:34] looking to Jesus the author and the
[1:34:37] finisher of our faith
[1:34:42] I'm not looking to great friends I'm
[1:34:44] looking to Jesus I'm looking to be an
[1:34:48] overcomer of this trial realize that I'm
[1:35:03] a final runner in the race like you are
[1:35:08] we're final runners toward the rapture
[1:35:21] I'm reminded that God is God and Satan
[1:35:25] is Satan if you don't believe in a devil
[1:35:31] brother Brendan said when I first got
[1:35:33] started I run headlong into him every
[1:35:36] day don't tell me there's no devil
[1:35:40] because I know better I have to fight
[1:35:43] with him every day I know there's a
[1:35:46] devil but you must be trained when you
[1:35:51] meet him not trained in philosophy not
[1:35:56] trained in education but trained by the
[1:35:59] Holy Spirit God's power in his word to
[1:36:04] make it manifest it know your enemy
[1:36:08] I think it's one of the greatest
[1:36:12] absences sometimes as we underestimate
[1:36:15] our enemy know your enemy oh what a
[1:36:24] cruel thing that he is there's no man on
[1:36:31] earth that is God certainly not we're
[1:36:36] all human beings and never everyone born
[1:36:39] in sin shapen iniquity come to the world
[1:36:42] speaking lies but as we've been through
[1:36:46] it's so plainly to show that God once
[1:36:51] lived above this creature because of sin
[1:36:55] then he lived with his creature in the
[1:36:59] form of a body Jesus Christ put his tent
[1:37:03] with us dwell with us made flesh with us
[1:37:07] to suffer sin and pain and agony and
[1:37:09] things to do then he sanctioned a church
[1:37:14] that he might dwell in so it was God
[1:37:17] above God with and God in us and Jesus
[1:37:23] says and at that day that you'll know
[1:37:26] that I'm in the father and the father in
[1:37:29] me and I in you and you and me
[1:37:32] see there if God's working through and
[1:37:35] when a person is so completely yielded
[1:37:38] to the Holy Spirit in speaking it is not
[1:37:41] the person speaking and he said I know
[1:37:44] this by experience
[1:37:52] he said the contest our contest is a
[1:37:56] test of strength and he said we have we
[1:38:02] have we have the test of strength the
[1:38:06] indian used to put a fire and they would
[1:38:08] put a so many man on the end of a rope
[1:38:11] and so many men on the end of this rope
[1:38:13] and Uggla of war and the contest of
[1:38:17] strength would pull and loose the enemy
[1:38:19] losing party across the fire and we know
[1:38:23] there's so many things we know we know
[1:38:26] there's many things and we could base
[1:38:28] this upon a few minutes of the contest
[1:38:31] but I want to speak for a few minutes
[1:38:34] quickly on the greatest contest that's
[1:38:36] between the church and Satan the great
[1:38:41] strength of Satan and we want to speak
[1:38:45] of this great strength of God in his
[1:38:48] church and the great contest that's
[1:38:53] going on for many years it started in
[1:38:56] heaven and Satan was kicked in the earth
[1:38:58] and then became became the enemy to
[1:39:02] God's people and he's used all of his
[1:39:05] strength and strategy to pull God's
[1:39:07] people across the fires and into the
[1:39:10] fires we know who has the most power God
[1:39:17] does and when God gave his people the
[1:39:21] best thing that he can combat Satan with
[1:39:23] is his word is because God's Word and
[1:39:30] and who's stronger and who's stronger
[1:39:34] than God the Word of God and the word
[1:39:38] becomes our strength and God in His
[1:39:40] Church becomes the strength of God to
[1:39:44] pull Satan
[1:39:45] to his own fires that he has made he's
[1:39:52] made him against you he's made them
[1:39:54] against me and God in you will pull
[1:40:00] cancer right into the fire in my name
[1:40:07] you'll cast out Devils people who do not
[1:40:13] believe in demons in this day till my
[1:40:16] opinion is no your enemy
[1:40:19] know your enemy trained the contest
[1:40:21] you're going to have to meet him trained
[1:40:28] trained just gonna skip a few thoughts
[1:40:34] if I can brother Branham says I've I've
[1:40:40] watched
[1:40:49] as he fights Luke 8:45 says this and
[1:40:56] Jesus turned and said who touched me it
[1:41:02] won't be but a couple more moments now
[1:41:06] I've got a lot to say but I'm feeling a
[1:41:09] little weary who touched me when all
[1:41:19] denied Peter and they'd that with the
[1:41:22] master master the multitude throng the
[1:41:27] impress thee saying who touched me and
[1:41:32] Jesus said somebody touched me and I
[1:41:38] perceived that virture has gone out of
[1:41:42] me
[1:41:49] and the woman saw that she was not hid
[1:41:53] she came trembling falling down before
[1:41:56] him and declared unto Him and before all
[1:41:59] the people for what caused that she
[1:42:01] touched him a lot of people touched him
[1:42:05] I touched him I would have rubbed wanted
[1:42:12] to rub shoulders with him I'm honest I'm
[1:42:16] being very honest with you
[1:42:18] I wouldn't have been ashamed I wouldn't
[1:42:21] have been ashamed a lot of people do it
[1:42:23] in private believe but but they but
[1:42:24] they're different people in public a lot
[1:42:27] of people are one way in church or one
[1:42:29] way in a home or maybe one way to watch
[1:42:33] a service like this but they they want
[1:42:35] to be or they really want to be a
[1:42:37] Christian and they want to be identified
[1:42:39] with Jesus but they're in a different
[1:42:41] way other way
[1:42:42] cancers are bad is a bad thing to fight
[1:42:45] but sins much worse we have a nation
[1:42:49] that don't have answers and we have a
[1:42:50] nation that's everybody's proclaiming we
[1:42:54] want the Cure we want to get a get a
[1:42:55] cure I'll tell you Jesus is secure I'll
[1:43:00] tell you I'll tell you the cure for sin
[1:43:02] I'll tell you that the cure for Kogan 19
[1:43:05] I'll tell you the cure because we're
[1:43:08] headed to a to a place where he's pink
[1:43:11] and he'll bring perfect peace and
[1:43:14] there'll be no sickness there we'll live
[1:43:18] in perfect harmony and I'm not looking
[1:43:21] to a president or to a king or to a lab
[1:43:26] I'm looking to Jesus and when this woman
[1:43:31] left her home the doctors couldn't do no
[1:43:33] more for her and it'd been that way a
[1:43:35] long time she'd decided if I can touch
[1:43:41] the hem of His garment I know I be made
[1:43:44] well how many thousands touched him I
[1:43:50] didn't get that touch just to touch and
[1:43:56] her body was clean
[1:44:00] I'm thinking even now and if you would
[1:44:03] just give me a couple more moments this
[1:44:07] church has made this message the church
[1:44:13] has made this message a place toward
[1:44:17] Jesus can feel comfortable that all of
[1:44:22] his work can be preached and we don't
[1:44:25] have to pick through his word this is a
[1:44:28] church that believes in the the full
[1:44:32] open word were people of the open book
[1:44:37] where Jesus came down in this generation
[1:44:40] with this nail-scarred hands and and it
[1:44:43] was revealed 2000 years ago as Jesus
[1:44:49] would be after the resurrection and he
[1:44:51] would tell his disciples touch me handle
[1:44:54] me handle me I'm proof a mother I'm
[1:44:59] alive and I'm not dead no more handle me
[1:45:04] listen through the Dark Ages the
[1:45:08] Catholic Church held the precious Word
[1:45:11] of God away from the people and maybe
[1:45:14] priests would stand there and give them
[1:45:16] a scripture and interpret it for them
[1:45:18] and they tried to believe it and
[1:45:20] overcome it with the best of their
[1:45:22] hearts but in this day this message was
[1:45:26] revealed not a partial word but it was
[1:45:31] totally restored by the mainly angel
[1:45:35] himself and a prophet would say you're
[1:45:38] not feeding on the mind of a man but
[1:45:41] you're feeding on the body word of the
[1:45:44] son of man take the book and eat the
[1:45:48] book handle me handle me many touch the
[1:45:59] Bible and don't get it many read the
[1:46:04] book and don't get it but may the word
[1:46:08] so become alive in your heart
[1:46:11] may it become so alive in your heart
[1:46:15] until the life of Christ that is in that
[1:46:19] word live on the inside of you may it so
[1:46:25] live on the inside of you there was one
[1:46:29] tree in the garden that they were
[1:46:31] forbidden to eat but the other one they
[1:46:34] were they were told it eat of that Jesus
[1:46:37] what's the tree of life he's still the
[1:46:41] Tree of Life if this be my last sermon
[1:46:45] don't you never lose your focus and get
[1:46:49] your eyes on man or get your eyes on
[1:46:52] this world there's nothing to turn back
[1:46:56] to you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ
[1:47:00] he's the author he's the finisher of our
[1:47:04] faith
[1:47:07] there's man like him it's beyond our
[1:47:14] senses it's beyond what we can see
[1:47:18] tastes
[1:47:19] Mellor he'll
[1:47:27] you say I went through some things I'm
[1:47:31] sure you have each of us have a story it
[1:47:39] will not be by our strength brother
[1:47:45] Donnie you have fought the fight that
[1:47:47] I'm fighting many the sets in this
[1:47:53] church had fought the fight every
[1:47:58] thought is different every battle is
[1:48:03] different whether it's depression
[1:48:06] whether it's whatever it is but it's not
[1:48:15] greater than God 12 years ago I was
[1:48:25] released from the hospital and it was
[1:48:29] said that I was saying when I came out
[1:48:32] of a coma Blue Devil but I'd like to
[1:48:40] continue to say that today I went back
[1:48:48] and I went back and did a little
[1:48:51] research and there was another fighter
[1:48:57] he wasn't in our in our realms but they
[1:49:01] called him the greatest fighter that
[1:49:03] fought in our generations his name was
[1:49:07] Muhammad Ali and it was known for his
[1:49:11] talking in the ring and George Foreman
[1:49:16] said that they got up real close one
[1:49:20] time and and he said he was right in
[1:49:23] Muhammad Ali's ear and he said I had
[1:49:27] give him everything that I had and he
[1:49:31] was still standing
[1:49:33] and he said Olli whispered in my ear is
[1:49:38] that the best you got I'd like to
[1:49:53] whisper in the devil's ear and you
[1:50:02] that's in a great trial even this
[1:50:04] morning I want to help you to whisper in
[1:50:07] the devil's ear is that the best you got
[1:50:18] brother onder's had not put fear in your
[1:50:21] heart do you know what you have been
[1:50:22] through yeah but you see it ate me
[1:50:29] because there's a lot of days I couldn't
[1:50:32] have lived through already but the God
[1:50:35] inside of me said I'll never leave you
[1:50:41] I'll never forsake you I'll be with you
[1:50:46] to the end of the world yea though I
[1:50:49] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:50:51] death I fear no evil for thou art with
[1:50:53] me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me

[1:53:33] Laurie hi
[1:53:39] Mistral is marching on
[1:53:46] and it has been his truth that has
[1:53:49] marched us this far and it'll take us
[1:53:51] all the way through it has been none
[1:53:55] other than the Spirit of the Lord has
[1:53:56] brought us safely thus far has brought
[1:53:59] brother on this far and I believe that
[1:54:02] he's a God that isn't just backing off
[1:54:04] of his promises but he's a God that
[1:54:06] finishes the work and I'm believing with
[1:54:09] everything that's within me that the
[1:54:11] same champion that our pastor preached
[1:54:14] about today is answering the call to the
[1:54:17] Challenger he's not just whispering in
[1:54:20] our ears but we're whispering back to
[1:54:23] him from a living God it's saying is
[1:54:26] that all you got
[1:54:28] if Satan throws all that he's got if he
[1:54:31] throws all that he's got that God and
[1:54:33] God's children he still don't have
[1:54:35] enough because you got to remember at
[1:54:38] the end of the day that Satan is nothing
[1:54:41] but a tool in God's hands I was sent
[1:54:44] this quote this morning said prophet
[1:54:49] speaking about Legion he said that I
[1:54:50] thought with a complete surrender to the
[1:54:52] devil
[1:54:54] can give man maybe five times the
[1:54:56] strength
[1:54:57] what would a complete center surrender
[1:55:00] to God do to a man what would it do to a
[1:55:03] that's weakened body and can't
[1:55:05] walk or something if we could just
[1:55:07] completely yield to the Holy Ghost and
[1:55:10] give us super strength to rise in the
[1:55:13] name cause greater is He that is in you
[1:55:16] than he that's in the world the strength
[1:55:18] in God that's in you is greater than any
[1:55:20] affliction can come upon you there is
[1:55:23] nothing that can overtake you that can
[1:55:25] supersede you because you are full of a
[1:55:28] superpower and that superpower is the
[1:55:31] Holy Spirit that dominates your life if
[1:55:33] you're a Christian and that power of the
[1:55:36] Holy Spirit is that that is dominating
[1:55:39] the life the body of Jesus Christ we
[1:55:43] give God glory so we say take that devil
[1:55:47] you thought you had him you thought you
[1:55:50] had him with cancer you thought you had
[1:55:51] him my brain surgeries you thought you
[1:55:53] had him with tumors but God still God

[1:56:06] heard from a man that Satan swore that
[1:56:10] he would kill Boudewijn a sing a song

[1:56:17] us
