We Gather here today this is not a a time of necessary um necessarily um sadness on our hearts um it's it's it's sadness that we've lost a friend but we recognize that we've not lost our brother because we know exactly where he can be found at but we've come to celebrate the life of our brother Bill Hinkle today and as we reflect on his journey we remember he was a devoted Deacon a devoted husband a cherished friend and a man whose heart overflowed with love and Bill's life was marked by his unwavering faith and commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord Jesus Christ was highest place in brother Bill's life the Lord guided his every step and shaped his character and as I was thinking and reflecting over brother Bill's life these scriptures came to me from Psalms chapter 63 David said oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee and you begin to think about brother Bill Hinkle's life in a in a hole I begin to think about the value of Life about how that this man's life had changed every person that is here and that is represented and I'd say that the building couldn't hold how many people brother Bill actually ministered to and his life affected because many of his friends have already went on beyond the scene but we know and recognize as David would say here that thy loving kindness is better than life and life is such a very powerful powerful thing and we recognize that God is the author of life life is what controls us and we are known by the life that we live and it's been said that your life speaks so loud that I can't hear your testimony so therefore it's a it's it's better to live a sermon than it is to preach one and Bill brother Bill definitely did that the life you live shows what character that you are because the life that you live it always builds your character and the life that you live it reflects where you are or where you are somewhere else is from and you what you are doing in this life is you are reflecting the dimension that you're from and we can look at brother Bill's life throughout all of his life we can look back and you can see that he proved he was a Christian by his life by the way that he lived by the way that he was an example and I believe that is something that our brother Bill did exceptionally well he lived from where he came from eternity by how one lives and preaches life sermon it is the evidence of where his Allegiance lie and I'll say that brother Bill preached his sermon well brother Bill's life exemplified the profound impact faith can have not just in words but in actions that reflect the love that he had for others he was a true pillar in our church community and in our local community bill was not only a man of Faith but a man of works his generosity knew no bounds and his giving heart touched the lives of many in a world that often measures success in grand gestures brother Bill showed us that the small acts of kindness done with love are the ones that leave an enduring Legacy as David would say thy loving kindness is better than life and there must be many interpretations to life because the life that we live here there are many Sorrows there are many heartaches there's there's many there's many things that come by our way where life gets so bad that sometimes begin to people begin to take their own life and contemplate different things and but we recognize that David wasn't necessarily talking about the life that he lived and that's what Paul would say in Galatians 2 and 20 that the life that I now live I live in Christ Jesus so the life that David was speaking about not wasn't necessarily this humanistic side but we recognize that David was speaking about eternal life which is Zoe which is God's own life and we recognize when you we that are Bible Believers we recognize that in the beginning that Adam was made a promise that he would not die and that as long as he did not touch of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Adam had no idea what death was about but because Adam's failure in the in the Garden of Eden all men had to come to this appointment because God had breathed the very Breath of Life into Adam and that is the same exact thing that brother Bill had breathed into him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he attained what is the greatest achievement that there in there ever can be and ever will be be attained is to be a real Born Again Son of God and brother Bill did that with great honor but Adam was told that the day that he would eat of that tree of knowledge thereof that day he was going to die but if you study history out it tells us that that Adam lived to be a 930 years old but he didn't just lose his life when he ate it but he what did he lose he lost the power of life he lost the virtue of life he lost the quality of life I'll say it like this he lost the original life but the one that came and picked brother Bill and chose a a pre ious flower for his garden the other day the Redeemer of life he came and restored and gave life to all Humanity that wants to receive it and I'll say that brother Bill's life exemplified and was an expression of only one person and that is our Lord Jesus Christ when you look at his life as a husband you see Christ in it when you looked at his life as a friend you seen Christ in it and anybody that ever met bill they recognized that bill was larger than life life is so powerful if you do not understand what I speak about today I want you to know that it's more than just a shell that is setting here today it's about life it's about more than what you see in the room today life is only knowing Jesus Christ and if you don't know him you're not living but life is such a powerful thing that even when you see a pregnant mother that that mother that is carrying that child though you may not see that child in the physical form yet but the life of that little child controls that mother in such a way it controls her appetite it controls how she gets up in the morning it controls everything about her it's just like brother Bill's life he was he was the life on the inside of him was controlled by another world it was controlled by the life that was leading him in life and I'll say that brother Bill was a walk in Bible he was a walk in Bible many times preaching sermons here as a as a young man he would finish my scriptures before I would ever get done with him he would finish my thoughts and I would say as a young man brother Bill taught me how to be a real Christian these are the kind of funerals that a pastor dreams about because there's not enough words that you can say about a man like this but yet it would take all day to begin to express how much that he that he truly meant to this community and to this church and to think that where we were 50 years ago as a church at Full Gospel Lighthouse that the church that you see today it's more than a building but this Church started in brother Bill's basement 50 years ago in 1973 and we see how the Lord has blessed that and brother Bill his his the value of his life can never be estimated and it can never be it can never be expressed in the way of as as a human could but we look at the tapestry of brother Bill's life and there are those rare individuals who play a pivotable role in supporting and strengthening the leaders and Bill HL was that man he Stood Beside and supported brother Homer Frasier he empowered brother Ronald Spencer and empowered all of those around him and he made the entire spiritual journey of Full Gospel Lighthouse richer and more vibrant I was looking through the scriptures and I I was thinking about scriptures that would pertain to brother Bill and Paul wrote this in the letter to Timothy about the office of a deacon in ver chapter 3 verse 13 of the first book of Timothy Paul said for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus and when Paul says that about a man that he a purchased to himself a good degree that word in the Greek it means to take a step it is as of a stare and the meaning of that is the going up of a higher or taking an additional step in dignity in honor and and or in standing and I would say that brother Bill's life was one that was purchased of a different degree of a stepping higher he left behind all of the things that he was to take a step higher into Christ Jesus and as we contemplate the value of life let us remember that it's not about the length of our days but it's the death of our impact brother Bill touched every one of our lives from young to old there's probably not another man in this building besides brother Ron that could say that that we could all say that has had an indeed profound effect in it to think about the admirable goal that brother bill has set and he aspired we we should all to Aspire to have a positive impact on people's lives like brother Bill had the idea that one's person's actions and values can resonate and make a meaningful difference in the world is powerful there's not a greater man that we could express that Express Jesus Christ in this last day like brother Bill hin to think about the man that stood as a faithful Deacon as a a man of God to this community excuse me we all have memories of of our of our brother 's life probably wouldn't have enough time to tell you about all the hunting and fishing stories that took place of losing glasses in ponds and spending 45 minutes looking for him with his feet cuz he was afraid to spend a dollar from this Valley being as an example of baptizing hundreds of thousands standing beside our precious brother Homer Fraser in the cold Waters and in the hot summers was standing right there and I would say that that's the Testament of a real Christian how many people could we say that bill Hinkle and Homer Fraser stood in these Waters around this Valley and baptized them not in the name of a trinity not in titles but he baptized them in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no other name given amongst men where men should be saved but by that name the memories that we we have of brother Bill leading our youth in worship every Sunday in devotions of setting and leading us and I'd say that many of us young people that still have our Bibles that from when we were a young child it there there are bookmarks there that brother Bill constantly was giving us of something that had a devotional on it or something that we would spend our time reading over but to me one of the greatest achievements in my memory is the undying love that brother Bill had for our Lord Jesus Christ there's so many so many stories we could tell but probably one of my favorite memories is when brother Bill just four years ago was brother Bill enjoyed worship and brother Bill enjoyed he enjoyed songs like Ain't No Grave and I tell you if you wanted brother Bill to get on his feet all you had to do is sing Ain't No Grave and he was on his feet and he'd beat every single one of you young people down here Dance all the way down that aisle and but we got to singing that song four labor days ago and brother Bill was using a cane at that time and he'd went back here and used a restroom and and brother Bill you know he age was getting up on him and but when he come back through that back door you could see the spirit of the Lord start moving over top of him and he got down here about this second aisle he threw at can down and took off running a lap for Jesus Full Gospel Lighthouse we've been graced with the presence of a great man and Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle cannot be mentioned without the H without honoring the legacy of Bill Hinkle his life his prayers his genuine Spirit have woven into the very fabric of this church and has left an indelible Mark that will continue to inspire generations to come Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:7 I have fought a good fight and I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me that day not to me only but to all of them that also love his appearing and I say brother Bill you fought your fight and you won I was thinking about brother Bill being a Sunday school teacher and would teach here several times for brother Homer and I was thinking about this a Sunday school teacher wrote this one time said a basketball in my hands is worth about $19 but a basketball in Michael Jordan's hands is worth about $33 million you see it depends it depends on Whose hands it's in a baseball in my hands is worth about $6 but a baseball in Mark Maguire's hands is worth $19 million it depends on Whose hands it's in a tennis racket is useless in my hands but a tennis racket in Pete and pross hands is a Wimbledon Championship it depends on Whose hands it's in a rod in my hands will keep away a wild animal but a rod in Moses's hands will part the mighty see it depends on Whose hands it's in a slingshot in my hands is a kid's toy but a slingshot in David's hand is a mighty weapon it depends on Whose hands that it's in two fish and five loaves of bread in my hands is is a couple of fish sandwiches but two fish and five loaves of bread in Jesus's hand will feed thousands it depends on Whose hands that it's in Nails in my hands might produce a birdhouse but Nails in Jesus Christ hands will produce salvation for the entire world it depends on Whose hands it in and when we put brother Bill into the hands of almighty God the other day it was the greatest hands that there ever had that ever could be put into and in our grief let us find comfort in the knowledge that Bill's Journey doesn't end here and as we say our good B let us celebrate the life of a man who not only belied the message of William random but he lived this message and every aspect of his being he taught it and and he lived it if you want to know what the message is you just simply look at this man right here and may we carry on his legacy by cherishing our Lord Jesus Christ and by honoring him rest in peace our brother D brother Bill de HK well there came a sound from Heaven oh like a [Music] rushing oh my mighty wind oh it fill their heart were singing and G them peace within oh the prophet who gave [Applause] This [Music] Promise oh that the spirit oh we de and from from your inner be a [Music] river oh with no wind oh there is a river oh that flows from Deep with oh there is a

have lost a friend we've lost a buddy we've lost a pillar of this church but really we haven't lost him he just graduated a little earlier than we would have all would have liked him to do I'm uh when I was writing notes for the sermon today I spent the week thinking about these things I I thought about uh I'm sorry if you didn't recognize how great a man he was what brought me to that that thought was one day I was sitting in a at a picnic and I heard somebody making fun of him I quickly defended him and they was talking about simple Bill and humble bill on that day you'll wish you had what Bill had let's go ahead and praise the Lord [Applause] amen bill was one of the greatest men that I've ever known he was an incredible reader he could have probably been one of the greatest politicians that ever lived cuz he knew how to shake hands and kiss babies and make everybody feel good no matter what your thought of the day was he could talk with you a little bit but the scripture that fits him the best and I've got several here for you today and that says and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believe God and I believe we could put bill Hinkle's name there and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you're either his friend or you're you're his enemy the scripture Jesus tells his own disciples he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas saith unto him Lord we we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus sa unto him I am the way there's not a dozen ways it's not by your opinion Jesus is the way that's actually what's going on in Israel today is they're fighting for one piece of ground called The Temple Mount they're fighting for it and in their fight they don't want to just destroy the Jews but they want to destroy every Christian be careful who you line up with and Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and to and no man cometh unto the father but my me we realize that death is a defining moment you're either heading in One Direction or you're headed in another Jesus actually talks more about hell than he does heaven if you know your Bible Well he describes what hell's going to be like but I want to say this to you even as we said here you don't have to go there there's still hope for you there's breath in your lungs your heart is still beating it's not my way I did it my way as a matter of fact that's the number one song in the satanic movement I did it my way I want to do it Jesus's way it is the point to where the Final Touch is put on one's personal life that's the portrait that is made the Masterpiece is signed and the and then the the painting is dried never to be changed again it is finished God knows when a man comes on the earth and he knows the day that he will leave I would say this and this best describes brother Bill He Who Walks With God is immortal he looked to where he was aging but he was Immortal his hair was turning gray his eyes through Reynolds glasses safety glasses that was always dirty hell will never get him for a Christian this is as close as we'll ever get to hell but for an unbeliever this is as close you'll ever get to heaven you see God is the architect of our new body he was the architect of Adam and Eve God knows your days coming on the earth he knows when you'll come he knows your nature he knows what you'll look like and he has a Lamb's Book of Life that he elected before the foundation of the world bill was never one that could be rattled he was one that had a word for everything that was said I never seen him stumped God knew how he would prepare for his journey he stepped out of time and into out of Eternity into time and when he picked a wife he couldn't have picked a better one she was a real lady she was a real queen but he's waiting now on the other side of the Jordan cuz marriage isn't over with amen it's not over with he's young now he doesn't possess any gray hair he doesn't need a set of glasses I doubt he's wearing red shirts today but he's got a rope on he'll never get old he'll never fight with dementia ever again he's got special friends here brother Homer is on the other side of the river his mom and Daddy's there he got a daughter named Natalie that's there she went she went on had a visitation whether you believed or not I had a visitation with Natalie just a month or so ago seeing her young in her young body actually had a few words with her I told her how sorry I was for how difficult life was and she said you're so silly her arms had young hair she always had hair on her arms she was beautiful she was glistening told me that she'd see us in a few days I believe she's seeing bill now amen he's not gray-headed no more they probably done some d maning Bill's favorite scriptures are are are some of these for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son and this is the condemnation that light cometh into the world and Men loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil Malachi 4 and verse 5 and 6 behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse the Gentiles had to have a prophet and we had it I was thinking of some of the first things that bill would do and he would be shaking hands with a lot of friends but he would shake the hands of Wigan brandham and I would say some of his first words to to him was I believed your message with all my heart Revelations 10 and verse one and I saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven with a cloud and and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and feet as pillars of fire verse 7even but in the days of the voice of the Sabbath Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophet Psalms 23 he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures the Lord is my shepherd and he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and he leadth and he leadth me be beside the Still Waters and restoreth my soul and he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me when it came to this time our God becomes real to us I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and thou anointest my cut my head with all and my cup runneth over surely can you give me me a book I can you give me a book to lay under here I fight I fight double vision and thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever acts chap 2 and verse 36 therefore let all the house of Israel assuredly know that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto him repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you want your sins remitted I don't want to go before the Judgment Hall and my sins have not been remitted I don't want to stand there and say well I've been a good man that don't count nothing I've been a rich man I've been the mayor I've been this or that listen if you don't have Jesus Christ in your [Music] life for the promis is unto you and to your children to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Proverbs 3 and verse 2 for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them on the tables of the heart so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and he shall direct thy path Ecclesiastes chapter 3 to everything there is a season a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plan a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break and and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh and a time to mourn BN and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to R and a time to sow a time to keep silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace and he found it our revelation of God is lived in our lives it's been said maybe even by you that he's the greatest Christian you ever known could we say Amen right there amen if you look in Webster's Dictionary his picture is there beside a friend of God he knew how to love he knew how to care this church started in his basement even with Lindon not being so much in agreements you see he had met Jesus before he had religion but he met Jesus amen and when he met Jesus it knew it could cost him a lot of things cost him a lot of friends cost him a lot of prestige with these neighbors but he said I'll take the way with God's despised few and Bill offered his home I don't know if it's room in his basement now now to have church but Bill was a collector might have heard something about some of those services and Linda happened to wander down the steps and and she had religion but she had never had this kind of Jesus and there she is slain in the spirit when she meets Jesus and now she's on the same Journey what she has fought so hard now she's on the journey now she doesn't realize what lays ahead her children are now being raised in a in a message home and now he's going to be a servant to many he's going to take a van and he's going to pick up neighbors and friends and loved ones and he'll get home an hour after you get home or maybe two hours after you get home and he was willing to do whatever it was and that was after 4 Hour services or 5 Hour services and and let me just say Church to him was church it was life and you've heard us say how he would amen and how he would worship and how that he would teach the youth and and give us teaching messages and and we just loved every bit of it he had a way of putting things together brother Homer would use him to to tell us how we ought to act in church and and he'd say brother Homer why is it my job well now it's alden's job and so he met every new person here and he would write their name down on a card and where you're from and he would take pictures all over the building and you know and when it come to shouting and dancing he was all for it and he was ready to go he would dance and jump up and down and never would known that but he jumped up on brother Homer's toe and broke his toe while he was shouting and brother Homer pull his shoe off and he said look what Bill done to me and he'd say I don't want to make him feel bad brother Roger and myself I told this last night but it's worthy to be told again we were in Ohio was thousands of people there and we were in how we're coming to the end of the meeting I'd spoke a message on Champions and the champion and our great Champion Jesus Christ and we broke into worship we had a prayer line and and worship went for about two hours and brother Roger and that's standing there brother Roger just raise your hand right there brother Roger and Bill had took me they said we want to be a part of the meeting so they took me up we stayed in the same Hotel I'm not going to tell all this story but they they shouted two straight hours they danced said brother Ron but I'm too old to do that let me just say this to you them two guys took care of every excuse anybody will ever have that guy with a heart attack that just happened just a little bit before that and there brother Bill was and he was dancing and it was just incredible well I'll just go ahead and tell you we got in the car I was wore out I was just literally I was toast and I laid down on the seat brother Roger instructed me to lay down and get myself we were 5 minutes away from the hotel hour later I wake up and they're saying well the sun's that way the moon's that way and we're lost we go into a fuel station and and they're pulling the donuts out and putting them in a bag and they were getting rid of them and Bill said I'll take them when we get in the car we're we're going back and he he was a gracious man he gave me a donut it's a it's a bag that high he gave me a donut and he gave Roger a donut he took the rest of them to his room the next morning we're checking out we're coming back home and brother he asked I said did you eat eat your donuts and Roger said no I found a cockroach so he didn't eat his I took a bite of it and it was stale I don't like nothing stale so I didn't eat no more of it so I turned the question on brother Bill I said brother Bill did you eat yours every one of them brother Bill was the kind of guy that would show up at your house and he would be there to talk to you he would come unannounced who's outside Bill's outside well the rest of your evening was consumed with joy bill would you like something to eat uh I I'm really not that hungry uh you know glass of water will be good and have you got an apple that'll be good and before long you've ate a meal and he ate more than everybody at the table and he would say I don't want to hurt nobody's feelings and we'd go over old times and one night we were at brother Homer's and brother Homer was he was eating prunes anybody that's ever eat prunes know that they're sweet and uh he was eating prunes and so he he told him he said Bill Bill said I'll try one and so before long the bag was gone if you'll understand prunes have [Applause] rewards he was a fisherman brother Vernon was his partner and they had incredible stories incredible stories and they would fall out of the boat together they were friends they did everything thing together but in the falling out the boat he lost his classes 45 minutes later with his bare feet he finally found his glasses bill was a prayer Warrior I was a young man that came to this church married sister Connie that's in back of the building and I married her and I was a young man that needed Christ I needed I needed the Holy Ghost I've been raised in church but that don't make you a Christian and so sitting on a Pew don't make you a Christian my mom and daddy were incred incredible Christians and I would had married sister Connie and brother Homer's a legendary Christian with sister Nancy I needed the Holy Ghost this is where my journey would start with Bill uh sister Donna was playing the piano and I I slipped down in the corner of the piano in the wall I don't know where I didn't want nobody to see me there but I I just I know what I needed I never forget what I prayed and this might be something good for you I prayed Lord my mom and dad are incredible Christians and brother Homer and sister Nancy are incredible Christians Connie is an incredible Christian but I'm not I don't need my mom's experience or my dad's experience even brother Homer's experience I need mine that's right I don't know when it'll come but I need Mine by that time brother Bill had wrapped me like an anaconda and he had his hands around my rib cage and every time I breathe he CED in and as he prayed for me I we prayed for quite a while there and as he prayed I heard him begin to speak in a Heavenly language and I felt the presence of God drop down on him and I said God don't just drop on him drop on me that presence dropped on me I want want to say this to you I've never ever been the same am I went into service one man and I walked out a different man the man Bill Hinkle has always been a hero to me I've watched his life I watched him in the sorrow of Natalie going home I saw the agony of a father but today today he stands with her I swatched him in the early days of his mother and father leaving both of them being baptized I watched him as friends would go friends of this church would go I got to be really tight with him whatever you were doing he was interested to be a part of I made him a chimney sweep I took him I took him to incredible meetings we did an incredible amount of things that I don't have time to say about it together but Bill Hinkle was a friend Seth if you ever had a hero or a mentor to look to that guy is the guy and I'm not talking about having a garden where there was 50 million tons of manure in it I'm I'm not talking about that part of his life I'm talking about being a real Christian raising family in the fear and the admonition of God that guy should he is more important than LeBron James amen he is more important than anybody in this world that is an incredible hero and an incredible Mentor that's only his house that he used to live in we were privileged to have him as a friend I was privileged to go rabbit hunting with him maybe maybe some of his friends would leave him lead him over on trespassing land not going to name them here but but there's some funny stories you could tell there but he was a friend to us all he was just not my friend or your friend he became friends to the children in this church from the youngest to the oldest he made an incredible connection and I say this to you he was a pillar he was a pillar that we all could say we were proud to be a part of it I was thinking about his rewards thank God it's eternity cuz it's going to take a while to hand out all of his rewards I think about maybe I'll get a tent and he'll get a Castle but if I could say it well he live W life well done he's dancing now he's shouting now if he could look down over the banister of heaven and preach a sermon his life did brother Ron I'm not so cons I'm not so I'm not so uh Vindicated that life is you know there's Life After Life well just wait till the second you die just wait till the second you die and you'll figure it out real quick of some things that you should have done life after death is incredibly important and this is the only spot that you can get it fixed a lot of people don't want to come to funerals is because they might get convicted you don't get convicted at a ball game you definitely don't get convicted at a political speech but it's a place where that you have to really deal with with life and death amen and as I finish today where will you spend eternity the vast the mass majority of this audience has worship with Bill amen hallelujah but if this is your first time in this building this is a place that he helped build he was here when the trees were cut down he was here when all the things were laid he was here working on this building from start to finish and he was here for all the services but Jesus has built something for him when he said I go to prepare you Bill hle a house not made with hands sister Linda there's a glitter in his eye and there's some pep in his step I'm not really for sure if he's got his shirt off like in all those pictures but I'd say it's more of a Robee that's going on over there but didn't he look good didn't he look good I can just hear him say it didn't I look good I would say it to him today if I could Echo it into the heavens bill you you look good in that new body I'm not so sad over here but you look [Applause] good I have seen some prettyy towns guess you could say I've been around
