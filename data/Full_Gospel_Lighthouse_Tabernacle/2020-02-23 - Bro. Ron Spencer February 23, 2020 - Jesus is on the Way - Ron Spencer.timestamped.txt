[0:14] be seated just a moment if you would

[0:31] Lord this afternoon thank you for that
[0:34] amen amen
[0:36] I want to continue to remember sister
[0:37] Judy's family as well she lost her
[0:40] brother and the funeral was this week
[0:43] and and God just touched her ain't man
[0:47] and so thank you for your prayers and
[0:49] everything that you have done for us and
[0:52] last night my heart was just bursting
[0:54] last night as I as I went toward the end
[0:57] of the service and I was getting ready
[0:59] to leave and and Seth walked up to me
[1:02] and he had a car before me and in the
[1:04] car he had a he had a gift wanted me to
[1:08] buy a dinner
[1:09] and so I surely that little boy didn't
[1:16] do that and so I wrote his daddy last
[1:19] night and when he told me I I just have
[1:22] to tell you I just busted my water
[1:26] valves all busted last night and so and
[1:29] so Seth god bless you guys we love you
[1:32] with all of our hearts amen it has let
[1:36] us know that we're loved in a lot of
[1:37] places and so we just are so thankful
[1:40] for that and we're believing for a good
[1:42] report
[1:44] and we just believe in God we'll do some
[1:46] supernatural works and so we just thank
[1:50] the Lord for that and we never knew that
[1:53] we were gonna had to walk this road and
[1:55] these are some surprises sometimes but
[1:57] God's not ever taken off off surprise
[2:01] and so he's never in a crisis he doesn't
[2:04] call the Angels together and say now now
[2:06] we got out reassemble some things here
[2:09] he has armed us for this battle amen so
[2:13] so appreciate last night brother brother
[2:16] Wiggum I just I was just I was just
[2:18] proud of that so I was just thankful
[2:20] brother William a man to your family and
[2:22] we're just praying I think we're going
[2:24] to dedicate a baby next weekend if
[2:26] they're able and so we're looking
[2:28] forward to that and now they're
[2:30] officially in Virginia so amen a lot of
[2:35] things that was said last night was very
[2:36] key and very important and I hope you
[2:38] grab both of it amen
[2:41] I'd like for you to do a little homework
[2:43] this week if you can do this and for
[2:46] those that have internet availability to
[2:48] do it brother Tim this morning kind of
[2:50] rehearsed the last chapter of the book
[2:52] of Acts of his visit here with us and
[2:56] and he took about 15 20 minutes this
[2:58] morning just to kind of go over some
[3:00] things whether you realize I'm not was
[3:02] quite a supernatural time that was that
[3:05] we took place here and as he spoke last
[3:09] weekend I was I was very much tortured
[3:12] you know we can have every promise in
[3:15] the Bible and every song and everything
[3:17] but until that little thing happens in
[3:19] your life there's a bit of fear and
[3:21] darkness that goes with cancer and so on
[3:23] and I mean I could I've seen some in
[3:26] phenomenal miracles and and that just
[3:29] little thing was haunting it it seemed
[3:31] like every morning was a teary mourning
[3:33] and a cry morning and it was just it was
[3:37] just that kind of an atmosphere that was
[3:39] haunting at me after that prayer when
[3:42] brother Donnie broke into tongues and I
[3:44] heard that I heard I heard brother Tim
[3:47] praying that my immune system would just
[3:50] pick
[3:51] and drive that cancer out brother random
[3:54] said healings in the body
[3:56] and then toward the end as he came to
[3:59] the end and brother Donny is interceding
[4:01] and in that heavenly language I I just
[4:04] like to say this to you that spirit of
[4:08] torment left in that long
[4:13] [Applause]
[4:20] and I'd like to say that there's nobody
[4:23] can bring peace like Jesus can bring
[4:26] peace and so brother Tim just shared
[4:30] this morning he had a dream while he was
[4:32] with us and it was after the Sunday
[4:34] night service and brother Tim has some
[4:36] God deals with him in the three
[4:38] different kinds of directions but he
[4:39] dealt with him in a dream while he was
[4:41] at our house and he related to us on the
[4:45] way to the he also had another
[4:48] experience but but he relayed to us the
[4:52] dream on the way to the to the doctors
[4:56] as his appointment would be to fly out
[4:59] it was late enough to where I can take
[5:02] brother Tim with me in to see the the
[5:05] cancer doctor and I thought that was a
[5:08] really good touch God's always perfect
[5:10] and so I I just I just told him I had my
[5:15] family with them had brother Nathaniel
[5:17] Holmes go with me because I needed him
[5:19] to interpret what they would say and so
[5:22] you know just just speak in laymen terms
[5:25] I'm a country boy I just need to hear it
[5:27] right face-to-face and so and so brother
[5:30] Joe Greene had been with me on Bop
[5:32] season and then we went in to see the
[5:36] doctor and and she's just an incredible
[5:38] doctor and and so brother till on the
[5:42] way there relate us a dream that was
[5:44] that was he was in this dream and he was
[5:48] there was just about 12 buzzers they
[5:51] were they were they couldn't fly they
[5:53] seemed like they just got out of their
[5:55] nest and and he was gathering them one
[5:58] by one and was feeding them to pigs and
[6:01] he began to talk about the gory site of
[6:04] the intros and all that he saw take
[6:06] place and those pigs was eaten those
[6:09] buzzards son and so he was feverishly
[6:13] looking looking on the on the message of
[6:17] what what pigs have to do with buzzards
[6:20] and and and and as it would be those
[6:26] buzzards represent those demons of
[6:29] cancer
[6:31] and so what he had prayed into prayer on
[6:35] Thursday evening he had prayed for our
[6:38] immunise immunity to our immune system
[6:42] to kick in and so as we sat and listened
[6:47] to the doctor and she you know she
[6:49] shared with us and that she said you
[6:53] have some options you can do nothing and
[6:57] and for those that don't know if you
[7:00] could do nothing you've just got months
[7:02] to live where I'm sitting and so for the
[7:06] people that are critics of me going to a
[7:08] doctor well I really want to live till
[7:12] the summer you understand what I'm
[7:17] saying and I've had critics of me going
[7:21] to the doctor but brother Brandon went
[7:22] to the doctor brother branham took
[7:26] medicine so I you know and by the way
[7:29] all the miracles that happened since I
[7:32] was raised back to life and I was in a
[7:36] coma for for a month
[7:38] all of those miracles happen because of
[7:40] good doctors that kept me alive until
[7:42] God would work a miracle and so I was
[7:46] sitting before this doctor and brother
[7:48] Branham taught us that if you go to the
[7:49] doctor he said do what they say and then
[7:55] take the medicine that they give you and
[7:58] so we know God's the healer he gave them
[8:00] the knowledge and God's the healer you
[8:02] don't go for them to healing God's the
[8:04] only one that does the healing and so
[8:06] and so she relayed to us said there's a
[8:10] few different options that you could
[8:12] take there's of course radiation and
[8:15] then there's chemotherapy and then
[8:17] there's a couple of more different
[8:18] things and and she said but what my
[8:21] recommendation for you is
[8:22] immunotherapy and it would be to
[8:26] supercharge your your immune system to
[8:29] where it would attack the cancer brother
[8:33] Tim just with that but that smile
[8:37] this is what we were looking for so the
[8:41] pigs are going to eat the buzzards one
[8:43] treatment at a time
[8:56] that's what
[9:03] [Applause]
[9:17] a man him by the way they came up with
[9:23] that with was studying the actually
[9:28] study in pigs and so using the cancer
[9:32] and in a pig sale so I I just think
[9:35] that's just all so neat and maybe I
[9:37] didn't explain that real good but I
[9:39] think I think if we could just step back
[9:42] just for a moment God has great big
[9:44] plans and I think it's way beyond
[9:48] ourselves our church because we're
[9:51] coming toward a resurrection if we can't
[9:56] have faith to overcome cancer how can we
[9:59] have faith for a rapture or faith for a
[10:04] resurrection for the people that have
[10:07] been in the ground not just a few days
[10:09] or not just a few months or a few years
[10:11] and Connie's very faithful to do to go
[10:16] to their brother homers grave and my
[10:19] mother's grave and put flowers on the
[10:21] grave and I've always admired that about
[10:23] her as a seasons changed she puts
[10:25] flowers that represent the season but
[10:28] there's coming a time where we won't
[10:30] have to put no more flowers there's
[10:33] coming a resurrection because we have a
[10:36] promise
[10:38] a man so brother Tim related that any if
[10:51] you want to listen to the book of Acts
[10:52] this morning I would recommend you go
[10:54] and listen to it it's it's just really
[10:57] really good and so a man I we we
[11:00] certainly enjoyed having brother Tim and
[11:02] brother Donnie and I'm sure a lot of
[11:04] others would love to come but you know I
[11:06] had I just I just pray that they give me
[11:10] just a little bit of space and so amen
[11:13] it's gonna be a little bit of a deal at
[11:15] home a little bit of as we go through
[11:19] through some therapy not everything's
[11:21] delicate so amen so love that I love
[11:24] soul of the men of God brother farmer
[11:27] sister Deborah's father sent me a note
[11:30] this weekend and he and and I thought
[11:34] this was so appropriate he said long
[11:38] years before that they had smelters they
[11:43] used to take gold and how they would
[11:46] know how it was right or not
[11:49] with all the sludge that was out of it
[11:52] and all the iron pyrite that's that's
[11:55] fool's gold and all the fools out of it
[11:58] and and and the beaters would beat it
[12:01] and beat it and turn it and beat it and
[12:04] and turned it until the the beater sees
[12:08] the reflection his reflection in the
[12:11] gold he said that's the way God does his
[12:15] church he gives you trial after trial
[12:19] after trial and test after test and
[12:23] trial after trial and test after test
[12:25] until the life of Christ is reflected in
[12:29] your life until you become peaceful and
[12:33] sobered me and gentle and humble ready
[12:39] submissive willing to turn your head
[12:41] from the things of the world looking
[12:43] straight to Calvary to the one who's
[12:46] doing the beating many times you think
[12:49] it's strange because of firing the the
[12:52] because of the fiery trials and sick
[12:55] persecutions it's only done to test you
[13:01] to get the dirt out of you
[13:04] to get the slides out of you to get the
[13:06] slowness out of you to wake you up to
[13:10] the place where you can look and see the
[13:12] reflection or men can see the reflection
[13:17] of Christ in you a man the hope of glory
[13:22] amen god bless you I just have one more
[13:25] I'd like for you to be praying for
[13:27] brother Tom Murray brother Tom is as
[13:30] many of you know has has had his ankle
[13:33] replaced a couple of different times and
[13:35] this time they were getting ready to
[13:37] replace that apparatus again because he
[13:39] was having some difficulty or was going
[13:41] to shave the bone again and so literally
[13:45] God worked to miracle right before the
[13:48] doctor stopped and didn't do it and when
[13:55] he went back and x-rayed it literally
[13:57] the operating room was ready and they
[13:59] were getting ready to take him in and
[14:01] and brother Tom just told him where the
[14:03] pain was and Annie baby an attack pain
[14:05] was higher the boom was actually
[14:08] fractured and so had they did the
[14:11] surgery went on and did the surgery he
[14:14] would have wound up an amputee but we
[14:17] want to pray we want to pray that God
[14:21] would come on the scene for brother Tom
[14:23] Murray he's a he's a friend of ours and
[14:27] and we're just praying that God would
[14:30] just brother Andrew was just with him I
[14:31] was just with him just only a few days
[14:33] ago and we we just want to pray that God
[14:37] would work a special miracle
[14:40] are you with me God work a special
[14:43] miracle that God would just come on the
[14:45] scene and give him give them the wisdom
[14:48] to know how to handle that entire
[14:50] situation to were that they can fix that
[14:53] ture never have another problem I
[14:55] believe God is able

[15:00] you a man would you stand with me
[15:02] tonight I just want to I just want to
[15:05] share some scripture with you this
[15:06] evening

[15:16] patience with me for just a bit to share
[15:18] some things on my heart I'd like to
[15:24] speak tonight on Jesus is on his way and
[15:29] there's nothing the devil can do to stop
[15:32] him I like that don't you that should
[15:39] make us believers just grant Matthew
[15:47] chapter 14 verse 22 and straightway
[15:55] Jesus constrained his disciples to get
[15:59] into a ship and to go before him unto
[16:03] the other side and while he sent the
[16:07] multitudes away and when he had sent the
[16:11] multitudes away he went up into the
[16:13] mountain apart to pray and and when the
[16:16] evening was come he was there alone but
[16:20] the ship was now in the midst of the sea
[16:23] tossed with waves for the wind was
[16:27] contrary and in the fourth watch of the
[16:32] night Jesus went into the unto them
[16:35] walking on the sea quite a quite words
[16:41] right they're walking on the sea and
[16:44] when the disciples saw him walking on
[16:48] the sea they were troubled saying it
[16:53] is it a spirit and they cried out for
[16:56] fear but straightway Jesus spake unto
[17:00] them saying be of good cheer it is I be
[17:08] not afraid and Peter answered him and
[17:12] said lord if it be thou bid me to come
[17:19] unto thee on the water and he said come
[17:23] and when Peter was come down out of the
[17:26] ship he walked on the water to go to
[17:29] Jesus but when he saw the wind
[17:32] boisterous he was afraid and beginning
[17:35] to sink and he cried saying lord save me
[17:40] and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[17:44] his hand and caught him and saturdayman
[17:47] o thou of little faith wherefore did a
[17:51] stout doubt and when they were coming to
[17:54] the ship the wind ceased and then they
[17:59] that were in the ship came and worshiped
[18:02] him and saying of a truth thou art the
[18:07] son of God could we just pray maybe you
[18:10] have a need tonight you just like to say
[18:12] Lord remember me this evening a man god

[18:27] be mindful of his Lord and come and
[18:30] speak to our hearts father this
[18:32] afternoon we so love a bride of Jesus
[18:35] Christ and Lord we love you with all of
[18:39] our hearts tonight Lord we ask you now
[18:42] that you would come and speak to us in a
[18:45] supernatural way Lord our hands lifted
[18:48] we we literally defied gravity and we
[18:53] lifted before you not before a man but
[18:55] before you knowing that you're able to
[18:58] meet every one of our needs father some
[19:01] needs we can't even speak out but father
[19:04] you know
[19:04] every one of our needs now maybe stretch
[19:07] forth your hand toward us tonight father
[19:10] save us to not minister to us to not
[19:14] father in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[19:17] amen and amen you can be seated you can
[19:32] listen to the prophet in several
[19:33] different sermons he begins to describe
[19:35] this situation she begins to describe it
[19:40] in one particular place he said they'd
[19:44] left the campaign he said they'd seen a
[19:47] lot an incredible amount of things that
[19:49] Jesus was doing he sent them out he said
[19:54] that's the way the church world has done
[19:56] they they went off without Jesus
[19:59] especially in the last time that he
[20:01] spoke on this he he describes the church
[20:04] that it's went off without Jesus and let
[20:08] me just say we'll all get in trouble if
[20:10] we move off without Jesus that he has at
[20:14] first place our life the very center
[20:16] focus of our lives to be without Jesus
[20:20] is the worst place that we can ever be
[20:22] in Jesus had stayed back and he was he
[20:27] wanted to be alone send his disciples no
[20:31] doubt that had a phenomenal campaign
[20:33] taking place and they saw incredible
[20:36] miracles happen these disciples were
[20:39] seeing things that no man since the time
[20:43] of Adam had ever seen all the prophets
[20:46] they had they'd saw miracles through
[20:49] through some of those but they'd never
[20:52] seen God operate on this level they'd
[20:55] never seen him as a man operate to word
[20:58] that as the compassion of a man he could
[21:01] take a leopard and that leopard be
[21:04] healed literally within seconds that man
[21:07] would be completely changed turned by
[21:10] the heart of blind Bartimaeus and
[21:12] stopped and and and just and just that
[21:16] man
[21:17] and that had been blind of his life and
[21:20] and brother branham would go into the
[21:23] back story of how he had worshipped and
[21:25] he had he gave his daughter had got sick
[21:28] and he he gave me seeing-eye lamb away
[21:33] here was a man reaching out to God for
[21:38] his only opportunity people would come
[21:41] to the campaign's with that kind of an
[21:43] expectation this service would change my
[21:46] life I think if we came to the building
[21:49] tonight with an expectation god I'm
[21:55] desperate before you if we would come
[21:58] with an expectation there's there's
[22:00] things in our lives and situations and
[22:04] circumstances that we're not in control
[22:06] of that only God could turn it minister
[22:10] to our needs but you see no man can take
[22:16] care of some of those things man can
[22:19] only take you so far he can only make
[22:21] you so many promises but manna breaks
[22:23] his promises if you're around an
[22:26] individual long enough you'll see his
[22:28] humanity he'll disappoint you she'll
[22:32] disappoint you but Jesus will never
[22:36] disappoint you he's never he's never
[22:41] been in a crisis meeting he's never
[22:44] failed God's never failed one time he's
[22:47] never backed up on his promises not one
[22:50] little iota these men knew that they
[22:54] were in a special spot being with him
[22:57] you see they were I was not watching God
[23:01] operate as they leave them no doubt the
[23:07] the side of the banks and they're
[23:09] getting ready to make their trip across
[23:11] the terrain would be that storms can
[23:15] rise up in that area and an incredibly
[23:17] fast patch fast way in and in that
[23:21] situation you can get in trouble real
[23:23] quickly one brother told me that was in
[23:27] South America one time when I was in
[23:29] Trinidad
[23:30] he told me he said that that he said
[23:33] that he was a boatman and he said those
[23:35] waves can get so high so quickly and he
[23:38] said if you're not a boatman and don't
[23:40] know how to take care of it
[23:41] though those waves can be so
[23:43] intimidating
[23:45] well these disciples is now pitched out
[23:50] in and they're there floating along and
[23:53] they're making a way across and brother
[23:55] BAM would describe how that they would
[23:58] be rowing as they're going across and
[24:00] making their way across the sea and he
[24:05] said after a while he said it starts the
[24:07] sun's you know kind of in a certain spot
[24:10] and he says one by one like popcorn they
[24:15] began to stand up and testify testify
[24:19] have the things that they saw God do we
[24:23] could do that tonight stand up all over
[24:25] this building miracle after miracle
[24:27] after miracle we've seen God dude we're
[24:32] living in the book of Acts and we've
[24:35] seen what God has done and what he's
[24:38] done in our lives and ministered to us
[24:42] we've we've watched him operate we've
[24:46] watched him work and we know that no man
[24:50] can do those things they stood up Andrew
[24:55] would stand and Matthew would stand and
[24:58] Luke would stand and Peter would stand
[25:01] and they would begin to give testimonies
[25:04] you know when you start stirring the
[25:06] spirit of the Lord
[25:07] there's an anointing starts coming
[25:10] lesson that mysterion's to get charged
[25:13] you just start talking about Jesus
[25:17] whether you're on the job or in your
[25:19] living room you just start talking about
[25:21] Jesus and it begins to swoop on the
[25:24] atmosphere it'll start coming in the
[25:27] building in a pub where you're at
[25:32] hallelujah
[25:34] they just started talking about the Lord
[25:38] things begin to happen you see their
[25:44] lives have been changed they'd never
[25:48] seen no man do what what God was doing
[25:54] realizing they were in very special
[25:56] times their moms and dads no doubt
[26:00] talked about once coming that's going to
[26:02] do these things in the prophecies and
[26:04] all of that but never have we seen it
[26:10] quite on this order and they're just
[26:12] kind of sharing that backwards and
[26:15] forwards I think sometimes we if we're
[26:17] not careful we'll forget to share that
[26:20] with our children are you with me this
[26:24] is greater than Walt Disney this is
[26:26] greater than anything let your children
[26:29] know a supernatural God and let them
[26:33] hear about the stories of God working in
[26:36] your family and working in your church
[26:38] and working in your life not a dead
[26:42] letter not some sophisticated gospel
[26:45] where God don't work anymore you see
[26:48] whenever it becomes intellectualism or
[26:51] just theory or historical stories it
[26:55] begins to die and a lot of times there's
[26:58] a lot of death in churches
[27:05] where God's not alive where God's not
[27:08] working but I want him here
[27:12] I want him working in every service as
[27:31] they as they were now coming toward
[27:35] evening now it's beginning to get dark
[27:39] you know there's where all our trouble
[27:41] starts as we come into that dark time of
[27:44] our life it's the time that we're we're
[27:48] kind of coming now darkness brings on a
[27:51] lot of things starts to get dark you
[28:02] know and now the waves start to get a
[28:03] little bit rough Satan gets into details
[28:10] you ever had Satan get in the details of
[28:13] your life and you just know that
[28:17] something's going on here
[28:19] there's there's something at work here
[28:22] that's just that's just not right you
[28:25] can just kind of feel there's a there's
[28:28] maybe an edginess in the room or a or a
[28:31] friction that's there that what they're
[28:33] before and a spirit it's moving and and
[28:36] before long that spirit I'll stop trying
[28:39] to hurt your family or hurt your
[28:42] marriage or hurt your relationship with
[28:44] God called you to be mad at God when
[28:48] that's the last one you should be mad at
[28:52] understand God don't make you sick
[28:56] are you into God don't make the trials
[28:59] on it's an enemy that does that are you
[29:03] with me now don't blame it on God God
[29:06] don't do that he's there to help you in
[29:09] your trials in your sickness he's there
[29:12] to watch over your life
[29:15] because God said I am the lord that
[29:18] healeth thee and he's in the hallways
[29:22] and I am God and God always cares about
[29:26] you you're important to him I'm a nobody
[29:32] let me just say everybody is somebody in
[29:36] the kingdom of God as he's waves
[29:58] beginning to come
[30:00] these men are these men our boatman
[30:04] these a man understand what a storm is
[30:08] you know sometimes as Christians we
[30:12] don't expect storms let me just share
[30:18] something personal to you my wife and
[30:21] myself was standing before Christmas
[30:24] about about about the time of brother
[30:28] Danny's demon being and and brother
[30:35] Kelly had just been here but the Danny
[30:37] and the coin had been given to us and
[30:40] then brother Danny comes and I went back
[30:43] and looked at his services as even some
[30:45] of the notes on these services this
[30:47] morning and just actually right on spot
[30:50] on and I was standing I was standing in
[30:53] the living room with Connie and we were
[30:55] just standing there and I was talking to
[30:58] her and I said you know life's just
[31:02] perfect it's just perfect where you know
[31:09] now we're getting a little I'm getting a
[31:11] little gray in my hair
[31:18] I'm not working as hard as I used to
[31:20] have to work I'm enjoying the company of
[31:24] our family
[31:25] enjoying our grandkids you know the
[31:30] church is doing good you know and God's
[31:34] just so good to us
[31:35] life's just perfect you see as a man you
[31:40] can't see the storm but it's God he's
[31:45] watching for it
[31:47] he's already supplied the need before
[31:50] you ever get to it and thus things begin
[31:57] to roll very quickly you were hearing
[32:00] you were hearing them you were hearing
[32:03] the news week after week after week it's
[32:05] things begin to come in God knew that
[32:10] glut knew that God was aware of that
[32:15] so the Jeff and sister Anna give me a
[32:18] picture and it was Jesus walking on the
[32:21] water I'd been after that picture a long
[32:24] time from there here's where I'm
[32:27] preaching tonight this has been on my
[32:30] heart for some time let me just say this
[32:36] view Jesus knew where those disciples
[32:38] were he was aware of their situation
[32:45] now they had watched him blessed the
[32:49] fish and the loaves they had watched a
[32:54] man bless literally the chemicals of
[33:01] biscuits and blessed fish and those
[33:08] cooked fish duplicated cooked fish
[33:14] and that flower and the elements of that
[33:18] biscuits duplicated and was biscuits for
[33:23] over 5,000 people here with me it's the
[33:28] same God that took care of the children
[33:31] in the wilderness sometimes we think oh
[33:37] I've got to do this
[33:38] listen God's able to take care of us
[33:42] he's absolutely able to take care of us
[33:46] in every need in every situation I've
[33:57] seen a lot of things but I've never seen
[34:00] a man walk on water
[34:02] other than ice they'd seemed that
[34:12] duplication they had seen they had seen
[34:15] hands come straight palsy straighten up
[34:22] it seemed a dead race but they'd never
[34:28] seen this kind of phenomenon find it
[34:33] interesting that right in the midst of
[34:35] our trials Satan likes to tell you how
[34:38] big he is
[34:40] he likes to stack the odds against you
[34:44] he likes to tell you how dark your trial
[34:47] is and he always wants to give you the
[34:51] bad news and how do we look at the
[34:56] worst-case scenarios so quickly in our
[35:00] minds I many times even as a believer
[35:06] you're not exempt because the greatest
[35:10] battle that's ever fought is in your
[35:11] mind and in your mind
[35:14] Satan meets you there but you're armed
[35:17] with the Word of God to take God's Word
[35:22] and write out checks and speak the Word
[35:25] of God and not just speak
[35:27] but believe it so us and so as those
[35:40] disciples are there just as Satan tried
[35:45] to block the visitation of Abraham and
[35:49] Sarah with Melchizedek you remember in
[35:53] the in the in the sermon brother branham
[35:55] said in is there anything too hard for
[35:58] the Lord he said that morning Sarah got
[36:02] up and she was in a fussy mood never
[36:06] happens at none of our homes but she was
[36:10] in a fussy mood now now she was as much
[36:14] a part of the promises Abraham was and
[36:17] that morning she got up in a fussy mood
[36:21] and and she was barking and she was
[36:25] talking about you know the caravans you
[36:28] know they go by Lots misses Lots house
[36:30] and she's got a new head she's got a new
[36:32] dress they don't never come up here and
[36:35] and she was just going on and on brother
[36:39] branham said it was Satan trying to
[36:42] block the visitation come on church how
[36:49] many times do we come to church and
[36:53] coming down the road now I'm on the spot
[36:56] now coming down the road a little
[36:59] Barclays goes on a little bark it goes
[37:04] on and in the little bark II it causes
[37:06] an atmosphere on you and your seat and
[37:09] your mind is way off somewhere else and
[37:13] there's a visitation happening in the
[37:16] church and one person is literally
[37:19] almost in rapture and condition and the
[37:22] other one's got they're missing the
[37:25] whole thing because Satan blocked what
[37:29] God was doing help me preach now brother
[37:35] Rena would say it don't miss this don't
[37:37] miss it don't miss it don't miss it
[37:43] come on Church find it interesting how
[37:52] that he gets into details and here men
[37:57] that was in a testimony service just a
[37:59] little bit ago
[38:00] now it's fearful Jesus come walking now
[38:10] sometimes people put some bad shadow on
[38:14] Peter because he sank but to me he was a
[38:21] hero cuz he's the only one in that boat
[38:25] that said Lord bid me to come I believe
[38:30] your God and I want a walk with you when
[38:38] you said be not afraid i I want to do
[38:40] more than just listen to the message I
[38:42] want to live it bid me to walk with you
[38:48] a little bit if you can walk on water so
[38:52] can i if the message lives so can I live
[38:58] hallelujah if the token works I want it
[39:01] applied in my life I want to be an
[39:05] overcomer in Laodicea
[39:10] you step out of the boat
[39:15] and he started walking and then he's
[39:19] walking the waves came up and he lost
[39:27] focus on Jesus don't tell me don't
[39:34] criticize Peter for a moment because
[39:36] many times you have to be kind of sit
[39:38] back up
[39:40] sometimes you lose your focus sometimes
[39:45] you need to be balanced a little bit I'm
[39:50] preaching to you because I've been your
[39:51] pastor a long time I've had to put a
[39:55] safety belt on some of you get you back
[39:58] are you in the hell life real sometimes
[40:06] it's real sometimes Satan tries to shake
[40:11] you and you remember Jesus told Peter
[40:15] Satan's ambition was to sift him like
[40:18] wheat ground into powder destroy him but
[40:23] remember what Jesus told him I prayed
[40:26] for you I prayed for you that thy faith
[40:32] when thou I converted strengthen the
[40:35] Brethren when I live on the inside of
[40:38] you you'll live by yourself you can't
[40:42] stand up oh brother I don't want to be a
[40:44] Christian I want to walk I want to be a
[40:46] real church member I want to be a sister
[40:47] in the kingdom of God until you get
[40:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:51] Christ you ask forgiveness of your sins
[40:54] and then you're filled with the Holy
[40:56] Ghost the very life of God then you can
[41:06] stand some cast
[41:09] [Applause]
[41:24] kind of reminds me of some young
[41:26] whippersnappers never been through a
[41:29] battle they can quote a lot of Scripture
[41:32] say a lot of things actually talk down
[41:35] to people sometimes be difficult
[41:38] they never been do nothing but give me
[41:44] that that time-tested memorial give me
[41:51] the guy that's been tried by fire a lot
[41:57] of times wind blows
[42:05] if you're not time-tested you don't
[42:07] break it right off when they would pick
[42:13] a picker a pole to go in a ship they
[42:18] would get the tree with the most
[42:20] powerful grains in it that could stand
[42:26] the storm I don't want a wheat God
[42:32] forgive me let me just speak honest with
[42:35] you tonight I don't want a weak God in
[42:38] this kind of a storm you can't look at
[42:45] the trial that lays in front of me and
[42:47] what a weak God
[42:56] some people feel like they're gonna quit
[42:59] with the TOEIC somebody didn't shake
[43:05] their hand little petty thing comes
[43:08] along and blows them right out of the
[43:09] water little situation comes up and they
[43:14] just blow up brother brems said they
[43:16] haven't been pressurized right major
[43:19] difference between the Blackbird and an
[43:21] eagle even the hawk will fly so high but
[43:26] he's not pressurized to go but that
[43:31] Eagles born to where he can go up into
[43:33] the midst of the storm and then set his
[43:37] eyes towards the Sun and just keep going
[43:40] and ride above the storm remember one
[43:48] time God having a conversation with a
[43:50] man named Joe
[43:52] he'd been kind of you know could be an
[43:57] example for all of us sometimes we think
[44:00] we've had bad days we'll just read the
[44:02] book of Job just a little bit and it
[44:04] kind of lets you know that it could be
[44:07] worse he had friends come to him and say
[44:14] you must have sinned
[44:18] you must have sinned
[44:20] you must have done something wrong in
[44:22] your life for you to have to go through
[44:24] that I've had a couple of jobs
[44:26] comforters come to me already but I know
[44:30] where I'm standing
[44:32] I got no problems at the river you
[44:41] remember when God came to him God didn't
[44:46] even talk to him about his trouble he
[44:50] didn't even talk to him about his
[44:52] situation God didn't tell him talk to
[44:57] him about his balls or even sat down to
[44:59] have a pity party with him
[45:06] you know sometimes we want to if we
[45:09] could just have an interview with God
[45:11] we'd like to tell him everything
[45:12] it's been going on bad god I'd like to
[45:16] tell you all my problems and all my
[45:18] situations I'd like to just God you know
[45:22] you need to know this but when God came
[45:28] to job he didn't talk about none of his
[45:30] problems I love this part when God came
[45:36] to job he asked him where was you act
[45:44] where was you act when I laid the
[45:49] foundations of the earth where was you
[45:54] at when I created the mountains in the
[45:56] and the deserts in and he just kind of
[45:59] took him through all that he did and he
[46:04] showed him everything that he had done
[46:06] and he brought him into an eternal room
[46:10] oh if we could look tonight past that
[46:14] storm and into an eternal room
[46:19] hallelujah you would sign a double term
[46:23] for your trowel if you just knew how
[46:29] much that got out of you to give even
[46:34] Satan permission
[46:37] have you considered joke you see your
[46:46] trials molds you and everyone situation
[46:53] that I'm in or Satan thinks he has me in
[46:58] let's say it like that when it's
[47:02] mentioned to somebody automatically they
[47:05] relate to one of their family members
[47:08] it's had it this and that but every
[47:13] situation is different
[47:15] err every every every circumstance is
[47:19] different you will go through trials
[47:21] that I'll never go through are you with
[47:25] me we need one another you can't stand
[47:30] by yourself you need one another I'm
[47:34] preaching even down to the unseen
[47:35] audience we need you we want to be a
[47:40] blessing to you we want to be a strength
[47:42] to you and I want you to know this we
[47:46] are never alone
[47:57] brother branham said many times you
[48:00] might think my friend you might you
[48:03] might have went off without him but
[48:05] remember he's still watching you he
[48:10] knows right were you all they may be a
[48:14] trouble in the home maybe trouble in
[48:16] your soul maybe trouble in your body
[48:18] whatever it is don't you worry he has
[48:23] got his eyes on you he is watching you
[48:27] it climbed up on the top of a mountain
[48:30] he was looking out there and he seen
[48:31] every trick that the devil was playing
[48:33] and he not only climb but he climbed the
[48:37] ramparts of Calvary
[48:38] not only did Calvary - the ramparts of
[48:41] glory and he sits tonight at the Majesty
[48:44] he looks down on the earth and there's
[48:46] not even a ripple that can come on the
[48:49] water without his permission
[48:54] that's quite a thought in there isn't a
[48:57] ripple that could come on the water
[48:59] without his permission the sea can't
[49:04] move a leaf can't move a bird can't fly
[49:09] blessed be the name of the Lord he is
[49:12] above all principalities and powers the
[49:15] earth made made by him made him the
[49:18] lowest name that could be brought God
[49:21] gave him the hause name that could be
[49:23] given the earth put him as low as they
[49:26] could get him and in the sin and grave
[49:29] but God raised him on the highest of
[49:31] high he is so high till he has to look
[49:35] down to see heaven his eyes on the
[49:38] sparrow
[49:39] I know he watches me
[49:43] he watches you he knows every thought
[49:46] that's in your mind he knows every
[49:49] action that you make he knows everything
[49:51] about you the trut you say uh but I back
[49:55] slave brother branham that don't make a
[49:57] bit of difference he knows exactly what
[50:00] you back slid over he knows exactly
[50:02] where you're at he's a brother Brown and
[50:06] I went off without him - I had an
[50:08] opportunity one time to speak I had an
[50:10] opportunity one time to be a Christian I
[50:13] had an opportunity
[50:14] the preacher made a call I ought to him
[50:16] when I tried it once but I failed I did
[50:19] this and that no matter what you've done
[50:23] he still has his all over you boy you
[50:26] talk about grease those disciples went
[50:32] off without him and the darkest hour
[50:34] when the devil kid got them away from
[50:37] there away from his presage he began to
[50:40] store him on them maybe that's what he's
[50:43] doing to you tonight he might give you
[50:46] cancer he might give you this he might
[50:48] give you that he might give you a broken
[50:50] home he might give you tore apart
[50:52] he might have give you worries you might
[50:55] have give you a headache I don't know
[50:57] what he'll do but there's one thing that
[51:00] I do know that God has still got his eye
[51:05] on you this may be your darkest hour I
[51:09] don't know God does but just in the
[51:12] darkest time that he said when they were
[51:15] just about ready to go down then Jesus
[51:19] came walking
[51:37] in your darkest hour Jesus comes walking
[51:46] you know to me this message has been
[51:48] worth living I have no regrets I have
[51:58] absolutely no regrets when it comes to
[52:01] serving God I look back at a lot of
[52:04] times that I the man have disappointed
[52:07] him he's never disappointed me brother
[52:15] on the process you know so many times
[52:18] we're looking for a miracle to happen
[52:19] you know we all want it to just happen
[52:21] just like that you see I've been through
[52:24] some trials before you remember I fell
[52:29] off of a house and landed on concrete
[52:32] fell 40 feet landed on concrete the
[52:37] doctors later would have some difficult
[52:39] news for me that I'd never walk again
[52:41] but God rich in His mercy but you see it
[52:48] took me about a year to recover I'd had
[52:52] back spasms for about a year
[52:55] chiropractors have told me ever since
[52:57] then they could see the cracks in the
[52:59] back you've had a bad injury one time
[53:02] and I tell them the story and they'd
[53:03] always be marbled at that but you see it
[53:07] was a process of healing that had to go
[53:09] through you know we want an instant
[53:12] thing we want it to be so instant that
[53:16] just in a moment my problem is is over
[53:18] and we want God to move on the scene
[53:21] right now as you know you watched after
[53:30] the fire it was it was about six months
[53:33] even to a year that my lungs would be
[53:35] restored supernaturally in a meeting I
[53:39] was sitting in the meeting just like you
[53:41] are tonight God rich in His mercy
[53:44] reached down supernaturally and I felt
[53:48] the full vacuum of power
[53:50] come into my lungs God gave me new lungs
[53:56] that's even strong tonight for me to
[53:59] preach with this situation are you with
[54:03] me just they told me the other day said
[54:05] your lungs are strong I didn't take the
[54:09] time didn't have the time to tell them
[54:11] God gave me new lungs but there's a
[54:15] squatter that's came into my lungs it's
[54:19] a devil he's on God's property before I
[54:36] get too weary here I just want to share
[54:38] a couple things that's on my heart there
[54:40] was a time that as a sinner sin raised
[54:46] in my life but God rich in mercy with
[54:51] the blood of Jesus Christ that man died
[54:58] and a new king came into my heart now
[55:04] the same blood that paid for my
[55:07] Redemption also was beat being at
[55:12] college judgement Hall that I could be
[55:15] healed it was a dual atonement or you
[55:20] even out once I got saved there's no
[55:23] turning back
[55:24] but if you get sick and God heals you
[55:27] you live long enough you'll get sick
[55:29] again but there's no sickness God can't
[55:33] take care of
[55:36] [Applause]
[55:46] mr. devil I want to tell you you have no
[55:48] legal authority to hold me as a captive
[55:51] and I'm sure the other third-last
[55:55] thirsty he was very disappointed when
[55:57] his torment spirit didn't work no more
[56:18] when that wave came in the next morning
[56:21] tried to grab ahold of me I just looked
[56:23] at him I said not today devil not today
[56:35] what about your problem what about your
[56:39] anxiety what about your depression

[57:15] brother branham said one time he got in
[57:17] the car and the devil got in the car he
[57:22] said he got in the car with him and he
[57:26] said since you got in the car I'm just
[57:29] gonna sing to you and he said I just
[57:33] sing to him all the way so if he's gonna
[57:40] ride with you if he's gonna try to live
[57:44] with you just put him in torment
[57:47] [Applause]
[57:59] I'm not doing a lot of reading because
[58:01] my eyes are blurred but let me just say
[58:04] this to you if he's going to try to live
[58:07] in this body I'm gonna put this word
[58:09] right in front of him Paulo that I can
[58:17] I'm listening to all the sermons that I
[58:20] can I'm praying all I can if he's gonna
[58:25] rock if he wants to play rodeo
[58:32] he has came to a really bad house
[58:45] jesus said I am the resurrection in the
[58:48] love are you with me he had the keys of
[58:53] death Helmand the grief that Jesus lives
[58:58] inside of me that Jesus lives inside of
[59:05] you I'm just gonna give you a couple
[59:13] principles thoughts just before I quit
[59:16] the scripture said greater is He that is
[59:19] in you greater is He that's in you
[59:33] brother Branham said two overcoming is
[59:36] to recognize the devil at his trick now
[59:42] let me just say he's a real magician he
[59:47] can camouflage his activity but once you
[59:50] recognize him what's your recognize him
[59:57] there's power inside of you to kick him
[1:00:01] off brother Branham said as Christians
[1:00:05] we have a right to enforce our god-given
[1:00:09] rocks to bring it back to its original
[1:00:16] order now you might think this is crazy
[1:00:24] but I just booked the meeting just
[1:00:28] before I walked out of here
[1:00:33] brother wrong don't you realize what
[1:00:35] you're getting ready to go through got a
[1:00:37] good idea I am the man in the arena but
[1:00:46] there's going to be life after this
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:01:16] one more statement if I can give it to
[1:01:19] you you're welcome to stand and
[1:01:22] musicians can come where they put Daniel
[1:01:28] nobody had ever came out nobody had ever
[1:01:36] lived through that experience it was
[1:01:41] automatic death where they put Daniel
[1:01:48] but Daniel happened to have God on his
[1:01:51] side
[1:01:57] and you know what come morning
[1:01:59] Daniel walk out of that cage
[1:02:14] and if Jesus walked out of that - I'm
[1:02:18] walking - now this might be crazy to the
[1:02:40] entire world but last Thursday I got
[1:02:45] healed
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:02:57] last Thursday akka heels cost the spirit
[1:03:02] of that thing
[1:03:11] my champion walked in the room
[1:03:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:20] my champion that took ever strap in
[1:03:24] every organ was exposed much helping
[1:03:28] with the culprit
[1:03:34] that's my champion when he stepped in
[1:03:39] the room my precious friends were there
[1:03:43] but he's the one makes a difference I
