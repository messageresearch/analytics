give homage to my mother because she has really been truthful and faithful since his loss she's grounded her goal for her and i is to make it amen she gave me a wonderful gift about three years ago i love photos and she's a photo fanatic but on my wall every morning when i get up i have a picture my brother homer my dad my two fabulous buddies stan thanks henry green and i'm so thankful that i got

lord prepared me to be a sanctuary and we testified tried and true so we may have to go through some stuff before we can be true we've got to be tried so let's be willing let's be so sold out to this word of the hour that no matter what comes or goes we are going to make it amen it's certainly good to see you in the house of the lord we'd like to welcome each and every one of you it's certainly good sister linda kelly back in the house of the lord we so good to see you and welcome back and we missed you and it's so good to see your face in the house of the lord amen we'd like to welcome our visitors sister yolanda uh chitwood and family god bless you all certainly good to see you in the house of the lord amen i'd like to thank brother shannon for stepping in this weekend stepping up and and helping us in the service we'd like to thank him amen bless the lord amen certainly such a wonderful atmosphere you saints praise the lord and brother ron and andrew and and the brothers there are taking a rest much needed rest because you know just because you travel for services doesn't mean you're on vacation there's a lot of pressure that comes with with having to go out and preach services and things so it's nice they can go out and relax and enjoy the presence of the lord for a reset and i believe october is pastor appreciation mom and we certainly appreciate our pastors and everything they do for the church behind the scenes we appreciate their wives that put them back together and certainly drive them home at the end of a service and kind of help them come back down and and recharge for the next service so we certainly appreciate them very much so god bless you again this this um this morning if you would we'll just go straight to the word thank you musicians if you turn with me to genesis chapter 1 you love the lord this morning amen how could you not love him he's so good genesis 1 we'll begin with the one verse the very very beginning of the bible the scripture reads in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day if you'll drop down with me to verse 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass an herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good amen let's borrow our heads and our hearts to come gracious heavenly father lord we now come to this part of the service father lord lord we just as we come in your presence we're a conscious lord that we're not in the presence of a man we're not in the presence of one another lord we're in the presence of your word which is you father lord this word is is a discerner of our thoughts and intents of the heart and lord we just pray and ask that you overshadow us with your holy spirit may lord may we just rebuke any spirit that will try and hinder the service in any way may faith and freedom and deliverance flow and your healing power father lord forgive us of our sins lord may you may i as a speaker lord lord as that beau lord as that violin lord that we know the story of lord all attitude may you take the my humanity lord may you just get me out of the way that the master can step in lord play something for us lord we love you and we'll give you all the praise on our glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you're seated i like with the help of the lord to speak this morning on the title of let there be light as we read in the scriptures we just keep this in mind that god created the heavens and the earth and he said let there be light and we know that the spoken word is the original seed so in order for god to prove that he was god light actually had to come if god would have said let there be light and light never would have showed up then that god would have been found as a liar and it is impossible for god to lie now one of the first things god did in creation when he created light is he separated god is a great separator he separated the light from the darkness and god is is brother barron called him a segregationalist not a segregationist of color or nationality but he separates his people because he called us to be a called out people he called us to not be of the world but he called us to come out of her my people so god likes to separate his children and to make a distinction that this is his people and his presence overshadows his people so god divided the light from the darkness and when god created heaven and earth the infinite mind of god is so eternal we and our humanity cannot grasp the infinite mind of god when god created the heavens and he created the earth and he said and he created it we don't know how long that took every seed every seed of botany life that was to ever be on the earth was already in the earth it was only covered by water and then god began in his majestic creation to separate and move the water off to one side and let the dry land appear but the seed was already laying there at the time of creation god knew when he spun things from from his from his mighty hand the pine tree where it would be and the oak tree and all these things because the bible tells us that every seed is going to bring forth of his kind and the power of the sea the power of life the power of the reproduction was actually within the seed itself that is where the power is the power doesn't come from an outside source yes it is fueled by the sun but the power lies within the seed itself so when god created the earth he not only had the seeds of botany life and things already there but he already had our bodies laying there because we come from the earth so everything that our natural physical bodies consist of was already laying here in the earth because whenever we were in our mother's womb our mother ate of the earth and she got the nutrients and our bodies developed within her and we are of the earth that is why from earth we come from to earth we go back again that is the nature that is the cycle of it so whenever god created it he already deposited it so the ingredients that i said of our bodies was already here in the earth so if that was the way naturally then that is that is the way god sets things up naturally then the natural things that god made is for a spiritual reflection so if god did things that way naturally for us and he had everything already taken care of and the acorn was always an acorn and the oak tree will always be an oak tree then he did the same thing spiritually he had you in his mind in seed form before the foundation of the world you always were a part of god and you'll always be a part of god and the sea that god placed within us we still need to be born again the oak can the acorn can have all the you know there's an infinite number of acorns a countless number of acorns within an acorn okay there's countless so the only way to really be able to to to be able to see the power that lays within the only way to be able to enjoy the shade of the oak tree is to plant the acorn and the power within that seed will then begin to express itself through stages and end up being a mighty beautiful thing that you can admire and go and enjoy the shade of so everything that we have need of god places a seed into the soul of very of every elected child of god and you were with him you weren't aware of it just as we weren't aware of being in our great great great great great grandad but yet that does not change the fact that you were there just because you don't remember it and you can't place it doesn't mean you weren't there so you can come you come into this world and you have the as an elected child of god you've got the the germ of god the seed in you but it needs to be quickened just like the acorn can have all the potentials of the mighty shade tree and a trunk so large you can't even wrap your arms around it but it's bottled up in a little bitty acorn that you can hold a child can hold in its hand but in the right environment that seed then becomes quickened and the power from the acorn then becomes an oak tree that is what the born-again experience does to an elected child of god they come into the world and they are an elected gene of god but yet they still have worldly desires yet they still have a pull for the things of the world because they were born the way that we were all born but because what separates god is a great separator what separates an elected child of god from everyone else is that seed potential within your soul that whenever you hear the word of god for your day brother nathaniel and that is the light of the day it then quickens something within you even if you're the only one in your family if you're the only one in your neighborhood if you're the only one in your school if you're the only one on the workplace it quickens something within you because it was already there but yet it has to go through its process and to be born again just because someone is an elected child of god they cannot bypass the new birth no more than you can enjoy the shade of an acorn you've got to go through the birth process satan is always trying to get people to dodge the new birth because it's an unpleasant thing because if you've got to die to yourself you've got to get past your own thinking as we heard last night a seed has got to rot and die before it can live so god watches over his seed god is obligated to his seed the word because as a seed of god you are god's family so the word of god searches out the holy spirit in every age the word will find you and the word begins to call out to you no matter how far you run and where you try and hide and what you try and do the word of god will find you and when the s-o-n light of god then begins to strike your soul and you that is how you prove your predestination that is how you prove your election not by natural genealogy but by the ability that when you hear the word of god for your age you come to life you come to life because the light you cannot stop a germatized seed from coming to life when it's planted in the ground and every one of us an elected child of god has got the seed of god in the earth our flesh is earth is from the earth but within the earth you can't see that attribute no matter if you have open heart surgery or whatever any kind of operation you cannot find that drum of life naturally only god knows but whenever just like you put that seed in the earth you know it's then germatized and it's not some gmo dead seed you know it's germatized because when you plant it sister heather it comes up and you know you've got something original so whenever the whenever you have a gene seed of god deposited in your soul you and and your people around you know that because of your because whenever the the light of the day the light of the hour strikes your soul it brings you to life if you're a rock it will not bring you to life but a seed has no choice but to come to life brother jerry you don't have you have a choice but yet god predestinated you so you can't help seeing it is what i'm trying to say because god called you to it in second corinthians 4 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ so imagine telling someone that they're that imagine someone being in such a mental state that they are that they are denying that there's a sunshine outside that they that they refuse to see the sunlight that they don't believe you begin to try and describe to them of how warm it makes you feel and how wonderful it is and how it gives you light and how and how it does and able to grow your garden and they refuse and they go in the basement and refuse to believe that there's the sun outside yes you win there would be something mentally wrong with that person and there'd be something mentally wrong with spiritually wrong with a person that could that would deny the acts and the things that we've seen in this end time it is undeniable and god is obligated to you god will never fail you the devil may tell you that god has forgotten you but that's not true your human spirit will tell you god has forgotten you but that doesn't make it true until what god says is true and what god says that he would never leave you or forsake you now brother bran preached he referred to preaching about pastor lily you're you take you you listen to tapes you know that he talks about pastor lily a lily it's also called the lotus l-o-t-u-s and you can go online and look and there there there are some absolutely beautiful flowers now a lotus flower load of seed broth shannon it begins it has its origination not just in the earth but it has its origination in mud it has its origination at the bottom of a pond where all the silt settles where all the all the yuckiness of a pond as it was it all goes down there and settles and that is where this load of seed begins and as it begins to grow it grows and it stretches for the sunlight and it comes it can grow in up to eight feet of water and it goes but there's a driving force because it's a german because the germatized seed nothing can stop that flower from growing all the way up to the sunlight and when it gets to the sunlight it then blooms the most beautiful one of the most beautiful flowers you've ever seen and that's a lot like us we come from a very very muddy past we've come from a very very muddy beginning and many times whenever we but it takes the light of god to make us bloom and when we get there and we bloom in the presence of the sun people can see the the the the flower and the bees then begin to enjoy and the birds but they don't realize what it took you to get there they don't realize they enjoy the flower and we enjoy the beauty but you'd have to realize the mud that it came out of you we have to realize that it's the potential was within it to stretch for the sunlight now i was doing a little research on this lotus flower and we know that sometimes whenever you have a fruit tree if there's a drought it begins to you know can cast forth this fruit early it can be there's flowers we grew up in a nursery so i know just a few things about some flowers i forgot a lot but anyway there's a hydrangeas and we know that you can control the color of the bloom based on the acidity i don't remember which is which but you add lime or things you can make it blue and you can do things and it can be controlled by its environment if you want more roses you've got to plant them in the right type of type of soil the interesting thing about the lotus flowers they say are known to be think spiritually are known to be resistant to pollution and can even purify the water that they grow in you're not susceptible spiritually speaking when you come to the earth and you're reaching out and we were all born in mud and we all have a past that we're not happy about but there's no need in worrying about it there's no need in going back there's no need in caring that doesn't matter what matters is now that you've bloomed for the gospel of jesus christ you're god's flowers that's what matters now it doesn't matter what you came out of it doesn't matter what matters is that you have pressed forth and you've broken through and you're now living for jesus christ so eat so that you can even purify so you're not affected as a child of god as a holy ghost filled child of god when you go to school when you go to your workplace you're not affected by the pollution of the world you're not affected by your co-workers you in fact then give them something to enjoy because the atmosphere and presence that you have so each night they say they submerge into the murky water but each morning they re-bloom without the residue of their environment praise the lord they bloom and that's what we do despite what's going on in the world despite who's in the white house and how much we like it or how much we don't despite what the economy is doing despite what's happening to our 401ks we're blooming we're not we're not making our home down here we've got to plant our potatoes and do what you've got to do however we're looking up we're looking up so it took a lot of grace to get us from mud to bloom there's a lot of grace to take us from from down there to up here but we're not now that we don't go back to the mud we bloom in the presence of the sun now what is light now this morning we're speaking spiritually speaking we all know what light is naturally but everything in the natural is a type of the spiritual god made it made a buzzard to reflect the spiritual application but god made an eagle to reflect another spiritual application god made a crow to reflect one spiritual application and god made a dove to reflect another one it's mysteries that you can look at and we look at creation now and fall and see what god is doing so what is life brother adam says now if god said let there be light and there was no light that wasn't god said that see when god says anything he must back up what he says and when the word of god has been vindicated the word has been vindicated that is light now how does god vindicate his word he vindicates his word by bringing it to pass so when god said let there be light that was a sea that went out that was a spoken word that went out but when and so we don't know how long it took when god said let there be light he said it that was a seed but then whenever light appeared that then became a vindication that what god said was true so that is what real light is now the word itself the prophet speaking isn't light until it's a vindicated light so there's a process that it goes to from seed to light when it's spoken it's then a seed because the spoken word is the original seed but whenever it's manifested it's light let me give you an example god said that there'd be a church without spot or wrinkle that was a seed that was a spoken word is she here so then what does that make her the light of the hour that makes her the light of the day just as it made him the light jesus and we'll get to it here briefly but jesus was literally a manifestation of his own word so whenever the word prophesied that he would come forth it was then a seed it was circling the earth brother jason and then when it became when it when it planted itself in the in the virgin womb of mary and jesus breathed his first breath of air as our savior that was light because the word that was spoken is now made manifest so keep the title in mind let there be light so whenever we come to church and we hear the word preached it's for you when the word comes forth and it's for you the seed you grab it and you remember remember that parable that jesus spoke of the word is a seed so if we shout in the presence of god and amen and then we drop the seed right when we get to that back door it brings no fruit the seed has then got to be taken with us taken home and you don't put the you don't put the seed on your table you plant it you don't plant it in the natural earth you plant it in you you plant it in your soul in the ground of faith well a seed needs more than just dirt and seed also needs moisture and how do you how do you actually water the seed with praises with the holy ghost with faith with believing and then the sun shines on it and it will bring forth exactly what's already in the seed so if you need healing and you and and the healing is for you in the name of jesus christ healing is for you and if you say i believe that that it's not brother william's words it's god's word and you say i believe that and you take that seed and you take it with you and you let it get into your heart that is why we always have to prepare our hearts for service you don't just go in if you want to plant a garden and it's been winter and the grass is growing in the weeds you don't just go if you know anything about gardening you don't just throw seeds over all the weeds you got to till it first you got to prepare it first so that whenever the ground whenever you throw the seed on there you sow it it then you then can cover it up and expect a crop so we have to prepare our hearts how by prayer you pray for the minister you pray for the song leader you pray for the servants you pray for the saints and then whenever we come into his courts with thanksgiving in our hearts our heart is until and ready for the word that is how because remember if you come in here with a hard crusty spirit seed can't get in there when the spirit falls what happens whenever sometimes even when a drought happens and the water hits the earth it just runs off you want to be you want to be so open to the spirit you want to be so so plowed up dissed up to where whenever the word is preached that seed can fall in your heart don't let the birds get it don't go out and let the cares of this world choke up that seed because remember after the good after that good sorrow went and sowed seed whenever you go out there and you face monday morning on the job or in school you then have the enemy coming and sow seeds of doubt sow seeds of this sow seeds of that and if you aren't careful and you don't keep them plucked out they're going to grow faster weeds why is it that weeds always grow quicker than your crop but it does so then weeds of doubt will try and spring up and choke out the promise that you accepted then it don't become fruitful so it's god laying in the sunlight so when god said let there be light and it was vindicated then that is light in john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life in him was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not jesus is the light of the world there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light now john was jesus later identifies him as a light but what the scripture is saying is that he wasn't the light jesus christ is the light of the world so if john the if jesus had a forerunner the first time he came why do people have a problem with him having a forerunner the second time he came if john was a bright and shining light why do people have a problem with god sending a prophet to be a bright and shining light what god does once he's got to keep doing jesus said in john 5 35 he was talking to john he was a bright and shining light they were willing to walk for a season willing for a season to rejoice in his life now the message of the hour we call it the message of the hour because it is the light of the hour whenever the sun rises in every hour across the horizon the sun is in a different position so if you want light you have to be where the sun is so if that is the way naturally speaking if you want spiritual light you have to be brother mike you've got to be where the sun s-o-n is you cannot be if the sun is way over there in the horizon and it's getting ready to set we cannot be here in elkton virginia upset that the sun is getting ready to set and we want the sun to be here if you want the light you've got to go west so to be in the light you've got to be where the light is now that's really simple but when you really think about it spiritually that is actually a pretty a pretty profound thought you've got because the message like i said is the light of the hour it is the first step in the second coming of the lord jesus christ and we are a superbly blessed people to be made privy of this because the church world is expecting jesus to break the eastern sky and to come down and for the resurrection to be on fox news the second coming of the lord is a secret and so whenever god sent a prophet he is tipping us off to this so how do we know because when god sent this message to us it is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it is literally a repetition an exact repetition brother shannon of the very ministry that jesus christ had the first time the word foretold that this message would come just like the word foretold that the messiah would be born of a virgin jesus himself referred to brother browner you say how he when he was speaking to his disciples in matthew 17 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall that's in the future first come and restore all things now when john the baptist introduced jesus christ did he introduce a part of jesus just or did he introduce all of jesus christ he introduced all he jesus wasn't just an old testament prophet an old testament prophet was a part of god moses was a part of god noah was part of god david was a part of god but when jesus came he was all of god amen so if john the baptist introduced all of god then so will elijah come and in this day introduce jesus christ fully so in verse 12 but i say unto you now he's speaking of john the baptist that elijah is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listened listed likewise also shall the son of man suffer of them this message is identified with the pillar of fire just like jesus was this message brought the exact same ministry just as he did the first time what you read about in the pages of the bible think about what a blessed people we are how many millions of people brother thomas do people read in the scriptures and say i wish god still did that i wish i lived in bible days again i wish that i could see the eyes of the blind open but we read it and we can say amen he does it in our day god sent the word he does the exact same thing we are living in bible days this is the greatest hour to be living in this is the greatest hour to be walking around with a promise in our hearts brother joe that we're actually expecting a body change we're actually expecting a body change we're actually expecting our loved ones the ones that are dead in christ to raise from the dead we believe that we're walking in that faith because of the word that's been sent to us because we know there's a land beyond the river because god allowed his prophet to go there remember what he said he said that when i wa he said we always thought he said before the opening of the seals he said we thought that everyone would go up there and play harps and and just float around on clouds and he'd see brother neville but couldn't shake his hand but when god translated him he realized there he can touch him he can hug him he's seen his converts there he's seen you there he's seen me there god allowed him to be caught up brother jeffrey and see that and then to come back and say there's a land beyond the river when his first wife passed away he says remember she told him she said brother bill why'd you call me back she said you preached about it you've talked about it but you don't know what it is she was experiencing something at that time that the prophet himself didn't know he believed him but he didn't know but there came a time that he that god took him up and he was able to see sister mita think about this he's seen sister mita and her theophany while sister mita was asleep next to him she wasn't crossed over so whenever he was caught there he was caught there because god needed a representative brother to come back and tell us that place is real don't stop whatever you do get perfect love because nothing but perfect love is going to get in there and the bible says if you say you love god but hate your brother you're in darkness so love is connected to light so we had god allowed us to have a prophet to come back and say that place is real that place is real don't you stop it gave him such a renewed passion to preach his gospel like never before this message has got three pulls just like jesus did this message is rejected like jesus did was people love the fishes and the loaves people love the miracles but when he turned around one day brother don and he said i and my father are one who that got him everybody loved the prophet everybody loved the miracles everybody loved the money to bring in everybody loved the crowds but whenever he then stood up and began to preach his doctrine the doctrine of jesus christ it wasn't his they rejected him that's how you know jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever because it repeats itself remember spirits people die but spirits don't the spirits that crucified jesus christ when he was here on the earth and literally nailed them to a cross in them pharisees are not in them spirit them the flesh man is gone but the spirit is still here and it still crucifies the word of the hour this message makes us aware and lifts our spiritual amnesia it lists our spiritual amnesia and it tells us where we came from and where we're going it takes us all the way from where were you when i lay the foundations of the earth and the sons of god shouted for joy it takes you from there you know where you are you were in the mind of god before the foundations of the world were laid you are already in his mind it takes us from there all the way to behold i create a new heavens and new earth we can see the entire picture because he is unveiled before us he's available for us in luke 17 very familiar scripture for jesus speaking here for as the lightning that lighteth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under the heaven so shall the son of man be in his day but first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroy them all even thus shall it be jesus was speaking of a future day that's this day even thus shall it be when the son of man is revealed it's very important to understand that god didn't send us a prophet just for head knowledge saints we it gives us faith and understanding you say why is it so important to understand well in the bible there was a sarah phoenician woman who needed something her daughter was grievously vexed with the devil and she approached god and called him thou son of david well she was a gentile and she didn't get what she wanted until she became god's provided way of worship god wants to be worshipped a certain way and that is where we've got to get beyond our own thinking the world has got to get beyond their own thinking they can't have you we can't have a cain mentality say it's got to be this way or i'm sorry wherever god is that's where i want to be wherever the light is that's where i want to be because if you're not in the light you're in darkness and when you're in darkness you're going to stumble it's only human nature whenever they're lost and you hear stories of people getting stranded and they're lost and they're stranded for you know for days in the wilderness and just pitch blackness when they see the slightest little light they're attracted to it because that means there's a hope for being found that means there's a hope for rescue when they're out at sea and the storms are raging and they get a glimpse of that shoreline no matter how the waves are tossed and they get a glimpse of a lighthouse then they then know to go there so how much more spiritually if you're in darkness whenever you see the light this bright and shining light that you actually run to it now remember brother mark made a comment yesterday about the light that the light should be used to light the scripture not to be blinded at god sent us a prophet to be a light on the scripture not to concentrate on and ignore the scripture remember the story of the statue of liberty when brother went up there and there were little dead little birds everywhere and he asked the god what what is it he said we had an awful storm last night and he said instead of using the light to guide them they were flying into the light and they got killed god has sent light upon the scripture so that we'll know how to walk in so you hear the term son of man son of man god comes in three sons names and it's important because that is what has the church world all confuses because they believe there's three gods how is it that god god the father and god the son it's simply dispensations and it's a dispensation it's just how god deals with his people for a certain period of time so whenever god came to the earth in jesus christ he kept calling himself son of man son of man because he was the god prophet in the old testament the prophets were called son of man son of man well then they crucified the son of man well he died he took our sins to hell and he ascended well where was god then god changed masks he then stepped into the dispensation of the son of god the holy spirit and he then could come and live in you it's the same god that just changes his sensation his brother and dramatized it the same when he went to that play and the same actor just changed mass that's all god does so he's son of god holy ghost he dealt with the church ages with the holy spirit and then in the millennium jesus christ who's now the holy ghost will come down and we will physically literally see him in his corporal body and he will literally be ruling and reigning with us for a thousand years jesus christ will literally be on the earth you can literally touch him you'll literally spill the nail prints in his hands there's a lot of things we won't remember none of our past we won't remember none of the mud you won't remember nothing but one thing that god i believe will allow us to remember is them nail prints he's going to leave that nail prints in his hands and a scar in his side as a memorial of what he did for us remember when he makes himself known to the jews and they ask him where did you get them scars what happened he said in the house of my friends he didn't say and you are the ones that killed me you jews he said in the house of my friends love covers a multitude of sins so he came the first time as son of man he's then in the church ages as son of god and he'll be in the millennium as son of david but it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now he was son of man here he was son of god here and he'll be son of david but in between son of god and son of david he returns back in the son of man ministry and that is what this church is built on on the son of man ministry revealing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever doing the exact same works that he did when he came the first time as son of man jesus said even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed but it's a secret coming the church world knows him as the son of god and they're looking for him to come as son of david they don't see this son of man ministry with the same sign jesus himself said as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah the same sign is given god veiled behind flesh brother branham was not god but god came and stepped into his prophet would turn around with his back to the people and begin to discern thoughts who was that he wasn't a man it's the son of man ministry again but you know that ministry is not to the world he had opportunities to fly on airplanes he had opportunities to be televised nationally but he wouldn't sell out because it was not meant for the world it was meant for the bride it's the bridegroom call it's the come here it's the latter that romeo put up to juliet's window that's what this message is and we're such a blessed people to be made aware of it and to understand and to hear the bridegroom call and to walk in the light of the hour it's where god is i want to be where he is so if people can break and get beyond their own thinking and if he don't come in my methodist box then i don't want then i'm sorry or if he didn't come out of the pentecostals or he don't come from this church or that church it doesn't matter god bypassed the entire thing and went and got a seventh grade education man from kentucky with common complexes just like you have just like i have and he and he took that humble man and he raised him up and gave him and the angel of the lord would come to him and give him such inspiration and divine revelation that it would astound theologians when jesus was 12 years old he went remember when they lost him in jerusalem there at the feast he had he had he had the the high priest and he had an educated people absolutely just confounded with the wisdom he didn't get that from himself so praise the lord for the light in zechariah 14 7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light this is the light of the hour walking in it children walking in it when god moves you move and that goes that way that's from a church age that's even in your own life when god is trying to take you to a higher level follow him john 12 46 i am come enlightened to the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness as i said earlier that god does natural things that we can look and it condenses great mysteries just like the sun rises from east to west it cannot be denied by the biggest atheist there is it cannot be denied that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west amen well as the sun does that so does the spiritual sign as the sun raises in the east and sets in the west so god shine his word on the eastern people first and it begin to move west and it began to move west as god unfolded himself he started in the book of acts there that was on the eastern people the apostle paul and then it moved over the reformation and it kept moving then john wesley was a little further west and then it crossed the sea in this end time and brother william branham came out of america you can't go no further west you're back east again so that means we're at the end time as the as the light shines so does the spiritual light so if jesus christ was the light of the world the light of the world and it was a vindication of the word what does that make if he being the head what does that make the body the same thing where the head goes the body must follow so if he was the light of the world you're the light of the world you're the city that's set on a hill that cannot be hid in saint john 3 now this is this this is jesus speaking he's not pulling any punches he said he that believeth on him is not condemned he but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and man love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil that there judges the entire do you realize that that statement there by jesus christ himself judges the entire church world whenever god sent this message he didn't do it in a corner he took his profit from from the hills of kentucky but that's not where he performed the miracles uh his entire ministry that's not where it's not in some corner it's to the world these you know so many message churches now are broadcasting their services to the whole world the prophet sermons are being translated and going to the whole world we're not ashamed of this gospel but the condemnation is that light was presented to them but yet they chose darkness instead of the light that's where the condemnation comes in is whenever they're presented with the truth and they choose darkness over light jesus makes a very interesting statement in luke 11 35 he says take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness so that sounds kind of strange how can light be darkness well the pharisees and the sadducees have the law of moses that was the light of the hour at one point but then whenever the the that light came they crucified it so the light that they thought they had of moses and the sabbath-keeping and all the laws and commandments it then became darkness to them because they rejected the light when it came so the each of these denominations now some of you school teachers can probably help me up front here but the denominator is a part of a uh and i may not get this right forgive me but just generally speaking a denominator is kind of like a part of a fraction of an entire number something along them lines close enough okay so we understand that a denomination is part of a hole you can't i don't recommend it but you can sit in a denominational church and find something to say amen about the brother can come out and he can say something jesus christ the son of god believe on the name of the lord jesus christ you know and be saved and all these things and you can you can find something to say amen about but yet there's not full light it's not total light but we want to walk in light we don't want because see each denomination has got a portion of light and when that light came they said well this is it this is what we believe and even though god moved on they wouldn't follow the light so the light they had became darkness the light they had now became darkness and now they're you know giving away free hot dogs for for for membership or doing whatever has anyone here ever gotten a car from brother ron or from andrew saying please come to church would you promise to come to church at least three months out of the year it's laughable it's laughable why because the word draws you here the word is what draws you here there's a deep that's calling to the deep and because he said where the carcass is the eagles will be gathered together now if you're not feeling good or you may you know they may check up on you that's not what i'm saying that's just love and that's just you know you okay and let us know if you need anything that's different but i'm talking about commitment cards or something silly like that never have never will because if the word doesn't satisfy your soul there's nothing for you here there's nothing for you here but the word if you can't take eagle food let me put it this way there's no you know when you have chickens and things there's always scraps off the dinner table and there's potato peels and there's carrot shavings or whatever there's none of that here there's there's no chicken food here this is this is carcass this is meat we're meat eaters here no offense to any vegetarians we are spiritual meat eaters we're meat eaters here the eagles got a beak to rip the chicken has got a little scratch here but we have a beak and we want meat we want the word of the hour we want the fresh kill and whenever we circle we circle and we we see where there's a fresh kill that's where the eagles come right where the light is the buzzers they're looking for something dead they're looking for that that stench they're looking for that that's what that's what gets them going we've only got fresh meat here we've got fresh meat over here jesus said no man when he lighted a candle put it in a secret place when your light gets lit sister whitney when your light gets lit you're going to tell somebody about it you want to let others know hey i may not be able to explain how it happened but this is how my light got lit and then you begin to shine your light neither putteth under a bushel but on a candlestick that all which come in may see the light in saint john 8 31 this is also very very important and that judges the entire church world then jesus said to those jews which believed on him now let's read that real slow then jesus said to those jews which believed on him they weren't unbelievers they weren't people at that time ready to crucify him they were believers they were following the ministry he then said if ye continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed that's crucial because he knew that he only had a certain amount of time left and then he would have a body that would pick up and that he would then begin to do the works through his church so he knew that the elect of that age would be in the upper room he then knew that they would be with paul he knew they'd be with peter and they would follow the word if you continue in my word so how many people that call themselves christians call themselves a disciple of jesus christ and they don't continue in the word jesus said we're in first john he said if you walk in the light that god is light and in him is no darkness at all but if ye walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin that's how you're a real disciple of jesus christ is whenever the word unfolds and you go with it that proves that you're seed because you're growing amen do you know how you know you're born again is when you grow is when real spiritual birth real growth not you know you do better for your neighbor now than you did last year about this time or you give them or or you do something that you wouldn't normally that's that's just good works and that has this place i'm talking real spiritual maturity and growth where you can look down you you lotus flower can look down and say oh i came from a muddy beginning i really had a stretch forth for the sun but now i'm a bloom for jesus christ i'm a bloom for jesus christ and someone can come by and enjoy the beauty not the beauty within yourself but the beauty of the character of jesus christ the secret to having is giving if you want more of god give more of your time to him if you want more time because it all seems to be getting away from us then give more time to god if you want more blessings invest more in the kingdom i'm not i'm not talking monetarily here necessarily i'm talking with your time with your prayers prayer is so important prayer is so important how many times will brother branham give credit to the success of his meetings to some widow woman praying somewhere how many times would he give success to brother kidd and all in his ministry to his wife cracking corn on on the railroad tracks and things it's prayer that does it you can't do nothing apart from prayer and brother ram said in in in christ is revealed in his own word now the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling the unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculpture unveiling his work of statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering is not only the revelation of jesus christ but it is the revelation of his future works in the oncoming seven church ages so right now jesus christ is not here in his corporate body but he's in his bride amen he's veiled behind human flesh he's in the bride right now see down through the church age we've started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come through the feet luther so imagine there being a statue here of of of a man or a human and as the sculpture begins you're the audience and the sculpture it's all he's worked on it put so much time and love and care into it and it's just an absolute masterpiece and he goes and he begins to unveil it and all he gets to is the feet and you get upset oh i seen it that's awesome and you run out have you really seen it but do you know that's what people did spiritually whenever the feet being like luther as god was revealing himself and his bride and as soon as the move of god went and god is getting ready to show himself in the beauty of of his bride and when people seen just the feet they denominated like luther and said oh we got it whenever the sculpture goes a little bit higher we don't want it we do we just want the feet within the sculpture god continues to lift up that blanket and it exposes a little bit more now you can see the legs and that was the methodist and then they then then they get up and jump out and run it ain't over yet continue ye in the light so then as the sculpture continues to unveil the masterpiece and then it's the body of christ working from the feet to the head he is the head so as it works its way up it works his way to the mouth and that's pentecost that's tongues gifts well they get up and run out they think they've seen it all they think they've arrived they think that's the head that's it this is god's this is god's promise it was god's promise but it wasn't done yet sit still it wasn't done yet and then god unveils a little bit higher and you see the eyes the eyes is a symbol of a prophet a prophet that can look and see what's coming down the road do you know the eyes is the last moving faculty you have in your body that you can move you can maybe move your nose you can move your lips and different parts of your body your eyes eyebrows that's it after that is the mind so after god sends a prophet this message the last move of god what's next but the intelligence the very mind of christ himself and that's given to you remember what he said in the church book those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord for they keep still now if a word is a thought expressed it's got to come through the mind so if the bride has thus saith the lord she doesn't speak nothing that the mind of the lord hasn't given her to speak so we have the mind of the lord but if he didn't say it then we better keep still where the lord has spoken let us speak where he's kept silent let us keep silent that is why you've never seen one thus saith the lord fell in this message that's why you've never seen one thus saith the lord fell on tape because it wasn't the mind of a man no matter how impossible no matter how much then bones were crushed in that little boy from finland no matter how that little two inch fish no matter how much of his intros were pulled out it didn't matter thus saith the lord spoke it and it had to happen because that is the mind of the lord and that is the age we're coming to that is what is promised but it can't be within ourselves it's got to be the mind of the lord they know that it has to be god doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all of his work while in this earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride that's very humbling that you're god's body that you are the body of jesus christ on the earth she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he would now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time so we're light we're the light of the hour not within our flesh in our flesh there is no good thing in ourselves in our humanistic capabilities there's nothing we have to offer nothing you can offer to god nothing you can do we're all creatures from the mud we're all seeds they're just in the mud but that is what separates that that's the thing that is what separates the elect from everyone else is the seed the predestination that god placed within you to have a reaction to the light because remember when spiritual light when it goes over it is not quick in the rocks it does not quicken the non-germatic seed it quickens the seeds so you go from seed to light from prophetic word to manifestation one day a prophet said despite of how it made himself sound even to his own ears he said the people that shine that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath light shined and then jesus hundreds of years later he does something and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is by the sea coast and the borders of zebulun and nepthala it sounds simple he just he just moved that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet see it was a seed at that time it was just spoken but then it was circling circling and jesus was upon the earth and he had this seat to fulfill he had this bit of portion of scripture fulfilled he had this one and he was aware of it and he walked in in the father's will and this scripture was fulfilled this scripture was fulfilled this scripture was fulfilled that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of nephthalem by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region of the and the shadow of death light is sprung up why is it that before your conversion you hated church or you had no thought for church or you can ever imagine being in church you never read the bible you never prayed you couldn't care less but all of a sudden you look back eight feet back as it was referring back to that lotus flower you look eight feet back and you say man god brought me out of some serious mud it was awfully dark down there but one day you thought that was your only world because sometimes the lotuses can stay dormant there was one there was one load of sea they said they found that estimated to be 1300 years old and they planted it and it came up so sometimes they based on the seasons they can sometimes lay dormant and you can just be living your life in darkness and think you've got it made or realize you don't have it made however you're still in mud and you're sitting there in mud and you think that's your only world and you think that's all you've got in that sticky nasty mud but then one day whenever the season is just right that sun begins to to come over that nasty old pond you're in at the very bottom nobody even knows you're there but god does and that sunlight that warm sunlight begins to warm the water the right time of the year it's july or august warms up the water and something stirs up in you you've been laying in that mud for years and years and years maybe even for generations family speaking your family has got no history of christianity your family has got no history of doing good it doesn't matter it don't matter no matter what kind of last name you're born with your everyone is born in the mud but whenever that sunshine begins to light all of a sudden something there's there's a spiritual chemistry change within the very depths of your soul and you begin to all of a sudden feel like something is stirring within you god is trying to quicken that seed with the presence of his light and then all of a sudden you burst forth and there's still a lot of darkness between where you are and where you got to be but you keep going and the more you grow and the more you stretch for the light the higher you get the less dark it becomes and then you burst forth and you bloom you bloom for the glory of god and do you know that whenever the sun goes down they close up they need the sun to shine to their potential they need the sun to shine to their potential and the sun is up in this end time the sun is up it's harvest time and when you whenever the farmers plant their crop and everything god has seasons time so perfectly because when the wheat comes up and it's only this tall it cannot handle the july and august sun it's got to mature first it's got to mature and when it gets strong enough to be able to support that kind of sun and then it's time to bake all the greenness all the immaturity all the spiritual immaturity it's time to be baked out and the more spiritual immaturity that begins to be baked out the the heads begin to bow the green ones are still up the more that god revealed to this prophet the more humble brother branham became they say after the seals he was not the same the more you have the more god entrusts you with the more is required of you to whom much is given much is required we have a pearl of great price we have a priceless pearl in our possession god is is going to hold us responsible to how we live to this word amen because we are without excuse every single service service in and serve us out god does the miraculous if you're not aware of it that is because of your own spiritual condition but god does something and he says something in every single service and every single tape you listen to god has got something for you and every single leaf of the bible god has got something for you so let us rise and shine let us be lights not lights the bible is more than just good works god didn't come and just die and die the horrible death that he died just we'll be better neighbors just so that we can donate to build hospitals or just so we all that's fine it's wonderful it helps humanity but god has done so much more than that god has called us to be lights to our generation a city set on a hill that the word will literally live itself out through you that the word that you read about the very the very fruits of the spirit the very way jesus walked the way jesus talked is actually people can see it's actually not just here it's five foot tall it's five and a half foot tall it's got a dress and long hair it's got clean cut haircut it's got a beard it's got no hair that covers everybody it's got flesh flesh and blood that's what god wants he's coming you remember and i'm coming to a close here i didn't get to nowhere near this but do you remember that story brother tells that little boy that was so scared that lightning was was thunder was clapping and he just called his mom and he was just so scared and she prayed him and said son it's okay it's just just you know jesus is with us he'll he'll protect us what's wrong and he said i want jesus with some skin off he wanted a mama to sleep with him he wanted jesus with some skin off so that's what this world is looking for he's looking for jesus the world's looking for reality there's so much fake in this world and let me just say this because i just feel to go here you young people everything you see in advertisements everything you see in let's just say it's in movies or whatever or billboards or social media 99.9999 of it is fake it's fake whether it's looks praise the lord whether it's looks whether it's a certain um lifestyle they're trying to project and what what does that do it's a trap it's a trap because then it makes you chase something that is not really real you know and you have young and this has been going on for decades but it's really ramped up now in the age that we live in you have young people that chase a certain look or a certain body or whatever it may be and then they find themselves over the hill if you will and they haven't achieved it because they're changing they're they're chasing a mirage this word is not a mirage if he said that you can be the statue of a perfect man you'll get there you're making progress that's what god has called us to do musicians can come on up if you can stand with me you know when brother bram was preaching the church ages he was preaching the church ages and he was going through each church age and he was drawn on a blackboard the moon and about how much darkness and the light of the moon was actually represented by the elect of each given age they were classified as the light because the church is the type of the moon so there was so much darkness in each age and as according to the amount of word they had revealed for their given age was signified by the light well at the end of that service there's this wasn't done in a corner this was in a service packed out the tabernacle the pillar of fire comes down and on the very back wall begins to project the exact same thing supernaturally that brother brandon just drew on the blackboard that was god's vindication of the message that was god's vindication one of the many that said that whatever my servant just taught you was right he drew it with chalk and god projected it on the back and the pillar of fire now brother graham said that therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride but the manifestation of the hour god said you would be here that was seed and now you're here believing his word that makes you light you are the light of the world jesus said i'm the light yep but you're his body you know jesus said i am the light and then he comes around and says ye are the light of the world a city that's set on a hill cannot be hit and you know in the new heavens and the new earth whenever everything is set up just so wonderfully and every pain will be over every old age any kind of care and concern will all be wiped away the bible says the city had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof his son had a beginning this s-u-n had a beginning and it's got an end last story uh brother ram told of a little girl remember when they went down in that cave in carlsbad new mexico they went down in a cave and that guy turned off the light and it was just so dark so dark there's a little boy a little girl in there and they being that little this little boy's little sister began just screaming her little head off she was terrified it was dark and that little boy reached out and comforted her and he said don't fear little sister there is a man here that can turn on the light you may be in a dark cave this morning you may be in the pits of despair you may be in the mud and you feel like you've been in mud for a long time but don't fear there is a man here that can turn on the light you do your best to live for god and you sometimes you can just feel the pressure of the age and and the evil age that we live in and you feel the darkness that you go out and everywhere you look just darkness darkness everywhere you turn there's darkness the news is darkness everything is darkness but one day there's a man here that will turn on the light and the promise of the resurrection and the promise of the body change will go from seed to light right now it's a promise right now we hold it in our heart it's a seed we believe it we just cultivate and we water it with the holy spirit when we think of our loved ones and then passed on we water the promise i'll see them again this ain't final i'll see them again you water that seed every day month goes by a year go by you miss them but you keep watering that seed i'll see them i'll see them i'll see them and one day it'll be light they'll come amen let's inspirations to gracious
