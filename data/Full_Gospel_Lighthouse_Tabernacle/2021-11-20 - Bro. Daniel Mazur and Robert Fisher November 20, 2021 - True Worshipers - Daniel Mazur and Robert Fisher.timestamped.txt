[42:10] and before i go any further i bring you
[42:12] greetings from the church beg home from
[42:13] our pastor brother yatzek and all the
[42:16] congregation
[42:17] our assembly is in poland but half of
[42:19] the church comes from czech across the
[42:20] border
[42:22] and uh we love this message
[42:25] forgive me my english it's far from
[42:26] perfection you know so
[42:28] so take what i think okay
[42:30] so if i do a mistake
[42:32] there is a spirit of god amen
[42:35] because the god we serve is the same in
[42:37] our country he's the same here
[42:39] and this message is equipped from the
[42:41] power from above
[42:43] hallelujah
[42:45] praise the lord
[42:48] we know satan is warring against that
[42:51] little group that is called the bride of
[42:52] jesus christ
[42:53] but brothers and sisters we're so close
[42:57] we are
[42:58] overcomers
[43:00] we are not quitters we are overcomers
[43:02] there is another nature inside of us and
[43:05] this message revealed that nature
[43:08] hallelujah praise the lord
[43:10] and
[43:11] and i thank the lord for the message of
[43:13] this hour you know nobody talked me into
[43:16] that message
[43:18] i am so thankful for that
[43:21] because if somebody would talk me in
[43:24] there would be maybe somebody else to
[43:25] talk me out
[43:27] but i realize more and more
[43:30] that i am part of that message
[43:33] aren't you happy for that
[43:35] you know there is something inside of
[43:37] the bride of jesus christ that was
[43:38] quickened by the message of that hour
[43:41] praise the lord just if you can open
[43:44] john chapter four uh
[43:46] two of us came you know my brother
[43:48] robert he's from poland i am from czech
[43:50] and
[43:51] uh we're trying to bring you one one
[43:54] meeting or one sermon
[43:56] praise the lord because we all preach
[43:58] from the open book
[44:00] the book of redemption was opened aren't
[44:02] you happy for that all the mysteries
[44:04] were finished praise the lord
[44:06] not for our heads to be puffed up and so
[44:09] that we might have a intellectual
[44:11] knowledge of that message
[44:13] that's not enough
[44:15] what we need is the new birth
[44:17] what we need is the revelation that
[44:19] comes from above
[44:21] praise the lord that's why brother
[44:22] branham said what the church ought to be
[44:25] praying for the most is for the
[44:27] revelation
[44:28] because when the revelation strikes your
[44:30] heart you cannot be the same
[44:33] then the old things are passed away
[44:36] everything becomes new
[44:38] how come because of the revelation
[44:41] not that you know here but you know here
[44:44] hallelujah
[44:45] praise the lord amen oh hallelujah i
[44:49] felt a little bit tired we we came five
[44:51] hours and brother jackie benton he
[44:53] wanted to be here with us and he sent
[44:55] his worm christian greetings to you but
[44:57] it was just a little bit too much for

[47:25] worshipers
[47:26] the true worshippers and and uh i'm i'm
[47:30] so thankful you know
[47:32] that we live in the hour
[47:34] that we live
[47:36] it's the golden age can you say amen
[47:41] because all that the
[47:43] bible was prophesying about
[47:46] and all that that was written there as a
[47:49] prophecy
[47:50] we are living at the end time when all
[47:52] those prophecies are being fulfilled
[47:55] before our eyes
[47:58] and you know when we see that happening
[47:59] there is something
[48:01] in the hearts of the bride because she
[48:03] is procrastinated to believe that
[48:05] message can you say amen
[48:08] and i'm so thankful to that that that's
[48:10] we are not believing men's ideas it was
[48:13] the prophet of god who was vindicated by
[48:16] the pillar of fire
[48:18] and it was he was the mouthpiece of god
[48:20] that spoke to us and we are here now
[48:24] in 2021
[48:26] there is someone that is believing that
[48:29] there is an inner voice praise the lord
[48:32] for that oh glory to god there are some
[48:35] true worshipers
[48:37] hallelujah you know this is a special
[48:40] hour this is a rapture time
[48:42] this is a going home time how many of
[48:43] you feels like like that
[48:46] we can see the world is falling apart
[48:49] we in europe you know they said germany
[48:51] what a great economic they say it's the
[48:54] engine of the european union and they
[48:56] said well they they are so high
[48:59] there is nothing that can shake it
[49:02] the engine is choking
[49:05] they cannot go any further there is
[49:07] something happening all around the world
[49:09] because everything what can be shaken
[49:12] must be shaken
[49:14] but there is something that cannot be
[49:16] shaken
[49:17] oh glory to god
[49:19] satan sends some diseases he sends you
[49:22] know sicknesses he sends his demons but
[49:26] there is something that he cannot say
[49:28] brother and sisters how privileged
[49:30] people we are
[49:33] that we are not talking about it there
[49:35] is message inside of us living through
[49:37] us
[49:39] praise the lord for that hallelujah it's
[49:42] going home time amen this message came
[49:45] you know it's not the reformation age
[49:47] that we are living in amen they were
[49:49] under the men's anointing but today we
[49:51] received a message from above that is
[49:54] equipped with the power from above it's
[49:57] anointed with the anointing of the
[49:58] flying eagle
[50:01] it's not an eagle that is sitting
[50:02] somewhere
[50:04] you know a sitting eagle
[50:06] and you know the devil comes he's
[50:07] hammering on your on your feelings hey
[50:10] man how many of you can say amen to that
[50:14] he hammers me
[50:15] he comes to my head he sends thoughts
[50:18] amen but there is something inside of us
[50:22] brother branham said you cannot stop
[50:24] those thoughts coming but there is
[50:26] something that you can do
[50:28] you can shake it off
[50:30] and you can say i am a son of god i am a
[50:33] daughter of god there is something
[50:35] inside of my heart that answered the
[50:37] eagle scream
[50:39] glory to god
[50:41] praise the lord we were protesting
[50:44] to
[50:45] to to believe that message amen
[50:48] praise the lord this is a revelation
[50:50] time
[50:51] the time of the revealed word amen the
[50:54] time of the open book hallelujah
[50:57] when john heard his name
[50:59] when he was taken up
[51:01] before the throne of god you know his
[51:04] weeping was over
[51:06] because he heard his name
[51:08] something inside of her of him started
[51:11] to rejoice
[51:12] because the voice said weep not john
[51:15] and john was typing the pride
[51:18] praise the lord for that amen you know
[51:20] when and i was looking here in chapter
[51:22] of john you know that story very well
[51:25] but
[51:26] it's dear to my heart
[51:28] there is nothing new that i'm talking to
[51:30] you but
[51:31] it's coming from my heart as a part of
[51:32] my testimony
[51:34] you know why i was i was going i was
[51:36] born in the message family and and uh my
[51:39] dad was one of the first to accept the
[51:41] message back in 1968 in czech republic
[51:44] and uh
[51:45] he came out of the pentecostal church
[51:47] and and uh
[51:49] i was the last boy in the family and and
[51:52] you know the satan wanted to push me to
[51:54] the world
[51:55] and i said well i i'm gonna go to the
[51:57] world and enjoy it but i thank the lord
[52:00] that god had another plan
[52:03] praise the lord aren't you happy god had
[52:04] another plan
[52:07] and there was there was something that i
[52:09] wanted to do but there was something
[52:11] greater in me than he that is in the
[52:13] world
[52:15] praise the lord there was a pull in my
[52:17] heart there was something in my soul
[52:19] that i didn't know
[52:21] and there is what there was a you know
[52:23] in chapter of john there is jesus and
[52:26] just for a moment
[52:28] i want to thank you for a journey amen
[52:30] it's not a fairy tale story that really
[52:32] happened
[52:34] there was jesus and he called his
[52:36] disciples they were with him and
[52:37] remember they were jews amen
[52:40] full blooded jews and they were very
[52:43] proud of that
[52:44] that's how jews were you know they were
[52:46] very uh
[52:48] they wanted a pure blood amen that's why
[52:51] they call themselves we are jews
[52:54] everything pertain to us
[52:57] yeah we have the law of moses you know
[53:00] we are pure blooded amen
[53:03] we have our temple
[53:05] they're in jerusalem there is our place
[53:07] of worship
[53:09] we go there every year you know they
[53:11] kept all the laws everything all the
[53:14] tradition they kept
[53:17] my
[53:18] many times in the message the folks you
[53:20] know we keep all the traditions
[53:23] amen
[53:24] brothers and sisters when we have it all
[53:26] in our head it's not enough
[53:31] you know but there were also samaritans
[53:33] i just want to like a little background
[53:35] you know the the jews they hated
[53:38] samaritans for one reason
[53:40] that they were a mixture
[53:42] they were not pure blood amen
[53:46] they could not trace themselves purely
[53:49] amen in their flesh in their blood the
[53:51] natural blood they were mixture between
[53:53] jews
[53:55] and gentiles
[53:57] hallelujah aren't you heavy for the
[53:59] grace of god
[54:01] you know those jews were so proud
[54:04] they could say
[54:05] my dad was a jew
[54:07] my mother was a pure blood jew that's
[54:10] why i am a pure blood jew
[54:14] but samaritans
[54:16] they couldn't say that
[54:18] they were a mixture
[54:19] that's why jews hated samaritan so much
[54:23] that when they wanted to go
[54:25] from judea to galilee the shortest way
[54:28] was through samaria
[54:30] but they would take a bypass through
[54:32] jericho and then and you know maybe go
[54:36] at 10
[54:37] hours more
[54:39] but they said
[54:40] our food didn't step on that you know
[54:43] filthy land of samaria
[54:45] nothing good can come out of samaria
[54:49] that's what they thought
[54:51] but when jesus came
[54:53] he was a god in flesh
[54:56] and he came to redeem those that was
[54:58] lost it was a son of man ministry amen
[55:02] praise the lord and there in this filthy
[55:05] land of samaria
[55:07] the jews didn't even look upon them but
[55:09] there was a predestinated seed laying
[55:12] somewhere there
[55:15] glory to god and jesus was in his son of
[55:17] man ministry and he came to seek for
[55:20] those that were lost
[55:22] the message of the hour brothers and
[55:23] sisters the son of man ministry again in
[55:26] the prophet william branham
[55:29] can you say amen
[55:31] the ministry came at the very end time
[55:33] to call out the bride of every nation
[55:36] every tongue glory to god to give us
[55:40] rapturing faith
[55:41] because we're going home
[55:44] you know
[55:46] i feel really liberty brother
[55:50] you don't come from elkton virginia
[55:54] i don't come from czech republic brother
[55:56] robert doesn't come from poland
[55:57] we come from the glory
[56:01] we have a heavenly citizenship amen
[56:04] we come from god and we are on our way
[56:06] back to god
[56:07] hallelujah
[56:08] praise the lord
[56:10] we were born into the kingdom
[56:13] because we were in him in the beginning
[56:16] that's why we believe that message
[56:19] glory to god
[56:22] we didn't become a seed when we heard
[56:23] about this message amen
[56:25] because we were seed from the beginning
[56:28] that's why we believe that message
[56:31] praise the lord i know it's nothing new
[56:33] but i came to encourage you along the
[56:34] way that you have brothers and sisters
[56:36] back in czech republic and poland that
[56:39] believe the same message amen
[56:41] maybe we don't speak your language maybe
[56:43] we cannot know all your songs but we
[56:46] love the message of the hour the same
[56:49] spirit of god
[56:51] is falling upon us how he falls upon you
[56:55] thank you lord
[56:57] praise the lord
[56:59] amen
[57:01] so i i think it was quite of a statement
[57:05] when when jesus you know he said he was
[57:08] coming he was heading towards galilee
[57:11] they were in judea
[57:13] the shortest way through samaria but all
[57:15] the jews they go bypass
[57:18] so when jesus said let's go
[57:21] the disciples in their mind they said
[57:23] okay
[57:24] we go through jericho we take a longer
[57:27] route
[57:28] for sure we're not stepping in samaria
[57:30] but jesus
[57:33] hallelujah
[57:35] chapter four verse four and he must
[57:37] needs go
[57:38] through samaria
[57:40] can you say amen
[57:42] can we see the grace of god
[57:45] maybe maybe the disciples ask
[57:48] can you repeat that master
[57:51] are we really sure
[57:53] we're going through samaria
[57:56] all the preachers before all the all the
[57:58] pharisees sinuses they were bypassing
[58:01] that all the big preachers
[58:03] but jesus was there
[58:04] in his son of man ministry
[58:07] praise the lord it was the special hour
[58:10] it was an hour of deliverance
[58:13] for those that were seed of god at that
[58:16] time
[58:17] praise the lord hallelujah he received
[58:20] the visa vision from his father amen
[58:23] that's why he had a need to go through
[58:25] samaria
[58:26] amen
[58:27] there was someone in that filthy land
[58:31] hallelujah forgotten
[58:34] her life was in ruins can you say man
[58:37] she had five husbands the one she was
[58:39] living with was not her husband amen
[58:42] she was ashamed
[58:45] her life was full of sin
[58:47] she didn't know how to straight that out
[58:49] but brothers and sisters i want to tell
[58:51] you god knows how to straighten it out
[58:56] amen we have our own conceptions people
[58:59] have their own judging amen but the word
[59:02] of god praise the lord you shall know
[59:05] the truth and the truth shall set you
[59:09] free
[59:10] amen
[59:12] praise the lord god knows how to do that
[59:15] praise the lord
[59:16] so he said let's go through samaria
[59:19] aren't you happy that he had a need to
[59:20] go through elkton virginia
[59:22] he had a need to go through czech
[59:24] republic to go through poland
[59:27] we were somewhere you were somewhere but
[59:30] god has found you because he knew you
[59:33] will be here he can never do a mistake
[59:37] this woman there
[59:38] so they go through samaria maybe the
[59:40] disciples they're looking you know to
[59:42] the left to the right
[59:44] what we're doing here in this country
[59:47] amen
[59:48] but jesus was going
[59:50] he knew there is a seed laying
[59:53] praise the lord he was god in flesh
[59:56] he was going there and he knew there is
[59:58] my seed
[1:00:00] she had an op she had a uh
[1:00:03] how do you call that she she had a
[1:00:05] certain testimony among the
[1:00:07] you know people
[1:00:10] because they looked on their fl on her
[1:00:12] flesh and they said my goodness you know
[1:00:14] the pharisees didn't want to do nothing
[1:00:16] with her pharisees didn't want it to do
[1:00:17] nothing with her but jesus
[1:00:20] oh glory
[1:00:22] aren't you happy for the grace of god
[1:00:25] you know when when the time of a
[1:00:27] capstone when the capstone is coming

[1:00:32] shoutings going on

[1:01:11] so people take you know time to to get
[1:01:13] the best selfie they can because that's
[1:01:16] the time we're living in amen
[1:01:19] the people are so selfish
[1:01:22] if there was a cat or someone else that
[1:01:25] marked the picture they said go away i
[1:01:27] want a selfie
[1:01:33] well
[1:01:35] there was one selfie
[1:01:38] that was the true one
[1:01:41] god took a picture of himself
[1:01:44] did you see the cloud
[1:01:47] that's the hour we're living in
[1:01:49] devil can only copy something
[1:01:52] but god has the original
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:57] god make a picture of him amen
[1:02:00] praise the lord we don't need our selfie
[1:02:03] because we are included in his selfie
[1:02:06] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:02:10] satan is only copying amen that's why
[1:02:13] there is a spirit upon the earth they're
[1:02:15] taking selfies but we have our first
[1:02:18] selfie

[1:02:23] little prophet met with the seven angels
[1:02:26] glory to god praise the lord
[1:02:29] aren't you happy for that
[1:02:31] that that's the time we're living in
[1:02:32] hallelujah
[1:02:34] jesus went there and you know there
[1:02:37] in samaria there was a mount gerizim
[1:02:40] and samaritans they had their own temple
[1:02:43] on the top of mount gerizim amen
[1:02:46] it was built about 30 years later than
[1:02:48] the temple in jerusalem and they said
[1:02:51] samaritans they said on that mountain
[1:02:54] that's our place of worship
[1:02:58] jews said no no no no
[1:03:00] my hour place of worship is on the
[1:03:02] mountain in jerusalem that's our true
[1:03:06] place of worship hallelujah
[1:03:09] but the time of transition came
[1:03:12] they were attaching the playoffs of
[1:03:14] worship with one
[1:03:16] geographical place
[1:03:18] but now the time came glory to god
[1:03:22] time of a change
[1:03:24] of a great church
[1:03:26] and jesus was introducing a new way of
[1:03:30] worship
[1:03:31] glory to god
[1:03:33] you know what amazes me
[1:03:35] it was not announced in some of the big
[1:03:38] churches or or
[1:03:39] or to a big pharisee or to caiaphas or
[1:03:43] oh i don't know
[1:03:44] the famous preachers of the day no
[1:03:48] the first one who heard about the change
[1:03:50] was a woman
[1:03:52] of a bad reputation
[1:03:54] oh glory to god can you say amen
[1:03:57] isn't our god wonderful
[1:04:00] those people would not even look at her
[1:04:02] email but jesus was there he met that
[1:04:05] woman at the well of jacob
[1:04:08] glory to god at the bottom of the mount
[1:04:11] of garrison
[1:04:13] she came to draw water from the whale at
[1:04:16] different times so that she will not
[1:04:18] meet other people because she was
[1:04:20] ashamed of her life
[1:04:22] she didn't know how to straight it out
[1:04:24] but god had a plan sometimes we don't
[1:04:26] know
[1:04:27] what how can i straight up my things god
[1:04:30] knows
[1:04:32] god knows
[1:04:33] maybe it's a sickness maybe it's
[1:04:35] something that is bothering you god
[1:04:37] knows
[1:04:38] praise the lord because we are
[1:04:40] overcomers we are his attributes that
[1:04:43] came into existence in this day
[1:04:46] praise the lord
[1:04:48] hallelujah

[1:05:07] one of the greatest changes
[1:05:10] that is right about to happen in that
[1:05:12] time
[1:05:13] glory to god
[1:05:15] here are these religious people of the
[1:05:17] day
[1:05:18] here is the woman of a bad reputation
[1:05:21] that god himself bailed in flesh
[1:05:24] comes through samaria
[1:05:26] brothers and sisters glory to god he
[1:05:29] came to redeem her back
[1:05:31] to reveal to her who she really is
[1:05:34] to reveal to her her origin and where
[1:05:36] she's going to
[1:05:39] praise the lord
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:42] so
[1:05:42] he sent the disciples they go to buy
[1:05:44] something and he's there alone
[1:05:47] because
[1:05:48] the new birth
[1:05:50] is the personal
[1:05:52] revelation of christ to you
[1:05:54] can you say amen
[1:05:56] your pastor cannot do that for you
[1:05:58] your parents cannot do that for you you
[1:06:01] must meet with the lord
[1:06:03] and when you do when he reveals himself
[1:06:05] to you you're a different person
[1:06:09] praise the lord for that
[1:06:11] so she comes there and she she comes to
[1:06:13] that to that
[1:06:15] well
[1:06:16] and and she looks at him and he looks at
[1:06:19] her
[1:06:20] that must have been a look brother
[1:06:25] she was maybe thinking
[1:06:28] what about my life
[1:06:29] it's a total mess
[1:06:32] she was
[1:06:33] heavy laden
[1:06:35] she was sad
[1:06:36] she didn't know who she is
[1:06:39] she was just stored up
[1:06:41] but there was the lord
[1:06:44] he looked at her down through that veil
[1:06:47] of darkness of unbelief
[1:06:50] there was a light inside of her
[1:06:54] can you say amen
[1:06:56] the seed of god
[1:06:58] and god saw it there
[1:07:00] the lord saw it in your heart
[1:07:03] wherever you were
[1:07:04] that's why the message came to redeem
[1:07:06] those that are the lords amen
[1:07:10] praise the lord
[1:07:12] hallelujah
[1:07:13] and he said give me a drink
[1:07:17] she looked at him
[1:07:19] she said you are a jew
[1:07:21] how come you ask me for water i am a
[1:07:23] samaritan woman we know
[1:07:25] that this church these believers from
[1:07:27] these believers they have nothing to do
[1:07:33] we never talk with those believers from
[1:07:35] that church
[1:07:37] jesus was there to introduce a new way
[1:07:39] of worship
[1:07:42] praise the lord
[1:07:44] amen give me a drink
[1:07:46] praise the lord
[1:07:48] and we know the conversation i don't
[1:07:50] want to go through it do that but you
[1:07:51] know jesus went right to the point amen
[1:07:55] that's what i love
[1:07:56] that's what i love about the truth
[1:07:59] it's not only the tapping on the back
[1:08:01] you know yeah everything is okay
[1:08:04] yeah jesus loves you
[1:08:06] you know that
[1:08:07] you know all the denominations they pray
[1:08:09] jesus loves you
[1:08:10] but there is a truth
[1:08:12] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:08:14] shall set you free do we want to be free
[1:08:17] hallelujah
[1:08:19] the truth shall set you free
[1:08:22] set your life in honor
[1:08:25] praise the lord gives you power to bring
[1:08:28] deliverance into your life
[1:08:30] that's what the truth shall do for you
[1:08:32] that's what the truth did for this woman
[1:08:36] because the truth was speaking to her
[1:08:39] glory to god you know and he was talking
[1:08:41] about you know if you knew about the
[1:08:43] water that i can give to you now she was
[1:08:45] thinking about a natural water
[1:08:47] she said might be good not to come no
[1:08:49] more to this well
[1:08:51] because she was coming you know to draw
[1:08:52] water to work but give me that water
[1:08:56] give me that water but now the words
[1:08:59] came
[1:09:04] you said
[1:09:05] go
[1:09:06] call thy husband and come to either
[1:09:12] jesus was not playing around he said
[1:09:14] right to the point you know what was
[1:09:15] there a problem too many husbands
[1:09:19] and the truth is the two-edged sword it
[1:09:22] comes right there to a problem to make
[1:09:25] an operation
[1:09:27] i'm just closing to make an operation
[1:09:30] praise the lord from the inside
[1:09:33] to cut away the unbelief
[1:09:35] sin and things of the world and give you
[1:09:37] a new life
[1:09:38] new desires amen
[1:09:41] praise the lord you know she was sincere
[1:09:44] she was standing in the presence of god
[1:09:46] she said i have no husband
[1:09:49] he said you said the truth
[1:09:51] you had five and the one that you are
[1:09:53] living with is your not your husband
[1:09:56] she had six
[1:09:57] but there was standing the seventh one
[1:10:00] can you say amen hallelujah she said my
[1:10:04] i perceive you are a prophet
[1:10:06] amen something was open up to her
[1:10:09] and he was talking more
[1:10:12] he said our father said we worship in
[1:10:14] that mountain the jews in jerusalem they
[1:10:17] said we worshipping that mountain in
[1:10:19] jerusalem
[1:10:20] but jesus said the hour cometh
[1:10:23] and it's now hallelujah
[1:10:25] that neither on that mountain neither
[1:10:27] dare but jesus was introducing a new way
[1:10:31] of worship
[1:10:32] hallelujah
[1:10:34] praise the lord not attached with the
[1:10:36] geographical place not attached with
[1:10:39] your certain conditions amen but you the
[1:10:43] true worshipers no matter where you are
[1:10:46] you can be in a garage
[1:10:48] you can be in a hospital you can wash
[1:10:50] the dishes sister praise the lord but
[1:10:53] god introduced to us a new way of
[1:10:56] worship in spirit
[1:10:59] and in the truth
[1:11:02] hallelujah
[1:11:04] aren't you happy for that
[1:11:09] you don't have to go to jerusalem to be
[1:11:12] in the place of worship you don't even
[1:11:14] have to go to jeffersonville to be in
[1:11:16] the place of worship hallelujah
[1:11:19] because you are the temple of the living
[1:11:21] god
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:24] you are the vessel where god
[1:11:26] wants to dwell
[1:11:28] praise the lord and you become a true
[1:11:30] worshiper
[1:11:35] in spirit
[1:11:36] and in the truth
[1:11:39] you know just last thing
[1:11:41] this woman had so many problems in her
[1:11:43] life
[1:11:44] is that the truth
[1:11:45] she didn't know how to make it right
[1:11:48] maybe she went to this psychologist to
[1:11:50] that psychologist they when they heard
[1:11:52] her story they said man
[1:11:55] we're sorry we can't help you
[1:11:57] we don't know how to straight up this
[1:11:58] mess
[1:11:59] but when jesus started to talk to her
[1:12:04] something started to happen with her
[1:12:07] was afraid to talk to anybody she was
[1:12:10] afraid to meet the people but after she
[1:12:12] talked with jesus
[1:12:14] she was not afraid to go back to the
[1:12:16] city and said oh come and see
[1:12:20] not me not my life but a man that told
[1:12:24] me all about my life
[1:12:27] it must be the messiah
[1:12:29] can you say well
[1:12:31] brother and sisters the message of this
[1:12:33] hour that's messiah of our day can you
[1:12:36] say man

[1:21:20] this you had a long day and you came
[1:21:23] here anyhow to listen to the word of god
[1:21:26] it is encouraging me
[1:21:29] so brother and sister is great battle we
[1:21:32] are going through
[1:21:33] but we are not alone
[1:21:35] our bridegroom is with us
[1:21:38] and he is more than able to do
[1:21:42] everything what we need
[1:21:44] amen because he already he has done it
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:49] so okay i want to ask you to stand up
[1:21:53] and to open our bibles
[1:21:57] in the very familiar scripture
[1:22:01] it is written thank you brother andrew
[1:22:03] it is written in the
[1:22:05] first
[1:22:07] verse of 17th chapter of first kings
[1:22:12] so first book of kings
[1:22:15] and 17th chapter and first versed
[1:22:20] and elijah the tishbite
[1:22:22] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[1:22:26] said unto ahab
[1:22:28] as the lord god of israel liveth
[1:22:32] before whom i stand
[1:22:35] there shall not be due
[1:22:38] nor rain these years
[1:22:40] but according to my word amen can you
[1:22:44] say amen
[1:22:46] praise the lord you may be seated
[1:22:49] so you know we have
[1:22:51] there in my local church we have on
[1:22:54] pulpit
[1:22:55] notebook
[1:22:57] and we
[1:22:58] write
[1:23:00] down in this notebook special needs of
[1:23:03] the bride of jesus christ and i want to
[1:23:06] let you know and brother ron especially
[1:23:09] you
[1:23:10] that i could write down your name and
[1:23:14] the need
[1:23:15] of total healing for brother on spencer
[1:23:19] and we believe
[1:23:20] that god is more than able to do it
[1:23:24] because we are his children and we are
[1:23:26] believers and god is more than able to
[1:23:30] do it and he will
[1:23:32] do we believe he will
[1:23:34] praise the lord
[1:23:36] so brothers and sisters and this is very
[1:23:39] very familiar scripture
[1:23:41] but
[1:23:42] before this scripture is written the
[1:23:45] last
[1:23:46] last verse of 16
[1:23:49] chapter
[1:23:50] of first kings amen
[1:23:53] and in this 16th chapter is written
[1:23:57] in these days did he
[1:23:59] hear
[1:24:00] the battleite built jericho
[1:24:03] he laid the foundation thereof in abiram
[1:24:07] his first firstborn and set up the gates
[1:24:10] thereof in his youngest
[1:24:12] son segup
[1:24:14] according to the word of the lord
[1:24:18] which he spake by joshua the son of noon
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] so we see
[1:24:24] that the the time came maybe that was
[1:24:27] after 500 years
[1:24:30] since time when god said by joshua
[1:24:34] he said against jericho he cursed
[1:24:38] jericho
[1:24:39] and we see
[1:24:40] that what was cursed was rebuilt again
[1:24:44] amen and we can see the same right now
[1:24:48] out of this world outside that was was
[1:24:52] cursed the sin is rebuilt again
[1:24:56] and in the same time amen according to
[1:24:59] the word of god
[1:25:01] in the same time that was a man from
[1:25:04] gilead and that was elijah and he came
[1:25:08] to ahab amen
[1:25:11] so that was special time
[1:25:13] because we can see darkness outside but
[1:25:17] we have to see light inside amen praise
[1:25:21] the lord we cannot be focused only on
[1:25:25] the dark side
[1:25:26] we have to be focused on the light
[1:25:28] lightheart light side which is in us
[1:25:31] praise the lord somebody say amen
[1:25:34] hallelujah so brothers and sisters so
[1:25:37] the the biggest problem in that time for
[1:25:41] israel
[1:25:42] was king ahab
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:45] he was the biggest problem for them
[1:25:49] but elijah
[1:25:51] because before this chapter we cannot
[1:25:55] read something about elijah
[1:25:58] maybe in that time elijah was in his
[1:26:01] house
[1:26:02] listening to the tapes
[1:26:04] to recognize his position
[1:26:07] but when the prophecy was fulfilled
[1:26:10] hallelujah as prophecy is fulfilled in
[1:26:12] our days
[1:26:14] the king's purple and this lady
[1:26:17] everything is fulfilled
[1:26:19] so this is time for you and me to
[1:26:22] recognize our position
[1:26:24] just to go out
[1:26:26] to stay before your greatest biggest
[1:26:29] problem
[1:26:30] and to be like elijah
[1:26:32] and what he said to ahab
[1:26:35] he didn't mention ahab name
[1:26:38] he didn't say
[1:26:40] anything about ahab
[1:26:42] but he said
[1:26:44] as
[1:26:45] the lord god of israel
[1:26:51] leave it
[1:26:52] before
[1:26:54] whom i stand
[1:26:57] it is your testimony tonight
[1:27:00] you can come brother on you can come to
[1:27:03] your greatest greatest problem greatest
[1:27:06] enemy the biggest problem to the cancer
[1:27:09] or to illness some what is
[1:27:12] what is what it is and you can say
[1:27:15] before
[1:27:16] because i am standing before the lord
[1:27:21] be because i am standing not before you
[1:27:26] my problem
[1:27:28] but because i am standing before the
[1:27:31] lord of god
[1:27:33] praise the lord
[1:27:34] and he said praise the lord i like it
[1:27:38] there shall not be due no rain
[1:27:41] these years
[1:27:43] but according to my word
[1:27:46] praise the lord we are stepping in the
[1:27:49] time of spoken word
[1:27:51] not only of the spoken word by william
[1:27:54] branham but spoken word by the bride of
[1:27:57] jesus christ in 2021 in 2022 somebody
[1:28:02] say hallelujah
[1:28:05] in the message of things prophet said
[1:28:07] god hates a powerless religion
[1:28:11] can you imagine god but he is love yes
[1:28:16] but he hates a powerless religion
[1:28:21] and any religion today
[1:28:23] that hasn't got christ in it is
[1:28:26] powerless
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:29] any religion
[1:28:31] if we will have just religion in our
[1:28:34] churches
[1:28:35] we will be without power
[1:28:38] but we need christ and christ it is very
[1:28:41] life of jesus and his life is here
[1:28:44] tonight i believe it somebody say
[1:28:47] hallelujah
[1:28:48] somebody say i believe it
[1:28:50] praise the lord and prophet said
[1:28:53] but any religion that christ in is under
[1:28:57] his own blood
[1:28:59] and it's got power in it
[1:29:01] god hates powerless religion
[1:29:04] it's got to have power in it
[1:29:07] it's got to have sincerity
[1:29:10] are you with me
[1:29:12] if god to have sincerity
[1:29:14] sincerity brings power
[1:29:17] sincerity brings power
[1:29:20] we have to be more and more sincere
[1:29:22] the angel of the lord came to prophet
[1:29:25] william branham and he said you have to
[1:29:28] be
[1:29:29] more and more sincere
[1:29:31] and it is the same for us
[1:29:34] maybe we are for 48 years or maybe 30
[1:29:38] years 20 years in the message
[1:29:41] but we have to be more and more sincere
[1:29:44] with every day
[1:29:45] to say
[1:29:47] father
[1:29:49] i failed
[1:29:51] i was wrong
[1:29:53] forgive me
[1:29:55] and he will forgive you
[1:29:57] and he will give you power
[1:29:59] to rule over this sin in your life to
[1:30:02] rule over this problem in your life are
[1:30:04] you with me hallelujah and prophet said
[1:30:07] sincerity brings real worship
[1:30:10] as we could as as we could hear about
[1:30:13] the real worshipers true worshipers amen
[1:30:16] so prophet said sincerity brings the
[1:30:19] real worship not forms but genuine power
[1:30:23] worship to know that you've passed from
[1:30:26] death and to life somebody say
[1:30:29] hallelujah
[1:30:30] the real worship is not just okay father
[1:30:33] i am here but real worship is to know
[1:30:37] that you came from the dead to life to
[1:30:41] very life of jesus christ and now you
[1:30:43] can be true worshipper praise the lord
[1:30:46] hallelujah
[1:30:48] and prophet said and when the church
[1:30:50] denies his power
[1:30:52] how can he perform and vindicate his
[1:30:55] word
[1:30:56] here is what's happened
[1:30:59] god wants to perform by the holy ghost
[1:31:02] and vindicate his word
[1:31:04] and the church wants to perform
[1:31:08] amen so one hand side god he wants to
[1:31:11] perform
[1:31:13] if you want just to wait on him
[1:31:16] he will see his answer
[1:31:19] because his answer is on the way
[1:31:23] so you can stand before your problem
[1:31:26] as
[1:31:27] as
[1:31:28] as elijah as he did and he stood before
[1:31:32] he stand before ahab and he said as the
[1:31:36] lord leave it
[1:31:38] as the lord leave it
[1:31:40] before whom i stand
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:45] praise the lord
[1:31:47] so john gospel of john
[1:31:50] 8 and 31
[1:31:54] then said jesus to those jews
[1:31:57] which believed on him
[1:31:59] if ye continue in my word
[1:32:03] then are you my disciples indeed
[1:32:06] hallelujah
[1:32:08] so he said to jews which believed
[1:32:12] not to jews there on the streets in
[1:32:15] jerusalem or in galilee
[1:32:17] but he said to jews which believed
[1:32:21] in him
[1:32:23] and but he said if you
[1:32:25] will remain
[1:32:28] in my world
[1:32:30] hallelujah it is what is needed for us
[1:32:33] to remain in the every promise of god
[1:32:37] he promised to heal you brother ron and
[1:32:40] you have just to remain and you will see
[1:32:43] the whole victory in your life
[1:32:46] and i will see the whole victory in my
[1:32:49] life
[1:32:50] i will see all my kids saved because
[1:32:53] they are
[1:32:54] already saved
[1:32:56] amen we have promise
[1:32:58] we have something what is real
[1:33:01] it is not like you know something unreal
[1:33:05] just today is
[1:33:07] people they want to have cryptocurrency
[1:33:10] something what is unreal
[1:33:13] it's not real
[1:33:15] it's just like something any code today
[1:33:18] it is tomorrow will will be no no more
[1:33:22] but we have something real we have true
[1:33:26] gold true character of jesus christ
[1:33:29] hallelujah we can touch it we can take
[1:33:33] it
[1:33:34] praise the lord
[1:33:36] so he said if you continue in my word
[1:33:40] then are you my disciples indeed
[1:33:43] and it is not finished
[1:33:45] but he's at end
[1:33:47] and praise the lord you shall know the
[1:33:51] truth
[1:33:52] and the truth shall make you free
[1:33:56] praise the lord
[1:33:58] so we have to be to remain in his word
[1:34:02] in the message for this hour
[1:34:05] and we will be his disciples indeed
[1:34:09] and then
[1:34:10] next step
[1:34:12] we will know not maybe he said
[1:34:15] not probably but he said and you shall
[1:34:18] know praise the lord and you shall know
[1:34:21] the truth
[1:34:23] and if you shall know the truth
[1:34:26] the truth hallelujah not you
[1:34:29] not your pastor
[1:34:31] not brother and you not brother robert
[1:34:34] but the truth hallelujah shall make you
[1:34:37] free
[1:34:38] so christ he is here tonight
[1:34:41] to make you free
[1:34:44] to make me free from my sickness from my
[1:34:48] sins for everything what is wrong with
[1:34:51] me
[1:34:52] hallelujah
[1:34:53] and the next position of the seven
[1:34:55] church ages prophet said now remember
[1:34:58] this
[1:34:58] and this very very familiar quote
[1:35:02] christ in the true church is a
[1:35:05] continuation of the book of acts praise
[1:35:07] the lord
[1:35:08] he didn't say jesus but he said christ
[1:35:12] in true church amen
[1:35:14] christ it is very life of jesus right
[1:35:18] now is in his true church praise the
[1:35:21] lord we are his true church only his
[1:35:24] bride is his true church pray the lord
[1:35:28] and he said
[1:35:30] if they get the true revelation i just
[1:35:32] keep if they get the true revelation of
[1:35:35] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:35:38] the christian church and by god's spirit
[1:35:41] discern at withstand the antichrist
[1:35:44] spirit satan will be powerless before
[1:35:47] her praise the lord we didn't receive a
[1:35:51] powerless religion we receive the
[1:35:54] religion something more than religion we
[1:35:57] receive the life of jesus christ with
[1:36:00] his full of power
[1:36:02] power hallelujah praise the lord
[1:36:05] and he said yes satan hates revelation
[1:36:08] but we love it with true revelation in
[1:36:12] our lives the gates of hell cannot
[1:36:15] prevail against us
[1:36:18] but we will prevail over them
[1:36:20] are you with me
[1:36:23] i want to tell you my personal testimony
[1:36:26] can i do it can i do it
[1:36:29] so i have three keys as i mentioned my
[1:36:30] daughter she is the oldest one and when
[1:36:34] when she was 13 years old she decided to
[1:36:37] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:36:40] and she was baptized by the grace of the
[1:36:42] lord and then i had second i have two
[1:36:45] sons thomas he is right now
[1:36:49] 22 years old and the jonah he's
[1:36:53] 19 years old
[1:36:55] so then thomas when he was just maybe
[1:36:59] 8 10
[1:37:01] even 12 years old
[1:37:03] he was so good boy he was so interested
[1:37:08] in the message in the word of god he
[1:37:10] loved to sing songs for the glory of god
[1:37:14] he loved to pray with us he loved to
[1:37:17] sing with us you know to read bible with
[1:37:20] us
[1:37:21] but when he started to be like 15 years
[1:37:24] old something wrong happened
[1:37:27] i didn't know
[1:37:29] but i saw that something wrong is with
[1:37:32] him he still sang with us he still went
[1:37:36] with us to church he prayed with us
[1:37:40] but something wrong was in his spirit
[1:37:45] and i as a father i could feel it
[1:37:48] so i said thomas what wrong is with you
[1:37:53] and he was
[1:37:54] 15 maybe in that time he was 16 years
[1:37:56] old
[1:37:57] and he was in his high school and he
[1:37:59] said nothing daddy
[1:38:01] i am good i said no and he said yes i
[1:38:05] have planned to go to university to for
[1:38:08] studying i said it is not my question
[1:38:11] i am thinking about your soul tell me
[1:38:14] what wrong is with you
[1:38:17] and he said okay daddy
[1:38:19] i will tell you the truth
[1:38:22] i don't want to be
[1:38:25] like you
[1:38:26] i want to be normal
[1:38:29] i said what
[1:38:32] do you try to tell me that i am abnormal
[1:38:36] and he said no daddy but i want to be
[1:38:39] like my friends in school
[1:38:42] i said okay son
[1:38:44] but you are not like them
[1:38:47] you are son of god
[1:38:50] so
[1:38:51] it it happened in this way
[1:38:54] and that was in the same condition i
[1:38:57] prayed my wife prayed we cried before
[1:39:01] the lord
[1:39:02] and brother john andes do you know
[1:39:04] brother jonathan is from clover dale
[1:39:06] he came for convention in poland
[1:39:09] and he said okay this meeting
[1:39:12] i i feel i feel something on my heart
[1:39:15] to make a prayer line
[1:39:18] so i want to ask every pastor at every
[1:39:20] end
[1:39:22] and every preacher
[1:39:24] to go
[1:39:25] to go out that was
[1:39:27] in at the end of the service to go out
[1:39:30] to the front
[1:39:31] and to form two lines
[1:39:34] so there was once one line
[1:39:36] one brother stayed here
[1:39:38] and another stood here
[1:39:40] and he said okay so people
[1:39:43] just if you have any need you can come
[1:39:46] this way from the left and go through
[1:39:48] the line prayer line brothers will just
[1:39:51] put hands on you and you will go through
[1:39:56] so
[1:39:57] maybe two
[1:39:58] maybe
[1:39:59] 250 250 people went through this prayer
[1:40:03] line
[1:40:04] i was there
[1:40:06] but you know i am i am a father
[1:40:09] i taught about my sons especially
[1:40:11] i taught about thomas because he was a
[1:40:13] teenager and in that time
[1:40:16] and you that was very very dangerous you
[1:40:18] know
[1:40:19] so the last person went through
[1:40:23] and there was no thomas
[1:40:25] but holy spirit fell down
[1:40:28] and we started to praise to worship god
[1:40:32] i was there in the front and i i i
[1:40:35] raised my hands and i started to pray
[1:40:38] and i started to feel holy ghost
[1:40:41] atmosphere as real as i can see you
[1:40:45] tonight
[1:40:47] and i said
[1:40:49] that was i'm sincere with you i'm honest
[1:40:52] that was
[1:40:54] what i said
[1:40:56] lord jesus
[1:40:58] i want to bring
[1:41:00] into your hands my two
[1:41:03] unsaved sons
[1:41:05] thomas and jonas
[1:41:08] and the same moment
[1:41:10] i just said those words
[1:41:13] holy spirit
[1:41:15] came to me to correct me and he said
[1:41:19] that was so real brothers and sisters i
[1:41:22] am saying here here is the bible
[1:41:25] and he was so real and he said you are
[1:41:28] my son
[1:41:29] you are preacher
[1:41:31] you know the message and every promise
[1:41:34] how you can express how you can confess
[1:41:38] that your sons are unsafe
[1:41:41] and i said
[1:41:43] father
[1:41:44] forgive me forgive me i want to thank
[1:41:46] you
[1:41:47] for my saved sons thomas and jonas
[1:41:51] and the very moment i said the last word
[1:41:55] i just i just heard any noise
[1:41:59] and i saw that the lie the prayer line
[1:42:02] is formed again
[1:42:04] and that was just two person
[1:42:07] going through that was my son thomas
[1:42:11] and in that time his bride and now his
[1:42:13] wife damaris
[1:42:15] they went through the prayer line
[1:42:21] and i said thank you father
[1:42:23] thank you father you are so real we
[1:42:25] didn't receive powerless religion we
[1:42:28] received something
[1:42:30] something real
[1:42:32] full of power
[1:42:34] after a few months he came to my office
[1:42:36] and he said daddy
[1:42:38] i want to give my life to the lord jesus
[1:42:41] christ
[1:42:42] can you baptize me in the name of jesus
[1:42:45] christ
[1:42:46] i said son
[1:42:48] it will be my greatest honor
[1:42:51] my greatest privilege
[1:42:53] so
[1:42:54] i could baptize him in the name of jesus
[1:42:57] christ and now he is one of preachers in
[1:43:02] my in my church
[1:43:04] brothers sisters
[1:43:13] this is what we received
[1:43:16] what we got
[1:43:18] praise the lord
[1:43:20] if it was for me it is the same for you
[1:43:23] and for you
[1:43:25] maybe you pray for your children maybe
[1:43:27] for for your brother or sister or
[1:43:29] parents
[1:43:30] god is the same
[1:43:33] and he is still on time
[1:43:35] he will never come too late he will be
[1:43:38] on all the time on time
[1:43:41] always amen
[1:43:43] so so satan hates revelation but we love
[1:43:47] it
[1:43:48] we true revelation in our lives the
[1:43:50] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:43:53] but we will prevail over them amen and
[1:43:57] now prophet said
[1:43:59] in the message calling jesus on the
[1:44:00] scene he said and that hybriding has got
[1:44:04] into the church too
[1:44:06] instead of having a real rugged bunch of
[1:44:09] bible believers
[1:44:11] they've hybrid it by denominations
[1:44:14] and they have two
[1:44:16] i got this i got that and i belong to
[1:44:20] this and i belong to that it is hybrid
[1:44:23] and the thing cannot produce itself
[1:44:26] again
[1:44:27] we need a book of acts again
[1:44:30] amen
[1:44:32] we need a book of acts again but the
[1:44:34] only way
[1:44:36] listen closely only way
[1:44:39] you will do it is god back to the bible
[1:44:43] and away from some of this hybrid
[1:44:46] religion amen so we are going to the
[1:44:50] bible again
[1:44:52] so just the last last example the book
[1:44:55] of acts
[1:44:56] 12th chapter
[1:45:00] and from the beginning from the first
[1:45:03] verse now about that time
[1:45:06] herod the king stretched forth his hands
[1:45:09] to break certain of the church
[1:45:12] and he killed james the brother of john
[1:45:16] with the sword
[1:45:18] and because he saw
[1:45:20] it pleased the jews
[1:45:23] he proceeded further to take peter also
[1:45:27] amen so we see that that was attitude
[1:45:32] amongst jews
[1:45:33] and herod he saw
[1:45:36] that if he will do this
[1:45:39] this or it will play please jews and we
[1:45:43] see that they try to give wrong kind of
[1:45:47] attitude
[1:45:49] amongst people
[1:45:51] can you notice that everything about
[1:45:54] covet lockdowns and vaccinations is to
[1:45:58] divide people
[1:46:00] is to divide people
[1:46:02] there is one professor of oxford
[1:46:05] university
[1:46:06] and his friend they are in the same
[1:46:09] office they are very good friends they
[1:46:12] have the same titles and one day
[1:46:15] one of them he say he's saying okay the
[1:46:19] vaccination is very good it's for your
[1:46:21] health just
[1:46:23] go and take the shots and next week his
[1:46:27] friend from the same office
[1:46:31] he's staying
[1:46:32] and he he's saying no vaccination is
[1:46:36] very bad
[1:46:38] it against your health is to kill you
[1:46:40] don't do it
[1:46:42] so tell me why
[1:46:44] to give
[1:46:46] to give people attitude
[1:46:49] of uncertainty
[1:46:51] there is nothing certain here on desert
[1:46:55] only what is certain
[1:46:57] solid ground is the word of god brothers
[1:47:00] and sisters
[1:47:01] so if you will make your decision
[1:47:04] to take vaccination or not you have the
[1:47:07] bible you have the message and you have
[1:47:10] your niece
[1:47:12] and you have to pray
[1:47:15] but don't don't take your decision don't
[1:47:18] don't make your decision according to
[1:47:21] the youtube or internet
[1:47:23] just according to the message
[1:47:26] to the bible
[1:47:27] amen
[1:47:29] praise the lord
[1:47:31] hallelujah
[1:47:33] so we see peter in this story
[1:47:36] very familiar story
[1:47:40] then were the days on unleavened bread
[1:47:43] and when he had apprehended him he put
[1:47:46] him in prison
[1:47:48] and delivered him to four quaternions of
[1:47:51] soldiers to keep him
[1:47:53] intending after easter to bring him
[1:47:56] forth to the people
[1:47:59] if you say about problems and troubles
[1:48:03] and tests
[1:48:05] just ask peter
[1:48:07] how he felt in that time that was full
[1:48:10] lockdown for him
[1:48:13] in the prison
[1:48:14] for quaternions of soldiers everywhere
[1:48:18] and he were inside there
[1:48:20] but praise the lord we have another
[1:48:23] verse
[1:48:24] verse 5
[1:48:25] peter therefore was kept in prison but
[1:48:29] prayer was made with without ceasing of
[1:48:32] the church unto god for him praise the
[1:48:35] lord
[1:48:36] praise the lord hallelujah god knew
[1:48:40] that peter
[1:48:41] will need help of his brothers and
