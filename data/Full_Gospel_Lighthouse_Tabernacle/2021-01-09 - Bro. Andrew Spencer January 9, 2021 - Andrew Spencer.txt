weren't faithful he was always faithful when you weren't there he was always there let's go to him in prayer tonight father we love you so much lord what a privilege it is for us to be able to access you by the way of prayer father lord we realize the power of prayer how it changes situations it changes our outlook on life we are told that when we come out on the other side of prayer we ought to be able to look and everybody look clean father and father we realize that that yes the world is a filthy place but yet we can come out on the other side of prayer and we can see your glory and we can see your your magnitude and your magnificence father in our life and every person around us lord i pray father that tonight as you would take us through your word and come us comb through the word the pages of the word tonight that that you would let us come through the other side lord seeing everything that you have in store for us this is not a time to tremble this is not a time to wonder who's in control this is time to look up this is the greatest time that the bride has ever been living in it's the time of the rapture it's a time of a going home and lord our eyes are not upon the things of the world but our eyes are upon you lord we cannot get distracted when our gaze is in view of you father and we pray tonight as we would take back lord and look at the things that you have put in front of us lord i pray that you would just move us into the realm of the supernatural father we are reminded lord jesus that you're the same yesterday today and forever what happened here last weekend can happen here again lord what happened and what moved us in a mighty way can move us again father the healer that passed through here can pass through here again i pray tonight that we as your children as we were gather around this revealed word of the hour i pray that you would speak to us live to hear father lord i pray you bless every person here i pray you bless every person that isn't here that's listening to this service or will archive the service father i pray the blessings of the lord would envelope your children tonight we didn't come out here to be seen a man we didn't come out here father for for our social standing we came out here to be in the presence of jehovah and i don't believe that jehovah is going to leave here depressed on how his children look on him but i believe jehovah will leave this place knowing that his children are in the place that he has positioned them to be father if you're not going to leave here to press why should we leave here to press where we are i pray that you would take us further into your word take us deeper into the things of god like never before and we pray these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen oh what a mighty god if you have your bibles this evening we'll turn over in the book of exodus chapter 14 and verse 13. it's good to be back in the house of the lord what a blessed people we are this evening amen exodus chapter 14 and verse 13. thankful to have all our visitors here this evening pray god blesses you ministers to your heart tonight amen exodus chapter 14 and verse 13. and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever what powerful reading that the enemy that you see today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide divided and the children of israel shall go up on dry ground through the midst of the sea god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord and the lord said unto moses verse 15 wherefore christ thou unto me speaking to the children of israel that they go forward speak that they go forward we certainly are looking at some very unprecedented times as a as a people and as a nation and certainly as a children of god we are being pressed like never before to to upkeep the standards of faith and to upkeep the standards of our religion that we believe that jesus christ is the son of the living god and we are oppressed on every side but we are not in despair we are we have been through we've been through the water and we have been through fires but yet we come out standing on the other side because we know that the god of the bible is the god that fights our battles and we as we see here as we're looking on the other side of exodus exodus 14 we look and we can comb through the pages of the bible all the way from exodus 3 and we can see as god is placing his deliverer as he's sending him down with a message and then we can see him as he goes through the chaos of dealing with pharaoh and and dealing with dealing with these things and and realizing that moses is here in a ministry in a very powerful supernatural ministry that he's not witnessed before but yet that power is behind him and yet as moses steps into the role of the deliverer and the prophet of the day he steps into the midst of the greatest chaos that was getting ready to take place when when egypt ruled the world as it were in that time it was a midst of chaos that was getting ready to transpire as you watch as all of the plagues come upon egypt and as you watch as the power of god would come through moses as moses would speak these things and they would come into existence and you would watch as as egypt begin to put pressure upon the children of israel and you watch as these people that have been promised to deliver for for over 400 years as they see these promises as they're as they're coming into fruition and you see a people that they start recognizing that they are the people that were built for an exodus and that these were the people that would hear this message that would that would take them out of this chaos and here we are some 5 000 years from that same time and here we are living in a time of the third exodus in the midst of chaos and in the midst of a world that's falling apart and everybody's calling for unity and everybody's pressing and they always see the pope as he's calling for a world council of churches and calling for unity and and you see as the as the world will turn their gaze upon the beast that they that roam that power and you see as she begins to call for the unity of people to come together but there has been another people that have already been united with their headship they have been united with their groom and it is now that it is in the time of trouble that he will lift his people off of the earth and it was in the midst of chaos that an exodus took place and it's in the midst of a chaos of this world that the king of peace comes and grabs his children out of a place where satan is the king of chaos and he grabs them from this world and you see there is no other people like it sitting on the face of the earth like you are people are calling for answers they're calling out they've got questions but there is a message that has the answer to everything that has been put in front of us and matter of fact you are the answer to the devil's question in this hour this is not a time to go backwards this is not a time to look back but this is a time to move forward in the promises of god and i promise you if you'll move forward in the word of god that the holy ghost will move you forward in his power and why god speak he would sit now with and now if any time looking at exodus chapter 14 that we've just read he said if any time that it ever looked like they ought to retreat it was then but god has no retreat there's no place to retreat in god it's go forward the doctor says cancer go forward if he says tb go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back it's go forward speak and go forward speak what his word and go forward thus save the lord and move on and cry out cry out so that people will know when you look at the bible and you see jesus after his baptism and the holy ghost comes and condescends upon and he on him as a form of a dove and john screams out behold the lamb of god immediately jesus goes from this spot where where god is identifying that this is his son that this is the one that will take away the sins of the world immediately he goes upon the mountain for 40 days and he's tempted by satan and satan comes to him with snares and traps and he's trying to control him in the spot where he's trying to push him into a spot and trap him into proving that he's the son of god but you watch what jesus did he never stayed in the enemy's trap he simply allowed the word to move him forward out of the trap of the enemy and that's what you must do as a children of god is you must allow the word of god to get you out of the trap it's not you that gets yourself out of there it's not you that gets yourself out of depression it's not you that gets yourself out of trouble it's not you that gets yourself out of situations that you got yourself in it's the word that will get you out of it and the word will get you out of it every single time brother burnham said that just simply repenting gets you out of the devil's trap that's why satan hates the power of prayer is when you go to praying that everything that has been done on your life goes back on the head of satan and he's responsible for the sin that you committed but he's responsible to take it back down to hell where you were meant to go you see there's no retreat there's no staying on the same ground he said let's move with the spirit or the spirit will move on to somebody else and leave you standing there is no neutral zone you either have the holy ghost or you don't have the holy ghost you're either a christian or you're not a christian now turn with me over to ezekiel chapter 1 and verse 4. a little lengthy scripture reading here but just bear with us ezekiel chapter one and verse four and i looked and and beheld behold a whirlwind came out of the north and a great cloud and a fire unfolding itself and a brightness was about it out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire we've seen that same fire in this building we're a witness at that same pillar of fire is even here tonight actually if you're a born again son and daughter of god he's in your heart you brought him here tonight he was he does not fill this house but he fills your heart and out of the midst thereof was a color of an amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of all four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and every one had four wings and their feet were straight feet in the and the sole of their feet was like the soles of a cast foot and they sparkled like the color of a burnished brass and they had hands of a man under the wings on their four sides and and they had four had their faces and their wings their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went everyone straight forward as for the likeness of their faces they had four have the face of a man the face of a lion on the right side and the four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle thus were the faces and their wings were straight stretched up where two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies verse 12 and they went everyone straight forward whether the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went now we know that these are the anointings of the lord that that god would use and that god you can see them through several places throughout the bible but we realize that these are the anointings of the lord we watch as he would use the anointing of matthew in a lion we use it we watch it as he would use the anointing throughout the church ages of an ox and a man and even in this day of a flying eagle and we realize and we look at this scripture and you see that the anointing of the lord always goes forward you see they couldn't turn that anointing or or that time that anointing during that time could not turn it couldn't go this way it had to go the way that it was facing where it was facing there it had to go and where the spirit went that's where it had to go and we realized that those same anointings were guarding those same anointings were in matthew mark luke and john and what were they doing they were guarding the book of acts they were guarding the holy ghost and just like when you look at matthew chapter 28 and 19 there it is that anointing is guarding the true baptism of the holy ghost of acts 2 and 38. that's why the church world can't grab ahold of it is because you see they are under that anoint they are guarded by that anointing where they're not allowed to walk but you are a people that have been led by an anointing to catch the revelation of the hour you see that anointing will never let you go back the anointing will never let you go back but the anointing will allow you to look back into the scriptures and see what jesus said and the anointing unveils it and it becomes a revelation to you you see they read the same scriptures that you read but they read it and they're completely blind you see if this gospel is heard it is here to them that are blind but here you are read the same scriptures that they read but because of the anointing and because the revelation that pushes you forward you cannot go back you cannot go back to ad238 and catch that denominate the denominational idea of water baptism but the anointing allows you to catch the revelation of the hour but notice this that anointing will never allow you to go back but it always move you forward just like the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost that same power will always move you into his promises that if he's still hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he must do the same thing that he did then if he healed then he's got to heal now if he's saved then he's got to save now if he delivered then he's got to deliver now if he failed then he's got to feel now as jesus said when he was speaking with nicodemus here on the new to the new birth doctrine his very first doctrine he begins to speak to him and he tells him in verse 8 that the wind bloweth where it listeth and now hears the sound thereof but you can't tell where it come from and whether it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit you realize that you are a paradox to satan himself he don't know how that power got on the inside of you he don't understand how the power that he wanted in heaven is now sitting in a body living in 16 elements he don't understand where that power came from and how that power got in there hallelujah but because of the new birth you're just like the wind you can hear it but you can't see where it came from but the people that have been born again know exactly where it came from and they know exactly where it's taken them hallelujah you're going through laodicea but you're coming out of laodicea hallelujah you remember when the prophet was up there in canada and he was driving through that big burnover up there and he was driving down through there and he said it had been a big burn over and those those great big stately pines up there prayer as the wind would dry when as the wind would blow through those pines you could hear it because they had been through the trials of life and all the all the fires of life it had burned the life out of them and when that wind would go across him those trees would moan and groan under the power of that wind he said it would remind me of churches when you go to preaching about the baptism of the holy ghost they say that's nonsense it's for days gone by he said it remind me he said because you see the trials of life had burnt it had burnt the very life out of it and those those churches were always pointing back they're always pointing back to reform or pouring back to wesley pointing back to luther pointing back to their days brother branham would say that the church is living off of their past reputation but the bride is not living off a past reputation of acts chapter 2. she's living off of the word right now he said when i looked out there and i seen those pines that had been burnt over that was frolicking that was standing there and moaning he said i looked down low and there was some underbrush that was coming up he said there was some new life that was coming up and they were praising god for the wind that was going across them there's a lot of people that get excited and get all shook up because the power of the holy ghost coming but there's a people on earth today that still love a good gospel sermon they still love a good gospel word pouring out of the spirit they still enjoy when god comes down afresh hallelujah you see what satan is trying to do is that satan is trying to keep you from getting to the book of acts because if you get to the book of acts he knows that if you grab ahold of that book of acts that you will be exactly what he said that you will be exactly what the prophet said that you'll be an invincible army you'll to be be you'll be too powerful to be defeated that you'll be able to do the greater works satan has tried all his life trying to keep you from the book of acts but i found out a long time ago that satan is not the maker of my destiny but jesus christ is the one that predetermined me satan cannot check make god and put him in a corner but there is a power that pushes back against satan you see if satan could destroy the purpose of god he would be known as satan the almighty but the almighty was the one that created satan and satan is doing his best to try to keep you from the book of acts i got bad news i got bad news for the devil we are not just under an acts 2 anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost but we stand here in this hour under the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost of acts 2 but we also stand here under the anointing of the revelations 10 the mighty angel that has charged us to take this book has charged us to eat this book charge just become this book and the bible said that by one spirit we are baptized into one body how did you get in that body by one spirit hallelujah there's some people don't understand the spirit of god but i'm telling you tonight he's alive he's here and he's moving and the mighty angel is moving you he's moving a people into the perfection of the word so what power are you under you're either under your own power either under denominate power a demon power or you're under a church power now the church power only gets you to let you get so high your own self will only let you get so high but when god comes and fills you with his power he gives you his mind and there's nothing higher than god what power are you under this word that has been delivered in this day it will re it will produce a body that is fit for the headship of christ that the son of man could identify that's my body i'm speaking through that body and when moses would stand there and god would say why are you crying to me speak and go forward the son of man can look at his body and he said don't sit there don't sit there all shook up just simply speak you've got the word in your mouth the bible said the word is now the even in thy mouth and you notice what satan is trying to do in this day he's trying to silence the mouth of every born-again son and daughter of god i'm not just talking about your mouth i'm not just talking about your facebook i'm not just talking about your social agenda but i'm talking about you speaking the word he's trying to put every filter of doubt in your life to make you question everything that's been said but there is a spirit of truth that will guide you he is the author of all wisdom and he will guide you through all things he would say there's an hour coming when this world will shake under the impact of the church of the living god that's moving forward in great power the power that's moving you the power that's moving you is not some jet power it's not some rocket power you are powered by a holy ghost fuel that never runs out it never failed in the mouth of early believers of the early apostles and it won't fail today that same power that same power that chains saul to paul is the same power that was poured out on the day of pentecost it was the same power that delivered legion it was the same power that when polycarp was being burned at the stake it was the same power that pushed those flames away from polycarp's body it's the same power that will lift you out of the layout of sea and flames that are trying to encapsulate you in getting involved in this world it's the same power that's going to lift you off of this earth the same power that raised jesus from the grave he's alive in a people and the son of man is still speaking and the son of man is still conquering and the son of man which is the word is defeating satan in your body now the son of man is in a body that he can lay his head down that he can rest his body in he is now living in a body that he can trust a body that he can move in a body that is living in with the same resurrection power and he's living in a body that's willing to put their hands against the stone and roll the stone away from the grave as same as he did 2 000 years ago that same power is living in a body that has been feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man hallelujah what power you under are you under your own control or is god controlling you who was controlling moses when he was standing there and told him to pick up his rod who was controlling a prophet when he said speak to that storm who was controlling who was controlling your pastor when he spoke the things that were impossible who's controlling you hallelujah it's time to walk out it's time to walk out of laodicea it's time to give up on the world that you live in and move into the world that you belong in now notice what he says here he said we he said we've lived the time out at the time of the rapture is at hand where we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural stent strength that can change these bodies that we live in he says when we see a god that can raise the dead off of the floor have we seen that or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us he said when we see a god who can take a cancer let's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing faith to the people have you not seen in your own midst church the dead be raised to life again have you not seen in your own midst men that had been eaten up with cancer men that have different prognosis of where cancers was they can eat them up to a shadow and raise them back should that not give us a rapturing faith that faith is a rapturing faith that will put you where satan can never get you write that down you say you're you're not some school girl you're not just some average lady walking down the street before you ever got here he placed the wedding band of unmerited grace upon your finger the reason why you believe what you believe is because he slipped that wedding band on your finger when i whisper though sweet i love yous to my little wife she believes me when i tell her things that are hardly that are hard to believe she believes me because i slipped that wedding band upon her and when jesus has promised you something you can go to the bank with it if he said he's coming he's coming if he said he heal you he healed you if he said he'd give you a baby he'll give you a baby if he said he'd deliver you he'll deliver you what power are you under [Applause] so many people want to be controlled by a different power of today they want to try to control themselves and say well i'm going to live for myself you can't even figure out what you want to eat for breakfast but yet you're going to try to make yourself live right good luck oh hallelujah but there is a power that is present right now that has ever already picked out everything you like and put it on the other side he's already made you a city that's so perfect it's got streets of gold it's got walls of jasper gates of pearl and there is no light in that city you don't need a light when the lamb is the light he has picked out everything according to the way that you like it you remember when brother george quinn he was on that trip and he was he was kind of he was kind of he was being led through an airport and he kind of got distracted on where he was going trying to find his way where he was going and something just led him to go this way and he'd come around and there was a mcdonald's there you remember he said there was a mcdonald's there he said the spirit of the lord said i led you here because you like it god cares about what you like i'm not a big fan of mcdonald's the only thing i like there's ice cream and coffee but oh i'd i would allow the holy spirit to take me to outback he knows what you like he knows how to cook you a meal that'll take you places that know you could never get yourself he knew how to make elijah some cakes and it would lead him off for 40 days he knowed how to give you a a word spoken in due ceasing he know how to give you a spiritual food in season that would take you all the way through laodicea that's filled with doubt that filled with fear filled with chaos filled with diseases he's given you a word that'll take you to a spot that you like don't you want to go if you want to know [Music] where i'm going where i'm going going someday soon if anybody asks you where i'm going [Music] i said where i'm going go one day soon just tell him for me i'm going up yonder you see he's prepared a place of yonder that he knows that i'm gonna like when i get there i'm not gonna have to worry about my hair falling out i ain't gonna have to worry about my contacts on my glasses i ain't gonna have to worry about pills i ain't got to worry about vitamins when i get over there i'm going to be perfect i'm going to be walking in a body that'll never get tired i can sing all day and nobody will get distracted by my singing they won't get upset about my praise where i'm going where i'm going there ain't no critics where i'm going there ain't no depression where i'm going there ain't no coving where i'm going there ain't no mask no two masks two face where i'm going there's perfection hallelujah now the bible says in psalms chapter 37 that the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord he knows the way that you take and when you come out you will come out as gold and here we are living under a joshua commission that every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given you as i said unto moses as i was with your servant moses so will i be with you there is nothing happening to you down here on earth there is nothing just happening in vain he knows the steps that you're going to take before you ever get there there is a place that's prepared before you but if you're going to get there you're going to have to fight you're going to have to get down in the mud you're going to have to get your hands dirty you're going to have to struggle you're going to have to belly crawl but i'm going to tell you this opening word is worth it all notice he said that's what's the matter with people tonight in divine healing and everything it's yours go take it hallelujah god promised you to walk brethren you believe it you have to take it god promised you life brother do you believe it take it god promised you joy brother do you believe it take it god said i'll give it to you it's yours now it wouldn't be right for god to go and dish all the things out he give them the land but they've got to do some house cleaning hey man it's yours but he ain't going to come poke it down your neck you got to take the land yourself he'd give it to you and it's yours rise and possess it this is where i got that sermon cleaning another day sister katie it's your choice it's your choice if you want a murmur like the other ten did you'll wander in the wilderness a long time ago till tomorrow night and still sick but if you're ready to take it tonight it's yours what kind of a choice are you going to make i will take jesus and his promise and tell the devil he's a liar god said these signs would follow them that believe lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's for you accept it believe it and walk home what choice are you going to make you got some house cleaner to do your sister's ever walked in been invited to a dinner party you get on the inside of that house and you're walking around just trying to find a place that's clean enough for you to sit down at you walk in and you think where's the pigs at bunch of pigs living in here filthy nasty looking but you've been invited there so you just don't walk in and start dusting the shelves and cleaning everything off you actually walk in there and see if you can find a newspaper so that you can sit down on it and make sure you don't get your pretty skirt dirty but you don't want to offend this this lady or this brother or whatever family that has invited you over for this dinner party you don't want to just walk up in there say hey why y'all making dinner i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to clean the cobwebs and i'm gonna make everything right i i don't you worry about the laundry i got this don't you worry about the vacuuming don't you worry about the mop and i got this you just take care of the food and make sure ain't no hair in it because it ain't your house you don't walk up in there and just start making making everything right because it ain't your house but while you're at this dinner party sisters and then you make your way back home and you're mumbling and grumbling thinking oh jesus i need to pray for that sister a whole lot more she needs to learn the power of cleaning the house you get back home and your husband's thinking well i got the night off i just sit back and i'll relax kick his shoes off got his shirt dirty shoes up on the cabinet got his dirty shoes up there on the table and got coke spilled all over the bar and hit kids who've got toys everywhere got popcorn blown out through the microwave you come home say hi not in this house a bunch of hogs don't live here when i left here with no hogs in here i know it's sure that you don't look like no hog so i don't allow hog living here you go through there as the wife of that home and you go cleaning up that nonsense and say that's the way it's supposed to be because it's your house you can clean the house it's now the expression is we clean house on that deal you know it's time that we start cleaning house on the devil everything that he's come and disrupted your life stole your joy turned over your love upset your marriage it's time that you start cleaning house on the devil that means to get rid of it means to strike violently it means to give him a beating look up the expression clean house it's time that the church of the living god start taking back what the devil stole from him if he's living in your house kick him out if he's brought depression in kick him out the prophet said he said as soon as you claim that land he said there's going to be an amorite show up he's going to raise his head and say hey this is my house and you've got to raise your hand say kick him out this ain't your house this is your house you ever been around your mama and your mama's cleaning the floor i lived with a mama knew how to clean a house thank the lord i live with a wife that knows how to clean a house thank the lord but you ever been when your mom is sweeping the floors and the kids are running everywhere a lot of redheaded kids do this they run through they run through the house and mama said don't you step in my dirt yeah there's a few people here know what i'm talking about but she's screaming no no no no don't you don't step in my dirt here the mama is taking credit for the dirt that everybody brought in it's my dirt i'll tell you right now i ain't never seen no dirt in my house that i wanted to lay claim to but i did see some children that i wanted to lay claim on their rear end says hey it's time you clean this up but you see too many times you got mamas taking credit for the children's dirt and you got to daddy making making taken credit for their children's dirt if they dumb enough to allow that stupid spirit to come in there they dumb enough to get rid of that thing it is not your fault that they get on every dirty channel it's not your fault that they spend all hours of the night gaming but if they are still under the rule of your house you got every right say not in this house it is not a messed up society when jesus comes in yes the world says that the children rule the parent but i believe that it was god's word that the parent that spoons a child where they take away the rod when they spare the rod they spool the child it's a time hold up hold up hold up i ain't preaching on family matters here but it's time that they're mad that the family starts mattering again it's a time that you start taking action in your own life now i ain't just talking about your dirt now i hope you got enough spiritual revelation i ain't talking about your mud that you brought in i'm talking about the filthiness of the world say hey this is a holy house and what happens here is going to happen by the power of the holy ghost and if you're not willing to do what is right now if they are still under the age of accountability you are their holy ghost you are their holy ghost and it is your duty to make sure they know what is right it's not delinquent children it's delinquent parents that have ruined america let me move on the bible says in ecclesiastes 7 and 8 that better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it you remember when joseph as brother matthew was speaking on last weekend on joseph how that he was how that joseph went from just being a dreamer boy that was telling his brothers that this is what god has shown me that he took him from a pit that he took him from a prison that he took him to second in command that better was the end of a thing than the beginning thereof that just because he was that just because he risen to a power there was something better that was coming than just second in power he rose to second in command that everybody had to obey and listen to what joseph said but there was something better that was coming that joseph couldn't even see but he told he told the children of israel he said don't you leave my bones down here because there is coming something better in my end than was what in my beginning he knew that there was a resurrection coming over in israel over in jerusalem and he said don't you leave my bones down here in this world of chaos take me out of here because better is the end of the thing than the better than the beginning job job was a man that was perfect job was a man that stood before god and the bible said that job that god and satan had a conversation about job he asked satan have you considered my servant job and satan said i can't get to him he said i've looked at him but i can't get to him because i you've put a heads around him that ought to show every child of god that god's placed their heads about you it ain't a bush that he's talking about here i heard somebody telling me other day said hey if god's going to put a hedge around me i'd rather be a i'd rather be a wall than a bush but if you look into what that hedge means it means that he's fortified you with spears and swords he's put a hedge of a wall of fire around you that satan can't get through and if say if god allows satan to come over there and do something to you god's got confidence in you that you're going to come out of it and better was the end of a thing than was what in the beginning of job's life you remember when the sunnah might was promised that she would receive a child better was the end of a thing than there was in the beginning because you remember when the pseudomy woman started walking towards the prophet she walked up there and she walked up there even though her son had died with a heat stroke and she walked up towards elijah and he asked oh he's all well she said all is well but my son has died the one you promised me he said but better is the end of the thing than the beginning thereof and he said to hazel you take my staff down there you take my staff down there and lay that on that boy and he'll come back to life but he realized the prophet realized real quickly that the woman's faith was not in that staff it was in the prophet and when the prophet caught the vision of her faith he went down there and laid on top of that boy sneezed seven times and the boy came back to life better was the end of the thing than the beginning thereof let me tell you something you've gone through some stuff you're going through some wrecks of life but better is the end of the thing than the beginning of it you come through layout i see you you come to the trials of life but better is the end you're not just serving a god that's hiding the future from you he's already showed the future to you and he is telling you that better is the end than the beginning you enjoyed the holy ghost when i gave it to you but the end is better than when you got it as a musician comes hallelujah when the children of israel been out at war they've been fighting they lost some brothers in battle if you read through history it'll tell you that the closer that they got they didn't get more discouraged the closer they got back to jerusalem the more cheerful they got instead of being so tore up by the battle and by the difficulties of the battle as the closer they got back to home the more cheerful and the more excited they got because they were nearing their homeland you've been through some stuff just remember you're right here at new jerusalem just remember you're right here you can see we're in the last mile of the race don't give up now don't get discouraged don't get discouraged and be depressed you're in the last mile of it run with everything you got don't be discouraged don't be upset get cheerful it is said in the scriptures that they actually danced their way back home because they were coming back to their homeland can you imagine when the church of god that went through some stuff went through some flames went through some trials of life that they would say better is the end thereof than the beginning and they start dancing their way all the way up to glory it's a highway to heaven none can walk up there about the pure heart [Music] it's a highway [Music] it's a high [Music] it's a high highway [Music] [Music] i said don't have to worry don't have to hurry we're walking up the king highway oh christ lives inside me his angels here to guide me i'm walking up the keys in heart it's a highway to heaven i'm walking up the kings highway now listen if you're not walking just start while i'm talking oh walking up the kings highway oh there'll be a blessing and you'll be possessing while we're walking up the king's highway it's a highway to heaven i said none can walk up there oh but the cure is [Music] walk up there oh but the pure in heart is so high to help walking up walking up it's a high wait to heaven oh none can't walk up there oh but [Applause] [Music] [Music] are you walking up the king's highway god bless you as you're dismissed in the name of the lord go in the name of the lord god bless you oh none can walk up there [Music] you
