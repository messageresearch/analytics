[41:04] to see each and every one of you. Isn't
[41:06] it amazing how quick a week goes?
[41:10] Amen. We took a few days for vacation
[41:12] this week for our 42nd anniversary.
[41:16] Moving toward 43, one day at a time.

[41:22] were able to take some of our family
[41:23] with us to to enjoy that and Sister
[41:25] Nancy and and uh we we had a good time.

[41:32] week at that time flies.
[41:35] I don't know about you, but they must
[41:36] put different batteries in that vacation
[41:38] week.
[41:40] Just gone. Amen. We have brother Robert
[41:45] Fiser with us tonight from Poland. He
[41:48] was with us uh maybe a couple years ago
[41:51] and just did a wonderful job for us.
[41:54] This time he has his family with us. His
[41:56] his daughter from Pennsylvania,
[41:59] Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and uh and
[42:03] son-in-law. And I know why he comes to
[42:06] America now.
[42:08] He's got three grandchildren sitting
[42:10] back there. That'll make you come to
[42:13] America. Amen. Amen. And so we're so
[42:17] thrilled to have them with us and and uh
[42:19] we certainly want to make you feel at
[42:22] home the best way that we can. And so
[42:24] thank you for being here. And uh brother
[42:26] Robert has come to us and uh Andrew was
[42:29] wanted to be here. He was
[42:32] last night he was stuck in Atlanta and
[42:35] uh couldn't get a flight out. Today he's
[42:38] been stuck in Atlanta, but he's on a
[42:40] plane right now somewhere. And so, uh,
[42:43] he was wanting to be here, but there's
[42:46] one thing for sure. You can't be in two
[42:48] places at the same time.
[42:51] I've tried it. It don't work out real
[42:53] well. And so, we'll look forward to
[42:55] having him with us in the morning. And
[42:57] and I hear that they had wonderful
[42:59] meetings in San Diego. We love those
[43:02] people there. And they're they're just
[43:04] we're, you know, we're a bride universal
[43:07] around the world
[43:10] believing the same message. and that has
[43:13] the same spirit. And no matter where you
[43:16] go, what place that you're at, we're all
[43:19] different nationalities and we're
[43:21] immigrants. All of us are im immigrants.
[43:24] Amen. All of us are. I know it's a
[43:26] political issue now, but all of us are.
[43:30] We're on our way home.
[43:35] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[43:37] passing through. And so, so tonight, for
[43:39] those that have not met Brother Robert,
[43:42] he's an incredible guy. And so, we love
[43:44] Brother Robert with all of our hearts.
[43:46] And, you know, it doesn't take long to
[43:48] to get to know somebody that, you know,
[43:50] we came from a different place and we're
[43:52] going to go back to that different
[43:53] place. Brother Robert would come this
[43:55] evening and we're looking forward to
[43:57] hearing from him and uh Amen. if he will
[44:01] come. And uh let's stand to our feet.
[44:07] Amen. God bless you. I remember one time
[44:09] I was in Florida preaching
[44:12] and uh
[44:14] and I was speaking the meeting and I'd
[44:16] already spoke four services and so now
[44:19] I'm speaking the last service and I'm
[44:21] sitting in the office
[44:24] and brother Thomas, you know, they told
[44:26] me to relax. Well, I did
[44:30] and I heard them say, "Let's sing
[44:31] Amazing Grace one more time.
[44:37] The deacon was standing outside of the
[44:38] door and I said, "How many times have I
[44:40] sung that?" And he said, "Four."
[44:45] Amen. We're so glad to have brother
[44:47] Robert. Please give him a warm hand
[44:48] tonight. God bless you.
[44:58] Thank you. Thank you. Praise the Lord.
[45:02] Oh, praise the Lord. It is great
[45:04] privilege for me to be here with you to
[45:06] stay with such warrior of faith like
[45:09] brother Ron your pastor. His great
[45:12] testimony for us and his testimony his
[45:16] life his preaching encourages us to to
[45:20] serve the Lord better and better every
[45:22] day. Amen. Praise the Lord. So that's
[45:25] great privilege. This time I came here
[45:27] with my family, with my daughter, with
[45:30] my son-in-law and three grandchildren,
[45:33] my three grandchildren. So that is great
[45:35] privilege. God bless you all. And we are
[45:38] on Saturday on Saturday evening. So we
[45:41] don't have enough time and I don't want
[45:44] to hold you too long. So please let's
[45:46] open our Bibles.
[45:58] Thank you musician. God bless you.
[46:03] Of course, greetings from Poland. A lot
[46:06] of friends, brother Daniel Mazer. I
[46:08] don't know if you remember him. We were
[46:11] here together and he sent special
[46:13] greetings for brother Ron and for the
[46:15] congregation. So, God bless you and we
[46:18] are one family, brother and sisters. We
[46:20] are really one family because we have
[46:22] the same father and our father is
[46:24] tonight here. Can you say amen? And he
[46:27] is here because of you because of me of
[46:30] me because of your problem, because of
[46:33] your need, because of my need. He's here
[46:36] to be with us. Not only to be with us
[46:38] but to help us brothers and sisters.
[46:41] Amen. So I just want to share with you
[46:44] some thoughts. very very uh simple
[46:48] subject. You have to be like Isaiah in
[46:51] his visions.
[46:53] You have to be like Isaiah in his
[46:56] visions. Not only in one vision but in
[47:00] his visions. Amen. So Proverbs very
[47:03] well-known scripture before we'll pray.
[47:06] Proverbs 29 verse 18.
[47:10] Proverb Proverbs 29 and verse 18.
[47:17] Solomon, he says here, "Where there is
[47:19] no vision, the people perish,
[47:22] but he that keepeth the law, happy is
[47:25] he." Amen.
[47:27] Where there is no vision, the people
[47:30] perish. Not maybe, not perhaps, not 99%.
[47:36] He said, "Where there is no vision,
[47:39] the people perish, but he that keepeth
[47:43] the law, happy is he." Amen. Let's pray
[47:46] together. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[47:48] for this opportunity to be here this
[47:51] evening. We commit everything into your
[47:53] hands. We are needy people, Lord Jesus.
[47:56] But you are with us. We are your
[47:57] children. We can call you father, daddy,
[48:01] and we are here. And please speak to us.
[48:05] touch our hearts, touch our needs, Lord
[48:07] Jesus, and take the whole glory because
[48:09] we ask you and thank you already in the
[48:12] precious name, the name of Jesus Christ.
[48:15] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[48:18] So, brothers and sisters, please forgive
[48:20] me for my English. I came from Poland.
[48:24] Poland is a small country in Europe.
[48:27] Maybe not too small, but not too big as
[48:29] your country. And we speak daily Polish,
[48:34] not English, but Polish
[48:36] in church, in work, with family, with
[48:39] wife, with kids. When I came here, I
[48:42] speak Polish with my family. Still
[48:44] Polish, Polish, Polish. And suddenly I
[48:47] have to speak English. So please forgive
[48:49] me my mistakes.
[48:52] But you know, I want to be fu focused on
[48:56] the word of God. and my only hope is in
[49:00] him. Amen. So the message come let us
[49:04] reason together you know this quote you
[49:07] know all quotes because you speak
[49:10] English you don't need any translator
[49:13] this is something normal for you but
[49:16] brothers and sisters sometimes we have
[49:18] to stop and ask ourselves it it came
[49:21] something bigger d deeper to our hearts.
[49:25] Amen. Amen.
[49:27] So in the message come let us reason
[49:29] together. Prophet said someone said to
[49:31] me not long ago. Brother Brham I would
[49:34] give anything if I could see a vision. I
[49:38] put my arm around him a real brother. I
[49:41] said my beloved brother. Every time you
[49:44] open the Bible you see a vision. God
[49:48] revealing himself. Here is God's vision.
[49:52] Just open it up. Amen. and say, "God,
[49:55] now open my eyes that I can see you. The
[49:59] word is God and here is God." And every
[50:02] time, every time you open the Bible, you
[50:07] see a vision of God speaking forth to
[50:11] you said with a humble heart. Amen. That
[50:15] is what we need tonight to open our
[50:17] Bible and to see something more than
[50:20] just the letter. something more than
[50:24] just the information,
[50:26] brothers and sisters, because we have to
[50:28] see Lord Jesus himself, not only here in
[50:33] the midst of us, but in us, inside of
[50:37] us. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. And book
[50:40] of the book of Revelation, Revelation
[50:43] 3:18 and 20 and 12, prophet said uh uh
[50:47] 11 and 12. Revelation 11 3:11 and 3:12.
[50:53] The book of Revelation says, "Behold, I
[50:55] come quickly. Hold that fast which thou
[50:58] hast that no man take thy crone." Amen.
[51:03] Him that overcome will I make a pillar
[51:06] in the temple of my God. And he shall go
[51:09] no more out, and I will write upon him
[51:13] the name of my God, and the name of the
[51:16] city of my God, which is New Jerusalem,
[51:19] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[51:23] God, and I will write upon him my new
[51:26] name. and about the scripture in an
[51:30] exposition of the seven church ages
[51:32] prophet said we don't need to comment on
[51:36] the thought that he is coming quickly we
[51:40] know that he is because we are in the
[51:44] end of the last days aren't we? But he
[51:48] goes on say, "Hold fast what you have
[51:53] that no man take your crown."
[51:57] It is in the midst of a time of great
[52:00] trouble that Jesus comes.
[52:03] And with his coming there is a
[52:05] resurrection. Can we say amen? With his
[52:09] coming tonight, there is a resurrection.
[52:12] Maybe you pray for your family, for your
[52:14] kids or your parents. Maybe they are
[52:16] somewhere in the world. But with his
[52:19] coming there is a true resurrection
[52:22] not to any confession but through to to
[52:27] the whole to the true life of Jesus
[52:29] Christ. Oh brother and sisters and we
[52:32] are as prophet said we are in in in the
[52:37] time we are living in the time of great
[52:39] trouble and Jesus he comes in the time.
[52:44] So brothers and sisters, we see the
[52:47] situation in the world. Can we see it?
[52:51] We see the no the king of the north. Mr.
[52:54] Putin, the king of the north. What was
[52:56] said to prophet? Watch Russia. Watch
[52:59] Russia, the king of the north. We see
[53:02] the situation in the Middle East. Amen.
[53:05] With Israel. What was said to prophet?
[53:08] Watch Israel. Watch Israel. Amen. So
[53:11] king of the north, he's raising. He's
[53:14] raising to take his position.
[53:18] What is in Israel? Everyone is against
[53:21] Israel, but they are still safe. Why?
[53:25] Because someone someone protects them.
[53:28] That is the mighty hand of Jehovah. What
[53:31] is with the bride of Jesus Christ? We
[53:34] see all this information. All what
[53:37] prophet said to us is fulfilling in our
[53:40] days. the pope from the states on the
[53:43] throne in Vatican. Can you say amen?
[53:48] Donald Trump as your very strong
[53:51] president. Amen.
[53:53] Not weak president but very strong
[53:56] because everything from the Bible has to
[54:00] be fulfilled and we are living in this
[54:03] time. Not only to say what prophet said
[54:07] is truth because this is truth brother
[54:09] and sisters but what with you what we
[54:12] does what with me.
[54:15] Who we are today who we are tonight we
[54:18] are the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. We
[54:23] are not just a members of any messy
[54:26] church. We are the bride of Jesus
[54:28] Christ. Can you say amen? Praise the
[54:32] Lord.
[54:35] Hebrew chapter 1 prophet said now on
[54:39] this side when people get converted
[54:43] their minds is set right on Christ
[54:47] and if they are just a little scholar
[54:51] and don't keep under prayer they'll get
[54:55] real cold and stiff and starchy and
[55:00] indifferent
[55:02] and Then if they are just a little bit
[55:05] nervous,
[55:06] if you don't watch, they will just get
[55:09] radical and wild on this side. See, they
[55:14] go into sensations and everything
[55:18] now. But the real church is a real saint
[55:22] gospel right in the middle of the road.
[55:26] It is not cold on sty
[55:29] fanaticism. It is a real good old warm
[55:33] gospel. Hurtfelt love of God going right
[55:38] down the middle of the road calling from
[55:42] both sides. That's right. Can you say
[55:45] amen? Amen. Are you in the middle of the
[55:48] road? Oh, brothers and sisters, that is
[55:50] what we need as the bride of Jesus
[55:53] Christ.
[55:54] Not only to say we are on the road, we
[55:57] have to be in the middle of the road
[56:01] because this time is time to go home.
[56:04] Amen. Amen.
[56:06] The end time. Prophet said in 1954,
[56:11] you always talk about how bad the world
[56:14] is, how weak the world is. That's true.
[56:17] But look how great the church is getting
[56:20] all the time. We failed to look at this
[56:23] that side. Jesus said, "Lay, let let
[56:26] them grow together." When the world's
[56:28] getting wiggler and wiggler and w
[56:30] wether, the church is getting more
[56:33] powerful and more powerful all the time.
[56:37] When the enemy comes in like a flood,
[56:40] the spirit of God will raise up a stand
[56:43] against it. Hallelujah. Let's go. Glory.
[56:46] What do you care? Who is the captain? He
[56:49] will take care of it. Amen. Where is
[56:52] captain? He's here. Where? He's here.
[56:56] This day, this scripture is fulfilled in
[57:00] your eyes. Can you say amen? Amen. Oh,
[57:03] praise God. And Dr. Moses
[57:08] 1955 prophet said, "You know what? I
[57:10] begin to believe Christian friend that
[57:13] we are just living in the beginning of
[57:15] the greatest time this world has ever
[57:18] witnessed. I just believe that all of
[57:21] the lines are getting uncloded.
[57:24] But it's come to place where God not
[57:28] man. What we need is to just stay and
[57:33] look at him and say Lord here am I. Let
[57:37] it be according to thy word. Amen. So
[57:43] you have I have we have to be like
[57:46] Isaiah in his visions. Amen.
[57:50] Very very simple just to encourage you
[57:53] and encourage myself because it works on
[57:57] both sides. If this preaching will
[58:00] encourage you if if it will encourage me
[58:03] as well. Amen. So Isaiah 1:1, the vision
[58:08] of Isaiah, the son of Am Amos, which he
[58:11] saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in
[58:14] the days of Uzziah, Jotam, Ahaz, and
[58:18] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
[58:21] So when he started to write his letter,
[58:27] he started with these words, the vision
[58:30] of Isaiah.
[58:32] The vision of Isaiah.
[58:35] Now Isaiah 2:1,
[58:38] the word that Isaiah the son of Ammos
[58:42] saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
[58:47] So that that that was another step.
[58:50] First he saw a vision
[58:53] in first chapter. In second chapter he
[58:57] saw the word.
[58:59] the word which came to him.
[59:03] Amen.
[59:04] And now we'll skip to this scripture,
[59:09] fundamental scripture. Isaiah 6.
[59:13] In the year that King Usuza Uzziah died,
[59:16] I saw also the Lord
[59:19] sitting upon a throne high and lifted up
[59:23] and his train filled the temple. First
[59:27] step, that was a vision.
[59:29] Second step, that was the word. He saw a
[59:32] word. But third step, he saw the Lord of
[59:39] hosts sitting upon a throne high and
[59:43] lifted up and his train filled the
[59:45] temple. Who is his temple? You and me,
[59:50] we are his temple. Oh brother and
[59:53] sister, we know because we are good uh
[59:56] you know readers of the Bible of the
[1:00:00] message we know all quotes especially
[1:00:04] according to our time we like personally
[1:00:09] myself really I love this quotes that
[1:00:13] pope from the states
[1:00:15] we that the the cardinal from the states
[1:00:18] will become a pope We love it.
[1:00:23] But brothers and sisters, we have to see
[1:00:26] something more in this message. Not only
[1:00:31] the word which came concerning Judah and
[1:00:34] concerning Jerusalem. All the vision
[1:00:37] which came concerning Judah and
[1:00:40] concerning Jerusalem. But we have to be
[1:00:43] also in sixth chapter of Isaiah. We have
[1:00:47] to see the Lord of hosts sitting on the
[1:00:51] throne in his temple. My question
[1:00:55] tonight is is he the Lord in the temple
[1:00:59] of your body of your spirit? Brother and
[1:01:02] sisters, we can jump and jump. That's an
[1:01:06] not it is nothing against it.
[1:01:10] I like because I as a person I am very
[1:01:14] emot emotional person. But brother and
[1:01:16] sister, we have to see something more.
[1:01:20] Our experience has to be something more
[1:01:24] than just jumping, running, crying.
[1:01:28] We have to see himself in his temple.
[1:01:33] Paul said you are his temple.
[1:01:38] Can you say amen? Brothers and sisters,
[1:01:41] brother Ron, he he said to me, "Feel
[1:01:44] like home." I feel like home in my local
[1:01:48] church really. I I preach the same to my
[1:01:51] local church.
[1:01:53] Some people they have 40 years maybe
[1:01:56] more in the message.
[1:01:58] But I I ask them every time what is your
[1:02:02] experience
[1:02:04] that that pope from America is according
[1:02:07] what prophet prophesied or something
[1:02:10] more you see in this message. You have
[1:02:13] to see your position. You have to see
[1:02:17] him yourself as a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:20] because you can be you can be just a
[1:02:23] message believer. But there is another
[1:02:26] position position of the bride of Jesus
[1:02:29] Christ. Oh brother and sister, this is a
[1:02:31] special position.
[1:02:34] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:37] So in the year that King Uzziah died
[1:02:40] that was the you know the greatest
[1:02:43] problem for Uzziah was his friend King
[1:02:48] from from Isaiah. Amen. But in the year
[1:02:52] that King Uzziah died, I saw also the
[1:02:56] Lord. Not just a vision, not just that
[1:02:59] was good message from William Branham.
[1:03:01] He saw Lord himself. Oh, praise the
[1:03:05] Lord. This is this is what the bride of
[1:03:07] Jesus Christ needs.
[1:03:13] Above it stood the saraphims. Each one
[1:03:16] had six wings. With twain he covered his
[1:03:19] face, and with twain he covered his
[1:03:21] feet, and with twain he did fly. And one
[1:03:25] cried unto another and said, "Holy,
[1:03:28] holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The
[1:03:31] whole earth is full of his glory.
[1:03:35] Can we see God in everything?
[1:03:39] In his nature, in his creation,
[1:03:43] in my brother, in my sister, in your
[1:03:47] wife, can you see him in you? When you
[1:03:52] are staying before the mirror, can you
[1:03:57] see God and his glory?
[1:04:02] Thank you, Lord. And the post of the
[1:04:05] door moved at the voice of him that
[1:04:08] cried, and the house was filled with
[1:04:11] smoke. Then said, I,
[1:04:14] that was Isaiah. We have to be like
[1:04:17] Isaiah in his visions.
[1:04:21] When came vision concerning Judah,
[1:04:24] concerning Jerusalem. Oh, that was very
[1:04:28] very you know comfort zone for him.
[1:04:32] That was concerning Judah. That was
[1:04:35] concerning Jerusalem.
[1:04:37] Oh, when the word came to him, still he
[1:04:41] was in his comfort zone,
[1:04:43] concerning Judah, concerning Jerusalem.
[1:04:48] But now
[1:04:50] it changed.
[1:04:52] The word came to him and he saw not only
[1:04:57] good message of William Brahham, he saw
[1:05:01] the Lord of himself
[1:05:05] and the same Isaiah. Amen. The same
[1:05:09] prophet.
[1:05:11] He said, "Who is me?" Amen. For I am
[1:05:16] undone.
[1:05:18] Whoa. Who? Isaiah,
[1:05:20] you in me churches.
[1:05:24] I Yes, brother and sisters.
[1:05:27] Yes, brother and sisters. We need to
[1:05:30] meet him every day. We need to meet him
[1:05:33] every time.
[1:05:36] Not only on Sunday or Saturday or
[1:05:38] Wednesday when you come to your church.
[1:05:42] We have to meet him every time. In your
[1:05:45] kitchen, sister. In your bedroom,
[1:05:47] brother.
[1:05:48] We have to meet him to have fellowship
[1:05:51] with him to hear from him. Can you say
[1:05:56] amen?
[1:05:58] Amen. What was his testimony? That was
[1:06:02] testimony of God's prophet.
[1:06:05] He was prophet. He said the vision came
[1:06:09] to me. The word came to me. And he said
[1:06:13] against Judah, against Jerusalem, and
[1:06:16] everything was fulfilled.
[1:06:19] Still the same Isaiah.
[1:06:23] And he said, "Woe me, for I am undone
[1:06:29] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[1:06:32] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:06:34] unclean lips." He said about his
[1:06:37] congregation.
[1:06:39] Whoa, brothers and sisters. But he
[1:06:41] didn't say they have unclean lips and I
[1:06:46] am okay.
[1:06:47] But they were on the same level. We are
[1:06:51] on the same level.
[1:06:53] Here we have some offices but in the
[1:06:57] heaven in him we are on the same level.
[1:07:01] Can you say amen brother Ron? Oh praise
[1:07:03] the lord. Amen.
[1:07:08] for mine eyes
[1:07:10] have seen the king the lord of hosts or
[1:07:15] he saw something more than just 1,200
[1:07:20] sermons of William Brham
[1:07:22] he saw Jesus Christ himself
[1:07:26] how this is what I want to see in this
[1:07:28] message every day oh brother and sister
[1:07:31] every day when I am driving my car to my
[1:07:36] work and I I am listening to the Bible
[1:07:39] or to the message. I want to meet my God
[1:07:44] to listen from him to listen him to hear
[1:07:47] from him. Oh brother and sisters,
[1:07:52] then flew one of the saraphims unto me,
[1:07:56] having a live call in his hand, which he
[1:08:00] had taken with the tongues from of the
[1:08:03] altar.
[1:08:05] and he laid it upon my mouth and said,
[1:08:08] "Lo, this had touched thy lips, and
[1:08:12] thine iniquity is taken away, and thine
[1:08:15] sin parched." Oh, brothers and sisters,
[1:08:18] sometimes we are like babies.
[1:08:21] Oh, we want that our pastor will say,
[1:08:24] "Okay, you are all right. You are
[1:08:26] message believer. Come, we'll pray for
[1:08:28] you. Everything okay. I am not against
[1:08:32] prayers. We practice it in our church.
[1:08:37] But brothers and sisters, we can pray
[1:08:39] for you day after day, Sunday after
[1:08:43] Sunday, meeting after meeting. And we
[1:08:47] will try to convince you, oh, you are a
[1:08:50] child of God. You are his son. You are
[1:08:53] his daughter.
[1:08:55] But this Saraphim, he didn't he didn't
[1:08:59] tell this way.
[1:09:01] He said no he didn't say hey Isaiah you
[1:09:05] are very good man you are even prophet
[1:09:09] don't say this way just change your
[1:09:12] confession
[1:09:14] oh I will I am with you I am your father
[1:09:19] you know I am your brother but who what
[1:09:24] he was doing he laid it upon my mouth
[1:09:28] and said lo this had touched thy lips.
[1:09:32] This is what we have to recognize. What
[1:09:36] touched our lips? Our spiritual soul.
[1:09:40] Our spiritual lips. What touched? Not
[1:09:43] word of brother Ron. Come on.
[1:09:47] But living call from the altar of God.
[1:09:52] Hope brother and sisters this message is
[1:09:54] the living call from the al altar of God
[1:09:58] to touch your lips to touch your lips to
[1:10:01] touch my lips. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:10:06] And thine iniquity is taken away. Not
[1:10:09] you are in process, Isaiah. Stay here
[1:10:13] longer. Stay here longer. know
[1:10:17] thine iniquity is taken away and thy
[1:10:20] impeded.
[1:10:22] Oh brothers and sisters, this message
[1:10:25] came to us
[1:10:28] to show us who we are and why this
[1:10:32] message came in the full power.
[1:10:36] Don't say that this message has no power
[1:10:40] because this message is full of power.
[1:10:43] Amen. If you cannot operate
[1:10:47] on this power,
[1:10:49] don't blame the message. Don't blame
[1:10:52] God. God is full of power. This message
[1:10:56] is full of power.
[1:10:58] This living call is full of power to
[1:11:02] take your sin away to take my sin away.
[1:11:06] To change my confession. Amen. Brothers
[1:11:09] and sisters,
[1:11:11] according to the Bible, if your sin will
[1:11:14] be taken away, your confession will be
[1:11:17] changed.
[1:11:18] Your confession will be changed.
[1:11:23] As confession of Isaiah was changed
[1:11:30] also. I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:11:32] saying, "Whom shall I send
[1:11:36] and who will go for us?" The same
[1:11:38] Isaiah. Still the same Isaiah
[1:11:42] who was read who was writing Isaiah 1:1,
[1:11:46] Isaiah 2:1, Isaiah 61, 62, 63. The same
[1:11:51] Isaiah. But after this experience,
[1:11:55] after this vision,
[1:11:57] he said, "Not worries me." But he said,
[1:12:02] "Here am I. Send me."
[1:12:07] Are you ready to say tonight, Lord, send
[1:12:11] me to my family? Send me to my son. Send
[1:12:16] me to my daughter. Send me to my
[1:12:18] parents. Send me to my brother who is
[1:12:22] somewhere in the world. Send me. Amen.
[1:12:25] Are you willingly to say like Isaiah
[1:12:29] did.
[1:12:31] Oh, brothers and sisters,
[1:12:33] oh brother and sister, this is what the
[1:12:35] bride of Jesus Christ needs tonight
[1:12:39] to have the same vision. We have a lot
[1:12:42] of information.
[1:12:45] We have a lot of information.
[1:12:48] Can you say amen? Amen, brothers and
[1:12:50] sisters. But we don't need more
[1:12:53] information.
[1:12:54] We need to meet God not just like a
[1:12:58] message book but person person of Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ. We need to meet him.
[1:13:07] Oh brother and sisters
[1:13:12] and prophet said in the message faith
[1:13:14] without works is dead. He said he is the
[1:13:18] high priest of our confession.
[1:13:22] He is sitting at the right hand of the
[1:13:25] father to make good anything that we
[1:13:28] confess that he has done.
[1:13:31] But he cannot do nothing for us until
[1:13:34] first we confess that he has done it and
[1:13:38] act upon it.
[1:13:40] This vision change confession of Isaiah.
[1:13:44] He said wo is me. Wo is me. Oh
[1:13:47] concerning Judah. Oh, he was in comfort
[1:13:50] zone concern concerning Jerusalem. Still
[1:13:53] he was in comfort zone concerning to the
[1:13:56] people in denominations. We are in
[1:13:58] comfort zone. Oh, because we have
[1:14:01] message. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:04] But we have to come to this vision to
[1:14:08] meet him face to face.
[1:14:10] Oh brothers and sisters, your pastor, he
[1:14:14] only can lead you to this point. But
[1:14:18] then you have to meet God
[1:14:22] personally
[1:14:23] face to face. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:14:32] So first his confession
[1:14:37] had to be changed. Amen.
[1:14:40] And then Isaiah he could act upon his
[1:14:46] new confession.
[1:14:48] But this is not the end of this story.
[1:14:52] And prophet said
[1:14:55] that's the order. See, you believe now
[1:14:59] that you receive it and it shall be
[1:15:02] given unto you. That's the future. For
[1:15:05] he is the high priest to make
[1:15:08] intercession for your confession. And he
[1:15:12] cannot heal you until first you confess
[1:15:15] he has. Amen. He already healed brother
[1:15:19] wrong.
[1:15:21] Amen. Before foundation of the world, he
[1:15:25] healed brother wrong. We are in the
[1:15:28] process. But we we have to see the
[1:15:32] vision, the picture and we have to start
[1:15:35] to act upon it. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:15:40] Brothers and sisters,
[1:15:42] how many people with fourth stage cancer
[1:15:46] died? Your pastor is still alive. Why?
[1:15:51] Because he caught a vision
[1:15:54] and he is acting upon this vision.
[1:15:59] Can you say amen?
[1:16:09] It doesn't uh you know it doesn't mean
[1:16:12] that your body will not seek. Yes, we'll
[1:16:17] be sick sometimes.
[1:16:19] But if you will catch the vision,
[1:16:22] brothers and sisters, maybe devil will
[1:16:24] will come and try to convince you. But
[1:16:27] your children, they are somewhere in the
[1:16:30] world. Don't worry.
[1:16:33] Just start to thank God to pray with
[1:16:37] thanksgiving. Brothers and sisters,
[1:16:40] but first you have to recognize it. You
[1:16:44] have to meet God face to face as Isaiah
[1:16:48] did. Not only to repeat, oh, pope from
[1:16:51] the states will be uh the the cardinal
[1:16:54] from the states will be on the throne.
[1:16:57] This is history.
[1:16:59] He is already on the throne. Right.
[1:17:02] Amen.
[1:17:03] Don't just repeat that king of the north
[1:17:07] will will will raise.
[1:17:11] He is on his position
[1:17:14] already on his position.
[1:17:17] Brothers and sisters,
[1:17:19] this is just a a g a play a game. Don't
[1:17:23] see they say we'll destroy him. the all
[1:17:27] nations in that that was I think in in
[1:17:31] 2022
[1:17:33] when he entered Ukraine
[1:17:36] all mean prime ministers all presidents
[1:17:39] in Europe they said we will destroy
[1:17:42] Russia and Mr. Putin
[1:17:46] where is he? Russia is in better
[1:17:49] condition in economy
[1:17:52] than before the war.
[1:17:56] Why? Because he recognized his position
[1:17:59] and his time.
[1:18:01] What with the bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:18:04] Brothers and sisters, what with the
[1:18:06] bride of Jesus Christ? Why we are
[1:18:09] waiting and waiting to to to defend
[1:18:12] ourselves against devil? What Israel
[1:18:17] did? They attack iron not in Israel on
[1:18:22] Iron's territory.
[1:18:24] We have to take our position. We have to
[1:18:28] go to devil and say go out of my son. Go
[1:18:32] out of my wife. Go out of my family. You
[1:18:35] have no rights to my family. You have no
[1:18:38] rights to my healing, to my health.
[1:18:42] Can you say amen?
[1:18:48] Don't wait that your pastor will pray
[1:18:51] for you and pray for you. Take your
[1:18:54] position, bride of Jesus Christ. Take
[1:18:57] your position tonight.
[1:18:59] We are needy people. Amen. But we are
[1:19:02] bride of Jesus Christ. We are his queen.
[1:19:07] It means something.
[1:19:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:13] The same message prophet said, "I
[1:19:14] believe in old fashioned repentance, but
[1:19:17] you can you could stay there and repent
[1:19:20] until year after year and you'd never be
[1:19:23] saved until you believe in your heart,
[1:19:28] that he has saved you and raised up and
[1:19:33] confess it. Confess it that he already
[1:19:37] saved your children.
[1:19:40] He saved your parents.
[1:19:43] Can you say amen? He already healed you,
[1:19:46] brother and sisters.
[1:19:57] But if he was standing here tonight
[1:19:59] dressed in this clothes, he could not do
[1:20:03] any more for you than what he's doing
[1:20:06] here night after night.
[1:20:08] Is that right? He could tell you what
[1:20:11] who you were, what you've done, what was
[1:20:15] wrong with you, but he could not heal
[1:20:18] you until you believed it.
[1:20:21] Until you believed it.
[1:20:31] You are just I I am skipping. You are
[1:20:34] just making yourself fight with air.
[1:20:38] until in your heart you believe that you
[1:20:42] are healed. Cuz now remember you can't
[1:20:46] play with Satan. He knows whether you
[1:20:49] believe or not. Don't you try just to
[1:20:52] make out. You really believe.
[1:20:56] Really believe. Brothers and sisters, if
[1:21:00] it is required of us to be to really
[1:21:03] believe what it means that real faith,
[1:21:07] real faith is here. I said real faith is
[1:21:10] here. We receive something more than
[1:21:13] just 1,200 messages. We received real
[1:21:18] faith. We receive the person of Jesus
[1:21:21] Christ here night after night, Sunday
[1:21:25] after Sunday. Preaching after preaching,
[1:21:28] Jesus Christ is here to take you, to
[1:21:31] come and meet you and meet your need,
[1:21:34] brother and sisters.
[1:21:41] And now think friends that you would get
[1:21:44] down to business with God. He'd come to
[1:21:47] business with you. You are healed just
[1:21:51] by the same merits that you are saved
[1:21:54] by. You are saved by the merits of
[1:21:57] Christ. Is that right? Now, not trust
[1:22:01] your own merits. There's nothing you can
[1:22:04] do to be saved. Only believe on him. I
[1:22:09] couldn't go to heaven in my
[1:22:11] righteousness. Neither could you go
[1:22:13] there in your righteousness.
[1:22:16] God wouldn't receive it, but he will
[1:22:19] receive the righteousness of his son.
[1:22:22] And if we believe on him, as the
[1:22:24] scripture says, believe that he is and
[1:22:28] will confess him, he will work the
[1:22:31] righteousness in us.
[1:22:34] Praise God.
[1:22:36] Praise God. Brothers and sisters,
[1:22:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:22:43] and forever.
[1:22:45] Amen.
[1:22:46] We like to repeat and repeat the
[1:22:49] scripture but we have to act upon the
[1:22:52] scripture
[1:22:54] that he is still the same. How he can be
[1:22:57] the same today? He can be the same in
[1:23:00] you. He can be the same in me. He can
[1:23:04] because he is the same in his bride. Oh,
[1:23:08] praise the Lord.
[1:23:13] Isaiah 7. So first that was Isaiah 1, I
[1:23:17] saw a vision. Isaiah 2, I saw a word,
[1:23:22] the word come to me. Isaiah 6, I saw the
[1:23:27] Lord himself
[1:23:28] sitting on the throne. In his temple.
[1:23:33] Where is he tonight? In his temple. Are
[1:23:36] you his temple?
[1:23:38] Are you his temple? This message came to
[1:23:42] show us that we are his temple.
[1:23:46] Amen. We love our buildings but we are
[1:23:50] real temple of God. Not this building.
[1:23:54] We thanks God for it but we are his real
[1:23:57] temple. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:00] And then
[1:24:02] that was Isaiah 6 third step but we have
[1:24:06] to come farther to fourth step. Can you
[1:24:10] say amen? Amen. Are you following me?
[1:24:13] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. Do you
[1:24:16] understand my English?
[1:24:18] Thank you.
[1:24:21] Isaiah 7.
[1:24:23] Seven couldn't be before six
[1:24:28] because God is God of order. So we have
[1:24:32] first one 2 3 4 5 6 and then seven not
[1:24:38] before but then
[1:24:41] and seven one and it came to pass in the
[1:24:44] days of Aas the son of Jotam
[1:24:48] the son of Uzziah king of Judah that
[1:24:51] Dresen the king of Syria and Pekka the
[1:24:54] son of Ramalia king of Israel went up
[1:24:58] toward Jerusalem to war against it but
[1:25:01] could not prevail against it. Amen. This
[1:25:04] is our day. Hallelujah. The whole power
[1:25:07] is against the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:10] It's not against Russia. Is not against
[1:25:13] somewhere there is against you in fact.
[1:25:15] Amen. Amen. And we'll skip to verse 10.
[1:25:22] Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Aas,
[1:25:25] saying, Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy
[1:25:29] God. Ask it either in the depth or in
[1:25:34] the height above.
[1:25:36] Amen. Praise the Lord. Lord himself is
[1:25:41] on the scene. Hallelujah. And here is
[1:25:45] his desire. Oh, praise the Lord. But Aas
[1:25:48] said, I will not ask, neither will I
[1:25:52] tempt the Lord.
[1:25:54] Whoa.
[1:25:56] It looks so humble,
[1:25:59] but it is not humble.
[1:26:02] It is not humble.
[1:26:04] When God, he wants to give something to
[1:26:07] you.
[1:26:09] Don't be too humble.
[1:26:12] But be real humble to take it from his
[1:26:16] hand.
[1:26:17] Can you say amen? Amen. He has healing
[1:26:21] for you tonight. Amen. He is he has
[1:26:24] deliverance for you tonight and he is
[1:26:27] here and he's still the same and he he's
[1:26:32] saying ask me ask me for a sign ask me
[1:26:36] for something my bride I am here not
[1:26:40] only to say who will be next pope
[1:26:44] brothers and sisters it would be so sad
[1:26:47] if we as message believer only thing we
[1:26:49] know we knew is who will be next pope
[1:26:54] who will be next president about
[1:26:57] situation in Palestine. We have to know
[1:27:00] that he is here and he is asking you but
[1:27:05] why he's asking you because he wants to
[1:27:09] give you something
[1:27:11] something more
[1:27:13] because you are special for him. Oh
[1:27:16] brother and sisters.
[1:27:23] And he said, "Hearing now, oh house of
[1:27:28] David, is it a small thing for you to
[1:27:32] worry man, but will you worry my God
[1:27:36] also?"
[1:27:38] Therefore, I love it. Therefore, the
[1:27:42] Lord himself. Amen. As we believe that
[1:27:45] he is here tonight and as we believe
[1:27:48] that he is the same yesterday, today and
[1:27:51] forever,
[1:27:53] we have to believe that these words are
[1:27:57] true.
[1:27:59] Therefore, the Lord himself shall give
[1:28:02] you a sign. Not maybe, I will see, but I
[1:28:07] will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin
[1:28:10] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[1:28:13] call his name Emmanuel.
[1:28:16] Oh brother and sisters, this is the sign
[1:28:19] what God he wants to give you and give
[1:28:22] me tonight himself into our soul into
[1:28:27] our heart. Oh, praise the Lord brothers
[1:28:30] and sisters. Hallelujah.
[1:28:34] Faith without works is dead. Prophet
[1:28:36] said, "Now I am not excited, but I know
[1:28:41] what I am speaking of. The right mental
[1:28:44] attitude towards any promise of God will
[1:28:47] bring it to pass."
[1:28:50] There it is.
[1:28:52] Here is the first and only foundation
[1:28:55] for divine healing or anything from God
[1:28:59] is the Bible. This is your vision,
[1:29:01] brothers and sisters. And this vision
[1:29:04] has a voice. Is not just a mute vision.
[1:29:08] This vision has a voice not only to
[1:29:11] repeat and repeat but to see Lord
[1:29:14] himself in your life. Amen. Oh brother
[1:29:18] and sisters,
[1:29:24] if you get off of that, you are out of
[1:29:27] God's will.
[1:29:30] And now Jehovah Gyra
[1:29:33] because he is here. Do you believe that
[1:29:37] brother and sister? I laugh to repeat
[1:29:40] that he is here because this is what I
[1:29:44] believe in that he is here because
[1:29:47] without him without him we are nothing.
[1:29:51] We can preach day meeting after meeting.
[1:29:55] We can sit and listening meeting after
[1:29:58] meeting. But without him we are nothing.
[1:30:02] We are nothing.
[1:30:06] Jehovah Gyra
[1:30:08] prophet said there was a prayer meeting
[1:30:11] a prayer line and prophet said there is
[1:30:14] a spirit coming from the woman calling
[1:30:17] in the audience and I can't tell where
[1:30:20] it is see demons sympathize sympathize
[1:30:25] with one another and they call help if
[1:30:29] they can only reinforce it enough to get
[1:30:32] this woman to disbelief, she will walk
[1:30:36] off with her same condition.
[1:30:39] Brothers and sisters,
[1:30:41] who was in trouble when prophet was on
[1:30:44] earth? Who was in trouble? Not William
[1:30:47] Brham, but demons. They were in trouble
[1:30:53] and they have to be in trouble again.
[1:30:56] Why? Because the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:01] he is taking her position. Oh brothers
[1:31:04] and sisters not only to point on Russia,
[1:31:08] Russia, Israel, Palestine, Iran thing
[1:31:12] like that. No brothers and sisters, Pope
[1:31:14] Vatican, we are the bride of Jesus
[1:31:16] Christ.
[1:31:18] We have real power.
[1:31:21] Amen.
[1:31:23] To prevail every demon. I said every
[1:31:27] demon, demon of cancer, we have enough
[1:31:31] power to prevail this demon
[1:31:34] to help brother Ron. Can you say amen?
[1:31:38] This church has enough power.
[1:31:42] This church has enough power.
[1:31:47] Why? Because Jesus Christ is still the
[1:31:49] same and we are his wife.
[1:31:58] there's something wrong with her.
[1:32:02] But she if they get her to disbelief,
[1:32:06] but
[1:32:08] if the angel of the Lord can get a hold
[1:32:12] of her enough to get the vision started,
[1:32:17] then she'll go away believing and
[1:32:19] receive.
[1:32:21] But he's calling. Yes. Right there.
[1:32:25] Who was calling?
[1:32:28] Demon. Demons were calling.
[1:32:32] Why? Because they recognized that they
[1:32:35] are in problem.
[1:32:38] Because Jesus Christ is still the same
[1:32:41] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:32:45] Hallelujah. Brothers and sisters,
[1:32:47] whatever is your problem,
[1:32:50] devil has not enough power
[1:32:54] to keep you in your problem, in your
[1:32:57] condition. Why? Because Jesus Christ. In
[1:33:00] form of the bride of Jesus Christ, he is
[1:33:02] here. He is in her. He is in you.
[1:33:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the
[1:33:09] Lord.
[1:33:12] God brought him trouble for one thing.
[1:33:14] in God. Broen got trouble, haven't you?
[1:33:17] Yes, sir. Sitting there with the little
[1:33:20] checkered black sweater on. Uh-huh.
[1:33:23] Yeah, that's you. You are both bothered
[1:33:26] with bronical trouble. That's right. He
[1:33:30] is going to lose the battle.
[1:33:33] Who? Demon.
[1:33:35] He's going to lose the battle. It
[1:33:38] lightens up. It lightens up. Oh, praise
[1:33:41] the Lord.
[1:33:42] Why? Because Jesus Christ, he's still
[1:33:45] the same. Amen. Amen. Oh, brothers and
[1:33:49] sisters, how many Isaiah is here? But
[1:33:54] not Isaiah 1:1, Isaiah 2:1, Isaiah 6:1,
[1:34:00] but Isaiah 7. Behold, the virgin will
[1:34:04] conceive and bear a son, and they will
[1:34:07] call his name Emmanuel.
[1:34:10] Where is Emmanuel tonight? In you. In
[1:34:14] me. Oh, brothers and sisters.
[1:34:17] Hallelujah.
[1:34:19] It lightens up. You have erectile
[1:34:22] trouble too. Hemorrhoids that you are
[1:34:25] bothered with. That's right. Isn't it?
[1:34:27] Amen. Just believe. Don't doubt. Just
[1:34:30] believe. Have faith. The Church of
[1:34:34] Living God here in Elkton.
[1:34:37] Just believe. Have faith. Don't doubt
[1:34:44] deep call it unto the deep.
[1:34:48] All right, come lady.
[1:34:51] Now, don't you suffer with arteries too,
[1:34:53] lady? Sitting right there at the end,
[1:34:57] little woman, you have arteries, don't
[1:34:59] you? Would you raise up your hand if
[1:35:03] that's right? That's what's happened.
[1:35:07] This this powerful enemy here. He didn't
[1:35:12] say this weak enemy. He said this
[1:35:15] powerful enemy here.
[1:35:19] Powerful one hand side another hand side
[1:35:23] is screaming for help. Whoa. He is
[1:35:27] screaming for help. Why? Because someone
[1:35:32] who had more power was on the scene. And
[1:35:37] today we came to the same point. Brother
[1:35:41] and sister, we have to recognize who we
[1:35:43] are. And we have to come to the same
[1:35:46] point that this powerful enemy will cry
[1:35:51] for for help.
[1:35:59] In other words, demons are calling to
[1:36:02] it, you see, to answer much of it out
[1:36:06] there in the audience.
[1:36:12] It's moving right through here. Now,
[1:36:14] see, the enemy, the devil that would do
[1:36:19] this horrible thing is moving right
[1:36:22] here. It is crying out, there's more.
[1:36:26] Let's bow our heads just a moment.
[1:36:29] And prophet said, "Come here, oh God,
[1:36:32] author of life,
[1:36:35] giver of every good gift. Send thy
[1:36:38] blessings upon this woman who I bless in
[1:36:42] thy name. And may the spirit get the
[1:36:45] right of way in her life just now.
[1:36:49] And may the enemy leave her in Jesus
[1:36:53] Christ's name.
[1:36:55] I ask it to leave all those in here who
[1:36:59] are suffering with artist at this
[1:37:02] moment. May it come out and go into
[1:37:05] outer darkness.
[1:37:07] I adure thee to go. Now you are healed.
[1:37:12] Now you are healed. The bride of Jesus
[1:37:14] Christ in Elkton, you are healed.
[1:37:17] Brother Ron, you are healed. I am
[1:37:20] healed. Amen. Maybe I have problem with
[1:37:22] my godlather but I am healed.
[1:37:27] Amen. Because he said then in Isaiah 53
[1:37:32] by his stripes we are healed. Amen.
[1:37:37] Brothers and sisters, we have to come to
[1:37:40] the same visions as Isaiah did.
[1:37:44] That was not only for Isaiah because we
[1:37:47] know that the book of Isaiah is a type
[1:37:48] for the whole Bible.
[1:37:51] Amen.
[1:37:53] In every church age,
[1:37:55] not only in the Old Testament,
[1:37:58] but today there's the same the same
[1:38:01] power in the Bible, the same power in
[1:38:04] the presence of the Lord. Oh, brothers
[1:38:07] and sisters.
[1:38:09] Hallelujah.
[1:38:12] Show us the father and it will satisfy
[1:38:15] us. The lady has got trouble. It's on
[1:38:19] her chest. It's the growth.
[1:38:24] It's can cancerous growth. She'd have
[1:38:28] some operation or something for it and
[1:38:31] it is coming back. Growths on her chest
[1:38:36] that will finally kill the woman.
[1:38:39] She's showed
[1:38:41] with death.
[1:38:44] If that's right, lady, wave your hand.
[1:38:47] Now, do you believe now being dead? You
[1:38:51] might know, watch devil power work. This
[1:38:54] woman actually on this here while I am
[1:38:58] still in the spirit.
[1:39:00] It's a tumor sort of a thing. Is that
[1:39:04] right? Right here says another person
[1:39:07] woman sitting right here with a tummer
[1:39:10] tumor. Is that right lady? If it is r
[1:39:14] raise up your hand but besides that
[1:39:17] you've got diabetes also. Raise up your
[1:39:20] hand. See that spirit of darkness
[1:39:24] pulling across here them two demons
[1:39:26] trying to catch one another calling for
[1:39:29] help. But the power of God now above
[1:39:34] every doubt in here has written.
[1:39:39] Oh brothers and sisters,
[1:39:41] who we are, what a power is in church.
[1:39:46] Everything what was in father he poured
[1:39:48] out to his son. Everything what was in
[1:39:52] in in son he poured out into the bride.
[1:39:57] Amen brothers and sisters but we it is
[1:40:02] our I don't know why I can't understand
[1:40:05] it but we as a people as a human beings
[1:40:10] our comfort zone is just to complain how
[1:40:15] weak we are we have nothing or we are
[1:40:18] just message believers people they leave
[1:40:21] us people they leave the message but
[1:40:25] brothers and sisters We have to to go
[1:40:29] out of our comfort zone and to go in
[1:40:35] come in to his comfort zone. Amen. Do
[1:40:39] you remember this story when when uh
[1:40:43] when disciples they were in ship in the
[1:40:47] boat and the waves came
[1:40:51] but the ship was their comfort zone.
[1:40:54] Amen. But that was another comfort zone
[1:40:58] was coming. That was Jesus Christ
[1:41:01] himself.
[1:41:02] Oh, they maybe they try to hold on. You
[1:41:06] know the sheep. Oh, this is our comfort
[1:41:08] zone. No, brothers and sisters, your
[1:41:10] church is not your comfort zone. Your
[1:41:14] seat is not your comfort zone. Jesus
[1:41:17] Christ, his presence tonight, this is
[1:41:21] your comfort zone.
[1:41:24] Come to him. Just come to him.
[1:41:35] And prophet said, "Now do you believe
[1:41:37] the same message? Is God in his people?"
[1:41:41] You say, "God is in you, brother
[1:41:43] Branham. Not only me. It is in her
[1:41:48] and in her too." Whoa. The prophet said
[1:41:52] in her not in him, in her. Yes, sister.
[1:41:56] He is in you. He is in you, sister.
[1:42:00] He is in you sisters
[1:42:03] as he is in brothers because he is still
[1:42:07] the same.
[1:42:08] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:42:11] Here is the Holy Spirit here which is
[1:42:14] infallible.
[1:42:16] There is a power of death in both of
[1:42:18] both of them and them two deaths are
[1:42:21] trying to cooperate together while the
[1:42:24] power of God's revealing it opening it
[1:42:27] up and showing that he loves them women
[1:42:31] or what the power is in real life if you
[1:42:34] can love your children and you can love
[1:42:37] your wife your your husband your parents
[1:42:41] your brother see your sister your pastor
[1:42:44] there is a Power power in a real love,
[1:42:47] brother and sisters.
[1:42:50] Not just to repeat. Oh, we love
[1:42:52] brothers. We love sisters. God bless
[1:42:54] you. God bless you. But we have to have
[1:42:57] real love in us.
[1:43:05] He wants them to be healed. Do you
[1:43:08] believe it?
[1:43:10] He wants you to be healed. Do you
[1:43:14] believe it?
[1:43:16] He wants to give you a sign. Not just a
[1:43:19] sign that pope from the states in on on
[1:43:23] the throne in Vatican. That's good sign.
[1:43:28] But there is another sign for you.
[1:43:32] Behold the virgin will conceive
[1:43:36] and will bear a son. Not just the son
[1:43:39] but son of sons.
[1:43:42] And his name will will be Emmanuel. It
[1:43:47] means God with us.
[1:43:50] Where is God tonight? In his bride, in
[1:43:55] his church. Oh brother and sisters, are
[1:43:59] we part of the same revelation?
[1:44:02] From the time I love this stories
[1:44:07] is something more than stories for me.
[1:44:11] And you know this quote when prophet
[1:44:13] said what's the matter soldier boy you
[1:44:16] know got he stopped the prophet because
[1:44:20] there was a young man so confused in his
[1:44:24] life
[1:44:27] he was almost to commit suicide
[1:44:31] and god he stopped prophet
[1:44:34] and he started to say what's the matter
[1:44:37] sir boy you are not going to commit su
[1:44:40] suicide. The devil's lying to you, boy.
[1:44:45] You've only got a phobia. He's lying to
[1:44:48] you. He will drive you insane if you
[1:44:52] believe him. We cannot believe him. We
[1:44:56] have to believe God.
[1:44:58] And God is here Sunday after Sunday,
[1:45:01] Saturday after Saturday. Wednesday after
[1:45:04] Wednesday.
[1:45:07] He's reminding us that he is with us. Oh
[1:45:11] brother and sister, he has we are part
[1:45:13] of his vision. We are not part of vision
[1:45:16] of brother Ron or brother Robert. We are
[1:45:19] not even part of vision of brother
[1:45:21] Brham. We are part of vision of our
[1:45:25] heavenly father. Hallelujah. Oh praise
[1:45:29] the lord.
[1:45:33] deny him.
[1:45:36] Renounce the devil. I command you in the
[1:45:39] name of Jesus Christ to renounce the
[1:45:42] devil and accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:45:45] healer.
[1:45:47] You'll go back and be a gentleman and a
[1:45:50] real real man. Do you do it? Raise up
[1:45:55] your hands to God and say, "Praise God.
[1:45:58] That's right. Oh, amen." Now go home and
[1:46:02] be well. Very simple. Go home and be
[1:46:06] well.
[1:46:08] Maybe someone will say ah
[1:46:11] this is this is only words. But brothers
[1:46:15] and sisters I believe
[1:46:17] that God's words
[1:46:19] not human
[1:46:21] not words from our carnality our mind
[1:46:26] our intellect but God's words. Amen.
[1:46:30] They have a power real power. Do you
[1:46:34] believe that? And you know I am sure but
[1:46:37] I want just to to tell it when prophet
[1:46:41] said uh acts of the holy spirit
[1:46:47] that was 1954
[1:46:50] I think. Yes brother December. And he
[1:46:55] said
[1:46:57] about pope from the states and he said
[1:47:01] in this time the time will be glorious
[1:47:04] time for church.
[1:47:07] Amen. Glorious time for church.
[1:47:12] That was December 1954.
[1:47:16] Nine nine month later in Chicago was
[1:47:20] born Leon 14.
[1:47:24] That was like a seed.
[1:47:26] He said it. He preached it.
[1:47:31] And he preached also that you are the
[1:47:33] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:35] You are the bride of Jesus Christ. You
[1:47:38] are something more than just a member of
[1:47:40] me church. You have very good pastor. I
[1:47:43] appreciate his friendship really. And I
[1:47:46] am honest. But brothers and sisters,
[1:47:49] your pastor, he had to have his own
[1:47:53] experience.
[1:47:54] You have to have your own experience.
[1:47:58] You cannot entered heaven
[1:48:01] showing experience of your pastor.
[1:48:06] You have to show your experience. What
[1:48:09] is your experience? your revelation
[1:48:12] not not your understanding in
[1:48:14] intellectual understanding but your
[1:48:17] revelation in your heart who you are. Oh
[1:48:21] the the powerful enemy is here. But this
[1:48:25] powerful enemy started to cry out oh
[1:48:28] help me help me. Another power is here.
[1:48:34] Another force is here. Oh more than
[1:48:37] delta force. Another force is here.
[1:48:41] Force from heaven. Can you say amen?
[1:48:44] Amen. Let's stand on your feet. I would
[1:48:46] like to as a musician to instruments,
[1:48:50] brothers and sisters
[1:48:56] when brother Andrew
[1:49:00] he invited me to come
[1:49:04] when I said okay if you want I am you
[1:49:06] know just a simple brother from Poland
[1:49:10] with my simple broken English but he
[1:49:12] said no problem brother don't think
[1:49:14] about it that was the subject that
[1:49:18] already came to my heart. That was maybe
[1:49:22] two months ago, maybe three months ago.
[1:49:25] I don't remember exactly.
[1:49:27] But when we were talking with brother
[1:49:30] Andrew that that came to my heart to
[1:49:34] share with you these thoughts to
[1:49:37] encourage you
[1:49:40] to encourage you brothers and sisters
[1:49:43] because he is here. Jesus Christ is here
[1:49:47] and we are needy people.
[1:49:50] You know sometimes we are so shameshamed
[1:49:53] that oh we are needy people. We are 30
[1:49:57] years in the message. Yes, don't shame
[1:50:00] brother. We are needy people and still
[1:50:03] we will be needy people in these bodies.
[1:50:08] But we have to recognize who we are. Not
[1:50:10] only who is Mr. Putin, who is Donald
[1:50:13] Trump, who is uh Leon 14.
[1:50:18] No brothers and sisters, what is there
[1:50:21] in Middle East? That's good to know
[1:50:23] about it. But all news are about it. But
[1:50:28] there is another Fox News from heaven
[1:50:34] to show you who you are. What is
[1:50:37] happening right now in heaven.
[1:50:42] There is a great battle
[1:50:44] for you and for me
[1:50:48] to help us to take our position.
[1:50:54] So while we are in his presence,
[1:50:56] brothers and sisters,
[1:50:59] just pray together. If you have any need
[1:51:03] in your life, on your heart, maybe your
[1:51:06] children, maybe your parents, maybe your
[1:51:09] brother, your sister, your husband, your
[1:51:12] wife, I don't know, maybe your cousin,
[1:51:15] maybe your friend,
[1:51:17] maybe someone, your neighbor.
[1:51:20] You can raise your hands up. You can

[1:51:26] bless you brother. God bless you
[1:51:28] brother. God bless you sister. We are in

[1:51:32] Just pray together. Just tell him about
[1:51:36] your problem.
[1:51:38] Just tell him that you need him more and
[1:51:40] more. Then you need to come to the
[1:51:44] seventh chapter
[1:51:46] of Isaiah.
[1:51:48] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful
[1:51:52] for your presence tonight.
[1:51:55] Oh Lord, you are still the same,
[1:51:58] yesterday,
[1:52:00] today, and forever.
[1:52:02] Oh, I can feel your presence,
[1:52:06] your sweet presence.
[1:52:09] And you said us through your prophet
[1:52:14] that when you come on the scene
[1:52:16] everything
[1:52:18] something good is on the way.
[1:52:21] So bless my brothers, bless my sisters,
[1:52:25] everyone who was able
[1:52:28] to raise his or her hand.
[1:52:31] Oh, bless them in a special way.
[1:52:34] Bless brother Ron in a special way.
[1:52:38] Oh Lord Jesus,
[1:52:40] just please
[1:52:43] give him more power,
[1:52:46] more power to overcome this powerful
[1:52:50] enemy.
[1:52:52] His name is cancer. But the name of our
[1:52:56] king, Lord of hosts is Jesus Christ. And
[1:53:00] this name is more powerful name. So we
[1:53:04] pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:08] You cancer
[1:53:10] you are defeated enemy.
[1:53:13] You tumor
[1:53:15] you any problem
[1:53:18] you are defeated enemy
[1:53:20] because we are the bride of Jesus
[1:53:23] Christ.
[1:53:24] We came through Isaiah 1, Isaiah 2,
[1:53:28] Isaiah 6 and now we come to Isaiah 7.
[1:53:34] And we recognize
[1:53:37] that Emmanuel
[1:53:39] is in us. Thank you, Father. Thank you
[1:53:43] for this church. I commit everything
[1:53:46] into your hands
[1:53:49] for your glory.
[1:53:51] Hallelujah. Lord, your presence is so
[1:53:54] sweet.
[1:53:56] Oh, bless my brothers and sisters in a
[1:54:00] special way.
[1:54:02] Oh Lord, have you made if I made any
[1:54:06] mistake in my English, please forgive
[1:54:08] me.
[1:54:10] But I want to be focused only
[1:54:14] on your language of the word of revealed
[1:54:18] word. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:54:22] commit everything into your hands. Amen.
[1:54:26] Amen. And brothers and sisters, that was
[1:54:29] Isaiah 7. Then was Isaiah 53, Isaiah 66.
[1:54:36] And now we are in in Luke chapter 4.
[1:54:41] And he Jesus Christ, he came. You know
[1:54:45] the fruit of what God said through
[1:54:49] Isaiah mouth
[1:54:51] in seventh chapter that was word
[1:54:55] manifested in flesh.
[1:54:57] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:55:01] been brought up. And as his custom was,
[1:55:04] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:55:06] Sabbath day and stood up for to read.
[1:55:11] And there was delivered unto him the
[1:55:13] book of the prophet Isaiah.
[1:55:15] And when he had opened the book, he
[1:55:18] found the place where it was written,
[1:55:21] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me."
[1:55:25] because he had anointed me to preach the
[1:55:27] gospel to the poor. He had sent me to
[1:55:31] heal the brokenhearted,
[1:55:33] to preach deliverance to captives and
[1:55:36] recovering of sight,
[1:55:39] to the blind, to set at liberty them
[1:55:43] that are bruised, to preach the
[1:55:46] acceptable year of the Lord.
[1:55:49] And he closed the book. And he gave it
[1:55:52] again to the minister, and sat down. And
[1:55:56] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:55:59] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[1:56:03] began to say unto them, "This day is
[1:56:08] this scripture
[1:56:10] fulfilled in your ears."
[1:56:14] And he began.
[1:56:17] and the bride
[1:56:20] his continuation
[1:56:23] of of those what he be began.
[1:56:27] So now you brother, you sister, you can
[1:56:31] say this day, this scripture
[1:56:36] is f fulfilled
[1:56:38] in our eyes. When he said about the
[1:56:41] bride
[1:56:43] and she will be we without wrinkle
[1:56:47] without spot.
[1:56:50] Can you say
[1:56:53] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:56:58] in me? In me.
[1:57:01] Brothers and sisters, when he said that
[1:57:05] they will come and the bride will be
[1:57:08] raptured to meet him in the air, can you
[1:57:13] say tonight,
[1:57:15] this day, this scripture is already
[1:57:19] fulfilled in me?
[1:57:22] Because the rapture is not only the the
[1:57:25] event in the future. The rapture is the
[1:57:29] person
[1:57:30] of Jesus Christ and he is here. Whatever
[1:57:35] is your problem
[1:57:37] while we are in his presence, you can
[1:57:40] touch him. You can touch him. You can
[1:57:43] receive something from him because he is
[1:57:46] still the same yesterday,
[1:57:49] today
[1:57:51] and forever.
[1:57:53] Oh brother and sisters,

[1:57:59] life? God's mercy rewrote my life. Oh

[1:58:21] behold the virgin will conceive and bear
[1:58:25] a son
[1:58:27] and they will call him his name
[1:58:30] Emmanuel.
