[45:50] amen so good to be in the house of the
[45:52] lord
[45:53] i tell you i surely enjoyed brother
[45:55] william last night
[45:57] and i believe
[45:58] when he said
[46:00] that about that force
[46:03] about broke down the building i believe
[46:06] i asked him i said you have somebody
[46:08] outside planting that
[46:10] that lightning clap like it did
[46:13] i tell you what we was thankful for the
[46:15] rain last night
[46:16] on the inside of here and on the outside
[46:19] amen so we're just claiming more rain on
[46:22] the inside this morning are we
[46:25] amen
[46:27] thank you musicians
[46:29] this morning i'd like to
[46:30] start off with a a quote
[46:33] brother branham
[46:35] 1949 the deity of jesus christ
[46:40] and it says
[46:42] but that is god
[46:43] the creator living in you
[46:46] and giving you
[46:47] all the powers
[46:49] do y'all believe that this morning that
[46:51] you have those same powers
[46:53] and you're
[46:54] in possession of anything that he had
[46:59] so is it in you to abstain from evil to
[47:02] do good
[47:03] to shun the evil to flee to
[47:05] righteousness to turn away from
[47:08] temptation
[47:09] all malice hatred strife envy and so
[47:13] forth
[47:14] to turn away from it
[47:16] for that will take him
[47:18] from your heart
[47:20] if you will receive him embrace him and
[47:23] love him
[47:24] and hold him in your heart and love him
[47:27] i can tell you the church together
[47:30] and that kind of a power has the power
[47:33] to bind the heavens
[47:35] heal the sick
[47:37] open the eyes of the blind the dumb to
[47:40] speak the deaf to hear
[47:42] the cripples walk the blind to see
[47:45] why is that
[47:47] it's recognizing
[47:49] power of the almighty god
[47:51] in your heart
[47:53] there he is
[47:54] the deity
[47:56] do you claim that power this morning
[47:58] the same power that he has
[48:01] we have
[48:03] we're sons and daughters of god with
[48:04] that same power
[48:06] amen
[48:08] i'd like to go to first peter
[48:10] chapter 5 and verse 7 this morning
[48:14] and it says
[48:16] casting all your care upon him
[48:22] for he careth for you
[48:25] be sober be diligent
[48:28] because your adversary the devil
[48:31] is as a roaring lion
[48:33] walking about
[48:35] seeking whom he may devour
[48:38] he's a roaring lion roaming to and fro
[48:40] amen
[48:42] seeking whom he may devour
[48:46] i'd like to turn over to first john
[48:48] 4 and verse 4 this morning if they could
[48:51] put it on the board for us
[48:55] and let's just read this together this
[48:57] morning
[48:59] first john 4
[49:03] and verse 4
[49:05] ye are of god
[49:07] little children
[49:08] and have overcome them
[49:11] because greater is he
[49:13] that is in you
[49:15] than he that is in the world
[49:18] let's say that again because greater is
[49:21] he that is in you
[49:23] than he that is in the world
[49:26] amen you can have your seats this
[49:28] morning
[49:39] amen we believe that don't we
[49:41] we believe that that power that he has
[49:44] is greater than this old world
[49:47] this morning i'd like to speak on
[49:49] enforcing the claim
[49:53] we're going to enforce a claim this
[49:54] morning so y'all just bear with us we're
[49:58] going to have a good time i believe
[50:00] amen
[50:01] so to begin that i'd like to start over
[50:03] in nehemiah and nehemiah chapter 1 is
[50:06] where we begin at this morning
[50:09] and nehemiah
[50:11] was the one that had built the wall and
[50:13] i've spoke on this before
[50:15] but i'd like to take it in a different
[50:17] route this morning
[50:19] as what he had did
[50:21] to rebuild the wall to establish
[50:24] boundaries
[50:25] and i'd like to take that this morning
[50:27] as
[50:28] what he restored
[50:29] so nehemiah as he was in
[50:32] sushan the palace
[50:34] he had certain brothers that had come to
[50:36] him
[50:38] and had told them about how that the
[50:41] wall had been torn down
[50:43] and how that they could not rebuild it
[50:45] and so this made nehemiah
[50:48] very torn in his heart and because that
[50:50] was his people
[50:52] and they were crying out to the lord and
[50:54] and seeking help so they come to
[50:56] nehemiah
[50:58] and nehemiah went into prayer and i'd
[51:00] like to read in verse 5
[51:02] of chapter 1 and nehemiah
[51:05] and nehemiah said i beseech thee o lord
[51:09] god of heaven the great and terrible god
[51:12] that keepeth the covenant
[51:14] and the mercy for them that love him and
[51:17] observe his commandments
[51:19] now he's talking to the lord and he said
[51:22] let thine ear now be attentive and then
[51:25] eyes be opened that thou mayest hear my
[51:27] prayer
[51:29] thy servant
[51:30] which i pray before thee now day and
[51:33] night for the children of israel thy
[51:35] servants
[51:36] and confess the sins of the children of
[51:39] israel
[51:40] see now they had been
[51:42] promised these lands
[51:44] but they didn't obey the commandments
[51:48] because of this which we have sinned
[51:51] against thee
[51:53] both i
[51:54] my father's
[51:56] house have sinned
[51:57] we have dealt very corruptly against
[52:00] thee and have not kept the commandments
[52:02] nor the statues nor the judgments which
[52:04] thou command us thy servant moses
[52:07] remember i beseech thee
[52:10] the word that thou command us thy
[52:12] servant moses saying now he's going to
[52:15] start quoting
[52:16] what god said unto moses
[52:18] he's going to quote quote god's words
[52:21] back to him here
[52:22] if you transgress
[52:24] i will scatter you abroad among the
[52:27] nations but if you turn unto me and keep
[52:30] my commandments and do them
[52:33] though there were though there
[52:36] were of you cast out unto the uttermost
[52:39] part of heaven
[52:40] yet i will gather them from thence
[52:43] and i will bring them into a place that
[52:46] i have chosen to set my name there
[52:49] now nehemiah started quoting that word
[52:52] that god had given them
[52:54] back unto god
[52:55] as brother william was saying last night
[52:57] god loves praises
[53:00] god established the angels to have
[53:01] praises and worship so god loves hearing
[53:04] his word back to him and so that's what
[53:06] caught the the ear of god
[53:09] when he started quoting the word back to
[53:11] him
[53:13] and so the lord was able to move upon
[53:15] the heart of the king there
[53:18] and give
[53:19] nehemiah everything that he had needed
[53:21] of to rebuild the wall
[53:23] he even sent horsemen and troops and
[53:25] people with him to guide the way to get
[53:27] to where he needed to go
[53:30] and i believe in in this time in this
[53:32] day and age that there are people that
[53:34] around us
[53:35] christians and message believers that
[53:37] will actually
[53:38] in this day and time help you out
[53:41] when you see that there's no other way
[53:43] god will set somebody there to help you
[53:45] out
[53:46] in your situations of life
[53:49] so nehemiah
[53:50] he went to to establish these boundaries
[53:54] now i'm not going to brother andrew he
[53:55] preached on breaking down barriers now
[53:58] i'm not trying to build them back up
[53:59] this morning but
[54:01] but we're going to
[54:03] to claim those boundaries back that the
[54:06] devil tries to take from you
[54:08] the devil will continue to push and push
[54:11] and push
[54:12] and tear down everything that you've
[54:14] tried to to establish
[54:17] so nehemiah was able to
[54:19] to help restore
[54:21] so he came and he restored and let's see
[54:23] what restore means says to give back
[54:27] to return
[54:28] to put back to bring back into existence
[54:31] or use
[54:32] it was not usable so nehemiah was able
[54:35] to help restore that to put back
[54:39] again in possession of something
[54:43] so as he's restoring those walls he's
[54:45] starting to build the confidence of the
[54:47] people within those walls now it took
[54:49] him a little bit
[54:51] but before long
[54:53] amongst themselves they were able to
[54:55] withstand the enemy
[54:57] and build that wall
[54:59] they started to build that barrier
[55:01] again now the devil will will let you
[55:03] start on something but he don't like it
[55:05] when you you get almost finished so
[55:08] he'll start to send an army against you
[55:10] and so what happened was
[55:12] sam balot the hornet knight and tobiath
[55:14] and gisham
[55:16] they all met together and said
[55:18] are we going to allow them to establish
[55:20] this
[55:22] they're going against our kingdom
[55:25] and that's exactly what the devil will
[55:26] do they'll conference amongst themselves
[55:28] and say we need to send somebody down
[55:30] here to destroy this
[55:32] so they continue to continue to start
[55:34] break down those barriers
[55:37] but before long
[55:39] nehemiah and the children there was able
[55:42] to establish that
[55:44] and now they wanted to meet again with
[55:47] nehemiah once the walls and everything
[55:49] was established they wanted to meet with
[55:52] him
[55:53] and say hey listen you know maybe this
[55:55] was a better idea if we helped you out
[55:57] on this
[55:58] you know maybe we can
[56:00] you know make an agreement and that's
[56:02] exactly what the devil will do he'll try
[56:04] to make an agreement with you
[56:06] he'll try to make a pact
[56:09] but you have to drive down the stake and
[56:11] say no more satan
[56:14] from this time on no more
[56:16] amen
[56:18] so they established their property
[56:19] markers so i'd like to go to that like
[56:21] driving down a stake
[56:23] and putting property markers on
[56:26] now
[56:26] my granddaddy had uh he had bought a
[56:29] piece of land from a neighbor one time
[56:32] and so
[56:34] he had i think it was mr shoemate
[56:37] come out and surveyed the land
[56:40] and so they put the markers there and
[56:43] and they're corner markers
[56:45] now
[56:46] he also had another neighbor that didn't
[56:48] care for the markers where they were
[56:50] placed at
[56:51] but now that surveyor knew exactly where
[56:54] they were
[56:55] and he put
[56:56] the post right where it was supposed to
[56:58] be
[56:59] so granddaddy comes along and finds his
[57:01] marker moved
[57:03] he said well now i don't think that
[57:05] that's exactly where that thing was
[57:09] so he had mr shoemake come out i think
[57:11] it was maybe two or three times to
[57:13] resurvey this place
[57:16] but on that last time
[57:18] grinded he said i'm gonna fix this issue
[57:21] he had all of us boys and thomas and us
[57:23] we dug a hole and we drove a stake i
[57:27] believe it was 10 foot long down in the
[57:28] ground
[57:30] and we poured concrete all the way
[57:32] around that state
[57:36] that steak was never moved again
[57:40] and that's exactly what you have to do
[57:43] to the devil
[57:45] he'll try to push that boundary marker
[57:47] and move it and say that ain't where it
[57:48] was supposed to be you're not in the
[57:50] place where you need to be
[57:52] but you drive that stake
[57:54] you drive it in the ground
[57:57] and you see minute with the word of the
[57:59] lord
[58:00] and say satan
[58:02] no more you're gonna be moving those
[58:04] boundary markers
[58:06] now those markers are set there for a
[58:08] reason
[58:09] now on my land
[58:11] i joined to the national park
[58:14] and on a rock attaching to my land is is
[58:17] a park marker
[58:19] now that marker is there to show exactly
[58:23] where that line is
[58:25] because
[58:26] they've put paint on the trees and stuff
[58:28] and they've tried to create little marks
[58:31] on the signs
[58:32] but now that mark in that rock
[58:35] won't move
[58:36] unless it's dug all the way up and then
[58:39] moved
[58:40] so they can come back to that rock
[58:43] and they can look at that rock and they
[58:44] can pinpoint it with latitude and
[58:46] longitude and say that's exactly where
[58:48] it's been the whole time
[58:51] and that's what you can do also
[58:53] when you drive that stake down and you
[58:56] can go back to that stake and you go
[58:58] that's exactly where it's been the whole
[59:00] time
[59:00] it's not been moved satan you've pressed
[59:03] it but
[59:05] no more
[59:06] i have sealed that mark
[59:09] there's benchmarks around the world
[59:12] down at the beach where we go
[59:14] at a house in the middle of the yard
[59:18] there is a marker there now that is
[59:20] called a bench marker a latitude and
[59:22] longitude bench marker to where that if
[59:25] the storms of life ever come
[59:27] natural natural storms now
[59:30] that barrier that concrete post is dug
[59:34] so deep in the ground
[59:36] that it won't move
[59:38] now there's storms of life that comes
[59:41] and just as i'm saying the devil comes
[59:43] and tries to press it
[59:45] no matter how how much the wind blows no
[59:48] matter how hard satan will blow against
[59:50] you and huff and puff
[59:53] won't be moved
[59:57] so speaking of property
[59:59] let's purchase a property this morning
[1:00:02] abraham purchased a property
[1:00:05] abraham
[1:00:07] decided
[1:00:09] excuse me he didn't decide
[1:00:12] but his wife sarah had passed away
[1:00:15] and he knew
[1:00:17] that he wanted to bury her
[1:00:19] in macpilla
[1:00:21] but he wanted to buy this property
[1:00:24] now this property
[1:00:26] was where his enemy and other people had
[1:00:30] been at so he come to him and he said
[1:00:33] i want to buy this property
[1:00:35] they said
[1:00:36] we see you're dead
[1:00:38] abraham
[1:00:39] go bury him
[1:00:41] he said no
[1:00:42] no i'm not just going to go bury them
[1:00:45] i want to buy this property
[1:00:48] i want to buy this property they said
[1:00:50] abraham you don't understand
[1:00:53] go bury your dead
[1:00:54] just just bury him
[1:00:56] he said no i don't want to just bury him
[1:00:58] out of my sight
[1:01:00] he said i want to purchase this property
[1:01:04] because he knew what laid on the inside
[1:01:06] of that property
[1:01:08] he knew the promise that was there
[1:01:11] so before long he met with efren and
[1:01:13] everyone said please just go bury your
[1:01:15] dead
[1:01:16] he said i'm going to pay you for this
[1:01:18] property
[1:01:20] what's it worth
[1:01:22] and he threw out a number 400 400
[1:01:25] shekels
[1:01:26] so before all the children there before
[1:01:29] efren and them all for the land of
[1:01:30] macpilla
[1:01:32] he paid the price for that property all
[1:01:35] the way back
[1:01:36] he cleared it to where that property was
[1:01:39] paid
[1:01:40] now it was expensive piece of property
[1:01:43] so what abraham did was
[1:01:46] he said
[1:01:47] from the cave
[1:01:49] to the field
[1:01:50] to the trees
[1:01:52] we're gonna make sure that property
[1:01:55] because i've bought this thing
[1:01:57] now i don't know what kind of people
[1:01:59] they will be in a hundred years from now
[1:02:01] but i know what's going to happen on
[1:02:03] this property at some point
[1:02:05] he said so i'm going to make sure
[1:02:07] of the lines of this property
[1:02:10] he established and made sure and he
[1:02:13] buried sarah there
[1:02:15] because he had a promise
[1:02:18] as brother branham would say it like
[1:02:19] this said abraham said if job's going to
[1:02:22] see him i'm going to be buried right
[1:02:25] there with him
[1:02:26] so i can see him too i'll bury sarah
[1:02:29] right there and bury them all there for
[1:02:32] they knowed that the first fruits of the
[1:02:35] resurrection was coming was not coming
[1:02:37] out of egypt it was coming out of
[1:02:39] palestine
[1:02:41] so they was going to be in that
[1:02:42] resurrection
[1:02:43] that's why the price was paid for that
[1:02:45] piece of ground
[1:02:47] and the reason is today
[1:02:49] i say for all your follic and the world
[1:02:52] that have all the follicle in the world
[1:02:54] you want
[1:02:55] those that are dead in christ
[1:02:58] will god bring forth in his resurrection
[1:03:01] so bury me in jesus christ for i know
[1:03:04] where my resurrection is coming from
[1:03:07] call me what you want
[1:03:09] call me a holy roller don't make any
[1:03:11] difference to me i'm buried in christ
[1:03:14] hidden away from this whole world
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:18] is that where you're buried at
[1:03:19] is that where you're established at
[1:03:22] bury me in christ
[1:03:26] bury me so deep in christ that the world
[1:03:28] can't even see me
[1:03:31] abraham made sure of it that's what you
[1:03:33] have to make sure of it
[1:03:35] be buried in christ
[1:03:37] amen brother tim pruitt buried sister
[1:03:40] karen pruitt just the other day
[1:03:42] now he didn't buy just a piece of
[1:03:44] property he buried her in christ
[1:03:47] he buried her where he knew
[1:03:50] she'd be resurrected again and before
[1:03:52] the time that she died she was buried in
[1:03:55] christ
[1:03:56] and he knew within his heart one of
[1:03:58] these days me and sister karen
[1:04:01] she's going to come up out of that
[1:04:02] ground
[1:04:03] that resurrection power as i'm buried in
[1:04:06] christ
[1:04:07] she's buried in christ so are you buried
[1:04:10] in christ
[1:04:11] that's where we want to be we want to
[1:04:12] claim that this morning
[1:04:14] claim that claim that piece of property
[1:04:17] claim that you're buried in christ don't
[1:04:19] just let let the world pass by and
[1:04:22] you just be going along with what the
[1:04:24] world would want you be buried in him
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:28] it's enforcing claims
[1:04:30] that's what i'm preaching on this
[1:04:32] morning enforcing claims
[1:04:34] driving down stakes
[1:04:38] staking the claim involves first the
[1:04:40] discovery of a valuable mineral
[1:04:43] or in the qualities
[1:04:45] that a prudent man
[1:04:48] would invest the time and expense to
[1:04:50] recovery
[1:04:54] what's laying on the inside of you
[1:04:56] god seen you from the foundation of the
[1:04:59] world
[1:05:01] he was a prudent man and he said
[1:05:04] that right there
[1:05:05] he was a wise man he said that right
[1:05:07] there what's laying on the inside of
[1:05:09] there
[1:05:10] i can redeem that
[1:05:12] i'm going to drive my stake right there
[1:05:14] because i know upon this rock i'll build
[1:05:17] my church
[1:05:18] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:05:21] against them amen
[1:05:23] drive down the stake
[1:05:25] but now there's also another type of
[1:05:27] claim
[1:05:28] it's called claim jumping
[1:05:31] and that's what the devil would like to
[1:05:32] do is do a little claim jumping this
[1:05:34] morning and start to claim you for his
[1:05:36] own
[1:05:38] and what is it a claim jump is a dispute
[1:05:40] of one party
[1:05:42] a jumping of a claim attempts to seize
[1:05:44] land on which another party has already
[1:05:47] laid claim and it is known as claim
[1:05:50] jumping
[1:05:52] jesus said it like this in john 10 verse
[1:05:55] 7 says verily verily i say unto you
[1:05:58] i am the door of the sheep
[1:06:01] and all that in earth came before me
[1:06:04] and all that ever came before me are
[1:06:07] thieves and robbers but the sheep did
[1:06:09] not hear them
[1:06:11] says i am the door
[1:06:13] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[1:06:16] saved and shall go in and out and find
[1:06:19] pasture
[1:06:20] the thief cometh not but to steal to
[1:06:23] kill and destroy
[1:06:25] and i am come that might they might have
[1:06:28] life and they might have it more
[1:06:30] abundantly i am a good shepherd i am the
[1:06:34] good shepherd that giveth his life for
[1:06:36] his sheep
[1:06:38] he is the door to the sheepfold that
[1:06:40] layeth down his life
[1:06:42] now that devil might try to claim jump
[1:06:44] and jump whatever
[1:06:46] that jesus did
[1:06:48] but he said you got to come through me
[1:06:51] if you don't come through me you're a
[1:06:52] thief and a robber
[1:06:58] amen we see
[1:07:01] how that
[1:07:02] joshua and caleb
[1:07:06] as brother william was speaking last
[1:07:07] night he said that they had
[1:07:10] they had said for 40 days there
[1:07:12] couldn't claim it you know they went
[1:07:14] into the land the spies went into the
[1:07:16] land and joshua and cable went on over
[1:07:18] there and they was looking and they said
[1:07:20] it's a good land
[1:07:21] we can take this land yeah there might
[1:07:23] be giants in this land but we can claim
[1:07:25] this land
[1:07:27] joshua looked on over at caleb he said
[1:07:29] why don't we just go on down there
[1:07:30] because we know the rest of them bunch
[1:07:32] of backsliders
[1:07:36] sometimes you're going to have to walk
[1:07:37] alone
[1:07:38] sometimes you know what god has gave you
[1:07:40] in possession and you know that there's
[1:07:42] other people that's trying to steal what
[1:07:44] you've been promised and that's exactly
[1:07:46] what happened was
[1:07:48] is it was stolen from them for that 40
[1:07:51] years
[1:07:52] but after that
[1:07:54] it was restored to joshua
[1:07:58] joshua
[1:07:59] was spoken to by the lord
[1:08:02] and the lord said unto him
[1:08:04] wherever the place of the souls of your
[1:08:06] feet shall trod
[1:08:08] i'm going to give it to you i'm going to
[1:08:10] give it to you
[1:08:12] can you claim that this morning can you
[1:08:14] claim that wherever the souls of my feet
[1:08:16] shall trod god's given me that land
[1:08:19] god has already given me that promise
[1:08:21] this morning
[1:08:22] that i'm going to take this land because
[1:08:24] i said before it was a good land it was
[1:08:27] a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:08:31] we claim that land
[1:08:34] we stake claim to it we enforce the
[1:08:37] claims
[1:08:40] now being a police officer
[1:08:42] there's certain
[1:08:44] claims that come or cases that
[1:08:47] that would come
[1:08:49] and some of the cases
[1:08:51] would be a false false case
[1:08:55] and some of them
[1:08:57] i could take
[1:08:58] before the magistrate
[1:09:00] and without a shadow of a doubt
[1:09:03] i knew that the case was justifiable
[1:09:07] and that's what the lord has done
[1:09:09] he's seen that it was a just cause
[1:09:11] a just case
[1:09:13] to be able to bring it
[1:09:18] we must press that case
[1:09:23] we must lay hold on it
[1:09:26] now many times there's
[1:09:28] there's what you call squatters on the
[1:09:29] land
[1:09:31] how many ever heard of a
[1:09:32] squatter amen squatters
[1:09:36] even have rights
[1:09:38] hard to believe but they have rights
[1:09:41] if squatters
[1:09:42] is on your land for over 30 days
[1:09:45] they have established a residence there
[1:09:50] so it's time to start
[1:09:52] seeing what you can do with a squatter
[1:09:55] now there's also a different type of
[1:09:57] thing it's called trespassing
[1:09:59] and us hunters know what trespassing is
[1:10:02] and you know that on the other side of
[1:10:04] those trespassing signs about 20 yards
[1:10:07] is the best hunting there is
[1:10:09] it's beautiful oak trees
[1:10:12] dropping acorns there's little dips and
[1:10:14] streams and it's so beautiful
[1:10:17] that's what trespassers see
[1:10:19] on the other side
[1:10:21] and that's what the devil has seen
[1:10:24] when god established a trust no
[1:10:26] trespassing here
[1:10:28] he said but it looks so good i think i
[1:10:30] can do something with that
[1:10:32] no trespassing
[1:10:34] get off the land
[1:10:36] trespassing involves in property
[1:10:38] unlawfully
[1:10:40] entering for the movement
[1:10:43] for the intention of just lingering
[1:10:45] just just for a little bit you know it
[1:10:47] won't well i won't be here long just for
[1:10:49] a little bit
[1:10:50] but just a little bit and that devil
[1:10:52] will destroy you
[1:10:54] what's the difference between
[1:10:56] trespassing and squatting
[1:10:59] the technical type of is a trespasser
[1:11:03] but squatters take it one step further
[1:11:07] and they have the intention of taking
[1:11:09] ownership
[1:11:10] and claim on the property and making
[1:11:12] their property
[1:11:14] a permanent residence
[1:11:17] brother branham said it like this it
[1:11:19] says brother we need some christians not
[1:11:21] jellyfish but with the backbone that'll
[1:11:24] stand stand for your god-given rights
[1:11:28] brother wayne lawson was preaching the
[1:11:30] other day up in canada and he said i
[1:11:32] hear a lot of people
[1:11:34] what they're standing against but i want
[1:11:36] to know what you're standing for
[1:11:39] amen
[1:11:40] i hear a lot of what you're standing
[1:11:42] against
[1:11:43] you can stand against a lot of things
[1:11:45] but tell me what you're standing for
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:49] said stand for your god-given rights
[1:11:51] christ died for them don't be don't be
[1:11:55] pushed around we got an inheritance our
[1:11:58] inheritance belongs to us
[1:12:00] it's your privilege to have anything
[1:12:02] that you inherited through accepting
[1:12:05] jesus christ and dying to yourself
[1:12:08] satan said well i'll tell you what i'm
[1:12:11] going to do
[1:12:12] no you ain't going to tell me nothing
[1:12:15] and that's the way you got to talk to
[1:12:16] him
[1:12:17] said i know my position in christ
[1:12:20] and you just might as well get away
[1:12:23] i ain't listening to you no more i got
[1:12:26] an inheritance that's the way you got to
[1:12:28] talk to old satan
[1:12:30] said we got the title deed
[1:12:33] to it it's the abstract goes all the way
[1:12:35] back to calvary the day of pentecost
[1:12:38] when he said this promise is unto you
[1:12:41] and your children and them as many as
[1:12:43] the lord thy god shall call it's an
[1:12:45] abstract deed
[1:12:47] cleared
[1:12:48] all the way back to pentecost how far
[1:12:50] does it go back
[1:12:52] how many is it for as many as the lord
[1:12:55] thy god shall call
[1:12:57] if the lord calls you he's given you an
[1:13:00] abstract title deed all the way back and
[1:13:03] the blood of jesus christ is just as
[1:13:06] good as it had been 10 minutes ago shed
[1:13:09] every believer
[1:13:11] it's your profession
[1:13:13] profession
[1:13:15] you're just scared to use your rights
[1:13:18] don't be scared to use the rights don't
[1:13:20] be scared to use the blood of jesus
[1:13:22] christ that was shed there because you
[1:13:24] have been inherited that
[1:13:26] the abstract title deed it has been
[1:13:29] wiped all the way clean and he paid it
[1:13:31] all for you
[1:13:33] now you can go home and
[1:13:36] and he's saying here
[1:13:38] you go home and
[1:13:39] and you'll see a bunch of drunks that's
[1:13:41] coming to your house
[1:13:43] and they're having a big old party
[1:13:44] whooping and hollering and
[1:13:47] and you say no now this is my house
[1:13:50] and they'll look at you and they'll say
[1:13:51] now that was this house made for humans
[1:13:55] yes yes it was made for humans well
[1:13:58] well we're humans and and we're going to
[1:14:00] live here
[1:14:02] now
[1:14:03] see
[1:14:05] you have the right
[1:14:07] because you can show ownership
[1:14:09] of the house
[1:14:11] and you can call the law and you can say
[1:14:15] now listen
[1:14:16] these guys are trespassing
[1:14:19] and probably most of us in here if
[1:14:21] somebody's coming to your house
[1:14:23] you don't have to call the law
[1:14:26] i had a situation one time where i had a
[1:14:28] couple gentlemen
[1:14:30] i'll say gentlemen
[1:14:32] continued to park on my property
[1:14:36] so i called the law
[1:14:39] and before the law would get there
[1:14:40] they'd leave
[1:14:42] so this happened two or three times and
[1:14:45] i'd call the law and they'd leave
[1:14:48] so i called the law one night
[1:14:50] and i said now
[1:14:52] now this is about the third or fourth
[1:14:53] time that i've called y'all
[1:14:55] now either y'all can show up or you
[1:14:58] don't have to but i'm going out there to
[1:15:00] take care of it
[1:15:02] the law showed up in about 10 minutes
[1:15:05] they were still there
[1:15:07] and needless to say they never came back
[1:15:10] because the officer told them of my
[1:15:13] intentions
[1:15:16] don't come back
[1:15:18] and that's what you have to do
[1:15:20] is make the devil aware of your
[1:15:22] intentions
[1:15:24] he'll tell you how big he is but you
[1:15:26] just tell him devil my god's bigger
[1:15:35] give him your attentions tonight
[1:15:38] brother branham says it like this
[1:15:40] and says we got the title to this
[1:15:42] property it's ours that's right
[1:15:46] they all
[1:15:47] and we got an attorney sitting in glory
[1:15:49] with the blood sacrifice of his own life
[1:15:52] not only that but we got an fbi agent
[1:15:55] the holy spirit
[1:15:57] god's great detective
[1:15:59] just leave the blood there and serve
[1:16:02] warrant on him and watch the holy ghost
[1:16:04] put him out
[1:16:07] amen aren't you glad of that let's serve
[1:16:08] warren on the devil this morning
[1:16:11] because we got the right
[1:16:13] we've got the right right here and we're
[1:16:15] serving war on you today
[1:16:17] we got the just cause amen
[1:16:20] nehemiah had a just cause he had the
[1:16:23] case to be able to establish boundaries
[1:16:25] abraham said it
[1:16:27] set the cause he said for sure this
[1:16:29] property is mine now
[1:16:31] christ jesus seen us and said you're a
[1:16:34] just cause
[1:16:35] you're worth going after aren't you glad
[1:16:37] of that this morning
[1:16:39] our pastor is worth going after laying
[1:16:42] claim upon our pastor this morning we're
[1:16:44] claiming it we're believing it
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:48] [Applause]
[1:16:49] your worship
[1:16:50] is worth a just cause to claim it your
[1:16:53] children is worth a just cause to claim
[1:16:56] it your joy is worth a just close to
[1:16:58] claim it so you claim it this morning
[1:17:01] you drive down that stake and you bury
[1:17:03] that thing and i'd say i'm going to
[1:17:04] celebrate it with concrete right here
[1:17:06] say i've laid claim on this this morning
[1:17:09] christ jesus has given me the just cause
[1:17:11] to lay claim on it this morning because
[1:17:14] what he's given me is mine it's not
[1:17:16] yours satan it's mine this morning
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:22] the rapture is ours
[1:17:24] it's ours
[1:17:26] nobody else it it's ours you got to
[1:17:28] establish that for yourself
[1:17:31] as brother william said last night
[1:17:33] brother branham jesus christ brother
[1:17:34] branham would come just for that one
[1:17:37] you got to claim it as if you're just
[1:17:39] that one
[1:17:40] just that one in virginia i'm going the
[1:17:42] rapture is mine i'm claiming it this
[1:17:45] morning
[1:17:47] see david said he had a just cause
[1:17:50] when all of his brothers and everybody
[1:17:52] was mocking him
[1:17:53] he said no i got a cause
[1:17:55] when that uncircumcised philistines down
[1:17:58] there in that valley hollering out
[1:18:00] making fun of my god
[1:18:04] i can't just sit up here
[1:18:06] i'm going down there
[1:18:08] and god went with david
[1:18:11] and he put more spin rate on that rock
[1:18:13] better than even clinton kershaw has on
[1:18:15] a curveball
[1:18:17] hey listen he had a just calls that
[1:18:19] morning
[1:18:20] and he looked back and he said
[1:18:22] where's your brother's at
[1:18:24] i'm claiming it
[1:18:26] i'm claiming he had that just cause
[1:18:28] joshua and caleb had a just cause
[1:18:31] amen they claimed that land
[1:18:34] they said we can take that land
[1:18:36] believe it this morning
[1:18:39] like what brother branham said he said
[1:18:42] the longfellow once said
[1:18:44] the way to succeed is to find the worthy
[1:18:46] cause
[1:18:48] that's being talked about a worthy cause
[1:18:50] that's being talked about and then you
[1:18:52] hold on to it
[1:18:54] something that's being talked about
[1:18:57] turned down by science is worth to lay
[1:18:59] hold on it
[1:19:01] signs will turn down this message
[1:19:05] but we know it's got a worthy cause
[1:19:08] he said do you know in 1872 the medical
[1:19:11] association of the united states turned
[1:19:14] down bathtubs
[1:19:16] and they said they are absolutely
[1:19:17] unsanitary
[1:19:19] and they will scatter diseases
[1:19:21] well maybe that's what some people has
[1:19:23] done today is stop bathing
[1:19:26] and all these diseases is coming back
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:32] wash your hands you filthy sinners
[1:19:36] that's scriptural
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:43] he said in this old-fashioned gospel is
[1:19:45] what we're talking about
[1:19:47] washed in the blood of the lamb and it
[1:19:49] seemed old-fashioned
[1:19:51] but they'll you have to come to it
[1:19:53] sooner or later it's the worthy cause
[1:19:56] hold on to it with all you got it's that
[1:19:59] blood washed way that cleans a man up
[1:20:03] not going out here drinking and smoking
[1:20:05] and rallying around and calling
[1:20:07] themselves a bunch of christians because
[1:20:09] they belong to some church
[1:20:11] it's that clean
[1:20:13] unadulterated
[1:20:14] holy spirit a human life that reflects
[1:20:17] jesus christ and his son of god
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:22] hey man let it's that blood
[1:20:24] that blood that has cleansed us
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:42] amen it's that blood that has cleansed
[1:20:45] it was a worthy cause
[1:20:48] yes this world might say it's
[1:20:49] old-fashioned
[1:20:51] holy ghost
[1:20:53] it's just some demonized thing
[1:20:55] this ain't spiritualism we're not we're
[1:20:56] not praying to some spirit some some old
[1:20:59] grave and polishing some old school like
[1:21:01] brother william was saying last night
[1:21:03] this ain't spiritualism
[1:21:05] because we're praying to a real god
[1:21:08] amen we're not praying to some spirit
[1:21:10] somewhere
[1:21:11] as brother as brother branham told that
[1:21:13] one guy who said said now now who do you
[1:21:16] pray to well
[1:21:17] now does he have to be dead or alive
[1:21:20] because the way that they become a saint
[1:21:22] is after they're dead and then you pray
[1:21:24] to them well what happened before when
[1:21:26] they was living was it not worth
[1:21:28] praising him then
[1:21:29] amen we're praying to a living god
[1:21:33] amen
[1:21:34] let's go to mark 16. that's the church
[1:21:36] in action right there
[1:21:38] the church in action we're praying to a
[1:21:40] living god because mary magdalene
[1:21:43] and them
[1:21:44] had went to the tomb and they seen that
[1:21:46] the stoners rode away
[1:21:50] and there he came to the others
[1:21:52] and he gave them this promise and
[1:21:56] chapter 16 verse 15
[1:21:58] it says go into all the world
[1:22:01] and to preach the gospel to every
[1:22:02] creature
[1:22:04] every single one of them and he that
[1:22:06] believeth and is baptized
[1:22:08] shall be saved amen this is the word of
[1:22:12] the lord right here this is jesus
[1:22:13] speaking to him right here
[1:22:15] claim this
[1:22:16] claim is
[1:22:17] listen to this right here
[1:22:21] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:22:24] be saved you can tie it down right there
[1:22:27] you can you can hold on to that tight
[1:22:29] but he that book that believeth not
[1:22:31] shall be damned
[1:22:33] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:22:35] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:22:38] devils they shall speak in new tongues
[1:22:41] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:22:42] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:22:45] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:22:47] and they shall recover
[1:22:49] that was mark 16 that was the church in
[1:22:52] action that was the word of the lord
[1:22:53] going forth to him what you're going to
[1:22:55] do with it
[1:22:57] you drive a stake right down there you
[1:22:59] you claim that right there
[1:23:01] any any claim that he's given you is
[1:23:03] yours
[1:23:04] just let go and let god have his way
[1:23:08] and it says like this says for god is
[1:23:10] the law and his word is the law and god
[1:23:12] in his word made certain claims to the
[1:23:15] church and therefore we have the right
[1:23:17] to enforce the claims upon satan and say
[1:23:19] give it back
[1:23:22] enforce those claims
[1:23:25] amen
[1:23:27] that's the church
[1:23:28] in action
[1:23:30] over in acts it's the church in power

[1:31:53] now pray each one of you and believe
[1:31:56] in your own way
[1:32:00] in matthew 9
[1:32:01] he talks about that woman
[1:32:03] that claimed her promise
[1:32:06] matthew 9 and verse 20 and said and
[1:32:09] behold the woman
[1:32:11] that was diseased with the
[1:32:12] issue of blood for 12 years
[1:32:15] came behind him
[1:32:17] and touched the hem of his garment
[1:32:20] for she said within herself
[1:32:23] if i made but touch the his garment
[1:32:26] i shall be whole
[1:32:29] and jesus turned about
[1:32:31] and when he saw her he said daughter
[1:32:34] be of good cheer
[1:32:36] be of good comfort
[1:32:38] thy faith has me made the whole
[1:32:41] and the woman was made whole from that
[1:32:43] hour
[1:32:44] she claimed that promise
[1:32:47] she she didn't just look at the crowd
[1:32:50] she didn't look at how great the crowd
[1:32:51] was
[1:32:53] she looked at her promise
[1:32:54] she looked at her claim
[1:32:57] and said right there
[1:32:59] right there is where i can get healed
[1:33:01] right there
[1:33:02] right there at that altar is where i can
[1:33:04] claim it right there is where i can get
[1:33:06] the holy ghost right there is where i
[1:33:07] can get my healing
[1:33:09] right in your seats this morning is
[1:33:10] where you can receive it amen just claim
[1:33:13] it
[1:33:14] all she did was believe that if she just
[1:33:16] touched the helm of his just the just
[1:33:19] the little hem of his garment
[1:33:22] oh church
[1:33:24] she laid claim on that and she believed
[1:33:27] with all her heart
[1:33:29] and he said thy faith has made thee
[1:33:31] whole
[1:33:32] it's your faith that's going to claim it
[1:33:34] this morning
[1:33:35] it might not be an easy street it's
[1:33:37] going to be tough
[1:33:39] but lay claim on it
[1:33:44] christ said our lives were a worthy
[1:33:45] cause
[1:33:48] when we were drunks dope addicts
[1:33:50] thieves whoremongers out in this whole
[1:33:52] world
[1:33:53] he's seen us he's seen us in the mirror
[1:33:55] clay
[1:33:57] he said you're you're a worthy cause
[1:33:59] brother shannon you're a worthy cause
[1:34:01] brother greg you're a worthy cause
[1:34:03] brother vernon brother bill brother
[1:34:05] stephen brother christopher your worthy
[1:34:06] cause
[1:34:08] he said
[1:34:09] those are mine
[1:34:10] worthy calls
[1:34:14] now don't just push to the side this
[1:34:15] morning
[1:34:16] the price has been paid
[1:34:19] except the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:23] the debt is cleared
[1:34:25] he paid a debt
[1:34:26] i couldn't pay
[1:34:29] he paid it all this morning he cleared
[1:34:32] it all the way back that abstract title
[1:34:34] did
[1:34:35] he cleared it all the way back
[1:34:37] said my blood on calvary has paid the
[1:34:39] price this morning
[1:34:44] amen
[1:34:46] let me show you another reason why satan
[1:34:48] hates this book of revelations
[1:34:51] jesus christ the church
[1:34:53] because he knows
[1:34:55] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:34:57] today and forever
[1:34:59] amen
[1:35:01] and he changes not
[1:35:02] he knows that a whole lot more than even
[1:35:05] 90 percent of these theologians and he
[1:35:08] knows
[1:35:09] that god is immutable in his nature
[1:35:14] he is immutable in all of his all his
[1:35:16] ways
[1:35:17] and thus satan knows assuredly the
[1:35:20] original church at pentecost with the
[1:35:22] power of god
[1:35:24] mark 16 in action
[1:35:26] this is the true church
[1:35:28] jesus claims as his own
[1:35:31] and all else fails
[1:35:33] it has to be
[1:35:35] now remember this
[1:35:36] christ in his true church is a
[1:35:39] continuation of the book of acts
[1:35:41] amen
[1:35:43] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:35:45] that that antichrist spirit will come
[1:35:48] into the church and defile it and make
[1:35:50] it lukewarm and formal powerless it
[1:35:53] exposes satan
[1:35:55] revealing his works attempting to
[1:35:57] destruct
[1:35:59] god's people
[1:36:01] and discredit god's word right down to
[1:36:03] the time that he has been cast into the
[1:36:05] lake of fire and he fights that
[1:36:08] he cannot stand it because he knows that
[1:36:12] if the people get the true revelation
[1:36:15] of the true church
[1:36:16] and what she is what she stands for and
[1:36:20] what she can do the greater works
[1:36:23] she will be an invincible army
[1:36:27] you claim that this morning
[1:36:29] you claim that promise
[1:36:31] when satan is there trying to steal that
[1:36:34] away from you trying to create you a
[1:36:35] lukewarm spirit
[1:36:37] and just say well i'll just barely get
[1:36:38] by
[1:36:40] no satan i'm an invincible army
[1:36:43] i have claimed it i recognize who i am
[1:36:46] my possession is in christ jesus
[1:36:49] this world is going to pass away but my
[1:36:52] possession is in him this morning amen
[1:36:56] let's stand as musicians coming
[1:36:59] yes satan hates that revelation
[1:37:02] but we love it
[1:37:04] with that true revelation in our lives
[1:37:06] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:37:09] us
[1:37:11] we'll prevail over them
[1:37:13] so you drop down your stake this morning
[1:37:16] i don't know what you have need of
[1:37:19] you haven't you know
[1:37:21] you know this morning
[1:37:23] and you drive it down right there
[1:37:26] you concrete it
[1:37:27] and you say this is mine
[1:37:30] and when the devil comes in
[1:37:33] and tries to tempt you in every way you
[1:37:35] take him back to that spot
[1:37:37] and you say right here satan's where
[1:37:39] it's at
[1:37:40] i know where my possessions at
[1:37:43] is in the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:46] let's sing a song i claim the blood
[1:37:48] have you claimed it this morning
[1:37:50] do you love him
