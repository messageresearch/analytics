is a great guy amen so good to see each and every one of you amen amen maybe youve a need on your heart this morning you just like to say I'd like for the Lord to pass by my way maybe take one sentence in this service and speak directly to my heart so that I know that that's not the mind of a man but I know that's from God Heavenly Father how we love you with all of our hearts we're all on a journey here we came from God and we're going back to God lord and while we're here in in this room we invite you here we watched the supernatural God In Action last night Lord we're just so thankful father for how you work and how you operate now Lord we surrender ourselves to you today ask you that You' minister to us and each and every one of us today all of us have great needs Lord brother Donnie Nicholson with a great need this morning pray that you'd send your word to him and Lord sister Denise that's listening this morning pray that you'd send your word to heal her back all the parts of her body that's been Disturbed May that infection just leave her de God and Lord the many needs that have been sent into us this week and I pray that you would just go to each one of them Lord now we ask you to anoint the lips of a man that it might not be the mind of a man but it may be from you we can study and prepare but we ask you now that you would ignite us with the Holy Spirit touch our hearts now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen and amen amen and isn't he good to us if you will turn with us to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 this morning and verse 1 down through verse n amen I'd like to continue the thought of what we had last week and uh maybe that was just a little bit of a different way of looking at it a Return to Eden even all nature is going to be returned and restored and all the animal kingdom will be restored and and then and then you and I are are being and restored but I'd like to kind of continue that thought of God's Gathering if we can do that 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse one amen but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you and of course he's just written chapter 4 where we talk about the Rapture for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safy then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon the woman with a child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of of the light and the children of the day were not of the night nor of the darkness aren't you thankful for that God is writing this about you amen you are all children of the light and Children of the day were not of the night nor of Darkness that ought to make us all shout right there therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith faith and love and for a helmet and the hope of Salvation I want us to read this last verse together for God hath not appoint us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated can I just say this to you everything is in order everything is in order there's nothing out of place the things that you and I are seeing just before the tribulation period that is setting in these things must be even our nation our our our white house last night was attacked and and even there's bombs dropping in many different places in the Middle East and new people that are getting into the the arena of the last move and so we realize that that that could not happen until God allowed it I want you to catch that until God allowed it a lot of people have a lot of different thoughts and a lot of Ambitions and a lot of wars that they'd like to get involved in but the Angels stand guard and amen and the only way that they can be doing what they're doing is you and I are in a place amen of going home I you know as I look at the year and we've got a lot of things that are that are planning for the year and things that I'm planning for the year and I actually plan and make goals for myself and I call it to live for and and uh things that I'm going to do and things I'm trying to to to because your mind's got to be that way but I would have to say this to you as I look at the year coming there's a lot of things I don't think we're going to get to do because I feel like the Rapture is so at hand amen now there's a song that is said this is the evening time it is later than you think the bride is preparing now for our Lord to meet I don't know if you guys have that up up there and I'd like to just read those words and I may have I may have just quoted them but is it there all right if you find it if you find it it's fine amen amen last week we spoke about when Noah had preached for 120 years sin had came on the World to such a point till God repented that he even made man so we know that the Earth is just like you and I it has to be washed for him to redeem the Earth Back to Eden he's got to wash it then he's got to come and bleed on it right so when his blood was Dripping on the cross it his body had came from the cursed earth right when Mary ate his body he was God but when he ate she ate his body it came out of the cursed Earth all of the potassium and the potash and all of the elements of the earth that was placed into his body he was not only redeeming you and I but he was redeeming this Earth and now there's going to come a baptism of fire are you with me God washed it how many seen a rainbow but God made a covenant when he washed the Earth I'll never destroy the Earth again by water I think of all of these crazy people that says that it never happened Noah's flood never happened what about that rainbow is that just a natural phenomena or is that God's Bible in the heavens reminding us and and let me just say this you when God does a work in you he don't just do a part and then just just stop at you he's got a plan and if you remember he preached for 120 years let me just say the critics they had to be there oh the scoffers had to be there you know and we've came through the time period of this message to where that believe the sign took place and people walked away and people scoffed the message but they also were scoffing the Bible that's right they wasn't just scoffing the ministry or even brother brandham but they were scoffing the Bible because the message came from the Bible and so and and so as you come you you notice that they had that had to be they had to do their thing and but no doubt if you were sitting in Noah's day you were thinking it's never rained before it's never rained before and this man's prophesying that it's going to rain he's telling us that the Earth is going to be destroyed by water it's more than a bridge and it's more than a cloud and it's are you with me now and so they were just constantly scoffing but I want to ask you now did it happen and and let me just say this you God's timing is perfect we as human beings we get in a hurry we're constantly thinking about the season and the time and the and listen the Rapture could not happen in 77 well well well prove it brother Ron how many of you got born again after 77 I know it's Sunday morning but how many of you were born again after 1977 look at all those hands you were on his mind and the scripture says I'll not lose a one are you with me now I'll not lose a one so I want you to just notice there Comes A Time and there comes a season now not Noah could not go go gather those animals he had been responsible for building and been responsible for preaching for 120 years and now he himself doesn't know the season he doesn't know the season even that he's in he's preaching he's preaching he's preaching nobody but his family is gathering but now there's a season that is happening to where animal two by two two by two begin to gather toward the ark I want to ask you what intelligence moved on those animals to migrate two by two something moved and no doubt there was millions of that type of an animal millions of those type of an animal but two by two male and female begin to move toward the ark don't tell me God don't know how to operate those animals begin to move toward the ark and if you could talk to them and ask Mr giraffe what are you doing there's something in me Mr lion there's something in me Mr by B there's something in me you remember brother Kelly that's 37 below zero this morning aren't you glad aren't you glad you're here in Edmonton it's 41 below zero and so and so up there in Brother Kelly's Country it's called a a Flyway and those geese are up there and and they'll they'll live through the summer and they'll live through the spring and the fall and all of a sudden something will begin to move on the inside of them there's something there's an Intelligence on the inside of them let me just capture the intelligence that I'm talking about brother brandom is standing with an Infidel in bloody clothes and they've been hunting and and and he's standing there and and and they've been hunting and brother Woods is with him and the Infidel has been talking to him he don't believe in God and and and brother Randon picks up an apple asked the man can I have an apple and he said well the yellow jackets are going to eat them up you may as well eat one and he and he looked and he said what intelligence is telling that tree it's August what intelligence is telling that tree to start start the sack to go back to the ground and the leaves are starting to tell turn colors amen right and brother Brandon begins to talk about the intelligence that is in nature right are you with me now the intelligence that's in nature of course you and I know that that man there's a miracle just happened a miracle just happened over on the hillside a woman dying and somebody took a took a prayer cloth and went and brother Brandon praise over that they come and lay it on her and she's well overnight and he's wanting to talk to the preacher the preacher that that is that is that has prayed for that woman being an Infidel there's something still in his mind that there's God and so happened God migrates the prophet and he's standing in front of him an Infidel that lived that way all of his life that lived that way all of his life thinking that way all of his life of all the people on the Earth that predestinated seed standing on the porch right brother Brown was talking about the in the intelligence of God in a tree and he leads that man to Christ am an infidel I think about this message and how incredible it is I just want to share a few things that's on my heart I think about all the schools and all the intelligence all the way down through the seven Church ages that God took this book and he hid it from the greatest Minds in the world he he hid the Seven Seals he hid the trumpets he hid he hid the Thunders but he was going to send a messenger here that wouldn't finish school that would be from Kentucky that would be a man that he would begin to deal with at a very young age and he would have to get him so surrendered to the point to where that he wouldn't preach his own mind and he would remind us you're not feeding on the words of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man now there's no better one to reveal the book than the one that wrote it now think about the man age you know some of the greatest literary students in the world is on the scene under John Wesley and Knox and Calvin and pheny even Spurgeon these are some of the greatest intellect speakers that there are in the world but God hid the Seven Seals brother brandom even makes mention to us this is important to you now he makes mention to us that before before the SE he says before he came Revelations 10:1 before he came they were only probing and he even uses the word guessing that's right I'll take brother ROM's good guess over top of all the theologians but anyway they were just probing and he comes up to the church ages and he takes us through the church ages and take us through each messenger and who they are there's not another speaker I was thinking this morning as sister Connie is playing what you ask us to play this morning and brother brandham says more in a paragraph than most tele evangelists will say in a year so never let us take it for granted and here here brother brandom is speaking and you know and and he he's speaking and he's just going and he's going and he's laying out sermons the Hebrew series and Corinthians and and Jehovah Gyra and he's taking us through but there comes a junction there comes a junction to where that now I got to speak to the bride there's a third pull of first and second it came and and everybody was attached to that but now they're going to say he got off that's right but it's not to the world it's to the Bride of Jesus Christ and so it comes up to a certain point it's he'll use a term called a Chasm there's a great Chasm that will come between the church ages and the release of the word and Christ himself will come to the messenger and the Messenger will be begin to speak and the Thunders are the are the word that has been preached for seven Church ages but they're uninterpreted and they themselves can't even understand let me just take for an instance justification and brother Brandon brings it up especially in the visible Union of the bride and he said he said it's as though you never did it in the first place thank you Lord that's right and the reason I'm going there is because this is very important so many times your enemy that you fight takes the book of memory and takes the book of memory and begins to beat you over and over and over again things that you only know about maybe your spouses don't even know about only you deep within your heart know about you can use the term skeletons in the closet or this or that or things that you never want to be brought back up but let me just say this you not even got after the blood is applied not even God looks at those [Applause] things and here Luther is bringing us from Catholicism and he's beginning to preach the just shall live by faith I want you I want to just I'm sorry may I may take a little longer today but let me just say this you in that day they were selling prayers you had to confess to a priest are you with me there was purgatory that was being taught the Bible wasn't even in this form most people was not allowed to read the book and God takes one scripture to this messenger and he stands there and begins to preach we don't need paid prayers you don't need to be under Catholicism you don't no man has the right to be your judge I paid the price of redemption when I justify you it's as though you never did it in the first place listen this bride is not like Ruth and Rahab right she's not like Esther and she's not like all of them they're all tips they're all tips but when God washes this bride she is Virgin cuz God cannot attach himself to a harlot he makes you [Music] recreated have you got that so far I want you to get it CU it'll help you tomorrow it'll help you next week don't tell me I don't know where I'm at I know 100% sure that the accuser of the Brethren accuses every one of you and he tells you that you're not worthy he tells you that you're not qualified he tells you that this message is too deep and and too high for you to attain it come on well let me just remind you just as those animals were gathered I wish I could preach what I'm feeling just as those animals were gathered God gathered [Applause] you you didn't deposit the seed on the inside of you God deposited that and when God says I'll not lose a one than Lord I want you to just think about this for a moment all that you've been through Satan trying to destroy you because of the seat you can't see the light around you but Satan can see it why don't he go pick on a drunk or a prostitute or or some church member but he picks on you over and over cuz you got something you got a predestinated seed that is [Applause] eternal brother Ron you don't know where I've been I I don't want to know am you don't know what I've been through I don't want to know you don't know what all the mistakes that I've made and how horrendous it's been okay you got here didn't you some of you have no idea who your father is you have no idea in the Old Testament an illegitimate couldn't come back into the congregation for 400 years but this blood can so wash the curse from your life you don't need to get a DNA I'm just you don't have to go get a DNA test you don't have have to go and search your family the 400-year curse does not even [Applause] apply bless Lord I think predestination is such a powerful statement for those that have been here a while you know that I love predestination notice the scripture says for God hath not appointed us to wrath brother Chris and why do we worry it doesn't matter where our family come from doesn't matter a situation well brother Ron but my family is a mess yeah but you're not you may have come out of total chaos and it really wasn't even your choice that's right it really wasn't your choice but God rich in mercy God in Mercy watched over that seed notice this for God hath not appointed us to wrath notice notice another verse Jeremiah 1 and verse5 before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee Hallelujah now he's speaking of a prophet but he's not just speaking of a prophet he's also speaking of the predestinated SE well brother Ron I came from a of a night one night where my mom was drunk and she got with a drunken man I don't know who her father my father is even about God does God watched over your seed are you with me but brother Ron I've made so many mistakes in my life think about it before you ever got here your lineage be which you could not have any control over think about it I I'm going deep with you think about it you think about you think about your mistakes that youve made from 10 years old to 40 years old and you whip yourself over and over again let me just take you before 10 to 40 back when your generation ations were going on you had no control over it but God was watching over your seed all the way down knowing that you had to be born cuz he's got a book I'll not lose one the Rapture can't happen till every one of them get there this is more than a thief on the cross I don't know where that last one will come in but they're coming they're coming they're on their [Applause] way now want I want to just lay something real close here this isn't a temporary feeling this isn't like a presidential in the white house where you change administrations and they they undo everything the guy did four years before and they redo it all and America becomes a different Nation we're going to make her great again we're going to do all you ain't going to do nothing we got our all in a huff and puff about politics and it's a the devil I want to point your eyes to a different Kingdom I don't mind you praying for America that she comes back again I don't mind all of those I want to live in peace I want to live in happiness I want to live in a good civilization as long as we're here but this is not my home this is only temporary let's remember that our accuser can only work on our temporary existence right I want you to get that so I can't do it with this book let me do it this book okay he has a book of your old old Deeds you don't want nobody to read that book you don't want even your wife to you definitely don't want your kids but when God saved you and he washed you and he raised you up and you become adopted Sons and Daughters of God this book don't matter let me just give you a little insight how this works and myself as a pastor I'm not a micromanager I'm not going to I'm not I I could care less what kind of car you drive I I'm not interested even in what house that you live in even what job I I'm only interested in you overcoming so when you have a tiff with your wife all I'll do is pray for you I don't even want to know when you got a tiff with one another I don't want to know I I I I don't want to know well brother Ron you're supposed to leave 99 and go get to one let me just say this let me give you a real revelation of 9 and9 and go and get one if I have to come get you I'm going to have to break your legs do you really want me to break your legs pull you up against myself and hold you and micromanage you for the next year till we eat you it's a really good scripture 99 and go get the one but think about the repercussions we eat you next year it's real sweet it's real sweet but the principle of that is I got to break your legs so you don't run off again I'm preaching scripture I'm preaching script are you with me so don't get a drama class with me I won't break your legs until God tells me to break them most people's problems is because they make them that's right when that book is sealed and God seals it away Justified as though you never did it in the first place Tara can I use you just for a moment God spoke to me publicly in this audience to speak to Steve and tell him not to worry is that right she's on the way let me just say this you I've ate with you guys i' I've ate at dinner with you guys guys and I've never came to your home and you've never told me your history Ain that right can you just raise your hand for the visible audience but God told me you were coming now to the outside audience that looks down they go well she must have been there forever and brother Ron had to do some heavy cleaning to get her like she is oh no the seed that was deposited on the inside of her when she began to eat on the word her dress code changed her attitude changed her thoughts [Applause] changed I don't need to know nothing about the book and neither should she in her living room or wherever talk about the book it's done it's done it's over it's [Applause] forgiven brother Donnie Nicholson he's not here maybe he's watching I didn't ask him for permission brother Donnie Nicholson that's that is a phenomenal bass player he could have you remember the night that I said brother Donnie I I want to sing with you amen we've never sang together it came up and I he's standing here at the pull pit and he's standing there how many remembers this night that I'm talking about and I said you know brother Donnie could be out in the world playing music and making money and doing all of these different kind of things and brother Donnie just pipes up and said well I may tell you I just got called this week they wanted me to go back and play music I didn't know that that God knew that the first time I met brother Donnie was at his aunt's funeral and God spoke to me matter of fact they wanted me to help preach it you remember that sister Nancy you you guys didn't go one of you guys went with me somebody went with me and we said it and I said no no no I I I'll not say anything today and and I should have I really should have but anyway I just sat and listened to the sermon and God spoke to me when brother Donnie was playing he struming his guitar said he'll be in your church I didn't think that but God thought that brother Donnie excuse me just give me a little leeway here I know that he has an incredible past I think we all got a good knowledge that he has an incredible past been in the military has a family in Germany has a has a family here he's got a history but think about God and His Infinite Mercy while he was doing all of that nonsense he can't undo a thing yesterday but God in his eternal election Hallelujah hey I might [Applause] play did Noah have critics did Brother random have have critics do you have critics the guy playing that base that could have been a phenomenal out in the world somewhere another being Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but God's got a bigger plan what can wash away my [Applause] sins brother Marcus he's a song leader many years ago I didn't know him then we're close in age but I didn't know him then it was at brother Robby Turner's church and how many how many knew he meant that point in his life life how many know him yeah it's okay to raise your hand phy us it's it's okay I'll tell you when I met him I met him on a plane yeah and he begins to I've talked to his can I go through this just for a moment I preach a meeting and on Sunday evening I go to get on the plane and the woman behind the counter says we've canceled the flight I'm standing in wet clothes my shoes are mushy and I look across at her and I've got plans tomorrow I look across at her and I said I have preached a meeting I'm totally wore out I need to get home to my wife you know what I mean amen amen she said 'The flight's gone I said can you fix it she said I'll put you on another plane listen I I have flew many times in my life I've never had this happen she said I'll put you on another plane they got one seat left I'll put you on that plane it's against the window I said could care less I'm the last guy to board I run I run to the thing they put me on I sat down the man beside of me is a chatter box and he's telling me all about life and he's telling me all about his boss sitting beside him and you know he's just going on and on and on I'm so I am so in another realm and I'm thinking God you cancel my flight what a sense of humor you must have put me in a window seat beside this great big man that's sharing my seat and he won't shut up for all the money in the world and he finally says what are you doing I said well I'm a preacher and I don't have any time to fool with him I I'm wore out with this guy and I said I'm a preacher Willam brandham I follow that message he pipes up and he begins to tell me I was raised in that and begins to tell me stories he says he even struggles now to remember that something now has told me God forced me off of that flight God put me beside a him and now for the next number of years I stand in meetings telling the story I've just told you looking for him now if God put it in my heart looking for him how much more that God have it in his heart I'll not lose a one I'll not lose a one and he's telling me of his Devastation of his life and how he's fell and how he's done all of that it's in the book it's in the book well brother Ron but he's got a lot of critics I could care less about your critics or his brother Ron do you know his mistakes no and I don't want to know his mistakes I don't want to know [Applause] yours brother Doug this is so powerful if we can just grab this morning's message this is so powerful when we stand there in Eden that new Eden again is a song that the angel Ang can't sing Amazing Grace CU they haven't been where you've been you're you wrote a book about your life as a matter of fact I didn't recognize you when you came and we were having a little family meal down at the fellowship hall we actually speak for the first time in all of those years walking in in the in the in the parking lot oh but brother Ron he's this or that I could care less worry is it this or that we speak we walk in you were there we walk in and we set at a big table and God orchestrated that he would sit beside of me and while he's sitting beside of me I want you to just think God speaks in my ear this is the man all these sermons that I preached and dropped his story this is the man that was on the plane you've heard me say God will put you in a pinch once in a while what if you're wrong what if you're wrong I said ' we've met before he said ' no we've never met before I said 'es we have we've met before no I can't say I can't say we've ever met before this is this is the first time I said no I said we were on a plane many years ago and I described the story that I just described to you forgive me I I just want to place this story here this is not by chance it's not by chance sister Heather you and brother Jason was at a cracker bar and you were seeking about an impossible job and you guys came over and sat down and a supernatural event a presence drops a presence drop and that impossible job became your job thank you Lord was that by chance you you can't orchestrate these things forgive me you can't orchestrate these things me being the pastor here sister Connie I'll tell you sister Connie didn't want to be here she said because your family and it'll be too tough you to Pastor your your family she didn't want to do it as a matter of I took an $80,000 a year cut it's all right God pays bills brother Ron I see your house I see your cars I see everything around you Everything You Touch Is blessed let me just say my boss pays every bill and if God is your partner you better have big plans Matthew had decided that he was going to go back to work at a police job he wouldn't want me to so I'm not going to ask him permission in November and in December they hired him they told him theyve given him the job it wasn't even a question they were going to hire him back as a police officer and one night God dealt with me I need him here at this church you heard him last night we need that and God spoke to me and said you make him a better offer I'm not the boss here amen you make him a better offer than they made him well I did it blowed him away it was the answer to your prayer was it not sister Cassie we don't need him coming in here in a uniform we don't need him missing Services I'm sure we need Godly police officers but we need him amen I told him I'm not hiring you to preach I'm hiring you to watch after me Hallelujah I'm hiring you to be my personal assistant well brother Ron I don't know if I agree with all that take it up with the boss how does all that work brother Ron well that night I went back to bed I went to bed the next night I did not have it on my mind I was at totally at peace and I dreamed a dream I was sitting with Donnie Reagan in his office he's got a white eagle it stands about that tall I'm a sculpture guy and it's a white eagle that stands about that tall never seen another one like it stands about that tall and I'm looking at that eagle and I'm talking to brother Donnie about the situation that I'm doing with m Matthew and he told me exactly what God put on my heart he said it's the mind of God brother Ron so I contacted brother Donnie Reagan he'll probably listen to this I contacted brother Donnie Reagan about what had happened he said that's exactly what I've told you well brother Ron I don't know how all that works well can I bring it down to a more Simple Thing amen I trim my dog everybody ought to have one and it don't lose hair but it grows hair really big time I bought trimmers I bought everything I bought scissors I bought all these things and and you know I was just none of those things seem to work right and so we give it a bath we trim it we give it a bath and trim it and so I look on I look on Google and and then I look on Amazon and I found the the the trimmers that actually is supposed to work for that kind of a dog and so I go to Amazon and I put it in the cart it's $22.18 I just put it in a cart an hour and a half later the Lord spoke to me and said the scissors that you just ordered are in your garage in the file cabinet in the top drawer under some paper I've had them for years so God will train you with a pair of scissors that's just a little thing is that a little thing are you a little thing brother Doug your your moving here wasn't a little thing it was not a little thing brother Chris you coming here is not a little thing brother SE Bree you look at me as a like I'm my father I haven't heard that from you but that's what you look at me it's like I'm a father to you you're coming here was it a little thing no he's I think he's probably got one of the best Natures I've ever met and we haven't had a whole lot of conversation but you do look at me as kind of a father ain't that right so when all of your nonsenses people you'll not find me throwing rocks at you am has everybody got that is that all right did I make it simple enough till a six-year-old can understand it I talked to you about your mother yesterday didn't I I talked to you about your mother yesterday I don't think I've ever met your mother but I'm absolutely concerned about her I don't need her history and you can tell her that I'm not interested in the history I'm interested in her soul yes Lord I can say an incredible amount of things here an incredible amount of things but we talk about God rewriting your life why should we beat ourself when the book has been sealed I'm saying a whole lot right here this should help you amen I think about the timing as I watched Matthew preach that sermon on Jubilee last night how many notice he said jubil and then Jubilee let me just say this to you when God releases you and you're no longer a slave anymore you are not doing yourself any good or other people doing listen don't bring up another's past I want to say this by the word of the Lord don't bring up another one's [Music] past do you think Ruth went through her life and they kept it against her no do you think Rahab went through her life and now's married and bringing forth a future Redeemer no once it's done it's [Music] done well brother Ron in Matthew chapter 1 they bring up Rahab the Harlot it is a reminder that my grace is sufficient for you now I want to remind you if God could get you here if God could get you here he can get you [Applause] there before I form thee in the belly I knew thee if you'll turn with me to Isaiah chapter 65 and I want you to look at these words for behold verse 17 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former thing the former shall not be remembered so I've been preaching this scripture whether you knew it or not I've been preaching this half of the scripture for now 40 minutes nor come to mine amen thank you Lord you're married don't bring up old girlfriends and old boyfriends don't bring up old parties don't bring up all the nonsense drop it why'd you say that brother Ron I picked it up but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem of rejoicing and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and a joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying I could spend an hour right there there shall be no more th an infant of days an old men that hath not filled his days for the child should die a 100 years old but the sinner being 100 years old shall be cursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them and they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and the the mind and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands and they shall not wor labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they shall they are the the seed of the Blessed of the earth and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear and I know there's a I know there's some time overlaps is here notice this next verse a restoration of nature the wolf and the lamb shall feed together I want you to read this verse with me the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the Bullock and dust shall be the Serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain sayeth the Lord it's quite a lot to take in right there I want you to think about from where we are to where we're going when God made a lion he made the male to be a male and he made the female to be a female don't get offended at me this is brother brandham brother brandham said that male is so beautiful and so strong and he's a male dominion and in his male domain he has never changed in his look since the Garden of Eden nor the female but in the fall he became a predator that's right now man stood in in the Garden of Eden in perfect Paradise but when he fell all of perversion be to come in on the male animal let me just remind you we're an animal without the Holy Ghost we're an animal from where we talked about just in the last little bit in your old book you did those things because of your animalistic nature the First Union of your first man God had to divorce you from that nature and you had to die to it you had to die to it but watch as we come through Sodom and gomorah even now men don't know who they are women don't know who they are men with hair weigh down their back and skinny jeans on and don't send me letters I'm telling you the truth men has lost their identity of being a real man that don't need to be in the message either we don't know need some pretty boy boy that don't know what kind of bathroom he needs to be in women you think about brother Brandon when his his Soul's now in prison what he sees in the canker over the eyes and all the jewelry on everywhere else and sees all of those different kinds of things and he remembers what he saw in Hell Yeah amen why did he preach so strong and why do we preach so strong we don't want you to go to hell and let me just say this you I don't want to send nobody to Hell listen even God don't send you to hell you go on your own your choices take you there your attitude takes you there brother Kelly hilderbrand's mom didn't like preachers she as a matter of fact she didn't like church so he invites her to come and hear me preach and she comes she's a good citizen she comes it shocks everybody she comes her name is Mary Lou she's probably going to watch this and Mary Lou is strong in her nature and strong in her wheel and and she's very much the boss sorry Harry she's the boss and so we go downstairs to to eat and when we go downstairs to eat I I've I'm standing there and this is the first time I've ever met her and she walks up to over to me and she points her finger right in my chest and she said young man You Preach too long well I recognize she's got the same nature that my grandmother had and because of scars of life and scars of situations and all different kind of things in the old book that she's like my grandmother that went through all those things and I pick up real quickly she's got the same Spirit my grandmother's been dead 15 years at that point I did the thing that she did not expect me to do as a preacher I hugged her and I may get some criticism over it I hugged her but it worked it melted her Stony [Applause] heart it melted her Stony heart and here she's being hugged by people that she can't stand preachers that have done her so much harm and shame on them and I say shame on them listen that's a predestinated seed that you're dealing with I saw more than a woman that had all of this book on her I told her I loved her she came back to every service and then she met me at the back door so she make sure she get another one of them hugs [Applause] amen the process took a while to get all that washed one night we were standing after the meeting was over and we were standing and she looked at me and she said I've came a long way but I'll never lose these earrings and I said it's okay it's okay now you might have said brother Ron why did you say that c if a man takes them off a man does that brother Kelly calls me and he said brother Ron she took those earrings and made me a tie pen I don't know how many TI pins I can get but let me just say this to you when God begins to wash you well that's just one story brother Ron okay Murphy Wong and his wife are coming from China somebody hands them a track they come to the church Murphy Wong is one of Hebrews 11 if Hebrews 11 is continued his name is going to be there they come to church she she don't know nothing she can't hardly understand English at that point she don't know nothing she's sitting in church and all of a sudden she disappears Murphy's going where did she go she must have left she must have got mad and left she went to the bathroom and begin to wash Hallelujah you you don't have to worry about cleaning yourself up too much he'll cause you to say I'm gonna leave that music alone I'm going to read those books alone I'm not going to watch those movies no more I'm not going to say those things no more I'm not going to dwell on my past no more I'm going to take that and let the book be closed amen hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] I'm sorry I went too long but brother Ron you're just a different sort of pre teer I've been in business since I was 13 years old when I was 13 years old I ran a produce market then I became a a manager at a grocery store when I married sister Connie I was a butcher then I went to the Arsenal I excelled at the Arsenal then I went to I I became a chimney sweep and we were the top in the top 10 in the United States for eight years running and then God brought me here to be your pastor Master amen and if I'm doing business with God God knows how to get his seed is this okay can I go just a few more minutes now I'm not like and don't don't let me point you out but there's so many people keep going through the book amen well let me just remind you something let let me take you to a natural thing I've been in the business all these years I have never ever went into sister Connie and say how's our

partner here well you shouldn't have ate that hamburger you shouldn't have ate that steak you shouldn't have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have bought that new car if God is my partner why why are you bringing this up brother Ron if he got me here now I'm going to catch you because I had to throw the net for a reason don't pay attention to your critics cuz they'll make you want to go back into the book that's right and it'll be like you trying to repay debt and keep looking in the account do I have enough money amen I'm GNA say it again because my mic must be off well brother Ron I I look make sure I I look 42 times a week to see how much money is in my bank you're wasting your time okay if you want to do that look once amen then you know I'm not beating you over the head don't look I'm not micromanage you in disappoint but neither let this book be constantly be beat over you over and over again if God is your partner and if he has wased you of your sins move [Applause] forward in our home how many eats at my table on a regular you don't have to stand to she she eats there how many eats at my home on a regular basis including my grandchildren could you

getting close cuz the bells are going off so Noah we're going to live in that City and all the things that you fight in your mind because I know you are all the things that you fight in your mind and you wrestle with and the enemy beats you with you are as Eternal as God is so tonight when you look up and see the stars God thought of those Stars when he was creating them but he wasn't just creating them he was creating you and you were in his mind before the foundation of the world and it's not you hanging on and you trying to make yourself good enough you just eat the word and the word forms itself and materializes itself around you you don't have to figure out your future it's already figured out for you amen when you get to the door it'll open amen it'll take care of itself Tom it was no accident when you asked Melissa to marry you again put a ring on her but when you guys Lo looked up in the tree there was a bald eagle sitting in the tree right over top of you wasn't that right ain't that right I got that picture I keep that picture very handy I want to finish now let the critic be the critic let the judge be the judge but if God saw you before the foundation of the world Donna as a heel and he watches over you and you come to that little hickey in time and you fall and then the enemy Wars with you for 40 years he Wars with you for 40 years and then all of a sudden he says it's time to come home that blood takes care that new nature that he's got on you now takes care and it didn't in the moment in twinkle Li he changes your nature he changed it here he changed it here and under the law of adoption you're born like a child you're you're you don't have to to make yourself get into it and make yourself get into it these these people that sit at my
