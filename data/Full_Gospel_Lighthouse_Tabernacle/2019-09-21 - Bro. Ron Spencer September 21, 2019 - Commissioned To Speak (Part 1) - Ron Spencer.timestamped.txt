[2:31] speak
[2:34] a man yes
[3:19] hey man hey man race the Lord for that
[3:22] hallelujah
[3:28] a man well this is a good verse to write
[3:30] read behind that a man the Lord is my
[3:35] shepherd and I shall not want he maketh
[3:39] me to let it lie down in green pastures
[3:41] and he leadeth me beside of the still
[3:44] waters and he restoreth my soul
[3:47] and he leadeth me in the paths of
[3:50] righteousness for his name's sake yea
[3:52] though I walk through the valley of the
[3:54] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[3:57] thou art with me
[4:00] I want you to know tonight on her own a
[4:02] lot of fear can happen but as long as
[4:07] he's with me I know that fear thy rod
[4:12] and thy staff they comfort me
[4:14] now prepares the table before me in the
[4:18] presence of mine enemies
[4:19] I want you to snow tiss where David said
[4:21] where God anoints me this where God
[4:27] anoints me he prepares the table before
[4:30] me in the presence of mine enemies thou
[4:34] anointest my head with all and my cup
[4:38] runneth over
[4:40] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[4:43] me all the days of my life and I will
[4:48] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[4:52] John chapter five and verse 31 and Jesus
[4:57] was saying this he said if I bear
[5:00] witness of myself my witness is not true
[5:05] there is another that beareth witness of
[5:08] me and I know that the witness which he
[5:12] witnesses of me is true you sent unto
[5:16] John and you bear witness unto the truth
[5:19] but I received not the testimony of from
[5:22] man but these things I say that she
[5:26] might be saved he was a burning and
[5:29] shining light and you were willing for a
[5:32] season to rejoice in his light but I
[5:35] have greater witness
[5:37] than that of John what a turning of the
[5:40] corner but I have greater witness than
[5:44] that of John for the works which the
[5:48] father hath given me to finish the works
[5:51] that I do bear witness of me that the
[5:55] father has sent me and the father
[5:58] himself which hath sent me hath bore
[6:02] witness of me and ye have neither heard
[6:04] his voice at any time nor seen his shape
[6:08] and ye have not his word abiding in you
[6:13] for a whom he had sent him you believe
[6:18] not notice these words search the
[6:21] Scriptures for in them you think you
[6:24] have eternal life and they are they
[6:27] which testify of me and you will not
[6:30] come to me that you might have life
[6:33] let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with
[6:37] all of our hearts tonight
[6:38] Lord we thank you for your gathering
[6:40] this afternoon and lord I just asked you
[6:43] that is you would anoint our hearts and
[6:45] anoint our lips as we would study and
[6:48] prepare for the service we ask you
[6:51] tonight that you would anoint this
[6:53] audience and congregation those that are
[6:55] listening in now and those that will
[6:57] listen to it we pray that you would
[6:59] speak to our hearts in a supernatural
[7:01] way this evening Lord touch the needs of
[7:04] this audience strengthen us we pray in
[7:07] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[7:09] amen you may be seated
[7:14] Exodus chapter 14 and verse 12 these are
[7:20] quite powerful words is not this the
[7:24] word that you did tell thee in Egypt
[7:29] saying let us alone that we may serve
[7:33] the Egyptians for it had been better for
[7:37] us to serve the Egyptians than should
[7:39] die in the wilderness
[7:40] and Moses said unto the people I love
[7:45] these words and Moses respond
[7:48] and Moses was commissioned are you with
[7:53] me
[7:53] not just Moses not just our prophet but
[7:58] you and Moses said unto the people fear
[8:05] you not stand still and see the
[8:09] salvation of the Lord
[8:11] which he will show you you too you today
[8:17] for the Egyptians whom you have seen
[8:21] today you shall see them again
[8:26] no more forever I don't know if you can
[8:34] read a more powerful text than that can
[8:37] I just read it to you again remember he
[8:40] was commissioned to stand in the spot
[8:43] now how is he commissioned to stand
[8:45] there he had stood beside of a bush that
[8:49] was not consumed with fire he had met
[8:52] God himself he didn't call himself God
[8:57] called him political people didn't call
[9:01] him God called him
[9:03] let's ask herself tonight who called us
[9:06] who gathered us who anointed us for this
[9:11] age God did now just as with your
[9:19] circumstances listen there they were and
[9:23] they were right amongst and the largest
[9:27] murderous situation was about to go on a
[9:31] literal genocide the greatest army of
[9:36] was buried down on him and it looked
[9:39] like they would drive them right into
[9:40] the Red Sea or destroy them there on
[9:43] that on that beach area I want you to
[9:46] understand and people begin to respond
[9:49] we'd have been better off
[9:52] we'd have been better off if you two
[9:55] just left us in Egypt we would continue
[9:57] on are you with me now
[10:01] but Moses responded sometimes you just
[10:06] got to respond in the face of all the
[10:09] unbelief that there is are you with me
[10:13] tonight two different powers comes to
[10:16] church one is the power of faith the
[10:21] other is the power of unbelief it's to
[10:24] whom that you surrender yourself to and
[10:29] when we begin to respond this word is
[10:31] for me and the challenge is for me in
[10:33] this day God could have chose a lot of
[10:37] different days for us to be born in but
[10:39] he knew pre-planning exactly when you
[10:42] would be born what hour that you would
[10:44] be born what circumstances you would be
[10:47] born under now notice what he said fear
[10:53] you not stand still and see the
[10:57] salvation of the Lord
[10:58] which he will show to you today for the
[11:05] Egyptians whom you have seen today you
[11:08] shall see them again no more forever the
[11:16] Lord shall fight for you and ye shall
[11:22] hold your peace it's a powerful thing to
[11:27] be able to hold your tongue it's a
[11:32] powerful thing for you to be able to
[11:33] hold your tongue it's a powerful thing
[11:38] for you to be able to hold your tongue
[11:45] hallelujah that's a powerful thing in it
[11:48] are you with me ships have great rudders
[11:51] great machines have great things but
[11:55] this tongue the scripture says no man
[11:57] contained it tells what's on the inside
[12:02] of your heart you remember when Jesus is
[12:06] standing before the judgment the
[12:09] greatest preacher the greatest king the
[12:13] greatest man that ever was lived did
[12:18] more in his silence he did more in his
[12:26] silence than men that has stood all day
[12:29] with great speeches in second chronicles
[12:36] chapter 25 in verse 15 and he said
[12:40] hearken ye old Judah and ye in habitants
[12:44] of Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat
[12:47] thus saith the LORD unto you be not
[12:51] afraid or be dismayed by reason of this
[12:53] great multitude notice these next words
[12:56] for the battle is not yours but God's
[13:02] tomorrow you shall go down against me of
[13:04] their men and behold they come up by the
[13:06] cliff of Ziss and and ye shall find them
[13:09] at the end of the brook and behold the
[13:11] wilderness of the Generale and ye shall
[13:14] not need to fight
[13:16] I love these words you shall not need to
[13:23] fight in this battle set yourself and
[13:26] stand still and see the salvation of the
[13:30] Lord with you o Judah and Jerusalem fear
[13:34] not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out
[13:38] against them for the Lord will be with
[13:42] you
[13:44] God constantly reminds us that he'll be
[13:47] with us but the Brandon was asked over
[13:51] and over again as he would stand before
[13:53] the phenomenal audiences up into the
[13:57] hundreds of thousands of people and God
[14:00] would do incredible mind-boggling things
[14:05] before the people
[14:06] critics false religions setting
[14:11] literally feet away from him
[14:14] voodoo artists demons trying to call up
[14:18] things against him and they asked him
[14:20] did you ever get nervous no he said he
[14:29] would be with me are you with me he said
[14:34] he would be with me now he had something
[14:37] in common with Moses as he was standing
[14:39] dear and God spoke to him don't cry to
[14:44] me stretch your rod out over this seat
[14:51] now let me just say you and I are not
[14:53] prophets but we're sons and daughters of
[14:56] God let me explain to you as a reminder
[14:59] sons and daughters of God have more
[15:03] authority in heaven than Archangels sons
[15:13] and daughters of God have more authority
[15:15] in heaven than Archangels turn to your
[15:19] neighbor and tell him that wormwood
[15:30] destroyed the world with water
[15:38] wormwood destroyed the world with water
[15:43] are you with me you have more authority
[15:48] than the destroy an angel of God so
[15:55] imagine your power over hell are you
[16:01] listening imagine your power over hell
[16:05] is it not a wonder why the devil tries
[16:08] to keep you from believing who you are
[16:13] is it not a wonder why that devil tries
[16:18] to keep you from believing who you are
[16:23] only with me and he tells you God don't
[16:27] love you and this book is full of I love
[16:31] you this book is full of promises I'll
[16:36] be with you I'll never leave you I'll
[16:39] never forsake you are you with me people
[16:49] have promised keeper conventions listen
[16:52] that's not a new thing
[16:54] God's been a promise keeper since before
[16:56] the foundation of the world
[16:59] and he still a promise keeper to not
[17:02] [Applause]
[17:03] [Music]
[17:03] [Applause]
[17:07] politicians only borrow it from God they
[17:11] stand and make promises to things that
[17:13] people want to hear and they make
[17:16] promises and make promises no and
[17:18] they'll never be able to fulfill any of
[17:19] it everything has to be elected by
[17:23] Congress or these or some kind of power
[17:25] listen God makes a promise God's the
[17:29] infinite power that said let there be a
[17:32] Sun Moon and stars and he believed his
[17:35] own word the thing with God was God
[17:38] spoken and then believed his word
[17:42] God deposited a part of himself inside
[17:47] of you all that God was he poured it
[17:51] into crust all that Christ was he pours
[17:54] it into the church you are the living
[17:58] epistle of God
[18:00] you're literally a testimony living
[18:06] Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21
[18:09] to him that overcometh this is your age
[18:15] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[18:19] sit with me in my throne not to him that
[18:22] survives not to him that gets BA
[18:26] God knew this Laodicean age and how dark
[18:29] it would be and how deceitful it would
[18:31] be and how horrible it would be and how
[18:34] immorally corrupted it would be and how
[18:36] politically charged it would be and how
[18:39] homosexual filled it would be he knew
[18:42] all the God didn't say I'm not gonna be
[18:45] able to have anybody I'm gonna have a
[18:47] bride that's a predestinated elected
[18:52] bride of Jesus Christ that will overcome
[18:59] hallelujah I happened to attack actually
[19:03] believe that Ephesians chapter 6 verse
[19:08] 10 thrilling my brethren be strong in
[19:12] the Lord and in the power of his might
[19:17] put on the whole armour of God that she
[19:21] may be able to stand against the wiles
[19:23] of the devil
[19:26] forget wrassle not against flesh and
[19:28] blood but against principalities and
[19:30] against powers and against the rulers of
[19:33] the darkness of this world and against
[19:35] spiritual wickedness in high places the

[20:44] only living true god and they be done to
[20:49] recognize that i'm a part of the kingdom
[20:51] I'm a citizen of another Kingdom I am a
[20:54] son and daughter of God they can ask
[20:56] petitions on the Living God and know

[23:53] I can't overcome three weeks from now

[24:01] believe we're living in the eighth day I
[24:03] got news for you
[24:04] we're still living in Laodicea now our
[24:07] soul is for the eighth day and we're
[24:10] going to the eighth day but baby we're
[24:12] still alive in this day Alleluia
[24:22] we still got a battle on our hands now
[24:29] Jesus commissioned us knowing we were
[24:32] going to have need some some charge
[24:34] orders and he said unto them go ye into
[24:38] all the world and preach the gospel that
[24:41] every creature and he that believeth not
[24:47] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[24:50] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[24:54] be damned and these signs shall follow
[24:57] them that believe in my name shall they
[25:02] cast out devils and they shall speak
[25:04] with new tongues and they shall take up
[25:07] serpents if they drink any deadly thing
[25:09] it shall not hurt them they shall lay
[25:13] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[25:19] [Music]
[25:21] we fulfill some of that in the last week
[25:25] or so we got on a plane
[25:28] we made the journey we sat on the tarmac
[25:32] for for two and a half three hours
[25:35] before that we even left Charlottesville
[25:37] we just sit there then we messed mixed
[25:41] own we missed our next flight and then
[25:44] we set in Chicago about four to six more
[25:46] hours and then we got to Calgary and we
[25:49] set for a few more hours and what I was
[25:51] supposed to do was get there at 3:00 and
[25:53] I got there at 11:11 did you enjoy your
[25:57] vacation brother run nah what's going to
[26:00] work my job to go to work
[26:05] are you with me I like what Billy Graham
[26:12] said one time he said you know I really
[26:14] like my cabin here in North Carolina he
[26:18] said I really like my home place but God
[26:20] told me to go and he didn't give me
[26:25] excuse he told us to go and preach the
[26:28] gospel and so we go by the commission of
[26:33] the word of God and speak the truth of
[26:35] this day and then there'll be signs and
[26:38] wonders follow so you can look back in
[26:43] your journey and see God did this and
[26:46] God did that and God did this and God
[26:49] did that and God did this brother Jason
[26:54] Jackson's watching this evening and we
[26:57] went to his place in in June and at his
[27:01] place there's a list that after the
[27:05] meeting was over there was a list that
[27:08] brother Jason presented us over the
[27:11] coming weeks of the things that God did
[27:13] and the list just kept growing and the
[27:15] list just kept growing and it just kept
[27:18] growing cancer was taken care of
[27:20] relationships was taken care of one
[27:22] situation after another was taken care
[27:24] of over and over we preach the word and
[27:27] then God is the final lay man and then
[27:32] after we walked out of the building we
[27:35] walked out in a and a person said now
[27:37] now listen only brother Branham could do
[27:39] that you're too late you're this way too
[27:43] late it's to every believer he gets us
[27:47] all differed to preach the gospel and
[27:49] different gifts in our lives but let me
[27:51] just say this these signs shall follow
[27:53] them that believe
[27:58] alleluiah and we're given the badge of
[28:01] authority in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:04] Christ if you abide in me and my words
[28:07] abide in you ask what you will and it
[28:10] shall be done unto you I'll never forget
[28:23] I was mowing grass behind our cabin I
[28:26] was mowing grass behind the cabin and we
[28:29] were pretty famous there in that area to
[28:32] have copperhead snakes and a copperhead
[28:33] just bit me bit me right on the ankle
[28:36] and maybe that thing was real and he
[28:41] took off disappeared I couldn't see him
[28:43] and I went to get I went to the power
[28:46] line brother Homer was working up there
[28:48] went to the power line and and I said
[28:50] hey I've been bit by a copperhead snake
[28:52] he didn't grab me take me to the
[28:54] hospital
[28:55] he always had a he always had a pill
[28:58] bottle in his in his pocket he pulled
[29:03] that pill bottle out gave me two
[29:04] benadryl put his hand on my head and
[29:06] said in the name of Jesus Christ he
[29:09] didn't quit erdan man mark chapter 16
[29:11] then he said go back to work I think so
[29:18] many times we have a personal pity party
[29:20] real quick and if you're not careful
[29:23] you'll get mourners and grievers and
[29:26] warriors and they'll all gather real
[29:27] quick about how bad it is just stop just
[29:30] a moment take God at His Word the
[29:35] scripture said whose report do you
[29:38] believe I choose to believe the word of
[29:41] the Lord hallelujah we looked at an
[29:56] absolute catastrophe last week and I'd
[30:00] say this is more than our hearts can
[30:02] stand when brother Joe Reynolds and
[30:05] sister Mandy's daughter just a real
[30:08] angel on the earth and we'd known since
[30:09] she was
[30:10] small maybe even before I don't know how
[30:14] we absorb such dark horrible situations
[30:19] of life it was only grace that can get
[30:21] us through those trials we're not immune
[30:24] as Christians we're not immune to
[30:27] trouble sometimes we think well I'm a
[30:30] Christian now why does trouble come or
[30:32] what is this you're you're under Adams
[30:35] fallen race and so troubles going to
[30:40] come but God said I'll be with you in
[30:43] trouble
[30:46] young lady in an accident 16 years old
[30:51] and gone to be with the Lord it took all
[30:57] of her breath many of you no doubt wept
[30:59] and cried
[31:00] we've sick cards and different things
[31:03] just to try to encourage and strengthen
[31:07] we're a body of believers no matter
[31:10] where we're at we're a body of believers
[31:13] and we stand strong together but whether
[31:17] we realize that not like my mother or
[31:19] brother Homer or many of our loved ones
[31:21] that came here that last breath here was
[31:24] the first breath there are you with me
[31:31] we look at things in the mortal realm
[31:33] God looks at completely different he
[31:35] knew what they would come on the earth
[31:37] and what they would leave it's not a
[31:40] time to stop and get mad at God because
[31:42] we have troubles it's time to stop and
[31:45] commit our troubles to God and say God
[31:48] you promised that you'd get me over this
[31:51] mountain you take me through this valley
[31:55] hallelujah are you getting
[32:08] when a man is inspired and he reached
[32:11] the reeds he inspired words the two
[32:15] inspirations together gives a result I
[32:21] want to read that again when a man is
[32:24] written spired and he reads the inspired
[32:28] word the two inspirations together gives
[32:33] a result no matter how well did you
[32:40] study the work it'll never do you any
[32:43] good till you're inspired yourself how
[32:51] many of you have ever in the morning
[32:52] you've just got an issue coming that day
[32:54] and you come to your you come to your
[32:57] daily Scripture and write laid before
[32:59] you is the answer I'll never forget I
[33:10] was in I was in an airport one day and I
[33:13] was standing there and they had canceled
[33:15] my flight I was standing there and when
[33:19] they canceled my flight they told me
[33:21] they said you're going to be several
[33:23] hours before you'll be able to leave I
[33:25] was young and tribal didn't understand
[33:27] everything just because you're a
[33:30] passenger don't mean you can fly the
[33:31] plane don't mean that you can make the
[33:35] scheduled you're just at their mercy and
[33:38] so I was kind of aggravated about it I
[33:41] was kind of like you aggravated about
[33:43] some of the situations that had found
[33:45] myself in I walked man I walked into a
[33:47] store walked into a little bookstore
[33:49] there I walked up to a certain religious
[33:52] counter I was looking it was books all
[33:54] away from the ceiling to the one and I
[33:56] just looked right straight in front of
[33:57] me and I pulled a little old bitty book
[33:59] out and I opened it up to a certain page
[34:02] and this certain page it was the right
[34:04] hand side of the page said you're
[34:06] standing in the airport and they
[34:08] cancelled your flight and you think
[34:13] god don't know you're standing there
[34:16] he's got a plan in your life I bought
[34:19] the book I bought the book I don't know
[34:33] about you but sometimes I'm driving down
[34:35] the road and there's a scripture up on
[34:36] the up on the sign I don't know who had
[34:39] the inspiration to put it there but
[34:40] sometimes the scripture on that sign
[34:42] responds to the need that I got going on
[34:44] right now
[34:47] sometimes I'm listening to enlighten on
[34:49] the radio and all of a sudden they're
[34:51] singing a song I'm a soldier in the army
[34:55] of the Lord what we need today is an
[35:05] inspiration over us God's sweeping down
[35:08] with a new inspiration breathing over us
[35:10] his power his love and himself that
[35:14] might inspire us to quicken and awaken
[35:16] us to his word and then the word being
[35:18] brought into that spirit of inspiration
[35:20] then you'll see miracles happen and
[35:24] things play take place because - just
[35:28] comes together listen some miracles you
[35:34] can measure by a wheelchair or cancer
[35:37] being set free but some miracles are
[35:41] just daily miracles some miracles are
[35:48] just daily miracles not earth-shaking
[35:51] but you know that you know that God
[35:53] worked that out somebody ought to help
[35:57] me preach right here you know that you
[36:00] know that you know that God worked that
[36:03] out
[36:14] this is either the word of God or it's a
[36:19] deceiving book it's either right or it's
[36:25] wrong every word of God is inspired or
[36:33] none of them is inspired
[36:36] we heard about a woman that she sent
[36:40] away to her son a letter and he was in
[36:43] Bible School and she sent this letter
[36:47] and told him that she had cancer didn't
[36:49] have long to live and she just kind of
[36:52] sent some things along that look that
[36:54] thing and don't you don't need to come
[36:56] home and that kind of a thing and just
[36:58] told him she didn't have long to live
[37:00] remember her in prayer I'm not going
[37:02] into all that but it heretofore but
[37:08] let's fill in the blank read the random
[37:11] said there was some sisters from a local
[37:13] church came back down to see her and
[37:17] they believed that God would confirm his
[37:19] word and and they had a pastor that
[37:22] would come and anoint with all and she'd
[37:24] get well so she said yes sure
[37:29] and so that pastor came anointed her in
[37:32] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[37:33] read to her from mark chapter 16 and the
[37:37] words in Isaiah 53 and she just got well
[37:43] her son came about six months later and
[37:46] they begin to talk and have a discussion
[37:48] and he's coming home from Bible School
[37:51] in seminary and he said by the way mom I
[37:54] got a letter about six months from a
[37:56] gold from you that that you were sick
[37:58] and nine to death and she said yes and
[38:00] she began to fill in the blank for him
[38:02] that Amanda that sisters came and the
[38:05] pastor came and anointed me with all and
[38:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[38:10] get well and he said well mom we learned
[38:13] in the seminary that those words are not
[38:16] inspired and she started dancing
[38:19] all over the place and and he finally
[38:22] got her settled down and he said she
[38:24] said what's wrong mom she said he Majan
[38:27] dis if God could do that with the
[38:30] uninspired part imagine what he could do
[38:34] with the inspired part you know there
[38:48] was a woman that would showed up at a
[38:50] Baptist Church she was a little bit
[38:53] emotional I shared this at Saskatoon and
[38:57] she was a bit emotional and she was
[39:00] sitting back there and the preacher said
[39:03] something good enough for an a man and
[39:04] she screamed amen and the D contact us
[39:07] if we don't do that here that's for a
[39:10] while she said hallelujah wasn't no
[39:13] wonderful and the big contactor again
[39:15] said we don't do that here and after a
[39:18] while she's saying praise the Lord
[39:19] hallelujah and they told her said you
[39:21] got to settle down and after a while she
[39:23] was beyond help and he walked over said
[39:25] what in the world's wrong with you she
[39:27] said I got the Holy Ghost he said you
[39:29] didn't get to hear one more to go with
[39:40] that brother Graham said him that this
[39:42] couple that had a daddy that was one of
[39:44] them you know one them full of the Holy
[39:47] Ghost status and he was all the time
[39:50] emotion they were steeping him in their
[39:52] home and he'd get emotional he'd get to
[39:54] read in his Bible and he did the
[39:55] shouting and he'd get to dancing you
[39:57] know what we ought to be doing and
[39:59] they'd get to dance and he'd get to
[40:00] shouting and they were going to have a
[40:03] social that's their house and they
[40:04] thought well you know we got to do
[40:05] something daddy so they took him up in
[40:09] need they took his Bible and they took
[40:11] his books and and then they put him up
[40:14] in the attic and have give him a chair
[40:16] where he'd be comfortable and they were
[40:18] having their social party going almost
[40:19] sudden there's a party going on upstairs
[40:22] and and she went up and she said daddy I
[40:28] your Bible I took your books what in the
[40:30] world cost you be emotional he said I
[40:32] got to look it around here and I got
[40:36] this book here that tells me about
[40:40] oceans and it says that there's no
[40:43] bottom they can't find the bottom to
[40:48] some of those oceans and the scripture
[40:52] said that God casts my sin into the
[40:55] bottom of the sea Alleluia don't you
[41:12] love the Lord because I live you shall
[41:21] live also my life will be in you the
[41:26] works that I do you'll do also the
[41:35] church has got to get to that place too
[41:37] and he promised it would do it and it
[41:44] will it's got to come that way that's
[41:48] what takes place we got to be that way
[41:53] wouldn't it would be wonderful if all
[41:56] the people could just take that attitude
[41:58] don't question if God said so that
[42:01] settles it
[42:05] well brother on that's easy for you to
[42:07] say really God tells me I'm his son that
[42:14] should settle the issue of the wrestling
[42:18] match
[42:22] so how many times that's the enemy
[42:26] wrestle with you you're back sweet God
[42:28] don't love you come on somebody preach
[42:30] with me if you two prayed more if you'da
[42:35] studied more if you don't you didn't
[42:42] feel nothing tonight you almost went to
[42:44] sleep in church really well you're in
[42:46] good company you didn't get nothing out
[42:51] of church just wait a little more not
[42:54] I'm gonna go right back tomorrow night
[42:56] believe that God's gonna come down and
[42:58] feel my cup so full it'll overflow down
[43:01] though through the saucer down over the
[43:03] table now we get what we expect we get
[43:17] what we expect are you with me same
[43:25] church few weeks later we didn't have to
[43:28] come two hours early to get our seat but
[43:33] it's the same God
[43:36] it's the same God he's the same word are
[43:46] you with me we experienced something
[43:49] from with people from Pennsylvania South
[43:51] Carolina Louisiana all are you with me
[43:54] now and they came in they gathered and
[43:56] we were able to host them while Jesus
[43:59] came and spoke to us along the way we
[44:02] took from those services and he made us
[44:04] better Christians and strengthened for
[44:06] the journey but we needed to refill and
[44:10] so we come back and are opposed to
[44:11] booted are you with me tonight and we
[44:17] stand strong if God said so that's it if
[44:30] God said there will be a resurrection I
[44:36] don't need a scientific formula to try
[44:41] to figure out the timing or the date or
[44:43] how it's going to happen but this mortal
[44:46] will take on immortality and will be
[44:49] changed in the moment and the twinkle of
[44:52] an eye God said so I take him at his
[44:54] word and I believe it
[45:05] paranoia there's people in Israel
[45:13] looking for a messiah to return God will
[45:16] send them to prophets they'll preach to
[45:19] them the message of the hour that you
[45:21] and I have overcome in this day they
[45:24] will hear the voice that will get them
[45:26] ready for the Messiah the same as this
[45:29] message got you ready for the rapture
[45:31] and the coming of the Lord Jesus turned
[45:37] there in the first scripture that we
[45:38] talked about John came
[45:41] John did come you received John but a
[45:44] greater than John a greater than Solomon
[45:48] is here brother Branham preached a
[45:49] greater than Solomon is here 23 times
[45:52] God's greater than prophets he's greater
[45:55] than Kings is greater than potentates
[45:57] and he is the author and the finisher
[45:59] our faith he is the important one here
[46:04] tonight he's never on vacation he's
[46:08] never ladies always old to him and he's
[46:13] my god glory
[46:30] God said so that settles it if God said
[46:34] that did that makes it rot he's the
[46:39] final voice of all on earth of all
[46:43] authority he has all authority and
[46:45] everything God has the supreme authority
[46:51] with God in his words he don't negotiate
[47:00] he said wouldn't you like to live where
[47:03] you're just conscious that the unseen
[47:06] world is right with you all the time
[47:10] notice these words to realize when you
[47:13] walk out here and get in your car angels
[47:17] take their position by the side of you
[47:22] when you walk up yonder to that man so
[47:29] unleavened ly to you that the Holy
[47:32] Spirit is standing right above you and
[47:34] the angels are all around you the Bible
[47:40] said that angels of God are compassed
[47:42] our contempt about those I want you to
[47:46] just notice these words the angels of
[47:49] God a camped about those they don't go
[47:54] back to heaven they camp here they camp
[48:01] here you are better protected than
[48:05] Donald Trump
[48:11] you are better protected than Donald
[48:14] Trump
[48:17] you're better protected than Ronald
[48:19] Reagan or Obama or Bill Clinton or any
[48:22] of those guys you're better protected
[48:24] with a man that came here to church with
[48:27] us and you didn't know it I knew it but
[48:29] you didn't know it but he was a suit a
[48:31] Secret Service guard of the vice
[48:34] president of the United States said in
[48:36] his church for many years and many of
[48:39] you didn't know it he would have give
[48:43] his life for the president hey buddy
[48:47] give his life for the vice president but
[48:53] there's things he couldn't see there's
[48:57] things he couldn't see but let me just
[49:02] say this you my guards see it off ain't
[49:14] that good ain't it good take your
[49:16] neighbor ain't that good ain't it good
[49:18] ain't it good
[49:22] so the ladder that you two bumped your
[49:24] head on he moves you over the car wreck
[49:32] the mixed up doctor's report
[49:34] are you with me now oh brother on but
[49:41] you don't know what I went through you
[49:43] don't know what you've been kept from
[49:46] [Applause]
[49:57] we got schoolteachers sitting here too
[49:59] not in about 15 minutes they could give
[50:03] us a report on things that our children
[50:06] don't have to go through there's
[50:11] children live in horror stories and
[50:14] these girls are the best part of those
[50:18] children's life come on church your home
[50:27] is a home of peace and a blob and a
[50:30] sound man are you with me God provides
[50:35] food on their tables and he's given you
[50:37] so many good things around your life and
[50:40] he gives you stability you don't have to
[50:46] own ten million dollar house or drive a
[50:48] Mercedes Benz I want you to understand
[50:51] God is good all the time
[51:05] our children are blessed because we are
[51:08] blessed our children live under a token
[51:11] that watches over our lives our children
[51:14] come to church and maybe don't realize
[51:17] what is going on around them but this
[51:20] word is a protector this word is a
[51:25] sustainer this word is filled with
[51:28] phenomenal promises to it the Ron I
[51:32] can't explain it all don't need to just
[51:34] say I believe it
[51:37] they don't mean we're mindless bodies to
[51:40] wear that we've got no right to choose
[51:43] but I take God at His Word and I believe
[51:46] it give you one more example when you
[51:53] was a child you thought your daddy was
[51:55] the greatest in the world had the
[51:57] biggest shoulders he had the curliest
[51:59] hair every one of us had the same
[52:01] philosophy my daddy never lies he never
[52:04] tells any stories I hope he was raised
[52:06] in that kind of a home brother BAM said
[52:10] he looked up his father and he said I
[52:11] looked at his big brawny shoulders had
[52:13] two big long curls and he said he said
[52:16] my daddy will live forever you see he
[52:20] was a child
[52:21] and Jesus said except you become as a
[52:24] little child you'll not inherit the
[52:25] kingdom of ever all I know is this I've
[52:29] got an eternal Papa and I came from him
[52:33] and I'm going back to him and when I
[52:36] can't hold myself up he holds a hold of
[52:39] me and in the darkness of my knots that
[52:43] I have to go through when I can't see
[52:46] another foot in front of me I can't see
[52:48] my hand in front of me he's got ahold of
[52:50] my hand when I can't feel him
[52:58] and I can't hear him and none of my
[53:01] senses tell me that he's there his word
[53:07] yes word is enough his word is enough if
[53:32] I told you after church to not to meet
[53:34] me at the back door you know the kind of
[53:36] man that I am
[53:38] you found me to be honest
[53:40] you found me to be transparent you found
[53:44] me a man to not not be wavery and I made
[53:50] you a promise that I'll meet you at the
[53:52] back door and give you this certain
[53:53] amount of money when the service closed
[54:00] you would be under expectation to walk
[54:04] out that door because I've been honest
[54:10] I've been faithful I've stood sure now
[54:14] if I would make you that kind of a
[54:16] promise what about God
[54:21] what about God God makes you promise and
[54:29] sometimes I just wonder at this we in
[54:32] our crazy human minds try to figure out
[54:36] God and we can't I feel afford our meal
[54:42] tomorrow and we try to figure out God
[54:52] when we first started out brother Denny
[54:55] we couldn't afford what we had one time
[55:01] I I remember as a boy we were Kanye and
[55:05] I were up against it and I didn't have
[55:08] gas money to get get to even to work I
[55:12] called my grandmother and I said I don't
[55:17] know I don't know how we got here we're
[55:20] doing the best that we can but I don't
[55:22] have gas money to even get to work if
[55:24] I'm get to work I I'm not gonna be able
[55:27] to get next week's pay my grandmother
[55:31] said well I don't have any cash but if
[55:33] you pray I love these words but if you
[55:37] pray I'll go look in my pocketbook
[55:41] I love those words if you pray
[55:46] I'll go look in my pocketbook and she
[55:50] came out of the door and she went one of
[55:52] them it was all all excited all the time
[55:54] but when she came out of the door and
[55:56] she waited she was about five foot tall
[55:58] weighed about 240 250 and a good good
[56:01] good nice day and she came out waving
[56:07] that twenty dollar bill
[56:09] she knew it wasn't in there but we had a
[56:13] host of a channel that knew how to put
[56:15] it there
[56:25] so many times after day after years and
[56:28] years and years of serving God don't you
[56:30] never forget where he brought you from
[56:33] don't never forget where he brought you
[56:35] from are you with me now and what he
[56:38] kept you from
[56:39] oh brother Rania no bro run you know
[56:42] what he saved me from you've only got
[56:44] part of the picture it's not just what
[56:46] he saved you from it's what he kept you
[56:48] from because from 21 22 to 58 years old
[56:58] in sin I was a mass but from 21 22 years
[57:03] old of 58 years old
[57:05] I can say he's Catalan he's watched over
[57:08] me he's protected me could you say
[57:21] that's true with my life too brother Roy
[57:26] can you say that's true with my life
[57:28] let's stand to our feet tonight
[57:41] can I kind of use you - guys just for a
[57:44] moment can I use you - guys just for a
[57:46] moment
