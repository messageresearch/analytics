[29:26] that he did he was able to go home I
[29:29] believe it was Wednesday morning and
[29:31] he's in recovery now he seems like he's
[29:33] doing a little bit better I still don't
[29:34] know all the details but I want to thank
[29:36] God that he came on the scene and he
[29:38] took care of it when we we really didn't
[29:40] know what was going on but he knew
[29:42] better and he's always in control
[29:46] [Music]
[29:50] well he created heaven he made the Earth
[29:54] he made the light he told son to Rule
[29:58] the Day and the moon to rule the night
[30:01] he made the mighty rivers flow he made
[30:06] [Music]
[30:07] the living creature and a man to roll
[30:11] them all and when he saw that what he
[30:14] made was working like it should he made
[30:18] an observation and he said that it was
[30:21] good and I was looking through the
[30:25] scriptures I can see it was so true yes
[30:29] he said I Am The Great I Am there's
[30:32] nothing I can do he can't heal them
[30:35] blinded eyes yes he made the name to you
[30:38] all and he can make the death to hear
[30:41] and he made a dumb to talk he never
[30:45] stopped at anything that got into
[30:49] he's still in charge and in control of
[30:52] everything today
[30:55] praise the god that made his Universe it
[30:58] when all the stars in space and is he
[31:02] working miracles as I can see it all
[31:04] over the place where he's not The God
[31:07] Who one time did but he's the God who
[31:10] does that is why they call him The Great
[31:13] I Am he's not the great I was
[31:17] we can't move the mighty mountain with
[31:20] the sound of just his voice and he can't
[31:24] stop the sun or moon if ever it's his
[31:27] choice oh he is that great position when
[31:30] they've given up on you and he's just
[31:34] getting started when they've done all
[31:37] they can do he is a god of Moses he's
[31:41] the god of Abraham he is the one and
[31:45] only God he is a great I am
[31:48] [Music]

[32:02] he's
[32:04] [Music]
[32:07] not the great I was
[32:10] [Music]
[32:11] looking through the scriptures I can see
[32:15] so true oh he said I Am The Great I Am
[32:19] there's nothing I can do he can heal
[32:23] them blinded eyes yes he made lame to
[32:26] you all and he can make the death to
[32:29] hear he made it down to talk he never
[32:33] stopped at anything that got into his
[32:37] way way still in charge and in control
[32:40] of all he made today
[32:43] as he's a God he made his Universe he
[32:47] put all the stars in space and he still
[32:50] work in Miracles I can see it all over
[32:53] the place well he's not the guy who
[32:56] wanted he's the God who does that is why

[42:05] time brother team and myself it's our
[42:07] first time yeah it's it's so safe
[42:09] because of the convention hall that I
[42:11] got is inside the military headquarters
[42:16] but it didn't happen
[42:19] I know God is our absolute and he has
[42:22] perfect will in everything so I told
[42:24] Brother Rune I have a mission in coming
[42:26] over here because we have unfinished
[42:28] business
[42:31] amen so all right so the Lord is great
[42:37] just respect and uh so without further
[42:40] Ado I would like to
[42:42] bring you
[42:44] to the scriptures directly let us open
[42:47] our Bibles in Ephesians chapter 2. some
[42:50] familiar scriptures and quotation thank
[42:54] you so much musicians
[42:57] amen so Ephesians chapter 2 we start
[42:59] from verse 1 up to six
[43:03] in verse 1 it says and you hat he
[43:05] quickened
[43:07] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[43:10] we're in in time past you walked
[43:13] according to the course of this world
[43:15] according to the prince of the power of
[43:18] the air
[43:19] the spirit that now worketh in the
[43:21] children of disobedience
[43:23] among whom also we all had our
[43:26] conversation in times past in the last
[43:29] of our flesh
[43:30] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[43:33] of the mind and where by Nature
[43:37] the children of brat even as others so
[43:41] when we speak about by Nature it's our
[43:43] natural birth
[43:45] and uh but God who is rich in Mercy
[43:50] for his great love
[43:52] where we he loved us even when we were
[43:55] dead in sins had quickened us together
[43:58] with Christ
[43:59] by Grace ye are saved and had raised us
[44:04] up together and made us sit together in
[44:07] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus let's
[44:11] move on to another scripture let's read
[44:14] from the book of Romans chapter 12.
[44:18] in verse 2.
[44:21] it says and be not conformed to this
[44:24] world
[44:25] but be it transformed by the renewing of
[44:29] your mind
[44:30] that he may prove what is that good and
[44:35] acceptable and perfect will of God amen
[44:39] may the Lord add blessing to his word
[44:42] dear heavenly father
[44:43] we are helpless without you
[44:47] we cannot speak anything
[44:50] unless you say it Lord and may your mind
[44:54] that is perfect
[44:56] be upon us this evening and we have
[44:59] great respect for you your presence
[45:02] in uh your people that are here they
[45:07] have come with expectation
[45:09] and I believe lord they're not looking
[45:12] at the men
[45:14] but they're looking all of us are
[45:16] looking who's using the man Lord this
[45:18] evening so God we thank you and we
[45:21] commit the rest of the service into your
[45:23] Mighty hands in Jesus Christ's wonderful
[45:25] name and everybody say Amen tonight amen
[45:28] God bless you amen so thank you so much
[45:32] amen so
[45:34] uh special greetings from my uh little
[45:38] congregation back there in Metro Manila
[45:40] it's called Capstone Believers worldwide
[45:43] missions amen and my wife says hello to
[45:47] Sister Connie amen and uh to all of you
[45:51] Amen brother thank you so much and
[45:54] brother Andrew my son Paolo said Papa
[45:57] just although uh brother Andrew don't
[46:02] know me just greet him for me
[46:05] amen so I said them don't worry I'm
[46:07] going to bring Andrew to the Philippines
[46:09] soon
[46:11] amen so amen
[46:19] I feel some approval here
[46:22] amen so I want to speak just a simple
[46:26] thought this evening amen and uh
[46:30] so this is not the new scripture but I
[46:32] would like to uh give a title breaking
[46:37] the wrong cycle
[46:39] amen and the opposite of that is going
[46:42] back to God's cycle
[46:44] because there's only one perfect cycle
[46:47] and that's the cycle of God Amen the
[46:50] realm of God Amen and the realm will
[46:53] where nothing is impossible
[46:57] amen but you go lower than that amen and
[47:01] everything is you know uh
[47:04] uh the devil has an opportunity now in
[47:08] in verse when he says and you and I
[47:09] believe uh Paul is speaking directly to
[47:13] the predestinated Sons and Daughters of
[47:16] God Amen so this is directly addressed
[47:19] to Those whom he saw before the
[47:23] foundation of the world and they were
[47:26] part of him amen and you had he
[47:29] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[47:32] and sins amen we're in in time past he
[47:36] walked according to the course of this
[47:39] world Amen so this is the wrong cycle
[47:41] the course of this world this is the
[47:43] wrong cycle and you know just like this
[47:46] clock over here when you say you know
[47:49] you go on a clockwise meaning the arm is
[47:52] going the way the direction of the clock
[47:55] is going but when you go counterclock it
[47:58] is opposite the right direction all
[48:01] right and then you're going back amen so
[48:04] the the perfect cycle is to keep on
[48:07] moving
[48:08] amen now you see we're in in time pass
[48:11] you walked according to the course of
[48:13] this word according to the prince of the
[48:15] power of the air the spirit that now
[48:17] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[48:20] amen we are not children of Disobedience
[48:23] amen but because of sin because of
[48:26] unbelief because of the spiritual
[48:28] Amnesia we became disobedient
[48:31] amen but praise God by the message of
[48:34] the hour he opened our eyes of
[48:37] understanding amen and and uh take away
[48:41] the veil amen and took away the veil and
[48:45] then we realized who we are and then
[48:48] when we re we realize who we are then
[48:50] there's nothing new with that we just go
[48:53] back where we come from
[48:55] amen and when we realize who we are and
[48:58] and we go back to where we come from
[49:00] then we know how we conduct ourselves we
[49:03] know how to walk in this world how we
[49:05] know how we witness in this world
[49:08] Hallelujah and we know that we're
[49:09] different from the rest of the world in
[49:11] verse 3 among also we all had our
[49:13] conversation in time passed in the last
[49:15] of the flesh fulfilling the desires of
[49:18] the Flesh and the mind and where by
[49:20] Nature the children who brought even as
[49:23] others
[49:24] and now in verse words started to be the
[49:27] conjunction but
[49:29] amen and so when you use the word but it
[49:32] is going in contrast with something amen
[49:37] it is opposite so in times past we're
[49:40] going in this in this certain direction
[49:41] but
[49:43] amen so that word is just a three-letter
[49:47] word but it has a lot of meaning in it
[49:49] and then he said but God who is rich in
[49:52] Mercy for his great love were with he
[49:55] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[49:59] amen because this world Amen there's no
[50:03] other direction but death amen Bob God
[50:07] who's rich in Mercy
[50:09] brought us back to something amen so but
[50:13] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[50:15] lover with he loved us even when we were
[50:18] dead and sins have quickened us together
[50:19] with Christ now when we talk about Grace
[50:22] here it is even when we were dead even
[50:25] when we are living without knowing who
[50:28] we are and who our real father is and
[50:32] yet there is a pair of eyes watching
[50:34] over us
[50:35] but because of his love and because of
[50:38] his Rich Mercy
[50:40] amen and so he's six in six and had
[50:44] raised us up together and made us sit
[50:46] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[50:48] Jesus amen so we without God's Rich
[50:52] Mercy everything is just falling down
[50:56] amen because of the the gravitational
[50:59] pull it's but natural that everything
[51:02] you throw up it will go down
[51:04] amen but God who is rich in Mercy our
[51:08] direction is not going down but we're
[51:11] going up
[51:12] amen and so that's why in 12 verse 2 of
[51:15] Roman he said and be not conformed to
[51:18] this world but be transformed by the
[51:22] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[51:24] what is that good and acceptable and
[51:28] perfect will of God
[51:30] amen so we fully understand that there
[51:33] is a permissive will and a perfect will
[51:37] amen and when we enter into the
[51:41] permissible there's always a consequence
[51:43] with that because it's always going
[51:46] against the perfect will
[51:48] amen but God was rich in Mercy sometimes
[51:51] he allows for you know he permits things
[51:54] to happen that along the way we realize
[51:57] how God loved us so much and then
[51:59] because of that great love and we
[52:01] realize that God's mercy amen you know
[52:05] it brings us back
[52:07] amen so now before I go further I just
[52:10] want to to speak something from the
[52:12] natural because brother said to fully
[52:14] understand the spiritual we better
[52:16] understand the natural things amen so uh
[52:20] brother Brian I mean in here talking
[52:22] about nature it's mentioned in the
[52:24] scripture on nature uh in the in the
[52:28] message the spoken word is the Original
[52:29] Seed he said Christ couldn't help being
[52:32] what he was he was this son of God
[52:35] that's it see what I mean if you were
[52:37] intended to see the word of God you
[52:40] believe it because why
[52:42] there's something new have you ever
[52:45] heard of a strain in a family
[52:48] amen so there's a strain in the family
[52:50] and he said one Islam will kind of
[52:53] impersonate his father or mother or the
[52:55] grandfather the grandmother that strain
[52:57] in the family you've heard it meaning
[52:59] the strain in the family something that
[53:01] is being passed on from from one
[53:03] generation to another
[53:05] amen so your father is like this so
[53:07] that's why you're like that your mother
[53:09] is like this that's why you're like that
[53:11] amen so it's just a strain amen and it
[53:15] it's a strained that that speaks of our
[53:18] natural lineage
[53:20] there's no hope in that
[53:22] amen so there has to be a power there
[53:25] has to be a transforming power to pick
[53:27] us up Amen to break that lineage amen
[53:31] because uh you know I grew up I grew up
[53:34] in a I grew up in a family uh
[53:37] my uh
[53:40] on my father's side my father lives in a
[53:44] in a city in Manila it's called tondo
[53:47] and tondo in the Philippines is popular
[53:50] it's like Bronx
[53:52] you know we're
[53:54] I'm not saying against uh your City
[53:57] Bronx or something but you know in the
[54:00] Philippines you know this is the place
[54:02] where gangsters you know Hood looms they
[54:06] live in that and my father grew in that
[54:09] place and uh of course
[54:12] uh so I'm not ashamed
[54:16] to say but because my father grew in
[54:20] that uh in grew in that place Amen in
[54:23] that City amen
[54:25] he lived like the rest of those people
[54:28] there
[54:30] amen his illness brother is among the
[54:33] gangsters and he was about to inherit
[54:37] that position amen and so
[54:40] if I live there
[54:43] you know uh it doesn't matter about my
[54:47] size amen but I'm going to inherit a
[54:51] certain position in that lineage and
[54:54] where would I be
[54:55] amen
[54:57] but God by his grace and mercy took me
[55:00] out of that
[55:03] and
[55:04] brought me
[55:07] from another Direction
[55:09] amen and so I was the first believer
[55:14] in my family
[55:15] I was the first one who heard this
[55:17] message Amen brother Ron uh hit the
[55:21] right question how did you receive the
[55:22] message brother Danny amen it's my wife
[55:27] because my wife's father
[55:30] was among the Pioneer ministers in the
[55:33] message in the Philippines
[55:35] and so
[55:38] uh so that was something no a call where
[55:43] God started to change the course
[55:46] I didn't realize that amen I didn't
[55:49] realize that I just you know I caught
[55:51] somebody a woman you know I I I've been
[55:54] uh I've been out there in the world
[55:57] although you know I've been with with
[55:59] women who cut their hairs and you know
[56:02] everything you know and then I come here
[56:04] is it it's another Direction
[56:07] yeah it's a cycle something has to be
[56:10] broken you know but but you know but
[56:13] deep inside because we were Sons and
[56:14] Daughters of God the seed in US
[56:16] recognized I didn't realize that but
[56:19] there is some kind there was some kind
[56:21] of an attraction amen hallelujah and God
[56:25] took that attraction amen so and so that
[56:29] I will be in that in this lineage in
[56:33] this course
[56:33] amen be so now that's on on one side on
[56:37] the left side on my mother's side my
[56:40] uncles and you know their drunkards they
[56:43] they can drink from night till morning
[56:46] amen and they could not even make it at
[56:51] home you know just just fall just right
[56:54] on the gate because they're so drunk
[56:57] amen and so uh I I grew up in that
[57:01] condition that when people are happy
[57:03] they drink when people are lonely they
[57:06] drink
[57:08] so I knew that was life then so at that
[57:11] time in my young age when I was happy I
[57:14] drink
[57:15] when I'm lonely I also drink I was in
[57:18] that cycle amen but God who is rich in
[57:21] Mercy
[57:24] amen so you see this this is that kind
[57:28] of strain in the family it's hard to
[57:30] break you know you want to change your
[57:32] direction but sometimes there is some
[57:35] kind of a pull and you're just going
[57:37] back there amen but there is a
[57:40] supernatural power amen that when when
[57:43] that one works amen the Lord is the one
[57:47] working on it amen so now barabena made
[57:51] mention of that of that guy I'm not
[57:53] going to uh to read all but this this
[57:56] guy he wanted to get married and brother
[57:58] Branham said you know when when when
[58:00] when this guy you are you are born again
[58:03] you're born again you know uh one is
[58:05] German and the other is Irish
[58:08] both of them they have strain in the
[58:10] family and so that's why you know their
[58:12] son you know he he could he don't know
[58:15] how to say I'm sorry
[58:18] because he's very strong you know and
[58:20] brother randoms knew that he was not
[58:22] converted yet and he wanted to get
[58:25] married and brother Branham said you
[58:27] know you know you see
[58:30] I advise that young man to never marry a
[58:33] woman that's right he will make hell on
[58:36] Earth for her until that gentle sweet
[58:39] forgiving Spirit Christ comes in then
[58:42] that will be a paradox in itself to take
[58:44] the very nature of a boy that's bred
[58:46] between father and mother and yet in his
[58:48] intellect was his strength to his best
[58:50] to overcome it he can do it
[58:53] he will never become it overcome it
[58:56] Christ will have to overcome it when he
[58:59] lets Christ in then he is already
[59:02] overcome then it will be a perfect
[59:05] Paradox when man is born of the spirit
[59:08] of God that makes the difference amen so
[59:13] now there's scripture on that and let me
[59:15] put some scripture on it to back it up
[59:17] now you know in Genesis chapter 20 we
[59:20] know uh when the word of God came to
[59:22] Abraham they were well-stricken in age
[59:26] this is not something new but let's just
[59:28] be reminded you know that Abraham was
[59:32] promised with a son
[59:34] and he will be the father of many
[59:36] nations
[59:37] amen that's the word of God
[59:40] and you cannot add you cannot diminish
[59:42] anything from it that's it
[59:45] amen but when people try to interpret
[59:48] that especially the woman interprets the
[59:51] word
[59:52] amen so when when uh uh when when Sarah
[59:58] you know tried to interpret that word
[1:00:01] and he said you know it's it's a wrong
[1:00:04] cycle
[1:00:06] because only the man can preach the word
[1:00:10] amen but when you know the woman started
[1:00:14] to preach look Abraham
[1:00:17] see
[1:00:18] you know look at me
[1:00:20] I'm old I'm young and my womb is dry
[1:00:24] I cannot give you a son
[1:00:26] but perhaps you're the same father
[1:00:30] look at that woman down there she's
[1:00:32] young she's beautiful
[1:00:34] amen you can take her with my approval
[1:00:37] with my consent at least that will the
[1:00:40] word of God will be fulfilled
[1:00:43] all right
[1:00:45] and Abraham said amen
[1:00:49] so when he said amen that broke
[1:00:55] the cycle
[1:00:57] God was working on it because
[1:01:01] he spoke it
[1:01:03] and one guy when God speaks
[1:01:09] he's obligated to his word
[1:01:12] amen no one is
[1:01:15] God should interpret his word because
[1:01:17] God is obligated to his word amen and so
[1:01:21] now when they and we will see even
[1:01:24] though it was not the perfect will it
[1:01:27] has a result
[1:01:29] and so that's why people has a
[1:01:32] misconception of something oh you know
[1:01:34] you see I have planned I have done all
[1:01:36] these things and it's gaining good
[1:01:38] result
[1:01:39] amen so because Ishmael was born
[1:01:44] the expectation was there and so they
[1:01:48] thought it was the will of the Lord
[1:01:50] until the consequence came in
[1:01:54] Hallelujah amen so you see now but prior
[1:01:59] to that you know Abraham you know before
[1:02:01] before they did it uh we see everything
[1:02:04] they were old and stricken in AIDS and
[1:02:07] uh uh you see but when when they realize
[1:02:11] it's not the perfect will of the Lord
[1:02:16] and so when uh I believe that's in
[1:02:19] Genesis Chapter 18 when when Elohim
[1:02:21] visited Abraham
[1:02:23] and the Lord called him
[1:02:26] Abraham
[1:02:28] and she called her Sarah
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:33] when
[1:02:34] he was Abram
[1:02:38] he was well-stricken in age
[1:02:41] when she was Sarai
[1:02:44] she could not
[1:02:45] give her give him a son
[1:02:48] because of the physical manifestation
[1:02:52] amen they were in a wrong cycle
[1:02:57] but when Elohim came
[1:03:02] and he was going to fulfill his own word
[1:03:06] he's going to interpret his own word
[1:03:10] you know God's interpretation of his own
[1:03:12] word doesn't need so much explanation
[1:03:15] amen God's interpretation of his own
[1:03:18] word is the Fulfillment of his word when
[1:03:21] it's being fulfilled that's the
[1:03:23] interpretation of that and so God said
[1:03:26] you know and and and and he called him
[1:03:28] Abraham and Abraham realized it was the
[1:03:31] same man because he was the one that
[1:03:33] changed his name from Abram to Abraham
[1:03:38] amen and so God Amen took a part of
[1:03:42] himself
[1:03:44] I'm going to visit you according to the
[1:03:46] time of life
[1:03:48] Elohim was life
[1:03:50] and so that's why Abraham became Abraham
[1:03:54] Sarai becomes Sarah
[1:03:57] amen it is a breath of life ha
[1:04:01] that's why we say hallelujah
[1:04:04] amen when a baby is born he said
[1:04:08] amen when a man is born again he said
[1:04:11] hallelujah amen because that part of
[1:04:15] God's life is being connected with this
[1:04:18] natural life then amen so now from Abram
[1:04:21] to Abraham God was breaking now the
[1:04:24] wrong cycle amen they were going down
[1:04:27] even because they are well stricken in
[1:04:29] age but when they took the word of God
[1:04:33] amen when even not only Abraham but even
[1:04:36] Sarah believed God now amen so that's
[1:04:39] why it's very important that the man and
[1:04:40] the woman should agree amen should have
[1:04:43] the same belief and so when both of them
[1:04:45] believe the word of God God changed the
[1:04:48] course amen they were going down they
[1:04:52] were going down but when they took the
[1:04:54] word of God they walked amen and little
[1:04:56] by little it broke the wrong cycle
[1:04:58] straightened them up amen hallelujah and
[1:05:01] went to the next Kingdom to the kingdom
[1:05:04] of
[1:05:05] amen and so that's why we know that
[1:05:08] abimelech didn't say a grandmother he
[1:05:11] saw a beautiful young woman
[1:05:13] amen because God has entered in and
[1:05:17] changed the cycle back
[1:05:21] proving that there's Life coming in
[1:05:25] Hallelujah they didn't have to interpret
[1:05:27] they didn't have to make a remedy
[1:05:31] for God's word because God is obligated
[1:05:34] to his own word
[1:05:36] amen hallelujah
[1:05:39] but now when they entered into the
[1:05:41] kingdom
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] everything was
[1:05:48] beautiful and then but when they are
[1:05:52] approaching the the gate
[1:05:55] Sarah noticed something in Abraham
[1:05:59] Abraham
[1:06:02] you look younger than yesterday
[1:06:09] and Abraham look at Sarah and said Sarah
[1:06:11] you too
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:16] but then
[1:06:18] something happened
[1:06:21] now it's Abraham
[1:06:23] and said Sarah
[1:06:27] when the king asked you
[1:06:31] don't tell him I am your husband
[1:06:35] now they were in the right cycle already
[1:06:40] but fear came in
[1:06:43] you know it was fear in the Garden of
[1:06:46] Eden
[1:06:48] that made all these things
[1:06:52] so fear broke
[1:06:54] the cycle of God
[1:06:57] and so when fear said Abraham
[1:07:01] said to Sarah Sarah don't say anything
[1:07:03] don't tell him I am your husband
[1:07:06] tell him I'm your brother
[1:07:08] because Abraham knew amen because of
[1:07:12] this Saras condition now amen the king
[1:07:16] will fall in love and get in that was
[1:07:19] true
[1:07:20] and so abimelech took Sarah
[1:07:24] and now
[1:07:27] it's a wrong cycle
[1:07:29] everything now is hopeless
[1:07:32] Sarah was in the custody
[1:07:36] of abimelech
[1:07:38] and the womb that God purified
[1:07:41] the womb that God restored
[1:07:45] the womb that now amen has all the
[1:07:49] potentials to produce the son of Abraham
[1:07:54] is in danger of being polluted
[1:07:57] amen and nothing
[1:08:00] could control it
[1:08:02] Abraham was in that condition he was so
[1:08:05] fearful amen and he could not do
[1:08:08] anything about it amen and so what
[1:08:10] Abraham will do amen he could not do
[1:08:12] anything about that because you see amen
[1:08:17] she was in the in in the Palace of
[1:08:20] abimelech and Abraham had no control
[1:08:24] and I see something here
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:28] when nothing seems hopeless
[1:08:31] because God is Not only obligated to
[1:08:34] fulfill his own word God is obligated to
[1:08:38] protect his promise
[1:08:42] Sarah could not do anything Abraham
[1:08:44] could not do anything
[1:08:46] abimelech was ignorant
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:52] but God came to the rescue
[1:08:55] everything was had fallen into the wrong
[1:08:58] cycle now and who is able to correct the
[1:09:02] situation only God was able to correct
[1:09:05] the situation and so he came down and he
[1:09:07] said abimelech you are a dead man
[1:09:11] restore the woman
[1:09:14] to his to her husband
[1:09:17] amen but said abimelech said
[1:09:20] my Lord with the Integrity of my heart I
[1:09:24] honestly asked
[1:09:27] but God was absolute
[1:09:30] he said I have no obligation
[1:09:34] God who is rich in Mercy
[1:09:37] my Prophet had no obligation
[1:09:40] amen bring her wife back
[1:09:48] and then you ask prayer from him
[1:09:51] and after he prayed for you
[1:09:53] you give him love offering
[1:10:00] I could imagine what abimelech was
[1:10:03] thinking
[1:10:04] Prophet telling a lie
[1:10:07] but God never changed his mind
[1:10:11] amen God did not change his mind when we
[1:10:14] were back there in sin we never knew
[1:10:17] about him we never knew about this
[1:10:18] message of the hour Hallelujah but God
[1:10:21] hallelujah all the way from eternity
[1:10:23] from the foundation of the world God
[1:10:26] winked his eyes he closed his eyes
[1:10:28] because he covered it with blood amen
[1:10:31] hallelujah and he never saw anything
[1:10:34] against us
[1:10:38] amens that's why he said in Jeremiah
[1:10:40] chapter 29 verse 11 he said for I know
[1:10:43] the thoughts
[1:10:45] that I think towards you thoughts of
[1:10:48] peace and not of evil to give you
[1:10:50] unexpected end aren't you glad amen
[1:10:53] there is a God who's the author who
[1:10:56] knows from the beginning to the end
[1:10:59] amen hallelujah and I'm so glad I have
[1:11:02] confidence that I am part of that great
[1:11:05] plan
[1:11:06] amen so sometimes we think you know some
[1:11:09] these things you know we don't know how
[1:11:11] to make it happen you know don't know
[1:11:13] how to correct the situation
[1:11:16] we have been in some situation where we
[1:11:18] we really do not know what to do
[1:11:21] amen but when we humble ourselves and we
[1:11:24] don't put the remedy in it God comes
[1:11:26] down and make a remedy for that
[1:11:30] hallelujah amen and so now look
[1:11:34] it happened to Abraham when they wear
[1:11:37] and look at that to prove that strain in
[1:11:39] the family now look this Genesis chapter
[1:11:42] 26 6-10 amen Abraham was passed and now
[1:11:47] Isaac and Isaac dwelt in Gerard
[1:11:51] and the man of the place asked him of
[1:11:53] the wife and he said she is my sister
[1:11:58] it was the same Kingdom
[1:12:02] it was the same King
[1:12:05] in the same situation
[1:12:07] the same question
[1:12:10] who is she
[1:12:13] amen Abraham said she is my sister
[1:12:17] and his son
[1:12:19] pays the same question
[1:12:22] any son who was not yet converted and
[1:12:25] gave the same answer she is my sister
[1:12:28] Hallelujah because why amen and and the
[1:12:32] man of the place asked him of his wife
[1:12:33] and she said she is my sister for he
[1:12:36] feared to say she is my wife
[1:12:39] same
[1:12:40] Hallelujah
[1:12:42] Hallelujah that's why there is no fear
[1:12:44] in love
[1:12:46] hallelujahs all these things amen that
[1:12:49] have happened no matter what kind of
[1:12:50] situation we are in no matter what kind
[1:12:53] of sickness we are in Hallelujah don't
[1:12:56] fear we don't fear because he's the same
[1:12:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:13:01] Hallelujah it doesn't change the same
[1:13:03] miracle that he did before is the same
[1:13:05] Miracle is doing until now amen I was in
[1:13:09] the I was in the mission uh uh uh field
[1:13:12] just two weeks ago and we we went to uh
[1:13:16] to another province which is 12 to 14
[1:13:18] hours drive to the interior of the
[1:13:21] mountainous area we call it Abra amen uh
[1:13:24] it's in it's in the northern part of uh
[1:13:28] of our country and so we went there and
[1:13:30] it was the first time we we went to the
[1:13:32] interior we passed hanging Bridges uh uh
[1:13:36] uh and there was rain and we had quite a
[1:13:40] number of landslides along the way amen
[1:13:43] but there are seeds that were hunting
[1:13:46] and so we went there and then and so Our
[1:13:50] intention is just to contact a Bible
[1:13:51] study because there's a young people in
[1:13:53] our church that that that grew up there
[1:13:56] and he wanted to bring this message in
[1:13:58] that in that in that Village and so we
[1:14:00] went there and and so we started
[1:14:03] conducting Bible studies questioning
[1:14:05] answer in the small house and then a a
[1:14:08] neighbor passed by and and asked why
[1:14:11] don't you you know why don't we do it in
[1:14:15] an open
[1:14:16] area so so that more people can hear
[1:14:20] amen and so the following night what we
[1:14:23] did we we were in the uh portion of the
[1:14:25] covered uh uh uh gym and people you know
[1:14:29] when they heard the preaching when they
[1:14:31] heard the singing amen people just come
[1:14:33] out
[1:14:34] and just sit down there and listen
[1:14:37] amen and in in last night my wife was
[1:14:40] very nervous because in the villages in
[1:14:43] her country when it's 9 9 in the evening
[1:14:46] the the the doors are already uh shut
[1:14:51] and the lights are off already because
[1:14:53] people wake up very early they they go
[1:14:55] to the they go to the field at 4 AM amen
[1:14:58] go to the go to the ocean and fish uh at
[1:15:03] the same time you know and so that's it
[1:15:05] and so and the last night my wife was so
[1:15:08] nervous
[1:15:10] I I saw him in front and he was kind of
[1:15:12] like this and I know if if I look to her
[1:15:17] she will signal like that
[1:15:20] [Laughter]
[1:15:24] I knew you know so that's why I was not
[1:15:27] looking amen because I feel the presence
[1:15:30] of the Lord amen and I just preached the
[1:15:33] word just preach the gospel you know the
[1:15:35] following day we baptized five souls in
[1:15:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:40] amen hallelujah and then prior to that
[1:15:44] before we reached the river there is a
[1:15:47] house there amen and uh uh uh uh and and
[1:15:52] the brother said the the woman heard
[1:15:55] that there's a pastor and and she said
[1:15:57] would you pray for him for her yeah yeah
[1:16:00] we can pray and so my feeling was I'm
[1:16:03] just going to pray for the sister she
[1:16:05] was a retired teacher and laying at the
[1:16:09] bed in at the corner there's an oxygen
[1:16:11] tank amen and so before we pray
[1:16:15] I I told them can can can we open a
[1:16:19] Bible and just I just want to do a
[1:16:21] little exhortation and they were happy
[1:16:23] about it and just to set the atmosphere
[1:16:26] and everything and then suddenly you
[1:16:28] know the the the woman
[1:16:31] sat down at the side of her bed
[1:16:34] and raise her hand and said oh you know
[1:16:37] I have been praying for two weeks that a
[1:16:40] minister will come to our village
[1:16:44] I didn't know that
[1:16:47] nobody told me
[1:16:49] but here comes a woman asking for a
[1:16:53] minister to come by and pray for her
[1:16:56] tell me God is not alive amen God is
[1:17:00] alive in our midst he's making
[1:17:02] connections and what a testimony amen
[1:17:06] and what the testimony and I didn't
[1:17:08] realize there were two pastors amen
[1:17:10] sitting down there amen and then they
[1:17:13] got connected and said what everything
[1:17:15] that we have heard you know we're
[1:17:18] scriptural and I want to hear more about
[1:17:21] this message amen so not not before the
[1:17:25] end of this year we're we're praying
[1:17:27] that we're going to hold a crusade there
[1:17:29] so that we can uh I'm going I'm I'm
[1:17:32] praying I can bring my musicians and our
[1:17:34] singers in the church amen and uh we're
[1:17:37] gonna be praying you pray for us because
[1:17:39] I believe God will deliver Souls God
[1:17:42] will heal sickness and everything he
[1:17:45] will cast out demons amen it's time for
[1:17:49] the room cycle in that town in that
[1:17:52] Village amen so that the presence of the
[1:17:54] Lord will come down once again
[1:17:56] hallelujah amen is the same God he can
[1:18:00] correct the error amen he we we don't
[1:18:02] have to put remedies and covers sickness
[1:18:05] cover you know sins and everything we
[1:18:07] just have to Humble ourselves and go
[1:18:09] into the flow of the presence of the
[1:18:12] Lord and God will do the rest Hallelujah
[1:18:15] amen hallelujah so that's why we realize
[1:18:19] now amen young people that's why the
[1:18:21] prophet of God said God has no
[1:18:23] grandchildren
[1:18:26] amen hallelujah but Andrew the same
[1:18:30] challenges that your father brother run
[1:18:32] he will be the same same challenges that
[1:18:35] you have Pace that you will be facing
[1:18:37] because God wants to see that his
[1:18:40] children will overcome the same thing
[1:18:43] amen so that we will have our own
[1:18:45] experiences
[1:18:47] amen the experiences of our fathers
[1:18:50] cannot be credited to our children
[1:18:53] can you see Amen to that but they are
[1:18:56] privileged to witness something amen
[1:18:59] because they were looking to their
[1:19:01] parents who are Faithfully serving the
[1:19:03] lord at least it works in their
[1:19:05] advantage right but the conversion comes
[1:19:10] when they face the same challenges and
[1:19:13] overcome it by the help of God and
[1:19:16] change the wrong cycle in their lives
[1:19:18] glory amen so it's the same thing amen
[1:19:23] so Abraham what happened to Abraham it
[1:19:26] happened to Isaac
[1:19:29] same situation same Kingdom same
[1:19:32] temptation
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:37] if we measure if we gauge what they did
[1:19:40] both of them failed
[1:19:42] because of fear
[1:19:44] that's why we can call it Grace
[1:19:47] that's why we can call it Mercy because
[1:19:50] we have nothing to do with it amen it
[1:19:53] was God and his love when nothing is
[1:19:56] hopeless God will not change his mind
[1:19:59] God will be there
[1:20:03] amen Hallelujah he will personally do it
[1:20:07] for you
[1:20:08] amen thank you Lord hallelujah no it's
[1:20:12] the same thing that have happened in the
[1:20:14] church
[1:20:15] in the laodicean age you know he said a
[1:20:19] momentary consideration of church
[1:20:21] history will prove how accurate this
[1:20:24] thought is in the Dark Ages the word was
[1:20:26] almost entirely lost to the people but
[1:20:30] God sent Luther with the word
[1:20:32] amen so the cycle went wrong again but
[1:20:36] God sent Luther with the word the
[1:20:39] Lutheran spoke of God at that time but
[1:20:41] they organized and again the pure word
[1:20:43] was lost for organization tense toward
[1:20:46] dogma and Creeds and not simple word
[1:20:49] they could no longer speak to God then
[1:20:52] God sent Wesley and he was the voice
[1:20:55] with the word in his day the people who
[1:20:58] took his Revelation from God became the
[1:21:00] living Epistles red and known of all men
[1:21:02] for their generation when the metal
[1:21:05] dispelled God raised up others and as it
[1:21:09] has gone on through the years until in
[1:21:10] this last day there is again another
[1:21:13] people in the land who under their
[1:21:15] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:21:18] final age so you see even in the church
[1:21:21] ages everything amen they get organized
[1:21:25] amen they received the message in their
[1:21:27] day intellectually
[1:21:29] but the proper the power of God isn't
[1:21:31] there
[1:21:32] amen and so they they organized the
[1:21:35] lutherans organized they call themselves
[1:21:37] Protestants and then after which God
[1:21:39] raised Wesley and they call themselves
[1:21:41] Westland called them the Baptist
[1:21:43] Evangelical support and so on afterwards
[1:21:45] Pentecostal him but everybody organized
[1:21:48] amen and here comes the message and
[1:21:51] people hearing the message you know some
[1:21:53] amen are still trying Amen to make it
[1:21:56] like an organization amen you know
[1:21:59] Church appearing to be once again you
[1:22:02] know
[1:22:03] no more Baptist you know no all these
[1:22:06] things but it's the same Spirit coming
[1:22:08] in amen you know but let me tell you
[1:22:12] unless the presence of God unless the
[1:22:14] power of God words in those people who
[1:22:17] receive this message of the hour it will
[1:22:19] go down and go down and will bring back
[1:22:21] another organization but the prophet of
[1:22:24] God said you can no longer organize this
[1:22:27] message
[1:22:32] Hallelujah you cannot organize this
[1:22:35] message because the message is an
[1:22:38] organism Hallelujah and an organism has
[1:22:41] life in it it has a jail of life it will
[1:22:44] produce itself
[1:22:46] Hallelujah and it will break all the
[1:22:49] wrong Cycles
[1:22:51] hallelujah
[1:22:53] amen thank you Lord that's why that word
[1:22:57] b-u-t but
[1:22:59] amen it also happened in a generation
[1:23:02] back in the days of the voice of the
[1:23:05] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:23:07] sound then the mystery of God should be
[1:23:10] finished
[1:23:11] amen that's why it is a message of
[1:23:14] restoration it's not something new but
[1:23:18] it's restoration
[1:23:20] Hallelujah
[1:23:22] amen but you know what
[1:23:25] restoration is not just bringing back
[1:23:28] the apostolic Doctrine
[1:23:31] apostolic faith we believe in that
[1:23:34] amen now we believe that that Elijah has
[1:23:38] restored the faith
[1:23:40] of our children and we are the children
[1:23:43] back to our fathers
[1:23:45] amen and and our fathers in faith are
[1:23:48] not the prophets in the Old Testament
[1:23:51] our fathers in faith are the apostles
[1:23:53] because they preached the second coming
[1:23:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:57] amen if we go back to the to the prophet
[1:24:00] you know we'll go back to you know
[1:24:03] offering lamps once again
[1:24:07] but we are our faith is being restored
[1:24:09] back to the Faith of Our Fathers the
[1:24:12] apostles
[1:24:13] amen but you see the ministry the
[1:24:17] ministry of brother Benham fulfilled
[1:24:19] scriptures in our day
[1:24:23] he was the Elijah
[1:24:25] to bring us back
[1:24:28] to the faith of the fathers
[1:24:31] amen and his ministry is just like you
[1:24:35] know just like the ministry of the
[1:24:36] original Elijah
[1:24:38] amen that he repaired the altar in his
[1:24:42] time
[1:24:44] amen So He restored the altar
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:50] and now the altar is our hearts
[1:24:52] amen but when he repaired when he
[1:24:55] restored the altar the ministry of
[1:24:57] Elijah was not finished
[1:25:00] because after He restored the altar
[1:25:05] there was no fire yet
[1:25:08] the evening sacrifice
[1:25:12] amen the evening sacrifice must be laid
[1:25:16] down on top of the altar that was being
[1:25:19] repaired that was being restored it's
[1:25:22] the same thing to us that's why we have
[1:25:24] justification sanctification and baptism
[1:25:26] of the Holy Spirit our hearts must be
[1:25:29] converted our hearts must be purified
[1:25:32] Hallelujah so that the word that is pure
[1:25:36] should be put on top of the altar on top
[1:25:39] of the heart that is being restored back
[1:25:41] to God
[1:25:42] amen because many people they get this
[1:25:45] message of the hour without being
[1:25:47] converted and so when they received this
[1:25:50] message they just received information
[1:25:53] amen and because it's information it
[1:25:56] doesn't fall to the heart
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:00] because the heart is not pure
[1:26:03] and although it's an information
[1:26:06] amen it cannot it cannot go down because
[1:26:09] it's a pure word it cannot fall
[1:26:13] altar
[1:26:18] so when people receive the word
[1:26:21] amen when they get the evening sacrifice
[1:26:25] but the heart is not restored
[1:26:29] everything just go on the head
[1:26:32] just go here and so the message becomes
[1:26:35] information they can quote one quote
[1:26:37] after the other they can give the page
[1:26:40] they can give the paragraph they can
[1:26:43] give the title but there's no power
[1:26:45] behind it
[1:26:48] hallelujah amen but let me tell you when
[1:26:52] the word of God no matter how simple it
[1:26:54] is when it falls in a pure heart
[1:26:57] Hallelujah it has power behind it
[1:27:00] it has result behind that Hallelujah
[1:27:04] there is science following after that
[1:27:07] amen so it's not producing uh members
[1:27:10] but it's producing Sons and Daughters of
[1:27:13] God
[1:27:15] amen and as a Ministry of Elijah but you
[1:27:19] come to think of that because before the
[1:27:22] the ministry of Elijah you know better
[1:27:24] also Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 amen
[1:27:28] the Seven Star Messenger and in his
[1:27:31] ministry he was preaching to the
[1:27:33] denomination just like Moses he he
[1:27:37] exposed pero amen but he was not
[1:27:41] rebuking
[1:27:43] Israel
[1:27:44] he was exposing he was rebuking Pharaoh
[1:27:47] amen so Revelation 3 14 was rebuking the
[1:27:51] denomination exposing the nicolaitan
[1:27:54] spirit The Jezebel spirit that was the
[1:27:56] ministry of Revelation 3 14 when that
[1:27:59] was being exposed then the Sons and
[1:28:02] Daughters of God Amen you know was able
[1:28:04] to understand something something is
[1:28:07] going on and this is not the way it
[1:28:09] should be now from from Revelation 3 14
[1:28:12] and that was the beginning of Malachi 4
[1:28:15] going back to the restoration that's why
[1:28:18] brother Branham said you know you cannot
[1:28:20] you cannot compare Israel to that you
[1:28:23] know I could call it a church because it
[1:28:26] was only a church when it has called the
[1:28:28] out
[1:28:29] because the church is they called out
[1:28:31] once amen so when they started to go
[1:28:35] back it was the ministry of Elijah amen
[1:28:38] restoration they were in the wrong cycle
[1:28:40] in Israel for hundreds of years
[1:28:43] amen but the deliverer came to break
[1:28:46] that wrong cycle and now they're going
[1:28:48] back
[1:28:49] because it's the only place they will be
[1:28:52] blessed by the Lord amen and so they
[1:28:55] started to walk amen and then being
[1:28:58] restored the word is being restored and
[1:29:00] then look at that amen and then in
[1:29:02] Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 once that
[1:29:04] is the opening of the word amen it's the
[1:29:06] revelation of the word amen the word is
[1:29:08] being put placed on top of the altar
[1:29:12] it's being restored our faith is being
[1:29:14] restored back to the original fathers we
[1:29:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:18] Christ Holiness came back the position
[1:29:20] of the women being brought back amen but
[1:29:23] we don't stop there
[1:29:26] some of those things are being done by
[1:29:28] the Pentecostal people
[1:29:30] amen but what separates us is the
[1:29:34] opening of the word
[1:29:36] hallelujah amen and so when when the
[1:29:40] word is being opened he said now it's
[1:29:42] it's it's it's continuing amen so that's
[1:29:45] why we're not only the the restoration
[1:29:48] of our faith back to the fathers the
[1:29:50] apostolic Brothers is just the first
[1:29:52] part of restoration
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:57] but as we go on
[1:30:00] amen our faith is being restored back
[1:30:03] what have happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:30:06] we realize what the you know something
[1:30:09] have happened in the Garden of Eden that
[1:30:11] was the beginning it pointed us to
[1:30:14] everything because the Genesis Book is
[1:30:16] the book of beginning
[1:30:18] amen that's the second part
[1:30:23] but in the third part
[1:30:25] amen the ministry of Luke 17 30. look at
[1:30:28] that
[1:30:29] amen was being restored not just the
[1:30:31] faith of the apostolic father not just
[1:30:33] the original things that have happened
[1:30:35] in the Garden of Eden we were back in
[1:30:37] the mind of God
[1:30:40] and when we go back to the mind of God
[1:30:42] you realize who you are
[1:30:45] right you know where you are standing
[1:30:47] amen we go back to the cycle which is
[1:30:51] the perfect cycle amen so that's why in
[1:30:55] in Corinthians 15 54 55 so when this
[1:30:59] corruptible shall have put on
[1:31:00] incorruption and this Mortal shall put
[1:31:04] on immortality
[1:31:07] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:31:10] that is written that is swallowed up in
[1:31:13] Victory oh that where is thy sting oh
[1:31:16] great where is thy victory
[1:31:19] amen I like that illustration uh you
[1:31:23] know from from the lowest form
[1:31:25] uh you know the the the the grass the
[1:31:29] plants you know they extend the root
[1:31:35] so that they can get the elements the
[1:31:38] substance from the Earth
[1:31:41] and so the the substance is coming up to
[1:31:44] the plants
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:48] it's coming up to the plants it's going
[1:31:51] higher and higher
[1:31:53] amen but now here comes
[1:31:56] brother
[1:31:59] make ask me what do you want to eat
[1:32:01] brother Danny
[1:32:04] take
[1:32:07] I want to feel the reality that I am in
[1:32:10] the states
[1:32:16] okay so now the substance go up from the
[1:32:21] Earth to the grass
[1:32:23] amen and then here comes the cow
[1:32:28] eating the grass
[1:32:30] amen
[1:32:32] so the elements that's in the cow is in
[1:32:36] the Earth
[1:32:37] but the cow cannot eat straight the
[1:32:40] Earth the soil amen so it has to pass
[1:32:45] through the grass and then the cow will
[1:32:48] eat
[1:32:49] the grass and the substance from it will
[1:32:52] be
[1:32:53] coming up
[1:32:55] to the beef
[1:32:58] and here comes a Filipino Minister who
[1:33:01] wants a steak
[1:33:05] amen so the life the the substance that
[1:33:09] was in the earth is coming up to the
[1:33:12] grass now it comes up to the cow
[1:33:16] now it becomes steak
[1:33:19] and it goes to a man
[1:33:21] so the light was coming up the substance
[1:33:24] was coming up Hallelujah but where
[1:33:28] should it stop
[1:33:29] if the life stopped here
[1:33:31] amen I'm just looking to a man that are
[1:33:35] fond of eating
[1:33:36] steak
[1:33:37] but the life has to come up
[1:33:41] amen but still this is corruptable but
[1:33:45] it has to go up in a higher realm and
[1:33:48] what will bring us up there is the word
[1:33:50] of God Amen to bring us back to the
[1:33:53] perfect cycle so that we can go back
[1:33:55] brothers and Caesar do that
[1:33:58] Hallelujah where God is
[1:34:01] the substance that is in here not that
[1:34:04] just the natural amen but I'm just I'm
[1:34:07] just showing you that something is going
[1:34:09] higher and higher and higher until it
[1:34:12] cannot go higher because it has gone up
[1:34:15] to the highest which is the Lord Jesus
[1:34:17] Christ himself
[1:34:18] amen thank you Lord now when this day
[1:34:22] when this Mortal takes on immortality
[1:34:24] death is swallowed up in Victory that
[1:34:26] then we shall see him as he is and
[1:34:28] everybody like his own glorious body
[1:34:30] what a time to come amen hallelujah so
[1:34:35] we come we go higher and higher now he
[1:34:38] said in the message perfection
[1:34:41] now this great chain of perfection was
[1:34:45] broken by time and space
[1:34:49] this perfect chain of perfection or this
[1:34:53] great chain of perfection was broken by
[1:34:55] time space
[1:34:57] time came because of sin
[1:35:00] there was no time there was no time
[1:35:02] prior to sin
[1:35:04] Adam and Eve were immortal
[1:35:07] but when sin came they started to count
[1:35:11] years amen
[1:35:14] they started to remember their birthdays
[1:35:18] amen
[1:35:19] so now
[1:35:20] I start
[1:35:22] to forget my birthday brother on
[1:35:27] [Laughter]
[1:35:29] young people they always wait for their
[1:35:31] birthday
[1:35:32] but one day you will realize
[1:35:36] when you come to a point you don't want
[1:35:38] to reach your birthday because you're
[1:35:40] going old
[1:35:43] amen so prior to sin there was no
[1:35:46] birthday
[1:35:47] amen
[1:35:50] I'm not again celebrating birthdays
[1:35:52] don't get me wrong okay don't get me
[1:35:54] wrong amen
[1:35:58] so
[1:35:59] time came because of sin let's draw a
[1:36:02] picture of time let's see A Perfect
[1:36:03] Circle he said forever forever and then
[1:36:07] all
[1:36:08] up at a once sin Dropped In
[1:36:12] and put a little
[1:36:14] and my wife calls it by the brand of a
[1:36:17] little hickey
[1:36:18] so it was a perfect circle
[1:36:20] and then because of sin a little hickey
[1:36:23] had dropped down he said
[1:36:25] came
[1:36:27] it keeps on going but it's no longer in
[1:36:30] its Perfect Circle because of sin it had
[1:36:33] a drop
[1:36:35] amen it's called hiki or a little drop
[1:36:38] in the chain so it comes down now
[1:36:42] eternity continues on but it's not in
[1:36:45] its perfect condition
[1:36:49] there's a little Gap comes down breaks
[1:36:52] over this way goes out this way God had
[1:36:55] to do because Satan caused it and it
[1:36:58] dropped down to a space of time for the
[1:37:00] trying and the perfecting and for the
[1:37:02] purging of the lost that God by his
[1:37:05] Sovereign Grace might Someday live that
[1:37:08] little hickey or Gap back into the
[1:37:11] perfect circle then she rolls on just
[1:37:14] the same
[1:37:15] amen so it's it's perfect
[1:37:18] but now because of sin there is now a
[1:37:21] drop down
[1:37:22] it's a little hickey or whatever we call
[1:37:25] it amen but God has a purpose in
[1:37:28] everything
[1:37:29] amen so continuing on no time now time
[1:37:33] is the little Loop that Loop down
[1:37:36] Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but
[1:37:39] he stepped into the time spaces
[1:37:43] made flesh and came through here in
[1:37:45] order to sanctify or put a streak of
[1:37:48] blood all across this place to redeem it
[1:37:51] and connect it back with God again for
[1:37:54] all eternity
[1:37:55] amen now that's all time is that God
[1:38:00] when it started here end of a little
[1:38:02] King in the perfect circle but made it a
[1:38:05] little kink in it when God started that
[1:38:08] he was he started there he was perfect
[1:38:11] everything he said was perfect
[1:38:13] everything he did does it perfect so
[1:38:16] then the Bible said that Christ Jesus
[1:38:17] was the lamb slain from the beginning of
[1:38:20] the little King the beginning of the
[1:38:22] word Christ was slain at the beginning
[1:38:24] so he said in that little Loop down amen
[1:38:28] there was a streak of blood
[1:38:33] amen if not for God there will be a gap
[1:38:40] and the the circle will not be connected
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:46] just like the ring you know you can cut
[1:38:49] it there's no more connection but you
[1:38:51] see God in his Sovereign Grace
[1:38:54] God is rich in Mercy
[1:38:56] he said God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:59] stepped into time so that little Loop
[1:39:02] was called time
[1:39:04] and in that time he stepped into it and
[1:39:08] he was working something inside
[1:39:11] amen he's trying to working out to work
[1:39:14] it out amen and so little by little by
[1:39:17] his blood little by little it is going
[1:39:19] up he wanted to restore it so that we
[1:39:22] can go back to Eternity
[1:39:26] and so you can see
[1:39:28] how privileged we are
[1:39:31] realize what Grace is
[1:39:35] we realized why brother Branham said
[1:39:37] when we say grace we have nothing to do
[1:39:39] with it
[1:39:41] but what we are doing right now the joy
[1:39:44] whatever we do we support the mission we
[1:39:47] support our pastor we we come here even
[1:39:50] though we are tired we serve the Lord
[1:39:52] why we do that we do that not because we
[1:39:55] can save ourselves not because we can
[1:39:58] restore back ourselves to God Amen but
[1:40:01] we do that in appreciation of God's
[1:40:05] grace applied to you and I
[1:40:08] amen hallelujah now in closing let me
[1:40:12] just remind you of that you know that
[1:40:15] woman at the well
[1:40:18] you know you know pretty well that woman
[1:40:20] at the well
[1:40:22] amen and you know
[1:40:25] it was it was it it's that it she was a
[1:40:28] type of the Bride
[1:40:31] and here comes the Lord
[1:40:33] and and he said how come you know he he
[1:40:36] asked water to drink and he said how
[1:40:38] come you being a Jew speak to me being a
[1:40:41] Samaritan
[1:40:43] amen so she knew naturally
[1:40:47] who she was
[1:40:49] she knew the strain
[1:40:51] he was a Samaritan
[1:40:54] and close to being hopeless amen and
[1:40:57] here comes the first thing is that he
[1:40:59] realized she realized him as a natural
[1:41:02] Jew
[1:41:04] and so she approached or she she
[1:41:07] responded to her to him
[1:41:10] Amen in that manner in that level that
[1:41:13] she was a Samaritan and he was a Jew
[1:41:17] amen they were in that cycle
[1:41:21] it was the little Loop down
[1:41:24] but he the son of man
[1:41:27] Son of God came down the Lord of Lord
[1:41:31] came down in that little
[1:41:34] Loop hickey
[1:41:36] drop down
[1:41:37] he entered into that Realm and he said
[1:41:40] whoever drinks of this water will be
[1:41:43] thirsty again
[1:41:44] but with the water that I'm going to
[1:41:46] give
[1:41:47] out of him shall flow
[1:41:52] rivers of water
[1:41:54] it's a cycle you drink of that water you
[1:41:57] thirsty again
[1:41:58] amen but there is another higher level
[1:42:01] of water
[1:42:02] amen where there's no more thirsting
[1:42:06] amen but it's always satisfaction when
[1:42:09] you drink it and now of you shall blow
[1:42:13] rivers of water
[1:42:16] so he she he entered into that realm and
[1:42:18] that woman said hey
[1:42:20] I need that water
[1:42:22] I haven't tried that before
[1:42:25] amen and so the Lord okay so he was
[1:42:29] entering into the triang
[1:42:32] of the spirit
[1:42:34] to a condition of that woman's life
[1:42:37] amen and he said okay call your husband
[1:42:42] and she said I have no husband
[1:42:47] and the Lord said
[1:42:49] you said right
[1:42:52] if the disciples were there
[1:42:55] probably they would have said see Lord
[1:42:58] she's a liar
[1:43:02] and many men in her life
[1:43:04] but the Lord was working in that little
[1:43:08] King
[1:43:11] amen
[1:43:13] and she said you said right because you
[1:43:17] had
[1:43:18] five and the man you're living with now
[1:43:21] is the sixth
[1:43:24] and still not your husband
[1:43:26] first time
[1:43:28] amen
[1:43:30] and the woman said how did you know
[1:43:34] my my forefathers our father said
[1:43:38] something similar will happen
[1:43:41] amen that when the prophet comes
[1:43:43] he will say just like what you're saying
[1:43:46] right now
[1:43:47] coming to the restoration
[1:43:50] amen amen
[1:43:53] so she met
[1:43:57] the seventh man in her life
[1:44:03] and in that manner
[1:44:05] the seventh man was introducing who she
[1:44:10] was not on the level of being a
[1:44:13] Samaritan
[1:44:16] come on
[1:44:17] but restoring her because of that seat
[1:44:20] because the prophet said the difference
[1:44:23] between that woman at the well
[1:44:26] and the people in this in the in the
[1:44:30] temples amen those people at the temples
[1:44:33] that did not recognize the Lord Jesus
[1:44:35] Christ they didn't have representation
[1:44:37] in heaven
[1:44:39] but this woman she never knew who she
[1:44:42] was
[1:44:43] but she had representation in heaven and
[1:44:47] God cares for those who are being
[1:44:50] represented up there in heaven amen and
[1:44:54] so he was working on that and he said
[1:44:56] amen hallelujah don't worry amen nothing

[1:45:18] Charles amen and her mother you know
[1:45:21] Brandon
[1:45:23] but I am a Son of God I want you to
[1:45:27] realize this afternoon amen that you are
[1:45:30] a son and daughter of God and our
[1:45:33] lateral lineages we appreciate our
[1:45:36] parents we appreciate our natural

[1:45:41] that but he's caring so much on the seed
[1:45:45] that is in you because you have a
[1:45:48] representation in heaven that's why you

[1:46:25] being anchored Hallelujah to the pure
[1:46:28] word being manifested in this day

[1:46:44] Hallelujah and the real prophet of God
[1:46:47] is the sign he will always point us to
[1:46:50] the word he will always point that to us
[1:46:53] to the Lord Jesus Christ not to himself
[1:46:55] but the Brandon said I have no intention
[1:46:58] amen of people you know
[1:47:01] I have no intention of building
[1:47:03] organization I have no interest in those

[1:47:12] relationship
[1:47:14] with the Lord Jesus Christ aren't you
[1:47:16] glad we have a prophet that has restored
[1:47:19] us that has broken the wrong Cycles in
[1:47:23] everything this organizational thinking
[1:47:25] and everything God has broken it down by

[1:48:01] a faithful wife
[1:48:03] but she met the wrong men

[1:48:10] did not
[1:48:12] broke
[1:48:14] the wrong cycle in her life
[1:48:17] but when she met the seventh man
[1:48:20] she was pointed to the perfect cycle and
[1:48:23] she was rejoicing come see the man and
[1:48:27] that simple City Hallelujah was also
[1:48:30] converted those people in the man they
[1:48:33] were able to witness who Jesus Christ
[1:48:35] was they went there amen and that
[1:48:39] changed the situation of that City amen

[1:56:25] me to go to the Philippines
[1:56:27] then God sent him here to pray for me
[1:56:35] isn't that correct
[1:56:37] isn't that correct
[1:56:39] because without a miracle
[1:56:41] I can never make that trip
