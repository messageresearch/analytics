I go back next time they say where's George and we always called in King George amen I shared this with him today on our walk I said brother George I said what made me recognize what a great man you are is when I walked in your streets of Donal amongst your people and I saw how they treated you with reverence and respect and I said brother George that meant so much to me of how much his own Community thinks of him you say well brother Ron but maybe he hasn't won many of them you just don't know the profound effect that he's had on their lives he's been all over the world to preach the

been in actually more but I've actually preached in 31 countries even Israel and um amen uh the one great thing about going anywhere is to be right here with the people that's been the greatest blessing of all is to be at church with the people in all them country no matter where they are no matter if they were rich or poor it don't matter they were Believers in this word and I was so glad to be with them and help them on the way and use the use the ministry that God has planted in my heart so it's just beautiful to be here hallelujah amen and um praise God I think there's been plenty of singing tonight so I want to just get right down to the word amen but um hallelujah amen uh if we could if you'd remain standing with me and uh we'll read uh the scripture the brothers uh if

days they were the days he amen yeah we had some some wow was wonderful over there now so let us just read the word of God together amen he says for as many verse 14 as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption and some of you young people may even know what that means you've received the spirit of adoption and you really have received it amen and I'm going to try and bring out tonight what that actually means amen praise God and so Hallelujah we've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father amen you can't be a son unless you have a father amen amen and as be a Son of God you've got a Heavenly Father amen and so praise the Lord as we go one amen and he says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and we are children then HS HS of God and Joint HS with Christ so if it be so that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together amen joint HS equal HS that's what he wants to share with us equal Airship hallelujah what I've got you've got it's like my wife always used to say to me you promis to bestow all your worldly Goods on me so I'm taking that amen right thanks very much you reminded me about that amen and so I joint there equal air with Jesus oh my praise God and um you know no wonder they wrote that song uh joiners with Jesus as we travel the S I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God Amen Hallelujah and and that is wonderful amen and and no wonder uh what we've got today is called The High Calling of God not just some political calling or some uh uh you know Nashville Tennessee calling this is the highest calling we can have it's the High Calling of God Amen and so we're so thankful for that there and then he goes on to say Amen because the creature itself uh uh sh shall also be delivered the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of the corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God I just when when I was in the office today I I noticed a little taxed up by Guess Who Stonewall Jackson amen praise God and it said Hallelujah don't take counsel with your fears hope you get that don't take counsel with your fears Hallelujah and we know tonight that the word of God is true and the Bible says perfect love casteth out fear so whether you're going for an operation or things are coming on you perfect love will Cast Away that fear hallelujah amen and so uh to the Glorious Liberty o of the children of God for we know the whole Creation granth trth in pain gather until now and not only they but ourselves now listen to this but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit Hallelujah we've got the holy spirit in us tonight yet we're still groaning hallelujah amen your pastor groaning we're all groaning because we know amen there's something better than this and we're groaning under this uh this uh Corruption of this uh uh body this life amen amen and we've got the first fruits and we grown within ourselves we're waiting we're winning because the adoption the final thing that I'd be talking about tonight is the adoption of the body Hallelujah when we're going to go into a higher plan a higher realm than we' have ever dreamed we could be in we're going into it when we are adopted Hallelujah at the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen so that's it that is the last one the Redemption of our body amen and we know we cannot take our full position as pleased Sons because this body cannot inherit the kingdom of God so it's going to take that final lift amen sister that final lift to get us into that that adoption Hallelujah the Redemption of our body what a day that'll be I I'll be looking forward it praise the Lord I mean young brother Mike seems young to me amen hallelujah a brother bam used to say uh he was only 25 and then he would say uhuh the second time but if I said I'm only 7 25 the third time don't ask me for me now whatever you do Hallelujah and so we're we're just so thankful amen and uh we cannot take our full possession until that Resurrection we cannot enter that kingdom of God until that Resurrection comes amen fully in and um the same thing just imagine what am I saying here just imagine what Jesus Christ experienced on the Mount of transfiguration is what you're going to experience that's it when I'm really placed as a son Hallelujah in the Redemption of my body I am going to have everything that he had because that's what he wants to show that's a joint Airship and a wonderful Hallelujah and you may say but brother I'm not worthy I don't care if you're worthy or not he has made us worthy hallelujah hallelujah we're not going in on our strength we're going in on his strength and it's so wonderful Hallelujah amen and uh praise the Lord so that is coming to us you know and uh now amen and what he experienced of the the shakina glory the visible presence of God surrounding him and all his garments turning white beyond the Fuller soap what a day that was the Supreme deity Hallelujah shining forth out of that man called Christ Jesus amen and so here he was amen and uh with with us and we we'll be the same because in in Revelation 21:7 it says that he that overcometh shall inherit all things so where do you put a doubt where do you put an amen after that you're going to inherit all things where do you say well maybe not all things he said all things I believe the word I believe the report that's right there if he said all things he meant all things because God says what he means and means what he says always has always has you know and could I just say that before we pray and let you sit down for a moment um what was the last admonition that was given to the church was given to the bride what was the last one now I want you to think about that hallelujah what was the last admonition that was given to the bride I'll tell you what it was the last thing that was said it said to him that overcometh I will grant to sit in my throne even as I overcame and I'm sat on my father's Throne that was the last in my management that he give to us there you go hang on to that Hallelujah you fulfilled that in your life and you'll be there on that Throne amen may God bless you tonight as we read that word Heavenly Father Lord we count it a great honor and a great blessing to be here tonight with all the children of God we' have listened to them sing and rightfully so Lord that they could sing with

her Dy letting her Dy be a a missionary and all that let me give you a few clues about that just wa for a moment uh when she was about three or 4 I got a kidney stone so uh the doctor we looked at the doctor and I went to the actually the to the doctor's surgery and and I I came home and it was still so much pain he came out to see me so he said now this could be a little bit more serious than I think so we're putting you in the hospital so I said okay so we got ready for hospital I was on my pajamas had the bathro on and she was only little girl so I'm going out to the amulance and she said Daddy Daddy and I said yes pet she says are you going to die I said well I hope not I hope not amen and and praise God you don't realize this folks but I'll tell you what when I was getting ready to go over to Vietnam or or go over to India or all the places where I was when she was at hate she would be hanging on to my leg and crying the tears come her face and daddy don't go don't leave me don't go Daddy and I said P I got to go I have to go and you know that went on for many years even to this day she's not so sure about some of the places said amen that let her calling me to go but she doesn't she doesn't want that amen so praise God well it's a it's a joy to be with you it's a joy to be with you tonight and if I may just I want to just get you relaxed I notice that your pastor does it amen then he gets you relaxed and then when you're all nice and laughing and smiling then he says something profound to you Hallelujah that's what he does so I thought I would try that tonight brother Ronald amen amen and and I I come up with a good one I came up with a good one hallelujah amen because I didn't want to tell him but you know that I had an offering for him you know so he thinking brother George got an offering for me yeah I was going to put it into the you know but it didn't but it says here it's only $1 by the way amen I'll show you if you've got a sense of humor now

I'll just have to take that back amen God bless you hallelujah amen let's talk about the law of of adoption let's talk about the law of adoption hallelujah praise God thanks very much amen Matthew Hallelujah and um amen it's a wonderful thing amen we have received that that that uh spirit and we're going to talk about it young people because the law of adoption actually is not the way we'd understand adoption in in the law of the land today where people can adopt babies it's not that at all praise God the law of adoption has to do with placing pleasing and not only pleasing but pleasing as a son Hallelujah now praise God we can read that what I've read we're led by the spirit of God Amen and could I just take one more moment I just feel I want to pray I just feel I want to pray could you just pray with me for that gracious Heavenly Father we just want to Pray Again Lord that you will just come down now Lord and take this human flesh Lord this human tongue and dear God the spirit and soul that's in my body Lord may you use it tonight Lord that everyone will get a portion Lord like King David had the face Lord and he give them a big portion of bread and meat and the flagin of wine Lord may we really enjoy the flagin of wine of stimulation of Revelation tonight Lord the bread of life Lord God Amen and father may you just bless your word we pray in Jesus name I just feel to do that again Lord in Jesus name amen praise God so hallelujah amen and uh it's it's a it's a wonderful thing amen and you know also it was for the for the Israelites praise the Lord you know the good scripture is that he said I've called my son out of Egypt and that was when they were down there in Egypt amen and then when Jesus went down there with Mary and Joseph and he said I've called my son out of Egypt and it's a wonderful thing to know a compound scripture when you read one amen so that's a compound scripture there but uh it it applies to Israel amen and in Romans 9 and 10 where Paul's going to speak so wonderfully of of the elect now over in Israel not everybody's a Believer over there there's a lot of young people these R parties and all that and they' they've LED God aside and they they they would rather go into that they think there's life in a re party well there ain't no life in a re party there's death of party Hallelujah there's death and drunkenness amen oh my and so praise God but there isn't a lack my have met some beautiful people over there that really believed and were humble and believed God and dressed like like like we dress that we The Way We believe just wonderful and it says who the Israelites to whom pertaineth adoption so they've got that plan of adoption as well that placing as a son they'll come back to that they will inherit when we when we sing that one amen therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return they certainly will hallelujah praise God they certainly will and he'll fulfill everything he said about them amen now I want to get right on down here I don't know what time to finish it but I can only give you one promise I won't be as long as brother Tim if you can see it brother very sorry amen and so praise God yeah and and he goes on if you want to read it in chapter n there you read it yourself and uh it's about Rebecca and Isaac our father and the children not being born and not there and so then he talks about that adoption to Israel to come that 144,000 will stand Hallelujah God's word will never be broken as I said to you before I preached it to you amen scripture cannot cannot cannot be broken Hallelujah that's all it amen and as I always Billy Paul when he said this he said amen God spoke it Amen brother Bram caught it he give it to us hallelujah we believed it and that settles it that settles it amen sure does so we're so thankful for that tonight amen and and no doubt even in in Jesus day they would have had a little bar mitah you know what they would do for the for the son amen when he reached a certain age amen and uh praise God uh he would be legally uh entitled to be Father and Son whatever the father was was his name would be amen Cohen it would be Cohen and Son now why did that son get put up there why did that word get put in there cuz something had happened Amen in that family and legally that boy was equal equal with his father that's wonderful Hallelujah wonderful hallelujah amen and so praise God if that sounds good in the natural how much better would it sound good tonight when we say God is our father and I am his son but the whole point about tonight is I want to hear God say you're my son hallelujah amen I want to hear him saying you are my son Hallelujah I want to hear him say I pleased you where you are Hallelujah that's what it is you're positionally pleased you're in that body you're serving God and you've got a wonderful checkbook to come back on hallelujah amen no so that is wonderful and we'll leave Israel there because of the time but amen uh in Galatians it says there is neither Greek nor Jew there is neither born or free uh amen neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ and if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed on HS according to the promise hallel for Jesus is the Royal Seed of Abraham and we are that seed Hallelujah that spiritual Seed of Abraham amen and heirs according to the promise and then he says this these words he says N I say that the heir as long as he a child differing nothing from a servant so if you're just the air you differ nothing from a servant hallelujah amen you're not a slave but you just may be just differing nothing from a servant amen and it goes on to say here amen and uh praise the Lord um though he be Lord of all so as an air you differ not you differ nothing uh from a a servant though you be Lord of all that's wonderful you got to think this thing out here hallelujah amen and so he says here amen uh he says uh but is under chors so we're Christ seed we are under cheors tonight under tutorship hallelujah and governorship amen until the time appointed of the father amen I'll explain this as I say to our young people as we go along amen but just let me throw this in right now you know when a chicken's born right you don't expect a little baby chicken to fly do you not a bit amen it just gets out there and the mother looks after it and and she Wings it up she gives it her little dinner and every day until it gets ready then she gets it on her bike flies down to the valley and they have a great time but it's not all finished she's only weaning them up he's under tutorship hallelujah amen and so here she is and then one day she takes him up there and his little feathers grw and she said I've got a nice surprise for you today and he says oh mama that's great what's that Hallelujah she said here you go and throws them off throws him off amen and he's going you know backside no upside down and but now he begins to flop the wings hallelujah oh he begins to flop the wings amen and he can he said I can fly I can fly hallelujah amen don't need Mama anymore amen well it's wonderful amen isn't it wonderful Hallelujah doesn't it do your heart good doesn't it do your heart good hallelujah amen and uh praise the Lord so until the and so we who were children may I had his children were in bondage under the elements of the world yes we were but when the fullness of time come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption the placing in possession as a son before God and that's what I want folks tonight I wonder there's only one thing that I would say is higher than this and that is the sture of a perfect mind so we're going to come into the pleasing Hallelujah and we'll raise into the stature of a perfect mind and then that that Redemption of the body body that final placing as a son when we wake up in that realm Hallelujah and we'll have the fullness of the spirit without measure hallelujah what a time that's going to be oh my can't wait really can't couldn't wait to come here amen uh just just because we missed him uh in July you knew that and and I was tell with brother Mark and I got that close but with your pastor was to come down to North Carolina and then that Happ and sister rexan God bless you amen and uh praise the Lord and kitlin with her today and uh and brother Mark precious people sister Christie precious people hallelujah believe them what you believe amen and I tell you what I thank God for them no and so uh we got that far and then we turned back uh I don't think I was I think I went on down to Georgia after sure but amen uh we had a wonderful time down in in in Georgia and uh I just thank God for what he's doing down there and uh seeing the Lord working amen and it's wonderful uh to see uh somebody said to me I think it was in brother Billy's Fellowship he said brother George you mentioned your your your testimony bits and pieces they said the people want you to give your testimony and so I preached on the book of your life you might think it you know that God's got a book of your life but he has he could tell you when you were born he could tell you where you were in his mind and as brother Ronald was speaking tonight here and I thinking you know we met somewhere we met somewhere this just this life wasn't the only meeting we met somewhere whether it was in the mind of God I don't know but I'll tell you what we met somewhere Hallelujah and so we're so thankful amen for for for for these things amen now okay and uh uh we're under cheers and praise the Lord till that fullness of time would come that we might receive the adoption the placing of sons positionally placed you could say in the body of Christ and amen with him calling you a son you know Jesus said I don't no longer call you servants I call you friends what a wonderful thing what a wonderful thing amen and I want to hear God saying this is my son here I've sent him in your midst you know I was telling your pastor that when I was in in in India in in this January this year and uh I was seeing so many wonderful things and one of the nicest things that stood out to me was we were having these meetings up and a a rural area like a the the tribal people were in the jungle no electricity no nothing like that but I didn't go in there we went on through the jungle on the road and we came to the the little town and we stayed in a nice place which was a surprise to me amen cuz every place I've sted at times hasn't been the nicest place you know but amen that goes with that goes with it praise the Lord and so I I remember there was about maybe 100 120 30 people in it and it was a good service and at the end of it there was a four four girls come out and you know one of the girls was standing like this here and she was going like this here and and and I said oh my and and uh I said what what do you want God to do for you and and she said that she had that nervous thing in her life you know just troubled by that amen and I said to her as I would say to you tonight have you got enough Faith to believe that God will do it see this girl with a migraine here if she's here tonight I could call her right right here now and I believe God would heal her right on the spot and I mean not and this girl amen with all the pressures and you know and I said well let us pray and and we prayed for her and you know the the ministers brother Andre any of these ministers here will tell you that you know when you pray for someone you just feel if something's happened you just feel it you just know my and you stand back and say now the Lord touched you there I could say that many times not that I touched them the Lord touched you amen and so here she was and that's exactly what I did and she could speak English and I sted back and I said do you know the Lord touched you and she said yes and she was crying and I said God bless you prayed for the girls and they they went they had been put in a little Motel a little hotel humble and uh and so uh the next day even that night at supper I said to the brother I said I'm going to get that girl to give her testimony tomorrow I'm going to get her to give her testimony and here she was amen 3:00 in the morning Hallelujah she was woke up and she said there she was she woke up and God she said God spoke to me and I said yes I said you want me to tell you what he said amen hallelujah he said you're healed and she said it left it all left all that left all that uh spirit that was on her Hallelujah left her praise God and she got in the victory man she come in a a different woman into church the next day Hallelujah it was wonderful to hear that testimony and I said I would have got you to give the testimony but I couldn't pick out which one was which amen so hallelujah amen but that was wonderful and of course I knew Fain well and you know when you think think does God really know my need tonight does he really care enough about me to know my need well the answer is yes he does yes he does all full of compassion and I was stand there brother Ronald I never told you a little bit but I was standing there so I said are you all right for getting home and she well yeah I said yeah I figured that amen they no money the no money but you see I

high and and just didn't get my leg up far enough and I just fell over I skined here and you know my leg but I'm okay but the thing is amen praise the Lord amen uh to be uh in a place amen of um of this predestination amen blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame do you know something I'm going to tell you tonight praise God and I mean this with all my heart I don't I'm not going to say anything that I don't mean amen I I mean it and it's this we don't reverence the Holiness of God enough we think it's just like a jake just like a yoyo up and down to use them as as we want and it's a terrible thing amen but but you know tonight we're on Holy Ground we're on Holy Ground amen and so praise God we want to give him that reverence that that he could just come I I I've often said it that there's a moment just we sing in moments like these there's a moment in every service where God can come to your situation and meet your need Hallelujah yes he can and just all we got to do is believe and let him do it amen so Hallelujah and he says according to how he has chosen us before the foundation of the world Amen and I don't want to argue with that that's the that's the word of God we were chosen before the foundation of the world that's good enough for me Hallelujah amen praise the Lord and so here we are and uh amen uh that we should be holy and Without Blame and love having predestinated us to this adoption of children of Jesus Christ by himself to himself according to the good pleasure of his will he wants to share it all with us amen and so uh he's placed us and I'm going to try and get this for the young people in a moment amen about it says adoption but we're going to tell tell you what the Greek means of it amen and so praise the Lord that uh amen uh the good good pleasure of his will to the praise and glory of his grace wherein we are accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through the blood you know I think I mentioned it a couple of weeks ago to to brother Ronald and didn't he do a wonderful job last Sunday amen down in Louisiana if you heard that amen and you know something folks hallelujah it's getting nigh where it's more than a sermon it's more than a sermon hallelujah it's taking you somewhere where you want to go amen hallelujah and so it was wonderful praise God and uh amen this is this is a hav predestinated US onto the adoption of children and whom we have Redemption through the blood you know uh there was a a man he must have been a minister and just a couple of weeks before Billy Graham died amen uh he was talking to that man and he said is there anything that you would like kind of regret or that you would would have done better or You' have done more he said yes he said I never preached enough about the cross and I never preached enough about the blood amen I tell you what it's not all jumping up and down is it Hallelujah but it's real it's real folks Hallelujah the cross you got to carry your cross amen I I was praying for a dear one there and I should conf through such a lot and I said dear God dear Lord Jesus someone had to carry your cross to get you to Calvary Hallelujah now will you carry their cross amen the your pastor with that still fighting every day needing strength amen we got to keep praying for him Hallelujah we got to keep praying for him amen and we'll see the result amen we'll see the result praise God hallelujah did you notice he said come next year amen well that's thinking well he'll be here next [Laughter] year that's what he's planning to do amen amen he's not he's not planning to go anywhere soon amen praise God hallelujah amen God will not mock him he'll honor his faith praise the Lord I remember when my wife came out of that I see you and she she woke up amen and the first thing I looked down at her and the only thing I could say brother under is Sister Jacqueline God has honored your faith that's what it's all about fa oh Faith you can could preach all night about faith amen hallelujah and so praise the Lord now amen and we've got the Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace I shouldn't read it all but wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will all the Mysteries that we need to know about the Rapture amen praise the Lord about Christ about God hallelujah he's revealed the mystery of himself that Christ is the mystery that was all was in him and all is in him Hallelujah and by him all things were created and for him all things were created that means you and me Hallelujah to be part of him and to be enjoyed by him amen now for our young people tonight and I'll say if you're under 90 I'll cify he a young person okay on adoption they may be thinking sitting in a what what's this man talking about here tonight and if you do have any questions Andrew is your go-to man amen okay amen so praise God hallelujah n but amen the the the Bible term does not match in any way the legal term that we would understand it that a couple that might have a child and they can apply for adoption and a little baby might be presented and they'll adopt that little baby amen that's that that's the U that's the natural way the legal way in the land today amen but that's not what this word adoption means amen this adoption means and I'm going to say it to you Hallelujah if I can go right back to the word amen it's very hard to say it in Greek but I'm going to try my best we o s e amen we o s e that is what the word adoption means now you got to break that word up into two parts amen there is two parts to it and so the first part means a son and the second part means a placing that's what the word so every time I've read that tonight as a son is placed hallelujah amen and he is a son and he's placed something higher than he's ever known before happens to him amen and so praise God for that and uh that signifies the place and condition of a son given to one whom it does not naturally belong but he's given it to us Hallelujah by predestination amen and you know you've been taught it here for years that you were born a Son of God you were born a Son of God but you didn't know it amen you were just a sinner amen but you didn't know you were a son there was a germ of life in you a germ of God was in you like there's a germ of life in every seed that you can produce I brought I brought a potato seed down to the the the the the church I brought a little uh a lemon seedat down as well well and you can go for apple seeds or whatever seed you want but they'll bring forth after their own King you'll never get an apple tree to bring forth a lemon would not happen and so it's the same with the seed that was in us that just germ of life we were just waiting like Nathaniel was willing that day to meet Jesus Christ and when he met him he says Ah an Israelite in whom there was no G how do you know me Lord I saw you I saw you this morning I know where you were I know Jesus could said to him would you like to tell me what you prayed cuz I could tell you word for word did you ever hear brother brandham say that you lady down here you've got this hat on you've got these gloves there and a poer DOT he said if I told you word for word what you just prayed would you believe just think about it that's how real it was Hallelujah that's how real it is cuz the word has to come to the bride it has to come to the bride amen so praise God that's what we're looking for amen men and uh so because of the Fall we we didn't realize we were Sons but we were and then when that light Shone over praise God and the seed was quickened amen we heard that call that call of God somebody said hark do you explain the call of God it's just like the call of the mountains amen there was two guys Irish there would be Irish wouldn't they they were up one of these big mountains over in the Himalayas and they got trapped they got trapped amen and you would I would say to them what on Earth were you doing at that time up on a mountain like that that's what I would say but they would say well because it was there because all right fair enough amen but you know with us hallelujah we heard a call not by the human ear but we heard a call we heard the Master's Call amen it's time to come come on to me all ye that Liber and are heavy L and I will give you rest Hallelujah it's a wonderful thing to have rest in your soul it's a wonderful thing to have peace in your heart tonight and I know I could hear you singing Hallelujah you were rejoicing and praising God that's the way it ought to be amen okay as many has received them he give them the power to become the sons of God Amen we heard that call and through pre predestination it's brought us to Redemption which brings us to adoption we know we're washed in the blood of the lamb and now we want to be placed I want to hear God saying this is my son I'm not there tonight but he's there Hallelujah he's speaking for me exactly the same let me get into it of a May I'll be running out of time if I don't watch amen okay Hallelujah so amen now you know about Jesus you know when he was born that Holy thing that should be born of thee amen shall be called The Son of God so he was the son of God and here he came and he shall be called The Son of God Amen and that's true and I could never understand why by Jews they would say far be it for God to have a son amen it was God himself in human form if they want that more or less they can have it more or less it was God in human form that Jesus Christ was so here we have it amen and uh amen n and after after the bar MIT maybe at 12 and here he is coming forth n as a a young man and he goes down and he's baptized amen and I've watched you praise the Lord you know I could even say this and it's not just such a hazardous guess but I would believe that I watch the baptisms I watch brother Dylan getting baptized there the last one the other night what a what a wonderful thing for a young life to be changed hallelujah praise God to find what I've got that's what we want for everybody we meet we want want them to have what I I've got amen generally over with the Catholics they lost for prayer because my sister-in-law got a a asked from a brother I used to a fellow that I used to work with and he said my wife's got breast cancer uh would would with George can of pray for her like you know they'll do that but if you ask them about about repentance if you ask them would you believe the word would you come into something far greater than the Catholic church can give you they'll not do it amen they'll back away Hallelujah no we don't want that so that's that's these things are there amen but he went in and he was baptized and I was looking uh you know could you imagine a amen when when when uh when Isaac was baptized I'm sure a lot of you were there not night when Isaac amen breeding young Isaac was baptized and and I was there too watching it Hallelujah and I'll tell you what I would say that if Andre really looked over the year he would say that was the moment that was my highlight that was my highlight because he picked up that little boy right here in his arms and he was going to say something and he was just so full up he couldn't he couldn't speak what a wonderful thing that a little boy like that would show faith in Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah amen and that's a wonderful thing amen so praise the Lord and and and the Lord Jesus went in to the water was baptized and he received the Holy Ghost amen it came down upon him in the form of a dove he said this is my beloved Son he was that but he hadn't been placed he hadn't been placed Hallelujah and so that was to come amen and John the said that I bear record that he was the son of God Amen so hallelujah amen amen what what what what the Lord said uh beg your pardon just when he went up to the uh the Mount of transfiguration we'll go from that amen there he went through his ministry and coming up to the close he took them up to the Mount of transfiguration could I want to get it down to you tonight amen see and uh here he was and um amen you know that story and Moses and Elijah appeared to him and talked with him about his decas about what he was going to do at Calvary and Peter always wanted to bit like myself I always want to have a say about

cloud speak this is my beloved Son amen not Elijah not Moses Hallelujah this is my beloved Son H I thank God it's worth worth a hand clap there amen cuz you know I hear your I hear your pastor

folks if I was to drop dead on this platform I would not take this spy it lifted off my shoulder 2,000 weight and I've never had it since never had it since glory to God Amen and so it's real Hallelujah and that's what we always want you know just let me thr this little story for you for me um we have two girls that come down not every Sunday but they come down with their father and he is uh South African and he he he he does little uh uh Zoom calls over to there and whatnot but they do come down and uh the girls were going to University in L County and they got a bill that it would be

you do that five more just five more okay you know the believer positionally placed as a son that God can have confidence in him saying that's my son if he speaks it'll be me speaking H I hope that's tonight you know the Bible says that when when Peter was praying preaching to them Cornelius and it says uh uh that after he preached many words Rema he said those that heard the word the logos they responded to the word hallelujah and that's always the way it's it's going to be amen so praise God here he was and the father wants to do that place you uh in possession as a chosen son that bears his name and has got his authority let me let me read it because brother Bram says amen the the return of the pole gives us a very good picture of it so I just want to H in that a little bit amen and uh praise God so uh the day came when the boy maybe had been all right was a worthy man listened to his father he took the instructions he was a good boy then the father would Place him publicly amen and that ceremony of adoption would take place amen this is my son Hallelujah I'm going to give you a little illustration in a moment before we go home now so pleas in position what it means see that he he was predestinated for that amen and Moses he said was a prefigure these brother bram's quotes and then the son after he came out was given no longer no longer was he a servant under a tutor he was the boss amen that's said could you imagine one minute you're a tutor then you reach the age and and the father says no son you've been shored I can trust you now you're equal with me you're on

wonderful thing here I'm just closing up now amen praise the Lord I still like the paper you know so praise God Amen so here's what brother Bram says he says in my humble opinion he said to the adoption of sons that is to the placing of sons just imagine he had been baptized in the water he had received the fullness of the spirit yet God had to manifest himself and say this is my beloved Son hear ye him Hallelujah that's why we don't need to listen to Moses as regard the law because we're not under the law if you were under the law you wouldn't be be in a pitiful position because it was thou sh thou shal not th sh and you be send did did did do it did I not do it you know You' be but oh my when Grace takes over Hallelujah When Love projects Grace will take over amen and praise God as
