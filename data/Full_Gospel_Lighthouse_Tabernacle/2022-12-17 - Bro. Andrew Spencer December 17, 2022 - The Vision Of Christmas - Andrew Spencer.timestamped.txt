[20:15] something that's not new that we're
[20:17] talking here you know this has been
[20:18] going on

[20:43] want to come in you know when the spirit
[20:46] is moving
[20:47] we want to try to be as relevant as
[20:48] possible we don't want to be moving
[20:51] trying to if your kids got to go try to
[20:53] get them to stay because we don't want
[20:54] to do nothing that way I mean it's the
[20:56] same way with me right here I I don't do
[20:59] nothing wrong with saying anything wrong
[21:00] here to break the spirit right here it's
[21:01] no different for me up here and I take
[21:04] this as a seriousness as them guys right
[21:06] there preaching back here I mean but we
[21:08] want to be as Reverend I mean but we
[21:10] don't want to you know if you see people
[21:12] if it's poor service or stuff the
[21:14] deacons are just going to come up and
[21:15] just tap you on the shoulder just what
[21:17] we've done for years that you know try
[21:20] to be as reverent as possible you know I
[21:22] mean this is not a place to come you
[21:24] know eat and drink I mean I know that
[21:26] people's got health issues that they
[21:28] might need something for sugar or
[21:30] something but we ain't we don't have to
[21:32] make a scene and lay a pack of nabs or
[21:34] or a candy bar out to everybody can see
[21:37] it I mean you could be discreet about it
[21:39] and and not
[21:40] and not make a big scene about it
[21:44] um I mean well even even with our drinks
[21:47] coming in and out you know we're not
[21:48] expecting people's cups I know covet we
[21:51] shut down the water fountains I mean and
[21:53] we that's the right thing to do but we
[21:55] don't have to come in it ain't like we
[21:56] ran Our Last Mile home we got sat there
[21:58] and
[21:59] and and drank 16 ounces you know but we
[22:04] haven't ran we haven't ran Our Last Mile
[22:05] home yet but we head that way
[22:08] but I mean it's just it's just some
[22:11] things that you know we don't want to
[22:12] I'm gonna just you know we don't we
[22:15] don't want to this is not a place I
[22:17] think it's First Corinthians uh First
[22:19] Corinthians 11 around I think the 22nd
[22:22] verse we're not coming here to eat and
[22:24] drink you know we're coming here to to
[22:27] respect I mean if you go to the White
[22:28] House you go anywhere else
[22:30] they ain't gonna let you carry a bottle
[22:32] of water in or jug of them
[22:35] juice or whatever you got I mean just
[22:36] just try to be respectful as we can and
[22:39] when we when we do these things we want
[22:41] to watch our kids
[22:43] the full service after service steering
[22:45] service just try to be respectful as we
[22:49] can I mean if
[22:51] I mean I wasn't perfect my brother went
[22:53] perfect
[22:54] we got I've been on the receiving end
[22:56] and I've been on the giving in
[22:58] when you take your kids out you know I
[23:00] mean look at my mom she's 74 years old
[23:02] didn't bother her she ain't got a
[23:04] gray hair you know
[23:06] I mean just there's some things that we
[23:07] just need to
[23:09] we just need to do you know just
[23:12] if your kids if your kids I mean try I
[23:14] mean if I if sister Cassie got up right
[23:16] here now from that piano
[23:18] I could see her move
[23:20] and I when I was in school I got easily
[23:23] distracted just for being respectful to
[23:25] people around you when you move
[23:27] you're going to distract somebody so
[23:29] just just try to just try to do the
[23:31] right things I mean sometimes the kids
[23:33] they you know everybody don't have great
[23:35] days all the time and so if they're
[23:37] having a bad day don't come and go come
[23:40] and go just try to be respectful to the
[23:41] people around you
[23:44] um
[23:45] this is not a place where we where it
[23:47] was called slumber parties we don't have
[23:49] parties here you know try if you teach
[23:51] your kids be respectful here
[23:53] when they get here they will respect the
[23:56] house of the Lord that's what we that's
[23:58] what we're here for you know we want to
[24:00] teach them the right things here this is
[24:01] where they're going to this is where
[24:03] they make their future right here so we
[24:05] want to do the right things here
[24:07] okay brother Bill did this for years and
[24:10] years he did it probably more regular
[24:11] than I did he he he did it probably on a
[24:14] monthly basis especially he used to get
[24:17] up and sort of direct the young people's
[24:19] meeting we had them years ago and on a
[24:20] monthly basis he used to go over these
[24:23] things so it's not like we're doing
[24:24] something
[24:25] you know just you know if you don't a
[24:28] guy told me and my brother one time he
[24:30] said have some respect for yourself if
[24:32] you don't have it for nobody else
[24:34] I mean
[24:36] I mean and then it just we just want to
[24:39] do the right thing but just be as
[24:40] reverent as we can and and just try to
[24:42] do the right thing so you know we had a
[24:45] coach one time and he harped on this
[24:47] this last thing
[24:49] and I know it's four people still love
[24:51] me here Zoe and I my mom and my wife so

[51:16] he's not unknown to us
[51:18] but he is known
[51:20] he is known what a privilege it is to be
[51:24] called as children certainly I want to
[51:26] say that it's such an honor to have
[51:28] sister Deborah back on the organ again
[51:29] playing for us and we certainly missed
[51:32] her and and we certainly appreciate the
[51:34] gift that the Lord has placed in our
[51:35] life and and I'm so thankful that the
[51:39] Lord's certainly touched her we've we've
[51:41] prayed many prayers for her and I know I
[51:43] know that that sciatica is uh is a real
[51:46] real deal and so we just want to
[51:49] continue to remember her but we
[51:50] certainly want to make her feel welcomed
[51:52] back here and uh
[51:53] [Music]
[51:55] I want to thank Brother David and his
[51:58] family for being here this weekend and
[52:00] thank you for singing my song
[52:04] to think that Jesus chose to be my
[52:06] friend
[52:08] [Music]
[52:14] it's everything
[52:16] when Jesus chooses to be your friend
[52:19] [Music]
[52:21] amen I just I love him so much and
[52:25] there's no way that I could express it
[52:27] with words and
[52:28] nor with nor with my emotions or my
[52:32] the intellects that I have they're
[52:34] inadequate to express how much my Lord
[52:36] Jesus means to me and I want to just
[52:39] take this moment and thank you thank you
[52:41] all here for Gospel Lighthouse for all
[52:43] your your Christmas giving and your your
[52:47] gifts to my children and to my family
[52:49] and I want you to know whether it's
[52:51] popcorn whether it's a gift card or if
[52:55] it's just a card that says God Bless you
[52:57] that's
[52:58] thank you I I don't deserve any of that
[53:02] but I want to say that I really
[53:03] appreciate it and you know I'm kind of
[53:06] like the prophet I enjoy getting those
[53:08] Christmas gifts and and
[53:12] it's something about that that first
[53:13] gift that you get you remember it and
[53:16] I won't tell you who give it to me but I
[53:18] certainly do appreciate it I appreciate
[53:20] every one of them and I love this time
[53:22] of year and and I just look forward to
[53:26] this time of year I wish it could be
[53:28] Christmas
[53:29] you know every day of the year
[53:32] for us as Christians it is we we honor
[53:35] and celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ
[53:39] but you know what I mean it's it's a
[53:42] special time of year when people are
[53:43] happy it's you know it seems like the
[53:46] Christmas spirit's sure getting squeezed
[53:48] out of America anymore but it certainly
[53:51] is nice to see people happy and wishing
[53:53] people Merry Christmas and
[53:56] and they're giving and that's that's
[53:58] Christ right there when you see somebody
[54:00] giving a gift that's Christ and uh
[54:03] so we we just want to maybe just speak
[54:06] to you for a few moments on on the on
[54:08] our Christmas message this evening and
[54:10] and I won't be too long
[54:14] Lord willing
[54:16] and uh
[54:18] but I do want I do have something on my
[54:21] heart and I trust that the Lord will
[54:23] help me to to bring it across to you
[54:25] tonight but if you have your Bibles we'd
[54:27] like to look over in the book of Isaiah
[54:30] the book of Isaiah chapter 9 and verse
[54:32] 6.
[54:37] and then to Matthew chapter one
[54:43] and verse 18.
[54:48] next weekend we will only be having one
[54:51] service on Saturday night we'll be
[54:53] having our our Christmas special and all
[54:56] of our choirs will be singing and
[54:58] brother Ron will be speaking for us
[54:59] there'll be no service on Sunday morning
[55:01] there so we ask you just to be
[55:04] remembering that and we want to give you
[55:06] a time to be with your family and we
[55:08] know where where the people's minds are
[55:10] that's why we want to bring you our
[55:12] Christmas message at this time is
[55:14] because this is a season that where
[55:16] everybody's minds are and
[55:18] and uh you know I feel like if if the
[55:21] prophet would come and he would take his
[55:23] Christmas message during this season I
[55:25] think it's the right thing to do is is
[55:27] to take our Christmas message in this
[55:29] season where we recognize that this was
[55:31] not the hour or the 25th day of
[55:34] Christmas or the 25th day of December
[55:36] was not the day that our Lord and savior
[55:38] was born on but it's a time that we
[55:40] honor it and so we're just looking to
[55:43] the Lord during this season and
[55:45] so let's if you have your Bibles let's
[55:47] look let's look in the book of Isaiah
[55:49] here in chapter 9 and the Bible says For
[55:52] unto us a a child is born and unto us a
[55:56] son is given
[55:57] and the government shall be upon his
[55:59] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[56:01] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[56:04] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[56:07] of the increase of his government and
[56:10] peace there shall be no end upon the
[56:13] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[56:15] order it and to establish it with
[56:17] judgment and with Justice from
[56:20] henceforth even forever the Zeal of the
[56:23] Lord of hosts will perform this Matthew
[56:27] chapter 1 and verse 18.
[56:34] I'm going to let you find your find your
[56:36] scripture reading there in Matthew
[56:37] chapter 1 and verse 18 and before we
[56:40] read it we'll just speak to the Lord
[56:42] let's just bow our hearts just now
[56:44] Heavenly Father what a privilege it is
[56:46] for us as your children to be gathered
[56:48] one more time in this this place Lord
[56:51] that has been set aside a place that
[56:53] Lord that has been sacred for us for so
[56:56] many times in so many years father for
[56:59] us to be able to come here into the
[57:01] house of the Lord and to worship you the
[57:03] true and living God and to recognize
[57:05] that you are king of kings and tonight
[57:07] is no different father we recognize that
[57:10] the same one that has met us time and
[57:12] time again season after season you are
[57:15] here again tonight in your word and in
[57:17] your power father to speak to us
[57:19] according to your word Lord that is that
[57:21] is fit for us in this season and Lord I
[57:24] pray father today that Lord if I could
[57:27] Lord I'd give every person here uh
[57:29] everything that they had need of and and
[57:32] a gift of some way but father I know
[57:35] that I'm inadequate in that but I know
[57:37] father that that there is one in this
[57:39] building tonight that can meet every
[57:40] single one of their needs you can supply
[57:43] all of their wants father those that
[57:45] need healing and those that need a touch
[57:47] father those that maybe just need a
[57:49] further walk with you father a fresh
[57:51] Revival I believe Lord that you're here
[57:54] to do that you said that you said
[57:56] through your Prophet Lord that that
[57:58] every Revival every generation he has a
[58:00] fresh chance at the word of God and I
[58:03] pray father that you would just come
[58:04] behind your word tonight with a
[58:06] Vindicated amen father and you'd
[58:08] minister to us through your through the
[58:10] preaching of the word father I ask God
[58:13] to you just have your will in your way
[58:15] in this service in the name of the Lord
[58:17] Jesus Christ amen Matthew Chapter 1
[58:20] Verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ
[58:23] was on this wise when as his mother Mary
[58:27] was espoused to Joseph before they came
[58:30] together she was found with child of the
[58:33] Holy Ghost and you you adults understand
[58:35] what is there before they came together
[58:37] she was found with child but it matters
[58:40] who she was found of of the the Holy
[58:43] Ghost then Joseph her husband being a
[58:45] just man and not willing to make her a
[58:47] public example was minded to put her
[58:50] away privately but while he thought on
[58:52] these things behold the angel of the
[58:55] Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying
[58:57] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[59:00] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[59:02] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[59:05] Ghost and she shall bring forth the son
[59:08] and thou shall call his name Jesus let's
[59:11] say that together Jesus for he shall
[59:15] save his people from their sins now all
[59:18] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[59:20] which was spoken of the Lord by the
[59:23] prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be
[59:26] with child and shall bring forth a son
[59:28] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[59:31] which being interpreted is God With Us
[59:35] may God bless his word he may be seated
[59:37] in the presence of the Lord
[59:40] I'd like to read just a portion from we
[59:43] have seen his star and have come to
[59:45] worship Him brother Branham says here he
[59:47] said this that I'm speaking of tonight
[59:49] might seem just a little bit unusual and
[59:52] especially of these notes and scriptures
[59:54] that I have written here which I will
[59:56] refer to as many of them takes takes
[59:59] down the scriptures and so forth he said
[1:00:02] it's a little unusual
[1:00:04] but I want you to always bear this in
[1:00:06] mind that God is unusual God does
[1:00:10] unusual things that's the trouble with
[1:00:12] us today that we get set so set in the
[1:00:16] usual things we get so set in the usual
[1:00:19] things that when something unusual takes
[1:00:22] place then we're all out of it and we
[1:00:24] don't know what's happened God does the
[1:00:28] unusual
[1:00:29] and I believe that if we could look at
[1:00:31] these two texts that we've read here
[1:00:33] tonight that we could say that that it's
[1:00:35] unusual to the eyes of humanity that
[1:00:38] it's unusual and it's past the reasoning
[1:00:40] of the intellect of man to to say that
[1:00:43] these things that we've been just
[1:00:45] reading about about that there would be
[1:00:47] a woman that had not known a man that
[1:00:49] she would be with a child of the Holy
[1:00:51] Ghost is very unusual is that right I'd
[1:00:54] like to speak to you tonight or on by
[1:00:56] the help of the Lord or just on a on a
[1:00:58] thought of the vision or the vision of
[1:01:01] Christmas the vision of Christmas and I
[1:01:04] think that I think that if as we just
[1:01:06] draw into just to encapsulate in our
[1:01:09] mind just for a moment or to to to
[1:01:11] gather our thoughts just for just for a
[1:01:14] sacred moment in time here that I
[1:01:16] believe that every one of us here we
[1:01:19] understand that there is this is a very
[1:01:22] beautiful season that we're in and I
[1:01:25] know that I know that Christmas isn't
[1:01:27] necessarily a happy season for every
[1:01:29] body because I understand that that they
[1:01:32] are there that are some that are amongst
[1:01:34] us that have lost family members in this
[1:01:36] season there are there are some that are
[1:01:38] amongst us that have have lost children
[1:01:40] during this time and it could be a very
[1:01:43] sad time and and it could be a time
[1:01:45] where men have men have maybe had hard
[1:01:48] feelings about one another or and they
[1:01:50] don't want to gather get together as
[1:01:52] family as as they should and but maybe
[1:01:55] if just for a moment that you could
[1:01:57] indulge me just maybe to grab the
[1:01:59] attention grab the attention of our
[1:02:01] little ones that are amongst us but I
[1:02:03] believe that everyone here especially us
[1:02:06] young people or or children that we
[1:02:08] envision we envision Christmas as it's
[1:02:11] coming as it comes into its season as
[1:02:13] Mortals we we expect or we envision
[1:02:16] Christmas in in the spiritual and in the
[1:02:20] in the natural we we we we envision what
[1:02:23] Christmas is going to be like I can
[1:02:25] remember as a child growing up what it
[1:02:27] what it was like even though even though
[1:02:29] we wouldn't necessarily we wouldn't
[1:02:31] necessarily have Christmas in our home
[1:02:33] because we didn't want to offend our
[1:02:35] Papa Charlie that didn't necessarily
[1:02:37] believe in everything about Christmas he
[1:02:39] believed in Christ but he didn't believe
[1:02:41] in he didn't believe in having Christmas
[1:02:43] and all of those things but he sure
[1:02:45] didn't mind getting Christmas presents
[1:02:46] but God bless his soul
[1:02:49] but you know we I but I can still
[1:02:52] remember you know because we didn't want
[1:02:54] to offend him and his beliefs and those
[1:02:56] things but but mama still knew how to
[1:02:58] take care of her children but I can
[1:02:59] still remember as a little child of the
[1:03:02] thoughts of Christmas how did it how
[1:03:04] that it ran through your mind you the
[1:03:06] excitement that ran through your mind as
[1:03:08] a child you you just love the you love
[1:03:10] the very thought of it because because
[1:03:12] mama was mama was wrapping gifts and
[1:03:15] Mama wasn't mama was putting popcorn on
[1:03:17] a tree mama and Mama never did that for
[1:03:19] us but maybe she maybe she hung some
[1:03:22] lights on there but we never was that
[1:03:23] old where we had to hang popcorn on
[1:03:25] there but but I'd say probably we would
[1:03:27] have ate it too fast for her to put it
[1:03:29] up there but but you know we we love
[1:03:32] that type and that time of season the
[1:03:35] the the Christmas songs and the lights
[1:03:37] that the lights that are being shown all
[1:03:39] over that that are decorated throughout
[1:03:41] all the decorations they're they're
[1:03:43] beautiful in their color and you know
[1:03:45] you can have your ideas about the
[1:03:47] Christmas lights and and their utensils
[1:03:49] and all of those things but but you know
[1:03:51] that we're going to a city where the
[1:03:53] lamb is the light and if you don't like
[1:03:56] light you better not go to that City but
[1:03:58] but we know that there is walls of
[1:04:00] Jasper in their streets of gold there
[1:04:02] and and to think that as a little child
[1:04:05] it's it's a time of Joy it's a it's a
[1:04:07] time of a time of cheer and a time of
[1:04:10] fun and to think that it's a time when
[1:04:12] as you've gathered in you gather in with
[1:04:15] your family and you you you come in
[1:04:17] together it was a time when we would
[1:04:19] travel down the road and we would meet
[1:04:21] up with family that we hadn't been with
[1:04:22] for for some season it was a time when
[1:04:25] you got off from school and you enjoyed
[1:04:27] those two weeks and you just you enjoyed
[1:04:30] all of those things and you begin to
[1:04:31] look that there was those there was
[1:04:33] those little presents that Mom or
[1:04:35] Grandma or or granddaddy had put
[1:04:37] underneath the Christmas tree there for
[1:04:39] you and and you could go over as a
[1:04:41] little child and you'd grab that grass
[1:04:43] Christmas present and you'd shake it
[1:04:45] with everything Within You Without Mama
[1:04:46] seeing that you was doing it because you
[1:04:48] were trying to figure out what was in
[1:04:50] there mama had a way of wrapping those
[1:04:52] things so that you knew it wasn't a
[1:04:54] basketball in there or or you knew it
[1:04:56] wasn't a baseball bat she knew how to
[1:04:58] wrap those things and you look forward
[1:05:00] to that and I I still look forward to it
[1:05:02] even when Katie ain't looking maybe I'll
[1:05:04] go over and shake a box and see if I can
[1:05:06] find out what's on the inside of it but
[1:05:08] it's a time where it's a time and a
[1:05:10] season where everybody's saying Merry
[1:05:12] Christmas and and I can remember maybe
[1:05:14] even asking our parents if if we could
[1:05:16] just ask open one present before
[1:05:19] Christmas you know maybe just indulge me
[1:05:21] or maybe just let me let me let me open
[1:05:24] one present you know it won't spoil the
[1:05:26] fun for me mama just just let me but let
[1:05:29] me open that one and you can imagine as
[1:05:32] a child the anticipation the
[1:05:34] anticipation as a child expecting
[1:05:37] Christmas to come it's a time when maybe
[1:05:40] maybe as as as as the older ones would
[1:05:42] sit around and they'll talk about the
[1:05:44] old stories it's a time when they'll
[1:05:46] reflect about Christmas they'll reflect
[1:05:48] about Christmas in the past and think
[1:05:50] about sitting around the fireplace with
[1:05:52] their mother and their father and maybe
[1:05:54] they've done gone on and went to be with
[1:05:56] the Lord but they sat around and they'll
[1:05:58] maybe tell stories at Christmas time
[1:06:00] you'll be amazed what you'll hear from
[1:06:03] from an older generation when you get
[1:06:05] them around food and you get there get
[1:06:07] there get their belly full they'll begin
[1:06:09] to tell stories and you begin to think
[1:06:11] about that settling around the fireplace
[1:06:13] and maybe maybe burning the trash off
[1:06:16] the presents and the the boxes and all
[1:06:18] those things and watching it go into the
[1:06:20] fireplace and drinking hot chocolate and
[1:06:22] maybe I hope you're getting a vision of
[1:06:24] what I'm talking about just now and
[1:06:26] sitting around in heaven having coffee
[1:06:28] with one another maybe eating those
[1:06:30] Christmas cookies that honey honey had
[1:06:32] baked for you and she'd done stuck them
[1:06:34] in the oven and man and maybe she just
[1:06:36] got out those Christmas honey buns for
[1:06:38] you and things are just things are just
[1:06:41] right
[1:06:42] things are just right in the home and
[1:06:44] maybe the kids are playing around your
[1:06:46] feet they've got their new games out
[1:06:48] there they're asking you to get
[1:06:50] batteries for them and you're just
[1:06:52] sitting around but that's not Christmas
[1:06:54] at it as a whole we enjoy all those
[1:06:57] things but as real Christians we
[1:06:59] understand the the the the the the the
[1:07:01] season that we're in that it's not just
[1:07:04] about those things but it's about the
[1:07:07] very one that gave us this Christmas
[1:07:09] gift that we can understand the power of
[1:07:13] giving to others and to think that that
[1:07:15] those that have set around and enjoyed
[1:07:18] and maybe maybe you haven't enjoyed that
[1:07:20] and if you haven't enjoyed getting a
[1:07:22] Christmas gift if you ain't got a
[1:07:23] Christmas gift I pray you come see me
[1:07:26] and I'll make sure that you get one
[1:07:28] in understandment
[1:07:30] with a little bit of Liberty I hope you
[1:07:32] understand but I want to make sure
[1:07:34] that's why we try to do our best as as a
[1:07:37] church to make sure that everybody
[1:07:39] understands the power of Christmas
[1:07:43] is a beautiful thing
[1:07:45] but it ain't just about sitting around
[1:07:47] the fireplace and drinking hot chocolate
[1:07:48] to me it was a time setting around the
[1:07:51] fireplace and hearing about what the
[1:07:54] prophet did and hearing about what our
[1:07:56] Lord Jesus Christ did hearing about
[1:07:58] tumors leaving and hearing about things
[1:08:00] of of days gone by when when granddaddy
[1:08:03] would go out and he would have he would
[1:08:05] have he would have tent meetings or he
[1:08:07] would go out and he would go to this
[1:08:08] place and we would reflect about what
[1:08:10] Christ had done to me that's Christmas
[1:08:14] to me it's not necessarily to me it's
[1:08:16] not necessarily about all the things
[1:08:18] that are going on and and the things and
[1:08:21] the busyness of life but to me Christmas
[1:08:23] is all about Christ
[1:08:26] to me to me this is one of the greatest
[1:08:28] season the greatest opportunities and
[1:08:31] many of us will have a great Christmas
[1:08:32] season
[1:08:34] I'd say that every one of us
[1:08:37] I think we're okay here
[1:08:40] I think we're I think we're okay that
[1:08:42] that that that that we have family that
[1:08:45] look out for us
[1:08:46] that try to make sure that that you
[1:08:49] don't go without and it's not
[1:08:51] necessarily just about what you have
[1:08:54] it's about the things that God has given
[1:08:56] you
[1:08:58] it's about the things that maybe you
[1:09:00] don't even see that God's given you
[1:09:02] to me that's Christmas
[1:09:04] many of us will have many of us will
[1:09:07] have a very decorated and a wonderful
[1:09:09] season
[1:09:10] but can you imagine just for a minute
[1:09:13] and begin to Envision the very first
[1:09:15] Christmas
[1:09:18] you begin to think about the very first
[1:09:20] Christmas that there ever was it's not
[1:09:22] necessarily A Christmas like we were set
[1:09:24] here today but it was a Christmas where
[1:09:27] they had went out a decree by Caesar
[1:09:29] Augustus that all the world would be
[1:09:32] taxed that all the world would be taxed
[1:09:35] and here Joseph was heading down to
[1:09:37] Bethlehem you see what was happening was
[1:09:40] Vision Vision was leading them down to
[1:09:43] Bethlehem you see you see they they were
[1:09:47] being led there even though Caesar
[1:09:49] Augustus had had sent out a decree that
[1:09:51] all the world was going to be taxed yet
[1:09:54] prophecy was leading them down to
[1:09:56] Bethlehem
[1:09:58] and to think about as as many of you
[1:10:01] mothers understand this understand the
[1:10:03] carrying the carrying of a child but you
[1:10:07] went maybe in an ambulance or maybe you
[1:10:09] went by your husband carrying you to the
[1:10:11] hospital but Mary the very first
[1:10:13] Christmas was riding on the backside of
[1:10:15] a donkey Mary was riding over the
[1:10:18] deserts over the deserts from Judea all
[1:10:21] the way from Galilee over to Bethlehem
[1:10:23] and we understand that by by tradition
[1:10:26] and men that have been there that
[1:10:28] there's a great Hill that goes that goes
[1:10:30] straight up and it goes over and and
[1:10:33] Joseph and Joseph is leading this
[1:10:35] leading this donkey and Mary riding this
[1:10:38] donkey being ready to bring forth the
[1:10:40] Little Child Jesus and here is the very
[1:10:43] first Christmas that is coming into play
[1:10:45] and all of these all of these things
[1:10:47] that she's and she's riding it and you
[1:10:49] can understand the agony that her body
[1:10:51] is in what is she doing she's about to
[1:10:54] give birth to Christmas to everybody
[1:10:56] that is sitting here she is about to
[1:10:59] give birth to the to the one that is
[1:11:01] going to save the people from their sins
[1:11:04] and to think that they're going up this
[1:11:06] Trail and and the road is the road is
[1:11:09] very Rocky and there's there's camel
[1:11:11] trails that are leading around Judea and
[1:11:13] they're coming up and brother random
[1:11:15] said that there is a there's a great
[1:11:17] Rock there that's about the third of the
[1:11:19] size of a building that we're in he said
[1:11:21] he said he said there he said they begin
[1:11:24] to stop up there at that rock and Mary
[1:11:26] got off Mary got off for the donkey and
[1:11:29] said Joseph I see you're real tired
[1:11:31] right here why don't you maybe just ride
[1:11:33] for a little bit he said oh honey I'm
[1:11:35] not going to do that you get back on
[1:11:37] there we'll write down through there but
[1:11:39] you see Jesus had predestinated all
[1:11:42] things about his coming and about his
[1:11:45] going and here the very first Christmas
[1:11:47] he was riding on a donkey as he's coming
[1:11:50] into Bethlehem and Joseph begins to look
[1:11:54] down over the hill over in the city of
[1:11:56] Bethlehem and there is a bunch of
[1:11:59] there's a bunch of people down there and
[1:12:01] Joseph begins to say to Mary Mary I do
[1:12:04] not believe that we're going to be able
[1:12:06] to get a hotel tonight there's so many
[1:12:08] people that has come in because of the
[1:12:10] taxation of the world because of Caesar
[1:12:12] Augustus I just don't believe that we're
[1:12:15] going to be able to get in there you see
[1:12:17] God had a vision in his mind of where he
[1:12:20] wanted his child to be born at
[1:12:24] in the world for a lamb to be born in
[1:12:27] but in a Manger
[1:12:29] you see it wouldn't be fitting for a
[1:12:31] lamb to be born on the inside of a pink
[1:12:33] decorated hospital room but a lamb had
[1:12:36] to come to a Manger where he felt
[1:12:38] comfortable of being there but as Joseph
[1:12:41] is up there at that rock and Mary is
[1:12:43] beginning to rest up there and she's
[1:12:46] she's resting up there and looking at
[1:12:48] all of these things and Joseph begins to
[1:12:50] drift back and he says Mary he said do
[1:12:54] you recognize have you have you noticed
[1:12:56] that star over there you you see that
[1:12:59] star over there and it seems like it's
[1:13:01] it seems like it's been following us and
[1:13:04] and do you see all of those things and
[1:13:06] when Joseph looked back to Mary her eyes
[1:13:09] were in amazement she said Joseph I have
[1:13:12] watched that ever since we left Judea
[1:13:15] you see there was a star that had been
[1:13:18] following them because there was
[1:13:20] scripture that was laying there you see
[1:13:22] that which was laying there in the
[1:13:24] scripture was a vision that was getting
[1:13:26] ready to become a reality because the
[1:13:28] Bible says said that where there is no
[1:13:31] vision the people perish but there was a
[1:13:34] star that was rising out of Jacob that
[1:13:37] would lead them to a place that where
[1:13:39] the very first Christmas that there ever
[1:13:41] would be and here the very amazement of
[1:13:45] Christmas was upon Mary's face as his
[1:13:48] star is looking she said I have I've
[1:13:50] seen that all throughout our journey
[1:13:52] I've seen it hanging there yonder what
[1:13:55] do you think that means Joseph
[1:13:59] what was it what was prophecy was now
[1:14:02] becoming fulfilled and what was becoming
[1:14:05] fulfilled was now a reality do you
[1:14:08] recognize that you and I have a vision
[1:14:10] of what Christmas is going to be like we
[1:14:12] have an understandment that we're going
[1:14:14] to get together maybe with your family
[1:14:15] you have an arrangement that you're
[1:14:17] going to get together maybe at 12
[1:14:19] o'clock in the day and maybe you
[1:14:20] exchange some gifts and have a family
[1:14:22] meal and go over devotions but do you
[1:14:25] realize that God had a vision for
[1:14:27] Christmas but you see his vision is
[1:14:29] isn't like our vision his vision was to
[1:14:33] free his people from the grip of the law
[1:14:35] right out of the jaws of death and the
[1:14:38] show to Satan that he was the Lord over
[1:14:41] all the Earth to show that he owned all
[1:14:44] the cattle on a thousand hills do you
[1:14:47] recognize that Caesar Augustus could
[1:14:49] have never gave out that decree unless
[1:14:51] God had already thought about it but you
[1:14:54] recognized that many years ago that God
[1:14:57] had a conference he had a conference and
[1:15:00] brother said that he he had a conference
[1:15:02] whether there would be a Christmas or
[1:15:04] not he said but there was a conference
[1:15:06] made in heaven what this Plan of
[1:15:08] Redemption would be and he said it was a
[1:15:11] decided by God that he would become a
[1:15:13] man and that he would come down and take
[1:15:15] his own curse upon himself and it would
[1:15:18] not be fair he said it wouldn't be fair
[1:15:20] for him to send an angel he said it
[1:15:22] wouldn't be fair for him to send any
[1:15:23] other person he said even if he had a
[1:15:25] boy he would not be fair for him to send
[1:15:28] his boy he said it would not be fair for
[1:15:30] me to sin or make my Joseph suffer for
[1:15:33] the things of my own judgment he said I
[1:15:35] wouldn't be just in doing so he said if
[1:15:38] I passed my judgment he said want to
[1:15:40] redeem it he said the only thing that I
[1:15:42] can do is suffer it for myself he said
[1:15:45] that's the sign he said that's the
[1:15:48] Deathstroke to Satan he said now my
[1:15:50] Catholic brother he said also many of my
[1:15:52] Protestants he said I'm not hurting you
[1:15:54] but you try to make Jesus a little
[1:15:56] Lesser God than God making him a little
[1:15:59] Lesser God he said you could elf his
[1:16:01] feet and you bring him down just a
[1:16:02] little bit under the head of God and
[1:16:04] make him a Lesser God and you're so
[1:16:06] wrong he said Jesus was a man he called
[1:16:09] himself the son of man he said that was
[1:16:12] the death blow to the devil you see
[1:16:14] there was a conference in heaven years
[1:16:16] ago that Jesus that God said I'm not
[1:16:19] going to send an angel down I'm not
[1:16:21] going to send Abel down I'm going down
[1:16:24] there myself to think that you and I
[1:16:27] wouldn't understand the power of
[1:16:29] redemption unless that conference had
[1:16:31] took place that there was going to be a
[1:16:33] Christmas
[1:16:35] do you recognize that God had a
[1:16:38] conference in heaven that there was
[1:16:39] going to be a Christmas so that you can
[1:16:42] understand the power of giving so that
[1:16:44] you can understand the power of
[1:16:46] redemption and the understanding the
[1:16:48] power of the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:16:51] saves you from the grip of sin of all
[1:16:53] the mistakes in your life that that held
[1:16:56] bound you held you Bound by your DNA
[1:16:58] markers of things that were laying there
[1:17:00] maybe things that maybe things that you
[1:17:03] couldn't get out of but because there
[1:17:04] was a conference that he said there was
[1:17:07] going to be a Christmas he allowed us to
[1:17:09] catch the vision that there would be a
[1:17:12] Christmas that he would come he would be
[1:17:14] born like a man you see if there would
[1:17:17] have been no Christmas there have been
[1:17:18] no cross if there had been no cross
[1:17:21] there would have been No Grave if there
[1:17:23] would have been no Christmas there would
[1:17:24] have been no Resurrection if there'd
[1:17:26] been no Christmas there'd have been no
[1:17:28] Redemption if there had been no
[1:17:30] Christmas there'd have been no Rapture
[1:17:31] thank God that he had a conference that
[1:17:34] we could have a Christmas
[1:17:37] and God had a way that he was going to
[1:17:39] unwrap his Christmas present
[1:17:46] God had a plan
[1:17:48] it's amazing that you know we we spend
[1:17:51] time and we spend time we got our list
[1:17:54] together
[1:17:55] we got to listen together how things are
[1:17:57] going to go out and what we're going to
[1:17:58] pick out for everybody but God already
[1:18:00] had a plan about how he was going to get
[1:18:02] you out of this whole chaos before you
[1:18:05] ever got here and he decided to wrap the
[1:18:07] greatest Christmas gift on the inside of
[1:18:10] a womb of the little girl by the name of
[1:18:12] Mary that God had an escape plan on the
[1:18:15] inside of that little Mary that was
[1:18:17] riding on that donkey up there when it
[1:18:20] didn't look like anybody had the
[1:18:21] Christmas spirit down there nobody
[1:18:23] wanted Jesus down there nobody wanted
[1:18:25] him in the end because they were already
[1:18:28] full but you see there is a people in
[1:18:30] the land today they are wanting to give
[1:18:33] him room and give him access to the
[1:18:35] throne room of their heart
[1:18:38] that's the vision of Christmas and here
[1:18:41] this little girl she was meditating on
[1:18:45] the scripture that was laying there
[1:18:50] the random said that
[1:18:53] that it was Joseph and Mary's tradition
[1:18:57] it was their tradition
[1:18:59] on Sunday evenings
[1:19:02] to go out and to have a little bible
[1:19:04] study
[1:19:06] here here is
[1:19:09] here's Joseph and Mary
[1:19:13] espouse to be married
[1:19:16] and they're having a Bible study I
[1:19:18] believe we can get a good lesson right
[1:19:20] there
[1:19:22] mother Madam I think it's amazing that
[1:19:24] brother Brandon would give us the
[1:19:25] insight to be able to look back all the
[1:19:28] way those 2000 years ago and look into
[1:19:30] Mary's life
[1:19:32] and to see that see that she'd went in
[1:19:34] there and she goes in there and grabs a
[1:19:37] scroll
[1:19:38] she goes in there and grabs a scroll and
[1:19:40] brings it out to Joseph and Joseph
[1:19:42] begins to read it as it begins he begins
[1:19:44] to read over in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6
[1:19:47] For unto us a son is born unto us a
[1:19:50] child is given and she asked Joseph
[1:19:53] brother and said she asked Joseph can
[1:19:55] you read that again
[1:19:57] can you read that again he said
[1:19:59] something something about that scripture
[1:20:02] had stuck out to mix it stuck out to
[1:20:04] Mary he said that that scripture seemed
[1:20:07] to grip that little child that little 16
[1:20:09] year old girl and he said she couldn't
[1:20:11] get away from that scripture he said
[1:20:13] what is it referring to it's referring
[1:20:16] that there was a messiah that was to
[1:20:19] come and directly after that she just
[1:20:22] read the scripture brother random said
[1:20:24] that she was walking down a little dusty
[1:20:26] road and she was going down through
[1:20:28] there and he said she had her mind she
[1:20:31] had her mind on the things of God and
[1:20:33] she was thinking she was she was
[1:20:36] thinking about these things she wasn't
[1:20:38] even noticing what was around her but
[1:20:40] she was thinking about the promises that
[1:20:42] God had laid out in the scripture
[1:20:45] mother random said that she didn't even
[1:20:47] notice who was standing around her and
[1:20:49] he said as she was thinking all of a
[1:20:52] sudden there it appeared a light and out
[1:20:54] of that light step to a six-footed man
[1:20:56] by the name of Gabriel and he said Hail
[1:20:59] Mary fear not for thou Hast found favor
[1:21:02] with God
[1:21:04] you see because he had kept her mind on
[1:21:07] what God had said now God had chose
[1:21:09] little Mary before the foundation of the
[1:21:11] world but the elect of God keep God on
[1:21:14] their mind at all times
[1:21:16] and she kept God on her mind she was
[1:21:18] thinking on these promises and out of
[1:21:21] those promises stepped an angel
[1:21:23] out of that promise stepped an angel and
[1:21:26] he began to speak to her the very things
[1:21:28] of Life brother random said if you want
[1:21:31] angels to appear to you keep your mind
[1:21:33] on God and off the things of the world
[1:21:35] he said go about your business go to
[1:21:37] church go to washing your clothes
[1:21:39] wherever you are whatever you are keep
[1:21:42] your mind on him all day and all night
[1:21:44] he said then God will do something to
[1:21:47] think that there she was rolling over
[1:21:50] those scriptures in her mind
[1:21:53] foreign
[1:21:59] I'm trying my best I'm trying my best to
[1:22:01] paint you a picture
[1:22:02] but the preacher in me wants to bra he
[1:22:04] wants to jump out right here
[1:22:10] I'm gonna try my best to hold him back
[1:22:11] but I don't think I don't think y'all
[1:22:13] gonna allow me to
[1:22:14] but just to think that she's allowing
[1:22:17] these scriptures to roll over her mind
[1:22:20] she's letting these scriptures roll over
[1:22:22] her mind she can't get away from him
[1:22:24] something has gripped that virgin that
[1:22:27] she can't get away from it and she what
[1:22:30] did it do the scripture that had been
[1:22:31] released to her in that season now
[1:22:34] notice there is a thousand other
[1:22:36] marriage out there there's a thousand
[1:22:38] other people out there by the name of
[1:22:40] Mary there's another thousand people out
[1:22:42] there had already read that scripture
[1:22:44] but this was the Mary that God had
[1:22:47] foreordained Hallelujah before the
[1:22:49] foundation of the world that she would
[1:22:51] be a virgin don't you see what this
[1:22:54] bride is in this day she's espoused to
[1:22:57] one husband she's got a virgin she's got
[1:22:59] a virgin womb hurts she's virgin in her
[1:23:02] mind she's virgin in her soul she's
[1:23:04] virgin in a womb
[1:23:07] and she's not been manhandled she's not
[1:23:10] been put aside she's not given over to
[1:23:13] man's intellects but the seed of
[1:23:15] almighty God has trapped on the inside
[1:23:17] of her heart and the virgin that's
[1:23:20] bringing forth the same son of man again
[1:23:22] today
[1:23:24] what was it because she had her mind
[1:23:28] because she had her mind on the
[1:23:30] supernatural it moved her body into the
[1:23:34] supernatural don't you realize what the
[1:23:36] son of man has done in this generation
[1:23:38] because you have kept your mind stayed
[1:23:42] on almighty God it will move your body
[1:23:44] right into the supernatural there's
[1:23:47] another Mary in the land that knows what
[1:23:49] he does once done with the Lord
[1:23:51] and because she's kept her mind a
[1:23:54] Malachi 4 because she's kept her mind on
[1:23:57] the seventh star it will change her body
[1:24:07] Mary don't you worry about this
[1:24:10] don't you worry about everybody else is
[1:24:12] going to say about you don't you worry
[1:24:14] about what they say about my message
[1:24:16] that I'm bringing to you because my
[1:24:18] message is from the Holy Ghost Mary I
[1:24:21] want you to understand that you are the
[1:24:24] very first one that is going to
[1:24:25] experience this Mary I want you to
[1:24:28] understand that that which is being
[1:24:30] conceived on the inside of you is the
[1:24:34] Holy Ghost
[1:24:38] let me tell you Jesus ain't got two Gods
[1:24:41] he ain't got two fathers he is birthed
[1:24:44] by the Holy Ghost and you ain't got two
[1:24:47] fathers you've been born again by the
[1:24:50] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:52] [Applause]
[1:25:03] she begins to
[1:25:07] she begins to tell Joseph
[1:25:11] you imagine
[1:25:12] what this is like
[1:25:14] he ain't here he's back here
[1:25:17] you imagine bro Seth Sister Sarah Beth
[1:25:20] comes to you
[1:25:21] said look baby
[1:25:28] I got this little bump
[1:25:33] I don't know it's gonna be a little hard
[1:25:35] for you to understand but it ain't the
[1:25:36] sweet potato casserole
[1:25:47] where's your brother
[1:25:50] Seth is going to take your breath away
[1:25:53] you ain't gonna believe this
[1:25:55] I know it's gonna be hard for you to
[1:25:57] believe but I met an angel
[1:26:00] and that angel told me that I was going
[1:26:02] to bring forth a son and we were to call
[1:26:05] his name Jesus now I can't explain
[1:26:07] everything to you Joseph
[1:26:09] foreign
[1:26:10] but that which is born on the inside of
[1:26:12] me
[1:26:13] is of the Holy Ghost and brother random
[1:26:16] said that Joseph was such a Believer he
[1:26:19] said he wanted to believe her he said
[1:26:20] but the thing was it was so unusual he
[1:26:24] said it was so unusual that he just he
[1:26:27] couldn't understand it and he wanted he
[1:26:29] was a just man he said I don't want her
[1:26:31] to be stoned I know what the law said
[1:26:33] about this that if a woman is caught
[1:26:35] outside if she's caught outside that
[1:26:37] she's going to be stoned to death by the
[1:26:39] law I'm a believer of the law
[1:26:42] and he's thinking up but this thing is
[1:26:44] so unusual but you think tonight that
[1:26:47] God has a way of revealing the unusual
[1:26:50] to those that have their minds stayed on
[1:26:53] him and Joseph kept his mind upon the
[1:26:57] Lord and he said and he began to talk
[1:26:59] about these things and the Bible said
[1:27:01] that while he was thinking on these
[1:27:04] things the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:27:06] him in a dream
[1:27:08] now you realize that he couldn't come to
[1:27:10] him in a vision because there was no
[1:27:12] prophet in that day anybody came to him
[1:27:15] in a secondarily way he came to him he
[1:27:18] came to him in a dream
[1:27:20] but he didn't have to worry about
[1:27:22] understanding the dream because the
[1:27:24] dream wasn't in symbols because the
[1:27:26] angel Gabriel laid out all the details
[1:27:29] of the birth don't you recognize that
[1:27:32] the very message that Mary was preaching
[1:27:34] to Joseph the angel Gabriel brought the
[1:27:38] same message
[1:27:41] Hallelujah don't you understand that
[1:27:44] what William Branham broke was the same
[1:27:46] thing that Paul brought was the same
[1:27:49] thing that's being brought to you
[1:27:50] tonight
[1:27:51] the angel knows how to bring a message
[1:27:54] to a woman
[1:27:57] Joseph chose to be her protector
[1:28:01] is chosen by almighty God to protect her
[1:28:04] throughout throughout this prophecy it
[1:28:07] is given his charge to watch over her
[1:28:09] and he said he he said you know I know
[1:28:12] it's an unusual story for you and it's
[1:28:15] the unusual thing and I know that you're
[1:28:17] all tore up about this Joseph but that
[1:28:19] which is being done on the inside of her
[1:28:22] is the Holy Ghost don't you understand
[1:28:24] that the people that the reason why so
[1:28:27] many people around this message are
[1:28:29] shook up and tore up it's because the
[1:28:32] Holy Ghost is working in a body again
[1:28:34] and so many people are getting so
[1:28:37] Disturbed and so upset because they're
[1:28:40] not seeing they acts to in operation in
[1:28:43] their Church
[1:28:44] and they think well we're just a bunch
[1:28:46] of Pentecostals down here Full Gospel
[1:28:48] Lighthouse I beg to differ with you what
[1:28:51] you're tore up about is the Holy Ghost
[1:28:55] I know it may seem unusual that you
[1:28:58] might get into a conventional atmosphere
[1:29:00] and all of a sudden an eagle screams out
[1:29:03] an eagle screams out what is it it's
[1:29:06] this type of atmosphere where eagles are
[1:29:08] born at and you see the angel Gabriel
[1:29:11] couldn't meet Mary just in any circum
[1:29:13] Place certain place it had to be where
[1:29:16] the atmosphere was right and she set the
[1:29:18] Atmosphere by her faith and her faith
[1:29:21] brought the angel down and the angel
[1:29:23] brought the blessing
[1:29:25] don't you recognize what you're doing
[1:29:28] you are bringing the angel to your
[1:29:31] situation
[1:29:32] and Christ
[1:29:36] is born again
[1:29:38] in you
[1:29:44] forgive me
[1:29:46] I'm not a very good artist
[1:29:50] but Joseph
[1:29:52] was going to assist in Prophecy to bring
[1:29:55] to fulfillment what God had in his mind
[1:29:58] that he was going to be a protector he
[1:30:02] recognized what the angel was doing
[1:30:04] he was sowing out to Joseph that you are
[1:30:07] to be a protector of the anointing
[1:30:11] now notice notice there's prophecies and
[1:30:14] I ain't got time to read it to you all
[1:30:15] tonight but I'll just maybe preface some
[1:30:18] of it but there was prophecy that was
[1:30:20] laying there throughout all the Old
[1:30:22] Testament about the birth of Jesus
[1:30:24] Christ that Jesus would be The Offspring
[1:30:27] of the woman and she shall bruise he
[1:30:30] shall bruise the Serpent's head in
[1:30:32] Genesis 3 and 14 but the Bible tells us
[1:30:35] in Galatians 4 but when the fullness of
[1:30:38] time was come a God sent for the son
[1:30:41] made of a woman what was it that which
[1:30:44] was prophecy was now made a reality
[1:30:48] the Hebrews 2 and 14 tells us that God
[1:30:51] sent for the son made of a woman made
[1:30:53] under the law
[1:30:55] excuse me I just read that again to you
[1:30:57] that through the death that he might
[1:30:59] destroy him the Bible said in First John
[1:31:02] 3 and 8 that the Son of God was
[1:31:05] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:31:07] works of the devil
[1:31:09] there was scripture laying there that
[1:31:11] all nations would be blessed through
[1:31:13] Abraham there was scripture laying there
[1:31:15] that Jesus was to be born in the town of
[1:31:18] Bethlehem of Judea which was laying
[1:31:21] there in Micah chapter five and two and
[1:31:24] it was fulfilled in Matthew Chapter 2
[1:31:26] and 1. there was scripture a prophecy
[1:31:29] laying there that Jesus was to be born a
[1:31:32] king of the line of David
[1:31:35] and it was fulfilled there was scripture
[1:31:38] laying there that the Messiah would be
[1:31:40] child would be a child to be born which
[1:31:42] is Isaiah 9 and 6 which was fulfilled in
[1:31:46] Luke 2 and 11. and there is scripture
[1:31:48] laying there that the Christ will be
[1:31:50] born of a virgin Isaiah 7 and 3 which
[1:31:53] was fulfilled in the Virgin Mary in Luke
[1:31:56] chapter 1 and verse 26.
[1:32:00] there was scripture laying there
[1:32:02] that Kings would bring him gifts
[1:32:06] and fall down before him Psalm 72 and 10
[1:32:10] and it was fulfilled when the wise men
[1:32:13] or the magi's in Matthew Chapter 2 when
[1:32:16] they came and laid down their gifts unto
[1:32:18] him of gold frankincense and myrrh there
[1:32:21] was scripture laying there that the
[1:32:23] Messiah would be of the seed of Jacob
[1:32:25] that hero would rise a star out of Jacob
[1:32:28] of numbers 24 and 17 and it was
[1:32:31] fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ there
[1:32:34] was scripture laying there that Jesus
[1:32:37] was to be a rod out of the stem of Jesse
[1:32:39] Isaiah 11 and it was fulfilled in our
[1:32:43] Lord Jesus Christ there was scripture
[1:32:45] laying there in Jeremiah 31 of a
[1:32:48] massacre of children after Jesus was
[1:32:51] born
[1:32:52] and you remember what Herod did what was
[1:32:55] he trying to do he was trying to stop
[1:32:58] the very birth of Jesus Christ from
[1:33:01] getting into the world what was Satan
[1:33:03] trying to do he was trying to stop
[1:33:05] Christmas
[1:33:07] what was Satan trying to do he was
[1:33:10] trying to kill out every influence of
[1:33:12] the Messiah getting on Earth you watch
[1:33:14] what Satan is trying to do he's tried
[1:33:16] again to attack you in your strength
[1:33:20] he's trying to kill out the birthright
[1:33:22] he's trying to kill out your experience
[1:33:26] there was scripture laying there in
[1:33:29] Micah chapter 5 and verse 2 that Jesus
[1:33:31] would be the ruler over all of Israel
[1:33:34] and he would be from Everlasting to
[1:33:36] Everlasting and the Bible tells us that
[1:33:39] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:33:41] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:33:44] I'd say that Jesus fulfilled that
[1:33:48] there's prophecy after prophecy that was
[1:33:51] laying there that this was to be the one
[1:33:53] that was to come
[1:33:55] there was prophecy laying there that
[1:33:58] Jesus was to be born of the tribe of
[1:34:00] Judah and that's exactly what the Bible
[1:34:02] said in Genesis 14 or 49 and 8 through
[1:34:06] 10 that Judah Thou Art he whom thy
[1:34:09] Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be
[1:34:12] in the neck of thine enemies and the
[1:34:14] fathers thy children shall bowed him
[1:34:16] before thee Judaism from the prey my son
[1:34:20] Thou Art gone up he stood up he couched
[1:34:23] as a lion and as an old lion who shall
[1:34:26] raise him up the scepter shall not
[1:34:28] depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from
[1:34:30] between his feet unto shallow come and
[1:34:33] unto him shall the Gathering of the
[1:34:36] people D people be notice what Micah 5
[1:34:39] and 2 says Thou though thou be little
[1:34:42] amongst the thousands of Judah to think
[1:34:45] that this that God would choose a place
[1:34:48] by the name of Bethlehem that was
[1:34:50] established by the mother Ruth
[1:34:54] foreign
[1:34:55] hallelujah what was it the Bible tells
[1:34:58] us that it is evident that our Lord
[1:35:01] sprang out of Judah it is evident that
[1:35:04] the Bible gives us a genealogy in
[1:35:07] Matthew chapter 1 laying out the lineage
[1:35:09] or the genealogy of our Lord Jesus
[1:35:11] Christ that he would pass through Judah
[1:35:14] he would beget say rest that was of
[1:35:16] steam heart to think that God would
[1:35:19] choose a lineage
[1:35:21] that was so corrupt
[1:35:23] to bring Christmas
[1:35:28] but he had to come out of Judah
[1:35:34] but the Bible said in Revelations 5 and
[1:35:37] one of the elders saith unto me weak not
[1:35:40] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:35:43] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:35:45] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[1:35:48] thereof don't you realize that where I
[1:35:51] have taken you is down and a road of
[1:35:54] Emmaus that prophecy is made clear that
[1:35:58] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[1:36:06] all of this
[1:36:08] wrapped up in one child
[1:36:12] there's a hundred more I could give you
[1:36:19] they didn't want him in herod's house
[1:36:25] they didn't want him at the end
[1:36:29] they didn't want him down at the church
[1:36:30] of Christ
[1:36:32] but he found the place that he was
[1:36:35] destined to be born at
[1:36:42] you see even in your own life
[1:36:46] something was calling you all of your
[1:36:49] life
[1:36:50] it seemed like as a little child
[1:36:53] that you didn't want to do things like
[1:36:55] other children wanted to do
[1:36:58] you didn't want to have a part of their
[1:37:00] dirty games
[1:37:02] or the dirty jokes
[1:37:04] you didn't want to have a part of their
[1:37:06] ideas of what fun was it was something
[1:37:09] that was laying on the inside of you
[1:37:13] which we know is a gene seed of God
[1:37:16] mother Branham would take a text from
[1:37:18] Psalms chapter 42 on a deep cause to the
[1:37:22] Deep
[1:37:26] and to think that
[1:37:27] there was something that was yearning on
[1:37:29] the inside of you you remember when
[1:37:31] brother brother Brown would tell about
[1:37:33] that little boy
[1:37:34] he was lacking sulfur in his body
[1:37:37] he'd got to eat in bicycle bicycle
[1:37:39] pedals tell you what that'd have been a
[1:37:42] sight to see right there
[1:37:46] but it was something on the inside of
[1:37:47] him that was calling
[1:37:49] I'm sorry I envisioned something right
[1:37:51] there
[1:37:54] you imagine Gabriel lacking sulfur in
[1:37:56] his body and going out and on a bunch of
[1:37:58] bicycle pedals all the Mennonites they
[1:38:01] ain't peddling nowhere this weekend
[1:38:14] laughs
[1:38:17] well this is Christmas
[1:38:28] wow forgive me
[1:38:34] but something on the inside of me he
[1:38:35] said before there could been a fence on
[1:38:38] a Fishback he said there had to be water
[1:38:41] for him to swim in
[1:38:42] and before you could ever find your way
[1:38:45] to the Lord Jesus Christ he had to
[1:38:46] Prevail a way for you to get to him
[1:38:50] and when Satan would try with all of his
[1:38:53] power to keep you from all the the power
[1:38:56] of Christmas and the power of our Lord
[1:38:58] Jesus Christ he had already provided a
[1:39:01] way for you to get to him
[1:39:03] and to think that that there was there
[1:39:06] was people that had been looking for him
[1:39:08] for thousands of years Moses testified
[1:39:10] of him Isaiah testified of him even the
[1:39:14] Magi that were over there over there in
[1:39:17] the countries they were they were
[1:39:18] looking up there and brother banham said
[1:39:20] that brother Bantam said that they were
[1:39:21] watching the stars and they they'd study
[1:39:24] the stars he said we would call them
[1:39:25] astrologer in the states he said but
[1:39:27] they studied the stars and they looked
[1:39:30] at all the stars and they they were
[1:39:32] watching and they they were sitting
[1:39:34] there and each brother said that they
[1:39:36] grabbed over out of the Book of Daniel
[1:39:38] and they began to read out of Daniel
[1:39:41] that he would there would be a stone cut
[1:39:43] out of the mountain and he they began to
[1:39:46] read over that and they were reflecting
[1:39:47] over it and there they were sitting
[1:39:49] around their sacred fires he said they
[1:39:52] were sitting around there
[1:39:53] and he said all of a sudden they begin
[1:39:55] to look up at the skies and he said
[1:39:57] there was a stranger in the skies he
[1:39:59] said they began to look up there into
[1:40:00] the skies and they couldn't find where
[1:40:03] they they took all the notes they took
[1:40:05] all the measurements and said look
[1:40:07] there's a new star up there there's
[1:40:10] something strange about that star up
[1:40:12] there we don't have this documented
[1:40:14] brother random said they seen that there
[1:40:15] was a strange repair let me put it to
[1:40:18] you like this when the seventh star came
[1:40:20] into view in this generation there was
[1:40:22] people that looked out and said there's
[1:40:24] a star there's a stranger player and we
[1:40:26] don't understand how it got here but we
[1:40:29] are reflected we are to go to that story
[1:40:32] do you think to understand that tonight
[1:40:35] that before the Seven Star could be
[1:40:37] released it had to be in the hand of our
[1:40:40] Lord Jesus Christ and before it could
[1:40:42] grab your attention to run to Malachi 4
[1:40:45] and see Revelations 10 that they are the
[1:40:48] Son of God had looked on you
[1:40:52] to think that this star would lead those
[1:40:56] wise men to a little bitty child that
[1:40:59] would be the Messiah of the whole world
[1:41:01] and to think this seventh star has led
[1:41:04] us through the evening light that'll
[1:41:06] lead us
[1:41:08] that'll lead us right into a rapture
[1:41:12] you forgive me but that's Christmas
[1:41:15] you forgive me but Malachi 4 brought the
[1:41:18] greatest Christmas gift that I've ever
[1:41:21] known in all of my life when he brought
[1:41:23] to me the revealed word an unsealed book
[1:41:26] A book that's been opened so that I can
[1:41:29] understand
[1:41:30] what's on the inside of the gift
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:43] it passed over every Observatory
[1:41:47] but it came by their way
[1:41:49] there could have been more than three
[1:41:52] but the Bible tells us that there was
[1:41:54] three gifts that was brought to him
[1:41:56] this wasn't some Santa Claus makeup this
[1:41:59] was not some myth
[1:42:00] but all of these gifts
[1:42:03] had details of his birth had details of
[1:42:06] his life and details of his death
[1:42:09] God has a way of bringing his gifts to
[1:42:12] the body
[1:42:14] so that it reflects him
[1:42:17] this Christmas
[1:42:20] this Christmas
[1:42:33] there's going to be a bride in preview
[1:42:40] and if it's going to be set out
[1:42:43] previews before it goes on display
[1:42:46] and a bride is coming into preview and
[1:42:49] this Christmas I wonder
[1:42:53] are you reflecting
[1:42:55] what Christmas is
[1:42:59] we enjoy the lights
[1:43:01] we enjoy the presents
[1:43:04] but what has been unwrapped before you
[1:43:09] is the gift of salvation
[1:43:13] the gift to never walk back to the life
[1:43:15] that you once know
[1:43:17] the gift to leave leave anxiety where
[1:43:20] it's at
[1:43:22] the gift to leave all of your burdens
[1:43:24] of losing a loved one a losing a family
[1:43:27] member
[1:43:28] this gift that has been unwrapped before
[1:43:31] your eyes
[1:43:33] is our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:41] you remember
[1:43:44] you remember that little child
[1:43:48] that was standing he had never seen a
[1:43:50] mirror before
[1:43:53] and he went over there
[1:43:55] to a family's home that had him here
[1:43:57] and you remember what the little boy did
[1:44:00] he looked at it and he thought he wanted
[1:44:01] to play with that little boy
[1:44:03] he was looking at him he'd move and he'd
[1:44:06] move he'd talk back to him he'd come to
[1:44:08] find out
[1:44:09] that was him in the mirror
[1:44:12] this Christmas
[1:44:15] did they see all you're giving or do
[1:44:16] they see Chris Christ
[1:44:24] do they see
[1:44:26] the seventh seal in you
[1:44:29] do they see Christ The Mystery of God
[1:44:31] revealed in you
[1:44:35] do they see what this message is
[1:44:38] in you
[1:44:44] if we're going to be on display
[1:44:46] I want to display him in all of his
[1:44:48] attributes
[1:44:52] it's a beautiful season
[1:44:55] it's a beautiful season
[1:45:00] and we enjoy sitting around and
[1:45:03] taking our turn
[1:45:04] unwrapping our present
[1:45:09] but what if this year
[1:45:11] you're sitting there
[1:45:14] and you have your morning devotion
[1:45:16] before you go into your unwrapping of
[1:45:18] gifts and you have your family time of
[1:45:20] prayer
[1:45:23] and all of a sudden appears your loved
[1:45:25] one
[1:45:30] to think about
[1:45:32] all that this message has meant to you
[1:45:34] and and what it's done how it's brought
[1:45:37] you so many miracles
[1:45:41] there's a portion that I I've not got
[1:45:43] here too but
[1:45:47] you think about all the Miracles that
[1:45:49] are been stacked up in this just this
[1:45:51] church
[1:45:52] and there are so many connections across
[1:45:54] the world that that we we could testify
[1:45:57] of but do you think about what those
[1:45:59] were was gifts from God
[1:46:05] there's a story
[1:46:07] there's a story about
[1:46:12] about
[1:46:13] it's just a story
[1:46:16] but
[1:46:18] there's these great big conveyor belt in
[1:46:20] heaven
[1:46:23] and all these presents are going out
[1:46:25] across this
[1:46:27] conveyor belt
[1:46:29] it's a bunch of little gifts going
[1:46:31] and there's a conveyor belt of big gifts
[1:46:32] over there
[1:46:34] and it seems to be just setting Steel
[1:46:37] and the conveyor belt of little gifts
[1:46:39] keeps going out going out going out
[1:46:40] going out
[1:46:41] that none of the big gifts go out
[1:46:45] finally somebody asked so why
[1:46:48] why aren't those big gifts going out and
[1:46:50] God said well
[1:46:51] nobody asked for those things
[1:46:54] they always ask for the little ones
[1:46:57] don't be afraid to ask
[1:46:59] for big things
[1:47:02] you know I never did hurt
[1:47:04] to ask Mama to get another another
[1:47:05] Mustang again I didn't get it but it
[1:47:08] didn't hurt to ask

[1:47:22] three years for the Lord to heal my
[1:47:24] daddy
