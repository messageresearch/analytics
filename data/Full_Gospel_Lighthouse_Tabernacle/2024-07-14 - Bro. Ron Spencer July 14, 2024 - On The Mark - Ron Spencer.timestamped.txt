[53:24] and May the angels of God protect them

[53:28] this nation to be at peace that's what
[53:31] we desire to have it as good as we can

[53:36] but we're we know in the scriptures when
[53:38] you came here to save us that was lost
[53:42] they took your life and what a brutal
[53:45] murder that they did now Lord Jesus we
[53:48] know they'll never be able to touch you

[54:02] service if we're not prepared to go to
[54:05] that place I ask you that in this moment
[54:08] today that you'd bring us into a
[54:10] position to where that we can come up to
[54:12] your Heaven Lord minister to us we thank
[54:15] you and praise you without you we're no
[54:18] speaker and we just ask you that you'd
[54:20] help us now in Jesus Christ's name amen
[54:23] and amen you can be seated
[54:32] when I walked by brother Nathan today I
[54:34] I had prayed a prayer in the back and I
[54:37] heard brother Andrew say what he said
[54:39] that Andrew Nathan had told him that I
[54:41] was one of his favorite preachers and
[54:44] and I prayed in the back and I said Lord
[54:47] if if you don't come I won't be nobody's
[54:49] favorite preacher that's right but you
[54:52] know by the help of the Lord we've we've
[54:54] been blessed through the years and
[54:56] brother Nathan is I remember preaching
[54:58] to him when he was just a little boy and
[55:01] next time I'd go see him and he was a
[55:03] big boy and the next time I would see
[55:05] him he was taller than I was and amen
[55:08] I'll never catch up to you
[55:13] now amen I'm glad that God is a god of
[55:16] variety he wants tall people and he
[55:19] wants short people and skinny people and
[55:22] I'm not even going
[55:24] there amen
[55:26] what a mess we'd be if we were changing
[55:28] oursel up all of the time wouldn't it be
[55:30] a
[55:31] mess in second Peter chapter 1 and verse
[55:34] 16 the scripture tells us and says for
[55:38] we have not
[55:40] followed cunningly divis fables this is
[55:44] quite a statement when we were made
[55:46] known unto you by the power of the
[55:48] coming of our Lord Jesus but were
[55:50] eyewitnesses of his majesty he stood
[55:54] there on the Mount of transfiguration
[55:56] and watch Moses and Elijah with Jesus
[55:59] there what a what an event that had to
[56:02] be for he received from God the Father
[56:06] honor and Glory when we were were come
[56:09] such a voice to heaven to him from the
[56:13] excellent Glory this is my beloved Son
[56:18] in whom I am well pleased and this voice
[56:21] which came from heaven we heard when we
[56:25] were with him in the Holy Mountain Mount
[56:29] we have also a more sure word of
[56:32] Prophecy we're unto you do well that you
[56:35] take heed as into a light that shineth
[56:38] in a dark place until the day Dawn and
[56:41] the day star arise in your hearts
[56:43] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[56:47] the scripture is of any private
[56:49] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[56:52] in Old Time by the will of man but holy
[56:55] men of God spake as they were moved by
[57:00] the Holy
[57:02] Ghost 40 writers but one
[57:07] author 40 writers but one
[57:10] author now remember this God's purpose
[57:15] can never be
[57:17] defeated if we could repeat that over
[57:19] and over today that would be an
[57:21] incredible thing God's purpose can never
[57:24] be defeated there is nothing that can
[57:27] defeat it so happy we ought to be today
[57:30] resting in that beautiful revelation of
[57:32] the word of God that there is neither
[57:34] things
[57:37] present nor things that can
[57:40] come there's no sickness there's no
[57:44] sorrow there's no death no perils nor
[57:48] nor nothing can separate us from the
[57:51] purpose of God you know we're quoting
[57:53] from Romans 8 what God has a imagine in
[57:56] his mind what God has purposed in his
[57:58] heart to bring to pass there's no demon
[58:02] we ought to sound that loud enough to
[58:03] the devil hears it there is no demon
[58:07] there's no power there's nothing going
[58:09] to separate us from great God's Great
[58:13] Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God
[58:18] has said it that's right I heard brother
[58:20] Nathan speaking last night no way he
[58:22] would know what I would speak this
[58:24] morning and he would talk about about
[58:26] the seed and that seed has everything
[58:29] inside of it for life's journey growing
[58:33] from from a seed under the pond or a a
[58:36] seed on a farm or whatever it be it has
[58:39] all the potentials laying inside of that
[58:42] little bitty seed now I want you to
[58:45] remember God deposited a seed inside of
[58:52] you aren't you thankful for that he
[58:55] predestinated Jew and that seed has the
[58:58] power within itself to become the
[59:02] Eternal thoughts of God that's right now
[59:04] where you're at now is just a temporary
[59:07] part of you and you look at all of your
[59:10] temporary parts and the stuff that you
[59:13] have went through in life and there's a
[59:16] lot of pages if we could write out the
[59:18] pages of your history there's certain
[59:21] pages brother Chris we'd rather to leave
[59:23] out
[59:26] because there's nobody knows
[59:30] you like you know
[59:33] you amen why didn't you say your wife
[59:37] well you know you better than your wife
[59:39] knows
[59:42] youen there's Pages you know that we
[59:45] would like to say I I would rather that
[59:48] that wasn't there but if you can think
[59:51] of it once this life is over with those
[59:54] pages are gone
[59:59] we will never know Moses as a man with
[1:00:01] high
[1:00:02] temper we will never know David as a man
[1:00:05] that K killed Abba uh bash sheeba's
[1:00:09] husband we'll never know people of that
[1:00:12] realm anymore it'll be done away with
[1:00:17] sin will be gone failures will be gone
[1:00:21] those situations will will be just be
[1:00:23] stuff
[1:00:26] so in this realm of Flesh we look at
[1:00:29] each other through the glasses of
[1:00:33] stuff and we know each other by the
[1:00:36] Realms of mistakes and failures and
[1:00:38] frustrations and overcoming life's
[1:00:41] journey but but in that realm through
[1:00:43] the blood that has been applied and our
[1:00:46] bodies being changed we'll never have
[1:00:49] these glasses on
[1:00:53] anymore that ought to make you shout am
[1:00:57] now and taking sides with Jesus he says
[1:01:00] what if God would have told John the
[1:01:04] Revelator now it's going to be 2,000
[1:01:06] years before my coming and John would
[1:01:09] have come back and told the church well
[1:01:12] I guess we might as well eat drink and
[1:01:15] be married cause there's going to be
[1:01:18] many
[1:01:20] generations and Jesus ain't going to be
[1:01:22] coming back for 2,000 years 2,000 years
[1:01:25] plus now and he says so see the church
[1:01:30] would have been
[1:01:31] loose amen I want you to watch this term
[1:01:34] now there would have been no on the
[1:01:39] mark there would have been no waiting
[1:01:42] there would have been no
[1:01:44] expectation and after all it's your
[1:01:47] anticipations if you fall asleep in that
[1:01:50] watch that you awake with the same
[1:01:53] anticipations cuz it ain't going to
[1:01:55] hinder one thing you're going to be
[1:01:58] right there on
[1:02:00] time amen see what I mean when when St
[1:02:04] Martin awakes in the resurrection and St
[1:02:08] Paul and the rest of them it'll be just
[1:02:11] as
[1:02:12] fresh what a realm of Eternity cause
[1:02:16] they went right down under the same
[1:02:19] anticipations looking for his coming and
[1:02:22] there will come a scream coming oh
[1:02:26] Hallelujah and it will come for the
[1:02:29] whole church that's how it'll be so it
[1:02:32] doesn't
[1:02:34] matter doesn't matter when you went to
[1:02:37] sleep it what doesn't matter when your
[1:02:39] bodies wore
[1:02:41] out you'll wake with the same
[1:02:44] anticipations of the resurrection and
[1:02:47] the Rapture as you went into the ground
[1:02:50] with now I want you to just think about
[1:02:52] totally to the on the mark and it has a
[1:02:56] serval different meanings and i' let you
[1:02:58] just drop this to you on the mark means
[1:03:01] to be totally accurate
[1:03:06] right
[1:03:07] 100% totally accurate right totally
[1:03:15] unmovable
[1:03:16] 100%
[1:03:19] correct it
[1:03:21] means even an
[1:03:23] ownership the belong in to thee I love
[1:03:27] that last night because it fits right
[1:03:33] here as Jesus would say belonging to
[1:03:38] me he prays his last prayer in John
[1:03:41] chapter
[1:03:42] 17 I pray for
[1:03:45] them they are
[1:03:50] mine I want you to just notice and and
[1:03:52] and here's a good way to put it
[1:03:56] there's a good way to put it on the mark
[1:03:59] that's where we want to
[1:04:02] be I don't want to be 50% right come
[1:04:07] on I don't want to be 75%
[1:04:11] right are you with me now now I want you
[1:04:14] to just think about this would any of us
[1:04:18] go to church if you were 177%
[1:04:22] right I don't think so David you
[1:04:25] wouldn't come here and want to come and
[1:04:27] just hear 177% truth but I'll guarantee
[1:04:31] you most of us audience got up this
[1:04:34] morning and looked at the weather
[1:04:40] channel and do you know they're 17%
[1:04:45] right they're 17 I hope we don't have a
[1:04:47] weatherman here this morning I don't
[1:04:50] mean to offend you but I understand
[1:04:52] you're not in control of
[1:04:54] nature we were on the road coming down
[1:04:56] here last night and it was just raining
[1:04:58] real hard about 5 minutes from here and
[1:05:01] sister Connie said I hope we're getting
[1:05:02] that at
[1:05:03] home and I was thinking I hope we're not
[1:05:06] getting that at to church right now or
[1:05:08] we're going to be soak and wet trying to
[1:05:10] get out of the
[1:05:11] car and Nancy's Hair is just going to be

[1:05:18] thoughts aren't you glad that man is not
[1:05:21] in control of the weather
[1:05:25] and I'm really glad that Grace is not in
[1:05:28] control of
[1:05:29] man I'm glad that Mercy is not in
[1:05:32] control of
[1:05:35] man now let let me just share a couple
[1:05:38] more a statement called cracking the
[1:05:40] Whip and this kind of goes with both of
[1:05:43] these statements here he said they he's
[1:05:47] talking about an animal between a
[1:05:48] thorough bread and a mu he said they
[1:05:50] stick out their ears and don't know
[1:05:52] where they belong mule he said what what
[1:05:55] do you mean where where where did get
[1:05:57] all of this what do you mean the Holy
[1:05:59] Ghost and I've never heard anything
[1:06:01] about it and he said you have to have
[1:06:04] some of this Fanatics and and that they
[1:06:06] don't know who their papa is or their
[1:06:08] mama is either and you and and you have
[1:06:11] to beat them around in everything you do
[1:06:14] and beat them here and beat them there
[1:06:15] and beat them over here and beat them
[1:06:17] there that's just an old
[1:06:20] mule but I tell you you don't have to do
[1:06:23] that to a thoroughbred horse
[1:06:26] you just crack the whip over him one
[1:06:29] time and brother he's
[1:06:33] gone I like a thorough breed horse I I I
[1:06:36] I I like
[1:06:38] horses in my office there's
[1:06:40] about 30
[1:06:43] horses and he he
[1:06:49] statues thought I better clear that up
[1:06:56] he knows what he's doing oh how fine he
[1:06:59] is to ride a thorough bread he how nice
[1:07:03] it is to say come on boy and oh man you
[1:07:06] better hold on tight he'll leave you in
[1:07:10] the saddle in the middle of the
[1:07:13] air and that's the way it is with a
[1:07:15] thoroughbred Christian I'm getting to
[1:07:17] you receive you the Holy Ghost repent
[1:07:20] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:07:22] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:07:25] of your sins they're just
[1:07:27] gone just as quick as they can get to
[1:07:30] the water they can't rest day or night
[1:07:32] until they receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:07:34] know a Christian knows who his papa is
[1:07:37] and
[1:07:39] it the mule don't know which way Mama or
[1:07:42] daddy or Papa or who papa is or who mama
[1:07:46] is but for we that are born of the
[1:07:49] written word of God that's confirmed by
[1:07:51] the spirit said on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:54] if you will repent and be baptized every
[1:07:57] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:59] for the remission of your
[1:08:01] sins you shall receive the gift of the
[1:08:05] Holy Ghost and breth a real born again
[1:08:09] Christian on his Spirit as soon as he
[1:08:11] gets the word he receives the Holy Ghost
[1:08:15] and in him then something then he knows
[1:08:18] where he's
[1:08:20] standing he knows where he's standing he
[1:08:23] knows about Divine healings and he
[1:08:26] believes he believes in the second
[1:08:29] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he's
[1:08:32] born
[1:08:34] again oh I love that don't you now I you
[1:08:39] know I'm going to share with you just
[1:08:42] for a moment human
[1:08:45] flaw I was around when secret
[1:08:49] Secretariat w a Triple Crown is anybody
[1:08:52] in the building old enough to remember
[1:08:54] Secretariat
[1:08:56] and it was a horse that was just a
[1:09:00] phenomenal
[1:09:01] animal and and I Repent to you I didn't
[1:09:05] go to church that night because of now
[1:09:08] this is before Connie and I got
[1:09:10] married it was before I really got saved
[1:09:13] and but my
[1:09:15] grandma loved anything that I
[1:09:18] loved and she said you know you want to
[1:09:20] be here to see the race and I
[1:09:23] did and you can calculate about how old
[1:09:26] I was I was a late teenager and we were
[1:09:29] sitting there and now it's going to be
[1:09:32] the last race he's worn he's worn two
[1:09:35] legs of the Triple Crown he's a he's a
[1:09:38] long horse he's actually a his heart was
[1:09:41] actually bigger than the normal horse
[1:09:43] and and uh everybody seemed to be
[1:09:46] betting against him but he was a
[1:09:49] phenomenal phenomenal athlete of an
[1:09:52] animal and and that animal you know they
[1:09:55] that was before all of this scientific
[1:09:58] video stuff and that animal as it was
[1:10:01] getting in the in the stocks how many's
[1:10:04] ever seen a horse
[1:10:06] race
[1:10:08] amen yeah some have you seen it you're
[1:10:11] too afraid to raise your
[1:10:15] hands and so those animals they've
[1:10:18] warmed them up all morning and they're
[1:10:20] getting them ready and they've walked
[1:10:21] them and they've let them they've let
[1:10:23] them just do a little Trot now they
[1:10:24] don't wear them out but you know they
[1:10:26] trained that animal properly and the
[1:10:28] jockey on it he weighs about 120 lbs I
[1:10:32] graduated from school being about that
[1:10:35] size and so and so anyway he he knows
[1:10:39] how to handle that horse now the
[1:10:41] trainers got him ready but that jockey
[1:10:43] has the
[1:10:44] responsibility to at the right time turn
[1:10:48] him
[1:10:49] loose now the jockey's the jockey's not
[1:10:52] going to do the running on
[1:10:56] the jockey's not going to do any of the
[1:10:58] running but he knows the potential
[1:11:00] that's laying in this
[1:11:03] horse it doesn't matter once they get in
[1:11:07] the gate and how they take off if he's
[1:11:09] in number 16 or he's in number 10 all he
[1:11:13] knows is we have the potential to be
[1:11:16] number
[1:11:18] one when it comes out of the gate and so
[1:11:21] this animal Secretariat I'm just going
[1:11:23] to use it Secretariat steps in the gate
[1:11:25] now that animal he is ready and he knows
[1:11:28] as he's getting toward the gate he
[1:11:30] starts putting his feet down like this
[1:11:32] right here and as he's putting his feet
[1:11:34] down he knows what's getting ready to
[1:11:35] happen and he steps into the stocks and
[1:11:38] you know he he don't he he don't want to
[1:11:40] stand
[1:11:42] still cuz he knows what he's built for
[1:11:45] and he knows what he's bred for he's a
[1:11:48] thorough bread
[1:11:57] and he steps in the stocks and he's
[1:11:59] standing there and the rider he knows
[1:12:01] he's waiting he's just watching him and
[1:12:03] he's stopping those feet and he knows
[1:12:05] that gate is going to open and it's
[1:12:07] going to open at a certain second and
[1:12:10] and when he gets ready it's going to be
[1:12:12] a
[1:12:14] launch it's going to be a launch he
[1:12:17] can't be sitting there thinking about
[1:12:18] eating a peanut butter and
[1:12:20] sandwich he knows that this animal's
[1:12:23] getting ready to turn loose and all of
[1:12:25] the force that's inside of him is
[1:12:28] getting ready to happen we can eat grass
[1:12:31] tomorrow we can eat oats tomorrow this
[1:12:34] is the moment that I've been bred
[1:12:45] for he's standing there his muscles are
[1:12:48] riching he's
[1:12:50] ready and he's on the mark
[1:12:55] he's on the
[1:12:56] mark
[1:12:58] now that that jockey has a term called
[1:13:04] crack the
[1:13:06] whip he doesn't crack the whip standing
[1:13:09] in the
[1:13:12] stocks as a matter of fact he doesn't
[1:13:14] crack crack the whip the first 50 yards
[1:13:18] because he knows that animal's got it in
[1:13:21] him and he just starts carrying himself
[1:13:24] carrying himself there may be 20 in
[1:13:28] front of him it doesn't
[1:13:32] matter this is a personal
[1:13:40] race
[1:13:42] now now I want you to think and I want
[1:13:44] to bring you to a couple of
[1:13:46] spots here if I may and just share a
[1:13:50] couple of statements with me with you if
[1:13:53] you will I'm having a lot of trouble I
[1:13:55] feel like that horse standing in there
[1:13:58] amen cuz I know where I'm going I I saw
[1:14:01] where you were going last night with
[1:14:03] Joshua and the son and I felt like
[1:14:05] stomping my feet for a while so I'm
[1:14:08] having trouble keeping my feet still
[1:14:10] here for just a few seconds amen there's
[1:14:14] a scripture that
[1:14:15] says and this is one of my favorite
[1:14:18] scriptures and I'll tell you why in just
[1:14:19] a moment in Hebrews 11 and verse 37 they
[1:14:24] were Stone
[1:14:26] and they were saw
[1:14:28] asunder were
[1:14:31] tempted were slain with a
[1:14:33] sword they wondered about in sheep skins
[1:14:37] and in Goat stins being tested tested
[1:14:41] destitute and Afflicted and
[1:14:44] tormented the scripture now says of whom
[1:14:47] the world was not
[1:14:49] worthy don't ever just sweep across that
[1:14:55] previous scripture these were people's
[1:14:59] lives that's right these were brothers
[1:15:02] and sisters of
[1:15:03] ours that found that serving God was
[1:15:07] worth
[1:15:10] amen being
[1:15:12] stoned being son a
[1:15:15] su because serving God is
[1:15:19] greater than anything in this
[1:15:22] world it's not a it's not a conven
[1:15:25] gospel it's not a gospel when you feel
[1:15:28] like it we are sold
[1:15:30] out let me just say we are sold out it's
[1:15:34] not me and the world it's me and
[1:15:40] Jesus being stoned there's nothing Grand
[1:15:44] about that but it was worth it to serve
[1:15:46] God sir being son a
[1:15:49] suer it was difficult in the moment but
[1:15:53] what a reward yes
[1:15:58] sir
[1:16:00] destitute your family's left you
[1:16:02] everything is and you're
[1:16:05] alone

[1:16:32] Afflicted but I'm not
[1:16:38] quitting I'm Afflicted but I'm not going
[1:16:42] backwards how many's been
[1:16:45] Afflicted but not
[1:16:50] defeated somebody ought to say Amen
[1:16:52] right there they Wonder in deserts and
[1:16:55] in mountains and dens and caves of the
[1:16:57] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:17:01] good report through faith receed not the
[1:17:04] promise but God having provided some
[1:17:08] better thing for
[1:17:11] us and they without
[1:17:15] us we're the final
[1:17:18] Runners we're the final
[1:17:21] Runners having provided some better
[1:17:24] thing for us that they without
[1:17:27] us should not be made

[1:17:35] great cloud of
[1:17:39] witnesses are you with me this is better

[1:18:55] the race that is set before
[1:18:59] us are you with me now read this next
[1:19:02] one with us together looking unto Jesus
[1:19:06] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:19:10] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:19:13] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:19:16] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[1:19:18] Throne of God
[1:19:29] he says I was going into a baseball
[1:19:31] football
[1:19:33] stadium and I seen a little thing
[1:19:35] hanging over the wall that's always
[1:19:36] stuck with me it said it's not the size
[1:19:40] of the dog that's in the
[1:19:45] fight it's the size of the
[1:19:48] fight that's in the
[1:19:51] dog do you mind repeating that with me
[1:19:54] just now
[1:19:55] it's not the size of the dog that's in
[1:19:58] the fight it's the size of the fight
[1:20:01] that's in the
[1:20:03] dog of course Connie didn't know what I
[1:20:05] was getting ready to preach and so we've
[1:20:08] been away for a week and sister Stephany
[1:20:10] has kept our
[1:20:12] dogs and we have we
[1:20:15] have we have a dog Whitney has a dog
[1:20:17] they're brothers and sisters they're
[1:20:19] twins and
[1:20:21] so they're what they're two
[1:20:28] sisters and my name mine is named
[1:20:31] Dorothy and she they
[1:20:35] are they're
[1:20:37] bernardes po
[1:20:39] Doodles so that means that one part of
[1:20:42] the dog is a poodle and the other is a
[1:20:45] Burmese mountain
[1:20:47] dog I'll give you a little history
[1:20:50] here about a year
[1:20:52] ago I was in the hospital middle and I
[1:20:55] and I was walking in the hall and you'll
[1:20:58] like this and I I was walking and the
[1:21:01] Burmese mountain
[1:21:03] dog was going down the hall and the
[1:21:05] trainer was with it and I said can I
[1:21:08] have a moment with this dog and I got
[1:21:10] down and that dog just licked all over
[1:21:13] me and she said do you have an
[1:21:16] attachment to this dog and I said I do I
[1:21:19] said they brought this dog when I had
[1:21:22] brain surgery and my head was
[1:21:25] wrapped and this dog climbed up in the
[1:21:28] bed and laid there with me and I fell in
[1:21:32] love with these kind of dogs and I said
[1:21:35] so now we have a Burmese mountain dog
[1:21:37] that's with a poodle now my dog took
[1:21:41] after the
[1:21:47] poodle it's got black all over you
[1:21:49] stands about that tall it's in your lap
[1:21:53] it's in the bed it's licking all over
[1:21:55] you it's the best it's the best caring
[1:21:59] dog that you can have Whitney's
[1:22:03] dog took after somebody's
[1:22:16] neighbor now you got a story to go with
[1:22:19] that and her dog is about that tall so
[1:22:24] con Connie is telling me not knowing
[1:22:25] what I'm going to preach this morning
[1:22:27] Connie is telling me said you know
[1:22:30] Stephanie's dog is
[1:22:33] a
[1:22:35] Sharky it's an Abomination before
[1:22:38] [Laughter]
[1:22:41] [Applause]
[1:22:48] God and that dog is about this
[1:22:53] tall and it's got an attitude that
[1:22:55] thinks it's this
[1:22:57] [Applause]
[1:23:01] big and so it's the King of the Hill
[1:23:04] though it be this tall and this big and
[1:23:08] I can just imagine our two dogs with it
[1:23:10] this week and they've got an also a
[1:23:13] loving attitude so I don't know how it
[1:23:15] all worked
[1:23:16] out it worked out okay good I'm really
[1:23:19] glad it
[1:23:20] did you know but I've met some
[1:23:23] Christians that were this big and they
[1:23:26] thought they were this big I'm preaching
[1:23:28] to you
[1:23:30] now they were this big and they thought
[1:23:33] they were this big D you getting the
[1:23:35] picture they were this big and they
[1:23:37] thought they were this
[1:23:39] big and I've met Christians that were
[1:23:41] this
[1:23:44] big and knew how big they
[1:23:46] were and they were ready to
[1:23:50] fight now let me just say this you as
[1:23:52] Christians we don't fight one another
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:57] we were built to destroy the kingdom of
[1:24:01] hell that's what we were built to
[1:24:12] do now in Revelations chapter 1 Jesus is
[1:24:16] standing there with you and his right
[1:24:19] hand now you say well brother Ron he had
[1:24:22] seven stars in his right hand but
[1:24:24] remember you was within one of those
[1:24:26] Stars you were under the influence of
[1:24:29] one of those Stars so so he has each one
[1:24:32] of those stars and he's going to release
[1:24:34] you at a specific time you could not
[1:24:37] have lived in Paul's day cuz he didn't
[1:24:39] build you for that
[1:24:41] day you could have not lived in John
[1:24:44] West's day cuz he didn't build you for
[1:24:45] that day you were built for this
[1:24:50] day now listen you were ordained to open
[1:24:54] over
[1:24:55] come so God specifically builds
[1:24:59] you as as clay in The Potter's hands and
[1:25:04] send you into the Earth you're nobody's
[1:25:09] accident you were fearfully and
[1:25:12] wonderfully made he knew how tall you
[1:25:15] would be how heavy you would be he knew
[1:25:17] everything about you eye color that's
[1:25:19] right your eye is nobody else has an eye
[1:25:22] like you nobody else has a fingerprint
[1:25:25] like
[1:25:26] you what a great big God that you and I
[1:25:30] serve he not only created the
[1:25:34] universes in plural form but he built
[1:25:37] you specifically so
[1:25:41] individually that he would meet you on a
[1:25:44] personal
[1:25:45] level nobody in this building has your
[1:25:52] experience every one of you has a
[1:25:54] personal experience with
[1:26:02] God Amen now I want to I want to just
[1:26:06] drop just a few names if I
[1:26:09] can and if you're here Satan you
[1:26:12] remember these people amen CU they
[1:26:14] really worked on your kingdom now I want
[1:26:17] you to just think when they're released
[1:26:19] at a certain time this is not Hollywood
[1:26:24] life isn't going to be
[1:26:26] perfect so let's just St start with John
[1:26:31] Wesley now John Wesley is going to be
[1:26:33] the leader of the Methodist movement he
[1:26:37] doesn't know
[1:26:39] it but all he knows is his father's
[1:26:41] Church
[1:26:44] stinks he can't see anything of God in
[1:26:47] his father's
[1:26:49] church and so he begins he can't preach
[1:26:52] there and they kick him out and he gets
[1:26:55] a box and preaches on the street and
[1:26:58] begins to assemble congregations as a
[1:27:01] matter of fact John
[1:27:03] Wesley will preach
[1:27:06] 88,000 sermons amen an average of eight
[1:27:11] sermons a
[1:27:13] day now I want you to just think just
[1:27:15] for a moment brother Bram says that 20
[1:27:18] minutes of anointed preaching is equal
[1:27:21] to eight hours of work so I'm going to
[1:27:24] get about 16 hours here so he preaches
[1:27:28] that John Wesley will be
[1:27:31] hated he'll be hated you may hear a
[1:27:35] different story but he will be hated he
[1:27:38] will be stoned many times in his
[1:27:41] life and when he thinks his accusers are
[1:27:45] done stoning he'll lay there for a while
[1:27:48] until they're gone and after a bit he'll
[1:27:51] climb out of those stones
[1:27:55] and go home and make plans to go preach
[1:27:58] tomorrow listen when God puts something
[1:28:00] in you there's no he doesn't have a jar
[1:28:03] called
[1:28:06] quit he doesn't have a jar called
[1:28:09] coward it is overcoming power he's got
[1:28:14] driven he's got passion he's got
[1:28:16] determined he's got purpose that he
[1:28:19] plants on the inside of you and there's
[1:28:22] no going back
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:32] might interest you to know John was not
[1:28:34] a great big Goliath of a
[1:28:36] man 5 foot
[1:28:39] one I like that I like to say it it just
[1:28:42] sounds nice 5 foot one and redheaded on
[1:28:48] for those that you knew me earlier in my
[1:28:51] life I was just
[1:28:55] red as it can
[1:28:57] be my wife said she would never marry a
[1:29:00] preacher or a redheaded
[1:29:06] man Andrew will you stand up and show
[1:29:08] him your red
[1:29:14] hair now everybody blames me for the red
[1:29:17] hair but right there sets the guy that
[1:29:22] Vernon can we move
[1:29:26] on okay well that's a man brother Ron
[1:29:29] okay I'll pick a
[1:29:31] female Fanny Crosby anybody ever heard
[1:29:34] of
[1:29:36] her she's born
[1:29:39] blind she's born
[1:29:41] determined she's born with purpose in
[1:29:44] her life her purpose is going to be to
[1:29:47] write thousands of hymns that you and I
[1:29:51] sing today
[1:29:54] they invite her to a prison meeting a
[1:29:57] prison where prisoners are are are are
[1:30:01] being preached to and during the
[1:30:04] preaching the pastor has preached he's
[1:30:07] done with a service and when he gets
[1:30:09] done there's a prisoner screams out in
[1:30:12] the back of the building pass me not oh
[1:30:15] gentle
[1:30:16] savior and she writes the song pass me
[1:30:20] not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry
[1:30:31] she was born in poverty and she would
[1:30:35] die in povert
[1:30:37] tre you know sometimes as a Christian we
[1:30:40] think well if everything's not going
[1:30:42] great we must be doing something wrong
[1:30:45] it may be because God wrote your
[1:30:50] book in a certain way that you could
[1:30:52] overcome even in pover
[1:30:56] tre cuz the rich man's going to have
[1:30:59] much greater hardship I'm quoting Jesus
[1:31:02] now than the poor man is going to
[1:31:04] have so here she is in povert tre and
[1:31:08] she was offered incredible amounts of
[1:31:11] money to write songs for the
[1:31:16] world but she refused it and she turned
[1:31:19] it down it would have made her life much
[1:31:22] easier she's getting getting ready to go
[1:31:24] into her house one day and they begin to
[1:31:26] make fun of her Fanny how will you know
[1:31:29] him when you get there how will you know
[1:31:32] him you've been blind all of your life
[1:31:34] and she said I shall know him I shall
[1:31:37] know him I shall know him by the nail
[1:31:40] scars in his
[1:31:49] hands she said one day that she was
[1:31:51] thankful that she was born blind
[1:31:59] because she never got to see the sin of
[1:32:03] the
[1:32:03] world and the first time that she was
[1:32:06] able to see she would see her loving
[1:32:09] savior what a
[1:32:12] statement a man named Charles finny are
[1:32:15] you are you okay with me Charles finny
[1:32:18] would be a preacher in Rochester New
[1:32:20] York and as he would preach people
[1:32:24] newspaper writers would come and know
[1:32:26] want to know what the attraction of
[1:32:28] Charles FY was because thousands are
[1:32:30] coming to hear him and they said that he
[1:32:33] had a nasal nose SP speech and it was
[1:32:39] hard to listen
[1:32:40] to amen he was hard to listen to because
[1:32:44] of his
[1:32:45] nasly speech that he would preach
[1:32:49] with but let me just say this to you
[1:32:52] they would go back and asked him said
[1:32:55] what do you think about this they
[1:32:57] consider you not not able to listen and
[1:33:00] hear and he said well I'm not the
[1:33:02] attraction to start off
[1:33:05] with they come to hear from
[1:33:10] Jesus aren't you thankful for that none
[1:33:13] of us are the attraction and I'm very
[1:33:16] much thankful for that because men and
[1:33:19] women will let us
[1:33:22] down when he preached it is said he
[1:33:26] preached under such an anointing until
[1:33:29] people would get under
[1:33:31] conviction five miles away and would
[1:33:34] drop their lunchboxes they called them
[1:33:37] pales at that time their lunch pales at
[1:33:40] that time and give their heart to Jesus
[1:33:43] Christ Amen brother Ron do you want a
[1:33:46] Ministry like that I would just love the
[1:33:48] ministry that the power and the presence
[1:33:51] of God would go to the back of the
[1:33:52] building
[1:33:53] [Applause]
[1:33:55] and every sinner that would come into
[1:33:57] the building would want to get this
[1:33:59] Jesus that's
[1:34:01] living that's my desire that you meet
[1:34:05] Jesus I'm not talking about intellectual
[1:34:08] ability or something that you could put
[1:34:10] everything together but I'm talking
[1:34:12] about a real
[1:34:14] Jesus that'll make you fall in love with
[1:34:17] him fall in love with one
[1:34:22] another can you can you say amen
[1:34:25] amen I have preached in the same
[1:34:28] building that the same this buddy
[1:34:31] Robinson preached in he
[1:34:34] preached he traveled 2,2 million miles
[1:34:39] for the cause of the
[1:34:41] Gospel he had 100,000
[1:34:44] converts and he preached
[1:34:47] 33,000
[1:34:49] sermons a man named Peter
[1:34:52] cartright that's mentioned in the
[1:34:53] greatest battle ever fought you remember
[1:34:56] the story when the town bully was there
[1:34:59] and he he asked the man said Can can I
[1:35:02] have a meeting here I'd like to run a
[1:35:03] Revival and Peter cart writes the
[1:35:07] response from the man said you'll have
[1:35:09] to whip me first and Peter cartright was
[1:35:11] cleaning the windows and he said well I
[1:35:13] guess I'll do that next and so he
[1:35:15] climbed down off of the ladder he beat
[1:35:18] the man to a pop
[1:35:23] do you know that man became a pastor of
[1:35:25] that
[1:35:27] church if you remember that there was an
[1:35:30] there was an Insurrection at the meeting
[1:35:32] and and about 30 men came to whip the
[1:35:35] preachers and all the other preachers
[1:35:38] stood back and Peter cartright whipped
[1:35:39] 30 of
[1:35:41] them he said I'll take one at a time and
[1:35:43] he whipped 30 of them listen God don't
[1:35:46] call Dy
[1:35:49] men panty waste preachers he's not
[1:35:52] looking for that kind of guy he's
[1:35:54] looking for lightning Thunderbolts and
[1:35:56] pull pits where men are men and they're
[1:35:59] filled with the power of
[1:36:01] [Applause]
[1:36:07] God I'd like to say this to you we're
[1:36:10] not pumped up Christians don't have to
[1:36:13] be pumped up all the
[1:36:15] time I've lost my
[1:36:18] notes but that's
[1:36:20] okay they don't have to be pumped up and
[1:36:22] patted up and baby around Christians are
[1:36:26] real I like real Christians I don't I
[1:36:30] don't care too much for Hollywood put
[1:36:32] on I like real Christians that are
[1:36:35] Christians when God they're when there's
[1:36:37] in a good time and they're Christians in
[1:36:39] the bad
[1:36:42] time there going to be bad times sure
[1:36:45] there's going to be bad
[1:36:46] times it's going to be difficult
[1:36:49] times I wrote this note and very
[1:36:52] personal to me and before we go any
[1:36:54] further because now I'm getting ready to
[1:36:56] preach to
[1:36:57] you and I I look at how things are are
[1:37:02] and I wrote this
[1:37:03] note where I'm standing at in
[1:37:08] 1986 brother Bisal preached this a
[1:37:10] sermon let us
[1:37:14] run in that service there was probably
[1:37:16] 1100 people sitting there in that
[1:37:19] service I felt the challenge to give my
[1:37:22] whole life life and my whole purpose to
[1:37:25] sering Jesus
[1:37:27] Christ and I've traveled around the
[1:37:30] world I've traveled many places in my
[1:37:32] life and I've seen phenomenal Miracles
[1:37:34] and I've seen incredible
[1:37:37] conversions I've seen things that that
[1:37:40] blesses my eyes and my thoughts
[1:37:43] walk dead raised I've seen cancers being
[1:37:45] delivered but the greatest of all that
[1:37:48] is when a man gets saved a woman gets
[1:37:51] saved and the life is trans transformed
[1:37:54] by the power of Jesus
[1:37:58] Christ as I was writing these notes for
[1:38:00] this sermon and I didn't write them just
[1:38:04] haphazardly and I wrote this that it
[1:38:07] might be a note even to my
[1:38:10] children if I am coming to my Finish
[1:38:14] Line I want to not finish as a coward am
[1:38:19] but I want to finish as a
[1:38:22] champion amen
[1:38:29] where did you draw that thought from
[1:38:31] well I I'll give it to
[1:38:33] you in 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 7
[1:38:37] he says it like
[1:38:39] this I have fought a good
[1:38:42] fight I have finished my course I have
[1:38:46] kept the faith and henceforth there is
[1:38:49] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[1:38:51] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:38:53] give me at that day and not to me
[1:38:56] only oh I love this part but unto all of
[1:39:01] them he don't just have it for the
[1:39:04] preachers how many of you fit in this
[1:39:06] next verse but into all of them that
[1:39:09] love his
[1:39:18] appearing woo I feel like my heart's

[1:42:43] head I wanted to look it up but they
[1:42:45] didn't give the calor over the gun of
[1:42:47] how fast that bullet was flying and God

[1:43:07] tragedy and you don't see it but there's
[1:43:09] angels of God that are watching over you

[1:46:41] gospel and so covid caused him to have
[1:46:44] to work from home and
[1:46:47] so in the last couple of years they
[1:46:49] wanted to force him to go back to the
[1:46:51] office but that was is going to inhibit
[1:46:54] him from going and preaching the gospel
[1:46:57] and
[1:46:58] traveling and so Elon
[1:47:01] Musk basil yeah even
[1:47:05] better who owns Amazon is that correct
[1:47:08] yeah yeah and so the guy that owns
[1:47:11] Amazon this guy works for

[1:47:35] bombs when I walked through the China
[1:47:38] security they said you have a class one
[1:47:41] uh clearance I said yes and she said you

[1:48:07] last night and the world thought they
[1:48:09] were going to force him back into an
[1:48:11] office and so God opened another door to
[1:48:13] where he can come to us and preach and
[1:48:15] to people all over the world and he can
[1:48:17] go and preach to them and still do a
[1:48:20] job give the Lord a great big hand right
[1:48:22] there
[1:48:34] I've come to a place here I I got a long
[1:48:36] way to go in my notes but I think I'll

[1:49:17] evening she said Pao tell me another one
[1:49:20] of them stories and so you know it's

[1:49:51] preacher you'll be there forever in
[1:49:54] their hard labor
[1:49:56] camps and so we were preaching for a
[1:49:59] brother and I'm not going to call his
[1:50:01] name because it may even cause him
[1:50:02] problems now because they actually do
[1:50:05] not have churches now they have to go
[1:50:07] from place to place to place to and they
[1:50:09] still do it have large churches that
[1:50:12] they travel from place to place to place
[1:50:13] to preach and so so anyway I was at the
[1:50:19] pastor's church and and so we're we're
[1:50:22] there and and even the police the chief
[1:50:25] of police comes in and takes
[1:50:28] pictures and he comes in and takes
[1:50:30] pictures you know and you can imagine as
[1:50:32] a preacher what that's doing to
[1:50:34] you and so so
[1:50:37] anyway I'm just watching him take
[1:50:40] pictures and let me just give you a
[1:50:42] little
[1:50:43] background this is not inside of a
[1:50:46] building it's a building surrounding a
[1:50:49] courtyard and so they're sitting in the
[1:50:52] cold
[1:50:54] and so when I sat in the cold and listen
[1:50:56] to brother Tom Ray preach I sat in a one
[1:51:00] of those fluff jackets and two blankets
[1:51:03] wrapped around me because it was that
[1:51:07] cold but nobody complained about how
[1:51:09] cold it was on the last night we had a
[1:51:12] prayer
[1:51:14] meeting prayer line i' preached about
[1:51:17] two hours to be honest with you not
[1:51:19] going to do that to you today
[1:51:22] and I had preached and the pastor's wife
[1:51:26] had a
[1:51:26] phobia what they call that clean phobia
[1:51:29] where everything has to be a certain way
[1:51:32] clean and has to be clean she couldn't
[1:51:34] have any company in her house no company
[1:51:37] in her house because she had to clean
[1:51:40] you know and she had to go behind you
[1:51:42] set your coffee when you could set your
[1:51:43] coffee cup down she'd clean behind you
[1:51:46] and you couldn't go to her
[1:51:50] bathroom well when brother Tom got off
[1:51:52] of the
[1:51:54] airplane he told her I'm going to come
[1:51:56] to your house to have tea it freaked her
[1:52:02] out no way was she going to let us
[1:52:05] preachers come to her house to have
[1:52:10] tea and we had had a prayer line and now
[1:52:12] in the prayer line it was Miracle after
[1:52:14] Miracle after Miracle she would be the
[1:52:17] last one in the prayer line the very
[1:52:21] last one
[1:52:23] and so I would pray for her I didn't
[1:52:26] know
[1:52:29] that but I called it out and said you
[1:52:33] have a you have a disease you have a
[1:52:35] phobia of
[1:52:37] dirt is it
[1:52:40] OCD you have a phobia of that and I
[1:52:43] called it out and I saw the angel of the
[1:52:47] Lord going to the building just
[1:52:50] going up to the building
[1:52:53] building now I'm going to drop a couple
[1:52:56] of just notes right
[1:52:58] here and it's going up through the
[1:53:00] building and so I told Tom and there's a
[1:53:03] lot of people left in the prayer line I
[1:53:05] said Tom we must go the Angels just left
[1:53:08] the
[1:53:10] building and there's a Chinese boy
[1:53:12] that's next in line he's this
[1:53:15] tall and his daddy standing beside they
[1:53:18] don't know any English and that little
[1:53:22] boy
[1:53:23] turns around to his daddy and says
[1:53:26] Daddy I just saw an angel go through the
[1:53:33] ceiling now that'll mean something in
[1:53:37] just a few moments this sister that's
[1:53:39] got this
[1:53:40] phobia it just
[1:53:43] leaves the next day she invites us as
[1:53:47] preachers to her
[1:53:48] place I don't know anything that's gone
[1:53:51] on I've done done forgot what's said in
[1:53:53] the prayer line and I looked at brother
[1:53:55] Tom and I said before we leave I got to
[1:53:58] go to the
[1:53:59] bathroom and brother Tom looks at
[1:54:02] her and he knows this is the
[1:54:10] ultimate and she says brother Ron you
[1:54:13] can go and brother Tom said well if he
[1:54:16] can go I can go
[1:54:25] amen
[1:54:27] hallelujah now the man that was in the
[1:54:31] prayer
[1:54:32] line and the little
[1:54:35] boy just only in a matter of
[1:54:38] weeks they have been given a
[1:54:41] handkerchief while we preach and we
[1:54:44] throw our napkin down they would run and
[1:54:46] grab the napkin and use it as a prayer
[1:54:49] cloth you cannot imagine how many
[1:54:53] miracles happened from us taking the
[1:54:55] napkins and wiping it and throwing it
[1:54:58] down and they would run and get
[1:55:00] it the boy's dying and the man grabs the
[1:55:04] napkin and lay it on the little boy and
[1:55:06] he comes back to life and doing
[1:55:08] extremely
[1:55:10] well give the Lord a great big hand
[1:55:26] I have just preached to
[1:55:28] you between 55 and 60
[1:55:32] minutes and I want to I want I want to
[1:55:35] just catch your attention just now when

[1:55:56] authority and you've got to be on the
[1:55:59] mark for whatever God wants to do in
[1:56:02] your life amen when Jesus turns to his
[1:56:05] disciples and said let not your heart be
[1:56:08] troubled you believe in God believe also
[1:56:10] in me in my father's house are many
[1:56:13] mansions if they were just in love with
[1:56:16] his personality none of these
[1:56:19] men will be murdered
[1:56:22] for his
[1:56:25] personality none of the people will be
[1:56:27] sa aund and bruised and and be destitute
[1:56:30] and Afflicted none of them for just his
[1:56:34] personality but because of the life of
[1:56:37] Jesus Christ that was placed on the
[1:56:39] inside of them it's greater than
[1:56:43] anything in this
[1:56:44] world it has the power to transform your
