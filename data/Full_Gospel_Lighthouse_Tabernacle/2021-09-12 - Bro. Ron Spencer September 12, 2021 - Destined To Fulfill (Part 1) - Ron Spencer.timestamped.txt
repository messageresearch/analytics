[40:49] as a blackness of night it closed off
[40:53] the line
[40:54] my heart sank with fear
[40:59] and my desperate cry
[41:02] it rang out with fright
[41:05] and all i could see
[41:07] was no hope inside
[41:10] with my faith all but gone

[45:27] would come and then maybe your sister
[45:29] katie spencer and brother andrew come
[45:30] after them god bless you
[45:43] um
[45:44] you guys bear with me i want to
[45:46] give a little bit of a testimony um
[45:50] since may 15th um
[45:54] ananias had a knot
[45:56] on her neck about the size um between a
[46:00] nickel and a quarter that stuck out
[46:02] about the size of a dime
[46:06] when we first took her to the doctor
[46:07] they said that it was infection in the
[46:10] lymph nodes
[46:12] but everything else looked okay because
[46:13] it hadn't gone anywhere else
[46:16] we started
[46:17] her first round of antibiotics the end
[46:19] of may
[46:22] so from the end of may until
[46:26] still she's on an
[46:28] antibiotic and they've had to increase
[46:30] it
[46:31] um
[46:32] we found out that she had a bacterial
[46:35] infection called atypical tuberculosis
[46:39] they said it was just as it could have
[46:41] been just as common to that she had a a
[46:44] tiny scratch and we didn't know about it
[46:46] that got infected
[46:49] so we're thankful that
[46:51] it was everything was able to take care
[46:53] of
[46:54] there's another little boy at her school
[46:56] that had the same thing
[46:58] and
[47:00] their parents just decided that they're
[47:02] just going to let it run its course and
[47:04] do its own thing and
[47:06] um
[47:07] his busted and it's not so pretty um the
[47:10] doctor was we opted for surgery to try
[47:13] to get off the antibiotics so when he
[47:15] went in it was um
[47:18] it's super close to one of her nerves in
[47:20] her face and so
[47:23] he put a monitor on her mouth so that if
[47:26] he would get close to a nerve that it
[47:27] would go off and then he would stop
[47:30] so while she was in surgery and he was
[47:33] able to go in and remove most of the
[47:35] infection he saw that it had actually
[47:37] spread over to her saliva gland
[47:40] he wasn't able to get all of that off
[47:42] because of the
[47:44] angle that he had entered
[47:46] due to the nerve
[47:47] so we still have to continue on an
[47:49] antibiotic
[47:51] but we've got almost everything out
[47:54] [Music]
[47:56] he did not have to cut any of her skin
[47:58] away
[48:00] he was able to glue it back
[48:03] and we had prayed that she wouldn't have
[48:05] a scar
[48:08] and so
[48:09] with him being able to glue it back
[48:13] she only has one little spot that she
[48:14] may have a scar on
[48:16] because of the way that he was able to
[48:18] do it the color has gone back to flesh
[48:22] color and it's no longer pink and purple
[48:27] and while we were there
[48:30] we had to stay overnight because he did
[48:32] have to put a tube in to let the rest
[48:35] try to drain out
[48:36] and
[48:38] we had to share a room with a complete
[48:39] stranger
[48:40] it was really uncomfortable because the
[48:42] person that was staying there was a man
[48:44] and we could only have one
[48:46] person to stay with her
[48:48] and the lord moved that we were able to
[48:51] go get a private room
[48:53] so that we didn't have to share a room
[48:55] with somebody that was we didn't know or
[48:57] what would what would happen
[48:59] i know it sounds small but it was it was
[49:02] such a blessing to us
[49:04] and we're just thankful for all the
[49:05] prayers and the
[49:07] and the love and the cards and
[49:08] everything that you guys have shown to
[49:10] her
[49:12] and we're just so thankful and if you
[49:13] could just continue to pray that this
[49:15] round of antibiotics would
[49:17] just kill it usually they said that
[49:21] we had to see the the doctor above the
[49:23] ent and they said that
[49:27] without surgery this super strong
[49:29] medicine would be about a six month
[49:32] treatment
[49:34] since we opted for surgery
[49:36] the best case scenario is about a four
[49:38] to six weeks
[49:40] span and so we're just thanking the lord
[49:43] for that because
[49:44] they'll have if something if she has any
[49:46] of these side effects then they'll have
[49:47] to get her blood tested
[49:49] but since we opted for the surgery in
[49:51] such a short short treatment that
[49:54] we will probably not see she wouldn't
[49:56] have any side effects more than likely
[49:58] and so we're just so thankful for that
[50:00] and just continue to pray for her
[50:07] [Applause]
[50:13] when he walks among
[50:16] us
[50:17] and all that he does
[50:21] all of his mercy
[50:24] and all of his love
[50:28] if the pin of the rider
[50:32] could ride every day

[1:11:37] amen if you'll turn with me in your
[1:11:39] scriptures this morning
[1:11:40] i'd like to speak to you
[1:11:43] on destin
[1:11:45] to fulfill
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:51] you remember last week and
[1:11:55] that i i
[1:11:56] i spoke to you about
[1:11:59] when jesus was saying there's some of
[1:12:01] you standing here
[1:12:04] you're going to see some phenomenal
[1:12:05] things you're going to see the kingdom
[1:12:06] come
[1:12:07] amen
[1:12:08] and i believe we can stand here and say
[1:12:12] some of you standing here
[1:12:16] you're going to see your loved ones walk
[1:12:17] down the aisle
[1:12:20] you're talking about a special sunday
[1:12:22] morning
[1:12:24] and we're going to be here together
[1:12:26] fellowshipping about 40 days
[1:12:30] i thought about a sister autumn was
[1:12:31] testifying
[1:12:33] what kind of services we're going to
[1:12:34] have when homer testifies to us
[1:12:40] brother wayne plays a guitar
[1:12:43] and we realize now the world they won't
[1:12:46] believe it no way
[1:12:49] you can tell the people on your job well
[1:12:51] this is happening at our church they're
[1:12:54] not going to believe it no way
[1:12:56] so about 40 days we're going to
[1:12:57] fellowship together knowing we're going
[1:13:00] to see the lord in the air
[1:13:05] this is not a fairy tale
[1:13:07] this isn't something a prophet said
[1:13:10] this is what jesus said
[1:13:13] and so we are here
[1:13:16] destined
[1:13:17] to fulfill
[1:13:20] the rapture's going to happen
[1:13:22] the resurrection is going to happen
[1:13:25] the end of the world is here
[1:13:27] we're watching it take place everything
[1:13:29] is going to fulfill the plan of god
[1:13:32] i'm just really thrilled i'm in it
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:37] i'm really thrilled
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:43] andrew used a couple of these texts last
[1:13:45] night and
[1:13:46] of course we don't compare on where
[1:13:49] we're going or what we even talk about
[1:13:51] as far as preaching so we just follow
[1:13:53] the mind of the lord but always like it
[1:13:56] how it happens
[1:13:58] matthew chapter 16 and verse 13.
[1:14:01] and when jesus came to the coast of
[1:14:03] caesarea philippi
[1:14:05] he asked his disciples saying
[1:14:09] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[1:14:14] and they said
[1:14:15] some say thou art john the baptist
[1:14:19] some elias
[1:14:21] another jeremias
[1:14:23] or one of the prophets
[1:14:25] and he saith unto them but
[1:14:28] whom say ye
[1:14:30] that i am
[1:14:32] and simon peter answered and said thou
[1:14:35] art the christ
[1:14:36] the son of the living god
[1:14:39] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:14:42] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[1:14:45] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[1:14:47] but my father which is in heaven
[1:14:50] and i say also unto thee that thou art
[1:14:54] peter upon this rock i will build my
[1:14:56] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:14:59] prevail against it
[1:15:01] and i give unto thee the keys of the
[1:15:03] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[1:15:07] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:15:09] heaven
[1:15:10] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:15:13] shall be loosed
[1:15:15] in heaven
[1:15:16] amen maybe you have a need this morning

[1:15:19] the lord and
[1:15:21] god knows our hearts
[1:15:23] almighty god we love you with all of our
[1:15:26] hearts today
[1:15:28] we ask you to forgive us of our sins
[1:15:31] our mistakes
[1:15:34] failures of our humanity
[1:15:36] the thoughts that we have thought out of
[1:15:38] place
[1:15:39] words that we have may have said
[1:15:42] tempted to push in certain directions
[1:15:46] attitudes
[1:15:47] anything that would be wrong father
[1:15:50] but lord my heart's desire today is to
[1:15:52] have more of you living in my life
[1:15:55] and lord as we speak the words of
[1:15:57] eternal life i'm excited about what is
[1:16:00] coming forth today i ask you to anoint
[1:16:03] this audience i pray that you had
[1:16:05] blessed them in a mighty way and may it
[1:16:07] become very personal to them that your
[1:16:10] word is talking about us as living
[1:16:13] epistles today strengthen us bless the
[1:16:16] service
[1:16:17] touch every heart and every need in
[1:16:19] jesus christ's name we pray
[1:16:21] amen and amen you may be seated
[1:16:26] andrew was coming toward the end of his
[1:16:28] text last night and he read these
[1:16:30] scriptures
[1:16:31] in matthew chapters 5 and verse 3.
[1:16:34] remember who is saying these words
[1:16:38] god himself
[1:16:41] in the form of jesus christ
[1:16:46] now he's speaking to us in our humanity
[1:16:50] blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:16:53] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:16:56] blessed are they that mourn
[1:16:58] for they shall be comforted
[1:17:00] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:17:03] inherit the earth
[1:17:05] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:17:07] thirst after righteousness
[1:17:09] for they shall be filled
[1:17:12] blessed are the merciful
[1:17:14] for they
[1:17:15] shall obtain mercy
[1:17:18] blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:17:20] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:17:22] shall be filled i want you to just
[1:17:24] notice there's a blessing and there's a
[1:17:26] result for it
[1:17:30] blessed are the pure in heart
[1:17:32] for they shall see god
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:37] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:17:40] shall be called the children of god
[1:17:44] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:17:46] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:17:49] kingdom of heaven i like those results
[1:17:55] blessed are they
[1:17:57] when men shall revile you
[1:18:00] and persecute you
[1:18:02] and say all manner of evil against you
[1:18:05] falsely for my sake
[1:18:07] now watch the response of this
[1:18:10] rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:18:13] for great is your reward in heaven for
[1:18:15] so they persecuted they the prophets
[1:18:18] which were before you
[1:18:20] now notice now he's laid all this
[1:18:22] foundational truth out
[1:18:24] year the salt of the earth
[1:18:30] but if the salt hath lost its savior
[1:18:33] wherewith shall it be salted it stents
[1:18:35] forth good for nothing but to be cast
[1:18:38] out and under the trot trodden under the
[1:18:40] foot of men
[1:18:42] ye are the light of the world
[1:18:45] a city
[1:18:47] that is set on a hill
[1:18:49] and cannot be hit
[1:18:52] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:18:55] under a bushel but on a candlestick and
[1:18:57] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[1:19:00] house
[1:19:02] let your light
[1:19:05] so shine before men that they may see
[1:19:08] your good works and glorify the father
[1:19:11] which is in heaven
[1:19:13] amen and a man and a man and a man
[1:19:17] i know it's just just just for a few
[1:19:18] moments just lay out a few principles if
[1:19:20] you can just help me just just over the
[1:19:23] next little bit
[1:19:25] we know our god is an alpha and omega
[1:19:27] god
[1:19:29] he is the beginning and the end
[1:19:32] he is the first and the last
[1:19:35] it is more than a saying
[1:19:39] it is more than a saiyan the same god of
[1:19:42] the 1400s
[1:19:46] or the 1200s or the 800s or the 200s
[1:19:50] it's the god that's in control today
[1:19:56] are you with me he's not off on a
[1:19:58] journey somewhere another
[1:20:00] he is here to usher to fulfill
[1:20:06] this rapture
[1:20:08] to happen and let me just say he's not
[1:20:11] rapturing trees
[1:20:15] he's not rapturing boats
[1:20:18] cars
[1:20:20] building sanctuaries he's rapturing
[1:20:23] individuals
[1:20:26] that have the life that reflected inside
[1:20:30] of them as it is in him
[1:20:33] the same life the matching life
[1:20:37] and this life is not about 80 year olds
[1:20:43] it's about children
[1:20:45] where children can have the same life i
[1:20:49] remember as a child how god would deal
[1:20:51] with me as a child god's going to
[1:20:54] rapture children
[1:20:56] because every generation must have its
[1:21:00] own revival
[1:21:02] are you with me it's not about just the
[1:21:04] revivals past but it's about your own
[1:21:07] personal revival
[1:21:10] that will continue until the rapture
[1:21:15] when will we stop having problems the
[1:21:17] day of the rapture
[1:21:20] when will we stop having hard decisions
[1:21:23] the day of the rapture
[1:21:25] when will difficulties quit taking place
[1:21:27] to us the day of the rapture god will
[1:21:30] move you from this realm to that realm
[1:21:34] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:21:37] but while we are here we have a job to
[1:21:39] do we have a mandate we are commissioned
[1:21:43] to live this life
[1:21:46] more than pictures more than tapes
[1:21:49] more than knowing the the ins and outs
[1:21:51] of the doctrines more than being able to
[1:21:54] quote your bible all the way through
[1:21:56] many men can do that but can't make it
[1:21:59] live
[1:22:00] a lot of people have recipes of how it's
[1:22:02] supposed to happen
[1:22:05] are you with me but every one of us have
[1:22:08] a different revival in our lives
[1:22:12] and that fire you might try to explain
[1:22:15] it to somebody else but you can't
[1:22:17] explain a supernatural experience
[1:22:21] because god gives it to you
[1:22:24] individually
[1:22:28] so what we're doing here is we're
[1:22:30] reflecting
[1:22:31] where we're going
[1:22:36] to maybe you would go to busch gardens
[1:22:40] or to disney world
[1:22:43] and there was groups of people coming
[1:22:44] from everywhere
[1:22:46] and and you can kind of see what the
[1:22:49] world is like
[1:22:51] and you're standing there in your proper
[1:22:54] attire your proper dress
[1:22:56] your atmosphere don't change
[1:23:01] it don't change just because you're
[1:23:03] there and all of them around you your
[1:23:05] atmosphere don't change
[1:23:08] riding the same rides eating sometimes
[1:23:11] the same food not necessarily drinking
[1:23:13] the same drink but because you're headed
[1:23:16] to different worlds
[1:23:19] so many times we let that world vex us
[1:23:22] so much it'll aggravate our attitudes
[1:23:26] but remember keep your eyes on jesus
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:31] this is not our home
[1:23:33] we're citizens of the united states or
[1:23:35] whatever nation that you're listening to
[1:23:37] it from your citizen and it's only
[1:23:39] temporary
[1:23:43] are you with me it's only temporary
[1:23:46] abraham was in search of a city whose
[1:23:48] builder and maker was god
[1:23:51] there's a reason that he continued that
[1:23:53] search is because he met the king
[1:23:57] and when you meet the king
[1:23:59] and that king changed his life
[1:24:03] can you imagine just for a moment
[1:24:07] living beside of abraham
[1:24:10] and his body changes
[1:24:16] i want you to just grasp this just
[1:24:18] somebody did
[1:24:22] somebody did
[1:24:24] i want to take that a little bit further
[1:24:26] somebody will
[1:24:31] i live on pine creek lane there are
[1:24:33] going to be witnesses
[1:24:36] the ups truck don't come there no longer
[1:24:39] the fedex truck don't come there no
[1:24:40] longer the mail people they're not
[1:24:43] picking up their mail
[1:24:45] they're going to witness that what we
[1:24:47] have preached about for these decades
[1:24:50] has happened
[1:25:01] you see god is producing kind after kind
[1:25:05] horses produce horses
[1:25:08] cows produce cows
[1:25:10] god produces god
[1:25:12] messiahs on the earth
[1:25:15] written epistles
[1:25:17] read and known of all men
[1:25:21] not just to live in a to a tent but to
[1:25:24] work in banks to work in hospitals
[1:25:27] to be chimney sweeps to work on your job
[1:25:31] it doesn't change your attitude or the
[1:25:33] way you conduct your business you're a
[1:25:36] christian on monday just like you're on
[1:25:38] sunday
[1:25:41] it isn't a put on anything make yourself
[1:25:43] do it it's just like breathing
[1:25:48] let me just say this if you're having
[1:25:50] difficulty living the christian life you
[1:25:53] need the holy ghost
[1:25:55] and let me just say it's for you
[1:25:58] ask continue to ask continue to wait
[1:26:01] continue to ask him refill my life
[1:26:05] fill me so much take the cares of the
[1:26:08] world the love of the world out of me
[1:26:10] just take those things that are not like
[1:26:12] jesus out of my life
[1:26:15] let me be so filled until i'm no
[1:26:20] i i just want to go home
[1:26:28] come to the place in your life that the
[1:26:30] comfort level of this world
[1:26:34] i want to go home so much
[1:26:48] i want to say this to you i want to say
[1:26:50] this to you very very as a pastor i want
[1:26:53] to say to be very clear
[1:26:55] your future is clear
[1:27:03] i want every individual in this building
[1:27:04] to think i
[1:27:06] i know i'm i'm on a different gear this
[1:27:08] morning but i want to talk to you as a
[1:27:11] father to a child or as a pastor to your
[1:27:13] sheep
[1:27:15] you'll fix your your future is clear
[1:27:24] carly you just got married the other day
[1:27:28] you stepped into a new lifestyle
[1:27:31] now you and adam
[1:27:33] serve the lord
[1:27:35] god's got big plans
[1:27:42] he's got big plans
[1:27:44] and you begin to realize that god has
[1:27:47] got a hold of this
[1:27:49] and he's making a way
[1:27:51] and sometimes you think the needs that
[1:27:53] you have in your life
[1:27:55] and sometimes so many times the world
[1:27:58] drives needs drives advertising and
[1:28:02] god's got everything in control
[1:28:11] while you were being formed in the womb
[1:28:13] god took care of it
[1:28:17] while you've worked through life he's
[1:28:19] opened doors in closed doors
[1:28:25] what he's done for you is open the door
[1:28:30] and sometimes in the opening of the door
[1:28:32] you got to leave somewhere
[1:28:34] i remember billy graham said the
[1:28:35] scripture said
[1:28:37] go into all the world and he said i
[1:28:40] realized to go i had to leave somewhere
[1:28:44] i thought that was a profound statement
[1:28:47] that was incredible statement as a
[1:28:49] messenger to sodom
[1:28:52] he had to go around the world just like
[1:28:54] our prophet did go around the world and
[1:28:56] he did a good job
[1:28:59] don't no never put him down he did a
[1:29:02] phenomenal job
[1:29:04] of what he did
[1:29:06] he was a tremendous man
[1:29:10] but remember this just as much as billy
[1:29:12] graham had a job to do you got a job to
[1:29:15] do
[1:29:17] who is the most important person of this
[1:29:19] church
[1:29:20] jesus is
[1:29:23] then jesus wants to live in every
[1:29:25] individual in this church
[1:29:28] not just the pastor
[1:29:33] not just the men not just the women
[1:29:37] not just the young people of this church
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:43] are you with me maybe you say well
[1:29:44] brother ron i've got old now and i just
[1:29:47] i just can't i don't move like i used to
[1:29:49] move but you pray like you've never
[1:29:51] prayed before
[1:29:53] you shake the kingdom of hell
[1:29:58] because you've got decades of experience
[1:30:00] behind you and with that experience and
[1:30:03] walk with god god has brought you
[1:30:05] through memorial after memorial after
[1:30:08] memorial but the job's not done yet you
[1:30:11] are destined to fulfill
[1:30:14] the word of god
[1:30:22] oh hallelujah
[1:30:25] now god knows what he's laid inside of
[1:30:27] you
[1:30:28] because he is the one that placed the
[1:30:31] potential
[1:30:34] of what you are to be
[1:30:37] and that potential is not temporary
[1:30:43] it's not a swiss watch
[1:30:48] even swiss watches go fast
[1:30:52] but let me just say this to you
[1:30:56] god's watching over the eternal part
[1:31:05] jesus was god made flesh
[1:31:09] but yet being god made flesh
[1:31:12] so many people didn't see it
[1:31:16] you are the word made flesh
[1:31:21] is this microphone working
[1:31:23] you are the word made flesh
[1:31:26] [Applause]
[1:31:28] you're the bible you're the message of
[1:31:30] the hour
[1:31:31] and maybe your friends will never read
[1:31:34] sermons like things that are to be
[1:31:37] where a prophet stands in this dimension
[1:31:40] and he stands there and he actually
[1:31:42] describes the vision of god
[1:31:45] for the bride of jesus christ and he
[1:31:48] says notice how those words are things
[1:31:51] that are to be
[1:31:54] not things that are maybe to be but it's
[1:31:57] a sure thing
[1:31:59] i love the book of revelations these are
[1:32:01] the true saiyans of god
[1:32:04] and let me just say god's never lied
[1:32:10] he's never lied
[1:32:17] let me let me just say this to you many
[1:32:20] times you watch me and i'm not just
[1:32:22] doing it just to
[1:32:24] show off my grandson or show off your
[1:32:25] children or show off miracles
[1:32:29] because there was a time before the
[1:32:31] miracle happened
[1:32:32] we were looking to the miracle
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:37] when david was crushed we were still
[1:32:39] looking to the miracle
[1:32:41] when whitney's womb could not bring
[1:32:43] forth we were still looking to the
[1:32:44] miracle but now there are two babies
[1:32:47] here we remind ourselves that it was god
[1:32:57] hallelujah
[1:33:00] brother ray was standing in the back of
[1:33:02] the building one day and he said the
[1:33:03] only pain that i want for for dressing
[1:33:06] the church up is is for autumn to get a
[1:33:08] real good husband she did
[1:33:11] there was a time we were looking to the
[1:33:12] miracle are you listening to me
[1:33:14] there was a time we were looking to the
[1:33:16] miracle
[1:33:18] ooh he's here
[1:33:20] there was a time we were looking to it
[1:33:22] but the miracle walked into our place
[1:33:32] and the miracle stood there and adonai
[1:33:34] has conceived and was a miracle in
[1:33:36] itself
[1:33:39] the same angel is visiting your house
[1:33:42] you can't stop the plan of god
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:53] jesus said i am the resurrection in life
[1:33:57] and he proved it
[1:34:00] i am the bread of life
[1:34:02] and he proved it
[1:34:06] i and my father
[1:34:07] are one
[1:34:09] and he proved it
[1:34:12] when he said i have finished the work in
[1:34:14] john chapter 17. he proved it
[1:34:19] when he told the woman go and sin no
[1:34:23] more i'm sure people were sitting there
[1:34:25] going yeah sure sure that's going to
[1:34:27] happen she was a harlot just last night
[1:34:30] but listen she met the man
[1:34:34] that wasn't a quick fix to her life she
[1:34:38] met the man that could change oh i feel
[1:34:41] like
[1:34:42] she fit the man that changed her life in
[1:34:45] a moment
[1:34:58] so we're not coming to a spot and then
[1:35:00] going back
[1:35:03] oh help me now we're not coming to a
[1:35:05] spot brother nathaniel and then running
[1:35:07] back
[1:35:08] we're not coming to a spot brother
[1:35:10] shannon and going back
[1:35:15] the horse was fine
[1:35:17] the chariot was fine
[1:35:20] the model t car was fine
[1:35:24] those old cars were fine
[1:35:27] but then come an airplane
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:33] hallelujah and then come the astronaut
[1:35:35] age
[1:35:37] there was a day that luther was fine
[1:35:40] and wesley was fine and pentecost was
[1:35:43] fine but god wasn't done unfolding his
[1:35:46] word
[1:35:48] there was people
[1:35:50] that were overcomers in every one of
[1:35:52] those revivals
[1:35:54] but god said i'm going to open the book
[1:35:56] and i'm going to have a people of the
[1:35:58] open book
[1:36:00] that'll take this word
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:19] brother edmund wade was sitting in the
[1:36:21] building
[1:36:23] brother brown just starts talking about
[1:36:24] him a little bit
[1:36:26] but brother edmund
[1:36:28] had a complex
[1:36:30] the complex caused him
[1:36:32] to fall dead
[1:36:35] if you'll notice brother branham didn't
[1:36:36] get excited
[1:36:38] listen to it
[1:36:40] he didn't get excited he got to calm the
[1:36:42] people
[1:36:44] because
[1:36:45] he had a future
[1:36:50] and he simply went over called him by
[1:36:52] his name and he come back to life
[1:36:56] there was a woman actually felt dead in
[1:36:58] the
[1:36:59] actually she was well but she fell dead
[1:37:02] in one of the meetings
[1:37:04] and brother branham was preaching
[1:37:07] and there's a commotion
[1:37:09] this woman's dead
[1:37:13] because she had a future
[1:37:16] follow me now
[1:37:18] he turned to billy paul

[1:37:32] says i was scared dead
[1:37:34] and he said
[1:37:36] no no daddy
[1:37:38] he said no pleb no daddy
[1:37:40] brother graham stepped out from the side
[1:37:42] of the platform and he
[1:37:43] and he called he said he didn't know her
[1:37:46] he said mary
[1:37:50] dead

[1:37:56] yes brother brown
[1:38:01] well i don't know if i believe that or
[1:38:02] not

[1:38:23] future

[1:38:28] a future
[1:38:29] randall you have a future
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:46] now let me just let me just say
[1:38:48] two years brother random had that vision
[1:38:49] of that little finland boy
[1:38:53] it was in the fly leaf of thousands of
[1:38:55] bibles
[1:38:56] even brother branham's
[1:38:58] but brother have you heard what the
[1:39:00] critic said i could care less
[1:39:03] that little boy had a future
[1:39:10] as a matter of fact from that event
[1:39:13] brother branham's next stop
[1:39:15] was in finland and he was speaking and
[1:39:18] brother branham walks out into the
[1:39:21] building
[1:39:23] before he ever gets to the pulpit there
[1:39:26] were 12 rows of cots in wheelchairs
[1:39:30] 12 rows just get this
[1:39:32] 12 rows we just mentioned a couple of
[1:39:35] miracles and we get excited 12 rows of
[1:39:38] wheelchairs and cots and brother branham
[1:39:40] comes through the side door and he's not
[1:39:42] said a word yet and all of them get up
[1:39:49] don't you worry about the rapture
[1:39:52] don't you worry about the resurrection
[1:39:54] it will be right on time
[1:39:57] and all of them will get up
[1:40:01] they went down with anticipation
[1:40:04] with faith
[1:40:06] and they breathe their last breath
[1:40:09] listen their future was clear
[1:40:13] and they'll get up
[1:40:26] boy that's good isn't it
[1:40:32] you know the older i get the more gray i
[1:40:34] get
[1:40:42] my arms are becoming more white my legs
[1:40:44] are totally white
[1:40:48] ghost white
[1:40:51] because the cancer is affecting the
[1:40:53] pigments
[1:40:54] in my skin
[1:40:56] and
[1:40:58] they said that was the kind of thing
[1:40:59] that michael jackson had
[1:41:02] i don't want to go where michael jackson
[1:41:04] went
[1:41:13] now i want to just say these things real
[1:41:19] it was a it would be a waste of my time
[1:41:22] sister heather you do my hair
[1:41:25] it would be a waste of my time to figure
[1:41:28] how it's going to turn red again
[1:41:36] or how that i'm going to go from a 38
[1:41:38] waist
[1:41:40] to a 30.
[1:41:48] now i could set go to school i could do
[1:41:50] a lot of things but i can't make that
[1:41:52] happen
[1:41:55] but abraham was believing what
[1:41:57] melchizedek
[1:41:58] said and he knew when melchizedek said
[1:42:02] is there anything too hard for the lord
[1:42:04] that god was not going to only heal his
[1:42:06] body but was going to heal sarah's body
[1:42:12] so
[1:42:13] if i'm in a situation
[1:42:18] i'm just keep coming to it so i just
[1:42:20] might as well say it
[1:42:22] i might as well if i'm in a
[1:42:26] situation like anna
[1:42:29] they said well they've seen a vision
[1:42:32] and i've been wanting a baby
[1:42:34] but i can't make myself have one
[1:42:40] i can't make myself do it
[1:42:42] there's going to come a rapture i can't
[1:42:44] put myself in the rapture
[1:42:49] but if we remember what mary said
[1:42:52] be it unto me
[1:42:53] according to thy word
[1:42:56] or like hattie wright said
[1:42:59] that's
[1:43:00] absolutely the truth
[1:43:02] brother branham
[1:43:05] the before she had rebellious boys the
[1:43:07] afterwards she had two eternal sons
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:12] [Applause]
[1:43:16] hallelujah
[1:43:20] in luke 22
[1:43:23] verse 31 and the lord said to simon
[1:43:27] simon
[1:43:29] behold satan
[1:43:31] had desired to have you
[1:43:35] i want to say that to you this is an
[1:43:37] audience
[1:43:38] he has an absolute desire
[1:43:42] to destroy your life
[1:43:45] and
[1:43:46] he would do it in a moment's notice
[1:43:50] if god didn't have your future in his
[1:43:53] hands
[1:44:05] hallelujah
[1:44:07] hallelujah
[1:44:11] but notice these next words but i have
[1:44:14] prayed for thee
[1:44:16] who better than to have god
[1:44:19] saying i'm concerned about my son
[1:44:22] satan's wanting to destroy him but i
[1:44:25] have interceded
[1:44:29] and he has a future
[1:44:40] hallelujah
[1:44:43] watch this quote satan tried every
[1:44:45] scheme to try to make him discredit this
[1:44:49] satan tried everything that he could to
[1:44:51] make him discredited
[1:44:54] he tried to make him to take the kingdom
[1:44:56] without suffering
[1:44:59] he tried to get him to take it without
[1:45:02] redemption
[1:45:04] this is jesus
[1:45:06] satan was trying to discredit him
[1:45:09] he'll try to discredit you
[1:45:13] let me just pause here just for a moment
[1:45:16] listen
[1:45:17] taking down these statues
[1:45:21] they're trying to get rid of the history
[1:45:24] whether you like it or not it's still
[1:45:26] the history you can take down all the
[1:45:28] statues you want to it's still the
[1:45:30] history
[1:45:33] and if you want to give them to somebody
[1:45:35] i'll take
[1:45:37] robert e lee
[1:45:39] i'll take him on his horse
[1:45:41] where are you going to put it i might
[1:45:42] even put him down here at the bottom of
[1:45:44] this church
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:46:04] listen i don't i don't say anything
[1:46:06] without meaning it
[1:46:08] because we have put a bid in on that
[1:46:10] statue
[1:46:12] i don't think we'll get it
[1:46:15] [Laughter]
[1:46:17] i don't think we'll get it there ain't
[1:46:19] no little horse that i bought this week
[1:46:26] but they tried to discredit brother
[1:46:28] branham
[1:46:30] they did that with luther they did that
[1:46:32] with wesley
[1:46:35] they did that with pentecost
[1:46:38] they did that with brother branham
[1:46:40] but notice they didn't do too much of it
[1:46:42] until he died
[1:46:49] then they want to change the bible
[1:46:51] go from a king james version to whatever
[1:46:53] version that they want
[1:46:58] go to a church where you want to live
[1:46:59] any kind of life you want to it shows
[1:47:02] that they have no future
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:09] let me just say when you come to the
[1:47:10] bottom of a the bottom end of a wine jug
[1:47:15] there's no future in that
[1:47:18] your children are watching drinking beer
[1:47:20] and smoking and looking at all kind of
[1:47:23] pornography and fighting in the home all
[1:47:25] the time
[1:47:26] there's no future in that
[1:47:28] but there is a future in serving jesus
[1:47:31] christ where there's peace and there's
[1:47:34] joy and there's life
[1:47:48] i want to remind you there's no miracles
[1:47:49] without a mess
[1:47:54] we want to see miracles well first of
[1:47:56] all you got to have some messes
[1:47:59] and i i'd say there's probably
[1:48:02] 250 messes here
[1:48:08] for those on the internet we do not have
[1:48:10] a wing room
[1:48:12] where we hang our wings up
[1:48:21] [Laughter]
[1:48:25] we we are real people here
[1:48:32] this ain't a church where you want to
[1:48:33] slap somebody
[1:48:36] we still need more jesus
[1:48:43] you know what i mean
[1:48:45] you know what i mean
[1:48:47] we
[1:48:49] were masses
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] don't get offended at that statement
[1:48:58] somebody asked me
[1:48:59] one time said
[1:49:01] how many guns is probably sitting in
[1:49:02] this church probably i just i just
[1:49:04] simply answered probably as many guns
[1:49:06] years as is bibles
[1:49:14] live in some liberal nation where you
[1:49:16] can't carry a gun move to america will
[1:49:18] you
[1:49:19] we'll take you
[1:49:20] you live in a debt you're at a dead
[1:49:22] church move here we're alive man we got
[1:49:25] life we enjoy serving the god
[1:49:36] i don't know if i can get a job there
[1:49:37] mcdonald's has got signs everywhere
[1:49:40] there are signs on every industry there
[1:49:42] are signs on every place don't you the
[1:49:45] reason you don't get a job here you just
[1:50:02] lord lord help me here i am
[1:50:12] isaac
[1:50:13] would have picked esau
[1:50:16] but god allowed him to be blind
[1:50:21] so he put him in a mess
[1:50:24] to fulfill the word of the lord
[1:50:28] listen jacob was destined
[1:50:31] to be the father of 12 tribes
[1:50:36] it was not esau that was to be the
[1:50:39] father of all of those it was jacob even
[1:50:42] in the womb
[1:50:44] god said i love jacob and i hate esau
[1:50:49] listen don't argue with god when he
[1:50:51] picked you he loved you
[1:50:55] god ain't mad at you and he ain't gonna
[1:50:57] beat you around the block he loved you
[1:51:00] he's loved you for centuries decades
[1:51:03] eternity
[1:51:06] [Applause]
[1:51:10] the memphis girl that was talked about
[1:51:12] last night
[1:51:13] already in my notes
[1:51:15] had to be blind that we could hear about
[1:51:18] her today
[1:51:20] the blind man in bombay india
[1:51:25] had to be blind and he's staggered in
[1:51:27] the and we roll these stories like
[1:51:29] shadrach meshach and abednego and
[1:51:32] daniel in a lion's den they were put in
[1:51:35] some real messes in their life
[1:51:39] but they were destined to fulfill
[1:51:47] what about a mexican baby
[1:51:51] that's been dead
[1:51:53] and the doctors tell her to go bury her
[1:51:55] dead
[1:51:56] and something's in her heart to get her
[1:51:59] her baby to that man that was praying
[1:52:01] for the sick last night
[1:52:03] and she don't stop at the first usher
[1:52:05] but she fights her way through every
[1:52:07] usher and finally comes before brother
[1:52:09] branham and then brother has another man
[1:52:12] to go pray for and in that action it
[1:52:14] calls division
[1:52:18] if you remember brother said i can't
[1:52:19] make myself have a vision
[1:52:21] no more than you can make yourself dream
[1:52:23] a dream
[1:52:26] but her faith caused a vision
[1:52:30] because that baby had a future
[1:52:36] are you with me now
[1:52:40] congressman upshaw had said in a lot of
[1:52:42] meetings being a real christian
[1:52:46] but today
[1:52:49] let's just do let's do it like this
[1:52:51] congressman nutshall being a christian
[1:52:55] his testimony was not effective
[1:52:58] as much as it could be
[1:53:01] if he was out of a wheelchair
[1:53:08] so he said in a meeting
[1:53:11] and it was a vision and he realized it
[1:53:13] was him
[1:53:14] and from that event
[1:53:16] he no longer needed a wheelchair or a
[1:53:18] walker
[1:53:19] but he began to walk
[1:53:21] and he stood
[1:53:23] on the on the on the steps of washington
[1:53:26] and told them what a miracle that was
[1:53:28] there
[1:53:29] and a prophet was in the land
[1:53:32] amen
[1:53:34] but he was in a mess
[1:53:39] for decades
[1:53:42] i'm driving something now your life may
[1:53:45] be a mess
[1:53:49] you may feel like you're surrounded by
[1:53:52] idiots
[1:53:55] i'm coming to your house
[1:53:59] your children
[1:54:00] may every one of them be unbelievers but
[1:54:03] there's something in your heart that's
[1:54:04] driving you
[1:54:07] it is because you're destined to fulfill
[1:54:11] something way higher than yourself
[1:54:28] now remember in a mess
[1:54:30] it's god's divine plan
[1:54:33] happening in your life
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:40] sometimes he has to force us into the
[1:54:42] will of god
[1:54:46] stephen i find that absolutely amazing
[1:54:48] he has to force us into the will of god
[1:54:51] well brother i'm going to do a
[1:54:52] scriptural i'm going to need a
[1:54:53] scriptural
[1:54:55] okay
[1:54:56] joseph did not want to go
[1:54:59] to bethlehem to pay taxes
[1:55:03] because that's where that's where the
[1:55:05] scripture said he was going to be born
[1:55:07] at
[1:55:09] and so he wasn't just going to look at
[1:55:11] the scripture say well he's going to be
[1:55:12] born in bethlehem he couldn't put it all
[1:55:15] together
[1:55:17] he could not put the plan of god
[1:55:19] together hey i gotta move
[1:55:22] listen that would have been easy hey i
[1:55:24] gotta move but god got behind him
[1:55:28] and he caused governments to force him
[1:55:33] to go to the place of where he was born
[1:55:36] at to pay taxes
[1:55:39] don't mail him in move
[1:55:43] so he took his nine month pregnant wife
[1:55:46] and put her on a donkey
[1:55:50] and you hear brother branham talk about
[1:55:52] he talks so bad about that murderous
[1:55:56] king
[1:55:58] that was forcing him to pay taxes
[1:56:00] you're not the only ones fussed about
[1:56:02] your taxes
[1:56:04] it's scriptural
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:11] some of you get it today some of you get
[1:56:13] it tomorrow some of you never get it
[1:56:18] he's pulling the donkey with his wife
[1:56:21] groaning
[1:56:24] and watching a star
[1:56:26] and all he could think about was taxes
[1:56:32] and god was forcing a move
[1:56:46] how many of you really like me and
[1:56:47] andrew being here
[1:56:49] matthew
[1:56:50] [Applause]
[1:57:08] i didn't want to move here
[1:57:18] i i didn't want to move here i was
[1:57:19] perfectly happy where i was at
[1:57:22] i was really happy i had a wonderful
[1:57:24] business
[1:57:26] don't worry god take care of that too
[1:57:31] i didn't want to move here
[1:57:33] i was happy evangelizing i was happy at
[1:57:36] work i was happy
[1:57:37] what i was doing
[1:57:39] and god showed me a vision
[1:57:41] of preaching at this church
[1:57:43] being a pastor of this church
[1:57:51] it didn't make me happy
[1:57:57] but brother on god showed you a vision
[1:57:58] that's right
[1:58:01] i find it amazing that sometimes god
[1:58:03] shows us vision of what our future is
[1:58:05] and we wrestle with it
[1:58:08] how many of you sisters have heard the
[1:58:10] truth through the years
[1:58:12] but you remember way back you remember
[1:58:14] way back then

[2:02:41] and it took just a moment
[2:02:44] to change his future
[2:02:46] forever
[2:02:49] it was settled
[2:02:52] young people it
[2:02:54] this isn't some special recipe
[2:02:57] what you sung last night and how god
[2:02:59] moved in your life last i watched it
[2:03:02] how god moved in your life
[2:03:04] the devil didn't do that god did that
[2:03:05] for you
[2:03:07] this may be the start but there's a
[2:03:09] whole lot of more pages left in your
[2:03:11] life
[2:03:16] hallelujah last night when you sung
[2:03:20] this is she
[2:03:23] it was more than a song
[2:03:24] it's more than words
[2:03:26] but what you were singing
[2:03:29] is i'm a part of this
[2:03:31] the rapture can't happen without
[2:03:40] me brother bill you and i have danced up
[2:03:44] and down the aisles
[2:03:46] and last week when i watched you dance
[2:03:49] that wasn't your last dance
[2:04:07] so don't let the devil say you're
[2:04:10] finished it's over with there's a lot of
[2:04:12] dances left
[2:04:14] on the pages
[2:04:16] of your book
[2:04:22] brother ray when i think about god's got
[2:04:23] my future i just can't help just

[2:04:44] the tumors that you have one's about
[2:04:46] this big one's about this big in your
[2:04:48] brain
[2:04:49] and so what what could happen is as they
[2:04:51] get so big
[2:04:52] they're kind of like a big blood spot
[2:04:55] and they're packed they're packed with
[2:04:56] cancer and and what they do is they get
[2:04:58] so big
[2:05:00] until eventually they bust
[2:05:04] you probably just slip away in your
[2:05:06] sleep
[2:05:09] now you know i could live with that
[2:05:11] thing tormenting me every day
[2:05:13] or i could read the book
