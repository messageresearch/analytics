jesus thank you so much lord for coming lord lord of the atmosphere is is charged i i sense it lord and feel it lord every person here is aware that they are in the presence of angels lord jesus we have come to worship only you and none other the atmosphere is charged the atmosphere is set for the supernatural and lord we commit our life into your hands just now every single one of us lord we commit our life under your hand these needs that have been presented we ask that thou would just move lord we ask that you would come lord one more time and use us for the upbuilding of thy kingdom we love you lord and we bless your holy name in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of matthew chapter 21. book of matthew chapter 21 also john chapter 4 and verse 23. wow what a what a song service this evening hallelujah certainly certainly was blessed by by all the specials the song leading this evening brother stephen well that was incredible i've always loved that song and i believe that's the bride's anthem i believe it's we have found him we have found him who all the scribes and the and the prophets foretold we have found him and he has told us who we are amen i ask your prayers for us this coming week we'll be headed to north carolina there in ruth north carolina to hold a youth banquet for brother joe greene and the church there and i ask that you'd be in prayer with us we're under under a great anticipation and an expectation of the lord and i'll ask that you pray with me i i am believing and asking the lord for a real break out there and at bible tabernacle and so if you would just pray with me on that i sure would appreciate it before we read this evening brother branham would say in the ephesian church age he said the he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches said how tragic it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank god in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness we are here in the day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ matthew chapter 21 and verse 1 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethpage under the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you shall find an ass tied and a coat with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say odd unto you you shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a quote the fall of an ass if you want to find that scripture you can go back in the book of zechariah chapter 9 to verse 9 and see that this is the prophecy now made manifest and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this you imagine the talk that day who is this who is this john chapter 4 and verse 23 and 24. say amen when you have it this evening i'll wait on you this evening but the hour cometh and now is and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to speak to you this evening on blessed is he that believes this is him blessed is he that believes this is him truly we realize that this evening that we are living in the the last days we truly we truly are aware that we are standing in one of the greatest days but yet it's one of the darkest days it's one of the most chaotic days that man has ever had to live in there's so much turmoil on the street there's so much turmoil in the mind there's never been a day like this day when men are more insane than they have ever been in all the days of their life and truly we are seeing that which was laying there in malachi 4 actually become manifest before our eyes that that before the coming of the lord in that great and dreadful day and truly we are living in what we would say a dreadful day for the politicians we are living in a very dreadful day for health workers and and all types of men but it's a very great day for you and i to be realizing that we are living in the hour that this is when the son of man is dispersing himself and releasing the very mind of god to his children in this hour and to say that the son of man is still amongst us i could say that we have been blessed is that right we have been blessed now now this is not the hour of the unbeliever it's not the hour of the skeptic though we have those there are this is not the hour of critics this is not the hour yeah we have we have we have men that criticize or skeptic or or disbelieve but this is not the hour of the unbeliever but this is the hour of the believer and you and i are living in the greatest day that's ever been upon the face of the earth brother branham would say that if i could have chose any day to come and live in i would have chose this day because it is the greatest day it's the coming of the lord it is the hour of the believer so i could say it to you like this that this is the hour of the blessed that do believe and here we are watching it seeing the very manifested signs of god that that this is the same messiah sign that came 2000 years ago that is working right in the midst of the church of the living god and here we are when when all the loose sins that had been loosed throughout the generations down through the dark ages and down through the man age here we are where we're watching the ministry of malachi 4 come and tie up those loose sins and that which was been prophecy is now made a reality and here we are feasting on the very son of man that's not the mind of man it wasn't william branham it wasn't the seventh angel it was the angel of the lord we're living in the greatest day in the greatest hour where we're watching we've never seen a worship like this before we've never seen a praise like this before we've never seen preaching of the world like this before sure we've had great preaching all the way throughout our history as message believers but you've never seen an outpouring of the holy ghost like you're watching in this hour what you seen last week ken was just a foretaste of that which is to come and if just like david would say if you don't like that watch this there is more to come and i'll say this that god is only going to get greater god is only going to get he is only going to get greater in our midst he's only going to prove himself stronger in our midst god is not changing but he is dispersing himself and displaying himself like never before in the midst of the church of the living god now i'm preaching to you this thought on blessed is he that believes that this is him over an event that happened and there's there's not but a handful of people that that even know about this i haven't shared this myself maybe brother timothy may have shared some of these things but while we were there in ohio i haven't even i didn't even mention it to many of the people there in ohio just kind of kept it to ourselves and they might be listening and hearing those things but but brother timothy had came in and i i'd hauled my i'd hauled my camper up there to the the meeting the youth meeting up there in ohio and brother timothy had came over to my to my camper and was sitting there and we were just having some coffee and fellowship and and the girls had had went over to brother aidan horst place there and seen his greenhouse and his farm and different things and they just had a they just had a lovely time there i won't tell everything but they just had an absolute lovely time but me and brother timothy were sitting there in my camper and we were just fellowshipping and we were talking about the supernatural and talking about things that had happened and we got to talking about when the event that we've spoke about much which is very very special to you and i as here at full gospel lighthouse about the event of the ipad that took place and we brother ron referred to that even last weekend but we were just fellowshipping on that upon that event that took place how supernatural and we were just saying to to us that was one of the greatest or the most supernatural things that we have seen in in quite some time we were just we were just fellowshipping on this thought and just talking about those things and i had been listening i've been listening to the attraction on the mountain early that morning about 6 6 30 in the morning and i was listening to what is the attraction on the mountain and and we've all very aware of that of that message that that's where brother tom brady was called out where he had that that little letter down there in his pocket about his wife and i was i was listening to those things and while me and brother timothy this is about some around 11 11 30 and i i'd cut that thing off and that that camper that i have has a bluetooth system that runs throughout the whole thing and all of a sudden that thing while we're fellowshipping on this thought that bluetooth cuts on and it has a message on it it says what moves you and there brother branham starts speaking and he looks at me he said is this happening again is this happening again and brother branham is reading over in matthew chapter 21 blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord now now i'm not making anything out of that but i'm just saying what the facts are i believe that this is him i believe with all of my heart that we're not living in a day gone by but this is the hour where we are watching the same one that came in the ministry of malachi 4 is here working through a many member bride and she is living out the prophet's prophecy i happen to believe that you are them i happen to believe that this is the people that are blessed beyond mesh if you are sitting here under this message you can say that i am blessed the denominations ain't got a clue what you're shouting about the church world don't got a clue what you're shouting about but blessed is he that believes that this is him that has come in the name of the lord oh i could say this to you with a shortly that this event has changed our life but jesus would grab in his very first sermon that he would take over on the sermon on the mountain and he would say in matthew chapter five and three blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled have you have you hungered for something you could say you're blessed to hunger for it for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you oh blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and say shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake when people talk about you you're blessed rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you can you say you are blessed look at your neighbor say i'm blessed brother brandon would say in the message of redemption by power he said you're always pointing at how wicked the world is getting he said but you fail to see how powerful that the church is getting all along he said she's standing alone she's standing on her feet you see she might be a small little flock but god is with her and if one thing that we can say with us shortly this evening we have seen the same angel operating in our midst and what an opportunity as the church of the living god to rise to our feet and to say and prove by the baptism of the holy ghost that this is him and you are the ones that will shake this world and turn her upside down what an opportunity as the body of jesus christ to be operating in a realm that only you can operate in brother but i'm going to say that the opportunity that you have been given paul would have loved to see enoch would have loved to see elijah would have loved to see all the prophets would have loved to sing but you're not running without a message tonight you're running with a king's message you've got something to say you've got something to shout about this is the lord's story this is the king that is in our midst hallelujah elijah would i love these opportunities but this is the hour of the manifested sons of god when everything that adam lost and eve lost throughout the fall but manifested sun to her eyes and began to possess that which they lost adam lost his peace adam lost humanity's peace but manifested sons walk in there and take back everything that was stole from them i'm not just talking about your family history right here i'm not just talking about your dna that there's something laying there but i'm talking about as sons of god you go in there and you get it for your brother you get it for your sister you get it for your church family you're a son of the most high god and satan cannot do nothing with you or if the same spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you it will quicken your mortal bodies so i want to say this to you you did not become seed by the rebirth you were see therefore you could be reborn the reason why you're led by the spirit is because you always was a son you may not look like a shark you may have not acted like a son you may have not even shouted or danced like a heart but always you were a son of god that's why satan's been on your case all of your life it's because there's something laying on the inside of you that sacred can't do nothing with he's always lusted after power but it is christ hidden behind the veil of humanity divinity has come down and transformed himself once again oh blessed is he that believes this is him [Applause] paul would say in romans 8 and 19 that the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god you think about this this what you're experiencing i i know i know that we have rejoiced we have there has we have went back and watched last week in service did you go back and watch it that's a liberty of the children of god and the bible said that where the spirit of the lord is there's a liberty now now now we don't just use that for a dancing quote we don't just use that for you to feel like you have a right to shout but there is a real liberty in the spirit of god now now to know that you have been in prison and to know that you have been set free of not just yourself but everything that was stacked up against you everything that was laying there and your mother and your father and your grandfather being a bootlegger and a moonshiner everything that was laying there you are now free and whom the son has set free whom the son is set free is free indeed i want to say this to you you have the liberty as the children of god to walk out of every gate and slam it back in the devil's face because you never were [Applause] you never were his prisoner you may have looked like a prisoner you may have had chains on like a prisoner but you were never his prisoner god has had you in his hands the whole time you may have took you a long time to come to this glorious liberty that only belongs to the children of god i'm not a slave i'm not a master to sin i am not under that test master i have heard the jubilee that i never did belong down there with that hoe i never did belong working down there in that field i have a right to go back i heard a sound of a russian mighty wind verse 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now we've all understood and heard this scripture for years that we know that all of creation grown and travaileth in pain until now that we had realized that the whole manifestation that the whole world is groaning but let me bring it down just a little bit closer for you i want to say this to you that your world your world is waiting for the manifestation of the power that's in you your job is waiting on you your children is waiting on you your family is waiting on you because the bible said that we have this treasure i have this treasure in earth and vessels that it is the excellency of the power of god maybe of god and not of ourselves this treasure that we have in this earth and vessel is of him so what you are seeing is a real sun worship you're watching real worship you're watching not a man worship but you are watching a real holy ghost worship this is not something that we proud you to do as brother howard and brother josh been back here with a pride and stick prayer telling you that you need to stand up in the preaching of the word has the preacher been back here telling you that you need to get excited and raise your hand and shout down the aisle has it done that has as anybody here has the leadership of full gospel lighthouse pushed you into worshiping the way you're worshiping then what can it be none other than the word bringing you to your attention as a son this is not a fake worship this is not a put on but this is a hard worship and hard worship will push you past what you see heart worship will make you look past what you sense real worship will take you to a god level for jesus would even say that he that hungereth or he that thirst let him come unto me and drink for he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water hallelujah how to get in there brother shannon how did it get in there brother james jeffrey how did it get in there out of your belly look at your neighbors hey out of your belly out of your belly out of your belly out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water let me say this to you there's a power that is laying on the inside of you that has got to come out there's a worship inside of you that's got to come out deliverance is inside of you and your whole world is waiting on you out of your belly let me bring it a little closer your healing is in you your deliverance is in you your right mind is in you your praise is in you your worship is in your powers in the body glory is in the body it's got to come out it's in you there's a real worship in you and it's got to come out that's why satan is trying so hard to convince you that you're not worthy he's trying his very best that you trying to tell you you're not strong enough he's trying to tell you that you are never his you and he's trying to tell you that you're not strong enough not worthy enough not good enough you see the reason why he's fighting against you is the power that lays in you he can't contain it all the hell's cages all the hell's traps can't contain you [Music] [Applause] every every idea that he's got every scheme that is god every tactic that is god can't hold the power that's in you you say well i don't feel like very much let me say if you get a hold of satan satan has messed up [Applause] goliath had his last day your depression will have its last day your anxiety will have the last day god is looking for david to get a hold of him take a stone of the revelation and he has said i have begun to give you the land you go in there and you possess the land i have begun to give you this message you go in there and take that message i have went in there and gave you the holy ghost you go in there and get the holy ghost i didn't give you your healing go in there and get it go in there possess it it's in you out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water [Applause] oh just smile at the devil you got him in a corner it's our job to offer up a sacrifice of praise you are royal priesthood the bible said that he hath made you kings and priests and as a royal priest we are to offer up a sacrifice of praise and when you go back and you begin to study over in the book of exodus and the book of leviticus you'll find back there that moses is setting up the priesthood over in the book of leviticus and he's setting up the anointing you know that we've been through it as he has to walk right and everything's got to be in its order but when when before the priesthood can go out and offer the blood upon the altar for the peace offering he has got to be dressed right everything's got to be in order but the priest's blood that that moses would go and he would take the blood and he would place it upon the high priest he would go and he would place it on the high priest of all of his right extremities he would place it on his ear he would place it on his hand and he would place it on his foot it was all a sign that the priest was ready and in a spot to go before jehovah in a sign of peace that he would walk out there so let me say this to you when the priest would hear he would hear for the blood when he would work with his hands in the duties of the priesthood he would work through the blood and every time that he would take a footstep he would walk through the blood the reason why you hear this message in its purity and in its trueness is because you've got the blood [Applause] the blood every time you make a footstep and the reason why it's not just you and it's something else you're walking with the blood oh it's the dripping blood brother man would look up there and he said what is that sound what is that thump thump thump doing up that road he said i look up there and i see those blood drops coming down calvary's hill it's a trail to the cross oh glory be to god so when you hear the preaching of the word you're hearing through the blood the reason why there's people that cannot worship and cannot worship under the message of malachi 4 is they are under a bloodless religion [Applause] they're trying to handle they're trying to handle the bible and they're trying to handle this message without the blood on them they have tried to make mercy over and say there is no mercy but as long as he is still on the throne there is still mercy where mercy is given you remember back here in that war when that pigeon was sent out with a message you remember that they they would attach the message to that pigeon to that dove and it would fly out and that dove would fly out with the message that was attached to his foot and when the enemy would see that pigeon or that dove flying over they would try to shoot it because their allies or their or the or their enemy that they were facing was asking for reinforcements they were trying to give out the battle cry of how things were going down there and so they tried to shoot that pigeon they tried everything they clipped his wing and they and they hit his foot and when the message got when the message got to its destination the message had the blood on it let me say this to you the dove of the holy spirit has been flying through this place trying to get to you he's trying to tell you that the message has got the blood on it all you got to do is receive it so let me say this to you you that are in trouble reinforcements are on their way your king is coming [Music] so paul would say so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god the reason why you hear it like you hear it there's a blood been placed on you the token life of the lord jesus christ has been placed upon you and brother branham would say that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you as a substance and when it's there then nothing is going to shake you from it nothing can shake you from it when it's laying there you might go through some time and you might go through some crisis but nothing can shake you from it because it is a perfect faith that has been manifested to the body it's identified itself and is laying there in you and you remember when jesus when jesus was up there and brother branham would grab from i believe matthew chapter 11 and he would go up there and he would preach on the forgotten beatitude and he goes over there and you'll hear brother branham talk about john's ego eye getting filmed over and he there he had a few days before that he had witnessed that this was the lamb of god but when john got up there in prison and he was up there he began to speak to his disciples through the prison walls he be sent to hear about the works of christ and jesus or john told them go and talk to him and say art thou he that cometh or do we look for another that's why brother branham would say that his eagle eye got filmed over but watch as the eagle eye begins to open back up what did jesus come what did he do when they came there those disciples had been taught what the messiah would do they'd been taught what the messiah would look like they've been taught how he would handle himself but notice what jesus did he didn't go there brother random said he didn't go there and he didn't offer unto john said go back here and offer him this book on happiness how to be happy down in jail he didn't offer him a book on patience on how to be patient down in jail he said but go back and you show john and tell john all of these things that you're seeing the blind have seen the death hath heard the dead are raised back to life the lepers are walked the lepers are cleansed watch it's a healing service that's going on and brother branham said that those disciples stayed up there with jesus all evening long you've been up there all evening long and you've been watching the same signs go tell john what did he do what did he do he told him you go back and you tell john that i'm right on schedule you go back and you tell john everything's right on schedule don't you be scared i'm right in line you're right in line don't you be afraid don't pay attention to nothing else i'm right on schedule and then jesus comes down and he says this forgotten beatitude he said blessed is he that is not offended in me brother branham would say in the forgotten beatitude he said in otherwise he said blessed is he that believeth in me and today we are living in an hour when men are more offended at jesus than any other name they don't want him in the schools they don't want him in our governments or in the governments they don't want him in the halls of congress they don't want him there we're living in a society when men are ashamed of jesus they're ashamed of his works they're ashamed to call on his name they're ashamed of his power they're ashamed to stand for this truth they're ashamed to say that they're identified with a message of malachi 4. i am not ashamed to stand with this message but this is not the hour of the ashamed but this is the hour of the unashamed because in the bible it said in the book of joel that that i will restore unto you all the years that the locusts and the calm the the palmer worm and the caterpillar and other than the cake worm i will restore to you all of those years and you shall eat in plenty and my people shall never be ashamed and paul would say in romans 1 and 16 that i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of salvation to him that believeth you are blessed to be able to believe this is him this is him go show john go tell john what's been your job eat this book feed on this book prophesy again go show john go show john he says in 1800s under the man age there was a there was a man by the name of george muller george muller you hear me okay george miller it was a great evangelist from in the realms of germany and over in bristol england and it was over there he was a great evangelist under the anointing of the man aged 1800s and ran a great and great successful successful orphanage and many times when when george muller you can go back and read the history on the church you can go back there and you'll find george muller in there and george miller was a man of great faith he there was many times when he was running that orphanage that they had zero amount of food and throughout the whole orphanage and how many how many kids would be in that orphanage he would tell he would tell the maids and tell the helpers there said go ahead and set the plates and everybody sit down go ahead and sit down and i believe that god will provide some food for all of these children well the time they come and sit down about the time to eat there somebody come knocking on the door they just had a great harvest out in their garden and said i felt led to come down here and to feed your children to give these things you see george mueller knew how to pray but one time george mueller was on his way over from bristol and he was on his way over bristol england not bristol tennessee or bristol virginia but he was on his way over to quebec canada and there he was at the bridge at the harbor about to take a ship and they had been sitting on the bridge for 24 hours and there george miller went to the captain he said captain i have to be in quebec by saturday i have an engagement that i am to speak at and i i have never missed one engagement and the captain said mr mueller i i don't know anything about you but i want you to know there's no way that i can get out of this harbor he said he said by looking at the density of this fog he said we'll not get out of here and you'll miss it he said mister he said mister he said i have never missed one time in 75 57 years i have never missed one engagement if you can't get me there god will bring some other way to get me there he said how about me and you go down into the chart room and why don't me and you just begin to pray real quick and there this captain thought man this dude's a lunatic he just broke out of the asylum ain't never seen anything like that and george miller gets down there and they get down there in a chart room and they start having a conversation he said look mr mueller the density of the fog is too much he said look your eyes trained on it that way but my eye is trained to look at the living god and not at the circumstances that i am faced to look upon he said and he began to get down and history said that george muller got down and he began to pray one of the most simple prayers and when he got back up the captain began to get down on his knee and george muller grabbed him said don't do that he said one thing you don't believe that god will answer secondly i believe that god already has he said captain if you'll go out there and throw open the door you'll see that the fog is gone and george muir made it to quebec on that saturday and it didn't break an engagement because he knew how to pray he knew how to call on god now here if men could operate in that kind of realm in a man age what about in this eagle age when we are flying above higher than any other man has ever flew before what about you operating under this anointing brother wayne lawson told me told me a story that that brother matt morris had ran into his man brother matt morris is out there in arkansas there he ran into this man

with with with some members there that they were acquainted with and there they had some fellowship and they began and the presence of the lord began to move into the room there where they were and they started talking about brother branham and there was this other man that had that had come and he heard he he had come by their table and he said excuse me he said i i heard y'all talking talking about the lord or talking about a man named uh branham he said and then and matt moore said that this man was not this man was not identified with brother branham being a minister he said he said but

branham said he said would you mind if if i if you showed me your son and so she said well sure sure you know come on in she thought maybe that was kind of strange that how he asked and so brother branham went on went on into the house and this boy had had been placed in a bed and never walked any day of his life and he'd been placed up there and they would carry him up the stairs at nighttime put him up there and leave him there and he couldn't walk and and so brother branham she took brother branham up the steps and and walked up the air and and brother branham turned and said would you

back in 1959 and i'm i'm coming to a close as soon as i can get there my brother brandon preaches a message and brother brahm actually says he's holding a revival on the holy ghost at his home church there brother branham preaches three sermons you go and listen to him 1959 brother branham preaches a series on the holy ghost what is the holy ghost and what is the holy ghost given for uh on i believe it's december the 19th brother branham holds question and answers on the holy ghost it's powerful powerful powerful a series of sermons to go and listen to and young people i admonish you to go and listen to him but brother branham brother branham is there and he is speaking but there you'll watch if you come down there in question and answers you'll hear these things you'll hear it on tape and brother branham said he said there i was he said i was preaching i was preaching on the people getting the holy ghost and he said and all of a sudden he said there was two things that happened in that series he said there he said there came forth a an interpretation and speaking in tongues and the holy ghost began to fall on the people he said that was for edification he said it was vindicating what the message had said that he said there i was saying blessed is he that believes the blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord he said and all of a sudden something quick real quick said otherwise blessed is he that believes that the lord has come in this blessed is he that believes that the lord has come in this he said there i was trying to get the people to get the holy ghost he said and there the devil was going around he was going around and telling the people don't listen sit still don't listen sit still go and go and listen to it see if i'm right don't listen sit still he said there the holy spirit was trying to get into the people and the enemy was there working whenever god is at work satan is nearby he's trying to stop the very move of god don't listen set still and brother branham's own sister dolores would say bill while you was a preaching i got so excited she said i could have jumped up and shouted and run through a wall she said but but then when those people got to shouting like they did all of a sudden i felt like i was a little old nothing brother brangham said that was your time to stand up and praise the lord right there no matter what the enemy's whispered in your ear it's your time to shout no matter he said that was a time to stand up that was a time to rise up you see you are you are a spiritual priesthood offering up a sacrifice of praise we've been waiting for your time to shout you've been waiting for your hour you've been waiting let me say this to you you have had an ample opportunity you've been given opportunity after opportunity don't you be offended when somebody goes to shouting if you walked in their shoes for one moment you would know why they're shouting you would understand why they praise the way they do i'm not trying to promote anything here but i'm just i've been i've been i've been very be very sincere before you people i've been very sincere before you people to set my life to the third pool to the ministry of malachi for to studying this message i've been studying this message only 10 12 years now 12 13 years now but i have spent my time studying this message we've just caught i believe as a as a duty as a duty as as a servant of god it is my duty to get the message to the people and every weekend we get more and more now this may not be this is for you this is for you what what happens on the other side of that stream that's for them but this is for you you've heard me you've heard me talking about this you've heard me saying that that we're bumping into angels we're bumping into angels and reason why i'm saying that is because it's a quote that brother branham said that when you die he said if you die he said you're able to be aware you're in another world you're able to sense you're able to see he said but here you don't understand you can't understand everything he said you don't understand the why the way you do the way you do he said what it is you're bumping into those things all along he said there in that other dimension you can see why you're doing those things but in this dimension you can't see why you're doing those things i've been saying you heard me say it saturday night you heard me say you've heard me say it throughout this ministry we're bumping into angels that story brother branham would say that the reason why that he said you feel a strong a strange feeling come over top of you and say i could just shout i could just cry he said what is it you're bumping into the angel of the lord what was happening last weekend is you were bumping into angels and there with my own eyes i want you to go back and i want you i want you to go and listen and watch about my minute my marker minute 55 i don't want you in my marker this is how my mind works forgive me but minute 55 on sunday morning all of the stops begin to get pulled out and all of a sudden the angel lord moved the angel lord began to move now this is what i want you to know what happened to me on saturday night i can't explain it but i was in another world and i was given those songs to sing and katie was writing them down as fast as i was spitting them out she was writing them down and i thought now what in the world i told him said tell dad he'll know what to do he'll know what to do just have a party just have a party have a holy ghost party well there i was i i was thinking brother matthew didn't matthew didn't sing that song you forgive me but i want you to understand i want you to understand some things and brother matthew didn't come down i believe it was number five for grace and brother matthew didn't sing that song you don't know like i know and i thought man because i i take ministry very serious and i take singing very seriously and i i'm very i'm very sincere in in worship because i i know it's it's the time right before the preaching of the word everything's in order and i i honestly would have never done this unless there would have been something said because i i want i want the atmosphere just right and you understand what i'm saying but all of a sudden i i began to sing that song you don't know like i know when you were you were reason the reason why you you you saw what happened the reason why you were rejoicing you watched your pastor that was supposed to be dead had a death warrant on him cancer said it would kill him brain brain cancer said it would kill him tumor said it would kill him and you watched your pastor ain't nobody ain't nobody i'm gonna say anybody ain't nobody can sing that song you don't know like i know like brother ron spencer and when you saw your leader dancing on the head of goliath it caused a shout throughout all of israel i'm not building up something i'm telling you you were bumping in to angels [Applause] we've got the head of this goliath and it's a time to chase down his brothers every one of his foes everyone and every enemy that has robbed something from you i'm telling you we've got his head on the sword cancer you are finished you don't know like i know what he's done for me and all of a sudden they begin to i believe it's all my heart because i know there was an angel circling there was an angel circling and all of a sudden it just looked like normal worship but all of a sudden there was a people that began to bump into some angels you seen some real miriam dances that were going forth and if you go back i can show you the clip if you need it but you can go back brother gabriel sister sarah brought this to my attention when my wife sister katie i wouldn't normally do this but because i have been preaching this quote that you're bumping into angels this is why i'm preaching this to you but you watch you watch my wife come down that aisle and dance backwards and all of a sudden she gets up here and it looks like she runs into a wall it looks like she runs into a wall but she hits nothing what is it she is bumping into an angel what is it why are you rejoicing the way you're rejoicing because blessed is he that believes this is him i'm not trying to work you up i'm trying to tell you the reason why you're worshiping like you're worshiping because you are blessed to see what you see you are blessed to do what you do blessed is he that believes this is him this ain't ron spencer this ain't andrew spencer this is not for gospel lighthouse this is him you're not as a musician coming this is not just this is not just some voice there's a voice behind the voice whatever you do don't miss it whatever you do don't miss it don't miss it don't miss that voice behind the voice don't miss what's happening here don't take this don't listen to the devil it says sit still don't listen to him it's your time because this is him this
