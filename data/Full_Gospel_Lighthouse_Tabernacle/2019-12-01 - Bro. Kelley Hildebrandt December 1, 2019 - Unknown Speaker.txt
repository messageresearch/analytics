========================================

[Applause] if he deserved all of that I say a man traveled three days to preach to us he deserves that more god bless you all it's so good to be here we had quite the events the last few days and I don't think we'll ever quite have that same pattern ever happen to us again but man we sat on that tarmac a long time we're over six hours on that airplane and they couldn't even give you hardly any water find the awesome for a cop and he gave me one to look up but we were there and then the pilot said he said well he said we got a 50-50 chance whether this engines gonna work and we thought well we're gonna take that chance and we did take it it was it was scary when he took off and well we're here and we're here because of your prayers is why we're here then we ended up in Toronto yesterday and we were supposed to get our flight to come to Washington and and they had oversold it they lost our reservation somehow in their system and and so we were on standby when we ate all us we had guaranteed seats and we walked right to the farthest end of Toronto Airport that you cared for a walk to and and then the girl said you know what you're better off to go home and I said I'm not going home I said you're gonna find me some seats I said I'm gonna stand right here while you do it at the same time you were praying here and I believe that God supernaturally gave them the ability to find seats they called all the people they could call and finally they said we have two seats for you going to Washington tomorrow morning so we were really thrilled about that while there's so many things that happened in that time period and but we thank you each one of you for your prayers thank you for that and brother Ron thank you for what you all have said we are family and we feel like we're family and we've been with coming here for a while now and maybe a few new faces but we just feel like we're part of you people the first time I came here to this church I don't know if you want to stand for a while that's fine if you want to sit down that's fine too but first time I came here I remember brother Homer saying that song ain't no grave gonna hold my body down and and actually became one of my favorite songs as well and while I was traveling here actually was on my heart that they would sing that song while I'd be here not knowing that they would actually sing it today and what a blessing it was to have it song I I kind of had a Jubilee time sometimes you don't realize but God works on both ends of the stick you're practicing and not knowing it's on my heart and sister Meir knows one of my favorite songs I play it once in a while and I just really feel the anointing because I I believe in a supernatural God and whether I'm living or whether I go by the way of the grave there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down when he calls I'm gonna answer you we're gonna answer amen and what a time we're looking for is for that time well our church sends its greetings to you all and sister Kay sends her greetings and it's nice that brother can't sister Lorraine with us and we certainly do appreciate your pastor brother Ron and his family they've been real friends to us and thank you for sharing him once in a while with us back in Saskatchewan and we try to make him feel comfortable enough that they'll come back again even if it gets cold outside and you know we've had such a wonderful times with them in the Lord and they've been a great asset to our assembly and helped our people a lot and our family a lot and I want to say God bless you and thank you for for allowing him to come our way if you have your Bibles tonight I want to turn to first Thessalonians chapter 1 and I'd like to read verse 5 isn't the Lord good to us amen we did get to visit while we were kind of saying our sister Maura I said you know what this is interesting is that we're flying one city a day and that's what we've done for three days and we're so happy to be here first Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 5 very familiar Scripture no doubt it's been been used many times over this pulpit here for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake let's just go to the Lord in prayer for a moment if you have a need upon your heart just with an uplifted hand here this evening our we believe God hears in the answers prayer Lord Jesus what a privilege it is Lord to be gathered together again Lord in this house Lord a place Lord that has set aside Lord for worship a place where your word can be spoken Lord in in freedom Lord and we pray father and we thank you Lord for bringing us safely here we appreciate these people or the prayers of the people Lord and and the pastor brother Ron his family Lord the people of this assembly and I pray now Lord that you'll just take full control of this service Lord may the holy spirit move in in a mighty way amongst us tonight Lord and Lord may you meet every need of each person that would be here Lord we believe with all our hearts Lord that you here and that you answer a prayer and so father we are looking unto you now I pray father that you would take the tiredness Lord from my body Lord and may you just charge it Lord by His supernatural intervention Lord we commit this service unto you now for the glory of God in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you you may have your seats tonight it was a few months ago I received a pamphlet in the mail in on that particular pamphlet there was a commemorative coin from world war ii which which is really a symbol of victory but what caught my attention with this particular coin and i remember brother ron mentioning to me while he was at our assembly that you had a brother in your church by the name of brother max Evans and he was actually part of that Normandy invasion that came in there and I received this coin and it really caught my attention when I read the pamphlet and said on it we will accept nothing less than full victory which was which was written by Dwight Eisenhower and as the d-day coin and and I showed it to brother Ron when he was out of our church if you want to just come forward brother Ron and it was something they said it was for one family in Canada if he wanted to order it and so what I did is I was able to get another coin and I wanted to give it to you hear this more this evening hour on that coin is actually an embedded into the coin is actually the actual sound from Norman Dean when I read that coin I there was such a powerful statement to me when he said full victory that I I applied it and I thought about ourselves as Christians in this hour in message believers that we should accept nothing less than full victory and and if I could for a moment of time tonight I'd like to administer to us for a while just on that thought I don't know where you are in your walk with the Lord but I believe that we're in an hour where the Church of the Living God is rising in a higher level in this ever risen before Amen we're in the timeframe where we're actually called in order to have a body change where the dead and Christ will rise and and I believe that in order for that to transpire we have to have a faith that we've never had before amen we we've read a lot of books we listen to a lot of tapes and and when we study the message but there's gonna come a time when this bride actually is moving in action amen worse not just letters on a page any longer but it's something more that's coming into the heart of the believer amen and and I believe we've turned a corner with in many of our assemblies in our sembly we turn a corner where the Spirit of God is moving in ways that he's never moved before amen I believe we're getting ready for a take-off time amen in the church in this hour I believe should be moving on in in full victory all the time we go through our battles and we go through our trials and we go through our difficulties but when Christ is living down in our heart not just something that's a mechanical or something that it's intellectual but something that drops down into our heart into the soil relman and has completely changed us and make us new creatures in Christ Jesus amen when that transpires in our heart there's an unction from the Holy One that takes ahold of the church amen like we've read it and we've we've listened to it but there's got to come a time when this church of the Living God stands on her feet in power and in victory amen not just part of the time but all the time amen maybe just a little more monitor if you could I believe it's transpiring amen we're seeing people that are that are sick we're seeing people get healed we're seeing people who have lived lives of lukewarmness who are standing now in the inner power in this hour that they've never saw before amen I believe with all my heart the church is rising on we sing the song the church is rising up but it's no longer just words within there within their vocabulary it's something that's real within their heart amen may the church say so tonight amen we're time when the word is being quickened to her heart amen and we believe it with all her heart it's something that has settled in our heart I was reading something just the other day that that somebody sent to me and and a brother and a man that Smit preached this word this gospel for 40 years ulsan he's deciding that there's nothing to it anymore in my heart I made up my mind a long time ago amen this message of the hour is something that it's going to bring a rapture on to the Church of the Living God amen it's bringing a faith in her heart amen to believe the Word of God and to apply it in their lives in action a minutes than this hour amen all the ages have looked for this day but I believe that we're in the time frame at this hour where the Spirit of God is moving among the people amen times we say well you know we come to church and and we hear sermon after sermon and and we hear gifted man preaching and we hear other people minister and whatever more but we don't realize that as we eat this word in this hour it is literally changing us Amen I look at a child you look at a little baby you feed them and feed them and feed them it seems like nothing's happening but something's happening there's a change that's happening John on the inside amen and that child before you know it starts to grow in stature but there comes a time where it's full-grown amen this is the hour that the bride of Jesus Christ should be standing on her feet believing the Word of God applying that Word of God in her life amen what good would it be just to have a word and have nothing true that word Amen that would make us no better than a Baptists or a Presbyterian or even a Pentecostal or anything like that organization what is it that would make us no more than that there's got to be something more than that amen and people are and many times I find people are afraid of the supernatural God when we should not be afraid of the supernatural God we should embrace it with all of our heart amen of God wants to move I say let him move amen let him come on the scene amen stir our hearts change our young people change our middle-aged people amen there should be wear in that season of time amen worthy impossible becomes possible Amen that's where we're at you know Paul said something interesting first Corinthians two verse four and five he said in my speech of my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and the power that your faith that say my faith say it one more time my faith that your face should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God amen now this church the Corinthian church was as brother Brown said was one of the weakest churches of the time amen all they had in their heart was the elevation of men and different men they were associated with but Paul who was really the gifted man of the day amen he stands before this church and he says my speech of my preaching was not with enticing words in other words there's no place for psychology in this message amen this is not a rehab center but this is a place of deliverance Amen this is where God comes on the scene amen that changes hearts and changes lives hallelujah it's not time to - as Paul just to say well that was really great in and he really had a nice way of putting it I might have some backwards ways but I believe in the power of the Living God amen I believe he changes lives and changes people amen why back in those days that had the same problem they wanted enticing words brother Branham said that and according to the scripture that they had itching ears and he said it was the people that had the itching year so there became ministry in order to fulfill that amen and why Paul is saying that he didn't want our faith to stand in the wisdom of a man but in the power of God amen which is the Dunamis of God amen which is the dynamite of God amen and whenever there's there's power on the scene that supernatural things are going to transpire amen first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 it says for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power amen in other words it's not just in the logos but but it's also in power because what good is a word if there's no power behind that word amen if you have something and you can repeat those words and parent those words that may be alright but what we need us we need the power behind it in order to make it living amen we need to have a wineskin as it that's pliable in this hour that can accept the revelation of the word Amen and so that it won't break up all the time Amen I find it very ironic in many places you go in and you start ministering and and the people start getting excited which we should amen and the next thing you know there's some people think minor just disturbing the peace amen I thought that was always another church but but you think it's church what we need to do is let ourselves cool on time amen that God can move in our myths hallelujah amen and not just allow well I don't know why they're getting so excited about that we all just had Thanksgiving how many had pecan pie oh not too many maybe pumpkin pie I got more hands bigger than the pumpkin pie but I'll guarantee they add up before and I tell you what it probably tasted real good before but we never get tired of that Amen I never get tired of the of the Word of God or the power of God hey man why because it changes our lives amen of God's provided that's what I'm interested in changing of lives Amen it's one thing to to feel the anointing of the Lord but I wanted to go down in that inside of the inside amen because if we're not born again we're not getting out of here amen you we got to be born again we've got to be sealed to the day of our destination Amen somebody help me tonight amen we've got to have something down that's in our heart that sealed off the worlds on the outside I'm sealed in with Christ amen no devil and he'll will be able to stand before the child of the Living God amen we've got to be have fortitude about ourselves Amen not just sit back well you know that was a good service today but you know I've heard that probably before and I've heard those quotes before I've heard those things before no it should be just as real is the first time you heard it Amen I'm afraid that people have left their first love a man they forget about the time they came to Christ amen when when God came into your life and change your life a man I never want to forget my first love a man I want to have it tucked inside of my heart amen when God moves I want to be right there and say hallelujah amen to the word of Almighty God amen thank you for allowing me to be myself um if yeah that's okay I'm just gonna be myself tonight God's provide a place of worship 1965 paragraph 137 he says now notice and when this great moving power of God comes into a son of God it quickens him the spirit of life enters into him then what does it do it seats them in heavenly places let's say heavenly places tonight amen in other words your you're coming into a spiritual realm amen and when you enter that spiritual realm brother Brown says all things are possible amen we may not see it but we know it's there amen and if we know it's there we just have to enter into that realm amen then if you have need of healing healings for the church amen if you have need of something in your life then it's there for the people amen and you don't have anything to worry about amen right now not they will be we are now in heavenly places amen now we're already resurrected the dynamics and the mechanics is gone to work it's quickening us and we're quickened up into the presence of God where his spirit is and now we are seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus in crises are sitting in there that great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead we're a part of it if you're a part of the bride you are because the bride is a part of the crew amen we're reflection of him amen you are because a bride is part of the groom you know so we find out that's it's the same thing and she'll do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a lady osya I say no sir I'm not going to be no lady Asiya not by no means a lukewarm no I'm not gonna I mean I'm a man I'm not gonna be no lady of sin and I'm gonna be not a lukewarm person Amen if we can't serve God with passion when I think of what they did on d-day there had to be some passion about them amen they went out there they gave their lives in order that we could have freedom Amen I want to say that the King of Kings and the Lord of lords he came down to earth amen to give his life a ransom a mint that we could go free even it was a passion within him and the least we can do is give him our all of this hour we should be passionate about the things of God amen not just a lukewarm and and just well that was not bad and and just callousness about us amen I mentioned this too I hope this okay tonight but I mentioned this to my to our church back home I said if we're not careful we are we are actually going to get used to the presence of God and before you know it we'll get so used to it then it won't have no effect upon our life no more amen I I want to have a fresh let the holy spirit be fresh every day hey man I don't want to ever get used to well you know that wasn't too bad that wasn't too bad of a song or that wasn't too bad well somebody got healed yes that's what we expect and just lukewarm no I want our passion in this hour amen a passion to serve God a passion to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ amen living and in the in the galatea the Word of God for today amen excuse me for yelling I don't I know you're not deaf but it's just part of me he says she won't be little lady osya and not by no means lukewarm that's one thing I can't stand I cannot stand lukewarm food I can't stand lukewarm water I can't take any of it amen I like this last part but she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God amen we are moving on and there'll be people who won't be moving on but the bride's moving on hey I believe we're all part of the bride here today hey man were moving on we live in a generation where powers on the minds of the people have to forgive me actually actually was just what had laryngitis on Wednesday night so so you pray sister Martin was telling me how come you're preaching wins and I said God takes care of it we're living in an age where power is on the people's minds are you going to buy a car I'm mad and they're not there they want to give you some horsepower now hey man they're no longer just 130 150 horsepower they're like 350 450 500 800 900 I have to be honest with you I like power amen when I put my foot into it yeah I love it I love the sound of the air coming in I love the sound of the exhaust I there's something about it I love American v8 engines amen a you don't have to pipe into it in that that you hear the sound that's right there it's real a man I maybe didn't know that but some car companies they actually put the v8 sound in the speakers so I think there's a lot of churches a little thing maybe they got no power they're just kind of pumping it into it but it's not really having an effect on the people amen when you put her down it's not going anywhere amen but when it's a real power it's going somewheres amen you put your foot into it it's going somewheres amen but they're speaking about a lot of all power in this generation it's all you hear about is power we can say we've gone from the horse and buggy Age we've gone right to the rock and age but one of the things that I that I'm really intrigued about is that fossil fuel has been our mainly our source of power in in the generation going by but the part that's really coming into effect today is electric power no lecture power is altogether different because it's an instant torque and an instant power amen and and and so now we're finding that they're they're really having an influence on the auto industry where they're they're they're promoting electric cars I'm going someplace with this and and in in that electric car has way more power than a gasoline-powered engine you could put turbochargers on it you could put super charges on it you can put a lot of things on it but all you have to do is have an energy source and just some electric motors and you have instant power amen they got these new cars Tesla most guys know about amaretti and and and they're they're racing against all these super cars and they don't have a chance they don't have a chance but there's something about it that was really interesting to me and this apart that really that really thrilled my heart they have what's called super charging stations when you go to a super charge station because you're getting out of power to me it's like coming to church you need sometimes you get a super charge amen but you know a super charger will only charge up that battery 80 in 30 minutes a lot of people that stay they maybe like an 80% charge but if you want a full charge it's gonna take about two or three hours to get a full charge amen and so so sometimes it takes a little bit more to fill it up amen but I say in this hour we want full charge amen we don't just want a apart charge anymore amen it's good to come into the house of the Lord and hear a little sermon and then maybe stir you up for a while but you're gonna lose your energy real quick amen what we need in this hour is a full charge in this hour where God moves on the scene and moves on the life of people and changes our hearts till they believe the Word of God with all their hearts why people are happy just give me a 30 minute sermon after all that's what church order says in one part but another part is that we could preach all night if we were believers electric power we're living in an hour of power what I think about that then I think the church should be moving on to power we've got cordless drills nowadays at and cordless tools and brushless tools that got more power you throw away the old coordinate stuff I also notice that they've come up with these new light bulbs called LED light bulbs we really like them they don't her to use any power at all but you get old way more lumens you get out of any other pole so what's in areas that we should realize that that this is the time for a rapture because if the natural is moving in one way then the Spirit of God has to be moving in another fashion amen and as technology increases they're going as far as they can go amen but there's one thing they can never produce they'll never produce a godly life in the people amen back at home we we have so many places where where people want to go in order to to get help for whatever their problems ails them but they don't want Christ in their life a mitt but what we need us we need Jesus Christ in our lives amen when he turns on the light amen it's gonna scatter all darkness away amen if you're depressed it'll take to oppression away amen if you're an addicted to substance it will take all the dictions away amen if somebody with me tonight Amen why because it's an hour where the power of Almighty God is here like it's never been here before brother Branham says the entire Holy Spirit visits the church in the centime hour amen we're not just under Luther's message no more we need justification but we're moving higher we're no longer just under Wesley's message any more sanctification but we need it amen but we're in an age when there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost amen not just sown on the physical man but down inside the heart amen when that starts of moving in a man you never know what God's gonna do I think sometimes people are afraid of it I say we sing that song let go let God have this wonderful way hey man that really means let go hey man when you're not where you're don't worry about who sent beside you who sitting around you but you let go and let God have his wonderful way I believe was in the message on what does the Holy Ghost questions and answers on the Holy Ghost in 1959 IV was brother branham's sister that said she fell some that she could jump through the wall and and then she started to doubt and she had brother Browne what should I should have done he said you should have jumped hey man if it's the Holy Ghost telling you the job he's gonna make a hole for you to get through you don't have to worry about hitting anything amen why because what happens is we limit God with our with our carnal mind amen and we're afraid to let him have his way well you know I felt I had a little ailment so I I don't know maybe maybe maybe I'm not healed after all no you're healed well maybe I don't know I still have some of these desires we'll put the devil under your feet amen well sometimes I still do things I shouldn't do on the internet stuff well just go to other places on the Internet amen wait what are you doing you're climbing higher in Christ amen you've got the power in this hour to do it amen brother Brown says we got full power in this hour I say let's put it into practice Church hallelujah we're preaching on full victory and if we're ever gonna help fold victory who we really gonna put it to practice every day amen what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that body unites together are we ready the full power let's say full power the full power of the Holy Ghost would rise raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of His Holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the Holy Spirit amen so we need a mechanics and we meet dynamics is all things you're familiar with but it's what the Lord laid on my heart and and by God's grace I'm trying to put two sermons together yesterday and today so you bear with me amen we should be moving in full power God's only provided place of worship notice anak God's perfect reflection in time when God was through with him he just translated him took him up the mechanic said he had reflected became dynamics with the spirit and took him up amen has it been said many times we can polish hubs all we want amen I remember my grandfather he had he had an old car in the bush and you know it's what they used to do on the farm they'd get a car and they never sold them they just parked him in the trees and it didn't take very long the whole thing start deteriorating but I can remember as a child growing up man we get in that car we can make all the noise coming back to cars again and we make all the noise and we do pretend were putting it in gear but when we got out of the car we hadn't gone anywhere hope your spiritual tonight Amen we should be going someplace Amen it's not vain we gather together amen we're going someplace anyway we got a body change to take a man I'm still on a body change still in this hour because I still believe I'm gonna be changed with all my heart a man I still have my picture sitting on our on our credenza in the in our bedroom a man I always say I don't want to be shocked when we're gonna look at when I'm changed because one day I'm going to look in the mirror and I'm gonna be changed Amen why because the dynamics of McCann is going to come together amen it's gonna change us in our mortal body amen and we're gonna be walking up until that point just like Enoch walked a minute one day he just was not he met this church is going to take a rapture amen I don't know if you ever heard that before but I'll tell you again the Church of the Living God University is going to take a rapture amen and there's going to be many members in the body of Christ universally who's going to make up that rapture and they will be ready and the ones that aren't ready well I guess they're just not coming along amen so I recommend let's get ready amen that's why we we're in full victory it's not just words we're saying I'm not just saying things here to make you feel good I'm saying things because I believe this with all my heart amen I'm looking forward to that time and for that hour a man I'm living for him I'm starting to get Dre here super of the run no I'm not dying him yet either but and I'm not planning to do that but I'm looking forward brother Verne so we get all black headed again or whatever color here it was it's coming when the dynamics and mechanics start working something's gonna happen amen God's gonna well it's the people I believe it's the people holding it back why am i gates organized religion now we are active in the things from above now the spirit Minds the word that to me is always a key statement just for a moment here the spirit in a person's life Minds the Word of God amen sometimes the people hear the word and they actually don't appreciate it when we should appreciate it I'd rather it skin me alive down here than miss it on that day amen and the Bible says the spirit minds the word in other words if the spirit and you is the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ amen then that spirit in you is gonna mine the word just like he minded the word amen because remember church this bride of Jesus Christ is a reflection of him upon the earth right now amen she is just like him in every point amen and he's got full confidence in his bride amen that the bride is going to mine the word that's why Jesus said that that I do nothing but what the father shows me amen and everything he did was according to the word amen this bride is going to be according to the word she's gonna walk in step of the composer in this hour according to the Word of God when the Word of God says move she's going to move when the Word of God said stop she's going to stop when the Word of God said speak she's gonna speak amen the way the Word of God says be silent she's going to be silent she's gonna be just 100% and harmony let's say harmony tonight in harmony with the Word of God that's why it says in first gen in Chapter John John 1 in the beginning was the word of the Word was with God in the word was gone amen so that little word became a living reality amen it's one thing to have the groom as the living reality one thing to have Christ as our living reality but now he wants his bride to be that living reality amen that that bride will manifest Jesus Christ I was like the quote in the church his book that the bride has thus sayeth the Lord in her right now but she stands still until she knows what he wants done with it he meant so the bride is never going to be moving ahead of the groom but the bride is going to be walking in step with the crew amen in order that Christ can be manifested in the way he wants to be in each one of our lives because the Spirit that's living within us Minds the Word of God amen because the Spirit gives the word life the letter kills but the Spirit gives it life amen now I really believe in The Libertines and the Church of the Living God you know brother Branham said some things about Canada that then you know you want to just kind of closure he said they were mas packed I made a determination how I'm gonna be moss backed I don't care what any other people saying I believe the Spirit of God should be moving amen no some people say these words and they say well you shouldn't jump any higher than then then you live I've heard that all my life I grew up on the message in 1966 I was five years old my mum my dad cubies came to the church message the first time all I know is this message Amen I heard that chord so many times that you that you got to memorize but I cata why don't we start living higher so we can keep jumping higher Amen people are so afraid that things are going to get out of out of hand in the church I say I'm not afraid of anything getting out of hand amen but people say well we just wanna we just want to feed on the word but you know when you feed the ox or you feed a calf something in a stall and you feed him or something good nutrition you put him outside he's gonna kick up his heels and he's gonna run around and he's gonna have a great old time why there's some vitamins in him doing it I'm afraid too many calves are actually being served to death in this hour there's nothing in him to actually respond to the word Amen that's the truth church amen we should have such a desire to respond back when we see we on he's gonna tell me one more time I should say Amen I'm not gonna say it and you know what you just lost your blessing amen I'm at home came three days I can't even say it was sixteen hours any more is more like 40 hours to get here we we have to we need to allow brother Brown sitters maybe the church needs to get on a word on one time everybody gets saved Amen so that so that the people actually have Christ come into their lives amen puts a smile in everybody's face as much possible amen we still sing a song smiling I'll give your face or rastenn [Applause] takes less muscles to smile than from you know that's for free tonight eaten maybe I should just keep looking down here you know it's just the truth Church hey I hope you still love me when we're done here tonight amen but we need to express ourselves I know you hear these things but I just feel that the same again Amen we need to express ourselves we need to to allow Christ to move amen because just our attitude sometimes our spirit can actually hinder somebody from getting healed amen and so if we come to the house of God we should come in such an in such a manner where we're we're prayed up we have an expectation amen and then when we sit in the house of the Lord we're praying Lord meet my need but father meet the people's needs amen and I never want to be a stumbling block between before any person Amen but I want to be able to to have such an attitude in the house of God that if it's not for me that night it's for somebody else on name Amen that they wouldn't receive their blessing and that I would be hindered that blessing but I love my life to be a conduit that the Holy Ghost can come on the scene and move through hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord a minister see it's just yielding yourself to him it's not hard to do it's the sacrifice amen I believe that we need Libertines amen I also believe that that we can jump and shout but if there's no life to go with it and there's no point I say let's get the life giver in the heart amen let's have church amen this is the age where we need a personal experience with Jesus Christ amen we need something that that seals us to the D ever destination something that that's got everything put in its order I believe it all my heart amen I believe the church is moving up in that power amen where Christ means is our everything I'm it's not just on Sunday morning or Sunday night or or Saturday night amen but it's Monday morning it's Monday night it's Tuesday morning it's Tuesday night amen it makes you love your husband more properly it makes you love your your wife in the right way ain't mentor puts a unity in the home that the children can actually see Christ moving amongst the parents amen it causes an atmosphere to transpire amen where you don't have to pray up in the vehicle refer you come into church amen but there's already something that's already transpiring because it's already happening in the home amen but we sometimes we I don't know why I'm here but I'm here sometimes we fight like cats and dogs and then we expect God to move that's not how he moves the devil's not sleeping he knows how to push our buttons amen that was another one for free I don't know why I said that but I said I came alone choosing over bride now you see you're putting on something that isn't real you can't get warm by a painted fire like some of those churches trying to paint Pentecost you know I'll finish this quote me Oh sister Maura likes those those I'm sorry but over there honey she likes those electric fireplace things that you hang on a wall that looked like it reflect like it's a fireplace and they're even moving though it's not even just painted anymore they make the thing look I guess real I can't stand them have to be honest with you I I said she said oh there's not look nice as and I guess in the eyes of the beholder is there but to me it's the fakest thing you've ever saw I said why do i why do I want to have something I put on the wall that you plug into electrical outlet and oh my that's a real nice fire it's not a fire amen it's just it's a it's something that's not real amen and that's what brother Brown is saying some churches try to paint penny cause later they've got a painted fire amen are they they come in and they say they're all men it's just right they say everything just right and and and and at the end of the service it's just paints is this there's nothing about Amen we we don't want no painted fire Amen we want the real fire I am and I say Lord for ain't out on the people amen let your spirit fall on the people hallelujah let it fall he see you can't get warmed by paint a fire and I'll say this you're never gonna get the Holy Ghost by painting a fire either Amen too much painted fires in the pulpit ain't been oral they're only portraying something they don't even believe themselves amen they they preach about something they don't have any clue what they're talking about they just got an ability to search on a computer Amen I say they don't make them preachers because they got a computer Amen you got to have an experience with God Amen something that's it that's in your heart Amen how can you after 40 years say there's nothing to the message and preaching all your life I say that's absolutely impossible there was nothing in their life to begin with a man there just had a peanut fire experience Amen but when there's a real fire of Almighty God and he comes down on the scene Amen it changes lives that's why the church is so lukewarm that's why the church can move on in power amen because they're just painting the fire that's one reason why I can't handle them I just can't stand on my I told sister Mar would never put one of those in our house we're not doing that I want something that's real it's like plastic plants and I know we autumn - you guys got home - I can't hardly handle plastic town plants there's nothing to them you don't have to do nothing looks the same every service that's like some people they don't change at all every service they still look like a plastic plant there's nothing about in their heart that change Amen they're just a piece of plastic amen when the Holy Ghost should be raining down in this hour and changing lives aim hallelujah amen work we should be done with all the facades and all of that stuff that's not real amen people come in a house of the Lord and it's not real in their heart I say they need another good old-fashioned gospel burning down at the altar where Christ comes into their lives and changes our hearts hallelujah that's enough paint amen that's why they call that manicure brother Brown called it manicure they got to paint himself up it's not real aim it just looked the same all the time no change amen we need to change from glory to glory amen he's changing us every service I mean like I said in the beginning we may not think we're changing but if we're really eating this word a menace to it's changing us a mint from glory to glory we may not see it on the outside but something's happen on the inside and eventually it's gonna be portrayed on the outside that's when Christ gets into our lives a minute it changes us so we can dress right we can do everything right but if in our hearts we're still wanted to be like the world then we're just being Apia this basically right over here something that's not real amen we're just being a Pharisee amen but when Christ comes in the inside hallelujah amen it gives you love it gives you joy it gives you peace it gives you long-suffering it portrays Christ not a painted fire something real brother Branham says here he said he said like some of these churches trying to paint Pentecost and he's not speaking of of organization he speaking of 2000 years ago or something that happened a thousand two thousand you can't get warm by paying a fire penny cost let's say Pentecost hope it's okay if a guy uses that word here some churches that's not because they think their their mind always goes organization amen but penny costs its really to believe amen it's it's you can go free you're no longer bound to sin you're no longer bound to the world you're no longer bound to anything like that you can go free you Christ I think that's why the devil trying to hoodwink to people Pentecost is just as real today as it was then see he says the fire won't like that the fire is still falling amen he's fallen here tonight too and in a pan of fire it's a real fire a man I believe that so we have some real fire watching his star lady 59 he said me I say tonight that God has assigned today it's a sign of his spirit that word Jesus is there's life for his life where Jesus is there's gospel light for he is the lane where Jesus is oh this is good there's fire Amen for he is a consuming fire that burns up all your unbelief and your dross hey man I say Lord let's burn up some unbelief amen let's burn up some dross amen 19:49 see brother Brown believe this all of his life he said the other night where we were sitting thousands deep in there there was a big mess of a big convention and all of them clapping their hands and praising God we just had such a glorious time we had fire right on the altar then oh my I read that I thought I thought just done something for me amen people want to sit on their hands and they don't want to respond to the Word of God amen yeah they're just not allowing the fire of God to move on the scene amen preach on brother Kelly I'm gonna to go - to that - amen yeah probably you've heard this quote a lot of times but I'm gonna read it again it's the rising of the Sun there's been churches churches and brides brides and churches and Brides prize but there has got to come one amen brother Branham says hallelujah amen so it meant something to him amen because he knew there was going to come a church I was going to have full victory hema not just a partial victory amen but full victory aim in a church that would rise up in power amen why because the power of the Resurrection is in her amen if she had rise in power amen in an illumination to the things of the Lord amen and there would be nothing let's say nothing tonight there would be nothing that would stand in her way not one devil in hell can stand in front of the pride of Jesus Christ she has got full authority over the power of darkness hallelujah you know sometimes you people wonder well what about the devil I said what about him what about him well people are getting sick well brother Brown says he says that's no problem he says just call the elders of the church and cast the devil off amen and I always look at if you ever gonna have testimonies there's gonna be some people that are good that are gonna get sick amen I'm a living witness of that even I was sick for a lot of years I still struggle with my my health but all I want to say tonight at 58 years old I feel stronger than I felt for many years amen and I can tell you that Christ is a healer he's a savior amen he helps in all aspects of but if you never got sick there'd be no testimonies so God has confidence we don't understand it we didn't understand it when our son-in-law passed away but God had a plan amen and he makes everything beautiful in his own time amen sometimes we we see things happen in our lives and we think well it's only for the next person but sometimes it gets personal to us amen and what's God trying to do he's got confidence in you because he knows you're gonna stand the test who quarry to God amen and you're gonna stand the test and you're gonna be a serpent bruiser because no devil should stand in her way hallelujah somebody say praise the Lord he said there's got to come a real bride I believe that hallelujah there's part of it right down here in the Shenandoah Valley amen is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been brother Ron is here in the Shenandoah Valley sister Mara myself we talk all the time he said there's no place like this place Amen we take them to our dump up in northern Canada called elk roots and things like that but it's a nice place too but Shantanu a valley is beautiful Eamon I wondered how come the Lord put me there and you here too and wonder that sometimes but here we are you're here and I'm up there amen but we're supposed to be amen but there's gonna come a real bride a man I'm part of that Amen we're collectively all part of that Brian Amy but we're not going anywhere until we're all ready to go whether it's in Saskatoon or whether it's in Africa or Asia wherever it is amen when we're all ready to go we're all gonna go there's gonna come a real bride there must come one that's not got the mechanics I like that but the dynamics of it makes that church live moving the power of his resurrection until we come to a play to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs and good does it do give her a facelift or or a Simon izing job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there has got to be dynamics to make it work amen I could sit in that car all day long on my grandfather's house it didn't go anywhere I could polish that hood until there was no paint left on that hood his someone going any worse further down he says until that church becomes dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the same thing he did if he if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the brine amen for he said in Saint John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics hallelujah this is your power Amen what we need is a charge from the unction from the Holy One I say send it down Lord and give a good charge right now amen give a charge to the people right now hallelujah glory to God give the charge of the dynamics into the mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and erase him up again in the last days aim in other words will be a manifestation of him that's the Easter message the dynamics of mechanics together the mechanics are those two dynamics no good neither the dynamics to those of mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny is word or do you good you're just cranking around on the Pistons got to get the spark that a fire no gasoline to fire it it'll only work as they come together amen so one will sit still and one will go up that's the only thing there is that there is to it yet excuse me it will move into them and I just forgot I lost my spot here that's the resurrection that's the real power of God Mike in mechanics with dynamics it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas amen we some spark amen fire what's in our hearts amen you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things amen let's say all things tonight Amen with Christ you can do all things even those are just words that's the reality that's the truth as a father has fired me and pushed me into everything I do only that which is pleasing to God now as he sent me so send I you with the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs that say these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics that dynamics will take its place Paul said the gospel came not to us and word only in other words through gasoline-only Amen so we need the word we need the spirit amen the letter kills but the Spirit is gonna give a life amen and when the Spirit gives a life something's gonna happen amen when he says we were just gonna move amen victory day I cannot just a few more moments of that would be okay he said now we ascended on high and he give gifts back to men what was it sores he put swords in their hand the word c2 clunker oh my he give them sores what for the word to conquer what sicknesses sins superstitions evil to bring every living creature that wants to live bring every one of them to the realization that because I live you live also we have the faith we have the fight of faith let us fight amen complete our victory for our complete victory is positive amen let's say positive to name say it one more time positive that means there's no negative Amen if it's positive all the time Amen then we're positive all the time amen glory to God hey man I I don't like being negative if I am sister Marta has to deal with me and that she tells me you supposed to be positive it's preach the other night you supposed to be positive amen thank the good Lord for sister Myra amen why because we should it be negative negative cause uh causes dome Amen doubt takes us away from the word Amy butter for positive it moves us into the word Amen that it just takes a little unction from the Holy One to make that word come alive he says here he says complete victory is positive it's sure it's got to be Amen we have the firstfruits of it we have the evidence of it in our heart now because we have already got the first battle behind us we have been able to conquer through the faith I love that through the faith of Jesus Christ we had a victory day amen god knows what concerns each one of us today no matter what it would be he knows what your burdens are he knows what your fear is amen he knows what your health condition is amen he knows what your financial situation is amen he knows every part about our lives he knows her uprising he knows our down settings amen but he chose us for a reason amen he chose us because he loved us amen and if he loved us then he's going to supply everything we have need up for this life's journey amen he's going to give us some mechanics he's gonna give us dynamics amen he's gonna give us a positive outlook amen he's gonna give us his spirit you know III was speaking back home a few weeks ago and in Exodus the pillar of fire was with the children of Israel every day cloud was with them daytime pillar of fire by night they saw in every single day got common to him though they could get out of their tent in the morning they could look in the beginning I bet you they'd done it crawl Oh is he still there yeah he's still there but after a year or so all of a sudden they were looking anymore they just they just say and and I I think Laura do you you know all about my situations in life and you know as long as were in this life we're gonna have problems we're always gonna have there's gonna be something happening sometimes people say I had a brother tell me this the other days I don't know what's happened to us my wife just got sick and why us we live we live good lives we live a good Christian lives and why is it happening to us and and I was sitting back there and I was trying to help the brother in a certain way because it's it's if something comes your way is because you found favor with God amen we we look at it sometimes in such a negative way instead of a positive way when we should be looking at it if God has something for me that means he's going to give me the strength to come through it amen he wants to see how I'm going to react to it how you're going to react to it amen and as long as there's a devil he's going to create problems amen but I say that greater is He that's in me that he that's in the world amen greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world that's why brother rose what do we have to fear then a menu could be you could be perfect health and be sick you may did not even know you're sick and you get a doctor's report in the doctor report oh my this is looking pretty bad right here oh my goodness look at this report and that's when our hearts have to go well Lord you promised me amen then I should be in good health and so Lord I'm gonna take this promise and tuck it in my script peg I'm gonna let gonna chew on this scripture every day and thank you for my healing amen if you're depressed and and you don't know what to do with yourself you it seems like you just can't seemingly pull out of it you gotta just put it on there that Lord you promised me to have a sound mind amen I'm gonna tell you church you're going to get a sound mind amen it's not mind over matter what you're doing is repeating back his word to him and his word can never fail his word is yeah amen his word will never fail Amen it has never failed one time in this generation it will never fail his word is true amen it'll never fail I can't feel he knows what concerns us sometimes you just may be trying to show us something sometimes we we don't look deep enough always like what David said Lord you look into my own heart Lord I don't trust my own evaluation in my own heart and because we we evaluate ourselves a certain way but God maybe value it's a different way amen and it doesn't mean I I have a brush on sometimes people at home they hear certain things and they think oh like I'm never gonna be able to live a Christian life I say you know why do we want to thank those things amen if he saved me then he's gonna keep me if he saved you he's gonna keep you he didn't save you to lose you a man he saved you to keep you but he's gonna try our faith I'm gonna say we're gonna come out like like gold that's shining in in its brilliance amen there's been this uh message on love he said to think that perfect love casts out all fear a minute does church Eamon you're not scared about nothing oh Jesus help us you're just resting you're not oh I'm a backslide tomorrow I'm a backslide next week I wouldn't worry about that amen somebody say praise the Lord he said I'm not trying to hold on he held on for me and he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him holding me not me holding him if it was me holding him I'd probably turn loose glory but as long as he's holding me we will never turn loose he promised he would and I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen amen he's the one that's holding on a many snatcher gonna turn loose he's holding on what gives me this victory is Christ he's the one that gives me this victory Amen he's the victorious one amen he conquered death hell and the grave Amen every demon power was conquered when he said it is finished it was finished it's still finished today amen we're studying the church age book at Holman and we're just on this one part and and and I've just felt to share it with you because it's to me it's so beautiful is that that he chose you for his bride he chose me for his bride amen he says here he said now without getting too involved in the subject to the sovereignty of God let me point out here that according to this verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride hey man I feel so good about that amen because I chose myself a me but he chose me he chose you a man if that doesn't make you excited I don't know what's gonna make you excited Amen when the King of Kings came and chose you hey man it's brother Brown preached in the door on the door he said if you heard a knock on the door and it was a queen of England standing there you'd feel so you'd wonder why why my host why would she come to my house man you'd open up the door you probably tidy or maybe a bit first but you'd open up the door let her get in you put her down you'd make her tea you do something and then brother Brahim said what if the President of the United States would knock on your door even if you don't like him you think my this is an honor why would he come to my place amen but to think Church from the king of kings hallelujah when the King of Kings came by your way a man he said I'm gonna choose you to be my bride a man he chose you for a purpose even he said I'm gonna put you in my bride Oh Lord whoo and I think about that I got already know what to do with myself hey man you feel like jumping you feel like shouting hey man you feel like being a little Pentecostal hey man you you just you just something Wells up in your heart I want a system are she would marry me I'll tell you what her hurt jumped a few beats to oh yeah did I remember that time but to think of the King of Kings hey man he said I'm choosing you hey man look at your neighbor to say he chose you hey man he chose you to be in the brine amen he chose you you said me yeah you well I'm nothing but he chose you I don't deserve it but he chose you amen why because he wants to show his victory for your life amen he wants to show himself through your life and he said I'm gonna come right down here show - I adore Valley and choose you who Corey - God Alleluia makes you wanna walk a little lighter because he chose me in this house to be part of that bride he was going to choose someone but he chose you chose you to be part of the bride brother Bram said just like a man I think it's still in style today I know some place maybe maybe it's a women that are trying to choose who they're gonna marry from that standpoint they call them the guys up but I think it's still in style that a husband or a man calls you understand what I'm saying with social media today we've kind of put these little feelers okay with her but brother Branham says here he said Jesus Christ choosing his own bride just the same as a man chooses their bride today the bride today's does not simply decide she is going to take us her mana for husband no sir it is the groom let's say the groom the groom who decides and chooses her woman for his bride Saint John 1560 you have not chosen me but I've chosen you amen so in the devil tells you you're not worthy you can tell him that's right but he chose me anyhow hey man sometimes we don't feel worthy ain't me buddy chose you anyhow amen I don't feel worthy but he chose me anyhow Amen it's his chooses of my choosing it's not the preacher's choosing it says choosing hallelujah that should settle in our heart he chose me to be part of his bride glory to God o Lord he said now according to the Word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself a man Ephesian 1:9 and in Romans nine eleven it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you cannot read it any other way the heart purpose the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and be an eternal he decreed before the foundation of the world hallelujah hey man we were in him way over here in his thoughts before God was even God when you see when he was the eternal one brother Branham says before there was ever one speck of Stardust before God was God amen you were already in his mind hey man the one we could say when he was on the cross I was on his mind that's personal I was on his mind amen he came to redeem us amen he came to choose us amen he provided everything we have need up for this journey Church glory to God before there was one speck of Stardust before God was even God he was just the eternal spirit that filled all space and time a man he had to create in order that something could worship him before he could be God amen but before even that transpired we were already in his mind in the Eternals glory to God hey man that's why brother Bram says that God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world amen and put it into the file of predestination knowing exactly what our you would be born in knowing exactly what day you'd be worn Amen knowing exactly how much you would win how long you would be and what color your hair would be in your eyes he already knew all about you hey men he watched over you through generations of people hey man great-grandfather's had brought you to earth for one purpose to choose you hey men let's say he chose me pull your finger he chose me he chose me to be part of the bride amen he coulda chose somebody else on the road but he chose me amen glory to God hallelujah so he was only that time potential God and he and he was known only as Eternal Spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are eternal are they not a menace no wonder Jesus could say that no man can pluck them from my hand oh when you're in the hand of him who's gonna pull you out don't worry to God somebody say praise the Lord I watched a documentary not long ago and it's interesting because it was the anniversary of Apollo 11 he probably heard about Apollo 11 I remember when I was in grade school man made and of course rockets and things like that when you're just a 5 6 7 8 10 year-old boy I mean they intrigued you and they were talking about Apollo 11 and landing on the moon and all that kind of thing but I watched the documentary and Neil Armstrong y'all probably know who Neil Armstrong is amen and he was they say he was one of the man the first man to put his foot on the moon but I watched it and in I was just so intrigued by it I know I used this example someplace on somebody said well they never went on the moon oh it's all fictitious then what's up to you what you all want to believe but but I said they said he was on the moon so I'm just gonna believe it and then so I watched his life that guy was consumed he was consumed with the moon he had books that would plaster this whole thing full of books that guy study day and night there's nothing that distracted him from his objective to put his foot on the moon no it's not my objective but it was his objective I got a better objection what he all had you do to amen and so he studied and he saw lots of his family and or excuse me his friends and different ones that that they would go up and certain rockets that even he was supposed to go up in and and of course they had disastrous endings but a didn't eatery it's no wonder the the psalmist said fill a thousand Falls at one handed ten thousand falls on the other hand it's not gonna come nigh on to me Amen why because we're in the beloved and he would have just look at night look at the moon hey you so entreat how do rowboat yourself I like to I like to look at night the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it is safe finally palm 11 they didn't know what was gonna happen because of Paulo 10 blew up he gets into that rocket his wife says well are you gonna talk to your kids before he got in and and tell him he didn't want to talk to his kids well what if you don't come back you know you want to talk about not coming back cuz in his mind I'm going to the moon and I'm gonna come back to earth so he gets an Apollo 11 and he takes off it gets up there and have all their their different problems whatever they had but finally that little thing comes off and no he's dropping onto the moon and the excitement that was in his heart hoping where I'm going Church the excitement was in his heart that was in his heart it was you could just feel it he open up that door suited himself up open up that door he started to descend and started walking real slow real slow real slow and he stood on the last rung and he just looked at it that's the moon I can still see it he put his foot down picked it up he looked at it first man put his foot on the moon and then the interesting part of it is that he looked back at earth cuz when what perspective he was looking at the moon but now he's looking back there his family and his still on earth so what good is it doing him on the boot that's why I'm not gonna let one good leg behind I'm gonna take as much with me as I can take with me amen because I'm not going to the moon I've gone going in the rapture Amen I've got a body change to take amen and my passion is to take that body change amen when he promised me complete victory I believe complete victory amen when he promised me full power I believe full power amen when he promised me that I'm gonna pass the moon without in Iraq I feel I'm gonna pass the moon without any rocket feel when he promised me I haven't overcome earth I am an overcomer right now he was so thrilled to get on the moon I thought nah his whole life he worked to get on the moon but at the end of it all he was was on the moon I want to give my whole life for Christ I trust you want to give you a whole life for Christ amen brother branham I want to say that he had a passion and his passion was fulfilled but I trust tonight that you have a passion amen that you're not just gonna settle for for something just mediocre or something just a little bit of knowledge or something just to say a few nice words but a passion to be like Christ a passion that Christ would live through your lives amen if I could leave you with anything tonight I'd want to leave you tonight with that I have full victory amen and if I don't help full victory I'm moving toward full victory amen no matter what's gonna stand in my way I've got the fortitude of Christ living in my heart that nothing let's say nothing nothing's gonna stand in my way if this person's are going I'm so gonna go if that person drops off I'm still going you've got to be determined within your heart I am not letting off when the devil says you're not going to make it I say devil you're going to your destination and I've got my eyes on the rapture I've got the eyes of the Resurrection my promise is a rapture my promise is a resurrection and I'm not letting off but you have to have that passion to serve Him with all that's within your heart just two more minutes here brother Branham said that when he went beyond the curtain of time if it's okay just a couple more minutes beyond the curtain of time there was a voice that said you're just starting keep pressing the battle hey man if you only knew what was at the end of the road and what did brother Branham experience young man and the brilliance of young manhood young women with her hair hanging down their waist he said their eyes were glittering like a star on a darkened night their teeth as white as pearl if you only knew what was that the end of the road Neil Armstrong he got his wish he got on to the moon hey man I thought you know he he was so passionate about it but my passion your passion is to have that young brilliance of manhood Amen teeth as white as snow and it's not gonna be caused from pearl white neither but your teeth white your eyes like the stars in a darkened night that's the promise he's given to us in this end time so don't let off Church put the pedal to the metal as it were keep pressing on keep press and all the musicians would come forward at this time just keep
