[45:58] stories and
[45:59] amen

[46:18] got a lot of nice text after the service
[46:20] last night thank you guys for that
[46:22] from a lot of different places and
[46:25] i was just nuts and bolts preaching
[46:27] we're going to be part of the this
[46:29] this great orchestra and god's getting
[46:31] us ready and we're going to go through
[46:32] some things to get there
[46:35] and uh
[46:37] and so we're just we're just thankful
[46:39] for this
[46:41] before reading this i just want to share
[46:43] this thought
[46:49] i cannot imagine the responsibility
[46:55] of paul
[46:57] with a few sentences
[47:00] telling life stories
[47:03] of these people
[47:06] they were born in the rhythm
[47:09] of the music
[47:11] and regardless of the backdrop of their
[47:13] lives
[47:14] they overcome
[47:18] paul didn't get to call our names
[47:21] but our names are written here
[47:24] i want to read it again for you hebrews
[47:26] 11 33
[47:29] who through faith
[47:32] subdued kingdoms
[47:34] wrought righteousness
[47:36] obtained promises
[47:38] stop the mouths of lions
[47:41] quench the violence of fire
[47:43] escape the edge of the sword and out of
[47:46] weaknesses
[47:48] were made strong
[47:49] wax valiant in flight
[47:51] turned to flight the armies of the
[47:53] aliens
[47:55] women received their dead raised to life
[47:58] again
[47:59] others
[48:01] were tortured
[48:02] not accepting deliverance
[48:05] that they might obtain a better
[48:07] resurrection
[48:09] thinking in there
[48:12] to come after this writing
[48:15] 68 million christians give their life
[48:19] for the cause of jesus christ
[48:22] due to rome
[48:24] others had trial of cruel
[48:27] mockings
[48:29] scourgings
[48:30] yea moreover the bond of imprisonments
[48:34] they were stoned
[48:36] they were sown asunder
[48:38] were tempted
[48:40] were slain with the sword
[48:42] wondered about in sheepskins and in goat
[48:45] skins being destitute afflicted
[48:48] tormented
[48:49] of whom the world was not worthy they
[48:52] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[48:55] dens and caves of the earth
[48:57] and these all
[48:59] haven't obtained a good report through
[49:02] faith received not the promise
[49:05] god having provided some better thing
[49:08] for us
[49:09] that they without us
[49:12] should not be made perfect
[49:14] chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore see and we
[49:18] are compassed about with so great a
[49:20] cloud of witnesses
[49:22] let us lay aside every weight and the
[49:25] sin which does so easily beset us
[49:28] and let us run with patience the race
[49:30] that is set before us and here is the
[49:34] whole
[49:35] is the whole thing
[49:36] looking unto jesus
[49:38] the author and the finisher of our faith
[49:41] who for the joy was set before him
[49:44] endured the cross despising the shame
[49:47] that is set down at the right hand of
[49:49] the throne of god
[49:51] may the lord bless the reading of his
[49:52] word this morning you may be seated
[50:01] brother branham is speaking in shalom
[50:04] and he's talking about symphony
[50:08] he says now to you adults
[50:10] the scripture
[50:12] is god's symphony
[50:15] he said only the composer knows what it
[50:18] really means
[50:20] and he reveals it to those who are
[50:23] listening i want to be one of those
[50:25] don't you
[50:26] who are interested in knowing what the
[50:29] drama is
[50:31] but you'd have to know about the
[50:33] symphony first
[50:34] it's not just
[50:36] something that you see
[50:38] it's the changing the junctions of the
[50:41] word
[50:43] of the music
[50:45] it throws sometimes it's going to go
[50:47] this way for a while a certain beat
[50:50] after a while it changes all around what
[50:52] is it to you that who wouldn't
[50:54] understand it or don't know nothing
[50:56] about it
[50:57] and not interested in it it's just a
[50:59] racket
[51:00] it's a fuss
[51:02] but to those who know about it they're
[51:05] watching for it
[51:06] they know it's coming
[51:08] hallelujah that's where we're at we we
[51:11] know it's coming
[51:12] so we have these times of symphonies of
[51:16] the symphony of god's word that the
[51:19] whole drama changes and you who are
[51:22] interested listen for that change you
[51:24] know it's getting close you hear the way
[51:27] the drums are obedient
[51:29] amen
[51:30] want something to happen you know this
[51:33] is a change see it's going to break into
[51:36] a burst in a few moments and he said and
[51:38] you're watching for that you can tell
[51:41] that the way the drums are timing
[51:44] brother brahm did believe in drums
[51:50] oh god if you can hear the drums
[51:53] of the finish
[51:55] now if you can hear the echo of the
[51:57] music of the heavenly word
[52:00] singing itself out
[52:03] and it shall come to pass in the last
[52:05] days the symphony of god's great drama
[52:08] that he's playing it changes him the
[52:11] symphony at the junction the composer
[52:14] and those who are interested listen for
[52:16] that change and that's what all of this
[52:19] stuff is to us
[52:21] we're listening we're watching
[52:24] and i think about when i read this quote
[52:27] many people that were sitting there
[52:30] just allowed this to just kind of go
[52:32] right over their heads
[52:36] they missed the whole thing
[52:38] they really wasn't interested in the
[52:40] word they were interested in the gift
[52:44] maybe the interested in the personality
[52:46] of the man but there was a voice that
[52:48] was behind the voice
[52:52] we have been gathered to a message
[52:55] come out of her my people and be not a
[52:58] partaker with the plagues
[53:00] don't be caught up with those
[53:02] blasphemous names and the creeds and
[53:04] dogmas but we've been gathered to a
[53:07] message
[53:10] and we're just have to be honest with
[53:12] you we're interested in it
[53:16] it's what my life's goal has been
[53:18] i'm interested in this message
[53:26] every time you appears something happens
[53:29] we see the time getting close
[53:32] we see back yonder long again ago when
[53:34] the church ages was all darked out
[53:38] he said we were listening
[53:40] we sing the one right when the with the
[53:43] word the beating with the word and after
[53:45] a while what happened here he come
[53:47] himself and vindicated
[53:49] we heard the word say so
[53:51] in the days of the sabbath angel the
[53:54] church ages he said the seventh angel's
[53:57] message would be the last message
[54:02] and all we find out over here in
[54:04] revelations 10
[54:06] in the in the days of the message of the
[54:09] sabbath angel the mystery of god should
[54:12] be finished
[54:15] and they are
[54:18] we're not looking for another messenger
[54:21] we're not looking for another great man
[54:24] are you with me and the seventh seal
[54:27] would be pulled back it should be there
[54:29] then all at once when it's happening a
[54:32] vision broke go to tucson a great noise
[54:36] will take place at this time
[54:38] and you'll be thoroughly understand and
[54:41] know that it's sent
[54:44] brother branham has taken these
[54:46] junctions of his life
[54:51] and showing us
[54:52] revelations 10 1
[54:55] revelations 10 7
[54:57] luke 17 30.
[55:00] malachi 4 5-6
[55:02] these scriptures are happening
[55:06] and let me just say never let that
[55:08] become redundant to you
[55:10] never let that become common to you
[55:13] centuries has waited on this to happen
[55:19] because we had to have a messenger
[55:22] that would get a gentile bride ready
[55:27] we had had the bible for 2 000 years
[55:30] at least in the form that we have now at
[55:33] least since about martin luther and
[55:36] zwingli and some of those men that began
[55:38] to get the met the bible together but
[55:41] listen we had the bible what what did it
[55:44] produce
[55:45] over 40 000 denominations
[55:48] we needed a messenger
[55:52] are you with me not one that was going
[55:54] to boast of himself
[55:56] but
[55:57] we needed a messenger
[55:59] that could stand in this day
[56:02] and declare the word of god without
[56:05] guests
[56:09] without guests
[56:11] he was a seer prophet
[56:14] he was like an old testament prophet
[56:17] that could see all the way back even
[56:20] before the beginning
[56:22] when he talks about adam and eve and her
[56:25] blonde hair
[56:26] and and his right shoulders and god
[56:30] sending them out of the garden and then
[56:33] he calls them back and he takes
[56:35] lambskins and wraps it around it
[56:41] that was a messenger with vision form to
[56:44] be able to stand in a pulpit and watch
[56:47] it happen
[56:48] he wasn't guessing at it he was watching
[56:50] it happen
[56:54] but listen he wasn't just talking about
[56:56] adam and eve he's talking about you too
[57:02] he watches melchizedek
[57:04] with with abraham
[57:06] he watches abraham and jehovah jireh
[57:09] take his son upon a hill
[57:12] and and he said god will provide himself
[57:16] a lamb
[57:19] he would scream to us
[57:21] as the changes would be coming
[57:23] stay with me as i lay my foundation this
[57:25] morning
[57:26] change is coming just throw it to it and
[57:29] he would remind us even as believers
[57:32] don't miss it
[57:35] why would he tell us don't miss it
[57:37] because the cares of this life
[57:43] will
[57:44] delude it
[57:46] misdirect you
[57:48] cause you to go in different directions
[57:50] but keep your focus on the word
[57:54] it would be just like eloheeser
[57:57] that would would pick would the angel
[57:59] would give rebecca the revelation drop
[58:02] it in her heart
[58:04] i'll go with the man
[58:06] i'll go with this message
[58:10] and she waters the camels that she rides
[58:12] on
[58:13] but ellie heezer
[58:16] she was not to fall in love with eleazar
[58:22] was giving her secrets about what isaac
[58:26] was like
[58:28] brother branham did not want us falling
[58:30] in love with wink and branham
[58:32] oh it's sure to good to fall in love
[58:35] with him but his purpose was to get you
[58:38] to fall in love with the lord jesus
[58:41] christ
[58:43] he constantly told us i'm not your
[58:46] healer
[58:49] i'm not your savior
[58:51] i'm not your deliverer i needed i needed
[58:55] saving i needed healing
[59:01] as people we quickly fall in love with
[59:03] humanity
[59:05] and if you're not careful you'll fall in
[59:07] love with temporary flesh that is going
[59:09] to die and go back to the ground but god
[59:12] the mighty angel came to oversee this
[59:16] message
[59:17] and listen that angel did not leave the
[59:19] earth
[59:22] when the messenger left the earth he is
[59:25] among us even now
[59:29] i'd like to say this to you we have
[59:31] lived long enough
[59:32] to see this message in every corner of
[59:35] the earth
[59:37] [Music]
[59:43] so i would say this to us be ready
[59:50] be ready
[59:52] let's play our part
[59:56] brother man would say these statements
[59:57] he said that's the way that you do god
[1:00:02] he said you don't stand off and look at
[1:00:04] it
[1:00:05] you get into the rhythm of it
[1:00:08] how do you get in there you're born into
[1:00:10] it
[1:00:10] into the rhythm of the word
[1:00:13] when you become part of the word
[1:00:16] you had to become part of the dance
[1:00:19] to get to the dance you have to become
[1:00:21] part of the ball game
[1:00:24] something that you're interested in to
[1:00:26] get into the ball game brother brown
[1:00:28] would say later in another sermon
[1:00:30] getting in the spirit
[1:00:34] getting in the spirit a lot of people
[1:00:36] pray but they really don't pray a lot of
[1:00:38] people read the bible but they really
[1:00:40] don't read the bible a lot of people
[1:00:42] worship but they really don't worship
[1:00:45] you got to get in the spirit of it
[1:00:48] hallelujah that's what we come this
[1:00:51] morning for not to just do another
[1:00:54] service we come to get in the spirit
[1:00:58] this is my part i'm going to play my
[1:01:01] part
[1:01:13] now this is a very important
[1:01:15] quote
[1:01:16] i know i'm laying some heavy stuff for
[1:01:18] you but you just hang right here
[1:01:20] he said you have to become part of the
[1:01:22] word
[1:01:24] to know god's symphony
[1:01:27] you cannot become part of the word
[1:01:31] if you don't eat it
[1:01:37] i'm just going to be honest with you
[1:01:39] if tapes are never played in your home
[1:01:43] if it can be said about your house
[1:01:46] that the voice of the prophet is never
[1:01:48] there
[1:01:50] there's something wrong with your
[1:01:51] revelation
[1:01:57] young people play it in your bedrooms
[1:02:03] because you're part of the symphony
[1:02:05] there's a good chance that you're not
[1:02:07] going to live to be 50 years old
[1:02:10] this is your time
[1:02:12] this is your message
[1:02:17] listen listen i live this
[1:02:20] every day in our home growing up it
[1:02:23] didn't hurt me
[1:02:26] it didn't hurt me
[1:02:27] the strongest things that brother
[1:02:29] branham said
[1:02:31] it didn't hurt me
[1:02:35] oh brother ron i want my children to
[1:02:37] have a good time are you looking at the
[1:02:39] temporary are you looking at the pyramid
[1:02:41] eternal

[1:03:27] potential to release

[1:04:07] is
[1:04:09] that's satan's kingdom
[1:04:11] and at the end of the the programs or
[1:04:14] whatever you're it agitates you
[1:04:17] the reason it agitates you you're not
[1:04:19] from this world
[1:04:24] i'm gonna preach this is not your world
[1:04:29] this world is only gonna get worse
[1:04:32] your vote don't even count no more you
[1:04:34] might as well get it through your head
[1:04:40] but this is not our world
[1:04:46] this message is our world
[1:04:50] now notice this you're watching for it
[1:04:53] he said the works that i do
[1:04:55] shall you do also
[1:04:57] greater than this shall you do
[1:05:00] these last days the great changing of
[1:05:03] time
[1:05:04] we get into the beat the beat of the
[1:05:06] word find his purpose the hour that
[1:05:10] we're living
[1:05:11] it is useless
[1:05:15] to find luther's day
[1:05:18] it was a great revival
[1:05:20] it was a tremendous overcoming it was
[1:05:23] the writing of the bible and in the
[1:05:25] background of that luther had to live in
[1:05:28] persecution
[1:05:30] and literally had to be under a german
[1:05:32] king or they would have killed him
[1:05:36] the pressure that he was under as a
[1:05:39] messenger but there was a lot of flaws
[1:05:42] in his life
[1:05:44] are you with me now
[1:05:46] wesley
[1:05:48] what a great revival
[1:05:51] he was cast out of all of the churches
[1:05:54] but he stood there in the streets and in
[1:05:56] the fields
[1:05:58] one occasion
[1:05:59] 10
[1:06:00] 000 people
[1:06:02] slain in the spirit
[1:06:06] someone told me a while back said that
[1:06:08] god don't slay people in this spirit no
[1:06:10] more
[1:06:10] well you
[1:06:12] god don't change
[1:06:16] and john wesley this before azusa street
[1:06:20] john wesley is preaching to 10 000
[1:06:23] people and they all are slain in the
[1:06:25] spirit
[1:06:27] and he don't understand because the
[1:06:29] power of the message of that day of that
[1:06:32] orchestra was playing so strong and it
[1:06:35] had such a rhythm to it and the people
[1:06:37] were anointed to catch the word they
[1:06:39] were literally slain in the spirit and
[1:06:41] he tried to get them to set up and
[1:06:43] listen to the word
[1:06:48] i pray today
[1:06:50] the word has
[1:06:52] incredible effect on our lives
[1:06:56] remember when feni would preach
[1:06:59] feeney was a converted lawyer
[1:07:03] he was ashamed of receiving the holy
[1:07:05] ghost
[1:07:07] he was out praying for the holy ghost
[1:07:09] behind his
[1:07:10] office
[1:07:11] two women passed by and he stood up and
[1:07:14] he realized that i'm ashamed
[1:07:17] and he broke through the shame
[1:07:20] and he received the baptism of the holy
[1:07:22] ghost and when he began to preach
[1:07:29] he was not a pretty man
[1:07:32] as a matter of fact his
[1:07:34] he had a nasally voice
[1:07:37] it really shrieked when he spoke
[1:07:41] but he preached with such power
[1:07:44] until men
[1:07:45] would drop their lunch boxes
[1:07:49] five miles away
[1:07:51] and give their heart to jesus christ
[1:07:54] rochester new york became a place to
[1:07:58] where crime was so low
[1:08:02] until the police officers
[1:08:05] became the original
[1:08:07] barbershop quartets
[1:08:12] that's what the power of the gospel
[1:08:15] can do
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:19] brother ron i don't know about that
[1:08:21] we're going to a kingdom
[1:08:24] there'll be no police officers you'll be
[1:08:26] out of a job there'll be no police
[1:08:28] officers there there'll be no warriors
[1:08:30] there there'll be no funeral homes there
[1:08:34] there'll not be one hospital there no
[1:08:38] walmart's there
[1:08:40] just think about all the things that
[1:08:42] won't be there
[1:08:46] hallelujah
[1:08:48] there'll never be a fight or a brawl or
[1:08:50] a fuss
[1:08:57] we get so consumed in our time element
[1:09:01] everything's got to be right on time
[1:09:04] every everything has got to be just
[1:09:06] right on time and you know you just you
[1:09:08] know you're just so busy
[1:09:12] and that's what the devil will do he'll
[1:09:14] get you so busy
[1:09:23] he'll rob you
[1:09:25] he'll rob you of your time
[1:09:28] and sometimes it's over trivial things
[1:09:32] sometimes you'll give you a whole week
[1:09:34] of things to gossip about
[1:09:45] get it today get it tomorrow
[1:09:53] if the devil can just drop a little
[1:09:55] rumor
[1:10:00] and we can just drop a little rumor
[1:10:02] it'll consume your mind and your
[1:10:04] thoughts
[1:10:07] and your thoughts will be on all of this
[1:10:10] you guys are getting ready to go to
[1:10:12] college
[1:10:13] and so the devil will tell you yeah you
[1:10:16] ain't gonna be able to function away
[1:10:17] from home
[1:10:19] you're not gonna have your mom and daddy
[1:10:21] around you to watch over you and protect
[1:10:23] you and this is gonna be a whole lot
[1:10:24] different than than high school
[1:10:27] yeah
[1:10:32] well that's that's silly that's
[1:10:33] absolutely correct
[1:10:37] it's correct
[1:10:38] but you got a goal that you want to go
[1:10:40] through
[1:10:42] somewhere you want to be a teacher i
[1:10:45] think that's what both of you guys want
[1:10:47] to be so you got to go through the work
[1:10:49] to be a teacher
[1:10:51] so you got to get it i'm going to preach
[1:10:53] to you
[1:10:54] you got to get it in your mind i got to
[1:10:56] get through this i may not like it i may
[1:11:00] have some difficult times but i'm going
[1:11:02] to get through this
[1:11:06] i am committed to this if you're a nurse
[1:11:09] you're a doctor whatever you are in your
[1:11:11] life
[1:11:13] here's a guy that sits with a pre-med
[1:11:15] degree
[1:11:16] listen there was times he felt like
[1:11:18] quitting but let me just say this you he
[1:11:20] had to talk to himself over and over to
[1:11:23] get himself through did he make all
[1:11:25] these i'm sure he didn't
[1:11:30] he's in my family
[1:11:35] but to play your part
[1:11:40] now let's just suppose for a moment that
[1:11:44] your part in the symphony
[1:11:47] is to play the trumpet
[1:11:53] you're not the star of the show you're
[1:11:54] just part of the music
[1:11:58] and so the script is given to you
[1:12:01] and the script is there in front of you
[1:12:03] and you play that and you play it and
[1:12:05] you play it and you play it
[1:12:07] you probably won't get it right the
[1:12:09] first
[1:12:10] many times
[1:12:12] but once you get yourself out of the way
[1:12:16] once you get your personality out of the
[1:12:19] trumpet
[1:12:20] [Music]
[1:12:22] and just play what's on the sheet music
[1:12:26] and you're not sitting there with the
[1:12:27] pen in your pocket going i'm not going
[1:12:29] to play that part and i don't like that
[1:12:32] part and i don't like that part i
[1:12:34] believe it ought to be
[1:12:35] let me just say this just play it how it
[1:12:37] is
[1:12:39] just play corinthians how it is just
[1:12:42] play galatians how it is just play the
[1:12:44] book of revelations how it is
[1:12:48] god wrote it we're his children and we
[1:12:51] believe it just how it is
[1:12:54] i'm not here to argue with it i'm here
[1:12:56] to believe it
[1:12:58] i don't even have to understand it it's
[1:13:00] not up for me to understand
[1:13:03] [Applause]
[1:13:09] it's way above my pay grade to rewrite
[1:13:12] it
[1:13:20] now he's one person
[1:13:22] whether it's in his bedroom or in his
[1:13:24] living room
[1:13:26] or sitting on the front porch
[1:13:28] and he's sitting there playing
[1:13:31] and he's listening to what he's playing
[1:13:34] maybe he can youtube how it's supposed
[1:13:36] to sound
[1:13:38] and to mimic it perfectly
[1:13:41] because
[1:13:42] when he gets in front of the director
[1:13:46] the director is under the inspiration of
[1:13:48] the composer
[1:13:50] and the composer wants it a certain way
[1:13:55] it's not up for
[1:13:57] negotiation here he wants it a certain
[1:13:59] way
[1:14:01] a lot of people want to argue with our
[1:14:03] prophet but let me just say this to you
[1:14:05] your argument is much higher than our
[1:14:07] prophet
[1:14:13] and so and so
[1:14:15] the director gets under the inspiration
[1:14:17] of the composer and so he gathers people
[1:14:20] that can play the park
[1:14:25] i know some backgrounds of some of these
[1:14:27] things
[1:14:29] and so there are people that will come
[1:14:31] that will
[1:14:32] audition
[1:14:35] for the part
[1:14:38] i did some reading
[1:14:40] here and the people that say it ought to
[1:14:43] be played another way they are
[1:14:45] immediately scratched off
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:53] and the people that put themselves in
[1:14:55] the part
[1:14:56] they're scratched off
[1:14:59] because what we're to do
[1:15:01] is when there's 25 000 people sitting
[1:15:04] with paying tickets
[1:15:06] many of them sitting in tuxedos and fine
[1:15:09] dresses and they paid a lot of money
[1:15:11] they're wanting to hear beethoven life
[1:15:15] written hundreds of years ago but
[1:15:17] beethoven believed that my my my lyrics
[1:15:21] will will go into eternity listen this
[1:15:24] message will go into eternity
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] beethoven's probably won't but this
[1:15:30] message will go into eternity we'll
[1:15:33] stand one of these days as overcomers of
[1:15:36] laodicea
[1:15:38] were living vessels that played the park
[1:15:57] as a minister we're not to put our
[1:15:59] personality over this word
[1:16:02] we're not to put our thoughts over this
[1:16:04] word
[1:16:06] we're not to put our opinion
[1:16:08] over this word
[1:16:10] because remember
[1:16:12] remember brother branham
[1:16:15] met an angel in a cave
[1:16:22] sister connie
[1:16:24] he was the only man
[1:16:27] of this dispensation
[1:16:30] of many dispensations
[1:16:33] that could say
[1:16:35] i met an angel
[1:16:37] in a cave
[1:16:39] and preached sermons like how the angel
[1:16:42] came to me
[1:16:44] hundreds of
[1:16:45] ministers sitting around him none of
[1:16:47] them
[1:16:48] had that testimony
[1:16:52] are you with me
[1:16:54] and brother branham would stand there
[1:16:57] it didn't matter whether they believed
[1:16:59] it or not
[1:17:02] i want you to understand when we come to
[1:17:04] this message it don't matter
[1:17:06] whether people believe it or not
[1:17:11] i'm not i'm not here to try to convince
[1:17:13] the unbeliever or the fake believer the
[1:17:15] pretend believer i i'm not here to
[1:17:18] convince them i'm not trying to get
[1:17:20] goats to be bred into sheep
[1:17:24] wolves we have no interest in them we're
[1:17:27] just getting the bride ready to play the
[1:17:29] final part
[1:17:31] because we are the final voice to the
[1:17:33] final age
[1:17:35] and we have a message to play we've got
[1:17:38] sheep music to play
[1:17:45] are you with me
[1:17:50] brother branham would go beyond the
[1:17:52] curtain of time
[1:17:53] and see us as believers
[1:17:56] and we would tell him that we're resting
[1:17:58] on this message
[1:17:59] because he preached what paul preached
[1:18:01] and he preached what peter preached
[1:18:06] are you with me now
[1:18:08] those people were turned young again
[1:18:10] so we got a glimpse of heaven
[1:18:12] then we got a glimpse of hell
[1:18:17] i've sat in the parking lot where
[1:18:18] brother branham was sitting watching
[1:18:21] that woman come up over that escalator
[1:18:23] speaking in another language and with
[1:18:25] that hair doing with that coloring of
[1:18:26] her eyes
[1:18:28] if brother branham could see what we see
[1:18:30] today on a daily basis
[1:18:35] he he talked about how hell was blending
[1:18:38] its dimension
[1:18:39] if he could see that in 6465
[1:18:42] what about today
[1:18:46] but he also had a vision of the bride
[1:18:48] bride from every nation
[1:18:51] listen there was the modern bride that
[1:18:53] came forth in her
[1:18:55] i don't even talk about her attire her
[1:18:58] bikini fig live situations
[1:19:01] literally porn situation what the church
[1:19:03] has produced
[1:19:06] are you with me now
[1:19:09] but he saw a bride come forth
[1:19:12] a bride out of every nation coming forth
[1:19:15] and he watched her at the end and he was
[1:19:17] so proud
[1:19:19] watching her at the end how she came
[1:19:21] back again
[1:19:22] and one kind of got out of step and he
[1:19:24] and he screamed to her get back in line
[1:19:26] get back in line that's why church is so
[1:19:29] important
[1:19:30] that's why the assembling of ourselves
[1:19:32] together is so important we're an
[1:19:35] encouragement to one another
[1:19:40] it's easy to sit in your bunny slippers
[1:19:42] and drink your coffee
[1:19:46] watch your favorite preacher from one
[1:19:48] segment to another segment but get
[1:19:50] yourself out of bed
[1:19:52] put your clothes on
[1:20:05] shake off every devil in hell and every
[1:20:07] backsliding spirit that you have to
[1:20:09] fight all week long get to church
[1:20:12] come with an attitude that i'm gonna get
[1:20:14] something from god i'm gonna play my
[1:20:17] part as a body of jesus christ i don't
[1:20:21] have to be a star i don't have to be a
[1:20:23] strong personality i just want to put my
[1:20:26] shoulder to the will
[1:20:28] let that freedom reign
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:47] now let's just take for a moment
[1:20:49] the backdrop behind brother branham
[1:20:54] here in america
[1:20:55] just in america
[1:20:58] we have a cuban missile crisis
[1:21:02] we have the vision of the youngest
[1:21:04] president to be elected
[1:21:07] a camelot of sorts
[1:21:10] jfk
[1:21:11] is
[1:21:12] elected it's almost a
[1:21:15] camelot that takes place
[1:21:18] and he stands at his inauguration said
[1:21:21] it's not what this country can do for
[1:21:23] you but what you can do for this country
[1:21:28] women given the right to vote
[1:21:30] vision's happening so rapidly
[1:21:34] now think about the spirits that are
[1:21:36] being released
[1:21:37] when brother branham is preaching some
[1:21:39] of these
[1:21:40] most incredible sermons
[1:21:42] the beatles come on the scene
[1:21:46] the beatles come on the scene
[1:21:48] and literally when they
[1:21:50] arrive in america there's such an
[1:21:52] anointing on them until people that are
[1:21:54] sick go and where they are getting off
[1:21:57] of the plane are healed
[1:21:59] thinking that the messiah has arrived
[1:22:05] the race rights
[1:22:07] was everywhere in america
[1:22:10] what you see today is the harvest of
[1:22:12] what brother branham was contesting with
[1:22:15] race
[1:22:16] was taking place
[1:22:19] let me just say something to you about
[1:22:21] race
[1:22:25] we're christians
[1:22:40] we're christians and we all came from
[1:22:43] the adamic race
[1:22:46] we are christians and if you are
[1:22:49] prejudiced here is an altar
[1:22:52] [Applause]
[1:23:05] malcolm x was on the scene
[1:23:07] and he was a militant part
[1:23:09] he came out wanting to fight wanting to
[1:23:12] kill wanting to do a lot of different
[1:23:13] things on the other side of that the
[1:23:16] flip of that was martin luther king
[1:23:18] who was a phenomenal speaker who was
[1:23:20] more polished in many of his ways who
[1:23:23] actually was a great visionary
[1:23:26] because he had a vision that one day
[1:23:29] that we could all live together
[1:23:32] that's not on this earth but there is
[1:23:34] coming a land
[1:23:37] there is coming a land and it won't be
[1:23:40] by political
[1:23:41] ramifications of getting things done
[1:23:44] it'll be by the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:54] music begins to turn loose and i'm not
[1:23:56] going to go far with this
[1:23:58] but the bebop of the music begins to
[1:24:00] turn loose the 50s music
[1:24:02] turns loose many of you were involved in
[1:24:05] it elvis turns loose
[1:24:06] elvis is almost like a messiah on the
[1:24:09] scene and has an anointing
[1:24:12] he was his granddaddy's
[1:24:14] song leader in the tent meetings he was
[1:24:17] anointed
[1:24:18] even anointed with the holy ghost on his
[1:24:21] flesh
[1:24:23] and he could stand and preach seeing
[1:24:25] jailhouse rock
[1:24:28] and at the end of the concert sing
[1:24:30] amazing grace
[1:24:32] on the wings of a snow white dove he
[1:24:35] could sing some of these songs and bring
[1:24:37] audiences to their knees with conviction
[1:24:46] but he sold his birthright
[1:24:51] he sold his birthright
[1:24:54] you see all of this was hell open in
[1:24:56] itself
[1:24:57] revelations 9
[1:24:59] hell opened itself that pit that smoke
[1:25:01] that was coming forth
[1:25:03] every spirit that was being loosed after
[1:25:05] the seals were revealed
[1:25:08] now today
[1:25:10] what you and i have as our backdrop
[1:25:14] is the harvest of all of the seeds or
[1:25:17] all of the spirits are coming forth
[1:25:19] because spirits don't live in trees they
[1:25:21] don't live in pulpits they don't live in
[1:25:23] your pews they live in human beings
[1:25:27] if you could look at the schools that we
[1:25:30] had
[1:25:34] when i was going to school if i could
[1:25:36] just give that witness i did not know
[1:25:39] what sodom and gomorrah was i heard it
[1:25:41] preached in the pulpit i did not know
[1:25:45] i definitely didn't have anybody in my
[1:25:48] school identifying themselves as a cat
[1:25:58] we sat in the airport the other day with
[1:26:00] a woman dressed completely head to toe
[1:26:02] as a cat and when they brought her food
[1:26:04] she put her mouth in her plate
[1:26:10] insanity
[1:26:14] and her family around her seemed like
[1:26:17] normal decent people
[1:26:22] somewhere they they take on a spirit
[1:26:29] prisons are full
[1:26:32] of people that were good people
[1:26:35] brother tom you were a guard brother
[1:26:37] jeremy you were a part of that system
[1:26:39] maybe some of you others were guards in
[1:26:40] those in those in those prisons
[1:26:43] they were good people in there
[1:26:45] can't even believe that i did such an
[1:26:47] atrocious thing but a spirit came on
[1:26:50] them
[1:26:52] and they killed her wife or they killed
[1:26:54] their children or they killed their
[1:26:55] buddy down the road
[1:26:58] they robbed a bank
[1:27:02] let me just tell you something personal
[1:27:04] when i worked at a grocery store that's
[1:27:06] where i started out
[1:27:08] i worked at a grocery store six and a
[1:27:10] half almost seven years i was a meat
[1:27:12] cutter when i married sister connie
[1:27:15] i really liked the job but god didn't
[1:27:17] want me to be a meat cutter all my life
[1:27:18] and so
[1:27:20] every person that we caught shoplifting
[1:27:23] had way more money in their pocket
[1:27:27] to pay for the items that they stole
[1:27:31] every one of them told us
[1:27:33] fred graham was one of the other guys
[1:27:35] that was a part of that and they would
[1:27:37] tell us something just got on me and i
[1:27:39] just took it
[1:27:44] we caught the mayor
[1:27:47] of the city
[1:27:50] shoplifted
[1:27:52] i know he did not need to do it
[1:27:56] we caught the judge's sons
[1:28:00] shoplifting
[1:28:07] and so they got all rattle boxed
[1:28:12] and began to swing and we gave them
[1:28:15] exactly what they were looking for
[1:28:20] i haven't always been a preacher
[1:28:26] and my daddy taught me one principle
[1:28:28] don't never start a fight
[1:28:30] but always end it
[1:28:33] i taught my boys the same principle
[1:28:37] and since the devil wants to pick a
[1:28:39] fight with us we might as well end it
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:56] now let me just say this to you
[1:28:58] all of this in our backdrop
[1:29:01] but the sheep music declares we will
[1:29:04] overcome
[1:29:07] did you hear me talk to you last night
[1:29:09] about all the things that you go through
[1:29:12] but god says at the end of it you're
[1:29:14] going to come forth like gold
[1:29:17] so always remember no matter what you go
[1:29:20] through
[1:29:22] and you can't see your way through it
[1:29:24] and everything that's going on around
[1:29:26] you remember god's in control you're in
[1:29:28] his orchestra just play the music at the
[1:29:32] end of it thousands of people are going
[1:29:34] to stand and say we made it
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:50] i just want to give you can i just do a
[1:29:52] little teaser work here
[1:29:55] brother branham comes to the pulpit and
[1:29:58] no doubt
[1:30:00] you know we're getting ready to have a
[1:30:02] labor day service here
[1:30:04] and we're expecting to be
[1:30:07] over capacity
[1:30:09] we're expecting to be really really full
[1:30:13] and but we're expecting a meeting of the
[1:30:15] ages
[1:30:17] that's our expectations
[1:30:19] and god has never
[1:30:21] he's he's never
[1:30:23] he's never let me down
[1:30:26] i just have to be honest with you
[1:30:28] he just he just don't let you down
[1:30:31] maybe you went to ball games and they
[1:30:32] let you down maybe you went to concerts
[1:30:34] and they let you down and maybe maybe
[1:30:36] you did different things in the world
[1:30:37] that lets you down but when you're
[1:30:38] dealing with god he'll never let you
[1:30:40] down
[1:30:45] people are going to come with
[1:30:46] expectation
[1:30:48] and brother branham's day he preached in
[1:30:50] much smaller churches than this and
[1:30:52] people would come and they'd wait for
[1:30:54] hours sometimes they'd sleep all night
[1:30:56] long in the parking lots and they would
[1:30:58] stand for hours waiting to get in the
[1:31:00] door now we don't have that problem here
[1:31:02] yeah you probably need to get here a
[1:31:03] little bit early
[1:31:05] but they didn't know what brother brown
[1:31:07] was going to preach to him
[1:31:09] where there was projected love or
[1:31:11] perfect love or or when love projects
[1:31:15] and brother branham stands and talks
[1:31:17] about
[1:31:18] bees
[1:31:19] when he's mowing comes up around him
[1:31:22] and i had such a love for them
[1:31:25] and i just began to talk to them and
[1:31:27] they just went back in the ground
[1:31:32] there's times i find myself
[1:31:34] wanting
[1:31:36] to have that kind of love
[1:31:39] this morning as i was being stung by a
[1:31:41] yellow jacket
[1:31:43] i had that i thought you know i wish i
[1:31:45] had that kind of love this is just one
[1:31:48] and if i can find your nest
[1:31:56] crossing the fence
[1:31:58] getting in the pen with a bull hey
[1:32:00] listen i was raised on a farm i know
[1:32:02] what a bad bull is
[1:32:05] a bad bull
[1:32:07] would take your life
[1:32:09] and to do it in a heartbeat it's one of
[1:32:11] our greatest fears with my dad
[1:32:13] because he would stumble a lot
[1:32:15] and he always kept a bull between twelve
[1:32:17] hundred and two thousand pounds he'd rub
[1:32:19] it on the head and give it grain every
[1:32:21] day and i visibly watched dad get tossed
[1:32:24] in the air
[1:32:27] and he was an elderly man i watched him
[1:32:29] get tossed in the air and he'd go back
[1:32:30] and rub that that bull's head
[1:32:33] but brother branham got in a field with
[1:32:35] a bull that had killed a man
[1:32:38] and that bull comes snorting and
[1:32:40] stomping and
[1:32:42] here it come
[1:32:43] and brother brown starts talking to him
[1:32:47] now what was happening was it's the same
[1:32:50] gift that happened in a prayer line
[1:32:54] and he would talk to people
[1:32:57] and he said now you know that there's
[1:32:59] something standing between you and i
[1:33:03] and and he would tell them said now
[1:33:06] you've had this condition and it came
[1:33:08] from this condition
[1:33:10] and your name is so and so your address
[1:33:12] is so and so
[1:33:13] and the doctors told you so and so now
[1:33:16] your daughter you've been praying for
[1:33:17] your daughter and this is her condition
[1:33:21] and this was her best friend this she's
[1:33:23] got a friend that's got this
[1:33:26] you see she did not know it she had
[1:33:29] stepped into the building
[1:33:32] and now she's a part of the orchestra
[1:33:35] and she's standing there with all kind
[1:33:37] of backdrop in her life and she's
[1:33:40] standing and the creator of heavens and
[1:33:43] earth is standing between her and it's
[1:33:46] this is more than a gift
[1:33:49] this is more than some kind of uh uh
[1:33:52] of of a what
[1:33:54] mentalist operation this was god himself
[1:34:01] saying i want to be in control of your
[1:34:02] life and they come into the prayer line
[1:34:05] one way
[1:34:10] and they walk out a complete different
[1:34:12] way
[1:34:19] i come to this service
[1:34:21] very much aware
[1:34:22] the angel lord is always here
[1:34:25] and i personally believe
[1:34:28] when this cancer purpose is over with
[1:34:33] he hasn't got enough strength to stay in
[1:34:35] this body
[1:34:37] and it'll be gone and evaporated in a
[1:34:41] moment
[1:34:57] our buddy brother tim prout said in the
[1:35:00] service of the wings of the snow white
[1:35:02] dove
[1:35:03] at the end of it i spoke to you last
[1:35:06] night
[1:35:07] that a service is more than just two
[1:35:09] weeks of study it's a lifetime
[1:35:12] and brother branham goes through a
[1:35:14] lifetime
[1:35:16] of the orchestra of his life
[1:35:19] and he comes down to the end of it
[1:35:21] brother jeff
[1:35:26] he starts singing a song on the wings of
[1:35:28] a snow white dove
[1:35:30] and in that service
[1:35:32] he writes a verse to it
[1:35:34] can you find that real quickly for me
[1:35:38] i'm getting i'm getting toward an end
[1:35:40] here
[1:35:42] i'll finish this next week
[1:35:44] have you enjoyed this so far today
[1:35:48] what a relaxed atmosphere that we've had
[1:35:53] you won't feel this at walmart that's
[1:35:54] one thing for sure
[1:35:56] now watch this
[1:35:58] though i have suffered
[1:36:02] in many a way
[1:36:07] i cried for healing
[1:36:10] both night and day
[1:36:14] faith wasn't forgotten
[1:36:18] by the father above
[1:36:21] he gave me
[1:36:23] his sign
[1:36:26] on the wings of
[1:36:28] a dog
[1:36:36] i haven't got permission from this
[1:36:41] but sitting about 30 feet as a little
[1:36:43] boy about 12 years old this
[1:36:50] they've taken him there just maybe to
[1:36:52] get a chance to get him prayed for
[1:36:56] and all those miracles happen
[1:36:59] god didn't forget that little boy
[1:37:04] now his family don't hardly recognize
[1:37:07] who he really is
[1:37:09] but he'll speak here saturday night of
[1:37:12] our labor day meeting
[1:37:14] and he's one of the best friends of my
[1:37:15] entire life
[1:37:17] if i ever needed a buddy i got one in
[1:37:20] tim pruitt
[1:37:23] god didn't forget him
[1:37:28] but he used that situation in his life
[1:37:33] he could never play ball or all of the
[1:37:35] different kind of things but god had a
[1:37:37] higher purpose than playing ball
[1:37:41] god raised him up to be one of the
[1:37:43] greatest preachers
[1:37:45] in all of
[1:37:46] history i'm not ashamed to say that
[1:37:50] i'm just proud to be his buddy
[1:37:54] from the backwoods of kentucky donny
[1:37:56] reagan came
[1:37:58] a nobody
[1:37:59] but god took a nobody
[1:38:04] listen if you're part of the orchestra
[1:38:07] god knows how to find you
[1:38:10] he knows where to get you
[1:38:24] our two boys that are preaching
[1:38:27] in
[1:38:28] ohio they've had one of the most
[1:38:31] phenomenal meetings
[1:38:34] timothy pruitt
[1:38:36] and andrew lee spencer
[1:38:50] you can't make those kind of things
[1:38:51] happen
[1:38:54] you can't make it happen
[1:38:58] satan's fought both of them boys with
[1:39:00] everything that he could fight them with
[1:39:02] and there's a backdrop behind them of
[1:39:04] pain
[1:39:05] and words that were said
[1:39:08] but they are playing
[1:39:10] their part
[1:39:13] in the orchestra
[1:39:15] and i would say they're doing real well
[1:39:24] can i can i just talk to you just a
[1:39:25] little bit more
[1:39:27] brother brain would come to the pulpit
[1:39:29] and he would talk about things
[1:39:30] that are to be
[1:39:33] and this is a service
[1:39:35] that is literally
[1:39:37] multiple visions
[1:39:40] that god is going to speak to his wife
[1:39:44] this is what it's going to be like
[1:39:46] it's not a chance it's not disney world
[1:39:50] this is not my wishes
[1:39:52] this is what it's going to be like
[1:39:55] this is what you're going to enjoy
[1:39:58] for eternity
[1:40:03] now there may have been a lot of people
[1:40:05] sitting in the services
[1:40:07] that were bored
[1:40:15] but there were some people there
[1:40:18] that was interested
[1:40:22] they were interested in the rhythm
[1:40:25] this
[1:40:26] this text
[1:40:28] is going to put me somewhere
[1:40:32] i very much am aware
[1:40:34] that as we get toward the rapture the
[1:40:38] moments we don't know the last day we
[1:40:40] don't have a day to waste but these
[1:40:42] texts these messages are put you in
[1:40:46] ready condition
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:55] and these are warm-ups
[1:40:58] now if you get there an hour so early at
[1:41:00] a
[1:41:02] at a at a symphony and believe it or not
[1:41:05] i've been in it
[1:41:07] and
[1:41:09] it sounds like the awfulest racket that
[1:41:12] you've ever heard in your give me a
[1:41:15] drumstick
[1:41:16] two of them
[1:41:18] and they're all warming up
[1:41:22] and it's literally almost blow your mind
[1:41:25] away
[1:41:29] and there's a guy that comes out there
[1:41:32] with a tuxedo one
[1:41:35] and he's
[1:41:37] you know he's
[1:41:39] for the for the ones that i've seen
[1:41:42] and even youtube
[1:41:45] i know you can't believe that but
[1:41:48] most of them got bushy hair
[1:41:51] they're just different sort of people
[1:41:55] but they know the music
[1:41:58] and they know who's been assembled and
[1:42:00] they know who's worked real privately
[1:42:02] and they know that they've accomplished
[1:42:04] and they're ready for this moment
[1:42:06] and now it's going to be okay i'm not
[1:42:08] going to be embarrassed we're ready

[1:42:16] and he steps up and he
[1:42:20] and everybody in the audience gets real
[1:42:22] quiet
[1:42:25] and there's a silence for a while
[1:42:27] everybody gets themselves set
[1:42:29] am i right
[1:42:31] everybody gets themselves set
[1:42:34] and they're not thinking about shopping
[1:42:37] they're not thinking about who's sitting
[1:42:38] beside of them
[1:42:42] actually
[1:42:43] at a spot to where
[1:42:45] it's me
[1:42:47] and music
[1:42:49] now i'm not going to play every part
[1:42:51] here now
[1:42:52] there's certain part of the scripture
[1:42:53] that i'm going to play
[1:42:58] there's certain parts of it i'm going to
[1:43:00] get to play
[1:43:01] but when it comes my turn i don't want
[1:43:04] to be off beat
[1:43:06] i don't want to be out of key
[1:43:09] and i don't want to put myself into it
[1:43:11] all of my training

[1:43:32] symphony everybody's got a part to play
[1:43:36] and everybody begins to play their part
[1:43:38] and they begin to do it on time
[1:43:40] and after a while it begins to build
[1:43:44] and that director
[1:43:45] he's using that stick
[1:43:47] as a reminder
[1:43:49] every motion
[1:43:51] has meaning to it
[1:43:54] every motion has meaning to it
[1:43:56] and these lyrics we're not changing them
