here had a a wonderful week and we've made it through another week we've made it here we certainly were blessed last weekend to have brother timothy pruitt come by our way and the dexter's come by our way and we were we were blessed more than i believe some of us even know just just what god done amongst us last weekend i don't believe will ever be the same i don't believe we'll ever look at a service the same after what happened here last sunday morning and we'd like to just kind of go through before we get into the service tonight i'd like to kind of just go through some of the events that happened here because you don't catch everything while it's all unfolding and i wish that we did and i wish that we were able to grab everything and you can see most of what took place here at the end of the service while brother timothy was speaking you can see most of it actually hear a little bit of it on the streaming but there are those on that side of the stream that didn't understand and even some that were sitting here that didn't even understand everything that had happened last weekend so it just to just to draw your memory back just for a moment you remember you remember that that that morning brother matthew had invited brother michael dexter to come up here and to to sing sing that morning and brother michael gets up and he starts speaking about he starts speaking about that song the great physician now is near and and he gets up and he is going to sing and he starts talking about the event that happened when when about that song when brother branham was playing praying for that little child that had polio in his brother branham said that little child his feet was all drawed up and drawn in there brother branham said he'd seen that light come in and then the mother was standing down there at the end of the altar and he seen that light and brother branham first thought it was a janitor that had shined the light from the stage in his eyes and brother branham thought well that's an awful rude thing to do is to shine a light in somebody's eyes and then he realizes that it's the pillar of fire that's standing there brother branham said now he said i don't know what what happened he said whether i dropped the child or he jumped out of my child he said but when he hit the ground that child's legs come out and he ran over to his mother well that you remember when brother branham starts talking about that mennonite nazarene lady that had been playing the piano she was a friend with this woman and she when she saw that event take place she jumped up and started shouting there and while she was playing the great physician now is near and the piano kept playing and brother brother michael is going through that event and starts telling those things well our musicians you'll notice you'll remember that our musicians were thrown off a little bit because brother michael started singing a complete different song and he's saying then jesus came when jesus come the tempter's power is broken and you remember that that the musicians kind of caught off guard there because they were already in the tune and playing the great physician now is near and i looked at brother ron and i said brother michael was singing a different song than what he even said he was going to sing actually i looked up the words thinking you know maybe i'm off base here brother ron looked at me said we're in for a supernatural event and so you remember that brother timothy begins to preach on the god who answers and the god who can and you remember brother timothy's coming down and all the events that he starts speaking on and you remember he comes down to the end and he's standing out here on this little platform and he starts speaking about the three hebrew children how that they would not bow to the image and how they would not bow down to those things and that that god up in heaven the angels were having a conversation do you see what's going on with your children and wormwood said he would go and gabriel said that he would go but god said no i'm not sending you but i'm coming down myself and brother timothy just kind of whirled around and he said could you imagine and all of a sudden brother timothy's ipad starts playing a sermon the worst center in the city 1956 in minneapolis minnesota now so while you're standing here this this completely caught brother timothy off guard you you all were very aware that it caught him off guard and as he's standing there he just began to say mercy and brother ron is sitting back here where he normally sits at brother ron watched as brother timothy's ipad went from his set of notes over to his music app and starts playing it like somebody standing behind this pulpit and rolls over to that app now brother timothy says now i i there's something that you know he said i didn't he said i don't listen to the tapes on my ipad he said i strictly listened to them on my iphone he hadn't pulled that app up in in months he said or whatever but to think about that the lord was standing right here and he would pick a tape of 1956 and he would play to you the worst sinner in the city and here's the part that we as humanity wish we would have caught because you remember the brother branham or brother timothy thought that he the the song that brother branham was referring to was only believe brother branham says in that in that opening scripture or opening comments he says my favorite hymn he said the background of it you know his brother booth cleborne who wrote that song on his knees by the inspiration in a cornfield one night with the pasteboard pieces in the bottom of his shoes for souls in the shoes sold it to wackley for a hundred dollars and he'd taken the copyright of the song that's my favorite of the hymns it expresses the extreme deity of the lord jesus and especially in a day like this when they try to make him just a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was god now brother timothy even myself we thought that he was speaking of only believe but if you go and look at that he's referring to down from his glory ever living story my god and savior came and jesus was his name and that's exactly what brother timothy was speaking to you about that god was coming down he's not sending somebody else he's not sending gabriel he's not sending wormwood but he's saying i'm coming down myself i feel him at the bull pitches now but he said i'm coming down myself and here he was standing behind the pulpit to tell you that though you might be the worst sinner in the city and brother timothy turns and says now is your time he catches the inspiration of luke and he realizes what the scripture is about that this is when the woman with the alabaster comes to wash jesus's feet and anoint him with oil and brother timothy says come now is the time to give your best to give your best worship to give you best praise it's time to wash his feet and god said i'm coming down down there to deliver them and that was a vindication of what happened in the pre and the post service there were many deliverances that happened down at this pulpit down at this altar and we're a witness tonight or a witness tonight that he is still god in the fire he's still god that wants you to worship him he's still god that's coming down to deliver i tell you i don't want to miss one time that he comes for us maybe you weren't able to catch everything that was going on right there but there was real some real special things that were happening and god was breaking through to speak to us that i have come down even us this week we were all so numb just thinking about how that all took place if you haven't listened to it i would say it'd be a great one for you to go listen to if the lord himself would stand here and say i'm coming down it's 1956 worst center in the city he's coming to every one of you you've got an opportunity this night to stand at his feet and to come to worship him and to think about this that i was in ohio the week before that and my text was on the woman with the alabaster box and there was a family from that meeting that was sitting in this place and those things events happen who can put that together only him i say to god be the glory very we're very special people tonight that god himself would come and visit us some might criticize that that's okay i know what happened you might criticize about the tape plan you might criticize all the events that we just spoke but you cannot criticize the deliverances that happened after it i'd say if there's somebody if there's somebody that got a real touch last weekend and you were in the part of that altar call and part of that move why don't you just go ahead and stand that's a proof that's a proof right there that the living god was amongst us all go ahead for gospel lighthouse go ahead and worship the lord ah blessed be the name of the lord from this time forth and forevermore he has come down to deliver his children hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's just just sing a song and enter into worship just now before we go to the reading of the word i sing that song worshiping you i believe that's what he desires from us it's real worship worshiping you worshiping you oh there's nothing else that i would rather do i love you lord i'm worshiping you worshiping you oh you make it easy lord cause i'm so in love with you oh i long for those moments when joshua and i get lost in your presence and lose track of time when i'm overwhelmed by your glory divine and i'm left with only one thing to do worshiping you worshiping oh there's nothing else that i would rather do i love you lord worshiping you worshiping you you make it easy lord cause i'm so in love with you [Music] so brother andrew i wasn't here last weekend and i missed an opportunity to be where the angel lord is tonight's your opportunity he's coming by your way he's as good as his word where two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be in the midst of them i believe you know do you ever get that feeling in your spirit like something's going to happen i have that i've had that feeling in my spirit all day long you may have missed last weekend let's not miss tonight amen amen if you have your bibles to see we would like to look over in the book of ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 and also revelations chapter 3 and verse 14. amen ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. while everyone's kind of finding their way there let's just speak to the author of the word this evening heavenly father we approach your thorn of mercy just right now father lord is sensing lord that your your nearness is ever so close father lord more than just in this room lord more than just a an emotion of people but there is a power in this place to drive back every spirit of fear and unbelief father lord we know that we are gathered here lord with the most precious people on earth the purchase of the blood lord realizing lord that that you have come to speak to your children tonight we just want to step out of the way father and let you step in lord we come with hungry hearts we come with needy lives father we come carrying burdens lord that only you can answer father things that you can lift off of our lives father just to be able to say that that we know you and we've handled you father we are blessed now lord jesus one more time as we take of your of the word of god we pray that you would speak to us lip to ear father may every person under the sound of our voice may they receive a blessing from on high tonight those that would love to be in the service but can't do the circumstances we pray that you would minister to them we believe father that you have entered into the neighborhood father and you're delivering the mail and we ask god that you would just step in just now may we see you may we sense you may we feel you may you speak to us through your word we pray these things in jesus christ's name amen and amen ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye being in times past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of the israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope without god in the world i remember a spot like that but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of christ let's say that together made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us revelations chapter 3 and verse 14 i'd say that most of us here could be able to quote these these next set of scriptures by heart reading these things knowing that this is the hour and the age that we're living in but let's read it one more time and under the angel the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thou works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou were cold or hot so the million so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and in need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i sath that thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will suck with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord we've been speaking to you on the last little bit on the realm of the believer and the channel of the believer and then breaking into another world and tonight by the help of the lord we'd like to speak to you on breaking down breaking down barriers and here we see that the spirit speaks expressingly to each age if you look through the book of revelations all the way from one two and three you can see that there god is speaking to john on the isle of patmos and god brings him up into this into the spirit on the lord's day and he brings him even so far he brings him all the way into this day but here john he captures these things and we realize that that john is pinning these things down but god is the author of these things but here the spirit speaks speaking is is speaking expressively to them that have an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and to set here to say that we have heard or we can understand what the spirit of the living god is saying to this church age we could say that we are a blessed people to be able to feast upon the good things of god to realize what the bible has said over in revelations 19 and 9 that these are the true sayings of god and to recognize that that he has come down amongst us to deliver this word in this hour to a people that were destined for this moment to to go into a spot or into a world that only the believers can go into when you when you live elbow to elbow and shoulder to shoulder in a world that is full of hatred when you've got young people that are that are full of themselves they're full of their they're full of righteous uh righteous indignation against them own selves they're selfless and we live in an age where where men is so completely selfish and it's a it's an age where men are heady they're high-minded they're lovers of self they're lovers of pleasure they only care about themselves they don't care about everybody around them they only care what focuses upon themself they only have facebooks or instagrams about themselves they don't have an instant instagram or an insta face for somebody else but they got something for their own self because man is so self-centered in this day that they can't focus upon everybody else but they're worried about themself and they're worried about what's going on around them and they will break a promise just to have a little bit more pleasure in this world and then this life that they're living in they'll break that promise but i want to assure you that there is a god that is not self-centered about himself but he is centered about you this evening and he is concerned about everything and he's concerned about his children he's concerned about the world status even though the world statuses is caught up on itself and it and it's a people that is divided amongst themselves you see people against people you see nation against nation and you see wars and after war after war and it's constantly telling you that they are demon spirits that are warring against one another and men and nations and politics and parties are constantly building up walls and they're not bringing in unity but they're actually bringing in and destroying the future generations you can get excited about your politics you can get excited about your party but your party will not bring unity it will only bring division what did covet do it didn't bring unity but it brought division it brings division and when any time a disease comes in it brings division any time you see a spirit of unbelief come in it brings division but god has come now to break down the middle wall of division to break down the things and to bring back in the unity with god himself it's not a unity between man but it's a unity between god and man and we're living in the laodicean age when the when the prophet told us that this is the age of people's rights or the justice of the peoples and they are all and you can turn on the news and the first thing you hear or the first thing you read about is people's rights they want their unity they want their rights they want their rights and they want their they want they have their own races and everything in their own unity and they're all calling for this but they don't want unity brother branham would say that it was a false unity that they're asking for they're wanting to divide themselves they're only concerned about their own rights but i want his rights more than i want my own rights more than a republican or a democrat i want to be with him in all things i want to stand with him more than i stand upon my own two feet hallelujah because this world will pass away but the word of god will remain on and on and on and on [Applause] but this kind of false unity didn't just begin you've been told about it throughout the bible that there was a unity that that you watch all the way down through the dark ages you can watch as that as that same as that same bug comes in and it starts eating away of all of the spiritual unity in the people and you watch as that cankle worm and that palmer worm and the caterpillar as it goes down through its stages you remember that it's the same bug just in a different stage you can watch it down through its different lives and you can watch how the devil always comes in he'll come in and he will break up brotherhood and he is always trying to break the unity of man that devil is always after the religion or he's after the experience and he's after the move of god and you watch as that caterpillar as it went in and got it to the pentecostal church it broke up the brotherhood that it came that it had then the locust comes and all the way down through and they begin to come in with their their different things and they eat away the experience they eat away speaking in tongues they eat away praying in the holy ghost they eat away fasting they eat away praying they eat away a family altar they eat away this and they and they eat away going to church they eat away and said now you can have it just by streaming they eat away going to church and a real sacrifice to be in church as you watch as it's everything that the enemy does is always to destroy and every time satan comes in he is always trying to rob you from something he cannot offer you anything unless he's trying to rob you from something he can't offer you peace unless he's trying to rob you of your joy he can't offer you money unless he's robbing you of your time he can't offer you a better life with your family unless he's offering you more time away from god it is satan trying to destroy god didn't come with the act or the mindset to destroy but it came to build up he came to give life and you light and that you would have life more abundantly i believe you ought to be able to prosper and be in good health but i don't believe you ought to be so busy that you can't hardly stay awake in sermons [Applause] i believe you ought to prosper and to be able to live a good successful life but i don't believe it ought to steal away your joy of the lord i believe you ought to be able to enjoy life to its fullest but i don't believe it ought to steal away the real love of god that you got in your heart i believe i believe in spending time with family but i believe in more spending time with god if you go to studying on what a barrier is it's a fence i i know most of you know what that is some of you had to jump them a few times in your life farmers seem to put them things in funny places sometimes but if a barrier is a fence it's a fence or an obstacle that prevents movement or access and it's an amazing thing that that that a barrier will come in and you can watch and you can look at barriers in all walks of life and farmers use farmers use barriers or fences to keep livestock in or to keep hunters out barriers can be used in everything you can go down the road and the d.o.t uses barriers to keep traffic from moving a certain way or to keep people out you see there are barriers that are built those things are built there with the intent that one will not surpass that barrier that's what a barrier does it's simply to try to keep you out of something this is about breaking down barriers and i'm not telling you to break down your farmer's barrier i'm not telling to break down so you can go get on the better hunting land the better hunting land is not on that side you'll get in trouble the better hunting is where the buck will be that's as simple as it is but there's all kinds of barriers throughout walks of life all kinds of things that we face as humanity barriers barriers of human dna barriers of the makeup of humanity even the emotional state of family ties there are barriers that each and every one of us we carry there are things that the spencers carry that you don't carry there are things that the the no else carry or the vance's carry that you don't carry there are certain things that are laying there in your genealogical tree or habits that seem to pass down from one family member down to another and you'll hear some people say well i guess my i guess my daddy died an alcoholic i guess i'll die that way too now that's some kind of thinking right there that you've got to go the way that your daddy did but you know there are certain things that you carry down through your genealogical tree that are just passed down it's just how it is it's how things are passed down and even if you remember when brother ron was going through the brain surgery in one of his brain surgeries that he was going down the hospital going down to the hospital room and going down getting prepared for that surgery that they were going to do on his brain and he was and he was just praying as they were taking him down through there dealing with this brain cancer and dealing with lung cancer and he prayed at this prayer lord let me be the one that breaks the cycle in my family because you see they had told us as spencer's that there was a certain dna that we carry that produces this type this type of cancer only in our genetic code but i believe that god has so ordained the blood that breaks down every genealogical code that breaks past the fears of humanity that breaks the barriers that we would carry and he would say that i'm more than enough to break through the cycle and break through the barriers of what doctors hate you don't have to live the way your parents live young people amen you don't have to live the way your grandpa lives you don't have to die the way your grandpa died what mama died of leukemia grandpa died of leukemia i guess i'll die of leukemia you can be the one that breaks that thing you don't have to be the one that puts up with that lush spirit or that or that pornography spirit you can be the one to break that thing you don't have to be the one that sits there and deals with all kinds of drugs and say well my mama did it my daddy did it you can be the one that breaks that thing young people oh people all alike it's a time to break down this ain't about learning to live with what you're going through it's not learning to live with your barriers this is about breaking down barriers and the only thing that will break your curse is a new birth [Applause] hallelujah you can carry it all your life or you can learn that it's under the blood you can talk about your past and you can bring it up every time and every time you try to bring up your past you resurrect that dead man you resurrect that thing that that one that person smothered out well you say well i remember what she did or i remember what he did you're guilty of bringing it out of the blood and now it's on you but there is a blood if you would just have enough faith in the blood if you'd have enough faith in the blood you'd realize that it covers that person's iniquities it covers their sins it covers every generation it's not just for this generation it goes all the way back it searched it out and there's an abstract title deed of the holy ghost that says that you have already went through it when christ went through it you went through it you ain't got to pay for your sin you ain't got to pay to get over that barrier he broke it down [Applause] well here let me deal with it well i'm carrying this certain need in my body and this person dealt with it what did christ come to do to break down this is the hour this is this is the hour of not survivors this is not the hour of people barely making it this is not the hour of people just hanging on this is the power and the hour of the overcomers i happen to believe that i'm looking at the hour and the people that will overcome this laodicean flu that it's not strong enough to stop you it's not strong enough to keep you it's not strong enough to stop the move of god i believe this is the hour of real young people getting the baptism of the holy ghost i remember with all of my heart that this is the hour when you can stand right in your pew confess your sins and get baptized with the anointing of the holy ghost and you not go out and do those things never again make you walk a new life live a new life talk a new talk you know i ran into young people that don't understand that kind of talk they don't understand how in the world that you can talk a new talk and walk a new walk let me tell you when you get burned when you get birthed you will walk a completely different way it might take you a little bit to figure out your legs and make you figure out how to use the muscles but you will walk differently it might take you a little bit how to use the muscles in your tongue how to talk but you'll talk differently [Music] it's the hour of overcomers and in the layout i see in church age he said now now what are we to overcome that is a normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is illogical for for does it matter what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome you see christ came down to your level he didn't stay up there with the angels but he come all the way down notice this next quote that i've sent the this and the brothers upstairs and the sisters sometimes them sisters like for me to say the brothers just in case they mess up we called them out tonight but look how christ came to your level he said look temptation was for him you know that the bible said he was tempted at all points like we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking what jesus tempted by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet he couldn't put a mark you couldn't put a mark on him that's a perfect man now notice overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks now notice a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and you know that he's a devil he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcame him and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen that's real overcoming when you recognize now notice notice this he said now you look back and say well i'm doing this and i'm doing that then no no no you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize you've overcame and you know that he's a devil you can't say well i got a sickness i i don't believe it's a sickness now this this scripture right here this quote brought me in the very first moments that we were going through the trials of spencer family this quote right here was life there's a lot of people that try to walk around and and you'll understand what i'm getting ready to say as soon as i read this there's a lot of people that walk around say well i don't got this i don't got this i don't got this i don't got this i'm not sick i'm not sick yeah that's not overcoming brother ron didn't walk around and say well i ain't got cancer even though doctor says it he didn't walk around saying i i don't have cancer i don't have cancer it's not real it's not real it's not real i'm not what i'm hearing is not real he did not walk around and say i don't have cancer i don't have cancer but he did walk around and say by his stripes i am healed i am the lord thy god that heals all of thy diseases are you with me notice he said let me find again he said you know he's the devil you you can't say i got sickness i don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness you got cancer you don't believe it is cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer now i just shut up anybody that has to has to deal with mind over matter but remember greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcame this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible exactly the way the scripture is written overcome it hallelujah you can go through your personal battles and say well i got delivered last week and i really got delivered last weekend i really got delivered last weekend but yet there can still come an enemy and whisper in your ear and say you really didn't get it you really didn't get it he's going to do his job but you're going to do your job you say you are nothing but a lion's flew foot you are nothing but a liar from your birth from your creation i am a part of a god that does not lie and when god delivers god delivers when god heals god heals when god sets free god sets free when god gives a holy ghost god gives a holy ghost now i believe everything that the prophet said he said the right minor out of truth toward every divine promise of god will bring it to pass and he said even even if you don't really believe it he said just say it until you do believe it we're not talking the devil's language we're not talking what he's given we're giving back what he's given and we're giving him god's own medicine because we've got the greatest example that we ever could have had when we got jesus up there in matthew chapter 4 and luke chapter 4 when he's standing up there on a mount of temptation and satan comes to him and he tries to figure out what his position was in life that's what satan will do to you is try to figure out your position and he said if you be the son of god command these stones to be made bread and jesus give him exactly what would defeat him he gave him the word of god he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god then satan came and made him another offer if you be the son of god cast yourself down and the angels will carry you up he gave him the word he said it is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and he shut him down again because the word will defeat satan any time any place in any situation it's the word it's not your own human ability it's the word he comes to him and makes him another offer and he says to him i will give you all the kingdoms of this world if you'll just bow down and worship me get behind me satan get behind me satan brother branham broke into it and said you realize that jesus realized that he was going to fall heir to that in the millennium how can you make jesus bow when he knows the future is coming how can satan make you bow when you know your future is nothing but a rapture we're not bowing to lay out a seal we're not bowing the cancer we're not bowing to diseases it's a rapture for us he was making him an offer but jesus refused the devil's offer and he'll come to you and make you an offer he will offer you religion without a new birth he will offer you he will offer you a motion without real worship he will offer you peace without going through the pain but when jesus makes you an offer it's not just for this temporary life it's for eternity and you may not understand why you're going through what you're going through but god's got your good in his mind hallelujah jesus didn't have to tell satan who he was jesus knew who he was and you don't have to tell satan who you are you know who you are i'm a child of god i'm a child of the most high god hallelujah what are you overcoming with he didn't use one ounce of his back young people you can overcome you can overcome and you can make it through a battle with one scripture if all you know is john 3 16 memorize it write it down put it on your refrigerator put it on your little kitchenaid cabinet that you got up there in your little play room and remember that jesus is the son of god maybe all you can remember is psalms 23 write it down remember it the lord is my shepherd because satan can whip you around on your emotions he can whip you around on your feelings but he cannot whip you around on the word of god you just go to quote and if all you know is philippians 4 and 13 that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me you keep quoting it till you get sick of quoting it and the devil will have to go because he cannot stay where the word is [Applause] hallelujah jesus said my word is spirit and his life life right here he stands here he says the great and mighty conqueror that's overcome all things he's unlimited in power he's unlimited in truth he's unlimited in goodness he's unlimited in healing he's unlimited in miracles he's unlimited in deliverance and christ in the true church he's a continuation of the book of acts there has been a word that has spoken and there is a people that's destined to meet that word [Music] let me let me i'm a little bit ahead of my thinking here my brother branham would he would come and we we've been speaking to you on breaking into another world and brother branham said now he said now standing before you he said there is a demon of doubt now let me just illustrate it just for your minds just for a moment if that would be a person if that would be something that you could see brother brahma reaching into that world he said now standing before you is a demon of doubt and in one case brother branham is standing with a he's dealing with a blood a person that has a blood sugar excuse me i'm just looking through the quotes right here and he's dealing with a lady that has has blood sugar and he said he said i see there's blood dropping there's blood dropping between you and i and so brother brandon would say now there's a demon of doubt that's standing between between here he's standing right before you now if there's a demon of doubt standing before you here here here it is if you you've got a demon of doubt that's standing before you or unbelief that's standing before you what is he doing he's trying to block you from something he's trying to keep you from something he's trying to create a barrier that'll block you from getting to it that's what a scarecrow is you remember in the cornfield a scarecrow goes up it's trying to scare away the crows from coming in there you see it's a barrier it's trying to throw up a bluff to try to keep you out of it and brother adam would look into that world and he said now there's a demon of doubt standing before you and then he would break into that world and say but i see healing for you let's go to calvary together for a blood transfusion i know a god that makes the blood of man not doctors not humanity but i know a god that knows how to make blood and make it so perfectly that everything elevates and earth and works according to its plan if it's standing before you there's something that's trying to keep you out of but i i've always i've always been amazed at this when brother branham he he comes and he he starts going in and he's speaking with a patient and he said now now standing out there before you is a well body now look what look what he does he said he said now he said standing before you is a person it's a it's a well body he said but jesus is speaking beyond that what is it he's telling you if you can ever walk one time into that well body you're gonna go jesus already got a future for you he said jesus is speaking beyond that well body he said all you got to do is walk walk and walk into that well body if you could ever walk into that well body jesus goes beyond what your plans of humanity is he's already in your future he's not trying to block you he's trying to bring you to something but notice notice we as a children of god we mind the things that are above that's what affects you and i that's what you're that's what you're gathered here for tonight it's because you want to be affected by the things that are from above and being born again from above then we are active and active in the things from above and for his life is in us which is a word his word of vindicating the word itself the spirit's in you is the word made flesh in you the spirit minds the word and is active in vindicating the word again and why am i against organized religion he said the spirit is trying to find honest hearts where the spirit is anxious to manifest and prove that every word of god is true again he says the spirit is interested in vindicating the word so he's here anxious looking for an honest heart he can vindicate himself though he's interested in vindicating the word but if you accepted tradition instead of the word he said that's where you stop you can go no further when you start rejecting the son of man you can go no further when you start accepting religion over a new birth you can never go no further when you accept emotion over a genuine experience let me tell you it is a time that you start getting claustrophobic with the devil and he said hey there's not enough room in here for me and you i'm about to get out of here you ever got stuck in a spot say hey it's too much this is too much for me i'm coming out of this thing coming out of this set you get the digging in a hole and you get down there and all of a sudden your chest gets heavy and you get stuck in a hole and you get you can't get out because you're getting claustrophobic and your your heart starts beating faster and everything's moving you're getting claustrophobic it's a time that you start looking at a devil and you say there ain't enough room in here for me and you [Applause] if your heart's starting to beat fast right now just go ahead and make a little room make a little room make a little room i'm coming you might have to dig you might have to crawl you might have to get a shovel but now's the time to start digging some ditches get ready the water's coming you might hit a tin can but send the holy ghost through there and dig it out oh hallelujah it ain't enough room in here for me and you devil but there's plenty of room for the fourth man in this fire there's plenty of room for the son of man you might have gotten a thick and thin in your trouble but jesus shows up to show out what are you doing bro andrew what are you doing i'm digging i'm digging these young people worth digging for the people that don't get excited about this word i'm digging for him he might sit there like a bump on a pickle or tits on a borehole you're not worthless you've got something to be proud about you're a child of the most hot god if this don't make you emotional if this don't get you excited you're dead truth hurts baby we have the anointed one amongst us it's not just on tape it's not just on book he has stood behind this pulpit and we have received an anointed message so i just can't get past it he come to make a way they come to make a way past and when brother branham was dealing with a sickness he's speaking to a patient and don't don't understand what's going on something wrapped around the optical nerve he said it's something stopping them from seeing maybe it's a mother that's got a woman shut up and it won't it won't produce he said he said it's like it's like an invisible band that's wrapped around that thing that you can't see but if you could ever break that thing everything will operate the way it's supposed to and he would step there and he said no he said if there would be a great beast that would stand here on this pulpit and he'd go to hitting me hitting me with his paws and claws and digging into me he said it wouldn't do me no good just to cut his hand off cut his claws off cut his paws off he said if i could hit him in the head if i could hit him in the head he would finish him right there it's not about what you see it's cutting the head off the demon that's keeping you out of the promises barriers are only there to stop movement and satan has tried to block the channel of the birth canal but there is a birth that's going to take place there's going to be young women there's going to be young men that will be birthed by the word you didn't just walk into a church room tonight you walked into a hospital room this is the birthing place [Applause] [Music] he's come to birth you into a kingdom that'll never let you down lay out a seal will let you down you'll have faults you'll have mistakes but he is birthing you into a kingdom where you won't fall but he'll lift you up the reason why people don't get excited don't read their bible don't pray don't play a tape is because they have never went far enough they have learned to live with the sense of religion they have learned to live with just okay let me get a little bit vulnerable right here i know what it's like to live a life of okay okay just don't cut it are you with me okay just don't cut it when it comes to being birthed you're either in or you're out you're either in or you're out you're not just saying well i'm going to stay up here i'm going to stay up here in this womb i'm going to stay up here in this earth all i want to let me tell you that earth is going to be destroyed but if you can get pushed out oh they might have to use type of medicines to get that baby to come out and jesus might have to take a red-headed now an auburn-headed preacher to preach you into a new birth but he will use some of the most unorthodox ways to get you here he's not satisfied with where you're sitting at he's not satisfied with you living an okay life still listening to your country music still listening to your dog gets told still listening to your wife getting robbed from you and running away with somebody with a honky tonk on the truck he's not satisfied with you living down there sleeping with the table and trying to get up and live with the angels he's not satisfied with filthy living but he is the satisfaction of the soul you want to push you have to push mamas and that is you've been pushing you've been pushing now it's their part you've been bringing them here now it's their part it comes a time in the birth when the baby has got to give way to the canal [Applause] you've been going through the birthplace you've been going through the war wars it's time to come out you've been trying to figure out what in the world's messed up in your life you've been trying to figure out why i keep having these panic attacks why to keep going through these struggles if you can ever press past that barrier oh you can never get past yourself if you can ever get past it when that plane gets to push it when it goes against that turbulence it's fighting it's struggling but if it can never break past that sound barrier there's an unlimited speed there's unlimited power if you could ever break past yourself brake pass this is more than a hydra brake pass this is more than fglt brake pass this is just a pastor big bass that's just brother ron's son break pass that's just brother branham's message but break past and see that he's standing right here [Applause] hallelujah if you could get caught up one time you'd stay caught up hallelujah some of them were satisfied with leaving jericho where it was at well brother man brother brown comes to the destiny and i'm i'm completely off my notes but i'm hunting i'm hunting he comes down credes bernia and he starts speaking about the judgment seat of the world and everybody everybody's pushing against that that move ain't for us that ain't for our young people uh that's that's too much land out there for us that's too much promise land out there for us uh there's too many giants out there and it's just we look like a bunch of grasshoppers i get some giants out there now who told them they was giants who told them there was grasshoppers come on it was imagination here 10 of the 12 spies come back bringing a negative report but there was two oh i wonder if we could get two in this place today [Applause] it was two that was not willing to leave their sister rahab over there in that walled city she'd been living there with that prostitute spirit upon her all her life that's all she ever knew and the time of life was running out for her she knew that the time was coming when she wouldn't have enough money to bring in and you know what i'm saying she wouldn't have enough time in life to produce for her family but anymore was true it said i i'm not willing i'm not willing that any should perish but all would come to life i'm going to tell you something it might be people that come against me for preaching about prodigals coming in there might be people that preach against me about worship and true worship and preaching a seven seals but i'm not gonna be guilty for leaving rahab in jericho if i'm gonna be guilty of something i'm gonna be guilty of breaking down the walls that rey had had learned that learned her child her story or her way of life in there rehab honey it's time to come out it's time to come out you already got everything you have need of to get out of them barriers you've got discarded cord just let it down you've got them a token you've got the material just let it down and joshua got over there he got over looking in joshua chapter 5 and he started looking at the natural brother branham said that he looked across there and he saw that scarlet cord this is what i i believe that the holy ghost is looking across situations and he's looking across needs and said now i predestinated that one i'm gonna tear everything down around him and it's gonna get it's gonna get dusty and you're gonna smell the filth of jericho come up around you but i'm not gonna destroy that predestinated seed i'm coming with my destroying angel and i'm gonna destroy laodicea i'm gonna destroy it with fire i won't destroy no more this world with water and rain but i'm going to destroy it with fire and if i don't do it then i'm obligated to raise up sodom and gomorrah again but when i come down with my wrath i'm coming down but there's a people that's got a token on them they won't smell like laodicea they won't dress like laodicea they won't look like laodicea but there's a token that's been applied rahab get ready things are getting ready to shake get everybody you can here

that seventh age there's coming a shout there's coming an angel hallelujah you gotta break past that sound that oh it's just fanaticism you gotta break past that sound it's just criticism you gotta break past that sound that the days of miracles have passed but there is a sound that is coming that are people that have broke past the barrier and says rahab come out [Applause] rahab i want you to hear me you're worth every struggle he's worth fighting for him he's worth it he's worth everything he's worth your life he's worth your friends he's worth your emotions he's worth every bit of energy [Applause] rahab rahab i got my eyes on you the whole time i didn't leave you down there you knew something was missing you knew something was left off but i'm coming i'm coming rahab rayam you thought it was going to pass you by i thought it was going to come but you did the right thing you said the right thing you played the right thing you didn't play the part of harley you played the part of predestination and you are fully dressed you've got the wedding garment on the veil is over your face and he lifts the veil over top and puts it upon his shoulder and he is saying i am taking full authority for you hallelujah i'm taking full authority for you you can do and you can go anywhere because i am your sustainer i am your life yes your past your past is messed up wrecked up scarred up you've done a lot of bad things rahab you're getting ready to marry a captain you're getting ready to marry you know that general in the army hallelujah it may not look like your daughter's going to be anything but she's getting ready to marry salmon hallelujah and she's going to birth a son that's going to play the part of redemption and there's going to be a lady that says where you go i will go your people will be my people your god will be my guy and out of her wounds will come a king his name will be david he will be like the most high he will be like a people that's not willing to put up with goliaths he's not willing to sit there and let the name of god be made fun of but it starts raising a rock of testimony it says i overcame by the blood of the lamb and you can overcome by the blood of the lamb [Applause] rahab rayhem it ain't gonna just stop with david it's going to go all the way down and it's going to produce it's going to produce it's going to produce joseph and he's going to be a protector of the seed he's going to protect the one that was promised all the way back from the garden of eden that i will put in between between thy seed and the serpent seed and you will bruise his head but he will bruise your heel head out of your belly out of your belly will come the son of god he will save his people from their sins you didn't think what you were doing was worth it but just because you dropped the cord just because you remembered what the spies told you you will produce this mamas and daddy don't you ever give up on me you might get offended the way i preach you might get offended how i talk you might get offended because i talk about your sisters about your daughters how they ought to dress and how they ought to produce don't you get it offended of me because i tell you what the bible has said don't you get it offended me i'm only trying to produce what's on the inside and when you shut the mouth of the ox you are shutting the way for the corn to come forth don't you get offended because i preach holiness i preach holiness because holiness isn't a powerful i preach a baptism of the holy ghost because the baptism of the holy ghost is in the bible i preach malachi 4 because malachi 4 is in the bible i preach a rapture because a rapture is in the bible i preach on people of the rapture because you are there i preach divine healing because jesus is still a divine healer i preach that particles come back because prodigals are still returning [Applause] get claustrophobic with that thing you've been living with get that thing out kick that thing out if it's too much ball kick it out if it's too much time of work kick it out if it's too much sitting around on your lazy rear end on the couch and not willing to play the tapes not willing to read your bible not willing to break through god has said that if you'll break through he'll loose himself what would happen what would happen if you dropped one cord across that window what what what if you get down on your knees one more time you know what makes you move you know what makes you hungry you know what moves you i can't answer that but you can answer that young people old people like you know what moves you you know what makes you hungry he says that i will satisfy the long being soul and i will feel the belly of the hungry you're living in an hour when it's a time of famine for the word of god it's not for food it's not for drink but it's a famine in the land for the word of god and i don't know what more best blessed people you're not in famine you're in feast mode what did brother barum do in the feast of the trumpets he thought he was coming to bring and break out the trumpets but he come to lay out the borders for the bride of jesus christ said this is for you what the message of joshua has done it's laid out that this land of the holy ghost is for our young people and i i can say i could say this i'm i'm done i'm completely finished i've been finished and i've been off my notes for 40 minutes but i i'm not i'm not willing to to let leo ought to see you go by and rob us of our young people [Music] i'm not willing i'm not willing i'm not willing for the barriers to be built up to stop the move of god all throughout my ministry for the last 11 12 years i have been facing against barriers of the move of the holy spirit where men have tried to shut us down for preaching this word and preaching this message and tried to stop real worship amen what you have here fglt is a move of god and satan is doing his best to break that move and bring in barriers he'll try to bring in sickness he'll try to bring in afflictions he'll try to bring up problems but there's no trouble great enough to keep you from the promises of god and i'm not willing that any of uh let me say this ain't a young people service but it is i'm not willing to any of our young people go by and now and not feel the anointing of god i'm not willing to let one service go by when we don't have a time when the holy ghost moves in this place i'm not willing to have one time when we don't feel his spirit i'm not willing to have one message come forth that ain't anointed this church these young people your loved ones that are still out there are worth every energy that you give yes and you might have to you might have to knock down and you might have to crawl but they are worth it they are worth it brother ron spencer was worth this past year and a half of fighting he was worth every pain we went through every prayer we prayed was not in pain every message he has preached has not been in vain it has been prophetic to say the least and christ when he broke through two thousand years ago and broke the seals of death hell and the grave he is showing that he's still big enough to break the seals of cancer off of lives he's great enough to break brain bleeds he's great enough to break back back issues he's great enough to break past all the issues of life let me tell you i'm not willing i'm not willing i'm not willing for any formalism i'm not willing for any intellectualism i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not interested in any form of show to come in and try to stop the move of god from keeping me from my destination there's a destination in front of us so we're going to get there i i was i was towing a trailer the other day and i promise you i'm

things anyways if i was coming i was coming up and i was coming around with this 13 000 pound trailer and that thing's following me every which way and i'm getting 20 feet from my destination and all of a sudden you'd have thought that there was something in front of me that was stopping me from getting to where i was going all of a sudden this thing locked up and it was it just wasn't moving and this guy was pointing me where i need to go and here he got to be right here and i was doing everything i could to get there and this thing was locked down and i thought man i'm this close i'm going all the way so i just i mean i like that thing four wheel drive and it's still locked down as well i got enough power in the front of me now i'm gonna get this thing where it's gotta go i got 20 feet to go and i'm not willing that anything would hold me back from getting there so i just hammered down on that thing that that dude looked at me said man that thing must be heavy i said man it must be heavier than i thought but you see i got out i got out and i was looking this whole thing over and i think man i know this thing's on a hill when it's around the turn and things kind of got a little saigon there and i said man what the thunder is going on here i got out and i was looking it over and the thing of it was is there's this significant part on the trailer it's called a breakaway cord and that thing had broke away and it is built for a specific reason that if that thing breaks away that you can't move that thing didn't know who was in the dropper seat you see i had a power in front of me that was willing to get that thing to its destination now it wasn't some wimpy little let me let me let me go back into my history books here it wasn't some dots and pulling this out it was a 356.7 had a 4.0 rear end differential back there and that thing got to locking in and it started moving and moving and moving you see there was a power to get it to its destination and it got us to its destination and the devil may try all his best to lock you up from going but i got a power i got a power that's laying here it says you're going all the way you're 20 feet from the mark dig in you're right there you might have to break some cards and you might have to fight to get there but there's a power of the holy ghost to get you to your destination there might be barriers there might
