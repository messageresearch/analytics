the Lord would just be with you and help you in all of the proceedings that will take place and God has the final answer anyway and so amen we are thankful that Angels watch over us and amen he's good to us didn't he amen today I know there's a lot of birthdays in the room but today is Matthew's birthday I was thinking over it as I Was preparing and and you know I I don't know if I've ever preached on a Sunday on your birthday of late and so I am honored to to just say how proud I am of Matthew of course I'm proud of all my family but I'm really proud that Matthew has stepped to the plate he's a real man now brother Homer was telling us one time he's we were in the car and we were going down the road and we were getting ready to have a celebration because Matthew had became a police officer and so we're we're getting off of the exit and he said you know Matthew is a real man yes he is he said you know I remember when I became a real man he said you know I I was a real man he said now Matthew's a real man so he made a few more comments and I said brother Homer I said do you ever think that me and Andrew will become a real man he said no I I don't think you'll ever be for those that didn't know him he'd just tell you exactly what he had on his mind and so I don't know what the qualifications was to become a real man but Matthew made it so we appreciate him as a mentor in this church a real example he's my firstborn son so he gets many blessings and and you know many years ago now what maybe 15 years ago we were in a fire together how many 17 years ago yeah 16 years ago amen and so we were in a fire together an explosion of Propane and Gas and Matthew jumped in selflessly and saved my life I wouldn't be here today if Matthew had not have done that act of courage and strength and he you know I I heard somebody was in here with a black jacket and blue jeans and I want to say this to you I'd borrow that today if I could so Matthew I was I was in bib overhauls and and it was a rainy night and it wouldn't fire and finally get fired and and the explosion took place and and just wall of fire that was there but Matthew grabbed me by my bib overhauls actually jerked his shoulder out of place but he saved my life and I have great he is a hero to me and we've had a lot of precious moments and a lot of incredible times together and and uh this this year in in October I was able to hunt with him and uh I was able to watch him kill a monster deer and I was I was I was texting him and saying there's a monster deer in your lap a monster deer in your lap and then all of a sudden I saw the arrow leave and he got it and I think I was happier than he was and so I was definitely breathing hard and I I was thrilled with him and he's got a wonderful family and wonderful children and they're growing up and the fear in an admonition of the Lord and and how great that is and we you know I just have to say this message works it just works and so we thank the Lord all right happy birthday happy birthday brother Joel is that your father yeah father and mother yeah well you can't you can't deny that boy yeah that's what you'll look like when you get a little older grow a mustache that Herald take care of itself yeah yeah God bless you for being here amen we we love you amen you may not love me yet but we love you and so amen God bless you each and every one of you we're happy to have you in the house of the Lord if I miss you the Lord don't miss you and amen we love you isn't he good isn't he good to us and amen I I thought I had a couple more comments to make but you've already mentioned brother Josh gonna come we're looking forward to brother Josh is going to come next week and and he's quite a preacher and we're just so thankful that we're associated with great men of God Amen isn't he good to us and once again we're so happy for brother Joel and Sister Sarah being with us and amen they made the trip again this week I believe they're starting to like some things here and so amen thank you thank you for for being here well Andrew preached most of my sermon last night so I I thought about just getting up and saying ditto dismissing and going eating dinner but wasn't that wonderful last night all right so maybe we'll just start again and you act like you didn't hear anything so if you will be a very receptive audience and caring and loving me we'll just kind of work through it and we'll get to some new part amen let's stand to our feet this this morning if you will turn with me into Genesis chapter 29 and verse 17 I would like to speak on new Administration and today I'd like to speak on the new birth in the new Administration so Old Man passed away and the new man is born again and so I'd like to take a couple of different thoughts with this and maybe turn the diamond a little bit maybe you'll find yourself somewhere in this book amen I'm sure you will amen Genesis chapter 29 and verse 17. think about Moses having to write some of these things Leah was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored Genesis 29 and verse 31. and when the Lord saw that Leo was hated what a statement when the Lord saw that Leah was hated he opened her womb but Rachel was barren and Leah conceived and bear a son and she called his name Reuben there you are in the scripture for she said surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me and she conceived again and bear a son and and said because the Lord hath heard that I was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name Simeon and she conceived again and bear a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have borne him three sons therefore was his name called Levi every one of these boys are important in the scriptures and she conceived again and bear a son and she said after all the hate all the scorn now notice this now will I praise the Lord therefore she called his name Judah and left bearing may the Lord add the blessing to the word you can be seated if you remember the story of Jacob he was a con artist he was a Deceiver none of us would have picked him but God did it's easy to observe or hear how Jacob was paid back for his own deceits he was given Leah the tender-eyed cross-eyed ugly one he was after Rachel the beautiful one but he had a father-in-law he had cheated his own father he had cheated Esau but now it's going to come back to him you live long enough things seem to come back and now his father-in-law cheated him now you would think out of all of this all of this turmoil this girl is married to a guy that don't love her to a guy that disdains her to a guy that's made fun of her to a guy that wanted to marry the sister but she's placed in the bed and she begins to have children thinking that by having his children he will love her never does she find the love of Harmony of marriage with particular Jacob but she does find her name written in the book of Lamb's Book of Life for bearing some of the most important boys in the Earth I want you to just notice this last boy she when she names him now I will praise the Lord she lifted her eyes and her heart way above all of her her troubles all of her anguish all of the hate that had been in her life and she names this boy Judah this boy will be of ultimate importance because of the scripture Jesus the Messiah will come from his lineage from the hated woman from the woman that was ugly from the woman that was disdained from the woman that was done wrong most of her life she will name her last son Judah and she begins to praise God even in this horrible condition my life has changed maybe you think in your life in your life you've been done wrong your life has been wrapped with circumstances that you couldn't help but I want you to remember this God is not shy about where he finds his children he's not ashamed to go to a well he's not ashamed to go to a graveyard he knows where you're at now let's just think about the lineage of our family Noah was a drunk Abraham was too old Jacob was a liar Leo was ugly Joseph was abused by his brothers and even in Egypt was abused Moses had a stuttering problem Gideon was afraid Samson had long hair and he was a womanizer Rahab was a prostitute Jeremiah and Timothy were were too young David had an affair and he became a murderer Elijah was suicidal Isaiah preached naked Jonah he ran from God Naomi was a widow job went bankrupt Peter denied Christ the disciples fell asleep while Jesus was praying Martha worried about everything sisters I finally found you the Samaritan woman was divorced remarried Zacchaeus was too small I found myself Paul was too religious Timothy had ulcers Lazarus was dead so you got some excuses I've just talked to about some of the excuses of the Bible and God overrides all the excuses to give you a new Administration in your life if you're only looking at your Humanity you're missing the whole picture now we just mentioned the woman is the well Jesus was not ashamed of her he was not ashamed that she had five husbands and she's living with another man if she'd had 16 that would have never settled her trouble but Jesus was the man that she needed in her life maybe Jesus is the man that you need in your life in your despair in your discouragements maybe you've wrote You've wrote in your book of life whether it's short or long you've wrote a lot of Horrors and scars and a lot of things that has been written in your life until Jesus came Jesus responds to the woman at the well he says if thou newest the gift of God and who is that that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water he could have just simply said if you knew who I was you would know that I have the Cure if you knew who I was you would recognize that I have the chore how many people have walked in in a lot of trouble generally God finds his children in trouble but if you walk into a service and you realize that Jesus is here and he has to cure to your problems even as Christians we come up against obstacles in our life great difficulties in her life Jesus has the cure to your issues he has secured to your marriage problems he has secures to your family situation he has secured to your financials he has the cure to your your your attitude he has secured to your Moody situations he has the awesome a cure to your whole life and the Lord said unto Simon Simon behold Satan hath the desire to that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee aren't you glad that Jesus is still praying for you he's still making intercession for you I have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren think about this Peter could have turned around to Jesus said have I not been with you three and a half years I left my family I left my home I left my fishing business I left all of that amen and you're telling me that I'm not even converted yet I believe you're the Messiah I told you just the other day that thou art the Messiah the Son of the Living God and you gave me the Keys of the Kingdom he didn't realize he was right before the trial of his life and Jesus is telling him in spite of all of his Brokenness he was telling him I have prayed for you and when you're converted which is when you receive the Holy Ghost when you're at converted strengthen the brethren a man's got to be convinced first and the only convincing thing that is the manifestation or the identity of the Gospel being identified and when you see that you have passed from Death unto life and it become a new creature in Christ Jesus that's the identity of the Holy Ghost how can the Holy Spirit write the Bible and turn around and deny what he wrote he cannot do it and that's the identity he said the identity of unbelief by identity of belief Jesus said these signs shall identify who believed me if you'll remember in Acts chapter 19 . they asked him Paul asked him said as he passes through Corinth Paul having passed through the upper room of the coast of Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed more than just believing drunks on the street believe I said tooth working at night believe God but have you received the Holy Ghost which is the life of God being breathed inside of you where God seals you where the old King of the heart is dead and the old man is gone and God puts his own life his own attributes living on the inside of you the Checker station itself when your flesh wants to sin God calls and pulls on the Rings have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and they said unto them we have not such heard of whether there be a Holy Ghost and he said unto them what were you baptized and they said unto him John's baptism they had missed the coming of Jesus Christ fulfilling the Messiah prophecy and they had missed all of that and there was under John's teachings right oh yeah are you with me now listen you can bypass your your ministry I I thought I thought how I thought how well Andrew put it last night oh we want to go back to brother Branham are we going to go back to Pentecost or we want to go back to yesteryear and missing what God's doing today we're right up on the the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ right up on the resurrection of saints right upon our body change don't look back don't look back whatever you do God built you to live in this day he didn't build you to live in another day another day is just a painted fire for today but this is our day second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 16. Warfare hence fourth know we know man after the flesh yay that through we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore notice these words if any man be in Christ he is a new creature he is operating under a new Administration you used to like you used to cheat you used to drink you used to run you used to have a certain kind of music you used to have a certain thing that you did but when Jesus came what made the difference in your life not a bunch of vowels and not I'm going to have to make myself do this but when Jesus truly comes into your life [Music] let me explain to you trying to make yourself do things it's kind of like turning the new year and you you get on the scale and you begin to make promises you pattern yourself after Hollywood and you look down at your body and you forget the scripture that you're fearfully and wonderfully made and you say I'm not gonna I'm not gonna put Donuts in there and all the Comfort foods that I I enjoy it's almost a lint I'm going to put all of these things away two weeks later take a picture put it on Facebook I'm here with a pizza this big [Applause] [Music] well I'm going to change my husband try that out try that out take your shoes off take your shoes off before you walk in this I'll take your shoes off I've heard that for 40 years take your shoes off make up your side of the bed I finally got that down shoes is still a big deal therefore If any man are you with me untie your shoes go ahead in Christ he is a new creature Paul would say it I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ not a bondage of I I'm dreading It's A Love Affair it's a love affair with Jesus Christ in Ezekiel chapter 36 and verse 26 a new heart also will I give you a new spirit will I put within you and I will I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh brother Brown said the reason God has to give you a new spirit because he even couldn't live with the old one and then he gives you the Holy Ghost two different events and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them Romans chapter 12 and verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God that which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your minds that you might prove what is the good and acceptable and the perfect will of God brother Branham was around some interesting individuals if I could just talk to you just for a second Bert call brother man said was the most cruel man that he ever met brother Adam never explained to him the Sabbath seal third pull the godhead water baptism he never he never explained any of that he just lived the life here was the cruelest man that he'd ever met and brother Branham just simply lived a life he just simply lived a life and it was a life that caused him to be thirsty and he led Bert call to the Lord and he said I gotta have your Jesus he found himself in a yard of an infidel and he's quite proud of being an infidel and I'm not going to tell the whole story but this man didn't believe in God actually kind of made fun of people that did believe in God but there was a predestinated seat on the inside of him a woman had got healed up on the hill he thought she was going to die they had a noise up there one morning and he didn't know the story but he went up there took the wagon getting ready to take her body down off of the off of the Hill went up there and she was healed and he heard the story about a preacher that had sent word and to and he had prayed for her and they came on and told her the results of that prayer and she got healed now this Infidel wanted to meet that preacher he didn't show up in a three-piece suit they had been hunting for a few days he had blood on his on his pants and and no doubt he looked a little bit rough in his beard brother bam when he would hunt he would he would allow his beard to grow and he probably hadn't taken a bath for a few days that don't give us a right not to take a bath every day you stink and let me just say this to you brother but I'm standing there and he didn't tell him I'm the prophet of this age he didn't tell me tell him they didn't explain no godhead or he didn't explain anything to him he picked up an apple then he said put a glass of water on the fence post this is in my notes been in my notes for a few weeks so don't don't get excited here brother Ron you're picking on me why don't you get excited about that I'm just trying to get you to live the life and so anyway it picked up a glass of water dude he asked he said I see the leaves are starting to turn here and it's August and I see they're starting to turn and and he says all right if I have an apple and he said yeah the yellow jackets are eating them up and brother Bram asked him said what intelligence is telling that tree to send it sat back down to the ground and causing those leaves to turn colors oh that's just nature you talk staring a little bit and he says uh if you can tell me what intelligence tells that tree to send it sap back down to the ground he said we haven't even had a cold morning here he said I'll tell you what intelligence told me about that woman your brother Brown now both around went hunting in Colorado most years brother Royce Shrewsbury was out there his hitch had broke on his on his uh vehicle and he had to get it welded and so the guy is uh the guy is welding on his deal and he saw his license tag West Virginia he said now isn't West Virginia close to Indiana how close is it to Jeffersonville he said well what interest do you have in Jeffersonville he said well there used to be a guy came here and he hunted every year and said it he would sit on that porch right up there at that Country Store and he would tell us Miracle after miracle and we would all sit around and listen to him talking he said sure would be nice to meet him said are you talking about William Branham that's who I'm talking about he said well he's passed away he's gone now that man never heard brother Branham preach that man never never heard any of the great doctrines but a man in hunting clothes a man in hunting clothes there's a YouTube video out of brother Branham in Africa I've watched it several times and found it interesting that that he was he was with people that no doubt didn't realize who he was there's times that he's in his hunting clothes and then there's another time that he's in his in his suit and he's a little hat he's not trying to put on anything listen we're not the important one we're not the great one Jesus is the great one I love what you said last night brother random wasn't trying to draw people to himself he was wanting to get them to Jesus Christ now we know that deities not just in heaven but God wants to live in you and he so picked your Tabernacle to where he could live in God wants to use your eyes he wants to use your hands he wants to use your mouth now all of us are on a journey we're all on a journey are you with me I I I've been in business most of my life first of all I started out in the produce produce industry then I went into a grocery store and I was a I was a I was a butcher for seven years in the grocery store I would lead a couple of those people to to Jesus Christ man named Paul Harbor I led him to Jesus Christ he was one of the he was most caring guy that had ever been around and he got cancer and they burned him up with radiation and I walked into his room and he said it's the same as Jesus walking into this room to see me and that night I led him to the Lord Jesus Christ in my life I've met a lot of people you meet a lot of people in life you can't take the time to explain to him everything that you believe but if you just live it if you just create an atmosphere around you and once in a while say something that Jesus loves you and not only does he love you he loves them and before long you'll create an atmosphere to where that person will get thirsty you see we're all in a journey and let me just say this to you be very cautious you may be talking to a drunk run away predestinated seeds and where did God find you at and maybe you're you're you've got a lot of a ton of questions in your life and you may never get all those questions answered but if you fall in love with Jesus let me just say this you no man's in control God is the president might think he's in control what a mess we'd be in today Putin is not in control the pope is not in control we serve a god help me preach we serve a God that created the heavens and the Earth he created the smallest flea and the smallest organization and yet he is concerned about you by one man sin came and destroyed the human race but with by one man sin was destroyed in the form of Jesus Christ now you may have a lot of DNA issues in your life born different ways not everybody's an astronaut not everybody is a physicist not everybody's the greatest doctor in the land not everybody's the greatest athlete you may aspire to be a lot of those things but if you can ever get comfortable in your own skin and quit trying to impress everybody around you I'm preaching to you I'm preaching nuts and bolts today if you can never quit impressing everybody around you and impress him not everybody will love you I'm sending you a News Bulletin some people will be your very opposite there are people that will be sent into your life to offend you there will be people that hate you there will be people that are very jealous of you I found you those Spirits are allowed to come into your against you to develop you and that's why Jesus had to pray lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil because nobody can control your tongue like the Holy Ghost can't control your tongue brother Ron there's just times I feel like giving people a piece of my mind save it you need every cell that you got Give the Lord a great big hand s you could say more than five minutes and you can take back in a lifetime and you thought I was talking about your friends even your enemies I told them about your husband and your wife you get mad you get excited you get something listen what does it matter a little terrible comes in your life get over it people divorce over toothpaste how it's put on a toothbrush men that can't find a hamper that's a closed basket when you marry you

beautiful in the person like mine is you may have married into a busy body that knows it outspoken hold your tongue [Applause] if you live long enough they'll die good time for you to punch your wife or punch your neighbor up I can't believe I just said that Joel's Mom and Dad listen just it'll be all right it'll be all right take them to a good dinner tells the story here's some time ago the religions of the world met he said this they had this lady Maccabee from Oklahoma probably where these people came from sitting on the back row they arrested her and she was running through the streets driving a stage coach smoking a cigar breaking the speed limits with a stage coach you can you can tell this story is old and all the religions in the different religions raised up and they told their part of their religion and how great it was the Muhammad priest told how great his religion was and the Buddha told how great his religion was a certain little minister was representing the religion of America Christian religion and when it got when he got his time on the platform he told the story of this great foul woman how low down that she was until even they didn't want to get her around her even get close enough to even tar and feather her she was so immoral she was so degraded there was nothing that could help her and he said gentlemen religions of this world can your religion produce anything that would cleanse her hands and and and and cleanse her vowel person and everybody just sat still right on the end of their seats no one said nothing then he jumped up in the air and screamed clipped his heels together he said the blood of Jesus Christ won't only cleanse her hands but it'll clean her heart and make her pure as a lily that blood of Jesus Christ takes away sin and cleanses us of all of our iniquity and makes us a new creature in Christ Jesus there's nothing else will do it what will wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what will make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus all of us make choices and leads us down roads some choices takes people to prison some choices takes people to Mental Hospitals some choices place people in horrible marriages but I made a choice one night that I never thought I'd make I felt something pulling on my life and I took some steps those steps led me to the altar I've never looked back that's been over 40 years I've never looked back I've never needed a rehab I never needed a counseling session but Jesus came into my life there's been a lot of prayer meetings where I've had to get on my knees and say I'm sorry am I talking to you now there's been a lot of times in my life that I've disappointed myself maybe disappointed my friends and I know I disappointed Jesus but he didn't throw me in the street he didn't give up on me we served the kind of God that his grace is sufficient he's not looking at the beginning he's looking at the end [Applause] sometimes we look at a ugly little bird that bird is so ugly we don't know that that bird will grow up to be one of the most beautiful swans that ever lived he looked like an ugly duckling didn't walk right feathers didn't lay right he couldn't hold his head right but after a while he begins the mature and when he matures he has an inward Beauty he didn't go to class somewhere to get it it was in him all the time sometimes when you walk in church you've got a lot of scars and you got a lot of nastiness on you you got a lot of mud on you God don't throw you away he knows what's laying on the inside of you [Music] [Applause] inside of Moses why did Jonah what was laying inside the woman at the well what was laying lay inside of the Infidel on the porch well it's laying inside a burnt call what was laying inside of you Jesus made an astounding statement he said because I live you live also and my life will be in you in the works that I do you do also the church has got to get to the place he promised it would do it
