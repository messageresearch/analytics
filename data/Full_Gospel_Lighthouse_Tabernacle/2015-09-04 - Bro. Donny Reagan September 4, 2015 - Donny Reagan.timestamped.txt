[1:04:53] the splendor of a king
[1:04:59] o clothed in majesty
[1:05:04] let all the earth rejoice
[1:05:07] all the earth rejoice
[1:05:11] he wraps himself
[1:05:14] in light and
[1:05:17] darkness tries to hide and trembles at
[1:05:23] his voice and trembles at his voice
[1:05:28] how great is
[1:05:32] our god oh sing with me
[1:05:35] how great is our god
[1:05:39] and oh see how great
[1:05:44] how great is our god
[1:05:49] for he's the name above
[1:05:52] all names our god is worthy of
[1:05:58] our praise my
[1:06:02] heart will sing how great
[1:06:06] is our god
[1:06:10] how great is our god
[1:06:14] sing with me how great
[1:06:18] is our god hello see
[1:06:22] how great how great
[1:06:26] is our god
[1:06:32] hallelujah we can certainly say amen to
[1:06:36] that kin
[1:06:38] when we think of great we look at it
[1:06:42] quite different than the rest of the
[1:06:43] world would
[1:06:44] think of great because we know that
[1:06:46] greatness is expressed in humility
[1:06:50] god is so great that he could condense
[1:06:52] into such a place that
[1:06:55] mortals can comprehend it without a new
[1:06:57] birth
[1:06:58] because he's so big and they think great
[1:07:01] and great is how big and how
[1:07:03] gigantic his hands are and his eyes must
[1:07:05] be
[1:07:06] really really big and his hair really
[1:07:08] really big
[1:07:09] but when he comes to the earth a baby
[1:07:15] greatness is expressed in humility
[1:07:18] that's why the way up
[1:07:20] is down human beings can't relate to
[1:07:24] that
[1:07:25] without a new birth themself
[1:07:28] starting out if you would to the song of
[1:07:30] solomon chapter six verse eight
[1:07:34] what a privilege it is for us to be
[1:07:35] together here tonight such an honor
[1:07:38] for me to be able to be here with the
[1:07:41] saints you and the church and
[1:07:42] brother ron fraser be preaching with
[1:07:46] brother tim and all the other ministers
[1:07:47] that were here i told brother ron
[1:07:49] yesterday i felt like a
[1:07:51] water boy among five star generals so
[1:07:57] i don't say that to be humble either i
[1:07:58] say it because that's why i
[1:08:00] i look at it i think it's it's an honor
[1:08:03] some of the greatest men of god that
[1:08:05] live in this day
[1:08:06] call me their friend i count that's such
[1:08:10] a privilege
[1:08:11] i can remember whenever i was a little
[1:08:13] boy out on the
[1:08:15] playground at school wanting a friend
[1:08:18] whenever i growed up and got a little
[1:08:20] bit older and gave my heart to the lord
[1:08:22] and
[1:08:22] the boys at school tormented me and
[1:08:25] hated me and
[1:08:26] they'd bring pornographic magazines to
[1:08:28] school and they'd try to make me look at
[1:08:30] them and i'd close my eyes and they'd
[1:08:32] hold me down and take their fingers and
[1:08:34] open my eyes and
[1:08:36] hold them pictures in front of me and i
[1:08:38] was tormented
[1:08:40] never didn't have very many friends so
[1:08:42] i've got friends all the world today
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:48] i'm so grateful for that now maybe
[1:08:50] you've had friends all your life
[1:08:52] and people's always loved you then you
[1:08:53] wouldn't be able to appreciate that
[1:08:55] but i appreciate friends i appreciate
[1:08:58] your friends
[1:09:00] but tim was speaking to us last night
[1:09:01] and lord didn't do a great job
[1:09:03] tremendous job at the end of his
[1:09:06] thoughts he was pulling together who
[1:09:08] this is
[1:09:09] that is among us as far as isaac coming
[1:09:12] out to meet rebecca in the field
[1:09:14] so who is he that was among us tonight
[1:09:18] i'd like to
[1:09:19] speak to you on who is she
[1:09:22] who is she son of solomon chapter six
[1:09:26] verse eight
[1:09:28] there are therefore there are there
[1:09:32] three score queens and four score
[1:09:36] concubines and virgins
[1:09:39] was outnumbered my dove my undefiled
[1:09:44] is but one she is the only one of her
[1:09:47] mother
[1:09:49] she is the choice of her that bear her
[1:09:53] the daughters saw her and blessed her
[1:09:57] yea the queens and the concubines
[1:10:00] and they praised her now listen to this
[1:10:03] next verse
[1:10:05] who is she who is she
[1:10:09] that looketh forth as the morning
[1:10:13] fair as the moon clear
[1:10:16] as the sun terrible
[1:10:20] as an army with banners now listen it's
[1:10:22] a question
[1:10:24] who is she believe it or not this is a
[1:10:28] great crest question in the world of
[1:10:29] christendom today
[1:10:31] who is the bride is there a difference
[1:10:33] between the bride and the church are
[1:10:34] they all the same
[1:10:35] is there any difference who is she which
[1:10:37] one is she
[1:10:38] how do you get in to be a part of her
[1:10:41] who is she that look us for us as the
[1:10:43] morning
[1:10:44] fairs the moon clear as the sun
[1:10:47] terrible as an army with banners let's
[1:10:50] bury us together
[1:10:52] lord jesus we are so grateful tonight
[1:10:55] father that we can be
[1:10:56] gathered together here in this place
[1:10:58] with your children
[1:11:00] we counted a privilege to be with one
[1:11:02] another but more importantly than that
[1:11:04] we counted such an honor to be with you
[1:11:07] into this place that the supernatural of
[1:11:10] god has been
[1:11:11] so many many times over the years but
[1:11:13] yet we're asking once again
[1:11:15] that you would come among us lord that
[1:11:18] you would help us
[1:11:19] if you're here there's nothing we can
[1:11:21] face lord that will not be able to crest
[1:11:24] ever wave
[1:11:25] and make it through every trial so lord
[1:11:27] i'm asking you that you would help me
[1:11:30] would you come and use that part of
[1:11:32] yourself
[1:11:34] that you placed in my life called a gift
[1:11:36] i've studied i've prayed i've
[1:11:39] sought your mind and i pray that you
[1:11:41] would help me now that i can get out of
[1:11:43] the way
[1:11:44] but lord even if you used me and come
[1:11:46] and anointed that
[1:11:47] what good would it do if you don't use
[1:11:49] them to listen and to hear
[1:11:51] so would you anoint them and speak
[1:11:54] through me
[1:11:56] and may there be a cycle of the holy
[1:11:58] ghost that will be so formed here
[1:11:59] tonight
[1:12:00] lord you know the needs of your people
[1:12:02] and i'm sure there are many as we've
[1:12:04] gathered here
[1:12:05] but we know our god is greater than all
[1:12:06] of our needs speak to us tonight from
[1:12:09] your word father
[1:12:10] in jesus name we pray amen god bless you
[1:12:13] saints you may be seated
[1:12:16] i'd like to read to you from the
[1:12:19] ephesian church aids
[1:12:21] 80. the true church of jesus christ the
[1:12:25] bride is likened to
[1:12:27] pure gold her righteousness
[1:12:30] is his righteousness her attributes
[1:12:35] or his own glorious attributes
[1:12:38] her identity is found in him
[1:12:41] what he is she is to reflect
[1:12:46] what he has she is to
[1:12:49] manifest there is no
[1:12:52] fault in her
[1:12:56] and the saint said there is no fault in
[1:13:00] her now this is not
[1:13:01] humanly we know this is not us looking
[1:13:04] at ourselves this
[1:13:05] is not looking at one another but this
[1:13:08] is the way divinely
[1:13:09] that he looks at his elect she is all
[1:13:12] glorious
[1:13:13] within and without from beginning to
[1:13:16] ending
[1:13:16] she is the work of her lord and all his
[1:13:20] works
[1:13:21] are perfect now listen carefully with
[1:13:22] this in her
[1:13:24] is summed up and manifested
[1:13:27] the eternal wisdom and purpose
[1:13:31] of god in her listen this again
[1:13:34] in her is summed up and
[1:13:37] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:13:41] purpose
[1:13:41] of god how can one fathom it
[1:13:45] how can one understand it though we
[1:13:48] cannot do that
[1:13:49] we can accept it by face for god
[1:13:52] hath spoken do you believe that
[1:13:57] so who is she now if god
[1:14:00] had something in his mind that he wanted
[1:14:03] to declare a people that would
[1:14:05] be like him and we know that in the
[1:14:07] beginning he was the eternal he wasn't
[1:14:10] even god which is
[1:14:11] an object of worship brother man tells
[1:14:13] us in several places
[1:14:14] he said the first thing that i think
[1:14:16] that he made was angels
[1:14:18] then they began to worship him and he
[1:14:20] became god because
[1:14:22] god is an object of worship but before
[1:14:24] that
[1:14:25] he was the eternal but he had attributes
[1:14:28] in him
[1:14:28] that he desired to express but what if
[1:14:31] you were
[1:14:32] the eternal and you couldn't go any
[1:14:34] higher
[1:14:35] you couldn't go any wider you couldn't
[1:14:38] go
[1:14:38] any broader and there's only one way for
[1:14:41] you to expand yourself
[1:14:43] and that was the way of condensation
[1:14:46] god couldn't go any higher he couldn't
[1:14:48] go any broader there was no more wisdom
[1:14:50] there was no more intelligence higher
[1:14:52] than him
[1:14:53] but there was only one door that he left
[1:14:55] by which he would be able to expand
[1:14:58] himself
[1:14:58] and that was through condensation this
[1:15:01] is why i say greatness
[1:15:02] is expressed through god condensating
[1:15:05] himself
[1:15:06] which is the way a true christian finds
[1:15:08] a full expression of god in their own
[1:15:10] lives you see a
[1:15:12] a church or a preacher or an individual
[1:15:14] and they're all the time
[1:15:15] stepping on other people to make
[1:15:17] themselves higher you're going the exact
[1:15:19] opposite way of true christianity that's
[1:15:22] not the way the lord god done he did not
[1:15:24] step on anybody to give up
[1:15:26] he laid aside everything to come down
[1:15:28] and then go up
[1:15:29] and take us a prison now i want you to
[1:15:31] notice you know how that whenever the
[1:15:33] the king begins to describe the
[1:15:36] attributes of the bride
[1:15:37] are written in the song of solomon of
[1:15:39] course they hid in symbolic form
[1:15:41] but he says about her in verse 10 who is
[1:15:44] she that looketh forth
[1:15:45] as the morning now he likens the bride
[1:15:48] to the
[1:15:49] the breaking of the day now he does not
[1:15:52] liken her initially
[1:15:53] in the initial stages of her walk with
[1:15:56] him as she is the full strength
[1:15:58] of the sun or the moon shining in the
[1:16:01] new day or the illumination of the
[1:16:03] fullness of life
[1:16:05] but he says that she is as the morning
[1:16:08] so he likens her to the breaking of the
[1:16:11] morning all of those of you who have
[1:16:12] been up
[1:16:13] whenever the day begins to dawn it is
[1:16:15] the fading away
[1:16:17] of the night time and changing of
[1:16:18] dispensation from the night to the day
[1:16:20] and you have a hard time differentiating
[1:16:22] between the light and the darkness the
[1:16:25] day and the night why because
[1:16:26] the sun as we say is beginning to rise
[1:16:29] over the
[1:16:30] horizon it's beginning to break and many
[1:16:32] times as you look over
[1:16:33] they'll rise and you'll see it's it's
[1:16:35] turning real real red
[1:16:36] and the sun begins to peep up over it
[1:16:39] and there's still light
[1:16:40] and there's still darkness so he says
[1:16:42] that the bride
[1:16:43] is like the breaking of the morning
[1:16:45] that's the way it is
[1:16:46] with a person when they first get saved
[1:16:49] when they first come to god there's
[1:16:50] still
[1:16:51] mist around them all kinds of darkness
[1:16:53] all kinds of tradition
[1:16:55] that we're holding on to why because the
[1:16:57] morning is just beginning to break
[1:17:00] so it's as the morning you brothers are
[1:17:02] sitting a tree stand
[1:17:03] and you're you're hunting and you're
[1:17:04] waiting and the stillness of the
[1:17:06] darkness and you get in there
[1:17:07] and you wait and you wait and you begin
[1:17:09] to see the first breaking of the
[1:17:11] daylight the sun's not even up yet
[1:17:13] and yet you don't even see the sun but
[1:17:15] there's enough that's preluding
[1:17:17] what the sun is going to do and the
[1:17:18] light begins to break
[1:17:20] but you know what the darkness is still
[1:17:22] there
[1:17:23] but yet the light and the darkness are
[1:17:26] fighting and they're going back and
[1:17:27] forth
[1:17:28] because the dawn is beginning to break
[1:17:29] now he says who is
[1:17:31] she that looketh forth as the morning
[1:17:34] now this is her dawn
[1:17:35] this is when she begins to break forth
[1:17:38] but it is not in a strength it is not a
[1:17:40] light that can quick and see yet
[1:17:42] it is not a light that actually can
[1:17:44] begin to warm the earth
[1:17:45] it is the breaking force of light as our
[1:17:48] souls
[1:17:49] are born into the very presence of god
[1:17:52] our souls begin to begin to illuminate
[1:17:55] by ray after rey after ray of light
[1:17:58] god deals with us in a very slow
[1:18:01] progressive manner this is why
[1:18:03] that god continued to choose through
[1:18:05] four deaths messengers
[1:18:07] it would take it down to four life
[1:18:09] messengers
[1:18:10] the restoration would come back in the
[1:18:11] end time and that's why there's never
[1:18:13] been a light shining so bright
[1:18:15] as what you are in this hour now people
[1:18:18] can do whatever they want to do and say
[1:18:20] whatever they want to say
[1:18:21] and they can try to butcher our message
[1:18:23] and try to discredit it all they want to
[1:18:25] but we're walking on in the light and
[1:18:27] this word is going to change
[1:18:29] our bodies exactly right
[1:18:32] now the words these words describe the
[1:18:35] the progressive reflection of light as
[1:18:38] it breaks force in the dawn of the
[1:18:40] morning
[1:18:41] as the aurora or as these this venus
[1:18:44] as she begins to stand there in the
[1:18:46] night skies and she's eliminating it
[1:18:48] and notice it is the rise of the truth
[1:18:52] that becomes burst in the soul that's
[1:18:54] borne by the breath of god
[1:18:56] it's the same way so it begins to come
[1:18:58] forth i want you to notice in proverbs
[1:19:00] chapter 4 verse 18
[1:19:02] it says the path of the just is as the
[1:19:05] shining light
[1:19:06] that shine us more and more
[1:19:09] unto the perfect day aren't you glad
[1:19:12] that god deals with us in this
[1:19:14] progressive manner
[1:19:15] it was justification that made way for
[1:19:17] sanctification
[1:19:18] and sanctification made way for the
[1:19:20] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:22] and the baptism of the holy ghost made
[1:19:24] way for the holy ghost
[1:19:25] himself to be able to come what was it
[1:19:28] more
[1:19:28] and more light unto the perfect day
[1:19:31] my friends we are now in that time and
[1:19:34] of course the word perfect
[1:19:36] it's not sinlessness but it is a sign of
[1:19:38] maturity
[1:19:39] it is under that perfect light of
[1:19:42] malachi 4
[1:19:43] that the bride of jesus christ will
[1:19:45] shine forth
[1:19:46] and illuminate so much that it will
[1:19:48] force our bodies
[1:19:50] to be changed in a moment in the
[1:19:53] twinkling of an eye
[1:19:56] hallelujah hallelujah notice in judges
[1:20:00] chapter 5 verse 31
[1:20:01] so let all thine enemies perish o lord
[1:20:05] let them that love him be as the son
[1:20:08] when he goeth forth in his might now
[1:20:11] notice the church then
[1:20:13] is compared initially to the morning as
[1:20:16] it begins to break forth but as she
[1:20:18] grows
[1:20:19] in the progression of the word of god
[1:20:20] and the revelation of the light of the
[1:20:22] day
[1:20:23] she comes from the daytime whenever the
[1:20:25] night is still pressing
[1:20:27] and it's all pushing against her until
[1:20:29] she eventually begins to sign
[1:20:31] so in the light of god that she's
[1:20:33] likened unto the son himself
[1:20:35] so he said let all thine enemies perish
[1:20:37] o lord but let them that love him be
[1:20:40] as the son when he goeth forth
[1:20:43] in his might notice isaiah chapter 58
[1:20:46] verse 8
[1:20:47] then shall thy light break forth as the
[1:20:50] morning
[1:20:51] and thine health shall spring forth
[1:20:53] speedily and thy righteousness shall go
[1:20:55] before thee
[1:20:56] and the glory of the lord shall be thy
[1:20:58] reward
[1:21:00] notice how god has been dealing down to
[1:21:03] 2
[1:21:03] 000 years of church ages as the
[1:21:05] brilliance of the light would have come
[1:21:07] and if god had not orchestrated it in
[1:21:09] the perimeter of the boundaries of his
[1:21:11] word
[1:21:12] the first church would have took a
[1:21:13] rapture because they had enough
[1:21:16] original faith in the original word they
[1:21:19] could have took a rapture but god
[1:21:20] ordained that there would be seven
[1:21:23] church ages so he had to allow that seed
[1:21:25] to go down into the ground what was that
[1:21:28] see
[1:21:29] it was an alpha bride but what is the
[1:21:32] omega bright it is the same strength
[1:21:35] of that same word but we're not ordained
[1:21:38] to be buried
[1:21:39] we are ordained to rise we're not
[1:21:41] ordained hallelujah say go down into the
[1:21:44] ground
[1:21:45] but we are ordained of god for the
[1:21:48] combine
[1:21:49] not the plow we're not placed in the
[1:21:52] pile
[1:21:52] we're not facing the disc we are facing
[1:21:55] the combine
[1:21:56] that's going to pull us into the
[1:21:58] elevator of god
[1:22:01] oh what a glorious hour to be living in
[1:22:04] notice how he reveals the bride we know
[1:22:06] that the bride
[1:22:07] being married to the groom she must have
[1:22:10] multi aspects of her personage
[1:22:12] as he does you know the lord god has
[1:22:14] many aspects of his personage in the way
[1:22:17] that he reveals himself and he has a
[1:22:19] bride he's created abroad
[1:22:21] that is a multi-aspect individual and
[1:22:24] she has
[1:22:24] in her person it's many different things
[1:22:27] which are the traits of his own
[1:22:28] characteristics
[1:22:29] and she could only be this way by the
[1:22:32] act of the divine creator we know
[1:22:34] notice how he likens her here and again
[1:22:36] song of solomon chapter 6 verse 10
[1:22:38] who is she that looketh forth as the
[1:22:40] morning
[1:22:41] fair as the moon now he brings her from
[1:22:44] the breaking of the day
[1:22:45] and he brings her over to being likened
[1:22:47] unto the moon so she
[1:22:49] it's not only light the morning when the
[1:22:51] night and the day are beginning to
[1:22:52] to intermingle and the light is breaking
[1:22:54] forth but now he moves over and says
[1:22:57] that she is like
[1:22:58] the moon now notice this in genesis
[1:23:00] chapter 1 verse 15
[1:23:01] when god was actually placing the lights
[1:23:03] on the sky
[1:23:04] and he said let them be for lights in
[1:23:06] the firmament of the heaven
[1:23:08] to give light upon the earth and it will
[1:23:10] so and god made two
[1:23:12] great lights the greater light to rule
[1:23:15] the day and the lesser light to rule
[1:23:19] the night and he made the stars also and
[1:23:22] god didn't set them
[1:23:24] in the firmament of the heaven now the
[1:23:25] hebrew word you're fulfirmed
[1:23:27] is an expanse so god made an expanse
[1:23:31] and god placed this now this of course
[1:23:33] being the active original creation of
[1:23:35] god this is during the geological ages
[1:23:37] millions and millions of years ago no
[1:23:38] doubt
[1:23:39] but god began to place them there and
[1:23:40] when no one ever god began to move
[1:23:42] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[1:23:44] of god said let there be light
[1:23:46] this was not a creative act that god was
[1:23:48] doing
[1:23:49] but god was actually drying off the
[1:23:50] atmospheres brother tim preached about
[1:23:52] last night
[1:23:53] the seeds were laying on the earth from
[1:23:55] some former civilization
[1:23:57] right so what he said in the fourth seal
[1:23:59] they were laying here but god now speak
[1:24:01] and said let there be light
[1:24:03] not another created that by which he's
[1:24:05] creating the sun
[1:24:06] or the moon they were already brought
[1:24:08] into existence
[1:24:09] but now the atmosphere needed to be
[1:24:12] changed in order for the power of the
[1:24:14] sun
[1:24:14] to activate the seas that were laying on
[1:24:16] the earth
[1:24:17] you know what god was doing god was
[1:24:19] giving the earth a new verse
[1:24:21] that was your type amen it was a type of
[1:24:24] a human being
[1:24:25] an individual that would be born by the
[1:24:27] spirit of god you had a seed in you from
[1:24:30] a former civilization
[1:24:32] you did not live as a man or woman but
[1:24:34] you were in the mind of god
[1:24:37] and god said in your age let there be
[1:24:40] light and there was light where was
[1:24:44] that light it come from the word of god
[1:24:46] and shine on your soul
[1:24:47] [Applause]
[1:24:53] verse 18 says to rule over the day and
[1:24:56] rule over the night and divide
[1:24:58] to divide to divide
[1:25:01] the light from the darkness and god saw
[1:25:04] that it was good
[1:25:05] brother says it this way the moon and
[1:25:07] the sun
[1:25:09] is husband and wife and while the sun
[1:25:12] is gone away it throws its light against
[1:25:16] the moon to give us a smaller light
[1:25:19] until the sun comes
[1:25:20] when the sun comes the moon fades out
[1:25:24] the church is the light of the world
[1:25:25] until jesus comes and then
[1:25:27] it melts all together like the moon
[1:25:30] night
[1:25:30] and the sunlight becomes one light
[1:25:33] together
[1:25:34] when christ and his church comes
[1:25:36] together
[1:25:37] at the great millennium they emerge into
[1:25:40] one
[1:25:41] now who is she though who is she how do
[1:25:44] you get injured he's just going
[1:25:47] oh you put your name on the book
[1:25:48] somewhere who is she
[1:25:50] she is the elect of god
[1:25:53] she is not our choice i choose to be bro
[1:25:56] you don't choose to be bright
[1:25:57] he chose us before the foundation of the
[1:26:00] world and there ain't enough devils in
[1:26:02] hell
[1:26:02] there ain't enough laws and congress
[1:26:05] president our senate
[1:26:07] nobody else will ever change that it is
[1:26:10] god's orchestration not ours
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] but friends i realize a lot of folks
[1:26:16] look at predestination
[1:26:18] as only a doctrine i look at it as an
[1:26:20] attribute of my daddy
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:23] predestination is not just a doctrine to
[1:26:26] me it's one of my father's attributes
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:29] watch this again brother ram tells us in
[1:26:31] hebrews the moon is the shadow of the
[1:26:33] sun
[1:26:34] and the sun just reflects its light when
[1:26:37] it's behind the earth and the moon gives
[1:26:40] light to walk by night now this is what
[1:26:42] you and i
[1:26:43] are in the evil age we're living why is
[1:26:45] it then that sin
[1:26:46] is still so predominant because we are
[1:26:49] moonlight
[1:26:50] not sunlight now we look out here in the
[1:26:53] dam whenever the sun comes out
[1:26:55] it makes no difference how much darkness
[1:26:56] is sharing there and there the sun
[1:26:58] is the king of light so it expels all
[1:27:00] the darkness yet whenever you and i
[1:27:02] are shining in this day look at all the
[1:27:04] sin look at all the darkness it's worse
[1:27:07] now that it's ever appeared
[1:27:08] we are here to rule the night not change
[1:27:11] tonight
[1:27:12] we will not change it they'll go right
[1:27:14] on passing walls
[1:27:15] contrary to god's word they will press
[1:27:18] against us
[1:27:18] but we are still ruling the night
[1:27:23] you say how can you say that because i
[1:27:25] know the word
[1:27:26] is right
[1:27:28] [Applause]
[1:27:31] hallelujah
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:35] notice he said christ represents the son
[1:27:38] and the church represents the moon
[1:27:40] the husband and wife in the absence of
[1:27:42] christ the church reflects the minor
[1:27:45] light
[1:27:45] it's light to walk in until the sunlight
[1:27:49] will appear the moon is part of the sun
[1:27:53] and the church said and y'all ever seen
[1:27:56] any picture of those rocks that they
[1:27:57] brought from the moon
[1:28:01] i'm not sure what you thought they'd
[1:28:02] look like but for me i kind of thought
[1:28:04] to be a luminescent maybe and it shine a
[1:28:07] little bit
[1:28:07] but it looked just like a rock out of
[1:28:09] virginia
[1:28:12] looked just like a rock out of tennessee
[1:28:13] or louisiana because
[1:28:15] it has no illumination on its own
[1:28:19] it's just like a piece of dirt just like
[1:28:22] a piece of dirt like me and like you
[1:28:25] makes the glory of god around this bride
[1:28:27] we look just like any other hillbilly
[1:28:29] out of virginia tennessee
[1:28:31] it's not us it's the light of the sound
[1:28:34] that shines on our souls
[1:28:37] that's what makes us above other people
[1:28:40] not us within ourselves
[1:28:42] [Applause]
[1:28:47] i love this and question answer 64. i
[1:28:49] hope this don't stumble you
[1:28:51] brother man said this person that's in
[1:28:52] you it's your birth
[1:28:55] you're john doe you were born into
[1:28:58] certain months
[1:29:00] under a certain star and that has
[1:29:03] something to do with you
[1:29:06] certainly it does that's your best pass
[1:29:10] right it's your birth path now he says i
[1:29:14] know papa used to say
[1:29:16] you can't plant them potatoes at this
[1:29:18] time because the moon isn't right
[1:29:21] you can't plant them potatoes billy and
[1:29:23] i'm said
[1:29:24] i'm not planting them in the moon i'm
[1:29:26] planting them in the ground
[1:29:29] now he said go ahead smart alec
[1:29:34] but it's helping you get a few bumps on
[1:29:36] your heads you learn something
[1:29:38] you take a board and lay it down out
[1:29:40] there in the grass
[1:29:41] in the dark of the moon and watch what
[1:29:44] happens
[1:29:45] the grass will die right now
[1:29:48] but lay it in the light of the moon
[1:29:51] and let it lay there for a week and it
[1:29:54] won't hurt it
[1:29:57] now how can this be considering that the
[1:30:00] sun
[1:30:00] or the moon rather averages 238 thousand
[1:30:06] 555 miles
[1:30:08] away from the earth that's just on
[1:30:11] average sometimes more sometimes less
[1:30:16] so according to the way the moon
[1:30:20] is 200 and almost 40 000 miles
[1:30:23] from the earth if you lay aboard at a
[1:30:26] certain time
[1:30:28] it'll change it
[1:30:32] now explain that to me will you you have
[1:30:35] 10 minutes
[1:30:38] you can't but we believe it
[1:30:42] and accept it right
[1:30:46] hello watch brother baby says
[1:30:51] you watch the sea when the moon changes
[1:30:54] when the moon goes out the tide follows
[1:30:57] it out
[1:30:58] and it's oh my millions of miles from
[1:31:01] the earth
[1:31:02] you go down in the state of kentucky and
[1:31:05] sink a rod on that drilling now for all
[1:31:07] till you hit salt water and watch that
[1:31:10] pipe
[1:31:11] how deep it is in the moon and when the
[1:31:13] tide's in watch it go
[1:31:15] out you plant something that spreads on
[1:31:17] the top of the earth
[1:31:18] and the dark of the moon and watch it go
[1:31:21] right down
[1:31:22] like a radish or a turnip you plant it
[1:31:25] back on there and watch it spread on top
[1:31:27] of the earth
[1:31:29] what's it got to do with the moon she
[1:31:32] has
[1:31:33] invisible ordinances and laws
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:38] get her by god not because she's
[1:31:42] brilliant
[1:31:43] not because she's awareness she's god's
[1:31:46] spoken word
[1:31:50] praise the lord
[1:31:53] hallelujah psalms 104 verse 19
[1:31:57] he appointed the moon for seasons
[1:32:03] he appointed the moon for seasons i
[1:32:06] thought the seasons were on the earth
[1:32:09] but the heavenly objects that god
[1:32:12] ordained and orchestrated around the
[1:32:14] laws of the earth
[1:32:16] actually what dictate her seasons and
[1:32:18] cycles
[1:32:19] upon the earth so we have a heavenly
[1:32:23] counterpart which influences what goes
[1:32:26] on on this earth
[1:32:28] every day of our life you ever wonder
[1:32:31] why they call people lunatics
[1:32:36] i'm not saying that to be funny now you
[1:32:38] know where that word comes from lunar
[1:32:40] moon
[1:32:43] you ever wonder why that births are
[1:32:45] timed with the new moons
[1:32:50] you ever look at the moon signs in the
[1:32:51] body and certain surgeries and certain
[1:32:53] things that take place
[1:32:55] in your body now y'all think i'm an
[1:32:57] astrologist
[1:33:03] now watch this is what god said he
[1:33:05] appointed the moon
[1:33:06] for season so the moon is set there
[1:33:10] to divide times the moon
[1:33:13] is con earth and her
[1:33:17] influence thousands and hundreds of
[1:33:19] thousands of miles away
[1:33:21] yet she affects the cycles on the earth
[1:33:24] let me tell you something for him
[1:33:26] wars and all these different things that
[1:33:28] have come down to the ages
[1:33:29] the church ages did not follow the wars
[1:33:32] the wars followed the church
[1:33:34] one of these days you're going to
[1:33:35] realize if you don't already it's not
[1:33:37] been the world out here in the bride and
[1:33:39] the church
[1:33:40] kind of following around as a follow
[1:33:42] behind oh no
[1:33:45] lack of god by which seasons are
[1:33:47] appointed
[1:33:48] not the
[1:33:50] [Applause]
[1:33:53] hallelujah this world needs me
[1:33:59] this crazy world needs you don't take
[1:34:02] that but why do we leave it'll really
[1:34:04] fall apart
[1:34:06] [Applause]
[1:34:09] hallelujah so he appointed the moon
[1:34:13] for seasons now how is it then that god
[1:34:16] whenever he placed the earth and he knew
[1:34:18] that man would fall now we know this is
[1:34:22] in the universe that actually fell when
[1:34:26] man
[1:34:26] fell so there's millions and millions
[1:34:29] of other planets oh my they're keep
[1:34:32] expanding and going on and on and on
[1:34:35] with all that they're finding in the
[1:34:36] universe
[1:34:37] with the hubble telescope and there are
[1:34:39] millions and millions of worlds and well
[1:34:42] they looked at it
[1:34:43] back in the 50s and 60s and they're
[1:34:44] looking out through there and thinking
[1:34:46] they
[1:34:46] they've thought that saw the very end of
[1:34:48] the universe 120 million years of life
[1:34:51] space
[1:34:51] and now they've gone way beyond that the
[1:34:54] prophet said that's only a sixteenth of
[1:34:56] an inch in eternity
[1:34:59] and they're looking out to see but yet
[1:35:00] there's only one planet that fell when
[1:35:03] adam fell
[1:35:04] the universe is exactly the way it was
[1:35:07] when god created it in the beginning
[1:35:10] why did this planet only fall because
[1:35:13] here was where god put his son
[1:35:16] and everything under the dominion of
[1:35:18] that son
[1:35:19] fell but mars was not under his dominion
[1:35:22] or jupiter under his dominion or the sun
[1:35:25] or the moon
[1:35:26] on the earth and this book right here my
[1:35:29] friends
[1:35:30] this book right here mentions what point
[1:35:32] it by name
[1:35:33] earth earth's name is written in the
[1:35:36] book
[1:35:37] of life that's why god cannot destroy
[1:35:40] the earth
[1:35:41] he must redeem the earth
[1:35:45] hallelujah
[1:35:48] find mars in your bible find jupiter in
[1:35:52] your bible
[1:35:56] some astronaut long ago said you think
[1:35:58] your life on other planets i said well i
[1:35:59] really don't know there could be
[1:36:01] but one thing i do know when it's all
[1:36:02] said and done we get the king
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:07] he chose to make his home here not only
[1:36:10] that he chose to take his own human body
[1:36:12] out of here
[1:36:14] and he chose to take your body out of
[1:36:16] here
[1:36:17] hallelujah
[1:36:22] the foundation of the divisions
[1:36:25] of the year what we call months
[1:36:29] is synchronized with the cycles of the
[1:36:32] moon
[1:36:36] israel would have their beginning of
[1:36:37] their months and it would begin with
[1:36:40] new moons so the moon
[1:36:44] synchronized the ages the times the
[1:36:47] breaking of events
[1:36:49] oh hallelujah notice jeremiah 31 35 thus
[1:36:53] saith the lord
[1:36:55] which giveth the sun for a light by day
[1:36:58] and the ordinances of the moon
[1:37:02] the ordinances of the moon you all know
[1:37:05] any of them
[1:37:09] you see this is only deity architect
[1:37:11] speaking here
[1:37:14] we know he's got them but we don't know
[1:37:16] exactly what they are
[1:37:18] so there's ordinances you know like a
[1:37:19] city ordinance when you go through a
[1:37:21] city and you say and i have
[1:37:23] according to an ordinance so and so and
[1:37:24] so you cannot use a break on your truck
[1:37:27] and you can't go over some out and you
[1:37:29] can't touch your horn and you can't do
[1:37:31] that what is that that is a city
[1:37:32] ordinance according to elton virginia
[1:37:35] so that you come through there and they
[1:37:37] catch you doing that
[1:37:38] ah yes what they're going to give you a
[1:37:40] ticket well god
[1:37:41] designed and set aside ordinances to the
[1:37:44] moon
[1:37:45] and here we are living down on the earth
[1:37:47] and we know that there but we really
[1:37:48] have no idea
[1:37:50] and we're just living by day by day by
[1:37:52] day under the influence
[1:37:53] and they say oh what in the world would
[1:37:55] the moon what difference would it make
[1:37:56] if the moon wasn't there
[1:37:58] the earth would stand upside down should
[1:38:01] spin like this
[1:38:02] should spin like that because the moon
[1:38:04] is what keeps the earth
[1:38:06] from tilting in a wild bizarre rotation
[1:38:09] do you understand what's keeping this
[1:38:11] world from not being any worse than it
[1:38:14] is
[1:38:14] it is the bride it is she who
[1:38:17] is she who is she
[1:38:21] that has such power that satan cannot
[1:38:24] take over till she's gone
[1:38:36] now let me give you a little bit of
[1:38:37] science the ocean on the side of the
[1:38:40] earth
[1:38:42] facing the moon gets pulled toward the
[1:38:45] moon
[1:38:46] more than it does the center of the
[1:38:47] planet
[1:38:49] now the gravitational pull in the earth
[1:38:52] is what keeps the water on it
[1:38:55] i'm sure you've seen pictures of the
[1:38:57] earth made by nasa and hubble and all
[1:38:59] that
[1:39:00] and whenever you stand and look at it
[1:39:02] here's the earth and this great
[1:39:05] beautiful circle like this and here's
[1:39:07] africa down here
[1:39:09] in india over there and you think how
[1:39:12] are they on the bottom of that ball
[1:39:15] and yet they're standing upright
[1:39:19] how are they standing there not falling
[1:39:21] off
[1:39:23] and then when you shift around and you
[1:39:25] go around like this and then you're down
[1:39:27] on the bottom
[1:39:28] and you think well which way is up
[1:39:31] are you up are they up are they down are
[1:39:34] you
[1:39:34] how in the world now we could understand
[1:39:36] it if it was out there like a flat
[1:39:38] surface but it's a ball
[1:39:39] hallelujah and our lord god knew that
[1:39:42] man would fall
[1:39:43] and he made the earth with enough grace
[1:39:46] that he knew when the earth was standing
[1:39:48] like this in the beginning
[1:39:49] and when man would fall the earth would
[1:39:52] tilt over on its axis 23 and a half
[1:39:54] degrees
[1:39:54] there was enough grace from standing
[1:39:57] upside like this
[1:39:58] when it tilted over on 23 and a half
[1:40:00] degrees that it would not fall or
[1:40:02] explode or bust apart
[1:40:04] hallelujah the grace of god already knew
[1:40:07] it before man was ever made
[1:40:09] he knew the earth needed an element of
[1:40:11] grace
[1:40:17] who is she it's his counterpart
[1:40:24] now watch this i find this amazing the
[1:40:25] ocean on the side of the earth
[1:40:27] facing the moon gets pulled toward the
[1:40:30] moon
[1:40:30] than it does the center of the planet
[1:40:32] yet gravity is what holds the ocean
[1:40:35] now remember the arctic and the
[1:40:36] antarctic and yet it's on the bottom of
[1:40:39] the ball
[1:40:41] why don't it all just fall off
[1:40:46] when you go home get you a ball when you
[1:40:48] kiss balls baseball
[1:40:50] basketball soccer ball whatever put
[1:40:52] water on it
[1:40:54] and see if you can make it hold
[1:40:59] most of you ain't gonna try because you
[1:41:01] know what the answer is but how does
[1:41:03] this ball
[1:41:04] hang out down the universe with all
[1:41:06] these billions and billions of gallons
[1:41:08] of water hanging upside down
[1:41:11] and they don't fall off
[1:41:16] if we could hear the atlantic and the
[1:41:18] pacific and the indian and the antarctic
[1:41:20] and all these oceans
[1:41:21] we'd hear them singing i feel the pool
[1:41:28] what holds them to the earth gravitation
[1:41:32] the law of god it's invisible and yet
[1:41:34] they don't have a brain they don't have
[1:41:36] a free moral agency
[1:41:37] they don't have a choice and yet they
[1:41:39] hug right there to the earth
[1:41:41] hallelujah but god made enough give
[1:41:45] in the ocean that when the moon moves
[1:41:47] around at a certain cycle
[1:41:49] and the oceans begin to face the moon
[1:41:54] the pool on the from the moon begins to
[1:41:56] pull the water
[1:42:05] what is it the tides rising
[1:42:09] if god can move on a dumb bunch of water
[1:42:12] what will the holy ghost do when it
[1:42:14] moves on a predestinated city
[1:42:17] hallelujah brother brady that water
[1:42:19] can't say no
[1:42:20] that water can't say ouch the water
[1:42:22] can't say i'll help you lord
[1:42:23] but it's a pool beyond itself it's
[1:42:26] something that's pulling the water
[1:42:28] the water can't read the law the water
[1:42:30] can't read the ordinance about the moon
[1:42:32] but it's simply being pulled oh
[1:42:34] hallelujah i'll tell you one thing devil
[1:42:36] do what you're gonna do but she ain't
[1:42:38] gonna stop this bride
[1:42:40] she's ordained of god to stand for this
[1:42:42] word and there is
[1:42:44] nothing that will stop her she
[1:42:47] is an invincible army that's who she is
[1:43:01] and the moon's out there
[1:43:05] she makes no great noises has no light
[1:43:08] on her of her own
[1:43:11] her atmosphere is so thin the extremity
[1:43:14] of her temperatures
[1:43:16] are 400 degrees difference in a day's
[1:43:18] time
[1:43:21] her atmosphere around her is so thin
[1:43:24] that a footprint on the moon can be
[1:43:27] there for hundreds of years
[1:43:31] because there's no storms there to touch
[1:43:36] here
[1:43:43] the ocean on the side of the earth
[1:43:45] facing the moon gets pulled toward the
[1:43:47] moon
[1:43:48] more than the center of the planet this
[1:43:50] creates a high tide
[1:43:52] on the other side of the earth
[1:43:56] another high tide occurs because the
[1:44:00] center of the earth
[1:44:01] is being pulled toward the moon more
[1:44:04] than the ocean on the other side
[1:44:07] so here you've got the water on this
[1:44:09] side being pulled by the moon
[1:44:10] and the water on the other side nearly
[1:44:12] 25 000 miles around on the other side
[1:44:16] and it's been pulled by the moon too
[1:44:19] and it don't know what to do except just
[1:44:21] follow the pool
[1:44:23] so up and down the coast of south
[1:44:25] carolina georgia north carolina
[1:44:27] up in new brunswick and wherever more
[1:44:28] than it is it just begins to go in and
[1:44:31] out and what does it do
[1:44:32] it's done it for millennia i said it's
[1:44:34] done it for millennia
[1:44:35] in and out why the ordinance of the moon
[1:44:38] is
[1:44:39] controlling it oh hallelujah brother
[1:44:41] sister let me tell you there's come at a
[1:44:42] time and i don't think it's going to be
[1:44:44] long
[1:44:44] when god's going to take the moon out of
[1:44:46] this world
[1:44:48] and the effects of the moon on this
[1:44:50] world we're the only thing
[1:44:51] that's keeping it from going totally
[1:44:53] insane right now
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:45:01] oh hallelujah
[1:45:05] perhaps the most important effect of the
[1:45:07] moon scientists say
[1:45:11] is the way it stabilizes the rotation of
[1:45:15] the earth
[1:45:16] when the earth rotates it wobbles
[1:45:21] back and forth on its axis like a top
[1:45:26] which simply doesn't stand in a vertical
[1:45:28] position now if you've got a top and
[1:45:30] when your children's top and you sit
[1:45:32] down you sit there and pump it
[1:45:33] and it says right on it's in it's made
[1:45:34] to pivot on one end but remember that
[1:45:36] earth had to fall
[1:45:40] can't you see why the earth's growing
[1:45:41] it's wanting to get back up again
[1:45:45] hallelujah the earth in the original
[1:45:47] creation was not made to tilt over like
[1:45:50] this
[1:45:50] that's the way it is with you if you're
[1:45:52] out of fellowship with god
[1:45:53] and you're 23 and a half degrees or 45
[1:45:56] degrees or 109 degrees out of fellowship
[1:45:58] you wouldn't make the wobble like that
[1:46:00] you wasn't made to be drinking and
[1:46:02] running around and smoking
[1:46:04] and acting like the devil oh no you were
[1:46:06] made to stand upright as a son or
[1:46:08] daughter of god
[1:46:09] and rotating the perfect obedience to
[1:46:12] the word
[1:46:14] think of our lives what we were before
[1:46:16] god
[1:46:17] put us in contact with the ministry of
[1:46:20] the moon
[1:46:23] hallelujah look a lot of these people
[1:46:24] that are pulling away from the message
[1:46:26] and look at what's happened to them
[1:46:28] they're topsy-turvy they're wobbling
[1:46:30] they don't know what way's up which way
[1:46:31] is there thank god for a good holy ghost
[1:46:34] ministry
[1:46:35] and a good holy ghost church
[1:46:38] amen why would we be without it
[1:46:48] oh hallelujah so you imagine she's
[1:46:53] and tilted half degrees so the north
[1:46:55] pole in the
[1:46:56] south pole on her axis she's spinning
[1:46:59] but she isn't spinning it perfect so she
[1:47:02] wobbles
[1:47:03] every now and then
[1:47:07] so god put the moon out there and said
[1:47:09] now you watch her
[1:47:11] when she goes to wobbling real bad exert
[1:47:14] some of your power
[1:47:16] on her
[1:47:19] so the earth goes to wobbling and
[1:47:22] wobbling
[1:47:23] and the moon through an invisible union
[1:47:30] through the spoken word the gravitation
[1:47:33] begins to pulsate from the moon and it
[1:47:36] straightens donny out i mean the earth
[1:47:38] out
[1:47:40] don't stop don't look at me like you
[1:47:41] don't need no straightening it out every
[1:47:42] now and then
[1:47:44] every one of us whether or preachers or
[1:47:46] deacons or whatever we are
[1:47:47] we get to wobbling around in life a
[1:47:49] little bit and we go to getting kind of
[1:47:51] crooked turning around oh
[1:47:53] my and what does god do he'll lay some
[1:47:55] sermon on some man of god's heart
[1:47:57] oh it'll come and baron our high what's
[1:48:00] it doing is straighten us back up
[1:48:01] or we can rotate around the world
[1:48:05] where we can rotate around god's word
[1:48:10] can't you see why satan hates god
[1:48:12] calling it
[1:48:19] satan loves this bunch of modern day
[1:48:21] compromising jelly backbone preachers
[1:48:24] [Applause]
[1:48:26] do whatever you want to do we don't want
[1:48:29] to make nobody mad
[1:48:32] jellyfish
[1:48:33] [Applause]
[1:48:40] i was wobbling enough before i got saved
[1:48:43] i'd certainly like to calm down some of
[1:48:44] my wobbling after i've become a
[1:48:46] christian with you
[1:48:53] when the earth rotates it wobbles
[1:48:56] slightly
[1:48:56] back and forth now you imagine here you
[1:48:59] are out
[1:49:00] in the middle of the universe on this
[1:49:03] great globe
[1:49:04] and we're spinning around now friends
[1:49:07] how is it that we're spinning around
[1:49:09] as fast as we are and none of y'all
[1:49:11] ain't sick
[1:49:15] everyone think about it it's
[1:49:16] mind-boggling
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:24] we can't even tell we're moving
[1:49:30] you see in the days of christopher
[1:49:31] columbus they thought it was flat
[1:49:34] but he looked out through yonder and he
[1:49:36] saw something different
[1:49:38] he could see the top of the mast of the
[1:49:40] ship before he'd see the ship and he
[1:49:42] said it can't be flat
[1:49:44] because if it's flat i should be able to
[1:49:45] see it all the same
[1:49:47] so it let him know there was a curvature
[1:49:49] to the earth
[1:49:50] he had no scriptures to go by he had no
[1:49:54] prophets quotes to go by but he had
[1:49:56] something driving him to say there's a
[1:49:58] new world
[1:50:00] there's a new world i know there's got
[1:50:01] to be people said you're going to fall
[1:50:03] off the end of the earth
[1:50:04] you're going to go crazy there ain't no
[1:50:05] way in the world i believe god ordained
[1:50:08] that men to do what he did amen i needed
[1:50:10] to live in tennessee
[1:50:12] you needed to live in virginia or
[1:50:13] louisiana wherever you're from
[1:50:16] god had some attributes amen he wanted
[1:50:19] to express
[1:50:19] over here and he had to bring elijah
[1:50:22] from this continent on the earth
[1:50:24] so there had to be a man of vision that
[1:50:26] would break beyond the skeptics
[1:50:34] oh i'm so glad god sent us another one
[1:50:36] in this day
[1:50:42] it's like a top which doesn't spin in a
[1:50:45] vertical position on a table or floor
[1:50:48] but without the moon would be wobbling
[1:50:51] much more
[1:50:52] with no moon as a stabilizer the earth
[1:50:54] would sometimes tilt
[1:50:56] all the way back
[1:51:02] here she is 240
[1:51:05] 000 miles away and what keeps this earth
[1:51:09] from turning upside down
[1:51:12] is the ordinance of the moon who is she
[1:51:17] oh she's not very brilliant man has
[1:51:20] walked on her
[1:51:26] man ever walked on the sun man never
[1:51:30] ever landed a rocket on the sun
[1:51:32] but he's walked all over the moon took
[1:51:34] pictures of the moon make fun of color
[1:51:36] this and that and the other come on
[1:51:38] sheldon
[1:51:38] let them go ahead and walk all over this
[1:51:40] bride walk all over the moon
[1:51:42] let them do whatever they want to do but
[1:51:44] god's fixing the rights of this bride
[1:51:46] god's fixing to take her into his glory
[1:51:48] and he will clown her queen
[1:51:51] he amen he will clown her
[1:51:55] queen because in her humility
[1:51:58] she reflected the son
[1:52:01] not herself not our own agenda
[1:52:05] it's an ordinance and every
[1:52:07] predestinated seed of god
[1:52:10] to give him the glory
[1:52:19] oh god listen to this if the earth
[1:52:23] would tilt on its axis the orbit around
[1:52:27] it this would make for extreme
[1:52:29] differences
[1:52:30] between temperatures and daylight
[1:52:32] throughout the year
[1:52:33] and what controls it the moon
[1:52:37] so if the moon was not there the extreme
[1:52:40] variety of the temperatures
[1:52:43] and the wobbling of the earth and the
[1:52:45] lengths of the days
[1:52:51] you understand what causes the length of
[1:52:53] the days on the earth
[1:52:55] the moon
[1:53:00] how long will this age go out the moon
[1:53:02] will dictate that
[1:53:05] the readiness of the church
[1:53:11] however long it needed to propagate the
[1:53:13] message of luther over the earth
[1:53:14] that's how god longed god but let it go
[1:53:16] however long it's needed to reach the
[1:53:18] methodist that's how long god will let
[1:53:20] it go
[1:53:21] not timing it according to napoleon not
[1:53:23] pounding it according to some great
[1:53:25] leader somewhere
[1:53:26] but according to the dictates of the
[1:53:28] needs of the moon
[1:53:29] however long we need to reach that last
[1:53:32] seed that's how long we'll stay here
[1:53:35] it ain't got nothing to do with obama it
[1:53:37] ain't got nothing to do with the
[1:53:38] congress or senate they
[1:53:40] can't pass a law to delay the rapture or
[1:53:42] speed it up
[1:53:43] it ain't based on them it's based on the
[1:53:46] ministry of the moon
[1:53:48] who is she who is she
[1:53:59] if it wasn't for the effect of the moon
[1:54:01] the earth would be like this
[1:54:04] then she could be like this then she
[1:54:06] could do a total flip
[1:54:08] and be like that
[1:54:11] sounds like us before we first got saved
[1:54:17] don't you realize why we was in such
[1:54:19] chaos
[1:54:20] and then people want to take this away
[1:54:22] from me
[1:54:29] brother donny i don't understand this
[1:54:31] and that another i i understand what
[1:54:32] you're saying you don't understand
[1:54:34] cause there's lots of things i don't
[1:54:36] understand but i know one thing i'm
[1:54:38] better off right now than where i've
[1:54:39] ever been in my life before
[1:54:41] maybe some of you want to go to bad this
[1:54:43] method is pentecost that's up to you i
[1:54:45] was in pentecost
[1:54:47] oh yeah i wasn't preaching the big tents
[1:54:48] i was under big ministries and on
[1:54:50] television and this that and the other
[1:54:51] but all the time there's some dynamic
[1:54:53] brother ron i knew there had to be more
[1:54:55] and it wasn't miracles that got my sign
[1:54:57] up brother random i saw them at
[1:54:58] pentecost
[1:54:59] i prayed for the for the cross eyes and
[1:55:01] they straightened out in pentecost
[1:55:03] i prayed for cancers i prayed for tumors
[1:55:05] i've seen all kinds of miracles and
[1:55:07] pentecost
[1:55:07] that wasn't what got my attention it was
[1:55:09] the message from that prophet's mouth
[1:55:12] hallelujah it was what the rest of the
[1:55:15] world said oh it's a bunch of holy
[1:55:16] rollers but i looked at it and saw
[1:55:18] it's an ordinance of god
[1:55:20] [Applause]
[1:55:28] you see well all these defectors look at
[1:55:30] it all these do's and don'ts
[1:55:33] can't go here can't go there can't do
[1:55:35] this can't do that
[1:55:37] they look at it as prison walls
[1:55:41] i look at it as castle walls
[1:55:46] i'm in the castle of my king i'm not i'm
[1:55:49] not hell to prison or i'm here because i
[1:55:51] want to be
[1:55:52] oh hallelujah hold on message people
[1:55:55] they can't do this
[1:55:56] and they came to the and they can't go
[1:55:58] here they're held behind
[1:56:00] that wall this is my castle
[1:56:03] hallelujah this is my castle it is not a
[1:56:07] prison to me
[1:56:08] i am not a prisoner held back by do's

[1:56:16] because i love him
[1:56:30] people say how can you folks be free
[1:56:33] when you got all this
[1:56:34] list of do's and don'ts
[1:56:37] how can you all be free living in
[1:56:39] america in a democracy
[1:56:43] and yet if you own a piece of property
[1:56:44] that's in the certain zone
[1:56:46] you can't build any type of building you
[1:56:47] want to on it
[1:56:50] and you tell me you're free how come we
[1:56:56] have to pay income tax and then then
[1:56:57] people are praying white house is one
[1:56:59] spends our taxes
[1:57:01] now are you free or not well yeah i've
[1:57:04] been in china you're free compared to
[1:57:05] them
[1:57:07] so let me ask you if you build a nice
[1:57:09] house and you go into a certain
[1:57:10] subdivision
[1:57:11] and they got restrictions in that
[1:57:12] subdivision they can only build a house
[1:57:14] a certain certain size
[1:57:15] it got to be so-and-so can't have a hog
[1:57:16] a lot of dog lot a pig lot of bird lock
[1:57:18] all kinds of chickens and gooses and all
[1:57:20] that sort of thing hanging around you
[1:57:21] around these
[1:57:22] million dollar houses
[1:57:25] now what if they didn't have them in
[1:57:27] this real high dollar subdivision
[1:57:29] and some poor old boy pulls a single
[1:57:31] wide trailer in there
[1:57:32] in between a million and a half dollar
[1:57:34] house and a two million dollar house
[1:57:36] and he pulls up his chickens and his
[1:57:38] homes his hounds and his dogs
[1:57:40] and his hogs and his pigs and his sows
[1:57:42] and everything else and that
[1:57:43] neighborhood is smelled up now we ask
[1:57:45] you something do you figure them folks
[1:57:46] in there
[1:57:47] are so under bondage oh we can't have
[1:57:49] hogs in our subdivision oh
[1:57:53] they are so glad why those restrictions
[1:57:57] protect them my sisters the do's and the
[1:58:01] don'ts of this message
[1:58:02] it is not bondage it's protecting you
[1:58:05] from tribulation period
[1:58:07] it's keeping you from being thrown into
[1:58:10] a bed
[1:58:11] of tribulation or god will judge you as
[1:58:14] a prostitute
[1:58:20] [Applause]
[1:58:39] so god's got restrictions in his
[1:58:40] subdivision
[1:58:43] no bob-haired women no painted face no
[1:58:46] miniskirts
[1:58:50] that's to keep them kind of folks from
[1:58:51] moving in on top of you
[1:58:58] glory let me invite you when this life
[1:59:01] is over
[1:59:03] i'm fixing to move up to a gated
[1:59:05] community
[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:10] if you'd like to come and go with me hey
[1:59:13] man
[1:59:14] i'm fixing to go to a gated community
[1:59:17] and the gates aren't of concrete they
[1:59:19] aren't of steel
[1:59:20] but the gates are a pure gold hallelujah
[1:59:24] pearls hanging around the streets of
[1:59:26] gold and the walls of jasper
[1:59:29] but you've got to live the right kind of
[1:59:31] life here to live in that retirement
[1:59:34] [Applause]
[1:59:42] community
[1:59:44] it is the longest running youth meeting
[1:59:46] that's ever been
[1:59:48] because everybody there will be 18 years
[1:59:50] old and nobody will get any older
[2:00:00] listen to this they are just beginning
[2:00:03] to find out in the last few years
[2:00:06] that the moon triggers part of the
[2:00:09] causes
[2:00:10] of earthquakes
[2:00:20] so when will that chunk three to four
[2:00:23] hundred miles wide
[2:00:25] 1500 miles long fall 40 miles down
[2:00:30] it'll be timed with the readiness of the
[2:00:33] moon on the earth
[2:00:41] i stood down on the lost sea several
[2:00:43] years ago down down in tennessee if
[2:00:45] you've never been there it's a really
[2:00:46] neat place if you like
[2:00:47] underground caves it's the largest lake
[2:00:49] in the world underground
[2:00:50] lake that they've seen so you can go
[2:00:52] down in these steps and down this sort
[2:00:54] of thing and they've got it all lighted
[2:00:55] up down there they have
[2:00:56] fish that totally blind and you know
[2:00:58] it's just a large underground lake and a
[2:00:59] cave it's a really neat place
[2:01:01] we saw several years ago and god was
[2:01:02] taking us through explaining this that
[2:01:04] and other strike times
[2:01:05] like mountain this night and other and
[2:01:06] he said the last fall that took place
[2:01:09] in this cave is estimated to be
[2:01:12] two thousand years ago
[2:01:17] two thousand years ago
[2:01:21] the head of the moon was on the earth
[2:01:26] matthew 27 53 we know that there was an
[2:01:29] earthquake
[2:01:30] and many of the saints many of the
[2:01:31] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[2:01:34] and entered in with him at his
[2:01:36] resurrection timed around what an
[2:01:38] earthquake
[2:01:39] [Applause]
[2:01:44] the moon has a very thin atmosphere so a
[2:01:47] layer of dust or a footprint
[2:01:49] can sit undisturbed for centuries
[2:01:55] for centuries even though we're seeding
[2:01:58] our soul
[2:01:59] our bodies and our memories can be hurt
[2:02:04] by one another by ourselves not like god
[2:02:07] we don't have access to the safe
[2:02:08] forgetfulness
[2:02:09] and that footprint where somebody walked
[2:02:11] on us can lay there
[2:02:13] for years of our lives
[2:02:17] especially if you don't ask the power of
[2:02:19] the sun
[2:02:20] to help you deal with it
[2:02:23] you can live with your complexes you can
[2:02:25] live with your fears or you can have
[2:02:26] victory over come on now
[2:02:28] a lot of folks in our message don't just
[2:02:30] need physical healing in the body you
[2:02:31] ever read the quote where brother bryan
[2:02:32] said
[2:02:32] that god would bring healing in their
[2:02:34] spirit a lot of folks in the message
[2:02:36] need a healing in their spirit
[2:02:38] they've got all kinds of wounds and all
[2:02:40] kinds of this and the other
[2:02:41] and they pack it around from church to
[2:02:43] church to church and their church
[2:02:45] hoppers here and church
[2:02:46] hoppers there they need a real good
[2:02:47] healing
[2:02:49] i said they need a real good healing so
[2:02:51] the power of the sun can be able to wipe
[2:02:54] away
[2:02:54] the footprints of man
[2:03:00] daytime temperatures on the sunny side
[2:03:03] of the moon
[2:03:04] reach 273 degrees
[2:03:09] fahrenheit on the dark side of the moon
[2:03:14] it's 243 degrees
[2:03:18] below zero
[2:03:22] i've had them days
[2:03:28] you know what i'm saying after a gate
[2:03:30] service man on saturday night or sunday
[2:03:32] morning or sunday night where there i
[2:03:33] mean you say come on devil
[2:03:36] come on
[2:03:42] [Applause]
[2:03:44] then by about three in the afternoon
[2:03:48] man it's cold
[2:03:56] it's only 242 fahrenheit you didn't even
[2:03:59] reach 243 minus yet
[2:04:02] how in the world can we call from such
[2:04:04] extremity
[2:04:05] how can we sit in heavenly places that
[2:04:07] brother tim talked about the last time
[2:04:09] and soar and so are where angels stand
[2:04:13] there
[2:04:13] and envy where we are
[2:04:17] and then an hour after church is over
[2:04:20] the kid will spill kool-aid or you go
[2:04:21] through mcdonald's to drive then they
[2:04:23] wind up a ketchup all over your new car
[2:04:26] i know most of your brothers here are so
[2:04:28] spiritual that don't bother you but this
[2:04:29] is for those who are still yet battling
[2:04:31] in the flesh
[2:04:33] oh you say brother donnie i'm i'm above
[2:04:35] that sort of thing it don't bother me so
[2:04:36] you mean to tell me it wouldn't bother
[2:04:38] you if you come home monday after work
[2:04:39] and your wife went out and bought a new
[2:04:41] lexus without you as telling her she
[2:04:42] could
[2:04:46] sisters hard to know these brothers say
[2:04:48] anything so i guess you're free to pick
[2:04:49] up alexis on monday then
[2:04:53] sure we're humans and it bothers us and
[2:04:55] we can go from one extreme to the other
[2:04:58] but does that happen to the sun
[2:05:03] does the sun have to always
[2:05:08] but the moon showed us
[2:05:11] all the glory oh jesus and the services
[2:05:15] are so wonderful you just think
[2:05:16] we're gonna leave here tonight i mean
[2:05:18] we're gonna be chains
[2:05:20] and then in the morning you issue us
[2:05:26] why you're like the moon
[2:05:30] your story is written in her cycles
[2:05:40] due to tidal friction caused by the moon
[2:05:42] the earth's rotation
[2:05:44] slows down over time
[2:05:48] as it slows our days
[2:05:51] get longer because the earth
[2:05:54] is spinning more slowly
[2:05:58] now you understand already we're going
[2:05:59] out of them longer days of summer right
[2:06:02] where you look at you when that nine
[2:06:04] o'clock or 9 30 or whatever and it's
[2:06:05] still daylight out there
[2:06:07] it's because of where the moon was and
[2:06:09] the
[2:06:10] friction upon the earth but now it
[2:06:12] started moving back in that cycle
[2:06:14] who told the who told the moon what if
[2:06:16] the computer ever goes down on the moon
[2:06:18] and the moon
[2:06:18] gets a computer saying and then delays
[2:06:20] don't worry it will never go down and
[2:06:22] still in the original creation
[2:06:23] it's still an original order when adam
[2:06:25] fell it did not affect the moon
[2:06:27] i don't know what item fell it did not
[2:06:30] change the moon
[2:06:31] which is you and the stars you
[2:06:34] have an identity there in the heavens
[2:06:36] and you're going back to where you come
[2:06:38] from
[2:06:38] [Applause]
[2:06:43] watch in isaiah chapter 30 verse 25 and
[2:06:45] there shall be every high mountain
[2:06:47] and upon every high hill rivers and
[2:06:49] streams of waters
[2:06:51] and the day of the great slaughter when
[2:06:52] the towers fall now listen very
[2:06:54] carefully this verse
[2:06:56] and moreover the light of the moon
[2:06:59] shall be as the light of the sun and the
[2:07:02] light of the sun
[2:07:04] shall be sevenfold as the light of seven
[2:07:08] days
[2:07:10] in the day the lord bindeth up the
[2:07:12] breach
[2:07:13] of his people
[2:07:19] so the light of the moon will reach the
[2:07:22] light of the sun
[2:07:24] and when it does the sun will manifest
[2:07:27] itself
[2:07:28] in a seven-fold strength and it's based
[2:07:32] upon the breach
[2:07:34] being healed in his people
[2:07:38] hallelujah to god aren't you glad there
[2:07:41] was a breach
[2:07:42] preached in this last day oh
[2:07:45] think of the children years and years
[2:07:47] ago whenever the children of israel had
[2:07:49] doubted god
[2:07:50] and they entered into unbelief and god
[2:07:51] told moses separate yourself from them
[2:07:53] and i'll kill them
[2:07:54] and god spoke to aaron wrote to moses
[2:07:56] and aaron speaks to moses
[2:07:58] and says take a censor and take fire off
[2:08:00] the altar and go out among the people
[2:08:02] wait a minute i thought blood was an
[2:08:04] atonement
[2:08:06] and yet moses told aaron go out there
[2:08:08] and make an atonement for the people
[2:08:09] and runs right out there in the judgment
[2:08:12] of god
[2:08:12] and the plague had already broke loose
[2:08:14] in the camp and aaron runs right out in
[2:08:16] the middle of it
[2:08:17] and he goes right to where it was oh
[2:08:19] hallelujah and the bible said he stood
[2:08:21] between the dead
[2:08:22] and the living he stood right there in
[2:08:25] the breach
[2:08:27] he stood right there face to face with
[2:08:29] the judgment of god
[2:08:30] and he stopped the judgment of god
[2:08:38] 14 700 people
[2:08:41] died in that plague
[2:08:46] the judgment of god was hanging over
[2:08:48] humanity
[2:08:49] but the lord god came down on the body
[2:08:51] of flesh
[2:08:52] and what did he do he sent jesus right
[2:08:55] there in the preach
[2:08:57] stood right there in the judgment of god
[2:08:59] and he stopped
[2:09:00] eternal death on your soul
[2:09:04] now you can no more die than god
[2:09:07] [Applause]
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:11] when preachers preach about hell i don't
[2:09:14] dream about it i don't think about it
[2:09:15] because i ain't where i'm going
[2:09:17] would you preach about being lost that
[2:09:19] ain't me cause i ain't lost
[2:09:22] hallelujah i am his
[2:09:29] oh let me give you an example here
[2:09:34] the people of psycho in the book of john
[2:09:38] in the new testament
[2:09:40] they were touched they were
[2:09:43] helped they were ministered to
[2:09:48] by the light of the moon
[2:09:52] that's good i want you to listen they
[2:09:55] had the
[2:09:56] breaking of the moon through a reflected
[2:10:00] light
[2:10:02] called the woman at the well
[2:10:07] now think of this saint john 4 28 the
[2:10:10] woman then left her water pot
[2:10:12] and went away into the city and saith
[2:10:14] unto the men
[2:10:16] come see a man which told me all things
[2:10:18] ever i did it's not just a christ
[2:10:21] i already find it amazing with some of
[2:10:22] these new testament people they saw one
[2:10:24] thing i can't believe a man's prophet
[2:10:29] people in this day save tens of
[2:10:30] thousands of things and they're still
[2:10:32] not sure
[2:10:34] you realize these people that are
[2:10:35] crucifying this word if they lived in
[2:10:36] the days of jesus that crucified him
[2:10:38] because it is him they're crucifying
[2:10:40] today
[2:10:42] this woman saw one thing and said i
[2:10:45] perceive you our prophet nathaniel said
[2:10:47] thou art the son of god the king of
[2:10:48] israel was one thing
[2:10:54] now watch the moon now talking come see
[2:10:58] a man which told me all things ever i
[2:11:00] did
[2:11:00] is not this a good man he's a pretty
[2:11:03] good fella i'm really wondering if this
[2:11:04] guy might be
[2:11:05] he is not this the christ
[2:11:11] then they went out of the city and came
[2:11:13] unto him now what's verse 39
[2:11:15] and many of the samaritans of that city
[2:11:18] believed on him for the saying
[2:11:20] of the woman
[2:11:25] jesus shining on her was reflecting his
[2:11:28] glory
[2:11:29] she had now become the moon
[2:11:33] now remember she had no saying among
[2:11:35] them no word among them no testimony
[2:11:36] they all know who she was
[2:11:37] and in a matter of time they saw such an
[2:11:39] illumination on this woman's life
[2:11:41] they shouldn't even listen to her it
[2:11:43] wasn't like six months later
[2:11:44] it'd been like a year later that way to
[2:11:45] try and prove her name she's going to be
[2:11:47] okay
[2:11:47] but she goes out that morning 15 minutes
[2:11:49] she comes by and there's such
[2:11:50] illumination on this woman
[2:11:52] that they stand there and listen to her
[2:11:53] testimony and they begin to believe
[2:11:56] brother sister we need more like that
[2:11:58] instead of leading people to the message
[2:12:00] we need to get them to the baptism of
[2:12:02] the holy ghost
[2:12:02] then let them read the message of thou
[2:12:04] and they'll grab a hold of it really
[2:12:05] right
[2:12:07] we've led a lot of them to the doctrines
[2:12:09] of the message but they ain't got a new
[2:12:10] verse
[2:12:11] come on now you might as well say amen
[2:12:14] these folks that are falling away from
[2:12:16] the message of thou they
[2:12:17] are not born again i don't care how much
[2:12:20] they shout how much they scream
[2:12:22] they don't have a new birth for the holy
[2:12:24] ghost
[2:12:25] [Applause]
[2:12:33] now watch verse 40. so when the
[2:12:35] samaritans were coming to him
[2:12:37] they besought him that he would tarry
[2:12:39] with them
[2:12:40] and he abode there two days and many
[2:12:44] more believed
[2:12:46] because of his own word
[2:12:51] now jesus is shining directly on them
[2:12:55] you understand this is what happens in
[2:12:57] our families this is what happens in
[2:12:59] revivals
[2:13:01] the revival start moving boy the whole
[2:13:03] preacher gets old on fire
[2:13:04] some of the church people get on fire
[2:13:06] and the light is shining from the sun
[2:13:08] directly onto brother so-and-so and
[2:13:10] sister so-and-so man they're all tore up
[2:13:12] boy i tell one thing hallelujah
[2:13:13] something's going on and somebody else
[2:13:15] if they're not careful they'll get under
[2:13:17] them beams of moonlight
[2:13:19] they'll say oh glory to god i fell with
[2:13:21] chill go all over around the shiver
[2:13:23] oh hallelujah god that ain't enough
[2:13:27] you have got to get in direct contact
[2:13:30] with the son himself and let the sun
[2:13:34] go to shining on you instead of you
[2:13:37] talking about mama's experience
[2:13:39] well brother ron's a good man brother so
[2:13:41] and so that's well and good
[2:13:43] but you want that sun shining on you
[2:13:46] [Applause]
[2:13:51] moonlight won't keep you very good in
[2:13:52] hell's region
[2:13:59] you see the moon is revealed in four
[2:14:02] stages
[2:14:04] first second third and fourth quarters
[2:14:09] she waxes and she wanes
[2:14:14] you all ought to be able to say amen to
[2:14:15] that you all waxing wayne too
[2:14:18] sometimes you all come in church in a
[2:14:19] kegan i couldn't move you
[2:14:26] other times you come in and a bumblebee
[2:14:28] can fly you from here to richmond and
[2:14:29] back
[2:14:33] you're waxing and waiting come on song
[2:14:35] leaders know it's the truth preachers
[2:14:36] know it's the truth
[2:14:37] i called brother tim several years ago
[2:14:39] and talking to everybody how you doing
[2:14:40] doing good
[2:14:40] how's the church doing oh he said
[2:14:42] they're not feeding very good right now
[2:14:46] church just goes through those times as
[2:14:48] individuals goes through those times why
[2:14:50] our type
[2:14:56] so she reaches her full moon but she
[2:14:58] don't stay there long
[2:14:59] she starts decreasing decreasing
[2:15:02] decreasing and then you get to where you
[2:15:05] get out at night
[2:15:06] you can't even already find her
[2:15:11] then boy here she comes you come start
[2:15:14] building back up again so she don't just
[2:15:15] pop right out but she begins to change
[2:15:17] herself from justification
[2:15:19] sanctification baptism holy ghost holy
[2:15:22] ghost himself
[2:15:24] and that she is oh you look at him oh my
[2:15:27] look at her look at her
[2:15:28] how beautiful she is
[2:15:31] you go back and look at her in a couple
[2:15:33] weeks you can't even find her
[2:15:38] you see my brother man describes to us
[2:15:39] how god made this earth
[2:15:41] and he said i can see a clinker a
[2:15:43] clicker he said let's step on the
[2:15:45] eternity he said let's step up here on
[2:15:47] the banister
[2:15:47] i've got a picture of my mind and he
[2:15:50] said god said let there be light and he
[2:15:51] said whenever he did
[2:15:52] a clinker
[2:15:57] and out of the sun come this planet
[2:16:01] and the logos moves over it and he lets
[2:16:03] it drop 150 million years
[2:16:05] and he
[2:16:06] [Applause]
[2:16:10] there he stops it and sets it in orbit
[2:16:14] another one
[2:16:20] he watches and it drops it drops and
[2:16:22] drops
[2:16:23] it drops he moves over
[2:16:28] and it rocks and finally it starts
[2:16:31] spinning
[2:16:33] and he said what was he doing god was
[2:16:35] writing
[2:16:36] his first bible
[2:16:44] you imagine whenever he started bringing
[2:16:46] this earth out and here comes the earth
[2:16:48] and drops down drops down drops down
[2:16:50] covered over with ice and the logos lets
[2:16:53] it fall fall fall
[2:16:54] and we live and what scientists call is
[2:16:56] the habitable
[2:16:57] part of the universe you see had we been
[2:17:00] 10 000 miles closer to the sun the
[2:17:03] temperature would be so hot no life
[2:17:04] could live on us
[2:17:05] if we was 5 000 miles farther out away
[2:17:08] from the sun
[2:17:09] it would be so cold life could not live
[2:17:11] on us so whoever put us where we are
[2:17:14] putted us where he wanted us and he put
[2:17:17] us in the habitable
[2:17:18] zone put all the seeds you want to on
[2:17:22] jupiter but they won't grow
[2:17:24] put all the seeds you want to on mars
[2:17:26] but they won't go come on with me now
[2:17:28] you put all the seeds a predestination
[2:17:30] of life on a baptist man that's a
[2:17:32] baptist from his soul
[2:17:33] he'll never make bride put it on a
[2:17:35] catholic he'll never make bride
[2:17:37] but if you put seed of life in a
[2:17:40] habitable zone
[2:17:41] of a predestinated life hallelujah it
[2:17:44] will bring forth
[2:17:45] life in spite of itself
[2:17:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:17:53] why because he put you in the habitable
[2:17:56] zone
[2:17:57] of his spiritual universe
[2:17:59] [Applause]
[2:18:02] so here comes this clinker
[2:18:07] covered with ice brother who said the
[2:18:10] logos let it fall
[2:18:12] and then he started turning around you
[2:18:13] know sister so like a rotisserie in your
[2:18:15] microwave
[2:18:17] so you put a put a chicken or a bowl of
[2:18:18] mac and cheese or whatever inside that
[2:18:20] little spinning table in your microwave
[2:18:22] and you go to zap and that dude and you
[2:18:24] punch that button and visit
[2:18:26] and all of a sudden it goes spinning
[2:18:27] around and the logos are spinning the
[2:18:29] earth
[2:18:30] and we start bringing over close to the
[2:18:32] sun
[2:18:33] the ice began to melt and he started
[2:18:36] cutting the big
[2:18:37] crevices down through the grand canyon
[2:18:42] oh scientists want to say well i'll tell
[2:18:43] you one thing it was so many years ago a
[2:18:45] dinosaur come down through here and
[2:18:47] walk down through there and all the
[2:18:48] waters come up through here and washed
[2:18:50] all that out my question is what
[2:18:51] happened to all that dirt that was in
[2:18:52] there where'd it go
[2:18:56] i don't see any of that piled up down
[2:18:58] there i know enough about digging holes
[2:18:59] and i was a boy to know if you take a
[2:19:00] certain amount of dirt out of so-and-so
[2:19:02] there's gonna be a pile of dirt over
[2:19:03] here
[2:19:03] so if all that dirt come out of that
[2:19:04] grand canyon where'd it all go to
[2:19:08] it wasn't him moving the dirt it was my
[2:19:10] father
[2:19:12] now you look at this arse and trace her
[2:19:14] back to origination
[2:19:16] and if she comes from the sun let's peel
[2:19:18] back the crust
[2:19:19] let's go back past the surface let's
[2:19:21] build back down on the core of the earth
[2:19:24] and what do we find burning fire
[2:19:28] she in her soul reflects where
[2:19:32] she come from you peel back my humanity
[2:19:35] pull back your humanity and what do you
[2:19:38] look down inside of
[2:19:39] a soul which come from god
[2:19:51] you love him
[2:19:56] moreover the light of the moon shall be
[2:19:58] as the light of the sun and the light of
[2:19:59] the sun shall be seven
[2:20:01] fold as the light of seven days
[2:20:05] think of where we are the light of seven
[2:20:08] days has culminated
[2:20:10] in the age we are living we are not just
[2:20:13] going to live a good life let me close
[2:20:15] for us to be able to make it through
[2:20:17] this age
[2:20:18] and barely get by and
[2:20:21] barely hold on pray for me that i can
[2:20:24] hold on
[2:20:25] save your prayers for something else i'm
[2:20:28] not gonna barely hold on
[2:20:30] when i get there that day jesus ain't
[2:20:32] going to hand me a t-shirt
[2:20:33] i survived laodicea
[2:20:52] oh jesus jesus
[2:20:56] i made it
[2:20:59] [Applause]
[2:21:01] they now testimony to you lord

[2:28:04] that was ill-famed and in a matter of
[2:28:06] moments
[2:28:08] that woman changed from a a woman of
[2:28:12] absolute hated among the people
[2:28:15] but the strength of the sun so shined on

[2:28:54] much of their life is to do with how
[2:28:56] they expect you to move in their lives

[2:29:01] will be released
[2:29:02] that's what we can have help us tonight

[2:30:27] to go beyond the reflected moonlight
[2:30:29] from your mama
[2:30:30] or your daddy or your pastor you've got
[2:30:32] to go where you or yourself so in line
[2:30:34] with the orbit
[2:30:36] that the sun himself shines on you with
[2:30:38] his own light
[2:30:40] and you become a reflector of his glory
[2:30:43] your humanity you look at that there's
[2:30:45] nothing shining about this there's
[2:30:46] nothing listening about it
[2:30:47] how can you see god through a preacher
[2:30:49] that stands up and preaches
[2:30:50] it's reflected glory how could we see
[2:30:53] god through brother branham through
[2:30:54] moses through elijah
[2:30:55] reflected glory they were able to get
[2:30:57] themselves out of the way
[2:30:59] and the sun able to shine upon that moon
[2:31:01] and we looked and saw the moon side
[2:31:03] as god shined it down oh this is what he
[2:31:06] wants
[2:31:07] praise god the moon is coming into the
[2:31:09] glory of the sun
[2:31:11] and the sun will reflect itself in
[2:31:12] sevenfold glory
[2:31:14] and all those previous ages behind us
[2:31:16] are gonna raise
[2:31:17] when what when the moon comes to her
[2:31:20] final cycle
[2:31:22] praise be to god oh i know it's hard for
[2:31:25] us to comprehend
[2:31:26] but the prophet tells us that
[2:31:27] resurrection that holy ghost power that
[2:31:29] lives in you
[2:31:30] you will call your own body in the
[2:31:32] resurrection
[2:31:41] hallelujah why the resurrection of the
[2:31:43] moon and the sun will become so
[2:31:45] personified

[2:31:48] have died and entered into the theophany
[2:31:50] you will bring the theophany the
[2:31:51] theophany will come to the earth to meet
