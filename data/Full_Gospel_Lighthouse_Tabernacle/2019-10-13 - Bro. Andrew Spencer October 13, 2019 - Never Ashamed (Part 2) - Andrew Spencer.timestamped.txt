[2:36] have my mother-in-law here with me this
[2:38] weekend and and always counting a very
[2:41] special honor to have her amongst us I
[2:43] think the world of my mother-in-law I
[2:45] know that some some men make jokes about
[2:48] their mother-in-law's and not having
[2:49] good mother-in-law's and I know some
[2:51] people don't have good mother-in-law's
[2:52] but God give me the best mother-in-law
[2:54] that I could ever ask for and I'm
[2:57] certainly privileged to call her my
[2:59] family and she didn't know when I was
[3:01] asking her for Katie's hand in marriage
[3:03] that I'd be taking her all over the
[3:05] world preaching this gospel she didn't
[3:07] expect that I'd be preaching this but I
[3:10] do know this that if I go anywhere to
[3:12] preach or I take my family I know that
[3:15] she's at her home prayin for me and I'm
[3:17] thankful to have a mother-in-law like
[3:19] that and we want to just just commit
[3:22] this service to the Lord's and not we
[3:24] want to be remembering our pastor that
[3:26] God would strengthen him and giving him
[3:28] his voice back I know he was struggling
[3:30] but God did supernatural things and
[3:33] those meetings there and if you have not

[3:45] blessing from the Lord I know that they

[6:34] Shaymin about and the people of God say
[6:36] let us never be ashamed of him he was
[6:40] not ashamed of me and I will not be
[6:42] ashamed of him we could go over in the
[6:45] Book of Ruth and we could read there
[6:46] throughout the whole entirety of that
[6:49] Bible there that that scripture reading
[6:51] we would read of a of a woman that by
[6:54] the name of Ruth that would be a type of
[6:56] the bride of Jesus Christ coming out of
[6:59] the country of Moab she was a more by
[7:02] 'test that that she was coming out of a
[7:04] country that was of pagan worship and
[7:07] when with her when her husband had died
[7:10] and her brother-in-law had died and her
[7:12] father and her father had died her
[7:14] husband and brother-in-law all of them
[7:15] had died and Naomi was going back she
[7:18] was going back to her her homeland and
[7:21] and she was taking her two daughters
[7:24] back with her and and they were making a
[7:26] travel out and she turned around to them
[7:29] and said no don't follow me here I'm too
[7:32] old to have a son that you could that
[7:33] you could take on to be your own that
[7:35] would be your husband
[7:37] go back to the land where you came from
[7:38] and Orpah turned kissed her and and went
[7:42] back to the land of Moab but Ruth said
[7:45] to Naomi she said ah where you go I will
[7:49] go your God will be my god your people
[7:53] will be my people and she made this
[7:56] journey and as she's making this journey
[7:58] out of Moab into the land of Judah and
[8:01] Israel where where she was going to a
[8:04] place in which it was a case that were
[8:06] looking possible for Ruth to be accepted
[8:09] in the community of the Israelites it
[8:12] looked like it would be a case where it
[8:14] would be impossible for her to fit in in
[8:17] the crowd of the message people are you
[8:19] with me tonight it would look like a
[8:21] case that that could not be fetched
[8:24] because there was so much debt that was
[8:26] stacked up against Naomi and Ruth it was
[8:29] a case that was impossible that
[8:31] everybody was looking upon this case of
[8:33] Ruth and they al me they were looking at
[8:36] a case in the Naturals hips but they
[8:38] didn't realize that there was a type of
[8:40] Christ that
[8:41] standing there in that country little
[8:44] did the community know that there was a
[8:46] kinsman in that hopper in that moment
[8:49] and waiting for an opportunity when he
[8:52] would step up and redeem Naomi's estate
[8:55] and when Boaz seen Ruth in that
[8:59] condition in a condition of
[9:01] embarrassment in a condition I the
[9:04] condition of sameness and sorrow OS fell
[9:08] in love with Ruth he fell in love with
[9:12] Ruth and he told his man servants that
[9:15] were out in the field now you lay
[9:17] handfuls of purpose for her that she may
[9:21] gather and he went to Ruth and he told
[9:24] her you stay in this field you stay
[9:27] right here don't you go and glean and
[9:28] nobody else's feel don't go over here to
[9:31] the denomination's you stay right here
[9:34] in this field for in this field is a
[9:37] place there's enough here that will feed
[9:39] you there's enough here that will
[9:41] sustain you

[9:48] that a rapture your soul there's enough
[9:51] here to wipe away your sin you stay in
[9:53] this field Ruth you stay right here and
[9:58] you go over in the Book of Ruth chapter
[10:00] three and you see when Naomi is given
[10:02] instruction to Ruth to go down when they
[10:05] are winnowing out the wheat and you
[10:07] found when Boaz is down there and he's
[10:09] throughout the threshing floor and they
[10:12] come down to this moment and out that
[10:15] night she went down to when he was
[10:17] winnowing the wheat that night at the
[10:19] garner at the barn Boaz laid down and
[10:23] when he laid down Ruth notice it's not a
[10:27] shame to dispose herself to this man you
[10:30] see Naomi had told her to mark the place
[10:34] where he laid down consider this place
[10:38] mark it out that this is a place that he
[10:41] lays down but Ruth was not ashamed to
[10:44] destroy her her character to be
[10:47] identified with poets she was not
[10:51] ashamed to dispose herself to this man
[10:54] a real true born-again truck tonight is
[10:56] not ashamed to dispose herself to the
[10:59] Holy Ghost call of God is that right
[11:03] went right down into the barn with this
[11:05] man giving him trust every man that
[11:09] comes to Christ must forsake everything
[11:11] on both sides and must put his full
[11:14] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ no matter

[11:28] don't you be ashamed of it don't you be
[11:30] afraid you trust Christ she walked in
[11:36] and when she found out that she give
[11:38] that trust he throwed his robe around
[11:40] her and the Holy Ghost course to cover
[11:43] with his own roll he said now you go on
[11:47] you argue you go on when daylight comes
[11:50] I've got to do the work of a kinsman
[11:52] before I can receive you can I say it to
[11:56] you like this that are the only stir
[11:58] morning when the Esso in began to harass
[12:02] me and you was identified with him when

[12:11] come up here he came and you and I came
[12:14] with him I was in him when he was
[12:17] hanging on the cross if you believe that
[12:21] you're the body of Jesus Christ tonight

[12:25] you believe that you are the body of
[12:27] Jesus Christ
[12:28] you better believe that you was in him
[12:31] when he was hanging on that cross you
[12:33] better believe that you was in him when
[12:35] he went to a devil's Heil you better
[12:38] believe that you were in him
[12:40] when he when he was laying there in a
[12:41] tomb and if you believe that you can
[12:44] believe that you are in him when he rose
[12:47] up early on Sunday morning hallelujah
[12:52] I tell you church this Sun is up you see
[12:59] the kinsman was not ashamed to do the
[13:02] work of a kinsman
[13:04] here OS was not ashamed to do the work
[13:06] for Ruth he was willing he was willing
[13:09] to make a public testimony when he went
[13:12] down there they had an order in which
[13:14] they would do things and when he went
[13:16] there before the elders when they walked
[13:18] in he said I've got something to say to
[13:21] you I am here to redeem Naomi's estate
[13:25] but there was a nearer kinsman than Boaz
[13:28] that was Satan standing there but Satan
[13:32] could not touch you
[13:34] Satan ain't got a right to lay his hands
[13:36] on God's property you see this Redeemer
[13:40] had to be financially able financially
[13:44] able to pay for this estate whoa hallelu
[13:49] he had to be financially able to pay for
[13:51] this state and Boaz was financially able
[13:55] to pay for Naomi and pay for Ruth's
[13:58] estate you see when Christ paid for you
[14:03] he paid when he paid for the Jewish
[14:05] community he paid for you and I whoo
[14:11] hallelujah he had to be financially able
[14:14] how about our God tonight is was he
[14:16] financially able when he said God that
[14:19] owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills he's
[14:21] a God that owns the universe he's a God
[14:24] that owns the spaces in time and
[14:26] everything else in the world I'd say
[14:28] that he was financially able I want you
[14:35] to consider your worth right now
[14:37] consider your worth that the God that
[14:40] owns everything was willing to lay it
[14:43] all down for you let the devil tell you
[14:46] that you ain't worth that's worthless
[14:49] let him tell you that God says different
[14:53] God thoughts so much of you that he
[14:56] condescended down and took on the robe
[14:59] of humanity but when he took on that
[15:03] robe of humanity you see Boaz when he
[15:06] went down there and made a public
[15:08] testimony he took he took off his shoe
[15:11] and he kicked his shoe showing that he
[15:14] was
[15:15] to do the work and Christ
[15:19] click click EEE cut off and he NE kicked
[15:23] off the robes of his righteousness and
[15:25] took on humanity for you and me he
[15:31] thought you was worth the pain
[15:35] he thought of going through the agony
[15:39] was worth it for you now another thing

[20:21] be with you even unto the end of the
[20:23] world if the Queen of England is not
[20:27] ashamed to act like a queen how about
[20:29] the Queen of Heaven
[20:31] we should never be ashamed of our
[20:34] kingdom and to us act like a queen of
[20:36] heaven woo look at Moses after his
[20:49] burning bush experience he was not
[20:50] ashamed to go down to Egypt and proclaim
[20:53] that God is coming down to deliver his
[20:56] children he was not ashamed to stand
[20:59] there in the face of the religions of
[21:00] the world at that time he was not
[21:02] ashamed to stand there in the face of I
[21:04] the greatest army in hell in the world
[21:07] he was not ashamed to stand in front of
[21:09] Pharaoh he was not ashamed to stand in
[21:12] front of which doctors and magicians of
[21:13] the day I stretch for this rod and
[21:16] declare the power of Almighty God he was
[21:19] not ashamed to do it
[21:20] because God was with him who hallelu
[21:27] he'd stand there in the face of all of
[21:30] the criticism and all the doubters and
[21:32] it stretched through that rod and
[21:34] miracles would take place why because he
[21:38] was a son of God before the world began
[21:41] God knew that Moses was going to be that
[21:45] deliverer God was not ashamed of Moses
[21:48] and Moses was not a sane to step up and
[21:51] say the God of Abraham and Isaac and
[21:54] Jacob
[21:55] met him in a bus that was not consumed
[21:58] and he told me that I am come down to
[22:01] deliver that same God has come down to
[22:04] Laodicea to deliver his children he was
[22:12] doing all of these mighty miracles under
[22:15] the blood of bulls and goats which could
[22:17] not take away sin how about you and me
[22:21] how about you and me there are under a
[22:24] perfect blood that are under a perfect
[22:27] token we've come under the slogan should
[22:33] we be ashamed of the miracles that take
[22:35] place which should we be surprised bound
[22:38] absolutely not it's a perfect Savior
[22:43] it's a perfect Redeemer it's a perfect
[22:46] sacrifice I'll tell you hey don't blow
[22:50] my mind when I see cancers fall off it
[22:53] does not blow my mind when I see young
[22:55] people rise up I expect these things
[22:58] because God said it would be there he
[23:05] don't surprise me it just makes me fall
[23:08] in love with him or it makes me realize
[23:12] that he's the same yesterday today and
[23:14] forever I wonder do you see Jesus every
[23:21] day of your life let me ask you another
[23:24] question can you see Jesus in you when
[23:31] Moses was standing here he was not
[23:33] standing with a crowd he was not
[23:35] standing with the who's who he was
[23:38] standing by himself but God was with him
[23:40] he said I'm not capable speaking he's
[23:44] will I give you your brother Abel Aaron
[23:45] to be to be your spokesman he was
[23:48] standing there not with two hundred not

[27:00] opposition brother Branham was standing
[27:04] alone in this generation his closest
[27:06] friend in the ministry at the time would
[27:08] have been MF Bosworth but there was
[27:10] nobody that walked in the realms where
[27:13] William Branham walked in there was
[27:15] nobody that knew what was taking place
[27:17] like he did he was standing alone when
[27:20] he would stand there in 1933 or no
[27:23] higher banks of the river there and he
[27:25] would stand there baptized in the 17th
[27:27] person and a voice from heaven came and
[27:30] said as John the Baptist forerun the
[27:32] first coming of Christ so were your
[27:34] message William Branham for running the
[27:36] second coming of Christ
[27:37] he was standing all alone come on
[27:42] somebody when he's standing there in the
[27:44] 1940s to come out in the greatest
[27:48] revival healing revival that ever took
[27:50] place and come out and say I met an
[27:53] angel in a cave there was nobody else
[27:56] Billy Graham in aaand and Oral Roberts
[27:59] and all these other words they could not
[28:01] say that they met an angel but this
[28:03] William Branham stood there it said that
[28:06] this angel told me of my peculiar birth
[28:10] he was standing alone
[28:13] he was standing alone with 300 when 300
[28:17] preachers in Chicago they were
[28:18] contesting him over water baptism in the
[28:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[28:23] serpent Satan II of these other
[28:25] doctrines they were contending with him
[28:27] he was standing alone Oh hallelujah
[28:33] he was standing alone when he would say
[28:35] there in 1962 in 1963 that seven angels
[28:39] met me in a cluster of a cloud and told
[28:42] me to go back to Jeffersonville and
[28:44] preach the seven seals
[28:45] he was standing alone he was standing
[28:49] alone in 1965 when he's standing there
[28:53] in California and he is preaching the
[28:56] choosing of a bride and he says oh
[29:00] they're Los Angeles you're going to see
[29:03] beneath the ocean he was standing alone
[29:07] when there was people thinking that
[29:09] there's going to be a rapture and on the
[29:11] other side there was people lighting up
[29:13] cigarettes I know where I'd have been
[29:16] standing at come on somebody if you
[29:20] would be smoking a cigarette you might
[29:22] as well walk out of here tonight because

[29:29] message is for the believers if that
[29:34] embarrasses you I'm sorry but I'm not
[29:39] backing up on what I believe this God
[29:43] birthed me this God changed me this God
[29:47] filled me I was a boy that needed the
[29:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost when I married
[29:55] my wife and a year later in Canada that
[29:58] God met me on a street
[30:00] you think I'm ashamed to tell about it
[30:03] brother Samuel you think I'm ashamed to
[30:06] tell about your deliverance that God
[30:08] gives you a perfect liver for your
[30:11] vessel I'm not a saying to testify that
[30:15] God still heals

[30:52] he was standing alone he's standing
[30:57] alone and other people are questioning
[30:59] him over speaking squirrels into
[31:01] existence some of his closest friends
[31:03] are questioning these things
[31:05] but had a rod said that's nothing but
[31:08] the truth and the Spirit of the Lord
[31:11] says give her what she asked for and God
[31:14] gave her her sons
[31:15] I'm not ashamed to testify about that
[31:18] I've watched that same spirit swoop in
[31:21] slip into these meetings like tonight
[31:24] and you say something that's incredibly
[31:27] too far for your mind to figure out and
[31:30] God hears your prayer and it manifests
[31:35] just like asking hello
[31:44] he was standing alone when he spoke a
[31:47] storm out of existence but the community

[36:13] wasn't ashamed of God's Word he
[36:15] absolutely was not ashamed of it Stephen
[36:18] he wasn't ashamed of God's Word
[36:20] first Pentecostal people up there in the
[36:23] day of Pentecost when they gathered in
[36:25] the upper room the Holy Ghost fell upon
[36:27] them by our promise of God and Luke 24
[36:29] and 49 said behold I send the promise of
[36:32] my father upon you but wait in the city
[36:35] of Jerusalem until you receive power
[36:37] from on high
[36:38] and the very promise that God that the

[37:02] said repent every one of you you men
[37:04] with wicked hands who crucified the
[37:06] Prince of Peace which God has raised
[37:08] from the dead and we are witness for
[37:11] this is what Joe said would come to pass
[37:13] in the last days I'll pour out my spirit
[37:16] upon all flesh he was not ashamed of the
[37:20] gospel
[37:22] that's the heritage of the states Jo -
[37:27] and 25 says I and I will restore to you
[37:31] the years that the locusts have eaten

[38:02] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[38:04] and none else and my people are you his
[38:07] people tonight and my people shall never
[38:10] be ashamed and it shall come to pass
[38:12] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[38:14] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[38:17] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[38:19] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[38:21] see visions Church this is that what
[38:27] you're experiencing what they
[38:28] experienced in Louisiana what they're
[38:30] experiencing all over the world this is
[38:32] that which Joe prophesied about you are
[38:36] his people
[38:37] you are called of God you are Dane
[38:40] before the world began before Laodicea
[38:43] ever was into existence

[38:51] began you were elected you were chosen
[38:54] you were bought you were purchased and
[39:04] Satan cannot have you
[39:07] [Music]
[39:10] Satan cannot have our children Satan
[39:14] cannot have our protocol they may look
[39:17] like produções right now but when they
[39:19] get here and God takes care of business
[39:23] they won't look like Prada khals no more
[39:27] God Oh feed kill the fatted calf God
[39:30] will dress them in His Holiness there's
[39:41] three ladies that are sitting here in
[39:43] our congregation maybe more than that
[39:46] now but it all came in about the same
[39:49] time that were cheerleaders and you'd
[39:52] never pick them out in this crowd
[39:55] translate the cheerleaders of this day
[39:58] but when they came to this our pastor
[40:01] specifically never preached on dress
[40:04] code until they got it and they got it
[40:07] before he ever had to preach on it ain't
[40:10] a right
[40:12] God is the one that does the dressing if
[40:15] I tell you how to dress head ain't
[40:17] living that's just me telling you but
[40:20] when you get the baptism of the Holy

[40:58] rapture hello are you whipping tonight

[41:05] I know there's some pistol-packing
[41:07] Mama's in this church tonight that ain't

[41:14] children or try to come in your house
[41:16] and try to hurt your family you know
[41:18] what you do you know what you do but you

[42:12] rapturing power in it oh yeah

[42:23] useful for your soul
[42:26] [Applause]
[42:44] you still love me
[42:47] good it's God I'm talking to you about
[42:53] tonight he thought so much of you by the
[42:55] same he thought so much love you sister
[42:58] faith that he came from heaven to earth
[43:02] and he took on the robe of humanity now
[43:08] notice what Paul says about her kinsmen
[43:10] and I in Hebrews 2 and 7 thou madest him
[43:15] a little lower than the angels thou
[43:17] crowned us him of glory and honour and
[43:19] did it set him over the works of thy
[43:21] hands now has put all things in
[43:23] subjection under his feet for in that he
[43:26] put all in subjection under him he left
[43:28] nothing that is not put under him
[43:30] somebody say nothing but now we see not
[43:33] yet all things put under him but we see
[43:36] Jesus who was made a little lower than
[43:39] the Angels for the suffering of death
[43:40] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[43:43] the grace of God should taste death for
[43:47] every man that God thought of you for it
[43:53] became him for whom are all things and
[43:56] by whom are all things in bringing him
[43:59] many sons and the glory to make the
[44:01] captain of their salvation perfect
[44:03] through sufferings I want you to know
[44:05] that God that is fight for you the
[44:07] captain of the Lord's hosts that's
[44:09] fighting for you has never lost the
[44:11] battle he's never lost the case cancers
[44:14] never defeated him sadness has never
[44:16] defeated him depression has never
[44:18] defeated him none of your problems have
[44:25] ever stopped my god
[44:27] none of them verse 11 for both he that
[44:32] sanctifies and they who are sanctified
[44:34] are all of one for which cause he is not
[44:39] ashamed to call them brethren notice
[44:44] God's attitude towards you he
[44:46] acknowledges himself has been a part of
[44:49] the same family as you
[44:55] it may have been unexpected that God
[44:57] would give the name brethren to us that
[45:02] were degraded us that had a wrecked up
[45:04] life
[45:05] us that were humble us that were broken
[45:07] he gave us the title of brethren with
[45:11] him to those that he came to redeem he
[45:17] was willing to be raped with them and be
[45:23] regarded and your family I've been
[45:31] looking at that scripture for four weeks
[45:33] now I still can't get over you mean you
[45:43] really do that brother Andrew you just
[45:44] look at one scripture some I will do it
[45:46] I'll look over one scripture until he
[45:50] unfolds himself to me it ain't about
[45:53] reading 15 chapters chapters a day
[45:56] Charles Spurgeon said some men like to
[45:59] read Bible right I'd like to read
[46:00] chapters as long as they're armed but
[46:02] they don't understand one thing about it
[46:05] I'd rather read one scripture and they'd
[46:08] do my whole mouth good then to read 15
[46:12] chapters a day and I don't get nothing
[46:14] out of it I've been looking over this
[46:17] scripture and it's overwhelming to me
[46:19] that he would look at all of my mistakes
[46:22] he's seen me in all of my troubles he's
[46:25] seen me in my sickness he's seen when I
[46:27] sins he's seen what I was in fault he's
[46:31] seen when I lied he's seen when I
[46:33] cheated he's seen when I stole he's seen
[46:36] me in my despair but he said I am not
[46:39] ashamed to call you brethren some of you
[46:43] it looks like you can't get out of the
[46:45] pit but I want you to know that God is
[46:47] not ashamed to call you brethren that
[46:59] thoughts overwhelming that he see when I
[47:10] was that close to death maybe just a
[47:17] little bit more I wouldn't even be here
[47:25] Church hate ain't nothing but the grace
[47:29] of God that you're standing here it
[47:32] ain't nothing but the mercies of God
[47:34] that you still live I know some of your
[47:38] histories I know what you've been
[47:40] through I know some of the deepest
[47:42] darkest things that you don't want told
[47:45] but even at all of your misery he said I
[47:50] am not ashamed to be called bread now
[47:56] it's one thing for me to say that I am
[47:59] not ashamed of him but when he says that
[48:03] I'm not ashamed of you I want you to
[48:07] know I could dance all the way I'd
[48:09] rather dance tonight than preach I could
[48:13] dance all the way from Elkton to
[48:15] grottoes tonight of that thought right
[48:17] there that he is not ashamed of me me
[48:21] being filled with the Holy Ghost and
[48:22] still wake up on Monday and still have
[48:25] thoughts that would make me worthy of
[48:28] death but he would say that I am not
[48:31] ashamed to call them brethren what is it
[48:34] there's a perfect blood on the altar
[48:36] tonight he's included every trouble he's
[48:45] included every mistake enough where he
[48:47] says I am not ashamed to call them
[48:51] breath and what Satan comes up against
[48:55] you
[48:56] Jesus says check the bloodline check out
[49:01] the DNA
[49:02] I know you can spit in the tube and send
[49:04] it off to Kalamazoo and they'll tell you
[49:07] where you came from and tell you where
[49:09] your ancestry is how you lived in this
[49:11] part of the world I know where I came
[49:12] from I ain't got a spitting no tube and
[49:15] spending $100 to know where I came from
[49:17] I came from God and I'm going back to
[49:20] God I didn't come from the Blue Ridge
[49:23] Mountains I came from glory I come from
[49:29] a place where there's gonna be satin on
[49:31] the hills you want to check out my DNA
[49:36] just go over in the book of Hebrews
[49:37] chapter 11 that's my DNA right there
[49:40] don't look at David go look at Daniel
[49:43] don't look go look at go look at Sam go
[49:46] that's my family history there's all
[49:48] kinds of things in my family history
[49:50] that I'm ashamed about but there's
[49:51] nothing in my second birth that I'm
[49:53] ashamed about can I get a witness one
[50:02] time it was a boy that had got himself
[50:04] in trouble he was a good boy but he went
[50:07] to court and the judge said I find you
[50:09] guilty and I must punish you to life in
[50:11] prison he said I want to try my own case
[50:13] it sounded like some of you had a whole
[50:16] a whole lot of things stacked up against
[50:19] you he said I want to try my own case he
[50:22] said I want to go up on my own record he
[50:24] said you have no record your records
[50:27] what's condemning you that's the way it
[50:30] is today the reason the church is not
[50:33] advanced like it should it's the record
[50:35] it's the life we must become more
[50:37] dedicated somebody say more dedicated we
[50:40] must believe every word of God we must
[50:44] seek until that word is made real to us
[50:47] the record is what keeps us from
[50:49] entering it but one time in this same
[50:55] court there was a boy that had no money
[50:57] and he could not pay it off the fine
[51:00] this there was way in a thousands of
[51:03] dollars but he had a big brother that
[51:05] came and paid it all for him now we've
[51:08] got a big brother Jesus the Son of God
[51:10] he came to pay it off for us
[51:13] if we'll just believe it and be able to
[51:15] enter into the veil with him your
[51:18] records what's condemning you but the
[51:20] Bible tells me over in Romans chapter 8
[51:22] there is therefore now no condemnation
[51:24] to them that are in Christ Jesus who
[51:28] walk not after the flesh but after the
[51:30] spirit your record is dismissed Church I
[51:37] want to say it to you your future is
[51:39] clear your future is greater than your
[51:42] past your big brother Jesus is in the
[51:45] house Hebrews 11 and 16 says wherefore
[51:52] God is not ashamed to be called their
[51:55] God somebody say that where for God is
[52:00] not ashamed to be called their God he's

[1:01:13] the presence of angels over one that
[1:01:16] repenteth you just wait you think you've
[1:01:22] seen something you just wait you ain't
[1:01:27] seen nothing yet in larger tents you
[1:01:31] just wait

[1:01:37] think we do sound here I can't wait to
[1:01:40] see what's going on in heaven when this
[1:01:43] joy unspeakable and full of glory coming
[1:01:46] from the throne
[1:01:56] verse 18 I don't know what I've ever
[1:02:05] enjoyed preaching Lord
[1:02:06] I got Satan staring me in the face and I
[1:02:11] got God looking him right back in the
[1:02:12] eye and saying back up
[1:02:23] it's a pleasure for me tonight to stand
[1:02:26] in this position and watch the fight go
[1:02:28] off it's a real joy for me to watch it
[1:02:31] go on tonight for this is what God says
[1:02:34] that I will gather them that are
[1:02:37] sorrowful for the solemn assembly who
[1:02:39] are of V to whom the reproach of it was
[1:02:42] a burden behold at that time I will undo
[1:02:47] God is saying I will deal with this
[1:02:49] devil I will handle this thing I'm big
[1:02:53] enough I'm strong enough I'm mighty
[1:02:55] enough I'm God enough I will undo oh
[1:02:59] that afflicts thee I will save her that
[1:03:03] halter and gather her that was driven
[1:03:05] out God's doing it and I will get them
[1:03:13] praise and fame in every land where they
[1:03:17] have been put to shame that devil tried
[1:03:22] to make a mockery of your life but God's
[1:03:24] getting your Fame and praise in that
[1:03:26] land you may have been looked down upon
[1:03:29] in the community but God's got your
[1:03:32] praise God's got your Fame God's got
[1:03:37] this sister Wanda
[1:03:40] if Joy's coming in the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:44] coming in open up big gates and let the
[1:03:47] King of glory come on in I'm not ashamed
[1:03:57] of the devil don't like me preaching but
[1:04:01] I'm not ashamed of never know like me
[1:04:04] singing the devil don't like my shouting
[1:04:07] there were no like me talking about a
[1:04:09] pillar of fire around here
[1:04:11] but the devil you never know like but I
[1:04:15] know are people that do
[1:04:24] if you like it
[1:04:26] how about preach it to you some more God
[1:04:31] says I will gather them I will bring
[1:04:34] them here I'm going to same to be called
[1:04:37] their brother numbers and daddies
[1:04:40] Pro proclaim the token of your household
[1:04:44] may this be the night may this be the
[1:04:49] night at that time will I bring you
[1:05:06] again even in the time that I gathered
[1:05:10] you for I will make you a name and a
[1:05:13] praise among all the people of the earth
[1:05:19] when the world is promoting himself
[1:05:21] God's promoting you when I turned back
[1:05:26] your captivity when I turn back the
[1:05:29] chains that once held you bound before
[1:05:33] your our safe Lord I will get you praise
[1:05:40] I will
[1:05:43] I wonder tonight if God is the same to
[1:05:48] this scripture how could God be ashamed
[1:05:55] of his own word he's never had a new
[1:05:58] phone he's never had a new word he's not
[1:06:01] ashamed of what he said about you and he
[1:06:04] ain't planning on changing his mind
[1:06:09] through all of your sin through all of
[1:06:12] your mistakes through all of your
[1:06:13] despair when you were in your valley he
[1:06:17] was not ashamed you got you got a few
[1:06:22] more minutes for me now I might as well
[1:06:25] go ahead and exhaust this thought while
[1:06:26] I'm on it
[1:06:29] there's a mighty God amongst us that
[1:06:34] deserves to be praised there's a mighty
[1:06:38] God that has amongst us that deserved to
[1:06:40] be worshipped and the Bible tells me in
[1:06:43] Romans 10:10 that for with the heart man
[1:06:45] believeth unto righteousness and with
[1:06:47] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:06:48] salvation for the scripture saith that
[1:06:51] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:06:53] ashamed are you a witness to that
[1:06:56] scripture tonight the Bible says in 2nd
[1:06:59] Timothy 1 is 7 for God has not given us
[1:07:02] the spirit of fear but of power and of
[1:07:05] love and of a sound mind be not
[1:07:08] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[1:07:10] our Lord God don't want a coward
[1:07:13] God don't want somebody that's the same
[1:07:16] to testify that's afraid to go down to
[1:07:19] the altar
[1:07:20] God don't want somebody that's a shame
[1:07:22] to say that by His stripes I was healed
[1:07:24] they don't want somebody that's ashamed
[1:07:27] to say that God still feels I don't want
[1:07:30] somebody that's a shame to say that God
[1:07:32] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:34] if you're that type of person that's a
[1:07:36] shame to testify God can't use you what
[1:07:41] God wants to do is take that wishbone
[1:07:43] out of you and give you a backbone cell
[1:07:46] like a so long that you'll be able to
[1:07:48] testify to your boss on Monday morning
[1:07:52] David said in Psalms 119 to 46 I will
[1:07:55] speak of thy testimonies before kings
[1:07:58] and I will not be ashamed before David
[1:08:02] was ever in a place of position he was
[1:08:04] testifying to saw that his God was able
[1:08:06] enough that his God was big enough the
[1:08:09] God that delivered me from the hand of
[1:08:10] the bear in a line is more than able to
[1:08:13] deliver me from this giant he was not
[1:08:16] ashamed to testify for the king of a
[1:08:18] kiss and and the Prince of Philistines
[1:08:20] he was not ashamed to testify matter of
[1:08:23] fact when Kings came into David's courts
[1:08:26] when David was the king over Israel
[1:08:28] David before every star before he ever
[1:08:30] started talking about the estate's
[1:08:32] affair or they affair the affairs of the
[1:08:35] state
[1:08:35] he began testifying of the testimonies
[1:08:38] of God
[1:08:39] before we wake up and read about the
[1:08:42] politics of the day we ought to testify
[1:08:44] somebody we ought to testify that
[1:08:48] there's a god that is amongst us that
[1:08:52] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:08:54] forever David wasn't ashamed to testify
[1:08:57] about the three Hebrew children weren't
[1:09:00] afraid to testify about Paul wasn't
[1:09:03] ashamed to testify about it before Nero
[1:09:05] and before Felix and fetus he was not
[1:09:08] ashamed to testify that there was a God
[1:09:10] that was in him a god that was
[1:09:13] delivering him and God that had saved
[1:09:15] him and God that had filled him Paul
[1:09:19] thought that he was worth testifying
[1:09:21] about even through all the afflictions
[1:09:24] that he had to endure he was not ashamed
[1:09:28] you remember when brother bantam went up
[1:09:30] there to miss walk and he come back and
[1:09:32] he told his wife hope he says honey I
[1:09:34] have found the people that is not

[1:09:47] people there that's not ashamed of their
[1:09:49] religion that kind of people's in the
[1:09:52] building tonight if you're ashamed to
[1:09:59] testify before you ever see the promise
[1:10:03] come to pass God can't use you but Mary
[1:10:08] she was not ashamed to say that she had
[1:10:11] met an angel and that she was going to
[1:10:13] bring for the child I want you to know
[1:10:16] that we have met an angel in this day
