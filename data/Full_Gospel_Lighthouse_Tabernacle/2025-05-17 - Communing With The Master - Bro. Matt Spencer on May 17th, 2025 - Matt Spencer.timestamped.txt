[24:18] personal God, he knows our every need.
[24:22] There's not one need that he doesn't
[24:25] know of. He says before we call on him,
[24:27] he already knows it. And before we can

[54:18] Amen. We serve a great God, don't we?
[54:21] Amen. So good to be in the house of the
[54:23] Lord this evening, isn't it? Amen. Amen.
[54:26] My what I tell you what a wonderful time
[54:28] of the Lord we had last weekend with
[54:30] brother Timothy and uh he he just
[54:34] ministered straight to our hearts. Amen.
[54:36] And I was so thankful for that him being
[54:39] here with us and but it's good to be in
[54:41] the house of the Lord this evening
[54:43] again. Amen. Amen. Being with home folk
[54:45] and and uh as brother Timothy said this
[54:49] Timothy Batton said this week we got
[54:50] home cooking this weekend. So you got
[54:53] me. I don't know if that's what you was
[54:56] expecting home cooking. Maybe I'll be
[54:58] little chicken noodle soup or something
[54:59] like that. It's good for the soul every
[55:02] now and then.
[55:04] Amen. So, thank you musicians. I
[55:07] appreciate it. So, but yes, it's so good
[55:09] to be in the house of the Lord this
[55:11] evening and continue to pray for brother
[55:13] Andrew as they're speaking there.
[55:14] Brother Tom Ballers this weekend and
[55:17] him, brother Timothy there and then the
[55:20] Mclards are with them as well joining in
[55:22] in fellowship there. So I want to pray
[55:24] for them. Also want to be just
[55:26] remembering dad this evening. Uh brother
[55:29] Ron there is he's not been feeling well
[55:32] the past two days and so uh he's
[55:35] planning on being here with us in the
[55:36] morning and bring the word of life to us
[55:39] but we just pray that God will heal him
[55:41] this evening as he's there. So he is
[55:43] streaming in by the way of internet. So
[55:45] we say God bless you brother Ron.
[55:47] Appreciate you this evening. Amen. If
[55:50] you would turn with me in your Bibles
[55:52] this evening to
[55:53] Revelations 3 and
[55:56] 20. Revelations 3 and 20. While you're
[56:00] turning there in your scriptures this
[56:02] evening, I'd like to uh speak to you on
[56:05] a thought of communing with the master.
[56:09] Amen. Communing with the master this
[56:12] evening. I had uh intended to go a
[56:15] different route, but the Lord uh seen
[56:18] better. And so, uh, just pray for me
[56:21] that this comes as it came to me. And
[56:25] so, we just, uh, we pray that God will
[56:28] just allow that for us this evening.
[56:30] Revelations 3 and 20 and said, "Behold,
[56:33] I stand at the door and knock. And if
[56:36] any man hear my voice and open the door,
[56:40] I will come into him and will suck with
[56:43] him and he with me."
[56:46] Then I'd like to turn over to Dut
[56:48] Deuteronomy 4 and verse
[57:00] 29. But if from thence thou shalt seek
[57:05] the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him.
[57:09] If thou seek him with all thy heart and
[57:12] with all thy soul. Amen. Let's just pray
[57:16] over these words this evening. Maybe you
[57:19] have a need upon your heart you'd like
[57:20] to say just Lord pass by my way. Our
[57:23] dear most heavenly father, Lord, we
[57:25] thank you for being with us here this
[57:27] evening. Lord, for you said where two or
[57:29] three are gathered in my name, there I
[57:31] be also. Oh God, we have many gathered
[57:34] here, many tuning in. And I ask you that
[57:36] you'll just minister to us this evening.
[57:39] Lord, as we speak on this thought,
[57:41] communing with the master, Lord, your
[57:43] Lord, you're the reason why we're here,
[57:46] Lord, to worship you, to just enter in
[57:48] with you in praise and thanksgiving,
[57:51] God. Lord, we love you so much. Now,
[57:54] God, I ask you that you'll just let me
[57:56] step aside. You step in this vessel and
[57:59] you speak what you'd have need. In Jesus
[58:01] name, we pray these things.
[58:04] Amen. Amen. You can have your seats.
[58:09] As I said this evening, I'd like to take
[58:11] the the thought of communing with the
[58:14] master and our main thought uh behind
[58:17] Revelations 3 and 20. Behold, I stand at
[58:20] the door and
[58:22] knock in a spiritual context. And I'd
[58:25] like to lay a foundation here. Uh the
[58:27] difference between communion and
[58:29] communion becomes even more meaningful.
[58:33] communing with God. This refers to a
[58:37] personal ongoing act of fellowship with
[58:41] God. It's often private involving
[58:44] prayer, worship, meditation, or simply
[58:48] being in God's
[58:50] presence. Oftent times we will draw away
[58:53] to ourselves and we will commune with
[58:55] him.
[58:57] communing and an emphasis on
[59:00] experiencing and an intimacy of a
[59:04] relationship. It's a dynamic moment by
[59:08] moment and hearttoheart
[59:11] communion with God or with others. A
[59:14] spiritual communion refers to the state
[59:17] of
[59:18] being united with God with fellow
[59:22] believers. It also refers to the Lord's
[59:24] supper, a sacred ordinance remembering
[59:28] Christ's death and our union with him.
[59:31] Communion is also corporate, shared in
[59:34] community of believers. It reflects a
[59:38] deeper spiritual unity. So, as we think
[59:41] on these two things this evening with a
[59:44] strong commitment to being more intimate
[59:48] with him in our time with him, communing
[59:52] and communion with others.
[59:54] Behold, I stand at the door and
[59:57] knock. He is there. He is wanting to
[1:00:00] enter in with you. Communion with Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ is entering into an intimate
[1:00:07] fellowship with him where my heart
[1:00:09] speaks to his and his heart whispers
[1:00:13] truth, love, peace into my soul.
[1:00:18] Brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:00:20] in a hidden life. See the sinner comes
[1:00:23] in faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:00:26] of the word. He comes and eats the word.
[1:00:30] Then he's baptized into faith and
[1:00:33] accepts Christ as his personal savior.
[1:00:37] Brings him into then communion with God.
[1:00:41] But then he moves on into the bedroom.
[1:00:45] The still quietness of God where all
[1:00:48] things of the world is shut out. Amen.
[1:00:52] And that's where God wants to be with
[1:00:54] you. Where all things of the world is
[1:00:57] shut out. and that you can commune with
[1:01:00] him in a deeper connection
[1:01:03] in an in an my word in an intimate
[1:01:08] relationship with
[1:01:10] him. It's a sacred connection with li
[1:01:13] with the living Christ beyond mere words
[1:01:16] and awareness of his presence that
[1:01:19] brings comfort, conviction, and
[1:01:20] companionship.
[1:01:22] It'd be like sitting at a table with him
[1:01:26] and breaking bread through prayer,
[1:01:29] scriptures, worship, sharing your
[1:01:32] deepest burdens, your thoughts, but by
[1:01:35] his mercy. It's also a transformative
[1:01:39] relationship. It's an ongoing
[1:01:42] transformative relationship where his
[1:01:45] love shapes your desires, his word
[1:01:48] renews your mind, and his spirit
[1:01:51] empowers your life.
[1:01:55] Communing with the master brings
[1:01:57] intimacy, reverency, and transformative.
[1:02:03] Brother Brandham would say it like this
[1:02:05] in thirst. It says, "When I was a little
[1:02:07] boy, I remember I was raised in a real
[1:02:09] poor family. And I remember many times I
[1:02:12] would go out with the fellas and I
[1:02:14] couldn't dress like to go out to a
[1:02:17] decent place." I don't know. But there
[1:02:20] was something about the people that I
[1:02:22] liked. I like getting with
[1:02:25] them. But I was more or less what they
[1:02:27] called the black sheep. But when I got
[1:02:30] saved and I found something in me, that
[1:02:35] thirst for a friend, somebody that would
[1:02:38] be a buddy to me, somebody that I could
[1:02:41] trust, somebody that you can sit down
[1:02:45] and talk your troubles over with, I
[1:02:47] found that real true satisfaction when I
[1:02:50] found Jesus Christ. That real true
[1:02:53] satisfier that takes away all and
[1:02:56] quenches all that thirst that gives you
[1:02:59] something that just looks like this or
[1:03:02] that, but it he takes the place of all
[1:03:05] of that. He's your buddy. He wants to be
[1:03:08] your buddy. Have you found him as your
[1:03:11] buddy? As the one that you can go to in
[1:03:14] a time of trouble? That's right. And he
[1:03:16] can quench the thirsts of your life,
[1:03:18] that desire of the world that would be
[1:03:21] there. He is the real true satisfaction.
[1:03:25] Amen. Yes, sir. As he stands at the door
[1:03:28] and knocks, he wants to commune. He
[1:03:31] wants to come in and enter with you. As
[1:03:34] brother Brandham would tell this story
[1:03:36] of the painter that had painted a a
[1:03:39] picture, the artist is William Hunt and
[1:03:44] he would paint the picture the light of
[1:03:46] the world. And as brother Brandham would
[1:03:49] say that that painting, it had to go
[1:03:52] through a certain hall of
[1:03:54] critics. And when it went through the
[1:03:56] hall of critics, there's the artist and
[1:03:58] the painting and the critic would come
[1:04:00] and and he would look at the painting
[1:04:03] and he would tell the artist, "It's a
[1:04:05] wonderful picture, wonderful picture of
[1:04:08] Christ, but you missed something. you
[1:04:11] forgot to put a handle on the outside of
[1:04:14] the door where God can enter in with
[1:04:16] you. And he says, "Oh, but that's the
[1:04:19] beauty of the painting." That's right.
[1:04:21] The latch is on the inside and it's your
[1:04:25] part to open the door to let him in with
[1:04:28] you. Amen. So, as he's standing there
[1:04:32] knocking gently, he's not pounding like
[1:04:36] SWAT coming on your door, but he's
[1:04:38] knocking gently, wanting to come in and
[1:04:40] enter with you. That's right. As the
[1:04:43] painting would represent, there's weeds
[1:04:45] all around, darkness all around, but
[1:04:48] there he is holding a lantern. He's the
[1:04:51] light in darkness. He's the light in
[1:04:54] your dark time.
[1:04:56] When your life has been grown up around,
[1:04:59] that's what the weeds would represent in
[1:05:01] the painting. All of that that nature
[1:05:04] and everything that would come in and
[1:05:05] choke out life, he's wanting to come in
[1:05:08] with you. He's wanting to bring light
[1:05:11] into your situation. He's wanting to
[1:05:13] commune with you. It's a great depiction
[1:05:17] of it. The door symbolizes the humano
[1:05:20] human heart often neglected or shut off
[1:05:25] by divine
[1:05:26] influence. No handle signifies that
[1:05:29] Christ will not force entry. That's it.
[1:05:32] He awaits and your willing acceptance.
[1:05:36] The lantern represents the light of
[1:05:38] truth and salvation that Christ brings.
[1:05:42] The nighttime setting suggests the world
[1:05:46] or a soul in darkness without Christ.
[1:05:51] And Jesus's posture in the painting,
[1:05:53] gentle, patient, suggesting love and
[1:05:57] longsuffering
[1:05:59] because that's what he is to you
[1:06:02] in all of that. He wants to commune with
[1:06:05] you in all of your life. He wants to be
[1:06:09] part of you. He wants to fellowship with
[1:06:12] you. Amen. That's why he came to be with
[1:06:15] us. I can just imagine it as Adam and
[1:06:18] God would walk through the garden in the
[1:06:20] cool of the day talking, communing
[1:06:23] together.
[1:06:25] There was no Bible but the stars and
[1:06:29] there they
[1:06:30] were the cool of the evening. The where
[1:06:34] we're heading to. That's right. Where we
[1:06:36] are going to a true communion with him.
[1:06:40] Amen. as they would walk through the
[1:06:41] garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[1:06:43] would just tell him some of the thoughts
[1:06:45] of the animals that he was about to
[1:06:47] name. But there was a longing for
[1:06:49] something more. Even Adam wanted
[1:06:52] something more in himself something to
[1:06:54] love.
[1:06:56] And he pulled it out of his side. He
[1:06:59] will pull something out of your side. He
[1:07:02] will bring a helpmate to you. Someone
[1:07:04] that you can even commune with. Amen.
[1:07:06] Amen. You can have that intimate
[1:07:08] relationship with a time of communing
[1:07:12] with each other, a time of fellowship
[1:07:14] with each other. But as God walking with
[1:07:17] Adam, fellowshipping with Adam, my what
[1:07:20] a wonderful time that would have been.
[1:07:22] But see, we're going back to that.
[1:07:25] That's where I plan on hitting.
[1:07:27] One of these mornings, you're going to
[1:07:29] find me over in the valley somewhere,
[1:07:31] and you're going to be, I wonder where
[1:07:33] Brother Matthew's at. As brother Brandon
[1:07:35] would say, you'll hear me whistling,
[1:07:37] maybe coming up the hill and there I'll
[1:07:40] be I might be with a whitetail buck as
[1:07:42] he's walking up the along the way. I'll
[1:07:45] be like, "No, I hunt it with against you
[1:07:48] down here on the earth."
[1:07:51] But here, we're communing.
[1:07:53] You're beautiful.
[1:07:55] That that's the type of relationship
[1:07:57] that we're going to have there. A type
[1:08:00] of just quietness. You can enter into
[1:08:02] that communion state with God.
[1:08:08] Like to take a couple of examples
[1:08:10] through the Bible that where Jesus would
[1:08:12] would commune
[1:08:14] maybe and I don't want to make this a an
[1:08:18] eating sermon where there's many meals
[1:08:21] and you get you all hungry and
[1:08:22] everything, but that's in the Bible.
[1:08:25] That's where a lot of Jesus's communion
[1:08:27] was was around the tables. And that's
[1:08:29] where we all gather a lot too. Amen.
[1:08:34] Maybe too
[1:08:35] much. We went through the creek bid this
[1:08:37] evening. I told the kids, I said, "I
[1:08:39] might not should have ate the extra
[1:08:40] piece of cake. I I think I overweighted
[1:08:43] the Jedha and it sunk a little lower
[1:08:44] into the creek."
[1:08:48] But in the Bible, we read in Matthew n 9
[1:08:53] and 10, and Jesus would be there walking
[1:08:56] through the streets and he would call a
[1:08:59] certain man, Matthew the tax collector.
[1:09:02] Nobody would have thought that he would
[1:09:03] call the tax collector. Nobody liked
[1:09:06] him. Nobody wanted to fellowship with
[1:09:08] him. But one day as he walked along the
[1:09:11] way, he said, "Follow me.
[1:09:15] Follow me.
[1:09:17] And I could just imagine Matthew's
[1:09:19] feeling as he's sitting there in his tax
[1:09:21] booth and and many of you might have
[1:09:23] watched The Chosen, but you know, it's
[1:09:25] just that feeling of he's calling you to
[1:09:29] follow me. Just real simple. Follow me.
[1:09:34] He wants to commune with you. And as
[1:09:37] they would walk along the way, Matthew
[1:09:39] would then maybe suggest, "I have a
[1:09:41] table that's all set. I've been lonely.
[1:09:45] I have had no one to eat with, but I
[1:09:47] have all of this food that's prepared.
[1:09:50] Maybe you you and your friends will come
[1:09:53] and and sit at my table this evening.
[1:09:56] And he would just enter in there. But
[1:09:58] you see, even the Pharisees would then
[1:10:01] Oh, look at this man. He dwells with
[1:10:04] drunkers, harlots, people like this tax
[1:10:08] collector.
[1:10:10] But see, he was looking for someone that
[1:10:13] wanted to commune with him as well. They
[1:10:16] just wanted a form of religion.
[1:10:19] But Matthew was seeking something more
[1:10:21] on the inside than just a form of
[1:10:24] religion. He was seeking a communion
[1:10:27] with him. He was seeking a drawing, a
[1:10:30] closer as Jesus would then say, "The
[1:10:34] sick don't need a doctor,
[1:10:36] but this is who I've come to. these
[1:10:38] right here is who I've come to. As he
[1:10:41] would just sit there at those tables and
[1:10:43] and he would break bread with each and
[1:10:45] every one of them teaching them along
[1:10:48] the way.
[1:10:52] Don't you just want to follow him? Amen.
[1:10:55] Amen.
[1:10:57] In first John 1 and
[1:11:01] 7 and it says, "But if you walk in the
[1:11:05] light as he is the light, that's it. We
[1:11:07] have fellowship one with another. And
[1:11:10] the blood of Jesus Christ, his son,
[1:11:13] cleanses us from all sins.
[1:11:18] And I'd like to place an emphasis on
[1:11:20] fellowship, one with the other.
[1:11:24] The word fellowship and commune in the
[1:11:27] Bible is in a Greek word is cornonia
[1:11:33] which meaning fellowship, sharing,
[1:11:36] participation, communion and close
[1:11:40] relationship. It's used to describe the
[1:11:43] intimate spiritual connection both
[1:11:46] between believers and between believers
[1:11:49] God and Christ.
[1:11:53] In Philippians 3:10 it says that I may
[1:11:56] know
[1:11:57] him and in the power of his resurrection
[1:12:00] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:12:03] being made conformable unto his death.
[1:12:08] So we talk so when we're talking about
[1:12:10] communion with the master we're really
[1:12:13] talking about enter into cornonia a deep
[1:12:17] shared participation in his life his
[1:12:21] love and his presence that's where we
[1:12:24] can find fellowship is through him
[1:12:29] brother Brandon would preach a sermon
[1:12:30] called fellowship and I I believe it was
[1:12:32] 1962 and I adore you to go listen to
[1:12:35] that that's where I draw a lot of this
[1:12:37] from this evening is fellowship under
[1:12:39] the blood of Jesus Christ. But that's
[1:12:43] where us as believers can draw
[1:12:45] fellowship. There's no other way as
[1:12:48] believers that we can go but by the
[1:12:51] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:53] Amen. And he and brother Brandon would
[1:12:55] go down through Numbers 19 and he would
[1:12:57] show how that that red heer that they
[1:13:00] would bring that red on red in
[1:13:03] scientifically matters. It would say red
[1:13:05] on red. You'd look through it and it
[1:13:07] would be white. Representing that blood
[1:13:10] of Jesus Christ washes away all your
[1:13:14] sins and they would go and they would
[1:13:16] take and take that blood of that heer
[1:13:19] and they would sprinkle it there and
[1:13:21] then the waters of separation
[1:13:24] and they would take you in. But that's
[1:13:26] where we are is then we take that waters
[1:13:29] of washing of the word by the washing of
[1:13:32] the word that's where we can find the
[1:13:33] blood of Jesus Christ upon our life.
[1:13:37] Amen. And we can fellowship with him as
[1:13:41] as the story tells of the king that
[1:13:43] would throw a banquet and the bridegroom
[1:13:45] there for the banquet there would be
[1:13:47] given garments to each and everyone that
[1:13:50] would enter in. And no one could enter
[1:13:53] in except through him. But then there
[1:13:56] come a man that was maybe a beggar that
[1:13:59] was maybe fellowshipping around the
[1:14:03] banquet and table, but he didn't have
[1:14:05] the garment from the bridegroom. That's
[1:14:08] right. He came in another way. But see,
[1:14:11] there's only one way that you can come
[1:14:14] into fellowship with Jesus, and that's
[1:14:16] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:19] There's no other way. That's right.
[1:14:21] None. know the way that you can enter in
[1:14:24] and then you're fit for garments of
[1:14:26] praise. Amen. And he'd say it in an Old
[1:14:31] Testament and I'm sorry to be so ready
[1:14:33] this evening and uh forgive me.
[1:14:36] In the Old Testament when a believer
[1:14:39] came to up to worship and he had done
[1:14:42] something wrong, he could not unless he
[1:14:45] came by the blood. What did he do? He
[1:14:49] brought his lamb, walked it up to the
[1:14:51] priest. The priest examined the lamb to
[1:14:54] see if it was a good lamb, perfect. Then
[1:14:56] he'd lay his hands upon the lamb and
[1:14:58] confess his sins. And then his sins
[1:15:01] would transfer from him to the lamb. The
[1:15:04] lamb must die because he's not a sinner
[1:15:08] anymore. But the lamb, they cut his
[1:15:12] throat, the blood ran out, the
[1:15:14] sprinkling thereon, and burned it on the
[1:15:16] fire. All right. Notice now that would
[1:15:21] be good enough. But why why didn't that
[1:15:24] work? It was showing that there was
[1:15:27] coming something greater because the
[1:15:29] blood of the goat and the sheep could
[1:15:32] not atone for sin. It could only cover
[1:15:35] it, but it couldn't divorce it. Why? The
[1:15:39] spirit, that's the life, that's the
[1:15:41] blood cell in that chemistry. The blood
[1:15:44] of that life, the blood cell was in that
[1:15:47] sheep's life and the sheep that died.
[1:15:51] And that sheep's life could not come
[1:15:52] back upon the worshipper. Therefore, it
[1:15:55] could not work.
[1:15:57] But when we come by the way of Calvary
[1:16:02] by the faith, by faith lay your hands
[1:16:04] upon the lamb of God, and his blood cell
[1:16:08] was broke, which was not neither Jew nor
[1:16:11] Gentile. He was God. And we on the
[1:16:15] unadulterated blood, not by sex, but by
[1:16:18] a creative act of Jehovah himself, who
[1:16:22] created the blood cell in the womb of
[1:16:26] the virgin and brought forth the son of
[1:16:28] God. He was not he was not no son of
[1:16:32] Mary. No, you Catholics call her the
[1:16:36] mother of God. He didn't even call her
[1:16:38] mother one time. He called her woman.
[1:16:41] And that's what she was. She was the
[1:16:44] incubator of God that God used just like
[1:16:47] that that he could use any other person.
[1:16:51] She was no mother of God. God has no
[1:16:54] mother. He was God alone. In him dwelt
[1:16:58] fullness of godhead bodily. And I want
[1:17:00] you to catch this part right here real
[1:17:02] good. Here it says when we lay our hands
[1:17:04] upon there and confess that we that he
[1:17:08] is our savior, our god and when we lay
[1:17:12] our hands upon him by faith and the
[1:17:15] blood that was shed there on Calvary, we
[1:17:18] are brought into a fellowship. There you
[1:17:21] go. And the Holy Spirit that was the
[1:17:24] blood cell returns back to the believer.
[1:17:27] That's why it had to be Calvary. making
[1:17:30] him a son or a daughter of God, then we
[1:17:34] have fellowship.
[1:17:36] And if the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible,
[1:17:38] how can the Holy Ghost under the blood
[1:17:41] that you've accepted ever come back and
[1:17:44] deny the word? So when you've accepted
[1:17:46] that blood on your situation, it cannot
[1:17:49] come back on you. It can't deny the
[1:17:52] word. And there's the fellowship under
[1:17:55] the blood. Give the Lord praise because
[1:17:58] that's where you can find fellowship
[1:18:01] under that blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:05] You can go around the world and find
[1:18:07] believers around the world that's
[1:18:09] following the same message and they're
[1:18:12] shed and they're underneath the shed
[1:18:13] blood of Jesus Christ. I've I've had the
[1:18:16] opportunity to go to many churches, many
[1:18:18] message churches around the world here.
[1:18:21] And every single time you go in and you
[1:18:23] fellowship with them, it's like you've
[1:18:25] known them forever.
[1:18:27] Thank you, Lord. And maybe I don't even
[1:18:29] know their names. Maybe I don't even
[1:18:31] know their faces, but when you get to
[1:18:33] talking to them, when you get to
[1:18:35] fellowshipping with them, you find there
[1:18:38] is a re a representation there. It's
[1:18:41] that shed blood and you have something
[1:18:44] in common. Amen. So that's where
[1:18:48] believers can fellowship is underneath
[1:18:51] that shed blood and it's by revelation.
[1:18:54] Revelation is what draws us here.
[1:18:57] Revelation is what brings us here to
[1:18:59] this point. By revelation, not by
[1:19:03] education. It's by revelation.
[1:19:06] Abel saw that it wasn't bananas, apples
[1:19:10] that Eve ate. He offered the blood. God
[1:19:13] accepted it, revealed that to him. See,
[1:19:16] there's that revelation that Abel was
[1:19:19] able to find. And he was slain by his
[1:19:21] brother Cain.
[1:19:23] And Jesus would ask the disciples said,
[1:19:26] "Who do you say I am?"
[1:19:28] Some say Moses, some say Elijah, and so
[1:19:31] forth. The supernatural stirs such
[1:19:35] things. But Peter said, "Thou art the
[1:19:38] Christ, the son of the living God." And
[1:19:41] he said, "Blessed art thou, Simon, thy
[1:19:43] son of Jonas. Flesh and blood did not
[1:19:46] reveal this to you. Neither learned in a
[1:19:48] se seminary. It wasn't just a word
[1:19:52] altogether, but the father which was in
[1:19:54] heaven revealed that to you." Amen. See,
[1:19:57] it's by revelation of the word, the
[1:20:00] washing of the word, and communion with
[1:20:03] him. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:20:08] Forgive
[1:20:09] me. In another instance, we see Jesus
[1:20:14] longing fellowship with another man by
[1:20:17] the name of Zakius. And Zakius was
[1:20:20] desiring something as well. and he heard
[1:20:23] all the stir in the city, everything
[1:20:26] that would go around. So maybe help me
[1:20:28] dramatize this a little bit this evening
[1:20:30] as as Zakius would maybe hear him coming
[1:20:33] down the street little in stature and he
[1:20:37] wanted to see him but nobody wanted to
[1:20:39] have nothing to do with Zakius as well
[1:20:41] because he was a tax collector as well.
[1:20:44] must have been something about
[1:20:45] accountant.
[1:20:48] And Zakius wanted to see Jesus along the
[1:20:52] way. He had heard the stories. Maybe he
[1:20:55] had seen some of the miracles, but he
[1:20:57] said, "I want to get closer." And he
[1:20:59] would climb up a tree and get up in
[1:21:01] there and brother Brandon would say
[1:21:03] maybe he fell down the trash can. Trash
[1:21:04] got all over him. Got all nasty looking.
[1:21:07] But he's there in the tree and here
[1:21:09] comes Jesus walking by and he looks
[1:21:13] up. Now what are you doing up there?
[1:21:17] Zakius, you come down from there today.
[1:21:20] I'm going to your house.
[1:21:23] Amen. And I can just picture Zakius in
[1:21:25] his heart
[1:21:27] thinking me?
[1:21:29] Why? Why me? Nobody wants to have
[1:21:32] nothing to do with me. But see, he
[1:21:34] wanted fellowship with him.
[1:21:37] Amen. And a lot of us along our way, we
[1:21:40] had a lot of garbage on us.
[1:21:43] We had a lot of things, a lot of baggage
[1:21:45] in our life that we thought there's no
[1:21:48] way that we could ever come in
[1:21:49] underneath that fellowship with like
[1:21:52] believers. Amen. And Zakius would hurry
[1:21:56] down, scuffle down, and and he would run
[1:21:59] with Jesus. maybe not run, but the now
[1:22:02] with the crowd and all of them pressing
[1:22:04] towards Zakius's house and he opens the
[1:22:06] door and says, "Rebecca,
[1:22:10] guess who I have
[1:22:12] now?" She was a believer and she was
[1:22:15] praying for Zakius. And she said, "I
[1:22:18] know who it is. Oh, it's Jesus." And as
[1:22:22] they begin to eat, he didn't preach a
[1:22:25] sermon to him. Right. And as he was
[1:22:27] there, his presence changed him. Not a
[1:22:32] word. And he said, "All that I have,
[1:22:36] I'll give to the poor. If I've done
[1:22:38] anyone wrong, I'm going to I'll I'll
[1:22:41] take it back. I want to do all of this
[1:22:44] for you. For
[1:22:47] you." And that's why Jesus come to his
[1:22:50] house.
[1:22:52] That's why Jesus come to dwell with him.
[1:22:56] Even his presence alone will change your
[1:22:59] life. Amen.
[1:23:02] That's why when we go into power of
[1:23:05] prayer, when we seek after
[1:23:07] him, when you're just wanting a more of
[1:23:10] a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[1:23:14] he's drawing on you. And it's just that
[1:23:17] presence that can change your life.
[1:23:20] Amen. Brother Brandon would tell a story
[1:23:23] of an older gentleman and a preacher
[1:23:26] that would go hunting and his name was
[1:23:28] Gabriel and they would call him Gabe for
[1:23:31] short. And they would go hunting out
[1:23:33] together and he was not a
[1:23:36] believer. But as they would go out
[1:23:38] hunting this day, they they killed a lot
[1:23:41] of game, a lot of rabbits, a lot of
[1:23:43] squirrels, and they're packing it back.
[1:23:45] And and as they're packing it
[1:23:48] back, there's there's Gabe and and he
[1:23:51] just kind of stops and he's looking and
[1:23:53] and and the
[1:23:55] minister stops and turns and and Gabe
[1:23:59] turns and says,
[1:24:02] "Pastor, I'm not going to miss another
[1:24:04] Sunday service." Amen.
[1:24:07] Well, well, why, Gabe? Why? Why would
[1:24:10] you say this? What changed your heart,
[1:24:12] Gabe? For years, I've been trying to get
[1:24:14] you to come to church. For years, your
[1:24:16] wife has been trying to get you to come
[1:24:18] to church. He said, "Well, pastor, you
[1:24:22] see all this game?" Said, "I'm a
[1:24:24] terrible
[1:24:25] shot, and you see the sun setting over
[1:24:28] there, and I got to thinking, the sun is
[1:24:32] setting in my life." Oh, yeah. And God's
[1:24:35] been real good to me.
[1:24:38] He's been a lot better to me than I've
[1:24:40] been to him. And you see, he gave me all
[1:24:43] this gain because I'm a horrible shot.
[1:24:45] No way could I have ever have done this.
[1:24:49] And I got to thinking what all God did
[1:24:51] for me. Tears rolling down his face. And
[1:24:54] the pastor said, "Well, well, maybe was
[1:24:56] it one of my sermons that I preached
[1:24:58] that maybe somebody told you about? Or
[1:25:00] was it something that the choir sang
[1:25:03] that was so beautiful?" We said, "No,
[1:25:05] no, it was his presence that came and
[1:25:09] entered in my life." Amen. Amen. I just,
[1:25:12] you know, I I find it amazing so many
[1:25:14] times that in a lot of people's life,
[1:25:18] the presence of God comes when you don't
[1:25:22] even expect it.
[1:25:25] Many of us sitting here tonight, we
[1:25:27] didn't we didn't come to the Lord maybe
[1:25:29] to an altar, maybe in a church service.
[1:25:32] Amen. But it's that time when God speaks
[1:25:36] to you and you catch it. Amen. And the
[1:25:40] light comes on and his presence fills
[1:25:42] you so much. Thank you, Lord. Until
[1:25:45] everything that's laying there on the
[1:25:47] inside of you is gone. Amen. You don't
[1:25:51] have a desire for it no more. Thank you,
[1:25:53] Lord. And God just in a moment,
[1:25:57] hallelujah, thirsts for things of the
[1:26:00] world, gone.
[1:26:02] That's why when you find the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:04] that's what we're praying for our youth
[1:26:07] is that when you find that Holy Ghost,
[1:26:09] I don't care where you're at. That's
[1:26:11] right. You just be ready and willing for
[1:26:13] when he comes, you accept it. And say
[1:26:18] that's his presence.
[1:26:20] That's what they've been talking about.
[1:26:24] So maybe you can go to a a post and say
[1:26:28] right here, this is where it happened.
[1:26:31] This is how it happened.
[1:26:33] Same way with
[1:26:35] Zakius. He didn't think it would ever
[1:26:37] happen to him.
[1:26:39] But his life changed completely
[1:26:44] because of fellowship that Jesus was
[1:26:47] communing with him that day. Amen. In
[1:26:50] that time, sir. And we go on to another
[1:26:53] little lady in the in the scriptures.
[1:26:56] And this evening, I'd like to take this
[1:26:59] lady that went to Simon the Pharisees
[1:27:02] house, and I'd like to name her. She's
[1:27:05] not named in the Bible, but I would like
[1:27:07] to name her maybe Leah this evening, but
[1:27:10] she's
[1:27:11] tendered. And I'd like you to bear with
[1:27:13] me here because the
[1:27:16] religious leaders of that day did not
[1:27:20] want to have nothing to do with her.
[1:27:23] So, as Leah would hear Jesus going to
[1:27:29] Simon's
[1:27:30] house and she would just take her bottle
[1:27:35] alabaster of special ointment and she
[1:27:39] wanted something from Jesus. She desired
[1:27:44] something more than anyone could ever
[1:27:47] have given her. Although her life was
[1:27:51] all tattered, all torn, she could hear
[1:27:54] the whispers, she could see the
[1:27:57] eyes, but she pressed through Simon's
[1:28:01] gate and she found Jesus.
[1:28:04] When Simon wouldn't greet him, wouldn't
[1:28:07] wash his feet. That's right. Wouldn't
[1:28:09] give him a garment, wouldn't give him a
[1:28:11] kiss and welcome
[1:28:13] him, here she come.
[1:28:17] pressed through it all. And Simon
[1:28:19] thought, if he only knew who she was,
[1:28:25] who she really was, he wouldn't let this
[1:28:28] lady be
[1:28:30] here. And I can see her as she begins to
[1:28:34] have
[1:28:35] fellowship with him.
[1:28:38] Tears are flowing so abundantly out of
[1:28:40] her, she can't stop washing the dung and
[1:28:44] the dust the mar off of his feet. And
[1:28:48] she does one of the most unthinkable
[1:28:50] things and undoes her
[1:28:53] hair. And as she's
[1:28:55] crying, wipes his
[1:28:58] feet. She's
[1:29:00] worshiping, fellowshipping with him.
[1:29:02] Amen. wiping his feet as her hair just
[1:29:07] brushed across his feet. She then takes
[1:29:10] out the alabaster box, costly perfume
[1:29:14] that had cost so much, but yet this was
[1:29:19] nothing compared to what was about to
[1:29:22] happen in her life. And she would pour
[1:29:26] out all of her perfume on his feet. And
[1:29:31] there they sit, sneering,
[1:29:34] snarling, thinking, "Leah, nobody wants
[1:29:39] you. Nobody desires you." But she didn't
[1:29:43] care. She knew she had a purpose.
[1:29:48] That's some of us.
[1:29:51] Some of us, the religious world did not
[1:29:55] want any of us. They don't want any of
[1:29:58] us.
[1:30:00] But he does. And he chose to come by
[1:30:03] your way, come by your house to draw you
[1:30:08] to him to fellowship.
[1:30:11] Thank you, Lord. And Simon would sit
[1:30:13] there and he'd say,
[1:30:16] "Simon, if there was two people, one had
[1:30:20] great debt and the other had little and
[1:30:23] both were forgiven, who do you think
[1:30:25] would love him more?"
[1:30:27] And he said, "Probably the one that was
[1:30:31] forgiven great." And he'd said,
[1:30:33] "Rightfully so." And see now, little
[1:30:38] Leah, one that nobody wanted, but I'm
[1:30:42] going to draw through you a lineage.
[1:30:47] I'm going to take from you somebody
[1:30:49] that's going to worship me, a bride
[1:30:52] through you,
[1:30:54] that'll give him praise, that'll worship
[1:30:57] him, that'll wash his feet. Amen. By the
[1:31:01] watering water of the word, that'll wash
[1:31:03] Yes, sir. Wash and cleanse yourself
[1:31:06] within.
[1:31:08] Your sins, your sins are forgiven.
[1:31:14] Can you
[1:31:15] imagine? I'm sure you can. All of us
[1:31:18] have sins in our lives. But as she's
[1:31:21] sitting there, she might take that
[1:31:23] little bottle now empty,
[1:31:26] now feeling a little lighter, happier,
[1:31:30] not a care in the world, who even seen
[1:31:33] her, what she looks like, how she came,
[1:31:36] just crying. And I can see her maybe go
[1:31:39] back to her house and set that little
[1:31:41] owl baster box there on the shelf.
[1:31:45] Maybe as a little
[1:31:47] trophy she can look to every now and
[1:31:50] then she's setting Eden dinner or
[1:31:52] something and she'll look at it and she
[1:31:54] that's when my first time I had
[1:31:57] fellowship with him. There it is that
[1:32:00] time and she remembers every little
[1:32:03] detail of her fellowship. the first time
[1:32:07] she ever fellowshipped with
[1:32:09] him. All of us can say, "I remember that
[1:32:12] first time I fellowship with him."
[1:32:17] One of my greatest times that I ever
[1:32:19] remember was at brother Tim Puit's youth
[1:32:23] services and receiving the baptism of
[1:32:25] the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:27] Now I can take that just as she took and
[1:32:30] set that there and I can look back to
[1:32:33] that moment that time when I have a down
[1:32:36] time when I have something on the inside
[1:32:39] and it's like you just really don't but
[1:32:42] I can take it back to that time that's
[1:32:45] right say Satan
[1:32:48] you gone
[1:32:51] I found fellowship with him
[1:32:55] amen Yeah.
[1:33:02] Don't you just love him? Amen.
[1:33:07] As she's sitting there washing his feet,
[1:33:11] sins being forgiven, all
[1:33:13] gone. Go in
[1:33:15] peace. I can
[1:33:17] just just imagine her
[1:33:20] there. Another little lady in the
[1:33:23] scriptures that desired fellowship.
[1:33:26] Little lady called
[1:33:27] Mary. Little Mary. Mary and Martha
[1:33:31] there. Jesus would enter into the house
[1:33:34] and and Martha busy all busy about
[1:33:38] trying to do everything, make everything
[1:33:40] just perfect for Jesus, getting
[1:33:42] everything ready. And there he
[1:33:44] was opening scriptures and telling
[1:33:47] stories.
[1:33:49] Amen. talking about maybe some of his
[1:33:53] past travels and Mary sitting attentive
[1:33:56] at the feet of
[1:33:58] Jesus
[1:34:00] listening and Martha busy about the
[1:34:02] house doing things going to and from in
[1:34:05] the
[1:34:06] house and then she'd come and she would
[1:34:09] want to bring something to Jesus and
[1:34:12] and Jesus please tell my sister Mary
[1:34:17] tell her to get up and help me tell her
[1:34:20] I I need some help. She's just wanting
[1:34:23] to listen to your stories. That's just
[1:34:26] the way she is.
[1:34:29] Lord,
[1:34:31] a lot of us in our
[1:34:32] life. We can identify with Martha. Amen.
[1:34:36] We're busy and we're going now. Jesus,
[1:34:39] why don't come why don't you just come
[1:34:41] over here? Tell tell them to help me.
[1:34:46] But he say amen. Mary is doing the
[1:34:49] greater part.
[1:34:52] Martha Mary is sitting listening and
[1:34:56] soaking in what I have for her. See, I'm
[1:35:00] not always going to be here like this.
[1:35:04] So, she's going to have to draw this.
[1:35:08] She's going to have to go back and
[1:35:11] fellowship.
[1:35:13] See, Mary was soaking it all in.
[1:35:17] Many times that's the way we do. We come
[1:35:19] to church and and we'll soak it in. Some
[1:35:22] people soak it in with their eyes
[1:35:27] closed. Some people don't need to
[1:35:29] worship and and fellowship like some of
[1:35:31] the others. They they they have a a
[1:35:34] spongelike scrub daddy
[1:35:37] effect. They can take it all
[1:35:40] in peacefully.
[1:35:49] many different t types of fellowship.
[1:35:55] So don't look down on other people's
[1:35:57] fellowship. Amen. While they're
[1:35:59] fellowship,
[1:36:00] but I pray that you stay awake while we
[1:36:04] fellowship. Not soak it all in. Amen.
[1:36:10] But Jesus is knocking at your door.
[1:36:14] He's wanting to enter into your heart in
[1:36:16] your situation in every moment of your
[1:36:19] life. He's not just calling preachers,
[1:36:23] prophets, evangelists, teachers, but
[1:36:25] he's calling all of us. Each and every
[1:36:28] one of us. He's calling for a more of
[1:36:31] commitment of fellowship in your life.
[1:36:34] Amen.
[1:36:37] He's inviting you to his table.
[1:36:42] I came here the other the other morning.
[1:36:44] I had dropped Titus off and I had to do
[1:36:46] some things and and I just stood here
[1:36:48] behind the pull pit and I just thought
[1:36:51] one of these
[1:36:53] days I'm going to look around and I'm
[1:36:56] going to see each and every one of you
[1:36:58] sitting across from me at a table.
[1:37:01] Amen.
[1:37:03] And let me just say I entered into
[1:37:06] fellowship in that moment there.
[1:37:10] There was a presence that
[1:37:12] came. It's almost as if I could see us
[1:37:15] all sitting
[1:37:16] there, sitting at that table of
[1:37:19] fellowship.
[1:37:22] And I would sit there and I know that
[1:37:24] that's my
[1:37:27] place. And that nobody's going to come
[1:37:29] and take that place from me.
[1:37:33] You know, it's kind of like when you go
[1:37:34] into a room of important people and you
[1:37:37] go to sit down and then they come to you
[1:37:38] and they tell you, "Hey, now that's not
[1:37:41] your seat there. You need to come over
[1:37:43] here." But see, that's not going to
[1:37:46] happen for you or for me when we get
[1:37:50] there because he's seen you was going to
[1:37:53] be there
[1:37:55] and he's preparing his table for you.
[1:38:00] We want to be with him.
[1:38:02] But he wants to be more with us.
[1:38:06] He wants to be more with you than even
[1:38:09] you want to be with him. That's why he's
[1:38:12] knocking on your doors today.
[1:38:16] That's why he wants you to open up.
[1:38:19] Let him come in. Let him come into your
[1:38:22] whole heart. He don't just want just the
[1:38:24] living room. He wants the whole heart.
[1:38:28] Amen. He don't just want to be closed
[1:38:30] off to certain little things, certain
[1:38:33] little details in your life. He wants
[1:38:36] you to open up completely in your heart
[1:38:39] to him. Amen. So that when he walks
[1:38:42] through, he's given all permission,
[1:38:46] to clean house, so to say, of everything
[1:38:49] that's in your closets, everything
[1:38:51] that's in your past. Amen. See, that
[1:38:54] shed blood is not just just a little
[1:38:56] sprinkling of it to get rid of partial
[1:38:59] sin. It's to get rid of all your sin.
[1:39:04] And that's where you want to let him in.
[1:39:08] In John 15:4, it says, "Abide in me and
[1:39:12] I in you."
[1:39:13] In Psalms 27 and4 it says, "One thing
[1:39:16] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[1:39:19] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:39:21] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:39:26] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:39:28] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[1:39:31] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:39:33] pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:39:35] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:39:38] set me upon the rock." in Acts 4
[1:39:42] and13 and it's talking about Peter and
[1:39:46] John and
[1:39:48] behold they saw the boldness of Peter
[1:39:52] and John and perceived that there were
[1:39:55] unlearned and ignorant men and they
[1:39:58] marveled
[1:40:00] and took knowledge of them that they had
[1:40:03] been with Jesus. That's right. Thank
[1:40:06] you. Amen. See, even the Pharisees knew
[1:40:11] the ignorant and unlearned, two
[1:40:13] disciples sitting here teaching and
[1:40:16] telling things now had been with Jesus.
[1:40:20] There's no way that they could have done
[1:40:22] it any other way. Amen. Your life is the
[1:40:27] same way. People see you and then they
[1:40:30] say they've been with Jesus because
[1:40:33] there's something on the inside that's
[1:40:36] different. There's something that's
[1:40:38] changed. Yes, sir. Amen. Thank you,
[1:40:40] Lord. Amen. I like this story here and I
[1:40:43] and I'm bringing her down, but I want
[1:40:45] you to bear with me here on on finding
[1:40:48] him and the presence of
[1:40:52] him. Brother Brandham would tell this
[1:40:54] story. He says, "When I was a boy, I
[1:40:56] tried to do everything. I'd done
[1:40:59] everything I was big enough to do and
[1:41:01] lots of thing that I wasn't big enough
[1:41:03] to
[1:41:04] do. I'd love to hunt and I thought that
[1:41:07] was it." My daddy was a rider and I
[1:41:10] thought if I could ever get west and
[1:41:13] break them horses.
[1:41:15] Oh, brother. One time way back yonder in
[1:41:19] the mountains of Arizona bringing down a
[1:41:21] herd of cattle one night I was sitting
[1:41:24] there and a boy named Slim had an old
[1:41:28] comb had a piece of paper over it and he
[1:41:31] was playing another fellow sitting there
[1:41:34] from Texas with a guitar strumming and
[1:41:37] they come onto a hymn. I had my saddle
[1:41:41] off the horse laying down with my head
[1:41:44] using as a pillow, my bank blanket over
[1:41:47] me. And there still my boots on, pair of
[1:41:51] spurs holding me off the ground. And he
[1:41:54] began to strum, down at the cross where
[1:41:58] my savior died, down where for cleansing
[1:42:01] from sin I cried. There to my heart was
[1:42:05] the blood applied. Glory to his name. I
[1:42:09] tried to pull the blanket up and stop my
[1:42:12] ears. I'd look up and the stars hanging
[1:42:17] low and them whispering pines in the
[1:42:19] mountains seeming to cry,
[1:42:22] "Adam, where art thou?"
[1:42:26] Oh, the cattle raising was just a
[1:42:29] secondary thing. I wanted to find God
[1:42:33] way back out there kicked up their pair
[1:42:36] on them pair of spurs. I said, "Sir, I
[1:42:40] don't know who you are, but don't punish
[1:42:43] me until I can find the real thing." Two
[1:42:46] days after that, down in the city,
[1:42:49] sitting there after a few days after
[1:42:52] that, after the roundup, I was sitting
[1:42:55] there, old park bench, little Spanish
[1:42:59] girl come by. And when I was sitting
[1:43:01] there thinking about God, what it could
[1:43:04] be, old girl come by
[1:43:07] and just about
[1:43:09] 18year-old boy, she dropped her
[1:43:13] handkerchief and walked by. And I said,
[1:43:16] "Woman, you dropped your
[1:43:19] handkerchief." Just the thoughts of God
[1:43:21] had changed my desires.
[1:43:25] My poor Irish heart was hungering. I
[1:43:28] wanted something something that
[1:43:31] satisfied. God has given me the
[1:43:33] privilege of hunting all over the world.
[1:43:36] Africa, India, across the mountains,
[1:43:38] Canada, on some of the greatest
[1:43:41] trips and caught world
[1:43:44] records. That's all all right. But
[1:43:47] there's nothing that'll take the place
[1:43:50] of the power of the living God
[1:43:52] descending into your soul. Amen.
[1:43:57] And that's where the presence of God can
[1:44:00] come in.
[1:44:03] As he's sitting there on the back side
[1:44:05] of the
[1:44:06] mountains, not wanting it, and there God
[1:44:10] searching, knocking at his door,
[1:44:14] wanting to enter in with him. He's
[1:44:17] knocking church on your door.
[1:44:19] He's knocking for you to let him in.
[1:44:22] Amen. He wants to come in and suck with
[1:44:24] you. Amen. He wants you to have
[1:44:27] fellowship. Complete communion with the
[1:44:31] master.
[1:44:33] Communing with the master is all I want
[1:44:37] to do.
[1:44:39] It's all that I'm built for. There's
[1:44:42] things in this world that I enjoy doing,
[1:44:45] but there's only one thing that I was
[1:44:48] built for.
[1:44:50] That's what we were built for. Amen.
[1:44:52] It's communing with him. Let's stand.
[1:44:56] Musicians
[1:45:12] come Luke 24. He says in 13, maybe you
[1:45:17] can put it up there for me.
[1:45:21] Behold, two of them went that same day
[1:45:24] in a village called
[1:45:26] Emmas, which was from Jer Jerusalem
[1:45:29] three score four
[1:45:32] longs. Next,
[1:45:35] please. And they talked together on the
[1:45:37] things that had happened. See, they was
[1:45:40] walking along the way talking about what
[1:45:43] all had happened. And then he met him.
[1:45:46] Amen.
[1:45:48] He met them and their hearts started to
[1:45:52] burn within because he began to talk
[1:45:54] along the way about opening the
[1:45:58] scriptures of Moses of the
[1:46:01] prophets. But they didn't realize it
[1:46:05] until they asked him to stay a little
[1:46:07] longer. Yes. And when he started
[1:46:09] breaking bread, they recognized him and
[1:46:13] he said that was him.
[1:46:16] That was him that walked with us along
[1:46:18] the way.
[1:46:20] That was him that broke bread the same
[1:46:22] way that he would break it there at the
[1:46:27] Passover. Church, maybe your heart has
[1:46:30] been burning this evening. Maybe there's
[1:46:32] something in your
[1:46:33] life that says, "I've communed with him.
[1:46:37] I want to know him more."
[1:46:40] Can you say that this evening? Lord, I
[1:46:42] want to know you more than I ever have
[1:46:45] before.
[1:46:47] Let's sing that song. The more I seek
[1:46:48] you, the more I find you.
[1:46:55] The more I seek
[1:47:02] you, the more I find you.
[1:47:13] And the more I find in
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:23] you, the more I love you.
[1:47:32] Oh
[1:47:36] s drink from the
[1:47:39] cup for
[1:47:44] me you
[1:47:47] bring feel your heart
[1:47:54] be this love is
[1:47:59] so it's more and I can
[1:48:05] stand. I'm
[1:48:07] helping your
[1:48:09] peace. It's overwhelming.
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:18] For I seek
[1:48:28] you, the more I find
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:39] you, the more I find you.
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:51] The more I love
[1:48:58] you, I want to sit at your
[1:49:03] feet. Drink from the cup before.
[1:49:10] lay back against you
[1:49:15] and feel your
[1:49:18] [Music]
[1:49:21] heartbeat. This love is so
[1:49:27] deep. It's more than I can
[1:49:33] stand.
[1:49:35] I'm your peace.
[1:49:38] So
[1:49:40] overwhelm
[1:49:45] me over I seek
[1:49:56] you, the more I find you.
[1:50:02] [Music]
[1:50:08] The more I find
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:18] you, the more I love
[1:50:27] you. I want to sit at your feet.
[1:50:33] Dream from the
[1:50:38] cupboard. Lay back against
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] you. Feel your
[1:50:51] heartbeat. His love is so
[1:50:57] deep. More than I can say.
[1:51:03] I'm in your peace.
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:11] As they play that softly this evening,
[1:51:13] let's just bow our heads. Our dear most
[1:51:16] heavenly father,
[1:51:18] Lord, Lord, we thank you for coming and
[1:51:21] just communing with us this evening.
[1:51:24] Lord, that drawing, that longing in our
[1:51:27] hearts, Lord, we want to be with you,
[1:51:29] God. Lord, we love you. We love your
[1:51:32] presence, Lord. Lord, we ask you, God,
[1:51:35] that you'll just minister to our hearts
[1:51:37] this evening. Many needs in the
[1:51:39] building. Many needs along the the way
[1:51:42] of the web that's tuned in. God, I ask
