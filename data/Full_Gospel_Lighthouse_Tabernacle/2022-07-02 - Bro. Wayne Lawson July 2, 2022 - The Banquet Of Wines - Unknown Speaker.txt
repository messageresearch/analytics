amen so we want to thank you for your help up there and on the ear just a little bit more and then let me control it and take it up where it's too much and then i'll control it from here amen and so we want to take it to the book of isaiah tonight i have some few things here we'd like to just speak to you on from the book of isaiah the 25th chapter and we've been praying over this for the last few days the lord had taken me into some of this back home and and i've touched it but i haven't been able to speak much on it it's just something that i'm breaking into and i pray tonight that you give me grace i won't have time to read all the quotes that i have concerning it but i'll just go ahead and say it if you need a quote i'll send it to you because we'll have them here um but uh brother ron said brother wayne just preach so the people know you just preach i said that's just what i'll do then if it's okay amen in the book of isaiah the 25th chapter amen just before we read we're going to ask the lord to help us here tonight in the reading of his word faithful lord we thank you tonight for your mercy we thank you for your anointing here upon this meeting lord the special songs that have been sung the blessing lord that has been given already in your anointing and your worship and lord jesus we're just asking you now as we turn to your word lord that your mercy would come and settle over us now father we have been taught that man can open the pages of the bible but it cannot open the meaning of the word it will take you lord and so we ask you tonight that you would just come and that you would settle and visit with us tonight over these scriptures lord may you bless this congregation that's gathered for them that'll be lord may be viewing this by the way of streaming tonight i pray you would help them and bless them and father may you give us instruction and and take us down the paths of righteousness for thy name sake o lord now father we we offer ourselves our mind our heart and lord we're admittedly but right before this congregation before anyone that would hear this that we have no abilities whatsoever that we could help man or that we would know something but lord that if you would just come by and give us grace tonight we would give you all the honor and the glory lord and we give you all the praise we thank you for tonight now in jesus name we pray amen and amen and god bless you if you have your bible isaiah 25 i want to look here in the sixth verse isaiah 25 and verse 6 and in the mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the leaves of fat things full of moral of wines on the leaves well refined and he will destroy him this mountain the face of the covering cast over all the people and the veil that is spread over all the nations he shall swallow up death in victory and the lord god shall wipe away all the tears from off the earth and rebuke of the people shall be take away from off of all the earth for the lord hath spoken it we ask the lord to bless his word tonight if you could be seated i want to speak to you just a little bit tonight if i would take a title i'd like to speak to you a bit on the banquet of wines on the banquet of wine and uh it's such a it's such a a a scripture uh for me personally because i know that the scripture is dealing with the end time and it's dealing with the time of the changing of the body of the church so we're we're certainly uh thankful that the lord would put something in the scripture for us now last night i was sitting praying about the meeting today and as i was praying i went into the book of jeremiah and i was just just meditating over the scripture and and the lord gave me this and i want to just read it from jeremiah the first chapter in the first fourth verse it says for when the lord of the lord word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in thy belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out thy womb i sanctified thee and he says and i ordained thee to be a prophet unto the nations then said i o lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child and the lord said unto me say not that i am a child for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thou shall speak be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord and then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth behold i have put my words in thy mouth i think it's a powerful thing tonight to see that god ordains before the foundation of the world the scripture says here that he actually ordained jeremiah even before he was in his mother's womb god ordained him and ordained and the prophet teaches us before the foundation of the world that god ordained him that he would put his words in his mouth now i know you're not jeremiah tonight but do you know that god has also ordained this bride from before the foundations of the world that he might put his word in your mouth can you imagine that you are a predestinated vessel you are ordained of god that he might touch your mouth into this age and place his word in you now in saying that of course apostle paul helps us to understand this in the book of corinthians paul will say to us he said now god what came the word of god out of you he said from you or it came unto you only now if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge the things which i write unto you are the commandments of the lord now watch what he's saying to you if you are spiritual the word either came to you or out of you now of course word prophets are born and the word comes from them as a vindication they're a vindicated vessel amen but the church of the living god the bride of christ is a prophetic people and a prophetic people being that that she is able to receive the word of prophecy and it literally is taken into her mouth and then used as the glory of god so they're ordained vessels to not only not not that they're trying to come up with their own revelation but they're ordained to receive the word and then they become the word and the word is in their mouth now i'm going to read this directly from the scripture in revelations 10 john said in the eighth verse the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me this little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey now watch the prophecy if you take this book you eat this book watch it it shall be in thy mouth have you ever heard brother branham preach a sermon called the uncertain sound and he said if the if the trumpet would sound uncertain who could prepare for the battle is that right and the prophet uses this and then he goes into the scripture and he said there's so many things that are uncertain but there are things that are certain and then he says see if you repent you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover so brother man then goes into the shelbys of the scripture things that are positive or are certain and here the scripture is saying john if you take this book this little open book if you take this book and you eat this book he said the word shall be in thy mouth now i'm not interested tonight in how it was tasting or what it done to his belly but the beauty of it is the word was in his mouth now it wasn't just any word but it was the word of the season of the redemption of everything that had been lost this book that john is being invited to eat of course this is the book that was closed over in revelations the fifth chapter and john is not able even to look on that book but now he's been invited to take that book and eat that book and literally the word of god will be in his mouth the word of all the ages the word of prophecy and of truth now what was the difference is that the lamb had taken that book and the seventh angel had sounded on the earth so the word had come unto john through a prophet through a prophetic ministry and john was able to to receive it and the word shall be in thy mouth i think it's powerful if you eat this book then the word's going to be in your mouth of course amen looking at the book of revelations it is actually a book of symbols and and i don't have time to go through all the symbols and there's a lot of them amen but if you go through the symbols then you start seeing that the symbology of the scripture matters in other words if it says here that there was a white horse writer or a black horse writer there's a reality to that amen it's only a symbol that means something and when john was asked to take a book and eat it it's symbology that john is being invited to receive a revelation that's being released at that time because see we didn't need a new bible did we we needed a revelation and that's the reason the seventh angel had to be a prophet because the book was the word of god that would be restored to this age in revelation it wasn't that we didn't have the bible we had the bible but we needed a revelation of the bible we needed somebody to open up this book and to make this book live in the season that we're living in and john was being invited that he would eat that book of course it's prophesying of the bride church now i know a lot of people stop at the seventh angel they read revelations 10 and that's all in the seventh verse and that's all it means to them amen but listen amen that's only where it began that's only how it began and we know right now today the seventh verse of revelations 10 is a history lesson to the church of the living god but that eighth verse through that eleventh verse is where the ministry of the bride began under the commission just as jesus commissioned his disciples this ministry of the seventh angel has commissioned an end time ministry to preach the greatest revelations that's ever been given on the face of the earth we are not looking for something to say we have been given something to say we have been given the word of the lord that is the prophecy for the changing of your body it's for the healing of the soul it's for the restitution of your hearts it should bring joy and peace and comfort and life it is a life-changing message that we have been given we have not just been given a little message or a little inspiration or just a little sermony we have been given the entire book released in a revelation that will change your entire life but because you were ordained from the foundation of the world you have been given the ability to eat the book and to receive the revelation that other people are not going to receive they're not going to believe it but something about you that you're able to receive of the grace of god in this age i'll tell you what it is amen you should take that book you should eat that book and the word will be in thy mouth and it will be sweet as honey if the word is in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey i know i'm overdriving it but go ahead and give it to me i'll do it amen do you see what it is as sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and it ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me that i must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings now of course if any man think himself to be a spiritual prophet let him acknowledge let me acknowledge the things which i write unto you are the commandments of the lord now brother brahman said here's the proof of the indwelling of the spirit it was to acknowledge and follow what god's prophet had gave for the age as he said in the order paul had to say this as he claimed another paul had to say to those who claimed another revelation came the word of god out of you or came it unto you only then the evidence of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth word but to receive the truth word and to obey it now here's the evidence of that spirit is to receive that now in revelations 22 17 it is written that the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church the spirit gives the word and if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as true christians took the word for their age isn't that powerful they meant that you are anointed by the spirit to receive the word not that you're producing the word you're receiving the word amen now watch in the book of exodus remember at the time of deliverance when moses went into the presence of god and he was told he was going to be the deliverer of the entire children of israel and remember he had an argument with god i can't do it because i don't speak well he actually told him he actually told the lord i can't do it i don't speak well i my speech i just had some trouble i'm not able to do it and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said it's not aaron levi thy brother and i know that he can speak well behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth now look at the beauty of this and i will be with thy mouth as with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do god just told him moses and i know you don't speak well aaron speaks well but you put the words in his mouth and when he speaks the words you have spoken i will be with his mouth the same as i am with yours can you imagine that whenever that god was laying out a principle that there would be a church a bride come in the last days that would take this very principle when god said unto moses i will make you a god unto the people and i will make aaron a prophet unto you they meant to find that this bride would be a prophetic people amen that god would entire the entire congregation not just the preachers not just the ministries but the entire bride of christ will be the anointed bright body of jesus christ who is anointed by the word that was turned down in the garden of eden but is returned unto this age and the bride is receiving that word and she is eating that word and she is speaking that word what is it amen it shall be in thy mouth amen and i will be with your mouth same as i am with his mouth now look at the power of that if god's going to ask you to do something he's got to provide the need if god's going to say to you you're going to do a certain thing then he's got to provide whatever it is to do what he said you're going to do he said i you'll lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover he's got to give you the spirit to be able to recover them if you're going to do it god's got to provide the need to do so with his grace now watch because the scripture is predicting that in the end time there will be a restitution of all things in acts the third chapter the bible said repent you therefore be converted to your sins that we blotted out for when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord he shall send jesus christ which was preached unto you whom heaven must receive until the times of the restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of all of his holy prophets since the world began for moses truly said unto our fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise unto you of your brethren like and unto me him shall ye hear in all things and whatsoever he shall say unto you amen it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear the prophet shall be destroyed from among the people and it shall come to pass amen that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken likewise have foretold these days look at the beauty of how that paul here in the book of acts is putting out the idea that that literally was coming a refreshing in the last days at the time of restitution now y'all know what refreshing is refreshing is a revealing of the holy ghost it's a refreshment that would be coming from the presence of almighty god in other words there is a there's a refreshment that will come into the church that you're not going to get it from drinking beer or whiskey or not just a little wine now and again this is not the refreshment the bible's talking about the bible is talking about the refreshment of the book of isaiah that said when stammering lives in other tongues well i speak there unto my people and this is the rest wherein i cause the weary to rest this is the refreshing from god this is the refreshing he's talking about it's when the holy ghost is released among the people to fulfill the word of god it'll become a refreshing under that church it will refresh their hearts it'll refresh their lives do you see the presence of god will do something for you that nothing else is going to do the presence of god will change you in a way nothing else can change you you cannot counsel it you cannot teach it you cannot you cannot shake hands enough i cannot counsel you enough but if a man ever one time comes into the presence of god it'll change everything it'll change your life it'll change your attitude it'll change your ability you may be down to nothing but get in the presence of god and he'll refresh you amen oh come on we might as well preach here tonight this is an eagle age isn't it isn't it an eagle age aren't you eagles and the prophet said he called you an eagle for a reason he said because it's the only bird that can be all the way down and be brought all the way back again an eagle can be renewed faith that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength well i'll tell you this we have waited on the lord and we have come into the time of the refreshment of the holy ghost that's come upon the church it's in a season of refreshment in a season of refreshing that has come upon us you say well hey man what are you what are you really speaking of let's just talk about it a minute he meant in the presence of god unrecognized how many knows brother branham told us how to recognize the presence of god he told us here in topeka in 1964 in the message in the message the presence of god unrecognized isn't that something that god could be present and not be recognized he said if we could only do that tonight if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how to recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest not the promised word for moses's age or any other age the promised word for this age so the promised word for this age revelations 10 luke 17 malachi 4 joel chapter 2 these scriptures when you see them fulfilled they are announcing the presence of almighty god only god can fulfill his word only god can make a virgin conceive only god can make the bible live that it takes god to do it so when you see the scriptures come alive it's god himself that is making them live it's god that makes the scripture live and when you see that living it's god's presence among them now i know amen the word for the age we're living in and a command that god has put upon us now i don't know what your situation is here tonight some of you i haven't seen you in a while some of you i don't know but i i can i just preach to you now can i'm not going to talk about our problem i'm going to talk about our answer amen it no matter what the problem here's the answer amen the prophet of god said my ministry was different than other ministries he said my ministry is from different from a pastor or a teacher and if i say things wrong brother and forgive me i don't mean to do it but this is my ministry to declare him that he is here oh glory to god i tell you what you ought to do right now you are to tell every devil that's told you that god has left you and that he's not with you and that god's not in the midst of the church and he's not showing up in our meetings you are to tell that devil tonight you're a lying devil a vindicated word prophet said his only ministry was to declare him that he is here i don't care what you see he's here i don't care what you feel he's here i don't care what you think he is here right now jesus christ is alive i propose to you that jesus is not dead i say he rose up from the grave and he's living and he's alive and not only is he there he's right here in this building right now in another dimension pressing into this dimension by the power of god if you don't know he's here you are to shake loose from that numbing spirit that the devil has placed on you to unbelieve god and say i will not believe my eyes i might not see him but my faith declares he's here he's here in this building he's here to change my life he's here to bring grace into my heart [Applause] i believe he's here [Applause] you ain't going to convince me otherwise i've got a word prophet saying he's here that he's here you can declare it brother you can climb to the highest mountain you can go to the biggest churches you can walk in the middle of a bunch of formal intellectuals amen and you can declare to them christ is here amen wherever two or three are gathered in my name there shall i be in the midst of them yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you until the end of the age and y'all got to forgive me but i think we ought to do it i think we are to climb to the highest mountain and take a bail and go to ringing it and make a declaration of the presence of god and to declare that you might have to sell something you might have to forsake something you might have to walk away from a tradition or a creed or an idea but whatever it costs you've got to say it from your heart he is here he's hearing this meeting tonight now i'm going to a realm that's greater than your feelings because sometimes you don't maybe feel maybe you don't feel like he's here what does that mean then i just quit because i don't feel that he's here no amen there are times that my body don't feel like it there's times my mind don't feel like it at times there's low spots in my in my spirit where it don't feel like it but in the inner man there is a soul down in there and there's a believer in there and that believer hears the word and when the word says he's here the mouth of a believer must confess what the word now the prophet of god said this in the presence of god unrecognized the greatest pleasure i know of is to be pray until i can realize i'm in the presence of god and recognize it i think that ought to be the thrill of the church he says it's the presence of the holy spirit seeing that god made the promise standing among us feel his presence see his word and see it's vindicated it ought to give faith in order to make cripples walk blind see deaf here and dumb to speak i tell you this i want some inspiration i desire inspiration you desire inspiration there's been a lot of inspirations we're we're coming late in the game in the message there's been a lot of inspirations there's been thunder inspiration perugia inspiration every kind of inspiration but every one of those inspirations ended up rallying around a man a personality but there is one inspiration that will end up at the feet of jesus and the inspirations the one the prophet introduced to us i've heard but now i see in 1965 he said remember in your heart you're sitting there make a little altar come into my heart now and give me something something i can hold to let me feel the inspiration that you're present let that be the inspiration of the church he's present let that be the inspiration of the ministry he's here he's here he's present right now he's ready to perform you see this is what hell is against now it's okay most anybody will get with us he was here when we're talking about 1906 or 1925. we're talking about 1940s or 1950s or 1960s and they see the the manifestations of a prophet's life and they see the great things that were happening they're all good about that but the the what hell is against is the spiritual revelation that he is here now that's what hell is against is that you can declare he's here now that you can stand against all of hell we're the revelation and say he's here now see he's here with power but many do if they are not knowing the scripture because someone says well that was another day it was for another time see that was for another season and this happened and this didn't happen in this way and and and unknowingly many men take the spirit of the church of christ while trying to preach the message of the hour they literally say that all of the miracles were done to prove the message in the days of a prophet but there would be no reason for that miracle working god to be among us today which is exactly the church of christ the baptist have another theory amen that that god's alive and if you just come shake my hand then you got it already but we've heard those same spirits right in the in the pulpits which should be the message of the hour which where brother branham said the second crucifixion of jesus christ would not be done on a cross it would be done in the pulpit he said where they kill the effect of the word you see we have the word amen and if we would plead the promise the word would be effective unless somebody stands there and says well it's not for this day it can't happen now there's no way for it to take place amen but you will never stop true revelation you will never stop true revelation from coming to the church of the living god once it becomes a part of you you cannot kill it once revelation drops into the soul you can never take revelation out of the soul of a man it's what becomes revelation you see what it is amen according to scripture the great i am was the return of the last day the the very the very elohim was to come into the bride the very one who was called melchizedek literally would take flesh in the last day and use humanity to prove that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you know today we're living here and the prophet would say to us headship is here and our headship is a messiah is it not the messiah of the bride is the anointed word of the age brother braham said what we need today is a message anointed with the messiahship of christ it's what we needed right now in the world falling apart he said watch he said he came to be a national or church political if the messiah he never came to be national or political church if the messiah would come today he would not be a national or church politician he would if we would cry for such a person god would send us deliverance but we've got to receive it the way he sends it they didn't do that they warned it in that way and the church cries today oh father will you please send jesus to us will you please and when the holy spirit begins to move they don't want that will you send jesus but when the holy ghost begins to move they don't want that see because in this age that you're living in this is the age of the holy ghost this is when the holy ghost manifested itself in the church of the living god by divine promise of the word in this age what is it it's the word amen it's god's messiah it's his anointed word to anoint his church and send it back to the word now not some man is the messiah it's the holy spirit is the messiah now i'm reading quotes directly it's the holy spirit is the messiah christ and the holy spirit is the same thing so here it is now working in the flesh getting the bride ready for rapturing grace what is it amen he sends his messiah but there's a lot of people don't want it but the bible said he came unto his own and his own received him not but as to many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of god not that they become sons of god they were having liberty to exercise as sons of god amen if you're a son you always were a son and that's the reason you have received the message of the hour and it brings liberty it brings power it brings reality listen if you're listening to messages that are taking the power out of the church taking the worship out of the church you're listening some intellectual man always talking about what god used to do but we can't do this anymore amen let me tell you you not listen to the message of the hour the message of the hour is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i say the god that i serve is an omnipotent god and he's so powerful that if you can put him anywhere and he still remains to be god you cannot diminish my god by the place you put him in you can put him in weight loss and he's still a mighty god you can put him in andrew he's still a mighty god you can put him in any believer in the spiel and he remains to be the same he is unconquered by tradition he said preacher what are you getting at i thought i think i you know what i'm getting at to them that receive the holy ghost amen have been given power to exercise they've been given power to bring authority of that spirit in the church of the living god i know what it's about i know the day we're living it's it's more popular to talk about what god used to do what god used to do you know what brother brahm called that he called it a painted fire when you're explaining to somebody the god of yesterday you are painting them a fire but brother branham said it never warmed the hands of a cold man and the painted fire of this age will never warn the heart of a believer in this cold air odyssey you've got to bring the same god that was in this bible that was in the days of elijah and he's got to step on the platform again and manifest himself with authority and power let me tell you this what's wrong today is men is scared to take that challenge they're scared to say he's the same because they don't know he's the same they never met him the same but listen let me tell you this i'm not scared of that unbelieving skeptical devil the god that i serve is still a miracle working god he's still the god that can open blind eyes he can raise the dead the cripples can walk because he remains to be god i'm not scared to say that my god can change life that my god can feel with the holy ghost somebody said well i don't know if he could then you've never met my god my god is not dead my god is alive and he's powerful and he's reality i met him i talked to him he talked back to me and every devil in hell lost power the morning i met him well somebody give the lord a shout shout a loud old daughter of zion tell that unbelieving devil got no place in here tonight that devil tried to torment you i hate that lying devil you know what he is andrew he's a tormentor isn't he but he's not only a tormentor he's a liar so he don't care to lie to torment you he will tell you a lie and torment you by the lie he's telling you but i'll tell you this i've got a god that can dissolve every doubt he can straighten up every lie and when the word of god is preached there's a power and an authority to break that spirit away from the church of the living god i'll tell you this god god sent something in this age he sent the word in this age the anointing in this age he sent the he sent the revelation in this age now now when the word is being fulfilled it renews the vision it brings refreshment y'all know y'all ever y'all ever needed that you ever been in a cold spot in your life you've been in a place where you need some refreshing let me tell you there's a place you can drink tonight that'll refresh you it'll bring you what you need do you know that moses was an anointed man he was actually born for purpose moses was was an intellectual man taught by his mother and even knew the children of israel was to get deliverance but now he tried it on his own failed you know what he ended up he ended up 40 years on the backside of the desert he ended up back there and the prophet of god said think of moses how that moses standing there on the mountain side by that burning bush he had lost all hope of freedom in the absence of the presence of god from your consciousness you lose hope of freedom you lose hope of change you lose hope when there is no reality of presence now watch what the prophet says he said he lost all the hopes of freedom didn't seem like freedom for that people he so gallantly stood for one time now moses had killed a man for that freedom and now he was standing there wondering if there was such a man but the problem was that he was absent from the presence of god now that god was there the same as he had always been but moses was not aware he was not aware of what god was going to do brother bam said see i think it's the same today many of us lose sight of our freedom many of us lose the moment you lose sight of the presence of god you have lost sight of your freedom that's why there's many people sitting in churches today bound when men teach the holy spirit for another day if he's here now he's hearing the holy spirit right the corporate body's in heaven if it wasn't we wouldn't be preaching tonight so if he's here he hears the holy spirit when you put the holy spirit out of the church you have removed the presence of god from the church and the people become in bondage look what he says here the prophet of god and god's arab deliverance he said why brother if we had ever come in the presence of god like moses did it was revolutionary to him and it would revolutionize this for july week and be a good weekend for this wouldn't it and it would revolutionize he said in the light of that angel of god standing there on that mountain that day everything he once had or thought he never would happen come to reality everything he thought well it would never happen we used to think it could but now we don't know if it will he said right there in the presence of that angel of god it become reality it became illuminated i think of men and women today if they would ever step in the light of the holy spirit look at the prophet he steps in the light of the holy spirit under the unction of god's spirit and light of god's word everything god has promised will illuminate to you and be real again my and be real again see what happened to moses now some of you with us in the meeting i'm act like some of you wasn't because this was very important moses was standing there and when he began to receive the instruction from the lord the lord said i have remembered my promise of my children and he said i have promised i will deliver them with a mighty hand god made that promise to them so the word of noah's day would not help the children of god in moses's day building an ark would not help them in egypt wouldn't help them because it wasn't fitting for the need of their age do you see why it's so important to know the message of your season what is the anointing of where you're living what's going on now you've got to know where that anointing is and watch what he's doing he's sitting there talking to angel the lord he said i've come down i have remembered my promise that i made to abraham i shall deliver my people with a mighty hand and remember then the anointing from that burning bush begins to ignite moses faith amen and rehearses to him makes it illuminates makes real that there's a deliverer going and he asks that wonderful question to the lord now who can i say is sent me down here who can i tell the people that has sent me to deliver them he said you tell them the i am sent you not the i was not the i will be you tell them the i am sent you now when you give him the anointed ones of the end time brother madam handles that scripture differently than i ever heard him handle it and he takes the i am and he says watch he says the i am sent me he said the promised word sent him what was sending him was the promise to abraham being fulfilled he was walking because god was keeping his word to abraham what was making him go to egypt was god had promised abraham and now that word was in season and abraham amen not knowing this moses was a part of the promise that abraham had been given of god moses was in the part of the i am he was the manifest he was the fulfillment part of the promise and look what he said the i am sent me are we getting it together the i am sent me the word sent me in other words noah's noah's promise didn't send me it was abraham's promise sent me i've come because god made a promise to abraham seed that's why i'm here so the i am sent me now notice in the hour we're living in the same i am is still alive he's not the i was or the i will be he's still the i am so there is promises of this age that has sent us to this place now i know sometimes we get discouraged as believers i got you but listen i want to talk to you a minute gideon i want you to hear me i want you to hear me thou mighty man of favor i want you to know god has done some things he has changed some things amen and god has sent an angel with you amen did not the lord say to him have not i sympathy have not i said listen brian i want to talk to you have not a sympathy is it not written in the scripture that you would eat this book and you would prophesy in this age is it not written in the bible that i will bring a refreshing in the presence of the lord in a time of the restitution of almighty god amen i know the devil's after you but have not i sent you has not the i am sent you brother if the i am sent you if the i am sent you then the red sea can get in your way if the i am sent you pharaoh will never stop you if the i am sent you there's not enough devils in hell to stop the church of the living god i'll tell you why i'm here the i am sent me malachi the fourth chapter we have stepped out of revelations the 10th chapter has sent us to this age we're not just here trying to do something we're not here trying to be something on our own the i am has sent us not the i was not the i will be oh i tell you brother amen god done so many wonderful things in the days of pentecost he done so many beautiful things in the days of jesus street oh you already been in brother ham's meetings back in the 40s and all the wonderful things that he did he's not the i was he is the i am amen it's time to update your stories it's time to remember that the god of elijah is still the god of jesus christ and he lives in the church of the living god he still opens blinded eyes he still raises the dead he still changes hearts [Applause] don't tell me about a god that used to be if i can't preach he's the same tonight i was over in europe one time i was in heavy prayer because i was with and i love the european people god bless you but they was just a little bit tight on me and bless their hearts amen i i preached a little fast and i i think i was a little too excited sometimes eating that gun powder make you away brother and and i i was a little excited so i went back to my room and i was praying before the lord god you've got to give me something to get the attention these people they think i'm a rudimentary baby in the message you know you got to give me something lord you got to give me something and i just haven't been listening to a tape and all of a sudden on the tape i could hear brother branham he said now listen he said if you're going to be a preacher he said i suggest that you preach jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said now if you're not going to preach that go be a farmer or a lawyer or anything else but don't you be a preacher amen and i'll tell you this if we're going to preach this message we're going to have to preach jesus christ it's the same yesterday today and forever if he come down on the upper room and filled 120 hearts he's still given the holy ghost if god did it for them he can do it for you if he healed he's still healing if he's saved he's still saving now it's not the i was it's the i am now now if you notice this i got one but thank you he said where the carcass is he said there the eagles are gathered together in matthew 24 where the carcass is there the eagles are gathered together now brother branham what does that mean where the carcass is they're the eagles he said well that carcass now he said that's christ that's the word of your season you're feeding on jesus when you're feeding on the word of your season now jesus said how often i would have gathered you ah i how oft i would have gathered you when he's feeding the church the message he's gathering the eagles to the carcass of the word it's there at that carcass the carcass of the i am it is there that they feed for their eternal life it is there that they feed and draw into them life-giving protein life-giving meat life-giving nourishment comes into them it's a feast or could i call it a banquet when the killing of the word in its season what is it it's an invitation for the church to come and dine now you know what's written in revelation the third chapter behold i stand at the door and dock and if any man would open the door i'll come into him and sup with him and he with me so the voice of god's knocking on your heart and brother ram said he's knocking on your heart he wants to get in he said now what's he's going to do he's going to have supper with you that's pretty good the lord's going to have supper with you now what does that mean to the church he said he's going to take the hidden things in the scripture and reveal them unto you he's going to have he's going to have an evening communion with the church now jesus is going to be serving communion in the end time this same principle is preached from the book of genesis when melchizedek meets abraham and remember what he done he produced a wine and a bread at that communion now melchizedek could communion had never been given but now abraham was receiving wine and bread he didn't bring that's that's that's that's pretty powerful stuff he didn't produce it he was receiving it the bread he was receiving had come from heaven it had manifested itself in his presence and abraham was eating bread from heaven now you i don't want to take time in that so let's just move a moment and look in john 6 where jesus said i am the bread of life that comes down out of heaven so now jesus is the bread you eat where the carcass is they're the eagles together what you're feeding on is christ that's why he says over there in revelation come and take the book john and eat the book and the word of the season will be in your mouth john you see what he's doing he's feeding on the secret revealed word of the age he's living in not a new book same book just being revealed he's having communion and receiving of unleavened bread it's one of the most beautiful pictures in the scripture is that john john here is receiving unleavened bread called the book but it's unleavened bread now if you if you if you like to study the message and follow the follow the path of how god descending into into manna for our age you can follow the power and show you the very trail he takes when brother brown preaches a message called paradox how many remembers paradox when brother of them sees the vision of the mamba and he sees the vision of going across the jordan and he said i went over the jordan and he said all the promises were there remember that he said i've seen if i'll catch you up on if you don't remember he said he's seen a vision and he said in this vision he was walking on this trail and he said he was walking and come up and he said i was in two-thirds of the journey was over and it was one-third of the journey left three pulls now he said it was one-third of the journey left and he said on the other side of the jordan was the last part of the journey he said and that's where all those promises were were on the other side of the jordan and then he comes back and teaches joshua parallels ephesians and he shows that his ministry is to lead the bride out of a wilderness journey into a land of promise to cross over he meant the divide and and take us into the promises of god well when he shows this happening he takes this to the scripture he actually goes to the book of corinthians it's powerful and he said purge out there for the old leaven that you may have a new lump and ye are unleavened for christ is our passover and his sacrifice for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with leaven of madison wickedness but with 11 unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so he was showing us that his message was about to produce an unleavened bread he was going to be bringing now this is real important because it would have no humanity in it right 11 is corruption it would have no corruption in it it would not be corrupted by human thinking it would be the same kind of bread that melchizedek would have given abraham back there in that he didn't take it from abraham and eat it he produced it he brought it from heaven the revelation that was being given to the church was coming from the angel of the lord it wasn't coming from the world it wasn't coming from theology it was coming from heaven bringing us an immortal feast where we could eat the bread of immortality now church of the living god i know you know the promise of this age i know that this bride is standing at the very at the very brief of the changing of the body now we could say that we've been saying it but if there ever was a time to say it i believe it's today with putin sitting there with those missiles hanging in the bomb they're hanging they're waiting they are poking the bear right now uh our i i hate to say it but our sleepy-eyed president is so blind he's poking the bear thinking hey man that he ain't going to shoot them missiles and he keeps telling them i'm going to shoot him but there's a word lane over this bride that says before the first one ever hits america we'll be setting in glory you're eating the bread you're eating the bread think of this the last communion that moses gave before they left egypt they ate that bread and they had their staff in their hand and they had their shoes on their feet brother they were ready to go and i'll tell you this we're eating this message and we're ready to go we don't need to get ready we're ready we're ready to go tonight and we're eating the bread of our change [Applause] every promise is here now it's in the scripture it's it's laying there in the scripture where he says that all those promises are in there and he says what it's doing is putting them in joshua how many ever followed the journey of joshua through the wilderness and they eat of the heavenly manna they eat every day of that heavenly manna but when they crossed over into jordan that manna stopped that had been fallen for all of that time and now they were turned to eat from the land they were living in they've been waiting 400 years to get into this land and now that we're going to eat i don't have the ability to tell you they were going to eat from the promises that have been made to abraham thy seed shall sojourn but i will deliver them and bring them into this land and now after 400 years they were putting things in their mouth that had took 400 years for them to taste they were eating things that gave them a reality this is my home this is my property this is my land this doesn't belong to somebody else i have come to this time god has brought me to this day this is my season this is my message this is my hour and when they begin to eat that you know the story joshua got all kinds of aggressive joshua got aggressive he got an attitude and decided he'd tear down every stronghold and all of all of all of palestine he went and started with jericho the very day of the passover y'all know what passover is it's new beginnings and he had a new beginning he had a refreshing from the presence of god while he ate from the land of canaan something struck his heart no devil gonna keep me off of my ground no more no devil gonna keep me out of my promises no more i'm gonna eat a bread that lets me know who i am where i come from where i'm going that this is the present hour and season and i can have this and as he was eating this bread look what he's doing he's taking from the promise am i carrying you are you seeing my point he's eating he's eating from the promise the book has not been promised to be open in any other age they've been waiting for this book to be opened for 6 000 years no man has ate of this book and all of a sudden the revelation that eve turned down in the garden of eden has been brought back to the church of the living god and here's such a simple group of people tonight feeding on the same exact manna the eve would have ate in the garden of eden and she would have manifested jesus christ in the flesh had she continued to eat i'll tell you this while we're eating this bread we're bringing we're bringing from the that's why now watch this that's why that the baptist will tell you a baptist story and they'll talk about future days and the church of christ about other days but when you're listening to a message preacher they're talking about well the brother brahm did this and he opened up this channel and this thing happened this because that's where you are supposed to be feeding you're feeding from that word that is the word of change it's the word for your body change now watch this because as you're eating from it you begin to live from the evidence of your land you know i got on the elevator today with a guy and he had a youtube on he's playing audible audible books i know what they are he was playing audible books i got on and i could hear he's listening to some kind of novel i said audible books or why he said oh yeah he said i traveled for a living he said man i live on these things oh my you're living on that some fantasy some story i'm living on something else i'm living on what god sent to this age to change things and look at this it's the thing that god is giving that we're not feeding on some man we're feeding on the word body now i'm not asking this because i think you're slow i think i'm a bad preacher are we together to this point the i am present truth feeding from that word now paul says this in hebrews 13. he said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever watch this next verse be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein paul's saying it straight ain't he some of y'all eating stuff it ain't profiting you nothing you have been occupied eating things that did not fit into jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever look what his next verse says we have an altar paul said i got an altar whereof they have no right to eat in other words they could not perceive or receive jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever they couldn't they couldn't accept that paul had met him in the light they couldn't swallow it they could not desire the idea that that jesus was alive and it was they couldn't take the idea of it but you see what it is paul is saying that he's the same and we have an altar that they cannot eat of now y'all know that's a good deep subject i don't have time to preach tonight but watch in the book of psalms david will say this for thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with all and my cup runneth over listen god has prepared this table he has set this banqueting table in the presence of your enemy the devil is here in all of his power the devil brother branham announces the god of this age he's announced that hell that lead has been taken off and 200 000 000 demons have rolled in ecclesiastical devils to persecute this bride to push against them and here we're setting tonight eating the food of the manna of almighty god the devil might be sitting right by you but you're feasting on the food of almighty god you're eating word you're eating words that will change your life in the presence of your enemy i will prepare a table for you in the presence of your enemy he actually says to you he actually says this amen that light shines in darkness and darkness don't get it light shine and darkness don't get it what are you talking about brother wade i'll say this to you amen the message reveals christ and the world didn't see it when it happened it revealed christ and they didn't see it when it happened because he's revealing scripture that they look at it's summer's way in the future do you know first thessalonians the fourth chapter is in the middle of being manifested here tonight do you know that the very scripture the lord himself should descend from heaven with a shout and a voice and a trump that child is the message of william branham brother random said the living bread the living bread when you're feeding on the message you are becoming the voice of the resurrection the words that have been given to you are the very words of resurrection power they're the words that could change your bodies first corinthians 15 he said i'll show you a mystery we'll not all sleep but we shall be changed that in a moment of the twinkling of eye the last trump the trumpet shall sound the dead shall be raised in corruption we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality and how you going to do that how are you going to do that how are you going to get in corruption in a corruptable state how are you going to take in something that is incorruptible when you are completely corruptable brother biscuit said something one time i thought was phenomenal he said you're judging a church trying to make up what you think about it but you are in such an unperfect condition how could you ever give a perfect judgment so no matter how how wonderful you think that you could approach the scripture you'll never approach them incorruptibly because you're so corrupted right but look at what he's saying you would take it on the church eats the message of the hour the message of this hour is the rapture the message of this day is the change of your body the promise of this hour the i am of this day is the lord shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice what are you doing here the rapture has sent you here church i i i don't believe this bible is written separate from somebody i believe somebody is first thessalonians 4. i'm not just reading about the rapture i am the rapture i'm not just reading the bible we are the bible we're not just reading the message we are the message you don't think god's going to take home a book do you he's going to take home a bride who has ate the book became the book and he's going to take that book it's a change of the body it's it's what god is giving to change the church now look what he's doing when he begins to bring that bread he's bringing a feast he's inviting you to a feast now you i read it for you first corinthians 15 he actually says this corruptible shall put on an incorruptible and put on immortality and when it happens he says it shall be brought to pass saying death is swaddled up death is swallowed up in victory now watch this in isaiah 25 and 80s that death will be swallowed up in victory your enemy will be eaten by victory faith is your victory here at the time of the destruction of your enemy the bible said god sets up a banquet now can you imagine this that he sets a table with fats and wines and invite you to a banquet of wine the bride of christ the mount zion there is something that he is preparing he's preparing he's preparing a table of wine now what what you're coming to is the refreshment of god what you're eating is a refreshment of god it literally is a wine that is to be given now you're all bible students you're message believers so i'm not going to preach a long sermon here but watch what he's saying in revelation six and six brother branham is distinct in telling you this he says the bible says in the third seal in the middle of the dark ages hurt not the oil and the wine he said now we're going to find the symbol for oil means the holy ghost it's god he said but now that symbol for wine represents revelation now watch the the banquet he's inviting you to is a banquet of revelation he's showing you that what's going to overcome your enemy is revelation the church that takes the revelation of the age will be overcomers in that age if you receive the revelation you receive strength to overcome can i can i just give you the scripture when the enemy comes like a flood god will raise a standard against that enemy come on y'all know the scripture and there was a line and there was a man and there was an ox and there's an eagle and the prophet said the eagle was the one that would defeat in the last days and what is it eagle is a word prophet giving revelation to the church so the banquet of the bride is a banquet of revelation that has been given to the church i'll tell you what he's told you he says to you if you'll just come here and take this while you're drinking this wine while you're receiving of this revelation this is where your enemies are conquered in revelation is where your enemy is conquered if you have doubts about the message if you get a revelation of the word it will kill the doubt that is doubting the word the way you combat the way you combat a doubting spirit is revelation the way you combat a lion spirit is revelation the way you combat a devil is by revelation the gates of hell will never prevail against revelation when this bride recognizes who she is then the rapture's going to go the rapture is a revelation oh glory to god it's when the church begins to drink of the wine of the revelation of almighty god who's set out there at a table i i tell you it's it's an amazing study it's an amazing study to see that this is exactly what happens when this is exactly what happens when esther wants to get rid of her enemy you remember what it was when esther wanted to get rid of her enemy what she done is she got into a position that she was a queen but it was a secret that she was the seed of abraham she was a queen but it was a secret of who she really was y'all remember that she got in under cover then the seventh seal had never been opened yet but she was in position as queen without anybody knowing who really she was and haman decided i'll kill all them jews but he didn't realize that the very jew seed he was trying to kill was now the queen of the country he was living in he didn't know that god had elevated the seed and hid it in the palace and she was setting in royalty while the enemy was trying to kill her thinking she was just another no-good-for-nothing jew but she was the seed of abraham you know what she did hey man she outsmarted that devil because mordecai sent word to her that she needed to do something and you remember she didn't want to at first remember she said no i don't think this is going to work i don't think this is going to work and this is where the revelation came to me you got to get up before you can get down you've got to get up sometimes before you can get down to business with god you got to get up and start believing esther could not believe she could conquer her enemy but mordecai convinced her that she needed to do something so when she got lifted up high enough she got down to business with god and began a three-day fashion remember that and on the third day she went in i ain't trying to preach it i just want you to pick up the thought on the third day she went in and when she did she was offered a golden scepter come on now take the authority it's going to be offered to you and it happens in the third day does that mean anything to y'all in the third day you're gonna get this golden scepter and it'll give you authority of half of this kingdom and she could have asked for anything she wanted she could have in this day she could have a joint airship with him and ask for anything she wanted you know what she wanted she wanted rid of that enemy and how could she get rid of that enemy she made a banquet of wine and she invited her enemy with her husband king at the same time and under that banquet of wine there came out a revelation that somebody was trying to kill her and it was this very haman that was there and that she was the seed of abraham and the king seeing this oh god he literally had haman had had a had a hood put over his head and drug him out because he was trying to abuse the queen in the presence of his own cousin or her own king and to think here we are tonight that this devil has to come right here in the house of god and he's approached with us in this banquet of wine but let me tell that devil something the seventh seal's already revealed it we are the seed of abraham we are the royal queen seed of almighty god and as the revelation begins to unfold amen that devil's already whipped tonight whether he knows it or not god has given grace to this bride to overcome that devil it's a banquet of wine that you're drinking the wine and the stimulation of the rabbit do you see that as you good in revelation it's going to grow now in it and when you start looking into this i've got just a couple minutes and i'll close when when you start getting into this and you go and look at jesus this is beautiful because this is the very first miracle he ever performs the very first miracle he ever performs is in john the second chapter now if you read it uh if you read it there with me it's a powerful reading i don't have time to go through all of it but i want to read it with you just a little bit but pull up john the second chapter and when's the last time you read this portion it's it's a powerful read the bible said that the third day there was a marriage in canaan galilee the mother of jesus was there now did that say the third day it said the third day do you know the third day y'all know how important that day is it's actually a tuesday right the third day's a tuesday but jews got married on the third day because in the beginning when god created the heavens and earth it was twice he said it's good on the third day it's good it's good so they said it's a good day and they got married on the third day which were tuesdays but in matthew the 24th chapter it was on a tuesday in the evening time when jesus answered three questions that had been asked to him about the sign of the times amen when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming it was in the evening of the third day when he answered all of the questions when the six seals were put in matthew 24 was in the evening of the third day do you see us the same in this last day brother branham said the third day remember jesus rose on the third day and in the morning of the third day they had some rumors he was alive but in the evening of the third day they saw him break bread and knew it was him he broke bread in the evening of the third day and under a banquet in a little room he revealed that this is the same jesus he is resurrected from the grave i tell you god has given us a little room experience today he took us in in the evening of the third day and broke the bread and we have seen jesus the same thing it's in the third day he comes to this wedding it's a beautiful thing that happens in canaan galilee the mother of jesus is there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus said unto him they have no wine brother oh marriage without wine a marriage in the evening of the third day without wine now you can listen to a different translation that's pretty powerful when you read the king james version the new king james version they said it in a way it helps you catch it just a little better it said and when they ran out of wine you mean they started with some wine but when they ran out when they ran out of wine i tell you friends when they ran out jesus was there they ran out of wine but when they ran out so happened it happened at the same time jesus had entered the marriage when they ran out of wine you said preacher what are you talking about can i can i just tell you this there are a lot of times in scripture people ran out but when they ran out he was there let me ask you about this about about that with a zero path when she ran out of bread what about she had bread but she had run out of bread and when she ran out and elisha was there and said if you'll make some bread for me you won't never run out no more because when you run out is when god gets busy restoring what you have lost this is the age of restitution when the world run out of revelation here is jesus giving revelation not just any revelation the revelation of the body change the revelation of the rapture the revelation of the church what is it when they ran out what about it when they run out my goodness we could stay here a little while what about it what about when they run out what about when the woman ran out of money and her children were going to be sold into slavery and they said oh we got's a little oil he said that's all you needs a little cause when you're just about ouch it's when god can cause miracles to happen amen it's when god can do great things with little things brother he said go borrow some go borrow you some vessels and they went and borrowed vessels amen and you know what they did they found out that god could fill every vessel they could bring they were out but god was an ouch god this never run out of anything brother god has not run out of power god has not run out of ability god has not run out of healings i was sitting there thinking about i thought them poor and poor fellas amen amen amen when them and chill when them hebrew children were sitting there they ran out but he met them there daniel ran out but he met him there i'm sitting here thinking about people that ran out i thought my goodness what about moses he ran out of a place to go when he ran out of a place to go god made him a place to go sometimes you just run out you run out of courage you run out of strength you run out of you run out of shout you run out of joy you run out of your experience with god but when you get ready to run out just let me tell you you are in the evening of the third day and there's a feast of wine where god is refilling the barrel every morning when you run out there's a god to refill it i should have started right here when you run out when you run out come on moses run out of a place to go and god opened the place do you know why do you know why moses run into that red sea do you know why he ran into it i tell you what brother branham said he said he ran into the red sea he said god put mountains on one side and the other put a sea in front of him put an army behind him so he would have no place to go he said because god wanted to show us that when there is no way he will make a way when there is no way he will make a way let me prophesy to you full gospel amen when you're out he's still got something for you when you're running low he can still fill you up when there is no way he still makes the way i know i might sound like a wild man but i've been drinking some wine of revelation that tells me he can bring revelation every hour of every day of your life this is the grace of god brother when you're out what about joshua he run out of light what about him he run out of light he's fighting a battle and there's no light to fight and he's officially had to fight them devils in darkness but god when he run out told him you just speak the word and when he spoke the word of god he said there'll be some light son you stand still moon you stand still and he fought the battle brother let me ask you something when did joshua pray about that brother branham said joshua never even prayed through about it he said god had already prayed him through before the foundation of the world and he was standing there in the line of duty and god gave him what he needed in that hour i'll tell you this you may be out tonight but god get a word in your mouth and if you will let your mouth open up god will prophesy and make a way where there is no way you run out you ever run out come on rafa run out of time martha run out of time four days four days lasers had laid in that grave she was out of time it was over corruption already set in the body but while she was seeing him laying there and all out of time the bible said jesus came and she went out to meet him and said lord if you would have been here i wouldn't have run out he said martha even now i am the resurrection and the life and though he were dead yet shall he live listen church he's still the i am he run out come on jeribus brother brown taught us something about drives he said he ran out of hope everyone i hope you'll run a little hope you're just running out of hope brother brown said he ran i hope he said you know why he said he ran out of hope because they had already embalmed his daughter he said by the time jesus had got to driver's house they had pulled the blood out and had put had put something in her to preserve her he said the same way that that denomination has done you he said they pulled out the life and have and they he said they have they have put that stuff in you to preserve you and keep you dead but when jesus came he said clear the room of all the unbelievers clear the room of all the make-believers you're about to see a resurrection because when you run out of hope jesus is still the great i am when you run out when you run out they were out but jesus was there you know what he says he said under her woman what have i to do with thee mine hours not yet come and his mother said unto his servants whatsoever he saith unto you just do it she never even discussed whether or not he was going to he said now when he tells you to do something just go ahead and do it because we're about to have wine whatever he tells you can you imagine when they looked over there the scripture says there were six water pots of stone and they had three ferkins a piece now that means about 20 or 30 gallon containers were sitting there and jesus commanded them that they would fill those water pots so there's about a hundred and eighty gallons of water and me and me and isaac was reading this just before church i tell you what about about sent me into overdrive the bible said and he said unto them draw out now and bear it unto the governor of the feast and they bear it and when the ruler of the feast had tasted means experienced when he had tasted the water that was made wine he knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew i don't know how it happened but somewhere from the time that that boy filled that cup up with water when he filled the water it was water and somewhere before he could give that water to the governor it had already turned wine now let me see acts the second chapter and yeah acts 3 20 and 219. yeah malachi 4 yeah joel chapter 2. they knew not that it was just water but the servant that drew it knew it was water but it's been turned into wine it was just scripture friends it was just the water of the word it was just scripture but the master said why why is it that you have saved this last wine why is it the best most people wait serve the good wine in the front get everybody drunk and then they then they serve the bad wine but not jesus he saves the best wine he saves that stimulating wine for the last days it's then that he will take and reveal that when jesus turned water into wine he was showing that one day i'm going to change your body and i'm going to bypass your parents to do it i'm not going to bring you through the process i'm just going to speak and you're going to be changed listen tonight friends i believe that we're drinking some good wine at the banquets of wine do you stand your feet with us tonight at the banquets of wine sometimes sometimes you have a real enemy you say how do i destroy this enemy invite him to the banquet me and brother me and brother timothy pruitt was down there working on this on his church back several years back and summertime we walked up through there doing something looked over there's a big rattlesnake laying there on the sidewalk i don't know if me and timothy one killed him we killed the snake either way i looked over the snake and i said you come here to die sometimes your enemy would like to keep you out of the house of god not keep you away from this banquet but if you just invite him this is where he's destroyed this is where he's this is where he's done away with and when the revelation begins to come this is the this is the thing that the message is producing is a refreshing a renewal he is the same yesterday today and forever if you're sitting here tonight you say by the way [Music] i'm just at a place in my life where i just need my joy back when you're at a banquet and all you need to do is begin to drink if you start drinking this wine i'm talking about after a while it starts stimulating you start moving i don't think i'm the only one preaches on why jesus preached him and he said you can't take this new wine and put it in an old bottle [Music] brother brown said the revelation behind it is he said the new wine has a little life in it and it's still got some movement so that's why you got to have some oil is you got to oil these old human bodies you got to oil that skin down that when you put the wine in it there's some flexibility in it there's some movement hey longer we're around the church if we're not careful to stiffer we get but we need to take some oil and wipe all over us make us flexible again make us move again you know what brother brown said he said it'll give the wine room [Music] when's the last time you give the wine some room when's the last time you made a little room for the wine make it where it can move in you just a little bit you had to tell your neighbor screwed over a little neighbor screwed over a little i'm about to i'm about to shout right here in this meeting tonight said preacher you wouldn't do that absolutely i would i said make a little room for the wine there's something moving on the inside of my heart i want to feel the grace of god i i don't want no dry religion i want stiff religion i don't want no tied down intellectual concept of what the word of god is we want something that lives something that moves our hearts something that changes our lives so probably not i got this enemy that's it's just plaguing me everywhere bringing to the banquet tonight turn the wine bottle up begin to drink the revelation that tells you i come from god i'm going back to god i'm ordained before the foundation of the world the word has come to me and the bride of christ i'm the seed of abraham nothing can destroy me there's no way the devil can overcome me i tell you stop drinking on that a while start drinking on that a while have you ever just wanted to rejoice i've seen people i've seen people that want to want a blessing from god they want a blessing they don't know how to get it let me tell you how to get a blessing you don't beat it out of the chair don't beat it out of the floor if you want a blessing from god you take his word that he's fulfilled you put it in your vision and you begin to thank him for it and you begin to worship him for it amen if you had to reach back now and say god you created the heavens and the earth you're the god that spun the stars you're the god that gave me life you're the god that called me to preach you're the god that saved my soul you're the god that healed my body you're the god that gave me this baby evelyn you're the god they've been that that took that spirit of depression off of my baby you're the god that changes and all of a sudden there's something starts moving in the church it's called wine the stimulation of revelation begins to move and the holy ghost begins to change listen he will never turn down your praise he will never turn down your praise i don't care who you are or where you're from if you want to worship god he will take what you give him he will take what you give him and he is worthy of all of the praise a man can ever give him and sometimes we are to just lift up our hands and begin to say god i thank you for the message of the hour i thank you for the revelation of this age that you have sent into our lives father i'm so thankful for it lord i'm so thankful for it father let's just bow our hearts together here tonight almighty god we thank you tonight for your grace and your mercy lord we pray that something has been spoken here tonight
