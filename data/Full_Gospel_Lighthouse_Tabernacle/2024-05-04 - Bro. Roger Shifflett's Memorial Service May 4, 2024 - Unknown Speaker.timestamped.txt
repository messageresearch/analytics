[17:45] that was done towards the family during

[17:51] Roger a scripture that comes to mind of
[17:53] our our brother Roger is is first
[17:56] Thessalonians 4 And1
[17:59] and it
[18:00] says and that you study to be quiet and
[18:04] to do your own business and to work with
[18:06] your own hands as we commended you and
[18:10] in another translation it would
[18:12] say aspire to lead a calm and peaceful
[18:15] life as you mine your own business and
[18:18] earn a
[18:20] living I find this uh scripture that
[18:23] would uh be a life that brother Roger
[18:26] would
[18:27] live a man that would mind his own
[18:30] business and worked a calm and Peaceable
[18:33] life with his family and and so we

[24:10] brother Roger and everything he stood
[24:12] for his glorious message that he
[24:15] believed with all of his
[24:16] heart we know that this isn't the
[24:20] end we know this is just a temporary
[24:22] goodbye but Jesus Promised if you
[24:25] believe on him you would have eternal
[24:27] life and we look around nature and all
[24:29] of Nature and all of creation tells us
[24:32] that there's coming a
[24:33] resurrection and we believe it with all
[24:35] of our hearts because he raised brother
[24:38] Roger will also raise you know an
[24:41] important thing in life is just not what
[24:43] we accomplish or what we do the
[24:45] important thing is in life is to know
[24:47] him and the power of his resurrection
[24:51] it's not just about knowing facts is not
[24:53] just about knowing a Doctrine Jesus
[24:55] Christ is life that's right and heaven
[24:58] and all these things that we're so
[25:00] looking forward to is more than a
[25:01] geographical Place Heaven is a
[25:04] person love is a person it's not an idea
[25:09] it's not just a state of mind it is the
[25:11] person of the Lord Jesus Christ and if
[25:13] you don't know him in the power of his
[25:16] resurrection I just want to encourage
[25:18] you this afternoon to know him because
[25:22] to know him is life and God is so simple
[25:26] he came and he gave his life
[25:29] so that if we believe on him that's all
[25:30] that's all he asked us to do is to
[25:32] believe on him brother Roger believed on
[25:35] him and he's promised the resurrection

[33:11] good afternoon we we welcome you here to
[33:13] Full Gospel Lighthouse and I want to
[33:15] thank each and every one of you for
[33:17] coming here today to be a part of this
[33:20] Celebration Day for our brother Roger
[33:22] shifflet and uh he's certainly certainly
[33:24] loved here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and
[33:27] you think about brother Rogers life and
[33:29] think how we how he come to the message
[33:31] and think about the family that he was
[33:33] in you you really see the the character
[33:36] of a of a person by the person that they
[33:39] marry and you see you see in Sister
[33:41] Vicky's life and you see how that how
[33:44] that God has orchestrated her life so so
[33:47] perfectly and how that he thought so
[33:49] much of brother Roger that he would
[33:51] allow her to be connected with brother
[33:53] Roger and to see the life that they they
[33:56] built here and to live right here in the
[33:58] valley and to be a witness and to be a
[34:00] written epistle read of all men and we
[34:02] certainly uh we love brother Roger with
[34:04] all of our heart and he certainly meant
[34:06] a lot to our our former Pastor brother
[34:08] Homer Frasier and then myself and
[34:10] brother Ron and and uh we just we just
[34:13] think about how powerful that sister
[34:16] Vicky is and in her own walk when you
[34:19] think about brother Roger marrying her
[34:21] and later on in life and sister Vicki
[34:24] now has went through this uh losing of
[34:26] her husband twice
[34:28] and you think about how that how that
[34:31] God has orchestrated all of these things
[34:33] and you just see how that the Lord
[34:35] worked every detail out for sister Vicki
[34:37] and brother Roger their life and what a
[34:39] testimony that it is and you think about
[34:42] sister Vicki's faith and to see and I I
[34:45] know that just take a moment here and
[34:46] speak on sister Vicky but I believe it's
[34:48] exemplary for us to recognize the
[34:52] character uh sister Vicki that brother
[34:54] Roger was married to because it
[34:56] exemplified his as well
[34:58] it showed the character that was on the
[34:59] inside of him when he married sister
[35:01] Vicky and to think how powerful that she
[35:04] is I know that when brother Kenny passed
[35:06] away that that even she was that night
[35:09] she was back there in the house of the
[35:10] Lord after that and I know that she got
[35:12] on her kids just past this past week cuz
[35:15] they left a a tent meeting just to come
[35:16] back to be with her and they wanted she
[35:19] wanted them to be in church but I think
[35:21] it's I think it's very powerful the
[35:24] family that brother Roger was connected
[35:26] to here the shifflet family and The
[35:28] Meadows family and you see what God was
[35:30] doing God was joining two families
[35:32] together and I was just praying about
[35:35] this this week what what could I what
[35:37] could I say that I could offer to the
[35:39] Diaz and the the Huffman family and the
[35:41] shifflet family just just reflecting
[35:43] over brother Rogers life and this
[35:45] scripture just kept coming to me Matthew
[35:49] chapter 10 and verse 29 are not Two
[35:52] Sparrows sold for a far then one of them
[35:55] shall not fall on the ground with
[35:57] without your father but the very hairs
[36:00] of your head are all numbered fear ye
[36:02] not therefore you are more a Val you
[36:06] than many
[36:07] sparrows and Jesus goes on to say
[36:09] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[36:12] before men him will I confess also
[36:14] before my Father which is in heaven but
[36:18] whosoever shall deny me before men him
[36:21] will I also deny before my Father which
[36:23] is in heaven brother Roger definitely
[36:25] lived the life of the first of one that
[36:29] would confess him before men brother
[36:31] Roger was not ashamed of this of this
[36:34] gospel this glorious gospel that came by
[36:36] his way and when you think about when
[36:39] you begin to think about how careful God
[36:41] is in choosing and electing Sons and
[36:43] Daughters of God and you think about the
[36:46] election of God how that he would elect
[36:48] somebody that would stand for him in an
[36:50] hour like we're living in right now and
[36:52] to think that no matter what came no
[36:54] matter what the storms were that rose up
[36:56] against brother Roger was steadfast in
[36:59] his faith and Jesus is Jesus is saying
[37:01] so don't worry don't worry for your
[37:04] father cares deeply about even the
[37:07] smallest detail of your life and I think
[37:10] about just the the moments of life that
[37:13] we are chosen that God has given us to
[37:15] be able to live out and you think about
[37:17] it that God so instrumentally puts
[37:21] things together that God is saying to
[37:23] you that don't worry about the smallest
[37:25] detail of life I've got my eye upon the
[37:28] sparrow you think about that if God's
[37:30] got his eye upon the sparrow the
[37:32] smallest one of the smallest birds that
[37:34] surely God cares about his children
[37:38] surely you would think that God knows
[37:40] every little detail that even when
[37:42] brother Roger was dealing with
[37:43] conditions in his body God knew every
[37:46] little detail of it we think about when
[37:49] God was when he was here on Earth that
[37:51] he cared so much for the people that he
[37:54] came and he healed their sick that he
[37:56] comforted their heart and he told them
[37:58] about a place that he was going to go to
[38:01] prepare for them and that he would come
[38:03] again to them and receive them unto
[38:05] himself he cared so much for them and
[38:07] notice he cared so much until when he
[38:10] knowed he must leave in order to bring
[38:13] this great thing to us he said I not
[38:15] leave you comfortless but I will send
[38:18] the Holy Spirit and he shall continue my
[38:21] care for you until he returns there's
[38:24] nobody that cares like Jesus
[38:28] even when his disciples were up out
[38:30] there on the waters and they were out in
[38:32] the storms of life and they were out
[38:34] there and it looked like Jesus didn't
[38:36] see them God saw them we recognize that
[38:39] if you go to studying the scriptures
[38:41] that Jesus had went up onto a mountain
[38:43] to pray and there we recognize that
[38:45] Jesus was up there and all the time when
[38:48] his children were in the midst of
[38:49] troubles and in the midst of Trials he
[38:52] seen them sister Vicki he saw this day
[38:55] before it ever got here he saw saw the
[38:57] day that brother Roger would die he saw
[39:00] that and G Jesus cared so much that he
[39:03] came down off of the mountain and walked
[39:05] upon the Water he cared so much for them
[39:07] that he calmed the water as he began to
[39:10] walk upon it and he began to talk as he
[39:12] began to speak to them said fear not it
[39:14] is I and in the darkest of hours that's
[39:18] when Jesus shows up that's the kind of
[39:21] God that brother Roger believed in he
[39:23] believed in a kind of a God that would
[39:25] show up in sickness he would show up in
[39:28] troubles he would show up in depression
[39:30] he would show up in the calamities of
[39:32] life and that kind of God cared so much
[39:35] for brother Roger that he wouldn't leave
[39:37] him here in a pest House of of of a body
[39:40] that would begin to be tormented by age
[39:43] and things that kind of God cared so
[39:46] much for brother Roger that just the
[39:48] other day he would come and call his
[39:50] name and the angel of death would sweep
[39:53] into the room and would catch and pick a
[39:56] flower that go could put in his bouquet
[39:59] he cared so much that he came by the way
[40:02] of the shifflet and he called one home
[40:05] it's the same kind of God that cared so
[40:07] much for Lazarus that day when he walked
[40:10] by when he walked by the the by the land
[40:13] that Lazarus was living in and he passed
[40:15] away but Jesus cared so much to be
[40:19] late because he knew that he would show
[40:22] up for his resurrection he cared so much
[40:26] about Lazar Aus that he wept at his
[40:29] funeral he cared so much for Mary and
[40:32] Martha that he looked on them and said I
[40:33] am the resurrection and the life and he
[40:36] that believeth in me though he were dead
[40:38] yet shall he live again he cared so much
[40:41] for Lazarus that he spoke the word
[40:44] Lazarus come forth you see in life he
[40:47] cares for you in death he cares for you
[40:50] in rejoicing he cares for you and in
[40:53] Weeping he cares for you and brother
[40:56] Roger was a Serv V of the most high God
[40:59] that cared about the smallest of details
[41:03] maybe key of C or key of f sister
[41:07] gie
[41:08] he carth for
[41:13] you oh
[41:15] he carth for
[41:20] you oh

[42:56] thank you for being
[42:58] here it just kind of shows what a man
[43:01] that Roger was for all of us to be here
[43:04] today and all of us have been affected
[43:05] by his life and and uh I was his Pastor
[43:10] for right at 25 years and and uh we're
[43:15] talking you know we kind of have a hard
[43:17] time talking about sister Vicky without
[43:19] talking about
[43:21] Kenny and brother Homer thought so much
[43:25] of Kenny uh Kenny was an angel on the
[43:27] earth and and uh we double
[43:33] dated he didn't trust me but he trusted
[43:37] Kenny and so we we spent much time with
[43:41] you guys in your home and then God gave
[43:45] you brother Roger and when the Lord took
[43:48] brother Kenny home he gave you brother
[43:51] Roger I'm sorry that you have to face
[43:54] this again sister Vicky
[43:57] but isn't it wonderful to know the end
[43:59] of the
[44:00] story brother Roger's children and his
[44:05] stepchildren you know his
[44:07] family thank you thank you for being
[44:11] here this is not the
[44:13] end we watched brother rogers's body
[44:16] deteriorate we knew him as a strong
[44:19] strong man we knew him as a great worker
[44:22] and uh having a good
[44:25] business uh my my bedroom is even
[44:28] painted by Brother Roger now and as I
[44:30] woke up this morning looking up at it
[44:32] brother Joe and looking up at the The
[44:35] Strokes on the brush you know I thought
[44:38] well he's still here his work still is
[44:42] here whether we live a short time or
[44:46] whether we live a long time we're known
[44:47] by our
[44:49] work and our work follows us it creates
[44:52] a legacy for us and if we do bad work
[44:56] it's always there there's a story
[44:59] there's a saying that says if you do
[45:01] good work you'll tell seven people
[45:03] somebody does bad work they'll tell
[45:05] they'll tell 48
[45:08] people Roger was a guy that did good
[45:11] work and and uh he painted this church
[45:14] over and over again he did a lot of work
[45:17] here and helping to keep things
[45:20] going Roger was the kind of guy that
[45:23] this church could be bopping and the
[45:24] walls the walls sweating and with the
[45:27] shouts of the glory of God and hundreds
[45:29] shouting here and Roger was sitting
[45:31] still enjoying it all you know I never I
[45:35] never saw him shout I I never saw him
[45:37] jump I never saw him
[45:39] scream you know when I got a call from
[45:42] Brother Roger I got a few of them as
[45:44] being his Pastor I always knew he had
[45:47] something to tell me because I'd sat
[45:50] with him at tables and and having dinner
[45:53] and he never said a word you just you
[45:55] carried the conversation
[45:58] how many how many of you knew him that
[46:01] way yeah I I know that he and sister
[46:04] Vicky had no issues CU he didn't talk
[46:08] so for you to have trouble somebody's
[46:11] got to be the
[46:15] talker we loved
[46:18] him we loved him with all of our hearts
[46:21] and if we could stand here and
[46:23] congratulate him today we'd like to say
[46:25] congratulations on a job well done amen
[46:29] and uh he will be deeply missed here at
[46:33] this audience and we loved him with all
[46:35] of our hearts a couple of weeks ago he
[46:37] was sitting in the back because he
[46:38] didn't feel like coming down little did
[46:41] we know that that would be his last
[46:42] service here for him to struggle to get
[46:45] in and then struggle to leave and sister
[46:48] Connie would speak with him for for a
[46:50] few minutes there and talk to him and he
[46:52] would tell her that he wasn't feeling
[46:54] well the other day when when when and we
[46:57] heard he was in tough shape I went to
[47:00] the house there on Friday afternoon
[47:03] and and I went into the room with him
[47:06] and and uh he was in really bad shape
[47:09] and weighing about 110 PBS and I grabbed
[47:13] a hold of him and hugged his body and he
[47:16] did his very best to hug me and I begin
[47:19] to pray for him and and tell him that
[47:22] Roger I'm not the the last guest that
[47:25] you're going to see
[47:27] there's a guest that's going to walk
[47:28] into this room and you've been looking
[47:30] for him for a long time you know for a
[47:33] pastor to walk into someone knowing that
[47:36] this will probably be the last time you
[47:37] see them and there's a prayer that you
[47:40] begin to pray for them just to let them
[47:43] know that death is not nothing for a
[47:45] Christian to be scared
[47:48] of now if you're not a Christian you
[47:50] ought to be really
[47:52] terrified but if you're a Christian the
[47:54] Lord Jesus said I go to prepare a place
[47:58] for you that where I am there you may be
[48:03] also as I have instructed these guys
[48:05] that are sitting behind us one of the
[48:08] ways that you'll know is when a when a
[48:11] saint is getting ready to go home
[48:13] there's a always a warm presence that's
[48:15] already attending the the saint that is
[48:18] getting ready to go and you can feel
[48:20] that warm presence and it's getting
[48:22] ready to take that child of God home I'm
[48:26] thankful
[48:28] F I'm thankful that there is a land
[48:30] beyond the
[48:32] river I'm thankful that there's more
[48:34] than just being born and being raised up
[48:37] as a little child and going to school
[48:40] and you know life is Tough Enough on its
[48:43] own it's very difficult we look around
[48:46] in this crazy generation that we're
[48:49] living in and there's chaos
[48:52] everywhere some of the most smartest
[48:54] people in the world is having having all
[48:57] kind of chaos presidents don't know what
[49:00] to do dictators don't know what to do it
[49:03] only shows that there's a tribulation
[49:05] period that is setting
[49:07] in but there is a Lord Jesus that's made
[49:11] us a
[49:13] promise you see he's turning from the
[49:15] Gentiles and he's headed toward the Jews
[49:18] now and there's a Rapture that's on
[49:21] setting brother Roger got just a little
[49:23] Glimpse he got a little bump before our
[49:26] our Rapture he'll come back to see us
[49:29] along with all of our loved ones and
[49:31] we'll see him and I'm looking forward to
[49:34] that day to shaking his hand not as a
[49:36] man standing in a decrepit
[49:39] body not a man that's struggling to make
[49:42] a step in front of another step and
[49:45] struggling for breath and struggling for
[49:47] situations but a man that's standing
[49:49] there totally
[49:52] well in Psalms chapter
[49:55] 46 it's says God is our refuge and
[50:00] strength a very present help in
[50:04] trouble therefore will not we fear
[50:08] though the Earth be removed and though
[50:09] the mountains be carried into the midst
[50:11] of the sea though the waters thereof
[50:14] Roar and be troubled though the mountain
[50:16] shake and the swelling thereof there is
[50:19] a river and the streams thereof whereof
[50:22] shall make glad the city of God the holy
[50:25] place of the Tabernacle Les of the most
[50:27] high God is in the midst of her and she
[50:30] shall not be moved God shall help her
[50:34] and and that right early the Heathen
[50:37] raged and the kingdoms were moved he
[50:39] uttered his voice and the Earth melted
[50:42] the Lord of host is with us the god of
[50:46] Jacob is our
[50:49] refuge Revelations chap 21 tells us of
[50:53] our
[50:54] future we all know our past
[50:58] past but I like our
[51:01] future and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[51:05] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[51:08] Earth were passed away and there was no
[51:11] more sea and I John saw the holy city
[51:14] the New Jerusalem coming down from God
[51:16] out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[51:19] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[51:21] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[51:23] the Tabernacle of God is with men and
[51:26] will dwell with them and they shall be
[51:28] his people and God himself shall be with
[51:30] them and be their God God shall wipe
[51:34] away all the tears from their eyes and
[51:38] there shall be no more death what a
[51:42] place there shall be no more death
[51:45] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[51:48] there be any more pain for the former
[51:51] things are passed away and he that sat
[51:55] upon the throne said behold I make all
[51:57] things
[51:58] new and he said unto me right for these
[52:02] words are true and faithful and he said
[52:06] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[52:08] the beginning and the end and I will
[52:10] give unto him that is a thirst of
[52:12] Fountain of Water of Life
[52:14] freely he that overcometh shall inherit
[52:19] all
[52:20] things and I will be his God and he
[52:24] shall be my son
[52:27] I stand here as an executor of the whe
[52:31] today I have no clue what brother Roger
[52:35] owned I don't have any I don't have any
[52:39] idea what he had in the
[52:41] bank I'm not a nosy
[52:45] preacher and it's plain none of my
[52:48] business but I want to tell you today
[52:51] Roger shiplet was rich am
[52:56] yes Lord he was
[53:00] rich he was richer than every president
[53:03] we've ever
[53:05] had he was richer than every General
[53:08] that has stood for the United States of
[53:11] America he was richer than anybody in
[53:16] Hollywood and he's definitely richer
[53:18] than all the congressmen and Senators
[53:20] that we've got
[53:22] there I would say at least 98% of them
[53:27] he owned eternal
[53:30] life and when you're a possessor of
[53:33] eternal life how can we
[53:36] lose I was being pushed three weeks ago
[53:40] from from from the emergency room having

[54:29] okay let me just say this to you but
[54:31] some of you are

[54:38] this to remind
[54:40] ourself we come to a spot to where life
[54:42] the heart TI ticks no
[54:46] more and we're all one breath from
[54:49] eternal
[54:51] life but if my heart would kick
[54:54] off even while I'm speaking to you I'm
[55:00] okay I'm
[55:03] okay are
[55:13] you all of us have

[55:24] calamities and great diffic difficult
[55:27] difficulties none of us have ever had a
[55:30] day like job
[55:34] had it's the oldest book in the
[55:37] Bible but none of us have had a day like
[55:40] job had he lost it
[55:43] all he lost his wealth he lost his
[55:47] children he lost his
[55:49] family even his wife would turn against
[55:53] him and begin to tell him why don't you
[55:56] Curse God and
[55:57] die you see he didn't realize that there
[56:00] had been a a meeting with God and and
[56:03] his enemy and his enemy had
[56:07] said you know what can I do with
[56:10] job can I get to
[56:13] him and he said I've been searching to
[56:16] and fro in the earth seeking whom I may
[56:19] devour and God asked him have you
[56:22] considered my servant job
[56:26] I sure have but you got to hedge about
[56:29] him I can't get to him aren't you glad
[56:32] that God protects
[56:35] you aren't you glad that God protects
[56:44] you and Satan said well when I when I
[56:47] when I put my test against
[56:50] him he'll curse you and die but God had
[56:53] so much confidence in him you do what
[56:56] you you want to with
[56:58] him but he he'll stand the
[57:01] test Roger had some test in his
[57:05] life he had some incredible test in his
[57:08] life a Man shows what he is when he goes
[57:11] through
[57:12] test you know job had lost his family he
[57:15] had lost his wealth now his physical
[57:18] body was in a
[57:19] wreck his friends were making front of
[57:21] him saying he was a sinner and now his
[57:24] wife was asking him why don't you first
[57:26] got and
[57:28] die I want to take you to a conversation
[57:31] I won't hold you long but I want to take
[57:32] you to a
[57:34] conversation God
[57:35] came and visited
[57:38] job wouldn't you appreciate it that God
[57:41] would come and visit
[57:43] you God would come now let me just say
[57:46] this to you whether it be a president or
[57:48] a queen whatever you'd be incredibly
[57:51] impressed that they would take the time
[57:52] to come and visit you but the creator of
[57:55] heavens and earth
[57:57] and all the busyness of
[57:59] Eternity came to a man named
[58:03] Joe now when God came to this man he
[58:07] didn't talk to him not one sentence
[58:09] about all that he was going
[58:12] through he didn't talk to him about a
[58:15] pity party that he was having he didn't
[58:17] talk to him about all that he' lost he
[58:19] didn't talk to him about his family he
[58:22] didn't talk to him about how he would
[58:23] rebuild his business
[58:27] as a matter of fact he didn't talk to
[58:28] him anything about temporary
[58:31] situations he talked to him about
[58:35] eternity and he began to talk to him and
[58:37] he said where was you
[58:40] job when I laid the foundations of the
[58:44] Earth where was you at form the
[58:47] mountains and form the
[58:50] universe he was reminding him that I had
[58:54] you in eternity
[58:57] I got you now and I will always have you
[59:01] I'm thankful that there is a God that
[59:03] knows knows our
[59:06] past knows our present and knows our
[59:12] future aren't you glad of
[59:17] that maybe you would like to question
[59:20] the Angels what's the greatest thing
[59:22] that you've ever seen what's the
[59:24] greatest treasure that could you could
[59:26] ever have maybe we could ask Gabriel
[59:29] today of all that you have saw God do
[59:33] what would be the greatest treasure that
[59:35] you could talk up to me
[59:38] about eternal
[59:42] life eternal
[59:45] life
[59:46] Abraham you as a young man that got old
[59:51] and God came and visited you turned you
[59:54] back to a young man again but you would
[59:56] get old again and and pass away
[1:00:03] Abraham what would be your greatest
[1:00:05] treasure that you could talk
[1:00:07] about
[1:00:09] run eternal
[1:00:12] life eternal life would be the greatest
[1:00:19] treasure brother Ron what what's the
[1:00:23] difference if you live to be 25 years
[1:00:26] old and you don't have eternal
[1:00:29] life you're not such a rich
[1:00:33] man Jesus would make the comparison if a
[1:00:36] man gained the whole
[1:00:39] world and lose his
[1:00:42] soul what profit
[1:00:45] him Napoleon came very close to
[1:00:50] Conquering the whole
[1:00:53] world but he couldn't conquer himself
[1:00:58] so if you gain the whole
[1:01:00] world and you lose your
[1:01:05] soul you don't have what Roger
[1:01:11] had you don't have what Roger
[1:01:13] had and Roger sat quietly and
[1:01:18] humbly and was a phenomenal
[1:01:22] man but today
[1:01:26] standing
[1:01:28] somewhere in a young
[1:01:31] body enjoying
[1:01:36] Fellowship how do you know that brother
[1:01:38] Ron Jesus was having a a conversation
[1:01:42] with his
[1:01:45] disciples and no doubt Jesus is getting
[1:01:48] ready to go
[1:01:51] away these disciples could not
[1:01:54] understand what Cal is getting ready to
[1:01:57] happen or even when he is about to be
[1:02:02] beat like no other man was ever to be
[1:02:07] beat Jesus has a conversation with his
[1:02:11] disciples and he tells
[1:02:14] them let not your heart be troubled you
[1:02:17] believe in
[1:02:21] God I'm going to go and prepare a place
[1:02:25] for you you that where I am there you
[1:02:29] may be also he wasn't talking about
[1:02:32] brick and stone and rock and
[1:02:34] mortar he was talking about a new
[1:02:38] body he was answering job's question if
[1:02:41] a man die shall he live
[1:02:45] again you know sometimes we think well
[1:02:47] brother Ron we shouldn't be too noisy in
[1:02:51] church we should be
[1:02:54] quiet well I I wonder when Jesus opened
[1:02:57] up Abraham's bosom and all those people
[1:03:01] were LED captivity captive throughout
[1:03:03] the Old Testament and was set free
[1:03:06] Abraham and Moses and Jeremiah Nehemiah
[1:03:11] that had been held captive by death all
[1:03:13] of this time and now the greatest
[1:03:15] champion that would ever live open those
[1:03:19] Gates I would imagine there was a
[1:03:22] celebration like never before
[1:03:27] and I end today with this brother Roger
[1:03:30] I never saw him too emotional
[1:03:35] here but I'd say he's quite emotional in
[1:03:38] that other
[1:03:39] realm and I'd say he's going to be quite
[1:03:42] emotional when it comes back to this
[1:03:44] realm just before our Rapture and to go
[1:03:48] home to meet the Lord in the
[1:03:51] air for where we're
[1:03:53] going we'll never have a another
[1:03:56] memorial
[1:04:01] service we live in one of the most
[1:04:03] beautiful places on Earth the shanor
[1:04:07] valley Roger got to live here his life
[1:04:12] he watched the leaves as they would turn
[1:04:13] and God would paint
[1:04:16] nature all of the beauty that we have
[1:04:20] here but that's
[1:04:23] death it's telling us that Winter's
[1:04:27] coming I used to be a redheaded
[1:04:30] guy blood red
[1:04:34] hair I really didn't like it until I got
[1:04:38] white
[1:04:40] hair and I wish I had blood red hair
[1:04:45] again but this is telling
[1:04:50] us that this body is headed back to the
[1:04:52] ground if there's not a rapture
[1:04:57] this is telling me as I get up in the
[1:04:59] morning and
[1:05:00] fight and try to live and Fight For
[1:05:08] Life there'll be a day where I don't
[1:05:10] take chemo no
[1:05:12] more there will be a day where there's
[1:05:15] no more leaves turning different
[1:05:22] colors I want to tell you of our future
[1:05:25] the there's a future
[1:05:26] home and it looks real good
[1:05:31] oh and here's what I want to ask you I
[1:05:35] don't want one of you to miss
[1:05:39] it God won't send you to
[1:05:43] hell right he's not that kind of a God
[1:05:47] he sends nobody to Hell well who does
[1:05:50] brother Ron the man in the mirror
[1:05:57] the man in the
[1:05:59] mirror sends you to
[1:06:03] Hell brother rbot I didn't have a chance
[1:06:06] when you're going down the road and you
[1:06:08] hear an old gospel song and it begins to
[1:06:10] speak to your
[1:06:11] heart when you see a poem or you see a
[1:06:15] scripture on the
[1:06:17] sign it sended you a message when the
[1:06:21] preacher preaches at a funeral it's your
[1:06:24] opportunity
[1:06:28] not what with we do with what our life's
[1:06:31] passed cuz that's done we can't do
[1:06:33] anything with that but what about your
[1:06:37] future what about your
[1:06:41] future brother Ron I'm a really mean
[1:06:44] man yeah I
[1:06:46] know all of us were amen I got a lot of
[1:06:50] wickedness in my life all of us had
[1:06:53] that but Jesus
[1:07:01] came nobody thought the founding pastor
[1:07:05] of this church would ever be a
[1:07:09] preacher but Jesus
[1:07:14] came when I was a little boy there was a
[1:07:17] man that sat in our
[1:07:21] church and he was about 72 years
[1:07:24] old and he had sat
[1:07:27] there his son-in-law was the pastor of
[1:07:29] the church where we attended in
[1:07:33] Christiansburg and he sat there all of
[1:07:35] those years and we liked him
[1:07:38] because he always told Sports stories
[1:07:40] and he always had
[1:07:44] candy and was just a pleasant guy to be
[1:07:50] around he always sat on the back
[1:07:54] row he never
[1:07:55] never really got into any service that I
[1:07:58] ever saw
[1:08:02] him it was a Wednesday
[1:08:06] night I watched Marvin
[1:08:09] Porter slip out of the back of that
[1:08:12] building and walk past about 700
[1:08:16] seats and walk up and do something he
[1:08:19] had never did
[1:08:22] before and he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:08:29] amen I was the last one to see him
[1:08:33] too and I wrapped my hands around him
[1:08:35] and before the Lord came and took him
[1:08:39] home but from 72 till his late
[1:08:43] 80s I never saw a man that passionate to
[1:08:47] serve the
[1:08:50] Lord Jesus would do that for every one
[1:08:52] of
[1:08:53] you I've watched him
[1:08:56] I found him to be
[1:08:58] real I found him to be more than a
[1:09:01] picture on the
[1:09:02] wall but I found
[1:09:05] him to be real
[1:09:07] true I found him to be
[1:09:11] honest now let me say this to
[1:09:14] you he will never let you
[1:09:18] down amen thank you
