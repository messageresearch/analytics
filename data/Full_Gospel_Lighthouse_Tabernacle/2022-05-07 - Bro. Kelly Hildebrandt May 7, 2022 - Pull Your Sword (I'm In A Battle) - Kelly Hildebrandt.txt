hildebrand is one of the finest men that's ever walked in shoe leather we have seen what the lord has done through brother kelly's ministry through here and to think that what happened two years ago when brother kelly came just before the closing down of the pandemic and all of those things and the sermon that went before don't worry and then to come and hand that coin to our pastor not knowing what we were about to go through to accept nothing less than full victory the angel has come and stood in this day and said accept nothing but full victory these are the words that he has spoken brother kelly is the kind of gentleman and i i'm not building up the man i'm building up the god that is in brother kelly brother kelly has a ministry and he has a gift that he will make you a better person he will make you a better christian he will bring you to a higher level so tonight as you're listening you're not just listening to a mortal man or you're hearing from a side of heaven that was

we thank you oh god that you're mindful of all the details within our lives lord you know this company of people that are here this morning this evening our lord and you know the reason why they're

control of this service now for your glory lord we committed unto you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you you may have your seats momentarily good evening god bless you it's so good to be back in virginia this is a it feels like a miracle for sister myra and myself to be here it's about two and a half years ago that we were here december of 2019 and it was an incredible journey to get here in itself took us three days and but we did arrive and and we did speak and we thanked the lord for him with all of the pandemic and everything that was happening back home i didn't know if we would ever actually be able to leave our own country again but everything settled itself down and and i say here we are i have to say this time sister admired myself when we were traveling it was the best trip that we've ever had this is our first trip since we were here so we we came here and now we're back again we haven't flown since that time i was kind of wondering should i get back on airplane i don't like it when motors start to smoke and things that's not something i actually really appreciate i really thought we were going to crash but they got us back to the airport in calgary and then we made our journey but this particular time we never had one hiccup the flights were all on time the planes were full uh and we met every connection we had no issues with customs we had no issues with security everything was 100 and we arrived in richmond virginia virginia and here we are in your beautiful shenandoah valley and we certainly do appreciate every one of your prayers that you prayed for us on our journey here this year thank you very much from sister meyer myself god bless you as brother andrew just mentioned that particular time brother ron ministered that saturday night on a message don't worry and on that sunday afternoon i brought that commemorative coin with me and i presented it to brother ron and on that particular coin it says a full victory we don't we as christians we don't have to worry about will we win you have already won it's already a promise in the word of god amen we may go through battles and we may go through struggles and we may go through different things and brother ron was set to go through an incredible journey but he's still here today and we still believe the testimony to true is true that god is his healer amen he's been a great encouragement to us his fortitude and and and just his desire to keep pressing the battle and every time he ministers it gives us a real hope of what god is doing in the bride of the lord jesus christ today my question is is that if we do believe and we've been given the word of god in this hour why would we want to retract on the word of god we may have ten thousand demons in front of us but what's ten thousand demons to a son of god who's filled with the holy ghost it's only demons demons are something you put under your feet that's not something you have to concern yourself with it's something that you already are the victor over because jesus christ defeated it i like him to hear it every day when i speak jesus defeated you satan on calvary you have no right to hold the people of almighty god he's almighty god i'm glad we're on his side amen i'd like to also thank the the fraser family for allowing us to be at their children's wedding it was such a beautiful event and god bless you and trust that um brother zachary and sister mayor they made it to their safe destination you know when we got married we drove 100 miles to go to our honeymoon spot we didn't take a trip halfway around the world to do it but i mentioned to brother wrong but we couldn't afford to fill up our tank back then either gas was only about a 50 70 cents a gallon but it was just a wonderful time that we shared together with them and what a beautiful couple they are amen sure love to sit down and talk with every one of you two sometime and it gave us an opportunity to do that at the wedding but sometime some glorious day what a grand time it's going to be since we were here last as well my understanding is there's certain ones that have gone on to be with the lord and we give our sincere condolences to each and every one of you may the lord be with you and we have a hope and a promise that one day very soon we're going to meet them again amen i'm looking forward to that time is that resurrection mourning the saints of god coming out of the graves and what a grand day it's going to be that's why we're here tonight is to be able to give him honor and glory and to prepare ourselves for that great event amen on that particular time our little country church back home they send their greetings to every each and every one of you sister kay and my brother kenton and sister lorraine and my whole family they send their personal greetings to you i have a grandson and i have a seven grandson to be honest with you one granddaughter i had a granddaughter and i always tell her all the time that she's the best granddaughter i have and she's 14 years old now and she hears it all the time and she said well grandpa i'm the only granddaughter i said i said well that's good because you're the special one but i have one grandson the second oldest his name was marcus they were here quite a few years ago after they lost their father and i've always given my grandchildren turn a certain age and i let them know that they can travel with me to some destination i always think well maybe i'll take them overseas or take them to a different place this is really encouraging do you know where he wants to go right here right here in virginia [Applause] when i when i when he heard i was coming here the first question that he said to me said grandpa can i come with you i said not this trip but the next trip we come we'll bring you along amen isn't that special he sure thinks highly of you all and that's this is where he wants to come is right here amen if you have your bibles today i'd like to read second corinthians chapter 6 verse 7 and 10. the lord's been good to us he's kept us all these months and days amen appreciate the atmosphere that's here tonight god bless you second corinthians and paul is speaking here to the corinthian church and he uses these words by the word of truth we could say that that is something that we are a possessor of out of all the generations of time we've been the ones in this generation to be given all the truth amen not a partial gospel but the whole of the gospel it says by the word of truth by the power of god which is the dunamis of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil reporting good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always let's say always tonight i say it one more time always yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things amen god bless you you may have your seats tonight look at your neighbor and on the left and then your neighbor on the right and tell them every promise of god is mine tell the ones behind you the same and the ones in front of you the same every promise of god is mine now what you've just done is you've just confessed with your own lips that every promise that's in the word of god belongs to you personally you you can look at your neighbor and you say well it's only for him or it's only for her it's only for the pastor or maybe the deacons but no every promise in the word of god belongs to you [Music] amen i'd like to my title tonight if i would give it a title would be pull your sword pull your sword and my subtitle would be i'm in a battle we're all in a battle it doesn't matter what we're what we're we're going through things but we're all in a battle we need to learn how to pull our sword and fight with all this within our heart i brought a commemorated coin uh with me the last time as i mentioned we were here that i said we'll accept nothing but full victory and i prayed and i felt if the lord would bring me back to virginia one time one more time there was something i was going to actually bring here for brother ron spencer today and today i'd like to to present this to brother ron and it's a little statue and this particular statue is is david it's david and right over here is an enemy and his foot's on the enemy he's got a sword it's just one thing to have full victory but it's another thing when your enemy is dead and i i i put a name on the statue your enemy is dead brother one [Applause] i'm sorry gotta get it right all right you can be seated i've never interrupted a speaker but i'm going to now i've carried that coin all over the world i don't know how i'm going to carry that for those that know statue is a perfect gift i i'm not going to interrupt but about 30 seconds how many remember the vision of brother branham as he was speaking and he had a certain jacket on well i have great expectations because kelly's wearing that jacket tonight [Applause] [Applause] special for us to bring that here because we believe your enemy's dead doctors may have one report but there's another report hallelujah the lord is good to us if you have your bibles as well i'd also like to read genesis chapter 12 verse 7. excuse me for my emotion and the lord appeared unto abraham and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there built he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him in genesis 13 which is just across the page genesis 13 14 to 17 and the bible says and the lord said unto abraham after the lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward southward eastward and westward for all the lamb which i'll see is to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise let's say arise tonight arise and walk arise is a forward motion amen you're not supposed to sit down and just let the world go by but we have something to do in this hour and the bible says arise and walk through the land and the length of it and in the breath of it for i will give it unto thee god bless you you may have your seats now abraham had come out of out of his place and he brought with him lot who was was his nephew and it came to a place in a position in that time where where lots herdsmen and abraham's herdsmen were having a difficult time with one another but everything happens for a purpose and for a reason because god was about to bring a blessing onto abraham and to his seed and there's only one way he could do that and that was to actually have a separation between lot and abraham now you know as well as i know that that we can say a lot of words and we may have a lot of head knowledge and we may may be able to quote the message and even quote the scripture verbatimly but if there's still something within our lives that is not separated from us if not all unbelief is out of our lives how can god ever bring a real blessing to our lives into our hearts amen i'm not going to preach anything new today but i just want to share my heart with you i believe that the bride of the lord jesus christ must not have one doubt in their heart concerning the word of god for the word of god is given to us to give us life it's given to us to give us joy it's given to us to give us peace but above all it gives us the fortitude that we have need of every day to fight the good fight of faith amen now it's true there's more demon power than there's ever been but there's a greater word than we've ever had before because god will always rise a standard against the enemy amen if abraham ham had to walk through the breath of it and the length of it and the complete part how much more does every one of us have to take the word of god not just as a letter but something that is living within our own lives and living with our own hearts amen i believe the word of god is true i believe that every promise in the word of god is for every individual amen when brother branham says that if we take the right mental attitude towards the word of god that god will actually perform it through our lives i believe that with all my heart amen i always the people back home say brother kelly why do you always look into yourself if there's a situation i say because i want to be sure that there's nothing in my heart that's actually blocking or stopping the moving of the holy spirit amen because the holy spirit wants to move in this hour if we can just get ourselves out of the way while we know in ourselves that the real enemy is a lot of times it's just our self when we look in the mirror we see who he is amen but we all have a word of god and i believe that we're moving up it's not just any word we have in this hour but it's a special word for the bride of jesus christ it's a word to get us prepared for the rapture i don't know about you all but that's all i desire that's all i'm waiting for that's my whole goal is that they sang that song tonight ain't no grave going to hold me down that's the song brother homer saying a lot the first time we came here i never forget that song because we can say with the shirts that's the assurance tonight we can see if the shirts there is no grave going to hold this body down amen we believe with all of our heart amen if i go to the grave on that grand morning he's going to call we're going to raise up from the grave again because it's a promise of the word of god amen i'm not going to sell my short self short and say well it's only for this person or that person i had a brother tell me one time well i don't know brother kelly i don't know if it's for me i said it's for you i said who else is it for he said well i got so many problems in my life i say why don't you just lay your problems at the altar get rid of whatever's hindering in you in your life and allow the holy spirit to take control and start saying what god said about you quit saying what the devil is putting in your ear amen start to have discernment in your life amen well i don't know why people want to sell themselves out that that they don't have uh that that god's not gonna gonna help them i said man he came to save sinners amen but he wasn't gonna he was gonna change our lives amen in the message jehovah jireh it says no abraham the promise was made to abraham and his seed after him not only abraham but his seed now the seed natural seed of abraham was isaac but the spiritual seed of abraham's faith was christ not through isaac all the world was blessed but through christ let's say christ the royal seed all the world was blessed for he died for all people all nations and all peoples amen if i read that i read a prophetic word and that means that he died for all of us now it's up to you to accept him it's up to you to say i'm going to pull my sword amen but a lot of people their swords are so seized in the sheath because they haven't had it out for a while i say this morning whatever this evening whatever you need to do pull your sword out amen let's fight this good fight of faith let's lay a hold on eternal things let's not let the devil cow us down but let's show him who the boss is in this hour amen we're sons and daughters of the living god amen take your position church move in the name of the lord in the power of the holy spirit don't allow the enemy to pull you down if sickness is in your way take a hold of it if something's in your life then get rid of it and put christ in this place amen we need to take our positions amen can you imagine you're getting something from the lord and and you're not even interested in it he says i'm going to give you eternal life and people want to want to have the attitude that's not for them when it's for them christ paid the price for you amen and if christ paid the price what are we concerned about amen what are we concerned about amen you say well i've got a lot of things happening in my life a lot of difficult things what are you concerned about if christ is for you who can be against you amen you've been given a word of promise we've been given a word a promise amen brother branham does not did not come just to put it in a book form but he came that it would become a living life within each and every one of our hearts somebody say praise the lord it says and i see so possess the gates of the enemy he said then you say brother brown i'm a gentile i could not have the seed of abraham the seed of abraham wasn't i know you know these things but just let bear with me the seed of abraham wasn't the natural seed it was the spiritual scene amen that's who we are for the circumcision of that was nothing the promise he even gave him circumcision but it was given to him before circumcision and it wasn't because he was circumcised and in the covenant with god that way is because that abraham let's say abraham abraham believe god amen i believe we have a lot of believers in here this evening hour amen a lot of people who believe god who take god at his word and move in that word and the scripture said when we are dead in christ we become abraham's seed paul speaks of it and that which is jew is not jude overly but you inwardly therefore if you are born of the spirit of god you are abraham's seed and our heirs with abraham according to the promise see therefore every promise that god gave abraham is yours because spiritually you are abraham c i love it when i read the promises of god i take that to my heart because god's word is true it was god that spoke to abraham and said arise and walk through the land in the length of it the breath of it not for i will give it unto you we've heard for years that footprints is possession no doubt you've heard it many times over this very pulpit by many different men of god footprint says possession that means wherever you put your feet in the word of god it belongs to you it becomes a personal part of you as you say well what about maybe it's just for brother ron no it's for you too because it's personal the word of god is not vague in the sense of a vagueness but the word of god speaks personally to each one of us and in that when it speaks to us in a personal way it's up to us to take all the thoughts of doubt that would try to hinder our life and we all have them and take those thoughts and bring them into subjection to the word of god amen in order that we can climb higher in christ i want to climb higher every day every service i want to go higher my my desire is to get so high in the lord until i don't even think about myself anymore all i can see is christ living through me amen i want him to be visible through my life i want to have the the the the testimony when people see see me see you they say i know that person is a real christian i've seen them in the hot seat i've seen them under pressure i've watched how they reacted and i saw that there was really the spirit of the living god living down in their heart amen i want that to be my testimony i trust you want that to be your testimony amen that christ has full preeminence in each one of our lives amen can i have a name amen for that amen now the word arise in the hebrew it means to be void to be proven to be fulfilled i mean excuse me not void to be valid to be proven to be fulfilled in other words god is validating his word he got a stamp of approval on it i want to say his word is all powerful amen it doesn't take a big man david wasn't a big man he was just a small ruddy person but there was something in his heart that he knew that god's word was true and he also knew that he was anointed by the prophet samuel amen we're all born by one spirit into one body we've been given the same anointing esha that god has given in each one of our lives and when he came into the count that day he wasn't concerned about no giants he wasn't concerned about nothing but when he heard goliath make his big bows it didn't matter to him how big he was how broad he was how heavy he was when anything about him he just said who's this uncircumcised philistine is defying the armies of the living god amen and there was something in his heart that says i'm gonna tear him down you're going to have something in your heart amen to tear them down when the devil comes in front of you you're going to tear his kingdom down not let him get the preeminence in your life but tear it down [Applause] he went worried goliath had his big bows his boats were just vanity to david because remember words have power and david's his words were a lot more assertive he thought this is you're sending a doggo to me to fight me and david said no i come to you underneath the power of the living god amen i come to you in the name of the lord god of israel amen i'm not going to fall over your feet but you're going to fall before me amen and we've said it many times that that that david went fearlessly let's say fearlessly amen he wasn't concerned about him we go to the doctor and i'm the same way i got situations i deal with and the doctor gives us a report immediately fear tries to grip ourselves david had no fear of that amen because he was anointed for his day amen what would happen if the bride of the lord jesus christ would realize who she is and that she is an invincible army amen and she would take the word of god and start to fight the good fight of faith until the devil had absolutely no preeminence at all on the bride i said this back home and i i think it bears repeating i don't know how god is going to do it universally but somehow we're all going to come to that spot can i say that again i don't know how god's going to do it but somehow we're all going to get to the place of maturity at the same time because god it's god's program it's not our program we're only here to follow his word to obey his word and whatever comes before us that's not of god to tear it down david didn't even have his own sword he took goliath's own words and cut his neck off i like what i liked about this statue brother ron is that he wasn't dainty where he put his foot either hey one day to you about it he put his foot right where it should be right over his mouth i know about the devil whispers in your ear but i like to put my foot over his mouth brother branham of blind bartimaeus he said sister in that wheelchair on the stretcher god promise you healing you'll have to fight every inch of it the devil will make you fight with the sword of god every inch of it but remember footsteps is possession wheresoever your foot treads that i give unto you every step you make you know that gets me feeling religious i can say that this evening as well because footsteps is possession all the land that your feet will tread upon in this promised land it's yours amen let's say it's mine we're saying yes it's mine oh yes it's mine amen every promise god gives belongs to the bride of christ amen and i would like to say to every believer tonight any anything that you can take any divine promise god claim it hold on to it it belongs to you i could stand here and testify for for for a long time all that god has done in our lives and with our family and what he's done with the people in our assembly miraculous healings amen it's not just a one church move it's a universal move god is moving all over the world amen because people are taking them at his word and they're believing that word now in your walk with the lord there's obstacles obstacles and the dictionary obstacle means something that impends progress or achievement i was looking that up and i i found it interesting because they used an analogy and they say that mosquitoes were the greatest obstacle in the building of the panama canal i thought mosquitoes you know how big that thing is you guys have them up here too don't you are down here i should say i thought maybe when we had him in canada but it's probably one of the creatures that that i hate the most i've never seen anybody feed away i've never seen that i'll tell you what i've seen i've seen in the middle of a night you're sitting in a tent or in a house or something like that and you hear those those wonderful music absolutely i'll tell you what you wake up you say oh that's just a mosquito i'm just going to go back to sleep no you turn on the light and you have one thing to do that's to hunt that thing down our problem says to admire myself is we can't see so we first have to find our glasses before we can find out where it's at it's just a little wee thing it's just a mosquito i'm glad they're not in the millennium i thought i'd get an amen on that one but i'm glad they're not in the millennium are we all glad about that well we can agree on something tonight no mosquitoes in the millennium it's just a small insect but i want to just say this possibly there could be a small besetting situation in your life that's causing you a lot of problems might not even be very big it's hindering you from actually accepting and believing all the word of god it's one thing to say it with your mouth but it's another thing to say with your heart there's a whole difference there amen when it's a revelation in your heart you can you're standing on the rock then you you know where you're at amen but sometimes there's little things that people pick up in life and and and i've i've watched this back at home we're in the time of maturity it's okay if i just take my time we're in the time of the bride is in the place of maturity let's say maturity so the closer we get to maturity the seed within our own lives starts to manifest itself amen it don't matter what the seed is it's going to manifest itself you think you can hide but sooner or that thing with l lot of hearts they resist that thing when they should be saying oh glory to god praise the lord hallelujah i didn't even know that was in my life but it's so visible in my life night right now i'm going to lay that thing down right now i'm going to hunt that thing in my soul until that thing is completely eradicated within my own heart david said search my heart and when he when he said search my heart this his his thought pattern was is i do not i do not trust my own evaluation of my own life i need an outside source to check my life and check my heart you say brother kelly this elementary i'm just bringing what the lord put on my heart so you got to take it up with a boss amen and and so and we we sometimes we there's something so far hidden in our heart also just like that it's there and david said lord search my heart know my thoughts i want to know if there's any impending thing that's within my heart because his whole desire was i do not trust my own evaluations of myself so now i want you lord to search my heart so because i know you're going to tell me the truth amen and when you hear the truth or you hear something that's that's that's in your life you should be dancing on the pews as it were thanking god for coming by your way to bring deliverance in your life but it seems the people want to put their heels in and they want to stop the moving of god i say no lord i don't want to stop the movie of the lord move through my life and through my heart i want you to move through my whole being so when i'm ready for service i'm ready for the service of the king there's nothing then in my way i can pray i can preach amen with confidence in the word of god that god's word is true and his word will never fail somebody say praise the lord amen it's time to rise and shine for the glory of the lord has come upon this bride in this hour [Applause] it's not time to retract he said arise and walk it's a it's a positive thing it's something that moves us in a propelling place we're moving forward in the word of the lord we're not moving backwards no it's like when when when moses came to the red sea and when he came to the sea god had brought him there for a reason because he knew that if they would see war they want to go back to egypt but here they were locked in and god was about to show them the glory of the lord hallelujah they had a pillar of fire by day and and a cloud by day and a pill or fire by night amen that god was with the people and he said to moses why are you crying unto me speak the word and bring this people forward they didn't tell them to go back to egypt they told them to go forward to canaanland to the land of promise the land that was given to abraham their father he said it's your land i've given it to you and to this day it's still their land amen we're we're not just under right now underneath just a luther's message or a wesleyan message we're not underneath even the outpouring of the of the gifts of 1906 but we have the full word of god today now we don't do away with this but we take it and we and we accept it in our lives and you allow the gifts of god to move i'm going to stop here for one moment what i find unfortunately is people wants to go back to what they had they don't want to go forward into what god has for them hey man i've heard of the statement many years ago that god has put the gifts on the shelf as it were and and what they what they have now is nothing but a a bunch of dead churches a bunch of dead people people that don't know how to worship people don't know how to praise the lord people that don't know how to get in the spirit and they just got nothing but dead dead churches i want to say they're double dead i know who's listened tonight but they're plucked up by the root amen they're dead i have to be honest i always say the spirit of god needs a liberty to move in the house of god the spirit of god has the liberty to move in each and every one of our hearts amen people say oh it's going to get out of control oh i said brother brown said the spirit of god never gets out of he's a gentleman hey man people are afraid to dance in the spirit hope it's okay people are afraid to get excited in the house of god i've had people sit in church and they looks like they're so so i don't know if they're happy or not but i know they're happy when they get out of church because they can smile i say if you can smile out of church you can smile in church if you get happy about a bold game out of church you get happy inside of the host of the lord when god is moving amongst the people amen rise and shine church give him glory give him praise he's a living god he wants to do exploits amongst the people amen he wants to deliver his people i say let's go forward in the power of god i'm not going backwards to egypt i'm not going backwards to the things of the world i'm going forward to our promised land i'm promised a new body one day i'm gonna step into that body no matter what the obstacles are i'm going forward amen anything that's hindering me i'm laying it down at the altar amen i believe the word of god we have a right to claim every promise that god has given us amen well you're gonna have to fight for it got to fight for it we all got to fight for it but he's already promised victory let's say victory say victory is mine amen that belongs to you amen don't let the devil take it from you victory is ours as you get to the more to place the maturity those seeds in our hearts they start to manifest themselves more now we've got two options get right with god lay it down or become prideful and belligerent about it is that okay i'm going to read second corinthians chapter 10 verses 3 to 5. i'm going to read it in the king james version that i want to read in the passion translation for though we walk in the flesh we're not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling town of strongholds casting down let's say casting down that means you take it and you throw it down and when you throw it down that means it's down amen and every high thing that exalted this self against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ now paul is giving us the key to have victory in our lives it's up to us to law unlocking and the passion translation that says for although we live in the natural realm we don't war a military campaign employing human weapons using manipulation to achieve our aims in other words what you see is what you get there's no objective here outside of christ jesus amen that's what that should be always our aim and verse 4 it said instead our spiritual weapons let's say our weapons our weapons are energized with divine power to effectively dismantle the defenses behind which people hide i read that one more time it says instead let's say instead our spiritual weapons are energized in other words there's a supernatural element to your weapon what is your weapon it ain't no physical sword it's a spiritual sword i want to say this sword does a whole lot more than the physical sword because it knows the thoughts and the intents of the heart it's a sharper sword amen our spiritual weapons are energized with divine power supernatural power to effectively dismantle in other words tear down the defenses by which people hide people can hide behind a smile people can hide behind a quote people can hide behind the scripture amen but the power of god the spirit of god is greater than all that it's energized by a supernatural element with jesus christ himself through the baptism of the holy ghost in ministers lives and it comes and dismantles the things people hide behind not to destroy the person but for victory in the person's life hallelujah it dismantles in other words it tears it down that's why in the king james says casting down imaginations it dismantles it it goes further in verse five it says we can demolish i like those words demolitions mean that is put to rubble it's put to rubble we can demolish every deceptive fantasy that opposes god and break through every arrogant attitude that is raised up in defiance of the true knowledge of god we capture like prisoners of war every thought let's say every thought and insist that it bow in obedience to the anointed one well there's only one anointed one and his name is jesus christ amen it bows in obedience to the word of god amen in the power of decision caleb and joshua would look into god's promise god said i've already give it to you hallelujah that's what's the matter with the people tonight in divine healing and everything it's yours go take it peace brother brown says again hallelujah god promised you to walk brethren you believe it you have to take it god promised you life brother do you believe it take it god promise you joy brother do you believe it take it do you have joy tonight amen then if you don't have joy then i say take it tonight amen god said i will give it to you it's yours now won't be right for god to go and dish all the things out he gave them the land they've got to do the house cleaning amen it's yours but we ain't gonna come poke it down your neck you've got to take the land yourself you you give it he give it to you it's yours arise and possess it hallelujah it's your choice if you want to murmur like the other 10 did say i'm awake if you want a murmur like the other 10 did you wander in the wilderness a long time i just want to say if you want to keep murmuring you're going to miss the rapture time to quit murmuring it's time to take the word believe the word and be positive about the word you say well i don't feel positive in my heart you keep positive words in your mouth and your body will come into subjection to the word of god but it's up to you to take the word believe the word use the word not sit back and well i don't know i don't know i really don't know if i feel like going to church saturday night had a long week and a lot of other things i can do brother andrew's just going to preach anyhow you know what he's been getting on my hide the last while i don't know if he has or not i haven't listened i do that purposely i don't know i don't know if i'm just going to take it anymore you know you're fighting a demon that's what you're fighting that's why you got to lay it down say you know i'm going to go to the house of lord whether it burns my head or not because god knows what i need amen remember we're in lady osea people write they think they have it all but what they don't have is the spirit of god amen i believe that people need a real good holy dose of feeling i need to be born again hey i told my church back home we everybody was born again in the church here we didn't have to preach certain things amen that one's for free ask for free i always say that you should take the offering after the pastor preaches because they maybe wouldn't get as much i don't know that's for free too can you take it it's been given to each one of us but we have to pull our sword what good is a sword in the sheath what good is a sword in the sheath could you imagine uh with uh the men in the bible when they went to meet someone they pulled the sword and they weren't dainty about it either they pulled the sword they they had an objective joshua he pulled he saw that man by he pulled the sword and the first words out of his mouth were are you for us or against us in other words if you're against us you're going to have a problem right now because i'm not here to be dainty about it i'm here to take action and literally yeah yeah in other words you breathe your last breath he had an objective he was actually moving the power underneath the power of god he was commissioned we've been commissioned amen i don't want to i don't want to be uh he's like brother ron has that sign i like that sign it's not the size and the fight of the dog but help me jesus but it's the size the size of the fight in the dog that matters it's not how big we are but it's how much fight do you have inside of you i'm in a battle you're in a battle after covet has been a big battle what good an offense the weapon is if you don't unsheath it we've heard these words before if you don't kill your enemy your enemy will kill you he'll drive he'll drive the very life of christ out of your life oh he will take the quotes away he'll make sure you keep that to give you some sense of some sense of security but when you hear the word of god then you start to realize that you know what i've actually fallen back oh yeah i don't know who i'm preaching to tonight but i'm just preaching what's in my heart i say church this time that we pull our swords i honest i i i say this with all my heart i hope the next time we all meet is in glory that's the next time i want to meet i i'm tired of this whole life amen but i'm not going to just sit back and do nothing i'm going to keep fighting the good fight of faith amen some people say brother kell you fight i say every day i get up in the morning after a service and the devil tries to tell me everything i said wrong it's just a fight so you know what i do i get prepared for wednesday night and i go kill more devils because one day it's going to be the last one we're looking for that day i'm looking for that time i've got a son-in-law on the other side i've got grandparents on the other side i've got people that i love on the other side i'm looking forward to the day that i see them again so when i when i look at the word of god i say this word is for the bride brother brown i'm just not just not come just to preach and put it on a wall or on on something in your in your study room someplace but this word has to become alive we have to come to the place where we believe it and we allow the spirit of god to move in complete preeminence amen because the bible tells us to him that overcometh and i believe that we're overcomers here this evening hours amen that i'm going to grant to sit with me in my throne amen that throne means that he has a dominion and then that dominion is is from from eternity to eternity and the bride of jesus christ glory to god makes me happy when i think about it the bride of the lord jesus christ is the one to sit with him in his throne amen we're gonna we are mrs jesus christ on the earth we get to sit with him in his throat that makes me happy when i think about that for the grace of almighty god that's come by our way i say church let's take our positions let's fight the good fight of faith we got to do something he's given us what we have need of he said fight the battle don't sit back and yeah sure we get weary from time to time i'm here to lift up your hands tonight i'm here to remind you what god says that we have already made it you say then why are we fighting because until we get our body changed we gotta fight the devil's not dainty i'm not dating he don't love me and i don't love him we both have the same agreement we hate one another and i'm not about to make no pacts with him i ain't gonna do what israel did when they were supposed to con consume the whole land and they started making deals with the people in the land i'm not gonna do that became a snare unto them this bride will not do that i'm gonna talk very affirmative this bride will not do that this bride is going to make no agreements with the powers of darkness this bride has taken god's word and put it in her mouth and speaking the word in faith knowing that god will back up his own word because it's not my word it's not your word it's the king's word it's the king sword we have to take it believe it laid it in our heart when we pray we believe god answers prayer amen we have prayed when we pray for our loved ones we believe that god will send the holy ghost to them and he is sending the holy ghost to them and they're coming back into the kingdom of god and god rich in mercy hallelujah is embracing them the prodigals are coming home hallelujah glory to god god could not say and push us through a little pipe and pull us out the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh he had nothing to overcome nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make that decision for yourself i have to make it for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to god amen so we have something to do we're going to fight i'm not going to quit fighting no it don't matter what the enemy does i'm not going to quit fighting i'm determined to make it through the word overcometh in the greek and i maybe shared this years ago it means to carry off victory come on victorious of christ victorious over all his foes of christians that hold fast their faith even unto death against the power of their foes and temptations of persecutions when one is arraigned or goes to law to win the case maintain one's cause the power of their foes christ being the lamb of god that defeated and was victorious over all his foes gives us victory over all our foes amen we have victory over all of our foes i saw at the back of your church that and that you have that book hamgar there and shamkar is is one of my heroes in the bible a lot written about him just a little bit written about him but what was written about him is is really encouraging amen because he was just a plain guy he was just a farmer and you probably know this but as bears repeating the word shamgar means sword in the hebrew it means sword he's just a farmer and you know what the devil was trying to do he was trying to take away his daily bread try to take away from his spiritual walk take away from his prayer life take away from from reading the word i'll just give him just a little bit just to survive so next year we're going to come get some more but there came one year that he was he was fed up and the spirit of the lord would come down and brother brown said they were so poor their kids and rags they were in rag they couldn't hardly make a living and and i looked that up and an ox gourd is about eight foot long a big old thing it got a big point in one end and a big ball on the other end to chisel or to to bang off the the clay that would actually get on the plow as they were plowing it was it was something that they did back in those days it wasn't a conventional weapon it wasn't no sword but but yet it was something that he had in his hand and sometimes it just matters what's in your hand amen when the right point comes the enemy comes in the temptations are there it's what's in your hand that matters amen i trust it's the word of god that's within your hand amen the bible says thy word have i hid in my heart that i would not sin against you somebody say praise the lord amen i don't want to sin against him i want to keep myself clean before him all the time amen and so that last time shamgar he had enough of it he said in his own heart when they came up there again with uh 600 men he said that's it i don't care how many men are there i am not going to deal with this any longer and he took that aux cord and he killed 600 men i don't know how if you know how many 600 men it's a lot of men and they all had their armors on and they all had their swords shields and their swords they were men that were trained in the art of warfare but god don't need any men trained in the art of warfare what he needs is to get some person in the palm of his hand that will commit their heart to him that he can use them for his glory amen they will tear down the temple the the the kingdom of the devil amen and he had it in his heart i can just see that victory someday we get to meet shamgar i'm going to talk to sean mcgarry what happened and he's going to say the same thing he's going to ask us what happened to lady oseah we're going to say what was the power of the holy spirit that overshadowed me right at the right time and god gave me the fortitude to go forward and i just followed the word he's going to say the spirit of god came on me and i looked at those 600 philistines as dead men can you imagine 600 of them piled up at the end of his field the devil criticizes our worship maybe not here but sure do in canada i don't know why people have a problem with people getting happy in church i always tell i always tell the people what in the world is wrong with getting happy if i can't get happy in the house of god where in the world can i get happy amen i don't want to say this in the wrong way but but a lot of times we we get into our cars and that's when the devil comes and brings some real interesting things in the car on the way home from church it's anything but happy [Music] maybe if we got a little happier in church maybe maybe those things wouldn't happen i don't know amen because if our hearts were in tune with one another we would be able to realize oh this is a trap of the devil he gonna try to get us now on our way home but there's no way i'm going to get him on my way home i'm going to praise him right out of these windows right here if he wants to hang around and listen to me praise for a while i'm just going to keep praising amen why because you picked up that anointing in the house of the lord amen and god moved upon your heart amen glory i told the church back home i don't care how much our worship is criticized it will make no difference to me i'm going to worship the lord amen and i look like david of old you ain't seen nothing yet amen because i'm not going to have no barren church our church is going to have seed in our church it's going to be the seed of almighty god amen because i'm taking my position i'm going to pull my sword i'm going to fight the good fight of faith i'm going to destroy the enemy it's time to destroy him remember in the in the book of revelation i hope i'm not going too long in the book of revelation the bible talks about that the devil came down because we come up that means he had nobody to work on anymore we caught the vision and we caught the vision we realized that god is the one fighting our battles for us victory's been given to us you know brother abraham he said he said dave that peter knew how to weld the sword went to the garden of gethsemane he could cut off a high priest's servant's ear he had a pretty good aim he wanted the neck but he got the ear and the lord said on him peter put up your sword which was a physical sword in other words peter from this day forward we're not going to have this battle fight between one another no more because it's going to be a spiritual warfare now we're just going to change the sword from physical metal to something that's that's my word and so when peter was filled with the holy ghost that changed his life when you're filled with the holy ghost it changes your life you're not the same person you used to be you've got somebody else running in the in the in the room over here i heard brother calvin preaches to the young people but bears repeating because it's such a good thought they made they have this this new mechanism that they can put into certain size ships it's called a gyro and what a gyro does is when it spins in the ship it brings balance and unity within the ship and so when the ship is in large really large waves it doesn't take the ship out of the waves but what it does is it gives stability in the waves because it starts to turn in there and the ship actually goes completely equilibrium i wrote on those things before those two wheels on it i don't know if that thing's going to fall over but it don't fall over you can actually stand on two wheels and nothing the gyro in there keeps the thing spinning right amen when you get the right thing in the heart which is the holy ghost which is your gyro it's gonna crest every wave it's gonna go through every wave it's going to do exactly what it has to do in your life amen why because the holy ghost controlling now the outcome of your life amen somebody's saying amen amen because god is in the right place it's no longer something that's just here but it's something that's dropped in has become your revelation within your heart that you realize who you are let's say i'm a son of god let's say i'm a daughter of god amen if we're sons and daughters of god then god is in control in acts chapter 3 we we read about peter and john when they went into the temple at the ninth hour to pray and there was a certain mouth from the mother's womb was carried and when they laid him at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms they entered into that exact gate but there was a different result now than what happened over here in the garden of gethsemane because something else now was inside of peter i'll tell you what was inside of peter it was the lord jesus in spirit form amen he was the one that was inside of peter amen and peter with all authority that god had given said said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give it unto you and he pulled the sword against the enemy and he said rise up and walk and that impotent man that was there had never walked in his life the bible said he got up and he started sleeping and jumping and going into the temple of god i brought this to my church back home i said can you imagine that man just sitting down as a bump on a pickle that's a direct quote by the way he said no he wouldn't set out down like that there was something that happened in his life and some thrill within his heart he had to praise the living god he never walked before but now he was walking what would happen when sons and daughters of god would get the holy ghost in their life and start their walk with god hallelujah you're going to move on to the power of god when the devil sees you he's going to get weary because of you because you tear him down pull your sword church fight the good fight of faith hallelujah [Applause] he received what he needed he got what he needed brother branham here the conflict between god is saying he said here's what it was that i passed it on just for a minute he said we are possessors of all things everything is ours they say that we're a crazy bunch you know but yet after all it belongs to us let me be crazy for a while well i serve my god amen he said we he said that's the reason we act a little funny you see we're heirs of all things i was thinking it's brother branham he said we possess love let's say love we possess joy let's say joy we possess courage let's say courage we possess faith let's say faith we possess long suffering let's we possess
