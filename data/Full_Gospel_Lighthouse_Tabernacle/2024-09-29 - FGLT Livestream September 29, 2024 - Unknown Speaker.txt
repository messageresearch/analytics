Coast that are that are suffering this morning and dealing with things that that they need help with so we just uh we just pray the Lord be ever mindful of them because many many homes don't have

on veiled the veiled Glory First Kings chapter 19 verse 9 and I'm going to be reading throughout in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 today and uh I where'll be grabbing most of our context and I'm going to just be bouncing back and forth there and um just to capture some things the Lord's been laying on our heart amen also if if you have that um picture of those notes from last weekend from brother brandham there if you wouldn't mind maybe having that ready just for us and when we get to it today amen let's just speak to the author of the word how many here has a need that you'd like to make known unto the Lord amen I don't know if you have a mountain in your way but I would take the the songs that we're sang this morning that mountains are moving in your life amen father we come before you today Lord we are eternally grateful father for the opportunities to be able to express how much you mean to us and to come into the house of God and to read of Thy word to recognize Lord Jesus that you have chosen Us in this hour to bring forth your word and to minister and to be a living testimony that you are still the same yesterday today and forever I pray God your blessings be upon your people Lord that those that have been in the turmoil of losing power and trees down and things of the flood of different Natures I pray that you would be God and you would be Lord over every situation father for every one of your believing children God we commit it to you and ask God your blessings now father we commit our life to you all that we are and all that we have we commit it into thy hands and we ask that the mercies of the Lord would be made new unto us today we dedicate our members over to you father may you be Lord in our mind Lord in our spirit Lord in our soul father Lord in our body we invite you Lord to be the owner of every thought father and that you would bring every thought captive to the mind of Christ that we would have your word in our mind and we would not have our mind but we would simply just put oursel into the word to be in line with the veil that you chosen in this hour so God we commit this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen First Kings chapter 19 and verse 9 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here Elijah and if you haven't listened to it for a little bit I admonish you to go and listen to the prophet speak on what doest thou hear Elijah and what hearest thou Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of host for the god or or for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant and thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets and with the sword and I even I I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and he said and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces and rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after after the fire a still small voice and it was so that when Elijah heard it I think it's amazing when you capture the attention of God's believing children that the effects of his coming did not it didn't capture his attention but what attracted him was the word the voice that captured the prophet's attention that when he Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou he Elijah also 2 Corinthians chapter 3 in verse one I believe today's your birthday happy birthday brother Dylan God bless you sometimes I get privy to knowledge then it just hits me all of a sudden so God bless you sometimes it looks like a squirrel on a on a hamster wheel up here in my brain so you don't want to go there sometimes so amen you love the Lord amen amen 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse one do we begin to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you you are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God and I want you to Major there on that thought that that that verse right there manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ written of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on the veiled Glory again we just just want to labor here on these thoughts drawing some things from the prophet's message a and here in the unveiling of God brother Brandon would say it like this he said you become a part of Christ as long as Christ is hid in you he said it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he is in you ain't that powerful it is veiled to the unbeliever but you know he is in you you are templ Christ that's behind the veil the skin then be be because behind because of this Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever as it is written written you are written Epistles the Bible said that what is an epistle it is a written word and you are the written other words you read it like this you it said you are written Epistles or you are the word that has been written made manifest that nothing can be added to it you can't say I'm a written epistle and living some other kind of a something but what this has already wrote because nothing can be added to it or nothing can be taken away and to recognize that we are a predestinated people that are here to fulfill the promise of the hour that to to to literally be the physical manifestation of the Holy written word that you are the written Epistles you are here to manifest what God has in his mind what he has deposited for this generation that we're in God has got a people that are going to manifest his glory and we recognize in every every single age that God has hid himself in some form or another that God has veiled himself veiled behind a form of humanity or in the way of the spiritual that we read throughout the Bible and I won't go through all of them but God veiled himself in many forms in the form of the pillar of fire he veiled himself he veiled himself in the cloud uh uh by day he veiled himself in the Whirlwind when he was speaking to job he he veiled himself in a wheel in the middle of a wheel when he was speaking to Ezekiel he was he veiled himself in a voice when Elijah was there in a cave he veiled himself behind the Badgers of skin when he was dwelling in the Tabernacle of the Wilderness and he veils himself in the form of His prophets and we recognize that by the Bible and being Bible Believers that God has always used that form to Veil himself behind that when we did not see God In the Flesh or when we did not see God in the spiritual by the pillar of fire or by the cloud or by a whirlwind we could see him in the prophetic word for the dispensation that we are in or that the people of God were in now in the in the message the trial and I'm just going to lay some things before we get into into the meat of the subject here today in the trial the prophet said he said in the Sodom age what happened to Abraham he said he would return back again to Abraham's Royal seat which is in Christ Christ returning in the form of the word notice Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings and showing the signs that he promised that it would sign it would do he promis promised that he would do it God promised it and God will keep his promise do you believe that today that God will keep his promise and we recognize that when when Moses was there and he was up there on the mountain that that there that we recognize that God was speaking directly to Moses he was giving him the understanding to be back be able to go back and to preach or to deliver the message that God had spoke directly unto him and it was the pillar of fire that was there that was that was identified with Moses and that pillar fire was not was not ashamed to be identified with Moses but the pillar of fire was literally writing out the word of God and William brandham said it in on the unveiling of God he said it is that same pillar fire that is interpreting the word in this hour it's that same pillar fire that is interpreting that word so let me just let me just bring you to where we are that you are the interpretation of the word of this hour that no matter how much Satan wants to fight against you that that you are identified in the word of God for this age and for this hour where the sh of Glory has come down and Revelation lays right there you are under that same pillar ofier you are here and you are the interpretation of what the word has been spoken just like it was identifying the message up there on Mount SII that same Pillar of Fire is here and identifying that the message is still the the same and that God is still the same and his power is still the same and he's not changing so if there is a God in this generation then there's got to be somebody that will be a written epistle that is going to be a manifestation of what God has seen so the bride is the word interpreted so the bride is the veil that God is going to work behind he is working behind your flesh Hallelujah in the identified Christ of all ages the prophet said now notice now God Jesus said that those who the word came to was called Gods he said that was they that was prophets now not the man himself was God no more than the body of Jesus Christ was God he was a man and God was veiled behind him and he said God has always veiled himself from the public and revealed himself to the people who will believe it it's amazing when you try to witness the power of Jesus Christ and you are the literally you are the physical manifestation of the word but they can't see it but you are where God is dwelling at he is he's revealing himself to the people who will believe it he said he said there in last Sunday he said I preached on the unveiling of God he said God has always veiled himself behind something so that the people of the outside world would know nothing about him but he reveals himself to his children and to those who are willing to come in behind that Veil again he would say he said now what is it he said when a man breaks through that Veil into the sh Glory now the world calls him a fanatic they can't see what's wrong but behind there but behind there there is no beauty of him you see when you begin to break into that realm to begin to recognize that this is the veil that God is wanting to live in and dwell in that he's not just wanting to live in in tables of stone and he's not just wanting to live behind the Whirlwind he's not just wanting to live behind the wheel of the middle of wheel he doesn't want to be a rock that was heed but he wants to Veil himself in the Tabernacle of humanity that has chosen in this hour that God has exposed himself to you God has revealed himself to you ah blessed be the name of the Lord now if you could just throw that that that picture of that quotation this is a quote as we mentioned to you last weekend from a collection of brother brandom's handwritten notes and sermon notes which was on the which is on display there in in brandham t or Memorial Library there in Tucson Arizona and he titled this set of notes he titled it the glory of the Lord he he titled it the glory of the Lord he said now notice he's he's drawing this from First Kings chapter 19 he said notice him Elijah in the cave he said the one that storm the P Billy Graham the Earth shaking campaigns or Roberts the Pentecostal rushing wind never moved the prophets he said never moved the prophet he said they were only effects of his passing by he said but what attracted the Prophet Elijah it was the glory of his voice the word revealing his glory plans the prophet waited on his office he said notice as a type that not long then to the Rapture he was only near in the Wind earthquake fire Etc he said the man of God waited notice he waited for the manifested reality Vindicated word abiding Glory not long then to the Rapture and you look at this world that we are living in right now you you look at the storms that we just came through you look at the earthquakes that are taking place in California this Earth is groaning this Earth is calling for the manifestation of the sons of God to recognize that the prophet was are waiting on the manifested reality so don't get your eyes on the earthquakes don't get your eyes on the winds don't get your eyes on the Storm wait on the manifested reality I am not shook up about the LGBT qz I'm not shook up about what Biden's doing and what what what Harris is doing and what Trump is doing I am concerned with one thing and one thing only what the manifested reality of what God has dispersed in this generation this is where God is at come on somebody don't get your eyes on the earthquakes because there's a lot of times when the spirit of God will come through here and there's an earthquak and shaking kind of time and those times those emotional times will leave you come on I'm going to preach to you this morning so your amen are well qualified to get in line with the message there are going to be times when you feel the emotions of the spirit of God and there's going to be times when you don't see the wind but he's still there there are going to be times when you feel the influence of it but what I want you to catch is the voice the manifestation of what was in the earthquake and what was in the Earth or in the Fire come on somebody because you are going to come here at some point in your life and your emotions are not going to run the same way that they did last weekend your emotions are not going to go off the extreme and push you into past your own Veil sometimes but just because you don't have a shouting meeting and just because you don't have one of those events where the spirit of God manifest himself does not change the glory that's behind the voice Allelujah what did this what did this voice cause here here is here's Elijah I want you to and brother Ron just did a a powerful job last weekend under the juniper tree but find it amazing that he just led us this way but you look at what that voice calls because if it doesn't create a reaction on the inside of you then the voice was meaningless but if the voice it causes a reaction on the inside of his believing children then there's got to be a Powerhouse behind that voice you you see what what happened up there with Hatty R there was power behind that voice what happened up there in Cor in Colorado Mountain there was power behind that voice what happened here what's happened in your life what's happened in your testimony there's a power that's behind the voice though you don't see the voice the power is still there amen thank you Lord it set Elijah on a course because just to just to bring to your reference to your mind you you look over in First Kings chapter 18 and it's a showdown between Jehovah and baale and here Elijah makes fun of them because ba ain't showing up but when Elijah begins to restore the ministry back to his right position he he restores true worship back and he cast down the idols of B and he stands there and he he gets everything back in order he's got blood back on the sacrifice he gets he gets 12 barrels of rain that when the we that you look at that right there it's supernatural he's got 12 barrels of water that he's living in an age wor three and a half years there ain't been no rain but he's standing right here and a supernatural Prophet produces Supernatural water it said pour it all over this sacrifice and if God be God let him show up and burn up this sacrifice you can pour water all you want to on this message and it'll still produce that God is the god of Elijah I'll tell you what this message will produce if you try to water it down with some kind of gospel or some kind of creed or some kind of idea Elijah's ministry will restore it back to its right place and the prophet will call down fire from heaven Hallelujah here he goes he immediately goes from there and there he is he's on a high point and he's got himself in such a weakened condition that he that he sends his his his helper Gesa he sends him up there he don't even have enough strength Elijah had got himself so wore out in his ministry that he did not even have the ability to climb upon the mountain and see and see if it was going to rain but he's already told King Ahab get ready get your rain barrels ready it's about to rain I hear the abundance of the sound of rain are coming and immediately he goes and he lays himself down on the mountain sends gazes up there said do you see anything yet he said there ain't a sign of it nowhere he said go again go again go again he said but this time I see a cloud like a man's hand and it puts some kind of Supernatural strength on the inside of a elah that he ran 17 miles with a renewed strength with a renewed Spirit that's what the Holy Ghost does to a born again son and daughter of God you may have been weak from the battle you may have been weak from fasting and praying but all of a sudden it's a refreshing from the Lord and Elijah immediately goes suicidal just read First Kings chapter 19 he goes suicidal said God he was so upset that people were rejecting the message you can see why William brandham is standing here in this generation and he gets so upset he don't want to do anything with people no more he don't want to have nothing to do with him they are rejecting the greatest thing and William brandham knew that they were rejecting not him they rejecting Christ and Elijah is is so upset he's wore out from preaching and showing that God is still God and Jezebel has got all of Israel in a Frizzle and they're worked up because of her painted face religion down there that he finds himself under of a juniper tree God feeds him and gives him Supernatural rest and the very next stage of this of this chapter he's there in a cave and he hears a voice maybe you've been in a cave but I going to tell you what's getting ready to come out of your ministry is going to be one of the greatest things that's ever happened because you can see you can put this you can put this message on the inside of you you can put this power on the inside of you but we don't want to just keep it for ourself we want to do God's got plans God's got Glory plans he wasn't just going to keep the prophet's Ministry in Elijah he was going to turn his face toward elij he was going to anoint J he was going to anoint Heil he's got plans but what attracted him it was the voice the glory of his voice now notice First Kings 19-1 15 and I I pray you I pray you just stick with me just for a minute and the Lord said unto him go and return on thy way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint hazil to be king over Syria and juu the son of nimi Shout thou anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of shafat of aimo shalt thou anoint to be the prophet in myy room and it shall come to pass that him that escape escape with the sword of ail shall Jus slay and him that escape the sword of ju shall Elisha slay yet I have left me 7,000 down there in Israel all the knees which have not bowed under baale and every mouth which hath not kissed him here Elijah goes from being suicidal he goes from underneath a juniper tree he goes into a cave and all of a sudden God's got plans for his life he tells him you're not alone you're not in this battle alone you're not believing this message alone but there's 7,000 that was up there on that mountain with you that was worshiping the only true and living God they are there we you don't see nobody else there's still a glory behind the veil that you can't see don't get disappointed at what you see don't get disappointed because of the distractions that are going on God's got a plan together so God anoints God anoints these ministers to be God's Vengeance on Earth that ju and Hil were going to slay with a sword and Elisha was going to slay as well but he was going to do it in a different different way he was going to slay with the word of a king and he went out there notice what he did when Elijah comes the when Elijah comes to Elisha he sees Elisha out there plowing and he's got 12 oxen he's got a team of them out there together he's a mighty man of wealth he's a mighty man of wealth he's he's plowing straight and there was something about the way Elisha was the way he was plowing was to recognize that that was Elisha before he knew what his name was he knew that he was a straight shooter right there and Elisha said let me go back when the man who got threw over on him he said let me go back and kiss my mother and my father goodbye and Elijah I was always amazed at that that Elijah let him go back he let him go back and kiss his past goodbye he took up the best he had he didn't just have the best auction he had the best tools he was a mighty man of wealth and he stood right there and he took all that he had he took his toes he took his memory he took his affections he took his past he took his conscience and he put it on a fire and he kissed his pass goodbye and he sold out to be in full-time Ministry and immediately he goes into the work because he's elected to carry out a message brother bam said it was a sign to the world that he cut every Shoreline loose right there god brother Homer said it like this that God sometimes get it in a killing mood that's right you ever heard him say that sometimes God gets in a killing mood because they had turned down the message and they started going down there and they started following underneath of Jezebel's religion and painting their up and bringing idol worship down there bringing it down there brother random said to you he said it in Jezebel religion he he said you don't paint yourself up to meet God you paint yourself up to meet a man he said there he went and anointed J now here it is in First Kings chapter 19 and you don't see J and Hil start showing up in the ministry until 2 Kings 9 and chapter 10 there is a delay sometimes in how we want God to work and you might think that you have sinned and got by with it but God will get to you he will get to you Ahab he will get to you Jezebel and he anointed ju to go down there and ju stood there and was anointed as a king to go down there and had Unix to kick Jezebel off the Tower and the dogs licked up her blood well I know it's going to get tough for a minute but help me preach what did J who do he fully fell under the anointing of Elijah and turned a woman right into dog meat that's what William brandham said he said that's who you are is dog meat if you call yourself filled with the Holy Ghost and paint yourself up like Jezebel he didn't call women a je he didn't call women dog meat he called people that called them themselves Holy Ghost Bible Believers filled with the spirit of God that paint themsel up and think they're a Christian he called them dog meat well don't preach it too straight the prophet said if you don't preach this and you don't preach clothline religion then you're not preaching the message but what I'm not trying to get your mind there but what I'm trying to get your mind on is that prophecy has got to be fulfilled because it had been prophesied by the Prophet Elijah that he was going to slay Ahab and all of his family and J brought violence to all of King zab's house God got in a killing mood and he went down there and he didn't just kill Ahab and he didn't just kill Jezebel but he killed all the influence of Ahab because juu was anointed to destroy not only the the family heritage of Ahab but he was anointed to tear down and cast down every Idol it was all under the ministry of Elijah and benad did the king of Syria at the time he had fell sick and he went down there he was wanting to ask the prophet Elisha if he was going to ever recover from this recover from his illness and Elisha answered him said no Hil is the one that is Anointed to be king So ail was to destroy those that came out to war and J's family or or and J ahab's family that didn't come out so Hil and J were anointed to destroy I'm not here to kill you this morning I'm here to show you that there's Glory behind this there might be people that get upset at Elijah's Ministry but there's some Glory behind this are you with me ju ju was going to slay Ahab and AIA was going to slay them but it did not stop there Elisha was standing there one day and there were some people that had mocked the message and had mocked the ministry and there were some people that still worship that that bail God down there living in bethl and they come down there and they started making fun of Elisha and making fun of him and calling him old Baldi and he called he called out some she Bears out of the mountains and killed 42 children that was mocking the message mocking the ministry trying to stop it Hallelujah you might be in a cave you might be in despair but wait for his glory you might think you're all alone you might see only you might only see Jezebel turning down the message but there's going to be some re bu be some real Believers that believe what you say that say Amen to what the tape say that believe what a prophet said what did God do he veiled himself and predestinated sons of God that was going to carry out his plans he got all of that while waiting in a cave don't you worry Elijah Don't You Worry Elijah I'm going to do I'm going to do what I said would do I would do so ju was anointed to destroy and he put a sword in his hand to throw down every Idol and every V baale worshipper in every hybrid religion I love what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 10:4 y'all breathe y'all breathe okay y'all breathe I'm coming to you I'm coming to you I ain't come here to slay you I'm coming here to tell you that God is going to take vengeance upon your enemies it ain't people it's a spirit that God's taking Vengeance on that's what God is after he said for the weapons of our Ware are not cornal but Mighty through the through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is ful F fi yes Lord the prophet said in the spoken word he said Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid devil he said is that right he was done he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same because the body is aead and the body is together and if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same as his head was right a church of the Lord a church of the word born to be born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational but a virgin born from the word of God the way the body operates is by the head so when you see something come into your life you do the same thing that Christ did he was born to destroy the works of every hybrid devil of every Creed of every sadducee devil yeah of every Pharisee devil that brought itself and exalted itself against the message that he was bringing so God's going to Veil himself in you yes Lord to cast down imaginations to overcome inlay osia to overcome lukewarmness don't forget what you're fighting here don't forget what you're fighting here it's a spirit on an age that's trying to make you cold it's trying to make you lukewarm it's trying to put you in a naked position but don't you forget that you have been anointed you have been anointed to stand against the coldness of leosia against the lukewarmness of Leota against everything you have been anointed that you are the veil that God is gloring himself in you say well I'm not much brother Andrew and I ain't got much to my name I ain't got wisdom I ain't got intellects I ain't got understanding Paul said in 1 Corinthians 1:27 but God ha chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and God have chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay and the things which are not to bring to not the things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence you and I have no right to glory in our flesh but of him are you in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption you're not worthy but he is you are not able you don't have the mindset like the rest of the world Lord but God chose the foolish things the things that were despised the things that were ready what right does a Peter have preaching after cussing after he saw Jesus hung but he is our wisdom our righteousness our sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord this ain't Homer phasers Church come on this ain't Ron Spencer's church this ain't my church or William or Matthew or any other preacher this ain't our church this is God's Church the reason why there's a church on this hill is because God wanted to Glory himself in a veil that would not back up that would believe he's still the same yesterday today and forever when the rest of the world doesn't want to identify with a message there is a the church we're not gloring in William brandham but we are gloring in the Lord if you can ever find out who you're worshiping it's not a man it's not a dead man it's not a man locked up in a tomb it's not a man that's still that's still fighting your battles he's still there's blood on a throne for you you're worshiping the Lord of hosts the king that is Mighty in pattle and if you don't believe it God will make a fool of your enemies amen come on somebody you watch on Rapture morning God is going to make a fool out of everybody that mocked this message I'm trying not to go there but you watch you watch what happened with Pharaoh you watch what happened with Pharaoh Pharaoh stood there in Exodus chapter 5 and said Pharaoh said who is the Lord that I should obey his voice to let Israel go I know not the Lord neither will I let Israel go Pharaoh didn't know but he was about to leosa may not know the Lord but they're about to God is going to make a full of your enemies ignorance he can stand there and see the supernatural over and over and over again and he said I don't know the Lord in that power I don't know the Lord in that I don't know the Lord that they know but you Le ought to see is about to know I love what the Bible said in Exodus 9:16 and in the very deed for this cause have I raised you up pharaoh to show in thee my power you know he's got to feel like an idiot I'm the big shot down here in Egypt oh yeah nothing happens unless he comes through me I got I got everything in power I got everything in control I control the slaves I control the water coming in through the Nile I got it all in control and God says hey Buster hey Buster I raised you up for my purpose so I could show my power through your stupidity and that my name not Pharaoh's name not Moses's name not Aaron's name but my name may be declared throughout all of e of the Earth come on somebody he may have raised up a Martin Luther King Jr in this day he may have raised up a a a a JFK in this day but he didn't he didn't just raise him up he raised up a bride in this day there's enemies in this day but there's a p there's a Powerhouse there's a body that does not move without the word of the Lord and the Egypt's going to do what it's going to do n here is going to do what they're going to do but as for Israel we are identified with the name of all of Heaven Amen in the trial the prophet said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed healed in the form of the son of man I challenge you there's a prophet's challenge I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the s in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body I challenge you to believe it I challenge you to believe that God can be manifested in you sister Emily I challenge you to believe it yeah I challenge you to believe this that the son of man is being revealed in Sister Carly Frasier I challenge you to believe this that God is being revealed in brother VJ Fraser I challenge you to believe this I challenge you to believe this that God is being he is revealing himself in the form of the son of man through brother Timothy baton I challenge you William brandom stood there all alone all alone when the rest of the world said there's nothing to this Divine Healing they told told him he was just a little bitt on nothing just like he told David he was a little bitt old rut he was a little bitt on nothing what are you doing down here but William brandham said I know what this slingshot of Faith Can Do I've seen what it did for a congressman Upshaw so I know what it'll do that's why David didn't take some ecclesiastical vest he didn't take Saul's armor but he took in what he knew he said this killed go he said this killed a bear this killed a lion I put this to work that's what William brandham said I accepted a challenge to to preach Divine Healing to a world that didn't want it yeah amen I challenge you now the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 3 if y'all don't know this I have preached three sermons to you already I'm giving them to you in stages you may have been in a cave you may have come underneath a juniper tree and you just had some of the best cornbread you ever ate in your life hallelujah amen but you've been in the cave you've heard a voice now you're anointing people and now you're the veil that God is using and the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 3 and 6 who also hath made us able that word able means to qualify Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but of the but the spirit gives life but if the ministation of death the law written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away Christ didn't come to put it away he come to magnify the law which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit rather be glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious has no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelth for if that which was done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious amen so if it was that glorious that Moses had to Veil himself to the children of Israel because his face Shone with the glory of the Lord that he had to Veil himself they didn't want to hear from God so God veiled himself in a prophet so he spoke his law through a prophet's lips and Paul is saying if that was glorious how much more when the Holy Ghost wasn't given then but now it is given you see he rote on Stone then but that stone couldn't live that stone couldn't praise that stone couldn't shout that stone couldn't amen but now he's got a body now he has wrote it on the tables of your heart and it's got life it's got power it's got manifestation God didn't want to just Veil Veil himself behind bads or skins and a whirlwind and a pillar of fire but God wants your tent God wants your tent and you might think you're on the verge of giving up you might be in a pit of dis spare when nobody else I'm very careful with this I don't ever let this word loose but I'm going to let it Loose today because I feel it you might be in a spot where you think you all the best thing in your life is to take your life Hallelujah but God does hallelujah you're not alone God loves you God gave his life for you he died on a cross for you don't let that devil lie to you and tell you you're not worth it don't let that devil tell you you don't have a life worth the Holy Ghost I come in the name of Jesus Christ to rebuke a devil that would steal a young person's life I come in the name of Israel May that demon be mocked Hallelujah God don't want just tables of stone he don't want just the Ark of a covenant he don't want just a rod he don't want just man in a pot he wants your tent he wants your Veil where's the third pole at brother brand brother Brandon where's it at where's it that brother random is it in a tent yes it is this tent this tent don't worry about some structure don't worry about some tent coming in the natural this tent this power this fail this Glory there's your tent Ministry Satan I come against you in the name of Jesus Christ you have no power against the tent of the third [Applause] pole God want you worst than you want him thank I sat down a couple weeks ago with brother Benjamin King he's not here I I specifically asked this question and I believe I've got authority to say this here but as you can see there is a move in the Amish community that God set this up because God had a elected people down in there he had elected genan seeds of God that were down there hiding hiding hiding you want to find where God wants to hide at he wants to hide in you brother Melvin he wants to he wants to hide in you he wants to hide in every one of you but religion had held these people back but when they got a taste to the message let me tell you something you ever get a taste of this message I'm in a good dose of this message I ain't just talking about some feeling I ain't just talking about some intellectual thing that somebody told you about the message and what William brandham did but I'm talking about a taste of the Holy Ghost and what this message is is Jesus Christ you can't walk away from this message you can't walk away from this [Music] [Applause] power and I I was talking to a brother and basically basically how how how I understand this has been transpiring is that there's a brother brother Matt Morris and some other brothers that have been working and having telephone hookups and they have been working with the amus community and been been just basically taking this phone call and preaching preaching the message over over the just basically just going over some fundamental things in the message and people started listen to William brand they started listening to the message they got it they got it through different forms and got it different I don't care how you get the message as long as you get the message is that right a prostitute can testify about this message a drug addict can testify about this message so God can use every form every form because how are them formed how was the internet created what was it created it wasn't created for the devil it was created to bring forth a message now men have corrupted every form of it is but the real form of what every every scientific thing is to bring the message out that ain't a pet Doctrine that's just that's just how it is and and people were grabbing the message and you can go and ask you can go ask them and I had heard heard this so I asked brother Benjamin and it it's it's a family member that is connected to them and the kids were about 18 19 years old and they had been listening to the message they' been listening to the message but the parents wouldn't listen to it didn't want anything to do with it but the kids were were of age and they was listen to the message and and and and on their home place the kids were inside the house and they were they were listening to the message and the Daddy was over this way maybe 100 yards in a shop that way and the mother and everybody else was over this way and while they were listening to the prophet on the inside of that house all of a sudden William brandom said come out of her my people and be you separate amen he said that on that tape and you know how loud your phone is you can't hardly hear it if somebody's talking in the background but these these brothers and sisters were out there 100 yards away 50 yards away and they heard a prophet's voice say come out of her my people and they came to the message they come in there say what was that where did that come from where did that voice come from said Mama daddy that's some tapes we've been listening to and they all heard William brandom's voice a 100 yards away now tell me if God is for you and God sees you then God will call you when nobody else wants to hear it because he's still still got plans he still got Glory plans behind his voice William Brad May went to a grave they may have tried to shut him up but his voice still resounds and it's still calling out a people what got you here what caused your attraction what brought you to this situation Moses Moses what got you here the last thing they remember about you is a murderer I love what the prophet said and if you want the message I'm just going to preach it but if you want the message I'll give it to you after church but William Brandon said this about Moses he said Moses he said I'm going to glorify you in the midst of them and he said I'm going to prove I'm going to prove to you that you didn't lie to them in telling them that you met me but I'm going going to prove I'm going to prove I'm going to prove that what I said to you up there in that Pillar of Fire is nothing but the truth God was veiled in Jesus Christ the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory and the prophet said that if God is in you then God is still in flesh he's still in your flesh is he he's still he's still working don't you give up you may have seen him in the miracle of your son you may have seen him in the miracle of your daughter but he's still working he's in your flesh if you got him in you he's still in flesh I don't care how how you masas get so tormented sometimes with your children and you're trying to work with them trying to get them to obey you you're trying to teach them the right things don't you worry if God is in you then God is still in flesh you might be new to homeschooling you might be new to this you might be to a new job but if God is in you God is still in flesh sermon number four Elohim I want your flesh he don't want to just prove that he was God versus baale 4,000 years years ago he wants to take your flesh amen and he wants to prove that he is Elohim in flesh that in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters how many is a son and daughter your sons and daughters shall see shall see visions and have dreams and have the supernatural amongst them God's Vision was not just for himself to dwell in a tent by the name of Jesus he wants your tent he wants your Tabernacle he wants to Veil himself on the inside of every little house housewife of every little janitor of every every man of God every woman of God deity he's showing himself that he's alive that he's here because the Bible said in Ezekiel 36 you want to know what the message is here's a message Ezekiel 36:26 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will will give you the heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you Ezekiel 3627 and I will put I Elohim the self-existing one I will put my spirit oh yes what did William Brandon preach to you he's the same yesterday today and forever how do you get in this body for by one Spirit we are baptized into this body that word put means to entrust it means to give up it means to deliver it means to yield it means to produce that's why Jesus said if my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I will put my spirit in you that word put is the same word that Jesus uses over Matthew chapter nine when he's standing there and said no man entrust an old garment no man puts an old garment a new garment or old garment and no man entrust no man entrust old bottles with new wine no man puts new wine new revelation new stimulation in some dried up cow hide you might put water on the inside of that thing but water is what remaineth after ashes and hydrogen it ain't got no life in it but if you've got wine you got life you got power that's why the message had to make you new he had to rid you part five part five he had to rid you of every doctrine that you came out of that's why the message said come out of her my people and be ye separate come on somebody he could not put this message the wine of stimulation by Revelation he could not put that down there in the Church of Christ in the Church of God in the Assemblies of God in the brethren in the methodists in the men in the menite or the Amish he had to put it in new bottles new powerhouses that could handle it because wine has got life in it it's got to move I feel like a Pentecostal up here you put this on the inside of some dried up CDE it'll bust it'll say it's nothing add ain't nothing to that but you put it on a new bottle that's been made a new in Christ Jesus it can handle the power it can handle the rejoicing it can handle the shouting it can handle the speaking in tongues it can handle the dancing it can handle it it's built to take it God entrusted you with the greatest message for if that was done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious all I see is me all I see is my mistakes all I sees my failures God was going to take a Moses God was going to take a Paul God was going to take a William brandom and he was going to Veil his glory behind it that he can manifest his power you well I I don't feel like I I don't feel like I have the ability to witness and maybe sometimes you don't even know sometimes you don't even know sometimes it's just awkward now you're going to be honest with yourself sometimes it's awkward to tell that you believe in a last day Prophet I ain't ashamed but sometimes it's awkward I'll just be dead honest with you you you try to stand in my in my in my shoe sometimes when you're talking to trinitarians how did you get this knowledge well if it wasn't for a prophet I wouldn't have this knowledge and now I made it awkward for them yeah wait a minute well you believe a Bible don't you you believe in Malachi 4 don't you well sure I do well then you're you you should be expecting that there's got to come four and five elijas in this generation and now you put it back on them but sometimes you're just LED down the road and you don't know what in the world why am I even doing this I was woke up about 2:38 this morning and I had a brother on my mind up all the way on the other side of the West Coast and this brother one day he was was he was uh he was just driving home from work and he he he's a real go-getter and he works real late but something something told him she to leave work early leave work early this morning leave work early here and go down this road and he said I don't I don't typically do that but he left work and and the spirit of God said turn down this road and he I don't ever go why would I even go down that road and he goes down this road and the spirit of God tells him turn down this road and all of a sudden he he says the spirit of God tells him go in this go in this health store and he goes in this health store and he hears a man standing there and he starts talking about the problems that he's in here we are he starts talking about the problems that he's in he start talking about he come to a spot where he didn't know how much more he could take of of pain of of life and all these things and all of a sudden this man recognizes why he's here why he's been LED here you may not be ever called behind the pull pit but maybe God wants to use you to drive down this road and drive down that road because he's got a brother or sister or maybe he's got some Sons out there that don't know him just yet so he's going to use you he's going to Veil himself on the inside of you so that he could witness the power of Jesus Christ and there brother Dave walner was is a very powerful witness he begin to testify to him that that God did not give you the spirit of fear and the spirit and the spirit of this world but he give you the spirit of love and power and a sound mind and that man came and gave his heart to the Lord and's been at church the last I heard him so God can take a man that doesn't look like a preacher doesn't act like a preacher but make him a witness that the message still works am if God if God wakes you up he's he's dealing with you you know sometimes you just wake up on your own but then there's those times when there Spirit of God's dealing with you and typically it's between the hours of 3 and 5: brother Brandon would say it like this that's when demons go to rest so God can start dealing with your subconscious a few years ago at sister Karen pu's funeral memorial service brother Jason Jackson had had went to the the the after the after the Memorial they were all there brother Tim's house and they just started testing about the goodness of God and all of a sudden brother Jason the spirit of God began to work on him and he I I believe brother Jason even told this here but he he he told that the spirit of God began to work on him he he said I literally thought I was beginning to speak in tongues I thought I was going to speak in tongues and he said he said I shut my mouth and walked outside and he said then I realized maybe that was for somebody here or something like that so he began to tell he began to tell brother Timothy about it and he he took him through the whole story brother Ron came down at that time so they started talking about the Miracles and all these things things and sister Esther had had dealt with barrenness for so long and she had a very very hard miscarriage and and it been very heavy on her and all of a sudden the spirit of God began to speak begin to speak to them here sister Karen goes beyond the veil of tears and Beyond the curtain of time and all of a sudden the spirit of God began to speak to them said you think they may she may have been shaking this one's hand but she was shaking the ones of those grandchildren of miscarriages that had went there they were some of the very first hands they were shaken am you think well could God use me like that God wants to use anybody he can yes Lord if he's in you he's still God in flesh because when Moses went up here part six and Moses went up there part six a real short one Moses went up there all of a sudden he got the same characteristics that Jehovah had because brother brandom said it like this that the pillar of fire went off that bush and went into Moses and went into Moses it went into Moses and Moses went down there with the same creative power of the characteristics of Jehovah because no man's words will act like that no man's words can create no man's can speak flies and frogs and lice and and kill cattle and turn blood water into blood but the same characteristics that was on the inside of Jehovah was now made manifest on the inside of Moses what was it the same power that same Pillar of Fire that came off that bush that went into Moses was the same Pillar of Fire that went into Paul that same Pillar of Fire that went into Paul went into William Bram that same message that William Brandon preached has now come into a body that believes the supernatural that will produce that will speak William brandham said it in in the word the letter to the church he said this bride has thus sayith the Lord or she stands still the part Seven's my favorite because now he's got you in flesh he's got a man by the name of William brandom he starts working through working through him said I see a great dignitary back there I see a great dignitary back here he's been he's been injured in an accident in a farming accident and he's laid as an invalet state for 66 years I see you as standing at some great Statesman or whatnot and he recognizes that it's Congressman Upshaw that is standing there and he says congressman and Congressman UPS was in a in a brown shirt or a brown suit he said Congressman he said do you have a blue suit he said sunny I just bought it yesterday he said well thus sayith the Lord he said you're going to be healed he said I saw you walking down the road in that blue suit he only lived a year and a half after his healing but he lived completely free and testified to Kings and potentates and that's how the message got to England Hallelujah you never know what your healing will do you never know what your touch will do you never know what the voice of God will do

your head and you wasn't ashamed about the cars that was passing by you but he was there maybe you met him right there maybe you met him when somebody did a good deed to you and you recognize well I thought I was alling on this battle somebody loved you and you recognized him right there maybe you recognized him when the bill came in and he didn't have no money left but he was still your meal in your barrel and when you take him at his word he'll prove he's a God that can work through a widow woman he's a God that can work through a prophet he's can he's a God that can work through a little
