[19:26] just god will work in a mighty way
[19:30] i just want to take a little bit of time
[19:32] here
[19:33] we want to be remembering our pastor
[19:36] brother ron spencer
[19:38] this this past week had a little bit of
[19:40] rough week if
[19:42] if some of you heard he
[19:46] after the meetings there he was a little
[19:48] weak had cough
[19:51] monday morning we went
[19:53] or not monday but tuesday i believe it
[19:55] was
[19:56] we went for a breakfast and
[19:59] i could tell something wasn't right
[20:01] and
[20:03] he was scheduled to have some scans and
[20:05] things done that day
[20:07] and i told him i said dad
[20:09] dad what's your oxygen level today you
[20:10] just don't
[20:11] send me right had a bad cough
[20:14] you know someone might have heard it
[20:16] his oxygen level had been low
[20:19] and before we had went to eat there
[20:22] his sugar started to drop on him a
[20:23] little bit
[20:25] so we sat down to eat
[20:27] his
[20:28] oxygen level dropped his blood pressure
[20:31] dropped
[20:32] and his sugar dropped all at the same
[20:34] time
[20:35] and
[20:36] for some of the nurses that are in the
[20:38] building all you know that that is not a
[20:40] good combination
[20:41] at all
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] let me just say that it was a scary
[20:48] situation
[20:49] [Music]
[20:52] the hand of the lord was with dad that
[20:54] he made it through that
[20:57] so
[20:58] we pray that god will just touch his
[21:00] body the
[21:02] ambulance had to come
[21:04] take him to the hospital
[21:06] he did not have to stay in the hospital
[21:08] so we thank the lord for that
[21:09] there have been some notes sent out that
[21:11] he was in the hospital and
[21:14] he was about to die
[21:15] in the hospital but
[21:17] he didn't about die in the hospital
[21:19] he was coming close there at the
[21:21] restaurant so
[21:22] but
[21:24] he has pneumonia in his lungs
[21:26] and he has a collapsed lung
[21:28] so on top of everything else that he's
[21:30] going through
[21:32] he battled through that this week and uh
[21:35] so we they were not able to do scans
[21:39] but they will be doing those at a later
[21:40] time so we're praying that god would
[21:42] just touch his body
[21:44] in a mighty way
[21:46] me and the family will be
[21:49] protecting them even more so and being
[21:52] proactive
[21:54] as some other ministers have asked us to
[21:56] do so so some of his schedule will
[21:59] either get cancelled
[22:01] bumped
[22:02] and moved to a later date
[22:04] so we we pray as a church family that
[22:07] god
[22:08] touches his body
[22:09] and he can be used here in our
[22:11] congregation
[22:13] and maybe through the streaming other
[22:15] ministers can be able to
[22:16] have meetings that way we
[22:19] we just want to protect him
[22:21] and we pray that god will just heal him
[22:24] but until we get a full recovery
[22:27] we're going to do our very best to be
[22:29] proactive
[22:30] and watch over our pastor
[22:32] amen
[22:34] so we want to pray for him he will he
[22:36] has planned to speak for us in the
[22:38] morning
[22:39] and
[22:39] [Music]
[22:41] so
[22:42] he said you know if i if i just give 30
[22:44] minutes i said dad if you give 15
[22:48] that'll wear the devil out
[22:50] [Music]
[22:52] you know
[23:03] so we're believing
[23:04] we're believers
[23:06] but we are also going to be very
[23:08] cautious and give let the lord give us
[23:10] wisdom on what to do

[50:01] and he shall send jesus
[50:03] which before was preached unto you
[50:08] till the times of restitution of all
[50:11] things which god hath spoken by the
[50:13] mouth of all of his holy prophets
[50:15] since the world began
[50:17] for moses truly said unto the fathers a
[50:20] prophet shall the lord your god raise up
[50:23] unto you
[50:24] of your brethren like unto me him shall
[50:27] ye hear in all things whatsoever he
[50:30] shall say unto you revelations chapter 3
[50:34] and verse 14.
[50:41] and unto the angel of the church of the
[50:43] laodiceans write these things
[50:46] saith the amen the faithful and true
[50:49] witness the beginning of the creation of
[50:52] god i love what brother branham said in
[50:54] the church age book he said before he
[50:56] dives into it he gives us one last look
[50:58] of himself right here he is the amen he
[51:01] is faithful he is the true witness and
[51:03] the beginning of the creation of god
[51:05] notice the message he said i know thy
[51:08] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[51:11] i would thou work cold or hot so then
[51:13] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[51:15] cold nor hot i will spew thee
[51:18] out of my mouth because thou sayest i am
[51:21] rich notice who is saying this because
[51:23] thou sayest i am rich and increased with
[51:25] goods and of need of nothing and know us
[51:28] not that thou art wretched and miserable
[51:31] and poor and blind and naked i counsel
[51:34] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[51:37] that thou mayest be rich and white
[51:40] raiment and that thou mayest be clothed
[51:42] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[51:44] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[51:47] isaf that thou mayest see
[51:49] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[51:53] be zealous therefore and repent behold i
[51:56] stand at the door and knock and if any
[51:58] man hear my voice and open the door i
[52:01] will come into him and will sup with him
[52:04] and he with me may god bless his word
[52:07] you may be seated in the presence of the
[52:09] lord i'd like to speak to you this
[52:11] evening on the zeal
[52:13] of the hour
[52:14] the zeal of the hour and the grounds for
[52:17] receiving
[52:18] and as we just dive into these these
[52:21] texts we realize that that is that is
[52:24] the the message of the day it is the
[52:26] zeal of the hour is
[52:28] is to repent
[52:30] we realize that love is the most
[52:32] powerful force that there is upon the
[52:34] face of the earth
[52:36] it's amazing how that human love and how
[52:39] that human love makes a man or makes
[52:41] human beings act and then also we
[52:43] realize that there's a godly love
[52:44] there's a felio love and then there's an
[52:46] agape love and we realize that there is
[52:49] such power in love and we realize that
[52:52] brother branham would tell us that love
[52:53] is one of the most powerful forces that
[52:55] there is upon the earth and he said only
[52:58] only power lays in love and it's amazing
[53:02] it's amazing what we do as human beings
[53:04] what love will make us do it love will
[53:07] make us drive across a nation just to
[53:09] find a lover love will will make us
[53:11] stand up and stand for our children and
[53:14] it'll make us stand up in the midst of
[53:16] fear and it's amazing what love does
[53:19] love cast out all fear love will make
[53:21] you stand up maybe maybe you might be a
[53:23] little bit weaker than somebody else but
[53:25] love will make you stand up for your
[53:27] wife
[53:28] love will do things that that maybe you
[53:30] wouldn't necessarily do is that right
[53:33] that's what love will do and real real
[53:35] human love it it will go beyond what you
[53:38] can even imagine what love would do love
[53:40] will make a human being run through a
[53:42] burning build and just to save their
[53:43] child love will make will make you go
[53:46] towards somebody it'll draw you to
[53:48] somebody there's a major difference
[53:50] between love and hatred and if somebody
[53:52] hates you they're not going to draw you
[53:54] they're not going to draw you to
[53:55] themselves but if somebody loves you
[53:57] there's an atmosphere that is around
[53:59] love that love will invite you in love
[54:02] will invite you in and make you make you
[54:04] a part of its home make you a part of
[54:06] its life love let you know that you're
[54:08] welcome and if we can express that in
[54:10] human love how much more with a godly
[54:13] love with a love that is from above how
[54:16] much more is his love running after us
[54:19] and is chasing after us and making sure
[54:21] that we don't get in no trouble that we
[54:23] can't get out of he loves us so much
[54:25] that he gave his only begotten son that
[54:27] whosoever believeth on him would not
[54:29] perish but have everlasting life but yet
[54:32] love is corrective love will not allow
[54:35] your child to sit out in a street and
[54:37] you just sit back there and say well
[54:38] little johnny we understand little
[54:40] johnny he's okay he's got a mind but yet
[54:42] you'll run out there real love will make
[54:44] you run out there brother branham said
[54:46] love he said love he said he said if
[54:48] your wife he said if you really love
[54:50] your wife and your wife comes in and
[54:52] says honey i'm going to go out and i'm
[54:54] going to run around on another man i'm
[54:55] going to run around with another man i'm
[54:57] going to run around with i'm going to
[54:58] run around with this guy and and you
[55:01] know as a husband he said you wouldn't
[55:02] sit there and say well honey i hope you
[55:04] have a good time but love will stand
[55:06] there and say hold up that's that's
[55:08] that's not gonna happen here you see
[55:10] love is corrective love will not stand
[55:12] for things that stand up in the way of
[55:15] what really true love is and god is love
[55:18] the only reason that we can understand
[55:20] love is because god is love and so we
[55:23] realize that the correction of god is
[55:26] the love of god and if we can understand
[55:28] or if we can receive if we can receive
[55:31] chastisement it shows that we are sons
[55:33] and we're not bastards but it shows us
[55:36] who we are if we can understand or
[55:38] receive the very things of god that he
[55:41] causes us to go into but love will allow
[55:44] us to fall deeper in love with him i'm
[55:47] so glad that he saved me that he loved
[55:49] me good so much that even when i was in
[55:52] the midst of my crisis or in the midst
[55:54] of my chaos and even though i may have
[55:56] been having a good time because sin is
[55:58] pleasurable for a season i'm so glad
[56:00] that his love outstretched my grace or
[56:03] my thoughts i'm so glad that his love
[56:06] was a chastisement love that would stop
[56:08] me in my tracks and keep me from scars
[56:10] and keep me from troubles and keep me
[56:12] from heartaches his love is powerful
[56:15] this evening and if you can recognize
[56:17] it'll make you if you can recognize the
[56:19] love of god it'll make you repent of all
[56:21] your sins it'll make you it'll make you
[56:23] run to him like never before
[56:26] is that right you see but notice what
[56:28] jesus is speaking here in the in the
[56:30] message to the church he's not
[56:32] necessarily speaking to sinners but he's
[56:34] preaching too he's preaching to the
[56:36] church that that she is to be zealous of
[56:38] him and repent of her lukewarm condition
[56:42] notice what the message is is the same
[56:44] exact message that was that that john
[56:47] the baptist was out there and he was
[56:48] preaching to the pharisees the sadducees
[56:51] and the heathens and it was repent and
[56:53] brother branham said there was no other
[56:54] course then and there is no other course
[56:56] now there was no other way to get back
[56:58] to god then and there's no other way to
[57:00] get back to god now is that is to repent
[57:03] and it's amazing to think to me that
[57:06] people how that they will stand there
[57:07] with such a heart and heart won't repent
[57:10] of their sins but why would you do that
[57:12] and stay there in a spot and die in a
[57:15] place when all you've got to do is say
[57:16] god i'm sorry but not just words but it
[57:20] comes from the heart now notice what
[57:22] brother man have said in the laodicean
[57:24] church aids he said be zealous
[57:28] and repent
[57:29] he said now this false church has a zeal
[57:32] he said make no mistake about that he
[57:34] said her zeal has literally literally
[57:37] been that of the jews john 2 and 17 the
[57:40] zeal of that house hath eaten me up and
[57:43] remember what jesus said there when when
[57:46] he was standing there in the house of
[57:48] god and he walked in there and he
[57:49] flipped over the money changers and the
[57:51] disciples remembered he re they
[57:54] remembered that the scripture said that
[57:56] thy zeal of thine house had eaten me up
[57:59] you remember that david would quote that
[58:01] in psalm 69 but yet here god jesus was
[58:04] standing there and he was fulfilling
[58:06] that and preaching the scripture that
[58:08] the zeal of thine house have eaten me up
[58:11] he said but this is a wrong zeal it is a
[58:14] wrong zeal it is for the house of their
[58:16] own building it is for their own creeds
[58:18] and dogmas and organization he said
[58:20] their own righteousness they have the
[58:22] put they have put the word out for their
[58:25] own ideas and they disposed they
[58:28] disposed the holy ghost and made men
[58:30] into leaders it shows that this church
[58:33] age has removed the holy ghost out of
[58:36] his office out of the church noticed
[58:38] what they did and they made men under
[58:40] their leaders he said they have put
[58:42] aside eternal life as a person and make
[58:44] it good works or even church conformity
[58:47] rather than the good works he said but
[58:49] god is calling for another zeal it is a
[58:52] zeal to cry i am wrong
[58:57] i'm gonna tell you if you're ever gonna
[58:58] have a happy marriage in life you're
[58:59] gonna have to learn those words i am
[59:02] sorry i am wrong
[59:05] and if you're ever going to have a great
[59:07] relationship with god you've got to
[59:09] understand the ability to say and
[59:11] express i am wrong god i am sorry the
[59:16] reason why david was a man after god's
[59:19] own heart was because he was quick to
[59:21] repent david was a man that was full of
[59:24] mistakes and full of failures but david
[59:26] knew how to call on the name of the lord
[59:29] and repent of his sins
[59:31] but notice notice he said that he's
[59:33] calling for another zeal to say that i
[59:35] am wrong he said but now who is going to
[59:37] say that he's wrong he said now he goes
[59:40] on to say he said i don't believe that
[59:41] god is calling only the false church to
[59:43] repent in this verse he is also talking
[59:46] to his elect he said they have some
[59:48] repentant to do too
[59:50] he goes on to say he said they need to
[59:52] repent they must repent they need to
[59:54] have a change of mind and turn towards
[59:57] the truth
[59:58] you see you can change your hair and
[1:00:00] come around this message and let your
[1:00:02] hair grow
[1:00:03] you can change your dress to make
[1:00:04] yourself look like a part but that ain't
[1:00:06] really the part that god's looking for
[1:00:08] you can change your makeup and wash it
[1:00:10] off of your face you can change your
[1:00:12] lover and you can change your styles but
[1:00:15] to god the most powerful thing that you
[1:00:17] can do is have a change of heart it
[1:00:20] ain't just about a change in your mind
[1:00:22] or a change in your self-will but it's a
[1:00:25] change on the inside of your heart i'm
[1:00:27] going to preach to you like you never
[1:00:28] heard this before this evening but the
[1:00:30] most powerful thing about you is to have
[1:00:34] a change of heart
[1:00:36] you see every single one of us are
[1:00:38] sitting here is rotten scoundrels we
[1:00:41] ain't nothing but a bunch of badger
[1:00:42] skins we were mean we were good for
[1:00:45] nothing let me just go over in the
[1:00:47] scripture say paul would say that there
[1:00:50] would be no adulterers and there would
[1:00:52] be no fornicators and there would be no
[1:00:54] whoremongers that would ever make it
[1:00:56] unto god or never make it into the
[1:00:58] kingdom of god but it goes down a little
[1:01:00] bit further and i find it so amazing
[1:01:02] that there are people that sit in
[1:01:04] churches year after year and decades and
[1:01:06] they they can't give out the same mercy
[1:01:09] that they received but paul didn't stop
[1:01:11] there he said but such were some of you
[1:01:15] i find it so amazing that message people
[1:01:18] think because they are the last stage
[1:01:20] people or the final voice or the final
[1:01:22] age that they can cast a shadow on
[1:01:25] somebody or or maybe they can throw over
[1:01:27] a reflection of well this one's not good
[1:01:30] enough let me tell you if we're not good
[1:01:32] enough to testify of the message of
[1:01:34] jesus christ to a baptist or a methodist
[1:01:37] or a presbyterian then this ain't the
[1:01:39] message but the message that i live and
[1:01:41] the message that came by my way
[1:01:44] what's good enough what's good enough to
[1:01:46] go to any baptist it's good enough it's
[1:01:48] though this message don't make us no
[1:01:50] greater than anybody else if you measure
[1:01:52] us down and shoot us up or shoot us down
[1:01:55] we're still human beings made out of 16
[1:01:58] elements and every single one of us if
[1:02:00] it were not for the grace of god we'd be
[1:02:02] still setting out there in that dead
[1:02:04] cold form of religion but the message
[1:02:07] whoa what a message it's not a message
[1:02:10] of judgment it's a message of grace that
[1:02:12] came by our way oh how we ought to be
[1:02:15] thankful that god cared so much for you
[1:02:17] and i
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:27] the kingdom of god is not meat the
[1:02:29] kingdom of god is not materialistic it's
[1:02:31] not apparel but brother branham would
[1:02:33] say in the token in dallas texas in 1964
[1:02:36] he said it's god's blood-bound promises
[1:02:38] that make you and i free it ain't the
[1:02:41] way you dress yes i believe you ought to
[1:02:42] dress holy yes i believe you brother's
[1:02:45] not a you're not out of we wearing
[1:02:47] skinny jeans and looking like a i
[1:02:49] believe you sisters ought to dress like
[1:02:51] women but it ain't that that makes you
[1:02:53] holy because you can go down to walmart
[1:02:55] maybe not in walmart no more but you can
[1:02:57] go up to main street exchange and buy
[1:02:59] yourself a dress but just because you
[1:03:01] got yourself a dress does not mean that
[1:03:03] your message but the inside of the
[1:03:05] inside is what makes the message
[1:03:10] let me preach to you a moment on this
[1:03:12] thought right here it's the blood-bound
[1:03:14] promises of god that makes you and i
[1:03:16] free it ain't our dress it ain't
[1:03:18] ourselves it ain't our emotion it's the
[1:03:21] blood of jesus christ that made every
[1:03:23] single one of us free
[1:03:33] notice what jesus
[1:03:35] when jesus begins to sit down and have
[1:03:37] supper with his friends he sets down his
[1:03:40] supper in mark chapter two you find that
[1:03:42] he shuts down and he's sitting down
[1:03:44] there with his disciples and he's
[1:03:45] sitting down with the publicans and the
[1:03:47] sinners and he comes there and there the
[1:03:49] pharisees and the priests come in and
[1:03:51] they look on him and they look at the
[1:03:54] disciples and have a conversation with
[1:03:55] the disciples that said why is it that
[1:03:58] your so-called messiah isn't sitting
[1:04:00] down and having dinner with us but he's
[1:04:02] sitting out there with uh with
[1:04:04] republicans with the common people and
[1:04:06] sitting out there with sinners and when
[1:04:08] jesus heard about it the bible said when
[1:04:10] jesus heard about it he spent to them
[1:04:13] and he said them that are whole don't
[1:04:15] need a physician
[1:04:17] but those that are sick need a physician
[1:04:19] and he said i came not to call the
[1:04:21] righteous he said but i came to call
[1:04:24] sinners under repentance i say this to
[1:04:26] you jesus was not ashamed to go by the
[1:04:28] woman of the well jesus wasn't ashamed
[1:04:31] to go by to go by the they go by the way
[1:04:35] of nicodemus he wasn't ashamed to go by
[1:04:37] the lepers and heal him on the sabbath
[1:04:40] he wasn't ashamed to go by harley and
[1:04:42] call her unto himself he wasn't ashamed
[1:04:44] to walk down to a harlot and a prodigal
[1:04:47] and this that or the other he was not
[1:04:49] ashamed to walk by your way
[1:04:51] but he did not leave them where he found
[1:04:53] them
[1:04:55] he came to call the sinners unto
[1:04:58] repentance he was not ashamed to stand
[1:05:01] up for you when nobody else would stand
[1:05:04] up for you
[1:05:08] there might be a spot in your life in
[1:05:10] your life young people that you're
[1:05:12] ashamed to call on jesus but let me
[1:05:14] preach to you on this thought there's
[1:05:15] going to come a spot in your life when
[1:05:18] you're going to need this jesus there's
[1:05:19] going to come a time in your life maybe
[1:05:21] you're sitting in that spot right now
[1:05:23] when you're too cool to call jesus name
[1:05:25] or you're too cool to live this message
[1:05:28] but there's gonna come a time in life
[1:05:30] maybe why you're burning in hell that
[1:05:31] you wish you would have been cool with
[1:05:33] the message
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:40] all right let's preach just a little bit
[1:05:42] tonight he said my brothers and elijah
[1:05:44] the message elijah he said brother what
[1:05:47] we need tonight over the whole nation
[1:05:49] he's an old-fashioned god sent revival
[1:05:51] repentance for every every church and
[1:05:53] every individual to come back to god to
[1:05:56] the true
[1:05:57] living god not to psychology not to
[1:05:59] theology of the church but what we need
[1:06:02] to do is come back to the true and
[1:06:04] living god who changes a man's heart his
[1:06:07] nature he changes his makeup makes him a
[1:06:09] new creature in christ jesus who kills
[1:06:12] all the nature of the world and makes a
[1:06:14] person a new creature he said oh
[1:06:16] christian friends he said that's what
[1:06:18] the world needs tonight he said we don't
[1:06:20] need a program he said we need the
[1:06:22] regular program that christ said at
[1:06:24] calvary when he was here on earth he
[1:06:27] said except a man be born again he will
[1:06:29] in no wise enter the kingdom of god he
[1:06:32] said that's what we need tonight
[1:06:34] well i'll tell you this we don't need
[1:06:36] some we don't need some some aaa meeting
[1:06:38] to get our drunks out of the out of the
[1:06:41] bottle
[1:06:42] let me tell you one time in his presence
[1:06:44] was said an alcoholic free
[1:06:46] i understand the power of addictions i
[1:06:48] understand the power of sin and the
[1:06:50] power of those things but i'll tell you
[1:06:52] one time in his presence
[1:06:54] will break an addiction
[1:06:56] addiction an addiction to porn and
[1:06:58] addiction alcohol an addiction to
[1:07:00] cigarettes
[1:07:02] an addiction to tobacco and addiction to
[1:07:04] the worldly things of this life one time
[1:07:07] in his presence
[1:07:09] will break
[1:07:10] your cycle over your life
[1:07:15] is that right we don't need we don't
[1:07:17] need psychology psychology won't work we
[1:07:19] got too many man man-made preachers
[1:07:22] trying to stand behind the pulpit and
[1:07:24] preach psychology muhammad if we needed
[1:07:27] psychology we'd have stayed with
[1:07:29] muhammad or we couldn't went back there
[1:07:31] to buddha or went back to concern
[1:07:33] confucius and those men or could we
[1:07:35] could have went out there to the
[1:07:36] religiosity of the world where they
[1:07:38] ain't got no power to save nobody much
[1:07:40] more than a lifesaver meant it's got
[1:07:42] power to save somebody that's drowned it
[1:07:44] the world church world ain't got no
[1:07:47] power in it
[1:07:50] because they don't like a blood religion
[1:07:53] and any religion they don't have the
[1:07:55] blood of jesus christ
[1:07:56] is a powerless religion
[1:08:00] let me tell you the only real truth is
[1:08:03] jesus christ it is the very essence of
[1:08:06] the message is that he is risen from the
[1:08:09] dead and you and i are his beneficiaries
[1:08:15] is that right
[1:08:16] well you see what repents is
[1:08:20] repentance is a hatred
[1:08:23] of sin
[1:08:25] it's it's a turning away from sin and a
[1:08:28] determination in the strength of god to
[1:08:31] forsake it
[1:08:32] but if we're ever living in an hour when
[1:08:34] men are aligned they're relying on
[1:08:37] themselves or they're relying on
[1:08:39] self-confidence that i understand this
[1:08:41] or i i can handle this but our goal is
[1:08:45] to rely on god
[1:08:49] we are strictly relying on the very life
[1:08:52] of god and we can simply put no
[1:08:54] confidence in our flesh you can't put no
[1:08:57] confidence in your mind because in your
[1:08:59] mind is where you reason at but you
[1:09:01] recognize when brother branham would
[1:09:02] preach on how can i overcome and he
[1:09:04] would say that he was crossing over that
[1:09:06] old dodie log out there he said i
[1:09:08] watched it it was a great it was a great
[1:09:10] strong tree he said but what made it
[1:09:12] doty was the life went out of it and
[1:09:15] when the life of jesus christ goes out
[1:09:17] on an individual or goes out of a church
[1:09:19] you can write ichabod across that church
[1:09:22] or ichabod across that individual but
[1:09:24] when the life of jesus is there
[1:09:27] you'll find a strong church or a strong
[1:09:29] individual
[1:09:32] i had i had a youth youth deal years ago
[1:09:35] and not here but it was a way and these
[1:09:38] the these youth were asking now what
[1:09:40] what if we have a problem who do we go
[1:09:42] to or where do we run to do we run to a
[1:09:45] pastor or do we can we call the deacon
[1:09:47] or do we do we call do we call an elder
[1:09:49] in a church let me tell you there's
[1:09:51] going to come times in your life when
[1:09:53] you can't get a hold of the pastor you
[1:09:55] can't get a hold of the deacons you
[1:09:57] can't get a hold of associates you're
[1:09:59] going to have to find yourself on an old
[1:10:01] altar maybe out no shed somewhere and
[1:10:05] find yourself a real experience with god
[1:10:10] i believe we've got strong believers
[1:10:12] here but there's times when you don't
[1:10:14] need to call on them you need to get on
[1:10:16] your knees
[1:10:17] for yourself this ain't this ain't about
[1:10:20] being confident in yourself it's about
[1:10:22] being confident in the king the prince
[1:10:24] of life
[1:10:25] and it's constantly staying in life not
[1:10:28] a mental understanding
[1:10:30] but this repentance is a change of your
[1:10:33] nature a change of your desire
[1:10:37] the reason why we preach to you the
[1:10:39] message because it's the only message
[1:10:41] that'll get you out of here
[1:10:46] i ain't got no confidence i ain't got no
[1:10:49] confidence in men but i do have
[1:10:51] confidence in this message
[1:10:56] i ain't got confident in men's teachings
[1:10:58] outside of this message
[1:11:00] but i do have confidence in the word of
[1:11:02] god
[1:11:04] and that's why we stand here and we
[1:11:06] preach to you listen to the message play
[1:11:08] those tapes when you're not here feed on
[1:11:11] the word of god you see there's a
[1:11:12] purpose in feeding on the very word of
[1:11:15] god it's to live constantly in an
[1:11:17] atmosphere where christ is welcome
[1:11:22] you're gonna have to have church all by
[1:11:23] yourself sometimes
[1:11:26] is that right there's going to be some
[1:11:28] times when you don't feel like a real
[1:11:30] christian there's going to be some times
[1:11:32] when you've been run over every which
[1:11:34] away from the spirit of anxiety the
[1:11:36] spirit of fear and the spirit of
[1:11:38] laodicea and you're going to have to
[1:11:40] have yourself some church
[1:11:44] is anybody ever had church all by
[1:11:46] themselves ever had to call on god by
[1:11:49] themselves ever been in the valley all
[1:11:51] by themselves but god didn't leave you
[1:11:53] down in a valley
[1:11:55] god didn't leave you in church all by
[1:11:57] yourself the bible said that with you
[1:11:59] begin to praise him that he will come
[1:12:01] down
[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:09] maybe people say well i'm afraid if i
[1:12:10] get this kind of religion
[1:12:12] what it'll make me do
[1:12:14] how to make me act
[1:12:16] or what others think
[1:12:19] but let me point you through some
[1:12:20] scriptures
[1:12:21] let me point you to some ladies and
[1:12:23] ladies in the grace of the lord jesus
[1:12:25] christ that wasn't ashamed wasn't
[1:12:27] ashamed to get down they wasn't ashamed
[1:12:30] about how jesus would make them they
[1:12:32] wasn't ashamed how it would make them
[1:12:33] look in their social standing
[1:12:38] that's the biggest problem that we find
[1:12:40] with teenagers today is they want a
[1:12:42] social standing amongst the social crowd
[1:12:46] that don't give a care what you look
[1:12:48] like in person only what you care about
[1:12:51] what you look about on your instagram
[1:12:57] well i'm gonna have a good
[1:13:02] time but the woman
[1:13:05] when jesus when she found jesus all in a
[1:13:08] room
[1:13:09] tucked over in a corner all by himself
[1:13:12] tucked over there where nobody else had
[1:13:13] made him feel welcome and simon only
[1:13:16] brought him there so that he could mock
[1:13:18] him
[1:13:18] brought him in there he didn't welcome
[1:13:20] him with a kiss he didn't anoint him
[1:13:22] with oil he didn't wash his feet he
[1:13:24] didn't wash his feet off the dust of the
[1:13:26] earth he didn't wash off the cow manure
[1:13:28] and the horse manure and the donkey men
[1:13:29] were off of his feet and he just set him
[1:13:31] over there in a corner
[1:13:33] i'm afraid that's too many people's
[1:13:35] problem today they set jesus in a corner
[1:13:38] there this woman when she began to see
[1:13:41] that there was one that she'd heard
[1:13:44] about sitting in a corner she wasn't
[1:13:46] going to stand for that and i found
[1:13:48] brother barnum said that when she was
[1:13:51] there at his feet he said she was
[1:13:53] bathing his feet with the tears of
[1:13:56] repentance
[1:13:59] with a true heart with true repentance
[1:14:02] brother branham would say in
[1:14:04] washington's feet he said she didn't
[1:14:06] care what anybody else thought about
[1:14:08] what she looked like she didn't care
[1:14:10] what anybody else thought how that she
[1:14:12] should not be in there
[1:14:15] you know by the standards they could
[1:14:17] have took the law of the day and cast
[1:14:20] her out of there because she was not
[1:14:22] invited in there but she didn't care if
[1:14:25] the law came in there and kicked her out
[1:14:27] but she was going in there to make jesus
[1:14:29] feel welcome
[1:14:32] he said she was crying brother branham
[1:14:34] said he said she was hysterical the way
[1:14:37] that she was crying he said but the time
[1:14:39] that i got in his presence he said i was
[1:14:41] hysterical too
[1:14:42] he said she could barely hold herself
[1:14:44] together he said when i got in his
[1:14:46] presence he said i could barely hold
[1:14:48] myself together and if you ever get in
[1:14:50] the presence of jesus christ brother
[1:14:52] branham said he said they was going to
[1:14:53] excommunicate me from the church he's
[1:14:56] but i didn't care i was in his presence
[1:15:00] let me tell you the time to worship him
[1:15:02] is not when you leave the building it's
[1:15:05] right now
[1:15:07] when you feel the shekinah come down
[1:15:10] it's not a time to wonder did i miss it
[1:15:12] just jump in
[1:15:14] if the healing angel's in the water
[1:15:16] brother step in
[1:15:23] she didn't care
[1:15:25] she found love
[1:15:27] she never found love in those other
[1:15:29] men's hearts
[1:15:31] she found forgiveness she didn't find
[1:15:33] forgiveness in another man's arms
[1:15:35] but what she found in god's wrapped gift
[1:15:39] was the one that could repent that she
[1:15:41] could repent to and wash her sins away
[1:15:47] but repentance repents as a complete
[1:15:49] reversal
[1:15:50] of one's attitudes
[1:15:52] and values
[1:15:54] you see what you value in life is what
[1:15:56] you deem important
[1:15:59] and what you value right now before
[1:16:01] repentance will be completely opposite
[1:16:04] than what you what you value after your
[1:16:06] repentance
[1:16:10] you see if you value social life or if
[1:16:12] you value sustainability amongst
[1:16:14] humanity
[1:16:16] it'll be completely turned around and
[1:16:18] you'll value spiritual life you'll value
[1:16:21] sustainability just like abraham was
[1:16:23] sustained
[1:16:25] because repentance turned you away from
[1:16:28] what you were to what god wants you to
[1:16:30] be
[1:16:31] repents is powerful
[1:16:34] you remember when ahab
[1:16:36] when ahab coveted nabos vineyard
[1:16:42] he got all upset and got pouty about and
[1:16:44] he went back to his jezebel wife back
[1:16:46] there
[1:16:48] and got to poutine about it said naboth
[1:16:50] won't sell it to me he won't bargain
[1:16:52] with me he won't barter with me
[1:16:54] and jezebel contrived in herself
[1:16:57] and conjured up a plan that they put
[1:16:59] nabe off to death
[1:17:02] we'll get that vendor for you ahab don't
[1:17:04] you worry about this you better watch if
[1:17:06] you get yourself a jezebel wife
[1:17:08] she'll get you in trouble
[1:17:15] i want this vineyard so bad that i'm
[1:17:17] willing to kill somebody for it
[1:17:20] but notice
[1:17:22] what the prophet came to him
[1:17:24] and said the dogs
[1:17:25] that licked up nabos blood will be the
[1:17:28] dogs that lick up your blood
[1:17:32] if you go down there in first kings 21
[1:17:34] you'll find
[1:17:35] that ahab
[1:17:37] was in awe
[1:17:39] and he repented
[1:17:44] and god said i will not visit
[1:17:47] evil in his day but i will visit the
[1:17:49] evil in his son's day but you flip over
[1:17:52] one chapter more
[1:17:54] and you'll find
[1:17:55] that ahab
[1:17:57] that ahab
[1:17:58] rebelled against on god and he tried to
[1:18:01] disguise himself
[1:18:03] and notice when they when the king when
[1:18:05] the when they when the kings came up
[1:18:07] there and they shot the arrow and they
[1:18:08] killed ahab notice the dogs licked his
[1:18:12] blood right there in naboth's vineyard
[1:18:15] you see what nahab was he was a slave to
[1:18:18] his own transgressions
[1:18:21] it wasn't true repentance
[1:18:24] it didn't come from his heart
[1:18:27] god may give him a repeat a reprieve in
[1:18:29] time but yet god was still he didn't
[1:18:32] humble himself ahab didn't humble
[1:18:35] himself and he was a slave to
[1:18:36] transgressions
[1:18:38] and you may come to a spot in your life
[1:18:40] yourselves and you might humble yourself
[1:18:42] before god or somebody and somebody
[1:18:45] might humble themselves before god just
[1:18:47] for for a for a time but yet they remain
[1:18:50] a slave to their transgressions people
[1:18:52] may be afraid of damnation but they're
[1:18:54] not afraid of sin and
[1:18:56] people might be afraid of hell but
[1:18:58] they're not afraid to do their
[1:18:59] iniquities
[1:19:01] people might be afraid of being cast
[1:19:03] into a pit but they're not afraid of
[1:19:06] hardening their hearts towards god's
[1:19:07] commandments
[1:19:09] agrippa when paul stood up there and
[1:19:11] preached to him christ crucified the
[1:19:13] bible said that agrippa said thou almost
[1:19:17] persuades me to be a christian but
[1:19:19] notice his persuasion was not that of
[1:19:23] repentance
[1:19:24] because the bible said in first second
[1:19:26] corinthians 7 and 10 that for godly
[1:19:29] sorrow worketh repentance
[1:19:31] to salvation not to be repented of but
[1:19:34] the sorrow of the world
[1:19:36] worketh death
[1:19:39] repentance got to come
[1:19:41] from your heart
[1:19:48] even judas
[1:19:52] even judas the bible said repented
[1:19:58] they said well brother andrew i've
[1:19:59] repented
[1:20:00] judas repented
[1:20:02] you can find in matthew 27 that judas
[1:20:06] goes when he sees that they're
[1:20:07] condemning jesus
[1:20:11] i'm trying to find the message
[1:20:13] just now
[1:20:16] but anyways i'll find it for you and
[1:20:18] i'll give it to you if you need it but
[1:20:19] brother brandon said that judas
[1:20:22] it was in lean not to your own
[1:20:23] understanding that judas was leaning to
[1:20:26] his own understanding and he thought
[1:20:28] jesus could get himself out of this mess
[1:20:33] and he sold him out
[1:20:35] for 30 pieces of silver
[1:20:37] and when they seen when he seen that
[1:20:40] jesus wasn't going to get out of this
[1:20:41] and they were condemning him to the
[1:20:43] cross the bible said that judas repented
[1:20:47] of himself and went before the high
[1:20:49] priest and he cast the money down and
[1:20:52] they said what is that to us and the
[1:20:54] bible said that he repented himself
[1:20:57] he repented himself but notice where
[1:20:59] this repentance did it took him to the
[1:21:02] gallows it didn't take him to christ
[1:21:04] heart repentance will lead you to a
[1:21:06] cross
[1:21:09] but just because you corrupted yourself
[1:21:11] and corrupted the kingdom of god and
[1:21:14] just because you cried because you did a
[1:21:16] crime does not mean its heart repentance
[1:21:20] judas was a castaway and he could not
[1:21:24] get back to christ because he truly did
[1:21:26] not know how to get to pentecost
[1:21:35] repentance
[1:21:36] leads the sinner to the savior
[1:21:40] that's what repentance do now watch let
[1:21:42] me show you what repentance will do in
[1:21:43] ezekiel 18 and 30. the bible said
[1:21:46] therefore i will judge you o house of
[1:21:48] israel everyone according to his ways
[1:21:50] saith the lord repent and turn
[1:21:52] yourselves from all your transgressions
[1:21:55] so that iniquity shall not be your ruin
[1:21:59] young people write that scripture down
[1:22:01] cast away from all your transgressions
[1:22:04] whereby you have transgressed and make
[1:22:07] you a new heart and a new spirit for why
[1:22:09] will you die o house of israel for i
[1:22:12] have no pleasure in the death of him
[1:22:13] that died saith the lord god wherefore
[1:22:16] turn yourselves and live
[1:22:20] do you recognize what repentance does
[1:22:22] repentance turns you from death unto
[1:22:25] life
[1:22:26] that's the power of true
[1:22:29] repentance
[1:22:30] god i'm sorry
[1:22:32] god i didn't mean to do that god i made
[1:22:34] a mistake there is power into repentance
[1:22:38] notice where your repentance takes you
[1:22:40] if it's a repentance that'll lead you
[1:22:42] right back up to sin
[1:22:44] it's not heart repentance
[1:22:48] but heart repentance will only lead you
[1:22:51] back to the word
[1:22:54] if there ever was an hour
[1:22:56] that repents needed to be preached
[1:22:59] it's this hour it's the zeal of the hour
[1:23:02] it's to say god
[1:23:04] i'm sorry
[1:23:09] i've often said it
[1:23:10] that redemption
[1:23:12] that redemption is like a magnet
[1:23:15] it's got a positive and it's a negative
[1:23:18] i always enjoyed science class class
[1:23:20] sticking those sticking those magnets
[1:23:22] together
[1:23:25] i guess we i'm the only one here
[1:23:27] that played with magnets in science
[1:23:28] class
[1:23:30] maybe y'all were off listening or
[1:23:32] listening to the teacher and i was over
[1:23:33] playing the magnets
[1:23:36] i always loved i always enjoyed
[1:23:39] i always enjoyed watching those magnets
[1:23:40] there's two sides of that magnet
[1:23:42] there's a positive side and there's a
[1:23:44] negative side
[1:23:46] and you watch
[1:23:47] you push that positive side against a
[1:23:49] positive side and it'll push away and
[1:23:52] you watch that negative what it do it'll
[1:23:54] pull the positive to it and that's what
[1:23:56] redemption does it pushes away the world
[1:23:59] and pulls christ to you
[1:24:01] that's what christ does he magnetizes
[1:24:04] you to the spirit and when there are
[1:24:06] things that are held down there are
[1:24:08] things that are held down by co-former
[1:24:10] religion there are things that have been
[1:24:12] magnetized to the spirit that cannot
[1:24:15] stay there in some dead cold formal dead
[1:24:18] idea they've got to get up and wear the
[1:24:20] spirits out of moving out
[1:24:24] that's what redemption does it draws you
[1:24:26] it draws you unto him and do you realize
[1:24:29] that when you repent brother branham
[1:24:31] says you are back
[1:24:36] i got that's a direct quote for you
[1:24:38] honey when you repent you are back
[1:24:42] your sins are forgiven and you're a
[1:24:44] candidate for the baptism of the holy
[1:24:47] ghost when you repent you're back to the
[1:24:50] kingdom
[1:24:53] oh i'm looking at some people that made
[1:24:55] their way back if a salmon knows how to
[1:24:58] get back to its birthplace where are the
[1:25:00] sons and daughters of god know how to
[1:25:03] return to their true birthplace
[1:25:07] i say this to you mamas and daddies to
[1:25:09] encourage you the bible said raise up
[1:25:11] your child in the way that they'll go
[1:25:14] and they will not forget it if they're a
[1:25:16] son they know how to make their way back
[1:25:19] the prodigal is waking up into himself
[1:25:23] he might be in a hog pin but he's coming
[1:25:29] hello
[1:25:32] hello
[1:25:33] i got satan didn't want that
[1:25:37] the prodigal is waking up
[1:25:39] and he's coming to himself
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:43] oh satan he tried to shut me up
[1:25:47] the prodigal is waking up to himself it
[1:25:50] may be somebody that's over 50 years old
[1:25:53] but they still might be a prodigal there
[1:25:56] might be a mom or a daddy that's already
[1:25:58] made it over to glory land but there's
[1:26:01] prodigals that are coming back to
[1:26:03] themselves
[1:26:05] hallelujah
[1:26:06] that's what redemption is doing it's
[1:26:09] going after those
[1:26:13] you're predestinated your seed is the
[1:26:16] only thing that keeps you predestinated
[1:26:20] and let me tell you church if you're
[1:26:22] seed of god if you're a seed of abraham
[1:26:24] you can't be lost
[1:26:27] he might be hunting all over for you
[1:26:29] like the man in luke 15 looking for his
[1:26:32] coin or looking for a sheep
[1:26:35] jesus was preaching to predestination
[1:26:37] right there in luke chapter 15. notice
[1:26:40] when that when that man when the one
[1:26:43] sheep went away from the flock of 9 9
[1:26:46] what did he do he said well i guess
[1:26:47] it'll be okay i can live with these 99
[1:26:50] absolutely not he said now
[1:26:53] 99 and a half just won't do
[1:26:58] what did he do he left the 99 to go get
[1:27:01] the one let me tell you i was that one
[1:27:07] he came looking for me
[1:27:11] he came looking for me i wonder if we
[1:27:14] could have a testimony for legion right
[1:27:16] here just now
[1:27:17] i was that one
[1:27:19] i was that one back there in a cave i
[1:27:21] was that one that cut myself i was that
[1:27:24] one that nobody wanted me i was that one
[1:27:26] no denomination could handle me
[1:27:31] but when i was all when all hope was
[1:27:33] gone when chains couldn't hold me no
[1:27:36] more when i couldn't find no pleasure in
[1:27:38] the caves and in the gambling in the
[1:27:40] alcohol no more
[1:27:43] when i thought that nobody come looking
[1:27:45] for me i lost my family
[1:27:48] i lost everything but there one day he
[1:27:51] came looking for me
[1:27:58] legion would you like to testify for a
[1:28:00] minute less i'd like to testify just for
[1:28:03] a minute
[1:28:04] i'd like to testify just for a minute
[1:28:06] jesus cared so much about me that two
[1:28:09] thousand demons wouldn't stop him from
[1:28:11] getting to me jesus loved me so much
[1:28:14] that he wouldn't let me stay one more
[1:28:15] night out there in that prison
[1:28:22] your time
[1:28:24] this is not the time to give up
[1:28:26] to give up won't you try one more time
[1:28:29] you might shock yourself
[1:28:31] you might shock yourself how successful
[1:28:33] you'll be because on the inside of you
[1:28:36] is the potential to be a real son of god
[1:28:41] let me tell you daniel didn't stop
[1:28:43] when they made fun of him daniel didn't
[1:28:46] stop when they taught him that he
[1:28:47] couldn't pray
[1:28:48] daniel didn't stop praying he actually
[1:28:50] threw up the curtains he said if you
[1:28:52] don't like that watch this
[1:28:54] daniel didn't stop his prayer life
[1:28:56] because somebody else was giving up hope
[1:28:58] on praying to a living god daniel didn't
[1:29:01] give up hope when they told him that he
[1:29:02] had to bow or the three hubert children
[1:29:04] had to bow daniel didn't give up hope
[1:29:06] when they threw him in a lion's den
[1:29:08] daniel stood steadfast in the faith that
[1:29:11] was once delivered to the saints
[1:29:20] hallelujah
[1:29:25] you see when the word of god begins to
[1:29:26] get preached
[1:29:31] you watch a reaction
[1:29:34] he wants a reaction
[1:29:38] i got said something
[1:29:40] here in the last week
[1:29:42] i won't say what day but i got sent
[1:29:44] something there wasn't nothing more than
[1:29:45] a ted talk that wouldn't have no power
[1:29:47] to resurrect nobody much less a little
[1:29:48] fish
[1:29:50] but when god sends preaching by the way
[1:29:53] it causes a reaction
[1:29:56] is that right
[1:29:57] there ain't no room in the pulpit for a
[1:30:00] ted talk or for a pumping up talk
[1:30:03] there is only room for power and
[1:30:05] demonstration
[1:30:07] is that right that's what paul said that
[1:30:09] the preaching of the word was
[1:30:11] demonstration and in power
[1:30:15] let me tell you if you want to see a
[1:30:17] change in your life get your children
[1:30:19] get your family under the preaching of
[1:30:21] the word
[1:30:22] and when the word is preached it'll
[1:30:24] cause a reaction it'll cause a reaction
[1:30:26] you remember you when i tell you this
[1:30:28] story you'll remember what i'm talking
[1:30:29] about so you could say i remember after
[1:30:30] i tell you about it all right so i
[1:30:32] remember
[1:30:33] all right that's good i'm glad you're on
[1:30:34] the same page i am we remember together
[1:30:37] but you remember when brother brandon
[1:30:38] was up here in kentucky and he said he
[1:30:39] was holding a meeting up there for about
[1:30:40] a year he was up there preaching and he
[1:30:42] was preaching on a message on repent or
[1:30:44] perish and he said there he was in that
[1:30:47] country and he said that's logging
[1:30:48] country and he said they was up there in
[1:30:50] them mountains and he said there i'd
[1:30:52] heard about this rough crowd that was
[1:30:54] coming and he said how do you start to
[1:30:55] remember all right that's good you're
[1:30:57] starting to come to remembrance remember
[1:31:01] all right and they're up here and these
[1:31:03] people brother brandon was told that he
[1:31:04] was the roughest people in that country
[1:31:07] and he said they come up there with the
[1:31:09] intention that we're going to go up
[1:31:10] there and we're going to throw that
[1:31:11] little preacher out the window make a
[1:31:13] mockery of him but brother baram said he
[1:31:15] stayed there too long one night and he
[1:31:17] said i got to preaching on repent or
[1:31:19] perish and he stood there he stood there
[1:31:22] and he said before long his hands was up
[1:31:24] in the air and he was making his way
[1:31:26] down to the altar he said he couldn't
[1:31:28] get there fast enough he'd come there
[1:31:30] with one intention but by the preaching
[1:31:32] of the word repent came to its spot
[1:31:37] it caused a reaction because the word of
[1:31:40] god will cause you
[1:31:43] to react to the word of god you're going
[1:31:45] to walk out of here one way or another
[1:31:46] tonight i don't care how great a
[1:31:48] christian you are or how deep a deep a
[1:31:51] philosopher you are tonight it doesn't
[1:31:53] matter how you walked in here you're
[1:31:54] going to walk out of here better or
[1:31:56] weaker and i choose to walk out of here
[1:31:58] on the positive side of things
[1:32:06] are you remembering
[1:32:09] but brother branham said that there was
[1:32:10] a
[1:32:11] he said in that meeting he said there
[1:32:13] was an alcoholic
[1:32:14] and he said i began to preach and he
[1:32:16] said i stood there and i he said i stood
[1:32:18] there and i began to preach you
[1:32:20] drunkards turn away from your ways
[1:32:22] repent or perish and that man got mad at
[1:32:25] brother branham got angry and walked out
[1:32:27] of the building i've had him do that to
[1:32:28] me too
[1:32:29] they'll walk out on you but brother
[1:32:31] brown said that he was staying over at
[1:32:33] his grandfather's place in kentucky he
[1:32:35] said i was up there and he said about
[1:32:36] midnight that night there come a knock
[1:32:38] on my door and there that drunk came up
[1:32:40] there knocking on that door and he said
[1:32:42] brother branham you're about to remember
[1:32:44] brother brown
[1:32:46] i just had the most terrible dream and
[1:32:48] brother the brother begins to describe
[1:32:50] to him that's what the dream was and he
[1:32:53] begins to describe to him he said there
[1:32:55] he said i dreamed i was a rabbit
[1:32:58] he said i was out there and he said i
[1:33:00] was just eating in that field eating the
[1:33:02] finest clover and he said i was just
[1:33:04] having a big old time and he said all of
[1:33:06] a sudden i heard the ball of a hound
[1:33:09] come across a hill and he said i heard
[1:33:11] it and he said i begin to run with
[1:33:13] everything that is within me he said i
[1:33:15] run and he said i could feel the hot
[1:33:16] breath of that hound running me down he
[1:33:19] said running me down he said but notice
[1:33:21] what he said he said i turned aside to
[1:33:23] see he said because i'd heard about a
[1:33:25] rock he said i heard about a rock and on
[1:33:28] the inside of that rock was a hole have
[1:33:30] you ever heard about a rock
[1:33:32] you may be running with everything
[1:33:34] that's within you but if you've heard
[1:33:35] about a rock
[1:33:38] oh if you've heard about iraq let me
[1:33:41] tell you something that brother said he
[1:33:43] said i'd heard he said i heard about
[1:33:45] that rock and i heard there was a hole
[1:33:47] in it he said if i knew that if i could
[1:33:49] get to that hole i'd be all right he
[1:33:51] said i was running and he said i knew
[1:33:52] that just at any second that he was
[1:33:54] going to gobble me up he said but all of
[1:33:57] a sudden he said i pounced into that
[1:33:59] hole
[1:34:00] he said then i let off the pressure
[1:34:06] oh let me tell you the bible said in
[1:34:08] psalms 46 that our god is our refuge and
[1:34:12] our strength in times of trouble when
[1:34:15] the seas are roaring about us when
[1:34:17] troubles are going on about us there is
[1:34:19] a place of refuge
[1:34:24] your refuge
[1:34:26] your refuge your city of refuge is no
[1:34:28] other place but the name of jesus christ
[1:34:31] it is a strong tower
[1:34:35] and you young girls might be sitting
[1:34:36] here guilty of all kinds of things you
[1:34:38] young boys could be sitting here guilty
[1:34:41] of all kinds of calamities of life
[1:34:46] and the hounds of hell might be chasing
[1:34:48] you down
[1:34:51] they might be chasing you down
[1:34:53] going after you as hard as you can go
[1:34:56] and you might be guilty of it all
[1:35:02] can i give you
[1:35:03] a prophet's word
[1:35:07] if you're guilty
[1:35:10] ask him
[1:35:11] to forgive you
[1:35:21] ask him to forgive you
[1:35:34] i'd say that if we'd sit here and say
[1:35:38] well this brother did this or that
[1:35:39] brother did that
[1:35:40] this sister did this committed this act
[1:35:42] or done this act
[1:35:44] i'd say there's some people
[1:35:47] that would quickly grab a rock
[1:35:52] but i want to be the voice of jesus
[1:35:55] woman
[1:35:57] where's your accusers at
[1:36:00] you might be guilty of everything that
[1:36:02] the law has said about you
[1:36:04] you might be guilty of doing all kinds
[1:36:07] of different acts
[1:36:11] i'm only preaching this
[1:36:13] because he's laid this on my heart
[1:36:16] for two weeks he's laid this on my heart
[1:36:17] he woke me up early this morning with a
[1:36:20] dream to give you this
[1:36:23] if you're guilty
[1:36:25] ask him to forgive you
[1:36:29] a prophet's words
[1:36:31] and he will take you back
[1:36:38] hallelujah
[1:36:41] and he
[1:36:42] will take
[1:36:44] you back
[1:36:45] he said it'll create in you a thirst
[1:36:48] that you can't go no further without
[1:36:50] finding that water broke
[1:36:53] and the hounds of hell might be chasing
[1:36:55] you
[1:36:56] but ask
[1:36:58] and you shall be forgiven
[1:37:03] the spirit of the lord dropped in my
[1:37:05] house last night
[1:37:09] and i saw a man running with everything
[1:37:11] that was within him
[1:37:13] he was running from the law when he was
[1:37:14] running from his critics
[1:37:16] he was running with everything was
[1:37:17] within him and the voice of the critic
[1:37:19] was hollering out i'm going to get you
[1:37:22] i'm going to get you i'm going to get
[1:37:24] you
[1:37:27] i'm going to get you
[1:37:30] you might be running with everything
[1:37:32] that is within you and the hounds of
[1:37:34] hell might be chasing after you and you
[1:37:36] may have done all kinds of ungodly
[1:37:38] things but there's a voice that's crying
[1:37:41] out
[1:37:42] repent
[1:37:44] repent and i'll take you back
[1:37:47] the judgment of the law would have
[1:37:49] cursed you and you went to a devil's
[1:37:51] hell but mercy came running after you
[1:37:54] it was mercy that rewrote your life it
[1:37:56] was mercy that saved you it was mercy
[1:37:59] that broke you out of that prison
[1:38:04] you can run all you want to and you can
[1:38:06] chase us all you want to hell but there
[1:38:09] is a way
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:17] i thought brother wayne did such a
[1:38:19] spectacular job
[1:38:21] on that trap
[1:38:23] every single one of us
[1:38:25] sat here in all
[1:38:28] we sat here in all we watched the
[1:38:29] raccoon get trapped and we watched a
[1:38:32] real trapper tell us how to set a trap
[1:38:38] you know brother branham said
[1:38:42] he said that the devil's got a trap
[1:38:43] setting for you
[1:38:46] he said the devil's got a trap setting
[1:38:47] for you
[1:38:52] there's a trap setting for you
[1:38:54] he said but all you have to do is say
[1:38:56] lord
[1:38:58] i'm sorry
[1:39:02] the one that studied your pattern the
[1:39:04] one that had hunted you down and the one
[1:39:06] that had chased you down
[1:39:08] he'd hunted you and he locked you he
[1:39:10] looked at you locked in a path locked in
[1:39:13] your pattern said they're going to come
[1:39:14] this way but brother branham said
[1:39:19] repentance gets you out of that trap
[1:39:26] there were men that stood there on the
[1:39:28] inauguration day when peter come out of
[1:39:30] that upper room and he was staggering
[1:39:33] under the influence of the holy ghost
[1:39:35] what realm was he influenced by
[1:39:38] he was influenced by a realm and there
[1:39:40] he gave the inauguration sermon on that
[1:39:43] day and there were men that walked out
[1:39:46] and they criticized him made fun of him
[1:39:49] but when peter got down to it and he was
[1:39:51] preaching christ crucified and christ
[1:39:54] resurrected and he come to it and he
[1:39:56] said this judgment will be upon you
[1:39:59] notice the reaction that was caused by
[1:40:02] the word
[1:40:03] the bible said in acts 2 and 37 men and
[1:40:06] brethren what shall
[1:40:08] we do
[1:40:10] notice these were the same words that
[1:40:12] paul said in acts 9
[1:40:14] what
[1:40:14] what does thou ask me to do jesus
[1:40:20] notice how quickly their language
[1:40:22] changed when they recognized by the
[1:40:25] preaching of the word that they were
[1:40:28] wrong
[1:40:32] men and brethren what shall we do to
[1:40:34] escape this judgment then peter said
[1:40:37] unto thee unto them repent
[1:40:40] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:40:42] name of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:40:44] remission of your sins
[1:40:48] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:40:50] holy ghost for this promise is unto you
[1:40:53] and to your children and to them that
[1:40:55] are far off and it might look like your
[1:40:57] children are afar off
[1:40:59] but there is power in repentance
[1:41:06] brother brandon said that no man is ever
[1:41:09] in a condition to receive the word
[1:41:12] only by the grounds
[1:41:15] of repentance
[1:41:19] you cannot receive the holy ghost
[1:41:21] without repentance
[1:41:23] you cannot live a godly life without
[1:41:26] repentance
[1:41:27] you cannot live an overcoming life
[1:41:30] without repentance but i'll say this to
[1:41:33] you every devil in hell can set a trap
[1:41:35] against the bride of jesus christ but
[1:41:38] there is a way
[1:41:40] to get us out of this mess
[1:41:42] there's a way to get you out of your
[1:41:44] troubles
[1:41:50] but i'm afraid i'll send away my day of
[1:41:52] grace
[1:41:53] get back up
[1:41:58] repent of it
[1:42:01] then this this ain't a negative sermon
[1:42:02] it's a positive sermon
[1:42:04] you might be taking a negativity and it
[1:42:06] might be burning you high just a little
[1:42:07] bit but this is a positive sermon
[1:42:09] you know that brother banham said
[1:42:11] brother branham said that the sins of
[1:42:13] god that the sins of the people would be
[1:42:15] visited the generations up to three to
[1:42:17] four generations he said you look upon
[1:42:19] you he said your mammy your grandmommy
[1:42:22] was a flapper girl and your mama was an
[1:42:24] old curse course girl and he said that's
[1:42:27] why you're striptease today
[1:42:29] he said because the bible said that i
[1:42:32] will visit the iniquity upon the people
[1:42:35] upon them for three to four generations
[1:42:38] he said don't you see what you're doing
[1:42:40] now your children will be judged for
[1:42:46] now this is positive too you can take it
[1:42:48] as negative but this is positive too he
[1:42:50] said oh brother he said how much more on
[1:42:53] that side if we do that much things in
[1:42:55] the wrong how much more is it visited
[1:42:57] unto us if we do the right thing you
[1:43:00] shall reap
[1:43:01] what you sow let me sow some good seeds
[1:43:04] of the baptism of the holy ghost let me
[1:43:07] sow seeds of mercy let me sow seeds of
[1:43:10] grace let me sow cease for more and more
[1:43:13] and more of god
[1:43:16] oh i'd say this christ is worth living
[1:43:19] for
[1:43:24] it's a positive thing
[1:43:29] it's brother andrew i don't want that
[1:43:31] kind of preaching in my home
[1:43:33] i don't want that kind of atmosphere i
[1:43:34] don't want that i don't want that kind
[1:43:36] of pressure on my family let me tell you
[1:43:38] this
[1:43:39] there will come a time in your life
[1:43:41] when you want me
[1:43:48] there's going to come a time in your
[1:43:49] life when you want me to preach this
[1:43:52] there's going to come a time maybe in
[1:43:53] your daughter's life when she's got
[1:43:55] pregnant by some scoundrel out there on
[1:43:58] the street
[1:43:59] that you wished you to listen to my
[1:44:01] voice
[1:44:03] you wished i'd have preached it a little
[1:44:05] bit harder and you bring them to me and

[1:44:26] children what it's like

[1:44:33] live a godly life
[1:44:35] to say god
[1:44:38] i ain't live the best life
[1:44:40] i ain't done all the right things in
[1:44:41] life
[1:44:43] i made the best choices in life
[1:44:46] but god i'm sorry
[1:44:56] ah brother andrea don't apply to me give

[1:45:49] case in all the school
[1:45:52] i went to these brothers
[1:45:54] just high school graduation this year
[1:45:56] and about threw up sitting right there
[1:46:00] it ain't no wonder
[1:46:02] why god spewed the church out of his
[1:46:04] mouth in this generation
[1:46:07] the wicked generation that we're living
[1:46:09] in you better hope that i keep preaching
[1:46:12] the way i'm preaching it's the only way
[1:46:14] that we're going to get out of this mess
[1:46:17] is to preach the same message that paul
[1:46:20] preached that peter preached
[1:46:22] and brother barum stood on that side he
[1:46:24] said well i preached the same thing paul
[1:46:26] preached i've said preach the same thing

[1:47:29] receive
[1:47:33] it's the only way you're going to
[1:47:35] receive
[1:47:36] is to repent
[1:47:38] repent
[1:47:40] or perish
[1:47:43] let me come on those grounds lord
[1:47:46] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:47:49] the word of god
[1:47:51] how shall you hear without a preacher
[1:47:53] don't muzzle the ox

[1:47:57] word
[1:47:58] don't shut it down you need live sermons
[1:48:00] like never before
[1:48:03] need preaching
[1:48:12] the bible tells us he's the high priest
[1:48:15] of our confession
[1:48:18] is that right
[1:48:20] it's time that you turn your mouth loose
[1:48:22] to some confessions

[1:48:26] lord you're my savior lord you're my
[1:48:28] deliverer
[1:48:30] lord you're my healer you're my waymaker
[1:48:33] it's time that you start putting the
[1:48:35] word of god on your mouth that the bible
[1:48:36] tells us in romans 10 that the word of
[1:48:39] god is nigh thee even in thy mouth young
[1:48:42] christians old christians alike fill
[1:48:44] your mouth with the very word of god
[1:48:46] and repent of your sins and confess that
[1:48:49] he's your savior don't be ashamed to
[1:48:51] confess him before men because if you're
[1:48:53] ashamed to confess me before men i'll be
[1:48:56] ashamed to confess you before my father
[1:49:09] i was that one
[1:49:12] i was that one that got caught in a
[1:49:14] thicket out there i was that one that
[1:49:15] couldn't find my way back
[1:49:19] but when the shepherd came looking for
[1:49:20] me
[1:49:23] he threw me over his shoulders
[1:49:32] not with regret
[1:49:34] not with sorrow
[1:49:37] but with rejoicing
[1:49:41] this is your positive
[1:49:43] right here
[1:49:46] i'm that one brother answer i'm the one
[1:49:48] that was chased i'm the one that was run
[1:49:50] after
[1:49:52] let me tell you it was the name of jesus
[1:49:54] christ that stopped the mamba
[1:49:59] how was that one the name of jesus
[1:50:01] christ is stronger than a snakebite the
[1:50:03] name of jesus christ is stronger than
[1:50:05] the curse of sin the name of jesus
[1:50:07] christ is worse is stronger than the
[1:50:10] worst of enemies
[1:50:13] and when the shepherd brought the one
[1:50:16] back in
[1:50:19] what did he do brother nathan
[1:50:21] he gathered all the community he
[1:50:24] gathered all
[1:50:25] of his friends
[1:50:27] he gathered all of his folks that he
[1:50:29] loved
[1:50:31] everybody that knew his business

[1:50:56] give you on repentance
[1:50:58] but the bible said
[1:51:01] in luke 15
[1:51:04] that the angels rejoice in heaven
[1:51:07] over one sinner that repenteth
[1:51:11] but let me preach to you another side of
[1:51:12] things just for a moment
[1:51:15] can you imagine hell
