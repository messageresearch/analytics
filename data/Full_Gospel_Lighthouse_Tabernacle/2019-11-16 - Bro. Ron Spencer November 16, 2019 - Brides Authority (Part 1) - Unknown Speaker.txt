good to be in the house of the Lord I'm brother Ron Spencer I haven't spoke to you for a little while and so [Applause] I would like to thank you for your patience and your sharing we we certainly

daughter being with us her for her first time she so enjoyed that and being with you and interacting with yous she should have loved that with all of her hearts and and we just we just are I've got a quote that I'm going to share with you it comes this time of year and we're coming into winter and and I am sister Connie was we were talking this week and I have a couple speakers here that are lined up for you just before winter and I told her I said it's winter time I said I've got to get all the calves of fact and I got a quote for that and so what I'm doing whether you know it or not I'm getting you spiritually fact you may be on the weight watchers diet but I'm trying to get you spiritually fat so in the spring you'll dance [Applause] hey I'm pretty thrilled about what I've got to speak to you this evening just so honored to be able to speak it to you happy birthday sister Joyce hey man god bless you we love you with all of our hearts we're getting to the point to where we've got more over there than we've got over here so we might as well go over there or you think a man and so where the Shrewsbury told me as a young ministry said now brother Ron ears if it's worth here's what'll happen to you he said as you preach and as you get older you'll have more over there then you've got over here so just might as well go over there so hey man I think that's good I I'm I'm looking for the rapture myself I'll be honest with you I sometimes get up in the mornings and kind of disappointed I'm still in this body man I'm looking forward to that new body and a man I I'll just share something with you last night's a little bit comical but we have an alarm system on our on our on our house and we've actually got 16 cameras on our house and so so we got this one alarm it just kept going off last night and I'd look at it and it looked like an image of a of a man walking and I'd looked at it well at two o'clock in the morning your mind goes every which way in the world and and I and I looked at it I thought I had something tonight I looked at and I kept playing it over and over and over again I look at and look at this looked like a man walking and and this today I figured out it was a spider web but one of these days that cameras going to pick up some people walking [Applause] that's where I'm going with this story it's gonna pick up some cameras some people walk in and they're gonna step from that dimension here and I'm gonna take a step there and we're going to meet the Lord in the air brother BAM said don't you be afraid I'm just let them on in and man a man god bless you god bless you if you would turn with me your scriptures tonight to revelations chapter 12 I'd like to look at you to you this weekend and to speak to you on the bride's authority so I'll get started tonight and find a stop in place and we'll pick it up tomorrow evening I want to read a quote to you as I begin to go and fundamental foundation for faith brother Branham is speaking he says now Jesus said whatever you ask the Father in my name that will I do he said did you ever realize what that means do you realize if we go before God in the name of Jesus I want you to catch this it's just the same as Jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore if I come in his name and he recognizes his name and Jesus said whatever you ask and the father in my name that I do and then I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his spirit praying through me and then I've got to receive what I asked for because he said it and it's God's own word it can't do nothing else but produce just what it said that's enough to close and say a man and say hadn't have been good to be in the house of the Lord revelations chapter 12 and verse 10 and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and not now won't you put yourself in the scripture and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death Psalms 23 it's very familiar to you and I want you to read it with me and we'll read it aloud if you can revelation or Psalms 23 and verse 1 if you don't have in your Bibles just look up there he said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with all my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I want to say do you believe that [Music] you may be seated tonight and may the Lord bless the reading of each word in John chapter 10 and verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut and the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and said to them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side you talking about a meeting that was a meeting there were disciples glad when they saw the Lord I cannot imagine what they felt like because now they had been on the run for a bit and then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me even sinned are you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins here Ament they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained Matthew 16 and verse 13 when Jesus came to the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am power is not in what others say but what is your revelation or you announ want you to catch that power is not what others say but who do you say that I am and he said unto them who say you that I am and Simon Peter answered it said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I also say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ is he's not a second person he's not a third person Jesus is God and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven brother Tim sent me this a couple of weeks ago and spoke to my heart while I was gone and and he just quotes and he just shares this quote with me in 2nd Timothy 3 and 16 Paul states that all Scripture is god-breathed all Scripture is god-breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting training and righteousness this is the only use in the Bible of the Greek the feel of us which means God breathed be inspired by God due to the inspiration of God but other scriptural passages support the basic principle the scripture being inspired by God the Word of God is formed by God's own breath quite a statement in it then it's more than just a book then it's more than just the book he says and when a man speaks it is the kiss life's breath that forms its word and when God speaks through a man it is the life of God the Holy Ghost forming his words as a man speaks as God's Oracle if anyone speaks let him speak as Oracles of God if any one ministers let him do it as a the ability of which God supplies that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom belong the glory and the Dominion for ever and ever I want to read to you because I think we sometimes hear a quote and it just kind of goes over real quickly and it kind of we kind of miss the emphasis of it Jesus said whatsoever you ask the Father in my name that will I do did you ever realize what that means do you realize that that if we go before God in the name of Jesus it's the same as Jesus himself praying that's quite a statement it that makes us all we reevaluate our time in prayer are you with me let's all remember and just in that very just in their very thought context before we go too far in the weekend our time in prayer they're not just idle words what I want you to remember who you are brother John you're a son of God I don't care what the devil whispers in your ear and tells you all different kind of things that that affects flesh and a better spirit how many of you get back sometimes in your flesh in your spirit and he attacks you and he does a lot of different kind of things and uses memory and conscience and reasoning but that will be inside of your soul that's the spot that he can affect and that's his eternal as Jesus is eternal and that seed was predestinated to life before there was ever a moon or a molecule or a Sun before God ever began to speak let there be you was there with God you stepped out of eternity into time may be born in 1961 come to maturity at some point in life well Homer said I probably never get there but as the son of God you begin to recognize where you came from and you realize I'm not leaning on the arm of my flesh I can't hold myself I'm not even going to try to hold on in my spirit to where that I feel it or I can imagine it or all right it's a thought but it's the Word of God it is the anchor to my soul not me holding on it's God holding on to me hallelujah let me just make a statement here got a will not lose one [Music] God's determined you might lose one you might be surprised what you live through and he will not lose one so when you realize who you are you can stand flat-footed throw your shoulders back as a prophet of God would stand there and he would throw his shoulders back and said I take every spirit in this building under my voice under control in the name of Jesus Christ are you with me now remember this the Prophet taught us if Jesus himself was here if Jesus himself was here he could not heal you he's already healed you [Applause] are you with me he's already healed too so you take him at his word and you believe his word do you get sick you'll get sick again you get healed you get sick again last list Jesus raised him up but because of Adam's fall lasher's had to go back to the ground again don't get mad cuz she gets sick again get mad at the devil cuz he's inflicted you again and take it right back to God [Applause] notice these words it's just the same as Jesus praying this is a prophet and he said it isn't me praying anymore if I come in in on his name and he recognizes his name and Jesus said whatsoever you ask in the Father in my name that I do and then I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his Spirit praying through me and then I've got to receive what I asked for because he said it and it's God's own word and he treat do nothing else but produce what he just said so we must become inspired to speak now sometimes a gym you got a ball game today it was cold outside aren't you glad you don't need blankets into bargains and to sit here and listen to me preach now or he wears me but but they get in the spirit of it and they're getting the spirit II you won't enjoy the game unless you get in the spirit of it and that's the way it is when you come to church you gotta you gotta get in the spirit [Music] you gotta get in the spirit on the spirit of shopping at Walmart but you get in the spirit of worshiping the Lord you get beyond yourself and you get beyond your own feelings and get media to get in the spirit of it sometimes your prayers feel like they just go to the ceiling get in the spirit of prayer break through the channel I love that song that was just singing by our young people I want to thank you for taking part in all of that I want to thank brother Andrew and sister Katie and all of them that are involved that's doing that and I thank you for that we got a lot more following and you guys are setting the precedent for them that's following a menu set in a tall order but you summer song about breakthrough but sometimes you just gotta break through yourself the brand said just reminds the meat will come and spring timing I watch the birds building their nest and I think of old mother bird chicken chicken build her nesting get up on it lay her eggs but if that old mother bird hasn't got been with a male bird they'll never hatch them ads no matter how good she treats them how loyal she is it covers them with her wings and turns them over does everything she tended and sat there till she starves them eggs will never hatch if she hasn't been with the male bird they're because they're not fertile that's the way it is with organized religion as long as we take them sinners and they're just sinners into our church and you can baby them and make deacons out of them and marry them four and five times smoke drink gamble cheat lie put them on the Deacons in the church you can hover over them do anything you want to until they come into contact with the mate with Christ Jesus they're only a bunch of rotten eggs that's the reason you must never get your eyes on other human beings because humanity will fail you and if you haven't got a dose of the Holy Ghost in your life and he's not the king of your soul you will disappoint yourself but I've never been disappointed in Jesus here's the quarter wanted to give to you not making you fat so you hang did you pay attention to this one kind of puts me in the mind of a farmer one time you who went and wasn't what's that very much of a farmer he said he he got out a great big nice barns and tractors but the fellow was just too lazy to work lazy people just don't do well around maybe why he wouldn't make no hay puts me in in cuffs mine to some of these big churches and theologians that won't dig down and really take the Word of God they got big churches a lot of music and a lot of refinery but that don't mean that's all he just wouldn't worked and over he was his neighbor had a little old barn over there and he didn't have very much of the stall to keep his cattle in but he sure was an industrious man he really worked he raised great big crops of alfalfa put it in the barn the man had a mission you know and you know it in the wintertime come he said there's a little calf barn each each one of these cats in the barn and the next spring when the spring winds begin to blow they turned those little cats out while this one little calf turned out of this great big Cathedral you know while he was so poor he couldn't hardly stand nothing when almost blowing down why he'd walk out there's a little fella didn't have nothing at all to eat through the winter and he's fed on wigs and he didn't have much strength to stand on no wonder they can't believe in divine healing need of some vitamins well the first thing you know they let that other little calf out over the other barn he was all fat round he had a good alfalfa plenty of vitamins and he was fatten around that wind begin to just hit him and and that mighty rushing wind you know coming down and my he just picked up and jumped boxes and to run all around in the corral just as hard as he could that's what's going on here at this church you've been eating goods that causes you to be that little skinny calf that great out of that great big barn fine barn stuck his head through the crack of the fence it sits fanaticism why under fair that's what's the wrong today with the church it's under nourished Christ that for sinners that you could be free he died to heal the sick it's not fanaticism let the holy spirit strike you one time and and you'll feel like a running and cutting up - yes sir just get some good rich vitamins first from the world of God that's the best vitamin O of this the Word of God now want to caution coming to the time of the year and I don't mean to be sensitive right here we're coming to the time of year everybody wants to slim down I love this time of you cuz there's things that come out of their fridge rater they come all your little now if it cost you an extra mile or two on the treadmill go ahead and get on the treadmill I never didn't like these people that regret what they just ain't oh I shouldn't have a day yeah you you enjoyed that you'd have never put in your mouth that you hadn't enjoyed that [Applause] why do people get on the dot to wear that they just dial all the way down and loose sickness come and just get some sit and get something get some sick you need vitamins in you you don't have Homer here so I might as well take up for this part you need to put some vitamins in there put some vitamins in that body eat some protein in that body these meat of the word I'm blending them two together you hang right there whistling you can't make it on one stale biscuit a week showing up at church wants every moon bloom oh whoa keep you right with God praying when you just need something won't fix the issue you gotta keep on a steady diet to the Word of God in the book eat the whole book [Applause] the man said a truth picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church worried these screaming shouting - acts 2:38 youngins speaking actually 38 youngins around her yeah yeah that they don't want into them whew cleaning and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately be put out of her denomination they had one like that one time in the church that's why they throw her out right quick why you letting sit stuff is that going on you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks they they are it would certainly embarrass her it went around her agitated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out right quick out at the next council she can't happen in because she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth you've heard me tell this before I'll tell you again precious little Christian lady went into the local Baptist Church she didn't have another place to go that put rip that weekend and she went in and there she was set in and back in the back and the preacher said something she said a man the deacon tapped her on the shoulder and said I'm sorry you we don't do that here and so went on a little bit and the preacher said something else and she said hallelujah thank you Jesus Deacon tapped her on the shoulder again and and she and he told us ago we don't do that here after a while she just she just got a little bit of a shot and she twirled around she sat down he was back to her again and said I don't know what's going on what's wrong with you she said I got the Holy Ghost he said you didn't get that he'll back in the time of slavery the slaves would have Church as a man named John got the Holy Ghost and it's so changed if the owner noticed how much did it changed it actually caused him to realize that the God that was in him was not living on the inside of him and you know he got the thirsting for what he had and he said John I want what you got he said I heard your testimony I want what you got he said well you gotta go to the hope in I don't want to take it you get it can't you get it up at my church no what if we go what if we go up here in the barn no you got to be willing to go the hog pen well you've got a few more days and he just got the lingering inside of because that seed was cold I I just got to have it went back to John and John said are you elytis John come but please what I won't have to go there well look you come back to me when you're willing few days pass Bonnie said John I'm ready since you don't have to go the whole pen you just got to be willing [Applause] I want you to understand do not I want Jesus to be the king of my heart not just King when it's convenient but I want him to be king I want him to be king all day all night well um I don't want to do nothing and he would be ashamed to do it with me I don't want no actions I don't want no feelings I do something wrong which is every day I say God forgive me when you do something wrong I think wrong things I have wrong attitudes I must be preaching the right group sometimes I need more of the love of God sometimes I need more forgiveness I need more verses God's mercy never runs out God's forgiveness never runs out his love is never-ending hallelujah hallelujah so if I've got God I've got all him and a God lives only in silently all hallelujah and he's got the reins to my heart I've got God living there the scripture all powers in heaven and earth it's giving it to my hand go and I'll go with you whatever you bind on earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth a loose in heaven if you think it's the moment God has every one of us in different positions of life but it's glad with you sitting at that desk it's God with you doing your job bring the thing you shared something with me he said the scripture said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said I look at that as every patient that I wait on amen I look at that as every patient that I wait on they're hanging between life and death I say this to you and I feel this way I want people to be better off after they meet me I don't know how their eternal outcome will be but I want them to be better off after they meet me because I touch their lives I look back in my life and I look at certain things that God has allowed to be a part of and there's been some incredible special things that he's allowed brother guido that just went to be with the Lord Matthew was standing there when when all of that happened with brother guido Andrew and brother Alden was standing just feet away when I spoke to brother Guido in South Carolina and I called all the preachers for a prayer line I called the preachers to pray for them well that was a different kind of prayer line it's the way I felt to pray that not because if we can get preachers right with God remember pray for the ministry they're just like you all they fight battles and they fight tests don't cease to pray for us just in a few words brother Guido was told that evening said you've got a letter in your in your briefcase and that letter has attacked you pay no attention to it didn't that runt then brother Isaiah Brooks came and then others came and others came there was a sister sitting about work sister Kirsten Zach and God just called her name exactly what was going on told her what was happening in her life who did that God did that that don't make me any bored that don't even buy my coffee are you with me brother man see if you can only realize put your finger in a bucket of water pull it out that's how important you are but God gave gifts into the body could be a blessing to you then then brother guido comes at the end of the meeting and he's coming down I believe was on Friday night and he comes down he comes to the back and and ones are being prayed for behind the curtains and this miracle that miracle that miracle matter your sister was prayed for and and so and so in that and then brother Terry brother Terry brother Joe's brother-in-law he's standing there I've known him in church I've known him for decades and he's just kind of set just one of the good old boys but what it really needed was Jesus let me just say this it's all right to be a good old boy but what good old boys need is Jesus and when he was standing there and he saw all of those things happen and he just melted in that presence and God did a work for him he would find out he had cancer tonight he lays at the point of death without a miracle I want you to know tonight God knew it before he would ever go into battle I turned and brother Dewayne Jackson was standing there with his wife and we begin to pray for them and that boys now preached this first sermon maybe already his second by now been running from the call for 17 years said he preached an hour his first sermon and said it was a glorious service by the way brother Tim Pruett somebody told him the other day said showed him a quote that brother Branham said just preach 45 minutes and he said well that's nice let me show you a quote brother Branham said that I can preach to believers all night long so he said what I'm gonna do for you is about after 45 minutes I'll just dismiss the unbelievers brother guido steps up i begin to speak to him and I said ghido and he's a friend I said greedo's brother guido trouble lays right in your path and I said and I also say there's someone that's going to call you a liar but you know the truth then I begin to speak to him there's a train coming for you there's a train coming for you don't you be afraid to get off it'll be okay well the ghido grabs me up sister Stephanie you told sister Connie today I had it in my notes but you told sister Connie today she went back and listened to the last sermon that I preached here before I was gone away for two weeks and then back for brother Jason's and I spoke her brother Guiteau and held that brother Homer called him jido this morning Joshua his son you know you just think I want to I want to do this right here just for somebody that might be criticizing me for going I want to just take care of this right here right now how important one meeting is how important one meeting is I don't think I have too many critics here but I'll just take care of it and I'm walking off of the platform in Switzerland and as I'm walking over the platform I walk by Joshua and Joshua hit guiteau's son is standing there and he's standing right here and he's a good-looking man and he's standing there and he's just standing with his hands like this I'll never forget he had his hands like this and he's one you ever seen those people with those perfect bodies he looked like he's a male male model just just a really good-looking man and he's just standing like this right here and he's just standing there operating this a deacon and I walked by and I said and I just stepped back to him and I said and what you're asking for tonight is a supernatural experience with God you're a believer but you're asking for God to come on the scene and supernaturally touch your life and I pray for him and he just went right in the floor on another night I walked past Joshua this would be a couple years later and I walked past him you know these stories you've heard him over and over and I walk past Joshua and I turned to her and I said Jacque you up the same God that spoke to me a few years ago about you needing the Holy Ghost is telling me now that you're a preacher and you're caught for purpose and they walk I want just a few feet I walked just a few feet and brother ed Bisco has run around the building and he's standing there and he's got a situation to which I can't go in tonight but he'd spent 12 years trying to get a piece of real estate something to be taking care of lawyers in many places Toronto Ontario British Columbia and I'm talking about high-end lawyers to try to get it settled 12 years he did everything if you do to get it settled and he was that he sweats in now I'm not getting settled before my my departure I gotta get this settled and he said he was sitting in that service sister Cassie you wrote the song too what will you be remembered for I preached that sermon the first time in Switzerland what will you be remembered for and he's listening to that service and he said that's not brother Ron that's God and he said I said in that presence and in his horizon of the Sun setting just in the office on the platform and sitting in a chair watching brother Brennan preach and he said I recognize that presence that's him not leave him and he ran around the building and and he and he clocked me just before I went out and and he cried Minh said a brought his daughter Linda and his wife sister Ruth and he just said to have a need and just said a few words and we went to prayer and the words that were prayed in that prayer gave him specific instruction in 90 days it was over with was that service important that same Joshua sent me a note this morning and it was a song I sent it to my family but the German you may be able to show it tomorrow evening before service it's about to train the journey of your life and he sent it to his entire family just before going to North Carolina when I watched that I thought I'm sitting there and tears just started running out of my eyes I remember sitting on a train with Dido Gaeta was like brother Homer he just took off and all I did was follow his white head I seem to get lost going through the tunnels of the trains of Europe and but I just I just follow him he never looked back he was like Homer he never looked back homers always way out in front of you and you was doing your best to keep up and and that was the way Guiteau was Guiteau was a man's man like brother Homer is a man's man I think man ought to be real men there was two kids with us I was trying to keep them up one was from Arizona and one was from New Zealand and they're with us and they got their bags they've they've just been at the same meeting we've been at one is a backslidden preacher's son er a backslidden boy grandson of brother Derek Donaldson and he's there and the cruise line that he worked for had sent him to Switzerland for four for a training session and he had the weekend off so he came to the meeting he was making his way back toward New Zealand really had not got a supernatural touch through the meeting just things that begin to kind of come together he was sitting with this girl and she's looking for her place and one of them's going to set with me one's going to set with brother Dido and as we're arranging herself on the train I said no you two need to set together and you need to you need to know each other you need to learn who each other is because you're gonna need it for this life journey those two kids got married brother Roy they came to your house and made a phone call to me you remember those kids God knows it's a great big world but it's really small you say goddess if God sends you he'll take care of you sorry I got sidetracked there for a moment here's what I want to tell you and all of that in guiteau's last meeting he sent me the picture of one of the orphan girls that was in the orphanage that when he went there and one of those little children walked up and said I really want to go home and he said honey if you pray Jesus will give you a let me remember him telling that story here yeah I know he was difficult to understand but English was his second language third language fourth language and he did his best for us and and he said honey if you'll pray and the people came to him said you can't promise that they'll go home he say I'm telling you God's going to empty this orphanage and he began to pray and he prayed for every one of them because Oliver wanted to go home and families to come back to him and one by one families came to get children and emptied that entire orphanage in Siberia with me listen those train rides were incredibly difficult he wasn't riding in first class four days on a plane is a long time coal trains on his last meeting one of those girls is there and he takes a picture and he sends it to me and he said brother Ron here's one of the girls from the orphanage and he just says what is the chance she'd be in one of my meetings I like those odds in one of those services there was a girl that said I want a horse and I am and and and she said I think I'm going to write President Putin and see if he'll give me a horse she said I'm gonna go the highest authority I can't afford one I can't afford to buy one maybe he'll give me one and whether they don't owner said you're a daughter of God just ask and she said the President of Russia said the President of Russia letter this is a girl that can't the tech can't can't afford to buy one but she's a daughter of God and she sends the President of Russia a letter and I got the printer at home she's standing there with that big black horse all I know is God spoke to that man to take that horse and give it to that little girl because a man named Dido inspired her that she would take God's Word and ask what you will and it shall be done unto you glory to God glory to God authority clarity with character I'm sorry I'll get off of it just a moment but you remember the last time that he walked at this pulpit he got down on his knees and he said I've came all this way let me remember he got down on his knees he raised his hands at God and he said I came here to be prayed for I don't know why I'm here but I'm here the first time he came here the Lord spoke to me that don't have him preach he's not physically able having testified and he testified for two hours how many how many remember that service on Monday we went up on the Shenandoah Valley and we were sitting at big matters and was out on there was I don't know the the the we're overlooking we're overlooking what's that Lodge and we're overlooking though not Scotland we're at big medicine - big meadows lunch we're on that deck for lack of a better term where you can look through those things and we're standing on the rails and we're standing there and gido he just kind of goes back like this he put his hammer his head and he said other Ronnie I have one question I've always wanted to ask I've always wanted to ask a man like you I've got one question one and he said this one question I've always been afraid to ask I know I I just need to ask somebody and he just it's just I mean Who am I and I said you know let's just let's just sit down here just for a moment because I could tell it was a very serious moment and we just sat down in the chairs and he's sitting here and I'm sitting there and my knees touching his meeting and I said before you go home brother Guido let me tell you what your question is you were there and I told you though what he's question was can you be forgiven for a certain situation and I said ghido just to let you know it's God and I'm not reading your mind I said your best friend his name was Eddie he went my god like I'd like my God my God my God and I said you're forgiven Guiteau the blood of Jesus Christ forgave you are you with me oh my god to drop that by what authority do you do these things God dropped hope that was all right other than the Senate and the gospel isn't word only but through power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit which would produce the signs of mark 16 when he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them the word itself is dead until it becomes an action comes into an action and produces life this can lay on your on your table at home and it can lay there dead until you bring it to life it wasn't me that can lay there dead until you bring it to life brother Chris that's not going to come back and rapture this he's not going to come back and wrap through this in the tribulation periods when the new world when the world is burned up diesel these will be a part of all of that and go back to their chemicals this is what he's coming to rapture [Applause] revelations 3 in verse 12 to him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down from out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to you revelations 3 and 20 behold I stand at the door and lock and If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and brother Brandon when he preaches these scriptures he goes through the whole church Ages when he comes to these scriptures Jesus is on the outside of the door and he said the denomination's has put him out how did they put him out with their creeds and the dogmas don't want to ask you by what authority did he do that they still got their big churches they've got their programs but God's prophet stood there like Amos stood and wept over Jerusalem like David stood there like the Prophet stood there and declared the Word of God and then God vindicated the word I listened to a service today I brother Andrew and I listened to one yesterday there are certain parts of it as brother branham was preaching i'd say if you were sitting in some of those churches you probably felt like hello things was getting right up in here are you with me but that wasn't just a man speaking God was using that vessel and he was speaking a bride into existence and by that authority we take the Word of God and we preach it and it becomes alive inside of you are you with me not that we're bringing you a new thought or a new revival or a new beginnings but we're delivering the word unto you and stirring up your line by remembrance and that word has authority to you and it becomes the life you remember brother Branham would tell about a police officer kind of reminds you of Barney Fife how that he will he will talk about it said he's so skinny can hardly hold his his close up and he walks out there he said that man physically puts his hand out he couldn't stop a bicycle but because he has on a badge he's got the authority of the entire city hall and all the government of that city he puts his hand up in the biggest bus in the city comes to a screeching heart because he has authority and because you're a son of God sure other people have trouble sure other people have problems sure other people have victories in their life but because you're a son of God that ever comes into your home and he starts burning it up recognize what's going on this is the devil I rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke him and you stand and you take the word and you begin to shout and you magenta listen you don't have to take everything that comes along I remember one day that stands out in my mind brother Homer we were working we got that little red tractor that were that actually later would run over him we should have burned up tank but anyway the back tire was flat to fix that go up the road and I'm riding with him and front tire goes flat he just goes around he looks at that tire he said I'm gonna tell the devil one thing he's not going to destroy my day he's not gonna destroy my joy he just started speaking there we are one problem another problem and he just spoke to it I thought that's one good way to do it here where are you with me now listen not every day you can feel the Holy Spirit brooding down over top of you and see the pillar of fire an angel standing around hey you're just living natural life you live in life and in life you overcome by the blood of the Lord underwater you'll catch the bone [Applause] brother on but I felt it up did you fall 14 times and they get up 14 times out there but that devil why listen to their death the devil keeps whisper why would you even listen to him brother on I hate all this political nonsense that's going on in the work don't listen you know what if you don't listen it won't matter if you don't plug into what they're spilling out it will not affect your day whatsoever what Rob's doomed impeachments doing all that kind of stuffs do lil roni she's got me toward quit listening they're gonna do what they're gonna do but it will not affect the rap Chuck [Applause] brother on I have so many ups and downs one

we won't need you tomorrow come on church but I like people when they go on their knees or understanding at the take at the table and they're praying and they pray and you can tell they've been talking to God yes I want to finish with this help me remember that woman in Memphis where's Matthew Matthew come right here brother I'm sorry to take too long brother Jason Jackson told me called me one day and he said brother Ron pray for my daddy he's gone into cardiac arrest go to prayer for my daddy right now got on our knees and went to prayer for brother Jason's daddy I knew him well I'd

want you to preach the funeral I said I've already told Connie that I'd be the preacher of your daddy's funeral and I'd be gone this weekend I'll be there we drove 17 hours but on the way down I went through Memphis because Matthew had never been in that part of the world and so we went my Bass Pro that's Pro and lymphocytic ear to me it's all glass and at the top they got a restaurant up there and they got a balcony that you can go out and walk around there take pictures if you walk through I will be much longer but right down the street right down the river there's a white tank and that white tank is right butts near where that woman prayed where's my Elisha and [Applause] I asked Matthew the question while he was standing looking at that area I said wonder why they had to put a pyramid here of all the places in the world why did they put a glass pyramid right here with a capstone on it where the prophet of God walked [Applause] [Music] now here's what brother branham told

and she went walking he'd never been in that country and I wouldn't even see where brother man walked and look where the prophet of God went down folks just ain't no myth they say something that's made up I'd like to ask the man that put the pyramid there work on the inspiration for you to put a pyramid with the capstone here of all the places in the world why'd you put it here she wasn't in the king's castle she wasn't in a great big place she was in the shanty she didn't know who he was but she prayed where's my Lodge at don't tell me - not that you don't have power with God brother Ron
