========================================

hey man is that your confession to the Lord you give yourself away amen glory to God it's good to be the house of the Lord once again to see each and every one of you you know we've only I've only missed a couple of weekends but I feel like it's been even longer than that and the sister Bella's still at home so appreciate all the prayers for her she's doing really good she's just still kind of recovering and the baby's doing well and thank you all so much for the prayers and we just can't express just everything y'all done what it means to us all the way from you know from from the baby shower to troll the gifts the prayer the food and keeping the children and and everything like that I'm back and forth we just love y'all each so much and we appreciate y'all you know the brother branham said that the nicest thing you can say the most beautiful words is God bless you because he said if God will bless me he said what else more do I need so from the bottom of our hearts we say god bless you I could go on and on about what that means to us but god bless you and may he restore a hundredfold to you for everything that you've done we appreciate y'all we appreciate our church family you know I told about all the boys here you know I said you know I'm not man enough to be a mom I'm not and I'll admit it being a being a mother is hard work and it's not just a birth it's the reason but you know God has the special blessings from others you know as you raise your children and you know and everything like that you you you pastor them brother Ram teaches us and you raise them in the admonition of God and when they grow up you know they'll live for God even if they're straight you know I came from a big family and I remember as a child I'd be out playing and my mom would call us in she'd call us in and she'd pray you know sometimes there's a child when you tell him about the Lord it may not seem like it sinks into him too much they're playing and you try and tell them or they'll ask you a question and and you try and say something about the Lord may seem like it all don't sink in maybe they'll just say something but you know you're sowing seed you're sowing seed and that young tender young tender life and every child comes into this world as a blank slate and it's our job as parents to show that word above anything so that word because as the Bible says when they get older it won't depart from Amen so we're not gonna keep you standing by god bless Sean we love y'all with all of our hearts and preciate y'all and appreciate the opportunity to speak if you will turn with me to 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 Thank You musicians thank you brother Matt for the wonderful song service second Corinthians chapter three so lengthy reads so I'll try and read rather quickly the Bible says do we again do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some other epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you're manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything is of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of Israel cannot steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the administration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more death administration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that Excel ahthe for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use such great plainness of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face at the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for unto this day remain at the same fell untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord amen let's bow our heads and our hearts to Congress as Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful the Lord and honored for this opportunity to come in your presence and Lord Jesus as we come father we've come to make you the center of this service we've come to exalt you we've come Lord to look into your word Lord and see where we fall short Lord and where we can draw closer to you I pray that you minister to each and every heart lord I pray that you minister healing to those that need healing may you minister salvation to those that need salvation may administer deliverance to those who need deliverance or need in a way that only your Holy Spirit can we loving we commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen she may be seated in the presence of the Lord amen you know les last weekend as I said we weren't able to be here but we certainly enjoy streaming the services and I know that y'all had a wonderful time here with brother Tim and you know Sunday he I believe he preached on atmospheres and how important it was to come and set the right atmosphere and and he might have brought an atmosphere of a two-hour sermon so if it's a little lengthy I pray that you just forgive me but we'll just trust the leading of the Lord y'all pray for me amen I want to start with the title this this evening is mama that's me that's the title title of the sermon with the help of the Lord now I want to begin with a quote because you know God's Word is a mirror like we just read in the text so if we want to see what God wants of us we got to look into his word and when we're christ-like and we look into the word it should reflect back the character of Christ brother Aaron says a little boy one time down here in Kentucky raised up in the mountains he had never been around where there was a lookingglass they had a little piece tacked up on a tree but he had never seen himself he come here to Louisville it was told and stayed with his mother's sister and she lived in one of the nice homes an old-fashioned home that went into one of the bedrooms had a door that had a mirror all up it the way all the way up and down the door and a few brothers don't have a few single brothers don't have that any I was homey I wait y'all get married it's coming and when the little fella started running all through the house he stopped little Johnny saw little Johnny C and he scratched his head and little Johnny in the mirror scratched his head he laughed a little and Johnny in the mirror laughed he jumped up and down and little Johnny jumped up and down in the mirror see he walked up real close he thought it was a little boy he could play with and so he walked up directly he picked on the glass he turned around and his parents were watching him he said mama that's me he said mama that's me so I want us to note here that this was a full-length mirror the mirror was on the door and the door is Christ now you say brother William you're reading too much into that quote that's a little too much let me read a part of another quote where the Prophet said I have to preach one of the most powerful sermons he's ever preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed he's preached he preached that sermon and forgave it he took the whole Bible as his text and at the end they're singing and they're praising the Lord he says so I just wondered today I'm sorry he goes down and he says not knowing of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this God knows it but if you turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock the end of the second poll the third poll is at hand and the prophet of God took that sign right off a clock and he said see if your spiritual you watch spiritual things so that this mirror that it sounds like it was even really random himself because when he gives his life story says how his daddy used to shave off of just a piece of a mirror so when his dad would shave you could only see a part of yourself and as we've come through the his string coming down through the church ages of the bride there was a town where they only had a part of the word and they could only see a part of their reflection but there comes a time where that mirror is now a full-length mirror and the Bride of Christ can look at her reflection in the mirror of God's Word and make sure she's dressed right to make sure she talks right to make sure she lives right to make sure she's ready for the rapture this is God's full-length mirror and it's on the door Jesus Christ because you know when Luther Luther was one of the messengers he was in the right hand of God but do you know that Luther drank beer do you know that Luther was not too fond of Jews they didn't understand that God had a blinded juice to make a way for you but they only understood in part because the book was still sealed but God has allotted us this day a full-length mirror when Wesley come along the mirrors a little bigger they can see a little more all Luther could see was the just shall live by faith but as as the bride progressed she's able to see more and now we're able to see in fullness now the Bible is not just the book the Bible is not just a book of do's and dont's the Bible do you know the secret the Bible is actually a family album the Bible is a family album that you can go back and find your picture now now to understand spiritual things a lot of times God teaches as the Prophet says that God teaches us spiritual things by natural occurrences because we're human and that's how we understand things that's how we see God in creation that's how we see God in many ways is through natural things so if you'll bear with me I'll get a little bit in the natural to bring about a spiritual application I come from a big family a family of 13 children and I'm number 12 yes now let me just say this I'm not trying to catch up to them I'm not trying to catch up to them I'm pie praise the Lord but I appreciate a big family it's wonderful but you know as a bore LaVon I can go get the family album and I can look right through that family album even before I was born now I wasn't born till 1983 but yet I could look my parents used to be Romanian so I could look into the family album and see that was before I was born but I'm denta fide with them when they were in another country way across the sea I turned a few more pages oh this is when they went to Italy for three months waiting to be clear to come in America okay this is 1979 this is when they landed see the family album is beginning to to develop I'm able to look well that there comes a time when I've got to find my own picture in there if I'm in the family I've got to find my own picture in there so there comes a time whenever oh there's a picture my mom she was pregnant with me there's a picture of me in the hospital there's a picture of me when they brought home there's a picture of me as I was walking and you're able to identify yourself within the family album and this is God's family album and you're able to look back and say that is when brother Adam and sister evil put it to flesh this is where brother Adam and sister Eve disobeyed and they were taken out of the garden it was before you were born but you're identified in that you're identified in that this is when my brother Noah built an ark this is when they rejected his message this is when my brother Joseph was rejected of his brother and he was cast into a pit this is when my brother Joseph was exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh this is where my brother Moses called for plagues and delivered Egypt and your going on down this is where sister my sister Miriam danced when her enemy was dead on the seashore this is where it was this is the family album I wasn't born yet but I can see it in the scripture and I can identify with it because I'm of the same family and I can say mama that's me Miriam danced over her enemies and we danced over our dead enemies mama that's me we look in God's mirror and we see the same thing we see brother Abraham oh he was an important brother we see what God did for him we see sister Sarah sister Rahab we see brother David we see how he slew Goliath we see when our daddy became flesh that's the most beautiful part of the scripture we see when our daddy became flesh and we seen how they rejected him we've seen how he's crucified and as you go through the family album and he flipped through it you see it getting closer to when you were born you see it getting closer to the age that you were born now the way we know that that the way I know that I am in my natural family is I can identify myself in the family album and I bear the natural characteristics of my parents and my siblings so we as the children of God should be looking into the family Alba and you've got to find your picture in there it's not enough to find Jesus's picture it's not even enough to find brother branham's picture there in there because why they're in the family but you have got to find your own individual picture in here that is equivalent to finding your name in the book and when you find your name in this book when you find your picture in God's family album no devil in Hell can ever take it out no Dylan Hill could ever talk to you that you're not a child a son or a daughter of the Lord Jesus Christ because why you found your picture you'd say saying I'm right here I'm right here and you can't do nothing about it you're in God's family album you're in God's album now if you can't find yourself and give the family album that means you have spiritual amnesia when you cannot when you flip through your family album God's family album and you can't identify yourself that means you have spiritual amnesia just like when someone gets amnesia and they don't recognize who their parents are anymore they don't recognize what family they belong to because they have a condition called amnesia in this generation brother branham diagnosed the entire generation with spiritual amnesia and that's why God sent a prophet to be able to get the scales off of our eyes that we actually are a part of God and that brother Alden you can be no more destroy than God can that's a part of God that is being an attribute of God when the prodigal son left in the New Testament the Bible says that he came to himself he was out in the world he was eaten with the pigs but bRILINTA he one day he came to himself he said wait a minute I'm over here and I would love to eat with the pigs Arion and my servants in my father's house is he and much better than them i'ma go and submit myself and see if they'll at least take me as a servant he came to himself and that's what every child of God has got to do are out in the world they're out in the Pigpen of the world they're out in sin and they think that that's life but one day you come to yourself you come to yourself and you realize this ain't my food I'm not supposed to be a chicken I'm not supposed to eat them eat out of the manure pile of the world I was an eagle and I was born to fly what is that your skills fall off your eyes brother branham hath to realize one day that he was not the son of Charles and Ella Branham he had to realize that he was come from another parent and that's the same revelation that we must each and every one of us get now I want to talk about a type versus the anti-type brother Graham said he was a typology every child of God is a type all just because that is where you find your pictures and the types and shadows that is how brother Brian was able to preach now a type the people in the Bible that you read do you realize that they type you do you realize that you are actually the anti-type of the types of the Bible do you realize brother on that you that brother David typed you do you realize brother Andy that Shamgar typed you you don't type them they type you you're not pointing to them they're pointing to you that's the difference so the anti-type is a person or thing that is foreshadowed or represented by a type or symbol especially a character or event in the New Testament prefigured in the Old Testament brother Branham said if there's an anti-type there's got to be a type for that anti type to come from and everything I say that is true has a type it has a type you have a shadow on the Bible said the old things was a shadow of new things to come you don't type Rebecca Rebecca types you they were living out their lives in the natural speaking of who was to come the prophets in the Old Testament type Jesus Christ Jesus Christ didn't come to type them they were pointing to him so if the bride is part of the bridegroom if God is in the Bible this so is the bride so is you don't ever let say and tell you that it's only that the Bible is only you can only find God and the prophets in there where was Eve the Eve was in the side of Adam so if Eve is a part of Adam then where Adam is Eve is you have just as much right you are going you are co-equal with Jesus Christ co-equal now this message that we have isn't just a Reformation this message that we have isn't just an ideology to be a better person to be a good neighbor this message is Jesus Christ himself the Bible says that the Lord Himself descended from heaven with a shout this message is not just a Reformation this message is not just restoration of gifts this message is him it is him that is why the rapture didn't happen through the church ages it couldn't it's the full grain is the seed the very seed that went into the ground is now ripened on the end because that is where do you find the seed in the fruit if you have no idea what a peach seed looks like bite into a peach and eat it all the way to the seed and that's where you have it that is why the Ministry of Jesus Christ is duplicated in this endtime exactly as he had it because we're we're back in seed form it's harvest time you don't harvest you don't harvest a shuck you don't harvest at the tassel you don't harvest the stem you harvest the wheat so if we're in a harvest time there's got to be some wheat in maturity staying in the presence of the Sun getting humbled getting all the greenness and in maturity baked out so we are tight by Bible characters they were the shadow Jesus was reality and so is the bride now when Jesus came remember he came as anti-titan and Jesus had to find where it was written of himself brothers and sisters that that is so powerful it can never be it can never be overstated to be able to stand so pat on the word that you know exactly what's written of you and you know exactly where you belong Satan can't move you Satan couldn't move Jesus Christ from what at the position he held in hebrews 10:7 then said i he's quote Paul is quoting David there lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will O God now listen to this quote the Easter still brother M says now as a promised Messiah he quickened every word that was prophesied that he would do heal the sick and how he was born of a virgin all that made it is true he was a word manifested here on earth but he could not do this just as a man it taken the Spirit of God dwelling in him to quicken these promises to him so Jesus was a man he was a god man but as a man he would open up the scrolls and he'd read the word but it took the Spirit of God to say this is you this is you Jesus read the Saint the Book of Jonah just like you read it but when joke when Jesus read Jonah he said Papa that's me and he could proclaim destroy this temple but in three days I'll raise it up why because Jonah because the life of Jonah and what David wrote sinners saved by God's grace Jesus based he was God think about this he based such a statement upon what a man wrote he said destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up God didn't come down from heaven as necessarily speak to him in a vision he read it in the word that's where he read it he interpreted the word for his own day and hour and he's able to say as it were mama that's me that's how he was able to do that brother Ram says as a man he couldn't it took the spirit of God in him to quicken him to that word now he goes on to say I hope that we get this real clear now Jesus being a man himself but it took the spirit in him the spirit it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he's the one that does the works he Jesus himself was the word further down he said so then that was God's promise all the way from the Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here he was that man born of a virgin but it taken the Spirit of God to quicken that word to him so if it took the Spirit of God to quicken that word to him it takes the Spirit of God to quicken the word to us because we're a part of him and then it gives you faith to stand in the face of Satan himself right upon this word and say it is written we're gonna get to in a minute but jesus said this that is written is yet to be accomplished to me when he was at the Passover this that is written Jesus knew what was written what was fulfilled what is being fulfilled and what will be fulfilled do you realize Bride of Christ you're the only church on the earth that can do that to this capacity to be able to look back all the way the Garden of Eden before the Garden of Eden before God was God before God was God you were there no other church could go back before God was God yeah you go so far back in the mind of God before even angels born before even Satan was born you were there you were there because you have the same capacity that he does you had no matter how young or old or what your background is a child with the Holy Ghost can open this word and you have the same authority that Jesus Christ had you have the same you can apply in the same way it's not your prophecy to be born of a virgin but it's your prophecy to change it's your prophecy to be healed it's your prophecy to defeat the Satan and overcome later I'll see ya that prophecy is given to you you've got to recognize that you've already been seen as an overcomer it taken the Spirit of God to quicken that word to Jesus let's think of Jonah for a while Jonah had to be in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights now I would imagine humanly speaking that Jonah learned his lesson really quick he learned his lesson really quick but he had to stay in that if you'll forgive me thinking belly for three days and three nights now some of you I know some of you brothers hunt and when you're dressing a deer and you accidentally Nick that stomach it'll make his hunk on three-forty smell like a bouquet of roses let me tell you he was yet he was in that program said that God provided an oxygen tent for him and yet he had to stay there for three days and three nights because he was living out a prophecy he was naturally living it out and we're gonna go through examples in the Bible where people were naturally living hard circumstances for your benefit they were living it out it seemed everyday Ellie's or was just going to get a wife for Isaac but yet it spoke of prophecy it spoke of a volume and spoke of a mass of people called out in the end time represented about one mayor geniune so Jonah had to be in the belly of that whale for three days and three nights to represent him being in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights he couldn't come out any sooner and do you know that Jesus himself could not have arisen he was God he could not have risen any any quicker than within three days brother Graham said he was barred by the scripture brother Matthew there was literally to their that Jesus couldn't cross their scripture there that God cannot cross God is held accountable to his own word think about that that's the kind of God we serve that when he says something he holds his own self accountable to that that's the God that we were that's the God we serve for that would not suffer my soul to be in hell that will not leave my soul in Hell neither without suffer thine Holy One to see corruption jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up so as I said the prophets the Saints the patriarchs of the Old Testament had to go through very unpleasant things to type you you're enjoying the spiritual benefit of their hardship in the natural when they were starving when they were being sawed asunder and now you're enjoying a reaping the benefits we're enjoying a reaping the benefits of what this caught this message costs brother branham the time it caught it costs away from his family the time that it costs him the agony the things he had to deal with it came at a heavy price the Gentile widow woman was starving with her son in the Old Testament there but yet she was calling and producing my god to entertain Elijah but yet whenever her whenever she looked at her son and she'd see him starving it it looked like a wonderful thing there was a drought no rain or Dew of three years and yet God sent her a prophet and she sustained him and as she and now she and her house heavy in many days and we've got spiritual food in due season her husband died her son was starving it wasn't fun but that was the age that she lived that out in the natural so you can benefit in the spiritual Absalom he had to rise against David why because he was foreshadowing something a David had to be rejected he had to go up that same Hill brother on and crying as he was a rejected game because he was foreshadowing the son of David so brother branham came as Malachi 4:5 he had to be identified in the scripture in Moses and Elijah and Joshua but you know brother Aaron was the anti-type Joshua would go in here to conquer natural land but we're conquering greater spiritual land so where you find the bridegroom you're gonna find the bride you can't separate God from his word you can't separate the bride from the word you can't separate the bride from him from Jesus Christ oh no injustice 221 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up his flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man she's called bride because she's taken from the bridegroom she is him in st. power same Authority same work same faith same love she's him she's Jesus Christ on the earth do you realize that tonight the bride of Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ on earth in bright form now listen he says and as he being the groom the bride has come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be manifested of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride it can only be made manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and the woman taken from his side she has taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife remember when Jesus was on earth he was able to say search the Scriptures for in them he spoke to the world to the religious world of his day he said search the scriptures in these scriptures you think you have eternal life but in fact they are they that testify of me that's what he said but do you know the bride has the same testimony search the scriptures these denominations they think they have eternal life and these scriptures are testifying of who we are that we're here Lord Ram's said that the bride is a manifestation of this our brother Steven the fact that we're here we're a manifestation of God's Word and he said also this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now as I said people can find Jesus in the Bible and people can flip right to where brother Branham is but can we flip to where we are remember this is God's album can we look in here and God's mirror and say mama this is me where it scratches his head we scratch ours we look into God's Word and we see our reflection and we're changed from glory to glory on the road to emmaus brother M says watch here the word itself remember Jesus was resurrected and I want us to understand that this that this message is the exact duplication is an exact type of the resurrection of Jesus Christ remember brother and says in the days of Luther is just a rumor and the days of Wesley a little more but then now he's proved it and he's walking along and he begins to open his preach and all about himself and as he's walking to Cleopas and his friend on the road to Emmaus they're all bummed out because they thought that Jesus was gonna do this and Jesus should restore the Kingdom of Israel and he should have done this but he's crucified what are we gonna do Peter said I'm going fishing I don't know what's going on this ain't working out like we thought and they're on the way to Emmaus and Jesus steps out and Jesus begins to he said why are you so sad and he begins to tell them and Jesus said you know he began to tell him are you are you a stranger here don't you know what's happened and she said what's happened and then Jesus begins to to tell him and Britain the Bible says that beginning at the prophets when Moses he expounded all scripture concerning himself that's what it was all about all the scripture is he did exactly brother Andrew what the scripture said he do the disciples were bummed and he was crucified and laid him in a tomb and he came along and he told them this is exactly what the word said what happened to me so whenever he got him shut in he did something that was very very familiar to them the way he broke that bread the disciples realized that's him the way the prophet of God preached this sermon the way he discerned the thoughts of Sarah's hearts the way he did things the bride realizes that's him that's not a man that's Jesus Christ using the vessel of a man and how do how do we recognize Jesus Christ brother Nathanael in this message the way he broke bread rather Davey the way he breaks the bread of eternal life is how we recognize him that's him that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Aaron says watch here the word itself quoting the word of himself the word itself quoting the word of himself now I'm gonna just pause there let that sink in Jesus Christ was the word and he was able to get the word and he was the Word made flesh and he's able to to quote the word the word was quoting the word about himself the bride is supposed to do the same thing when the church world hasn't heard don't believe in miracles and don't believe in the things of God and they always look to Jesus on the cross we have him alive in our midst walking in our midst breaking the bread just as he always did but we've got to recognize it we've got to as the word made flesh we're quoting the word the word quoting the word concerning herself just as he did because she is him same power same authority but you've got to have the Holy Ghost to do this not to tell them that he was that but just let the word speak for itself what was it that Jesus said the works speak if you don't believe me believe the works they speak for it for who I am but just let the word speak for itself when they then they know who he was the letter of the word quoting the the word in flesh program says the word in flesh quoting the word of the letter being fully identified in himself do you realize the wonderful blessing it is to be able to flip to in God's family album and find your picture that confirms that you're a child of God you don't need flesh and blood to confirm your child of God God confirms your child of God he's the one if I've got his approval that's all I need if you have his approval that's all you need God's approval do you know whenever the angel of the Lord met brother Branham in the cave that night and brother Graham began to make excuses as Moses be given remember Moses made excuses about how bad he stammered and about the people aren't gonna listen to him brother branham and that same spirit made the same excuses and the angel of the Lord took brother Branham where to the scriptures he said as Moses was given to science you'll be given to science and that in that video 20th century prophet brother Aaron says that he not only gave him about Moses he told him about Nathaniel and Philip he told him about the woman at the well and if you notice he's always using them examples on tape because he it's not his message he's given that message out and he's doing exactly what the angel told him to do so the angel of the Lord took God's prophet William and Branham to the word and show him this is where you fit in as Moses they did this to Moses as Moses had two signs you're gonna have two signs as Moses called the people out in the first Exodus you're gonna call the people out in the third axis it was God's God showing brother branham his picture in the Bible now in Genesis 5:24 the Bible says that in anak walked with God and he was not for God took him now as we go through these scriptures I want you to say to yourself or out loud however mama that's me Enoch was the seventh from Adam we're in the seventh church age from the second Adam and God translated Enoch being the seventh from Adam and he's going to translate us being in the seventh age from Adam see and he can say mama that's me I'm the seventh from the second Adam you see yourself in God's album Enochs revelation so please God you know brother Aaron say there were three Bibles one was in the stars one is in the pyramid and one is here Enoch in mystery form built the pyramid and he wrote God's second Bible and it's so pleased god of his complete revelation that God raptured him and I mentioned earlier that the bride on earth now has got something that no other age has ever had that she can see from before God was God all the way to will never would gather back again in the Garden of Eden and it's gonna so please God that God is going to change you in the Adams brother Shannon it so pleases god of your revelation it so pleases god of how you walk to this word and your love toward the word and your attitude for the word that god will literally change you in the atoms and how do you know because you've already been typed you're the anti-type Enoch was raptured as one individual the bride will be will be raptured as a multi-member body from around the world mama that's me when milk hesitant compared to Abraham and remember brother Branham was so clear and direct he'd preach about milk hesita keep preaching about Abraham and then he turned around just like this and he'd say I'm gonna turn my back to the audience and do the exact same thing and people still miss it you talk about spiritual amnesia people still miss it how many times have you have you heard him say on tape he talked about the hams and God changing the name and he said now Graham means father nations and he's got six letters but Abraham has got seven letters and he'd leave you hanging just like that he wasn't say bran ham has seven letters too that was for you to catch and he say six is the number of man but seven is God's number and Abraham God gave him literally gave him part of his name mama that's me coming out of an exodus applying the token mama that's me we're in Goshen the world is under judgment under place mama that's me we've got the token apply we've got the lamb killed we're eating we've got we've got or we've got our shoes on ready to go staff in the hand nothing lead nothing to hold us here mama that's me we received God's message and we've got that scarlet scarlet thread that Rahab lay right on the edge of the wall she's on the edge of the city wall and that was a token now she experienced that so God's prophet can come preach the token to you that that scarlet thread you don't we don't paint over our houses red we don't leave we don't leave red ropes out of our windows but we are to apply the token on our homes in our lives because that was a type and you're the anti-type ruth coming back in harvest time mama that's me that's me right there let's go to 2nd Kings 8th I'll show you a picture so if Satan ever comes against you wants to see a picture don't believe that you're in God's album you can show them the second Kings 8 then spake and I want you to catch as we read I wanted you I want you to catch keywords here because every word every jot every tittle on the word is for a reason then speculation to the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go through a nine household in sojourn thou Kent wheresoever that can sojourn for the Lord had called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land for seven years for seven years there's not going to be any food in seven years and seven church ages is not gonna be quite the spiritual food in the due season and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourn in the land of the Philistines seven years now listen to these words and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the King for her house and for her land and the king talked with Gaza and the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha had done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold a woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the King for her house for her land that was her inheritance that she came to the king for and Gaza said my lord o king this is the woman this is her son whom Elisha restored to life and when the King asked the woman she told them so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now now is that your picture did God did you did a bride as a hold leave the land of the father's to sojourn and at the end of them seven years God appointed a certain officer called William Branham to restore all that the woman lost and bring us right back to the place right back to Pentecost right back not to Isuzu story Pentecost back to the land of the fathers Pentecost mama that's me that's me that's my picture she might have struggled up in that land she might have struggled in the land of the Philistines she might have struggled in I have food to eat but now you're reaping the spiritual benefit because you're the anti-type of her hardship you are the anti-type of her type in the bible the king appointed his prophet and he ordered him to restore everything back to the church all the power she lost all the false you remember that because remember whenever they came out in the Reformation they were still baptizing in titles they were still baptizing and Father Son and Holy Ghost so everything wasn't quite restored but God was in that process of a restoration but here we are full circle back to a full restoration that is why you had the hope of a translation that is why you have the hope of a rapture that is why we have the hope of the Resurrection to happen now let's go to another picture in God's album God's album is beautiful in there let's go to Joshua 18 beautiful album it's wonderful seeing your picture in the album ain't it it makes you feel good not emotionally it just anchors something in your soul it enters something in your soul because you know you're able to take the things that the Prophet said right back to the Bible and see yourself and you're able all it does is prove the message it's all it does when people don't bring their understanding of the message back to the Bible they end up in some crazy doctor nonsense when people don't take don't all they want is the Bible they don't care about the prophets message they end up and all kinds of crazy nonsense you bring the two together and your eyes are right your vision is right that's when you that's catching the vision that's kitchen the vision okay in Joshua 18 verse 1 let's and the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them and there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance and Joshua said it to the children of Israel how long were you slack to go to possess the land which the Lord God of your father's have given you give out from among you three men for each tribe and I will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to me and they shall divide it into seven parts anything sounded familiar yet Judah shall abide and their coasts on the south and the house of Joseph shall abide and their coasts on the north and they shall therefore describe the land into seven parts was not this book sealed with seven seals described seven parts but the Levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance and GAD and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them and the men arose and went away and Joshua charged them and that went to describe the land saying go walk through the land and describe it and come again to me that I may hear cast lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh and the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities into seven parts in a book and came again - Joshua - the hostess Shiloh and Joshua cast lots for them and Shiloh before the Lord and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions mama that's me that's me and they you read that chapter further on and you see that Joshua actually sat in the door the door is Christ and he gave out the inheritance because that land was yet to be taken mama that's me now when you look at the history of Israel we understand that Israel types the church is that right you look at the history of Israel and you're able to see the spiritual application that we're now living in and we understand that when Israel was carried off into bacteria into captivity they were into captivity for 70 years and this is very vital to understand because it types the seven Church ages so whenever you're reading the word and you see that Israel was in captivity for seven decades that is a type of the seven church ages then after that God sends Ezra and Nehemiah to rebuild a city and to set things in order and that's what God has done in this day now I want to read a quote that brother Branham read or said in the message of desperations and he's reading at a jeremiah the 29th chapter in the 10th verse and he says and we're now going to read from jeremiah the 29th chapter in the 10th verse for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform a good word unto you towards you in causing you to turn to this place do you notice that all three examples that we reading is all about restoration is all about coming back is all about getting your inheritance for I know the thoughts that I think of you isn't that sweet brother Ram says saith the Lord though thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an accepted end then shall you call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from nations and from all the places where I have drove you saith the Lord and will bring you again unto the place that I caused you to be carried away captive brother em says back to Pentecost he clarifies and he says I put that in myself it doesn't say that that's what I was meaning to the church because see Saints the the Bible is a love letter it's a love letter and here you have brother Branham teaching us how to read God's love letter brother Branham what was in desperations and he said see he means back to Pentecost it's a restoration back that's why this this message is not you know I don't know why I keep feeling pressed to say this but this message is not just another move of God it's just another move of God and after a certain amount of time another move of God is gonna come and we're gonna walk in that this is it this is harvest this is the seed after this is to the father it's to the garner it's harvest time remember though that remember the bundling is bundling time and we see the church's bundling themselves for the World Council of Churches so Ezra and Nehemiah are also all about restoration now I want to reach you Scofield's notes here because I remember I believe it was when brother team was here for the Labor Day meetings he made the point that when people left in the first exit is only a small percentage left many of them stayed that is a biblical principle that's a biblical principle listen to what Scofield says he says he's talking about the restoration he said but the mass of the nation and most of the princes remained by preference in Babylon and Babylonia and Assyria where they were prospering the post captivity books deal with the feeble remnant which alone had a heart for God the bride is just a remnant most people are happy in the world they're happy they're in their denominations they were happy to stay behind whenever they work there were that successful things going on whenever this prophet came from the desert and with a long beard and an awfully cracked skin and says that we're supposed to go in the desert I'm doing great right here I've never been so prosperous why should I follow a crazy prophet who who whose claims he met a pillar of fire he claims he met an angel and I'm supposed to follow him I'm doing so good right here now remember not only did a small percentage actually leave Egypt but the book of Acts tells us that in their hearts they already turned back they wanted to go back they were on their journey but they wanted to go back so if this if that was the anti tight why are we so surprised when people leave the message why are we so surprised when people turn their backs on the message when they've already been foreshadowed doing that you can see that you can see their picture too but it's not the same like yours it's not in the family album it's not in that section so listen to this in Ezra chapter 2 verse 61 they're coming back and when they're coming back they've got they've been in Babylon for 70 years and they've got to look up genealogies they've got to get things figured out who belongs to who and the children of the priests the children of Hawaii the children of cause the children of Mazzarelli which took a wife of the daughters of bazarov the giddy eight and was called after their name these sought their register among those that were reckoned by gian ology but were not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood they took on the wives name what do people do today join a church I'm Pentecostal I'm Methodist I'm Baptist they take home blasphemous names and if they don't come out they're gonna find themselves with the mark of the beast and which means they can't find their genealogy in here because they took her name instead of his name we take his name everything we do word or deed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we baptized in his name we bury in his name we're healed in his name were saved in his name we live in his name you sisters raise your children in his name you brothers work out there among the world in his name you stand as a lighthouse a city set on a hill which cannot be hid you got to be married and sold out to this word and absolutely nothing else no matter what it costs cousin Nehemiah says in those days also I saw Jews which had married the wives of a shot of Ammon and of Moab and their children spake half in the speech of a shot and could not speak in the Jews language but according to the language of each people so they the way they talked was not the Jewish language which means they were raised by serpents II nations we there's only one language the bride has and that's this right here that's the only language we know we don't know about joining churches we don't know about the denominator we don't speak their language we don't speak let's all get together in the way that they do because you remember they take jesus's prayer that they that with that they may all be one and they try and put that in an ecumenical slant we don't speak the language of let's all go join with wrong let's all go join with another Church we don't speak that language because we know how to talk we know God's language we know what what what thus saith the Lord is we know we know how to say the right thing to die the church world does not know how to say the right thing to God the church world don't know nothing about it and it's just God's grace to us it's God it's God's grace to us that when you get on your knees and you pray that you don't end it in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost that is God's grace to you it is God's grace to you that you're even here it is God's grace to you that you even have an inclination to the word it's God's grace to you that you even have a desire to be here and we should never take honor this is said all the time of these brothers but these services we should never take a single service for granted because any service can be the last for us as an individual or for us as a body of believers and the rapture can come I'm sorry I don't believe in sprinkling I'm sorry all right thank you so all three examples was like a vision all three examples is about restoration now the Word of God thank you brother Matthew I know it the Word of God is like a vision and before a vision can take place everything has got to be put in order remember brother I'm describing a vision the hats got to be here the old lady's got to be there that's how the Word of God is someone said to me not long ago said brother Branham I would give anything if I could see a vision I put my arm around on a real brother I said my beloved brother every time you open the Bible you see a vision every time because let me bring something to your attention do you realize that every vision every dream and every revelation has got to come back to this every bit people in the denominational world have gifts and they'll have all kinds of you remember other than talk on tape about some man had a crazy dream about how he left his wife to go marry this one and he just thought that scar but it didn't line up with this you bring everything back to this you bring your life you bring your vision you bring any dream you bring any idea something pops in your head is that the Lord speaking to me well let me see you open God's vision and you see you see am I supposed to marry this person open or to see open the word and see and if the word tells you not to do it don't do it don't do it God's not gonna override your free moral agency but don't do it then you'll pay for it so everything must be in place God is a God of order he's got the Abraham class in this order it's got lot in his order sodomites are there in their order and we can't be changed until the resurrection see God has an order we see the resurrected ones first and then we're changed now I want to switch gears here just a little bit I'll put this up here I'll switch gears here a little bit and I want to go through some very familiar stories but that brother Ram tells and that's another thing just like parables in the word whether Josh it's for a reason God doesn't just put stories in here every story that brother entails on tape is almost like a prophecy or almost like a type remember about that really really poor woman who couldn't even afford nothing and and the government came to try and help her out and her son was somewhere in India and and they asked her they're trying to kind of figure out exactly how much help she needed and things and and he's just telling the story and and he talks about how well you know I don't have any money but my son you know I don't want to bother him for money but he sends me some of the most beautiful pictures and and they said well can we see him where are they and she said oh they're in my Bible they're in my Bible she was rich and didn't even know it she was rich and didn't even know it so I want to speak a minute or read a minute about the woman in Memphis because there's power with associating yourself and stepping into the scripture because the Scriptures not do's and don't it's a blueprint if you do what they did in the same faith you're going to get the same result so we're all familiar with the story brother Branham was going through and his plane got got grounded thing and he's going along humming a song and he sees a black lady there with that shirt tied around her head and he's walking by and she said good morning parson I said how'd he do Annie it caught me parson I looked around said do you know me she said yes sir I said do you know my name she said no sir I said how did you know I was a parson she said parson did you ever hear about the Shunammite woman now you see how she's identifying herself with the Shunammite woman so she's identifying herself with a Shunammite woman thus unite woman had an elisha well she's like the Shunammite woman and she needs an elisha see she's stepping into the scripture with such faith that God is now about to give her the desire of her heart she said parson did you ever hear about the shemite woman that had a baby the Lord promised her the baby and the baby died and I said yes she said I was a woman that way see how she's sympathizing she's getting to the scripture she's getting into that Channel and I promised the Lord that I raise my baby for him and she said the Lord give a husband and I a lovely boy so he went off and we know the story there and he said and I got down on my knees and I sit and I and said I prayed and said I prayed Oh loud set eyes a woman like the shunammite where is your Elijah and just begin to pray and said I prayed and prayed and said this morning just before daylight said the Lord said stand at this gate now parents God has given children our blessing from the Lord so God has given you children so it doesn't matter where sin has taken them it doesn't matter where they are in life God gave them to you you're like the shin oh my and they may be dying in sin apparently they may be going through something but you do like do like her says eyes like that shunammite woman I was like that shooting my woman God you gave me that child and I'm not gonna lose it I'm not gonna let Satan kill it I'm not gonna let say and take it to an early grave I'm not gonna let and take it to hell because she because God gave her that boy God gave you your child and he could have given you anyone else but he gave you someone specific and you keep holding that token and he stepped it to the scripture and you stand between in that bridge you stand into that place for your loved one and what was the testimony of the boy mama is getting light mama it's getting light in here so the secret of getting in the scripture is getting the mind of Christ that's the secret you get into the mind of Christ because the mind of Christ don't come here that this is where this is the greatest battle ever fought is right here the mind of Christ comes right from the heart so that is why you hear you hear these brothers make statements you know you you hear but all it takes is that once you hear the voice behind the voice well why is it that sometimes ministers will quote the same thing over no yeah I've heard that the Satan will tell you oh I've heard that scripture for I can say it I know it yep yep I said it yeah yeah we've heard it so many times but if we ever let it drop from here to here in the heart that's where faith goes into action here's mental faith but we need real godly Bible faith you know that's how sister had it right got what she wanted it wasn't with her own mind brother I'm sitting there building the church she pledged $50 or so and brother never would only take 20 brother and said he had $20 in his pocket to go give back to her and he said something said to him that Jesus seen that Widow casting two mites and two pennies in the Treasury and he didn't stop her so what do you do you have sister Hattie right being right in the middle of Scripture and not even realizing it she's in the inspiration of the word a widowed woman with nothing as poor as dirt but God let just like he let that with a woman cast all her living right into the Treasury the same thing for sister Haley right God allowed her to give that $20 and look what she's looking look at the investment you talk about an investment and fasting in the kingdom of God you we were to give everything we've got to this word we're to give everything we have you know when a woman one day came and anointed Jesus he anointed his feet and the disciples began to murmur and things and Jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever you may do to them good but she had not but me not have always she had done what she could she has come aforehand to anoint my body to the bearing verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she had done shall be spoken for a memorial of her the same can be said about sister Hattie right how many pulpits is she mentioned in every single service around the world what she did as inspiration is now preached as a memorial to her because she stepped into the scripture do you know that Adam was a God of the earth an amatuer God brother Branham teaches us and God gave him because he had the mind of Christ God gave him the authority to name the animals it gave him the authority to tell this mountain to be moved that he gave him the authority till this tree and the wind to stop and things like that and then God said amen to it God said amen whenever Adam said this is a lion Gus said amen when he said feed her with a beak you're an eagle God said amen God said amen to what Adam said when Joshua got in that same channel he said son stand still moon you stand here God said Amen I say you say how do I know God said Amen because it comes to pass and God is honor to bring your word to pass when you get into that channel not your own carnal thinking and we all have our own carnal thinking but it takes to get into that channel in the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and be able to have your version of that ain't nothing but the truth and receive what you need but it takes the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to do so not your own idea so you have Jesus the second Adam he comes and he says comes up to a fig tree and says no man eat of you and God said amen Jesus stood on the Braille of a boat and he said peace be still God said amen jesus said thy sins be forgiven thee and God said amen jesus said it is finished and God said amen brother branham one day was walking across a field and he was confronted by that bull and he said you go that divine love it wasn't him he was looking for his gun remember his carnal mind was looking for his gun like ours wood or a tree or something but all of a sudden something came and took over and he said bull I'm sorry to serve you you go and lay down and what did God say Amen God said Amen when then wasps came to attack him and he that same divine love now why did God allow these examples to be done to the Prophet to show that you can walk in the same channel it wasn't just for brother Branham it wasn't just for Jesus the works that I do shall you do also we're thrilled to read these stories we're thrilled we believe them with all of our hearts but it's for you it's for you it's for you it's for me to walk in this channel now don't in your own carnal mind go and slap a wasp nest because you're gonna that's not gonna work you wait you're the wrong channel that's right you wait until God puts you in that channel when brother Branham was in the mountains of Colorado and he told the storm to go back God said amen whenever his sister Mita had that tumor and he by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost because remember he was praying he was getting with the doctors and what should we do can we put it off we really trust in Lord for her healing and Lord will be not have enough faith he was a human and he had struggled Lord of all the miracles he's seen of all the prayer lines he still said Lord do we just not have enough faith well why is this tumor not leaving and one day the inspiration of the Holy Ghost came and said before the doctors hand touches her side it's going to be gone and God said man God said Amen now this is I'm about to read something then things that you hear all the time but let it strike verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven are in all things he later says whatsoever you ask in prayer believing ye shall receive now I want to ask y'all an honest question and please don't raise your hand unless you mean it you take whatever desire that you have on your heart and put on your right now whether it's healing salvation the Holy Ghost a loved one okay now that's y'all's question if brother Branham was here and he he was getting ready after this service to have a prayer line how many would have complete confidence that when you go through that prophets prayer line that you get the desires of your heart okay amen yes we believe it because we believe him and we believe his ministry now I want to take that another knotch if Jesus Christ himself was here in his earthly ministry and we were in Palestine and we were you know we were in synagogue and we were telling you and say he was off somewhere and we were gonna tell him we were believers and because we would be and we were - and Weavin and I told you he's gonna be coming back here in a few weeks and we're again we're gonna ask him to come and he's gonna pray for all of you how many of you would have enough faith to believe that when Jesus laid his hands on you and prayed for you you to get what you wanted okay now hold it right there because I've set you up for this quote because if you can if we can get ahold of this quote that I'm about to read to you I promise you there won't a sick person leave that building they won't a single lost person leave that building there won't a single person without only ghost leave that building this building I mean if we can just get a hold of this quote I'm about to read to you brother branham said then if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then you have God the word in you and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God and it's inseparable then if you have God's Word in you you have God's life in you now I'm gonna go slow and kind of emphasize I want us to get this if you have the Holy Ghost you have everything if you have the Holy Ghost there's no there's no stopping you have to constantly grow but if you have the Holy Ghost you've got him you've got the word you've got the very life of Jesus Christ and he promised that if that spirit that raised Christ Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken your mortal body whether it be in the ground or walk around the earth it will quicken you so if you've got the word in you you've got God's life in you and he says you have God in you and whatever God's Word speaks forth out of you it'll have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God Jesus said whatsoever you ask the Father in my name that will I do program ask the question do you ever realize what that means do you realize if we go before God in the name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself praying now we are second ago most of us raised our hands when we talked when we asked about brother Branham when we asked about Jesus now what about you but it's got to sink from here to here it's got to sink from here to here for me it's got to think from here to here to you before it can change our lives but if it does it will change you forever it will change your circumstance forever it will change the circumstance of your family forever you'll never be the same because when you pray with the Holy Ghost it's not you praying anymore it's him praying out of you that is powerful he says it isn't me praying anymore if I come in his name and he recognizes his name and Jesus said whatever you ask the Father in my name that I do and then I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his spirit praying through me and people can't understand how whenever you try to explain to him about the Godhead how Jesus could pray to himself well how does the Holy Ghost filled believer pray to God when he's got God on the inside the Holy Ghost in you is God himself and that's the part see Satan can get in your flesh Satan can get in your spirit and make you Moody and make you just not so pleasant to be around but Satan can't touch your soul and that makes him so mad and that makes me so glad because remember let me just say this remember the first pull when brother branham's ministry he contacted the flesh he took the hand of the people and then bombs would appear in his hand and was able to discern the second poll contacted people's spirit like the woman at the well he said if I can only catch your spirit he talked to people but do you know that people were to get healed by that sign of the hand and he did get healed by people by him discerning but the third pull is only for the soul and Satan can't touch that he can't touch that once once that third pull catches the fish because remember the fishing and the little fish go away but once you get hooked and you've got that word living in you Satan can't touch your soul the third pole is only for the bride the first and second Pole is just to bring healing to catch the bride's attention was to catch the fish's attention that's the difference he said now if he we as Christians we become too clogged up we just can't understand well we think the doctor said I can't get well as long as you think that then you're not thinking God's thoughts you can't do it if you say well I'm going to die the doctor said I was going to die all regards to the doctor that's the best of his knowledge and he said and if he said you're gonna die humanly speaking I believe the same thing but by the word I can't believe it so where's your vision that's right because he promised me that whatever I asked the Father in his name would be granted now if God could just clear that little channel out and run that energy out to that place then something is going to happen we need real faith we need God's faith and we need it as brother Tim was mentioning last Sunday about atmosphere have such an atmosphere that anything could happen do you know that's something I remember when we first came and visited sister Gabriella and I back in 2017 we came and visited there was such an atmosphere that literally anything could happen that's the way we have to believe God for every service that it's not as this often said that it's not just another service literally anything can happen in any service even right now that quote that I read to you can become real to you and you pray and you say God I want this that or the other and it be from your heart and you walk out a different person you walk out completely healed because it's not you it's your faith in the heart from the heart but it's not a head faith that's what's giving us a lot of problems as people get intellectual conceptions of this message and they don't meet him they don't meet the author they don't meet the father of this album they don't see it it's not learning upon learning all right oh forget everything he knew to learn Christ romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him went my favorite verses that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you mama that's me that's your there's so many pictures time we'll just not this could this you could go after example after example and every single service these brothers show you your picture but do you recognize it do you know a lot of times it's hard for a person to human element to discern God from man it's always been that way that is the problem with humanity that is why they wouldn't believe the prophets that's why they didn't wouldn't believe Jesus because they can't discern the man from God and it's important we as believers do that with one another that you can discern when God is speaking because that's why people can't receive something and you have that especially among among churches where there's a lot of a lot of family and things and and maybe they may come against the pastor and I don't know I have no idea why I'm even here is but I'm just saying it because they cannot discern that that's not this brother I might had coffee with him an hour ago and we had some good laughs and we talked about natural things but now it's God speaking to me so receive it because if you still see these brothers here for who they are on the natural you're not going to get nothing from God because that's just brother Matthew preaching again that's just brother Andrew brother on but when you realize that it's God speaking directly to you and they have no idea why they're saying it what they're saying you grab it because that's God that's God and you grabbing it and that's God in them speaking it and what what did brother RAM say that went to with to omnipotence meet the miraculous takes place so the omnipotent in you is supposed to discern the omnipotence of the word coming forth and together the miraculous happens that's how it works it's not a flesh and blood affair glory to God is not a flesh and blood affair it's God in you the hope of glory going from glory to glory you see you realize that you're not the son or daughter of your pair it's God allowed you to be expressed in this earth by your natural parents for different reasons and there's things you can't explain about your life and and maybe you wish things were different and all this and that but you know this this is your father he is your father when Paul said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep we shall be changed you read that you say mama that's me you see her so that that's my picture I'm gonna be changed I'm gonna be changed I don't know about the fellow next to me I don't know about the gal next to me but I'm gonna be changed because I see my picture in here you know when John seen his name when John seen John the Revelator seen his name he got so excited all of heaven and earth and everything under it and over it and every which way heard him saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever john seen his name of the book and he realized he was and i'm closing and he realized that he was in God's plan of redemption when you find your place in the book just as Jesus did Jesus came he was born of a virgin and he was God from his first breath to his last he was God but do you know brother branham said as I read to you the quote that as a man he's still needed the word quicken to him not by another man but by God if you got something out of this service it's not because of me is because of him if you get anything out of these brothers preaching it's not because of them it's because of him you see the different separate the natural we're not we're not this isn't a natural gathering this isn't this isn't this is between life and death this is eternal life we're doing business with God that's that's why we've gathered here so whenever you see your picture in the book then you know you're in God's plan of redemption you know that God placed your picture in this word before the foundation of the world you say it wasn't written yet it was already finished in the mount of Jesus was slain was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he was he was our it was already finished so far there's no greater there's no greater joy there's no greater privilege than no one that you are God's child there's no greater privilege they're being able to look into the Bible and find in your picture think about this it's your picture it's some of them are group pictures and you can find yourself in that group picture I'm not gonna know the bride and the spirit said come you find yourself it's sent to our feet you find yourself in God's Word in revelations 10 and 11 and he said unto me after eating the book thou must prophesy again before many people before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings mama that's me you say how do i how do i prophesy speak the word speak the word and your prophesy that's God's word one last quote in brother Hammond walk cross speak he said oh how this Tabernacle this morning how we people of this our brother Nevel as we see the gray hair striking the great striking are here in our shoulders stooping when we see the world weaving and rocking as it is and how we can look around and see the promise is drawing nigh I think many times if someone could just bounce into it all at once would understand it rather and come into it at once it almost sends you into eternity it's such a rapturing thing and never note it and just Oh break through the things that we have seen and know and understand and all bounce up all bounce in at one time the man or the woman the boy the girl would probably just lift up their hands and say let's go Lord Jesus you see oh how the hour is so close and I wonder I want to even admonish young middle aged you know you're never too young young people for revelation you're never too young for God to deal with you you never get too old for God to deal with you and give you revelation and show you pictures we're always seeing when every time you read the word like brother I'm said it's a vision and we open up this word and we say mama that's me and as I said Jesus was able to just off a prophet off a story of Jonah was able to stake his entire will be able to stand up and make a statement like that that you destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up and as I said if you can't find your place if you can't find your picture in this word ask God to deliver you from spiritual amnesia because if you're a predestinated child of God you're in there if you're a predestinate child of God you are in there but you've just forgotten you can't see it because Satan has blinded your eyes let's bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father how we thank you Lord Jesus for this opportunity Lord and these moments we have in your presence father and to realize father that Lord your word is not just the words of a man but more we can hang our soul upon every word father the Lord how thankful we are to you Lord that we can look and look at there's so many examples that you've given us that those that have gone on before that had testimonies that they please you we look at Enoch and how he just went for a stroll one day it was just another walk it was just it just seemed like another day but Lord that day was so special that she translated him you took them and father we we have our daily routines we have our natural tendencies we have our natural ways the father one of these mornings father we're gonna wake up and have our devotions just like any other morning we're gonna get up maybe eat breakfast like any other morning but Lord one of these days you're gonna take this one of these days we're gonna hear knocks on the door we're gonna open and they're gonna be the resurrected Saints father Lord mama or daddy that's us we believe your word father and we just pray O God that made may that quote follow the Lord that it's not just a quote of a man it was the words of a vindicated prophet to understand it to realize that when we pray under the anointing and under in the channel of the Holy Ghost you literally say Amen to our prayer help us Lord to get to just put aside carnality help us Lord to just be in such a channel of the spirit father help us nor this world draws our attention there's so many voices that are Poland there's so many things that are vying for our attention but father may we give you our undivided attention we're living in such a late hour Lord we're living in such a late hour when the rapture can come at any time and your word said he that filthy will be filthy still and he that's holy will be holy still and Lord in a service like this someone that's filthy can become holy someone that's unclean like a leper can cry unclean unclean and as same Lord Jesus is here tonight to cleanse of leprosy to cleanse of sin to refill of the Spirit to give more revelation and understanding father that's why you gave this word I pray O God that you deal with our hearts help us lay aside selfishness help us to lay aside the things of the world help us O God to lay aside carnality help us to lay aside self and Lord Jesus may you have the preeminence within us may you have the preeminence in our lives may you have the preeminence in our families may you have the preeminence in our decisions we're faced with so many decisions every day but have we consulted Josh have we asked you what should we do with this Knorr your ear is always open to us you're like such a loving father who gathers his family in the house like you did Adam and Eve in the garden before the fall in who asked how was your day children is there anything you like different would you like the wind to blow a certain way are you comfortable here in this Eden I made for you or do you provided this word in Lourdes the only comfort we have fun I pray may we give it the preeminence that it deserves your prophet asks in the church age book he said I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst use you give us so many gifts he performed so many signs and wonders you've indicated your word constantly over and over and over again yet this generation of Lord is so numb to your word your this generation is so known to the vindication of your word but father we love it and that is why we're here we're here father so that we can draw closer to you Lord for we want to make a rapture Lord made no one in this building under the sound of my voice are on the internet ways father may they not be in the tribulation period father may they wake up before it's too late we love you Lord we thank you for your word we commit this attentive audience father thank you Lord that they were so attentive to the word I pray that you bless the Lord for their attention a long-drawn-out service but lord I pray that you bless them for their ever blessing Jesus it will
