[50:22] and verse 97 tonight I'd like to speak
[50:25] to you a thought um it's been on my
[50:27] heart actually dropped in my heart while
[50:28] I was there at brother Donnie's while I
[50:30] was preaching I would like to take a
[50:32] thought here this evening on on the
[50:35] understanding of sons the understanding
[50:37] of sons and the Bible says here oh how I
[50:41] love thy law it is my meditation all the
[50:46] day though through thy
[50:50] Commandments through thy Commandments
[50:52] has made me wiser than my enemies
[50:55] forever for they are ever with me I have
[50:59] more understanding than all my teachers
[51:02] for thy testimonies are my
[51:04] meditation I understand more than the
[51:07] Ancients because I keep thy precepts I
[51:10] have refrained my feet from every evil
[51:13] way that I might keep thy word I have
[51:16] not departed from thy judgments for thou
[51:18] Hast taught
[51:20] me how sweet are thy words unto my taste
[51:24] yay sweeter than honey to my
[51:28] mouth a that powerful to recognize all
[51:31] the way in Revelations chapter 10 it's
[51:33] sitting right here in front of us that
[51:35] through thy precepts I get understanding
[51:39] therefore I hate every false way also
[51:42] John chapter 5 verse 24 and then we'll
[51:45] let you have your seats this
[51:47] evening Jesus says here verely
[51:51] verily which means absolutely absolutely
[51:55] I say unto you
[51:58] he that heareth my
[51:59] word and believeth on him that sent
[52:02] me hath everlasting life and shall not
[52:06] come into condemnation but is passed
[52:09] from Death unto life may God bless the
[52:12] reading of the word you may be seated in
[52:14] the presence of the Lord and we just
[52:16] want to take just a little bit of time
[52:18] here this afternoon and begin to take a
[52:21] little thought on
[52:23] that understanding of sons and Jesus
[52:27] said that he that heareth my word and if
[52:29] you're familiar with the message brother
[52:31] brandham told us he said now he said
[52:33] that word heareth he said it means
[52:35] understand he said it means understand
[52:37] he said that he that understandeth he
[52:40] that understandeth my word and believeth
[52:43] on him that sent me hath everlasting
[52:46] life and brother Ron picks that up in
[52:47] the Easter seal and he said but he that
[52:50] understandeth he said he that knoweth
[52:52] his place in this hour it's he that
[52:55] knoweth his place
[52:57] in this hour and I think it's wonderful
[52:59] to be able to recognize the hour that
[53:01] we're living in we don't want to just
[53:03] simply look back into the scriptures of
[53:05] old and see Abraham's time and Noah's
[53:08] time and and Moses's time but we want to
[53:11] recognize the hour that we are living in
[53:14] because if we don't recognize the hour
[53:15] that we are living in we won't recognize
[53:17] the message of the hour it's just like
[53:20] when Abraham was sitting at the tent
[53:22] door when MDC showed up at the tent door
[53:25] it was a signal unto Abraham that the
[53:28] time of his change was drawing nigh and
[53:31] every time that you begin to see in the
[53:33] message you you begin to see the angel
[53:35] of the Lord show up it was a sign of a
[53:38] junction and when Abraham recognized
[53:40] that it was the same voice that had
[53:43] spoke to him all the days of his life it
[53:45] was a signal unto him that he would
[53:47] recognize that that the time of the
[53:50] prophecy was drawing nigh and brother
[53:53] Matthew had referred and I'm not going
[53:55] to repr preach a sermon but but he
[53:56] referred to Daniel chapter 9 and I was
[53:59] just drawing a little inspiration from
[54:01] his message upon that there in Daniel 9
[54:04] that we we recognize that Daniel the
[54:06] Bible said that Daniel understood by the
[54:09] books of Jeremiah that the 70 years were
[54:12] almost accomplished it was a sign or a
[54:15] signal unto Daniel because he was able
[54:17] to understand the time that he was
[54:19] living in in that time of Prophecy that
[54:22] that there which Jeremiah had spoke
[54:25] about was getting ready to be fulfilled
[54:27] that those times were were coming to an
[54:29] end that's what he said in Jeremiah 29
[54:32] that that in verse 10 that after 70
[54:34] years be accomplished at Babylon I'll
[54:36] visit you notice it's a very powerful
[54:39] and well-known scripture in verse 11
[54:41] says I know the thoughts that I think
[54:43] toward you sayi the Lord thoughts of
[54:45] peace and not of evil to give you an
[54:49] expected end and Daniel was able to look
[54:51] back into the scriptures and look back
[54:53] there and understand the time that he
[54:56] was living in and that the time that he
[54:58] was at was a time that was coming to and
[55:01] expected there that God was giving them
[55:03] and expected in and you begin to study
[55:05] out Daniel's life you beg begin to find
[55:08] out that the Bible said about Daniel is
[55:10] that Daniel was of an excellent spirit
[55:13] that Daniel be to he began when he came
[55:15] into the king that he came in there that
[55:18] he purposed within himself that he was
[55:20] not going to defile himself with the
[55:22] king's meat and the King's drink because
[55:24] Daniel had an understanding that his
[55:26] life was different from any of the other
[55:28] Magi that were down there in that land
[55:31] but Daniel had a purpose that was upon
[55:33] his life and if you study out Daniel's
[55:35] life you'll find that Daniel was 68
[55:38] years old when he comes to this position
[55:40] when he begins to recognize that he's
[55:42] coming to the Fulfillment of the time of
[55:44] Prophecy that Daniel was sending there
[55:47] and he'd been all the way there since he
[55:49] was a little bitty old boy that you'll
[55:51] study that he'd been back down there in
[55:53] Babylon ever since he was 12 to 14 years
[55:55] old he been down there living in the
[55:57] time of Babylon and brother random said
[56:00] that he had been down there all that
[56:01] time he hadn't had anybody else to
[56:03] worship with him except the three h boys
[56:06] he said he didn't have any hym books he
[56:07] he was cast out of his church he was an
[56:09] alien outside outside of his church he
[56:12] said he didn't have no church to go to
[56:14] he didn't have no himno to ring except
[56:16] for the to read or sing except for what
[56:18] he sang he didn't have anybody else to
[56:21] sacrifice with because he was living in
[56:23] a Babylonian tradition time and he was
[56:25] setting the there and he had to do all
[56:27] of those things in secret but all of
[56:30] that time for 68 years Daniel held the
[56:33] victory all that time because he knew
[56:36] that there was coming a time that
[56:37] captivity was going to be
[56:39] broken and to think that he was living
[56:42] right down there in the midst of all
[56:44] those heathens and he still had the
[56:46] Victory and brother random said he said
[56:48] he stood down there 68 years he said but
[56:50] some of us can't stay here an hour Oh my
[56:54] he said but Daniel was standing alone
[56:55] with God and he held the victory right
[56:58] there I think it's powerful when you
[57:00] begin to study out Daniel's life that
[57:02] Daniel said he begin to understand by
[57:05] the reading of the books that the time
[57:08] of the hour was getting ready to be
[57:10] accomplished he looked at the scripture
[57:13] and he looked at the time piece and he
[57:15] recognized that victory was at hand and
[57:18] if I would be able to point you to
[57:20] anything I would want to point you to
[57:22] this that the time of the amorites that
[57:24] the cup of the amorites is full and we
[57:27] recognize that by the UN that by the
[57:29] preaching of the word that we can say
[57:32] like Daniel we understand by the opening
[57:35] of the word that the time is at hand
[57:38] that the lamb has come to lay a claim
[57:40] upon his possession that all the
[57:42] Mysteries that were held back from the
[57:44] Church of the Living God that there the
[57:47] lamb was waiting he was waiting for
[57:49] redemptions claims what was he he was
[57:52] waiting for this hour for this time and
[57:55] we recognize by the understanding of the
[57:57] books that we recognize that this is the
[58:00] hour when the lamb stood up in this
[58:02] generation that the lamb stood up and
[58:05] took the book and he said he said now
[58:08] look he said Satan you can't touch that
[58:09] book what was on that book we understand
[58:12] by the message it was your names that
[58:14] was upon that book so God was not going
[58:17] to allow that book to fall back into the
[58:20] dirty hands of Satan so God allowed that
[58:23] book to go back into the original hands
[58:25] of the the one that wrote your name
[58:27] before the foundation of the world and
[58:29] all throughout time your name has been
[58:32] held in a savior it's been held in the
[58:34] hands of the almighty God and we
[58:37] understand that this is the hour when
[58:39] the seals have been ripped off the back
[58:41] of the book and we understand we've been
[58:44] adopted as a son and daughter of God but
[58:46] our full adoption which is our body
[58:48] change is literally right here upon us
[58:53] to think about it tonight that the
[58:54] Rapture is at
[58:56] to think that your body change is at
[58:58] hand I believe that if anybody can say
[59:01] that they understand that the Rapture is
[59:03] nigh unto them it ought to be the Church
[59:06] of the Living God to be able to say I've
[59:08] Not Just heard a word but I've
[59:10] understood a word because if you just
[59:12] hear something it doesn't mean that you
[59:14] understand something a prostitute can
[59:16] hear the preaching of the word but they
[59:18] don't change a drunkard can hear the
[59:20] word but they don't change but where the
[59:22] power is it's when you understand by the
[59:26] preaching of the word you see it's he
[59:28] that understandeth and when you
[59:30] understand it shows that you are an
[59:32] eagle it shows that you had something on
[59:35] the inside of you that would cause you
[59:38] to understand who you are as an
[59:40] identified son and daughter of God that
[59:43] you have the authority by the message of
[59:45] the hour to cast down every demon cast
[59:48] down every Power cast down every
[59:50] influence of Hell by the understanding
[59:52] of the books we recognize it
[59:57] Hallelujah now when Jesus rolls when
[1:00:00] Jesus is rolling through his ministry
[1:00:02] and he goes into Matthew chapter 16 and
[1:00:05] there when you begin to study out
[1:00:07] Matthew 16 you'll find that the
[1:00:09] Pharisees came to him and they were
[1:00:11] asking of him a sign and Jesus turned he
[1:00:15] turned to them and he rebuked them but
[1:00:17] he turned to his disciples and he told
[1:00:19] them now you be Beware of the leaven of
[1:00:22] the Pharisees you see and his disciples
[1:00:25] were in a carnal realm in that moment
[1:00:27] and they said well it's just he's saying
[1:00:29] this because we didn't bring any bread
[1:00:31] with us he said no he said I'm not
[1:00:33] talking to you about that what did he do
[1:00:35] he begin to open up the scriptures and
[1:00:37] he begin to speak to them he said I'm
[1:00:39] not talking to you about natural bread
[1:00:42] what did he do he opened the scriptures
[1:00:44] and their eyes were open to the fact
[1:00:46] that he's not talking about natural
[1:00:48] bread he's talking about the doctrine of
[1:00:51] the Pharisees he said Beware of those
[1:00:53] things and Jesus rose right over and he
[1:00:56] takes him over to ciser Philippi and he
[1:00:59] asks him this question whom do men say
[1:01:01] that I the son of man am and they said
[1:01:03] some say that thou art John the Baptist
[1:01:05] some say thou art Elias but he turned to
[1:01:08] Peter and said but who do you say that I
[1:01:11] am he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:01:14] of the Living God and to think about
[1:01:16] this to put it into perspective here
[1:01:19] Peter is standing upon the Earth but he
[1:01:22] was grabbing a hold of a revelation that
[1:01:24] came from Heaven he was standing on
[1:01:26] Earth but there was an understanding
[1:01:29] that came from Heaven he said he said
[1:01:31] Peter he said your father didn't give
[1:01:33] you this understanding your mother
[1:01:35] didn't give you this understanding but
[1:01:37] my Father which is in heaven hath
[1:01:40] revealed this unto you notice what he
[1:01:42] did he said now I give unto you the Keys
[1:01:45] of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever
[1:01:48] you bind on Earth shall be bound in
[1:01:50] heaven and whatsoever thou loose on
[1:01:52] Earth shall be loosed in heaven what was
[1:01:55] Jesus doing he was putting the believer
[1:01:58] in his position and he was bringing
[1:02:00] forth the revelation of the church in
[1:02:02] its power that by the power of
[1:02:05] Revelation you have the power to bind
[1:02:08] and you have the power to loose it's not
[1:02:10] by understanding of your mind but it's
[1:02:12] by the spiritual revelation of who Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ is that you have the power to
[1:02:18] bind
[1:02:20] Satan if it's that powerful that you can
[1:02:23] bind every spirit and any thing below
[1:02:26] him it is that powerful enough to loose
[1:02:29] all of Heaven to your situations it's
[1:02:32] not something that it's man's madeup
[1:02:34] idea but this is a revelation that came
[1:02:37] from God that you have the power to bind
[1:02:40] Satan but you have the power to loose
[1:02:43] the Holy Ghost over your situation and
[1:02:46] only Sons understand
[1:02:50] this there's been many of people that
[1:02:52] read the word read the written word but
[1:02:54] they don't have the revelation of it and
[1:02:56] what makes you a powerful group of
[1:02:58] people is not because you're a well-
[1:03:00] read group it's because of who you are
[1:03:03] it's because you recognize your position
[1:03:06] you see who you are in the scripture by
[1:03:08] a
[1:03:09] revelation what happened something rode
[1:03:12] out of an Unseen World and dropped in
[1:03:14] your heart and gave you a revelation and
[1:03:18] brother Brandon picks that up if it is
[1:03:19] the rising of the sun he said that was a
[1:03:22] divine revelation of the word made flesh
[1:03:25] he said but if it was made flesh in the
[1:03:27] day by the son he said the groom he said
[1:03:30] it's got to be fleshed today by the
[1:03:33] bride it's got to be flesh to dat by the
[1:03:36] bride that's why when brother random
[1:03:38] turned he turned to him he said that's
[1:03:40] the reason why he stood up there in
[1:03:42] Matthew chapter 28 and he told them to
[1:03:45] baptize in the name of the father Son
[1:03:47] and Holy Ghost he said because the
[1:03:49] disciples knew who he
[1:03:52] was they knew they wasn't going to
[1:03:54] baptize in titles because they knew who
[1:03:56] he was that's the reason he's given you
[1:03:59] so much power is because you recognize
[1:04:02] who he
[1:04:05] is and brother random would say it and
[1:04:07] he said now it don't take no Revelation
[1:04:09] to understand baptism he said but it
[1:04:11] does take an understanding to understand
[1:04:14] or to look and have a revelation on the
[1:04:16] godhead but John said in 1 John 5 and7
[1:04:20] that there are three that bear record in
[1:04:22] heaven the Father the spirit and the son
[1:04:24] and these three are one but there are
[1:04:26] three that bear record on Earth there is
[1:04:28] a water blood and spirit and they are
[1:04:31] not the same but they agree in one what
[1:04:33] is it it is a sign unto us that you can
[1:04:37] have the son you can't separate the son
[1:04:39] from the Holy Ghost you can't separate
[1:04:41] God from the sun he said but you can be
[1:04:44] justified without being Sanctified and
[1:04:47] you can be Sanctified without having the
[1:04:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost but glory be
[1:04:52] to God there is another church under
[1:04:55] this messenger who knows who she is will
[1:04:58] be a final Runner a final age why is it
[1:05:02] they understand their
[1:05:04] position come on somebody you're not
[1:05:06] just a Justified group under Luther
[1:05:09] you're not just a Sanctified group under
[1:05:11] Wesley but you are a fully adopted Sons
[1:05:14] and Daughters of God under Malachi 4's
[1:05:16] Ministry baptized by the
[1:05:21] message there's a lot of people that
[1:05:23] don't understand what it is
[1:05:26] but you have been baptized under Malachi
[1:05:28] 4's Ministry so it gave you an
[1:05:32] understanding I tell you like brother
[1:05:34] brandom said it he said the rest of the
[1:05:35] world they need their brains
[1:05:39] baptized you say what's wrong with you
[1:05:42] you've been brainwashed brother angrew
[1:05:44] absolutely I don't have my mind no more
[1:05:47] I've got the mind of almighty God I
[1:05:49] don't understand as a Spencer I don't
[1:05:52] understand as a grandson of hom of phas
[1:05:55] but I understand as a Son of
[1:05:59] God blessed be the name of the Lord it
[1:06:02] ain't just for William brandham it ain't
[1:06:04] just for Paul it ain't just for the
[1:06:06] church age Messengers it's for me and my
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:13] house glory be to God we've moved past
[1:06:16] the days of Luther we needed what Luther
[1:06:19] preached we needed what Wesley preached
[1:06:21] we need the restoration of the gifts but
[1:06:24] this is the hour
[1:06:26] the Bri
[1:06:30] Jer what is that brother Andrew it is
[1:06:33] the age in Le oosa that the Bride Comes
[1:06:36] to her position William brandham is not
[1:06:39] putting us outside of the Le OA Church
[1:06:43] age it's the same thing that he would
[1:06:46] say it's a golden age it's an eagle age
[1:06:48] it's a token age it's a bride age just
[1:06:51] like we could say that this is the age
[1:06:52] of television it was this age that
[1:06:55] television was released it was this age
[1:06:57] that iPhone came into existence and it
[1:07:00] is in this age that the bride
[1:07:03] understands she understands who he is
[1:07:07] and she understands who she is beside
[1:07:12] him what is it it is a divine revelation
[1:07:16] that literally unlocks the door you see
[1:07:20] what it is it's faith that unlocks the
[1:07:23] door you see what faith is Faith takes
[1:07:26] you it's like a ladder Faith takes you
[1:07:29] from hearing ground to receiving ground
[1:07:32] you can hear that you're healed on the
[1:07:35] ground here but faith will take you on
[1:07:38] the receiving ground up there and what
[1:07:41] did this message do it took you from the
[1:07:43] ground of being a child it took you from
[1:07:46] being a child and to recognizing your
[1:07:49] position as an heir and it placed you as
[1:07:52] an adult in Jesus Christ that's exactly
[1:07:56] what brother bandam said in the key to
[1:07:57] the door that the Holy Ghost is a
[1:08:00] witness of Resurrection that he's
[1:08:02] showing you that you have become an
[1:08:05] adult in Christ what are you talking
[1:08:07] about brother Andrew I'm talking about
[1:08:09] what Paul was saying to the church there
[1:08:11] in Galatians that verse chapter 4 he
[1:08:13] said I say this unto you that the heir
[1:08:16] as long as he is a child he differ
[1:08:19] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:08:22] of all so what did the message do what
[1:08:25] did the baptism of the Holy Ghost do it
[1:08:28] took you from a child but it baptized
[1:08:32] you unto an adult in Christ Jesus what
[1:08:35] is that what am I talking about I'm
[1:08:37] saying that this is a divine revelation
[1:08:40] that has been unlocked to the Church of
[1:08:42] the Living God it's just like when men
[1:08:46] when men are studying out to be a be be
[1:08:48] a musician or trying to study out to be
[1:08:50] a a technician or trying to study out to
[1:08:52] be a carpenter or something what are
[1:08:54] they doing there's trying to study
[1:08:56] they're accumulating things they're
[1:08:58] going to school they're learning these
[1:08:59] things they're picking up things here or
[1:09:01] there and it's like a child that's
[1:09:03] having trouble in school the teacher can
[1:09:05] teach them to they're blue in the face
[1:09:07] and it seems like they're never going to
[1:09:09] get it but when the child begins to
[1:09:11] learn himself then he begins to
[1:09:14] accumulate the
[1:09:16] knowledge you see you it's just like a
[1:09:18] preacher it's just like a preacher he
[1:09:21] can study he can be in the right
[1:09:23] atmosphere but you let the people come
[1:09:25] in and they've got their mind on the
[1:09:27] world and they got their mind on this or
[1:09:29] maybe they had a blow up before church
[1:09:32] they're not on the same level as the
[1:09:35] minister is and they're not going to
[1:09:37] capture what the minister is putting
[1:09:39] down they're not on the same level of
[1:09:42] understanding but if the power of
[1:09:44] Revelation can sweep down through a
[1:09:47] Channel of faith that that person will
[1:09:50] begin to by faith begin to block out the
[1:09:53] things that happen today and the things
[1:09:55] that happened yesterday and to forget
[1:09:57] the things that took place it's a
[1:10:00] powerful thing when you can get on the
[1:10:02] same level as a preacher that's
[1:10:04] preaching the word then you begin to see
[1:10:07] Miracles take place that's when you
[1:10:09] begin to see manifestations of the Holy
[1:10:11] Ghost is when the preaching of the word
[1:10:14] and the people get to the same level
[1:10:16] then you watch as the atmosphere
[1:10:19] shifts I don't know why we're here but
[1:10:21] we're bringing you to an understanding
[1:10:23] by the preaching of the word what does
[1:10:25] the word literally do it brings you from
[1:10:28] the Molly Groves and it takes you into
[1:10:30] an atmosphere of a spiritual
[1:10:34] astronaut that's what the message did in
[1:10:36] this hour it brought you from an
[1:10:38] understanding as a Pentecostal babe and
[1:10:41] it brought you to a stature of a full
[1:10:43] perfect man ad dope man in Jesus
[1:10:48] Christ come on somebody when you was in
[1:10:51] Pentecost it was all works it was all
[1:10:53] this that or the other but what did the
[1:10:55] church do what did the message do in
[1:10:57] this generation it came to cap off your
[1:11:00] life by the token life of Jesus Christ
[1:11:04] when brother Bram draws out the Pyramid
[1:11:06] of the stature of a perfect man building
[1:11:08] up the man on faith Temperance the
[1:11:11] loveing kindness self-control and all of
[1:11:13] the fruits there building it out what
[1:11:16] does he do he caps It Off by the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost so when you
[1:11:21] receive Hallelujah when you receive the
[1:11:24] Holy Ghost you don't have to work your
[1:11:26] way into faith faith is a foundation you
[1:11:29] don't have to work your way into
[1:11:31] brotherly kindness if you get capped off
[1:11:33] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[1:11:36] of those virtues are in
[1:11:40] you hallelujah what are you talking
[1:11:43] about brother Andrew I'm talking about
[1:11:44] that there is a power in where you're
[1:11:47] born at just like when Cain and Abel
[1:11:50] when they were standing there in the
[1:11:52] Book of Genesis 4 and five that you'll
[1:11:54] begin to see by the seed that was on the
[1:11:56] inside of them what they were producing
[1:11:59] and you seen by the serpent seed what
[1:12:02] Cain begin to produce he accumulated
[1:12:05] Knowledge from his father is that right
[1:12:08] his serpent he was showing his seed but
[1:12:11] Abel by the seed that was on the inside
[1:12:14] of him accumulated Revelation showing
[1:12:17] that it had to be blood
[1:12:20] there what are you saying brother Andrew
[1:12:22] I'm saying that what you have
[1:12:23] accumulated in this hour is something
[1:12:26] greater than your own
[1:12:28] knowledge I'm saying no man taught you
[1:12:30] this I'm saying that the Holy Ghost did
[1:12:33] what he said that he would do that he
[1:12:35] would lead you he would guide you he
[1:12:37] would teach you the
[1:12:40] truth hallelujah one brother bandam
[1:12:43] comes and he preaches in
[1:12:45] 1963 on September the 1st he preaches a
[1:12:48] token
[1:12:50] message there brother brandom he comes
[1:12:52] in there and he's laying he's laying
[1:12:54] down there in final closing out final
[1:12:57] final chapters of the token there
[1:12:59] brother Bram is preaching at his own
[1:13:01] church and he's laying he's laying some
[1:13:03] fundamental Foundation Faith some real
[1:13:05] key truths that are laying there but
[1:13:08] brother randam comes in and he begins to
[1:13:11] he's coming down and he starts talking
[1:13:13] about the mystical Body of Christ and
[1:13:15] brother Brandon when he comes there he
[1:13:17] begins to Fumble around on the word of
[1:13:20] Mystic Body of Christ and he says it's
[1:13:23] the mythical Body of Christ we know what
[1:13:24] a myth Mythic we know what a myth is
[1:13:26] it's something that's false it's
[1:13:27] something that it's something that's
[1:13:29] made up and brother B said it's the
[1:13:31] mythical Body of Christ and notice
[1:13:34] brother brandham said if you a listen to
[1:13:36] it that the Holy Spirit stops brother
[1:13:38] brandham and said you said that
[1:13:41] wrong you said that wrong go back and
[1:13:44] say it again what did he do he stops and
[1:13:46] says that's why we need the Holy Spirit
[1:13:50] and not education he said it's the
[1:13:53] Mystic Body of Christ now goes on to say
[1:13:56] this he said now it'll be for something
[1:13:58] he said cuz he wouldn't have said it
[1:13:59] that way he said he is here he is here
[1:14:02] right now he's here right at the pulpit
[1:14:05] he's right out there it's him in him Is
[1:14:08] No Death in him is no sorrow in him is
[1:14:12] no weer in him is no sin in him is no
[1:14:15] sickness in him Is No Death and we are
[1:14:19] in
[1:14:20] him he said if Satan tries to hand you
[1:14:23] something like sickness just take your
[1:14:25] token and apply it oh my take your token
[1:14:28] and apply it that you are a purchased
[1:14:30] product of Jesus Christ the token stands
[1:14:33] that your fair is paid notice he says
[1:14:37] Satan says when you die you're lost say
[1:14:41] you're
[1:14:42] wrong you're wrong I have purchased I
[1:14:45] have the purchased product I am a
[1:14:47] purchased product I have the token what
[1:14:50] is the token he knows what it is
[1:14:56] he knows what it is well you say brother
[1:14:58] Andrew I don't necessarily know what the
[1:15:00] token is but Satan
[1:15:02] does he knows what it is he said don't
[1:15:05] fool with him he knows what it is he
[1:15:08] said now you might talk some of these
[1:15:09] preachers and they'd argue with it he
[1:15:11] said but not Satan he knows better he
[1:15:14] said he comes against it two or three
[1:15:16] times you know and he made a mistake of
[1:15:18] Temptation Satan knows what you're
[1:15:20] talking about just show that token and
[1:15:23] he'll Fly Away
[1:15:25] what am I talking about I'm talking
[1:15:27] about when Jesus is up there and Satan
[1:15:29] makes his three us helmets against Jesus
[1:15:32] on the lust of the flesh the pride of
[1:15:34] life and the lust of the eye what does
[1:15:36] he do he tempts him in his mortal body
[1:15:39] but Jesus don't use some Supernatural
[1:15:42] power he takes the same thing that
[1:15:44] you've been given in this hour to defeat
[1:15:47] Satan
[1:15:51] with he give you the greatest thing he
[1:15:53] ever could give you when he gave you the
[1:15:55] word of God and he said it's by this
[1:15:58] word it is
[1:16:04] written I think it's very powerful I
[1:16:08] think it's whole I think it's powerful
[1:16:11] because the Lord allowed us a glimpse
[1:16:13] into the supernatural right there
[1:16:16] because there are things about the
[1:16:17] supernatural that Humanity does not
[1:16:20] understand is that right there are
[1:16:22] things that happen in services like this
[1:16:24] that we don't understand understand
[1:16:26] there are things that we don't
[1:16:27] understand that is happening when
[1:16:28] somebody raises up and
[1:16:30] shouts there are things that happen when
[1:16:33] somebody raises up their hand we don't
[1:16:36] understand what's happening but it's
[1:16:38] supernatural actually if you study
[1:16:40] brother brandom you you can find it one
[1:16:42] time when brother B said did you see
[1:16:44] that lady slip up her hand right there
[1:16:45] he said the pillar of fire went across
[1:16:47] her when she raised her hand right there
[1:16:50] there are elements that are in this
[1:16:52] building that we don't fully understand
[1:16:55] but because of who we are it has given
[1:16:58] us an
[1:17:01] understanding I think it's powerful
[1:17:04] because we caught a glimpse right here
[1:17:06] of the supernatural that he uses the
[1:17:09] feebleness of humanity to show and prove
[1:17:13] he is the omnipotent one that there is
[1:17:16] one standing at the pulpit that maybe
[1:17:19] you don't see him maybe you don't
[1:17:21] recognize him but there is somebody that
[1:17:25] is still at the pulpit today and we are
[1:17:28] in him in him Is No Death in him is no
[1:17:31] weakness in him is no
[1:17:36] weakness hallelujah what did he say he
[1:17:39] said he's here right now at the pulit
[1:17:41] he's here out there maybe you don't see
[1:17:43] it maybe you don't understand it but he
[1:17:45] took the feebleness of William brandham
[1:17:48] and said say it again you didn't say it
[1:17:51] right the first time say it again
[1:17:57] I feel 10,000 vots running through me
[1:17:59] right
[1:18:00] now where'd you get that understanding
[1:18:03] brother H where did you get that power
[1:18:05] brother Timothy where did you get that
[1:18:08] understanding it came from another world
[1:18:11] it came from another
[1:18:14] realm why do you believe you're going in
[1:18:16] a Rapture I didn't get that
[1:18:18] understanding on my own why do you
[1:18:20] believe you have every right to preach
[1:18:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I didn't
[1:18:23] get it on my own but there came a world
[1:18:26] that tapped into this world and said
[1:18:29] you're born for this
[1:18:32] world
[1:18:33] Hallelujah tonight's your
[1:18:36] night tonight's the night to get the
[1:18:38] Holy Ghost tonight's the night to get
[1:18:41] your healing tonight's a night to get
[1:18:43] your
[1:18:45] deliverance
[1:18:47] hallelujah
[1:18:48] hallelujah where'd you get that
[1:18:50] understanding to think that it wasn't
[1:18:52] for days gone by it's for right
[1:18:57] now what is it somebody at the
[1:19:01] pulpit what was it it was an angel that
[1:19:04] was leading William brandham that would
[1:19:06] take him through the scriptures he
[1:19:07] didn't gain that knowledge all on his
[1:19:09] own it was somebody standing
[1:19:12] there Hallelujah when William brandom
[1:19:15] comes back after brother brother Neville
[1:19:18] stands there and preaches on Easter
[1:19:19] morning 1962 he said I went back home he
[1:19:23] said I wrote down a few few notes and he
[1:19:25] preaches a three and a half sermon three
[1:19:27] and a half hour sermon on the
[1:19:29] restoration of the brid tree on a few
[1:19:32] notes now tell me who was leading the
[1:19:35] Kentucky hillbilly through the
[1:19:37] Scriptures it wasn't the mind of a
[1:19:39] Kentucky man it was a mind of almighty
[1:19:43] God that was releasing dispensational
[1:19:46] dispensational changes in this
[1:19:51] hour Hallelujah
[1:19:55] what is it now watch
[1:19:59] what watch what Paul says in Ephesians
[1:20:02] 1 that the god at verse 17 that the god
[1:20:06] of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[1:20:08] Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[1:20:10] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[1:20:14] of the
[1:20:16] Pope in the knowledge of
[1:20:19] him it ain't the knowledge of William
[1:20:22] brandom this ain't the knowledge of
[1:20:23] Homer phas
[1:20:25] this ain't the knowledge of some man
[1:20:27] that's why William Brandon would stand
[1:20:29] there I believe it's recognizing your
[1:20:30] day in message he said you're not
[1:20:31] feeding on the mind of a man but you're
[1:20:33] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:20:36] the son of man I know that stumbles some
[1:20:38] people because they don't understand the
[1:20:40] son of man but the son of man is the
[1:20:44] word what was it it wasn't the seventh
[1:20:47] angel it was the mighty angel that was
[1:20:49] standing there notice what he says verse
[1:20:52] 18 that the eyes of your understanding
[1:20:55] being enlightened brother bham captures
[1:20:57] that in the adoption he said you
[1:20:59] understand with your heart he said
[1:21:01] that's what he's talking about you look
[1:21:03] with your eye but you see with your
[1:21:08] heart what did Jesus say to us if you
[1:21:11] seek with me with your whole heart then
[1:21:15] you'll find
[1:21:16] me what he goes on to say that the eyes
[1:21:19] of your understand being enlightened
[1:21:21] that you might know what is the hope of
[1:21:23] his calling and what the Riches of the
[1:21:25] glory of his inheritance in the Saints
[1:21:27] there some wonderful truth right there
[1:21:29] well follow me down there to verse 22
[1:21:32] notice what he says and Heath put all
[1:21:34] things under his feet and gave him to be
[1:21:37] the head over all things to the church
[1:21:40] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:21:43] that filth all in
[1:21:47] all said now if my body has the power
[1:21:49] over all things then what my body is is
[1:21:53] what I am
[1:21:56] now I know I'm not the only child here
[1:21:58] I'm still a child but I don't talk like
[1:22:01] a child no
[1:22:02] more I don't understand as child no more
[1:22:06] but I I know that I'm not the only child
[1:22:08] in the
[1:22:09] building but when I was little I was
[1:22:11] little one time we was getting ready for
[1:22:13] church and me and Alan Price was out

[1:22:40] home when
[1:22:42] Mama come out
[1:22:47] there I thought I was a
[1:22:49] child I was beginning to understand that
[1:22:53] she was an adult
[1:22:56] I looked at her I said Mama just like
[1:22:58] any old child would do I said Mama it
[1:23:00] wasn't me it was my

[1:23:25] standing there was a person
[1:23:28] involved there's a person involved so
[1:23:31] you can't separate me from my hand
[1:23:35] William brandom said who is me who owns
[1:23:37] his hand so what my body is is what I am
[1:23:42] so what my body does is what I am so
[1:23:46] Jesus said that all that I am is under
[1:23:50] my feet
[1:23:55] do you hear what I'm saying to
[1:23:57] [Applause]
[1:23:59] you that you are my body that I fill you
[1:24:04] with all and all that is within me if my
[1:24:07] hands are me if my feet are me it ain't
[1:24:10] my feet it's Jesus feet it ain't my
[1:24:14] knowledge it's his
[1:24:18] knowledge oh blessed be the name of the
[1:24:21] Lord now are we the son of God not
[1:24:25] someday in the future not someday coming
[1:24:29] but right now is the Church of the
[1:24:31] Living God under an
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:38] understanding Hallelujah I saw brother
[1:24:40] Gabriel lay his hand on somebody and I
[1:24:42] watched him get healed it wasn't brother
[1:24:44] Gabriel it was the body of Christ I saw
[1:24:47] brother Ron have a vision of
[1:24:49] coming back here coming back to a full
[1:24:51] restoration it wasn't brother Ron it was
[1:24:54] a
[1:24:56] body I saw Zoe get her healing but it
[1:25:01] wasn't it was a body
[1:25:03] move I saw sister Elena buts receive
[1:25:07] healing from stage four
[1:25:11] Loma somebody came to a recognition who
[1:25:15] they are as sons of
[1:25:18] God we're not leaning on our own
[1:25:21] understanding we're leaning on the UN
[1:25:23] Everlasting arm
[1:25:26] arms oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:25:29] he that lath wisdom let him ask and God
[1:25:32] will give it
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:37] liberally I feel the Winds of Change
[1:25:41] that's moving across the body of Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ you're no longer a chicken you're
[1:25:45] no longer got Barnyard identity you no
[1:25:48] longer got Barnard
[1:25:51] knowledge you're an eagle
[1:25:54] come up
[1:25:57] here when I was a chicken I understood I
[1:26:01] a chicken but when I recognized I was an
[1:26:04] eagle I didn't think like a chicken no
[1:26:07] more I didn't talk like a chicken no
[1:26:10] more I recognized who I was and William
[1:26:14] brandham said in the rising of the sun
[1:26:16] he said that changed their Dynamics the
[1:26:20] Dynamics Chang their language
[1:26:29] I know it's a paradox but Satan is so
[1:26:32] scared of you he's so scared of you
[1:26:36] Gavin he's so scared of you that he
[1:26:38] would try to Rob your life from a little
[1:26:41] bitty old child and keep you from coming
[1:26:43] to the recognition of who you are but
[1:26:46] Satan didn't have
[1:26:50] enough because a Daddy had an
[1:26:53] understanding
[1:26:54] House of Hell give way in the name of
[1:26:57] Jesus
[1:27:00] Christ that's what's so powerful about
[1:27:02] you brother Denny is you recognize your
[1:27:04] position House of Hell give way in the
[1:27:07] name of
[1:27:13] Jesus
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:20] Hallelujah when it comes to the Book of
[1:27:22] Esther
[1:27:25] which is you of coming to your
[1:27:30] position it's a beautiful it's a
[1:27:33] beautiful type of Christ the bride of
[1:27:36] Christ but the Bible tells us in Esther
[1:27:40] chapter 6 that the King was having a
[1:27:42] sleepless
[1:27:45] night and he went
[1:27:47] there and he asked that the scriptures
[1:27:50] be delivered unto
[1:27:52] him and when he took the
[1:27:55] book brother Jason Jackson brought this
[1:27:58] out he said that when he took the book
[1:28:00] he said there's a tradition in Jewish
[1:28:02] law that said the winds blew the
[1:28:06] scripture over to the spot where Mori
[1:28:11] reminded and sered notice that there was
[1:28:14] somebody that was attacking the kingdom
[1:28:17] that it brought it to a position the
[1:28:19] winds rolled the scriptures into
[1:28:23] position what am I saying unto you that
[1:28:26] there is a church that has that has that
[1:28:29] cannot
[1:28:31] sleep she has been woke up by the sh
[1:28:35] Glory by the sounding of the seven
[1:28:39] Thunders uttering their voices she's
[1:28:41] been wake woke up to the fact that
[1:28:44] there's a fire in Her Bones there's an
[1:28:47] anointing on the inside of her that
[1:28:49] wherever she goes she has a third pole
[1:28:52] in her wherever she speaks she has a
[1:28:55] third pole in her and she's been woke up
[1:28:58] that the same fire that fell on the day
[1:29:01] of Pentecost it's the same
[1:29:04] fire what am I saying I'm saying the
[1:29:06] same sword that fell in William bram's
[1:29:09] hand after there in Sabino Canyon is the
[1:29:11] same
[1:29:13] sword that is in the bride's hand right
[1:29:16] now you've been woke up to the thought
[1:29:19] or to the fact that this ain't just a
[1:29:22] denominational Revival
[1:29:26] this ain't some emotional
[1:29:28] workup I'm going preach to you real
[1:29:30] quick this ain't some emotional workup
[1:29:34] this ain't something that a man is doing
[1:29:36] but you have been woke up to the fact
[1:29:38] that this is a brid's
[1:29:43] Revival ah come on somebody it's changed
[1:29:47] it's change it here what am I saying I'm
[1:29:50] saying you need to change your
[1:29:52] mind you need to change your mind we
[1:29:55] living in an hour where men have lost
[1:29:57] the mindset of who they are men think
[1:30:00] they're women and women think they're
[1:30:03] men men have made up their mind that
[1:30:06] they want to change they want to change
[1:30:09] from this gender to that gender but the
[1:30:12] Bride of Jesus Christ has made up her
[1:30:16] mind I won't be Leia I won't be lukewarm
[1:30:21] I won't be
[1:30:22] Pentecostal but I'll be an acts to
[1:30:26] Church of the Living
[1:30:30] God brother Andrew I've been in a
[1:30:32] message for 30 years sometimes you need
[1:30:35] a
[1:30:37] change you can get in a tradition of
[1:30:39] setting in your Pew and just enjoying
[1:30:42] worship the way it is or the way that it
[1:30:44] was what you need to do is
[1:30:46] change change your
[1:30:50] mind come on somebody if you've been
[1:30:52] praying the same old prayer for the past
[1:30:54] 15 years and you ain't seen nothing
[1:30:57] happen it's time you change your
[1:30:59] language change your prayer routine
[1:31:02] change how you read the Bible change how
[1:31:04] you listen to the
[1:31:06] message I ain't talking about something
[1:31:08] on the external I'm talking about
[1:31:10] something on the internal because you
[1:31:12] can change your hair you can change your
[1:31:14] dress you can change your makeup but a
[1:31:18] pig can change it same way but it's
[1:31:20] still a pig on the inside
[1:31:24] but if you get
[1:31:27] baptized not just with an anointing not
[1:31:30] just with a Zeal but with a genuine
[1:31:32] token
[1:31:36] life it'll change your
[1:31:47] body
[1:31:49] well I felt the move of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:51] years ago but a sudden
[1:31:54] understands he can have it
[1:31:57] again I felt to when brother Homer was
[1:32:00] behind the pit you can have an
[1:32:02] understanding you can feel it again I
[1:32:05] got filled 50 years ago but there's an
[1:32:08] understanding you can get filled
[1:32:10] again come on somebody if we saw Maru
[1:32:14] Mariah puit receive healing over her
[1:32:19] body then why can't he do it for Sister
[1:32:21] Barbara then why can't he do it for
[1:32:23] sister to Kaye if he's that kind of a
[1:32:26] God and I happen to believe that he is
[1:32:29] because I got an understanding he is the
[1:32:31] Lord Our God and he changes
[1:32:35] not where'd you get that understanding
[1:32:38] from I got it from my father he said I
[1:32:41] came in my father's name but you receed
[1:32:43] me not but to them that received me to
[1:32:46] them I gave power to be the come the
[1:32:48] sons of God
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:57] where' you get the understanding that
[1:32:58] you can think that cancer can leave a
[1:33:00] body because we watched it leave sister
[1:33:03] Hade Waldorf when she told her husband
[1:33:05] said if I die take me through that
[1:33:07] prayer line even if I die it was a
[1:33:10] testimony that she died right there and
[1:33:13] she was behind the curtain and they
[1:33:15] called William brandham to come over
[1:33:17] there and lay his hands on her and pray
[1:33:19] for her he said I was just going over
[1:33:21] there to encourage the family he said
[1:33:24] but all of a sudden he said I begin to
[1:33:26] pray and I felt a hand
[1:33:29] jerk and she come back to life I'm
[1:33:32] telling you that Doug Hill ain't the
[1:33:34] only one that can come back to life
[1:33:37] again I say by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:41] that
[1:33:44] [Applause]
[1:33:51] prodical what good you going to do to
[1:33:53] talk about the days gone by what good is
[1:33:56] it going to do for you take a man that's
[1:33:57] freezing to death and paint him a cold
[1:34:00] painted fire and set him out there
[1:34:01] beside it said try to get warm by it
[1:34:03] he'll never get warm what Good's it
[1:34:06] going to do to try to present to the
[1:34:07] Church of the Living God and have a
[1:34:09] picture of the Holy Ghost in
[1:34:12] Fire come on somebody what they need is
[1:34:15] a
[1:34:20] reality I tell you right now I respect
[1:34:22] the pillar of Fire I respect that
[1:34:25] picture and I would rather you tell me
[1:34:27] that you look at the pillar fire that is
[1:34:29] hanging over William brandom than for
[1:34:31] you to sit here and say you saw the
[1:34:34] pillar of fire sweeping into this room
[1:34:37] why because William brandham said that
[1:34:39] your eyes can play trick on you he said
[1:34:41] but the mechanical device can't lie so
[1:34:44] for you to recognize that that's a
[1:34:46] pillar of
[1:34:47] fire it's a powerful thing but we don't
[1:34:51] want just a picture of it we want the
[1:34:54] reality of it well what are you talking
[1:34:56] about brother Andrew I'm talking about
[1:34:58] when you showed up in this building
[1:35:00] tonight that you are the reality that
[1:35:03] the purifier has returned to the
[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:13] church now brother random when it comes
[1:35:17] to this morning church
[1:35:19] age he said now he said now comes our
[1:35:23] Triumph
[1:35:24] triumphal Capstone on the baptism of the
[1:35:26] Holy Ghost and he turns to J Galatians 4
[1:35:29] and verse4 but when the fullness of time
[1:35:32] was come God sent forth his son made of
[1:35:35] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:35:38] that were under the law that we might
[1:35:41] receive the adoption of sons and because
[1:35:44] you are Sons God ha sent forth the
[1:35:47] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:35:50] crying Abba
[1:35:52] Father when wherefore Thou Art no more a
[1:35:55] servant but a
[1:36:01] son Thou Art no more a
[1:36:04] servant but a
[1:36:09] son come on prodigal come on prodigal I
[1:36:12] can go back to my father's house and I
[1:36:15] can be a servant there but he was always
[1:36:19] a
[1:36:20] son he was always a son
[1:36:24] no more a servant but a son and of a son
[1:36:26] than an heir of God through Christ there
[1:36:28] it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon
[1:36:31] the cross and accomplished Redemption
[1:36:34] restoring to original owner by means of
[1:36:36] purchase or paying the price thereby
[1:36:39] placed us as Sons he did not make us
[1:36:43] Sons for we were already Sons but he
[1:36:47] placed us as Sons for as long as we were
[1:36:50] in the world in the flesh we could not
[1:36:52] be recognized as
[1:36:55] Sons we were held captive by the devil
[1:36:58] but we were Sons nonetheless and hear
[1:37:01] this and because you are Sons God hath
[1:37:04] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[1:37:07] your hearts whereby you cry father
[1:37:10] father notice what he says he said upon
[1:37:13] whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost
[1:37:16] Sons at Corinth upon sons while they
[1:37:20] heard the
[1:37:21] word what is a baptism of what is the
[1:37:25] baptism with the Holy
[1:37:27] Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you
[1:37:31] into the body of
[1:37:35] Christ what is the baptism with the Holy
[1:37:38] Ghost brother random it is the bapt it
[1:37:40] is the spirit baptizing you into the
[1:37:43] body of Christ it is the new birth it is
[1:37:47] the spirit of God coming in and feeling
[1:37:49] you after you have repented having heard
[1:37:52] his word and been baptized in water as
[1:37:55] an answer of good conscience towards God
[1:37:59] what am I saying that you no longer have
[1:38:01] the mindset of a servant you have the
[1:38:04] mindset of an adult in Christ Jesus
[1:38:07] that's why William Brandon would say
[1:38:09] that every son when he comes to his
[1:38:11] position that God gives him a checkbook
[1:38:15] and sign at the bottom of that checkbook
[1:38:17] is the name of Jesus
[1:38:21] Christ what am I saying to you I'm
[1:38:23] saying that you ought to have an
[1:38:25] understanding brother B said if John D
[1:38:28] Rockefeller would come here and he would
[1:38:30] write me and I would ask him for a
[1:38:31] million dollars to build me a church he
[1:38:33] said I would be able to cash it because
[1:38:36] I believe that John D Ro Rockefeller has
[1:38:39] the money in his
[1:38:41] bank if Trump walks into this building
[1:38:44] and I ask him for a million dollars to
[1:38:46] build me a church I got
[1:38:49] confidence that he could build me a
[1:38:52] church so if y'all know him call him
[1:38:55] up cuz they coming and we going to need
[1:38:58] a
[1:39:04] building he said now if I could do that
[1:39:06] with John D Rockefeller how much more
[1:39:09] could I do that with Jesus Christ when I
[1:39:12] know he's got everything when I know he
[1:39:14] owns it all when I know that he owns
[1:39:17] everything then how much more should I
[1:39:19] be able to go to Jesus Christ and say
[1:39:21] father you said at and you shall receive
[1:39:25] you said by your stripes we are
[1:39:28] healed what am I saying to you that you
[1:39:30] ought to understand that there's healing
[1:39:32] for you you ought to understand that
[1:39:35] faith is the key that unlocks every
[1:39:37] single promise you ought to understand
[1:39:39] that depression is underneath of
[1:39:42] you you ought to understand that cancer
[1:39:45] is nothing but a password to Jesus
[1:39:47] Christ you ought to understand that
[1:39:49] every devil has to bow to the name of
[1:39:51] Jesus Christ you ought to understand
[1:39:54] that you are not here to be tormented by
[1:39:56] Satan but you are here to torment Satan
[1:40:07] himself now the message ain't just
[1:40:10] something that you set back and press
[1:40:11] play and it comes
[1:40:12] alive the message ain't something
[1:40:15] something that's just easy believism of
[1:40:17] well I profess that God sent a prophet I
[1:40:20] accept it and move on absolutely not the
[1:40:23] me message of the hour is an experience
[1:40:26] with the message himself the message is
[1:40:29] a life the message is a power that's why
[1:40:32] David when he was back there when he was
[1:40:34] nothing but a 12y old boy Ruddy he was a
[1:40:37] cute little fell but he knew who he was
[1:40:40] and when D when Saul when Saul rejected
[1:40:43] the kingdom Samuel came and poured the
[1:40:46] anointing oil upon Little
[1:40:50] David what was it you're not a Christian
[1:40:53] by your own
[1:40:54] desire you're a Christian because of his
[1:40:57] desire you're in position because he put
[1:41:00] you in
[1:41:02] position and when David was standing
[1:41:05] there and the anointing oil was poured
[1:41:07] over David's life what was it William
[1:41:10] brandham said that David was
[1:41:12] positionally placed as the king of
[1:41:14] Israel right
[1:41:16] there and he said when
[1:41:20] you when you are placed positionally in
[1:41:23] Christ Jesus as Kings and Priests he
[1:41:26] said the moment you receive the Holy
[1:41:28] Spirit God places you in the Kingdom as
[1:41:31] an
[1:41:32] aor what am I saying I'm saying you
[1:41:35] ain't got to wait for
[1:41:38] this you ain't got to come to
[1:41:41] recognition you ain't got to you ain't
[1:41:43] got to come to some spot where you wait
[1:41:44] to be a Son of God you ain't got to come
[1:41:47] to a spot where you wonder if you're
[1:41:48] adopted or not you ain't got to sit back
[1:41:50] and let some doctor of divinity tell you
[1:41:52] you got the holy ghost or not but if
[1:41:55] you're a son act like a
[1:41:57] son come on somebody if you're a son
[1:42:00] live like a son if you're a son dress
[1:42:04] like a son if you're a son preach like a
[1:42:07] son if you're a son act like a son speak
[1:42:10] like a son dance like a son act like a
[1:42:19] son
[1:42:20] Hallelujah I know it's a paradox
[1:42:23] I know it's a paradox but there's
[1:42:25] somebody right here in this room right
[1:42:27] now that is fellowshipping with an angel
[1:42:30] there's somebody that's bumping into
[1:42:32] Angels there's somebody that's
[1:42:33] recognizing that he's talking about me
[1:42:37] they saw themselves in the mirror of his
[1:42:39] word they recognize who they
[1:42:41] are it's a paradox but you're
[1:42:44] fellowshipping with him by the
[1:42:45] understanding of the written word that
[1:42:47] there is a living true God and his bride
[1:42:50] is dressing herself right here
[1:42:53] by the spoken word and they're living
[1:42:56] out the message of the
[1:43:00] hour you got a little bit more
[1:43:03] time John said in John 5 and 20 and we
[1:43:06] know somebody say it with me and we know
[1:43:10] that the Son of God has come and has
[1:43:12] given us an understanding that we might
[1:43:15] know him that is true and that we are in
[1:43:17] him that is true that is true even in
[1:43:21] his son Jesus Christ This is is true
[1:43:24] this is the true God and eternal life
[1:43:28] notice when Paul comes to the Church of
[1:43:32] coloss I love chapter 2 probably one of
[1:43:35] my favorite favorite books of the Bible
[1:43:38] but when Paul begins to line out some
[1:43:40] things that Jesus was God incarnate that
[1:43:43] he was made manifest here on Earth in
[1:43:45] the flesh to give us what God was and
[1:43:48] then Paul begins to tell the believer
[1:43:50] that you are complete in him notice what
[1:43:51] he says in verse six and you have
[1:43:53] therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord
[1:43:56] so walk ye in him notice in him rooted
[1:43:59] and built up in him and establish in the
[1:44:02] faith as ye have been taught abounding
[1:44:04] there in with Thanksgiving verse n for
[1:44:07] in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:44:09] god hi Bally and you are complete in
[1:44:16] him and you are complete in him which is
[1:44:19] the head of all
[1:44:21] principality and Power
[1:44:24] power in him now notice when you study
[1:44:28] out that word
[1:44:29] complete it means fulfill it means to
[1:44:32] end it means to make full it means to
[1:44:35] fill up it means to F to the full to
[1:44:40] cause to abound to furnace or Supply
[1:44:42] liberally I abound I am liberally
[1:44:45] supplied to fill to the
[1:44:49] top so that nothing shall be wanting to
[1:44:52] fo
[1:44:53] measure feel to the
[1:44:57] brim you can't be full of the world and
[1:45:01] full of God at the same
[1:45:05] time come on somebody if anybody love
[1:45:08] the world and the things of the world
[1:45:09] the love of God is not even in him is
[1:45:11] that right so you can't be full of
[1:45:13] yourself and expect to be full of God so
[1:45:16] and you are complete you are full to the
[1:45:21] brim as a songwriter said it I'm so full
[1:45:25] that my saucer is full that my cup is
[1:45:28] running over and my saucer is full of it
[1:45:32] that is why the token message that
[1:45:35] William Brandon preaches is so important
[1:45:37] to believe to the believer because it's
[1:45:40] only the token is only applied at the
[1:45:44] evening time that the token is a life
[1:45:47] blood of the Lamb taking residence upon
[1:45:50] the believer's soul that it's more than
[1:45:53] just a baptism that justifies you that
[1:45:55] it's more than just a baptism baptism of
[1:45:58] the spirit that sanctifies you it's more
[1:46:00] than just a baptism of speaking in
[1:46:02] tongues and a gift of knowledge but the
[1:46:05] token
[1:46:07] hallelujah hallelujah the token is a
[1:46:10] sign and it is a proof that there is an
[1:46:13] indwelling power from on high the token
[1:46:17] is a sign that you are Rapture Ready
[1:46:24] the
[1:46:26] token is no longer a chemical but it's a
[1:46:29] literal life of Jesus
[1:46:33] Christ that's why William Bram when when
[1:46:35] William brandham is standing there in
[1:46:37] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:46:39] said that's what the devil's howling
[1:46:40] about he said because it's being
[1:46:44] revealed I know I maybe I know I know
[1:46:47] you might think I'm crazy but I
[1:46:48] literally feel the house of hell right
[1:46:50] now I literally feel it I literally feel
[1:46:53] it because Satan recognizes he is losing
[1:46:56] position he is losing his portion he is
[1:46:59] losing Sons when they come to their
[1:47:02] recognition hell is Hing now I ain't
[1:47:05] doing like brother brandom talked about
[1:47:07] with some people sniffing out of devil
[1:47:09] but I literally feel the vibrations of
[1:47:11] Hell pulsating against the very idea
[1:47:15] that God could feel you so full of
[1:47:21] yourself the hell of hell are nervous
[1:47:24] right now there's a blood that has been
[1:47:28] poured out upon the Church of Jesus
[1:47:30] Christ the life of
[1:47:34] God I rebuke every devil in hell that
[1:47:37] tries to tell you that you made a
[1:47:39] mistake and you got a complex on your
[1:47:42] life and says you can't have the Holy
[1:47:44] Ghost I rebuke that foul
[1:47:47] Spirit you can have the Holy Ghost you
[1:47:51] can have the adoption Road
[1:47:53] you can be recognized as a
[1:47:55] [Applause]
[1:48:04] son what are you talking about brother
[1:48:06] Andrew I'm talking about devils are
[1:48:09] nervous because there is a body that is
[1:48:12] coming under the headship of the word of
[1:48:14] God they recognize that this
[1:48:16] intelligence of faith that she has that
[1:48:18] unlocks the door she didn't get this
[1:48:20] knowledge from some man idea she didn't
[1:48:23] get this let me let me say it like this
[1:48:25] you didn't get this by the preaching of
[1:48:26] the
[1:48:28] word well that's that's that's a little
[1:48:30] that's a little out there brother Andrew
[1:48:31] I'm saying the same thing that William
[1:48:33] brandham said about Luke chapter 24 he
[1:48:35] said when the O when the preaching of
[1:48:37] the word didn't even open their eyes
[1:48:39] because Jesus took them through Modern
[1:48:40] events made clear by prophecy and he
[1:48:42] preached to them from Genesis the
[1:48:43] revelation of who he was and the
[1:48:45] preached word didn't even open he said
[1:48:48] but when he came
[1:48:50] in brother Timothy he's in
[1:48:54] here but when he got on the inside
[1:48:56] brother Joel when he locked the door on
[1:48:59] the
[1:49:00] outside when he sealed you so full of
[1:49:03] the Holy
[1:49:06] Ghost what' he do what he do with Gus's
[1:49:09] daughter he had to kick all the
[1:49:11] unbelievers out before he could perform
[1:49:13] a miracle what' he do when they pulled
[1:49:16] on him when they literally pulled on him
[1:49:19] Adam said Don't Pass Me By don't leave
[1:49:23] me in my depression don't leave me in my
[1:49:26] situation I know there's something
[1:49:28] special about this message but don't
[1:49:30] leave me here where I
[1:49:32] am and when they ped on him with a third
[1:49:37] pole Ministry say come in here with
[1:49:40] us he did something that he did before
[1:49:44] it was the same one in the first and the
[1:49:47] second pole but then magnified the third
[1:49:50] it was the same one
[1:49:55] oh watch it when you fold on
[1:49:59] him you begin to recognize I am a
[1:50:03] son I know you may have looked at a
[1:50:06] water tower for some
[1:50:07] time but you're a
[1:50:10] son you may have forgot what you was
[1:50:12] supposed to be you may have been Shell
[1:50:15] Shocked by the world but there's a water
[1:50:17] tower in this place that you could come
[1:50:19] running back to
[1:50:22] brother Andrew ain't listening to the
[1:50:23] message there's a water tower in this
[1:50:25] place I ain't turned on a tape in in
[1:50:28] maybe 18 days and I I didn't got caught
[1:50:30] on God there's a water tower in this
[1:50:33] place I got called on God I felt like
[1:50:36] God gave up on me I felt like God
[1:50:39] disappointed me and I'm disappointed in
[1:50:41] God there's a water tower here recognize
[1:50:44] who you are recognize your
[1:50:50] position Hallelujah
[1:50:54] hallelujah
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:50:56] hallelujah I Believe by the preaching of
[1:50:58] the word that the Holy Ghost will fall
[1:51:00] upon
[1:51:01] you but I believe that if it falls upon
[1:51:03] you it'll line you up with the word
[1:51:06] because while Peter yet spoke these
[1:51:08] words in Acts 10:44 the Holy Ghost fell
[1:51:10] on them but they didn't stay in that
[1:51:12] position they went to the water and got
[1:51:15] baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:51:18] Christ the word places you in scriptural
[1:51:21] position
[1:51:27] what is it I done grabbed a hold of
[1:51:29] something that won't let go of
[1:51:32] me come on somebody you know what I'm
[1:51:35] talking about you know what I'm talking
[1:51:37] about sticking rubber bands around your
[1:51:38] arm and waiting for the
[1:51:41] feeling to come running through your
[1:51:43] veins but I'm talking about something
[1:51:45] that thing will leave you that thing
[1:51:48] will leave you desperate that thing will
[1:51:49] leave you with a headache but I'm
[1:51:51] talking about something will never leave
[1:51:53] you it'll keep you it'll be with you it
[1:51:56] is a sustainer it is a protector it is a
[1:51:59] deliverer it is a way
[1:52:04] maker I done grabbed a hold of
[1:52:07] inoculation I've done grabbed a hold of
[1:52:09] the same inoculation that the mother
[1:52:10] Mary grabbed a hold of that when she got
[1:52:12] up there when she got up there and she
[1:52:15] got herself good and shut in when the
[1:52:17] rest of the world was making fun of them
[1:52:19] for being shut in she got up there
[1:52:25] what am I saying to you if she had to go
[1:52:26] up
[1:52:27] there and she had to get drunk on the
[1:52:30] Holy Ghost then you do
[1:52:34] too come on somebody if Peter had to go
[1:52:37] up there then so do you if Paul had to
[1:52:40] get the Holy Ghost then so do you come
[1:52:43] on somebody if William brandham had to
[1:52:45] get the Holy Ghost then so do you she
[1:52:47] grabbed a hold of inoculation that there
[1:52:50] was a bomb in Gilead
[1:52:58] when she come out of there they come out
[1:53:00] of there speaking and every man heard in
[1:53:02] their own language what was it God had
[1:53:04] given them another language that they
[1:53:06] didn't even understand on their own what
[1:53:08] was it it was an understanding from
[1:53:10] Heaven they didn't even know that
[1:53:13] language you didn't know this language
[1:53:16] when you was a Catholic you didn't know
[1:53:18] this language when you was an Apostolic
[1:53:20] you didn't know this language when you
[1:53:22] were the
[1:53:23] Methodist but you got an understanding
[1:53:26] this is your
[1:53:30] language and Nathan a was making fun of
[1:53:32] her when she come out there and she was
[1:53:35] shouting sister Gabrielle and she was
[1:53:37] dancing down through there people was
[1:53:39] making fun of her and criticizing her
[1:53:41] but William brandham said in in in the
[1:53:43] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:53:45] he said it attracts the vultures but it
[1:53:47] attracts the Eagles as
[1:53:49] well and the vultures might have made
[1:53:52] fun of little Mary up there but she done
[1:53:54] got a hold of something that wasn't
[1:53:56] going to let her
[1:53:59] go what am I saying to you I'm saying
[1:54:02] there something got a hold of me where
[1:54:05] something got a hold of me I said

[1:54:15] to a meeting one night and my heart it
[1:54:18] got right I said something it got a ho
[1:54:23] hold to
[1:54:26] me what happened they was criticizing
[1:54:29] Mary but Mary didn't care brother
[1:54:32] brandom said she done been
[1:54:36] branded and she was having herself a fit
[1:54:39] but she didn't care what the mockers was
[1:54:42] saying they said it reminded me about
[1:54:45] when I was out there on the troubles
[1:54:46] River out there in Colorado he said when
[1:54:48] we was throwing down them old calves he
[1:54:50] said them calves had been about a year
[1:54:52] old he said some of them was big and had
[1:54:54] a little th in them he said but we roped
[1:54:56] them and threw them down he said they
[1:54:58] didn't like it for a minute he said but
[1:55:01] we knew who they were
[1:55:04] afterwards we knew who they belonged to

[1:55:29] redeemed me that it saved me that it

[2:02:42] example as a sign that they are here to
[2:02:45] receive the adoption Ro of the Holy
[2:02:47] Ghost and I pray that they would have an
[2:02:49] abstract title deed that the same one
[2:02:52] that came for them 2,000 years ago is
[2:02:55] the same God that is preparing for them
