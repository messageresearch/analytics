[30:29] says dear dear Full Gospel lighthouse
[30:31] Tyburn aqua Church family we have
[30:34] certainly missed being able to assemble
[30:37] ourselves together according to the
[30:39] Bible has taught us to do so in Hebrews
[30:42] 10:25 not forsaking the Assemblies of
[30:45] ourselves together as the manner as some
[30:48] is but exhorting one another and so much
[30:51] more as you see that Day approaching
[30:54] although we've been very grateful for
[30:58] the opportunity to greet you and bring
[31:00] forth preaching of the word via
[31:02] livestream truly it has been a blessing
[31:05] of the Lord from many local and around
[31:08] the world and even those who are not
[31:10] believers have been tuning in and want
[31:13] to thank each and every one of you who
[31:15] has been as of now the government is
[31:19] introducing a phase one of reopening the
[31:22] state and easing restrictions for
[31:25] gatherings and asking for 50 percent
[31:27] capacity of the gatherings at churches
[31:31] again we do not believe that this is a
[31:33] religious persecution that necessitates
[31:36] the need to divide defy our government's
[31:39] requests as they are trying to contain
[31:42] the virus we want to do our part to make
[31:46] sure we don't increase the spread of
[31:48] this virus and our congregation nor hurt
[31:52] our assembly in any way health-wise nor
[31:55] affect anyone's employment brother Ron
[31:58] and brother Andrew have come up with
[32:01] some guidelines for us to try and resume
[32:04] services in a safe manner
[32:05] these guidelines may seem difficult and
[32:08] different we were looking for a safe way
[32:11] for us to attend services in person
[32:14] we're trusting this is only for a short
[32:17] time until we can once again resume a
[32:20] sense of Norma C and our services the
[32:25] following recommendations and guidelines
[32:26] that we would like to
[32:28] asked for our teamwork in trying to
[32:33] abide with social distancing and at some
[32:36] time give us a chance to attend at least
[32:38] one service a week in person first of
[32:43] all we would like to ask if you asked
[32:48] you not to come to church if you or
[32:51] anyone in your family are sick or having
[32:53] symptoms of coughing runny nose fever or
[32:58] sore throat we ask there be no shaking
[33:01] of hands nor hugging anyone during this
[33:05] time repeat we ask there be no shaking
[33:08] hands or hugging anyone at this time as
[33:12] Paul says salute thy brethren when you
[33:16] arrive at church we will have outside we
[33:20] will have the outside of the sanctuary
[33:22] doors propped open so no one has to open
[33:25] or close them
[33:26] the deacons or Usher's will seat you in
[33:30] the sanctuary in order to maintain
[33:32] social distancing six feet apart you
[33:36] will be seated with your entire family
[33:38] you may not be able to sit in your
[33:42] normal location in the sanctuary any of
[33:46] your belongings that you have left at
[33:48] the church such as blankets bags toys
[33:51] etc will be moved to the back near the
[33:54] tape library for you to grab and take
[33:57] with you once you leave service the
[34:00] local and state authorities have
[34:02] recommended that we wear face masks or
[34:04] coverings while gathering we would like
[34:07] you to we would like to ask everyone
[34:09] that has their own face covering to wear
[34:11] it when coming to services if you do not
[34:15] have a face covering we will provide one
[34:18] with for you before entering the church
[34:22] please wear the face mask until you are
[34:25] seated in the sanctuary the decision to
[34:28] leave your face covering on and the
[34:31] sanctuary during service would be left
[34:33] up to each individual at their own
[34:35] discretion we will have multiple hand
[34:38] sanitizing stations set up
[34:41] as always please wash your hands
[34:45] repeat wash your hands I might need to
[34:52] say that one again
[34:54] wash your hands I like some of the
[34:58] guidelines that's been set up that
[34:59] people are starting to do wear glove
[35:01] washing their hands I'd like to see the
[35:04] ratio of flu illnesses compared to kovat
[35:07] now after people's washing their hands
[35:10] with trying to maintain social dis dude
[35:13] to the size of the congregation we can
[35:16] only accommodate a certain amount of
[35:18] people in the sanctuary therefore we
[35:21] would like half of our congregation to
[35:23] attend on Saturday night at 7:00 and the
[35:27] other half Sunday morning at 11:10 of Li
[35:32] the plan to start these in-person
[35:34] services is Saturday May the 23rd and
[35:39] Sunday May the 24th on Saturday nights
[35:43] we would like those who normally sit on
[35:47] the right side brother Joe and brother
[35:55] Vernon side for Saturday night and on
[35:59] Sunday mornings those who normally sit
[36:01] on the left side as you enter the
[36:04] sanctuary to attend on Sunday mornings
[36:07] the side brother Shannon and brother
[36:09] Alden sit on this will give us adequate
[36:13] space for everyone to sit six feet from
[36:15] the congregants also the musicians and
[36:18] sound technicians and their families can
[36:21] attend both services if they feel
[36:23] comfortable enough to do so it would be
[36:26] greatly appreciated we are asking there
[36:30] to be no congregation and the vestibule
[36:33] bathrooms or nurseries nurseries are
[36:38] going to be held for nursing babies only
[36:40] and those that need diaper changes

[37:09] uh sure 'z will dismiss the congregation
[37:11] by rows back to front to allow everyone

[37:25] no shaking of hands nor hugging anyone
[37:28] during this time as Paul said salute thy
[37:32] brethren we will receive tithes and

[45:53] I'll tell you what that'll make you feel
[45:56] like running this morning running the
[45:58] last mile home a man what a what a
[46:01] wonderful thought this morning that
[46:04] we're longing for home and to know that
[46:08] we're we're nearing the gate nearing the
[46:10] door as it were and we just we just know
[46:14] that it's the bride's time and so it's
[46:16] it's time for us to to take a rapture
[46:19] and we're certainly looking forward
[46:21] forward to the coming of the Lord and we
[46:24] know that he is appearing to us in so
[46:26] many ways and speaking to us through his
[46:28] word thank the Lord for this word of
[46:31] this hour this message that has come by
[46:33] our way and ministered to our hearts and
[46:35] blessed us abundantly you know we feel
[46:38] so insufficient sometimes but His grace
[46:41] has placed us it's nothing on our own
[46:43] merits or nothing we've done but only
[46:45] His grace and mercy we bring you good
[46:48] news this morning we we know that some
[46:51] of you have already heard this but to be
[46:53] able to approach you in this way to be
[46:55] able to make the news brother on we told
[46:57] you last weekend brother Ron had his
[46:59] scans on on Monday of the torso area and
[47:03] so it showed the lungs and every other
[47:05] organ and so we have good news there is
[47:08] no cancer in any other organ it's
[47:11] besides the brain and the the lungs and
[47:13] we're just thanking the Lord for those
[47:16] things because he is the one that is
[47:18] doing the work we know that brother on
[47:20] has taken chemo but God works through
[47:22] medicine and there are good signs of
[47:25] that of those things that are
[47:26] dissipating we were just praying that
[47:29] this thing is completely gone we are not
[47:31] just looking for one percent one percent
[47:34] gone but we're looking for 100 percent
[47:37] gone we are asking for his sugar has
[47:40] been every every whichaway this past
[47:43] week and so the doctors are working to
[47:46] do that and so you know they don't have
[47:48] a they don't have a perfect book they're
[47:50] practicing physicians so they're finding
[47:52] out what
[47:53] the Ron's body can handle and whatnot so
[47:55] we just pray that the doctors would be
[47:57] anointed not to just guess and and not
[48:00] that they have but not that they would
[48:02] guess or just make a presumption but
[48:05] maybe they'd be led of the Lord because
[48:07] they're working on God serving our
[48:09] pastor and so we want to continue to
[48:11] lift up brother on also this morning we
[48:14] met failed to make mention we want to be
[48:17] remembering brother Meadows and sister
[48:18] Irene as well and the needs they have in

[49:10] weekend we'll be having Church will be
[49:14] having church with our family and I know
[49:17] it may be a little bit different and the
[49:19] guidelines and things that we've said in
[49:21] order maybe just a little bit different
[49:23] but this is the way that we have to move
[49:25] forward and you might some might ask why
[49:28] we chose not to have service this
[49:30] weekend well it's instead of following a
[49:33] governor all the time I follow the
[49:35] leadership of the Lord and we just felt
[49:36] to do this way felt to be move on the
[49:40] side of precaution and so we we're just
[49:43] looking forward to the things of God and
[49:45] I tell you I'm having a jubilee in my
[49:48] heart just thinking about having you all
[49:49] here I missed you so much
[49:51] and and it's definitely a blessing and
[49:55] an honor to be able to greet you behind
[49:57] this pulpit in this manner but I can't
[49:59] wait to have you here
[50:00] we love each and every one of you with
[50:02] all of our hearts and has brother
[50:04] Matthew to read
[50:05] the letter again this morning I know
[50:06] just hearing and reading it you get it
[50:09] both ways so we just want to make you
[50:12] familiar with the things that we're
[50:13] setting in place and being an official
[50:17] of the state we have to do these things
[50:18] and and so we just want to move forward
[50:21] in the best way we can and we thank you
[50:23] for bearing with us and during these
[50:26] times I know that they are kind of
[50:28] unprecedented times and things are
[50:31] unusual but we'll get through this as a
[50:33] church as a people and so we've set
[50:36] guidelines and we've got different hand
[50:38] sanitizing stations for the singers as
[50:41] they as they come forward we ask that
[50:43] the special singers as we call on you to
[50:45] come forward and sing behind the piano
[50:47] like normal that way we can maintain far
[50:50] as cleaning cleaning purposes and
[50:52] whatnot and so we just will let you know
[50:56] before singing and if you can just hit
[50:58] up that hand sanitizer not that we're
[51:00] afraid of some virus or whatnot but we
[51:03] want to we want to use a we want to use
[51:06] precaution in these things and we want
[51:08] to we want to be smart about things and
[51:10] we know that just because we're people
[51:12] of faith does not make us immune to
[51:14] sickness and so we just want to be on
[51:17] the on the side of precaution also if
[51:21] you can arrive early I know this is some
[51:23] this is difficult on some with different
[51:25] job situations but if you can please
[51:28] arrive early to the Saturday night
[51:30] service we'll start the service at 7:00
[51:32] but if you can arrive early in the early
[51:34] fashions so that the ushers and the
[51:36] deacons can seat you in proper order and
[51:38] adequate time and whatnot so we can have
[51:41] the space to set you out and things and
[51:43] we're not disrupting the service so if
[51:45] you can all arrive early that way these
[51:47] things can be done and just remember to
[51:51] bring your mask and your coverings and
[51:53] and those things and that be your choice
[51:55] whether you want to wear them during the
[51:56] service but we'll set you together as
[51:58] your family and then then we'll set you
[52:00] six feet apart and whatnot we have an
[52:02] adequate space here to be able to handle
[52:04] half of our congregation and one service
[52:06] hopefully we don't have to do this for
[52:08] long maybe maybe a week two weeks we
[52:10] don't know but we just want to move
[52:12] forward as we can and also want to take
[52:15] this time to welcome our community
[52:17] and our families to these church
[52:20] services that have been listening in
[52:22] that have been been a part of these
[52:24] services and maybe you have not attended
[52:26] Full Gospel lighthouse in person but we
[52:28] want to make you feel welcome here and

[52:42] of everybody else but we want to thank
[52:44] you as a family for sharing the link and
[52:47] sharing these messages and and the
[52:50] community we keep hearing of new ones
[52:52] that are listening and you think that
[52:54] Satan's got a grip on things and he's
[52:56] winning but absolutely not God's in
[52:59] control and we know as we started this
[53:02] year that God is with us and we will see
[53:04] miracles and and to think about the
[53:06] barriers that are being broken down and
[53:08] this time this is this has been God and
[53:10] you know they say out of out of a crisis
[53:14] or out of time of despair that greatness
[53:16] is born and so this morning I don't know
[53:19] if it'd be greatness or not be called
[53:21] that but we have a little pandemic choir

[59:51] purposed who shall disown hold it and
[59:55] his hand is stretched out and who shall
[59:57] turn it back Genesis chapter 24
[1:00:01] verse 1 a very very familiar scripture
[1:00:09] to us as believers things that we are
[1:00:12] very very aware of the Bible says here
[1:00:17] and Abraham was old and well stricken
[1:00:21] and AIDS and the Lord had blessed
[1:00:22] Abraham and all things and Abraham said
[1:00:25] unto his eldest servant of his house
[1:00:28] that ruled over all that he had put I
[1:00:31] pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I
[1:00:35] will make thee swear by the Lord the God
[1:00:38] of heaven the god of the earth that thou
[1:00:41] shalt not take a wife under my son of
[1:00:43] the daughters of the Canaanites among
[1:00:46] whom I dwell but thou shalt go unto my
[1:00:50] country and to my kindred and take a
[1:00:52] wife unto my son Isaac and the servant
[1:00:55] said unto Him her adventure the woman
[1:00:58] will not be willing to follow me under
[1:01:00] this land must I needs bring my son
[1:01:03] again under the land from whence thou
[1:01:05] camest and Abraham said unto Him beware
[1:01:09] that thou bring not my son vivir again
[1:01:12] the Lord God of heaven which took me
[1:01:15] from my father's house and from the land
[1:01:18] of my kindred and which spake unto me
[1:01:21] and that swear unto me saying under thy
[1:01:23] seed will I give this land notice he
[1:01:27] shall send His angel before thee and

[1:03:48] your home a man god bless you you can be
[1:03:50] seated this morning in the presence of
[1:03:52] the Lord
[1:03:53] we we realize that what we are seeing
[1:03:57] and what we have seen in our life and
[1:04:00] what we are very familiar with in this
[1:04:02] day is that the things that we are very
[1:04:06] acquainted with that this is a happening
[1:04:08] that there is something that is that is
[1:04:11] transpiring that things that are
[1:04:13] happening that the the almighty god the
[1:04:16] omnipotent God the the God who is the
[1:04:20] god which was and the God that will
[1:04:22] forever be has became tangible a God
[1:04:25] that we can touch it was
[1:04:27] just it was not just for a woman in the
[1:04:30] Bible they had a blood issue that that
[1:04:32] she could reach out or touch and then
[1:04:34] the leper that he could touch but here
[1:04:36] we have manifested before us in this
[1:04:38] hour things of the things that we we we
[1:04:43] never would have been able to understand
[1:04:45] unless we would have had the eagle eye
[1:04:47] of a prophet to be able to to release in
[1:04:50] this hour things that that God had in
[1:04:54] his mind and we see that that in this
[1:04:56] hour that the mighty God the God that
[1:04:58] created the heavens and the earth that
[1:05:00] that spinned the orbit that spin the
[1:05:03] orbits and the things right off of the
[1:05:05] fingertips and he spoke those things
[1:05:07] into existence that this God has became
[1:05:11] flesh and this god has been made known
[1:05:14] to us unveiled to us made clear to us
[1:05:17] and we for once as human beings are able
[1:05:20] to touch God handle God and I brother on
[1:05:25] was speaking some things to me be the
[1:05:27] weekend that he spoke before he spoke he
[1:05:29] he was speaking some things to me on
[1:05:32] this manner about dealing with children
[1:05:34] and whatnot that if you tell a child not
[1:05:37] to do something that that they'll just
[1:05:40] they'll go and touch it and he was
[1:05:41] speaking on a family that dealt with
[1:05:44] instruments that he that they the father
[1:05:46] had set out instruments in their in
[1:05:48] their in each and individual room and he
[1:05:51] told he told his children not to touch
[1:05:54] them and this pertaining and that he
[1:05:57] knew that they would go out and touch
[1:05:59] them know that it is at nighttime and he
[1:06:02] would he'd tell him not to touch him but
[1:06:04] they go in that room at nighttime and
[1:06:05] they would go and they would touch those
[1:06:07] instruments and before long they had
[1:06:09] created themselves saying a family band
[1:06:12] and any and acquire at home and each of
[1:06:14] them were gifted in that manner and you
[1:06:17] know that if somebody tells you not to
[1:06:19] touch wet paint you know what a human
[1:06:21] does they'll reach out and they'll touch
[1:06:23] that wet paint because if you tell
[1:06:25] somebody not to do something yet you'll
[1:06:27] watch that human element in them as
[1:06:30] they'll go out and they they just can't
[1:06:32] handle it they'll touch it and I you
[1:06:34] know it you see it when you see
[1:06:36] yes and he would tell he would tell
[1:06:38] people that he would heal and he would
[1:06:40] minister to them not to touch him he
[1:06:43] knew that they would go out and they
[1:06:45] would tell what had happened in their
[1:06:46] life and you see each and every one of
[1:06:49] us have been touched in this life
[1:06:51] we've touched him we've handled him he's
[1:06:54] minister to us he's he's touched her
[1:06:56] life in so many ways and so many
[1:06:58] different elements and we've watched the
[1:07:00] unveiling of God right before us think
[1:07:05] about in this hour a of people a little
[1:07:07] broad that that that may be cast off by
[1:07:10] the world but she has an access to be
[1:07:13] able to reach out and touch the mighty
[1:07:16] God that is unveiled before her and we
[1:07:20] have seen that this has been God that
[1:07:23] has displayed himself and making himself
[1:07:25] known to us releasing his purpose in
[1:07:29] this hour and upon his children
[1:07:31] releasing the things of God you see we
[1:07:34] didn't know the mind of God man man were
[1:07:37] presuming and they were before the seals
[1:07:40] were released brother Branham would tell
[1:07:41] you that that I was presuming into those
[1:07:44] things I was I was adventuring into
[1:07:47] those things but here with a revelation
[1:07:49] you're not just pursuing or moving
[1:07:52] forward as in the dark but here it is
[1:07:54] plainly laid out before you in the light
[1:07:57] of this hour in this evening light you
[1:08:00] are watching none other than Jesus
[1:08:02] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:08:05] forever as he's dispersing himself in a
[1:08:09] people and we here we spoke to you last
[1:08:11] weekend on those attributes that God had
[1:08:14] in him of attributes of Savior
[1:08:16] attributes of father attributes to be a
[1:08:19] son to be a healer to be a savior and
[1:08:21] what more but today we want to look at
[1:08:24] this load on the attributes of God of
[1:08:26] expressing himself as the husband the
[1:08:31] husband God just like when he created
[1:08:34] Adam that when he created Adam he made
[1:08:37] Adam to have dominion over the whole
[1:08:39] earth
[1:08:40] Adam had dominion over nature and he was
[1:08:44] able to speak to nature he was able to
[1:08:46] to speak to the tree and if the
[1:08:48] was blowing through my ticket he could
[1:08:50] stop wind in its pod he could he can
[1:08:53] move this Center the other and he would
[1:08:55] he would see as the tiger would come
[1:08:57] forth and he would name that tiger he
[1:09:00] would name the DeLeo the line he would
[1:09:01] name the birds of the air according to
[1:09:05] their nature and their characteristic
[1:09:08] that God had put on the inside of them
[1:09:10] but only inside of a hat though he had
[1:09:14] though he had to the natural companions
[1:09:17] of a sheet of the tiger and Leo the lion
[1:09:19] and the birds of the air the eagle would
[1:09:21] come and sit down in the garden but yet
[1:09:24] there was slumping on the inside of Adam
[1:09:27] that he longed for and it was something
[1:09:30] that maybe you as a human you know when
[1:09:33] you first fell in love you couldn't
[1:09:34] explain it but there was something that
[1:09:36] was throwing you to your loved one or to
[1:09:40] your spouse to your mate but there was
[1:09:42] something on the inside of Adam buddy
[1:09:44] that he couldn't quite Express yet it
[1:09:47] was only inside of him but he couldn't
[1:09:49] express it because you see he was a man
[1:09:52] he had dominion but he could not he
[1:09:56] could not converse with the lion yeah
[1:09:58] you know there's a lot of people that
[1:10:01] have dogs and you know I've got I've got
[1:10:03] a couple of dogs there at home but you
[1:10:05] know those dogs are nice to talk to but
[1:10:08] those dogs turn their head and flop
[1:10:09] their ears and look at me and don't have
[1:10:11] a clue what I'm talking about
[1:10:12] and sometimes I look at them the same
[1:10:14] way they act a certain way I have to get
[1:10:16] on and for tearing up Jack or whatnot
[1:10:18] but you see they do not understand like
[1:10:22] I understand they cannot converse to me
[1:10:24] and you can imagine as Adam as he's
[1:10:27] watching the lion as he's watching the
[1:10:29] tiger he's not able to converse but
[1:10:31] there was something on the inside of
[1:10:33] Adam that he longed to deal with an
[1:10:36] intellect that was able to converse back
[1:10:38] to him that was able to speak to him
[1:10:41] something that was on a higher level
[1:10:43] higher than a beast higher than a foul
[1:10:46] higher than the denomination of the
[1:10:48] world
[1:10:49] somebody that could reverse and converse
[1:10:52] with him on the level of human so God
[1:10:56] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[1:10:59] and out of Adam's side God did the first
[1:11:04] surgery and took from Adam a rib and he
[1:11:09] closed asleep and he did the first
[1:11:10] surgery and he called and he brought out
[1:11:13] the woman Adam looked on the woman and
[1:11:18] he called her because she was from man
[1:11:24] so he called her woman for saying that
[1:11:29] she is bowling my pony she is flesh of
[1:11:32] my flesh you see here God was displaying
[1:11:37] himself in the attributes in his created
[1:11:41] son he was showing the manifestation of
[1:11:44] showing himself his husband through his
[1:11:48] son and we look and we see in our
[1:11:51] scripture reading that God was committed
[1:11:54] to the purpose to bring forth a wife
[1:11:57] when you look at Abraham and Abraham
[1:11:59] sending out Eliezer and Abraham having a
[1:12:03] desire that that his son Isaac would
[1:12:05] have a wife and him choosing his his
[1:12:08] eldest servant Eliezer that he sent out
[1:12:11] Elias or to hunt down a bride to go out
[1:12:14] and take her don't take her from the
[1:12:16] land that we're living in in this land
[1:12:18] the foolish things that'll fight you in
[1:12:20] front of your face but go into my
[1:12:23] country go into my kindred and get a
[1:12:26] blood relationship
[1:12:27] go and get a woman that that is that is
[1:12:30] connected to me you're gonna realize as
[1:12:33] it is as this woman is portrayed in
[1:12:37] front of Eliezer that this woman's gotta
[1:12:40] be a woman of character she's gotta be a
[1:12:42] woman of grace she's gotta be a woman
[1:12:44] that carries herself not like a woman
[1:12:47] but as a lady that carries herself with
[1:12:50] character whether somebody's around or
[1:12:53] somebody's not around but you can
[1:12:55] imagine
[1:12:56] this has this responsibility as it
[1:12:59] follows on a leisure soda that I've got
[1:13:02] to get my master a body I've got to get
[1:13:07] him abroad that is suitable to his
[1:13:10] request you see in Eleazar as he sings
[1:13:14] floral upon his shoulder it's these
[1:13:16] things fall upon his shoulder he's told
[1:13:19] that he can't pull just yet
[1:13:21] don't pull right yet you'll catch just a
[1:13:23] little fence you see the responsibility
[1:13:26] that was placed on him it was not just
[1:13:28] about getting those of the first pool in
[1:13:30] the second pool but it was getting those
[1:13:33] that would be a bride for him that was
[1:13:36] not just attracted to the signs and
[1:13:38] attracted to the orders and attracted to
[1:13:40] the gifts but a wife that loves him that
[1:13:45] loves him in good times loves him in bad
[1:13:48] times Oh hallelujah you can imagine this
[1:13:52] as Eleazar is standing in this spot as
[1:13:56] he's there and there's nobody else
[1:13:58] around him sure there's middle of
[1:13:59] Eleazar the Bible tells us that that as
[1:14:03] Eleazar came in that his men came in
[1:14:05] with him and we have watched Eleazar in
[1:14:08] this day and the gospel and the men of
[1:14:10] the gospel death that has spread this
[1:14:12] word that God is asking and he's calling
[1:14:16] for a body but Eleazar here he is forced
[1:14:22] he is forced with a decision to make a
[1:14:26] decision whether to go but Eleazar when
[1:14:30] he had the assurance that the angel of
[1:14:32] the Lord was going before him you see
[1:14:35] then he could be committed to go because
[1:14:38] he knew that there was something that
[1:14:40] would back him up
[1:14:41] Oh hallelujah there's an angel that has
[1:14:45] went before the bride of Jesus Christ in
[1:14:47] Exodus he tells us in Genesis he tells
[1:14:50] us in the New Testament he tells us that
[1:14:53] I would never leave thee that I would
[1:14:55] never forsake thee that I am sending an
[1:14:57] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:14:59] way so walked he in it so when he had
[1:15:04] this assurance he knew that there was
[1:15:06] something because he had something that
[1:15:08] would back him
[1:15:09] the Rebbe said I think that ought to be
[1:15:12] the source of every man of God that
[1:15:14] preaches the gospel that he's got
[1:15:15] something positive from God that'll back
[1:15:18] up what he preaches
[1:15:19] if he ain't if you're havin gotta
[1:15:21] brethren it's for you God still senses
[1:15:25] men with an angel before him when he
[1:15:27] goes to take his message to the church
[1:15:29] hallelujah hallelujah not only that but
[1:15:33] when Eleazar left for father Isaac which
[1:15:36] represented the father of Christ he
[1:15:39] loaded the whole train of camels with
[1:15:41] good gifts for the bride oh I feel
[1:15:44] religious right now oh how I love Jesus
[1:15:46] he loaded the camels full of good gifts
[1:15:49] to give to the bride he never told her
[1:15:52] that they were for another generation or
[1:15:54] another day but they were for the brass
[1:15:57] so many people want to put these things
[1:16:00] off into another day or the day you'll
[1:16:02] bow someday in the future but the Bible
[1:16:05] tells us that now are we the sons of God
[1:16:08] that we have full access as the son of
[1:16:12] gods as an heir to the throne to the
[1:16:14] things of God whoo hello and every true
[1:16:19] servant of God that sent out has got a
[1:16:21] whole book full of divine promises that
[1:16:24] he can offer to the bride and I'm so
[1:16:26] glad of that he's got good he's got good
[1:16:28] he's got gifts in there for her and he
[1:16:31] will not hold any of him back he will
[1:16:34] not hold any of them back I want you to
[1:16:38] catch it he will not hold any of them
[1:16:40] back he will not hold any of them back
[1:16:43] he knows who you are
[1:16:45] if you could realize your position in
[1:16:47] Christ he's not holding anything back
[1:16:50] from you if you need healing if you need
[1:16:53] to liver it's if you need saving he's
[1:16:55] not holding anything back from you he
[1:16:58] will give every one of them freely as
[1:17:00] through serving a model serving a
[1:17:02] serving that God can put trust in he
[1:17:05] won't try to hide it back from her
[1:17:07] because he knows that she is the
[1:17:10] oncoming Queen what kind of minister of
[1:17:12] the gospel Jesus Christ would I be if I
[1:17:15] told you that this book that we love and
[1:17:19] this book that we cherish that we
[1:17:21] over daily what kind of minister would I
[1:17:24] be if I told you that the things of God
[1:17:27] that are in here for a day gone by what
[1:17:30] kind of God are we serving if he's not
[1:17:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:35] he got denominations that make up their
[1:17:37] mind and say that they though those
[1:17:39] things are those things were just for
[1:17:40] the apostles or those things were just
[1:17:42] for for certain ones in the Babur or for
[1:17:45] a select group if they're for a group
[1:17:49] it's gotta be this group it's gotta be
[1:17:53] this wife hallelujah hallelujah his
[1:17:56] promises are laid out before his
[1:17:58] children if you're gonna realize that
[1:18:00] you are the queen of heaven and he's
[1:18:04] laid out everything before you and that
[1:18:06] he's committed to you I hope you catch
[1:18:10] my drift this morning that that Almighty
[1:18:12] God the all-sufficient one the
[1:18:15] all-powerful one that God who sees the
[1:18:18] God that watches you has is committed to
[1:18:22] bringing you to his purpose
[1:18:25] - it's fulfilled end there's a reason
[1:18:30] why Satan know what you listening
[1:18:32] there's a reason why Satan wants to keep
[1:18:34] you so I paralyzed by fear and he wants
[1:18:38] to keep you as it were envelope in your
[1:18:41] own humanity and not release your faith
[1:18:44] to the things of God you know it's a
[1:18:49] dangerous thing when the child figures
[1:18:50] out how to get up in the refrigerator
[1:18:53] and get their milk out for the cereal
[1:18:55] because then they begin to act on their
[1:18:57] own and sometimes you get a mess
[1:19:00] sometimes you get a mess they may they
[1:19:02] may pour a little bit out here or may
[1:19:04] pour a little bit out or maybe spill a
[1:19:06] little bit here but I'd say that there
[1:19:09] are some people of God that have really
[1:19:11] created some messes to Satan they've
[1:19:14] created because you see they think if
[1:19:17] one is good two is better hallelujah
[1:19:21] that if I can preach this and if I can
[1:19:24] see one saved what will it do if I
[1:19:26] preach it to a thousand I preach it to
[1:19:29] the world
[1:19:30] Alleluia they create a mess
[1:19:33] the Satan's Kingdom when they go into
[1:19:36] action for themselves he's committed to
[1:19:41] you church he's not forgotten you in
[1:19:44] this pandemic he's been right there the
[1:19:47] whole time he's not left you and it's
[1:19:50] not planning on leaving you he's
[1:19:54] committed to you his promises are for
[1:19:57] you we've told you this a hundred times
[1:19:59] probably but there's 88 hundred promises
[1:20:01] of God in the Bible and every one of
[1:20:03] them are true there's nine promises from
[1:20:06] the devil in the Bible and every one of
[1:20:08] them every single time he lied he can't
[1:20:10] keep his word but God can he's committed
[1:20:15] hallelujah well the Bible says in Psalms
[1:20:18] 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all
[1:20:22] that is within me bless His Holy Name
[1:20:27] bless the Lord O my soul and forget not
[1:20:30] all his benefits who forgiveth all thine
[1:20:36] iniquities who healeth all of our
[1:20:39] diseases who redeemeth thy life from
[1:20:42] destruction who crowns thee with the
[1:20:45] loving kindness and his tender mercies
[1:20:47] who satisfies thy mouth with good things
[1:20:50] somebody say good things so that thy
[1:20:53] youth is renewed like the Eagles that
[1:20:57] Eagle is able to go up and renew itself
[1:21:01] he's when he gets to the age of 40 years
[1:21:04] old he's able to make a decision in his
[1:21:06] life whether he wants to die but whether
[1:21:09] he wants to fly higher Oh hallelujah
[1:21:12] you satisfied our mouth with good things
[1:21:14] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[1:21:18] Eagles the promises of God renew your
[1:21:21] strength renew your joy renew your
[1:21:24] happiness renew your health renew your
[1:21:27] life a little Eagle fly past yourself
[1:21:31] flyable top of the mountain and renew
[1:21:34] your strength and take your flight of
[1:21:36] rebirth you don't belong you know Malloy
[1:21:40] in traditions
[1:21:42] along in sickness renew thyself Lord
[1:21:49] Lord help us today now we know that
[1:21:54] Wesley in his hour that he had he had
[1:21:59] more light than what Luther did we know
[1:22:02] that Pentecost had had outshine Wesley
[1:22:05] because you see it gradually is let
[1:22:09] loose as it did down through the
[1:22:10] prophets and so forth till it was
[1:22:13] perfectly made known the Godhead bodily
[1:22:16] in Christ and now the Christ in the
[1:22:20] church is just being made known the
[1:22:22] whole thing the whole thing is the
[1:22:26] revelation of God to take Eve back to
[1:22:30] her right position again with her
[1:22:33] husband notice and God is the husband of
[1:22:37] the church and the church is his bride
[1:22:40] the whole thing is the revelation of God
[1:22:43] and bringing you back to your rightful
[1:22:46] position you see Eve turn this down but
[1:22:50] the eve of this last day will not turn
[1:22:52] it down you see it was once the anointed
[1:22:55] man but now it is anointed bride and
[1:22:58] bride through this he the bridegroom as
[1:23:01] he's going out as every young man as he
[1:23:03] begins to look out look out of home the
[1:23:06] ladies of grace as he's looking out he's
[1:23:09] looking for a mate
[1:23:10] he's looking for a lady of character now
[1:23:15] a man now a man that goes out and he
[1:23:18] starts looking for women of the world
[1:23:19] you can notify and notice his character
[1:23:22] immediately but if you watch a man how
[1:23:25] that he handles himself and how he looks
[1:23:28] for a certain wife how he's looking for
[1:23:30] a character maybe maybe a lady then
[1:23:32] maybe a lady let's just put it in human
[1:23:34] points maybe a lady that knows how to
[1:23:36] cook her biscuits and gravy that knows
[1:23:38] how to make a good strawberry pie that
[1:23:41] knows how to do things according
[1:23:43] according to a woman you see he's
[1:23:46] watching for certain elements in her
[1:23:48] life that she displays
[1:23:51] and boys I want to give you a little bit
[1:23:52] of advice here if you don't like her
[1:23:54] mother law you probably won't like her
[1:23:56] because you see there are traits that
[1:23:58] are passed down that are passed down
[1:24:00] from father to son and from mother to
[1:24:03] daughter so you see I hope my mother
[1:24:08] lost listen to this today but there are
[1:24:13] traits that are passed down that matter
[1:24:16] that do you see that his characters are
[1:24:18] later and that man is watching for those
[1:24:21] Saints he's watching for those things
[1:24:23] and he's watching and you see what you
[1:24:27] really didn't know what the man was
[1:24:29] fully about until he chose himself a
[1:24:31] bride and when you see that man choose
[1:24:34] himself a bride you see what was really
[1:24:37] on the inside of him if he chooses a
[1:24:40] lady of the world it shows what's on the
[1:24:42] inside of him but if he chooses a lady
[1:24:45] of the message it shows what's on the
[1:24:49] inside of him you see because he's
[1:24:51] longing for a partner that's connected
[1:24:54] with the headship you see we really
[1:24:57] didn't know what was in God's mind until
[1:25:01] he chose you he didn't choose a woman of
[1:25:04] this grace but he chose a woman of grace
[1:25:07] hallelujah he didn't choose a woman that
[1:25:10] was corrupted by the seed of man or the
[1:25:13] ideologies and the traditions of man but
[1:25:15] he chose a woman that was a virgin that
[1:25:18] was justified as if she never done it in
[1:25:21] the first place yeah there were scars on
[1:25:24] her life but he chose a woman hallelujah
[1:25:27] that portrayed himself you could see his
[1:25:32] desire you could see his grace you can
[1:25:35] see his majesty when he chose a lady of
[1:25:37] grace you could see what was really in
[1:25:40] God's mind notice notice in the Pergamon
[1:25:44] church age the word of promise came to
[1:25:49] the Virgin Mary but that word of promise
[1:25:51] was he himself to be made manifest God
[1:25:54] was made manifest he himself acted
[1:25:58] time and fulfilled his own word of
[1:26:00] promise in the virtue it was an angel
[1:26:04] that had brought her the message by the
[1:26:06] angels message was the Word of God
[1:26:09] Isaiah 9 and 6 he fulfilled at that time
[1:26:14] all that was written of him because she
[1:26:19] accepted his word to her the members of
[1:26:24] the virgin bride will love him and they
[1:26:27] will have his potentials who for he is
[1:26:30] their head and all power belongs to him
[1:26:34] they are subject to him as the members
[1:26:36] of our bodies are subject to our head
[1:26:39] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:26:43] son Jesus never did anything until it
[1:26:45] was first showed him by the father John
[1:26:49] 5 and 19 this harmony is now to exist
[1:26:52] between the groom and his bride he shows
[1:26:55] her his word of life notice he shows her
[1:26:58] his word of life she receives it she
[1:27:03] never doubts it she never lets reason
[1:27:07] and get involved she never lets race he
[1:27:10] never lets her own thinking get involved
[1:27:12] she never lets a man's Ally ology get
[1:27:14] involved she never doubts it she never
[1:27:19] doubts it therefore I love that
[1:27:22] therefore you see these promises are to
[1:27:26] you but therefore nothing can harm her
[1:27:29] because she never doubts it and
[1:27:31] therefore because she never lets
[1:27:34] reasoning it in a way therefore
[1:27:37] hallelujah because Satan can't get
[1:27:39] advantage of her therefore therefore
[1:27:43] nothing can harm her not even death for
[1:27:47] if the seed be planted the water will
[1:27:50] raise it up again here is the secret of
[1:27:53] this the word is in the bride can
[1:27:58] somebody say Amen
[1:27:59] as it wasn't Mary the bride has the mind
[1:28:03] of Christ for and she knows what he
[1:28:06] wants done with the word she performs
[1:28:09] the command of the word
[1:28:10] his name not her name but his name it is
[1:28:15] not hello she it is not hello her it is
[1:28:18] hello him she can perform so command of
[1:28:22] the word in his name what is the name of
[1:28:25] Jesus what is the name of God it's none
[1:28:28] other than Jesus for she has thus hath
[1:28:33] the Lord then the word is quickened by
[1:28:37] the spirit and it comes to pass I know
[1:28:45] that it's hard for some people in their
[1:28:49] natural elements who understand these
[1:28:51] things but to a people that the word has
[1:28:54] been quickened to and you realize that
[1:28:57] those sayings are sovereignly given that
[1:29:00] you said the right word at the right
[1:29:01] time that the word is quickened by the
[1:29:03] spirit and it comes to pass when you say
[1:29:07] that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:29:09] you see it's like a seed that is planted
[1:29:12] in water it comes to full harvest
[1:29:16] serving its purpose those in the bride
[1:29:19] do only his will no one can make them do
[1:29:22] otherwise
[1:29:24] come on some by those in the bride do
[1:29:29] only his will if I lay something out
[1:29:32] before sister Katie and I tell her that
[1:29:34] this is the way that it should be done
[1:29:37] this is a way that you are now hacked
[1:29:39] nobody else is her head but me and is
[1:29:45] not down there that does not make her my
[1:29:47] doormat that I walk over all over top of
[1:29:49] her but I love her as Christ loved the
[1:29:53] church but as I laid out the guideline
[1:29:56] and the things that are set forth
[1:29:58] there's nobody that can talk her out of
[1:30:02] it
[1:30:02] if she's under the headship and
[1:30:05] connected to that head she will do what
[1:30:08] the head says do and you are watching
[1:30:12] her body some people call you peculiar
[1:30:15] some Komba some people call you holy
[1:30:17] rollers some people make fun of you some
[1:30:20] people call you brand of mites
[1:30:22] but that ain't the truth will not
[1:30:24] branagh mites
[1:30:25] we are messiah and there's not one man
[1:30:30] on earth that can make us do otherwise
[1:30:32] than the head because there's a perfect
[1:30:37] union if the connection between the head
[1:30:40] and the bride who lord give me strength
[1:30:45] to get through this today
[1:30:46] she knows that for that for it was not
[1:30:50] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:30:52] that he must now do but he will now
[1:30:57] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:31:00] which he left for this specific time not
[1:31:06] in the eighth day not in a different day
[1:31:09] but in this specific time has he called
[1:31:13] a people by his namesake to do and
[1:31:17] perform the command in his name that's
[1:31:21] why you see ministers of the gospel like
[1:31:23] brother on that has a ministry from God
[1:31:26] you realize that that ministry didn't
[1:31:28] come from some manner passed down
[1:31:31] because of family members of nine
[1:31:33] generations of preachers there's not a
[1:31:35] man that could say the things that a
[1:31:38] ministry like brother honor brother Tim
[1:31:40] brother Donnie whatsoever would say
[1:31:42] things because you realize that they are
[1:31:45] connected to a headship and you watch
[1:31:48] things as those men of God they let the
[1:31:51] promises of God loose and they don't
[1:31:53] even realize what they have said
[1:31:55] sometimes sometimes we as ministers of
[1:31:58] God we have to step back and put her
[1:32:00] hand over her mouth and say did we
[1:32:02] really say that because we realize that
[1:32:05] we are responsible for everything that
[1:32:08] we say but when he says it he's
[1:32:12] responsible for everything that he said
[1:32:15] hallelujah the pillar fire has not left
[1:32:20] us the pillar virus here the pillar fire
[1:32:23] is working he's not he's not just
[1:32:26] somewhere far off in distance he's here
[1:32:31] he's here and performing his word in
[1:32:36] this house in this day I know that they
[1:32:42] are let me just make let me just make
[1:32:45] some of these statements right here I
[1:32:46] know that there are some that listen to
[1:32:48] these things in our community they do
[1:32:50] not understand maybe everything that we
[1:32:52] are displaying to you today but I want
[1:32:56] to assure you that this is a living God
[1:32:58] that is amongst us that if you would see
[1:33:01] the performance of Christ you would
[1:33:04] realize that no man has received these
[1:33:06] things of himself but they came from God
[1:33:09] when we think about the miracles that
[1:33:11] have transpired in our own little local
[1:33:13] body here of some to 100 250 people we
[1:33:16] think about the miracles that have
[1:33:18] transpired and we think about the
[1:33:20] visions that have came forth and then we
[1:33:22] think about the laying on of hands and
[1:33:23] and then the the supernatural gets
[1:33:26] involved and you watch the natural
[1:33:29] become so spiritual eyes and so
[1:33:32] quickened by the supernatural that is
[1:33:35] what we are putting before everyone
[1:33:37] today that this is not a God that is
[1:33:40] dead we're not serving a god like Buddha
[1:33:43] we're not serving a god like Muhammed
[1:33:46] were serving a god that has come off the
[1:33:48] pages in this hour and it's manifesting
[1:33:51] himself that's why we see the dead race
[1:33:54] that's why we see the barren become and
[1:33:56] have life in their womb that's why we
[1:33:59] see cancers falling off with people
[1:34:01] because he's here he's here
[1:34:05] how oh you don't have to wait for him
[1:34:08] like the disciples did on the day of
[1:34:10] Pentecost having to wait 10 days from
[1:34:13] his ascension he's here oh you have to
[1:34:18] do is receive him but we realized that
[1:34:22] there is a capacity in the ability to be
[1:34:25] able to receive just like when Jesus is
[1:34:28] standing there in Matthew chapter 19 and
[1:34:31] 11 he said he makes this comment that
[1:34:34] all men cannot receive this saying save
[1:34:38] they to whom it is given if you look at
[1:34:42] another translation
[1:34:44] it says that all men do not have the
[1:34:46] capacity to be able to receive these
[1:34:49] things there are individuals and there
[1:34:51] are people that do not have the
[1:34:53] understanding and they do not have the
[1:34:56] the revelation of the hour it's because
[1:34:59] they have not been born again but if you
[1:35:02] have truly been born again and sealed to
[1:35:04] the day of your redemption you see the
[1:35:07] things of God I happen to believe with
[1:35:09] everything that is within me that if you
[1:35:11] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:35:14] not talking about some some fleshly
[1:35:16] thing that you feel on you and you felt
[1:35:19] when the preacher was preaching or when
[1:35:20] the preacher laid his hand upon you but
[1:35:22] I'm talking about a good old-fashioned
[1:35:25] Pentecostal revival on the inside of
[1:35:27] your soul where you know that you know
[1:35:29] that you know that you got it
[1:35:32] that if you got the full baptism of the
[1:35:35] Holy Ghost
[1:35:37] you will come to the word of the hour
[1:35:41] because how could you be of God and deny
[1:35:45] a part of his word sure there's a lot of
[1:35:48] Christians today but how many what
[1:35:52] percentage is there I'd say it's maybe
[1:35:53] less than 1% that have a full baptism of
[1:35:59] the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is not
[1:36:01] something that you as an individual that
[1:36:03] you control it is something that
[1:36:06] controls you you see here's your head
[1:36:09] you don't tell your head when you want
[1:36:11] to sin and when you want to get power
[1:36:12] certain things your head keeps you in
[1:36:15] line
[1:36:15] and keeps you from sin and keeps you
[1:36:18] from doing this or keeps you from doing
[1:36:20] that
[1:36:20] it's a Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost
[1:36:24] it's Jesus there are some that do not
[1:36:28] have the capacity to be able to receive
[1:36:30] this baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[1:36:32] they have not fully walked in the way of
[1:36:36] God they've not completely committed
[1:36:39] themselves to God but I want you to know
[1:36:41] this that if you seek God with
[1:36:44] everything that is within you and I want
[1:36:47] to preach to you today that there's a
[1:36:49] Holy Ghost for you that if you have not
[1:36:51] got it you can get it I want to preach
[1:36:54] to you that there's a God of healing for
[1:36:56] you today
[1:36:56] that if you have not got it yet you can
[1:36:58] get it I want to preach to you today
[1:37:00] that there's a God of deliverance that
[1:37:02] if you ain't got it you can get it I
[1:37:04] want to preach to you a God of the
[1:37:06] promises of the Bible that maybe you
[1:37:08] ain't seen them but you can see them I
[1:37:10] want to preach to you today a Living God
[1:37:13] that is committed to his promises that's
[1:37:16] committed to bringing it to pass
[1:37:18] hallelujah he's got every good gift for
[1:37:21] his bride he's laid them out there for
[1:37:24] you well you see God deals with every
[1:37:28] individual in their own capacity you see
[1:37:31] he'll speak to some maybe those may be
[1:37:33] those that are city folk God will deal
[1:37:36] with them individually but he'll deal
[1:37:37] with country people in a different way
[1:37:39] he'll deal with you and maybe maybe
[1:37:42] he'll deal with you by nature or maybe
[1:37:44] he'll do you deal with you by the lights
[1:37:45] of the city or however he may deal with
[1:37:47] you just like he would deal with David
[1:37:50] King David David was a woodsman and
[1:37:53] David had the capacity to be able to
[1:37:57] receive from God and express Christ in
[1:38:00] the manner of a woodsman and he would
[1:38:03] say in Psalms chapter 23 that he leadeth
[1:38:06] me beside the still waters and he lays
[1:38:09] me down and green pastures you see he
[1:38:12] was reading he was he was grasping and
[1:38:15] expressing Christ in the capacity that
[1:38:19] he was able to receive Christ in are you
[1:38:22] with me and in the inspiration that God
[1:38:24] could express himself and dispersed
[1:38:28] himself and he deals with each and every
[1:38:30] one of you did differently ah I I have
[1:38:34] dreams and I have things I don't have
[1:38:36] this I don't have visions but my dad
[1:38:38] does brother a brother out and brother
[1:38:41] Eldin can have a word from the Lord
[1:38:43] I can watch his brother out of would
[1:38:45] will speak things a brother Steve Thomas
[1:38:47] he'll was a man that was so spiritual
[1:38:49] that when you watch brother Steve Thomas
[1:38:52] excuse me for always bringing him up
[1:38:54] he's just a big part of my family he's a
[1:38:57] big part of my past a big part of my my
[1:38:59] future as well and who you watch men of
[1:39:02] God that were led by the Spirit of the
[1:39:03] Lord you watch what a man like brother
[1:39:05] Steve Thomas were brother Leo hen sleep
[1:39:07] when those men of God would come forward
[1:39:08] and they would say they got a word from
[1:39:10] Lord you could watch those things
[1:39:11] transpire because they were so honed to
[1:39:15] the Spirit of God that God could express
[1:39:20] himself through now just because you did
[1:39:22] not have a gift or do not be able to
[1:39:24] speak in tongues or whatever that does
[1:39:26] not mean you do not have the baptism of
[1:39:28] the Holy Ghost because I would rather
[1:39:30] have him than to have his gifts hello
[1:39:35] I know I'm not following a Pentecostal
[1:39:38] that Pentecostal doctrine
[1:39:40] used to tell people that if they didn't
[1:39:41] speak in tongues they didn't have it
[1:39:42] what speaking in tongues is one of the
[1:39:45] least of gifts but to have him you know
[1:39:48] at Christmastime when you get a
[1:39:50] Christmas gift when you get it from
[1:39:52] somebody you know when they send it from
[1:39:55] you from somewhere far off in some
[1:39:56] distance it's better to have the giver
[1:39:59] than to have the gift oh hello
[1:40:05] but you see I want you as I said to you
[1:40:08] last week here that he has not asked you
[1:40:11] to do what you what you do not have the
[1:40:16] capacity to do he did not ask you to do
[1:40:20] what you did not have the capacity to do
[1:40:22] now capacity is it is the meaning of it
[1:40:27] is the power of receiving or container
[1:40:30] it is being able to fully occupy the
[1:40:34] available area or space now the
[1:40:38] government has told us that they want us
[1:40:41] to work at 50% capacity they want us to
[1:40:48] work at 50% capacity but God is not
[1:40:51] asking you to work at 50% capacity he's
[1:40:55] asking you to work at your full
[1:40:57] capabilities there's abilities that he's
[1:40:59] put on the inside of the bra that will
[1:41:02] Express none other than Jesus you may be
[1:41:05] able to just seat half people in full
[1:41:07] gospel I have but only inside of your
[1:41:09] soul such a throne room of your heart
[1:41:11] that has the capacity to be able to
[1:41:14] handle the word of truth the word in
[1:41:16] this hour
[1:41:17] whoa hallelujah and Satan hates you for
[1:41:22] that he despises you for your power he
[1:41:25] despises you for your position because
[1:41:28] even though he was he was a song leader
[1:41:32] in heaven he was a right-hand man to God
[1:41:35] in heaven he could not have that power
[1:41:38] some people say well I'm the weakest
[1:41:40] Christian and all the church if you're
[1:41:42] the weakest Christian you still have
[1:41:45] more power than every devil in hell has
[1:41:49] hallelujah hallelujah you remember when
[1:41:53] Jesus is standing there in Matthew
[1:41:56] chapter 25 and he sets forth the parable
[1:41:58] of the talents then he gave some five
[1:42:01] and he gave some two and he gave some
[1:42:02] one and the Bible said that he gave to
[1:42:05] those according to their own ability and
[1:42:09] you remember that those that were given
[1:42:12] the talents that when the husbandmen
[1:42:14] turn returned back the one that he gave
[1:42:17] five returned and showed him that he
[1:42:19] gained five more and the one that had
[1:42:21] two had gained double-fold but the one
[1:42:24] had buried it because he knew that his
[1:42:27] master was a hard master and that if he
[1:42:31] lost it he would criticize him and say
[1:42:33] he has a prayer paraphrasing here but he
[1:42:36] was a hard master
[1:42:37] you see each of them was given in their
[1:42:40] ability to be able to express Christ
[1:42:43] each of them had their own capacity to
[1:42:47] be able to release to release their
[1:42:49] talents release their abilities and each
[1:42:52] of them were built different but God
[1:42:54] gave to you in your capacity to be able
[1:42:58] to receive man in the book of Matthew
[1:43:03] right after Jesus speaks Jesus speaks of
[1:43:07] these talents right after speaking the
[1:43:11] five wise and the five foolish virgins
[1:43:15] you see each of them had a capacity but
[1:43:19] what made the five wise
[1:43:21] what's the oil on the inside of them
[1:43:24] they all had a capacity to be able to
[1:43:27] receive
[1:43:28] but what made them wise was the Holy
[1:43:31] Ghost it is not it was not in there
[1:43:33] himself they were all virgins they were
[1:43:36] all virgins but it was the oil hill it
[1:43:39] was the Holy Ghost that made them who
[1:43:42] they were that made them wise and this
[1:43:45] Holy Ghost is what makes the body of
[1:43:47] Jesus Christ what makes her wise in this
[1:43:50] hour it gives her the capacity to be
[1:43:55] able to handle the things of God you
[1:43:56] watch somebody even though they're built
[1:43:58] just the same way as you you can watch
[1:44:01] as the Word of God comes forth and you
[1:44:03] could speak it the same way you hear the
[1:44:05] same way but some will receive it in
[1:44:07] summer turn to death just like when
[1:44:09] Jesus said ruin the book of John said in
[1:44:12] John chapter 1 that he came into his own
[1:44:14] and his own received him not but to them
[1:44:17] but to them but as many as received him
[1:44:21] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:44:24] of God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:44:27] dwelt amongst us the same Paul said when
[1:44:32] he comes to Philippians 2 and 5 let this
[1:44:34] mind be in you which was also in the
[1:44:40] headship Christ let this mind be in you
[1:44:44] and with Paul is standing there in first
[1:44:46] Corinthians 2 and 16 I believe it was
[1:44:48] who has known the mind of the Lord that
[1:44:51] he may instruct him but we have the mind
[1:44:55] of Christ you see this body ain't
[1:44:58] thinking ain't mine by thinking by her
[1:45:01] arm thinking by her foot or thinking by
[1:45:03] her finger she's thinking from a
[1:45:05] headship she's moving by head chef you
[1:45:10] see his mind is your capacity to be able
[1:45:14] to receive let this mind that word let
[1:45:17] means allow allow this mind to be in you
[1:45:21] you have the capacity to be able to
[1:45:26] allow this mind to be in you to think
[1:45:29] the thoughts of Christ you see you'll
[1:45:31] notice when when Rebekah
[1:45:34] when Rebecca was returning back to see
[1:45:37] her master and when she saw her man
[1:45:40] her out in the field she asked Eleazar
[1:45:43] who is that
[1:45:44] and she veiled herself showing that she
[1:45:49] was no longer taking on her thinking but
[1:45:52] she was taking on his thinking you
[1:45:55] remember what we spoke to you and I say
[1:45:56] after verse 22 there that that that the
[1:46:00] key of David is on the shoulder that
[1:46:03] just like in the Orient times that the
[1:46:06] bride would place her very Hill over on
[1:46:09] the shoulder of the groom showing that
[1:46:11] he has full control that she is
[1:46:14] committing all of herself to him to him
[1:46:21] not somebody else to him not some man to
[1:46:26] him not some other power but to him she
[1:46:31] has the mind of Christ you notice when
[1:46:38] you watch the body move they're moving
[1:46:42] they're moving according as the head
[1:46:46] says move now I can't take a step to my
[1:46:50] right without my brain telling me to do
[1:46:52] so if I do if my brain my foot goes out
[1:46:56] when my brain goes that way something
[1:46:57] going on here y'all probably need to
[1:47:00] call the ambulance somebody to cut my
[1:47:03] head off there's some times in life when
[1:47:06] I've been in some certain situation I
[1:47:08] felt like my head was going going
[1:47:09] certain ways you're looking at a look at
[1:47:13] a man when he's riding the board
[1:47:14] sometimes he looks like he's going other
[1:47:16] ways and out but when you watch a
[1:47:18] Christian and it looks like their foot
[1:47:20] is going that way or they're always
[1:47:22] leading them that way but you know when
[1:47:24] the head tells a miss you can see that
[1:47:25] there is a loss of connection somewhere
[1:47:28] and you notice that when you watch the
[1:47:32] people of God throughout the Old
[1:47:34] Testament you watch and you look at
[1:47:37] Moses as he as he's standing there or
[1:47:39] Noah as he's standing there and he's
[1:47:41] just a farmer and he's told by a voice
[1:47:45] to go out and build an ark and the
[1:47:47] builders so many cubits long and the
[1:47:49] Builder to this
[1:47:50] turn build it this way and to go in to
[1:47:53] gather out all the animals
[1:47:54] now who's thinking was he thinking with
[1:47:57] that he wasn't thinking of Noah's
[1:47:59] thinking he was thinking of God's
[1:48:01] thinking and when Moses was standing
[1:48:03] there before Pharaoh and his great
[1:48:05] magicians and he stretched forth his rod
[1:48:07] and his Rob became a serpent whose
[1:48:10] thinking was he thinking with who was he
[1:48:14] thinking when Moses is thinking or was
[1:48:16] he thinking with God's thinking when you
[1:48:19] look at Joshua when he was standing
[1:48:21] there in the greatest battle of his life
[1:48:23] when he's looking there to showdown of
[1:48:26] his life to others to see whether God
[1:48:28] was with him or whether he was just with
[1:48:30] Moses when he was standing there and
[1:48:32] Joshua chapter 10 and then look like the
[1:48:35] army of the Assyrians was going to
[1:48:37] destroy them and he said son stand still
[1:48:41] and moon now hang there of the valley of
[1:48:44] agile on whose thinking was Joshua
[1:48:47] thinking with he had to be thinking with
[1:48:52] an intellect that was higher than his
[1:48:54] intellect are you with me when David was
[1:48:57] standing there in front of a bunch of
[1:48:59] coward his relaxed and standing there in
[1:49:01] front of a champion of champions whose
[1:49:04] thinking was he thinking with when he
[1:49:06] grabbed his sling and said today I will
[1:49:09] cut your head off whose thinking was he
[1:49:12] thinking with and when you look at
[1:49:15] cancer and say cancer I want you to know
[1:49:18] you have met your maker in the son of
[1:49:21] man that he is here to display his
[1:49:23] attributes of healer today cancer take

[1:49:37] taking are you thinking with when you
[1:49:40] start speaking what he said as I can
[1:49:44] tell you your mind will think some other
[1:49:46] thoughts your mind will think they got
[1:49:49] and committed you'll think that God has
[1:49:51] gave up you think that God don't care
[1:49:53] that's what the enemy and that's what
[1:49:56] your mind will war with that is where
[1:49:59] the greatest battle is ever father
[1:50:02] is in the mind but when you go to
[1:50:05] thicken his thoughts hallelu you have
[1:50:11] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:50:13] promise of God will bring it to pass but
[1:50:17] what about when you don't just think his
[1:50:19] thoughts but you start speaking his
[1:50:21] thoughts when you start saying what he
[1:50:23] said
[1:50:24] some people get off they get so
[1:50:27] disturbed and think that God will answer
[1:50:29] them God's as good as his word you're
[1:50:33] not back in Samba horse-and-buggy de hey
[1:50:36] you're in the astronaut age you're in
[1:50:39] the age that we are higher than any
[1:50:41] other intellect we are not down in the
[1:50:44] feet
[1:50:44] we are not down in the neck area but
[1:50:47] this is the day where the headship is
[1:50:50] made known to us and there is a people
[1:50:53] that have the capacity to be able to
[1:50:55] express none other than Jesus Christ
[1:50:59] where's his feet at your feet are his
[1:51:04] feet footsteps his possession just like
[1:51:10] the electricity that we enjoy here and
[1:51:12] the technology that you're enjoying on
[1:51:14] that end there was a man by the name of
[1:51:17] Benjamin Franklin that he realized that
[1:51:20] he thought there was a thought passed
[1:51:22] through his mind that he would be able
[1:51:25] to harness this great power that he's
[1:51:26] seen in the skies and when he got ahold
[1:51:29] of it he said I got it but he didn't
[1:51:30] know what he had but it took a man by
[1:51:32] the name of Thomas Edison that was able
[1:51:34] to bring forth the telegram and the
[1:51:36] light bulb and whatsoever they were able
[1:51:38] to tap in and be able to bring forth and
[1:51:41] manifest electricity and the things that
[1:51:44] you have today you see they were working
[1:51:47] in the laws of nature as electricity and
[1:51:50] whatnot
[1:51:51] they were dealing and releasing in the
[1:51:54] capacity that their mind was able to
[1:51:57] capture that
[1:51:57] now if men had the ability to be able to
[1:52:01] capture those things and release those
[1:52:03] things in the natural elements of the
[1:52:06] earth what about a son and daughter of
[1:52:08] God that is full of the power of God how
[1:52:11] much more can they be able to release
[1:52:14] the capacity and neither things of God
[1:52:17] how much more when it's received by a
[1:52:19] heart of faith and let loose from a math
[1:52:21] of faith there's a God that's backing up
[1:52:25] what he said it's like God that ain't
[1:52:27] backing up he's not giving up but he's
[1:52:30] committed to what he said he would do
[1:52:37] but we know that the Prophet would come
[1:52:40] in this day and he would preach on the
[1:52:44] invasion of the United States that he
[1:52:48] would preach that that the demon powers
[1:52:52] have set up their headquarters in
[1:52:55] Hollywood and set forth their fashions
[1:52:58] and their perversions that the demon
[1:53:02] powers have invaded that had invaded the
[1:53:05] churches they've invaded the prayers
[1:53:08] they've invaded the home and some people
[1:53:11] think it's somewhere far off but yet
[1:53:13] they let it right in their own house in
[1:53:15] their own living room what is it it is
[1:53:18] an invasion of a demonic power and what
[1:53:22] you are watching what you're watching is
[1:53:24] an invasion of the mind where you're
[1:53:27] watching em knees are setting in O
[1:53:29] people where they're thinking that it's
[1:53:31] no longer important to go to church I'm
[1:53:34] not talking about through this whole
[1:53:35] Coronas virus couldn't nobody color
[1:53:36] Church but the few chosen but I'm
[1:53:39] talking about people that have allowed
[1:53:41] an amnesia what they were called to be
[1:53:44] as sons and daughters of God they were
[1:53:48] put here to serve his purpose it's an
[1:53:51] invasion of the mind and you'll watch as
[1:53:56] they give their mind and once they start
[1:53:59] chasing after the things of man that God
[1:54:03] turns them over to a reprobate mind when
[1:54:07] they start chasing men start chasing men
[1:54:11] and women start chasing women and on
[1:54:13] every ungodly perversion it's an
[1:54:16] invasion of the mind when you see men
[1:54:19] joining the BSS Society the big
[1:54:22] society and they putting all the women's
[1:54:24] clothes
[1:54:26] and putting on a man's foot no no
[1:54:27] woman's undergarments and the woman's
[1:54:30] putting on the man's garments it's a
[1:54:32] perversion it's an invasion of the mind
[1:54:36] who is making them think those things
[1:54:39] it's not Christ it's an invasion that is
[1:54:44] making them think those things do those
[1:54:48] things you know we've been going through
[1:54:51] a battle as a family and brother on it's
[1:54:54] a church as a as a body
[1:54:56] we've been watching what we have been
[1:54:59] watching is an invasion on brother ons
[1:55:02] brain how that this cancer has invaded
[1:55:07] his brain and it calls these tumors
[1:55:10] those tumors were malignant tumors those
[1:55:13] tumors were a foreign object they were
[1:55:16] not meant to be there God did not for
[1:55:19] Dain him but there was a demonic power
[1:55:21] that transferred and invaded itself
[1:55:25] through the sails through a brew cell
[1:55:27] and invaded the mind and the brain a
[1:55:29] brother on and you watched as we were
[1:55:32] told that those tumors were putting
[1:55:34] swelling on the brain and they had to go
[1:55:37] in and they had to go in and release the
[1:55:39] pressure off of that invasion that had
[1:55:43] transpired in his brain it was causing
[1:55:45] and it calls his eyesight on his left
[1:55:48] side so he lost our peripherals from
[1:55:51] about right here what was it it was
[1:55:54] telling us that there was an invasion on
[1:55:57] the brain of brother a huntsman
[1:55:59] but doctors by the way of science were
[1:56:02] able to go in there with their
[1:56:05] instruments and cut that invasion out
[1:56:08] and pull that invasion out they did
[1:56:11] gamma radiation and they worked on that
[1:56:13] invasion what were they doing they were
[1:56:16] working by the way that they knew to get
[1:56:20] that invasion that thing that had so
[1:56:23] slipped its way in there so secretively
[1:56:26] brother on didn't know about it until
[1:56:29] his vision started to go how much more
[1:56:32] and things in your life you don't really
[1:56:34] know about it until you start watching a
[1:56:36] snowball effect
[1:56:37] and you'll see you'll source it back and
[1:56:40] you'll find that there is an invasion
[1:56:42] somewhere if you watch if your prayer
[1:56:45] life is went downhill you'll watch where
[1:56:48] doubt has start to enter in if you watch
[1:56:51] when a person no longer respects what
[1:56:54] the pastor says well the children no
[1:56:56] longer respects what the pastor says you
[1:56:58] are watching an invasion of the enemy by
[1:57:03] saying certain things and doing certain
[1:57:05] things that is afflicting them so that
[1:57:08] they cannot respect the headship it's an
[1:57:13] invasion it's telling you that something
[1:57:16] is wrong and when you watch when you
[1:57:19] watch the Church of God as she's moving
[1:57:21] forward as he goes forward in these
[1:57:24] things if she's not moving to the beat
[1:57:28] thus saith the Lord you're watching an
[1:57:31] invasion on the mind that there is
[1:57:33] something there that is causing a
[1:57:36] pressure to keep her from the things of
[1:57:39] God but there is a surgery of the
[1:57:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll go on
[1:57:46] the inside of the inside and it'll cut
[1:57:49] that invasion out it'll cut that tumor
[1:57:52] out it'll cut that cancer out it'll cut
[1:57:55] that sin out just like this Corona vas
[1:57:59] is ho Corona fires it's been an invasion
[1:58:02] its invaded all of our homes it's
[1:58:05] invaded us it's made a shut-in its met
[1:58:07] us being locked down it's disrupted our
[1:58:09] worship
[1:58:10] it's just RuPt in our prayer life it's
[1:58:12] disrupted some of our faith but Satan
[1:58:15] cannot stop the bride's mouth you were
[1:58:19] put here for a purpose you are put here
[1:58:21] to bring forth hallelujah Jesus said and
[1:58:25] I say that so somehow word me so say my
[1:58:30] word go forth out of my mouth it shall
[1:58:32] not return unto me void but it shall
[1:58:34] accomplish at once I said it to do this
[1:58:37] is a sign that you cannot stop us you
[1:58:41] cannot stop the purpose of God they say
[1:58:43] can maybe knocking us he may beating us
[1:58:45] he may even be trying to kill at us but
[1:58:48] we will rise again and
[1:58:50] Satan will loose because you cannot
[1:58:52] defeat the purpose of God and what God
[1:58:55] has imagined in his mind what he is
[1:58:57] purpose in his thoughts that will he do
[1:59:00] because his purpose will stand
[1:59:05] hallelujah his purpose was stand you
[1:59:09] know that before they ever had a choice
[1:59:13] God chose Jacob overtop of Esau when
[1:59:17] they were still in their mother's womb
[1:59:19] God still chose Jacob before he saw can
[1:59:25] make a choice before Jacob could make a
[1:59:27] choice he chose them hallelujah he
[1:59:33] didn't choose a perfect people he didn't
[1:59:36] choose the people that were perfect he
[1:59:38] didn't choose the people that were
[1:59:39] righteous he chose the illiterate he
[1:59:42] chose the cast down he chose to reject
[1:59:45] it he chose a Gentile people that were
[1:59:48] pagan worshipers that was over he the
[1:59:51] nation Gentiles that were cut off from
[1:59:53] God that were without mercy without hope
[1:59:56] in the world that were idol worshipers
[1:59:59] that were going on their way to a
[2:00:01] Devil's hail and a sinner's grace but
[2:00:04] the Bible tells us to a sinner's grave
[2:00:06] the Bible tells us that he took a people
[2:00:10] out of the Gentiles for his namesake
[2:00:14] sure there's people out there that are
[2:00:16] better qualified than you that's got a
[2:00:18] better resume than you he saw had a
[2:00:21] better resume than take up debt he saw
[2:00:24] was qualified he saw was subjected to
[2:00:26] his father he saw cared for his father
[2:00:29] he saw was more religious Jacob Moses
[2:00:32] hyster Jacob was a trouble maker Jacob
[2:00:34] was a liar but before Jacob or Esau
[2:00:38] could ever make a choice hallelujah God
[2:00:41] had chose them and you did not choose
[2:00:44] herself Rebecca didn't choose herself
[2:00:47] Eleazar didn't choose herself choose her
[2:00:50] God chose her hallelujah before you ever
[2:00:54] smoked before you ever drink before you
[2:00:57] ever dope before you ever did anything
[2:00:58] God chose you
[2:01:02] Jesus said that I came not to call the
[2:01:06] righteous but I came to call the sinners
[2:01:10] to repentance
[2:01:11] he didn't come he didn't come because he
[2:01:16] told them they that her whole don't need
[2:01:21] a physician but they that are sick and
[2:01:26] with Jesus is standing there and Luke 14
[2:01:28] and he starts speaking to them on the
[2:01:31] wedding feast in the wedding banquet
[2:01:33] about those that had been given an
[2:01:36] invitation and those that had give the
[2:01:38] invitation he had given the invitation
[2:01:40] to come they came up with every ungodly
[2:01:43] excuse to not come to his banquet and he
[2:01:47] went and he told his servants he said go
[2:01:50] out in the highways go out in the head
[2:01:52] with hedges go out there on the streets
[2:01:55] call the prostitutes call the blame call
[2:01:58] the lame call the hog call the body what
[2:02:01] was he doing he was calling his first
[2:02:03] healing campaign to come to his banquet
[2:02:06] he was calling those that had a start up
[2:02:09] past who his banquet he was calling
[2:02:11] those that were hopeless those that were
[2:02:13] helpless you like yourself that was
[2:02:16] blinded by Pentecostal traditions that
[2:02:19] was poor in spiritual things and so
[2:02:21] disfigured as a human being but yet he
[2:02:24] compelled you to come that there's a
[2:02:27] place for you though you may have been
[2:02:30] so scarred up with so many things done
[2:02:32] so many dirty deeds in your life but God
[2:02:35] rich in mercy when you heard him talking
[2:02:39] about Isaac
[2:02:41] Alleluia there was something that told
[2:02:44] you that poacher and wrote you I have to
[2:02:48] tell you that for the first fooling
[2:02:49] catch me the second Poole didn't catch
[2:02:51] me but when he started talking to me on
[2:02:54] the third pole on the opening of the
[2:02:56] word when I seen God manifested before
[2:02:59] me I started seeing myself in the word
[2:03:02] and it's brother William Boyle if I'm
[2:03:04] preaching a little while ago mama that's
[2:03:07] me I see my reflection in the word and I
[2:03:10] say hey
[2:03:11] he's not talking about a day gone by
[2:03:12] he's talking about this day he's talking
[2:03:15] about this hour
[2:03:17] alleluja alleluja another yeah the
[2:03:20] church has received their revival but
[2:03:22] the bride is in her of a hovel the bride
[2:03:25] has the word the bride has thus saith
[2:03:27] the Lord and she is there in a revival
[2:03:34] it's not any good thing that you done on
[2:03:36] your own but he called you by his
[2:03:40] purpose to be the elect lady of God I
[2:03:46] hear a prophet screaming out and saying
[2:03:49] before the foundation of the world he
[2:03:52] put your name on the blams book of life
[2:03:54] and he slipped on your band slipped on
[2:03:57] your finger the wedding band of
[2:03:59] unmerited grace upon your life who did
[2:04:03] only he you look on your life you see
[2:04:07] the scars you see your past you see the
[2:04:09] mistakes you did Oh God
[2:04:11] rich in mercy God rich in mercy a Bible
[2:04:21] says in Ephesians 5 and 25 husbands love
[2:04:26] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[2:04:29] church and gave himself for word that he
[2:04:32] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[2:04:33] washing of the water by the word that he
[2:04:36] might present it to himself a glorious
[2:04:38] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[2:04:41] such thing but that it should be holy
[2:04:43] and without blemish you remember you
[2:04:48] remember when the Prophet was caught up
[2:04:50] in the preview of the bride how that he
[2:04:53] gave the description of that bride as
[2:04:55] she came forth how that she was lovely
[2:04:58] she was a pretty young she was walking
[2:05:01] just the step as she could not a march
[2:05:03] but as a stride of a woman how that they
[2:05:06] walk gracefully and ladylike she was
[2:05:09] walking and going and she and she passed
[2:05:12] from his sight but then he watched the
[2:05:15] church from each age how that she came
[2:05:18] up how she was so vulgar and how she was
[2:05:21] so dirty
[2:05:22] and then he watched the Church of the
[2:05:23] last day the Church of USA how that she
[2:05:26] was led by hitch
[2:05:28] she was so in Mohali trash so filthy
[2:05:31] looking and they were marching to the
[2:05:33] time of twist and rock and roll and
[2:05:35] those women throwing themselves just in
[2:05:38] twist and withholding just paper gray
[2:05:41] hypocrite ho
[2:05:42] creeper critical the gray between white
[2:05:44] and black which is a deceiving color and
[2:05:47] the profit by the random said that had
[2:05:50] begin to give faint life and you begin
[2:05:52] to think oh my oh my is this the best
[2:05:56] that I've done is this what I am
[2:05:58] presenting to Christ on a lady of
[2:06:01] disgrace a lady that is so hypocritical
[2:06:04] that is moving and it's twisting and
[2:06:08] turning oh you can imagine as Ellie is
[2:06:13] her standing the hair that I have got to
[2:06:14] present to my master a wife the
[2:06:17] responsibility is laying on his shoulder
[2:06:20] is this the best that I've done these
[2:06:22] years of ministry in these years of
[2:06:24] searching in these years of hunting is
[2:06:27] this the best that I've done but then
[2:06:29] there was a voice it came the bride will
[2:06:33] come and preview again and here came
[2:06:36] that bride the very same looking bar
[2:06:39] that passed by at the beginning he said
[2:06:42] then my heart began to jump for joy to
[2:06:45] know that there will be a bride that she
[2:06:48] will be made of the same thing clothed
[2:06:50] in the same thing that that's the one
[2:06:53] who was at the beginning she is to be
[2:06:56] cold you see the bride is not standing
[2:06:59] with the Methodist garment horn that is
[2:07:02] spotted up with because they've been
[2:07:03] doing so many works but the bride is
[2:07:06] lining up with the message and then
[2:07:09] let's when they catch that message they
[2:07:12] line up every time and this body of
[2:07:16] Christ she's not a freak body that's got
[2:07:18] six fingers or got some fungus on it
[2:07:21] he's got a perfect body and he's the
[2:07:24] perfect bird the perfect word and the
[2:07:26] church will be sewed and believed in the
[2:07:29] perfect word and the perfect word and
[2:07:31] the
[2:07:32] perfect word will unite together one
[2:07:34] flesh and one body as husband and wife
[2:07:37] just like Rebecca which she realized
[2:07:41] when there was when there was a blood
[2:07:44] connection between the truth they were
[2:07:46] blood cousins there was a connection
[2:07:49] between Isaac and Rebecca and just like
[2:07:53] the broad of his last day she is a blood
[2:07:56] ball bride she's a blood wolf's bride no
[2:07:59] wonder she has led by the Holy Spirit
[2:08:02] there is a connection that the two are
[2:08:05] coming together there is a union that
[2:08:08] has taken place before you could ever
[2:08:11] think of thought before you could ever
[2:08:13] choose cross he chose you but when
[2:08:19] Rebecca came out she didn't come out
[2:08:21] wearing a bikini
[2:08:22] like the Church of the modern day but
[2:08:25] she came out dressed and the bride has
[2:08:29] the material on earth right now to dress
[2:08:32] herself with and there is a five fold
[2:08:35] ministry the dress wear of God that is
[2:08:38] dressing his bride hallelujah
[2:08:44] you see when that light struck a little
[2:08:46] Rebecca she knew something within her
[2:08:48] that brought her to Isaac and she failed
[2:08:52] her face she wanted no more to do with
[2:08:55] her think she wanted to think his
[2:08:58] thoughts
[2:08:58] Isaac was her thinking from then on some
[2:09:02] people can handle that thought but I
[2:09:05] don't want him just lord over my heart I
[2:09:07] want him Lord over my mind I want him
[2:09:09] Lord over all things and the church
[2:09:12] itself when it strikes that power of God
[2:09:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has the
[2:09:17] denominational churches of the Catholic
[2:09:19] Church of wherever it is when that
[2:09:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real
[2:09:24] to the people them that's written ated
[2:09:27] like you people here to return a life
[2:09:30] see and walks in it what is it it's a
[2:09:34] super side it's a super sign to the rest
[2:09:37] of the world that this mystery of his
[2:09:40] will that he chose you according to his
[2:09:43] good pleasure
[2:09:44] which he purposed in himself and you
[2:09:48] have obtained an inheritance because you
[2:09:51] were predestinated according not to your
[2:09:54] purpose but to his purpose you see the
[2:09:57] message is the key that unlocks the
[2:10:00] mysteries of God and without this
[2:10:03] message the loose ends are still loose
[2:10:06] without this message the book is still
[2:10:08] sealed
[2:10:09] are you with me without this message the
[2:10:12] bride is not in her position without
[2:10:14] this message the bride does not know her
[2:10:17] position but we are no longer presuming
[2:10:20] we know where we're at
[2:10:22] are you with me Church there has been
[2:10:25] churches churches Brides Brides but
[2:10:27] there's must common one that not only
[2:10:30] has the mechanics but the dynamics that
[2:10:33] is fully manifesting the power of his
[2:10:37] resurrection he is committed to her sure
[2:10:43] the church turn this down sure the world
[2:10:46] turned this down sure they laughed at
[2:10:49] Christ they laughed at Christ because
[2:10:55] they thought of that day that God cannot
[2:10:57] have a body that God cannot walk but
[2:11:02] they were blinded by their traditions
[2:11:04] and they missed and they could not
[2:11:07] recognize that the Messiah was standing
[2:11:11] in human flesh but we are promised we
[2:11:18] are promised that he would manifest
[2:11:20] himself in this hour in the form of son
[2:11:24] of man as he did in the days of rod so
[2:11:26] shall I do and the revealing of the son
[2:11:28] of man and here you are watching a body
[2:11:31] as she begins to eat this word she don't
[2:11:36] just eat 50% of the capacity of it but
[2:11:39] she eats the whole lamb she becomes what
[2:11:42] the lamb is she gets his thinking she
[2:11:46] turns down her thinking you see not only
[2:11:48] is he committed but she is
[2:11:51] I when it come down to a time of
[2:11:54] decision for Rebecca to make her
[2:11:57] decision whether she would go or not
[2:11:59] you see there was a mother and a brother
[2:12:03] that stood up and said letter tarry here
[2:12:06] but Eleazar said don't hinder my work
[2:12:11] seeing that the age of the Lord has done
[2:12:14] this don't hinder the work of God don't
[2:12:22] hinder the work of the angel seeing he's
[2:12:24] been doing that it's done this church
[2:12:27] Full Gospel lighthouse yeah we've had a
[2:12:30] disruption in our in our local services
[2:12:33] but do not hinder the work of the Lord
[2:12:36] when you come back in here
[2:12:38] don't let the coronavirus feeder hinder
[2:12:40] the work of the angel it's been the
[2:12:43] angel that has been in this it's from

[2:13:17] like Rebecca made her decision she was
[2:13:20] not choosing eleazar and eleazar did
[2:13:24] choose her but God had chose Rebecca
[2:13:27] because of the blood connection and she
[2:13:31] did not choose le ISA oh I love I love
[2:13:38] the portion of le he's I love what the
[2:13:43] messenger of this they did but I am NOT
[2:13:46] in love with the messenger I am not in

[2:14:03] I am in love with him Oh hallelujah I
[2:14:07] appreciate Elise I appreciate him

[2:14:36] a prayer she matched to the message you
[2:14:40] see there's a reason there's a reason
[2:14:43] why we know the rest of the world don't
[2:14:47] understand but there's a reason why we
[2:14:49] know you have matched what he has said
[2:14:52] you have matched what he has prayed you
[2:14:55] have masked what he has said in his word
[2:14:58] Rebekah when they come to her spot when
[2:15:03] the rest of the churches were watching
[2:15:05] her what she would choose and she said
[2:15:11] will full gospel Lighthouse we start

[2:15:21] different but don't you forget to water
[2:15:24] the camels that had brought you to your
[2:15:27] Isaac you see when she came when she
[2:15:32] came when Ellie's was there not only did
[2:15:35] she water and bring forth drink for Lisa

[2:15:41] that was taking her to her Isaac and you

[2:16:05] the hour will pack you in the glory if
[2:16:09] there's ever a time we ought to water
[2:16:11] this word of our prayer with our praise
[2:16:13] it's this time for it is our decision
[2:16:17] that shows that shows who we are don't
[2:16:30] lose your shout don't lose your dance
[2:16:33] you may have to come in here with a face
[2:16:35] mask on you may have to come in here
[2:16:38] with gloves on you may have to come in
[2:16:40] here dressed up like a Klu Klux Klan I
[2:16:42] don't care how you come in here but
[2:16:44] don't you lose your praise because when
[2:16:47] you go to water in this word yeah we're
[2:16:51] going to dismiss you by row by row but
[2:16:53] we will not give up on our worship we
[2:16:55] will sing to you
[2:16:56] we will sing to you we will worship with
[2:16:59] you
[2:16:59] because we are watering the camel the
[2:17:02] word that will take us to our bridegroom
[2:17:04] and when you come in here I don't care
[2:17:06] if your clap sounds a little funny
[2:17:07] because you got gloves off I don't care
[2:17:09] if your voice sounds a little muff
[2:17:11] because you've got a mask on but let it
[2:17:13] loose
[2:17:13] let your voice fly let so praises loose
[2:17:17] let let you water this word with your
[2:17:23] praise you've been given a capacity and
[2:17:29] he's not asking you to do what you did
[2:17:31] not have the capacity to do I hope you I
[2:17:37] hope you understand that thought to me
[2:17:41] the thought is overwhelming you maybe
[2:17:43] learn a bit more advanced than I am but
[2:17:47] to me the thought is overwhelming many
[2:17:51] you don't understand why why I'm
[2:17:53] speaking these things and maybe that's
[2:17:55] for a future date but there has been
[2:17:57] given a capacity to you as the body of
[2:18:00] Jesus Christ to do what only you can do
[2:18:07] not a little wife she can only do there
[2:18:11] in another woman on earth that can do
[2:18:13] what she does
[2:18:14] I love everything about her everything
[2:18:19] that she does because she's my wife
[2:18:25] and to be honest she's my better half
[2:18:28] ain't a whole lot good on this half but
[2:18:31] on that half it's a whole whole lot of
[2:18:34] good you see you see what you are
[2:18:42] expressing as a wife you're expressing
[2:18:46] in him as a husband you see she can only
[2:18:51] do what she does there's nobody else on
[2:18:53] earth that we're not at at the end of
[2:18:59] the day and my mind is scattered and so
[2:19:02] tore up and so discombobulated she has a
[2:19:08] way maybe it's a military way or not
[2:19:11] jerk me back in her line I have heard a
[2:19:16] voice to get back in line little bride
[2:19:18] but also I've been given a wife to help
[2:19:20] me sometimes hey shake yourself I may
[2:19:26] not be able to get cereal but on Fridays
[2:19:27] but praise God some of you get it today
[2:19:34] some of you get it tomorrow
[2:19:36] some of you never get it I'm glad you
[2:19:38] never get it but you see God has given
[2:19:42] us a counterpart to take care of us and
[2:19:46] there's nobody that can operate like
[2:19:49] sister Katie you know there's nobody
[2:19:53] that can make healthy biscuits and gravy
[2:19:55] like her she's trying to keep me in line
[2:19:59] for some reason I don't know why but I'm
[2:20:03] so thankful that I've got a wife who
[2:20:06] takes care of me that looks out for me
[2:20:09] and I say those things just to kind of
[2:20:13] give you a little bit of break from
[2:20:14] myself
[2:20:17] but I think how does our character
[2:20:21] reflect you how does our life show him
[2:20:25] are we so caught up with the coronavirus
[2:20:29] are we so so caught up with the things
[2:20:30] of life so so concerned and so fearful
[2:20:36] that we forget our purpose in life to
[2:20:40] show for film he were put here for a
[2:20:44] purpose let us express that purpose like
[2:20:49] a never before you know as the musicians
[2:20:57] Comus his David servants went out when
[2:21:02] David asked for a fresh drink of water
[2:21:04] from the wells of Bethlehem you see his
[2:21:10] desire was a command and they fought all
[2:21:14] the way I think it was some fifteen
[2:21:18] miles that they had fought through
[2:21:20] Philistines just to get to that certain
[2:21:22] level and from high understanding there
[2:21:25] are three different wells in Bethlehem
[2:21:27] but there was a certain one that David
[2:21:31] was speaking out that he wanted this
[2:21:33] fresh drinking water from you see only
[2:21:37] the elect know how to bring him that
[2:21:41] fresh drink of Pentecostal water let us
[2:21:45] in our desire let us in our worship let
[2:21:47] us in our praise let us manifest and
[2:21:51] bring forth a fresh drink of water I
[2:21:56] pray that our life is not bitter I pray
[2:21:58] that our water that we bring forth is
[2:22:00] not bitter it's not it's not just it's
[2:22:03] got wiggle tails in it but may our
[2:22:04] praise come forward as a sweet-smelling
[2:22:08] Savior unto him may it come forth and
[2:22:14] may his desire be a command to us his
[2:22:18] wife to bring him the things of God may
[2:22:22] we sing a song fill my lord

[2:25:06] Vernon you normally sit on but if you
[2:25:08] are new in the community in you
[2:25:10] receiving these services and you do not
[2:25:13] have a necessarily side that you are
[2:25:16] adjusted to setting on please just come

[2:26:13] requirements in the Bible that makes me
[2:26:15] wear suit but because it's the very best
[2:26:18] that I have I choose to wear the very
[2:26:20] best that I have now you may not feel
[2:26:22] that way or whatnot but that's my
[2:26:24] personal feeling that when it comes to
[2:26:26] God I want to put my best foot forward
[2:26:28] and everything that I do for him I
[2:26:31] wanted to do that way but I do know that
[2:26:34] there was a service where the Prophet
[2:26:36] went and came and he preached in this he
[2:26:38] preached in this bib over off so so you
[2:26:40] come you come how you feel to come but
[2:26:43] just come dressed praise the Lord so we

[2:26:50] to the things of God I have to tell you
[2:26:52] I I can't wait to be able to preach to
[2:26:55] to you and to breach them more than the
[2:26:58] Select 10 here I have enjoyed preaching
[2:27:01] to them and they have been a wonderful
[2:27:02] audience for me to be able to preach to
[2:27:04] and I can't express how much I think of
[2:27:07] them for being a part of these services
[2:27:09] and making these things available to to
[2:27:11] the bride around the world so god bless
[2:27:13] you all so much we thank you for being a
[2:27:16] part of these services these the things
[2:27:18] that you have done the brothers upstairs
[2:27:20] brother Jeremy he does so much for us
[2:27:23] and is willing to come down and spend so
[2:27:25] much time and make these things by him
[2:27:27] and brother Scottie and the girls
[2:27:29] upstairs and just so thankful for what
[2:27:31] they do for us as a body and so when you
[2:27:34] see them right now don't shake their
[2:27:36] hand but just thank them and tell them
[2:27:38] how much you appreciate the work that
[2:27:40] they have done and in bringing forth
[2:27:42] these services and I could preach to you
[2:27:44] but there's no way that I could run the
[2:27:46] things up there it's way past my
[2:27:48] understanding but I'm so thankful
[2:27:50] because that's a part of the ministry as
[2:27:52] well and so just be remembering them
[2:27:54] that this is not just something that I
[2:27:56] pull off but this is a body that pulls
[2:27:58] this off and we work together as a we
[2:28:00] work together as a team we work together
[2:28:02] I believe pretty well and we're just
[2:28:04] thankful for the team that God has
[2:28:06] surrounded us with and so we just want
[2:28:08] to go today praising the Lord and
[2:28:10] serving him for the Mathew if you
[2:28:12] wouldn't mind singing for us this
[2:28:14] afternoon may God richly bless you in
[2:28:16] the fear and admonition of the Lord we
[2:28:18] dismiss you his brother Matthew sings
