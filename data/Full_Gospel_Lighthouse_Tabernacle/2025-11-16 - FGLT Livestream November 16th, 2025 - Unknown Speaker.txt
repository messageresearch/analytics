It means so much when somebody's singing a song and it's got it's got stories behind it and they know what they're singing about. It's just as powerful as a preacher when he knows what he's preaching about. When somebody's singing and they know what they're singing about, I tell you, it's powerful when the Lord Jesus Christ vindicates right through the music, right through the song, right through the preaching of the word. And I believe that we're going to have oursel a good time today in church. I don't know about you, but I come to have church today. Have you come to have church? Amen. Amen.

Brother Titus is smelling like a dough this year and so he's having a really good brother Jim. He hadn't hunted all year and went out yesterday said I'm going out and kill a deer. He sent me a picture about midm morning. I'm going brother Jim. Amen. Want to remember us this week. Many of you have had some incredible fortune with that. It's just Brother Ram said it's one of the ways that God can encourage us. I feel like I need a little encouraging. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll be gone next weekend for hunting and we do that once a year and so uh remember us and as we go and and uh we made friends with the people that we go to to be with in Illinois and so remembers us there. Amen. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Have you come to have church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell your neighbor, I have came to have church. &gt;&gt; Amen. I enjoyed last night, didn't you? &gt;&gt; Wow, that was great. [applause] &gt;&gt; We're so glad to have brother Matt back in the land of the living and uh &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so glad not to see him in that kind of pain and and thank God that God sent a doctor to take care of that. Had compassion on him and even operated him on him on Saturday morning. And so we was just so thankful for that. Same surgeon that took care of brother Thomas and he's an incredible guy. So we thankful for that. If you need to go to a hospital, Augusta is a good place to go to. And so Amen. Amen. Ephesians chapter 6. I was just trying to get the nerves out of the way. That's all I was doing. Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, and against spiritual wickedness in high places. For take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to to withstand in the evil day. And having done all to stand, stand therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace. And above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit. There's something missing in these scriptures. There's nothing to take care of your back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're not going to run away. We're going to stand face to face &gt;&gt; and whip that devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says in in Revelations 3, to him that overcometh. &gt;&gt; And I want to be one of them. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Father, Lord, we just look to you now. And we have great needs in this church. Phenomenal needs. And I ask you that, Father, that you would come on this scene and touch our hearts today and give us strength. Lord, we all need you. We could we could have a prayer meeting for the rest of the evening of the needs that we have here. But God, you're more than able to meet them. For there's nothing impossible to our God. Now we ask you that you would charge our faith, charge our confidence, minister to us by the word of God more than a feeling, more than just just words, but I pray that you would anoint us in a special way. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you. Amen and amen. You may be seated. We ask oursel the question, how big is our God? Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; How big is our God? There is no sin too deep. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is no heart too far. God is able to reach further than we can ever imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a that's just a little words to encourage us that we don't have a prodal son or daughter too far away. &gt;&gt; He's bigger than all you fear. He's greater than all your struggles. &gt;&gt; He's stronger than every one of your enemies. &gt;&gt; Our God is amazing. &gt;&gt; He's not 10 miles million miles away from you. He is nearer than you could ever imagine. &gt;&gt; He loves to hear you call. The scripture says the Lord is near to all who call on him. Now maybe you might be able to you and I might be able to understand maybe two or three conversations going on at the same time. But can you imagine being able to comprehend millions of conf conversations, millions of prayers &gt;&gt; and he hears every one of them. &gt;&gt; So he hears you when you call. &gt;&gt; Now remember this. Sometimes we we we downgrade oursel. We're not creatures of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not creatures of time. Yes, we're born. We're babies. Brother William just showed us some of his young childhood pictures. &gt;&gt; His children look exactly like him. That DNA runs real heavy there. Just a little bit of you, Sister Gabrielle. the dark hair. The dark hair. And he showed us our baby pictures. He said, "Sometimes that feels so long ago and yet it seems like sometimes yesterday." &gt;&gt; Whether we live 10 years, 20 years, 90 years, 110 years. Seen the other day there was a lady that was 106 years old, runs a jewelry store in New York. She works six days a week. Her daughter works with her. Her granddaughter works with her. &gt;&gt; Has a phenomenal jewelry store business. She's still working. People love to go in and be with her. But at 106 years old, she still wants to live a long time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine what eternity is going to be like &gt;&gt; when you can sit down and talk for a thousand years &gt;&gt; and you just kind of talk it all over and really you haven't spent no time &gt;&gt; I don't think we can comprehend what eternity is going to be like &gt;&gt; but brother on life gets a little bit hard it's only just for a little while &gt;&gt; we are not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity Brother Ram said there was never one like him on the earth. There never will be. He was Emmanuel. He was Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. He was which is and shall come the root and the offspring of David, the morning star. In him dwelt deity, &gt;&gt; the fullness of the Godhead body. In him was God. God Jehovah savior, Emanuel, the door to the sheepfold. He that was, which is shall come, the root of the offspring, the but the root and offspring of David, the morning star, the lily of the valley. Oh God, how wonderful. No wonder Isaiah said, "He is my counselor, the prince of peace, the mighty God, the everlasting father." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "For he said, I am he that was," &gt;&gt; which is &gt;&gt; and shall come. &gt;&gt; I am the root and the offspring of David, the morning star. I'm alpha and the omega. &gt;&gt; That's A to Z. &gt;&gt; In the Greek alphabet, I am from A to Z. I am I am all and in all. I am he that was and was dead and is alive forever more. I have the keys of death and of hell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said every nugget you pick up, every nugget that you pick up and start polishing, it'll polish right back to our Lord Jesus. It plainly says here in revelations that Jesus is that which is &gt;&gt; that which was &gt;&gt; that which is to come. &gt;&gt; He is alpha and omega. Are you getting this? &gt;&gt; Which that that he is from A to Z and all of it. He is everything. &gt;&gt; The almighty. &gt;&gt; He is the rose of Sharon. He's the lily of the valley, the bright and the morning star, the righteous branch, the father, the son, and the holy ghost. He is God. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, one [screaming] God. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you read it. It seemed like you was saying it over and over again. That was just in different places. But I want you to understand you are bone of his bone, &gt;&gt; life of his life, &gt;&gt; power of his power, spirit of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Everything that he is, you are [screaming] &gt;&gt; alpha and omega. That which was, that which is, that which is to come. Let's just talk about him just for a few moments. &gt;&gt; How powerful he is. He is the lion of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; The king of all kings, the Lord of all lords, and he's coming again. &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. He is the lion of the tribe of Judah. He is the prince of peace. He is the great physician. He is the way maker. He is a giant killer. &gt;&gt; He is a chain breaker. &gt;&gt; He is our Lord. &gt;&gt; I got great news for you. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He is the Lord of glory. He is the lion of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; And he shouts from the highest heavens. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ is the king of kings. He is the lord of lords. He is the king of all kings. &gt;&gt; He is the prince of all peace. That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes these earthly kings think they have a lot of power. &gt;&gt; Ours right now thinks he's got a lot of power. [snorts] &gt;&gt; There's a new king in Europe thinks he's got some power. &gt;&gt; There's kings all throughout. There's a Putin. &gt;&gt; There's a a new pope that is in the land that comes from the United States. I want you to understand, they don't even control their next breath. &gt;&gt; They don't even control their next breath. &gt;&gt; But our God, &gt;&gt; our God &gt;&gt; that we're a part of, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that thought of us before he said, "Let there be sun, moon, and stars." that thought of us as an attribute of himself. Of himself, &gt;&gt; not an extension, but of himself. &gt;&gt; I was in him before the foundation world. I was in him in a grave. I was in him at a resurrection. &gt;&gt; He is in me standing here this morning. &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory. Hallelujah. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we begin to realize that this is the greatest powerful people on the earth, &gt;&gt; message believers, if you can grab a hold of how powerful that that God that is living on the inside of you, &gt;&gt; we're not here for some temporary reason. We're here for an eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We will rule and reign with him. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. We will walk upon the ashes of the wicked. &gt;&gt; He is the conqueror of death, &gt;&gt; hell, &gt;&gt; and the grave. &gt;&gt; He's not only a conqueror of it, but he has the keys. And the devil that you fight on a daily basis, he don't have the keys to his own house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is this? It's Jesus. As brother Andrew did such an eloquent job, but Jesus is not wanted. &gt;&gt; You know, everybody wants a Jesus of their own imagination. &gt;&gt; They have a figment of their imagination of what Jesus would be to them. &gt;&gt; The Chinese people have a figment. I'm talking about the nominal world. &gt;&gt; The India would have an affigment. America has an affigment of their imagination of what Jesus is. The Catholics have a figment of imagination of what Jesus is. But the world in the days of Jesus did not want him. &gt;&gt; They did not want him. Are you with me now? Jesus, if he would come back like he would do at that day, he would never become the president of the United States of America. &gt;&gt; They would not want him. But I got news for you. He's welcome at my house. He's welcome at this church. He is welcome. He is king. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This Jesus is a line of the tribe of Judah. This Jesus conquers death, hell, and the grave. I'm sorry I'm redundant, but that's all right. &gt;&gt; He This Jesus was a line charging out. This Jesus is all powerful. &gt;&gt; Let me just drive the point. He is living. He is not dead. &gt;&gt; He is not a historical God. We don't have to look back to 2,000 years ago. He's here today. &gt;&gt; That's why I want to give him my best. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is a lion of the tribe of Judah. He's our God and he's our king. I want you to say this to you and let's just say it loud. He's on our side. &gt;&gt; He's on our side. &gt;&gt; He will fight for us &gt;&gt; against every alien and every enemy that comes against us. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Say it with me. He will fight for me. &gt;&gt; He won't run. He won't run in the heat of battle. He won't turn aside and leave you in the cold. He will fight for you. &gt;&gt; When you get in the fire, he'll get in the fire with you. &gt;&gt; When you go through the the deepest ocean, he'll be right there with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Our God has the power to overcome the flames. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He has the power to separate oceans. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have to be honest with you. There's there's times to where that driving down 81 or 95 or these interstates, I get a little weary &gt;&gt; at how long that it takes to build a bridge. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Come on. how long it takes to put another lane &gt;&gt; knowing they should put two more lanes instead of one more lane. &gt;&gt; I get weary how long stay with me how long that it takes &gt;&gt; to do that. That's man. &gt;&gt; When I serve a God &gt;&gt; that when Moses stretched his rod out across the sea, [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't know how long it took, but in just moments, &gt;&gt; there was a phenomenal highway. &gt;&gt; Now, think about this just for a moment. We wasn't just letting out this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But over two million people. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Turn loose &gt;&gt; because there was Egyptian army barreling down on them. &gt;&gt; And two million people crossed across this highway. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how big our God is. &gt;&gt; That kind of makes you feel like you got hurt on your chest if you're a man. If it's the other way, we got some questions. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 10. Not going there. Proverbs 18 and verse 10. The name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Say it with me. The name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it &gt;&gt; and is [screaming] safe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you. Most of us probably have cameras on our houses, alarm systems on our houses, but the safest places you can be is in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Nathan, &gt;&gt; I don't know where you're at, but the safest place you can be in Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you were flipping your Jeep, the safest place that you could be was in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When we've gone through trials, the safest places that you can be is in Jesus. Sister Wanda, the safest place that you can be is in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Jeff, you're sitting in a good spot back there. The safest you can be is in Jesus. &gt;&gt; He'll be with you in some of your hardest storms of life. He's your doctor. He's your lawyer. &gt;&gt; He's your banker. He knows how to take care of you. Luke chapter 10 and verse 19. Behold, I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy. &gt;&gt; I give you go ahead and stomp. &gt;&gt; 14 people stomped. Not 200 and so stomped. I want 200 and some people to stomp your foot. Sound like you're at the Dixie Stampede. The other day we talked on the weekend. We talked about Sister Connie stomping her foot. Let Let me just let me just go back and touch that just for a moment. Sister Conniey's never stomped her foot at me, &gt;&gt; but she stomped them feet at them two boys right over there. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; She's my queen. She's the She's my buddy. Thank God she ain't stomped her foot at me. Notice what Brother Brandham says. This is a voice of a prophet. If God made a promise and God gave a promise and you believe it, &gt;&gt; this is where the important part comes. Sister Mary, God made a promise and you believe it. I don't care what takes place. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Like the devil on every every ounce of ground that he stands. Walk over it. Take it. Take the sword of the word. &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. God's promises is true. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Say nothing with me. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop them. They're God's promises. He give us the promise that that just like it did to the children of Israel. Pentecostal church has come to the kadesia and are we able? Can we do it? Jesus Christ is the same yesterday &gt;&gt; today and forever. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we walk up there and take a hold of God's promise and say, "It's the truth. I claim it. I own it. It's mine. God gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Did you get it? &gt;&gt; God gave it to me." Now I want you to understand when we come to talk about the message, this is your message. &gt;&gt; This is your message. God gave the message to you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are you with me? I grew up in the message and and and for a long time as I was growing up, you know, it was William Brandon's message, &gt;&gt; but there came a time to where it was my message. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God delivered it through a prophet to you. &gt;&gt; Now, we said for a long time, God sent a prophet. God sent a prophet. You need to know more than that. &gt;&gt; Let's just take Revelations 10 just for a little bit. It's important for you to know Revelation 10:7 that God sent a message. &gt;&gt; But there's also important for you to know that God himself in Revelations 10, he came with him. &gt;&gt; The mighty angel himself came to this dispensation. &gt;&gt; Can I just stop here and just preach for just a little bit? &gt;&gt; I tried it out on brother William just a little bit ago and he liked it. You like it? Okay. So when you hear when you hear brother Brandham talk about seals and trumpets and thunder in every age there was a prophet came or a messenger came to that age and delivered the message of the word of the hour Paul &gt;&gt; and it thundered. It was the voice of God thundering to that age. &gt;&gt; When that thunder goes forth it creates a war. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The enemy begins to fight that message. But the people hear the voice of God thundering through that messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 14 books he thundered. And then the people take thus sayeth the Lord &gt;&gt; and they overcome &gt;&gt; and they live through that age. Paul, Ireanius, Martin, Luther. &gt;&gt; Luther was a man that was sitting within the Catholic Church. It's funny how God has his messengers in certain places. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And then God anoints him. &gt;&gt; And he takes a word, one scripture, and that one scripture was the just. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Some of you were Catholic in your background, maybe uh daughters of that Catholic system in the background. But listen, in that day, Luther began to scream to the world, "We don't need to buy buy prayers. &gt;&gt; We don't need to count rosary beads. &gt;&gt; We don't need to kiss a statue." &gt;&gt; We don't need to do all of that Catholic. We don't need to confess to a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't need a bishop to Come on, church. We can have a Bible for ourselves. [cheering] &gt;&gt; We can be able to read God's holy word. [applause] &gt;&gt; I know it's hard for some of you to know, but especially for our young people in Luther's day, nobody had one of these. But Luther was so con committed &gt;&gt; to believing &gt;&gt; stay with me. so committed to believing every [snorts] person, every individual should be able to look on this word, &gt;&gt; God's holy word and read it for themsel and become the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about this. This is not going to be easily done. So men like Wliffe, other men became anointed under that angel messenger. &gt;&gt; Now listen, they just couldn't take the book home and copy it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They couldn't cut and paste. They had to so memorize the chapter till they would go home and write it down. They would say it so much and it had to be exactly right. &gt;&gt; You you know when the curt behind beyond the curtain of time, brother Brandham reminds him of what Paul preached. I preached &gt;&gt; he couldn't deviate from it. Brother said, "I couldn't deviate from it whatsoever because we love the word of God." &gt;&gt; But listen, under that mandate, Martin Luther &gt;&gt; couldn't deviate. The periods had to be in the right place. The commas had to be in the right place. Everything had to be in the right place. &gt;&gt; Not only the hidden agenda of the word of God had to be placed there in such a way like the original writers because remember 40 writers. &gt;&gt; But all under that mighty one. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I know I'm losing some of you here for a moment, but this is an important part. &gt;&gt; Sister Beth, this is important part because you and I can take that word. And let me say this to you. Martin Luther was preaching justification. That's right. &gt;&gt; And justification, they come to believe that we don't have to pay for prayers. &gt;&gt; People died over that fact. Catholicism rose up against it. &gt;&gt; There was a German king that had to protect Martin Luther &gt;&gt; or he'd have died. &gt;&gt; Thousands of people died. &gt;&gt; Are you sure, Brother Ron? Yeah. &gt;&gt; 68 million. &gt;&gt; You just visited the Jews. Six million Jews died. But under the Fox's book of martyrs, let's just preach. Under the Fox's book of mortars, 68 million Christians gave their life. &gt;&gt; That's why we can't give in. &gt;&gt; That's why we can't be lazy layans &gt;&gt; and just lay back. &gt;&gt; You got to fight for this. You got to fight for your your family. You got to fight as being be leaders. Fight as ladies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard Andrew talk about I heard him talk about those games that children play and become attached to. And then not only just children get attached to. Listen. Get attached to this right here. &gt;&gt; Get attached to this right here. Oh, but brother Ron, I'm bored. Spend a little time in this right here. You're going to need it. [cheering] [applause] But even in that day, they really didn't understand what just really meant. But under the seven seals when Christ came down and met brother Brandham and that cloud appeared &gt;&gt; and the book became open. &gt;&gt; Understand? Through the ages the schools could not figure out the codes of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Boy, they tried to figure it out. Spurgeon. Spurgeon in his school would tell his men and the people that he was teaching, don't get into the book of Revelations, it'll take a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll take a prophet to come and open the Revelations. And God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Don't take this for neglect. God sent us a prophet. &gt;&gt; We're not just another people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We had to have a prophet to come and preach the word. &gt;&gt; Why is that so important? To wash [screaming] us, &gt;&gt; to wash us from our denomination ideas. &gt;&gt; To gather us &gt;&gt; from every denomination. &gt;&gt; Okay. Some of you were Baptist. Some of you were Pentecostal. Some of you were apostolic. Some of you were Amish. But God washes us. &gt;&gt; He washes our mind. He washes our traditions. &gt;&gt; Let him go. &gt;&gt; Let him [screaming] go. and take the word of God [applause] and believe it with a passion. [screaming] [snorts] Just You mean I don't have to pay for a prayer? That's right. You mean I don't have to count a rosary be? You mean I don't have to kiss kiss a statue? You mean I don't have to light a candle? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And then under the seals it comes. You're justified. &gt;&gt; Not just just. Stay with me. Not just just listen. What brother Ron? What are you saying about 107 and 101? We have to we have to grab a hold of that cuz 107, brother Brandham, he couldn't preach this on his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the mighty angel takes the book and opens it up. It's not just justified. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And justified is as though you never did it &gt;&gt; in the first place. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Well, why is that important? Cuz you're a citizen of another kingdom. &gt;&gt; And there none of those things &gt;&gt; will ever be remembered again. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; here in this life. Here in this life in our humanity, we do stuff that's silly. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Becca, would you stand? Okay. You're talking to my grandson. Is that all right? I think the world probably knows that by now. I'm not revealing any mystery or hidden secret of Revelations 10:42. Could you stand? I'm not marrying you right now, so you just hang right on. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; At that age, everything is Hollywood is wonderful. But there's going to be days where there's silly stuff. Now, you don't understand that yet, but the oldest couple in this building says, "Yep, that's right." Okay. So, I use your toothbrush. You can't use my toothbrush. &gt;&gt; You wore that suit last week. &gt;&gt; Same time. &gt;&gt; What's it going to [screaming] matter? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When you going to learn to comb your hair? Really? &gt;&gt; Why don't you get you another pair of shoes? Silly, silly stuff. And every one of you just connected with me. &gt;&gt; How I know Jay and Alyssa has stepped into that world. Am I right? Am I right back there? Somebody say, "I'm right back here. You can be seated." Oh, brother. I don't want some, man. I want a man so bad. I can't hardly stand myself. Yeah, baby, you do. When you get that man and you wake up about 3:00 in the morning beside that husk of Varna, you realize this ain't Hollywood, baby. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're a long way from the seals. I want you to understand God sees your silliness. &gt;&gt; He sees your humanity. that you struggle with on a day-to-day basis. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Too much butter on the bread and not enough jelly. Whatever edge you overfried my age. He understands all the silliness of life. &gt;&gt; And then we'll bring that to church. And we have to step from that natural realm into a supernatural realm for a couple of hours and then right back into that. That's why we got to be continuously washed. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandon was going to preach the church ages and the seals at another time. In his earlier days, he did. And he honestly was honest with us before Christ came 63 in the unveiling of his word, he said he was probing probing at it. &gt;&gt; And and for some of you that haven't read a lot of the message, there were times in his early I'm talking about 40s, 50s, the that he had three persons in the Godhead. There's times that you can you can find that &gt;&gt; because he was probing at it &gt;&gt; and he had a lot of ministers around. He was probing at it. He was probing at it. But once the author of the book, the one that wrote it is with him. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You're not just under the influence, are you with me now? Of a personality of a man, but once Christ himself came, &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:1 came, &gt;&gt; the one that wrote the book. Listen, there's nobody that can reveal the book like the one that wrote it. &gt;&gt; Why is this message important to us? Because we're under the influence of the one that wrote it. &gt;&gt; Now, you remember about 15 minutes ago, I said we're bone of his bone and life of his life and power of his power and spirit of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Because he said that, not William Brandham said that. He said that &gt;&gt; through William Brandon. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's why we could stand in power and authority. &gt;&gt; You were talking about justification. And when you realize that justification, you are as though you never did it in the first place. You'll come to a spot in your life where you don't dig up bones no more. Let me give you an idea right here. If you're going to have a happy marriage, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; If you're going to have a happy marriage, you never bring up an old boyfriend. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to have said amen here. &gt;&gt; You never bring up an old girlfriend. &gt;&gt; And if you're going to be married to Christ, you never bring up Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, &gt;&gt; you move on. [cheering] You move on. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, back when I was You're not there no more. &gt;&gt; Back when I were there, we did it that way. You're not there no more. &gt;&gt; You're not with a boyfriend. You're not with a girlfriend. You're with Christ himself, the word. [cheering] He was answering a critic. How do you feel, brother Brandham, when you're standing there and you and you see people coming in different languages and things? Are you afraid? No, sir. No, sir. No, sir. He said so. Never been afraid yet because he told me so. And I believe it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, are you afraid of cancer? No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. I'm not afraid of cancer one little bit. &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Random told us, don't fear it. &gt;&gt; If you fear it, it'll eat you up. &gt;&gt; But brother Random taught us, don't you fear it. &gt;&gt; God's more powerful than cancer. Are you with me now? Stay with me. &gt;&gt; Listen. Cancer brings fear. brings a whole lot of spirits with you, but don't fear. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. If he told me tonight to go to the presidential graveyard and raise up George Washington tomorrow morning, I would invite the whole world &gt;&gt; come and see it done. I'd say bring every critic and stand them around and you're going to see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Set that chair over here where you can sit down and rest a little while. He'll be just in here in just a few moments when I call. I want you to think about that. Brother Brand was so confident. That's why he could stand and see a blind man and turn to the audience and say, which had a tremendous amount of critics. &gt;&gt; Which one of your gods &gt;&gt; can come heal this man? &gt;&gt; Which one of your gods can come heal this man? &gt;&gt; And waited on them to do it. &gt;&gt; Cuz he knew where he's standing. That's why we ought to be the most confident people in the whole world cuz we know where we're standing. [applause] Shake off your your your scared feet. Put your shouting shoes on. Know where you're standing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I wish you could feel half of what I feel right here. Jesus said himself, "If I do not the works of my father, then believe me not." &gt;&gt; If I claim to have the anointing and do not the works of God, cuz I am the anointed by him with him, it's not me that doeth the works. The Father that dwelleth in me doeth the works. If I do not them works, then don't believe me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if I do them, believe me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that was for the Messiah. For Messiah, that's the church. Here it comes. Are you ready? John 14 and 12, Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." &gt;&gt; Messiah. That's right. Messiah, the representation of Messiah on the earth. Well, brother, I've got to I got to call my favorite preacher. No. Why don't you lay hands on them? &gt;&gt; I got I I got to get it. I got it in the presses. Listen to have respect to men. I understand that. I do. &gt;&gt; I do. But listen, I don't wait on my favorite preacher to come lay his hands on me or on my children or on my grandchildren or on you. &gt;&gt; We've been given authority to &gt;&gt; Janetta, when you David get sick, you can lay your hands on him, David, and say, "In the name of Jesus Christ, devil, take your hands off of God's property. &gt;&gt; You can shake the devil's hell. Mark 16, he said, "Go you into all the world and preach the gospel, and these signs shall follow the Messiah." Not that we follow signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people get carried away with miracles and all different kinds of gifts and all kind of listen, they follow the word. &gt;&gt; He that believeth and baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned. And these shine shall follow them that believe. How far? To all the world. &gt;&gt; Who too? To every creature. &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brandham pray. We've heard him preach. Let's listen to him pray. Satan. Who's he praying? All of a sudden, he's talking to the devil. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Did you get this? &gt;&gt; And you got to know where you're standing. &gt;&gt; When you look the enemy right in the eye and call his name, Satan, you are aware that you are whipped. Oh, only Bron Brandon can do that. Oh, no. &gt;&gt; This is your example. &gt;&gt; This is your example. You you're driving the truck down the road. You come to a tight spot. You just start praying. Satan, you're aware that you're whipped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whipped. Jesus whipped him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Jesus took the keys of death, hell, and the grave. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You're aware that you're whipped. You have no legal rights. Jesus Christ, my Lord, stripped you out of every authority that you had. He died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness, and you're nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; But, Brother Ryan, sometimes my mind gets kind of clouded up. He says, when your mind gets clouded, just rest in Jesus. The same God that gave you your first breath is watching over every heartbeat. I like it. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus. When you can't see clear, this is for a in a battle. When you can't see clear, look away to Jesus. Don't look to your feelings. Hey, bring that t-shirt in here. I got a green t-shirt back there. I'm sorry, Matthew. Stretching you out. You've been sitting there too long. Don't look to your weakness. Look to him. &gt;&gt; Let's do it again. When you can't see clear, look away to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your feelings. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your weakness. &gt;&gt; Look to him. He's the word. Sister Kylie brought me a t-shirt last night. Feelings are overrated. Now, I didn't sleep in it last night, but this is a shirt I'm going to sleep in. When I wake up in the booger, man. I'm going to just tell him, "Read this. Feelings are overrated." And if we need to get 200 more, feelings are overrated. [applause] Faith don't look at your symptoms. Faith looks at the promise. When your mind gets weary, remember the promise and speak it. The scripture says then we are &gt;&gt; when we are weak then we are &gt;&gt; tell your neighbor when we are weak. The greatest battle ever fought is in our human mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you place the word of God in there, it pushes out the doubt and clears the battlefield of your mind. &gt;&gt; I'm halfway through, but I'm going to tell you one more story. &gt;&gt; I was raised in this message. I was raised in a preacher's home. My daddy understood the message early about about 61 62 he realized that brother Brown was a prophet Elijah through this age and so began to get tapes as long as soon as they were available and they were real to real. So me and my brother your daddy would stand there and when the real to real they'd flip them over and when they come off you you remember these they come off you flip it over. So we would try to come to a place to where we could quote what brother Brandham was saying as he was saying it. Listen cuz you know our home loved the message and so we would do that. That didn't that didn't cause our home not to have problems. [snorts] &gt;&gt; My daddy was not a wealthy man. He was he was he he was upholster in a factory. Uh he was a farmer and not and you know his farm was not very successful. Just raised a few cattle, raised a few calves. He you know and and so there was meetings that were going on and dad loved to be in meetings. And so we'd go to meetings three we'd go to meetings seven days a week. Three or four weeks at a time we'd go to the meetings and my dad I could hear him praying in the night and he'd be speaking in tongues and and we'd be listening to the message during the day and hey listen we knew what was real. We had no excuses. We knew what was real. We saw cancers fall off. We saw people get out of wheelchairs. We saw people uh be healed with their ears. We we saw people be able to see. We saw a phenomenal amount of things. But in the natural life, my daddy didn't have a lot of money. And so he would pray, "Lord, provide us enough money to give us gas in the car." Listen, there were several nights to where dad would be driving home from church and be a fox laying in the road. He'd get out, get that fox, throw it in the back. When we got home, we'd skin that fox. I would hold one end, your father would hold the other end, and he'd skin that fox, go sell that skin, get enough money for fuel the next night, maybe for a few nights. We were really happy about that until he got skunks. Cuz there's a skunk season. You understand that? You know when them skunks start flirting with girlfriends, they get killed in the road. And &gt;&gt; was it Hollywood? Oh no, baby. It wasn't Hollywood. My daddy took a trip because other ministers thought that every preacher ought to go to Israel. Dad had a pretty decent job. He was making pretty decent money at one time at a place called Row Furniture. dad took the job. He he went to Israel uh his only trip to Israel. And when he came back, that factory fired him from his job for going to Israel. Well, guys that made him promises didn't keep their promises. Guys that said, "We'll take care of you. We'll pay your salary. We'll pay whatever." They didn't keep their promises. Now, what that did to me as a young man, I figured out there's some preachers that are not real. I found out there's some preachers that won't back themselves up. And so when I become a minister, &gt;&gt; I want you to take this clear. I want to be real. &gt;&gt; I want to be real to every one of you. I want to be real. I want these children to have as much respect as the oldest person in this building. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I am going to make mistakes. But I'm going to be honest and tell you the truth. My dad got another job and it was about half half the income. First of all, he wasn't making enough money, but now he's got half the income. My mom went to work and then as as mom, they were sending us to school and they couldn't give us money for food. And so what I did is I began to work in the cafeteria. Now listen, this ain't bad. I worked in the cafeteria so my brother and I could eat eat lunches. Now here's the big deal. And I wash dishes. I know how to put them things in that baby doll and pull that throw the water to it. Put the soap in there. Pull them out. And I do that for about an hour every day. The good thing was there was great big cinnamon buns. Are you with me? God is a provider of everything that you have need of. So I was eating twice the meal. So are you with me now? And I was getting all them honey buns. Woo baby. So don't feel sorry. But one day my dad was working under a very depressed situation. He was thinking about everything that had went wrong. And all of a sudden, he was so gloomy till a point come into his life. He told me, "I felt like going home and taking my life that evening." And he said, "It was so dark and so gloomy. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't provide." And he said, "The spirit of God began to say to him, why don't you just start praising me?" Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And Sister Beth, he just started saying, "Hallelujah. Anyhow, I'm not going to let the devil get me down. No matter what life may bring my way, I'm going to raise my hands and say, "Hallelujah." [cheering and applause] He shouted his way out of trouble. From that moment on, life begin to turn around for him. &gt;&gt; There may be some moments in your life that are things of the the corners will get close and the darkness will come in cuz life's got a lot of tough spots. But it's in those spots you go, "My God is huge." &gt;&gt; Come on, let me preach to you. My God is huge. My God will make a way. Say it with me. My God will make a way where there seems to be no way. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? [snorts] &gt;&gt; This is more than a dream. It's more than an illusion. &gt;&gt; He's your God. &gt;&gt; He's your God. He's your God. In my young life believing this message and going to work at the Arsenal, there was a lot of tests that I had to take. Then I would went to become a chimney sweep and there was tests that I would have to take. Some of those tests was extremely hard. And here's what I prayed. God, if you're wanting me to be in this position, I'm not smart enough to do it. You're going to have to help me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to I can't claim anything on my own. You're going to have to help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; More than a test. There's going to be spots in your life that you're going to have to say, "God, I don't know how we're going to get through it." But you're big enough. &gt;&gt; You're big enough &gt;&gt; to send rainbows over top of my house, Sister Mary. He's big [screaming] enough to remind you, I got this. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I like it when God says, "I got it." &gt;&gt; I got it. I got it. The guy that's preaching this hears a lot of tough stuff every month. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, I'm not preaching this by some illusion somewhere. Another preach where I'm at &gt;&gt; for the internet people all over the place. If I can preach this from where I'm at, what about you where you're at? &gt;&gt; What about you? Where you at? Moms, dad, leaders, moms and dads, let me just say this to you. He's with you. &gt;&gt; He's with you. &gt;&gt; He's with you in your battles. &gt;&gt; I want you to tell your neighbor right now, he's with you. I want to ask you, do you believe it? &gt;&gt; If God makes a promise, there's another part to it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. If God makes a promise, there's another part to it to you. Not your daddy and mama, &gt;&gt; not brother Andrew. Not the guys up here on this pull pit. Do you Do you believe it? There's going to be moments to where you have to show up at an emergency room and you're counting on a doctor to that's supposed to help you. How many doctors told you that they just sent you out and blowed you off? Four doctors the last couple weeks blowed him off. We prayed. We prayed. The only way that Matthew could get any relief is to lay on the floor, take his knees, and have Sister Cassie to push his knees into his chest for him to get a moment of relief. Are you with me now? How big is your God? How big is your God? We prayed, God, send us a doctor that'll care. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God's in doctors. &gt;&gt; God's in nurses. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. God's in people that can help you. And he went to AMC because his chiropractor, our chiropractor, seen him to get an MRI. And then he went to AMC, called the the doctor's nurses. Hey, he didn't get a scheduler. He got the main nurse. You know how many times that you call a doctor and push 14 different buttons before you get a live person? &gt;&gt; He made the call and the main nurse answered the phone not once but twice. &gt;&gt; Come in 20 minutes they were working on him. They kept him when everybody else was saying, you know, give you a muscle relaxer and send you home. Listen, you don't need to blow off sin. You don't need to blow off just a little sickness. You need to ask God, "God, help me. [music] &gt;&gt; God, help me. I need help. I can't do this on my own." and Saturday morning had an operation [music] to get him help. We've all been there. We've all been there. For three years, I went to the hospital. I went to I went to different hospitals. Three years. I got a headache that won't go away. Feels like my heart's pounding. feels like I can't get oxygen for three years. I was blowed off and my doctor says I had cancer [music] the whole time. But one day, God gave me the right doctor without an X-ray, without an MRI, without a CT scan because he [music] was a n missionary doctor. He said, "Ron, you got cancer. But before that, God told me, "If you'll trust me, I'll use you like never before." &gt;&gt; So, I can stand here today [music] and say, "You don't have to fear your situation. You don't have to fear it." Whether it's a job, whether it's sickness, whether it's financial issues, more than all of that, whether [music] it's your relationship with God, you can lay the world down. God will [music] help you. Brother Ron, I don't know how to give my heart to God. Just ask him to come in. Don't ride the fence. Don't ride the fence tomorrow, next week. Say, God, fill my life. Fill my life. I need you. I need you, God. I need you. I need you to help me. I need you to help me. Be real to me. Hallelujah. Father, you see our hands raised [music] before you. many situations throughout this building, no doubt through on the internet. Lord, when we step into that realm of faith, Satan wants to battle, but we take the word of God and we remind of situations that we've been [music] through, that we're going through to build our faith. somewhere. We got to anchor a top post down. We have to take you at your word. We have to remind Satan that he's [music] nothing but a bluff. Don't have to have the keys to his own house. He was whipped at Calvary. By the stripes of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are healed. We are healed. And we believe it. [music] And we believe it. And we believe it. Father, help us today. Strengthen our faith today. May we lift our hands and lift our voices. May we lift our praise to you, Father. [music] Minister to us. Like my father saying, hallelujah. Anyhow, I'm not going to let my troubles [music] get me down. Lord, minister to your people, Father, today in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Won't you just raise your hands and give him thanks right now? Lord, help me to put your word in action. Lord, help me to put your word in action. [music] Help me, Don. Lord, let [music] this not just be a sermon. Let this not be just a little time that we spent together, but Lord, put it in action, Father, and this wicked, idolatrous generation. Help me to be your representative. God, you sent me to be a representative on the earth. I'm not a representative of the United States. Sure, I'm [music] a citizen, but I'm a citizen of another kingdom, and we're ambassadors before God. Help us today in the name of Jesus Christ I pray. Jesus name we pray. Hallelujah. Jesus. Hallelujah. I want us to quote a scripture today. This scripture says, "If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will and it shall be done unto you." Take your neighbor by the hand. Take your wife by the hand. Don't make you feel uncomfortable. I want us to quote this scripture. Now, this is a scripture that FF Bosworth would tell every patient that he prayed for and brother Brandham as well. And I want us to say it together. If you abide in me, &gt;&gt; abide in me &gt;&gt; and my words abide in you. &gt;&gt; You shall ask what you will ask and it shall be done unto you. Let's say it one more time. If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. Can you say, I believe that of all my heart. Give the Lord a good hand right now in Jesus name. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to me. [music] Oh, when I [music and singing] could not come to where he was, [music] he came [singing] to me. That's why [music] he died on [singing] Calary. [music] When I [singing] could not come [music] to where he was, he came [music and singing] to me. He came to me when I [singing] was bound in chains [music] of sin. He came to [music] me when I possess [music and singing] no hope with him. He picked me up [music and singing] and he drew me gently to his side. [music and singing] away [music and singing] today. In his [singing] sweet love, [music] I know God. [singing] He [music] came to me.

[music] That's why he died. on [music and singing] Calvary. [music and singing] When I could not come [singing] to [music] where he was, he came [singing] to me. Christ alone will [singing and music] glory. Though I could pride myself [music] in battles won. For I've been blessed [music] beyond measure and only by [singing] his strength I overcome. [music] Oh, [music] I can stop and count successes like [music] diamonds in my hands. But the [music] suries were not equal to the grace [music] for which [singing] I stand [music] in [singing] Christ alone. I place my trust [singing] and find [music] my glory in the power of the cross [music and singing] in every victory. [singing] Oh, let it [music] be said of me. My source [music] of strength, [singing] my source of hope [music] is Christ [singing] alone. Christ alone [music] will my glory. [singing] Only by his grace I [music] am redeemed.

My soul sold [music and singing] his Christ alone. Well, some have made Jesus a game that [music] they play to others a song that they sing.
