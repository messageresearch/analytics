[50:51] 13 Jesus is saying this 2,000 years ago
[50:55] and and I'm going to repeat it to
[50:57] you ye are the salt of the earth but if
[51:00] the salt has lost its saber wherewith
[51:03] shall it be salted St forth good for
[51:06] nothing but to be cast out and to be
[51:08] trodden under the foot of
[51:10] men ye are the light of the world a city
[51:15] that is set upon a hill and cannot be
[51:19] hid neither do men light a candle and
[51:22] put it under a bushel but on a
[51:24] candlestick and giveth light unto all
[51:27] that are in the house let your light so
[51:31] shine before men that they may see your
[51:34] good works and glorify your father which
[51:37] is in heaven God bless you you may be
[51:40] seated tonight amen so good to see each
[51:43] and every one of
[51:45] you brother bam made some statements
[51:47] about you as a bride of Jesus Christ and
[51:51] you know he was here in our area and um
[51:56] only just a few of us was able to be
[51:58] there I wasn't able to be there but he
[52:00] preached some incredible sermons here in
[52:02] our
[52:03] area sometimes it's like sewing seeds
[52:05] and it takes a while for those seeds to
[52:07] come up oh how he would love to come to
[52:10] this church and preach that series that
[52:12] he preached here and preach it in this
[52:15] day to real
[52:17] Believers and it's more than books and
[52:20] it's more than tapes and it's more than
[52:22] than even it's more than even just
[52:24] theories of doctrines but we're the
[52:27] Bride of Jesus Christ not because we
[52:30] think that it's because he thought that
[52:34] you remember he made some statements
[52:35] about the Bride of Jesus Christ he
[52:37] called them an an invincible Army that's
[52:41] right you're absolutely Invincible the
[52:45] world uh Satan don't have anything that
[52:47] will defeat
[52:49] you he has a lot of things that will
[52:52] bother your flesh and bother your spirit
[52:54] but that genan seed of God that he put
[52:57] on the inside of you it's
[53:01] Eternal it's Eternal and you remember it
[53:05] wasn't you that made the
[53:09] choice are you with me now well well you
[53:12] say well brother Ron I made a choice let
[53:14] me just say this to you your choices was
[53:16] taking you away from
[53:18] God but God before the foundational
[53:21] world put a seed on the inside of you
[53:24] sure he for knew and and sure he elected
[53:28] you but he chose you to be the final
[53:31] voice to the final age that's more than
[53:35] just a
[53:38] statement that's more than just a
[53:40] statement so Satan in his job that when
[53:44] he when he knows that he's got to combat
[53:46] you you know we made a statement last
[53:49] week about brother brandham and the
[53:50] pillar of fire over top of him and it
[53:53] was it was it was actually Vindicated by
[53:56] even the FBI FBI people and written out
[54:00] that it was a supernatural photo but if
[54:03] Satan could give testimony tonight
[54:05] brother Doug he would say that there's a
[54:07] light about every one of
[54:11] you cuz that's how he knows you are who
[54:15] you
[54:17] are are you with me I was at a filling
[54:21] station one day and and I was I was I
[54:24] was pumping gas and it was actually near
[54:26] Rono I was pumping Fuel and into my
[54:29] vehicle and and I saw a real nice couple
[54:32] standing over the side and maybe in
[54:34] their early 70s and they were standing
[54:37] looking my direction and and I just
[54:40] after I got done I moved my vehicle and
[54:43] I I stepped up on the sidewalk and they
[54:45] they were standing there and I I asked
[54:47] them I said you're having a good day and
[54:50] yes we are we want to meet you and so I
[54:53] just stood and talked to him and he had
[54:55] had been in the military most of his
[54:56] life a retired man traveling down from
[54:59] Maryland to come through and and you
[55:02] know and uh as he was as he was going
[55:05] through I said what's the interest with
[55:08] me and he said well we've always heard
[55:11] that there's people have a
[55:13] light and said we see the light on you
[55:19] amen you know you may not see it but
[55:22] somebody sees
[55:23] it and so I went in and we talked for a
[55:27] few minutes I went in and I I went to
[55:30] the washroom and and he went with
[55:33] me well I noticed he he didn't use the
[55:36] washroom that's noticeable you
[55:39] know I came out and I I got a cup of
[55:42] coffee and and uh you know he just stood
[55:46] with me and and then uh I paid for the
[55:49] coffee I offered him one and he said no
[55:51] I I don't care for one and his wife was
[55:54] standing there kind of with him and I I
[55:56] walked out on the porch and he walked
[55:58] out and I said is everything okay he
[56:00] said I want to spend as much time with
[56:02] you as I
[56:08] could you may never see
[56:12] it but people are watching your life now
[56:16] I want to tell you real quickly I'm not
[56:18] saying that to make anything of
[56:21] me but whether you're conscious of it or
[56:24] not conscious of of it as Believers of
[56:26] the word that light's following
[56:30] you sir and we may live in total
[56:33] darkness as it is brother random
[56:35] couldn't see past 1977 we're long way
[56:38] past 1977 how many of you were born
[56:41] after
[56:42] 77 bunch of kids
[56:48] here and so and so you see you were born
[56:51] in
[56:52] darkness literally and God predestinated
[56:56] you that you were born in the darkness
[56:59] but you remember brother random couldn't
[57:01] see past it but if you remember when
[57:04] those when those when that light came
[57:06] down and it went total dark God allowed
[57:09] him a little bit to draw light in that's
[57:12] right it's because of you that he he
[57:16] draw light
[57:17] in because as the scripture says that
[57:20] you're the light of the
[57:23] world now now let me say it will do you
[57:25] no good to try out a flashlight when the
[57:28] sun is
[57:32] shining but if you go out in the middle
[57:34] of the night you'll know how powerful
[57:36] that flashlight
[57:38] is now you could take a candle and light
[57:40] it out in the middle of a day and and
[57:43] you know it won't mean a whole lot
[57:45] standing out in the sunlight but you put
[57:47] it in a very black
[57:50] night so God knew exactly where to put
[57:53] you as beacons of
[57:59] light are you getting where I'm going
[58:01] here with you now let me just say sure
[58:04] we've got challenges this is an age
[58:06] that's unfit to live in that's right
[58:10] it's a horrible immoral age the leaders
[58:13] have completely fell apart our
[58:16] governments has fell apart and our you
[58:19] know even our school systems seem
[58:21] tainted and your jobs every one of you
[58:24] got a complaint on your
[58:27] job even if you work for yourself
[58:29] brother Jim you're working for me now
[58:31] I'm sure you're com
[58:34] work have a complaint with your
[58:37] boss but she's sitting beside of you so
[58:39] don't complain too
[58:41] much you thought I was going to sa
[58:43] myself I ain't throwing myself under no
[58:44] bus
[58:46] tonight but I want you to understand God
[58:49] knew all the challenges that you would
[58:52] have and it's Satan's biggest challenge
[58:55] to get you out of your position to get
[58:58] you to a spot to where you don't
[59:00] recognize who you really
[59:02] are you see in darkness many times
[59:05] people are afraid of the
[59:07] dark I'm sure in different stages of
[59:09] your life you've been scared of the dark
[59:12] and it and it has some incredible
[59:14] challenges to it but let me just say let
[59:16] the light come
[59:17] on brother bam would preach a sermon on
[59:20] on the light he said there's a man here
[59:24] right
[59:25] that can turn on the light I'm thankful
[59:28] that we can come to church and many
[59:31] times we feel so vulnerable and we feel
[59:33] so weak when we walk in and we just say
[59:36] a serm we say a words like this God I
[59:40] need something special from
[59:43] you and all of a sudden a song Will Be
[59:45] Sung or somebody will have a word and
[59:48] this sermon will come right down your
[59:50] alley and maybe even to the point you
[59:52] say who told that but God knows exactly
[59:55] what you're going
[59:57] through and yet we're built here to
[59:59] overcome this age we're not overcoming
[1:00:03] Luther or Wesley or even Aza Street
[1:00:06] we're we're the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:00:09] overcome this age so if you're in
[1:00:16] school God don't have to put 100 people
[1:00:19] around you to be crutches for
[1:00:21] you if you're on your job are you with
[1:00:24] me
[1:00:25] follow with me even in your
[1:00:28] marriage let your home be an overcoming
[1:00:32] home keep God number one in your life I
[1:00:36] want you to always remember God is with
[1:00:38] us and that means more than just
[1:00:41] church right he's with you in your car
[1:00:45] he's with you in your home he's with
[1:00:48] you everywhere you go so don't go
[1:00:51] nowhere that you wouldn't want Jesus to
[1:00:52] go with you I hear brother brandom said
[1:00:55] he got in the car and he has going to
[1:00:57] make a trip down to preach and he said
[1:00:59] the devil got in the car with him he
[1:01:01] said well as long as you're in here I'm
[1:01:03] going to sing to
[1:01:05] you so if you feel that cold clammy hand
[1:01:09] come on inside of trying to get in your
[1:01:11] home just go ahead and start singing to
[1:01:13] him start quoting some scriptures to
[1:01:17] him because remember that flow is coming
[1:01:21] from that seed that you have fed yeah
[1:01:25] are you with me now remember to keep
[1:01:27] yourself fed cuz you'll get weak if you
[1:01:31] don't because malnutrition is more than
[1:01:34] just for your
[1:01:36] flesh you got to eat the spiritual word
[1:01:39] every day that's why devotions are
[1:01:42] important in your home that's why prayer
[1:01:45] is important are you with me that's why
[1:01:47] listen to the tapes in your home is
[1:01:49] important that you hear the word of the
[1:01:52] Lord because it's feeding that
[1:01:56] seed that's
[1:01:58] right are you with me now now remember
[1:02:01] God knows what he deposited so he knows
[1:02:04] what to
[1:02:07] expect I know you don't look at yourself
[1:02:09] this way but God has a
[1:02:13] vision for you to
[1:02:16] overcome amen I want you to go ahead and
[1:02:19] say that God has a vision for me to
[1:02:23] overcome
[1:02:24] amen so when the enemy Whispers In Your
[1:02:27] Ear you can't make it he's a
[1:02:32] liar I want to drive that point just for
[1:02:35] a moment cuz so many times we have pity
[1:02:38] parties and we wrestle and we we get up
[1:02:40] and down and we get depressed a
[1:02:42] Christian should never
[1:02:44] be
[1:02:47] depressed are you with me I know you're
[1:02:49] going to fight the Blues Brother random
[1:02:51] fought the blues but listen don't stay
[1:02:54] there
[1:02:56] amen don't stay there are you with me
[1:03:00] now Psalms chapter 91 is my favorite
[1:03:03] scriptures and I want to read some of
[1:03:05] these things to you he that dwelleth in
[1:03:07] the secret place of the most
[1:03:10] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:03:14] almighty Hallelujah I will say of the
[1:03:17] Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my
[1:03:22] God in him will I
[1:03:26] trust surely he yes shall deliver the
[1:03:29] thee From The Snare of the Fowler and
[1:03:31] from the noise and pestilence he shall
[1:03:33] cover thee with his feathers and under
[1:03:36] his wing shalt thou trust and and his
[1:03:39] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[1:03:42] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[1:03:44] by night nor the arrow that fth by day
[1:03:47] nor the pestilence that walketh in
[1:03:49] darkness nor the destruction that
[1:03:51] wasteth that Noonday A thousand shall
[1:03:54] fall all at thy side and 10,000 at the
[1:03:56] right hand but it shall not come n thee
[1:03:59] Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold
[1:04:01] and see the reward of the wicked because
[1:04:04] thou Hast made the Lord which is my
[1:04:07] refuge even the most high thy
[1:04:13] habitation there shall no evil befall
[1:04:15] thee neither shall any plague come now
[1:04:17] thy dwelling now notice these next words
[1:04:20] for he shall give his angels charge over

[1:04:30] righteous are ordered of the
[1:04:36] Lord to keep thee in all thy
[1:04:39] ways now remember the scripture says in

[1:06:44] now I I listen I I've been around the
[1:06:47] message since I was a little child but
[1:06:49] one day I met the god of the message so
[1:06:53] the message m is more than doctrines you
[1:06:56] say well brother r i don't understand
[1:06:58] everything neither do
[1:07:02] I I don't know all the answers to the
[1:07:06] questions that's
[1:07:12] right Lord did I here we're not supposed
[1:07:15] to know all the answers to the question
[1:07:18] but I know one that
[1:07:22] does
[1:07:24] all of us hate to be around and know it
[1:07:31] all but the know it all is only to
[1:07:34] trying to convince himself that he knows
[1:07:36] it all and if you stay around him long
[1:07:39] enough you'll figure out he don't know
[1:07:41] at
[1:07:45] all can you imagine being there when
[1:07:48] that fish came back to life can you
[1:07:51] imagine being there when that that that
[1:07:54] that ruler is struck exactly 42 Ines
[1:07:57] silver trip drops to the
[1:08:01] bottom or even brother Brand's standing
[1:08:04] there and he's he's got the picture of
[1:08:06] the cloud in his hands and and he's
[1:08:08] asking even other brothers that are very
[1:08:10] close to him you know what does all this
[1:08:12] mean they're giving him answers and the
[1:08:14] angel tells him to turn it right
[1:08:17] Hallelujah and he sees the Lord
[1:08:22] there listen if we we could just turn
[1:08:24] the picture of ourselves right we could
[1:08:27] see God living in our
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:34] lives are you with me now now
[1:08:39] remember remember this that you are
[1:08:42] literally the blood cell of Jesus Christ
[1:08:45] that's
[1:08:47] right you see his seed is actually what
[1:08:50] makes us so
[1:08:51] important that's right
[1:08:55] there was a girl named
[1:08:57] Rahab now let me just say this to you
[1:09:01] she believed the word she was anchored
[1:09:03] in the word she believed the token and
[1:09:06] she was
[1:09:07] spared but the reason that she's written
[1:09:10] in Matthew chapter 1 as the mothers of
[1:09:13] Christ is because the seed that she
[1:09:18] received and it placed her in the
[1:09:21] lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:09:24] so the seed that went inside of her womb
[1:09:27] was the important
[1:09:31] part the seed that lays on the inside of
[1:09:34] you is the important
[1:09:36] part are you with me now what got you
[1:09:40] here that
[1:09:42] seed what keeps you here that
[1:09:48] seed there's moments in your flesh that
[1:09:51] you'll feel like I quit I can't take it
[1:09:59] anymore are you with me how many's ever
[1:10:01] came to that spot in your life your
[1:10:03] flesh I'm talking about your flesh I'm
[1:10:05] not talking about your soul here but
[1:10:07] your flesh said I've had
[1:10:09] enough I I'm going to put both hands
[1:10:13] up but you couldn't quit if you wanted
[1:10:17] to there's no quit on the inside of that
[1:10:21] seed because you're not the one that's
[1:10:24] holding on to start off with it's him
[1:10:27] that's holding on to
[1:10:29] you listen if you can give up and you
[1:10:33] can walk
[1:10:35] away you didn't have the seed to start
[1:10:38] off
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:43] with are you with me brother R taught us
[1:10:46] about that one drop of
[1:10:49] ink and drops it into the
[1:10:51] Clorox you know sometimes he's a
[1:10:54] scientist and he said you can drop a a
[1:10:57] drop of ink into a bucket of
[1:11:00] Clorox and he said and it breaks it down
[1:11:03] even to the point that you can't find
[1:11:06] the ink
[1:11:08] anymore so the enemy will constantly
[1:11:11] take you through the chapters before you
[1:11:14] came to Christ ain't that incredible
[1:11:16] yeah or you'll point you to the mistakes
[1:11:18] that you've you've you but he don't tell
[1:11:21] you when you got back up that's right
[1:11:24] he don't remind you oh yeah but he got
[1:11:26] you back up he only points you to the
[1:11:28] failure or somebody else's
[1:11:31] failure but if the truth of the matter
[1:11:33] be told God cannot even see your sins
[1:11:39] himself go ahead and give the Lord a
[1:11:41] great big
[1:11:50] hand now notice this quote brother BR
[1:11:52] says all powers in Heaven and Earth is
[1:11:55] given into my hand go and I'll go with
[1:11:58] you whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind
[1:12:01] in heaven and whatever you loose on
[1:12:02] Earth I'll loosen
[1:12:05] heaven now listen he don't just leave it
[1:12:07] there if the great holy church only
[1:12:11] realized its power to do these things
[1:12:15] but there's so much doubt and fear and
[1:12:17] trembling Wonder Could it happen as long
[1:12:19] as that exists the church can never
[1:12:22] stand upright when every talk of fear is
[1:12:25] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[1:12:27] completely in control of the church then
[1:12:29] all fears are
[1:12:31] gone and the church has the
[1:12:37] power the church has the power
[1:12:41] we why they have everything that heaven
[1:12:46] owns behind them they're ambassadors of
[1:12:50] the
[1:12:51] throne absolutely an ambassador of
[1:12:55] Christ has the authority everything that
[1:12:58] Christ owns belongs to that
[1:13:04] Ambassador are you with me don't never
[1:13:06] let it to become void to you brother man
[1:13:09] said when you get saved get the Holy
[1:13:11] Ghost God gives you a
[1:13:13] checkbook on that's right all you got to
[1:13:16] do is fill it
[1:13:22] out
[1:13:26] now Satan
[1:13:30] watches he watches this message he
[1:13:34] watches it goes forth because it exposes
[1:13:39] him right and we're not just a
[1:13:42] church we're not just a group of a body
[1:13:45] of Believers coming together for a for a
[1:13:48] reunion every
[1:13:50] weekend but we leave the house of the
[1:13:53] the Lord yes sir and we have strong

[1:14:19] it and he throws everything at you to
[1:14:22] try to keep you from next weekend

[1:28:14] finishes my statement or my
[1:28:20] scriptures and he don't know what he had
[1:28:22] for breakfast this
[1:28:27] morning it proves to you that the seed
[1:28:43] hoes I was in brother I was in went to
[1:28:46] see brother Bill and he was in tough
[1:28:48] shape he was talking a lot of nonsense
[1:28:51] and all all that kind of stuff and you
[1:28:53] know in all of his nonsense that he was
[1:28:55] talking sister Lyon you guys did such a
[1:28:57] good job with him he was just talking
[1:28:59] all kind of nonsense and and uh somehow
[1:29:03] we come across I'm not going to tell you
[1:29:04] how but somehow we come across that I
[1:29:06] have cancer he grabbed my head and
[1:29:10] prayed one of the most beautiful prayers
[1:29:14] that I've ever heard prayed when he said
[1:29:17] amen he went right back to his
[1:29:20] nonsense
[1:29:22] are you with
[1:29:23] me it shows you that the seed
[1:29:29] holds aren't you glad of that when you
[1:29:31] can't hold
[1:29:33] yourself oh I feel like shouting right
[1:29:35] now when you can't hold yourself that
[1:29:38] seed that's on the inside of
[1:29:50] you
[1:29:59] Romans chapter 8 and verse
[1:30:07] 28 told
[1:30:12] you and we know all
[1:30:15] things let's all read it together I got
[1:30:18] one guy's going to read it with me and
[1:30:20] we know all things work gather for
[1:30:33] them sorry I'm having an emotional
[1:30:36] moment right
[1:30:38] there one night when I was
[1:30:42] preaching brother metas preached a
[1:30:45] sermon from his
[1:30:47] Pew because I miss the
[1:30:50] the
[1:30:52] who are the
[1:30:58] called because that's incredibly
[1:31:02] important cuz you didn't call
[1:31:05] yourself and there's a lot of people
[1:31:07] that can use that scripture and hold it
[1:31:10] that will never know anything about the
[1:31:12] message but you are the
[1:31:18] called according to his
[1:31:23] his that's a really big statement right
[1:31:27] there
[1:31:30] his not mine or my wife or my
[1:31:37] neighbors it's not my ambition that's
[1:31:39] important it's
[1:31:44] his brother Brandon wanted to be a
[1:31:46] Trapper in the end of his life that
[1:31:48] wasn't what God God actually told him
[1:31:50] I'll leave you right I don't have to
[1:31:53] tell you a half an hour story God
[1:31:55] actually told Brother Brian I'm a
[1:31:56] prophet of the Lord you carry out your
[1:32:00] plans aren't you glad that God has a
[1:32:03] stop switch and says all
[1:32:06] right all
[1:32:08] right brother B one time said God you
[1:32:11] owe me apology because somebody died he
[1:32:14] said you owe me apology he said God left
[1:32:16] me like an orphan child for 6 months
[1:32:20] that's right that's right hard to fine
[1:32:22] but it's
[1:32:23] there he continued preaching he
[1:32:25] continued laying hands on the sick
[1:32:27] continued seeing a lot of things and he
[1:32:30] God literally listen you know when you
[1:32:38] know how can I best describe that it's
[1:32:42] kind of like you come into service and
[1:32:44] you just kind of take it for granted
[1:32:46] that the anointing and that warm
[1:32:47] presence is always there and then it
[1:32:49] leaves for six months
[1:32:54] well maybe that didn't get it it's kind
[1:32:56] of like be kind of like being married

[1:34:41] spared her life then to get her ready
[1:34:45] [Music]
[1:34:47] Amen brother Lloyd walls is our our
[1:34:50] buddy he was redoing his church and had
[1:34:53] a lot of work to do and there was a guy
[1:34:55] came into his
[1:34:56] church didn't know his background didn't
[1:34:59] know what was going on brother Jim you
[1:35:00] might have know this guy came into the
[1:35:01] church he big sort of fellow did a lot
[1:35:04] of work there did a lot of work became
[1:35:07] his buddy right there with him every day
[1:35:10] and after the work was done the Lord
[1:35:12] took him
[1:35:15] home God will send people in your life
[1:35:18] for a
[1:35:20] season
[1:35:22] for a season he will put people in your
[1:35:25] life to let you know you're not
[1:35:32] alone for whom he did for know he also
[1:35:35] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:35:36] image of his son that he might be the
[1:35:39] firstborn
[1:35:41] of among many Brethren moreover whom he
[1:35:45] did predestinate then he also
[1:35:49] called and whom he called then he also
[1:35:52] Justified what does justification mean
[1:35:55] as though you never did it in the first
[1:36:01] place do do you believe that I'm I'm All
[1:36:04] honest I'm just down home preaching to
[1:36:06] you as an audience now do you believe
[1:36:08] what I just read to
[1:36:10] you then quit beating yourself
[1:36:17] up we're not Catholics here we don't do
[1:36:20] penants
[1:36:22] when God forgives you of something it's
[1:36:24] like he pays the credit card
[1:36:27] off it's done it's over with don't give
[1:36:31] your right to go put 25,000 more on
[1:36:37] it whom he justified them he also
[1:36:43] glorified now let me just say this you
[1:36:46] this is a past tense scripture this is
[1:36:49] the way God sees it
[1:36:52] this was written before you ever got
[1:36:54] here brother
[1:36:58] Ray so he predestinated you and now
[1:37:01] you're here that's right you're the
[1:37:03] image of what he took a picture of you
[1:37:05] before the foundation of the world he
[1:37:08] called you he got you
[1:37:11] here
[1:37:14] amen and he justified
[1:37:17] you no doubt every devil in hell wants
[1:37:19] to point out different things in your
[1:37:21] life but God don't see none of
[1:37:23] it and whom he justified then he also
[1:37:29] glorified so he's judged
[1:37:33] you and said well
[1:37:40] done now listen this night ought to
[1:37:42] prove to
[1:37:45] you it's not
[1:37:47] you it's not you that's holding on
[1:37:54] he's already seen it
[1:37:59] finished brother Ron this is so simple
[1:38:02] really really really is it is it what
[1:38:07] shall we then say to these
[1:38:09] things I love this part this is my
[1:38:12] favorite part if God be for
[1:38:17] us who can be against us
[1:38:24] so I want to say this to you and you I
[1:38:26] want you to say it with me never never
[1:38:29] never never give
[1:38:39] up never forget who you
[1:38:42] are brother Brown talks about
[1:38:46] Amnesia and I'll finish with this we'll
[1:38:48] start over in the
[1:38:50] morning
[1:38:52] brother Frasier's favorite sermon was
[1:38:55] spiritual
[1:38:58] Amnesia brother bran preached it to the
[1:39:00] Pentecostal church that's where he
[1:39:02] preached it to because they forgot who
[1:39:05] they were as long as they was in those
[1:39:08] old
[1:39:09] dimly dimly lit buildings and the fire
[1:39:13] of God was with them that was a real
[1:39:14] move of God that was with them but
[1:39:17] here's what Satan does to you before
[1:39:20] long
[1:39:22] the rich started coming
[1:39:25] in I got quotes for it the rich started
[1:39:28] coming in and they didn't want to take
[1:39:30] them to those dimly lit buildings so
[1:39:32] they they built
[1:39:35] Cathedrals and then they they didn't
[1:39:37] want that old guy spitting and Hawking
[1:39:41] and and they didn't want all that
[1:39:43] emotion so they they got educated
[1:39:47] preachers and and before long the spirit
[1:39:50] of God wasn't there no more and kabot
[1:39:52] was written over the
[1:39:54] door they forgot who they were the name
[1:39:58] change was the same but now they were
[1:40:01] worse than the Catholic church that's
[1:40:05] right dear God don't let that happen to
[1:40:08] us I like nice things but don't let that
[1:40:11] happen to us I don't care if you live in
[1:40:14] a ten or you live in a castle I want the
[1:40:16] spirit of
[1:40:19] God
[1:40:21] [Applause]
[1:40:34] brother BR begins to talk about the
[1:40:35] shock of
[1:40:37] War even in Israel some of those those
[1:40:41] hostages now are going to have to be re
[1:40:44] rehabilitated the children the stories
[1:40:47] that are coming out day by day it's
[1:40:49] heartbreaking what they did to those
[1:40:53] children how they tortured them did
[1:40:56] things to them listen the devil do a lot
[1:40:58] of things to you if he could get his
[1:40:59] hands on
[1:41:00] you and they're getting them they're
[1:41:02] getting some of them out and they went
[1:41:04] back to fighting today but they're
[1:41:06] getting some of them out but those that
[1:41:09] they got out now has to battle in their
[1:41:11] minds of what
[1:41:13] happened war is horrible it's I hate War
[1:41:18] amen I hate the battle that you have to
[1:41:20] fight I hear your battles and I think oh
[1:41:23] dear God but listen God gave you the
[1:41:25] strength to get through
[1:41:27] it everyone sitting in this building's
[1:41:30] got a different
[1:41:33] battle every one of you's got a
[1:41:35] different battle but God's got plans for
[1:41:37] every one of you to
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:49] overcome
[1:41:52] brother man says these Soldier Boys had
[1:41:54] had got amnesia because of the
[1:41:57] war they forgot who they was and who
[1:42:00] their family was and where they came
[1:42:02] from so what they would do is put them
[1:42:05] on a train and they would take them away
[1:42:07] to an asylum to take care of them for
[1:42:10] the rest of their
[1:42:12] life it was old trains and brother Ram's
[1:42:15] telling this from history it was old
[1:42:17] trains and and they would need water to
[1:42:20] to keep the train going you would know
[1:42:22] the story probably better than I would
[1:42:24] but they would they would get to a
[1:42:25] certain spot they needed more water and
[1:42:27] so it was at those spots they would uh
[1:42:30] the train would stop and they would get
[1:42:32] off
[1:42:34] and I actually held your statue in my
[1:42:37] hand today I thought as I was thinking
[1:42:39] about this
[1:42:41] story and they got off and they'd let
[1:42:43] him walk around a little bit they didn't
[1:42:46] know who they
[1:42:47] were soldiers guards were standing there
[1:42:50] to to protect
[1:42:52] them kind of like you sometimes there's
[1:42:54] an angel standing watching over you and
[1:42:58] you forgot who you are kind of lost your
[1:43:01] way the battles of life has got tough
[1:43:05] Hey listen Cancer's a real
[1:43:07] deal trouble is a real deal there's
[1:43:11] times that you kind of lose your way and
[1:43:13] this one guy started
[1:43:16] walking so instead of stopping him the
[1:43:19] angel or the guard just let him keep
[1:43:26] walking and he walked and he walked up
[1:43:29] on the hill and he looked at a water
[1:43:33] tower and that water tower had got
[1:43:36] familiar to him amen something about
[1:43:40] it so he just kept walking on his path
[1:43:44] just kept walking important thing is you
[1:43:46] just keep walking am
[1:43:49] amen
[1:43:51] and walking requires strength to get one
[1:43:54] step in front of another there's going
[1:43:57] to be times in your life and I know this
[1:43:59] for a fact there's going to be times in
[1:44:00] your life where you have to tell your
[1:44:02] foot to keep
[1:44:05] moving cuz the moment you sat down
[1:44:07] you're
[1:44:11] done and the angel the guard was walking
[1:44:15] behind him and he walked up over a hill
[1:44:18] kept following the path and he walked up
[1:44:20] over another here and you hear Brother
[1:44:21] Bram how he says it walks up over
[1:44:23] another pill and said he comes up over
[1:44:26] and there's a cabin down sitting in the
[1:44:28] valley and said there's some smoke
[1:44:30] coming up from it as it's coming up
[1:44:33] there's a little picked fence that's
[1:44:35] around it and he sees an old man
[1:44:37] standing on the
[1:44:40] porch
[1:44:42] amen and he walks down and he comes to
[1:44:44] that gate and that old man said my son
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:52] no doubt of many a day he thought he'
[1:44:54] died in
[1:44:56] war my
[1:44:58] son welome home am
[1:45:03] hallah you notice the angel didn't stop
[1:45:05] him or take him back to the
[1:45:09] train this is one of the success
[1:45:12] stories that he could write about and
[1:45:14] tell
[1:45:15] about sure there's hundreds on the train
[1:45:18] that's going to be battling they're
[1:45:19] going to spend the rest but there's a
