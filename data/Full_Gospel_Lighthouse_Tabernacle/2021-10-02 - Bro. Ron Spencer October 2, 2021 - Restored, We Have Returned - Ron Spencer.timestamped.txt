[53:39] for us as we were at brother kelly
[53:41] hildebrandt's this last week and
[53:44] i
[53:46] in some ways i believe it's the greatest
[53:47] meeting we've ever had there
[53:50] and god just gave us some incredible
[53:52] liberty and
[53:53] and uh
[53:55] and uh so
[53:57] you know i just showed them on i the
[54:00] lord just showed them on saturday night
[54:02] that this fourth stage cancer patient
[54:04] can preach two hours
[54:18] god just did some incredible things i
[54:20] thought i had preached about 30 to 40
[54:22] minutes and it's two hours when it got
[54:25] done but we were
[54:26] we were just blessed by the lord and so
[54:29] good i'm so looking forward to tomorrow
[54:33] amen we're we're
[54:35] due to all these coven business we
[54:36] haven't been able to do it for a while
[54:38] and so it's just going to be good to be
[54:40] together and kind of gives us a glimpse
[54:42] of the foretaste of what it's going to
[54:44] be like on the other side and
[54:47] you know no time clocks
[54:49] one of these days we're not going to
[54:50] have a time clock or our bodies are not
[54:52] going to ache we're not going to wake up
[54:54] in a mood
[54:57] and everything's going to be perfect and
[55:00] so
[55:01] it's not disney world it's it's real

[55:09] your prayers this is kind of a busy
[55:10] season for me

[56:04] retirement anyway i wanna god bless you
[56:06] so good to see each and every you every
[56:08] one of you guys and amen joel enjoyed
[56:10] that song tonight that just goes right
[56:12] with what we're going to speak i'd like
[56:14] to speak to you tonight on
[56:17] restored
[56:19] we have returned
[56:22] amen you'll turn with me in your
[56:24] scriptures tonight
[56:28] isaiah chapter 65 and verse 17.
[56:35] amen
[56:37] isaiah 65 and verse 17.
[56:42] isaiah writes the commentary of the
[56:44] bible
[56:45] and he writes
[56:47] not a myth but this is how it's going to
[56:50] happen this is in god's mind
[56:53] and notice if it's in god's mind he
[56:54] reveals it through the prophet and then
[56:57] the prophet writes it or speaks it and
[56:59] when he speaks it then that word circles
[57:02] the earth
[57:03] for literally thousands of years and one
[57:06] day we're going to step into it
[57:11] and over the last little bit i've been
[57:13] speaking to you and i know you've caught
[57:14] it
[57:15] before it happens you've lived a life
[57:19] then you capture it when it happens and
[57:21] then afterwards you live it
[57:24] so you see it before it's coming with
[57:26] expectation and revelation knowing it's
[57:29] going to come
[57:30] and then you enjoy the miracle or the
[57:33] change of your life and then you live it
[57:37] amen and so
[57:38] we're certainly thrilled that we can do
[57:40] that isaiah chapter 65 and verse 17 for
[57:44] behold i create a new heavens and a new
[57:47] earth
[57:49] and the former shall be not remembered
[57:52] nor come into mind what a thought
[57:56] but be ye glad and rejoice forever in
[57:59] that which i create for behold i create
[58:02] jerusalem a rejoicing
[58:05] and her people a joy
[58:07] and i will rejoice in jerusalem
[58:10] and joy in my people and the voice of
[58:14] weeping
[58:15] shall be no more heard in her nor the
[58:18] voice of crying
[58:20] there shall be no more things
[58:23] an infinite of days nor an old man hath
[58:25] not filled his days for the child shall
[58:29] die at hundred years old but the sinner
[58:31] shall be a hundred years old shall be
[58:34] accursed and they shall build houses and
[58:37] inhabit them and they shall plant
[58:39] vineyards and eat the fruit of them
[58:42] they shall not be old and another
[58:44] inhabit they shall not plant in another
[58:46] eat for as the days of a tree are the
[58:50] days of my people and mine elect shall
[58:54] long enjoy the work of their hands
[58:57] and they shall not labor in vain
[59:00] nor bring forth for trouble
[59:02] for they are the seed of the blessed of
[59:06] the lord and their offspring with them
[59:09] and it shall come to pass that before
[59:12] they call i will answer
[59:15] and while they were yet speaking i will
[59:17] hear
[59:19] notice these next words the wolf
[59:22] and the lamb
[59:24] shall feed together
[59:27] and the lion shall eat straw like a
[59:29] bullock
[59:30] and the dust shall be the serpent's meat
[59:34] they shall not hurt nor destroy
[59:38] in mine holy mountain
[59:40] saith the lord
[59:42] hallelujah that's enough to shout about
[59:44] right there
[59:45] amen maybe you have a need on your heart
[59:47] you just like to bring it before the
[59:48] lord and say lord
[59:50] i want to be better i want you to feel
[59:53] me more than ever before tonight
[59:55] while the word goes forth fill my heart
[59:57] with your presence
[59:58] lord jesus we love you tonight and we
[1:00:01] just lift our hands before you
[1:00:03] we have great need that you'd come by
[1:00:05] our way this afternoon i pray that you
[1:00:08] touch our bodies strengthen them father
[1:00:10] for the work of the lord anoint us to
[1:00:12] get
[1:00:13] not only the speaker but also the hearer
[1:00:15] anoint us to get out of the way so you
[1:00:17] can speak to our hearts father
[1:00:20] lord we ask you that you would just lift
[1:00:22] us into a
[1:00:23] heavenly presence like never before and
[1:00:26] father i pray that you would give us a
[1:00:29] temporary resurrection
[1:00:31] that you would strengthen us father
[1:00:34] anoint us anoint our mind annoying our
[1:00:36] thoughts anoint our words
[1:00:39] and you see the needs of your children
[1:00:41] now we've lifted it before you and you
[1:00:44] and with you all things are possible to
[1:00:47] them that believe i ask you to touch our
[1:00:50] hearts in jesus name amen and amen and
[1:00:53] man you can be seated
[1:00:55] tell your neighbor let's have church
[1:01:02] revelations 21 and verse 4 says it like
[1:01:05] this
[1:01:07] and god shall wipe away
[1:01:09] all tears
[1:01:12] from their eyes and there shall be no
[1:01:14] more death
[1:01:16] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:01:18] there be any more pain
[1:01:20] for the former things are passed away
[1:01:22] and and he that set up on the throne
[1:01:25] said
[1:01:26] behold
[1:01:28] i make all things new
[1:01:32] and he said unto me right
[1:01:34] for these words are true
[1:01:38] and faithful
[1:01:41] we realize that we live in an age that
[1:01:43] all the prophets would have liked to
[1:01:45] have lived given a choice they would
[1:01:47] have wanted to live in this age
[1:01:50] the people of of the thousands and
[1:01:52] thousands of years ago had they been
[1:01:54] given the choice of what age would you
[1:01:57] want to be a part of the rapture in i
[1:01:59] would want to live in this age
[1:02:02] so we realized when god is pre-planning
[1:02:05] he chose you
[1:02:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:02:08] knowing that laodicea and all of its
[1:02:11] conditions and all of its wickedness and
[1:02:13] all of its darkness
[1:02:15] and everything that was going to be upon
[1:02:17] the earth every sodom condition that
[1:02:19] there could be
[1:02:21] every corrupt government that they could
[1:02:23] be
[1:02:24] every wickedness that there is has been
[1:02:26] loosed on the earth from the river
[1:02:28] euphrates every demon of hell has been
[1:02:31] loosed against the bride of jesus christ
[1:02:36] but god don't just anoint anoint us just
[1:02:40] to see if he can anoint us
[1:02:42] but he's pre-planned us
[1:02:46] to be the final voice to the final age
[1:02:50] he did not leave us unequipped
[1:02:55] he gave us the greatest weapons that he
[1:02:57] could give us
[1:02:59] and his words are eternal
[1:03:02] and when he speaks it he places
[1:03:05] literally hundreds and hundreds of
[1:03:07] promises at your disposal
[1:03:12] to give you the open book a book that
[1:03:15] had been sealed down through all the
[1:03:17] ages of time and he brought to this last
[1:03:20] generation that this bible could be open
[1:03:23] for us
[1:03:25] not hid with creeds and dogmas and
[1:03:28] men's teachings and men's theologies but
[1:03:31] god could send a prophet in this day
[1:03:36] a prophet with a message of the hour to
[1:03:39] open the word
[1:03:42] and to give it power and restore the
[1:03:45] church the bride of jesus christ so she
[1:03:49] stands today as a restored lady
[1:03:56] we're not bound in in in the in the
[1:04:00] hopeless camps of denominationalism
[1:04:03] going around in a circle blind and and
[1:04:06] wandering and don't have an open vision
[1:04:10] but we stand as a bride of jesus christ
[1:04:13] knowing exactly where we're at
[1:04:17] knowing what's laying just ahead of us
[1:04:20] knowing what we're stepping into
[1:04:27] now if we could just think of this just
[1:04:28] for a moment
[1:04:30] as a prophet would stand there at the
[1:04:32] end of the service and he's and he's
[1:04:34] speaking
[1:04:35] and and he's speaking about adam and eve
[1:04:38] walking out of the garden of eden
[1:04:41] how that god called them back
[1:04:44] into that perfect eden that now has the
[1:04:46] atmosphere is different
[1:04:48] and he takes lamb skins and wraps them
[1:04:52] around them
[1:04:53] brother bam talks about she was a
[1:04:55] blond-headed woman and she laid her head
[1:04:57] over on
[1:04:59] adam's strong shoulders on his chest
[1:05:05] and he said the drug the blood was
[1:05:07] dripping off of those those skins
[1:05:09] dripping down their legs
[1:05:11] as they walked out of the garden of eden
[1:05:14] god made them a promise
[1:05:18] because a part of him was walking out of
[1:05:20] the garden
[1:05:23] god's been working on this promise since
[1:05:26] adam
[1:05:28] now we're excited about
[1:05:31] the return of our lord jesus christ but
[1:05:34] can you imagine his excitement
[1:05:38] it's not an if it's going to happen his
[1:05:41] excitement is he's bringing you home
[1:05:48] he's restoring you back to where you
[1:05:51] were supposed to be in the first place
[1:05:55] hallelujah
[1:05:57] [Applause]
[1:06:08] hallelujah
[1:06:13] if you remember when brother branham has
[1:06:15] a couple of visions
[1:06:17] first of all he explains about adam and
[1:06:19] eve
[1:06:21] and he said the the other night while i
[1:06:23] was speaking and i'm just paraphrasing
[1:06:25] here so
[1:06:26] he said i watched adam and eve walk out
[1:06:28] of the garden of eden
[1:06:32] so the prophet when he calls her blonde
[1:06:34] headed
[1:06:35] was not guessing
[1:06:39] he kind of gives us a little idea about
[1:06:42] marilyn monroe and and make some
[1:06:44] comparisons there
[1:06:47] and
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:49] about how beautiful eve was
[1:06:53] i'm not comparing the two now
[1:06:55] but i want you to understand that
[1:06:57] that
[1:06:59] the prophet was looking at two realms at
[1:07:01] the same time
[1:07:04] and he could see the world falling apart
[1:07:08] and see denominations selling themselves
[1:07:10] over to
[1:07:11] uh
[1:07:13] to all different kinds of things like
[1:07:15] trying to raise money who's got the
[1:07:17] biggest tent
[1:07:18] even saying the revival is over for
[1:07:21] america
[1:07:23] and it was during a time when it looked
[1:07:25] like it was at its greatest cycle but
[1:07:27] look where she's at now
[1:07:29] because a prophet is not just a preacher
[1:07:32] but he's a gift of god
[1:07:34] more than a gift of god he is elijah to
[1:07:36] this generation
[1:07:40] and so when he's standing there and he
[1:07:41] walks to the pulpit and he begins to
[1:07:44] speak sermons like restoration of the
[1:07:46] bride tree
[1:07:48] and he looks back through the ages how
[1:07:50] the ages has been robbed of its leaves
[1:07:53] of worship
[1:07:55] the strength to come to the tree how the
[1:07:58] the beetles would eat eat it and and
[1:08:00] destroy the tree
[1:08:02] but he would not leave it with a
[1:08:04] destroyed tree he the scripture said i
[1:08:07] will restore
[1:08:10] saith the lord
[1:08:12] and brother branham was standing
[1:08:14] watching
[1:08:16] now let me just preface this he never
[1:08:19] spoke
[1:08:20] to a bride church like i'm preaching to
[1:08:23] now
[1:08:24] but he could see us coming
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:28] people that would enjoy the word
[1:08:31] as it was delivered
[1:08:34] he longed to see you but by vision he
[1:08:37] did
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:46] now
[1:08:47] i want you to understand
[1:08:50] when he tells the vision of the bride
[1:08:53] coming
[1:08:55] and he saw the the the nations
[1:08:59] and their their worldly church
[1:09:03] and their worldly garb
[1:09:05] and he said they were dancing
[1:09:07] to a tune of a beat
[1:09:09] and and they had like a fig leaf on them
[1:09:12] brother branham stood in her
[1:09:16] as god is showing them this vision
[1:09:22] and he begins to apologize
[1:09:24] and feel ashamed
[1:09:26] is this what i produced
[1:09:30] is this what i produced
[1:09:37] and then the angel tells him
[1:09:40] the pride will come
[1:09:41] back in view again
[1:09:44] and then he sees us from every nation
[1:09:49] from every nation he sees us gather
[1:09:52] and here we are all dressed
[1:09:56] hallelujah
[1:09:57] we've been dressed by this message
[1:10:01] we were thrilled to put it on
[1:10:04] hallelujah the dress where of
[1:10:06] malachi 4 5 and 6. ephesians 4 the fifo
[1:10:11] ministry
[1:10:12] we would have patience to allow
[1:10:14] ourselves to be watched
[1:10:17] purged
[1:10:19] repent and being baptized in the name of
[1:10:21] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:23] and then being filled with the holy
[1:10:25] ghost
[1:10:27] and then we could stand as an invincible
[1:10:29] army
[1:10:31] and a message that could that could
[1:10:34] give us the foundations
[1:10:36] and build us
[1:10:39] now let me just say this to many times
[1:10:41] we're thinking that we've got to go back
[1:10:44] it's not going back it's going forward
[1:10:49] we're going forward well well we're
[1:10:51] going back to pentecost no we're going
[1:10:54] forward to pentecost
[1:11:00] hallelujah
[1:11:04] hallelujah
[1:11:05] don't you love him
[1:11:07] any good to us
[1:11:10] our challenge as the bride of jesus
[1:11:12] christ
[1:11:13] is finishing
[1:11:20] our challenge is finishing it
[1:11:22] when brother branham was standing there
[1:11:24] and he watched them as they walked
[1:11:26] before and he just
[1:11:27] he expresses how thrilled that he was to
[1:11:29] see the bride of christ
[1:11:31] and then one kind of at the end kind of
[1:11:33] stumbles a little bit
[1:11:36] and he begins to scream stay in line
[1:11:41] stay in line stay in line
[1:11:45] let me let me just say many times
[1:11:48] he would scream out whatever you do
[1:11:50] don't miss it
[1:11:54] then he
[1:11:56] you know he's getting up in in the years
[1:11:58] there in his 50s and he begins to call
[1:12:01] himself an old man at 50.
[1:12:04] a lot of miles on his odometer
[1:12:10] has his hands behind his head
[1:12:13] and he's
[1:12:15] kind of thinking some real deep thoughts
[1:12:19] and in just a moment he's looking down
[1:12:22] at his body
[1:12:27] and then he's standing amongst the
[1:12:30] millions of people
[1:12:34] the angel's with him
[1:12:36] and he's seeing them and
[1:12:38] who are these people
[1:12:41] they're your converts
[1:12:44] they're your converts
[1:12:46] and a woman walks up and hugs him
[1:12:49] and he notices immediately
[1:12:52] there's no
[1:12:54] human feelings
[1:12:58] he notices immediately
[1:13:00] what around
[1:13:03] what a round
[1:13:06] no human feelings and and the angel
[1:13:08] asked her
[1:13:10] asked brother branham do you know her
[1:13:11] and he said no i don't believe i do
[1:13:13] and he said you led her to the lord
[1:13:16] in her 90s
[1:13:21] restored
[1:13:25] restored
[1:13:28] a couple of years ago i spoke to you as
[1:13:30] an audience and i spoke it at brother
[1:13:31] tim pruitt's
[1:13:34] and these were the scriptures that
[1:13:37] that i used
[1:13:41] many believe that this is the sermon
[1:13:43] that caused satan to be so upset
[1:13:50] in first samuel chapter 30 and verse 1
[1:13:53] forgive me
[1:13:54] it came to pass when david was
[1:13:57] and his men were come to zig lad on the
[1:13:59] third day
[1:14:01] that the amalekites had invaded the
[1:14:03] south and ziglag and smit and smitten
[1:14:06] ziglag and burned it with fire
[1:14:09] and had taken women captives that were
[1:14:12] therein and they slew not any
[1:14:14] either great or small but carried them
[1:14:16] away and went on their way
[1:14:19] and so david and his men came to the
[1:14:21] city and behold it was burned with fire
[1:14:23] with their wives and their sons and
[1:14:26] their daughters were taken captives and
[1:14:28] then david and the people that were with
[1:14:31] him lifted up their voice and wept until
[1:14:34] they had no power to weep
[1:14:37] and david's two wives were taken
[1:14:43] and i'm not going to try to say the
[1:14:44] first one the second was abigail
[1:14:48] until they
[1:14:49] the wife of nabal
[1:14:52] and david was greatly distressed
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:14:57] for the people spake of stoning him
[1:15:00] because of the soul of the people was
[1:15:03] greed
[1:15:04] and every man for his sons for his
[1:15:06] daughters
[1:15:08] but notice these next words but david
[1:15:10] encouraged himself
[1:15:13] in the lord his god
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:16] are you with me when everything turns
[1:15:19] against you
[1:15:20] and it looks like the enemy has taken
[1:15:22] everything that you've got
[1:15:27] god's not finished with the plan
[1:15:30] though you're walking through some of
[1:15:32] the darkest shadows of your life
[1:15:35] don't look at it with your physical eyes
[1:15:39] you keep your focus on the plan of god
[1:15:44] come on church
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:51] come on church
[1:15:53] and david stood there and his men's even
[1:15:55] speaking about stoning him men that
[1:15:58] would fight for him and give their life
[1:16:00] for him but now they're so in grief
[1:16:03] until they're willing to stone their
[1:16:05] king
[1:16:07] but he encouraged himself of the lord
[1:16:10] david said unto abathur the priest of of
[1:16:13] amalie's son i prayed bring hither the
[1:16:16] ephod and abbathar brought the the ephod
[1:16:20] of david and david inquired at the lord
[1:16:23] saying
[1:16:24] shall i pursue.
[1:16:27] after this troop
[1:16:29] shall i overtake
[1:16:31] them
[1:16:33] and he answered i love god's answer
[1:16:38] pursue
[1:16:40] for thou shalt surely overtake them
[1:16:44] and without fail
[1:16:47] recover
[1:16:48] all
[1:16:50] [Applause]
[1:17:02] i want you to read that last words with
[1:17:03] me that god said
[1:17:05] pursue
[1:17:08] for thou shalt surely overtake them
[1:17:12] and without fail
[1:17:16] recover all
[1:17:23] i want you to understand what you are
[1:17:26] watching
[1:17:28] is two years ago i felt led to preach
[1:17:30] this sermon not knowing what was coming
[1:17:33] my way
[1:17:35] but the amalekites
[1:17:38] they're known to sneak in behind and
[1:17:41] steal everything you got but i want to
[1:17:43] put him on notice tonight
[1:17:46] we have pursued
[1:17:51] we have overtaken
[1:17:53] and we will recover it all
[1:18:05] hallelujah
[1:18:13] brother tim if you're watching tonight
[1:18:14] or next week i want you to say these
[1:18:17] words pursue
[1:18:19] for thou shall surely overtake them
[1:18:22] and without faith
[1:18:24] recover and all without fail recover it
[1:18:27] all
[1:18:30] god's not done
[1:18:33] he's still got work for us to do
[1:18:38] now watch how jesus goes to a woman at
[1:18:41] the well
[1:18:43] i want to read one scripture here john
[1:18:45] chapter 4 and verse 10.
[1:18:47] jesus answered and said unto her
[1:18:51] if thou knewest the gift of god
[1:18:55] and who it is that saith to thee
[1:18:59] give me to drink
[1:19:01] thou would us have asked of him
[1:19:04] and he would have given thee
[1:19:06] living water
[1:19:10] five husbands and the one you're living
[1:19:12] with is not your husband
[1:19:15] satan had tried to destroy her life with
[1:19:18] all kind of natural desires
[1:19:21] but i want you to see god looks
[1:19:23] way beyond the human element
[1:19:27] he looks way beyond your choices and
[1:19:30] your failures
[1:19:32] he looks way beyond your memory book of
[1:19:35] your life
[1:19:36] where satan beats you and scars you and
[1:19:39] he's a brutal taskmaster
[1:19:42] he'll scar your mind he'll scar you
[1:19:48] he'll make you live a life of regrets
[1:19:51] he'll make you live a life of sorrows
[1:19:54] he'll make you may live a life of
[1:19:56] wishing
[1:19:57] and the what ifs
[1:20:00] the choices in life took you somewhere
[1:20:03] on your road
[1:20:04] i made a choice for god let me just say
[1:20:06] this to you none of us was looking for
[1:20:09] god god was looking for us
[1:20:14] god came looking for you he came looking
[1:20:16] for adam he came looking for jacob
[1:20:20] he came looking for mary he came looking
[1:20:23] for you
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:26] he found you in a lot of different
[1:20:28] conditions
[1:20:35] i cannot imagine the waste of the
[1:20:37] accumulated days of the wasted days
[1:20:40] the peoples
[1:20:42] lost in their lives
[1:20:45] days on temporary things that's really
[1:20:47] not real
[1:20:50] anything that is temporary is not real
[1:20:54] never get your eyes or your focus on
[1:20:56] temporary
[1:20:58] things as a christian
[1:21:03] who we were
[1:21:06] and who we are
[1:21:08] is two different people
[1:21:14] i want that to settle in
[1:21:16] as a christian
[1:21:20] who we were
[1:21:22] and who we are is two complete different
[1:21:26] people
[1:21:29] now it looks like the same house
[1:21:34] it sounds like the same house
[1:21:37] but the old man came out and the new man
[1:21:39] came in
[1:21:42] and there was a seed that was always
[1:21:44] there we never was a hog we were always
[1:21:48] a sheep
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:55] come on church
[1:21:57] we always were god's seed
[1:22:02] our conditions was miserable
[1:22:05] and we were slaves to a lot of things
[1:22:07] but i want to remind you tonight once
[1:22:09] you're free
[1:22:11] you never have to go back to slavery no
[1:22:13] more
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:21] we hear the slaves singing songs
[1:22:24] those songs would be
[1:22:27] about getting free
[1:22:28] most of their songs was about getting
[1:22:30] free
[1:22:32] and amongst even the songs become a code
[1:22:37] they would sing songs like down by the
[1:22:40] river
[1:22:42] and they'd sing it all day long down by
[1:22:45] the river
[1:22:48] and the reason they were singing that
[1:22:49] song is if you want to go free
[1:22:52] there's going to be a freedom train down
[1:22:54] by the river tonight in the middle of
[1:22:56] the night if you can get to the river
[1:22:59] you don't have to be a slave tomorrow
[1:23:06] hallelujah
[1:23:08] there ought to be a code words in our
[1:23:10] songs tonight
[1:23:12] there is going to be a meeting in the
[1:23:15] air in the sweet sweet by and by and i'm
[1:23:18] going to meet you
[1:23:21] meet you there
[1:23:27] hallelujah
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:37] brother branham so appropriately spoke a
[1:23:39] sermon called as an eagle stir at this
[1:23:42] nest here in harrisonburg
[1:23:45] and he describes an eagle's cycle of
[1:23:48] life
[1:23:49] and how he has to stir the nest
[1:23:53] it was so here as well as around the
[1:23:55] world god had to shake our
[1:23:56] denominational nest
[1:24:00] and make eagles uncomfortable
[1:24:03] to get out of those nests
[1:24:05] and sail in the skies where you could
[1:24:08] have dominion
[1:24:10] and see yourself in a in a blood
[1:24:14] that you can walk out of
[1:24:16] never to go back ever again
[1:24:24] i think seeing a vision of yourself
[1:24:26] restored is very important
[1:24:33] so many times our vision shows us what
[1:24:35] we was
[1:24:37] why don't you just ask the holy ghost to
[1:24:39] change your vision
[1:24:41] i'm preaching to you now vision of being
[1:24:45] restored
[1:24:47] you came out of the book the lamb's book
[1:24:49] of life
[1:24:51] you're going back
[1:24:53] to where god called you to be in the
[1:24:55] original
[1:24:57] it's kind of like israel in this
[1:24:59] generation they were called to go back
[1:25:02] with nothing on their back basically
[1:25:04] they were called to go back to their
[1:25:06] homeland we've been called to go back to
[1:25:09] our homeland
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:19] maybe your wings have got dusty
[1:25:23] maybe your eyes has got filmed over
[1:25:29] i think it's time to get yourself to the
[1:25:31] rock and beat the crust off of the eyes
[1:25:35] maybe time to have an old-fashioned
[1:25:37] prayer made in your home
[1:25:40] where you and god have a conference
[1:25:44] where it's way beyond emotion and way
[1:25:46] beyond feelings
[1:25:48] way beyond i'm sorry but where you and
[1:25:51] god can you come to a spot to where you
[1:25:54] die to yourself and god himself
[1:25:59] christ's the mystery comes and reveals
[1:26:01] himself in you because you are the
[1:26:05] mystery revealed
[1:26:10] paul would say it like this forgetting
[1:26:12] those things which are in the past
[1:26:16] don't dig them up
[1:26:24] so many times we focus ourselves on
[1:26:26] temporary situations
[1:26:29] that are not real
[1:26:32] anything that is
[1:26:35] eternal is real
[1:26:37] but anything that is temporary
[1:26:40] is really not real
[1:26:42] but brother ron i've been through some
[1:26:44] hard times and it felt so real yep
[1:26:47] but it wasn't
[1:26:48] eternal i've been through some bad
[1:26:51] sicknesses and it felt really real but
[1:26:54] it wasn't eternal
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:27:00] it wasn't eternal
[1:27:02] god had you chartered on this month and
[1:27:04] he's watched over your life
[1:27:07] and there's been a lot of temporary
[1:27:08] situations that came through your life
[1:27:11] hang on to that which is eternal
[1:27:17] it's hard to us to focus and see a 2 000
[1:27:20] year old graveyard
[1:27:23] that one day people will walk out of
[1:27:27] in a well perfect body
[1:27:30] bodies that have went back to the gases
[1:27:33] and ashes
[1:27:36] maybe burn at the stake or drowned at
[1:27:38] the sea
[1:27:40] wind the season no man can produce a
[1:27:44] rapture no man can produce a
[1:27:47] resurrection but we can live in an
[1:27:49] atmosphere
[1:27:52] of a revelation that when it happens
[1:27:55] it can't happen without us
[1:28:02] hallelujah
[1:28:04] i was sitting there i think i'd be
[1:28:05] shouting but it's all right
[1:28:11] the prophet of god said
[1:28:13] what if god would have told john the
[1:28:15] revel later
[1:28:16] it's going to be 2 000 years
[1:28:19] before my coming
[1:28:21] john would have come back and told the
[1:28:22] church well i guess we may as well eat
[1:28:24] drink and be married because we're going
[1:28:26] to have so many generations jesus is not
[1:28:29] coming for 2000 years
[1:28:32] you see the church
[1:28:34] would have been so loose
[1:28:38] there have been have would have been no
[1:28:41] on the mark
[1:28:44] and that's a term in horse racing
[1:28:48] for a horse to be ready
[1:28:51] and the rider to have his whip cracked
[1:28:53] just at the right
[1:28:55] moment
[1:28:56] he's not doing it just
[1:28:58] just to be doing it but that that horse
[1:29:01] is trained when that whip cracks
[1:29:05] it's time to give it everything that
[1:29:07] you've got
[1:29:08] little bride i want to say this to you
[1:29:10] it's time
[1:29:12] it's our time
[1:29:14] give it everything
[1:29:16] that you've got
[1:29:18] go hold nothing back
[1:29:20] give it all
[1:29:38] god preserves the seed
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:41] when you can't watch over yourself he's
[1:29:43] preserving you
[1:29:46] he's watching over that life
[1:29:49] that life seat
[1:29:53] listen to him in luke 22 and verse 31
[1:29:57] this is going to be the spokesman of the
[1:29:59] church
[1:30:00] on the day of pentecost
[1:30:03] and the lord said
[1:30:04] simon simon
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:08] satan had desired
[1:30:11] to have you
[1:30:13] you put your name in there
[1:30:16] that he might sift you as wheat
[1:30:18] notice these next words
[1:30:21] are so powerful
[1:30:23] but i have prayed for you
[1:30:30] on the days you feel so alone jesus has
[1:30:33] prayed for you
[1:30:35] not your pastor not your best friend but
[1:30:38] god himself
[1:30:43] he's not leaving this up to a fickle man
[1:30:47] he is determined to see this through
[1:30:50] [Applause]
[1:30:52] and ev this rapture will be universal
[1:30:55] but it will be individual
[1:30:58] two in the bed two in the field two with
[1:31:00] them
[1:31:02] wanna be taken one of you left
[1:31:05] one in virginia i'm going to be that one
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:09] come on church we got to be determined
[1:31:11] i'm not watching man i'm not watching
[1:31:13] politics i got my eyes on this word
[1:31:17] and this word is bringing me into
[1:31:18] perfection
[1:31:31] watch how paul writes it
[1:31:33] hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8 that's
[1:31:35] all right
[1:31:47] by faith abraham
[1:31:50] when he was called to go out into a
[1:31:52] place which he
[1:31:54] which he should after receive for an
[1:31:57] inheritance
[1:31:58] obeyed
[1:32:00] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:32:02] went
[1:32:04] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[1:32:07] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:32:10] in tabernacles with isaac
[1:32:12] and jacob
[1:32:16] doesn't even mention esau
[1:32:22] i just spoke to you about temporary
[1:32:24] and what's real
[1:32:31] the way you look at humanity is a whole
[1:32:33] lot different than where god looks at it
[1:32:39] i know that's breathtaking
[1:32:41] but god didn't even look at esau
[1:32:46] but he was a better man
[1:32:48] naturally
[1:32:49] than jacob was
[1:32:54] oh but this person is so great brother
[1:32:56] ron and this one's so great it don't
[1:32:58] matter how we look at it
[1:33:01] this doesn't matter how you look at it
[1:33:05] there's people that no doubt can speak
[1:33:07] much better than i can
[1:33:09] they're much more handsome they carry
[1:33:11] themselves much more better than but god
[1:33:13] looked at me
[1:33:15] and he looked at you
[1:33:17] and he bypassed a million to get to you
[1:33:23] you talk about grace i don't need
[1:33:24] another sermon i just say god thank you
[1:33:40] okay let me just put it in a little
[1:33:41] better perspective if you can't get it
[1:33:45] washington is probably the one of the
[1:33:48] most one of the most civilized or
[1:33:51] populated
[1:33:53] cities that we have in america
[1:33:58] say something pretty difficult right
[1:34:00] here
[1:34:01] but god's not paying attention to none
[1:34:03] of them
[1:34:04] there's a couple groups of people there
[1:34:06] that assembled themselves
[1:34:13] and in god's mind mike walls is more
[1:34:16] important
[1:34:17] to god
[1:34:19] than the president of the united states
[1:34:22] america
[1:34:35] come on i'm going to preach to you now
[1:34:37] i want to tell you what you've been
[1:34:39] restored to
[1:34:47] brother on your way out on your thoughts
[1:34:48] am i
[1:34:50] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:34:54] so when it burns with a fervent heat mic
[1:34:57] walls and congregation will still be
[1:35:00] eternal
[1:35:01] [Applause]
[1:35:31] i lost my place
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:35:34] still in the human body you know
[1:35:40] notice these words for he looked for a
[1:35:43] city
[1:35:44] which hath
[1:35:46] foundations
[1:35:48] whose builder and maker
[1:35:52] is god
[1:35:58] now
[1:36:00] the reason he could look for a city
[1:36:03] whose builder and maker is god is he met
[1:36:05] the king
[1:36:14] now abraham met the king
[1:36:18] at 100 years old
[1:36:22] brother meadows is 90. we just
[1:36:24] celebrated his birthday
[1:36:27] 10 years from now
[1:36:29] brother medicine's going to start
[1:36:31] another family
[1:36:38] just ask sister sharon later
[1:36:40] just ask her later
[1:36:42] [Applause]
[1:36:51] and just as funny as it is in this
[1:36:53] building
[1:36:54] god told abraham he's going to have a
[1:36:56] son
[1:37:00] and he looked at it as total
[1:37:03] impossibility
[1:37:05] but he was with the king
[1:37:09] of an eternal land
[1:37:12] and god saw his lineage
[1:37:16] that had to come through through the
[1:37:18] lamb's book had to come on the earth
[1:37:21] and he was speaking with a man
[1:37:23] i can do the impossible
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:28] but i'm not going to leave you like that
[1:37:30] to do it
[1:37:31] [Applause]
[1:37:33] that's what god has done with this
[1:37:34] message i'm not going to leave you as a
[1:37:37] church
[1:37:39] i'm not going to leave you as a
[1:37:40] denomination
[1:37:42] i'm not going to make you i suggest
[1:37:44] another group of people
[1:37:49] hallelujah
[1:37:51] i'm gonna restore you
[1:37:57] i'm gonna restore you and bring you back
[1:37:59] to your
[1:38:00] original that's what i'm going to do
[1:38:25] imagine being abraham's neighbor
[1:38:33] he's set with a stick
[1:38:37] and he's told these stories for years
[1:38:41] and you've heard them
[1:38:43] you know sometimes as we get older we
[1:38:45] repeat the same thing we've said over
[1:38:46] and over
[1:38:50] some of you get it today
[1:38:52] some of you get tomorrow some of you are
[1:38:54] not not laughing because your parents
[1:38:56] are sitting right next to you
[1:38:58] you've heard that story 61 times and
[1:39:01] sometimes in the middle of the story you
[1:39:03] just start telling what the end is so
[1:39:05] you can get there
[1:39:14] and abraham was repeating the story over
[1:39:16] and over and over oh yeah
[1:39:27] probably didn't keep his hair real well
[1:39:30] his clothes were old
[1:39:32] you know when you get older you wear the
[1:39:33] same thing
[1:39:36] you don't know where you washed it or
[1:39:38] not you smell it
[1:39:43] if it passes the smell test
[1:39:45] you put that baby on
[1:39:59] no doubt for the last year he has told
[1:40:02] in that condition
[1:40:03] i met a king
[1:40:06] i met a king
[1:40:10] then circumstances come along and he's
[1:40:12] got to move
[1:40:14] and he he's forced to move and he goes
[1:40:17] toward grill
[1:40:18] somewhere in the journey
[1:40:22] same neighbors if we can just come along
[1:40:24] with this you just come along with my
[1:40:26] folly just for a moment
[1:40:28] the same neighbors
[1:40:30] are watching him day after day and one
[1:40:32] day he walks out
[1:40:38] [Applause]
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:43] he walks out in the body that could take
[1:40:46] care of the word
[1:40:49] that could bring forth the promise
[1:40:51] because the king of the promise had set
[1:40:54] in his tent
[1:40:56] and it wasn't just for abraham but it
[1:40:58] was also for sarah
[1:41:00] she had to catch the revelation for
[1:41:02] herself and see herself in the promise
[1:41:05] it's not just for preachers
[1:41:12] sarah's got to catch the revelation for
[1:41:15] herself
[1:41:18] am chief
[1:41:21] the bride of the last
[1:41:24] [Applause]
[1:41:30] day neighbors walked back in said mama
[1:41:33] we got new neighbors
[1:41:36] old people lived there like yesterday
[1:41:38] new people just walked out of they must
[1:41:40] have company
[1:41:44] it's going to happen here in elkton
[1:41:47] it's going to happen in grotto's let me
[1:41:49] just tell you a little bit about your
[1:41:50] future
[1:41:51] because you have been restored
[1:41:59] the rapture's been going on for quite a
[1:42:01] while
[1:42:02] it's been catching you up
[1:42:04] in a heavenly atmosphere
[1:42:06] you've been believing that you're a part
[1:42:08] of it
[1:42:09] [Applause]
[1:42:10] and all of a sudden you begin to talk
[1:42:12] about resurrected saints and talking
[1:42:14] about seeing your life once
[1:42:17] your neighbors are going to witness a
[1:42:19] change going on at your house
[1:42:31] brother on but it takes a while
[1:42:33] sometimes i i understand
[1:42:35] i understand i understand how we lose
[1:42:36] our patience
[1:42:38] patience is probably one of the things
[1:42:40] that most men never stood in line for
[1:42:47] i expected at least 130 amens from the
[1:42:50] sisters
[1:42:53] i'm going to say it again just to make
[1:42:55] sure you're not dead out there
[1:43:02] i know what some of you are thinking now
[1:43:05] don't get carnal
[1:43:06] god's not going to turn you back young
[1:43:08] again for y'all to have a bunch of
[1:43:09] babies here
[1:43:12] he's going to turn you back young again
[1:43:14] so we can take a rapture
[1:43:26] i do understand how that sometimes in
[1:43:28] our patients we
[1:43:29] we sometimes think well we've been
[1:43:31] believing this for a long time now some
[1:43:33] of you were young christians when i
[1:43:34] first came here about 20 21 22 years ago
[1:43:38] you were young christians you grew up
[1:43:40] with me and as as as
[1:43:42] as a pastor to you and
[1:43:44] and then some of you are getting
[1:43:46] gray-headed but listen i can't i i can't
[1:43:48] make the rapture happen
[1:43:51] i'm right with you i'm believing for it
[1:43:54] i'm preaching for it like it's going to
[1:43:56] be tomorrow
[1:43:58] could be tonight before we get home
[1:44:03] some have died in faith they didn't give
[1:44:05] up they didn't they wasn't doubters they
[1:44:06] wasn't sinners when they went to their
[1:44:08] graves they stepped from this room to
[1:44:10] that realm
[1:44:12] believers here believe us there
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:17] was they imperfect because they had to
[1:44:19] go by the way of the grave no god's
[1:44:21] blood made them perfect
[1:44:24] so they stepped from this rim to that
[1:44:32] realm you know imagine sarah
[1:44:35] has to wait till she's 90.
[1:44:38] listen to the promise
[1:44:42] imagine job
[1:44:44] that sat on an ash sheep
[1:44:46] the place where he gave
[1:44:49] sacrifices unto god it was that place
[1:44:52] that he felt comfort and and he rubbed
[1:44:55] he rubbed those
[1:44:57] those those balls on his back and on his
[1:44:59] body
[1:45:02] it was not an overnight experience
[1:45:08] the cancers that are leaving my body
[1:45:12] they begin to come up in my head you
[1:45:14] watch me itch my head sometimes
[1:45:16] and and and and they just come up all
[1:45:18] over me because they're they're trying
[1:45:20] to get out
[1:45:22] i got a big one on my leg right now it's
[1:45:24] trying to get out they're trying to get
[1:45:26] out they got to leave because the raps
[1:45:28] are going to happen this body is going
[1:45:29] to change and he ain't
[1:45:31] he taking cancer with it
[1:45:40] and by the way i ain't looking for a
[1:45:41] hole in the ground i'm looking for a
[1:45:43] chariot to take me in the sky
[1:46:06] it's a man talking right there could
[1:46:07] have more children
[1:46:16] i have people call me and say well
[1:46:18] brother ron
[1:46:21] why is this cancer done
[1:46:25] why ain't it gone
[1:46:27] you're a believer
[1:46:29] hey listen if it was up to me
[1:46:32] it'd have been gone day one
[1:46:38] i got enough atomic power laying in
[1:46:40] front of me tonight to blow him back to
[1:46:42] smithereens
[1:46:44] so god's got a purpose in all of this
[1:46:47] and i don't know how many cancer demons
[1:46:49] that we're destroying as we're going but
[1:46:51] god healed me a calvary
[1:46:53] and when he took those stripes at
[1:46:55] paula's judgment hall he was defeating
[1:46:57] those demons
[1:46:59] i don't care what you've got to go
[1:47:00] through in your life
[1:47:02] god's already whipped your enemy it's
[1:47:05] defeated
[1:47:16] shadrach meshach and abednego their
[1:47:18] names roll off of our lips just so
[1:47:20] quickly but there was a fourth man that
[1:47:22] was important in the fire and they did
[1:47:25] not know he was there until they got
[1:47:27] there
[1:47:32] i've said this before i'll say it again
[1:47:34] we've got a lot of men that want to
[1:47:36] fight a devil and they ain't never got
[1:47:38] no blood on their on their sword
[1:47:42] we got a lot of preachers
[1:47:44] they're like first lieutenants coming
[1:47:45] out of college
[1:47:49] they got a name tag but they ain't got
[1:47:51] no more authority or war experience than
[1:47:54] nothing
[1:47:55] [Applause]
[1:47:57] i want to hear a man that's been through
[1:47:58] some things in his life
[1:48:00] that can stand there and look the devil
[1:48:02] in the eyes and tell him you don't have
[1:48:05] enough
[1:48:07] you didn't bring enough and you ain't
[1:48:09] got enough
[1:48:12] god is on my side and he's proved he's
[1:48:15] on my side
[1:48:31] let me read to you about a man like that
[1:48:33] i said those statements to preface this
[1:48:38] in second timothy chapter
[1:48:40] 4 and just verse 1
[1:48:43] i charge thee before god and for the
[1:48:45] lord jesus christ who shall judge the
[1:48:48] quick and the dead and not his appearing
[1:48:50] in his kingdom
[1:48:51] preach the word
[1:48:54] be instant in season
[1:48:56] out of season
[1:48:58] reprove
[1:49:01] rebuke
[1:49:03] with all longsuffering
[1:49:05] and doctrine
[1:49:07] for the time will come
[1:49:09] we are there
[1:49:10] when they shall not endure sound
[1:49:12] doctrine
[1:49:18] they want a bible to their own choosing
[1:49:20] they want a church to their own choosing
[1:49:22] they wanted jesus to their own likeness
[1:49:29] come on i want people that's that's
[1:49:31] powerful in the word of god
[1:49:33] they don't have to bathe them around and
[1:49:35] they're not a bunch of hotbed plants
[1:49:40] we're going to go through some seasons
[1:49:41] in our lives we're going to go through
[1:49:43] some dry times
[1:49:44] springtime some winter times we're going
[1:49:47] to go through some difficult hours
[1:49:49] but we keep getting back up every day
[1:49:53] we'll never go back in our lives
[1:49:58] i'm not going to go back because that
[1:49:59] that pastor ain't shook my hand
[1:50:07] well
[1:50:09] for those that's been here in the last
[1:50:10] two years
[1:50:12] i apologize
[1:50:14] i'm not trying to avoid you
[1:50:17] i'm trying to stay well
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:23] i just went to saskatoon
[1:50:25] and the deacons ushered me in
[1:50:28] and they ushered me out
[1:50:30] i waved and smiled from the pulpit
[1:50:33] there will come a day where we can sit
[1:50:35] down by the river watch the flow goes by
[1:50:38] we'll never age at that spot we can talk
[1:50:40] it all over there
[1:50:43] but until then my heart will go on
[1:50:45] singing
[1:50:48] [Music]
[1:50:51] for the time will come when they will
[1:50:52] not endure sound doctrine
[1:50:55] but after their own lusts shall heap to
[1:50:58] themselves teach us
[1:51:01] having itchiness
[1:51:06] come on
[1:51:09] anybody can take this message
[1:51:13] that has any ability at all to speak
[1:51:16] can stand up and preach the word
[1:51:19] and put everything just exactly right
[1:51:22] and cause you to love him
[1:51:25] live any way you want to sitting in the
[1:51:27] pew
[1:51:29] but you need a god call man
[1:51:32] yeah i'm not just talking to here i'm
[1:51:34] talking a lot of places
[1:51:36] you need a god-called pastor that was
[1:51:39] ordained of god to see you through
[1:51:42] a man with the holy ghost
[1:51:45] that will cause sin out
[1:51:48] [Applause]
[1:51:49] and will fight for you and fight for
[1:51:52] your children and your children's
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:52:00] children you need a church that's not
[1:52:03] run by deacon boards
[1:52:06] trustee boards
[1:52:08] and a puppet pastor
[1:52:16] [Applause]
[1:52:26] many churches have to vote for weeks and
[1:52:28] months
[1:52:31] on buying chairs
[1:52:35] lawnmowers tractors
[1:52:41] i'm getting ready to spend about forty
[1:52:43] thousand dollars on a new piano
[1:52:45] and i ain't ask a person
[1:52:57] because i think we need it
[1:52:59] that keeps getting out of two
[1:53:01] and we got the best pianist in the world
[1:53:17] why did i think you needed those seats
[1:53:20] because i had a little while to preach
[1:53:21] to you
[1:53:24] and those seats are more comfortable
[1:53:26] than the mother's seats well
[1:53:28] i'm not bringing it up for a vote or an
[1:53:30] opinion tonight i'm just telling you
[1:53:31] that's where it is
[1:53:36] come on church
[1:53:38] didn't ask you for an extra dime god is
[1:53:41] prepared he'll take care of this church
[1:53:44] because i want to tell you
[1:53:48] i want to tell you something there's
[1:53:50] something real that's going on here
[1:53:55] god kept dealing with me to get these
[1:53:58] these seats because we needed more
[1:53:59] seating
[1:54:02] and now he's going to put people in
[1:54:04] those seats
[1:54:06] so let the critics reach
[1:54:08] let them hire and scream
[1:54:11] god always has a plan
[1:54:26] oh
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:38] ain't it good
[1:54:40] ain't it good i'm gonna have to finish
[1:54:42] this at another time but they think
[1:54:43] that's good it's really good
[1:54:49] i want you to remember when you look
[1:54:51] over one another
[1:54:53] never take it for granted
[1:54:55] that this is the way that it always was
[1:55:03] it's kind of like two deacons
[1:55:05] that i met many many many years ago
[1:55:08] and i thought they were incredible men i
[1:55:11] just loved them both absolutely
[1:55:14] loved them both
[1:55:16] they came into office this is when i was
[1:55:18] a young man had red hair like another
[1:55:20] fellow here
[1:55:24] the pastor was sitting across the he
[1:55:26] said how you like those guys i said man
[1:55:28] they're awesome guys
[1:55:30] he said you ought to have been here when
[1:55:32] they first started out
[1:55:36] he said you see
[1:55:39] both of them made threats that they were
[1:55:41] going to kill each other
[1:55:47] and he said one was on the run and the
[1:55:49] other was chasing him
[1:55:52] and he chased him right into billy
[1:55:53] andrews church
[1:55:56] and both of them sit side by side so
[1:56:00] they wouldn't get away and both of them
[1:56:01] had enough conviction don't kill them in
[1:56:03] church
[1:56:10] and billy andrews preached
[1:56:12] and he preached convictions so straight
[1:56:15] and strong
[1:56:16] until both of those guys carrying guns
[1:56:19] i'm not going to ask how many guns is in
[1:56:20] this building tonight
[1:56:22] came running to the altar and give their
[1:56:25] heart to the lord
[1:56:27] bitter enemies in one service became
[1:56:31] best friends
[1:56:33] [Applause]
[1:56:35] don't tell me what you was
[1:56:38] cause that's not the important thing
[1:56:41] tell me who you are
[1:56:48] hallelujah
[1:56:57] the man writing these scriptures
[1:56:59] was a murderer
[1:57:03] he hated the church of jesus christ
[1:57:06] he was he was guilty
[1:57:08] of having stephen stoned
[1:57:12] but now he comes to the end of his
[1:57:14] ministry

[1:58:39] the day before i went to canada
[1:58:42] i went for scans
[1:58:47] and when i came when the doctors came in
[1:58:51] they said you've got a blood clot in
[1:58:52] your lung
[1:58:55] quite large
[1:58:56] your right lung
[1:58:58] well if you look that up you don't take

[1:59:25] and i'm not martial dealing
[1:59:29] much more powerful than marks are doing
[1:59:31] because what i'm shooting won't miss
[1:59:34] i won't need but one little rock
[1:59:47] you can cause strokes
[1:59:49] it can cause your heart to shut down
[1:59:51] cause a whole lot of things it can
[1:59:53] happen in a moment
[1:59:55] and dr gohan gave me some really good
[1:59:57] advice

[2:00:41] fear right now they'd be afraid to get
[2:00:43] their heart rate up
[2:00:48] they dare wouldn't get on no treadmill
