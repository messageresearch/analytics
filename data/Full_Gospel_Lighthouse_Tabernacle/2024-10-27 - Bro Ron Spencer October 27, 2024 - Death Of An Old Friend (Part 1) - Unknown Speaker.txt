the songs this morning and if I could have requested it it would have been singing that song that she sung because it goes right with the sermon and I actually thought about asking Matthew but I cut my hand so I I as I was going to ask him to have you sing so you it it was in the order anyway so amen man God bless you could we stand to our feet this morning if you will turn with me to Luke chapter 22 and verse 31 Luke chapter 22 and verse 31 amen don't you love him amen Luke chap 22:31 this very familiar portion of scripture and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he might sift you as wheat I love these next words but I have prayed for you that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto them Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before Thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me Luke 7 and verse 18 and this is this Catches Us all right here for I know that that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing let's read that scripture with us for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing wives look over to your husband said it's a truth for to will is depress with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would do I do not but the evil which I would do I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more that I do it it but that sin dwelleth in me I findeth then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God that after the word the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin Romans chapter 8 and verse one then we'll have our seats there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit let's read that together if we will amen you can be seated what an awesome job brother Andrew did last night amen hallu I I I had some notes down I was going to I was going to share with you about the offer that was made to brother Andrew on in a job situation I actually sat in the same room at the same table and you know many times people will be made a lot of offers in their life Satan will make you an offer he made Jesus an offer I've been made offers and as I sat there and listened to the offers that Andrew was was offered that day and and you think about sometimes mindboggling money how it would change your life how it would change your family how it would change your children's life and then the the things that go with it and I sat quietly and I I I talked with the officers of of the company and I spoke to them a bit and we were there probably a couple hours and and uh we were there on a on a different project but they offered him that and so we drove about 3 hours in the truck together total silence and as we drove and we got to afon Mountain Andrew I was driving and Andrew said Dad I can't take that job I said yeah I know you can't take it son but I couldn't tell you you couldn't take it you have to put God first in your life there'll be a lot of things that you have to do in life that you know it would have been easier if you'd have taken the easier way on but money is not everything and at the end of the day God pays all his debts you've been serving the lord for quite a little while he'll he'll pay his debts don't you worry he don't get behind on his bills either amen God bless you God bless you today today I'd like to speak to you on death of an old friend oh yeah they probably need just a little bit more sound if I could get it my voice seems to be weak this morning I had an old friend and I I'd like to invite you to the funeral this morning dearly beloved beloved we are gathered together today for the memory of of this man this man was born 1961 on on August the 26th 8th month of the year he was about 7 PB and 6 o and short that's the way it'd be the rest of his life but on but this fell he is going to have all the sins of his father his mother his grandparents all of the generations before him of humanity is going to be passed down into his DNA that's right being born in a Minister's home doesn't give you any difference than anybody elseu being born in a certain belief doesn't give you any difference than anybody elseu the scriptures tells us that you must be born again amen you must be born again and so when you're you know when you're born in this life nobody has to have a class on teaching you how to lie nobody has to have a class on teaching you how to think the wrong thoughts or even say the wrong words nobody has to teach you how to do the wrong things in life it comes in your sinful nature that you're born with now we know that that kind of Flesh or that kind of a spirit cannot inherit the kingdom of God that's right because you are here what you will be somewhere else a liar here is a liar there an adulter here is an adulter there so there has to be a break in the chain now whether you realize or not everyone of us were born stinkers every one of us were born stinkers there was a lot of things that were cute about us when we were little children but sometimes those cute little things became our weaknesses now you know sometimes I know we've got some uh new Christians Among Us and brother Dylan you'll enjoy this this Parts it's things that you remember you look like the same guy that used to drink and do the ugly things of life you look exactly like that guy as a matter of fact you have the same address as that guy had this body and and you you look the same you you you kind of you go through life the same but there's a new king that comes on your heart now let me let me just say this for for a real Christian you don't have to make yourself do anything so many times people will say well you know if I you know if I become a Christian I'm going to lose so much well you just don't know how much you're going to gain now let's just say if you were a smoker you're you're no doubt going to lose that that part of cancer that you would have got oh yeah if you were a drunker uh no doubt your your liver going to be better off so you're going to lose that and and you're going to you're going to gain some brain cells and you're going to need them you're going to need them and you're probably going to have a a better marriage are you with me you know I am always interested in always this always tickles me just a little bit you know when we become Christians then we we find out that we go to church and then God ask us to to give back 10% of our earnings and you know at first the enemy will just tell you you know uh that's so selfish that's so ugly and you know uh why should you have to work and then give back your money what you don't realize that the devil before when he was the king of the heart he took way more than 10% and I've looked back in my life life and I've never found the dividends that came on top of the 10% and so and so you see you you I you know you're standing in a grocery store and all of a sudden somebody's buying uh just just a couple days ago I was standing and and I was needing some sugar so Matthew dropped me at 711 and and there was a guy buying some he was buying some uh some cigarettes and and some chew and and he spent about 30 bucks and I thought man man that's a slave driver that'll take 30 bucks just for that and I I was standing there with a Hershey bar and a and a Cocola and and it rang up $33.19 for the Hershey bar and I said no I I don't believe I need that as bad as I thought I did I'll just take the Coke and down it real quick but but when life you begin to realize that God pays dividends than Lord on top of it all what happens to our sin what happens to those things that were taken that was in our lives what took place well where did they go brother Brandon would explain it like this it's kind of like a drop of ink that's right and and and that color that was there that it's dropped into a bleach and it becomes so broken down you can't tell the difference between what is bleach and what is ink even God cannot find our sins today because it has been dropped in the most precious thing that there's ever been the blood of the Lamb of calvary our Lord Jesus Christ I want you to just think of the power of a drop of ink one drop of ink can sign your death warrant amen it can send you to the electric chair pretty powerful isn't it or one drop of ink can pardon you from all of your sins oh don't you love the Lord right there now notice this one that comes on the inside of you he's greater than every Power in the whole world he said what is in you he said he's greater it's Christ the anointed one God that was in Christ is now inside of you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen I love you that don't you he said then if he is in you it's not you anymore living it's him living on the inside of you he said what do you think about this what do you think about that then if he is in you he absolutely will not deny what he said he couldn't do it he says but he would keep what he said and he is trying to find a person that he can vindicate at himself through Isaiah 55 and verse 6 it said seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God and he will abundantly pardon Lord notice these next words for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way sayeth the Lord for as as as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts brother Ron and I you want to know what I think about that not necessarily but I want to I want to know what God thinks about it amen the scripture and I in Psalms chapter 46 and verse one God is our refuge yes and strength oppressing help in trouble 119 and verse 59 Psalms I thought on my ways and turn my feet to thy testimonies I want you to understand God finds his children in trouble sometimes you're a new convert you're walking in and you go brother Ron nobody's ever been in trouble before all of a sudden you're sitting with 250 other people that's been where you're sitting all of us have been in trouble before generally that's the way God finds his kids in trouble why would it be like that because as long as you're in sin listen let's just say it sin is pleasurable for a season but then God starts knocking on your heart he starts knocking on your heart and he begins to turn the wheels of your life cuz he's got a bigger plan are you with me now if it wasn't for God you would live 60 70 years and you'd go by the the way of the grave and couple Generations later you're totally for forgotten if you live to the sin that's the way it'll be but just think you can go to a graveyard maybe where Paul's buried or irenius is buried or Columba I've been there Columbus's buried let me just say there's no doubt millionaires that were there quite rich people but if they didn't have God what you're looking at is a grave that was the end of their life and they'll spend through the eternities paying for the sin that they enjoyed for a season are you with me now but I want you to understand if you're a Christian whether it's a thousand years ago or 2,000 years ago you're raised up out of that grave and live to live an eternal life with Jesus Christ L the scripture says that he that cometh to me in no wise will I cast him out we understand that no man can come to God except God draws him I find it amazing that two people can sit in the same service and one gets quick to the spirit of God and the other one is bored out of their mind yeah are you with me I found people that were here maybe you're here today that literally you were getting ready to walk out of the service and said I'll never go back there again but when you turned and walked out you found yourself at the altar because God wouldn't let you go I'm thankful brother Roger I'm thankful that he overrode my own Ambitions I'm thankful that he overrode my thoughts of life and Quicken me and in spite of myself in spite of myself he loved me are you with me I know you're trying to find some people unlovable oh yeah you've met a few of those in your life but there was a time that no doubt you was unlovable and yet in spite of your condition of being unlovable God loved you brother Gabriel is doing some some video work he did it with brother George and then he he's did it with brother Shannon and he's did it for brother Dylan he's done with some of the others I love to hear the testimonies amen the testimonies of the journey that they were on but God rich in mercy God rich in Mercy turned us around how much blood did it take the same amount of blood for someone that sits in church and has never went out there listen for the scripture said all have sinned and come short of the glory of God are you with me that keeps us all from having a stuffed shirt notice Jesus tells Simon the lead disciple I have prayed for you I have prayed for you that thy faith fail thee not Satan has a desire that he can shift you like wheat amen he desires he has an ambition that he could destroy you but I prayed for you listen listen let me just say that can be your scripture Satan has a desire to destroy you he comes to kill to steal and destroy he's nobody that you want to negotiate with yet he will paint pictures that the grass is greener on the other side he will make sin look so alluring the maral barel guy with his cowboy hat looking like a real man sitting on a horse look like a real man he don't show you cancer he'll show you the the mountain Waters of Colorado going into your core's beer and don't tell you there coming out of the water right up here of the shanoa valley somewhere they forget that in their commercials David conquered many wars I love last night because it goes today he conquered many wars he conquered many enemies but he couldn't conquer himself amen he wanted to build God a tabernacle but because of blood that he had shed even innocent blood God would refused him think about this God that had fellip with him God that had gave him incredible victories would not allow him to build the temple he saved it that Solomon would build build that Temple that's right but let me just say this to you David so wanted the life of God to live in side of him notice he would write the Commandments and put it on his head tied into his into his into his hair he wanted and made vows but he couldn't make it live he can make vows he could make promises he could make all kind of Oaths but Le on the inside of him he had a sinful nature listen you can join 42 churches you can sign hundreds of books but until Christ come on your [Applause] heart David desired he wrote the songs about the presence of God and he longed that which he lacked he longed to have his life living inside of him oh yes Samson what a man that he could have been if he had the Holy Ghost in his life amen God chose him sure he did he chose David a murderer right a murderer now let me just say say this to you tonight God knew your sin before you ever committed them let's just let's just think real deep about this Blood God knew your sins your mistakes your failures before you ever did it well brother Ronda what's big about that he still called you thank Lord he still called you he still called you listen go ahead and say it he still called me the things that you wrestle about with your weaknesses and your failures God already knows it he already knows it but he's got a blood thank you Lord he's got a blood that'll take care of that are you with me now notice this you can sacrifice they'd all brought all kinds of blood of bulls and goats that during David's days and the Lambs and the turtle does they'd bring it to the priest and the blood would sprinkle back upon the believer the oncom and it would only cover him it wouldn't change his life it would only cover him and it would cover him for a year but this Holy Ghost this holy ghost that comes on a Believer it seals you till the day of [Applause] redemption now not notice this just before I get too far here I want you to understand in the three stages of the journey it's repentance that's right it is worth that you turn away from your sinful ways right it's to where that you make a decision you make the decision I'm not walking this way no more now this isn't something your parents can do for you this isn't something your favorite preacher can do for you this is something that you've got to do you got to ask God to forgive you you got to wave the white white flag of repentance and surrender I Surrender I'm tired of living with the Hogs I'm tired of living with the pigs I'm tired of being a slave I'm tired of this vessel going through all the ups and downs of sin I'm done now let me just say this you repentance is not like a credit card to where you get $25,000 paid off for you and then gives you a license to go put $25,000 more on it I I didn't do that just as well as I should have none of us can pay off a $25,000 credit card if you just pay the bare minimum you'll never pay it off understand that don't spend this good Finance don't spend anything that you can't pay off in 30 days well brother Ron I I got to get I got to get a credit score get you a gas card it's the best thing that you can you can get build your credit score up get your gas card and you put your gas in you use a card and when you get the B bill pay it all that's right I got Bankers here I've been in business all my life I started at 13 years old in a business in a produce business Hey listen I understand business but I also understand God Amen it's kind of like a fell said he'd been coming to church for a while and you know he had done real good and so they got the missing the ne that that one weekend and they asked him said the next weekend when he came back he said where was you last week he said you know he said i' I've been I've been serving God real hard I've been serving hard God real hard and I was just wore out and I went out and got drunk last week well that ain't how this works that ain't how this works folks we're not going back now brother Ron I don't know if I could sit in church with Sinners okay let me take you on a journey our leader was a homeless man yet he owned it all our leader was the greatest preacher that ever lived in his congregation his lead disciple when he would go and get him and tell him come follow he was naked on a boat screaming obscenities and Jesus in spite of himself picked him and said come follow me Tax Collectors were not only hated now but they were hated then it's true church it's true church Jesus of all people picked a tax collector amen yeah he did he picked a phys didn't say nothing about a physician brother Ron I I don't want to go to church with Hypocrites come on it didn't stop you from going to Walmart brother Ron I knew them before I knew them before that they were Christians and they were rotten they were stinkers I I know things about them that that nobody else knows and you know it just disqualifies them to the nth degree well do you know more than God God knowed all that and he said in spite of it in spite of it in spite of it now d here's the deal I'm going to make it real personal for you today your past life is over amen it's history there will be people that walk up to you and say Dylan remember when we had the big times come on remember when we did all of those things remember all of this and you go I I want to tell you something the dealing you know is dead [Music] he's dead I had a friend of mine come and Andrew was buying a Mustang and car friend of mine had been a buddy for for many years and he came he wanted to you've heard me tell this story before but he wanted to talk about the old times and so we went to McDonald's and we we sat there and and uh we sat and he talked to me for about maybe an hour and he was talking about all the old times these boys had never heard n none of the things that they were hearing there that day and so it come kind of to he could he could kind of tell that it wasn't exactly Landing well and you know he drove two hours I I felt like giving him whatever he wanted to say and he you know he come to a spot and he said yeah you remember those things and I said yeah I do I I shamefully do I said but Eddie I want to tell you something the run that you knew is deaden really I said yeah as a matter of fact we buried it yeah come on come on and there was a king that was on his heart that lived when you was around I know this is simple but I'm going there yeah the king that was here that lived here when when you were around that King died and there was a new king called Jesus came inside of this heart and this vessel had to repent and I and I had to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then I became a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost now I want you to understand I want you to understand something simple God will not live in a contaminated vessel where people have so many problems is trying to live two lives at the same time you ever heard of trying to live on the fence really there's no fence you're just blurring the lines are you with me now yeah listen let me let me just say this you the reason that you can live two different lives is because the king of the Heart Is Not Jesus are you with me now listen Hollywood is full of Oscar winners but the church has got way more Oscar winners than Hollywood ever tired to have come on church we need to take the artificial off I like real that's now let me just tell you something about being real you're real on Sunday you're real on Monday you're real on Tuesday you're getting the picture you're real you don't ever have to put on an act you're real well uh well I I'm different around some people no you're real thank you Lord let me just give you a couple for instances here I get off an airplane and I'm and I'm uh in a suit cuz I preached and now I got on the airplane and I get off the airplane in Atlanta and I walk up I I I walk up the steps I come right up to the to the big big room and there's just hundreds and hundreds of people are there and there's a guy named Tommy Bowen he's there and he's one of the coaches I think from Florida Florida State at that time and he walked up and said how you doing I I just shook his hand I just stood there and shook his hand and we talked a little bit now I knew who he was but he was guessing who I was and here come along an ESPN reporter and he's in a suit and he comes up and shakes Tommy balon's hand and then he shakes my hand I know who these guys are but they don't know who I am and after a few minutes I dismissed myself and I went on my way and I I knew that somewhere down the road they were thinking who is he on brother I was in Starbucks same airport it was late one night going overseas and I was standing and it was my first realization that Starbucks coffee was $5 to sell $ for a small cup of coffee and it was a lady that was standing beside of me and she had a guard that was with her and and and she said isn't it ridiculous what they charge for coffee and I said well boy i' sure like to have some of Mama's coffee right now and I looked over and I was standing talking to Tina Turner she could afford the coffee yeah come on this lives no matter who you're around it lives no matter who you're around are you with me now whether it's a politician it lives come on Church it lives no matter if it's your boss that's right it lives now n none of us would drink out of a dirty cup a filthy filthy cup none of us would want to drink out of it amen it first must be sterilized right amen it must be washed it must be cleaned am I on the same page am I echoing all through the building I know I got a bunch of germaphobes sitting here in the building and not going to point none of you out Katie but I know that listen you know you're a germaphobe when you take your own sheets and your own pillows and your own pillowcases and your own towels to a hotel I think as Christians we ought to be germaphobes I don't want none Satan sins on top of [Applause] me I'm okay with cleanliness let me just say that to you I'm okay with it I drop a egg at my house I eat it cuz that baby's clean down there but God will not live in a dirty vessel God won't bring his life to you and come and live on the inside of you as long long as you're filthy right amen now just think about this this just make good sense I'm not getting I'm not going fast I'm not I'm I'm not going to get done but just think about this when we get to heaven there's not going to be any murderers there so God had to do something with them there's not going to be any Liars [Applause] there kind of like the story of a politician made it to Heaven he arrived with a preacher they go through the gate the Angel's taking them through heaven and shows the preacher his house it's a it's a nice Cottage said this is where you'll live for eternity bless your life he took the politician up the road it was a castle rollsroyce is out front Angel standing guard said wow it seems kind of unfair you know here I am and the preacher got a little old Cottage and I'm living in a in a castle said well you're the first one of your kind that's made it to heaven and we think we better take care of you get it today get it tomorrow you may never get it Hallelujah so what happens to those old sins Dylan God's got to clear it he's got to clear it out of your life brother Joel oh but you don't know the old Joel I don't need to know the old Joel I don't need to know the old oh God God took care of that and it clears the deed how many's ever bought a piece of property you want to clear deed to go with that that's right because you can get a you can get a deed and get it signed but if it's got debts against it where somebody worked and they didn't get paid and they put a lean on the property that means that you're still liable for the account that's the reason you want a clear [Applause] deed God clears your deed he clears it up to where there's no more misunderstandings you say well brother Ron why is that so important amen we have an accuser of the Brethren absolutely and he's constantly telling you of your past he's constantly telling you even your thoughts he's constantly in your ear telling you all kind of bad things but he is the accuser of the bre and he's good at it but God's done a tital search on [Applause] you he's cleared the Deep are you with me first sealed the breach you can go through there and studied it all he's cleared the deed there's no more remembrance of sin the old nature is done and you become a new creature I need another example brother Ron Brother Randy none of us would like to be called a worm amen I think worms are disgusting only unless we're fishing I may make this crowd mad but I'm gonna tell them something every one of you were a worm every one of you I'm sorry crawl on the ground dir in your eyes yes your feet was swabbing like this but God didn't want to leave you as a worm or a caterpillar amen so he's got a process that he sends you through Gabriel and when he sends you through the process it's a cocoon that is formed and when the Cocoon is formed then after a process of time a transformation happens on the inside of that c cocoon and that cocoon begins to bust and it begins to crack and a butterly comes out of that now imagine imagine this you're a witness let me give a better example Abraham has been telling you that God's going to give you a son but you know as 100 years old you can never have that child Sarah's 90 years old brother meta is the only one who qualifies in the church to being kind of in that age bracket and he's not interested in having children somebody tell him tomorrow don't tell him now don't tell him now I find it absolutely amazing with brother metas amen he can't find the car that he came to church in but last night he was quoting quotes in front of Andrew now just think about this if you're a witness and you're watching Abraham he's given this testimony you've been his buddy for 25 years and and he's he's been talking about I met God I I met God he's my shield he's my buckler he's my strength he's actually changed my name I'm not going to go by Abram anymore I'm going to go by Abraham God changed my name oh yeah I bet he did yeah yeah he did he changed my name from now on you call me Abraham so he told all of his friends you call me Abraham as a matter of fact the other day God came to the house really oh Hallelujah yeah God came to the house the other day Sarah was in the back of the tent and she was laughing because he was telling her that she was going to have a child and and he actually asked her is there anything too hard for the Lord and he said Sarah the way you spell your name that's a dominating female but let me change your name to where you're a princess I'm going to put h on the end of your name amen I'm going to put my own life on the inside of your name now you can meet the challenge of the hour amen the same critical friend has been with you all the time but maybe he lives on the same street on the day your body becomes young and want you don't realize youve went into the Cocoon of God's promises and all of a sudden you begin to walk out you used to be a real stinker but God's rich in Mercy you used to be real ugly in your life but God knows how to fix you thank you Lord now that friend has to go tell somebody else you know what happened to Abraham I don't know what happened man that guy's young I was talking to a man that was a a 12-year Bible student he was a pastor of a Baptist Church he was a friend of mine I said Mark what happened in the scriptures what happened in the scriptures to Abraham and Sarah that is so phenomenal he said yeah I know what happened I said said okay he said two of the oldest people have a boy I said that's pretty incredible I said have you ever read where he goes down to Greer he gets out of the will of the Lord and he goes to Greer and these two old people the king of that country finds her to be the most beautiful woman in the world amen I said I never looked at it quite like that I said none of us did until the seals and God was showing us that there was going to be a bride that was going to get a change of the body he's not going to leave us grhe headed I find it phenomenal that Satan has a great big list of all your mistakes even yours has a great big list of all your mistakes and it brings it before God and before he can get to God you go father forgive me of my sins forgive me of even the thoughts that I that I think forgive me of my wrong attitudes yeah I'm talking to you in the green Church raise your hand I mean a guy like you don't look like a guy like that with sin does it but he's a human and all humans come short no matter if you come to church every week every year you got a scripture for that Paul said I Die daily Paul the messenger of the hour says I Die daily and you ask God to forgive you you don't feel lightened you don't hear thunder you feel no angels in the room but you being a Son of God ask God the faithful high priest to forgive you of your sins and in a moment it's gone it's kind of unfair to the devil he goes up there with a great big list and it's all gone I think that's phenomenal brother Ron preach me something really deep I really am now what if we couldn't have the Holy Ghost amen we'd live in haunted houses haunted by our past living in the realm of regret that's right we really would how many's ever been in a haunted house well there's some honest ones here today I lived in one I lived in one I knew what was right and I couldn't do it in my condition so I was haunted where I lived at listen this is more than Barney F in a haunted house where doors are screeching and windows are wrinkling and and the roof is falling off listen a lot of people live with Spooks I'm coming now I'm coming down the Avenue I'm coming a lot of people live with Spooks let me just say this you to live with your own Pride is a spooky Spirit it comes right straight from Lucifer Pride will keep you from getting right with God that's right Pride human Pride will keep you from getting right with God because it will justify you in your sins well I'm not as bad as the other guy listen we're not here comparing oursel with one another listen I don't want to stand at the Judgment bar and say well somebody at the church was doing the same thing I was doing so I thought it would be okay don't hang your soul over an excuse Romans 8 I just read it to you and I'll finish at this point and pick it up next week Romans chapter 8 says there is therefore now no condemnation condemnation is something that will constantly beat you like a slave let me give you an example the devil will talk you into Robin bank and then he'll call a law you'll find yourself on the wrong website you're young you're checking things out and all of a sudden you're on the wrong website I took my glasses off cuz I can't see you you're on the wrong website and all of a sudden the devil that has led you there now condemns you for it if your mama only knew if your daddy only knew the preacher only [Music] knew are you with me now the enemy the accuser of the Brethren will lead you into all that nonsense brother random would talk about another one called a uh he talk about another one to where that you can't forgive yourself listen if you can't forgive yourself you'll have trouble forgiving others are you with me if you can't forgive yourself but as a matter of fact let me flip that around for you if you can't forgive others neither can God forgive you I would hate to come to the end of the road and have excuses for doing a lot of things to serve God because I couldn't forgive myself of little stumbles in my life I want to come back to it here brother brandom is going to be the messenger of the age he's going to be the messenger not up for debate it's going to be the messenger the first time that God speaks to him he is carrying water to his father's whiskey steel he's six years old of course he don't know all the ramifications of what he's doing the presence of God comes down in brother Vernon whirls in the in the trees and begins to speak out of that tree never drink Never Smoke defile your body I've got a work for you to do real simple God didn't come down and condemn him for carrying water to the steel he knew what was sitting on your table when I came to see you he knows where you're at and he's not ashamed Connie I think it's so phenomenal he went to a Pharisees house not to be entertained by Pharisees but there was a woman that was come amen sir that had a history amen amen Tracy she had a history that none of the church would have wanted she was a prostitute and Jesus knew that she was coming and she sold her very best that's right to get the ointment that was way costly amen and she finds herself at Jesus's feet washing his feet and anointing his feet with that with that perfume and drying his feet from the tears with her he knew but he's not going to leave her where he left herall brother Josh he don't leave you where he found you at brother Roger you may have been a stinker yes you was but he didn't leave you where he found you he didn't say that's the rest of the story he picked you up and when there's no more town called Gros when there's no more millionaires in the state of Virginia you'll still be a son of God [Applause] let me just say this to you I'm GNA borrow this from Timothy puit and end it with this The Burning Bush was a light that brought change it was a light that brought change you heard it when he preached here on on Friday night of our Labor Day meeting and he was talking about how that when you come into His presence that light takes care of all the darkness that is on the inside of you literally let me just say this to you when you walk to an altar whether the enemy wants to know it or not you bring your enemy to the place that he's going to die at you literally walked your slave master right to the Altar and that's the place to where he dies on the inside of your life and you can say it's over it's over it's over let me let me just preface with this once he's dead his effect is over hallu his addiction is over his desire is over and once Jesus lives there his effect is always with you amen and when you do something a little bit wrong he's quick to kind of nudge you and you know it's not right and you go I'm sorry Lord forgive me I did not mean to hurt your feelings brother Ron do you mean to tell me that Christians have to repent I sure do I I I sure do Christians 50 60 years in the walk still have to repent I don't believe that right there's a good of guy has ever lived he owns a heat and air business and I and I say that he's as good a guy as ever lived he's got a wonderful nature and God give him an angel to marry send me a send me a check brother Chris but in spite of that you go to customers homes and you're not working on angels and sometimes they talk very nasty to you and you go Lord forgive me for what I'm thinking right now I thank you that that person doesn't have discernment at this very point now here's a guy that good as ever lived and I could talk call you out we still need God don't you love him let's stand to our feet I I'm not done but we we'll quit Dylan did that help amen thank you Lord how many railroad people do we have in the church yeah there we go need to tell you some stories there we go right here's the guy come come up here oh you can play that later matter of fact you finish the sermon and I'll play it [Laughter] no now you gave me that what is that for it's a seal so when they pack a a container before that container can be Shi you got to make sure it's absolutely right they'll put the lock in the hasp after they're done and put this in the lock and then that'll press in and it locks up where you got to destroy it to get it off yeah yeah so it's seal for its Journey yeah and that seal has a an indentification number with it doesn't it has to be recorded it's recorded and if someone break the seal it's a federal crime yeah I know it cuz I used to put seals on so brother Greg is are we still alive brother Greg gave me a couple of these seals cuz I've been preaching on the Seal of the Holy Ghost now you don't seal a a box car that hasn't been packed right amen because it's going to go through some bumpy spots I know you guys do a phenomenal job on the railroad but I hunt right beside the railroad they need to work on that section I'll tell you that and they don't need to blow the horn as much as they've been blowing it can I can I put in a complaint that's federal law they have to he's quoting law up here to me but before that that box car can leave the station everything's got to be packed up right cuz it's going to go across that bumpy Railroad and there's going to be ups and downs and ups and downs and ups and downs and listen God knows that you need the seal on you and the inspector's got to check you not the preacher we're not living up to specifications of the preacher we're living up the specifications of the Holy Ghost and God won't live in you and put a seal on you until he's living on the inside of you and if he's living on the inside of you he knows that you'll make it for the journey Hallelujah sure will we'll make it yeah so he's not having to ask will I make it if I'll make it I hope I can make it through the Seal's already applied the Seal's already applied and listen God has said he's going to make it and everything that he needs is in the Holy Ghost that'll put him in the Rapture put him in the resurrection Give the Lord a good hand God bless you brother [Applause] gr isn't he wonderful Amen brother Hunter your family thank you guys for coming and being with us today been a joy to be with you I've saw you smiling as the sermon went forth and so I know it didn't make you mad so we love you with all of our hearts and
