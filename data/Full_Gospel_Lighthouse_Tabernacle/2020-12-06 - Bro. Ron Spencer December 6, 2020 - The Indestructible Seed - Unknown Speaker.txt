========================================

[Music] so [Music] i've got a little slogan that i'll say it quite a bit it might be good for you to take it a winner never quits and a quitter never wins just think of it a winner never quits and a quitter can't win you must hold on and before you even start be dead sure you're right and then be persistent let nothing move you go on i've had quite a bit of experience of that and you know what i know this one thing when you're dead sure that you're in the will of god when you're dead sure you're centered in calvary nothing's going to move you you're there this little woman she was a greek and a serpeology and she had heard about the fame of jesus how does faith come by hearing hearing of the word she had heard of him and you know she might have had a lot of things to hinder by her being a greek faith cometh by hearing we know that and she had a a lot of things to hinder her but faith finds a source no other knows anything about faith finds this source that no one can explain it it's something that you know others can't see it but faith sees it faith sees that where the natural eye doesn't see it but the inside eye sees that thing now she had a need of jesus she first thing you have to do if you're going to find christ you've got to know that you've got a need of him when you think that you just don't need him then you'll never find him because you won't search him diligently did you notice that scripture where it says seek and you shall find knock and it'll be open actually that's just not knock like it'll be open e that's not you say well i went out lord here i am you want me no that's not it he that seeketh he that knocketh continuation it has to compare with the rest of scripture like the unjust judge and the widow she constantly knocked on his door she was persistent if he turned her away today to marshes on his hands again that's the way you want to get god be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking just don't knock a little while get tired and go away just keep standing there god i'm here and i'm not going to leave i'm on your hands now i'm going to stay right

to be in the house of the lord this morning to be serving jesus somebody praise the lord this morning if you if you missed the announcement last evening we want to make this aware to you um you know every year we have a christmas dinner for our church family and this year uh because of covet issues and regulations and and us renovating our fellowship hall and it's not at adequate size as of yet but we're working on that and it'll be there by the time probably by the time we get done with covert we'll be able to have uh have a dinner in this fellowship hall that we're creating for you and and we don't know how much longer we're going to be here but we're creating a place where our young people can can they can they can join together us as we can sit down and relax and actually have room to stretch out a little bit and and expand i believe god's i believe god's doing some big things i'm thankful for our church family and thankful for your giving thank you for your tithes and your offerings we're thankful for what god is doing and we're doing what the bible has said and we're compelling them to come and we're seeing our church grow and and mass multitudes that that maybe not even be sitting here but is sitting on that side of the screen and and supporting this church and we say god bless you for all of those things but uh in doing that we had a burden on our heart to to do a christmas dinner as we had in the pastimes but this time we're going to be doing it a little bit different on sunday december the 20th at 3 30 after service that morning we'll be having service that morning on december the 20th at 11 o'clock for for the sunday morning group and then at 3 30 we would like the whole church we have we have reserved the whole traditions restaurant that's for full gospel lighthouse tabernacle people that that attend regularly and you can look around and you can see who sat beside you on sunday and who sits beside you on saturday if they show up and they have not been sitting here for the past year you can tell them they didn't have their token amen amen it's okay it's okay i've given you permission if if they have not attended if they've not been a part of this this church for the past couple years or and they want to show up just to eat our chicken well you say it ain't your chicken well i'm we're buying it for you and if you're not good enough to come eat this seven course minion don't eat my chicken [Applause] so brother brother ron made a very good statement you know when we have dinner we don't invite everybody on 309 pine creek lane we don't invite everybody up there to come eat with us it's for our household it ain't for everybody else that lives down the lane this is for full gospel lighthouse this is not a meal where we're wanting to go out and save the lost by offering them a hot dog and a free meal and a little track they'll come jesus said the only reason that you're following me is for the bread and the loaves and i told somebody the other day i said we don't even have to produce a miracle when people still come to the meal but jesus produced a miracle because they wanted to see more miracles and just get fed amen this is for you that have become a miracle so it will be a social distance meal just our church family will be there and this is this is no cost to you for our appreciation to you our love to you and uh so if you can if you can please come uh please text sister connie or sister katie by december the 15th this is the date december the 20th is the date that they could do for us and we know that everybody's busy at that time maybe have different meals and whatnot but uh we we would like every one of you that that attend here and have made this your priority to be here through through coven to be in these services now i know that there's a lot of people that are listening in the community but you are the people that have sacrificed your time your monies your energies and put yourself at risk just to come to worship him this meal is appreciation for you and we just want to we just want to extend an appreciation to you and say that we love you with all of our hearts and we'd like to do that this christmas season i love christmas i know there's a lot of people that get upset about it but i sure enjoy christmas and if you don't want the presents send them my way it don't offend me to open up on the inside and find out what's in there do you love the lord this morning are you ready for the word now we ain't been able to hear from our pastor this will be this will be today would be two and a half weeks since we've been able three weeks since we've heard from our pastor satan's done his best he even did his best last night to keep him from being in this service today to preach from you sugar dropped from 500 all the way to 54 close to coma state but i just want to thank the lord this morning that our pastor has a perseverance on the inside of his soul to be able to come and stand behind this pulpit and satan ain't got enough to stop it [Applause] amen amen let's stand this morning sing that song at the foot of the crossing from a distance and they could not take their eyes from you we were bleeding they were weeping faithful sisters they had followed you they did not understand who they could not see they were mourning their loss and as the sky turned black and the earth the cross he was standing near your mother they were so close they could hear you sigh all around them angry voices here's the darkness and you were dying but they would not leave who they lingered there no matter [Music] they were praying at the foot of the cross who keep me near the cross oh near the cross may i never stray so far oh that i cannot see what flowed down for me at the foot of the cross now i'm standing in your presence and i cannot take my eyes from you [Music] [Music] no i'm not looking back oh i've heard your voice and i'm staying here i've made my choice now it's really [Music] who keep me near the cross may i never shrink so far that i cannot see [Music] oh keep me near the cross near the cross may i never stray so far oh that i cannot see [Music] near the cross may i never stray so far that i cannot see [Music] [Music] god bless you amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning isn't it amen god bless you god bless you brother johnny's family and i want you at the dinner amen amen amen we are so happy to have them with us each and every one of you so glad to see you in the house of the lord this morning and we so love you with all of our hearts and and thank you for your prayers for us you know when satan fights you know that there's something good on the way and he's a good fighter amen and so we just we just we just are we're just moving on we're just pressing forward and amen i know each and every one of us have a different battle that we have to fight in life and and so happens we're in this fight uh never thought we'd be here but we're in this fight and and it just seems like that during the night that i it seems like that sometimes i have some real lows as far as sugar and uh it's happened to me a few times and last night i was having a dream and it was a nightmare and i couldn't get out of it and i knew something was wrong and i shook myself to wake and and then i was it was still going on and i knew something was what was going on and so i ran to check my sugar and sure enough we got a battle on our hands for a couple of hours and i figured well he'll battle me tonight and i'll battle him tomorrow amen we send greetings to many people this morning and we brother george quinn always is watching and many people are watching brother tim pruitt was watching last night he sent me a little note after i made that comment about him preaching long and he wants to come to the dinner amen i got a note this morning from brother david mayer and in switzerland and france and that that they're watching today and of course they watch every service and so we certainly do appreciate brother david brother david is kind of like brother johnny he's an interpreter for me many through 10 years of work in switzerland at the conventions and and one time i was preaching and i just turned and i said don't don't interpret this and i and i just told him god's called you to preach and it was quite a special moment and then later we would be able to watch him grow in the ministry has a wonderful church there in france and for the people that are watching in europe if you're close enough to brother david please go visit him and and he's an awesome preacher and i love the way he says amen amen amen hey man it's good just a real wonderful family we greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ and love you with all of our hearts the other day uh well the other day sometimes as you get older the other days eight months ago but brother wayne lawson was was preaching and and i had prayed for his daughter-in-law who had trouble having a baby and i i and he came over to me and he just made a statement to me and i said and you'll send me a picture of that baby well here we are amen amen i'd like to speak to you this morning on the indestructible seed yeah i don't know if i'll get done but i'll try to get started amen god bless you if you will turn with me to revelations chapter 21 revelations chapter 21 and we we love you with all of our hearts we look forward to eating with you i look forward to the time when our where our whole church is back together again and so we're making some plans with the fellowship hall and that's already in action and so they're telling us our building needs to be a little bigger to accommodate everybody so we're making that an action so uh if things start happening around here you're and you get kind of well wow a lot of things happen around i want to have you together as a whole body and so we're looking to put a wing on the on the building here and to get that uh done and you say well who's going to pay for it god yeah god's got a great big pocketbook and so we'll get all that taken care of don't you worry don't get excited so amen amen revelations 21 and verse 1 now this is not just something that god is just making a mystic thought or it might happen this is going to happen this is going to happen and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away i'd like for us to read that scripture together and i want you to remind mr troubler that has troubled your life there's a day when you're you're done can we read it together and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he said unto and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and i'm included in that hallelujah and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end and i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of water of life freely and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and they will be my people amen amen and he shall be my son amen saint john chapter 1 and verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not i want to read one more scripture this morning before we before we take our seats in jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 4 and i want to wait i want to wait till it's up on the screen if we can do that or here quick the word of the lord came unto me saying before i form thee in the belly i knew thee before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee you can be seated regardless of which aisle the politics that you stand this morning i want you to kind of begin to get a grips that we understand that there's coming a new world [Applause] things are not going to always be as they are now jesus said this 2000 years ago and we are at the time of the coming of the end of the gentile dispensation we can see that we're at the end of this we you can't vote your way out of the problems of life uh there's many things that we could say right there but there's coming a new world jesus made a statement to his very close disciples let not your heart be troubled and he began to tell him of a of another realm to where that i go to prepare a place for you now i i was just reading i was reading this week in my my morning devotions and it was there was just a little a little piece that was there when you die you're going to a place you're going to a place it's not an illusion it's not some man's figment of imagination god has prepared a place for us are you with me now there'll be no more sorrow no more tears no more agony he's the he's got a place for us set aside and it's a brother branham would use the term future home now this home is a very temporary home regardless of the size that you live in from small to large it's only temporary are you with me but let me just say even our bodies are temporary are you with me but if we could just think maybe we look at our birthdays and we celebrate our birthdays and we mark the years on the calendar and especially as you get older you're thankful to see another birthday and i was very happy to see a birthday this year and i i trust i can see another one and and i was asked the other day how long do you want to live well that's a kind of an open end conversation we'd like to know how to treat you how long you want to live well they're they're saying we can only extend your life bo well i got a book here that has a cure now there was a time that i was in my father and there was a time that i was in my grandfather and there was a time that i was in my great-grandfather i'm not going to go too much longer and i was time i was in my great-great-grandfather there was a time that i was in adam and there was a time that i was in god and god thought of us before the foundation of the world and that seed is what makes us eternal with god now we have an enemy and that enemy is lucifer and lucifer is the anti-type of god god built him god created his own enemy he is the opposite of god he's the opposite of love love in many forms he's the opposite of all of that he is the opposite of light are you with me he's the very opposite of it he is the opposite of faith he's the very opposite of all of that as a matter of fact god built an enemy to which that knows and can read the book the same as you and i and finds that he will come to a point he's no more but yet he can fight like he's got eternal life but you and i can read the book and we were in the beginning and we were before the beginning and we were in the mind of god i knew you before you were even formed in the womb jacob and esau he knew which one you with me he knew what you would be he predestinated you when before the foundation of the world remember you're dealing with an infinite god and so when the devil tells you you're nothing remind him you remind him that god thought of me before the foundation of the world it does not require me to have 15 phd degrees to be a son or daughter of god are you with me it doesn't matter what my natural job is where my natural home is i've got a seed laying on the inside of me oh glory to god we have some students that are watching even now that are that are from japan from different countries from portugal different different places i can't actually even go into it where they're at and they're watching they're watching from colleges and and let me just say god knows how to find you he knows how to go and get you i was preaching in alaska one time and as i was preaching actually in a catholic in a catholic camp and these brothers have rented to camp and come together and i was preaching in this camp and i was just preaching on god knows how to find you god knows how to watch over you god knows how to come and get you and i was going i said you might be a wall from the army and running and thinking nobody knows where you're from or where you're at and you're hiding from everybody but god knows exactly where you're at and there was a man sitting almost a mile away in a green pickup truck and he was awol from the army and he said i might as well go up there and listen to that man god knows where i'm at and what was the interesting thing is that man was from covington virginia and god had me in alaska preaching to find a seed from covent in virginia now let me just think just for a few moments brother brennan brings us a representation we've got farmers here that you already know this but sometimes we need to be reminded but in every seed release let me say it diplomatically in every seed release there's like a million seeds of life that is released into the womb one is predestinated to life one is predestinated to life and that one has got something on the inside of it that will overcome all of the death traps and it will find that seed or that egg and it'll come to life now you think all the way since adam of one seed production 9999 and you can keep saying all the nines they all died but one was predestinated to life all the way to the generations back come on church and god knew what color hair you'd have he knew how tall you'd be he knew what your weight would be like he knew what your nature would be he knew who your father and mother would be all the way through the generations because remember it's in the book it's in the book sister kim said it's in the book god knew you would be sitting here this morning so he has to watch over your seat all the way down your natural seed he has to watch over that an infinite god watches over that natural seed all the way through and here's what i want to say and satan can't stop it now here's what i want to say to you now i know many of you are having great difficulty even in your natural life now but if god could get you here if god could get you here he's more than able to get you there he watched over your your natural seed through through natural disasters through moving from one country to another country through wars through plagues through death camps he literally tried to destroy generations to destroy you he destroyed marriages he destroyed all different kinds of relationships trying to get to destroy you but god that is rich in his mercy [Applause] hallelujah you're better protected than the president of the united states of america [Applause] psalms 91 says that you're encamped about with angels angels are guarding that seed i'd like for you to get your eyes off of your natural flaws i'd like for you to get your eyes off of your natural cockle barrel nature i'd like for you to get your eyes off of your excuses for just enough time to realize it's not your flesh that we're depending on or your feelings or you're up and down relationships of with your even your own self but god is depending on the seed that he deposited on the inside of you that thing that causes you to be driven when you would personally give up god put something on the inside of you that you're driven you're driven and there's no going back there's no quitting hallelujah you're not depending on your brother or your sister or your mother or anybody else you're dependent on god and god's made a promise i'll see you through glory to god there's a nation that almost every nation in the world has turned against and hates who put that hatred there but god chose that nation it's a little bitty nation and they have to fight for their for their identity every day they have to be willing to sacrifice it all every day they know that if they get in a war their enemies is wanting to exterminate them because they've been through it before at isolates they were there listen hitler wanted to extinguish them and destroy them and wipe them off of the face of the earth that's what satan wants to do to god's seed that's why he fights you so hard why do you think he's fighting me so hard why do you think he's fighting me so hard he'd love to he'd love to take my life as i got back in bed last night and i put my head on the pillow i told connie i said it just shows you another time he'd love to take my life but he don't have enough uh god had a conversation with abraham and he had a conversation with him lipped it here and remember god's an eternal god infinite god and he's sitting at a tent you and i don't know what size tent that was it don't matter we don't know maybe even the exact location it don't matter but an infinite god picked up the elements of the earth and blew himself a body and stepped into it now maybe he didn't describe it to all the angels what i'm doing today he didn't have to tell him that but he's going to have a conversation with abraham who is the father of the faith he is the beginning of god race he is a man that god is going to use to be the natural seed of a father of many nations but he's childless it's impossible for him to have children god loves impossibilities and so today melchizedek visits abraham and so in the visiting of abraham he begins to talk to him about seed that would be all right are you with me now seed that would be now let's just say that this is a a family photo album now abraham is here in genesis 15 through about 24 and abraham is is is here in this first photo and he can't see even that he's going to have natural seed but he believes but abra melchizedek is sitting in front of him and he's looking into the eyes of god himself that is the alpha and the omega and god knows the rest of the book and in the rest of the book you're here no kings were sitting there or ambassadors or great orchestras playing it was god and the father of nations who could not produce seed even on his own through sarah but god that was sitting there talking to those talking about those seeds knew that they were on the way and he was not only knowing they were on the way but he was the protector a placing you to be on the way are you with me now now god begins to tell abraham that your seed is going to sojourn in a land in egypt and they're going to go there but after 400 years and he begins to talk to him about how it's going to lay out he talks up to him about sodom and gomorrah how they're going to be destroyed he talks to him about the children going to egypt and i'm going to visit them now now understand this abraham cannot absorb everything that god's staying doing you know sometimes people go well i know all about the bible i know all about god you and your paper ain't mind amen you can't comprehend sometimes what color pants to put on i'm gonna bring you back to reality just for a moment oh i know all about the bible you're a nut you're just a knot if god don't show it to you you're lost you're just you're just you're just going your own way but god rich in mercy so happened to choose that you'd be a part of all of this let me just tell you a children's story there's a boy grew up and as he's growing up he dreams dreams and as he's dreaming dreams he tells his brother said you'll bow down and worship me well that went well and they they sold him off into slavery and he goes over into this strange land and he goes to prison for quite a while and there's a there's a butler and a baker you're getting the story and then this man becomes the the right hand man to pharaoh and his name's going to be joseph because he was in the book he was there when abraham was talking to melchizedek in melchizedek's mind joseph was there i find it interesting that when joseph gets ready to die he said don't you bury my bones down here don't you bury my bones down here in egypt you carry my bones into the promised land are you with me for 400 years there was a lead coffin with with joseph's bones inside of it and you say what's important about that one day jesus will be in the promised land and he'll go to calvary in the land where joseph was was to be buried at because that's where the resurrection was going to take place because it was in the book it gets close to 400 years it's kind of like getting close to the to the gentile end of the gentile dispensation and they knew god was going to do something and two very insignificant by the world standard people amram and joseph bad they're slaves too and they are under great persecution too and great affliction too but only a prophet could look back and see that he would go up in the attic and pray every night and upon one of that one of those meetings he has a visitation with an angel now understand that pharaoh realizes that there's a there's a male child that's coming that's a prophet and he's going to destroy his kingdom and so he begins to have male children destroyed and has the midwives to destroy trying to destroy the seed but remember the seed of god is indestructible [Applause] i wish i had the energy to shout all over this building right now now god's very good in his way he does business you remember as for those that were watching last night a few months ago i or a couple of months ago i went to the eye doctor the cancer eye doctor oncologist cancer eye doctors and and they looked at my eyes and was about four hours of test and then that four hours of tests and all of the pictures and all of the the the the test that they went through they found those two bits of cancer now they think that that's where the cancer started and so they're excited to wear that they think this is the beginning of where it started if they can find the origin that's what they're looking for well that's what satan's doing he's trying to find the origin he'd like to get back into heaven he'd like to take your place he'd really like to take your place so here we are two months later and i'm sitting before another oncologist and he's looking and he's he's ran all the tests and he's looking at this he's got this set of pictures here and my new set of pictures here and he says well i can tell you this what you had here a couple of months ago isn't here i'd like to bring that just a little bit further sometimes there's a screen of your past [Applause] and what you had over here and all of those sins that was in your life and was so literally trying to destroy your life in this new screen of the blood of jesus christ you can look and look and look and you can't find it [Applause] hallelujah so what you once was you're no longer that man nor woman anymore glory and there's nothing satan can do to stop that moses is born do you think that jesus is do you think that jesus is stable was the only place that angels hung out i'm not making light of that there was angels there when you were born because you were a seed of god you were productionated little naked babies screaming crying and the angels of god are watching over that child moses is born almost in secret can i get a drink of water i want being long now how are you going to keep him alive god can god can i want to drink a piece of that just a moment due to cobit i can't give you none of this and god asked his mother to do something very strange i want you to make a bull rush i want you to be a certain way i want you to place the baby in this basket i want you to put it in the crocodile infested water and i want you to push it out of your sight i want you to be very honest right now i want you to be real honest we got mothers sitting all over this building just asked that mother to do something impossible for her humanity but you remember she's got a faith that she can lean back on because her grandfather abraham many generations back was told by god take thy son thy only son and offer him as a sacrifice now you say well brother ron how could abraham do that remember god had set with him at his tent and told him i'm going to give you a seed and you're going to be the father of many nations so abraham realized i'll give him to god and god will raise him right back up because through isaac nations is going to come so i even can't destroy him i can't even destroy him god's asking me to give him to him absolutely he didn't even tell sarah what he was doing but he told those boys at the count at the at the at the animals he told them said i and the lad will return father we have wood we have fire but where's the sacrifice god will provide himself a sacrifice it was that kind of faith that that little mother pushed that baby out in that crocodile infested water now now stay with me over the next few minutes she could not see god say gabriel line up thousands of angels up and down this crocodile-infested waters gabriel you stand on this bush on this basket and every time the crocodile comes up to bite him you push him back down in the water it's not what you see it's what you can't see that is so important in your life it's not what you feel it's what you can't feel that's so important past what you see think past what you think he'll get into whirlpools you get him out of it he'll get into spots you get him out of it and where did he wind up in pharaoh's house brother branham said god has a way he let the enemy train him and send him to school destroyed moses he wasn't going to destroy him but brother ron who's the smallest baby in this building now who's a small do we have a small baby in this building amen why sister connie that's just perfect well bring that baby here now she's got one on her brother i won't take her because she may cry don't you fall come on up here with me hey yeah now this baby can't defend itself is he awake you tell him when he wakes up what happened this baby can't watch over itself it can't do that are you with me but this baby has been protected since adam it's been protected since adam and now god gave it a mother and a father to watch over and protect it but they're not alone in that there's an angel standing there's angels standing even now maybe close to me i think i know what i'm talking about but there's angels watching over here because she's a daughter of god amen thank you thank you i want to just drop a couple more thoughts here and maybe maybe i'll have strength to preach next sunday morning but why why did pharaoh tried to destroy generations he was trying to destroy the seed why did caesar and those men try to destroy generations they were trying to destroy the seed i'm going to bring you into to loop why do we live in a nation that kills over 4 000 babies a day and i don't care how you look at it or where your politics are at it's murder yeah and you can't be a christian vote for that kind of nonsense [Applause] probably get a text over that over the weekend but i don't care i don't care on the judgment day i'm not going to be guilty of voting i'll not be guilty of that i may be guilty a lot of things but i won't be guilty of that but why are they trying to destroy the seed the seed that's what you're trying to do is destroy the seed i like this part now brother joe it's because we're going to rule and reign amen we're going to rule and reign if you remember just only a few moments ago about an hour ago i read about your future home and you're going to walk on streets of goal we're going to be neighbors for eternity we're going to speak the same language i don't know what it'll be don't matter because we're family you ever get the idea sometimes that you you you meet somebody and you go i feel like i've known them all my life you just feel like well you just connect you walk through walmart you never feel that let me just drop something in free of charge and i'm almost done you know you know if you're upset about going traditions they'll be reopening on tuesday and you're welcome to go and if you say well brother ron i'm afraid to come to church and sit on a pew because i'm afraid i'll get something don't you dare go to walmart don't don't you pump gas don't you dare pump gas as a matter of fact don't even handle your own mail isn't it amazing how satan will put a fear on you and he'll have you afraid to come to church he'll have you afraid to come to church where you'll get your healing where you'll have a revival in your life where you'll get renewed hallelujah well brother ron i'm afraid i'll get something yeah i'm afraid i'll get something well they say i got cancer here here here here here and i'm still here i'm not afraid of none of that and it's a whole lot worse than covid but my god's bigger than cancer it's bigger than covet it's bigger than every disease that there is it's bigger than sin [Applause] hallelujah i'm not dependent on my doctors and what they say i believe in that report and it says i'm healed it says i've got a new body if i die tomorrow don't you cry for me i'll have a new body it won't have a gray hair it won't have glasses it won't have aches and pains and false teeth

me amen we're gonna wear a crown wear a crown a bright and shiny crown hallelujah i remember when you came and you was a little boy and and i walked back to the table and i said interpret for me and
