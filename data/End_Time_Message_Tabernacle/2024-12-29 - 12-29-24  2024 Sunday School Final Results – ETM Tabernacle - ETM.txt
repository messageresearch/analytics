Brenham was um um born um the when he was born um the pillow fire from heaven which was God came down to him and when his parents saw that they were scared and all of that but that was God and when bam was 7 years old um he wanted to go fishing but he couldn't because he had to help his dad but the bun was mad when he was coming back with the water hose I mean the water bucket he sat by a tree just being mad and all that but then I a sudden he heard a wind and he looked to the tree and it was God and God said um do not smoke do not drink do not defile your body in any way for I have a mission for you when you grow older but brandham was used to um he was used for um for he was useful to explain the second coming of chist [Applause] yeah anybody else wants to add something sh brother brand but brandom was used to like his name was in the Bible cuz um oh the Bible explains about his uh coming and uh and this story is just about like this story is about his childhood how he grew up and how he had his first Vision when he was three and his second when he was seven just like what Moses said and yeah good job anyone else GL do you want to add something um he had an incident

each and every one of you um it was definitely a lot of material covered this year uh if they can project our exam our exam consists of almost 140 questions and points not uh we had definitions uh we spoke about peer pressure about um um different things that each one faces and different [Music] Lifestyles we spoke about Matthew 24 the signs of the end time and the end time timeline we spoke about leadership and what the prophet says about being led and the message is is your life worthy of the Gospel was one of the main themes this year we spoke about the attributes and how to pray we also mixed a little bit of the sermons that the pastor was preaching we also spoke about the nine spiritual gifts um we also spoke about the we went through the entire Book of Proverbs we spoke about the five Ministries and Psalm [Music] 119 Psalm 119 psalm s NE s and then we also spoke about one of the last things they had to do on the exam was to fill in the timeline from the first church age from the time Christ died through the seven Church ages all the way to Eternity [Music] including the Millennium and all those details so it was a lot it was some said it was hard some said it was easy and so I'm going to give the award for the person who got almost about 80% it was really close so first place goes to Joshua MinGa um coming in closely second place place this person did very well goes to Gabby and third place goes to Faith so which means they were able to fill out all the questions on the test fill in the majority of the [Music] timeline so the others did well some not as great but it's really important to attend all the Sunday School classes to be able to maintain so much information so I have also two more Awards [Music] um these go to my two students actually who got the top to this is just to also say goodbye because this was also their final year in Sunday school Joshua and [Applause] Gabby and then last award this goes to the student who wanted to do so much more gave
