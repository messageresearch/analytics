[Applause] [Music] and we also thank the pastor to give us the opportunity to speak on this Pulpit here amen amen amen amen now we're going to get into the word principal I will carry on our principal theme or as we need to recap a little bit uh not the 10 principles our principal theme is Ruth attached to Naomi and not such a no transpiracy that's our notice our subject instead say yes the four steps of Ruth are the perfect type of the gentle church amen amen it's been a few weeks we've seen that there are four chapters in The Book of Ruth we have chapter one Ruth still taking the decision or service chapter 2 Ruth who are serving as we just read it we see Ruth at the feet of boas El chapite and chapter 4 is Ruth rewarded by marriage to read the four stages for Ruth sad decisions her decision which is a justification foreign to give us a picture if you can just leave the writing on the board because this is Young we have the decision service we have service or working with we have the rest and at last marriage thank you hey logistification justification La sanctification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost La adoption and adoption amen amen RIT Ruth addition had decided Ruth had to work and because of her work she had the rest and four a Saturday that types the decision of Earth justification for us is justification our work is sanctification rest is the baptism of the Holy ghosts and at the end the marriage is the adoption and this morning we're already at this stage the third amen amen Ruth arrest amen and this morning we're talking on the rest of Ruth GTP categories their types for us the baptism of the Holy ghosts as the pastor asked questions it is really the story of redemption for married how Ruth came from this messy family and neglected but God by his grace will take her to bring her in in the family of Jesus and these four stages of Ruth the exactly it is the same way that God has done with the gentle church amen amen as we know that we are people from other nations we were not counted biologically as the people of God because the biological people of God is the Jew a no no muslim representative we are represented as Gentiles the moabites but what did God do eleven is you came and today to save the Jews at the same time there is uh they are serving the Jews he also saves us the gentile people by Grace amen amen we didn't do nothing but he decided by his own grace de nacion the gentle Church what did God do justification he brought them by justification sanctification we know that the Gentiles church is called after the panther code amen amen yes to raise up this church this church starting with Martin Luther justification because that's him that started that prison justification and God carried on the next stage of the with the Gentile Church John Wesley or through John Wesley Massachusetts and God sent the message of sanctification and afterwards and then came the return of the Holy Ghost the Pentecostal age and after this age perfect and therefore God has to move on and carry on because yes that has to resemble what God wants to have as a bride has to see the quality of work that Ruth has to do amen amen we spoke about the Ruth's work throughout the week is and we saw that Ruth after deciding sentence just to move on so that he can take us into the heavens roof after deciding La decisions that's what we believe and when we accept Christ and we engage ourselves we decide not to go back in the world that pushes us to work and we came into this family in this family we came to find people we never known before and then those people are my family I have no more desire to go back into the family be as rules he died people will be my people be your life when God sends us the message foreign only surrounded by people who always sit down they will always discourage you won't go any further the second level fire that's why that's what happens when we take our decision and when Ruth decided after gleaning in the land Boaz walking by seeing Ruth the way she was working and the boy says that's sanctification we don't stay there lazy [Music] is Christ boys [Music] foreign [Laughter] into what others are doing and boys he said as you have worked so hard now you have to rest you have to rest Beloved the work of God always pays off that's the reason why don't try if I catch you fat the work that you do you're not doing it to impress anything but I'm doing it because I have decided suggest that this God here the god of William Brothers to reveal the Bible he is the true God the religion that ahead I've understood that all these guys you cannot be shaken if you're not a preacher foreign even if I'm not a preacher I can also Ministry [Applause] your life even if you're not on the board in your life is a great sermon is the sisters even if she cannot come up here but her behavior it is you as a role model [Applause] [Music] but everything is all right you said that when they seal a wagon less Specter the inspector Illinois it has to be sure that the work was well done the inspector Jesus less than terrible one they respectables he has to be sure that after you've decided to provide enough is a very perfect word to get you to rest hey man not somebody today he comes he comes to church he's working probably is paying his time probably supposed to cause in a way or another may I pray but then something happens then instead of regrading on those things or even with those denominations oh when we were there with those gods it's not a correct work amen amen but when God sees get you continue Without You carrying on you working dear God Kyle expected us when it inspects your life because sanctification is a work amen [Music] and I will speak on the things that you Wicked and when he's talking meaning when you're listening to the words and you start working oh Lord it is true this part here oh this belongs to me merciful and they say kill me by the grace and remove for me remove from me despair this is the word please the more you work like that was his secretary the more God also sees what you're doing because many people it is they say or works that does not mean anything by grace otherwise we'll get you something else but Braham says actually in James it says without works and I'll tell you it is a dead face it is true that because I'm coming to church saves me by his Sovereign Grace because Grace is God a sovereign are we together effect but what does that Grace do I practically myself after saving me less salvation in me pushes me to work to show to God that I have nothing to give you what you have done is so great even if I work so hard I will not be able to match what you have done for me but Lord I will pray Lord I will give you praise and those are words those are the words that you do to show to God that there is salvation in other words you're not showing words there's no salvation yeah amen amen it's bad words God wants to see it we are sent by Grace salvation in me he says sends me to to sing foreign this is too much Jesus yes sir Matt but when he thought oh there's a certain Brothers there's a certain sister decision acceptable if I don't accept them oh he is a loss forever despite I cannot do it Jesus didn't do anything it's my sins it's your sins innocent individuals Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] he said good health but look in return even to worship him instead of any complicated oh may God open that to us may God help us pray we are ready to clap everybody a king of this world anybody out there but to pray to our upload for him that can make you breathe it is a problem for you we come to church we are more than a Catholic we sit there we say Amen in the heart I'm not against that but him David is that him the great Kingston [Applause] salvation [Applause] he knocked on free understood that's what he said the joy of Salvation Brothers at times when people say a lot of Amen people when people say a lot of Hallelujah a lot of Applause that can be among us he doesn't like it that's right all right God bless you yeah he doesn't like it but not a guy but now watch but focuses somebody can be a city he is always weak he went to he came together but God has no idea he wants to use you with the Holy Ghost in you saw that all together that can give solution to that person sent a scripture No watch when the Holy Ghost is speaking but you always indifference you're not helping the devil to leave [Applause] has to leave again with the Greatest Prize he's a God that loves us so

visions and what he has to tell people and he saw in the vision from his birth every time while he was growing he saw him serving the vision you see the man of Galilee at on the cross moving around

resting with the earnest of our inheritance that we know that something happened in us people with the Holy Ghost he'll serve they know that something had happened to them in the way that they are living the revelation of the word amen amen [Applause] with nature foreign [Applause] let me read it um because I've surrendered unto you I didn't follow what I had as a human being says this is how many of you listen to uh Kennedy's uh Speech and the commentaries and everything is how many heard this prediction that by January 1st is predicted both the United States and Russia will be volcanic ashes it's later than we are thinking he is preaching this sermon July 30th 1961. see since 1961 the prophet the prophet is is later than we think and if he was here what was he going to do good to

job is done oh igles and now church all brothers and sisters oh Father and mothers and myself we shall know should we be sure that we are in the rest we that the Holy Ghost is in us but let's not confuse there's a spiritual a religious spirit and there's a holy ghost it's two different things amen amen but when the Holy Ghost comes then you know and you know that you're sure you don't worry about anything yes storms will come amen we have to know where we're standing here but the Holy Ghost Sinners will give us strength in the battle foreign said it is good amen amen you know it's good to know how things will roll out but it's good to have rest in ourselves when God gives him the Holy Ghost is not going to remember all these mistakes but if it happens at a minute and even though this one get baptized today will go but then with you with all this knowledge will stay behind amen foreign is to joke around with that authority to fool around there are people who are fooling around without Authority and his uncle is only saying that they have the Holy Ghost what is the religious spirit is this the spirit that Jesus spoke about in Matthew 24. they say that the truth shall be so close that you'll be so hard to know who amen amen that's why this morning well Ruth was uh the nose of her wrist let me be sure of my rest let's know these things the young men young women at times

and Russia in Italian as if like nothing is happening now people are not talking about it anymore in a few weeks ago that as it went the way it went it's as if people have rested now Jesus said when
