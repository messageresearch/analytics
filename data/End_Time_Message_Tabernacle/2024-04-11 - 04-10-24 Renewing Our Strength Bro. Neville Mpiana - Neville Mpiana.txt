earth we live in a good condition and be United with all the saint of all time we ask this in Jesus Christ name amen amen I want to greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen so as I said uh we have lost one of the pastor today Pastor Peter Chandler pet Chandler from uh London the I know him personally because we preached to one of the convention I think in k today was Wednesday he was in the church office preparing for the service and one of the Asher came and found him dead so what we say he's not dead he has been promoted to Glory amen amen he has a different type of body tonight as we are yeah I think it's uh his daughter who was married by Brother Christian PE to his soul amen amen amen amen this is to say you and I we need to be ready can take your Bible I'm going to meditate for my last sermon or whatever you do work go to the market can be your last ride the last ride each one of us will have a last ride each of our preachers each preacher will have his last sermon so today uh we are going to have um a special speaker it's uh brother Neville who's going to bring the word to us tonight I know that uh he has been here for almost three years but before he came here as uh he was talking to Sharon uh Pastor uh Simon Peter from New York Pastor Sim the New York uh he told me you are going to have a good son-in-law uh I have observed him he has something to preach the gospel but for the last three years uh I have to give the opportunity to myself to see how he is acting and I think I have uh it somebody who really love the Lord uh he does a lot of thing in a secret uh I have seen him many many nights here in the sanctuary praying overnight and uh even the interaction he has with many people among us I think he has a very good testimony as well and the last time Pastor Simon Peter was preaching here at my uh birthday last year uh he was asking him did you start preaching yet he said not yet even the parent uh sister Elise and uh brother Greg they said since his youth they notice he has something for serving the lord a testimony even within the family he is like the pastor of their sisters brothers even parents and then uh tonight I think after many many opportunities I was talking with him he did really impress me in many ways he never come to tell me I have a call but observing the people I noticed that and uh spoke with Pastor Simon Peter say yes but uh you know we are going we are passing we have also to think about tomorrow and I don't think that he's the only one here uh we want to give them the opportunity to expresss and uh the opportunity doesn't make somebody when you preach once that you become uh what we call ordain confirm whatever mean is to know it's just the beginning and it's our job to continue to monitor how you are progressing and uh the monitoring is the key part it's not a guarantee that because I have preached that I become a preacher I can go anywhere no I don't there is a call and there is a time that you have your commission and you come to a certain maturity and the maturity will humble you and uh as you start exercising exercising your you cannot impress people with your preaching on the pulpit but what is more impressing impressing is your life out of the pulpit when there will be some issue where people are arguing fighting disu this is where the ministry will play what is your interaction when people are doing certain bad things how do you react if you is it is he bringing people to the word or he's even diverting people out of the word the things are part of our observation and prayer so without any further delay we are going to bring him to the platform tonight I will ask you to pray for him uh I think all the ministers one day they add their first [Music] sermon it's the most [Music] challenging you have to encourage them and uh let us stand as we bring uh brother Neville Piana to the platform platform sing how sweet [Applause] like me I [Applause] was was but now I'm found was now I see praise God praise God praise God praise God pra God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God God bless you I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus before sitting let's just open our Bible in the book of Psalm chapter 103 verse 1 Bible says bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name amen yeah bless the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefit amen who forgiveth all all thy iniquities who Health all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles uh we're going to read again in the book of uh Isaiah chapter 40 from verse 27 to why sayth thou oh Jacob and speaketh oh Israel my ways is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over my my go from my God as that not known as not not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the Creator of the ends of the world fed not neither is weary there's no searching of his understanding he giveth power to Def fence and to them that I have no might increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall UT fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength amen they shall M up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not Fain amen let's pray our precious Heavenly Father we so thankful to be in th presence David says I'm glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of Father God we so happy to gather together to Fellowship around the world therefore father we asking so you can help us take us out of the way may the Holy Spirit speak father God to your people father you know my limitation you know my weaknesses you know how weak I am father there's nothing good I can offer I'm just coming on you father that is why father God came and have control in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen you may seated we would like to thank the Lord for this opportunity he has given us to serve him and we also like to thank the pastor for allowing us to stand here uh you know we certainly appreciate our pastor for uh this openness of the spirit his love and support is always promoting young people Young Generation always ready to give advice when it's needed I was reading brother Benham was talking about brother FF bof he said is a person that he know that he knows well about Divine Healing and it said is a person that you can send to and then get resource from him and we believe our pastor is like that old oak tree brother when was calling brother was of the old tree you can always go and get resource what you needed we certainly appreciate and thank our pastor and I would like also to thank the church years [Music] ago and I could see your love and your support your consideration and especially when we were waiting for our first [Music] child uh I could see how you were praying for us and uh there's one time one family came to me and they told us they've been praying for us every day and even the kids the little children they were even praying cutting saying our names God bless brother nille God bless sister Sharon and that was really touching for us and we certainly appreciate you and love you and also there was also another family that came they even had a dream sh they shared the dream with us and we prayed and uh if we can see our first child it's because of your [Music] prayers that's why we H certainly want to thank you all for everything that you do and for your love and support um as you can tell I'm not really a preacher I'm very nervous right now I'm shaking but I'm counting on your prayers um I don't really like uh public speaking not really good speaker uh but uh you know I've been running away from this for a long time um I never wanted to be here um that brother I think I heard Brother Richard was saying it couple service ago I prefer to sit back there or if possible serving at the back even interpreting I think one time the pastor called me I was sitting there I was trying to run away but the pastor just called me brother n come and help us and if I'm interpreting today I think I was pushed by I had a little push by Brother Martin he will come and even if it was supposed to preach I mean to interpret Brother Martin will just disappear and I I won I didn't have any choice just to come up and interpret so just to tell you like I don't really like to stand here and uh since I'm very blushful person I'm very shy person and I was reading brother bam was talking about brother young Preacher Brother r uh that brother he told Brother every time I stand in front of people uh I can't talk I feel like my my heart is about to come out and brother benam told him you know when you feel like your about your heart is about to come out uh just swallow back and speak in the name of the Lord uh that's why I don't know if there's water here so if I feel like my heart is about to come up I'll take a seep of water I'll swallow back bam advice and I'll speak in the name of the Lord yeah like I was saying I've been running away from this for a long time but you know brother brother bam said The more you run away from it the more trouble you get and he was saying like about talking about Jonah he said Jonah Jonah when God is after you you might as well give up because uh you not let you in peace you'll be more you'll be desperate you'll be more in trouble this is just the little advice I can give to my fellow young people God can trust you with something with a gift with a talent don't try to run away from it because the more you run away the more trouble you get you will never Prosper until you get come back to God the prophet says you might as well just give up you might have ambition no I want to be a basketball player I want to be a big somebody I want to serve I want to do like I want to be an engineer those are good but but until you get back to God and serve him you will not Prosper that's why uh we are here for me it's a way to give up and my wife was telling me a couple weeks ago maybe a lot of problem that you have is because you've been running away and when I spoke with the pastor the pastor asked me told me like I was going to preach I wanted to tell the pastor maybe later I feel like I'm not ready uh but I just like before saying something I just need to pray and until couple days ago uh I was reading I just find a random message uh I couldn't even think like from this message I can get something I was just like let me just read because I was praying and there brother bham was saying uh I think it's the message investment uh I just fell into that b paragra 47 he say if you've got something in your heart for God and you won't express it and so forth and you just keep uh putting it off well later later on and that little desire that you once had to serve God will be taken from you the will come in and steal die away from you then you won't have any desire to serve it I was like God help me I think for me it was a a little sign that it was a time uh therefore that's why we're here and uh that's what I'm counting on your prayers uh it's a big turn I don't know where the Lord will take me but uh I'm just counting on on the grace of God uh the prophet was also saying he was happy to see young people serving God and uh it's always not easy to preach to the family or to stand before the family but I believe they're happy they're so TR to see me standing here and I can see people that saw us growing I can see papa mama they saw us growing our ups and down but seeing us serving the lord I think they should be TR yeah so um I'm just counting on your prayers like I was saying and uh hopefully that you're going to continue to pray for all of us young people do you promise you're going to pray for well just in case you want like one of my friend was saying I made sure I call my two mothers I made sure I call my two mothers I told them I was going to preach I was going to say something and I was counting on the prayers so if you don't I know there's mothers somewhere praying for me know what the prophet say about the praying mothers but I'm sure you all going to pray for me you are my mothers my brothers my fathers and I'm certainly counting on them um I just today I just wanted to just give a little encouragement uh especially after this great time that we had with the Lord uh I've been really uh blessed for couple month you know starting with the the the series of on the blessings and curses like I said it was that time that God gave us a son and then there was a time the pastor was also preaching about the levite and one time I was talking to the pastor I was like this is one of the reason I don't want to preach because there's a lot of responsibility there's a lot I was just given excuses but the pastor told me when you called by God God will take care of it therefore it was really a blessing to to hear all this uh series wow and we had a wonderful Easter meetings with uh man of God brother lunda and brother Richard I was telling Brother Richard I was really blessed and I believe there's something going on in the church something is happening I don't know about you I feel like there's something happening in you just look around you see how God is dealing with the church and you know the same the way the angel told Abraham next year around the same time you will have a son and Elijah said the same thing to the woman next year around the same time you will have a son and I feel like saying the same thing next year around the same time B will be consecrated around the same time God will bless the church testimony will be given that's what I believe amen amen and like I was saying I just going to give a little encouragement uh about renewing our strength in the book of Isaiah where Isaiah where we read every time I say isah my wife said no you you should say Isaiah we African sometime the always so um in the book of Isaiah uh Isaiah was talking to the children of Israel he said uh verse 27 isah 40:27 uh in another uh version they said why would you ever complain oh Jacob saying God has forgotten me he has lost track of me he doesn't care about what happens to [Music] me you can say I've been praying I've been waiting for something it's been years it seems that God have for has forgotten about my claim my prayers my right is pass over no one pays attention to me all alone I lost all my strength so it happens to everybody was why this God you you forgotten about me I'm I'm losing all my strength so losing strength is a part of human life sometime we get to the point where we lose strength no strength to carry on no energy to press on you you just have no strength to to to press through to press through a sickness maybe you've been sick for a long time praying you've been seeing doctors and you get to a point where you're just tired I've seen that with a lot of uh maybe um sick people some sometimes they feel like you know I'm tired Lord just take my life I'm tired I can't continue so this is just it happens to everybody uh struggling sometime to meet hands you're just struggling to to have a stable [Music] job maybe a stable relationship you know for for a preacher or for a pastor sometimes they struggling to see a church Prosper maybe they've been preaching for so long they sacrifying their life but they can't see the church prospering church turning in C Circle and then they get tired they say Lord why this why I can't see my church can't see the thing that preaching be manifested in people you know it's a pressure on the people you know even the pro the prophet said this has no limitation of age it's not because you are young people that you cannot get tired it's not because you're old you cannot get tired it has no limitation no limitation of color it's not because you white or that you can't have pressure so it's it has no limitation of size rich or poor in the message letting off the pressure parag 34 pring may3 the prophet sayet so then I thought I will speak to this congregation why they probably train right maybe that's that's probably the case here you know after this series this teaching really well trained no doubt about it but there's a pressure on the people preach about off the pressure say he has no no age line he has no respect of person it's on the young and old good or bad it's on everybody the pressure you know the the prophet says it happens to anybody no one is spare from it even the prophet job he said one time since he was having a lot of pressure he said Lord I might have just a request if you please just God crush me and then I will lose his hand and come me off it just it was asking God to just cut him off and his wife came along he said just Curse God and die he was tired the prophet job the same thing with Moses they wor Fed Up leaders the Fed Up leader the we leader the the prophet F Prophet F uh he was tired he was facing a lot of complaint from the people after helping people he was tired the people wouldn't be grateful and he said in the book of number chapter 11 he said the burden is too heavy for me if you will treat me like this kill me at once if I find favor in your sight that see I might not see my righteousness he even smoke twice the rock tired so it happens to anybody either you are Prophet or you just a normal person sometime you get to a point where you're tired elah the prophet he ran the Bible said he ran under the jiper tree you know uh the the after bringing the fire from the heaven the mighty Prophet Elijah you know he challenged the world but after a while he was sh down by a woman Jezebel the mighty Prophet started running he ran under the Jenifer tree he started dra he started crying he said Lord it's enough now Lord take my life I'm not better than my fathers that's what we feel sometimes when we have a lot of problems we feel like we're not better than anybody you know sometimes as young people you feel like you know I'm not better than my friend why Prosper I cannot Pros where they can they can they can succeed at school I cannot succeed I'm not better than anybody a young lady can feel like I'm not beautiful enough that's why maybe I'm not getting married nobody's looking at me you know I'm not smart enough strong enough and that you feel like you're useless everyone makes fun of me I can't achieve anything that's why I'm encourage your father's parents please encourage your children you don't know why they're going through a school everybody's probably making fun of them they think like they they're not beautiful enough because they're wearing skirt but you we should be encouraging them telling them they're beautiful they're smart you know sometime that's why even bullying is not good you know sometime you know even at school you know between siblings we bullying each other that leads to depression and that that's why you see like the Bible says Elijah ran under the Jour tree you see some people they isolate themselves because they feel like they're not useful there's no room uh in a Christian faith for bullying people we should be people we should be people that uplift others encouraging others not bringing them down don't be the reason someone is going through depression of someone is going to a breakdown that's why I want to tell some of our young people today God loves you you are beautiful you are smart it doesn't matter what people say about you what thinks of you saw the beauty in you saw the value in you why chose you he didn't choose them just watch them after a couple years after taking drugs they don't they can't they look like weird but you look at you after many years you know you still a beauty in front of God undermining yourself so that's why the prophet was saying in the message what [Music] he paragraph 58 Elijah was on his nerve on the age nerves was ready to break then he ran under the Wilderness so that's what sometimes that's what happened after a lot of problem a lot of Trials you know you being attacked you just feel like running away you isolate yourself I don't want to talk to nobody I just want to take my time off because you are tired so you just I just want to tell you you you're not alone you're not the first person to feel that way the same thing the prophet say Elijah went through depression and the prophet says and the the prophet says the prophet all that experience of A J Tree there many of us find ourself under the Jer tree I get myself many times to a place that you don't know what to do you're frustrated frankly I'm right under it right now people under the jiper tree the prophet said they like to sleep sometime you don't feel like working anymore you just feel like sleeping you see when you see somebody sometimes sleeping too quick to judge maybe they're going through a lot encourage them sometime they just need a little encouragement Prophet says they like to sleep I preach to more people tired than anybody in the world so tired they went in such a nervous [Music] condition until they don't know what to believe they don't know what they want you I realize that today a lot of young people leaving the message they are tired of being in the message feel like we been in the message maybe there's no power they feel like there's no power there's no this there's no that and they are so tired they don't know what to believe the prophet continues saying and then they go to drink it you can't drink it off you can't drink it off you can't shut it off you see you can you can try to drink as as much alcohol you want take the depression out of you drink it off the only thing you need no matter how much you drink that W help you you know the prophet says you could take a thousand s and try to sleep it off maybe I'll take a nap I'll be fine after a while no you won't be fine you know until you meet God then you'll be fine oh Elijah the prophet he said oh let me die 67 the prophet says I have had those feelings you know he said 71 sometime I feel like one time put a pistol against my head to commit suicide but I couldn't do it I took my glove off to lay on the voltage line but I couldn't do it something still held the same God with Elijah that same God today you might seem to be under the jiper tree you tired you want to you want take away your life but as long as if you're child of God God will not let you do it the same time the same thing the same way all the prophet he will ow you too he see he seen me under the jiper tree my wife and baby laying y in the grave and old I was just about gone myself I've laid under the Jer tree it's hard it's hard to be under the Jour you are so tired you feel like nobody understands you nobody pays attention to you you try to explain it will get it I tried to take a gun my brains out he wouldn't do it you know God wasn't finished with me he will always take care of you you know you may feel like you alone right there under the Jer tree God will take care of you amen amen so um I was trying to find out like what is the causes of the reason why people lose strength why people lose the strength so medically speaking uh you can lose strength due to malnutrition age genetics or certain medical condition you know malnutrition it's it's the fact that you're not eating well eating less or overeating still a malnutrition you see some sometimes that's what happen you know when you eat less you feel tired because you don't have immune system and then you you're so just weak and then if you overeat you're also going to feel weak like the prophets was saying you saw people sometime when they come to church before coming to church that's why you sleep in the church you feel tired the prophet says because your brain I was talking to Mama the other day because your your blood goes to your stomach you know your brain can work that's why you feel tired but when you have an empty stomach cl to your brain you can stay focused and the prophet says That's The Power of fasting the reason why we fast god sometime Place some of the thing in US is to teach us something so when when we don't eat we fast focused you can't eat a lot and pray you're just going to feel tired you can't pray in that way so another reason it's a taste of time you know where over time you know the more time passes you get tired you can't you can't stand it no more maybe you you were waiting for something but since it's taking so long you move on to another thing I'm just going to go quickly at old age you lose strength because of old age trials can make you lose you know that you feel like you you over you over tried you feel like the TR is too much remember God says he will not tempt you what you can end there's no trials that above you another reason it's a lot of attack from the devil it's like in the boxing the more attack you receive the more punches you receive the weaker you get so the best way to stay strong is to avoid as much punches as you can that's why there was the prophet was saying I want to teach you to be soldiers so you can avoid as much punches as you can being touched you know sometime we feel like everybody saying things against us you can't control what people say about what you can control it's how it affects you if you let what people say about you affect you that's why you become weak you feel like you know in this church they always talk about me uh you know they always say things about me I'm tired of going to that church because you're letting what people say affects you you cannot control what they say you cannot control how the enemy is punching you just have to learn how to dodge punches amen amen another reason it's Sin Sin wears you out in the book of PSM chapter 32 verse the Bible says when I refuse to confess my sin my body wasted away I grown all day long you see like when you have sin you feel tired because that guilt is heating you up the only way to help is to confess it there's a little story I read somewhere there was a a girl it was she was very smart [Music] girl she she she she was raising the nice family and she went to school she met she met a friend and they became best friend and one day her friend came to her and said I I have a secret to tell you but promised me first that you're not going to tell nobody and she said yeah I promise I'm going I'm not going to keep your secret well I killed my dad she couldn't believe it she thought the friend was lying because the dad just died there was an investigation and then the lady just confessed to that girl killed her dad and then since she already promised to her friend that she will not tell nobody she had to keep that guilt and then she she was very smart getting all the grade A and school all of a sudden they starting seeing a great dropping she couldn't focus no more she couldn't pay attention she couldn't sleep and then she went after while she went to drug the parents couldn't understand what's going on and then after while they took her somewhere and then she was really at the end had to confess it once she confessed it free so you see Guilt can hit you can destroy you only reason for you to get out of it is to confess sometime people you feel like you don't you don't feel like praying because there's a sin somewhere in your life you trying to keep it but don't try to keep it confess it and God says Come Ye unto me he have every Laden I give you rest confess lay down everything take my yoke my yoke is easy you know sometime we keep things that we don't have to keep it that but the prophet says God can save the vest of Sinners no matter what you have done confess it don't keep it in your heart the prophet says sin will take you further than you can imagine come back and confess it you can move on but the more you keep it that's why you drawing it you can't walk you you can't even pray because your your your mind your conscience is guilty amen amen but as we read the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew the strength but how can I renew my strength I can I renew my strength watch the ego that the ego the Bible say even David and Isaiah they're saying the same thing they're talking about the E you know what happened what other eego does the ego you knew his strength how when the eag gets old there's a crust over his face there's a over his face he can't see no more he can't fly no more he can't do nothing because he's dying he's getting old he can't do nothing but this only his only help is to find a rock even if he getting old he's [Music] dying he will say I would have my life ride I have my last flight I will fly for maybe the last time find the rock somewhere and when he finds The Rock he will start beating his head against The Rock beit his head against The Rock but we have a rock we have a rock in the r land the Rock of Ages that was C to us the only thing we have to do is to find the rock if you feel like you're tired tonight you can't find the rock just come there's a rock in the land amen amen that's why what the prophet was saying he's getting old he can't walk no more he can't fly no more sometimes you feel like you can't read the Bible no more tired you can't pray no more you can't you can't live a Christian Life no more you're tired in the message letting off the pressure the prophet says I know a rock amen amen a rock that the can beat his head himself in prayer till all the crust of the world is broken the sh of is broke loose a man can beat himself in prayer that still every sin shle is broke away from him I know where a prostitute can beat till become Ladi I know where drunker can beat till they become God of God I know Rock that Rock is Christ Jesus our refuge as soon as you get all the war beit of you you renew your strength after beating your head your in prayer there's a rock in the r land yourself in prayer renew yourself in prayer the only way to renew your Str come to beat your head against The Rock pray that's why Prayer Changes Things prayer is the key if you are desperate you are going through depression if you sick sad you can't take it no more you know you you you want you want your kids to be saved pray you under attack pray you you for your relationship pray for your husband pray for your wife pray for your children pray without season the prophet says Christian don't realize the power strength they have when they pray prayer is the key prayer is the answer prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of the human being no atomic bomb hydrogen bomb powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God you know you may think God say something about me maybe because I've sin since the Bible says the wage of sin is death but when you pray I can change the mind of God there there was a king ezekiah God sent the prophet to tell him but he prayed he prayed and his prayer change that say the Lord your prayer can change the mind of God Amen brother says he gave us the strongest weapon the reason all the world that's prayer prayer changes things the Christian doesn't realize what force we are talking about renewing our strength chran doesn't realize the power they have when they pray when you kneel down before your almighty God but what is a weapon without a bullet what is a weapon without a bullet a weapon without a bullet is a toy a weapon without a bullet it's useless a prayer without the name of Jesus it's useless noise the prayer without the name of Jesus it's a tinkling symbols the prayer without the name of Jesus Remember David had a slingshot but without the stones it was useless and the prophet says five stones are the name of Jesus saw the prayer use the name of Jesus the prophet went somewhere there was a woman they were practicing spiritualism the power of demon they they had a table that was hanging and they were challenging people who will bring that table down and they they call out Four Strong young men they tried to pull that table down the prophet say they fell down they couldn't do it but they call they told the prophet you call yourself you're a man of God do something and the prophet came and he said table in the name of the church fall nothing happen in the name of the big Pastor nothing happen in the name of this nothing happen but once he said table in the name of the Lord Jesus just the table fell but it crushed so I feel like this evening disease if you have a problem hanging just come in prayer in the name of Jesus that table will fall that disease will fall that problem will fall no matter how hard it is no matter how impossible it is just speak the name of Jesus the name of Jesus can change anything the name of Jesus can bring life to life amen what a powerful name we have the prophet says I'm going to close here prayer changes death to life you know I realize in the message sometime we don't pray too much denominational they pray a lot sometimes they have intense night of prayer Jesus all his life is was about prayer he said the secret that I have my of my Ministry it's because of prayer and we don't pray now denominational they pray because and they don't have the word and Jesus said if my words abide in you then you can pray you cannot pray without the word but we have the word but we don't pray what a tragedy we should be the people that pray too much the tragedy of today it's not unanswered prayers it's unoffered prayers we don't offer prayers we don't pray and We complain that God doesn't answer pray and brother says pray until God answers if he doesn't answer stay there until he answers your prayer I'm not going to leave here until you answer my prayer don't content yourself with a half answer I think brother brother Richard was saying it sometime you pray you are asking for big things and after a while since you're getting tired you're trying to bargain your prayer maybe you asking for 10,000 you see maybe God is not able to give you, may maybe let me change it uh 5,000 don't bur your prayer possible ask big things if yesterday I asked 10,000 tomorrow I'm going to ask 20,000 I'm not going back I'm going forward I'm asking big things oh amen renew your strength in prayer you can your strength oh there's a rock where you can beat yourself PR yes you are my rock in time of trouble you lift me up when I fall down when I feel down why you lift me up all through my storm my problem your love is the anchor is my anchor even if I go through problem anchor my rock where I can hide

encouragement very often we don't do it when there is something that need to be done I don't want to do it I want another person to do it when the other person will do it then I will find mistakes
