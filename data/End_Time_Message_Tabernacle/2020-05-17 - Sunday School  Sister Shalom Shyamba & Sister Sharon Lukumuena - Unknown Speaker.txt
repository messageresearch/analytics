back this week to another lesson on Sunday School where Hewish the launch and we hope that you're doing good and you had a great week and we're just gonna jump right into our last one and we're just gonna start off first with the word of Prayer let's bow our head dear Heavenly Father we think he wants again for another week thank you given to us another day to be alive you know that idea opportunities are you given you gave us the depth of life there's another opportunity to please Allah we pray an athlete open up our eyes open up our ears open up our hearts so that we may see something for me we thank you we act in your best this week in Jesus Christ's name all right like I said we're just gonna jump into our lesson today I hope you guys will pay attention I know it's just you know few minutes we're just gonna share a little something with you just encourage you and today we're gonna talk about some of the stories that brother Branham told he liked he liked to tell stories to children because you know Plus children are also important and what you're learning now is you know I'm not sleeping here for the rest of your life so I'm just going to tell you a little story that brother Dan I'm told I know I don't know some of you the credit but it's a story talking about it other than a little bit of the school and one day there was the Kings was gonna pass by and so the teachers gathered all the students from each class you know from first grade second grade from kindergarten all the little kids gathered and they were gonna go outside and see the King and they gave that all the little kids little flags so every time so when they see their King passed by the kids will mix up their flag and wave it's the king and there was a seal king pass sight so all the kids gathered outside and everyone was excited yes we're gonna see the king we're gonna see the king and the King passed by in his chariot and all the kids waved their flags even the little kids and the older kids everyone waved the flag as the King passed by it and then the and after the king passed by and all the children kind of gathered themselves back to go back into the classroom the teacher noticed that one of the girls was missing and she started looking around for that girl and she couldn't find the little kid once where did she go what happens here where they should go and she heard all the sudden she heard a little boy sleeping you know like when someone is crying she could hear so she went and she followed the weeping found me she found the little girl sitting down and crying and so the teacher asked her what's going on why why are you crying why are you sad didn't you see the king and she said yes thank you and then the teacher was like then why are you crying that you saw the king did you wave your flag and political said yes I raised my blood and the teacher said so why are you crying then why are you so upset is something wrong what happened and the little girl said well I waved my bag and I'm father king but I'm so little and so small that's the King didn't see me and that's where the random told backstory the backstory is kind of like us maybe the king back then we told healer king to the human being like he was talking by and there was a lot of children he couldn't see all the little children but that's different with us and origins our King eirick unique the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus feed everything he feeders no matter how small we are no matter how little we are no matter where we hide ourselves even if we hide ourselves under the bed in the dark got to look everywhere we are everything that he does keep people so that's why that's what's different between our team the God the king that we said in the king and the king of this world so what is the perfect is color for something to tell us that no matter where you are just know that we're the king watching over you no matter what you do even if you're like well my mom and dad can't see me I'm just gonna steal this little piece of candy and nobody's gonna see it you know who can see you God can food and he could be in the Black Moon I think I'm stealing I see this little girl steering it's simply stealing and God's God and you will remember that if you don't confess that so another story that I wanted to tell you what's also from rebel Brownback he told kid it was in brother Branham was a little boy see brother Branham came from a big family he had a lot of students Auto brothers especially and one day since they grew up in of course families they would go out maybe once in a while and you know they would get candy and they gave him all little pieces of candy you know all kids love candy so they gave all the venoms pieces of candy and brother Brandon had his piece of candy but he covered it but he colored his when he just ate a little bit and he took his wrapper and he put it back on I'm gonna chew spit and I'm gonna hide it and I'm gonna use it for some time later so then you know at home always okay sometimes our parents can call it and be like hey Michael give me water HM you're going to this so that how it was in brother branham's houses so one day I think it was Monday mornings the branham's mom called them in that area and he said yes mom and he said and she said can you go get the water you know they didn't back then we didn't have a lot of the chicken you know it's you know the thing that a fussing get water they have to go get water from down the stream at the river and she said William can you go get water and Lillian was like I don't want to go get water he didn't want to go get water but again we don't want to go get the water so he said I'm going to my brother to do it and he thought he went a little good and said can you go get the water for me and he said no that's your job you go get it under the denim well you know what he did he pulled out the candy he said here he'll kill the piece of candy I'll let you suck on this candy and you go get the water for me and the brother was like yes candy so he put the candy in his rock and studied and said I'll give Kelly you suck at Kentucky it's a 10-9 it was a were you counting too fast nor dost and he started counting ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and he took it up and the random rap that they can be gonna kept against the next time so I know some of us I know the Benham told the story when he told her story he told a keep it that don't try that don't try doing that he stopped it's not being honest right because if you can't tell you to do something you have to do it because it's your responsibility you can't try you know passing off with Emily a little brother so you do that if you do that now if your parents tell you to do something you have to be obedient and make sure that you listen trunk am you obeyed to them so that's just to show you that even when we do little stuff like that was do our little sneaky tricks you know I'm gonna lie to my parents I'm gonna feel this God he's everything that we do and not only their teeth we are negative stuff but he seemed all to the positive stuff that we do maybe one day maybe your parents blamed you for something that you didn't do God will see you right God will be like no I know that's display the good boy every morning when she wakes up she gets on his neither be praised as you read the Bible God sees all the good things that you do and even at times when you're sitting there maybe you're sad or just crying about something we upset so that God is gone and even when you say your prayer no matter how down or how big enough you miss me God is always there to listen and he sees everything that you need and the wonderful thing about our King is that he he knows what we mean even before we say it so maybe I think I might wake up and I'd be like I want a couple of juice but God already knew that way before I even really asked him that so that's why I wasn't listening to keep our relationship that God always all that you know God hears me God is watching over me God is affecting me God wants to hear from me if you want something to be in fellowship then don't stop it so those are the little lessons that I wanted to share for you for today I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned something and when we get back together I'm gonna be asking you guys questions about these so make sure you're paying attention forgive me go back to Luke oh I'm gonna be asking guys question so make sure you pay attention all right thank me when they're gonna patch it up with Stallone all right Sharon thank you for the lesson there's a lot that you can learn out of that listening excuse me basically everything that you do no matter what you do just know that God can see you you can never hide from him even if you dug a big hole in the ground or you swam into the big ocean and you went all the way down we're out outer space you know was still find you because he created everything and the Bible says everything that she would do even if you were doing it unto men or to whoever do it as if you're going to do it unto God so just remember that Auto Oh God always sees whatever you do and he's gonna hold you responsible for doing if you did it right if you did it wrong right if you do it and you neglected how you were doing it right because everything he wants you to do whatever you're doing you're you're doing it as if you're doing unsubscribed you know because even the Bible says that even a little cup of water that you give to someone so every even the littlest small thing even if you're praying for somebody or you just go over you say hi to somebody asked how they were doing right or helping somebody or giving a little small courage meant to somebody God sees that and keep counting that off he's checking that off the case and saying oh look at my daughter look at my son they're doing a good job they're leaving they're right there let the right kind of life as a Christian supposed to live so for next Sunday you guys won't be seeing us so we're just gonna give you a little break from us but I'm gonna give you a little assignment alright and it's just a passage that I want you to we're going to talk about when we come back not this Sunday but the next Sunday we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk based off the passage I'm gonna put it I'm gonna make you be the place so by just reading it I want you to guess whatever what we're gonna be talking about I'm not gonna tell you but I just want you to read okay one is a story and one is from queasy yes from besought the King Solomon remember he was a very wise man and he was very rich and he had a lot of good things to say so the first story isn't is found on what you guys to write it down and so like for the next two weeks you have plenty of time to reason you don't have an excuse right so second Kings chapter 20 just we don't whole chapter it's not a long chapter but it's a very interesting story I'm just gonna leave it there I want you guys to read it and find out what happens in that story and then also it is in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 through 8 so the first passage is a story second Kings chapter 20 the whole chapter okay second one is Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 to 8 okay and also I will just ask the parents a big favor if you can go over it with your child and help them read if they can't really read or understand certain parts of the passage just so you can have some interaction with them so you can help them along Oh big brother or big sister whoever it may be but especially I'm just asking the parents if you displeased with us this time and I guess that's about it I hope you guys just have a wonderful rest of the week hope you take

right dear Heavenly Father God we thank you so much for this lesson that she let us have a God and I pray that the little things that the children were able to hear Oh God that it will just become real personal to their lives they may be able to put it into practice Oh God when you just come closer than being here with them oh God this morning oh god and for the rest of the people that I feel that you just hold them and walk with them Oh God protect them we'll go ahead and keep them safe but we thank you for everything that you've done committing all things into your hands and Jesus name
