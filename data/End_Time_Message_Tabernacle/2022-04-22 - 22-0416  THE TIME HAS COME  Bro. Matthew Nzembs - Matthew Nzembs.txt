but go wait for something that can happen says in the message they always come for this paragraph 18 says jesus and jesus uh and the the the actual thing that's the reason why i'd like you to come come along where the spirit wants us to stop it and i'll be there by the grace of grace probably with the one that will come after me god knows how we can inspire things [Music] and you reap in ready for judgment the time had came for for nowhere to go into the arc listen a man certainly can sin they've seen away his day of grace and bill do you believe that do you believe it maintainer now remark

a tiffany where we have to stand for what is right the king made a proclamation whatsoever will not bow down into his images shall be thrown in the fury furnace let it definitely the time came you can shut that mesh up and go before shadrach meshach and abednego to show their colors beloved our guard is able to deliver us from this foreign furnace but say panda nevertheless we will not bow down it was the time it was the season was there so much that's what the devil tries to do all the time you burn you up make you sicker when you prepared for fair work what experience make you think you've lost your experience with god sasela picked the shows that's the worst thing that a christian can do is to let they just say quack to let you all know that uh you've lost your experience with god now let's james spirit comes up don't ever let the devil inspire you that way you know david puts you a goal yet david to keep goliath experience personally he had to lean upon his personal experience what shall we do to the one who shall kill this man and listen to what to the good thing david did he love poseidon he first asked the question yes colombia to whether i said come and still conceive what are we going to do to what the one who shall kill this uncircumcised man say foreign did you leave the little the little rest of the flock was that the venus you came here to watch the wall hello they were only seeing a little small boy and blonde is just a blonde man with a blue eyes and a protective event why is that casually concerned probably 23 years old but they didn't see the god that was in david david and david got today before the kingdom david said but you were a child before this experiment this man is very well experienced in the world scenario you have nothing to do with him go back david you didn't know david said you know don't serve it your servant when he was a shepherd [Applause] when the the ship and brought it back in a personal mindset for he said not only once but also with uh the the bear he said the lord god who has uh rescued me from the lion the bear they can still conceive he will shall deliver me from this uncircumcised illicit basis he laid he found he laid himself upon his experience yet that's the but your life depends on your personal experiences you know how you deal with god of it all is the revelation of the lord jesus christ if jesus christ is with you you more than and overcome forever that's what the devil tries to do every time pangavande paragraph 22 forever named sayings imagine can you imagine the sentence burning the holy ghost out of him man we lost a receipt by burning him out second possibly can't be done remarking i can see the king said upon himself before they always come oh not [Music] you know sometimes we face situations he wants to bring a little bit of a doubt shall i demand that my active voice we [Music] in his [Applause] [Applause] in a few minutes i can see these guards with the spells ready to put them over into the furnace seven times harder than it ever was yet who depends we're penning an awful duck picture down here let's turn our camera up this way once oh my shut the always there's always a two sides to it you know when certain guy was controlled jesus is also fair when something is taking [Music] is [Applause] you question it it says only believe me all is possible that doesn't depend on the one next to you but that depends on the revelation that god gives you but i'm saying that jesus jesus is also confirmed whatever you healed your faith too that's the way it's going done give it to christ levin let's head down said to the children let's look up this way you know i can see him say something in his majesty he'll give [Applause] yes have you seen your servants very soon they'll be uh burning into the fiery furnace i've always been obedient to you allow me to go down hey babylon that [Music] they're almost there and i've stood by your side yes since you created the law i've

worse because if you stand for the world panda will see you in a position in the don't get tired who saber you know jesus christ lord jesus christ in matthew where we spoke so whenever the person is remember the pastor gave us a homework i hope that you have done it we will know yes or no the pastor gave us a homework yes or no vulnerability you did it right attitude toward the word of god that might say peter francis in matthew 26 jesus did the lord jesus christ went to prayer discipline and find the disciples praying you have exactly the difference because jesus christ tells them you cannot even watch an hour you're already tired you said pray because the flesh is weak but the spirit is well disposed it's these three uh hebrew children pray they prayed all night long [Applause] [Applause] like the son of god standing there out there away the breezes down there panda kills they tell her while they were there [Applause] second father of jesus that's what brother what i'm saying i'm a person he says that the fourth person is just the lord jesus christ himself came down [Music] and saved them from the fire last year you know what what problem do you have ask about the problem with the past are your problem bigger than he no no electro vector he is with you that observation in uh watching his store february he was leading the men oppressed men at night uh week after week month after month while they were going for going along the valleys in the city and the plains and stuff and of course finally it led right out to jerusalem when it comes to jerusalem shows and foretold those things they start letting us straight to that place but when the goddess the star went out why jerusalem wasn't why can't baby can they believe in a superstition or something they're not looking for it their life's gone out and they were just worshipped but on the rest a gift will not will appear or brighten itself up or make itself known get because it's the greatest it's the biggest all not at all please yeah million descents work many millions tonight only care and for me you have a hungry husband and wanting to find vegetable sentences that jesus christ remember yeah he's the same yesterday today and forever where is it we have read that he is a great healer who is selling where is it news have only kelley sent us we have heard that the holy spirit is for you for

is the power of god unto salvation it's not just a declaration of celebration today it's the power of god unto the salvation of everyone that believes why let's secrete this the scripture said in the last days they be heavy-minded and i know that it's the truth the second second of jesus i know that the same day jesus necessitated them that god is raised up from the dead he is my savior and he lives in my heart and ever heard of any you'll accept it that will accept it he will change your life and give you ali salvation a testimony of his resurrection the secret tonight says it's only to

great stone a lantern to the door of the sepulchre and departed the body of my lord he didn't know he says no le con de [Applause] because the lord has to keep on with his journey please deliver in a higher dimension only the lord jesus christ had to go there because a man of flesh by the sun could not go in there gabriel could not be bothered michael could not go down angel could be god only
