said oh this tape might wind up in a french guyana or some place so just say what i say in english satan yes i was standing there but then uh come to find out that the lord wanted for me to be an interpreter and maybe by a way of testimony i was in france uh maybe back in 92 or 91 sometimes of course and brother rowe was giving a testimony and he was testifying of the things that happened in his life he said in 1951 elijah on this nation saint content his mother was dying with cancer uh samara de concern and uh brother danny where are you praise the lord jesus and uh this young man's

but he let the people listen to that on in the branham tabernacle and so here i am in france 1991 or 92. and i'm interpreting brother rowe asian interpreter for road and he's giving this testimony hey don't say to me and it so happened that he told them now you can find this on page six or seven of a message called blasphemous names and then it so happened that that day last famous names just came off the press in the french translation of it blasphemous and so the people had the message in their hands available and so they turned to page six or seven to no and they found that things were so easy and you're talking about it you're talking about the joy i paolo d'injoy oh they came and embraced brother rose i remember one french brother screamed out of france [Music] the god of the prophet

chapter 22 i said and let's read uh verses one through uh 14. just a quick word of prayer precious lord it is good for us to be here for the saints of god for to be assembled to give you the praise and the honor for we ask it in jesus name amen amen and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son blah blah blah and sent forth his servants to call them that were beaten to the wedding and they would not come out again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are beaten behold i have prepared my dinner and my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come on to the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and north and the remnant took his servants and intruded them spitefully and slew them a result but when the king heard thereof he was rough and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city um then save heat to his servants a wedding is ready but they which were beaten were not worthy yes therefore into the highways and as many as you should find bid to the marriage [Music] so those servants went out into the highways and gather together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests [Music] bring them in yeah and when verse 11 and when the king came into this in in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not owned a waiting garment and he said unto him friend how camest thou in heather not having a wedding garment and he was speechless uh then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth may the lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated and we want to speak from paulie i'm not very good at giving titles to my messages oh i'm sorry i have a brother in the church says you
