[Music] Mercy [Music] my I should have fallen my soul cast down bad [Music] mer gracious Heavenly Father prelest creator of and Earth the Al and the Omega the beginning and the ending you the first and the last you the first and the last you the great Emmanuel we come Lord father before you tonight by your grace and by your mercy because you have Lord made it possible for us Lord to be able to be guarded today because Lord we see that in the book of Philipp Philippians that Paul was Lord wanted to get to the people and bring them the message but it was very hard in the in the land in the city of Philippi but lordmy God you have granted us Lord this privilege Lord through the media to be able Lord to gather together Lord from diverse places from diverse places lord it's by your grace that lord it's not because we deserve anything of our own but it is Lord father God you who have predestinated us onto life to be able Lord to stand Lord in this time lord while the world is changing but Lord to worship you in truth and spirit it is therefore Lord with Thanksgiving that we come before you Lord to say thank you Father that's why Lord are we coming in this time of prayer Lord to bring forth Lord everything that is within us because Lord we know that many a Time Lord we may have have went Lord through the doctors we have went through many people to help us but brother tells us that when all these people fail we have to turn to you father therefore Lord we know that tonight that many things Lord that nobody can be able to help we expressing Lord father God to read unto you in prayer precious Redeemer be with us throughout this meeting be with us throughout this meeting that you may Lord sustain us that you may give us Lord what Lord a human being could not be able to offer but then in return we can praise you we can Lord glorify your holy name because we know at the end of the day like Paul Lord he was Lord father God rewarded of the work that he worked in his life the same was for William Bram and above it all yourself the Lord Jesus Christ in the days of your flesh we have Lord father God these examples Lord set before us may you help us Lord to stand strong despite Lord father God many Temptations but Lord this is the time to show surely Lord that we are true Christians father we cry Lord father God unto you may you grant Lord father God our heart desire as we ask and pray in the name of Jesus Christ we all say Amen amen amen amen amen may God richly bless you as uh I said last Sunday we are going to stand and uh read the Bible in the book of Philippians as I said we left this chapter 4 for for this Gathering Philippians chter 4 verse 4 to 6 rejoice in the lord always and again I [Music] say let your modation be known unto all men the Lord is at end be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication weave Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God amen amen uh that's what we want to do tonight this a and uh for title I'm taking the middle of uh verse six prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving so we are um going to pray and uh with supplications but we want to add this peace with Thanksgiving so for our prayers for tonight we are going to cry we are going to make the supplication and I want to underline don't forget Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is what Paul is uh underlining here in the book of Philippians as we will continue to read uh the book of Philippians you will see why Paul said not only uh prayer supplication but also with Thanksgiving uh because he saw the Thanksgiving from the people of uh Philippi that's very very important and sometimes we make fun of the people in denomination I believe because they go overboard they don't see anything else they can be in any condition they don't care about prayer to be in contact with God the only thing they want to underline is Thanksgiving but the same Paul said if we can give our body to be burned if we don't have the love of God it's nothing so right here we see that we need always to have a balance in the scripture so from where we came from last Sunday we saw that Paul was arrested and that's why somewhere Paul is saying we are praying so that God can open up the way so that we can bring forth the gospel and uh in certain instances we need our prayers and supplication to be uh Follow by Thanksgiving we need also to make promises to God what we will do and if he does something and that's my personal secret also I remember when we were sick with my wife here I was talking to the children I exalted them in the same angle to make a promise of Thanksgiving uh to the lord it's not like they have money or something that's not what matters but this is a way to teach them then in a critical situation this is what Dad does making a promise I I said I don't need to know what you are promising but you make your own promise and from time to time I'm following with each one did you fulfill what you promised because if you don't fulfill it that was not the end of life tomorrow we will be sick again if maybe even more sick than that or we will have a need or a situation very critical again where we will need a special prayer and then when we will talk about Thanksgiving you will be stuck when you remember that when I made that promise I did not fulfill it that will kill your faith but if you made once a promise and God made it to come to pass and uh you know that you also fulfilled your part that will give you more faith and when I'm talking about Thanksgiving or making promise God doesn't need money all the time but what God will see for your Thanksgiving is what you are going to promise or if it's after the fact God will appreciate what you are going to offer as a Thanksgiving so therefore it's up to each one of us to offer something consistent that will really touch God amen amen so Paul needed prayer as he was in a prison and uh he did not know if he's going to get out of prison or he will be killed I don't know where I read it maybe the prophet or the Bible but it doesn't matter Paul was not sure being in prison he did not know that by the prayer the earthquake will break the prison gat but he say he could have been executed in prison he knew he could die that's why the prayer or and the supplication with Thanksgiving became very important that's why he say but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God your request be made known unto God when you have a prayer request don't look at the circumstan don't look at the condition but have faith in God therefore take this scripture of Paul to do a combination of prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving to make our request be known unto God and tonight whatever request you have my brother my sister as we are praying you can also pray and say God inspir me what is more appropriate and you can also dedicate your time in Thanksgiving and say Lord for this demon of television pornography movies entertainment all these things I know it's just killing my time but your Bible said Redeeming the time because the days are evil Lord I know by watching all these things I'm going away from you and you will not be able to answer my prayers so therefore Lord if you take out this demon this is what I'm going to do or I can say Lord I'm going to spend one day for example I don't need anybody to serve you may go to pray I may go to do a service I may going to send spend my time to exalt somebody or I'm just going to go and clean up the church do something probably what I never been I never done before offering you this time for the sake of my prayer to be accompanied with Thanksgiving amen amen so Paul was in prison and he's speaking let us take Philippians chapter 4 from verse 10 U people will look at Paul is speaking Paul was saying I'm not doing this because I need favor of money or I need people to give me this but Paul was saying I am used to every condition under which God will put me if I'm in riches I praise God if I'm in poverty I praise God I'm not saying this talking about Thanksgiving for you to bring me gift Paul say no it's not about those gifts I am able to accommodate myself in every condition so I'm not doing this for the sake of getting any benefit of any so let us take Philippians chapter 4 uh reading from verse 10 but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last your care of me has flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity verse 11 not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am there weave to be I know both how to be a based and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer [Music] need Paul is rejoicing for the gift but he's telling the people don't you think I'm after your gift or after your money I'm used to every circumstance and I believe every servant of God will say the same criticism can come or his stressing out this and that but Paul said I'm doing this for your sake for your good and that's how people even in denominations you see somebody he maybe get blessed I'm going to offer uh maybe a car to the pastor I'm going to buy him maybe a suit or whatever it is I'm going to do this for my church maybe buy a new uh music instrument so there are many good opportunities that's why Paul is saying here as we read in verse 10 that you have this in your mind but you did not have the opportunity but me being in prison that gave you an opportunity so brother sister you may be having good thing I'm going to do I don't know what to offer God can give you an opportunity maybe sickness around youor can be sick opportunity yes somebody can take advantage of the opportunity to do something special somebody will miss also the opportunity it cannot be only for the pastor it can be a brother sister who can be in hospital he can have lost a family member it's an opportunity but we don't want to miss the opportunity all the time but when we have a prayer and supplication we have to thank God for the opportunity of Thanksgiving that's why James said in the Book of James 1:27 you can take it down 27 james7 that the pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the those in their Affliction it's an opportunity opportunity it's not all together to buy a suit to buy a pastor car so people know that the car was bought by so and so and Paul saying I'm not saying this for you to come and give to me because I am adapted in every condition poty I'm okay in riches I'm okay I'm content in every ccum circumstance and I'm saying this for the sake of helping somebody as Paul said I'm happy in every circumstance it's not just to beg for people's gift or whatever it is you do whatever you want to do but the word of God still is the word of God yes so Paul wanted people to visit him also in prison that's what as Christian we have to to do visit your brother in sickness visit your brother when he he has lost family member he's mour but you when you heard that brother has lost somebody you have no time for visit oh I'm working working working but the day will happen to you you will one complain the church we don't come to church to receive the Bible said in the book of act it's a joy to give them to receive you have to learn to give with Thanksgiving with your prayers and that's why Bram said we cannot have a complete service without passing the offering basket why brother said we don't bum for money but we pass the offering basket because giving is part of our religion and I'm not talking about regular offerings and tight and so forth I'm talking about Thanksgiving special offering amen amen let's continue to read uh as we are in the book of Philippians chapter 4 Philippians where we read up to verse 12 now let's take verse 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me not withstanding ye have well done that you did communicate with my Affliction Paul said in verse 14 that ye have well done to take part with my Affliction because the Bible said I was in prison you visit me not I was hungry you fed me not I was thirsty you did not drink give me drink I was sick you did not visit me whatever condition but here Paul if that's why when you read you take a study of a Bible stud Bible study if you understand the circumstances that will help you so here Paul said not withstanding verse 14 we have well done that you did communicate with my Affliction verse 15 now Paul praising the Philippians saying that you were the only people to come and take part of my in my need but you didn't see the colossian being mad or the the Corinthian being mad or theoni getting mad what we have done what we have done Paul is not talking about it he's talking only about the Philippians sometimes it's the devil Spirit speaking if somebody is being praised praise God for him and also pray that God give you the opportunity to be praised one day I think you are following me and you are in good spirit to understand the spirit so verse 15 Paul saying now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the Gospel when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving only Paul is mentioning Philippians ye only and he making allusion when I departed from Macedonia and if you look at the map Macedonia you see all those cities around so Paul left Macedonia cring until Philippi he did not notice as such thing as giving and receiving so let us be like Philippians that's why Paul is telling them when you pray combination with supplication also with Thanksgiving and verse 16 PA say for even in ye send once and again unto my necessity yes so Paul is saying even when in the Philippians you have taken care of me for my necessity not once but again so brother when you do the Thanksgiving it's not once but remember do it again and again verse 1 is saying not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound to your account amen amen so Paul is clear here and I think when I'm saying also I'm clear I'm not seeking gift to bring me money or whatever in saying so I desire fruit that may abound to your account because what you are giv is going into your account if the Bible say whosoever give a glass of water will be blessed how much more if you really give a Thanksgiving oh Pastor I heard thisor I feel like this we have a bunch of ministers in the church as well we have needy people also Among Us bless you you pay your whatever contribution you pay don't overlook Thanksgiving oh go see a brother go see a sister God has put this in my heart not young people going to give a gift to the sisters God has put this in my heart but behind your mind I'm this offering prayer with Thanksgiving but in your mind you are going to attract you want to attract the sister attention no not that so Verse 18 but I have all and abound and I'm full having receive of the things which were sent from you in order of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to God that's why Paul is saying I have received ofus that the good brother the thing which were sent from you that Paul said I've received it with like a good order PA did not refuse or reject things because he has plenty said but I have all and abound I am a full but I've received of epaphroditus the think which were sent from you as a order of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable sacrif AC well pleasing to God but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen amen so that's really what Paul had in mind to serve god with uh offering Thanksgiving Etc and also so in the book of Philippians chapter 2 Paul is telling people whenever you do those things do it freely don't feel any pressure that's why he said Philippians 2 verse4 do all things without murmuring and disputing don't give the pastor and he doesn't see this economy things are critical God knows but God also use Paul to speak to us amen amen so the more the better sacrifice the the sacrifice God will see that you give with a pure heart and God is going to bless you and Paul wrote the things in reference to his situation to his condition and uh being in a need in a prison because Paul could not do much but if you read other writings of Paul Paul was working and he said I'm not coming to you as a beggar and Paul was saying also to the Thessalonians that you have to work don't be uh and somebody who doesn't want to work don't don't let him eat at the mercy of somebody you are grown up enough even you live with your parents you are working help them out contribute and they see the people I want to get married yeah when you get married your money you will be sharing with your wife you start working you never even buy a a suit to your own dad a suit to your mother that's why people who come I want to get married I want to get married have you what you have done so far for your parents if you have not done anything I know it's going to be a conflict between you and maybe your family and your wife when you they will see your wife dressing up and your mother looking this boy if he knew this pain I went through with his in his life when I say ask something nothing listen young people before you can get married this an opportunity to help to do something also for your family yes that's the gospel you are unable to abstain to their needs and but you come always I want to get married when they say wait no no no no that's why we find more trouble in marriages that was not the subject but uh let me close up uh this short exhortation that I titled prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving uh to stress out a little bit Thanksgiving and my prayer God to inspire you to find something every time you have a hardship something special for the advancement of God kingdom not all together about money but it can be also other type of gift and uh maybe also your time Etc to be spent for the advancement of the gospel take time to go witness to somebody for example if you can win a soul for the for God that will not be forgotten by God amen amen may God bless you so let us get on our knees or whatever position is more convenient for you uh to pray As we sing this song Pass Me Not Pass Me Not gentle in my humble

everything that is there in so that father it can help us with our walk you have put in us this the desire to dedicate this time for prayer to stress out prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving Inspire your people for Thanksgiving and I know the spirit could not speak in vain you have seen that many of our prayers and supplication are lacking Thanksgiving and that's the reason why maybe father we don't get what we are asking [Music] for and father we are very very conscious this during this time of Crisis many don't have jobs many have lost jobs their hours has been cut but this is the time you have chosen for us to speak on the things and you are the only one who know the reason behind and you know whom you want to exalt and father in everything let your will be done we don't want just to give because we have to do without Revelation but I pray that you touch every person who's going to listen to this [Music] recording to receive it positively for their own benefit for their own fruit as Paul said help them Father as we pray for the situation in the world with this uh sickness father that you open doors you make this burden become easier for your people being locked

work their own businesses to make it always uh Prosper regardless of the time to bless it to bless their clients and bless also the authority of the country in whatever they are trying to maintain the economy and we pray father for those seeking jobs to help them you see their Promises of [Music] Thanksgiving father Grant it those who are sick who need healings with with Thanksgiving father answer their prayers those looking for babies those looking for marriages you are the one who can give the real marriage not men given marriage which will result in strife and fights all the time but you
