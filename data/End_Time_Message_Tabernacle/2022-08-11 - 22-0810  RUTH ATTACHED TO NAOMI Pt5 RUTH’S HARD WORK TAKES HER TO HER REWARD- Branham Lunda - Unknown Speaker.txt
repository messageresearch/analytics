happened not knowing what will happen later on bro i always like to take the example of the three evil children the two evil children took a decision permanent defeat freelancer as a challenge was given i like the way the true evil children have decided whether burnham said luiki express he's the one explaining the bible said chadrak misha abednego he said sunday they said to themselves their will shall not bow down because we trust even if he doesn't deliver us sir do you see that and then still no delivery even if he doesn't deliver us from the furnace we shall not bow down anyhow amen

then before may come to some definite i said for me but once we [Applause] and one day in heaven you are the recompense there will be a world perspective those rewards are dependent will depend of the service the work that you have done that is what i want to emphasize tonight he says a shack pastor and every pastor sarah will see a victim we'll be also there with his group is the one who represent the age sealant if it goes in the pasta and the pasta luis on two also in eastern illustrious souvenirs just remember it's with me i always imagine that is why my brother no devon come on we have to start heaven upon the earth the songs of redemption the heaven will shake when the heaven and the angel will be ash tonight why these people are so excited let's join with the songs ocean let's join with the songs [Music] surrounding the throne i don't know just imagine how [Music] [Applause] [Music] can we say amen to this amen i see you work seriously seriously allah therefore so that you can take advantage of it don't go anywhere else i've heard what you did with your mother-in-law naomi hey metana comedy as you see and now since you're here on the [Music] is of uh willing let's show a vast at the field is very wide is seeking for services if we have decided to come to the uh the boers field we you have to have a church amen amen you have to have a home church and you have to consider that as your own church as your own home and livestock we're going to read it just to give lucian the boa in the boar's field don't forget boaz types christ field of boys is the message the words and stars and this word has instances cometh israel as israel that living egypt moses has the word diamonds but god told moses just build the tabernacle she even amen amen says this a paragraph of spirit paragraph 18 president uh militia assad illinois he says this is discernment of spirits says sister it's you're right shaq om devre avoir in negligence every man how to have a church where he feels home not just floating above from pillow to post how many people did you a man people of god are many pools amen the blood of jesus you can't be toasting about florida you gotta have a place in the church but a place somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church you have support the cause amen amen therefore you can't be floating from one place to another i'm just here for the meantime let's make reports next wednesday i will be attending another church i'm just going there i listen okay next sunday and the next sunday it's over there [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] one with another vout la valle in the grand court are you working for a great cause that's the cause of christ i think that's absolutely true i think that's absolutely true i'm in a glaze amen to the church there's a reason why siddhi if god we don't end with a purpose he gave you a new people that you never knew before as ruth and your hard work certainly certainly was we'll take you to the road the man of god preached here we had special meetings and i know you work hard without the work of ruth is very great but there are things that we undermine can i speak to you from my bottom of my heart amen amen some people think to really work i have to be a preacher don't read this something's even saying what's happening with god second we should do city city city pressure it's today if you preach to someone set personally that person is converted god convert the person and it's filled with the holy ghost he comes to church he becomes a solid member and he also him is in the flesh he preaches he brings someone we uncover something in his discernment that's why the minister shouldn't pay attention how many people just simple they just have to preach how god is leading them to preach amen amen basket because can't you press when you preach you know separate you don't know come from and i'm religious organizations she did everything there was no choice maybe the preacher said he could indulge in am i gonna do it imagine it yes sir imagine you're just by yourself a little musician i don't know if she rented the musicians i don't know may i pray but afterwards i praise have a commercial pleasure after preaching i felt long so i said that anointing touched the creature the preacher preached as there was a lot of people wait forever bananas you got called you to preach precious employment just preach but may disappear because it's even from the stone guy can we raise any the anointing of pressure and the preacher said he came to give his life to jesus and the preacher the preaching was made is that little man i gave to his life to christ that little man was converted in that little man louie he had a gift he was a preacher a question what happened the campaign the the campaign was over maybe uh equals to ten thousand souls at ten thousand world a plethora and later on set on last session that little guy agrande allah grew up in the face yeah baptism in the holy ghost that is why the purpose of the prophet the purpose of the preacher to be really saved just one soul see dialogue he god fills him with the word and he saves the person he has done a great job it's a psychopath that's what paul was doing he can stay if he leaves [Music] [Music] is he the preacher or the old lady amen amen they recognize it's very important to recognize your position it's important to recognize who you are in christ and to work knowing that i'm doing this work for god no papa calcutta not for somebody not just to influence anyone and partake in justice is the celebrity will be rewarded that's not all you have precious people who preached under the anointing without any worse anybody who would be rewarded that's not all that gave her money too she won she wins everything amen amen amen there's a little work that we have asked because god will reward us at the end of the journey means per second what if you don't underestimate what you're doing amen amen amen a preacher that would preach vulnerability you don't know the things that you will say under the anointing they influence the impact that would do it in one source somewhere you just give yourself to god when god will use your gift personally now he can save us you don't know the world will come to you a brother that will sing that's why everything that we don't will come down amen amen season what shall tell you if i have to sing generally i have to sing in such a way that's your song when i sing yes even god will be happy about it as i was saying she said batman if it's this building we can't afford to pay it it means one thing will i'm the money to pay the mortgage they don't want to pay questions what god would do no shall we reward us do the work willingly we fear and conquer as ruth did amen amen knowing that our reward is not from the men upon the earth that is why i always say to your position always ask that today was you you didn't preach well do you want to tell me every time it was he was always good yeah basket brother say one time he started maybe one time when the spirit when anointing to attack the scene maybe that day that that day will go out and everybody will be looking away because today it was coming they went there to the judgment crucify him of the year man of god affair to wait for clapping we're working for boasts and i [Music] that we have that's what i told you uh that's what brother bonham says when roots started working with uh he started giving her instructions don't go anywhere else i even told him i charged my servant my reapers when they will work if only they can one day they will leave internet instead of uh picking them in the board's field because i can be assured okay even if i'm mistaken she works so hard in the bose field that revenge 90 percent she she should be a good girl ain't no partner larry mcconnell no somewhere here on the street traffic i want this thing not to be here you focus as well you want you should move it second shadow what i have to do i will obey what the pastor says amen amen a musician that's singing something a paranoid his life is not right the person comes and says brother can you sit down a little bit if you're a ruth you won't give up you won't ask questions why is there doing it why why written a possibility ruth doesn't ask questions stay here yeah don't go anywhere else [Applause] amen amen [Music] you have to have the obedience in your heart amen amen jesus christ if i'm a minister i know my limit amen amen amen if i sing and the person says the obedience lead someone to the adoption amendment amen we have been work obeying the message today and tomorrow it comes uh he comes right away a predator service after two three services i was a great singer was in the denomination you see him you see him coming this is a disorder dear i mean lord my god has said in order that's the reason why ruth has to follow talent revolution because she went there on the wheel working for boston working in the field mayor president after working she received all this without any doubt boaz was writing down everything that they said to here [Music] when we go back do it amen amen because we're talking about the work of ruth james you know they will never talk about this mission without talking about you they will never mention about this mission without talking about you can use that it means we have a play to a part to play in the plan of redemption if we are part of that plane foreign joining the church it's not all i believe that every person should stand at the post of duty or join the church amen amen we have to be balanced with all our feet standing because there are two schools something venirele you are saved by the blood of jesus based upon your confession after being saved christ our voice throughout you neglect will lead you to choosing for me you enter in the church in a family where you that's why he said uh joining the church is fine jay crockett i believe that every person should stand at the post of duty and when they passed the preaching of the evangelist who kelly kendall or something like that ella anthony depression he's preaching japan personally [Applause] with everything they got in them avex edema with the tight sesophant with the offering if but don't let that just be on the only thing get inoculated just say devotee that's what i'm trying to say the holy ghost and the rest of will come upon it and go together and to support this cause with the titan offering with everything that can be done in the church and if it happens that your pastor asked you to do something i advise you said the lord you should do it the past asked me to preach foreign do it willingly beloved jd okay i just say i would do it that's the day i tested it i was sick i came here and i said is they will take you to things when you ask for quotes and then they will tell you jesus i'm led to tell you this then i found out they're just hiding stuff and i told them be sure if your pastor is saved or not it should be assured if he has the holy ghost or not if he has the holy spirit and you sure it's amazing because her god has to reveal oh my god but why are you saying that i told them paul or paul b in the bible he preached the coincidence and then he said what i'm going to say because it wasn't coming from god imagined but why was he written in the bible we reached the point certainly i believe to have the holy ghost awesome successful messenger that's very hard but it's not always telepathic it's not enough it's a new testament this is the new testament i said let's go back to the others moses died joshua [Applause] is uh and you have to repeat what moses says eliza eve agerico and the only way to win the battle is to repeat what moses said that was written about why joshua then hillard open he told the people men are you see now pakistan you're not going to repeat what is written easy yeah where was he written in the book think of moses oh us that's a phone oh this is very very powerful yes it's really hard it's because you don't understand josue joshua who was a man of god in irreconcilable if you only have what is written son let's put a second avenger having the spirit of whom the three that is why we have a whole bunch of stuff is joshua joshua in jericho because it's god who led them to settle down the leadership of god in joshua to go around jericho yeah sitting in my mountain if you show me this coach i'll believe you over here come on you see how we are going to premiere i told him the first thing reconnected you are first to recognize your past is the man of [Music] my family and my wife and she said for example boswell bill oh good evening bill boswell good evening er news occ we are also here uh new zealand priya family we prayed with the children and i put them to bed a new summer and now we're here forever what abandonment said consciently when i'm reading that what mary is saying hallelujah hallelujah he says i'm just trying to understand what medicine black and white never received one less privilege you have to receive the spirit of god the revelation coming from god second letter this is a love letter situation that they made if you read the letter of matter whatever you say right now but for brothers since he knew he knows his wife he's dreaming between the lines hallelujah isaac and then afterwards elijah says i don't know how i'm going to find this for which i'll ask the water give me the water messy helmet but if by ourselves she can read what is inside my heart i lost your soul then i will know yes the wife for isaac amen amen can [Applause] notice the in the old bible you see after work [Applause] wanted says send me sir this message says it's a love letter god wrote things you need this spirit away they are there for that lesson we have to follow the instructions even the evangelist even someone someone else when he's preaching or doing something it takes every one of us to be in his presuppose of jesus that's also amen we don't really see it there's a work of rules we support the word si cella veritas this is the truth i say amen are you know better panda can you press one time when he was preaching really did and then he says do you remember that brother said he said amen the one that was singing amen for hallelujah hallelujah your work vortex exhortation your exaltation the work of god will reward you for that okay what kind of work shall we do the work is great and they all the the suteni la coste

level and the widows in the affliction preserve them and to keep himself transported from the world yeah vanu recompense yeah we reward us for this today we have forgotten this happens sometimes it seems like they are the one that have to sweep the church to clean the church say it's good telephone if that by doing it they'd know that they were doing it as ruth to uh for god melanie but the mission of the church when they survived it they have to take good care of those widows and officers you know when brother is talking about the rules of the match he's taking the scripture the sheep and the the the coat goats 33 and he shall say the sheep on his right hand by the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them that are on his right hand venezuela benitez come here blessed of
