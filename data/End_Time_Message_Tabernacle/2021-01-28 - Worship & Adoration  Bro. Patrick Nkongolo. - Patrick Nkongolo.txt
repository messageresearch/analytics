to be disconnected from all the worldly things they were saying they connected the shows monday and to take the going away seriously one of these days the decision people will stay as a prophet as what upon i was talking about the pearl harbor they called me pearl harbor what happened with the japanese how they destroy america is america and branham said it's the same thing with the church

with the denomination those fanatics of william branham he said financing the william branham it's going to be too late for them but brother sister don't let this be too late for you hold up i'm exhausting you is exactly to wake up and to clean up your life people wanted to avov and to reject all the unnecessary things in some necessity and build yourself on fire ahead of me unfair because if
