know that we are not worthy but because of what you did there on Calvary Let each and every one of your children tonight be purified and Washed by the blood of Jesus Christ so that our worship pleases you Lord bless this moment of [Music] preaching we need you we know an intellectual person can read but we want the dynamic the Holy [Music] Spirit he that gives life and the understanding of your word and know us for this moment and be with our pastor where he is as you're going to anoint him and bless him remember us as well and your bride around the glob bless the reading of the word as we commit this moment to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen we are going to read the word of God as we are still standing we are going to read in the Book of Luke chapter 22 Luke Luke 22 we are going to start in verse uh 39 PR fortifier an agon on Temptation amen amen and he came out and went as he was want into the Mount of Olives and the disciple also followed him and when he was at the place and he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from the them about a stone cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and they appeared a in Angel unto him from Heaven strengthening and being in the agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was was as it as was as he were great drop of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciple he found them sleeping for S and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation still in Luke the next chapter 23 we are going just to take one verse verse 31 there it's written for if they do this things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry thank you very much you may be seated I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are happy to be in the presence of God we thank God for his infinite grace for every day his renews his strength his uh goodness every day giving us good health we thank him for that I also want to thank the pastor for this opportunity that he has given me to speak to you the bread of Jesus Christ we thank him so much we don't have much time we trying to maximize our time I don't know if I'll be able to say everything but may God help us so that I'll be short are you happy to be in the house of God are you happy I know it's Friday you know many Christian believe that it's a good on Good Friday that he was crucified maybe people sad they think about what [Music] happened I'm so also happy because I see today people came uh in great number in the church and I believe the Lord Jesus Will Bless You amen amen you know Muslims they are very serious in their religions when they have Ramadan they you see them fasting and you see them going to work but still fasting and they observe every instruction given to them yet they don't have the truth that we have but in this moment as for the Easter it's the time that true Christian can even forsake his work and come because this is even the meaning of Christianity Catholic church and other denomination the the the the the celebrate uh Christ crucifixion we know well in that our scene here when he went up to that mountain called [Music] Olive after coming with a great uh feast in Jerusalem he was sitting on the the the on the top of the because it was the time of Passover he have to enter great uh Triumph in Jerusalem while he was eating Jesus was speaking to disciple the suffering that will come very soon and that night Jesus went away to that mountain and the disciple followed him and when he got there he started praying he prayed prayed again he knew what he was waiting he was expecting he prayed never before to the point where an angel came to comfort him after you understood what would happen in his life he understood that it was a time to die for the all [Music] Humanity every sin that is been [Applause] committed either by Christian or pagans the the sin of the every disease every sickness every wrong thing happening all that was upon him and it was so heavy and while he was praying he felt that suffering to the point when when he was praying the tears become like a blood he suffered so much when he was praying to the point where he said oh Lord father possible take away that cup take away that suffering from me it's painful but in reality he didn't have to die because he didn't he didn't do anything wrong was holy holy holy the Lord of hosts he never committed any sin but here he gave himself to as a sacrifice for the sins of all of us because the because the law was saying when Adam sinned the Lord was saying they saw that that sin the same shall die for that soul to be brought back it took the very same kind of Adam there was no one under born in under that could take the place of Adam to claim the Lost race of that is why God Of Heaven the great elim the one who existed by himself he he came became flesh to and he was given the name of emuel and the Lord Jesus Christ was 100% God and was 100% man here in this scripture while he was praying there in GE that was the manaying you cannot kill God you cannot kill God Jesus was 100% he had to go to the anointing left him the father left him that is why here as a man he started feeling the pain he started understanding that it's hard that is why he was able to say if it possible father nevertheless not my will done be done why he accepted it because he didn't have any choice because he loved you because he loves us before the foundation of the world he saw us and there was nobody to take that place he had to do it now the Bible just told us we will discover things that we have done I know those are things that we already know we won't have time to go deep because I know we already know these things if they did this things to Jesus who is a green tree what will happen to the dry tree if Jesus went through all this suffering him who was 100% man 100% God but God did not spare him if he had to enjoy that there is a cross for you and mine amen amen get speaking of thinking about the test and trials it was what brother called the final test for a son of God and each and every one of us has a test amen amen you know life is complicated tests or trials can come in various ways in our trials there's one thing that comforted me so much when Jesus was feeling the pain the suffering the Bible says an angel came to him to comfort him amen amen an angel came to comfort him why because when somebody's going through hardship God had to send an angel to comfort him trials are in various ways a single person like me you can think you need to get married single person has his own trials while he's single he lives the way he wants to live he has certain Tri if I can only get married uh my tri will be over but them that are married maybe you gain the marriage a comes it become hard to have kids it's a for you it's a for you but while you single maybe you want to get married you want to seek for a husband or a wife it doesn't come it doesn't come so quickly single person that spend long time waiting everyone has his own somebody can have a lot of money and you can say if I canar I can only have money but despite the money that he doesn't have certain things that you don't you have in life there's always various trials in your life that's why you don't have to compare one another be satisfi the way God is leading you somebody can eny somebody I want to be country if I can only have money maybe if you have a lot of money you will backslide you won't be in the church anymore we won't even recognize your Cor in different things sometime God can release a spirit a sickness a disease can come on you you pray and pray as if God doesn't listen but there's a good news God sent an angel to Jesus an angel to strengthen you amen amen no matter the trials and test God always takes care give me the message fellowship or communion communion bam is showing us you know trials and test when Jesus was feeling What would happened to him as a human being he said this I cannot take it but never let your will be done and for him it was the final test said if God didn't SP the Lord Jesus himself April 18 19 paragraph 22 22 okay now no this great hour has approached our Lord one of the most trying time of all of his he joury was just a [Music] hand broken English don't mind my broken English you can read along with me and he said testing time Jesus had to go through testing just as we go through testing do you see that Jesus go to tting as we go toting the Bible said that every son that come to God must first be tested trained corrected now many people is it a showdown when the testing time comes it is a time of a uh providing place and the Bible says if we cannot stand the testing then we become illegitimate children we are professing God to be our father and then he's not our father for if we have correctly and with all of our heart received the Lord Jesus as our personal savior there is nothing in this earth or in all dark eternity can ever separate us from the love of God that is Christ Jesus amen amen amen amen that was the final test for Jesus we all going through the same testes paragraph 24 it's different it's different I'm using uh the voice of God version okay let's continue 24 I'm ased in this day and have always been when people profess to be Christian and the first little try come on they fall by wise side it goes to show that it was intellectual conception of Christ that's the reason so many doesn't hold out today is because it intellectual conception intellectually you could believe it but it goes further than that to accept Christ is to accept the person of Christ amen when the test comes [Music] as the Bible says trials are precious more than gold when God is sending us through he has a purpose you know God knows us better it's not trials comes to kill us trials will come but you shall not die has a purpose for everything that you're going through God can send you to the bed of Affliction so that when he's going to heal you you will have something to tell the devil that God [Applause] Amen continues by saying in the same mess paragraph 28 and Jesus was here conforting the greatest test that he had ever had getson him where that once a h once and final all CZ test must come where the burden of entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder there was no one in all Heaven and Earth could ever stop him and to know that all of the sins listen to this and to know that all of the sins of the past and the present and the future rested upon his decision so if he didn't make that decision then we don't have any forgiveness praise God and it was one of the most greatest victory that Christ ever [Music] won Pro his [Applause] gra M and words he said that to [Laughter] God my will that be done oh my that was the greatest Victory he has ever won all the demon of T was around to T him and to try him and when he get right and when we get right with God when our hearts become pure and the Holy Ghost has taken its place in our hearts it's the most glorious thing to have testing the Bible tell us that our testing and trials are more precious to us than silver and gold in this world so we are should be [Music] thankful let somebody tell God Lord I Thank you for my trials amen hallelujah I thank you for the trials I know behind the trials you know Jesus suffered so much he accepted the he was the holiest of hly he was more than the than he was more than the queen of Britain but he didn't look at his quality his position but he accepted the shame to the point where the King of Kings the creator of heav died on the cross naked amen he died there stripped naked why God had a purpose to save you and I you know after that oh beloved when Tri comes it true hurts brother I know I I I'm not saying that you cannot cry you can you can weep but if there's something in you in the midst of Trials will send way and you come out of it you will not know the same God that visited Jesus because he accepted [Music] philian you receive the name above all the names to the point where even in heaven in heaven on the the all the knees shall bow in the name of the one who died it was the way God has provided said I also had my I didn't even do my introduction I'm just giving my first thought these are very wonderful things when was thinking about it I said Thank You Lord God knows and to answer prayers why if we read more the word of God I'm telling you angel will visit us and many problem will be [Applause] easy maybe certain problem becomes hard because we don't bring about the presence of God Among Us say I'm in the same message do not wish to bring my my own self into some experience but just as it come on my mind I remember the great and final test that I had on my Christian experience I will go fast you know that test sent him to the Pentecostals and the Mother-in-law brother and they were [Music] Baptist she didn't want brother bham to take her daughter to the Pentecost butam with the love that he had for hope he tried to believe that and one day he started believing what the Mother-in-law was telling him and God was not happy God had to bring brother to the test I'm about to talk about and one dayon came to brother Bam's wife started suffering I believe it was in when there was a storm [Applause] there prayed prayed he didn't work and they took the the wife to the hospital and when she was taken to the hospital loved so much he prayed he said Lord please I know we did forgive us said it was like a black sheep God didn't want to pay attention and was somewhere fishing they the she's in at the hospital there's nothing something wrong got he found hope hope was dying prayed hope Lord please let Hope leave bring her back hope open her eyes when she opened her eyes she said honey you know why I'm going right because before you die you know where you're going that is why brothers and sisters it's good to be serious here on the earth if I'm a Christian let me not be a Christian so people can see me let me be a Christian in my heart conv because before you die you will know where you going they know where they go and you disturbed me you know the story it will take me a while if I talk about it and hope died while hope was was dead the the child Sharon the little daughter of 6 month or 9 month the germs as the mother was giving the the breastfeeding the doctor came she said Reverend Brenham there's no hope for your your daughter said what don't tell me this doctor he there's no hope it's over we try to check on her we found out it's the same germs that she got from her mother those kind of germs where did you put her she's somewhere there don't go there because if you go to see her if you touch her will leave sharing remember you still have another child you will contaminate another [Music] [Music] you're not going to take her right I'm sure you're not going to take my little baby you're not going to take her her mother lord said it was as if there was a black as if God was not even paying attention was in such a state a condition in this message and I paragra 33 communion in the same message the fellowship or communion I went down on my knees with the door closing the doctor hinder him I didn't want him to go where the child was the heart of a father he still went there he KN down and started praying and he said oh god father oh there there Li lay my wife the baby's mom mother laying y in the there is Billy Paul on the bed sick and here is my baby dying you Lord won't take her I love her and she resemble her mother I want to raise her want to please oh God spare my baby's life and I look upon and you all know I've always been subject to Vision it seems like a black Shake begin to unfold coming down and as if God took my prayer and throw it right back in my [Music] face what a trial and I said what have I done God have I transgressed your laws that I should have this punishment if it is you just Reve and I will repent I will do anything but don't take my baby and I see she was going anyhow still despite all his prayers it was if theay was just turning it was going nowhere and he knew the baby was going and then and listen the come to me there was the one time in all my life that I can call was the critical the moment when I was just barely holding to the bed the devil said there you are that's the r for trying to serve him you mean that he will take that your 22 years old mother and her and her in the and will take the precious baby your own flesh and blood and slam your prayer right in your face and then you mean to say that you will save him are you with me brother was the pray going nowhere he understood the child and the devil came you were telling people it was you telling people preaching you serving him and then you want to tell me the same God that you left your wife dying and your baby will die again and you will still serve him and listen I was standing between opinion it had to be decided then I put my hand over on her little and I said the Lord and the love take away blessed be the name of the Lord and I felt relief amen amen oh beloved if that doesn't happen to you a tri that is why when we confort one another if you never failed went through the same trial you can make fun of your brother if you went through the same trial you know how to comfort your brother said Daddy cannot go where you are now can come someday I will Li on you lay on you on the arm of your mom and bury you that Daddy will see you again while that thing happened there was a friend of brother bam Mr brother Mr Isler one day they was with brother bam this uh pay attention to this paragraph paragraph 40 okay you go yeah down okay I will continue driving his old Tru jumped out and put his arm around the friend of was driving a truck around that time he put his arm around brother he started telling brother bham the devil loves that he always seeking for thatal he knows that you're getting weak he can play around with you though you weak your God will not leave you put his arm on me and say I hear you preaching on the street corner I've seen you

your brother your wife even your daughter that God is still good and I say Mr if he will send me to the region of the [Music] lost I will still love him this is a fighter beloved we didn't believe this message we didn't believe in God so that everything can work we believe in God because we in his thought going back to his mind promised us eternal life it's not because things are not working devil shake me no matter I didn't believe in God because of I didn't believe in God with condition there were three Hebrew children they were in the trial when the time came they were to be thrown in the furnace Fire And while they were walking to the furnace sh could tell did you pray well brother he said yes I prayed said is everything he said all is well while they were burning it again there heat they were telling to each is everything okay did you check your life there's no issue he said yes said the King was saying I will show these people that I'm a king said he forgot another king sueme while they were moving for when they got there even the same people that came they were burned and they got I love the way the children Hebrew children took God by his word somebody came to tell them brothers are you going to AC goship listen the way they answer they said we know we will not bow down before the statue and they say what [Music] we know our God to us from furnace but they that has to be a True Believer they said even if he doesn't Deliver us are you there are you there even if he doesn't deliver I will not bow [Applause] down the statue looking for Fighters you didn't believe God to give him conditions today message is changing h brother you got to have Fai yes I refuse to die yes I refuse it but if God sees it's over I'm done I will still go greatest blessing is theal life amen amen and you know when those children get there they were decided to the point where no matter what they said we will not let go and the same angel I believe the same angel that appeared to Jesus I believe in the same angel that got in the furnace and he cool down the furnace brother they are angels said when we going through hardship always the same way God sent an angel to Jesus I pray that God send you an angel you know one day was and that test took long he was waiting for a child God was visiting him he wasn't coming you prayed a lot for that sickness for that problem maybe that God really exist yes God exists brother is as real as I'm standing here says this message I've heard but not I see said paragraph 72 he's saying this as Abraham in Genesis 17 he was 80 years 80 years old God appeared to that old man of 89 years old while he was almost 100 years old he waited all these years the uh fulfillment of the promise but he could not do anything and appeared to him El sh in the name of el Shai El sh El Shai the breasted one what an [Applause] encouragement yet the promise wasn't fulfilled but Abraham I am the almighty God amen [Music] amen strength tonight help Jesus gives you strength be discouraged [Music] after after and decided there's no way to refuse maybe God gives you through trials you know I understand that happened that was negative but they gave me a character let the tri gives you a character if God sees that you have no patience he can send you a trial so you can have patience and after that oh time is flying and after that I will jump a lot of stuff after this time of trial just when after praying he came down he found the disciple sleeping and then he said wake up why you all sleeping this is the time to pray brother prayer it's something that can change things you know the prayer it's one of the thing that the devil fights a lot that weakens [Music] him he fights us a lot so that we cannot he find them there sleeping he said wake up why are you sleeping he told them why you sleeping wake up Watch and Pray why you praying they may not fall into temptation amen amen when Temptation comes your if he finds you in your prayer life you are in you will walk on the temptation and after those things Jesus said wake up because the one that will betray me com you know it was Judas I know we know the story I'm just trying to take it as the Holy Ghost when the those people they came high priest [Music] Elders people that were strict they know all the laws of Moses the same people religious people they will take Jesus and took him to pilate and they took Jesus to the governor they got to the [Music] governor the governor asked the question to Jesus are you the king of Jews Jesus didn't answer anything and then he told them are you the Son of God J didn't say anything and the Bible says the governor was astonished and after that they took him there and they took him somewhere El and after being Jud you know the story when the governor found out that Jesus was innocent he tried to wash his hand off I'm innocent of this man I'm innocent despite that the blood of Jesus was still on his hands and he said he said what can I do to have this uh Uprising I will take uh a br or tug to to get rid of Jesus since this man didn't do anything I will take Barabas and I'll ask the crowd who them you want to be crucified since the scripture had to be fulfilled they took baras are the thing that you know I'm running they present them each of these two you want to be released just release Barbers and Jesus said what shall we do about this everybody was saying crucify [Applause] him and since they saw that the uprising would kept on going after sming the the road they took a Thor the crown of thones and listen this again him the king the Bible says obedient he did not open his mouth he was right he didn't do anything they took the crown of thones they put him on him it was so painful they spit on his face and they told him they they put something on his somebody came and smacked him if you are really the son of God tell us who did this Jesus didn't answer anything Jesus
