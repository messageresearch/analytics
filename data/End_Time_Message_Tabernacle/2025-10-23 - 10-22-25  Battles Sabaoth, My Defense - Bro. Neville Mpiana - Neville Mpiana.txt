Thank you, musician, the song leader. uh these songs that has been sang it goes along with uh my title tonight. Uh we would like to thank the pastor for this opportunity. Uh without further delay, let's open our Bible in the book of Ephesians &gt;&gt; chapter 6 from verse 11 verse 16. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11. The Bible says, "Put on the whole arm of God that you may be able to stand against the devil." &gt;&gt; For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against power, Against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take up unto you the whole arm of God that you may be able to stand with stand the evil day and having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girded about with the truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet showed with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above all, taking the shield of faith where wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fear fury dots of the wicked and take the emit of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in spirit spirit and watching there day unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. Let's also read in the book of second Corinthian or we can just read in the book of Psalm to save some time. Uh 91 Psalm 91 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. &gt;&gt; I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress, my God in him will I trust. Surely it shall deliver thee from the snare of the fall and from the knowome pestilence. And under his wings shall thy trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that fly fly by day. Nor for the pestilent that walketh in the darkness, nor for the destruction that wasted at noon day. A thousand shall fall fall at thy side, and 10,000 at thy right hands, but it shall not come near thee. Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. &gt;&gt; Because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge, even the most high thy habitation. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come n thy dwelling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he shall give his angel charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways. Thou shall bathe thee up the hands, lest thash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and other the young lion and the dragon shall thou trample under the feet. &gt;&gt; Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him. I will set him on high because he has known my name. He shall call upon me and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And show him my salvation. Amen. Let's &gt;&gt; our precious heavenly father once again we standing in your presence. We thank you for this opportunity that you have given me to stand before your people. I'm nothing, Father God, but I'm counting on you. You know the needs of your people. You know what they're facing. You know the battles that they're going through. I pray father God you the God the Lord of hosts come and fight our battles come be with us father tonight as we're going through this little encouragement. May may this be an encouragement for somebody so that at the end of this service we can say that as they that were coming from the emas our heart was now burning within ourselves as he was speaking to us along the way. Bless this word we commit everything at your hands in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Uh tonight I just have a little encouragement. &gt;&gt; Hopefully I'm going to be able to finish on time so we can have time to pray. &gt;&gt; Uh I want to entitle it sab &gt;&gt; my defense. &gt;&gt; My defense. &gt;&gt; Sab Jehovah Sab &gt;&gt; my defense. &gt;&gt; My defense. &gt;&gt; They marry in battles. We we you know the the the sab is it just simply means &gt;&gt; the lord of hosts &gt;&gt; the lord of armies &gt;&gt; the army heavenly army &gt;&gt; is mighty in battle is my defense is only my rock &gt;&gt; and my salvation is my defense He is my strength. He fight battle that I cannot fight. He fight my battles. Is the voice of the voiceless. He fight battles that I cannot see. When you cannot fight, he can stand for you. He's your defense lawyer. When you cannot defend yourself, God defend for you. Amen. Amen. The Bible says some trust in the chariots. Some trust in the chariots, some trust in the money, some trust in the horses, some trust in the strength. But we will remember the name of the Lord. We trust in the Lord because he's Jehovah. He fights our battles. We don't rely on our own strength. We don't rely on somebody else. We rely in the name of the Lord. We rely on Jehovah Sabath. He fight our battles. Amen. The Bible add their trust in the chariots. &gt;&gt; They are brought down and fallen. But we are risen and we stand. Amen. He fight the battles that comes at night. He fight the battle that comes in the day. Thousand shall fall on your right side. 10,000 on your left side, but you shall not be touched because Sabath is your defense. Sabio is your strength. He's your shield. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they accuse you without cause, when they hate you without reason, fight for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I might not have what they have, but I have you. You fight my battles. &gt;&gt; I might not have the millions of this world, but I have Sab. He fights my battles. [Music] Amen. In the battle that we are fighting, the prophet says, "We are not a match for the devil. We are not at the level of the devil. The devil is a great force. The devil is a great power. But he that is in us. Sabath that is in us is greater. He's bigger than he that is in the world. We trust in Sabath. We trust in the Lord of host, the Lord of h our Sabbath. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. In the reading that we read, the Bible says, "We are now wrestling against flesh and blood." We are now wrestling against flesh and blood. But we are battling against the heavenly power. You can now look at your neighbor and say, "You are now my enemy. Your wife is now your enemy." Because you are now battling against flesh and blood. You are now battling against flesh and blood. Your husband is not your enemy. Your brother is not your enemy. We wrestle against not against flesh and blood. Knowing your enemy. Identify your enemy is the first thing to do in a battle. Remember we are in the battle. Who is then your enemy? If you miss to identify your enemy, you will you will waste your strength even fight your ally. So you have to identify your enemy. You have to know who is the enemy. The Bible say we are not wrestling against not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. We are sown therefore in the battles. We are soldiers. The prophet say we are not in the picnics. &gt;&gt; We are in a battleground. We are not in a vacation. We are in a battleground. The prophecy in the message Satan Eden paragraph 13. I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten to you the promise of God. See something not something that somebody else was in some other day. Them things are all all right. Them things are all right. We are referred to those things. But I thought I will try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written here that I would enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier to make you a better soldier in the field that you are fighting now. make you a better soldier in the battle that you are fighting now to to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you. That's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can. The prophet used to be a boxer. &gt;&gt; So he's telling us the defense techniques to win the battle. To win a battle fight, you have to keep the punches off of you. As much as you can, the more punches you get, the weaker you get, the weaker you become. So the best way to win the battle is to keep the bunches off of you to dodge them as much as you can. So the best defense is to attack. The best defense is to attack. Don't wait to be attacked. Don't wait to be attacked. Don't let the enemy attack you because the more punches you get, the weaker you become. In 67 and Israel war, they did not wait for Arab country to attack them, but they attacked first because they were greater in numbers. So, Israel knew the best defense was to attack. Don't wait to be attacked. Attack first. That's why tonight we are going to attack first. We are soldiers. We are warriors. People runs. People run at the first attack. You know civilians run at the first attack. But the problem in the message today, people are so weak. People are now soldiers. The problem in the church today, we are not soldiers. That God doesn't want any cowards. God is looking for soldiers. People that cannot run at the first attack, at the first punches. You know in South Africa, there was a great man called Zulu. Shakazulu. Shakazulu. Some of you know him. Shakazulu was a leader of the tribe. He did not want soldiers. &gt;&gt; He did not want soldiers. He did not want soldiers. He did not want soldiers that had wound in the back because that meant you that meant you were running away. That meant you were running away. That's why you got hurt in the back. So he was looking for soldiers that had wound in the front. People soldiers that could stay face to face with the devil that could stand face to face with the enemy that could fight. Not people that hand wounded the back. People that turn the back and run away. People that been in the message but they turn the back and run away. If we the prophet said the Bible says the Bible says Jesus said anyone who put his hand in the plane his back is not fit to be in the kingdom. If you turn your back if you been in the kingdom if you been in the message you turn your back. If you've been in the message and you turn your back, you're not fit to be in the kingdom. God is looking for soldiers that stand toe to toe with the devil. When the devil say boo, you say boo. When they say the devil say boo, you to say boo. Now you turn your back and run. God is looking for soldiers that wound in the front. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in the battles. &gt;&gt; We need to know where the battle started. As a matter of fact, the battles did not start on the earth. The battle start up there in heaven. In fact, the battle is not between you and Satan. The battle is not between you and Satan. The battle is between God and Satan. So it just happens. Many of us identify with God. So the enemy of God become our enemy. But the battle is between you and Satan. The battle is the Lord's battle. It's the Lord's battle. Amen. Amen. The prophet says in the message, "The greatest battle ever fought 62. &gt;&gt; This great the first battle that ever fought &gt;&gt; begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels. It first started. The first battle was in heaven. So sin did not originate on the earth. It originated in heaven. and it fell on human being. The battle started in in heaven and fell on the human being. Then the battle from angels from angels become human battles. The battle that was angels battle became human battles. Satan come to destroy God's creation. What God has created to be here is suffer. He had Satan come to destroy this. That what his purpose? He was to destroy it. The battle begin here on the earth. Amen. Now we can see why angel's battle, what was angel's battle became human battles. I believe God was victorious there. If God was victorious there, he will still be victorious here because he never lost a battle. If he was victorious there, the Bible says Michael and his angel was victorious over there. The angels, the stars that identified themselves with Michael, they were victorious there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same angels here on the earth that identify themselves with the great Michael will also be victorious here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Therefore, there are two powers. There are two powers on the earth. There are two powers on the earth. Two powers that confronting confronting each other that are controlling the earth. It's either you are control but God's power or the devil power. The prophet says in the message Jarius raising Jerus paragraph 13. &gt;&gt; Now let's get that in our mind and remember that is ever present. There's no other creature that could be omnipresent except God himself. No other creature. The devil is a great force. There are some people especially Christian we think the devil is not a force. &gt;&gt; The prophet says the devil is a great force. &gt;&gt; The devil is a great power and the devil is a great great in his power. &gt;&gt; But he's under the power of God. The devil can only be in one place at a time. His limbs can be everywhere. His imps can be everywhere scattered out. His demons, his coworkers, but God himself is alone in his this field of omnipresence. In this field of omnipresence, God is alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the prophet says omnipresence of God &gt;&gt; means omnisient. God is omnipresent because he knows everything. He knows the end before the beginning. The devil does not know the end. God knows the end before the beginning. That's what makes him unimpress. Hallelujah. Not an angel. Not the angel but God himself. Hallelujah. That gives us the courage. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Demon exist. &gt;&gt; They are real. &gt;&gt; You can if you cannot believe God. If you don't want to believe the devil. If you believe God that means there must be a demon somewhere. Demons are real. Witchcraft exist. Is and the prophet is a great force. Magicians, the magic exist, they cause accidents. They cause troubles. &gt;&gt; They bring trouble. They attack with diseases. They create fasting among the people. They bring confusion. They bring wars among the people. The prophet says the devil will come and create confusion and will stand back and watch you fighting. They bring confusion. &gt;&gt; They bring trouble. Demons are real. They attack families. They attack churches. They attack ministers with women, &gt;&gt; with popularity, with witchcraft. One day the prophet stood there. I think it was in Germany. He was preaching and there was sources in the in the church. They started doing enchantments. And the prophet says, They wanted to make me bark like a dog. They were not scared of the de the prophets. They wanted to make him bark like a dog. So demons are real. They're controlling people attack people. Hallelujah. You better make sure you have God. You have Sabath on your side because he's the one who can fight for you. They attack &gt;&gt; they attack ministers ministers. &gt;&gt; If they cannot get you with women, if they cannot get you with witchcraft, they will get you. They will get your children. They will attack your children. They will attack your wife. They will attack your ministry. They want to destroy you. They want to finish you. So therefore, we are not in the picnic. Satan is real. The prophet says to overcome, you know, the enemy tactics. &gt;&gt; You cannot overcome if you undermine, if you underestimate your enemy. And the prophet says the devil can come and take your life prematurely. They can try to take your life prematurely. But the prophet also says when the devil can come, can the devil try to come and take your life prematurely? The angel of the Lord stand between you and death. He stand between you and sickness when the enemy can come when he's trying to come to take away your life prematurely. That means there are people that die prematurely before the time. But when you have seis, he stand between you and the danger. He stand between you and that sickness. He between stand between you and cancer. That's what the prophet says. You will not die before your time. You will not die before the time that God has allowed it to you. You will leave to fulfill the purpose of God. They attack when you sleep. &gt;&gt; They attack when you driving. &gt;&gt; They will attack your children. They will attack your job. The prophet says the job is to attack. To attack to attack. They bring all kind of problem. They attack your finance. They attack you. They will attack your job. They will weaken your prayer life. Every time you try to pray, you cannot pray for one minute. You cannot pray for two minutes. They want to weaken your prayer life. That's the power of the devil. So therefore, don't get distracted. They cause accidents. The prophet was talking about a a a man, an old man. Uh he was hit by a car, by a woman. And then uh everybody that was around, they saw a man that was projected and fell down. And the woman got out of the car. She wanted to see the old man, but she could not see. And the witness, everybody around could testify. They saw a old man with a coat, but they could not see him no more. They called the police. They started to search the area, but they could not see no one. They cause accidents. &gt;&gt; Demons cause accidents. You don't know what's going on on the street. You don't know what's going on out there. They bring accidents. &gt;&gt; They cause problem. Demons exist. So we are therefore in a battle. That's why before you get in the car, before you drive your car, because you don't know what is going on out there, you don't know what spirits are out there. Demons are real. I just want you to wake you up to know that demons are real. So therefore, if demons are real, our Jehovah Sabath is also real. Amen. He fights our battles. The battle that we cannot see, the invisible battles that we cannot see. The Bible says when the enemy shall come like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall raise the standard. Hallelujah. When the enemy shall come, when the enemy will attack you, the spirit of the Lord, the Lord of hosts shall raise the standard. He will not touch you. Amen. Amen. The omnipresent God, he knows the danger before he comes to you. There's a wall of fire around you. The Bible says the witchcraft, the enentment will not touch Jacob. The witchcraft, the enchantment will not touch Jacob. Hallelujah. Because Jacob is the bless of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan has a power. But my God is most powerful &gt;&gt; in the message, &gt;&gt; the contest. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 11, &gt;&gt; the prophet says, "We know that he has the most power. We know who has the most power." God does. God. And when he gave his people the best, the best thing that he could could to combat with was with with his word. Now because the word is God and who is stronger than God. Who is God? The word is God. And the word becomes our strength. God in the church become his strength. God in the church is our strength to pull Satan in his his own fire that he has made. The devil has made a fire to bring you in the fire but in you is your strength to pull the devil in his own fire. The fire he has made. Hallelujah. They have made a fire. They have plot against you. They have plain against you. But God is in you become your strength. Hallelujah. To pull you to pull the devil in their own fire. Esther pull amen in his own fire. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. the power of God in you will pull the devil in his own fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why every weapon, every plane, every plot that is formed against you shall not prosper. Every plane the gallow that put there to hang you will not prosper. Hallelujah. They will be hanged there. will be it will backfire on them. Hallelujah. It will backfire on them. Hallelujah. There was a brother. &gt;&gt; There was a brother. I heard a story somewhere. There was a brother. He bought a new house. And in that house, he later found out that they were saying he was hunted. Auntie, &gt;&gt; they said it was hunted. And every time they were sleep, they had a room there upstairs. And the man, the brother would hear somebody walking and they could not sleep. They were scared, but they could they just heard every night somebody walking. The prophet says the devil loved the darkness. He love to attack in the dark because you don't see him coming when you sleep. Sometime you don't see him coming. So you will come and start walking in the water. But that brother he said enough is enough. That day he took the message books. He laid on the floor and he started playing the tape in that room. &gt;&gt; And he says that day They never heard the noise and the kids slept in peace. That's why in your room, that's why in your house, play the tape. Keep the good atmosphere. The devil will not attack you. They will not come near you. And when they come, they will find Jehovah. Hallelujah. Sleep in peace. Jehovah Sabel stands for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues. &gt;&gt; Now I know the old saying of that people of 12. People don't believe in in demons in this day. are the things to do to my opinion is to know your enemy and know your enemy and train for the count that you are going to have to meet him because you are going to meet him. What is strength? The strength for the countries this and this in this war we have battles. There are battles that collectives. There are battles that is collective. There are battles for the family. The devil can attack the family. This can be a collective battles. But there are battles also very individual. There are battles in the church. The devil can come and fight the church and attack the church. But there are also battle that are individual. Those are the battle difficult battle because they are silent battle. The silent battle they are the very difficult battles. You know when the battles are public, everybody can comfort you. Everybody can come and comfort you. But when the battles are silent, those are battles. It's not like you don't want to tell the battles, but you just can't find words. Explain the battles. So you going you can't just find words understand it except yourself you just don't have words. It's not just you keeping secrets. You can't find words difficult. Silent battle are very difficult. You know that I will talk about the battle of sister Eddie Ed. We all know sister writes a great testimony that we miss to understand to know the battle that she was going through. We know sister Ed in a good way said the right thing. This is nothing but the truth. What sister was going through everybody knew it. Let's read what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; Ministry 167 sister Eddie Moier that was the her name. &gt;&gt; She just lost her husband. &gt;&gt; That's the first part. I married the couple some years ago. They got two fine children and brother Watt was killed in his own was killed. His own boy found him under the tractor. So this sister &gt;&gt; was married and her husband was killed under the tractor mashed crashed to death and the little boy at the break. And something happened to him. Brother Hun and I went down one night and stay in the day into the night. And another message I believe the prophet says first of all she lost her husband a great battle. And what kind of death? The husband was trashed and smashed. And then the only believe the prophet says, "And you talk about renegot. They were just giving a headache all the time. Poor little widow mother." And so a husband, I marry she to her husband. [Music] Her husband has gotten killed on the mar. So her husband was killed and she had two kids and the two kid was renegot renegot real thugs. But look the trouble that she was going through. The battle that she was going through. She had all the reason to be bitter. &gt;&gt; She had all the reason to be bitter. But yet in that condition, &gt;&gt; one day when they were building the sanctuary being poor, she did not have the money. She lost her husband in a very difficult condition. Her children was out there in the world. on that condition. She did not have money. When they were building the church, she brought the offering to brother Bren. She was not bitter. And the prophet when the prophet look at the money, when the prophet look at the money, he said, I cannot take it. But the Lord told him, take that money, you are hindering your blessing. You see the battle that she was going through. But she was not bitter. But in that the prophet says in that battle you remain faithful in your private battle faithful the battle that you cannot remain faith don't be bitter don't be bitter remain faithful hallelujah your victories welcome &gt;&gt; she Stay there quiet. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Nothing is going to bother you. Nothing is going to bother you. &gt;&gt; Don't be scared to take God at his word. Just relax and hear his voice. Just relax. When you're going through a battle, silence battle that you cannot explain it. That's why brothers and sisters when you see somebody just don't be quick to judge. Somebody can be there sad the countenance you don't understand quick to judge. You don't the person is going through. You don't know the battle is going through because the silence battles are difficult. But in that battles, the prophet said just relax and have faith and believe. He's watching over you. He will disintegrate anything that tries to bother you. Anything that might attack you, he will disintegrate it. But he can't harm you. They might attack you here. They might attack you, but they can't harm you for all things you permit it. It couldn't be nothing else. For it's working together for your good to them that love God, no arm can come to you. God is going letting you go through the battles that you have through. Today we are talking about sister Eye and because of her battles because of her silence battles. Hallelujah. The first time the third bull came to the human being was to that woman. The third greatest of all the ministry. The greatest of all the ministry.

Just trust God. God will trust you. If you trust God, God will trust you with victories. And Anna was also going through silent battle. But nobody could understand. If you read the Bible, the Bible says Anna went to the temple before that her husband came the husband asked her am I not worth 10 10 children for you? Men sometime we don't understand we try to place ourel we compare we think like we can replace the kids these are different kind of love husband could not understand she went to church she started praying she started praying and the word the bible says the word were not coming out you know when you go through the battle silent battle you reach to a point where words can come. You just grown. Tears coming down. You just grown &gt;&gt; in that moment. Problem overwhelms you. The problem overwhelms you. When problem overwhelms you, there's no words to explain it. The lips just move, but the words don't come out. The words don't come out. If it happens that words comes out, they don't mean anything. They're meaningless because you are in pain. You are in pain in yourself. That's a battles. The Bible says provoke her day and night. The enemy were attacking her day and night. Anna decided to go to the temple she was praying the word were not coming out to the point the pastor came even the understand that's what the prophet says you know it's it's not also good to talk too much when you're going through battle it's not good to talk when the prophet was explaining about the seven sephet he was saying the reason of the seven seal, the seven seal. He said the reason why God kept it secret because God did not want the devil to mess up his plan. He messed up his plan. The prophet says when I'm about to do something, if I said I will do this, I will do this. The devil will go ahead and wreck my plan. He said, "But when I keep in my heart, but when you pray in your heart and words is not coming out, you just murmur, you just grow." Hallelujah. The prophet says, "God seal you with the Holy Ghost. God seal your prayer with the Holy Ghost. The devil cannot understand. The devil cannot understand because the devil does not know everything. It's seal inside of you. That's why I don't talk too much. Yeah. Amen. Amen. By the Lord of hosts. Anna says in the book of 1 Samuel, &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter one, the Bible says, let's go to verse 10. He said she was in the bitterness of her soul and pray unto God the Lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow and said, "Oh Lord of hosts, if thou will indeed live on the affliction of thy hands, remember me and not forget thy hand hand made. If you will give unto thy handmade amen, then I will give unto thee unto the Lord all the days of his life. And there shall not be a razor come upon his name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. She was moaning. She was groaning. Hallelujah. Words were not coming out. Remember me. I'm your servant. Remember me. I'm your servant. But the Lord Jehovah Sabath stand on your defense. The Bible says he's our defense in your affliction. He's your defense. Hallelujah. He's my advocate. He's my advocate. He stand for me. When the devil attack me, the prophet said, "The Holy Ghost, what is the Holy Ghost?" He's the advocate. What is the advocator? What does he do? He make advocate. He has mercy. He stands in your place. He does things that you cannot do. It's appropriation for your sin. It's your righteousness. It's your healing. It's your life. It's your resurrection. It's all God has for you. He's your advocate. I could we could go Don't put the details. The prophet says the Holy Ghost is there to make advocate. He's our attorney. He stands there and plead for us. We don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in us plead for us. The Holy Ghost giving address sometimes with words you can and you cannot understand. command intercession for us. That's what the Holy Ghost is. When I walk into anything, when I walk like a little kid, you walk like a little fellow, we are walking in the dark world, full of enemies, full of sin, full of traps, full of everything. You said, "Oh, I'm afraid. I'm afraid to take the Christian life. I'm afraid to do this. I'm afraid to I will do this. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. We have an advocate. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, he can stand by us. He's in us. He makes intercessor for us. He is the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making advocate for us all the time. Oh, we thank God for it. He stand for us. That's why we are calling Jehovah the Lord of host in the battle. One day Elasha one day Elasha was surrendered by the enemies was surrendered by the enemies. His servant saw his servant saw the enemy. He came to him. He said, "My master, the enemies are all over the place. The enem is attacking my job. The enemy is attacking my family. The enemy are all over the place. Oh, Elisha, look at him. He said, "Oh Lord," Elisha prayed. He said, "Oh Lord, open the eyes of this boy. Open the eyes of this boy. Them that are with us are greater. Them that with us are greater are more number. The majority." Hallelujah. And the prophet says when the servant opened the eyes, he saw the host. He saw the chariots, &gt;&gt; the the mountain full of angels. Hallelujah. The prophet said the angel did not just get there. The angel did not just get there. The angel they were there. They never left. The problem is the servant could not see it. But the angel were there. The angel are camping around them that fear God. The Lord of hosts is standing for us. They will not hurt us. They will not ar us. There are situation that greater than ourselves. Jehovah, our general, fivestar general. He never lost the battle as a fivestar general. He never lost the battle. Michael, &gt;&gt; a defender of his people, the defender of the saints, he never lost a battle at one time. He never lost a battle. He conquered death and hell. He conquered everything. What are you facing tonight? What is the great general cannot do? What is the greatest cannot do? Never lost a battle. Hallelujah. Is looking for soldiers. &gt;&gt; Not coward. Coward. &gt;&gt; Not coward. Looking for soldiers that can stand toe-to-toe with the devil. Knowing that I have the great, the master of the wind, the great general by my side, the chief captain. &gt;&gt; Oh, pray to Jehovah Sab. Pray to jo. You just pray. You just pray. Prayer is the greatest weapon. Prayer is the greatest weapon. What a soldier can have. You have to make sure after knowing the power of your enemy. Just make sure you have the weapon. Just knowing the power of the enemy. After knowing the power of fasting, make sure you have the weapon. Prayer is the greatest weapon because when you pray, you call upon Jehovah. You know, Lord, I cannot fight this battle. I cannot fight this battle. But you are greater. You are greater. This problem is not a match for you. This situation is not a match for you. This attack is not a match for you. I might not preach to you, but I'm preaching to myself. I might not preach to you. You might not get what I'm saying, but I'm preaching to myself. This battle, you might be greater than my suffer. Come fight my battles. Hallelujah. The prophet says, you know, the best armor that America &gt;&gt; has in the in this present crisis &gt;&gt; is God-fearing, &gt;&gt; praying people. The greatest weapon that this church can have is praying people is the warriors. The war prayer warriors. That's the best. It's worth them more than all the bombs and the things that we could produce. God will always fight for his church. God will always fight for his people. This whole nation with one accord, this entire church with one accord would throw themsel in sack. an act of repentance and come back an old fashioned pathway that our father did there could be a bit there couldn't be a bit of come to us if we can only come and throw ourself in s there wouldn't be a bit of a home that come to us. I believe it's more than all the ammunition plates and things that they could that we could make and all the bomb that we could make. There's nothing as great as prayer. Prayer holds all the future in his hand. God hold the future in his hand. Don't try to defend yourself. Don't try to defend yourself. Don't try to defend yourself. The prophet says when you try to defend yourself, Don't step back and let you fight. Don't try to defend yourself. The welfare that we are facing is not canel by spiritual. The only weapon God has given us. It's on our knees. Every time you face a battle, every time you face critics, every time you face attack, go on your knees. That's the greatest fear. Don't try to fight back. Don't try to fight back. That will be the greatest mistakes you're going to commit. When you try to fight, let try to read what the prophet saying about in the message who is God 52. Someone said to me long not long ago, give me a threat in a certain city. Somebody came to brother Bernham. &gt;&gt; He said, if you don't quit preaching divine healing, we will throw a bomb on your platform. platform. Somebody came to the Ben. If you don't quit preaching through a bombat, we will kill you a threat. I said the smoke won't dry till I will be in the glory. Before the smoke dry, even if you kill me, the smoke won't dry till I be in the glory. That's all right. Why we do we do do we feel if God be for us who can be against us? You know it's written in the Bible. It's better than a milestone was hang on your neck and throw in the depth of the sea than to offend these that believe in me in me. Listen to what the prophet says. If you fight, God can fight. If you fight, God can fight. If you try to pay back, if you try to talk back, God cannot fight. Stand still. Stand still. Oh, they threatened me. He insulted me. Stand still. &gt;&gt; This is not your battle. And be careful. You the one criticizing critique the servant of God. Be careful. You the one attacking the child of God. The prophet says, "Stand still. Let God fight. He will bring it to pass." Amen. He will put every critics, everything to shame. Give everything to shame. Do you believe in prayer? Let's settle down to faith. Let's settle down to faith. Try to fight. God won't fight. That's why I said be careful. You the one also fighting. You the one attacking. Because when a man goes to a knee, &gt;&gt; go to the knee and they begin to pray. They know, Lord, look at this situation. Look at this break. Look at this. There's nothing I've done. Look at the attack. Look at the critics. They go on the knee and they begin to pray. Be careful. I'll prefer somebody to talk to me. But to go on the knee, let somebody go on the knee and pray with a heart. Pray with a heart. That's dangerous. &gt;&gt; They're dangerous. &gt;&gt; You don't know what will happen to you. Be careful. When you attack a son of God because he might not fight you back. He might not have the strength that you have. He might not have the strength that you have. You might rely on your strength. Big mouth. taking because you know how to talk. You know how to talk. He might not know how to talk on his knees. He will begin to pray. That's dangerous. We fight for him. That's what I said. Trust in him. &gt;&gt; Don't fight back. Trust in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't fight back. &gt;&gt; Just trust him with all you can. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know the story, another story before I wrap up. We're going to go in prayer. &gt;&gt; There was a Muhammad Ali. &gt;&gt; Muhammad Ali, the battle in the jungle. &gt;&gt; It actually happened. It actually happened in Congo. &gt;&gt; The Muhammad Ali, &gt;&gt; he were fighting the greatest the greatest champion at that time. That man was called George Foreman. And that man was a great he was very strong. &gt;&gt; All the odds all the odds was against Muhammad Ali because that man will not go past six round. But that day in the battle in the jungle Muhammad highly studied George Foreman. He studied said this man cannot pass six round if lasted him up to six round and in that battle started strong. He started beating all the old things that Muhammad Ali could do. He was laying on the rope. He was laying on the rope. He was laying on the rope. First round, he was getting punches after punches. Punches after punches, punches after punches all the way to fifth round. tried everything that he could tried everything that he could at the six rounds he said this one I would knock him down the reason why he wasn't passing with all these opponents up to sixth round because he were knocking all his offense he was knocking them down so he said in this round I will give everything my last weapon And it's why he punched Ali was hit. But Muhammad knew that was his last punch. &gt;&gt; That was his last punch. And when he gave Muhammad Ali the last said, "Is that all you got? Is that all you got?" And at that moment lost the battle because he was worn out he was tired. At the seventh round at the seventh round Muhammad Ali started punching and he knocked George Foreman down. The church of God was beaten all six ages beaten up. Punches after punches, punches after punches, punches after punches until the sixth one. The devil tried the last one. That was all he got. They stand Muhammad Ali of this time, the box of this time. He asked the devil, "Is that all you got?" Do we have the children of God tonight that can tell the devil, "Is that all you got? Enough is enough. You have tried all the punches. You have tried everything that you got. Is that what you want? This is my time. This is my time. I will knock you down. Hallelujah. I'm a warrior. I will knock you down. There was a battle in the jungle. And one day, there was a man Shamar. The enemy will come take his stuff. Every time he will he will he will sow the land, the enemy will come. the fruit of his harvest. One day he woke up in your head. He said, "I'm a child of God. I'm circumcised. I'm a child of God. Why I have to suffer? Why I have to go through this? Why so many battle?" Why every time I try something, it does not work. I try something, it does not work, the devil comes in attack. The devil comes in attack. The prophet says, he said, "Enough is enough. I'm very tired of this situation. I'm very tired of this situation. I'm looking for people tonight that are tired of this situation. If you are you are settled with your situation, that's fine with you. If you are settled with your situation, that's fine with you. But I'm looking for warriors, hallelujah, that can stand and say enough is enough. I know the odds against me. I know everything is against me. Hallelujah. The prophet says there were 600 train 600 trainmen soldiers. [Music] That man took everything he got. He took everything he got and he slew 600 people and he saved his family. &gt;&gt; He took also the jawbone. He took the jaw bone. The jawbone the prophet was old. Look at it. He could not resist the helmet of the enemy. But Samson did not think. He took the jawbone and he started sooing the enemy. And the prophet says, "If God, I don't have time to read it. If God can take the old jawbone, what can you do with a jawbone that is alive? Do you understand that? A jawbone that is alive, you have, you have a jawbone. That means God can use your mouth. If you can use dead old deadone with your live jawbone read it quickly paradox paradox why brother that's all the rotten jaw bone of that me [Music] you will eat one of them big brass helmet with Why you would have splatted in thousand pieces but he was a paradox. God was in that old job. If he can get a one on a dead one, surely he can on ours that is alive. He can use ours. So tonight I want you to take don't think don't think get whatever you have. Use your pray until you answer. Pray until you answer. says God is looking for some people that cannot take no as an answer that cannot take no as an answer. The problem is you pray and you stop until the next meeting. God is looking for people that can stand there until the answer. I will not leave here. Jacob, I will not leave here. You will find my bone here. I will not leave here until you give me what I made before. Use your jawbone. Use your jawbone. Claim whatever you have. You are a soldier. Go claim whatever you got. Abraham went to claim lot. Claim everything that you got. Oh, don't be lazy, my brother. Don't be lazy, my sister. Claim everything that you got. Claim with everything that you got, whatever the devil has taken from you. Fight. Claim whatever belongs to you. Finish with this quote &gt;&gt; in the message. Possessing all things 57. Abraham could possess the that land and what was in it. God give it to him. Lot was a part of that land. God gave Abraham that land everything that was in that land. God gave you your family and everybody that's in the family. God gave you your church and everybody that's in that church. God gave you your possession. God gave you this message. God gave you the message. Every promise is a message belongs to you. So Abraham had the right to it. &gt;&gt; You have the right to it. He could go and lay hold on it. Paragraph 57 possessing all things. He said now God you made me a promise. What is the promise God has given to you? If God has given you a promise today, what is that promise? You made me a promise. That word was in this land. All it was, it's all mine. You made me a promise. Now my kinsman has been taken. My child has been taken. You gave me a promise.

I will not take no as an answer. You gave me this promise. I will not lose my beloved. Stay there and fight. 58. In other words, if we apply today, I'll say the church could say, "Lord God, he is my brother laying there. He is my brother Ling." Do you have Do we have people that he needs tonight? We have tonight. But the church of God could say, "He is my brother laying here, stricken with cancer, he's stricken with tuberculosis, tuberculosis. He's got so and so. He's got this problem. This problem. I laid off all the promise. &gt;&gt; I I lay hold of the promise. &gt;&gt; It's my possession. &gt;&gt; You told me. You told me so. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There you are.

The believer today yet we are here to all things. Yet we are here to every spiritual blessing, every physical blessing, every blessing the Bible promises. Yet you have to fight every inch of it.
