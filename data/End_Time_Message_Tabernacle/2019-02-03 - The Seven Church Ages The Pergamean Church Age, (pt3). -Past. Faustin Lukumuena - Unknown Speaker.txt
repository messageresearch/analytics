voix memo you don t pass Mon Ami fidelity item is a macchiato may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the scripture so last Wednesday I started with the age of Pergamos become established the Paragon and I'm gonna continue with it in the same angle just for around just to talk a little bit about Pergamos and his messenger in the message the Pergamum church age the first coat you have brother branham is giving us the background of this church now the background of this church is the third church age Coreper Gama celatum abilities application and a date that this church existed was from 312 ad to 606 the edge was as I said last Wednesday Jesus manifested himself in the attribute of a two-edged sword and the two-edged sword is the Word of God and the reason why he appear in that it's because the age of Pergamos is the age where doctrine starts the pinnacle mosaic because even the Nicolaitans which was a did in the very first church age in the Third Age of Pergamus it become a doctrine not only was the doctrine of Nicolette and in the age but it was also the doctrine of balaam so that's why brother bottom said the edge was false doctrine Nicolaitans false doctrine and false doctrine was the center lying in this age it was the foundation of papacy this is where Pope and the Catholic Church was born basically papal existe to nicotine it and in this age it was also the age of marriage between church and state and we will talk about the marriage in this age the reward was hidden manna the man Kashi and a white story Luca you blonde and a star the angel of this church by all that the Holy Spirit would lately do I have a big st. Martin so st. Martin was the angel of the age and brother branham said it was the revelation given me on it because reading of the other Saints during that time I picked up st. Martin because that he was a godly man to my opinion he was ten times more apostle than st. Patrick was Elizabeth will stamp a quickly T I think by the party will not like this talking about a brother Martin trial on the frame after being ten times more than him now no st. Patrick was itself much and and nephew Saint Martin's sister was the mother of st. Patrick so you better just start calling bottom so that was just the summary of the age and I think by God's grace we will get into more detail to talk about those false doctrines the creation of the Catholic Church how they state politic married to the church for Moloch that's why brother Branham is telling us believers should not be involved in politics that was the age of marriage so that's the foundation of the background of the age now Matt know what is the meaning of Pergamos in the message a Pergamum church age bar graph 157 bottom said now the word Pergamos means married the very word Pergamos means married Chris charity that is the Nicolaitans side the formal side 157 conceived married to the state with a peg and ceremonies like the ceremony pagan pagan ceremonies so the age of Gummer's it was the manifestation of the pagan ceremonies where they took all the woman pagan behavior team up on the old man and put it in the church that's the age and it was the birth of the Catholic Church in that day and keep in mind when we talk about Catholics don't you just see the priests live I personally prefer Catholic means a spirit to literally live there is a spirit the Catholics spirit is moving as Branham said people die lisanna by the spirit never dies the spirit that was born in 325 is continuing continue and that's why brother Branham said upon indeed I did not give you that just in the message Exodus when I'm said we are not gonna give our girls to be married by Catholic boys the nymphaeum area when we talk about Catholic boys Catholic it's not those in the choir in the country paragraph 2 15 to 17 Exodus we have to get married only between they belong believers acquire and when we talk about believers it's the believers not the Catholic boys I'd love for Metallica we have Catholic boys in the church Catholic I'll agree we have Catholics sisters in the church tunic are eglise therefore Allah the parent it's your responsibility to know who you are giving your daughter to bikini but receive who your son is gonna marry sometimes it can run into conflict conflict because people get so narrow-minded population on the policy right but you can have somebody you can see this one is a catalyst to leak regardless of the number of years they have done in the church you know Madonna is not fair like this they are still cuddly let me tell you one of the specialty of the catalytically in the Catholic Church and agree that they don't pay tight Peppadew emo a special ability is not true the priest will never talk about tighten apologize I'm a lady he will talk about the mass if a palatal a mess so the Catholic boys don't pay tight just paper with him no they don't pay tight they don't know it so if somebody doesn't pay his tight he's a Catholic boy I think a tunic you see them in the church we are gonna do this we are gonna do this he is a Catholic boy and with that in mind I will not give anybody to a Catholic boy another person and of sohcahtoa League they are Catholic boys Catholic if they don't pay their tightly papilledema because is the same spirit of the saloon ministry because for the catalytically patrolling in 325 when they brought up the spirit portal is free they said if we tell the people to pay die - yonder PLO him they will not pay any pay therefore hello the only way to do a seminar in order for us to become a rich church because if you want to preach the Bible tell the people about Molokai tree to pay type our lives on the manage they will not pay Buster you will pay the bill yourself a relief a to whom em so the best way is to ask them to bring money when somebody died we are gonna say a mass we collect the money don't collect the line that's all and the Catholic they understood silicon-silicon if you ask them to pay tithe he will of the Monday defeated him you will not collect any money in a pillar so therefore sell hosiery sell these things that's why the Catholic boys do when you ask them money to go by for a retreat they will do when you ask their money for any church basketball activity they will do when you are there money to eat pizza they will do when you ask them tight from there they don't ask about my services and Branum said and today go like to partner 15 you understand in the time of Moses what happened notice they devil in a form of ramesses the first thing he done so Sheila was get rid of the children with natural death and as soon as the Son of God was born he had moved from Egypt cause God destroy Egypt casted it's never never come back since cylinders am/fm you'd appreciate Allah then he was in a war center movies seat up to up and the first thing wrong to destroy it all to get be sure they devil in the Roman system system and try to destroy what the Son of God to begin with the same devil and today he has done the same thing on today sign of spirit now religious professing Christianity and taking our girls and married them to Catholic boys and make them bring their children Catholic to break the power of the other side there is your demon there is your devil seated on seven Hill wearing Triple Crowns Catholicism is a spirit they kill in the day of Moses they kill in the day when Jesus was born and today they are killing the children in which way with marriage we will see in the age of tight area political marriage people setting up marriages for political reasons I'm gonna marry this one because I'm gonna marry the one because I'm gonna marry that one because before you marry somebody checking this instead of checking the personal a person you go check the green card all these things are political reasons that's why you have to know what you are doing not everybody is a politician they are to believers as well but you watch the motive and objective and you better pray about it somebody you never pay tight it's a Catholic boy you come and talk about marriage with apologize I'm not gonna listen to your sister Esther she was there go to the next paragraph but people think like it's hard you the parent you see a boy coming to ask your girl for marriage and even demand a Victorian Mallee check his background since he has been in the church does he pay tithe I've seen a lot brother somebody doesn't pay the title when he pays a mini-game pastor come to see you what do you think I'm gonna really tell you t for you are if you are like I will tell you we'll see close the file you see people you better live cattle you go to the Catholic same thing with the girls the girls who don't pay their tight you are expecting a good man to come marry you that's a nun when young go that's good we have none G the don't pay their title and we're gonna take our boys to marry the Catholic girls don't they kill their children in the other two times they kill their children with what 2 x now remember watch that 2 and then 3 see he kill their children their first two times we've natural death and this last time he is getting their children to kill them we've spiritual desert in that the spiritual death is marrying and intermarry don't accept anybody if the person doesn't pay the tithe a person a page a message somebody coming goes come see me for their records Boca listening say la responsabilité a partner this is parents responsibility don't judge somebody who doesn't pay the tithing papers at him he is the curse to start with you are taking somebody's daughter to bring the curse upon her LMAO Thank You Brandon marriage some Catholics died and Catholic they don't pay the tithe to bring the cross in the house the children always tell the children go check with your dad I was in the church today the pastor Troy talk about tithing do you pay I read last Wednesday brother just give of everyone's contribution dad show me your receipt in boy a girl working part time maybe he got a receipt 250 maybe that's what she made him for the year was 2500 they receipts show 250 to do something count go compare your receipt with your w-2 I look comparable for your own shame that's the true facility you do all these things and tomorrow you complain this child doesn't he'll understand this is who - Michael the Muthu MCUs is coming from you that stubbornness is coming from you the one is stealing the money of God lucky for Sunday June so in the message the program is Pergamum Church 8 paragraph 199 now just a little further now the Christian Church married to babylon babylon Pergamos means wedding video male I think it has been a long time I did not get into the step of marriage in the exposition of the seven church age per graph 192 - 3 what a bottom said but the church and state would come together was truly for known of the Lord they're very member gammas means thoroughly married indeed state and church were married politics and religion were united when you see the poor people getting in politics from the church on Strayer politics the number 1 is the Pope asleep up from the stage of Pergamos that's where the pub started to get involved in politics and does this spirit that creation of the Catholic Church that was their spirit and that spirit never dies we see people today not being converted in history t but they change address cataleya to dude a message for massage oh I don't go to send Marie and more anymore which is a Prius Emily I go to you just change the address but to start with you never converted same thing you used to do in the car - that's what you are doing here Catholic no tight no now they're all spring of that the union have been consistently the most horrible hybrids the word as everything nation opinion from the unity unity love church and politics the children coming from the Catholic is the most horrible hybrid the world has ever seen it a big Catholic do nothing to do with cattle only if you don't you are a very strong type of hybrid with I breed faith with ibrid politician manner of the manipulative you appear before the believers like a very good Christian people pay your respects but under there you are not even converted you are nowhere in the world you are just am a Catholic so that's the being offered the word Pergamos as I said I'm not gonna talk about it longer we will get into in the days to come now in the message a Pergamum church age para 58 I want to talk a little bit for our st. Martin why brother Branham picked brother st. Martin as the messenger para 58 of the Pergamum church age now his life was from 8315 now here's the reason I picked him in preference to add a sense of the day because the way that he under the inspiration of God I do believe that now the Catholic Church did not come on I see him in means in the Catholic Church you live the way you want if you die they will ever meeting to declare you st. the canonization one of the reason he picked up much and as the messenger commitment because even the Catholic Church did not recognize the Martin Seligman March and fill with the spirit walk with God with a powerful testimony could not even notice him even after his death a map regardless of his many miracles they did not they did not recognize him that's another reason I picked him that's what I'm saying and one next Sunday when I ask you one why they choose brother but I'm picked by the margin I'm a thief Emma I will ask you before they shoot him candle yes and all this that we are seeing that's God the spiritual ministry that the early church turned down the Nicolette and charge turned it down because of the things they were spiritual and as I've drawn here the church was being squeezed out a lot come on Tracey negative amok when say I'm gonna skip this going to paragraph 61 now the life of st. Martin is one of the greatest miracle filled life of anybody in the church from all the way from simple out he was one of the most spiritual men one of his first miracle brother friends he was a soldier to begin with I believe so as a soldier he was always working with the sword and one day during wintertime very cold environment he found a beggar asking for something brother that's why we need to take this when we study the life of some saints we have to compare our testimony with how many people we pass by in the wintertime even somebody in the church we were certain needs you don't even talk to that person just to know how you are doing how things are going for you I just lost my job but how are you paying the bills but listen what they do somebody's going to ask him have you seen the past I'm gonna go to the motor vehicle to try to change my last name I will be Church first time Church everything because when there is a need go to the church we have not to think what we have to receive a from the church Navin Papa the second democracy will agree by letter saying what we can do for brother Martin as a soldier passing by he saw somebody needs he did not say I'm gonna go check my closet Valley Road amo in my closet if I have extra je vais vous complainingly son spiritual not to go in my closet Valley number what I got I know it's very cold that's what God called giving the second you happened to me you don't give the excess we need an apology but if you get the best you got that's where the blessing reside that's why we don't see people post very much always from one picture to one page know the Bible said you will be the head not the tail that's the truth but today we cling to their leader we can move on to invite somebody to give something to somebody you God never dealt with you I make return but I believe a Christian God always deal with his own he will give you special attention with the spiritual eyes perceive that this brother may have a need to set our armies this sister has a need and sometimes you don't need to be identical apart we don't even I know he sits here that's why I see I just put brother Andrew Matthew you put in offering basket brothers gonna see I just find that can be the result of a deep night of this is how the early Christian not just criticism but compassion for one brother Martin did not go to the closet he said just what I got just beggar was there come on oh my life has to change just cover a little bit and brother Martin white when he was home wearing the angel of the Lord came cover with the same piece of code I want to read it park of 61 going to highlight but when San Martin come by Mako realizing his duty as a Christian believed he had one coat a clot over his shoulders he cut it in two with his sword and gave half of it to the beggar he took the other and then that night began his career for Jesus Christ appeared to him in a vision wrapped in that same hope that he cut off into which fulfill the scripture in so much as you have you have did it this scripture is still in the Bible try to do some I'm telling you now each one of you second try to do some works like this in secret and see what God is gonna bless you boy come on you have a believe and part of 63 Granum from there he said so take that for a lesson what ever you do to somebody you are doing it unto Christ just remember let's say that together please let us say that together what do you do to address you have done to Christ no he did not hear you let us say together so no matter what he thinks about you it's what you think about him see that brings their blessings allah kiya couplet living that was the first miracle and beginning of his ministry minister amen amen second miracle miracle miracle 67 there was one time they have to destroy the there was a tree and Saint Martin came and he told them if I am a servant of God I'm going to stand in the direction where the trees if it fall on me and I died then I'm not a man of God but if I'm a man of God somehow God is going to twist the direction of the tree to fall on somebody what I did they agreed and they chopped down the tree and the tree started falling toward God mighty hand came and change the direction and it will fall on a bunch of people a lot of people what a ministry but he was destroying a pagan Gulf one day I'm tearing down a pagan altar and there was a sacred tree standing by the pagan altar and he was cutting he was cutting the tree down and many standing by was inserting it he said if I be a man of God tell me the way back to the tree living and let the tree fall on me on Sunday to me a cola bottoms you tied me up this way if we got closer support I cannot run I will except to die if I kept it moving if I'm not a man of God they tree will kill me if I'm a man of God my God cannot twist that tree somewhere quietly challenge so they started chopping on the trees and when the tree started to fall it is switched around and kill a bunch of the spectre-2 on the Instagram oh no got a twisted it back all the time there was miracles in his meetings amen Parker 68 like it was with me Liza there was a daddy baby they want to it marching enough Martin just lay down and the baby came to life the brother branham say that happened three times I start to speak off was a dead baby but he lay his body across and it raised back to life again after you had played for some time for this baby another outstanding to me was the Emperor I think this one I said it on Wednesday and he was going to keep that umbrella was going to kill some God field only ghost people and of course he was the right hand of the Bishop of the First Church of Hope time and he actually was the Pope before he was called a pop his name was from da ma as you are when I will ask you one day he is a martyr Canadian mafia you will forget that he was and he was putting all the Christian to death that he could get a hold off to put to death and this Emperor wife a pagan and when this sent centered Martin came to intercede his wife put him next to it that he would try to intercede for this creature not a Christian not to be killed let me go to paragraph 71 so anyway the Emperor went and killed a Christian so therefore Martin look for interview to go see the Emperor they block access Ilana blue keeps on taxi they stop a big gate so but Saint Martin wanted the interview with him and the God stopped him educate well sir Martin fell on his face later and pay until God show him to go in when he raised up of there he walked to them locked doors and they opened themselves today gate loved me soon mountain and a desire to go talk to dick who as persecutor Christian God say pray do deep our prayer is the powerful keep a guard say go in 3d on he started walking la cama sama and they gate opened by the emperor sitting in the chair Pinocchio so Martin coming a demon Avenue and as so as soon as so Martin she just turned his head and now this man woke up right bottom our Martin send button and right up every guard and everything else right in the front of the Emperor and the Emperor didn't want to respect God if you are in president of the country oh whatever you are respected I deserve today we have so many people they come to America what the f dollars in fact Tuesday doula I'm gonna expect nobody you f dollars I get my dollars be so no so this kind of language is a big because for God require respect exist for one another and respect for his service you know that so and Barbara that's not manually hominem discipline won many many time we act without manners one day I shall come to wake you up and then you sit you think same thing children with their parents no respect at all the Bible said if you want

sister came it was almost to a fight my parents they call the police the police came they tell them the story of a body upon a sofa over there police start laughing it makes a big difference it's a big difference you are who you are respect the elders God requires respect and brother bottom said so that Emperor so he just turned his head and wouldn't even respect you nervous Oh church many times come here maybe the pastor called you with any pastor without you just you know what God did he try talk to him and he just kept his head down and God was going to make this head and pay respect to his service so he just said the thing of fire me like Susan so the fire came from the child on the first of the lashes and they're here on a laugh we skipping now that's Bible history nothing if not nice in Council he added to respect God service he made him stand up it's even sculpture seat where he was sitting fire one to through his body and squash the bottom of the seat God as a way of doing things that was another miracle in the life of Martin in the message you have to the husband wife your blessing depend on your husband as I said Wednesday it's everywhere in the Bible Sarah was saved because of Abraham God was about to strike dead but God look I give the promise to Abraham if I kill him she's the part of Blenheim meter slam the door God was about salvation with Lily interceding even discipline that's the God we believe it sisters as we said in the ears will not go beyond the head your blessings regardless of your degrees when you come to the man I take the degree put it in

the man respect the office evolved that's right respective different Minister comes up your posture always respective I have heard congregation talk about their passage out just talk about him oh my father we run him down ridicul he is that pastor ever going to do anything for you in reality the pastor's don't gonna do it it's a goddess to the past and see how you can do Branham said you don't I don't say this church me too I don't say that this judgment it's a spiritual language when I'm saying he's talking about other church Burnham is talking about other churches one about don't really do you see when amis talk about you have got to love your pastor you have got to know that he's a human being but yet God has made him his past made you it was not his choice no your choice but to God the choice their Holy Ghost has made him overseer then you have got to respect him in that manner and no matter what the pastor's done if you respect him in your heart as God's servant God will respect you for doing but I rather you see people some up a stage does not mean anything but the real respect is when you are upset the past has done something African the way you act that's where they respect the real respect is very open when you think I'm good pray for you you get here tomorrow good man you may come pursue pastor maybe he's a lot of problem he passed with the pollen if you pass all these messages we are just putting in the end to let me live we took too much respect here even in America don't translate this my mother-in-law sitting there every time she until I say mom

Martin and he wore the lesser garment out before the people instead of his good garment see it just go to show give the best that you have give your life do we never give your time do never give
