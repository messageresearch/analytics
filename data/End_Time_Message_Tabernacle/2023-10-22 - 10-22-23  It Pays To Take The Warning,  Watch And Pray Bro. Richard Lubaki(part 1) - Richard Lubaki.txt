any prayer request known or unknown here father be the solution we ask all of this in Jesus Christ name amen amen you may be seated as I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen uh first there is a Thanksgiving from the kalal family they want to thank the entire message tacle church for the exceptional love and support during the loss of their mother may God richly bless all of you amen amen and uh there is also a young sister Naomi Kaku who is in Texas she want to be baptized over there today and uh they sent me a message to ask this congregation for forgiveness uh maybe if she could have done something maybe being disrespectful or giving a wrong answer or wrong attitude whatsoever it can be uh so that the congregation can forgive her do you forgive her amen so I really believe that uh is the right attitude when you want to approach what baptism not only about word baptism but anything that you might remember that you did not do right you may have offended somebody always and always be ready to ask for forgiveness and uh people to whom they ask for forgiveness brother there is no other alternative but to grant that forgiveness amen amen we'll continue to pray for her that God bless her life and be a real good christianis amen amen so last Wednesday we presented our prayer request before the Lord for brother Billy Paul who was sick but uh the next day at 3:33 a.m. uh the Lord has decided to take our precious brother Billy Paul home after a long uh pain with uh fighting cancer again our conges community I think we are we have problems uh before Billy Paul passed away uh there were messages posted everywhere that Billy Paul passed away and I remember that Wednesday pastor called me and say did you hear that Billy Paul passed away I told I did not hear anything I'm going to check I called the secretary at the Bram Tabernacle of course not telling her that I heard Billy Paul passed away I just say sister uh how things going here with a Billy Paul uh she told me just to refer to what has been posted on the official Bram uh website voice of God but as cones it was everywhere Billy Paul Billy Paul Billy Paul but those statute that people want to post to post to post we have to [Music] stop because somebody can pass away in a certain family and they try to manage the situation before they inform certain family [Music] members but you you post you post you post my mother-in-law who sitting there she was asleeping one day she wake up and people have been posting one of his nephew who passed away in Congo she was not yet informed I think we have problems we have serious problems but as Believers when we identify something that is not right let us make a change amen amen people want to I'm the first one who knew what are you going to receive which is salary minister of information no no so uh brother bil Paul son he has uh gone through a lot of things in his life uh starting with losing his mother at a very early age and uh younger sister and the mother in passing away the mother passing away told Brother Bram take care of Billy since then Billy Paul born September 13 1935 which I memorize because it's 10 days after my birthday of course since then brother brother branam was the father and the mother of Billy Paul if there is anyone closer to brother BR Ministry I don't know anybody better than at age 12 Billy Paul saw the angel of the Lord and 145 he smoked a little bit to show that brother whatever you can see who is your dad you have to go through your personal experience and Billy Paul had his own experience with God personally things that I could not understand about the message or I wanted a little bit light I always called Billy Paul he was always always available you leave him a message he's going to call you back this is a big asset AV that we have lost but we could have question about certain things about certain things you call B you will receive help even though they were very very advised uh not to give opinion on the doctrines they will say go to the tape but I remember one time I really push him push him push him because I wanted um to understand how brother Bram managed the finances of the church I told Brother Billy Paul I know you were not only the treasure but you were brother bam secretary so you should know and he gave me the answer finally and I hold it for myself I share it with some other [Music] pastors so that somebody we used to go to very very humble there are people who took pictures with Billy Paul here uh my mom when she came from Congo we went to Jeffersonville she was H Billy Paul prayed for her she felt good I think Emmanuel show me one of the picture he took with Billy Paul he was very very friendly so that's somebody we are going to miss greatly and this morning in order to pay tribute to him uh I want to share with you one of his uh healing experience cancer took him but he was healed with cancer many years ago wait sister Faith uh to show that in this body you can be healed we are going to praise God for maybe you will be dying with the same thing but if you receive the healing of your soul you are in Eternal being amen amen and you know since his youth age he always was very closer to brother Bram when brother Bram preached he's tired Billy Paul has to carry him he said with brother hold this I don't remember the sign but brother Billy Paul knew sometimes he took him off the meeting earlier or half late regardless he was his driver was always there and uh like a people everywhere in the congregation when Billy brother Bram had Billy Paul as his treasure or and the [Music] secretary the congregation like always the congregation congregation Tabernacle I'm talking people people complain ah he was putting his son but brother told them I put him because the angel told me brother you don't need to understand every single thing and Billy Paul since that time until now he serve the Lord and I look at his testimony he did not miss services except recently when he started getting sick may his soul rest in peace and I have a piece of his testimony that he shared many years ago uh when he was healed by listening to tapes uh give me the message first um question and answers on the seal I think I give you I projected some quot back there if you really love brother Bram love his [Music] family if you love brother Bram love his family uh B Paul in the question and answer it was a big healing service you see keep going receive your healing receive your healing my brother receive your healing sister and it was a long keep going to the next paragraph This brother n received brother and so and Billy Paul was the one giving out the prayer card he was given go to paragraph 4 19 yeah Billy Paul brother Billy Paul steps to the microphone and says is that all that wanted to be prayed for now brother L speaks to brother Bram May the hand of the Lord Jesus Grant to you brother Veil this request for your loved one in Jesus name Billy Paul Bram speaks to brother Bram Billy Paul Paul now brother speaking bil Paul as many c as you have G out now receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ and this was 1963 bil Paul was there but this word was materialized mat many many years after uh Billy Paul was diagnosed with a [Music] postate and he went to listen to the tape when he listened to this portion he was completely healed and that's the testimony I'm about to make you listen to but before that in question and answers 1964 brother personally you tell me Oh Brother Joseph Bram brother Billy Paul Sarah have done this this this I don't want to know it I don't want to be involved because they are the people brother Bram interceded for they are human being like you and I they can do mistakes don't never focus on their mistakes because if you do evil to them or you speak evil to them to brother listen to this oh isn't isn't it wonderful I love him talking about God in my heart I love him and if I know my heart I believe you do too so together we are his children we love one another now I cannot love him without loving you you cannot pretend that you love God without loving your brother your sister that you see regardless of the mistakes regardless of even the differences on in doctr because over there only perfect love will enter andam said and if I say that I love him and don't love you the Bible said I am a liar see if you want to if you want to love me or love my family the choice was which do I want you to do love me or love my family love my family that's a clear answer you love brother Bram love his family never pretend that you I love the message I love because the message and the messenger are one if you pretend you love brother Bram love his children love his family Billy Paul I think has left two kids uh Paul and uh David the rest of the girls they passed away you love my family I would rather you would love bil Paul and is very specific I would like you to love Billy Paul then love me if it come to that kind of Showdown I would rather you do it I want you to I would like you to do it now I want you to listen to me he's not a minister I want you to listen to that to understand that very well let me repeat it I want you to listen to me William Bram the prophet Billy Paul is not a minister but I want you to listen to me what I tell you but when uh if you want to love somebody really love them you say I want to either love you or Billy you love Billy see God feels the same way about us and we cannot then I know you can't love Billy without loving me because he is part of me see so I can't love God without loving you because you are part of God and we love one another oh I think it is so [Music] wonderful amen amen the same way every Minister will say every father will do the same way how you can say I love you and you hate my family [Music] hello hello may God bless you uh let us listen to the testimony of Billy Paul uh it's going to be about 8 minute and then uh be prepared to give the microphone to Brother Richard who going to bring the word to us this enjoy Brother Richard last Sunday about brother Ben last Wednesday uh this is really uh the time I really enjoy also coming from home in the morning those sleepless night is better it's very very painful sister fath Saed and healed your done a biopsy when he came back he called me there and he said Mr BR I can't believe this he says but he said I wouldn't even believe it he said but we've done 12 biopsies and 10 of them was positive he said you're completely full of cancer you say what does that mean until they tell you you don't know what I'm talking about it scared me so bad not that I was scared of dying but just scared me so bad and I couldn't even move he told my boy David he said I've told a lot of people that they had cancer he says but I've never seen anybody take it as hard as your daddy I couldn't move and he said I'll go get your wife so he got the wife and brought her in and anyway he told me you know said you know we how long you know how they do all that that wasn't what was bothering me just I just didn't want to go I just didn't just didn't know how to accept that but you know Satan knows how to give you a lie like our brother said when he opens his mouth but he don't tell you all the truth like it tell you about Babe Ruth he hit 73 714 home runs but they don't tell you that he struck out 13300 times either so anyway I'd been working on a tape up at the voice of God and I come out and I got on the phone and I called my brother and I told him it was pouring down rain it was a Friday and I I tell you the truth that was scared me to death when I come out he said bu we'll just keep before the Lord so we had prayer and we been to the chapel and prayed and I went back up at the office and I told my children that day I said I don't want you to feel bad for d I don't want you to be I want to be right up in front with you I said with it this bad I said it probably won't be wrong it doesn't matter I said one moment from here I'm going to be where I want to be all my life no question about that so I went on home and the wife says what are you going to do I said I'm going to voice of God and she said no don't go up there we're they're closed on Friday she said don't don't go up there Billy I said I've got to I just want to go pray so I went in the office and I prayed I come back and I turned on the tape I wanted to hear a tape I want Daddy I wanted to hear daddy say something I wanted to hear him pray for somebody and say you got prostate cancer there was a tape on there that I've been working on for several days questions and answers on the seals we came down to the end of it and we don't Gap the part where he's in a Praying like he says God bless you God bless you God bless you so I'd already closed the tape off that's all there was left and I couldn't find nothing so I just pushed the button daddy said God bless you Sister God bless you brother and he prayed for you know hundreds like that and it went on for maybe 20 or 30 minutes and I turned the tape off and I was so discouraged then something down inside of me said listen a little farther I pushed it again God bless you God God bless you God bless you still wasn't there I turned it off something that the little voice said again said keep playing I pushed the button again tears from my eyes my faith was you know all of a sudden I Heard a Voice a young man I said that's me I said to the people is there anybody else wants to be prayed far the next voice I heard was Dad he said Billy Paul Billy Paul as many prayer cards as you trth give out now receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ that's all it took man I come home I got on the phone you talking about having a jubilee I said I don't care what the doctor said I don't care what the devil said Billy Paul now receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ you said that was just a coinci ENT I had heard that tape for 41 years and there it was hid there for that to be revealed that day for me God thought it the prophet spoke it I believed it and that settled it and then the Revelation come into my heart and then it become a manifestation I begin to testify about it I said I'm Healed and then God let my testimony become real in my heart hard and then as I begin to go brother brandom says then God will make your body obey your confession and I said I am healed I went to the doctor two months later he took my blood he sent it to the laboratory he came back and he sitting there had his glasses across his eyes he looking like that and he said Mr brandom I said yes he said you want to know what your PSA is today and I said yes sir he said minus 0.1 I said what does that mean doctor he said if I would have sent water to that laboratory it wouldn't have tested any more pure than your blood Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God bless you brother Rob amen keep playing it and finish it am amen Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah Blessed Be father we name of the Lord Brother sister this is the way I want to listen to tapes don't listen to tape like playing Billy Paul was listening he said he has listened for this tape for 41 years and if you have visited Jeffersonville where they translate brother bam tapes people will listen write down listen write down and they send to another person to double check the last person was Billy Paul because they say Billy Paul you are used to your father sometimes he can pronounce something and you see you hear like that was the job bil Paul was doing working for the voice of God until the last he passed away 88 years old serving God you see how the healing came you listen to tape even if you finish it your case is not addressed listen to the tape again something inside telling me pray again it was a long
