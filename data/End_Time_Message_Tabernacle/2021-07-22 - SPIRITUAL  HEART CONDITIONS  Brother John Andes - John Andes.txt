country nope [Applause] it was really wonderful [Music] i was with pastor kambali and many other ministers who asked me to greet you so i went for pastor muya's son who had his wedding july 10. so he wanted me to stay there after the wedding but i could not do it because of some uh weddings here of course the the javed conservancy so i preferred i preferred to go earlier and the height after the wedding celebrations and that's what was done it's a security effect so um the first sunday uh i mean i landed there i think tuesday elijah liu maori so it was this is where i had about five services i preached on uh the divine vaccine i think that was a timely message so i was a preaching waiting for the time for us to go to belgium because his son married a sister from pastor cambale's church in belgium so after the first service as i greeted the people outside yeah service conscious on exterior i saw a sister i knew we talked a little bit and i'm preparing i asked the sister where's your husband i didn't see him in the service you should demonstrate way too much have you done your service oh no the father is uh in a critical condition in hospital only foreign i said you know sister the only thing i can do because i always travel with a tissue that uh brother prayed upon a surveillance session i gave to the sister god give to the brother of her and uh two days later i went to the hospital i saw the brother really dying there is nothing that can hold my healing inheritance he had faith we prayed i left that was a tuesday wednesday after i finished the wednesday service one of the deacons told me that uh you know the hospital has already given up on him and they gave him a choice only i do not ensure either to stay in the hospital and die or to go home to stay with his kids to say goodbye to them and he decided to go home and stay with the kids so wednesday they send him home and he told me after church to come to his house he was almost dying at home you see more amazon and they came they took him back to the hospital you know europe is not like here surveillance comes you see there are some old buildings four levels without a escalator elevator certainly so they have to take him down hospital and he passed away on saturday oh really more lusamji and he was 49 years old living a widow uh 36 years old season wave of five kids have excellent confirm now as i always mentioned to you a commissioner he died without life insurance elements online no way to bury and you have a party on turmoil they have to start going door to door on the vial contribute the power down part he died the night of saturday to sunday saturday saturday to sunday samgyeol dimash and then suddenly the family they student mother for me they wanted them to be buried the following sunday saturday someday and that saturday was pastor moya's son wedding celebration brother we have a spirit all over yeah and that's why we find out that people are in the churches but no new birth in savanka in reconnaissance on the renaissance no new birth sound of renaissance and the people start putting pressure election commercial not even taking into consideration the condition of their pastor a memphis consideration on the condition of our pastor this is how human beings always are everywhere are you going to be in the funeral or are you going to be in the party and you know people start even people who don't go to church so they may jump into our english they become more spiritual are you different from spiritual they start giving quote come on suddenly in the book of ecclesiastes better to be in the funeral than to be in the party of faith but god gave us a little bit of reserves not to say but it will be a vain scriptural battle and combat vendors equitable we have to use wisdom do you want to say that yes what to do or fair and the marriage was in belgium city on basic about a four hour drive of course in course the category and the wedding was scheduled too and uh past the sun and the past the family said past the first time you came for the wedding passage because we were scheduled to leave france to go to belgium on thursday two days before the wedding hotel room already booked but it was a tough decision message dave come on in decision julio but god did the help made you inside there finally with the pastor's condition finally conditioned you pastor you remember seeing him here oh why he could not make a trip the same day and be in good condition to attend the party so the pastor left with his family on thursday hello and i was forced to stay with my wife aged foxy the restaurant farm to do the funeral service a fairly selfish neighborhood i don't know the way people are done ask one of the local ministers to perform the service oh they found the salvation philanthropy but you know the people go talk to the sisters you know you are in this church this is the time you have to see what the church is going to do for you but it's a very very sad situation first of all my situation twister somebody has lost their husband i can crap your marriage instead of encouraging oh you're the you are coming with some things to put her down but uh we did the service on uh that saturday night for your selfish remember someday we want to we finished the service and then we took the car to belgium but uh as i was doing the service sometimes your physio selfies ah i preach on a little bit a little observation on the book of job expressions but towards the end i felt an inspiration inspiration i started talking to the sisters ah you are now dad and mom for your children trivia empowering male 1 don't pay attention to the people sayings remember what happened with martin luther king what was martha's attitude messi quality to the mountain criticisms are always in the house people going instead of comfort somebody is to put somebody down already and you know sometimes you know a preacher remain a preacher and i told the people now you come to fill out their church for the funeral but where are you seeing the brother in the hospital now you are trying to put the system down i mean obviously say they have still and i'm pretty much sure as soon as the body is laid down in the casket or in the in the ground or she took a like you keep the attitude like a martyr girl like you cheat come out and the conclusion was a conclusion we are leaving a critical time envy doesn't critique if you don't pay attention switching quite patterns people what the devil was trying to do the second job they said the first try to discourage and their plan was played well by the living god in the point of being shrieked sometimes we travel a different way god saw the need ahead of beijing and you just go you don't even know evo jesus but even those people making a lot of noise when it came time to put the money for the burials it was not you have a production they have to call everywhere you live out too oh you know people already said they shouldn't say we are waiting for the church contribution contribution that exists where the church is going to get the money from us the only place the church will get the money is from the believers but if you believe it don't do it mercifully quiet from the faith you are causing a problem between the pagan and the church because the pagan will say church do pascal agree to the affair but the church also knows may the villages say or something but you did not contribute we are obligated to our own new summer blizzard and not have popcorn any time like that you cannot give nobody caught on the top let us live right and what i tell you about getting some coverage for your families it's valid so america bless you hello and uh if you follow the news how many heard the speech from

translator hallelujah god bless you this is our first time in denver to meet you and now we meet face to face [Applause] can i just let you have your seats for a moment i know this is a busy weekend and i've heard of some that are getting married and many traveling but it's so nice to be able to be with you in fellowship nice to have sister brooke the smith here today sister brooke lives just a few miles from us nice to have you here and we have been streaming your services so you might not know us and we are here to uh get to know brother fosten a little more so we great brother fosten and sister anne today [Music] i was communicating with a pastor in uganda today and they have a 42-day lockdown six-week lockdown i see we see some of that confirming they cannot even go out and drive and go to church so we're thankful we can be here today i know you believe the message we believe the message and we're going to live in the same place amen amen so we might as well start getting to know one another now hallelujah we're all one family for me so let's stand today and turn to the scripture the word is the main thing so we want to give it our time today psalms chapter 34 let's read together in psalms 34. and then psalms 51. and the lord already pre-planned the service program and i didn't know who was going to be here i don't know but the lord jesus knows your personal life individual so i'm not going to preach way up in the clouds somewhere there's things very specific that the lord gave us a message to deliver today [Music] for predestinating us [Music] we can put up a little front and a little facade [Music] but speak very clearly we surrender to you we submit to you may the holy spirit just cover every life in the name of jesus christ amen amen now if we had a weekend of services on weekends two or three services by the end we'd get to know each other but we don't have time for that [Music] psalms 34 17. the righteous cry and the lord heareth amen and delivereth out of all their troubles amen the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart amen and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit the bible says [Music] but the lord delivereth him out of them all he keepeth all his bones to sizzle not one of them is broken i want you to be thinking spiritually but you are the body of christ he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken have you ever heard of a broken heart how many has heard of a broken heart but when the healer comes he touches the broken heart we're going to speak about spiritual heart conditions today can we can we turn to psalms 51. let's compare verse 15. versace [Music] oh lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirous not sacrifice else would i give it thou delight us not in burned offerings so what is god looking for this morning the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit is this the bible that's what god is looking for from denver colorado colorado a broken spirit breeze a broken and a contrite heart oh god thou wilt not [Music] now if you would go into a hospital and the church is like a hospital you don't find a lot of people jumping around and oh happiness and joy a lot of times so today as we come in the front door we passed the waiting room we are also going past the birthing room it's not just a general md [Music] but we need the holy spirit to touch us in deep places of our lives and that's where [Applause] and it's not just our souls you'll see there is healing for our spirits and also healing for our bodies i believe right in this service today it's about 11 29 a.m that in the next few minutes someone in this meeting can be totally delivered completely oh so don't let your heart become hardened because of the age we're living in a cause is that true many hearts have become hardened but it's coming from a spiritual heart conditions that much of their natural lives is being reflected from a spiritual condition now if you look back in the scripture that we read in psalms chapter 34 verse 18 when the bible says the lord is nigh unto them that are careful satan can come in and he can crush a heart he he seeks to destroy alive that god wants to rescue him a heart that has been broken in pieces a heart that is crushed a heart that has been a wreck as i just saw coming to the service this morning i didn't mention it to brother foster her sister anne but just looking over the overpass there was a very but the lord is near to you today you might have had plans you might have had a schedule you might have wanted things to be in a certain way and the holy spirit is here today to say that it's not over i am here to heal you he's close to the brokenhearted and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit only about you that word contrite it means to be brought to the dust have you ever been around someone that has been heavy-hearted maybe this service today is for [Music] because you thought it was all over pete but the heart specialist just walked into the room the angel of the lord is in the service now in psalms chapter 51 verse 17. this is another amazing scripture say what is god desiring what does he want of end-time message tabernacles what is the mind of the lord for us let's read it from the bible the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit the sacrifice amen see that's what i'm offering up to god i don't even have much words to say sister i really don't know what to say just a few words just in a few moments he makes it right and he gives you wings to fly uniforms we all love oh we love when it's in the valley [Applause] on the top [Music] they don't grow in the snow it's when you're when relationships are shaken you so i'm not asking today hello vision demand possible who is being who is so strong today the lord is dealing with those that are of a broken spirit he's visiting you with a message that a broken and a contrite heart oh god oh dear thou will not despise you [Music] i'm not gonna push you aside i'm not gonna preach to the 99. you know brother john could do that i'm a visiting minister come and preach to the 90 and 9. i'm here to speak to the one measure friends we don't need a four-hour sermon we need a word fitly spoken a word now if you're not in need of a physician doctor if you don't need a doctor doctor you just drive right by the hospital drive right by the way [Music] do you have time oh i thought we were supposed to be strong we have a lot of sisters that are strong spiritually oh it gets real quiet but what about those that are poor in this mechanic i want to say hey [Music] but i what a scripture from the great physician he's not speaking about all the outside in the parliament exterior john 14 verse 1. bride of christ [Applause] there's a lot of heart conditions in the world today and we need the lord to help us in those conditions today we're not speaking so much about a natural we did not come to denver denver to talk about your warm weather or your baseball team keep the football there's three things today he said it's been some time ago i was speaking to someone about that he's talking to a scientist and things about how when jesus died he said it was not because of the roman spear that he died neither was it the loss of blood that he died he came to his own and his own received him he died he had a broken heart can you see that let it go and to save time later down into the quote paragraph 31. he's talking about our makeup as believers we're we're not like that he had to be god he was can you see that on the screen high five king but he's my king amen he's our lamb and it wasn't a nice little wooly lamb white island i came to my own all gave son a deuce on the naked shoes but not all some gave all man talking about the military the parliamentary military sam [Music] [Music] [Music] chance so that you could be free so that you're loved whatever is happening in your life right now important i love but you can you put that leave that on the screen died that a person can die of a broken heart this is when brother john wished we had two or three services but we've got to just stay with the message stay with what god said you told you to say remember there will be times as believers that we also face i don't want to hurt your feelings but life isn't always beautiful life isn't always good times america is not heaven i'm sorry if someone told you america is and i think we're all finding that our hope is in the word of god not just in 1963 is seeking thank you jesus messages in amen now let me just be real honest today it's good to be honest if brother branham was standing behind this pulpit he had a certain she went into the restroom and she shut the door and there was a pain there was something she was going through she didn't even tell you brother but sister and i'm sure that sister would say praise [Music] and he would just say something to you evil director maybe publicly republican but it was privately messed up wouldn't that give you faith god knows me he knows my [Music] [Music] he's not got his hands all tied because william brown and pastor william that same gift of god do you believe that but i really have a question measure [Music] i'll go to my last example just keep the scripture up here but the last example this is number three i'm jumping ahead brother brown i'm in the message brother branham in paragraph 171 says you can still receive the same holy ghost that they received there talking about in the book of that only coming to the end of the service he preached the whole service and he said you can receive the same thing tonight just follow through that's all you do yes then you can say and i think you know this song in denver brother patrick [Music] patrick [Music] [Music] million [Music] [Applause] and he's speaking in paragraph 173 continues on in the atmosphere he'll continue atmosphere paragraph 174 weather plane now is there one isaiah here tonight or a hundred who else that wants to go what's and you're he said if you want to come i'm here to pray with you yes next paragraph bhagavatam nice name i offer you the opportunity to come no no opportunity god [Music] now i wonder if brother branham was here today and said would you like prayer most of us be there i want to be around the process i'm not ashamed paragraph 176 if there's a back slider in here would you come here i'm asking you as a servant of christ if you'll walk down here it their hearts had become hard paragraph 177 we asked for those without the baptism of the holy spirit but that wasn't the case there was a lot of spiritual heart conditions that was underneath the site men and women what happened last night oh [Music] no one's coming personally he said i presumed you're prayed up and things he starts talking about this paragraph 178 paragraph concept one brother now raise your heads said there's one man bowed here at the altar i trust to be in isaiah amen amen now he said now he is here he let you see do you believe he's here quiet now i'm going to tell you what you've done the horriblest thing you ever done there is two or three hundred people here ought to be at the altar now that's a ministry that goes beyond the surface and he goes through 11 discernments and i've got them all here in our notes and goes right

stewart if we sit here mr stewart mr brown oh by mr brown would you want to be nervous [Music] a lot of our attitudes would be uh just get over it hello hello you but the lord eternally delivereth them out of them all right is anything too hard for the lord i see some of you are taking your afternoon nap already i'm then he says paragraph 193 there's a group of you in here ought to be at this altar seeking the holy ghost that's thus saith the lord god is speaking to people in here a little bit in doubt so brother keeps working with him will you be honest too but he said the holy ghost is never wrong and the song is being played in the background i'll be quick to answer thee he's just working with the people and then in paragraph 194. telling you nothing wrong holy spirit there is hundreds in here if you believe me to be a prophet i'm telling you in the name of jesus you've been deceived i don't care what your name is there's [Music] looking responding to the world and he

doing come on how's daddy doing how's the pastor doing but you let something bad happen to that brother something bad happened to that system there ought to be a welling up of love and not [Music] the bible says god is love so if we don't have a a whale of godly love toward people that we have met unveiled [Music] hello hello the whole world can be against you [Music] but if you've got jesus inside there will be the right response so it's not everybody else it's me oh lord change my heart challenge your channel change my spirit put your heart i'm gonna put hello i want to put my spirit in you so in victory day there was a young lady yeah they had an interview with brother branham and she had lost her mind about and when she was a little girl of about 12. he talks about chicago chicago in the

lapel says you've got a murmuring heart the doctor says you can't live to 15 years old but thus saith the lord now how many parents are here if that would have been your little 12 year old girl and the doctor said three more years how many parents are come here that would have been your child my child had a murmuring father from 12 [Music] and she never never even failed a heart trouble since elijah man god knows how to deal with but i can see by the conditions your heart's not right so you can get an attitude you can roll your eyes [Applause] more than we believe the word of god sister it's that sisterhood she's got a brokenness away my heart's good you're my problem the biggest hypocrisy no no no no you should have responded to them do you know that the women of a church reflect the teachings of the church brother branham talked about the condition of the women and they are reflecting the teachings of a church los angeles do you know that young people reflect the revelation of their parents yeah brother branham talked about women before [Applause] it's reflecting our spiritual experience with god now people will not admit that no no especially in laodicea [Music] [Music] [Music] they want to cast stones and others they don't want to take personal responsibility they don't want to take personal accountability they want to keep propping up something something of their past they're trying to divert attention divert attention days ago the lord jesus put these thoughts right on i wrote them down on a piece of paper don't be a believer there's always shake in your [Music] [Music] [Music] christ in your life you find it in the bible jesus never says jesus he was the lord so when he said foreign but the lord jesus would love another 30 comments and talk to

no mission i'm here to work on your house i'm here to talk to you about your bank account or what kind of car you drove to get here make it ever whoever not the 150 or hundred that later did the song say brother john you can't sing but the point got across we gotta get to jesus [Music] when i was 12 years old i had a murmuring heart but the lord jesus and i have not had any problems with it since the problem of excellent a spiritual heart trouble she's 23 but it's a spiritual heart trouble mercy and problem spiritual her lover had run off and married some other woman yet she was still in love and this boy is a garcon kept telling that he was in love yet with her continue and then his father had caused it are we all together brother branham said oh nonsense he didn't have to marry the other girl he didn't because he failed to have the right kind of love for you [Music] she lived in that one little world by herself is it possible that one of us can actually be living in another world and it's not even real it's not even real cinnamon i'm asking a question is it possible let someone be living in a whole world they are living in a little world by themselves we form ourselves in there for days for weeks it's not even real cinnamon and it causes [Music] yes many times our natural relationships if we can't live together with one another on earth well i'm going to live way over here
