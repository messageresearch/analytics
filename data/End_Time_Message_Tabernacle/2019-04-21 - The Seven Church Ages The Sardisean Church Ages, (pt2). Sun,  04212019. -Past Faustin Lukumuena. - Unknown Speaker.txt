and then the second night was the debate or the second night was Jesus at before Caiaphas and before Pilate second unit is in the home Caiaphas is even polite he was a community we spoke about showing that first we had in the message in the message I know I'll miss as you see fog of 68 I'm just gonna I know 68 it takes it's taken her up 68 he will just skip to where I highlighted it's taken its M&A and so you cannot talk about it in a pack if you don't talk about money and you don't talk about so to celebrate in a pack you have to come first we said that the Garden of Gethsemane was the place he made his final decision as we read in the message the communion paragraph 46 it was in the Garden of Gethsemane City does not indicate emoney that Jesus felt the most pain of his life in contact when it is envy and we said also that each one of us has to experience experiment is a propagate see money and when you experience it come with the experiment about to get some money you cannot blame anybody the public I cannot don't to point the finger to anybody knocks on the door look at Jesus he was innocent a Latino so he was arrested in eternity and what made him he's gets em any more painful anything gets money to try to please kiddos because brother but in that great crucial don't see CLO until he suffered knowing all things is meticulous Sufi oniisan to choose until the water and the blood is separated in his body he [Music] died more death in Gethsemane than he did on the cross so that means Calvary even with all the nails all the cause or the pain electively clue to die more in the Garden of Gethsemane now I want you to understand this unique you companies I see what caused his death in the Garden of Gethsemane more than on the course click on Mouse out in the kitchen Monique aliquot somebody can beat you ok came to fatty cannon nail you know Chloe sometimes you know the pain you don't feel it a default upon I dunno because it's already too much a pancetta beaucoup but the best the hardest death that Jesus had in the garden of gethsemane 2010 getting money it's because city comes thinking it was in the garden of gethsemane teams are dedicating money that Jesus felt he was betrayed by his own brother sister keep this in mind in sec you'll get the money Righetti money is when you are gonna be betrayed essay contest comes every ke and the betrayal will not come from somebody far enjoy Jesus was for second the course a illa llah which means my father my father so putting all these things together meant to say that was more pain in the garden of getting money we knew some people they get some witchcraft witchcraft they goes to steal - they know that if they arrest you hae-sun kihyun's ahead they will be - as some kind of witchcraft complain they don't fill it in some time you are gonna fill it so people like that incomes don't tell them that they are gonna die more on the course feels really the Bride of Christ when is the following Christ a key sweet crystal must also experience we wanted to see show you see so from that we move to the next night talking about Jesus before first he went before Caiaphas and then before Pilate Pilate and we say that pilot in the pillar is the governor say something to save that man vacations over Satan but instead nimoy he took the water in a pillow to wash his and then we said in the blood of Jesus listen disease because when he washes up on us don't you know not only upon myself as you know on our to see that's why every generation to generation until today his cup with its pressure as the blood of trying to wash it i seven today love it it's not gonna work I miss Alabama she so the only resolution resolution is to take that blood asleep wanna see song put it in the heart met one girl that's the only way you can be saved come on the simple case of a you can pass it to the people I cannot do anything take it to the past remains you know my wife my husband it's not gonna work that's why we see in the seven churches the last Church not hot Oh Pasha no cold neutral neutral Network that's the position of opposition de la DC so that was the second night it was Jesus crucified he and then we saw the crucifixion on Friday night and now I have a question we said that Jesus died on Friday is that three days hey Joe I'm just asking he died Friday 3:00 p.m. yeah cancel but Sunday morning he resurrected material ethnicity by the VA's ICU just doing this question came for three days and three nights is that why you were 20 did not even come to Sunday to start this morning it was early one morning they kept his body in the ground over the Sabbat a song called on his soul which was a customary that they wish but I cannot follow you they didn't do anything on this Sabbath so he died Friday afternoon at 3 o clock a limo in front so I can say and hose up real early Sunday morning my turn no no I want to settle this question I tell you that you know why you are here this morning in this sunrise service Pinocchio said you see my service deliberately many people says this on diesel how comes then that he said that he would he was in the grave in the common pleas of disability don't that tombow three days and three nights why should convey what I'm saying gee he never said he will do that I didn't as a medical explanation he said within these three days what is it well will I raise up my body system uncle now the reason he did that is because deputy said the kid Nevada region one place in the scripture I will not leave his soul in hell his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption support emotions of corruption and he knew that corruption is a regular cohesion set in human body after 72 hours it's a regular coefficient of Italy comea precept on these three days and night when we and sometime it within that three days and night the sequential economy God was going to raise him up a Jew Davila necessity so he died on Friday afternoon in silly moment register at 3 o clock at congeal and rose up early Sunday morning thank you madam amen so that all they think we our Easter service and we thank God for it in unison opposition and we said on the third day and I want you to enjoy Jesus on Calvary gzo kasnia why did he die on Calvary did you know what was the purpose equally beat Jesus in dying in on Calvary she was showing us one lesson Stepan's upon doin lesson that Cal what anyway what is the meaning of Calvary because we cannot just rejoice for he died on Calvary we must have a personal revelation we said that Calvary men continue to live for others Jesus life going to Calvary the village is a alone Calva was not for himself apollomon it was for you and he put a puma he bought myself a lobotomy Faldo all my lies all my iniquities he took all of this in a plea to Cena so that he can open up a way for you and I to be saved in value that was of it God why that day on Calvary when he died only more this son the creation shame to see the Creator naked on Diwali 80 on youth and the rocks from the mountain was in pieces in addition a on day and the veil of the temple was opened yet only disunity showing that you have now free access if you are not safe if it's your own wheel blood when Jesus died on Calvary bail was open negative to show that that Holy of Holies where in the past only the high priest could access open silly Somali civil insanity a vaccine and when the high priest was going in that place in Sacramento they had a cord attached to his leg ASAP because if he died nobody can go there - they will just move this the code athina and if they see him moving unify a boozy the congregation were happy confuse interceding for my when they move me : bujji no action connection he's dead anymore they will just put would have been in the fight in the face of the law it event go to the University senior so and the high priest would Molly into there once a year Salman cases in for felony but since that day on Calvary positional calcium we don't have annual remission of your sins if you only see single patient just to go fix it that's why would they don't bring the lamp anymore I mean Phil I knew because Jesus was the perfect landscape in a new town faith the only thing to do less anxious affair is to accept I mean so since that day in the position they fail being open let me do that brother you have access to you don't need high priests to take your sins and go over experiment fishy og in the Old Testament going in there Antonia was deaf today so each one of us so there is knowledge sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself in certain mother may but you accepted laxity just for the sake of somebody maybe weak just pull a cold not when some poetry fabulous because if we have to fight the veil was open so that we can follow him I think you know personally see that was the meaning of Calvary so that we can follow efficiently Steve and Christ dying on Calvary he showed us a way that we have to live for others in the pool is not living for not to live for those who are doing wrong to you pues aquí who fed you mal but you are living for those who hurt you no confetti mal that's what Christianity I mean not living for my own any particular Pullman pop but living for others even policing because if Jesus was that low that much selfish impulses a desicion attend you go selfish we could not be saved me so he sacrificed his life and I sacrifice my V so that you can leave I think you appreciate this one amen so you to lose you see you have to learn how to sacrifice your life for somebody to give us a key vodka via Pookie not concern vivo that's why can you find that code living for others not to live for those who do good unto you the privacy of the confetti bunches you buddy to live for especially those who hate you maybe if my special mapaseka was a Haitian and we said that what eternal life is alleged to have eternal eternal life the eternal is to live for Liverpool Azad don't be too selfish in Etobicoke hit Jesus if Jesus could be selfish just a little bit cheaper veggies infinitely great you could not be saved it was in the message that they want Carver go a little bit someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names ok Kennedy community wish I can see the jobs a brilliant L know that L know you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man thank you on a shitty laptop so no you become sons the veneer ism and the trouble of it is is it hoobly the church has forgotten they were sons this outbreak is a dead official you are sons visit the feast you are taking Christ place we need a plastic priest you are sons at the feast so don't live for yourself alone evil men live for others result well brother branham wealth Capernaum I can live for this brother a GP Philippoussis man because he sure is a nice masculine Punto no that's not it a machine a pasilla live for that man the Tom who hates you he was I live for that person develop of the opposite a son who would kill you if they could que pueda with us will prevail that's what they done to him as a second theology they killed him on you at you and he died that we might save Thank You pesetas Pookie jump aside cassava that's when you get that's in your bosom Adam focus on you are facing heaven then objet Faisal CL but you sacrifice your own things to fill up openSUSE give them up like the Sheep gives its lool a donate to silicon you look on toward Culver mechanical valve so that's eternal life society needs to live for somebody somebody who does good to you like a king q50 if somebody does good to you and Jesus was those people who hated to see key lies they spilled on his own conscience who they beat him they criticized Jesus said Father forgive no bitterness in the penalty no fighting back pass the baton on jealousy but I shall see not if self-defense I'm a pain self-defense no no Jesus said major Zod this is what that day on Calvary is a key to local ignition if the church ceremony please they believer the quail can have eternal life eternal we will not see all the bite biting back that's why I'm doing this exalt themselves so much is exact if we are actions when they ask listen to the accusation it could Leo's accusation kalmo sometimes that wisdom is just quiet they say that you said it you are God Oh nad cubes that g-shot also uncouth my point you said it Lavie did being called names let this Easter I mean that's Christianity and select facility so as we started last Sunday on the seven ages we are going to with the seven churches age 50 Thank You mr. should be every day wait until when the world declared this day that took Jesus out of the grave if it's it will take you also out of the nomination out of your out of your tradition to follow crystal I think I will not be longer since some people were here since a long time we are in the book of Revelation chapter 3 we are just going to read the first two verses and for title I will speak on the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things said he that as the seven spirit not is capital S the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works that thou has a name that thou leave us and our dead but those who have diversion invisible they said a Cree a large delegate the title was his second D v de jure Silvia Oh sod sorry for C second e silica ELISA test we did you ele set at one je connais deserve Jessica Terry Pascoe at Aviva atrium or you will notice those who have ELISA go the translation is different in English it says I know thy works and that thou has a name that our livers and our dead a name that you live but you are dead yeah but that better predict our translation but those weevil Rhys ago the word name is not in the Bible I want you to notice that it so you can be small things but it is a very meaningful because as we continue to thank you brother we continue to preach you will see we will put a lot of emphasis on the word name and when you have your own research on Bible you will not see the word name because they they have a name that they are they leave us but they are dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain they are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God amen may the Lord are the blessing to the reading of the scripture so I will certainly continue with the seven church ages but I will make a bridge to touch also some aspect of Easter this way we get all the two parts so in the message this audition church age fog of twenty-eight when brother Bonham preach it it was ended at night say now tonight we are beginning on the fifth church age which is the church age of Saudis and that church age began in 1520 and ended in 1750 and that age of what we call Reformation age so the fifth church age if you can recall what we wanted to those are the seven church ages before that it was the Pentecost when Jesus was crucified and he was ascended to heaven he sent down the holy spirit this holy spirit that came on the day of Pentecost started the church ages for the Gentile so from the first the first to church ages where they aged the missionary age to reach out to people with the fire of the Pentecost the next two edges where the Dark Age this is where the Catholic Church was created and many Christian also were killed but when we come to the fifth church age which is where we start studies and the next church age those are the edges of Reformation and the following will be a prophetic age with the full restoration so here we are talking about a 50 church age with Luther as the messenger and we according to the Bible the seven church ages teaching is a great mystery because the forum the book of Revelation chapter 1 verse 20 you know you read the book of Revelation it's talking about mystery mystery mystery but the mystery must be unfold the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand when talking about the right and is the mighty power of God and a seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches so that means every church age as a star and a star is a messenger so according to the Bible the period of the Gentile is divided in seven Church ages number seven which is which is the fulfillment all of the plan so all the time given to the Gentile in a seven period and for each period they add a star and these seven stars are the angels of the seven churches so that means every church age they add a messenger somebody who received a message from God to give to the people that's why the Bible said the mystery of the Seven Stars the seven messengers or the seven stars is a mystery why a mystery a mystery is something that is written in the Bible where a supernatural element is attached to despite the revelation that is given they can tell you this is what it is there is a still a supernatural element that requires God to come and reveal to you this is how God is known God is not known intellectually God is not by revelation that's why Jesus there Holly's ministry even though he was with the disciples one day he was looking at them those people are good they attended church but I don't know if they have the revelation of what coming to church me therefore he said one day what do you say I am question this one said oh you are Jeremiah because they think we are talking like Jeremiah are you are Isaiah because it's a fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah somebody said you are one of the Prophet Jesus said no you are just guessing till one day I have to preach a message why Peter when it said the group of the people the disciple it's always a Pete always a Peter to deny Peter the keys Peter why Peter to yourself why Peter so Peter didn't read what you say always the Peter Peter said you are Christ the Son of the Living God hallelujah jesus said what you say perfect it's not the blood or the flesh or seminary or hitting books and tapes even total things are good but the revelation don't come that way it's coming from my father therefore Peter I will build my church upon that all the Catholics and Peter is the first pope but let me tell you Peter according to history Peter never been to work number two Peter was a married man if you read the Bible Jesus pray for the poor Peter Madison no but you st. Peters of the first pub non pub is married so that you miss it what religious I said I build my church upon that revelation that PETA ad of womb Jesus worse damage the church is built upon the revelation of who Jesus is amen not the revelation of a pop or a prophet no the revelation of who Jesus is and then Jesus said once that church is built upon that revelation the gates of Hell will never prevail what does it mean that means the gate of hell will fight that revelation of who Jesus is that's why you see in many churches they try to substitute the center of Jesus to put somebody else where ever I am told us all the revelation that latest revelation is the supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ because that the foundation of the church you can put the seven seals you which whatever you want but if in your revelation Jesus Christ deity Iza neglected that revelation is wrong amen so that's where the church was founded amen and Peter was an apostle peter was a prophet that's why the Bible said we are built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets so prophet and apostle that's our foundation amen so we see here as we read a mystery revelation 1:20 this is the mystery the seven stars that means the seven messenger it's a mystery I always challenge anybody any Bible scholar you can say you know the Bible but when I give you revelation 1:20 the mystery of the seven star the seven star the seven stars are the angels what are the angel the angel are messengers that means every church age on the top we have the seven church edges on the top we have this top seven Church ages seven messenger that means every church age as its own messenger I have heard many preachers from any denomination I never heard one trying to tell the people the first star is a porn the second is so-and-so no they don't touch it why it's a mystery but we thank God because revelation 10 at the voice of the seventh angel when he will start sounding all the mystery what is the mystery nice the mystery of God revealed when Christ will come and a seven angel begin to sound all the mystery will be unfolded and I challenge any prophet I any minister to give me the name according to him and we will take the name we will go check eastery if you come with Saint Patrick I will tell you now San Martin was better you can with Polly cup or we say no he was leaning a little bit more to what denomination amen only the Holy Ghost came in william branham ministry to show him the first messenger is the paul ii stirred etc so all the messengers after Paul they must be dragged upon that's why Paul the first messenger he was courageous by centering the people the gospel I preached I'm not the shame of it if an angel from heaven come and say something contrary let him be accursed whether you better know who you are Amen if there is another ministry they give them mystery name you say or maybe the first messenger was Peter Peter was to the Jews back to the Gentile in support amen and a policy you know even the big part was never with Jesus but the Peter he was with Jesus he Jesus experienced that's why I don't care or I was with a brother branham it's a good experience but what is your present tense hallelujah we want to see your experience today oh brother when I or brother you know when I was in the tabernacle whatever when I'm told me something special told me something special that's you I don't care for me he said what is on the tapes what he told you special is your speciality amen so Paul said if an angel come and preach something different let him be accursed amen so Paul knew what he was speaking and in the book of Acts Paul said I know after me qu and wolf will come and that's why we've seen the history after poll in the Pergamon church age the accrual wolf came 325 the Nicene council they gathered they crucify the world and that start a duck age but from the fifty-eight we see the reform study amen so the same important from this first messenger must follow the rest of the messengers so every messenger that anybody will appoint make sure you line up with a pole amen pull open the aged in the last days there should be only another star we will close the edge and in order to know him look at the pattern of Paul Paul was a sinner trying to persecute the believer but one day on his way to Damascus he made a pillar fire so if you say you are the last messenger so as the purifier [Music] not your so-called pillow fire but the pillow fire that will be certified by the FBI lesyk George came he studied a picture that was taken in 1950 with the bureau fire they studied they say it's genuine amen so the last messenger must be like Paul Paul open the aged and a last messenger after close the edges amen Paul and a pillow fire the last messenger we must see also the pillow fire Paul said the gospel I preached I did not study it in seminary even though Paul was a student of Gamaliel Paul tonight is teaching of Gamaliel he said what I'm teaching I receive it from God the last messenger said I never went to school all that I'm teaching from the Holy Ghost amen Paul said even an angel come don't listen to him the last messenger came repeat what is on the table because I preach like Paul so if you bring me a name of a messenger I will not have any problem but I have to listen to everything that many said until I will hear that we push like you pork now if we can hear her and say I also put drag Paul we will say what is your vision because of Branham who pitch like a pole there was a vision we are resting on that a man shall the people from the edge of Paul be judged if they will be mine also will be because I preach like Paul and there was a multitude and they say are they all the banner oh no they are your converts their people who believe your message Amen that the people that will be gathering somewhere blessed be the name of the Lord so the spirit of the message that's what we are hitting here in the Bible do you think first verse one verse chapter three and the angel and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis you see the even the scripture when there is a letter written to the age it's singular I'm to the angel one person singular angel not to the Angels Oh John also Andrew Oh pastor to ensure no no no no no no the Bible is clear one angel you better find that angel and in order to find that angel you go to revelation 1:20 to unfold that mystery amen but we thank God because he came himself he revealed that mystery he clearly said whether he was not ashamed he said clearly first messenger Paul I Venice Martin : Luther Wesley and me amen he was not ashamed now you show me somebody he made Clem he's a messenger this is the real messenger let him give the names but don't copy the name and tell us how you see because the one I'm speaking of when he was preaching had himself the angel came and wore the same picture what a supernatural vindication blessed be the name of the Lord so the seven Spirit of God the Bible said he that had the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars now what are the seven spirits of God what are the seven Spirit of God that means God has a seven spirit let me tell you what the Bible said what he says because at the opening of every age Christ introduces himself so here in the age of Saudis he introduced himself as the one who has the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars who had the seven Spirit of God and the Seven Stars what are the seven spirits the seven spirit are all Irina's that the sever Spirit of God in other words it's the same Holy Spirit that God has given to the church ages will take the message here in the Saudi a sedition church age paragraph 73 now from the salute of the church age of Ephesus or Saudis we are going to read this further 73 now the salute yes now they salute now the seven spirits are the seven spirit and notice the spirit is always capital S and the seven stars seven stars there is no capital S in the stars that earthly stars Paul Iranians etc but a seven spirit that was put into the seven stars those the seven spirits are the Holy Spirit of God and Branham said their spirits was the angels that went to the star which were messengers seven spirits 7ty are seven different times their holy spirit would anoint a messenger which was a star in his day so do you understand the seven spirit it's the seven times that the Holy Spirit has anointed a vessel on the earth with the same spirit that fall on the day of Pentecost and start the world in the pole this is how God in salute the Church of Sardis a spirit is eternal and a star that was made for a purpose to reflect light in the dark of this church edges where candles and stars are representing the angel the spirit was the one that went to be star and reflected the light of the holy spirit through his daddy sister to that church age then you wonder who the seven spirits are as we read in the Bible those seven spirit what are the seven spirits it's the seven messengers of the seven church ages see and each time that the stock came in on the scene the Holy Spirit came down and anointed that star and kept it just exactly like the first one was that means the subsequent messengers must be lined up with the spirit that was on Paul the same spirit that fall on the day of Pentecost amen now let me confirm that to you Paul said if you want to know what kind of a star it was because remember Satan is a star to Satan as his messengers sent an unwanted show is the people that's why you see some people you can really discern this is not the normal thinking this is not the Spirit of God this is not the Spirit of Christ it's a spirit of center how do you know Jesus said by his food when you see too much bitterness too much anger too much jealousy you know I tell none writings but when you see the spirit was upon Paul upon Brennan he said over there only perfect love will enter no bitterness watches regardless of what somebody has done to you you have no right to the root of bitterness unless you are from the seed of K men so now notice Paul who believed he was a star to the Ephesus church he said if you want to know whether is - or not in relation 1:8 Paul said speaking there that after the time would come and gave us worlds and so forth if an angel come down from heaven and touched any other gospel regardless from which denomination he came from regardless which level of education he has if he preaches something different than Paul preached let him be accursed and Branum in the last days with the biggest question of marriage and divorce because when you read a Bible the Bible said a man and a woman should be married only once you cannot get married if you have a living spouse if you want I can give you the scripture rather give me Luke Luke chapter 16 verse 18 the Bible said whosoever look 1618 David is not there no he's nobody there so open your Bible brothers in the look chapter 16 the Bible said verse 18 whosoever put us away his wife and married another committed adultery that's the Bible and Apollo said nobody can add nobody can take away even if an angel come from heaven he cannot change this we should ever put away his wife and marry another one committed adultery whosoever married her that he put away from her husband committed adultery that means you marry somebody you are living in adultery and no adulterous person can ever eternal life that was the Bible there is no way around so with this the world was found in a condition of disgrace because of their false teaching we have found men married many times even women many times so therefore heaven door was closed Paul it comes in first Corinthians chapter 7 Paul said now it's me not the Lord hallelujah oh you will say oh brother we have to stay with the Bible a messenger get authority from the one who send him policy now it's not the Lord it's me if you are married with somebody and you are satisfied continue away let all the bottom comes oh I have a lot of friends they come to me asking me brother Branham we heard your sermon what shall we do what a bang Brian who was going to the tapes he said I'm ready to separate with my wife when I said wait until that angel the same angel who gave me the Commission when he will tell me then I will tell you when I'm a witch when I'm rich since 1933 I don't know but now knowing that his time is up February 21st 1965 he said now I'm going to preach on the question of marriage and divorce you listen to this and pay attention because of the same cloud that descended into shock they not told me to tell you stay where you are you are forgiven go your way if you are happy raise your children but tell your children never to do such a thing amen who's that man he said Moses address the question of marriage and divorce that's what they said Jesus what do you think Moses talked about the divorce letter what do you say Jesus said whosoever will put away his wife and take another or the case of Moses was even better Paul okay we talked to you about the last group that's why I said show me another star will come to give a message to the people about what they have done therefore this is a message of grace God has forgiven you go to the way you are now you have the knowledge regardless of what the men do regardless of the wife does there is no divorce we don't believe in divorce amen if you divorce stay like that there is no grace coming because there is no other messenger after oh you should love the Lord for the forgiveness he look at your condition according to what was written in the book of look many people were excluded but for this age God is descended given forgiveness for our benefit therefore you the children before you get married make sure because you know in the marriage vow when they marry the people I marry you for good and worse when we see worse that's what you promise before God my worse is worse no goddamn you and you have to stick with it not only that only death we shall be departed that means if you decide to depart before death you have no right to remain because you said before God and before the people only death so you have to wait until the other person die if the person has a longer life you have a longer try let us put it that way amen because before God even since the Garden of Eden he created female and male God doesn't permit divorce divorce is name of the devil that's why the young people before you get married make sure you know what you are doing if you are not sure wait don't let the pressure of the flesh and guide you you go with the pressure of the flesh you will get married just to have some pleasures tomorrow you are gonna hate that woman you are gonna hate that man and we will start looking around but in your marriage vows when you say for good and worse in the sickness in good health in hitches in poverty that was your vows Amen so if the men become poor you have to stay oh Jesus social unless in your vow you said only death and sorcery then we will if you did not say it then you cannot bring a new white light this is to tell the young people to think twice before you go because it's like what you see on the highway one way you go just this way if you take another opposite direction you will be killed right away because all the car will meet you and your car will be smashed because it's a one-way marriage is one way the Bible said in the book of Proverbs 2025 David Webb 2025 the Bible said it's a snare so don't just be oh I'm gonna get married the person doesn't want me to get married maybe the bus is trying to help you knowing what is before you when the purpose of love this friend I have no explanation I just say no because it's a snare the Bible said it is a snare to the man who devoured that which is holy marriage is holy and after vows to make inquiry people started thinking after they make the vow think before you make the vow sometimes people go with high-speed they say okay everything is fine you can talk they talk today they took the second their first talk is to break the ice the ice soon break broken the ice is the broken then they take the high speed train within a month I think we will have six children conversation shift talking about children and they get into sex that's how you don't see you don't know the person but you are influenced by the person sex that's what we see a lot of young sister today they make a lot of statement brother they don't know how to talk which is sometimes - they go to talk even partly monotony always how are you doing what did you eat what did you cook he come another day god bless you what did you cook what do you eat they go how they can like you even if their sister had a good disposition to do if they cook and I need somebody know how to talk look at you I like your outfit when you are in this very well when God was creating when he came to you six hour overtime to shape you that's what they like whether you have to know how to talk a superficial conversation all the time when you go talk you are not going to preach you know we are in the c57 church is that from when and where because they say that the husband is the husband of the church you start asking the question to you no no the wife will say no talk what is your vision of me I'm gonna buy all over for you that's what they want to listen you know I have a 800 score of credit that means I can buy over for me as I will marry you your labor is going to finish I cannot accept you to work the way you are working I will take more than that not only your knee dad your mom your siblings they will go to Harvard University hallelujah that's what they want to hear even if it's a lie and I'm telling you those who are successful are those who know how to lie the good brother they come with the fear of God by God's grace I will do my best that's the question reminder people they don't want to hear do i God's grace they want to hear a good life if you find a good liar and I'm telling you we have some in the group when they talk they are not low-level people they don't talk maybe a lot just what they call the catchy would not pay attention to all that you will discover him I was thinking you are together we went to get a light when you lie both to the past when the past will ask you did you talk you know they always ask that question I'm telling you swear never give him the answer because if you give him that you did I'm tell you he's not gonna I will not so lie you teach him to teach her to lie next person she's gonna lie - he's going to lie to you - lets go with the messengers going down to paragraph 77 this addition church age if you notice this this is what here the writer no look the seven spirit what capital S Holy Spirit only one of them so their spirit the seven messengers the seven spirit it's only one spirit and that the Spirit of God which is called the Holy Spirit so he sent the Holy Spirit to this angel to the next angel to the next angel it's always the same spirit we are built upon the same spirit the Holy Ghost cannot choose Martin Martin Luther and you come tomorrow with somebody else and say no well the Martin Luther this is somebody else but if you look at the three works of grace its justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's go look in history what was the teaching of Luther the teaching of Luther in this age was then just shall live by faith it's not your works you are saved by grace amen so show me somebody who preach that because their first work of the restoration of salvation justification and then Wesley came to preach on sanctification being justified to have a faith in God what Luther said is okay but besides that we need to be certified the church must be clean the believer must be clean that means inside you must be pure in your search you must be pure not somebody coming to church wearing dark glasses when they say let us pray the ice is always on the single system no no no that's not how you get married you must be pure jesus said Moses says don't commit adultery people say ah it's hard you made in all my life I have to live with one wife I have to live only with one man that's right in a marriage about are you going to forsake all others marriage well you have to forsake all with the eyes on Kathy Janet and so forth that's a forcible a real bow I'm coming to you all my love to you I will not look anywhere that's what Moses says and the people said that's too hard all those Moses like that Oh Jesus came a Savior let's go ask him the same question Jesus you know Moses told us we have wanted to live with one will show ever will look upon a woman Moses was even better because we could not do it physically but we could always take those multitude of women in our mind and satisfy our self that's why the sisters the way you present yourself to cover completely your body because they are so many men without the Holy Ghost they look at you they love you they take you where you are they take on their mind and they take you to the room if that happened because of your negligence that man is gonna be responsible for sin of a daughter and that adultery will not be with a tree will be with you that's why if I was a woman listen to this if I was a woman every day when I dress a dress I look at myself in the mirror if I was a woman I will be playing like that with a bunch of men lasting I don't want to be presented at the judgment bar that will be a big surprise summertime is coming you wear those alight clauses they show you under underneath clauses Oh tight clothes showing all your body all the things before all the sinners you will be surprised you're going to work with that manager and you change work all the time that was my manager to Walmart that was my manager was my manager not only that that was a brother in the church the one wearing always dark glasses that was the purpose of the dark glasses this way when the eyes are moving you can see but you cannot see the only guarantee is for you to pray Lord is it your will the way I'm like those people so that nobody can see today they are happy when they say it's a huge responsibility same way with the brothers if you are not safe it's time for you to sit for salvation with the beauty of all the women without the Holy Ghost you will last even after your story in the Bible with Tamar it's the spirit asked for you to be safe and I believe there was a man walk on this face of the there was plenty of a woman before if that spirit without that spirit is forcing people into something they are not tell the priest don't get married that's our doctrine you want to become a priest no marriage want to be coming on no marriage sometime people go there for good position better living money and so forth but they are not converted therefore they are the first one to last this is the truth you have to check it with yourself married or not married if you have that spirit you have to fight that's what the altar is I will not be happy to go to church every day with that spirit and I don't do anything about it no no that's deaf today Easter that's what the Bible said give me the scripture I'm gonna close here woman chapter 8 verse 11 the Bible says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit capital S that dwelleth in you today we celebrate Easter oh he came out of the gate as I say early this morning Jesus could not come out of the grave because when he was killed they took his body they put it in the grave and the scribe said make sure you put enough God to protect that term because that imposter was saying destroy this body I will bring it back in three days put a lot of God there at least for the next three days and we'll see how he will come out but the Bible said an angel of the Lord came in from heaven came down and when he came down he holding a stone and there was an earthquake to prove the stone why because there should be a power the body of Jesus that was in the grave it was a dead body because the spirit left Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane amen there was a spirit he was judging the mechanic and the mechanic could not come out of the game it required a dynamic dynamic which is the power and that's why the angel came with that power they're resurrecting power to go into the body and to bring him out and the blood of what I'm saying it was the day the dynamic that came to join into the mechanics that's why Jesus came to the resurrection now the Bible is telling us if the same dynamic that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it's shallow quick and your mortal body as well that means brother sister in order for you to leave the resurrection you must have that dynamic you must have the Holy Ghost because the way you are without the Holy Ghost it's just a mechanic called after coat rather well I'm said the Bible said you can have all those knowledge that's a mechanic and I can tell you where I put my condition you need the dynamic to be put on the mechanic pot this way the coach you know the Bible verse you know will be quickened by the Holy Spirit in order to subject this to flesh hallelujah to his win with the Holy Ghost it's just a form of religion completion that mechanic but with this with this with this morning Easter morning direction you have to look for that spirit when I will get married I will it's a big life you can be with your wife but you are not there you may be with the men you are not there because you have a spirit a lasting spirit that's why you see men and wife in their own bedroom watching pornography you see the men in the room watching mother come over and he's trying to go somewhere and when mother coming and the man is looking bringing demons in your home brother sister even if you are married you have no right to look at the nakedness of anybody that's why even people we are good friends good sisters you take shower rose your door I don't need to see your body and I don't want you to see mine same thing with men amen I don't have time to read the Bible about it it's your privacy when you see the men and the women naked posting on pornography to make movies that's devil in action you turn the television in your room you open the door for all the spirit to come that's why your situation will never change your problem will never be solved the sickness at home your children will be sick yourself because of the spirit your players are going nowhere we need the Spirit of God if the same spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body our body need to be quickened that's what Easter is about that's why the seven star and the seven spirit are about it's God sending is spirit among their people and the most hypocrite other people who look Saint on the outside but inside they are dead and the other people Jesus we are talking about what do they say white sepulcher whatever they are sepulchre in the outside painted in white you look and say a good term but if you open it they aren't stinking bones and that's the image Jesus used to preach to the people and that's what is among many people and that's what the gospel must attach those aspects to put those who are predestinated that's a holy man but there is no holy man oh that's a good man there is no good man that's what Jesus talked to that time each guy why do you call me good they're usually one good one good is God to be a good man to be a holy man to be a good woman to be a holy woman God must be in you that's why the Transfiguration Mountain they said it was a holy mountain it's not because the mountain was fully but it's because the holy God was on the mountain if the holy God is in you then you are a holy man all those desires are gone you look at your brother as the brother you will not default them you are not lying on their behalf no because you are good God is good is in you hallelujah and a good woman will look at the man only my husband I belong to my body this for him No may God bless you let us stand [Applause] we need the Holy Ghost we can do whatever we can giving sacrifices
