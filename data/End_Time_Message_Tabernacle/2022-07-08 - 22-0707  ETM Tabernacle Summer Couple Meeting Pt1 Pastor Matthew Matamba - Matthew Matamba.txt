wonderful initiative i just i'm going to begin at verse 21 in zola verse 17. submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word amen that he might present it to himself what kind of a church i probably did something amen a glorious church not having spot no wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought meant to love their wives as their own bodies amen he that loveth his wife loveth himself amen for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherished it cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this call shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband amen may the lord bless the reading of his word love your wife amen amen so i'm thankful to be here with my entire family and sister sarah and her husband brother steve they flew from dallas texas and i thank the lord for each and every one of you praise the sharon uh and uh and i see brother emmanuel and we're talking about couples and they are couples too we give thanks to god that was and god it's totally exactly the same way that christ loves the church exactly do you believe that yes so now i want to look into master peace and so it's in paragraph let's get um praise the name of the lord and he saw how that michelangelo had done it great work and he had made a statue of moses step and just like god before he did anything he had a vision in his mind he had a thought it comes uh and so for

impossible but one day there was a little girl in the city of nazareth and she was raised in the mean city of nazareth like denver uh like charlotte like any of the cities but in the midst of all that she kept her purity god and so how will these things be and gabriel told her the holy spirit will come on you the sentence the power of god factor of uh are you with me amen what if god told you that sister said uh what would you think that's good reasoning or go to work but god doesn't have powers of reasoning and god behold faith in the word how can i do uh oh my that guy's there wonder if we

figure just like that and you down here by faith you're claiming it i am the right kind of husband um oh [Music] how shall he not with him also freely give us all things amen [Music] amen do you see what i'm talking about he what could be of any more value to a father than his only begotten son canada some of my leftover notes from the last night right before this remember not see by offering isaac abraham was making a statement abraham taught the pharaoh and in the classroom that he valued god more than his own sons but we need a million dollars if you can find that one million dollars
