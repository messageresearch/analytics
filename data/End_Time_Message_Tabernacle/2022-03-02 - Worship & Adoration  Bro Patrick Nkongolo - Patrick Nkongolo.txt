========================================

have sunday's uh morning or sunday night and i'll take the other service and he'll have wednesday and i'll have tuesday or something like that or i said we'll go right ahead with the services and i said i'll get a new job and go to work i did i got my job brother woods back there moving houses so i just went to work got me a job it hurt my wife and billy they said billy said dad i'm sure you're doing wrong i said no i'm doing right i keep my promise i told him i said my promise no matter what it is if a man is not as good as his word i don't wanna you can't trust him because he's not no good you know and so um that's one thing and a person must always be that's honest be tell things so that that you can go back and tell it a million times it'll be the same thing you see just be honest no matter if it's bad or whether it's good be honest and if it's against you say it anyhow or keep still don't say it at all and um so then i i feel that way that god will bless an honest heart and knowing the position that i stand in to defeat sickness and stuff for people in prayer to the lord jesus according to his divine uh word and his uh and his calling then i must be honest and hard to do that because the devil knows whether you are or not he won't penalty i don't care how loud you holler how much you make up he won't pay attention to you right but god will if you're on so i said i'll tell them when to get the air zone i actually left california i didn't have the nerve so i had to i said well in new mexico and on and on to i told him something right down here and again well they they understood it pretty well billy didn't get it too well he said daddy i think you're making a mistake but i went home tired weary upset crying went to bed that night and after wife got to sleep i went in the room knelt down said dear jesus i don't know what i'm going to do here i am right back where i started from again i guess i made a failure about two hours the man he appeared to me and he showed me a vision of such a panoramic view of people i've never seen i was talking to my wife in division now you people that know me know i'm not a fanatic i don't say these things unless they're the truth that's right uh i've seen it and i've seen brother oregon by standing there and i went up to him he said brother billy said we'd give out all the prayer cards and everything's ready now for the meeting we got a way of taking in and out i said thank you brother orton wright i walked over to some more brethren and there's another brother preaching i said who's he they said they put him up and i said who's they and they just turned around walked away and the man they just dismissed the audience let them all go and i said oh he shouldn't do that because there is there's no altar call oh he said another fellow spoke up and said we don't tuck up the offering i said when is the offering more important than souls before christ and at that the angel lord taking me out then and he take me to a real bright stream of water the most beautiful blue water and great fish was swimming around then he said i will make you a fisher and he said now cast your lure into the water when you pull it slow first time next time just give it a little jerk up too hard and the next time that you're hooked for the catch and i started promote lying in the water i pulled everybody into rejoicing and that's wonderful that's wonderful i got all excited and jerked it hard on the next move out i pulled a fish and all out of the water and what it was is a little bitty fish in it just about size the lure and i got my line all tangled up and i straightened out the line and the man which was talking behind me walked around in front of me dressing palestinian clothes a turban on his head in a white robe you said brother brandon that's it i said i know i didn't do right i said i jerked it when i ought to he said don't get your lines tangled up in these kind of times and i said well i'm running as straight as i can i'll be very careful and he said now the first time i spoke with you you put your hands on the people and told them what was wrong with them and the second pull while when you did you would know the secrets of your heart and i made you sear before the people but she was always trying to explain it you ought to have done that said you've made a public show out of it i said i'm very sorry and he's taking me from there and i've seen a great huge tent i've never seen such a attempt it was packed in line everywhere with people and i walked out to the look like i was standing above the people looking down where just made an altar call and hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the lord jesus as their failure i looked and then i heard a man get up and say call the prayer line and people began to line up over on this side the left from where i was looking down towards the platform and they're lying all the way up and down the street for a prayer line now notice to my left which have been to my right if i was on the platform a little wooden building and i've seen that light that oh they have a picture of you know it's always in the meeting i've seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building and a voice said to me i'll meet you in there that'll be the third full i said why he said well it won't be a public show like the hell is and i came too and i now at the beginning of this new year back to my tabernacle where it started from and back to the beginning where i started i am very grateful to god for these things and many of you know that just before somewhere in the service that you'll in your heart say yes lord this is the day when i take my make my decision to serve you the rest of my life it's a wonderful day i'm sure over our eyes has been just available even believers who we can't see just what's going on around us you see and many times spiritual lead people are
