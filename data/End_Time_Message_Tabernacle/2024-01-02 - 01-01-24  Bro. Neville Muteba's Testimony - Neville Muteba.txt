========================================

I want to give a testimony about something that happened to me in the month of August uh one day I had my old manager who was black and since he was fired from the job we had a white manager who came in and when he came about two days later it was a Wednesday and that morning he suspended me from work um and since I work for the government they said that we'll send you the paperwork uh from all of the accusations from the [Music] boss and I told myself when it starts like this here in the US that's it and I told myself having another job isn't impossible but it's a whole process uh yeah certain there are other brothers who called me and I told them about that and other brothers told me we would pray about it it was a Wednesday I was so defeated in my In the Flesh and I said that that day I wouldn't be able to come up to the pulpit to interpret and I had brother Neville who had sent me the a message saying that you're going to interpret and I told myself after all the hits I've taken will I really be able to Something Told Me Something told me that you have to go up there might be the devil trying to discourage you but you have to go do God's work I got up here and that day I interpreted and people told me that that day was really good and I said and I said you don't know exactly what I'm going through but it's God that allowed it to be so I I started looking for other jobs after one week I prayed and I asked other brothers to pray with me um and um I was told that there was a meeting and uh with other bosses and I was supposed to be pres of thatting and during that time I didn't really have any access to the government systems and at the meeting they I was surprised they actually said no you can come back to work you have to sign all of the paperwork saying that you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do that I said no problem and well to backtrack I'm the only black person on [Music] the and I noticed some discrimination amongst the team uh seeing some habits that weren't good amongst members of the team and as we were listening to the word I said given the circumstances I have I could only show love towards these people and pray for them and we it went like this to um problem after problem saying that today won't work and tomorrow won't work either and I noticed after a certain while God had taken control of the whole situation and the people that were causing me problems were people that were now supporting me and during that time while I was looking for jobs I did multiple interview that they didn't hire me for and uh after a certain while with all that going on um I figured that that was the will for of God for me the reason why I'm testifying it's just a little experience when you go through diffic difficult moments if you have a work of God to do continue to do it if someone persecutes you love them and you will come out [Music] [Applause] Victorious
