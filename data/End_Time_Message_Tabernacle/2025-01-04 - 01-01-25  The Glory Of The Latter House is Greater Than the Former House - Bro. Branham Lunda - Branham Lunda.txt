giving us for giving us this opportunity to bring forth something for uh the at the beginning of this year I don't want to say names of people but I don't want to take much of the time I the pastor told me to start preaching in English Pastor today you're going to bear with me uh Francis I have to preach in French but uh I wanted just to say uh congratulation for uh the people who has been

the people brother sisters brother Bram says when your pastor come to the P pit and preaching the word of God is an angel for you and you need to believe that that's the only way you will be blessed amen amen when I saw the blessings that Brother Richard pray about about every of us oh my God because my subject today is I wanted to say in French let me go back to French the glory of the later house be greater than the former one amen amen when I saw the anointing in this place I saw I heard the Mighty the powerful prayer of I heard the preaching of the pastor and the blessing that he said to this church brother sir sister let the devil go up let him go down are blessed if you believe it say Amen Let It Be So amen amen I already feel good I will try to be short though I have a lot of things I will try to be short we see here in the scripture we just read Prophet a prophet AI talking he was speaking to zerel it was the time of the building you know God told David not to build the house because it was a bloody man in war he say your son Solomon will build the temple and Solomon buil wonderful Temple and dedicated the temple but it was destroyed when Israel went to captivity in the time of those are the things that you know to save time way I want to score against the devil we see when he was about to rebuild the Temple of Israel had a lot of trouble they had a lot of discouragement and that didn't almost work and sometime that's what happened to us sometime life maybe you have a project a plan it may happen that that fails but says the failures some time it's a part of our success says I I will be with you as I was with Moses he say I would rather have somebody that can make mistake and keep trying that A man that is afraid to tackle the problem amen amen failures is a part of our lives but but we have to learn from our mistakes our blessings our future does not depend of our failures even the future of this church does not depend of his past [Music] [Applause] God knows how he will take this church to Perfection but if we made mistakes we can learn from our mistakes to move forward and Israel there were Samaritan that will come and they will try to discourage the people but after that they took courage and you know when we say the glory of this letter house here we want to talk about when we say Temple we want to see the building as the temple that will be carried away as God gave the the vision to Moses it was a temple temporary Temple there was a temple that Salon built but but there's you and I we are also the temple of God because in do know you not that the Temple of the Holy Ghost should not destroy the temple we are talking about the temp as indidual we are also talking about the temple as the church are you with me then what happened that day the anointing of God he told the priest the glory of the lat house will be greater than the former one the glory it's a manifestation let's go back to see the first Glory former glory then we can understand the letter Glory what will will be let's go to the first Chronicle chronic sorry second Chronicle verse S uh uh 2 Chronicle chapter 7 verse first verse don't sleep on me I'll go quickly uh I can tell it's 3 you know uh at 3 that's a good watch it's between 3 and 5 somewhere there while Jacob was praying was praying seriously as a desperate man God heard his prayer and sent an angel be awake now amen amen the Bible is telling us here uh when now when Solomon had made an end of a praying praying the fire came from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house and the priest could not enter into the house of the Lord I love this because the glory of the Lord had filled the house Lord's House amen amen Solomon after building the Temple he dedicated the temple he consecrated the temple and he made a prayer and after making a prayer God to honor his servants the glory of God the glory of came into the temple when the glory of the Lord enter in the temple the priest which was like a preachers they couldn't do the service hallelujah hallelujah when God comes down it makes the task easy for preach they now are looking for the anointing I like when there's anointing because when there's an anointing you're not trying when the the glory came down the people could notice oh and I'm praying the very same Glory overwhelm this church to the point people will come in their desire that can grant them the desire of their hearts now notice that cloud that came down in the temple while the priest they didn't even have time to say anything it just s blessed Israel can you imagine Jehovah of the Old Testament the creator of Heavens coming down in the temple to confirm to vindicate it was beyond this work hallelujah hallelujah that is why my brother you have to love this pill of Fire or the cloud This Cloud this pill of fire is God himself in some Churches you don't have pictures like this he said he had such a pictures in his church he had it in his office why is God allowing himself to be photographed in this age it didn't start today in the temple of Solomon when the glory filled the house listen the people were happy they were in Joy no remember uh later one day the prophet Jonah find himself in trouble in the belly of the whale he remembered the prayer of Solomon he was there in the belly of the Bo he didn't know where was the South the east and west but he just remembered I remember day when Solomon consecrated the temple he said even if the people far away they were not even Hebrews they in trouble somewhere and they turning toward the temple and they pray may he got answered from [Applause] heaven and Jonah was answered in the belly of the fish to confirm that was a great Glory how come the prophet will say the glory of the letter house will be greater than that one the for this night this year the glory that you had last year the glory that you're going to have this time will be greater amen if that pass Glory the presence of God will make such a way the priest couldn't even enter they even were not able to work and Paul is saying the glory to [Music] come will be greater than the former one amen amen you will notice Israel when they received Jesus Christ That Glory that came down in the temple one day Simon in Temple he could see that Glory but this time it wasn't in the form of the CL but it was in the form of a baby when he could touch the baby the baby was the glory ofina was God made manifest people forgot they did not understand that the god that came down the temple was no longer in the temple it was in the baby Jesus only the elect could understand it that is why Simon said mine eyes have seen the glory let your servant go in peace hallelujah hallelujah when that God died at the cross let me manage the anointing hallelujah hallelujah when Jesus when Jesus died the cross you know in the the Old Testament nobody was baptized in the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was in the New Testament amen amen that is why the glory of the letter will be greater than the for one because then back then was the physical Temple God could come down but now the God that was descending in the church now he will come down in the church that is you he wants to come down in us and when I'm walking it's God walking saying when a Christian has the Holy Spirit he's saying is the deity walking on the earth when he's walking his life will start shouting holy holy of the Lord of hosts why that God will enter in you and the glory this Glory will be greater than the former one hallelujah hallelujah that is why tonight God help us to understand that we are that Temple in this end time which is the temple that will have much Glory we shouldn't be remain kids children the say let work so that this glory to be manifested we have to work I'll go quickly because I could see people getting tired we have to work that's why the Bible saying the Bible say let's work so that this glory be real as the Pastor said what good that will do to us the guy that was better back then if it's not better today will serve us to have a holy spirit that back in the day change people's life they shout they spoke but their life was changed what good Shall Serve to us such a spirit being us that doesn't change our lives amen amen that wouldn't do us any good because the prophet says when Hebrew 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever said it's not the literally body of the Lord the men the men of Galilee no is the same yesterday today forever accept his physical body that means the same yesterday based of his character if it change prostitute back then and it doesn't transform Pro today then it's not the same for him to remain the same the effect of the last one has to manifest himself today that is why tonight if you still sinner God can still give you the Holy Spirit That Glory should be in you hallelujah hallelujah when Jesus died we know that he went up and sent down the Holy Spirit but the holy spirit that came down the day of the Pentecost the day of the Council of it was released by denominational that why the church remained without gift there was no life the only thing remained was religion but there was no more life there was a scripture in Zariah that said about the evening time there shall be light there was still a scripture in Jo 2 that was say will restore that say the Lord everything that the Conqueror the the the the that destroyed my great Army will restore that was scriptures written there and the time in which those scriptures will be this is the time those scriptures should be fulfilled amen amen brother says here in this message the almighty God unveil before us you know I love I love my old way the paper book now we have a electronic uh format which is not wrong but I prefer this one it's better amen amen are you sleeping or I understand you're tired but in this time in this time I think you should be better awake better the end of the things than the beginning thereof is it the truth say glory to [Music] God you have muscles why are you sitting the back day the Mighty God unveil before us he's saying this notice Paul is saying here be transforming to glory to glory you see it's the going back to the original it's the same with the the seed of God the seed of the flower coming down the seed the wheat seed coming down what happened first germ first a little dust and becoming to the the the Poland and is coming back to the original seed that's exactly what the church did amen amen he went from Wesley and now now he's coming back to original sea to the original Glory the beginning the glory of the beginning the sun has risen in the East is the that is manifesting to the West transform changing from glory to glory amen is continuing it's transforming from the the the the Ean [Applause] Glory from Luther to Wesley and from Wesley to the Pentecostal and so forth changing from glory to glory producing the Eden mana and now it's right to bring him back exactly like it was in the beginning Min his same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power amen amen the same Holy Ghost the same that came down the day of Pentecost the same holy ghost that manifested today from glory to glory to glory is back to Original Seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same sign same wonders brother we got to see the same if you don't see the same as the Pastor said we we better stop we we're just going to cast lot yes yeah we if it's the same he has to manifest the same effect we shouldn't keep thinking while we don't see nothing because the glory of the letter house should be greater what he did what he's going to do now has to be greater than what he had done before in the past the same kind of people acting the same way the same power the same sensation it's from Glory unto glory amen the church from Glory onto Glory the same Jesus that is coming in the form of the Holy Spirit coming down in you making you Temple upon which God can see through your eyes touch through your hands God can speak through your mouth God can act through you it's the very same God is saying the next thing will be change from this Glory do you follow this body here it's starting from the inside it's starting from within that Glory that will be greater than the former one we start we won't start he will first get inside of you with the power of the Holy Spirit and the next thing will be the change from this Glory here into a body like his own glorious body his own glorious body we shall see him Abraham saw the same hallelujah hallelujah I love this the word that we hear the Holy Spirit coming down in US is growing within us when you eat the word is growing and the next thing this Glory here will be transformed exactly as it was ab and you will see the resurrected it will not be for too long very soon it will be the departure hallelujah amen that is why in A Moment Like This is the moment to claim the Holy Spirit if you don't have it even though you have it we want the new more new experiences that day I was praying I was saying Lord I know You' have done a lot of miracles in my life I know I've prayed for sick people they were healed I know I cast out evil spirits demons obeyed family found Deliverance

good we can remember them so that can boost our faith are you with us remember those things will boost your faith but that shouldn't be your measure because God sees the present time amen amen because then I say Lord if you are God you did this you did this as the pastor says the testimonies we have a lot of them now right now we want to see you to act right now you the one who say the glory of the the lat one will be greater than the former the same God has to act amen amen we heard about him in this message I heard but now I see saying paragraph 182 in the Bible you heard what he did how the women touch His Garment he turned around and told her why their trouble was and her faith made her War now he promised that he will do the same thing again just before the world will be burned and the world will be in the Sodom Sodom condition says the New Testament the prophets the God's prophets the prophets of the prophets the gods of all the prophets the fullness of the godhead body God manifested In the Flesh the creator of Genesis huj Hallelujah and his word he said it will happen and that's his word we see the world in that condition we see the world in that condition and now we see him come down and do exactly what he said he will do now we've heard of him but now but now we see him they heard of him my brother says in this age we see him and we had if we had seen him now this the glory of the lat to be greater than the for one I want to tell somebody if you believe that's the truth if you believe that God came down in the past it came in the form of Jesus and now in the midst God has destroyed somewhere in the middle power but according to Zarah according to Joel 228 the same God had to come down in this age if you believe it may God grant you the desire of your heart now listen brother the pastor gave some request here the request of people that wanted to get married people that are sick people that that need children oh I'm praying that this year espcially

where we living now when I was reading it I said oh Lord sometime we don't understand we don't realize who we are them people they saw the glory coming in the temple to the point that because of this anointing the preacher couldn't preach no more they wanted to live in the age in which we living right now how much more this Glory we have now oh my brother why you so worried are you sure God for has forsaken you the very present water will do you love William Bram hallelujah hallelujah says the very present water from The Rock he says paragraph 152 you know back in the days when the Holy Ghost came down in the day of Pentecost you know there were Miracles and wonders and Peter was just standing there just his shadow the sick that were passing by they were healed well that glory is nothing more than nothing that why we have right now now brother is telling us when you receive [Music] salvation God is giving you Faith to elevate you above the fness of this world Amen before continuing let me stop here when God gives you salvation God gives you Faith to raise you above the mark of this Earth above sin I just have a question now while I'm reading this you said you are saved right how come until this time You' never been above sin that's what prophet says that means you don't rule over sin when God is giving you salvation he gives you Faith to rise from The Mark of the earth just check your salvation are you with the prophet just check your salvation this is not a time to impersonate Christianity because the prophet says exposition of seven churches brother says there's two Vine one Vine from the Devil the wicked one and the vine of God it started from Genesis and that went through all the Bible and now it's ending and the B says at the end it will reach maturity and when it will reach maturity every seed will show forth his color with this maturity if you are trying toate to be a Christian or you trying to impersonate to be a Christian don't worry that will be manifested don't try to impersonate just be born as Christian amen amen when you receive salvation God gives you God gives you Faith to raise you from The Mark of the earth and then I have to ask myself a question now I'm always here watching porn I'm always there trying to have bad friends now I even becoming gay I call myself I still call myself Christian I have to continue asking myself the question do I have salvation or not based on what the prophet says are you with me Church if you don't have it tonight if you decide says what hinders people to receive the Holy Ghost it's because they don't want it if you truly want it even while we still speaking about where you are you can receive it amen amen he's able to change you he can give you Faith to rise you above and your understanding will be clear now let me continue your faith overcomes the things of the world once you receive salvation I don't know why the Holy Ghost is coming back to this when you are saved God gives you Faith rise you above the mark of the earth and your faith overcomes the things of the world you you're not forcing it if you're trying to by yourself you won't get it but when you receive salvation gives you that Faith amen amen amen what is your faith then your faith is that act that God has did in you to make you a Son of God you quit your lying you quit your steal you quit your drinking because your faith R you above say Amen to it am amen because this Glory here you know say we living in the last age there won't be any other age and if there was another generation we shouldn't we won't write who's going to write it okay thank you excuse if you don't do it you don't have faith it's by faith that you Sav and through Grace as much as your faith will be relased [Music] that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power in you dwells the power to create Earth in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth God dwells in you and you are Sons and Daughters of God say Amen there you are oh Church listen this but it's your faith you see Jesus said according to your faith be it unto you all things are possible I say unto you if you say unto

Calvary the every presence of the Living God great flowing that goes with us in our journey oh says you can make heavens and earth he says it's just because it's controlled by a law imagine brother John creating his own world whether C goes to create his own world everybody's created his own world then God made a law and let me close with this anyway uh says let me jump a few things you see what I mean the power in you will produce you can create the World by your own words and live withj Hallelujah that's the power in the church in this time not tomorrow right now speak that power is in you

[Music] [Applause] yours the church if you can just believe it whatever your heart lead you to believe it's already yours hallelujah hallelujah it's already yours it's your property you just have to find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean that power is controlled if you Son of God and daughter of God this time let me close by this if you're son and daughter of
