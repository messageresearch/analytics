himself to speak to us in this age that is why we don't have anything to look afterwards when we come we come with what God already said on Sunday it's always a big fight the newcomers they come I don't know where they come from they bring spirits and you know a lot of messed up and now on the weekend on the weekdays but he said I'll still go to church that's why it's always been a blessing Pastor I want to thank the pastor who said opportunity for this opportunity I know it's been three days it wasn't difficult I was leaving the airport and today we traveled his house to Heap this place we really traveled we came here to worship Our God represents I want to thank you all for your presence the Bible says wait two or three by events not 20 not 30. we are here as a proof Excellence the preacher by Excellence do you remember God himself of God the Apocalypse in Revelation chapter 12. first verse and glass in parisiel in usually is [Music] okay and they appear great wonders in heaven a woman clothed with sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars and she she being with the child cry traveling in birth and pains to be delivered City England foreign [Music] foreign and she brought and they appear another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and he still drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did catch them to the to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to for to devour her a son as soon as it was born okay and I'm fantastic universe and she broke forth a man child who was to rule all nations with Road of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne and the woman fled into a Wilderness where she had a place prepared of God that they should feed her their 1203 school days okay may not treasure now 13. and when the dragons saw that he was cast unto the Earth he persecuted the woman which was which brought forth the child The Man Child and to the women who were given two wings and great Eagles that she might fly into the Wilderness into the place where she was nourish for a time and the time and a half a time for their face uh from the face of the serpent foreign which the Dragon cast out of his mouth foreign the dragon was worth a rough with the woman and went to to make war with the women of this the seed which kept the Commandment of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ of heavy things the first and the last years you're the Genesis [Music] foreign amen you may be serious may God bless you all right this message God has given us God sent it to in English God didn't send it to a group of people this message came to you alone that is why when you came you never hear the question we are preaching do not turn around look for yourself and the time to preach pleasing people it's over today foreign uh may not generous now God has brought us all to a level two snooze we don't have this message but what I've understood the message came for the individual for you alone for me so everybody it's the grace of God that's why today I'm going to preach about the Grace by Grace they preach about it tomorrow you're out there today you're wondering around when I'm saying you didn't get it you didn't get it someone who's drunk in the Michigan Lake he says and you see somebody coming in the water they just lift you up and save you wow and tomorrow morning you come back are you gonna do that they just took you out of here you didn't get it Revelation so to move forward further myself preach the essentials when we talk about this woman the prophet Palace the prophet is speaking the Jews woman the prophet balance the perfect about the bride the same scripture if he speaks about the bride is saying that the seventh the 12. it's a 12 uh teaching of Apostles okay go slowly I'm going to add another scripture the Bible says mark 16. purpose America 16 1-2 um foreign and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Jesus or James and Salome had brought sweet spices and they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the Super Crew and the rising of the sun and the rising of the Sun is saying this message and the messenger that assembly God is on fire it seems like they are uh Fallen for Sunday the end time eventually yes we just started you see the purpose of this message we're not coming here to see each other take us to the rapture perfect what can he do according to Malachi 4. [Music] in foreign [Music] I bypass the rest of these scriptures about them maybe sometime uh I can get to them but I want to say this we believe we're at the end time we believe it at the end time okay right and though it seems that at the end at this time this time this time right here broke it sounds like a Saturday looks like Satan has tried his best to rim replica bread of Neville in his accident brother Chris there is something let's see he looks like that man and right now shark against the battle when every church out there manifests at this they stand down they disapprove about it especially here in America a lot of people that preachers the people that we honors back then Congo the doctor we call them doctors they forsoot this message the secret about this message you will not work like that if you come with your brain to have a party if you come with your heart [Applause] don't come with your brain send a genius [Applause] understand this primary charge but if you come if you're pregnant you just keep on correcting a good English you see you should have said this go ahead oh my God shows this is the thing it is you see assembly of death this seems to be a broke it is it looks like we are defeated don't you worry don't you worry it's a devil you know said that says it's usually at that time when God steps of something has been watching for a long time you remember it remember it foreign [Music] it's always in them weakness when it looks like a tree it's about defeated that's when God steps in he left the search he lets the message and the messenger get to the inside then he comes in he lives rides on the hide waves that's right the message you see this message will never be a denomination we can change the message but the message will remain the same time now as I said I'm speaking about the questions you see I'm talking about this way comparing to the bread of Jesus woman represent uses represent all of us we are in the world and filled with the Holy Ghost [Music] it was the Sun under her feet 100 feet to see slowly the preaching paragraph 28 okay the woman was representing the church are you with me La Familia president the women represented the church and the child that she brought forth was Christ us you see the law hey surrounded by the Sun [Applause] he's the only one who gives you that faith he's giving me the faith to believe it was just like apology listen to what Paul says here Ephesians Ephesians chapter 2. before you're moving forward in Ephesians chapter 2 we are here who is rich in Mercy for his great love where we've he loved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with Christopher by Grace he has saved Jesus Christ through faith that's not of yourself it is the gift of God you cannot deserve everybody they give you a gift you already have the things it's God who's seeking after us for we are his workmanship yes created in Christ Jesus and to Good Works which God has before ordained that we should work even good words [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that is not there [Music] oh god let's go back where we were last time representative the woman was representing the
