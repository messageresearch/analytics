calisthenics may the lord bless you jerusalem in the name of lord jesus christ mercy opportunity thank you for the opportunity to be alive again tonight may the glory and honor goes to our lord merciful thank you thanks again to our beloved pastor uh for always to have that coaching spirit letter to give us repeat what brother brenham said this message uh and the eyes were open and they recognized them amen just to help us tonight to carry on the journey benediction i believe it's going to be a blessing for everyone because brother burnham said it just depends of your attitude the bible says everything is possible to god and to the one that believes yes and i always cut it simple i always say possibly everything is possible to you if you believe because god has already done everything we make the promise of god to be fulfilled for you amen amen therefore tonight we're here we want god to speak to us a little bit uh certainly when the pastor asked me to say something disabled people married [Music] no he's no longer here that fellow looked like a man but he was a heavily heavenly angel he told them like the master is known yeah he's already risen and the woman left the tomb they went to this the disciples hey elizabeth and they told the disciples our he went all the way to the tomb and you see really the thing was real amen amen peter was among the the elders with experience he some people that spend a lot of time in the lord not with a bad testimony by the people that you know that they have the holy ghost they live correct it's true god can use us unprecedented the experience that for people that uh before us we need to respect that amen amen this is the law of god that's the only way to be blessed we don't want to see someone who just started and then you say wow elisha that was talking about that typified the church accepted the coaching of the elder cellar developer he had to take 10 years so that they are known because they are known from one person to another you can only give what you have the anointing that was upon elijah went to elisha [Applause] if elisha said ah no no no don't i have my guess gift that's a complaint to complete each other a gift to coach another gift says always been like that you're gonna take moses [Applause] i don't know why i'm talking about this survived i i believe that will have something joshua was the moses servant why moses has to be moses servant joseph servant listen he doesn't do nothing for no reason we found out later on yeah god looked he did not he said no i found take joshua because he was always on your side he was subjected to what you were doing this is why joshua is [Applause] because the soldiers romans soldiers actually they were there to keep the the tomb they had the courage to go and he saw that he wasn't there and then he could come back and tell the people it's true that it is risen amen amen and people with discrimination since people were discouraged allah said you ship a prophet the message lfc and the eyes were opened and they knew him i want to read something before carry on something that can help us paragraph paragraph six six second message pressure it's a message preached eventually afraid april 21 1990 of i want to read the paragraph third something that brother venom is saying everything that jesus promised and it's the word of god if he said get down the the world that we see a super connected spiritually they are not spiritually connected let's just spiritual the spiritual eyes the perfect pathways they cannot see jesus there are people that are born in the world [Applause] [Applause] [Music] and i believe we are people that didn't make a choice to be condemned but for those who would come and hear the words just park in this building you never come just to be seen amen amen i didn't care i didn't come here just to listen i also believe you didn't come to be seen but i'm continuing on in my own eyes sensei you've come with a sincerity of your heart a pleasant team i think it was a walk with god okay these are men let somebody say amen this is why you live away from here personally a better person than you was when you came in [Applause] it's always been my prayer before going to church lord speak to me amen amen basket because [Music] it's always when we're waiting on him and we will see a manifesto that's when it appears to us amen amen from what i'm continuing with amen amen on sunday it happened that they were a great anointing and something came to me [Applause] i'm telling you it was terrible it was tremendous from you know brother branham said benny visit every time one god visits you or blesses you i pray be careful the devil will try to snatch out the blessing they please in so many ways he will do it that's why tonight i want to raise the faith in your life and very so often compared to if it goes somewhere else you say why [Applause] [Applause] is all your problem has to disappear but never decides brother branham said to bring there's much result se per second it's because legends people are used to avec le pastel of brenham tabernacle and tonight i want us to understand may god help us to understand this listen brother branham i don't know why i'm getting away from my message [Music] he was sitting with poor people he was working with me even when he was talking he was using just uh popular language he wasn't foreign to send jesus upon the cross yeah foreign see as he was it wasn't a man a great man that's the reason why the government i was wearing the bible says they rented my clothes this is how the bible says it was a matter of foreign and i want you to know this because if you guys play uh the pleasure yeah you guys play that game that people use to cast a lot on jesus garment certainly creating a paper this is a game that the christians shouldn't play amen amen they create a paper of what these shows come the christians shouldn't have things that yes and your renters my before there is resurrection angel one day across the city simplicity because of this simplicity as your philippe avocados when they feel bleak when philly believes he came to the meeting we receive the message since i've always sent it if we have the holy ghost the scientist the holy ghost in us give us courage to speak to someone else let's start the spirit the holy ghost give us courage yes servants say look here down there receive somebody's mistake amen amen men messing with some directly even if you're in the church people can come in the church [Applause] spending years in the church but they can still let's sentence privileges the holy ghost will inspire you and yeah the good way you redeem the process circus jesus this is how jesus wanted to do donaire to give you the holy ghost in your tongue give the holy ghost to somebody else i'm saying it's like a philly perfect this is why philip did when he heard the message we're waiting for what is that it's jesus of nazareth he said what another question is something good can come out of nazareth philip told him come and see him don't stay focused [Applause] let's just carefully the things that you have done you can be surprised exactly can you use the example it's not him it's the holy ghost they cannot visit [Applause] i become the disciple of jesus amen amen elephant and the woman in the world the
