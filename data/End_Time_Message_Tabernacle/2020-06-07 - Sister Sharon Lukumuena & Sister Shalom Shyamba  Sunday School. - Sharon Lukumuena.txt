about last Sunday we had a few issues and we weren't able to come together and film for the lesson but we got you this Sunday alright so we're just gonna start off with the word prayer and then we're gonna jump into our lesson all right at their Heavenly Father God we thank you again for another day you know the opportunity that you gave to us of God to live for your garden to display our lives for you O Father God we commit this morning into your hands if other cutters will be teaching their children today or maybe they get something out of the Sunday School lesson that they'd be able to apply to their heart so father God we thank you for everything committing all things into your hands and Jesus name we pray amen okay so I think you guys had a good two weeks break or a week break from us and I gave you guys some homework to do wasn't long but I just gave you second Kings chapter 20 and I also gave you in class 6 chapter 3 verses 1 - I believe it was 8 8 and I told you guys like after reading it I wanted you guys to figure out what exactly were these scriptures talking about but today my lesson what I'm gonna get out of these scriptures is about time okay so in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 it was talking about a time right so everything there's a season there is a time there was a purpose for everything there's a time to be born there's a time to die there's a time to be happy there's a time to be sad there's a time to weep there's a time to dance there's a time to you know there's a time for everything you know and it's not just like for example during this time everybody's trying to stay at home and be safe you know it's not attempt to always be going out you know being in contact with a lot of people right but before that that was the time to do it for example when you school time right you want to go outside and play right but it's not exactly the time to be outside and playing right because you need to be in school you need to be studying and that's the same thing that God gave God gave to us God gave to us that time for everybody everybody in this world we all have 24 hours in a day nobody has 25 and then another one it has like 23 know everybody has 24 hours in the day so everybody has an equal opportunity and equal chance to live their whole day the whole life for God right so now the story that I made you guys read was in 2nd Kings chapter 20 and it's a story about a king his name is Hezekiah and if you start from the beginning Hezekiah was actually I'm thinking he was not a bad King he was a good king but Hezekiah got sick and and getting sick the prophet Isaiah came to Hezekiah and started to warn him and told him hey look you're gonna die make sure that you got your life in order you got your life straight your family in order make all the wrong things that you did go make it right you have to go ask for forgiveness go ask for forgiveness right and Hezekiah heard this and he was so shocked and he said how can this be how can this happen I can't die now and for is that for a lot of time a lot of times for us right we leave our whole lives we think we're going to live forever and ever and ever and we live any way we want to right you know a lot of people think oh well we'll take care of tomorrow you know I don't really think I need to serve God no you know I'm young I can do whatever I want I don't have to really be consecrating in my life oh you know surrender my life to God you know I'll do it when I'm a little bit older but no one is guaranteed that they will have tomorrow right so this in this in this case as a guy was actually pretty lucky to have the prophet Isaiah come to him and tell him hey you're gonna die soon so make sure you have your life straight make sure you let you have your life in order well Isaiah left the palace after telling Hezekiah Hezekiah was really really sick so Isaiah left the palace and Hezekiah after hearing this says that he targets basedgod and he started to pray and he said let's my numbers okay he said I beseech thee O Lord remember now I have walked before the in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and has a Kyle web source so basically Hezekiah was saying God why am i dying now I've done I've lived my best life before you I've done what is right I walk before you I have obeyed your commandment I've done everything I'm supposed to do and that's how we're supposed to live right as Christians every day whether whether the good times were during the bad times whether we know we have you know 10 years ahead of us or whether we know that we can die tomorrow something that can happen to us tomorrow right we always want to be living right and doing what's right do it but what please God it came to pass well has it kind just started to pray and you can see that Hezekiah was very honest in his heart you know he said God he can just more years in my life I promise I'm gonna leave it even better right because he knows that if he if he dies now he won't be able to do the things maybe that he planned to do the things he wanted to do right so he started to pray to God earnestly with the heart and you know what God heard his prayer got hurt in prayer and then Isaiah as he was on his way up but I told I hear go back go back and tell Hezekiah that no I'm gonna let him live after three days he's gonna feel better he's gonna feel better and what am I gonna do i'm gonna add 15 years to his life he said i'm gonna deliver him from all his enemies I will protect Israel I'm gonna defend them and he learned to give him all these promises as you read I believe in verse 6 he said okay go back go back and tell Hezekiah so as a guy he's laying there and he's prayed to god earnestly and fervently you see how important prayer is because maybe God maybe God had some certain plan for you maybe something was gonna happen but your prayers can change situations that's why we always say the phrase no prayer changes things because how does it kind of not prayer maybe he would have died just instantly but he prayed to God earnestly and as a and as Isaiah came back and told him all right this is what the Lord told you he's gonna give you an extra 15 years to live now Hezekiah was lucky because God was ready to take him home but no because of hearing the prayer God gave him an extra 15 years okay he said I'm gonna protect who I'm gonna defend you I'm gonna deliver you from the king of Assyria and I'm gonna defend you cuz I'm gonna defend the city for my own sake right and then he said okay and then Isaiah told has a kind of a take a lump of figs just some herb some leads because Isaac I had a boil in verse seven he says and he says take a lump of figs and they took it and laid it on the boil and he recovered so basically whatever whatever a ball he had that was causing him to be sick Isaiah said just take some fig just take some believe some little herbs and put it on the bowl and after three days he's gonna get deep in it he's gonna recover and then Hezekiah said in verse eight what sign is the Lord gonna give to me that he's gonna show me that I'm healed and then he and then Isaiah said in verse nine this sign shall have this sign shall bow have of the Lord and the Lord will do a thing that he had spoken and shall the shadow go forward 10 degrees or go back 10 degrees so back in the days you know how now we have quacks or we have little watches on earth on a race that we can see no right now it's maybe 10 it's like 9:30 9:45 so but back then they didn't have that type of technology to know the time so what they used to do they used to watch the shadow of the Sun they would like put like a sundial like a like a piece of paper in there have just maybe like a little stick right in the middle and when the Sun would be on that little stick it would give a shadow so that they would know kind of at what time they were maybe they were in the morning afternoon or evening so they would know and Hezekiah said well for me to know that the lord is going to heal me and I'm gonna get better and I'm gonna have this 15 years of more life to myself I want that shadow to go backwards so basically he's saying I want the clock to go backwards now can you imagine they're not using technology they're not using you know the little digital watches that we had that uses the battery that can go backwards no in order for the bat little sundial to go backwards the Sun would have to go so that was a big miracle in itself can you imagine just in the middle of the day in the middle of the day all of a sudden the Sun just starts going backwards like this sundial the time on their little like men hand me like little if I should say clocks that they have start to go backwards that was a sign that God was really in his life and that God said that he was going to hear him so then when they saw that the that the sundial went backwards then they believed then they knew Oh God is really gonna heal us right so no after the third day Hezekiah gets better right and he's all fine he's got an extra 15 years right and if you were in Hezekiah shoes and you know that God added more time to your life what would you do right you think man I would serve the Lord I would do all the things I wouldn't witness I was tell people about God I'll tell people about Jesus I would live my best life right so that's what we're gonna think that Hezekiah well let's move on okay and in verse 12 they said at that time there was a king of Babylon that sent letters and presents to Hezekiah for he had heard that Hezekiah was sick so the king of Babylon I remember the king of Babylon those people they were enemies to the people of Israel well that king when he heard that Hezekiah had was sick and he was gonna die they sent him letters and presents you know just you know to be all man we're sorry that you're sick right so he saw all the presents and stuff and you said hey guess what guys come come come come come come come well you think that one has a kind when he tells all these people from the from Babylon to come over maybe he's gonna witness to them maybe he's gonna tell them oh this is what God is that when I was sick and then he gave me an extra 15 years of life and God is so good well let's move on alright verse 13 and Hezekiah hearkened unto them and showed them the house of his precious things the silver the gold the spices the precious ointment or the house of armor all that was found in his treasure there was nothing in his house nor and all his Dominion that Hezekiah showed them not oh so that's what Hezekiah decided to do instead of witnessing to them and telling them about the true God that healed him that did all these miraculous things for him about the Sun and the shadows going backwards about healing him giving him extra extra 15 years of life no he becomes proud right he says come look at all my treasures so he shows them all his gold sober off his spices everything that he has basically he exposes his own country to the enemies basically you're not really supposed to do that right you have an enemy you wouldn't really show them everything all your plans all your riches all your gold but if you look at Hezekiah as I kind of had become a little powerful he wanted to show them all his riches how good he was how great he would went in forgetting that who was the one that gave him all those riches who was the one that gave him all those spices and all those joint 'men sand all those armors and his big armies and his soldiers who was the one that gave it to him right it was the Lord and the Bible says that there was nothing that Hezekiah did not show to the to the people of Babylon well after doing that Isaiah came back to King Hezekiah and said hey who are these men and where did they come from what what are they doing here and Hezekiah you know what he said oh these are just people from a far far faraway land there from there from Babylon you know I was just showing them around you know giving them a little tour of my Palace and all the things that I had right and I say it was very very very disappointing and you know what he said you have shown them all of this all of this you have shown to them you can't even you know praise God or testify to God about the good things I had done and as I said in verse 16 and Isaiah said to Hezekiah hear the word of the Lord behold the days come that all that is in mine house and that which thy father has laid up in store unto the they shall be carried into Babylon nothing shall be let say the Lord verse 18 and of thy sons thou shalt issue from thee which thou shalt beget which which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be Enix before the palace of the king of Babylon so basically Isaiah's telling them you see all these treasures all these things that you're showing to the to your enemies one day they're gonna come they're gonna take it away they're gonna take your sons gonna kick your daughters they're gonna take your people they're gonna take them and they're gonna make them their slaves live for God and showed him and live the way way that he promised God a beginning when he prayed I told God I'm gonna live for you I'm gonna do what's right all these things would not happen you see how his testimony just went down after God I gave him the desire now for us we don't know exactly what time God is going to take us away from this earth or whenever what time the rapture is gonna happen right we don't want to wait until the very last minute until we see oh how erections gonna happen oh maybe you guys taking you like oh I'm gonna die I need to make my life right no now is the time to live right right now was the time to do what is right whatever God tells you to do you want to do it you don't want to wait until you come into a situation until you feel like there's no hope and the only place you can run to is God you should have God all the way you know how we said put God first every time every day in your life not waiting a two-year go not wait until you're an older person then you're gonna say oh I'm gonna live for God then because you're never promised tomorrow you don't know when your is gonna be the time for you to go or when the rapture is gonna happen that's why at this time it's always good to pray and always good to surrender your life and to put your hope in Christ so like I we were talking in it please yes if there's a time to everything that's tempting a time to plant and a time to harvest right now as you guys are little you guys are young now is the best time because now you guys have the time on your hands when you guys get older you're gonna have work you might have a family you're gonna be busy but now is the time to live your life for God while you have the energy to serve God and to give your very very best don't give him your worst don't give him your you know the like right in the middle you know but give your very very best because I say most important because when God's gonna see it when he's gonna when your time is up he's gonna look at your life and you want to have that testimony said God I gave everything team I did my best for you right so basically that's the story of pace okay and I think Sharon had also something else today Thank You Shalom I hope you enjoyed that lesson I'm just gonna add a few points on to what Shalom said so we Shalom was telling us about time and we see the look of a quick eye cream yes he's talking to us about time there's a time for everything and even at our young age you still have time you know we can have the time to eat to play time to do homework but always remember that we have to have time for God and how much time also are we giving to God are we giving to God two minutes and then we give 5 hours to other things or how are we balance in that time we should give to God just as much time as everything else as something that's important to us because we can't spend our day let's say I spend five hours on my iPad playing games and then I'm like oh wait I need to give time for God so I'm going to open my Bible walk lake and I say let me read something so God knows God so loved the world done father god bless this day in it okay I gave time to God do you think that's really giving time to got enough time to God and giving God giving God that and importance in our life do you think God would look and be like oh yes this is my child he or she would spending time with me no because you're not blue prioritizing what you know given God his time so God loves to hear and you know when we pray for him when we spend time with him and that's why we should always give in that time to prayer and enough time to God enough time reading the Bible enough time you know studying the word memorizing even Bible verses because this is the Word of God which is our sword and also looking in the book of in the book of second Kings of the story of Hezekiah we don't know how much time we have on earth and the Bible tells us you know serve God in you so while we're still young this is the best time that we should say I want to give God my best and just like Hezekiah you know how Zac I was looking to know he had 15 years up or he feels about today but we don't know what can happen at Shalom said we don't know if the records gonna happen tomorrow but I was creating to just know that we have to always walk purely before God and we always have to you know if we make mistakes we always have to get ready to be ready to repent and ask for forgiveness for that and to make sure we're always ready because we don't know what can happen brother Branham says is he talks about prayer and he says prayer is the most powerful weapon that God has given to human beings so player is stronger than any he says any atomic bomb so we see like maybe and maybe in pictures and videos about war videos where we see like the bomb blows up in and ruin the whole area she said that prayer is stronger than any bomb she said that prayer can even change the mind of God and that's what happens here see God was about to so so that Hezekiah died but just because he prayed that's why God changed his mind he added 50 millions - hi Brooke hi his life so we know that prayer is just not a thing that was a god I just pray and whisper key words and hey let's prayer prayer is actually the most powerful thing that we ever have so that's what we want you to always be praying because there's many things ahead of us we don't know it can happen small but just because of our prayer God can spare us maybe we're gonna go out tomorrow a car accident was gonna happen but just because you prayed God hears our prayers and in teaching it can change his mind we also know that when you pray God sees our intentions right so we have to pray with the right intentions what are we praying for example excuse me what are we praying for well we are we are we always praying for us I don't think God bless me give me the best ipad with me the best iPhone give me bestest I can show off to my friends and when we pray for stuff like that you know that God these are intentions even if we don't say it openly but he sees our hearts and he sees what we're thinking so we're praying like that do you think God is really gonna be like oh yeah when he answered because we never know you know so God answers prayers where the random says God answers pray and if he doesn't give us what we asked for he's going to tell us why and he's gonna tell us you know the thing that you're asking for it's not the right time I mean she's gonna tell us the other thing that you you're asking for it it's not gonna help you out in life so God always gives us the answer when we pray even if it's a note it's still an answer from God and just learn how to accept it how do we pray do you just pray like I'm just gonna lay on my bed and you know I'm gonna lean back and just pray and to say I can't wait no you know when we pray we can also get on their knees and maybe show God that we're really surrendering to him and we live in talking to him and we're really humbling ourselves before him and we're really sincere so that's how we pray brother Branham when he was a little boy he didn't know how to pray so I know many of you know the story where he just wrote down the ABC then he pinned it on a tree and he said well God make up make up a prayer from all these words that I'm the alphabet I'm putting this paper even if we don't know how to pray the Bible teaches us how to pray I know that many of you already know the Lord's Prayer but sometimes go back over and just read over and kind of like me what does it mean because we started praying on our Father which I which art in heaven hallowed be thy name hallelujah music raised in the middle Lord and you know I will be done and all over that just go read over it and you'll see that's the structure that God teaches about him teaching us how to pray so we need alone how to pray when we know what we're praying for you to always stay in prayer and yeah that's all kind of I have to add the election said I hope you guys are still paying attention I know it was kind of long today but yeah hoping you guys enjoyed that lesson you receive something out of it yes we're just going to go ahead and close with a word of Prayer our pressure Heavenly Father we do thank you for another opportunity this morning to just come around and hear from to hear from you too but we read your word and to hear more from you Lord we pray that this little lesson that we heard in the Bible that we were to really become a reality in our lives so it may not only be just a Bible story that we're reading or button that we may also tie it to our lines and to learn how to number ID and to live our days when I use for your God power stored in our little capacity when I cannot be a big and natural old enough to do anything big for you but your purpose to serve you in the little ways possible I pray for each and every one of the sunday school students regarding their families that you may protect them that you may bless them that you may keep them safe in their homes and that you may watch over them we ask for your blessing Lord we ask for your blessings upon this week and that you may be with us and all that we do in Jesus Christ when we pray to amen all righty all right guys today you guys next Monday was a pleasure talking to you again steak same thing today good and God bless well
