Ephesus he says this luckily is given me of the law whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is most scriptural one it's a tunicles is the scriptural key is in fact it might be the it might be called the Keystone of the Bible the Keystone it's like the whole Bible is based upon that key a sequestered clay what is the key salary it's the Revelation that God never changes and that is ways are as unchangeable at least the whole Bible based upon that Foundation God never changes ways of doing things doesn't change gives true scripture according to that says in Hebrew 13 8 it says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the second scripture says upon this scripture that I will speak on say Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes against 14 to 15. I know [Music] it shall be forever somebody can say amen I know that what's however God does it is nothing can be put on put put to it foreign will be forever hey the prophet deal done the massage and the prophecy in the message plus the gifts of God always find this place paragraphs are 57 there is nothing [Music] there's nothing that men can hainulate it okay [Music] there's nothing that a man can annihilate means just to bring to nothing is [Music] you cannot do anything to destroy whatsoever you can take a piece of paper invade the puppy a piece a piece of paper an umbrella completely to burn it down completely you can burn down the whole building and sand all together but you might you might burn it down but you didn't identity I'm supposed to see I don't know if we we promise you

he could live in eternity as God say most of the work of us that piece of paper that you burned scaffolds what you saw as a smoke says [Applause] That's What Becomes of the wood because you put the fire in past Gene form and you know it just changed from what form to another word [Music] it is if we could live longer [Music] [Music] [Music] understand why the prophet says any of it foreign [Music] somewhere [Music] you cannot I need something because it's a spoken word of God Amen amenities What God Says forever that's all God does you will endure forever he can go past the ages he can go past years [Music] [Music] the sun is moving according to the love even though this is foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everything that God does God alone December 63 foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] about the continuity of the law of the nature La continuity the continuity of the word La continuity the continuity of the god action foreign [Music] but when they cut the flower the flower grows again sitting continuity de la vie it's a continuity of the life he noticed that is when a man dies in Nepali is normal we don't see him that is why I started complaining God gave him the vision of the Redeemer is your body that is when job said just say I know amen even though my flesh is destroyed by mine eyes [Music] it's the law of the continuity foreign [Music] will be forever
