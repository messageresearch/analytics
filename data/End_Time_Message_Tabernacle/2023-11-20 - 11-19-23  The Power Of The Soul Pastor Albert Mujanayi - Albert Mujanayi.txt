Walter going to East Coast to spend Thanksgiving with the family over there [Music] yeah and the rest of us let us spend time together in the past event like this uh I usually write everybody's name and put it in the pocket and everybody randomly has to take a paper and the paper you will take uh bring some something to the person you have selected the name and uh I've noticed this way people will also have their mind open this way when I take a paper I don't know the person then I will try to force myself to know that person and when you will stand in front of everybody you have to say something good about that person uh this is this time is too late uh but God willing we will plan on maybe another opportunity another opportunity and another thing I did in the past in the time of Fellowship I think last time I put $100 asking for anyone who can know the name of each person including the children we will see people getting uh skipping one two 3 four five people you don't [Music] know it's not good think about your family even a child today you have the privilege to know Peter but there are so many other kids even the newborn they have names imagine Christ doesn't know

sins ha quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and has raised up together and made us SE together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus let's pray our god father you are the god that has

name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be [Music] seated I wanted to thank you I spoke to our pastor since I was at home telling him you are my family and I I will come for my uh daughter's wedding Glory and them that I had the opportunity to come they were free to come join us I saw our pastor coming along with some families we were comforted myself and my children mer I really want to say thank you to you truly God has given us a great family in Christ I want to say thank you particularly to the pastor to the trust that he always G me to speak in instead the approach I'm not worthy I say to myself it's just the grace of God we only counting on God because came to his presence Pastor he pay the ticket for me so I can come he's feeding me accommodated me my man cooking for me burning his fingers for me I'm truly uh grateful I want to admit I'm not really a preacher I'm only counting on the grace of God I believe we all under expect under expectation to see what God want us to do to see I'm going to renew the invitation just have the courage to come back to the Village we are working there at the village where there's a space for everybody if the Lord can grant me his grace I would like to speak about the power of a soul the prophet is telling us something in the message what do you think of Christ is saying this paragraph 22 the weakness of the church today the fundamental reason that we see no more going on of the church in the church one of the fundamental reason that we see no more going on in the church or no more progress in the church the first thing that I think [Music] of first uh the thing of because there's not enough trouble of Soul first uh there's not enough travel of so to bring the person in contact with his maker uh I know you also know it God has not give [Music] us God has not give us this body or this senses of this body to contact God the senses of the body that we have is to contact the world because what we see is to contact the world but it's not to contact God but the thing by which we have to contact God it's by our [Music] soul because God dwells in The Souls of the person don't s because it was the soul that was made make after the image of God by this body no not this body bear with me this body is made after the image of a beast of animal say God the hands like a monkey the the the F the feet like [Music] a but it's the soul that was created after the image of the [Music] Creator but says fundamental one of the fundamental reason that we see no more going on of the church is that there's no enough trouble of s to bring the person in contact with his maker bear with me we can see by our lips but those by those things we cannot counter God it's just a [Music] formality but to contact God you need the traveling of a [Music] soul you need to lift up our souls to the dimension where he can contact our maker our creator and the prophet as our messenger just uh admitted that there was no more a traveling of a [Music] soul another thing is the person that is contact with God who does find God doesn't realize who is God no k j a who is God who God is I [Music] just the person that find God doesn't realize who God is after those are the two reason that we see there's no more going on or progressing in the Church Say Say Say [Music] that's why these last days I've been thinking about the [Music] soul I said to myself I'll try if God helps to speak about the power of a soul uh [Music] how many knows that the prophet say you you have never seen me that's good says youve never seen me I've never seen you I see the body the carcass in which you are living in you are not that car you are not that body the true you the true me it's hidden behind this Veil [Music] we are all human being we have NOS but we don't act the same way even the true twin they don't get they don't look to when it comes to the actions even though they can look alike but everyone has a soul you will act just based on the the state or the condition of your soul [Music] mean it's that very soul that has to contact the creator it'll be hard to break it apart the whole picture in one uh service but I will just speak a little bit this is how I'm inspired this [Music] morning just go back to the book that we just read in Ephesian Paul is speaking here we know Paul had the grace to go until the third [Music] heaven you heard the words that was not given to a man to be HED or to be [Music] heard Paul even said if an angel comes to say something against what we have spoke to you let it be uh cursed he was convinced that he was speaking of the Lord [Music] but we know Paul was a messenger in the right hand of God Paul is saying but [Music] God who rich in Mercy for his great love where with he had loved us even when we were dead in [Music] sins has quickened us be careful with Christ even when we're dead God who is rich in Mercy has Quicken us together with Christ it's by grace and then he's saying [Music] this God has raised up us together together with who are you there he has raised us up together with Christ that means us and Christ we get together in Resurrection in other words Christ was not resurrected alone I was resurrected with him he has raised us up together and made us seat together meaning with Christ in Heavenly places how many believe is the truth we were dead in our sins God God has raised us up together with Christ he has raised us up together now my beloved brothers and sisters just have your courage now I believe the mother has 82 years she's 82 something like that I I don't think uh nobody here right here has 100 years old now I'm asking you a question there's nobody here who were living in his flesh when Jesus was here on the Earth are you right are we how are we going to understand this scripture that we were raised up us together with Jesus what what's the me because we're not even there the pastor year is my big brother but he he was not there he was not there his mother was not even born yet even the mother she was not even there how can how can we easily accept that we were raised to up together with Christ who's saying this man that went out together to the third heaven a man that has high Revelation the man that says if you preach something against what I preach let because is it a lie that's my question if Paul lied to us we we easily accept that we were there we rose up together with Christ who were there I want to step aside and let the place to my brother my big brother to say who was there because he was there he was born in 19 [Music] something that's where I'm standing amen can you do this are you sad are you courageous now you have to set your your your belt oh the Bible is telling us stories or is telling us the truth if the Bible is telling us stories we have to close it and put it aside Paul is saying that we were raised up together with Christ and since that Resurrection we are in Heavenly places who is that who are them [Music] people who are them people who are the we I would like to uh to project the the book of Jeremiah chapter 1 I will ask so many question but together with you are you there J chapter 1 verse 4 the Bible says then the word of the Lord came unto me [Applause] saying the word of the Lord the infinite the ones that never lies [Music] Hallelujah came to me say before I formed the before Lord I form the in the belly of mother I knew now I'm asking you the question who is that Jeremiah that the Lord knew before he was even born who is that Jeremiah amen before the Lord form thee in the matter b let it please you to catch this it's God who formed us even in the belly of our mothers says the father gives a seed with a million of cimons [Music] the mother gives Millions now there's an intelligence that decides so that only one only one SE germs can uh meet the egg so that I can be born it's no longer dad's problem it's no long mother's problem there is supreme intelligence we are not born by chance we don't come to the World by chance it's the decision of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus let me tell you the god that decide that you come on he can't decide of your height of who you are now even if your biological father Cur you that God is more than able to change the curse because the one who formed us is the Lord somebody can say am now my question is this who is that Jeremiah that the Lord knew before he was even form being formed before I form the in the belly of mother I knew the and before that come forth out of their wombs I sanctify the and orain the a prophet unto the Nations have some courage who is that Jeremiah consecrated by God because it was not even a man yet but before he even became a man God consecrated God ordained the a prophet who is that Jeremiah I will just put a comma here the prophet it's not the flesh clear as the water I knew before you come you came out of your our the prophet who is that person it's not the flesh then the prophet it's not the flesh the preacher it's not this there is a preacher in the preacher amen I will make a statement stat I started to exist before to exist I I your mother's thank you Lord Jesus that's the reason why when a man is consecrated to God even the man even the man refuse to pray for him he already been consecrated he's already consecrated you won't do anything to him if God is for us who will be against us who is the man come when God consecrated Jeremiah who did God consult did heah who did God consult I love what the prophet says that's why brother bham says if God wants wants you to be certain something on this Earth amen he will take you himself and he will lead you to the something that he wanted you to be that's why you going to [Music] be even if the Witchcraft comes together they cannot stop you they cannot stop the decision of the Lord now I'm asking you the question who is that Jeremiah that God knew God consecrated who that Jeremiah because the man Jeremiah the flesh Jeremiah were not even there I'm asking you another question the Bible says the Lord speak to job see you think you smarter than me you're complaining about the evil that happens to you fasten your seat Bel and teach me who are [Music] you when I I've created the Earth when the morning stars for joy and the sons of God were clapping the hands now I'm asking you the question who were born at that time when God founded the Earth what body was existed there who are them sons of God that were clapping their hands who were they now answer me who are them people that were there they were even clapping their hands with joy but in the flesh they were not even there meaning that the sons of God easily we can say it's us right we always say that but you were born in 1940 then who are there the you that you talking about who is it that's the little noise that I'm going to be making now we'll uncover who are these [Music] people the people that started to exist before they were born in the flesh who are [Music] there they were even with God when God was created creating the world they were there who are there amen I don't think I'm troubl you because those are the thing that you already know when I say something that is outside I have a captain here it will light it up how many knows when Jesus was [Music] dead when his body was dead there Jesus was still working how many knows you got to know it when people were weeping over his body and the body was not moving Jesus was in activity let me tell you that's why my Prophet is teaching and that's what the Bible say the Bible says when he was dead in his flesh he went to preach to the souls that were in prison now you're going to understand the preacher it's not the [Music] body the Bible says in the first Peter for them that are taking notes Verse 18 to 20 Jesus uh Christ has once suffered just put to death theh Qui by Quicken by the [Music] Spirit by which also he went to and preached unto the spirits in prison then while he was dead it's the flesh that was dead but Jesus was in activity oh who is that Jesus because the body was dead dead but who is that Jesus that went to preach what Jesus we easily say when he was buried he carry away our sins but the body was dead dead buried who is that person that carry away our sins Jesus was here we are Weeping over him at the same time we are crying over him activity carrying away my sin who is that Jesus while he was dead that is snatched the key of hell and the tomb from Lucifer amen while he was dead on the other side he tackled the devil he gave him a little punch he took away the key and then here the body's dead it means my brother even when this body can be blocked or hindered you can continue your activity bear with me a little bit now I'm asking you another question when Jonah was in the whale physically what could he [Music] do he didn't have the possibility to move around he didn't have the ability to move around he was blocked from both side but something who was in Jonah that thing was in Jonah let me say it open that thing is the true Jonah he said when he was hindered it turned his [Applause] mind and look to the temple who was that person that was looking to the temple was fixed to something it was hindered how did he turn to the temple you have eyes Beyond this eyes you are powerful outside of this body this morning just because way of your soul travel with your soul travel don't limit yourself of what this body sees maybe you don't know it you are powerful when your body is when the body of Jesus was hindered blocked he gave a punch to the devil yes the body blocked but Jesus was still working then who is that Jesus that was doing those activities Prophet the Bible says the prophet says yes okay says question and answer uh on Hebrews uh uh part two paragraph 419 I'm just taking a little part now his flesh dot dot while here his soul was over here witnessing to the soul the Lost L down taking the keys from the devil who took the key from the devil his soul that's his soul that was W witnessing to this lost it's still the soul that took the keys from the devil and come came back abah is bringing Abraham [Music] Isaac his soul was laying in there doing that while his body was laying in the grave who is that Jesus that was doing those things that was his soul when the body was lay there when the body was laying there without life his soul was an activity that is why I'm making this statement even when my body can be hindered and blocked when my human senses are blocked I have something in me that can go beyond that can give me victories that can lay kick the devil amen bear with me as the prophet said it was his Souls that brought back Abraham you know that was the saint that in Paradise now look says when he went to the paradise not everybody saw him the same way I saw I'm seeing the soul of [Music] Jesus when Abraham looked at him Abraham saw a [Music] man he saw a man to whom he gave the food he was Jesus in his soul at the same time at the same time Daniel looks the same man he doesn't see a man he's seeing a stone that is coming out from the mountain without the help of a hand be spiritual at the same time the same person eel saw him he doesn't see a man he doesn't see a stone he saw a whe that is turning in the middle of the W at the same time fixed him he saw a pel of fire of fire that was coming in the Garden of Eden let me tell you you your soul multi your soul can travel and appear like a star your soul can travel and look like a [Music] m your can travel can take a certain form according depending on the CC ances all of you here has experience it happens to you physically you sleeping but you see yourself with with G fix to your enemy who is that you because physically you are sleeping who is the other person that is fighting who is the other person that means you can come out of yourself I'm asking a question who is that BR that was translated wellam was sleeping who he was in on the bed who was there I'll disturb you a little bit the Bible says that an angel that got sent that was speaking to John in the Highland of pmos and that angel at the same time John wanted to worship Him and the angel told him I'm one of your brother in service Serv and Prophet a prophet yes asking you the question who is that Prophet who is that Prophet says might be that it could be elij there is the one who speaking to John phally speaking Elijah was not there then who is that Elijah speaking to John if that Elijah it might be Bram but we were not even 1909 no no if that Elijah could have been Elijah of he he were not there who is now you scared let me tell you you are stronger than what you see your soul if it's caught up you can realize a lot of exploits I have something behind that is giving me courage to make this statement my Soul started to exist before my body you see me here myself here I out Adam myself here I started Living I started acting when was [Music] creating I was there let me repeat I was there who is there my soul I'm giving you two uh quotes first quote demonology Physical Realm paragraph 27 just have a little courage paragraph 27 but but your souls we made up before the foundation of the [Music] world when God created man in his own image says not a man in his own image a man okay but men that's what the scripture [Music] says what that's why the scripture says God created man after his own image not a man after his own image not a man one man no no man men in general it's in that day that your soul was created that was that day that my soul was created in another words I lived with ad that's when started to exist says created a [Music] man in his own image before forming a man from the dust of the earth that means my soul started to exist before my body it's my body that was born in 1965 but my soul the brother here is not my big brother he is my big brother in the flesh but when it comes to the soul we are we are the same age amen now I can preach now when Jesus was going to the Cross he was not alone I was there am when he went to the the the grave he was not alone I was there let me tell you you have visited hell and the hell told you you have no place here I'm going to make statement there's no way for a preacher to lose me no I I deal I dealt with [Music] Lucifer lufer couldn't hold me I have no place in when Jesus give a little K to the devil in the hell I was there Satan is not stronger than we may think let me tell you it's a revelation that's not given to this body it's a revelation that in my soul that is why a predestinated soul that was in God that with Jesus could not stay in the grave no way he could not in the grave that's why say when Jesus was res resurrected I myself you to My Soul Your Soul raised up together and we started traveling we started Living the Earth while the Saints of the Old Testament was shouting open the gates oh Gates of Heaven open your Gates let the glor god of Glory the king of glory make his entrance the king of glory was not alone I was there I was there thank you Lord Jesus it's then that my soul it's living in a Heavenly in Jesus [Music] Christ now let me tell you openly who are you myal see my body on the Earth but at the same time my body is here on the earth my soul is in heaven and the Heavenly places it's above all Domin all rulers all Au that is why my brother before circumstances my eyes can fear my body can shake I if I just do the traveling of a soul if I remember where I came from by my soul I can travel I can travel above of the circumstances I go that is why I'm coming to tell up up light because your has your day has come and look when God created me when God created you because I'm speaking of Genesis 1 when God created a man after his own image he gave him a mission what was that mission it's the only thing that my soul knows my Souls doesn't know any vocabulary that to rule over in Heavenly places is to rule over that's why well if I'm disturbing you just bear with me for forgive me my brothers just forgive me these things just trouble get my in my soul why we don't have any progress because of the traveling of the soul to lift up the soul to his position under the the the blood of the goat after the bus before were even the true atonement a man just con was focusing Soul when when the god bow was having dominion over Israel when God was ruling over Israel when all isra fell into that man stood up without sword without any weapon his soul was [Music] expressing shall not be rain who is that person El who is that [Music] Elijah sp there was no prayer that in the name of to break the word of a [Music] man the word of a little God even the almighty God just submitted himself to the word of Elijah the to the point where he had a meeting what should we [Music] do so that the word of Elijah be fulfilled and like to pronounce that word and never came back to it he never think he never think twice says if a man pronounce the word the word of God and do not doubt in his heart God will have a meaning even demons we go to that meeting to make it fulfill the word of that man wake up from your sleep recognize who you are he pronounced the word one day passed a month later I see I see Jezebel she's bringing together all the prophets of B there's no rain just do your your prayers Let the Rain Fall and the prophet of just focus somewhere soul man thank you Lord Jesus and let me remind you we went back then under the blood of the you have privileges that El didn't have you you have privileges that elij didn't have let just make our soul trouble Elijah was quiet he didn't even think how himself will leave when there will be a Dr dropped he blocked everybody God open a bridge for him thank you Lord Jesus that feed that will give him drink while everybody was [Music] suffering Elijah was enjoying he was not even thinking he didn't have rle on his face no ey pressure no crisis stomach crisis he us his soul and the rest that was God taking control because he's a high priest of our confession it's not what he said my all power is in you it's up to you that is it's up to you to use it that moment says what is the other age other than this where the sons of God has to be manifested look at how you are so scared the church who supposed to travel with their souls they're afraid of f they're afraid of magic people even when people when they say the travel a believer of a message tremble why there's no more progress going on because we don't have more traveling of a soul let's leave the dimension of five senses know that even when five can be blocked we have another one we have atomic bomb your soul your soul went to hell the devil could not hold it how is that possible the devil can block you today when the devil lied to the angels it couldn't you no you stood to the of God couldn't hold you where the devil can corner you and you couldn't over you can't I just beg you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's get into the traveling of a soul forget things that we [Music] see why God is allowing that this body can be blocked so that our eyes can be turned to the Heavenly places your soul and my soul live constantly that the weding is Awakening that is why the prophet saying everything it's possible to them that it's [Music] about not shaking my brother not a day years a man that blocked everybody in years the king himself blocked those of Idols blocked can you understand that you are able to block idols the same way that shook before the AR and fell before the AR was crushed before the the same way no matter theth will bow their knees will fall before you it's just a problem of the Awakening of Soul who are you you are after the image of God if there's one thing that God cannot do is to fail his word as long as I live as long as I you [Music] shall let just stand as an army
