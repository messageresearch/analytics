way so simple way okay even the high priest that was reading the bible couldn't understand that it was on the earth you know vermont says we don't have to put the message as a necessary message is modern event made clear about the prophecies amen amen when he was born was now born in the big hospitals it was born in little cabin where uh animals are birthed to the point nobody could notice him

amen amen he was [Applause] other the way human being can be born messily grandiose he was you know even the garden of gethsemane he wanted to refuse but since he was alive lamb don't refuse it that's
