though we were in New Foundland we seen people all over the world we seen people from Jamaica that had preach for brother Osman Bartley and brother Keith Reed I mean the last place in the world you'd think you'd see a Jamaican in New Foundland they're everywhere amen but God's family is everywhere and it was just beautiful and and we thank brother Carson and sister Sharon their their their place is beautiful very beautiful very uh very very nice and we just could go and just relax and just be ourself and uh it was very nice fish are amazing and New Foundland uh it was just a really good time and camp meeting was wonderful it was really really wonderful it was really really well done tremendously well done by the church and how they had just rallied around their churches roughly the same size as ours maybe just slightly bigger and uh you know it was just just a before we preach just a little side notes that were exciting to me before we went to Camp they were excited to say that they were expecting 65 people amen you know most times we we compare God in numbers we think if it ain't 600 people well God won't be there but see God will just come for one soul man one Soul one soul is worth 10,000 worlds amen and so it it was beautiful and if you ever want to go to a beautiful place and a beautiful Campground and beautiful word of God go to New Fountain it was really really wonderful amen amen amen I was going to maybe sing a song but maybe we'll sing them at the the end Amy let's stand and feel like I'm forgetting something but amen let's stand and look into his word we'll maybe sing some songs just some songs just really enjoyed the specials this morning they were beautiful amen oh yes I was forgetting something next Sunday brother Ron mevi AAL thank you brother CS uh Ron Mev ail and his family his two girls will be with him his oldest son that's married his wife and and Grand son and brother June from Toronto is bringing them and so there it why I will confirm this maybe through our group text but as far as I know they're coming up on Saturday and so if that's the case we'll throw a party at our place Saturday everybody's welcome it'll be just whatever happens amen we don't know what time they'll get there so it's hard to make plans uh I'm it'll be much better if they come on Saturday much the better uh they had considered if they were bringing so many if they would come on Sunday morning that would be an early morning for them but uh we just look forward to now Ron mevo I know personally we stayed in his house twice I preach from two different times different trips or I believe I did two different trips I have to think about that but we actually used his house for our our luggage when we would travel around the Philippines we'd leave all our bags there and come and go as we want and just a beautiful beautiful family and testimony and church and and so I'm thrilled to have him come amen and just you know uh brother Ron has you know God has a a garden of flowers and we're all unique and his ministry is unique very beautiful but very unique he's a tremendous singer he sent himself through school singing he plays the guitar and the whatever that thing is at the same time over his neck and and it's just very very beautiful and so we just look forward to that so if he comes on Saturday and we'll let you know you're welcome to come and meet him before Sunday and fellowship and and then Sunday will be here and we'll have lots of wonderful Fellowship just remember their travel they're in Ottawa now and the closing of the convention there in Ottawa and they'll be traveling here and preaching for John Dana on Wednesday all these things amen let's turn to Psalms 511 and I want to just uh something that I I I'm not sure if I'll get through it but I'm going to do what God tells me to do and and something that uh if I don't get through it um God help us to understand that we'll preach it twice amen I want to look into something here and tell that that your joy is in the Lord Lord your joy is in the Lord hallelujah but let those that put their trust in thee the Lord rejoice and let them shout for Joy because thou defend them and let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee now now that's powerful that don't say that when you're having trials you can change your joy I don't say that when something goes wrong your joy never changes and and that was amazing when I was studying let's just read that again and let those that put their trust in the Lord Rejoice now I want to ask you this a question this morning he says what you have does anybody else want what you got and what you testify of and your life is anybody else in the world trying to be exactly like you now I want to give you an example you know like when Hollywood if they have a star or a hockey player everybody will buy his T-shirt with his name on it or like if somebody sings and they hold the mic like this or like this and then everybody that worships that person they sing the same way so those people want to be like the other people but is there anybody in the world want to be exactly like you wow and let them shout now that's that's that's pretty loud for Joy because thou defend this them now that means we have absolutely zero worry and let them also that love the Lord his name be joyful in thee Lord Jesus I pray that somehow through my scrambled words that you'll you'll portray to the your bride of Christ here the the thoughts and the I the the the desire that you had when you give this to me Lord Jesus and we give you the glory for it and all of eternity and Lord I pray that you'll change me continue to change me daily Lord Jesus to your perfect statue that you've seen Lord Jesus before the foundation of the world we give you the glory for it in your name amen amen you may have your seats I want to show you something here you in the Bible Joy or joyful is mentioned 430 times but happy and happiness is mentioned 10 and I would have never thought of the difference many times we would compare joy to happiness but it's not the same not even close amen not as a Believer it's not even close see Joy has characteristics for God's people for God's wife that's found in his presence see a Believer has Joy because they know their position in Christ it don't matter what falls down around us it don't matter if your house burns or it don't burn it don't matter if you have a flag Tire or don't burn you're it don't change the bottom line is you came from God and if you came from God you're going back to God and what happens in this world whether you obtain riches or wealth or favor of men or not favor of men it don't change the bottom line at all it don't matter if you have 10,000 people in this church or 10 people in this church I came from God and when God reveals that to you your position in Christ you can have joy you know and I I'm going to jump way ahead the Bible says that Christ through even though he realized the the pain of the Cross and asked his heavenly father to take it from him for the joy that was set before him there not a lot of joy in the cross endured the cross and the shame and the the the failure that everybody present would have considered that cross but he knew who he was he knew his position he knew he was Jehovah so it had an anchor of Joy Hallelujah you know why nobody's rushing to the gospel I don't know one person in the world that's negative that people are rushing to be around you know me and Lan went to a funeral this week and this is kind of a community joking so I don't expect you to get it but we were in the community and there's a person in the neighborhood that is just chronic negative Ju Just chronic negative if you knew the whole story it would make you chuckle he had three years crop of beans in the bin because he couldn't sell them he had so much money he was a retired school teacher and his wife was a something they have huge itions they have more money than they could possibly spent but there's never a positive word that comes out of that person's mouth and it was so bad that he caught me at the funeral home he will go out of his way to share his negativity he he's a very good minister of the Gospel that he believes in negativity and he had caught me and my beautiful wife had came from chadam and she caught me and she took my hand and she understood the situation that I was in and she was like Hallelujah yeah let's keep going and I got in the funeral line and the biggest business in dresen is Dennis Jackson that owns Jackson seeds and he came and he he skipped a whole bunch of people and he said Dale I seen you got caught by that positive person see in his life he never ever had anything that he could be joyful about do you know we we don't believe that the the the righteous men the footsteps are ordered of the Lord if your children backside it's part of God's plan they can't be lost if they were in his hand you know if you if you get sick it was part of God's plan CU God couldn't heal people that aren't sick and so praise God I'm sick and I'm not dead yet you know it used to say people would say how are you and they say well I'm on I'm on the right side of the sod you can just be happy about everything praise God it's raining too much this year they figure the bean crop will be really big even though there's killo spots if we get no rain at all does it really matter do you know with the funeral that we went to I worked for those people it was my first job and I was working for them in the 80s in ' 84 and ' 85 does anybody remember that time was anybody born in 84 85 put your hand up if anybody was older me an 84 and 85 I'll guarantee you you got a good memory of that because that's when interest went to 24% at the bank and I remember those people struggling and scrimping and splitting pennies to run a business yes sir I remember them telling us hired men that every time they made a pain at payment at the bank they lowered their Equity so they were still in our rear that's what happened use young people that don't know when when when you get older and you get gray hair and your parents try to warn you of something it's because they lived an experience before you I had Farmers tell me that when they bought a farm it was valued for $100,000 and they'd pay 10,000 off it and Farm Credit say it's only worth 80 now so they'd pay another 10 now it's only worth 70 and they'd force them into bankruptcy cuz see you're only wealthy if somebody tells you you're wealthy hello you're only wealthy if the people in the government or in business tell you you're wealthy but that's not how Christianity is amen I I'm going to go and I'm going to close out when Israel was in bondage and they were in slavery and the prophet talked about that and and they could have the Bible says that the the strength of the Lord was the the joy of the Lord was their strength and they were in slavery and Jerusalem was destroyed their walls were knocked down their Gates were burned and the and the the the the the top men of Israel were serving the enemy King but they could their shoulders back and know that I know who my papa is and I'm not in my homeland yet man and it's all burned over and and amen and we ain't got everything but I know it's coming I know it's here I know it's available and his Joy was so powerful that when he served the king now you can read this in Nehemiah the second chapter when he served the king his wine the king picked up his Joy wow oh bless God I don't have a very good job I need a raise you're letting your outward feelings rob you of your Eternal joy and nobody else wants it amen back to this community joke the man that came back to visit me and realize that I had been caught because he had also been caught see people that have bad news like spread in it people that got good news don't spread it at all why are you keeping the joy of your salvation to yourself cuz see this person in the Dresden area had also caught Dennis Jackson and he had to escape for his life too amen and when he come back to me you know you see how people never want to be around that kind of an attitude you know brother Bram said it like this he saidou know the farmer went forth and sold wheat somebody else came forward and sold Cocker birs and weeds and when it came and we're going to I'm going to bring you that quote I'm just I'm just skimming from it from memory from studying but he said exactly what nature was in your seed you know I preached a message and brother Carson picked up on it later I preached a message about what's in your cup and you you mentioned about a year later and that was a long time ago but whatever is in you will come out of you and so if you're a Cocker you're going to fuss fume complain disgust brother Brown says it just like that I I'll read it later on fuss fume complain everything's wrong nobody's right oh the president lost and oh we got a terrible you should say praise God for our government hallelujah we're going home soon Glory I hope they bankrupt the country Glory I hope I lose that farm because I know my redeemer liveth I know that's crazy but don't wake me up because this is an eternal hope amen happiness unlike happiness true Joy satisfies Joy the Bible describes joy as full and complete Joy is not just for a short period of time it's it's it's a decision and a lifestyle ien I mean I can only use the examples that I was raising my daddy was a born farmer I mean as far back as history has it my parents grandparents on both sides of every even me and thew were farmers and my dad lived through droughts that he didn't have to bother combining the crop and he lived through bounties and he lived through strength but he was joyful to tell you I'm a farmer it wasn't all sunshine and Roses amen the world that has no hope is living in disaster state but you're letting some we're guilty it's it you God help us you know that we don't let our circumstances drag us down you know what I mean like you know like you have prayer meeting you say oh man church starts at 10: I got to wake up well praise God you can wake up and praise God that you have a church and it actually starts but see how we are we say oh I was or oh it's Wednesday and I I really don't have the heart to go but but you could not have a choice of going you could live in North Korea or you know one of these places where you wouldn't be allowed to go or you could live in a place where there is no church to go to at all or you could just flat out be Dad or not even a believer you see how you know people they pray for a job you don't watch oh Lord give me a job and they like oh I wish I could have Friday off I wish I you know people are looking for a family and Families will come there their promise and Heritage for God and I was telling somebody about people that we know and I said you watch well I'll give you an example and we know them very well praise God and by the way I'll stop right here and say brother Jeff and sister Doma their a their offer on the house by us got accepted and so it'll be a piece of cake for God to sell their house in Kitchener that's I mean that's not hard at all right for remember how I said it God to sell amen you know I remember when Jeff and dobl were crying for babies it'll be no time at all and they'll be crying to stop them you see you see how we are so flimy and change on our happiness God help us he said Joy satisfies in a way that temporary H happiness will never satisfy sorrow and suffering will come to pass but do Joy continues in spite of hardship Eternal Joy is promised to come and it doesn't matter what the situation is amen you know you we want to be careful what we ask for and pray for God help us you know I can remember remember th this is a bit of an inside joke for me but I can remember before Co I was Desiring to feed a bunch of cattle I wish I wouldn't have had that desire cuz God knew Co was coming and the bottom fell right out of them you see what I mean in every situation you just say oh praise God I got cattle but they're not worth nothing well don't change our Eternal destination it does it change anything back to back to the I I got cut off of this thing back to this my first job and this lady had died she was uh what was she 68 two years younger than my oldest brother and far younger than my sister that makes me nervous when your siblings start dying that's H that means that you know you're getting close to the mark and I told you how they used to scramp in that and we come home from the funeral and how interest was 24% and how they lower but I forgot to tell you this part does all that matter now she's dead she's As Dead As Dead could be and all that scraping for 24% interest it wouldn't have mattered if they would have went broke or not went broke it wouldn't have matter if they are millionaires now or trillionaires or or just thousandaires you know when you get your perspectives in order it'll change a lot of our problems amen we'll be happy to serve God Amen it doesn't matter who our government is it doesn't matter who wins the election it doesn't matter who loses the election doesn't matter at all God's got it all it's all prophecy being fulfilled hallelujah it's your life is literally prophecy being fulfilled God formed you and seen you and you were in his thoughts and you're just like a tool in his hand and you got to go a certain route to see people meet you and and you're going to minister to people that it's all part of his plan but our emotions go up and down based on we think you know blessings are not no signs of God's approval on your life the most worldly people in the world are rich don't mean God's blessing them oh my goodness let's not let's use the right measuring stick for our life amen do you have are you so bouncy that everybody wants to be around you wow that your house is always full because people just can't leave your sunshine wow here in Hebrews 122 and I already mentioned this but I'll just do this you know Jesus say is going to the cross and he had Joy he said Jesus looking to the AER and finisher of his faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down at the right hand of the father on the throne amen do you recognize your position in Christ and you're depressed that's impossible the two don't go together man let's look at some scriptures and some of these scriptures and we're going to go fastly through some of them but some of them I'm going to show you what the prophet said to this exact scripture here in Psalms 518 and 12 it said make me to hear the joy and gladness that the bones which thou H has broken May Rejoice now here's David you know David wasn't always in Perfection and God had to spank him and he's rejoicing in his spanking says praise the Lord I got a mama that'll spank me Hallelujah I got a Daddy That'll correct me would you rather not have one of the either verse 12 he said restore on here's David talking right after he's commanding of God breaking his bones he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold hold me with thy free spirit saying that the Holy Spirit was a free spirit and restore now watch this this is how the the brother Brown said it said you notice that brother uh brother Brown saying this about David he said you know that David never said give me my salvation the joy of my salv but he said restore it he hadn't lost his salvation he he had been a Messi believer and he was a drag oh bless God and everybody cleared out and went to the Pentecostal Church could you blame them you needed counseling to come to a message church because they were see d David was asking for the joy of what God had already gave him give me back you've already given me my salvation you've already give me the truth but give me the joy of all the Revelation that God has proed to us in this day give me the joy that you've taken the scales off my eyes and I can read the Bible like a brand new book and I can see my name here in Ephesians 1 and Romans 8 and I can see myself everywhere in the book Genesis 1 126 to 27 the Jo huh we should be recklessly Joyful recklessly Joyful well Hallelujah I ain't got enough money to pay the bills Hallelujah I got bills must mean I'm breathing but you don't oh oh I got my hydro bill I got my gas bill Hallelujah here David and I'm just paraphrasing to speed up and this isn't why cry but speak David was asking for the joy of his salvation what God had already given and he said taste and see that the Lord is good that's Psalms 348 taste and see as the Lord as good as not unjoy amen and taste and see it tastes like the Honey in the Rock is Psalms 81:16 you know David was an amazing believer an amazing believer Hallelujah the Honey in the Rock he was singing all these things how God was so full he was so full inside he said David said this he said my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life Hallelujah David was losing the kingdom to his son and man he had some major problems but the joy of the Lord God help us Hallelujah here brother bram's given an altar call and he saidis there no bomb in Gilead he said this could be your last chance to testify of the joy of the Lord in your life he said the holy spirit's here and if you've Fallen weak or lukewarm and in your experience you'd like to renew it Again David said restore unto me the joy of myself ation and he said he had lost his joy and I think it goes about 95% of the message churches today they lost their joy and nobody wants to be like you because you forgot your smile amen he said oh here's another one he said you'll go through trials and troubles and ups and downs and misunderstandings and that don't have one thing to do with it he said when Israel had backslid and they were down in Egypt and there were Bo they never lost their Covenant but they lost their joy and he said David you know he's repeating David hadn't asked for the but just to restore the joy of his salvation his salvation remained but he went off on the wrong end and lost the joy of his salvation God help us God help us in this day you know we're going to be squeezed more than we are today and are you struggling now then how are you going to witness to anybody and say I have something better than you have but I'm more depressed than you really I want to show you some examples of why we had the right to be recklessly joyful is that all right recklessly joyful in Jeremiah 29:11 he says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil glory to give you watch this there's no word here by mistake to give you an expected end God knew exactly where you were going to end exactly how you were going to end and all this stuff in between is just to see if you can keep the joy that's of the Lord remember remember I haven't got to this quote yet but we're going to get to this remember this what's on the inside will magnify itself out and so the that the fruits of the spirit and and and I'm jumping way ahead and all over here but the fruits of the spirit were love and joy was second and so you aren't telling me this morning that you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're not joyful in any situation in every situation it's not possible because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Joy it an apple tree produces apples God is love and and God is Joy amen our next verse next example and I got about 10 here Psalms 9110 and 11 now this this is why you can be ridiculously joyful you know osben Bartley really spank me when he was here whoa Saturday morning I can tell you the service I was rejoicing but I was whimpering too said Christians don't worry about anything your kids are struggling to that's not worry that's God's problem not your problem that's God's problem to fulfill the promise amen it's God's promise to fulfill the promises that that your kids are your heritage and they'll be saved it's God's PR say that every seed will bring forth of its kind and it might be a while for the seed to come but just be prepared for twins or triplets I mean when they come sometimes it's a big Bounty crop you don't think so you know we were whine let let me just confess to you you probably heard some whining from me or Jared this year about the weather ouch you can say yes I'm repenting Jared don't even know this but the government has done surveys already and they figure that the bean crop will be a bountiful crop even though there's bare ground because there's been so much rain that it's going to produce like crazy they average the crop you don't even know this the average crop they figure for the county will be 54 bushel an acre which is beyond belief and two months ago I would talk to any one of you and said you know it's been a really hard year for apartment oh forgive me Lord see I'm guilty too because oh it's been really hard keeping the house with all these kids would you rather not have any kids oh my gas bill is really high would you rather not have a vehicle you could ride a bike oh we're B sometimes Psalms 91:10 and 11 there shall be no evil Beall thee let's be said on that note hello there shall no evil be Thee thank you Jes doesn't matter what the weather is does it matter what your job is does it matter what happens to your family could they be lost on that note there'll be no evil before the Hallelujah I mean maybe we we don't even need all the promises in the book we only need a few of them to be happy neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling that means you don't have to go to the doctor to get poked because God poked you before the foundation of the world and you ain't going to go nowhere until God's done with your poking yeah yeah amen I mean this is the Bible we're okay with we're okay we do believe the Bible Y and he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways that that's including your mistakes and shortcomings that's including in all your way it don't say accepting your mistakes oh oh wow when I was studying this it was unbelievable now let's not be joyful on that note really you see we don't have to tell people out there we don't have to tell the outside world you I want to give you a testimony if you don't think you're being affected do you know when we were in New Foundland the neighbors next door text us they wanted to know if we'd arrive safely and wanted to know when we'd be back and they were going to Neer Falls and they let us know about their trip now I don't have to tell him God sent a prophet I just got to go woo woo woo woo I got something that the word can't give and the word can't take it away and they're [Music] going I got something that the world can't and it keeps me day by day I got something we're shouting about it makes me sing and it makes me shout amen you don't have to preach to anybody just show them a smile just say praise the Lord you go first Hallelujah I hold the door and they're like John 17:22 and 23 and the glory which you gave me I have given to you now this is Jesus talking to himself talking to the Father which is inside of him and he's saying the glory that is mine I'm given to the bride of Christ now that I'll just tell you what I don't think you really get the full effect because you'd be running the a of but right now that's pretty powerful Glory yeah I mean that's like right up there that's like a 10 plus that they may be one even as we are one and in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world here we go oh oh that that Joy problem that the world may know amen that thou has sent me and has loved them and thou has loved me how could we be sad about that that we got the glory that's given to us by Heaven is that affected by a job or by a flat tire or by you know oh I mean there's things that are a drag there's things in our lives that you know but we can when we come to maturity we can you know what a mature parents hide their difficulties from their kids mature parents don't talk about the pastor in front of their kids mature parents don't tell the kids they ain't got the bills paid no mature parents don't tell the because the kids aren't mature hello John 6:39 and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me I shall lose a whole bunch nothing but shall raise it up again in the last day so no matter what the state of your family is you can be joyful you know I'm I'm going to guys say come to me and and I believe it's God you know when we were in New Foundland on Wednesday night we prayed for sister Sharon's brother and I was thrilled in my heart to bubbling over over that we went to see them now the doctors told him that your Bladers got cancer and we're going to take it out and we're going to put a plastic bag on the outside with a host I worked with the man when I was in high school that had a plastic bag on on the outside just in case you've never worked side by side with somebody like that it's not a pretty operation and God completely healed sister Sharon's brother totally he don't even need to see a doctor for a large period of time he has no bag he never took his bladder out no amen and I'll tell you what when we went and seeing him he was a happy man he was very very wonderful but he don't know the Revelation you know would you have been so happy in that situation he was he I mean was he happy H I'm just like I would have been just the outside man would might have been destroyed but the Inside Man wouldn't have been amen what Paul said in the Bible was to live is Christ and to die is gain it don't matter when you know the bottom line like all these other numbers in between don't matter you know sometimes the way she was paying a lot of bills this week you know and she'll show me where all the money went CU sometimes I've been guilty of believing the impossible that all the money's gone but you know it all that matters at the end is is there money in the B it don't matter what's in between but that's what our joy is in Christ Psalms 3723 and 24 for the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and he delighteth in his ways and though he fall he shall not utterly be cast down for the Lord upholdeth his hand Wow Let's Be Sad on that note see see how we supposed to we have this Joy ain't affected by happiness it's it's a different word Jo you can be joyful in the midst of Sorrow knowing that you're in God's will you're part of God Amen we what what do Believers have more great joy that in death that we'll see each other again and fellowship for all of eternity this is just a window a very small basement window of life amen and this is dead dead close my favorite scripture Genesis 1:26 to 28 and I wasn't going to read all this but God showed me some stuff in here that we need to look at at for a few minutes in 26 he said God said let us make man in our image and and I'm not going to dwell on this part because you've heard me say it that's God asking you for permission to make you because you were in God and and my question to that answer would be was who was God talking to let us who was the US there's only one God the only only other people in this equation is the predestinated election but that's not where I want to go after our likeness and let them have dominion and he mentions this two times in this scripture and I want to show you what Dominion means this is for you this ain't for the five-fold ministry this ain't for the great evangelist this ain't for the person that's got a Healing Ministry it's for you here's God saying let them have Domin and the word dominion here means to rule or have power over your problems and situations Dominion oh Genesis 1 26- 28 oh Dominion means to have power over to rule or to have power over your problems in situations now God did this before the foundation of the world so it's not possible that you could struggle because this is God's order that you're going to be the boss the boss remember remember brother Brown preached the message why cist speak and Moses came to God like oh I got a problem God's like deal with it amen and and now now watch I'm going to finish this part here he said it was over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of there a and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now that totally means that you this morning are the god of your environment your Earth your situation your home you're think you are the Dominion the ruler and dictator over everything that goes on in your life if you came from God so we care about the election how could we care about the election when God gave us we're the boss over the dict the uh elected it don't matter how they change the laws they can't touch God's right that's not possible amen verse 27 and so God created man in his own image and in the image of God created him male and female created he them now it's going to be really hard to be not joyful on that note but let's look to verse 28 again and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and sdo it I means you're the boss you are the boss you're this is God's orders okay and then sedu it wasn't a strong enough word for God and he goes right on he says and have dominion so we're to sedo it and be the boss ruler over it that don't put a lot of people above you hello that don't put a lot of people above you you see you're God's wife you're the queen you're his rib your word is as good as his you're going to Jud you're looking at me like a blank face you're going to judge the world it ain't going to be God it's going to be the bride how could how could you worry about some little tiny decision oh I don't know what to decide here you're going to make the decisions of the world Hallelujah and over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth that pretty much gives you the boss over everything and God give all this to you and you can't find joy in the promise of your life Wow amen God help us here we got to my favorite quote here about the nature of the seed am man let's just read this in questions and answer 61 he said here's a field and it's sewed with cockers and wheat and whatever more and weeds and well there's a drought on and now it doesn't it doesn't seem to matter the dro but everything that was planted in the field is thirsty now I going to tell you something church we need to understand this this is going to help you greatly there's a lot of stuff planted in the field of life and there's a drought on and the weeds are thirsty just like the crop the cockers are thirsty just like the crop and God sends the blessings of rain and everybody become a Pentecostal the cocka birds are like oh GL s and rain today the rag weed they say hallelujah I got a drink praise the Lord I'm not thirsty no more and the wheat says the same thing but what's in their nature shows who they are what's on the inside remember what's in your cup if you bump me and I spill my cup it's not because you bump me it's because there's something in here and what's going to come out is not because you bump me it's because I put water in it and so it's going to be water that comes out because that's what was put in there before the foundation of the world watch how the prophet explains that and the same rain falls and all this and the spirit this he calls the rain the spirit the Spirit falls on the weeds the Hypocrites and it falls on the Christians the same but by your fruits you shall know them and he said you let that sink in for a minute Brethren listen questions and answers 61 paragraph 209 he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost the very next paragraph the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the fruit of it the Fruit of the Spirit Well you say well I'm this I'm a weed I'm a cocko barrel I'm a wheat he said well what kind of a life is in you what kind of Joy if you're a wheat you're going to be joyful you're going to have love and joy first two fruits of Christ and he said the life that's in you if it Bears stickers like a Cocker and watch now this I'm going to read exactly word for word questions and answerers 63 61 sorry if you're a sticker and you're always fussing and cutting up and you're blaming and mean and ill and everything else see what I mean arrogant see it's not the fruit of the spirit it's the fruit of the spirit now I'm still reading is love and joy and meekness and patience and gentleness and see and all that and see so you know for you young ones for my girls for Felix and ilot you don't have to look at what people tell you they are just look at what they produce if somebody's mean to you and ill-favored and angry and always impatient and disgusting and always upset and oh believe me and on and on and on and on doesn't matter what they say they are what's in the cup is spilling out what's in the cup is coming out amen hallelujah Psalms 16:11 man we're doing good for time I might actually finish this thou will show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of Joy wow Thou shalt show me the path of life that's what he did by the message of the hour he showed you where you came from God's plan for your life how you were predestinated before the foundation of the world elect of God and already glorified in Romans 8:26 I believe it is and you can't be joyful we should have this whole whole town of Wyoming coming in here like right like we should be overrun for people to see why we're so ridiculously happy joyful you know when I was a little kid me and Lan knows this thing there was a an evangelist that you won't know he was in the westle church his name was George hofor and he served the devil till he was about 40 years old and he was a drunk and a radical and and he was really worshiping the Lord devil and he paying all his ties of the devil and and all that that goes with it and Hollywood and everything and he got converted and I mean he got radically converted I mean really radically converted there's none of us in here that converted like him I metant this man he had an oppression on my life when he went to the grocery store and he couldn't find something he would say Glory Hallelujah I can't find the ketchup and he said the Alleyways would just clear right out and while there's the ketchup praise the Lord I'll get a bottle the owner of the store came to him he said Preacher Man said when are you going to buy your groceries this week oh I don't know but he said the church pays me my my Ties on Thursday he said I guess I'll come by on Thursday he said why he said cuz everybody in the town's asking me when you're going to be shopping because they want to be here at the same time cuz he had Joy you know that man I know him personally I know his son I know their family this is the truth he would go to revivals to preach you know I told you last time I preached preached I bought a book in Indiana about the revivals from the 30s to the 60s they're unbelievable I was reading it yesterday churches having and the newspaper clipton having two week Revival 10day Revival 14-day Revival Services every night and the churches couldn't hold the people and they don't have what you had some of the messages were even preached on the Trinity oh oh but bless God we got all of God so we don't need careful be very careful amen this evangelist he went to a Revival and I was present when he told the testimony and he said there wasn't one crumb in the house for his wife to eat not one crumb you know what he told his wife he said you go out in the yard honey and get Dand lines and eat dandelion soup until they pay me for preaching the Revival and when they pay me he said I'll wire the money back to you can go to the grocery store and buy something for the family and he got halfway to the Revival now this is a true story I'm not making this up and this ain't in my notes either he got halfway to Revival and his back tire blew and he didn't have one copper penny in his pocket you think you got hard times well let me just tell you something there was people that lived in the 30s and the 20s and they could tell you a thing or two to and you can learn from history or you'll repeat it again and he got behind that car and I want to tell you something else George hath never had the revelation of the Mysteries in this day and the Bible hadn't become a new book and he didn't know what the Seven Seals was he didn't have a clue and he kneeled down in his knels and he put both hands up and he said God you know I'm in your service and I'm going to Revival and I need a new tire and I bought the first car that stopped by stop and give him money for a tire and said I'm way behind on ties and give him some extra and before he even got to the Revival service he was wiring money back to his wife that's what Joy is that's that's what Joy is see you don't quit serving the lord because you don't have your things go bad well like I'm not going to have a crop this year so I'm just going to close the church and just fold up well then I'm not you know what it it show you pretty quick what was in this cup it sure wouldn't be God oh you know well you know God didn't do what I expected and we got a really fat preacher and you know and he's and and I was expecting the move I was expecting God to go to the cemetery the seminaries and the big churches instead of to the to the stable in the manger and so because God didn't come like I said I'll reject him you think those Spirits are dead oh they're alive and well the message hasn't happened like I thought it would portray and I thought God would bring and vindicate the message more openly to our politicians and all this but instead he came to a pig pen an old church where they couldn't afford to finish Society on the front of the wall and the politicians don't even recognize this you said wow that's it that's it that's I can't be God I can't be God there's no way that's God because I thought God would uhhuh what's in the cup will come out of the cup what God put in the cup your nature you cannot change from the nature of what you are you are your daddy's child spiritually speaking there's just things that your daddy spiritually don't do amen God help us I don't even where I was going with that story I lost my train of thought but that's the truth but this this George Hawthorne man I I forget if it comes to me I'll finish it later amen show us the path of righteousness and the presence is fullness of joy and at thy right hand is pleasure every more that's joy unspeakable and full of Glory he said here here brother Brown's talking about he said David was speaking of like life and I'll show you the path of life and did you notice that he will show me he said he could show me and I hope he'll show you that there's joy in the presence of God and there's joy when you walk down this path and looking from side to side in the resurrection of the trees and the leaves and everything that God speak of so let us be God's creatures speaking everything everything that we do and say to let his glory shine forth God help us God help us Philippians 4 4-7 and and I'm hurrying we're we're still not too bad but rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice let your meditations be known unto just the churchgoers amen and the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication and by Thanksgiving letting your request be made known unto God and the peace of God that passes all understanding will give you all the joy shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus that's joy unspeakable and full of Glory amen Psalms 3210 and 11 many are the Sorrows of the wicked but he that trust us in the Lord mercy so compress him about be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye rightous and Shout for Joy all ye of upright heart God's telling us something today I don't know if you're getting it but I throughout the net we could use a good old dose of joy and forget about your circumstances you're crying ain't putting you nowhere if some of our unbelievers just seen that we were happy in our trials maybe they'd be more interested in the god you're confessing Romans 12115 be kindly affectionate one to another and brother love honor preferring one another verse 11 not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord 12 rejoicing in Hope patience in your trials tribulations can continually instant in prayer constantly instant in prayer Distributing to the necessary necess necessities of the Saints given to hospitality you should enjoy being with the saints of God bless them which persecute you Glory Hallelujah I got enemies I'm sorry they don't like me but if you didn't have enemies you wouldn't be alive bless them that bless them and curse not and verse 15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep Romans 5 1:5 thanks Amy Romans 5 1-5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also he has by faith and his grace within stand and rejoice in the hope and glory of God Amen can you imagine if the world had the hope that you have how happy they would be John 15:11 and here here's God talking about God is the vine you know the scriptures right up above this the verse is right up above this here God is the vine and we are the branches and then we can only bring forth the fruit that's in the vine and these things I have spoken unto you now now this is Jesus talking here and he's talking about the vine and the branches these things I have spoken unto you that your joy might remain and that your joy might be full God's telling you his plan for your life that you're going to your joy is going to stay with you all the time and it's going to be full and running over Hallelujah brother Brown quote he said prayer is what changes things you know I read some scriptures on Wednesday night one of the script and this is not the one I got in front of me but brother Brown said that a praying praying wife a Praying sister can do more for the family of God than any Minister can behind the pulpit you know we have in churches sometimes we make mistakes we'll go to Great Lengths and pay thousands of dollars to have a great Minister but I've never yet paid prayed paid a sister for praying for the meetings wow well I was right prayer opens the doors prayer whatsoever you ask in prayer Faith believe in you shall receive it ask abundantly that your jolies may be full James 1 2 and 3 I'm trying to get through these scriptures if you can't tell and I'm think I'm losing my battle you know I mentioned that before 430 times is joy and rejoice mentioned in the bible James 1 2 and 3 my brethren count it all joy when it rains too much count it all joy when your tire blows count it all joy when you lose your job Glory Hallelujah God's got a better job for you count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience and I already mentioned and I'm just going to give you the scripture here and we're going to skip over this but Nehemiah 810 and here here was the the Jo Jo of the Lord is your strength is the end of that verse and when when they're writing when the prophet's writing this verse they're in slavery they're in captivity and the promised land is in ruins the walls have fell down in Jerusalem the gates are burnt they're running for their life the renant was there and you know I want to tell you something else in that scripture Nehemiah was a tremendous I listened to the whole book yesterday you know the king picked up his Joy when he was watch this when he was serving the king his own wife he was a slave he was a waiter he had the old napkin around and said queen king you want another bottle a slave he wasn't getting minimum wage he was a slave he had a ball and chain on one foot but he was serving the king as wine and the King could see what was inside the cup that's powerful and the King allowed him because of his Joy allowed him to go back to Jerusalem and the queen was there was the king and he allowed him he asked him how long would it take you to go back and rebuild fix your city because he was affected by the ruins of Jerusalem and when they went back to fix it not everybody was happy they opened the church because they had to lay brick with one sword one thing and a sword in the other hand and it got so bad it was one for one there was one guy laying in the brick and one guy with a sword that's how it is if you do anything for God they were rebuilding Jerusalem and Judah they were rebuilding the wall they were putting the gates back on the city you think it was a walk in the park and he says but our joy they were so so happy to be laying brick for God with the sword in their hand to fight the enemy off that their slavery King picked up on that's powerful the joy of the Lord is our strength amen here the here I'm just going to read this one quote here forgive me he said grab Faith the sword of the spirit and thus sayith the Lord scream hallelujah amen and cut down every enemy that's in front of you amen he said cut every enemy and the old spooky Spirit to make you feel all and cut up everything with the word of the Lord he said but your strength is the joy of the Lord and he said you get away from me and hack and cut him up with the word and whether it be a demon or whether it be an enemy or whether it be a sickness or a disease or whatever it would be just cut it up with the sword of the word and if you hack at it first time and you don't seem to move it then hack again and hack again and hack again and come out it with the word of God until you chop a hole through there and that little chicken will pick out its head he's talking about a chicken in the egg will poke out its head in the eggshell and cut your wig out he said Hallelujah that's the next one he said amen the battle it's a soldier he said the soldier of the cross and it's the joy of the Lord was their strength God help us Psalms 30 and five and his anger endureth for a moment but in his favor is life and weeping may endure for the night but joy cometh in the morning hallelujah amen no matter how big are trials SE no matter what they are on the outside it don't change our joy it don't change who God made us it don't change the promise of our destination and you know when we come to the end of our life the only thing that's going to matter is what you've done for Christ will last everything else it may be perfectly okay but it will make no difference your last day on this Earth it'll make no the only thing that'll make any difference at all is what you did for Jesus Christ that's right Hallelujah let's stand let's stand I'm not done but I'm losing time hallelujah amen many many things the prophet said there about you can't you can't be something that you ain't you you can't be in a trial and have joy bubbling out if it ain't planted in you amen you know we so many times have such short short Vision but everything is God's plan look look at the scripture where it said God raised up pharaoh and in purpose Harden his heart now that's not nice to Brak glory to him and he now watch this and he God did he hardened Pharaoh's heart against his own people is it possible that God could be hardening the hearts of the governments of our day against God's people and God's doing it on purpose to bring glory to him because the Bible says that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that he's Lord of lords King of Kings hallelujah oh my I I hope you got some little if you got half of what God give me amen the joy of Our Lord help us not to just let these things on the outside oh you know what I give you permit the next time I say it's raining too much just go God help us not to be babies amen God help us amen remember next weekend man it'll be a
