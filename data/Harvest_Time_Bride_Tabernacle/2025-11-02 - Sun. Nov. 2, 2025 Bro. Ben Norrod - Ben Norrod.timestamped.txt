[28:40] whatever. I I had announced when I was
[28:42] doing the prayer request last Sunday
[28:43] about Sister Cindy and she was going for
[28:46] uh Cindy Ward was going for an exam this
[28:50] week and it wasn't that she or for a
[28:53] surgery sorry exam [snorts]
[28:55] uh she was actually going for
[28:58] consultation but I said on her surgery
[29:00] that it was 5050 chance that she could
[29:03] die. It was actually a 50/50 chance that
[29:06] the surgery will be successful. Oh yeah.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; So that was nobody's fault but me. So
[29:12] you can throw your eggs or Amen. It was
[29:15] I didn't mean to mislead anybody on
[29:18] that. But we do pray for Sister Cindy.
[29:20] Me and Lang go visit her. She's in Sia
[29:22] Hospital. If anybody wants to go see
[29:24] her, it's you'll be the one blessed more
[29:27] than her if you go bless her. She would
[29:30] love to be in she her surgery is her
[29:32] goal is as long as she's on the earth,
[29:34] she would love to be with us. She'd like
[29:36] to be mobile and functionable so she can
[29:38] have a normal life. Walk, be in
[29:41] fellowship in church and that. She's
[29:42] having trouble walking. She's having
[29:44] trouble with one arm. But God knows
[29:46] everything. Amen. God's it's just an
[29:48] amazing God. And we love him. And I by
[29:51] no way did I mean to mislead. I didn't
[29:53] mean to uh I I apologize for that. Not
[29:56] to uh to show that uh you know something
[30:00] that wasn't true. Amen. There. Amen.
[30:03] Amen. And we're going to show some uh
[30:04] pictures of of uh
[30:09] uh Jamaica. Brother Osman Bartley's This
[30:12] is Brother Osman Bartley's church
[30:14] building. And we'll just stop there just
[30:16] for a second. We We have lots of time.
[30:18] We got lots of food after. We got more
[30:20] food than you can eat after. I promise.
[30:23] Uh I just a short testimony. He asked
[30:27] brother Osman how they were doing and uh
[30:29] and his house and his goat in his barn
[30:32] and his house was not touched and his
[30:36] goat barn which is
[30:39] uh
[30:41] flimsy.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; He he is a man of labor and work. And he
[30:46] said he he he's banded the whole barn
[30:49] over the roof with wire to to the ground
[30:52] before the hurricane. So he was working
[30:55] his his bones off and he never had a
[30:58] single goat or nothing lost or the barn
[31:00] or so nothing that Osman Bartley owns is
[31:03] damaged except crop. He said the crop
[31:06] was all damaged but this is her church
[31:08] so we can show um
[31:12] some example. Now we will we will this
[31:14] is inside. So we and even this even
[31:17] these pictures you know we can praise
[31:19] God for everything. The wood and the
[31:20] rafters are still there. This is very
[31:23] easy to repair. Piece of cake.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Pop some tin on paneling inside just
[31:29] like new. I want I want to read uh
[31:33] something. I took a picture of it. I
[31:36] could because I'm communicating with
[31:37] Osman Bartley and uh I told him I said,
[31:41] "I wished I were a millionaire and I
[31:44] could really bless the bride of Christ."
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; And this was his response to a man
[31:49] that's digging for money.
[31:52] which he is not. He said, "Your prayers
[31:56] and your care
[31:58] already from the heart will manifest
[32:03] blessings."
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; That's That's a man of God. That's a man
[32:09] of God. Amen. That's a man of God. I
[32:11] also did ask him. I said I said, "Are
[32:14] you and Barbara all right?" I said, "You
[32:16] got food, you got water." And and
[32:18] unbeknownst this this would surprise
[32:20] you. They have less food than they have
[32:22] water. He said there's all the crops
[32:24] were destroyed. There's no banks open.
[32:27] There's no stores open. And there's no
[32:29] food. Food inflation prices will go
[32:31] right through the roof there. And he
[32:33] said there's no hydro, no phone lines,
[32:36] and no internet or nothing. He was
[32:38] operating on his generator. But we'll
[32:41] just go through these pictures not to
[32:43] take too much time. And this is all the
[32:45] church. the ceiling has fell in and and
[32:48] uh so if anybody I mean we're not
[32:51] campaigning for money but I personally
[32:53] am going there and I personally will
[32:55] help fix this. Amen. Brother Osman
[32:59] deserves a church uh building more than
[33:02] I do. Um that that's uh some of the
[33:06] believer's houses. So uh they're lacking
[33:09] roofs.
[33:12] This is another believer's house.
[33:13] believer's house that goes to Osman
[33:15] Bartley's church.
[33:18] That's another believer's house.
[33:22] And that's another believer's house.
[33:24] Everything's there but the roof. Amen.
[33:27] But God protected Pastor Osman
[33:30] &gt;&gt; tremendously. Amen. And his his own uh
[33:33] Amen. And we praise God for that. So
[33:35] Amen. Maybe we'll stand and just sing a
[33:38] song as our brother Ben comes. He's got
[33:41] it all in control. See?
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:43] [music] Amen. He's got it all in
[33:48] control.

[44:19] he's here.
[44:26] Praise be to God. [music]
[44:27] Good to be in the house of the Lord this
[44:29] morning. I'm so thankful for his mercy
[44:32] and his love to us. He's been so so very
[44:36] good to us. Now, I certainly enjoyed
[44:39] last night's service, and I trust it was
[44:41] a blessing to you. [applause]
[44:44] Praise the Lord. Nice to hear all those
[44:47] big amens after that hard preaching last
[44:50] night. I thought, well, Ben, Norod,
[44:53] you've done it again. And there'll
[44:54] probably be about four or five in the
[44:56] church this morning. Won't be a whole
[44:57] lot around. But, I I'm very thankful to
[44:59] the Lord that you u you you're tough
[45:01] Christians. You can take some good hard
[45:03] preaching. And I'm pretty thankful the
[45:04] Lord for that. So, you know, it's not
[45:07] everybody that can do it. [laughter]
[45:10] No, no, it's not everybody can do it.
[45:12] Some people, they just just almost faint
[45:14] right in the floor when you get a little
[45:15] tough on them. And, you know, and I I
[45:18] just was thankful. It's a a good message
[45:20] to preach for us. I thought it's a
[45:22] little bit of a tough thought that we
[45:24] have to kind of digest and really take
[45:25] into our heart and really give
[45:27] accountability for a lot of things. But,
[45:29] you know, this is kind of where we're
[45:30] at, folks. This is the hour we're living
[45:32] in and this is the time to get things
[45:35] straightened down, tightened up. And you
[45:37] know the old sailors used say batten
[45:39] down the hatches. Whatever those hatches
[45:41] are, we need to batten them down. Don't
[45:42] you think so? Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[45:45] so, uh, we just thank the Lord. And you,
[45:47] you can be seated for just a little bit
[45:48] if you want. I'm I'm going to sing to
[45:50] you a little bit before we preach. Uh,
[45:51] just want to say, uh, how much I
[45:54] appreciate the opportunity to be here as
[45:56] always. Brother Dale is, um, uh, he's
[45:59] just such a close, dear friend. And I I
[46:01] just so thank the Lord for him and his
[46:02] family and and um I was congratulating
[46:06] Amy back there, but I said, "I just got
[46:08] one question for you." She said, "What?"
[46:10] I said, "Where was my review of the
[46:12] resume?" And I wonder why Uncle Ben
[46:16] didn't get a chance to go over this
[46:17] whole matter before we [laughter]
[46:20] Amen. But anyways, he um I I'd like to
[46:23] meet you, brother, after service for
[46:24] sure. Wesley, was your name right, Wes?
[46:26] I asked Amy if she calls him Wesley when
[46:28] she's mad. I said, "Are you there yet?"
[46:30] And she said, "We are." Amen. So
[46:32] [laughter]
[46:33] I said, "Well, that's about right.
[46:34] That's marriage." You know, that's the
[46:36] way it goes. You know, my full name is
[46:38] Benjamin Jesse Norod. And I always knew
[46:40] when I was in trouble, my mom said,
[46:41] "Benjamin Jesse." And uh-oh. Right then,
[46:44] you knew you better back off. We walk it
[46:47] back, my son. You You went too far when
[46:49] you hear that called out. So we we thank
[46:52] the Lord. But uh what a privilege it is
[46:54] to be here. Thank you for your all your
[46:56] hospitality and uh all of your nice
[46:58] comments. And you know, I just there's
[47:01] something about you people here that has
[47:03] been so very special to me through the
[47:05] years. And uh you know, I just can't
[47:08] begin to express the love that I have
[47:10] for all of you and for brother Garcia
[47:13] and his nice wife, sister. My goodness,
[47:16] we we love these folks right here so
[47:18] much. [applause]
[47:21] me and um brother Jose, the Lord
[47:23] willing, we're going to El Salvador come
[47:25] the first weekend of December. He's uh
[47:28] he's going a little early and I'm going
[47:29] down. And I had I was telling the this
[47:31] morning a brother had heard cuz I've
[47:34] been asking people to pray of course
[47:35] going to the meeting and things and some
[47:37] brother called and um he he left me kind
[47:40] of a message get back with him. I said
[47:43] yes. He said I heard you're going to El
[47:45] Salvador. I said yes sir. He said who
[47:46] you going with? I said, "Well, I'm
[47:48] meeting the pastor and some of them down
[47:49] there." He said, "So, your wife is not
[47:51] going?" I said, "Not not originally. No,
[47:55] that wasn't in the plan." He said,
[47:56] "Well, she is now."
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And so,
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, [applause]
[48:02] [cheering]
[48:03] I received the finance right away and I
[48:06] was able to go and find the ticket and
[48:08] they put us on the same flight all the
[48:10] way up there and back. We're right next
[48:11] to each other all the way down there and
[48:13] back. [laughter]
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So I I was grateful to
[48:18] that. There was a prophecy given in the
[48:21] bed one night. We were laying there just
[48:23] kind of praying many many years ago.
[48:25] First moved to Tennessee. First couple
[48:27] years of I think we were there maybe oh
[48:29] I moved in May of 03 and I guess this
[48:32] was around sometime around ' 05. And we
[48:35] were laying in the bed just praying one
[48:36] night and all of a sudden the spirit of
[48:38] the Lord moved over me in prophecy and
[48:40] God spoke and said that he was going to
[48:42] take her gift, shake it before the world
[48:45] and that she would sing to the world.
[48:48] And do you know that that's happened
[48:50] just exactly like the Lord said it.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; I've been around the world at least one
[48:54] time and she's been halfway around it
[48:56] with me and I I just thank the Lord for
[48:58] that. So I think the Lord's got a
[49:00] blessing for those people in that music
[49:02] down there somehow. And so we're
[49:05] thankful for that. [applause] And I
[49:07] guess sister, are you going? Are you
[49:08] going with brother?
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, now see, that's an even
[49:11] double blessing, is it? Now you'll have
[49:13] sister down there with you. Well, that's
[49:14] [applause]
[49:15] that's fine. That's really really fine.
[49:17] I thank the Lord for that. So, it's just
[49:19] been a wonderful weekend. I can't
[49:21] explain it, but just the peace that I've
[49:24] felt within myself traveling. And I I
[49:27] don't know when I have felt as relaxed
[49:30] and at peace as I've felt making this
[49:33] trip out here this weekend. I don't know
[49:35] what you all prayed for me, but you keep
[49:36] praying that. I need that more
[49:38] [laughter] and more. I just been a I was
[49:41] up before daylight and just praying,
[49:43] talking to the Lord, and just so many
[49:44] wonderful things in prayer were
[49:46] happening and God just meet me right
[49:48] there. Different requests and different
[49:49] needs and oh, it's just been a wonderful
[49:52] day before the Lord. So, we're just
[49:54] thankful for it and and uh God helping
[49:56] us. And I I want to talk to you just a
[49:58] moment about Jamaica myself cuz I was at
[50:00] brother Bartley's and many of those
[50:01] saints down there. And I wrote brother
[50:04] Keith Reed and I asked Brother Keith if
[50:05] they're okay and he sent me a thumbs up
[50:07] that they're fine. So, we're thankful
[50:09] for that. Now, those people down there,
[50:11] let me tell you something. They need God
[50:14] to come down there and help them in the
[50:17] way of the gospel. So any missionary
[50:20] program you've got at all that has any
[50:21] worth to it at all, send it to Jamaica.
[50:23] They need it. Those ministers are
[50:25] crossing back and forth. And those
[50:27] brothers, they preach all the time and
[50:29] go and uh I was with one fell out there
[50:32] u old brother Lewis and he he he drove a
[50:34] car from the 80s. You know, Brother
[50:35] Lewis, I know you do. It broke down
[50:38] times trying to get over to brother um
[50:40] Black Eagle. Um
[50:42] it's Brother Brady. That's right. And
[50:44] and poor little old car. We get about
[50:46] halfway up and the brother jump out
[50:48] there and he, you know, and I'm sitting
[50:50] in there looking through the little
[50:51] crack in that hood over there and and
[50:53] all of a sudden I see fluid squirt like
[50:55] this around the side of it and the old
[50:57] fella go and he and I hear him holler.
[50:59] It's almost like a pilot holler contact
[51:01] and he go
[51:03] that thing just squeal. I just bowed my
[51:06] head and prayed. I thought well Lord I I
[51:09] guess I could walk it from here but I'd
[51:11] rather go in this car.
[51:13] It hadn't really backslid. It was just
[51:15] kind of laying down on God a little bit,
[51:16] I think. You know, it wasn't exactly as
[51:18] spiritual as it needed to be. I don't
[51:19] know if it was backslid yet, but uh but
[51:22] I was laughing about it because I
[51:23] thought, well, you know, here we sit in
[51:25] a modern convenience feeling
[51:27] inconvenient.
[51:29] And uh you know, I thought, well, shame
[51:31] on me for even thinking that away. So, I
[51:33] I don't know if this had anything to do
[51:34] it or not, but I sure put my head and
[51:36] prayed and I just bowed down. I said,
[51:38] Lord, just help them figure it out
[51:40] whatever's going on because this is for
[51:41] the gospel sake, not for our comfort.
[51:44] And just a few seconds after I said in
[51:46] Jesus name, amen, I heard it go wrong.
[51:48] And it went right on. So anyways, he's a
[51:52] pastor. He's a he's a he's a a great man
[51:54] of God. And those saints down there,
[51:56] they they need that support. They need
[51:58] that help. I mean, I'm not saying
[52:00] they're poor and outcasts. There's other
[52:02] places way yawn more poor than Jamaica.
[52:04] But they're doing a good work on that
[52:06] island. And I think God's with them. And
[52:08] um I got to laughing because there's a
[52:10] Manchester, Jamaica. And so I walked up
[52:14] to the platform that night and I said,
[52:15] "It's good to be home tonight."
[52:18] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Home? Home? Why home?
[52:20] This is Jamaica, not home." I said,
[52:21] "We're in Manchester, aren't we?" They
[52:23] said, "Yes." I said, "That's where I
[52:25] live is in Manchester."
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And they said, "No, Manchester,
[52:29] Jamaica." I said, "Oh, you don't mean
[52:31] Tennessee." I said, "With all these
[52:32] hills in this country out here, I
[52:34] thought for sure we was back home in
[52:35] Manchester, Tennessee." And so, oh, it
[52:38] was a just a wonderful time. And the
[52:39] Lord permitted I just wrote brother
[52:40] Keith matter of fact for all this come
[52:41] up this storm everything and I told him
[52:43] I've been burdened to go back and uh I
[52:46] don't know when or how maybe in the turn
[52:47] of the year and you know get a chance to
[52:49] set the the flight up I want to get back
[52:51] down there and preach to those precious
[52:52] people. There was um a situation there's
[52:55] a brother he was up on the mountain he
[52:57] was almost blinded with cataract and
[52:59] things and not not cataract but glaucoma
[53:02] it was do you remember the brother's
[53:04] name
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Ginger Hill? Yes sir. That's exactly
[53:07] where it was. Yes, that's the one.
[53:09] Brother Morris. We went up there and I
[53:12] was sitting in the room with Brother
[53:14] Morris and he said, I didn't know him,
[53:16] he didn't know me. And of course, we
[53:17] were just talking and fellowshipping and
[53:19] got about the time I guess service is
[53:20] going to start and he stopped and looked
[53:22] at me and I'm just giving this testimony
[53:24] for the glory of God.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; You know, cuz uh my going to Jamaica
[53:28] came to me in a dream. I was actually in
[53:31] Chadam at that little house that Curtis
[53:33] had there on the side of his home. I
[53:34] stay in that little parsonage there.
[53:36] they had or they made it to parsonage.
[53:37] And in that dream, I had just come back
[53:40] from I I guess I would been in Europe
[53:43] for a couple days. I've been in Belgium
[53:45] and uh France and England preaching
[53:47] revivals and uh meetings there. And I
[53:50] come right back off the plane, went
[53:51] straight to Ontario. And I was staying
[53:53] out there and in this dream, I was
[53:56] trying in the airport, I was trying to
[53:57] get to Jamaica as hard as I could go.
[53:59] Every outlet, every turn, every exit and
[54:02] I kept going around Jamaica, Jamaica,
[54:04] Jamaica. Where's Jamaica? How do I get
[54:05] to Jamaica? Jamaica. And I woke up from
[54:07] that and I thought, Lord, do you want me
[54:09] to go to Jamaica? [laughter]
[54:11] I thought, well, I don't even know
[54:13] exactly how I'd get there. I don't know
[54:14] anybody. And do you know within about 30
[54:16] minutes, there was a brother called me
[54:18] and he said, "Brother Ben, I want to ask
[54:20] you a question." I said, "Yes, sir. Have
[54:22] you ever thought about going to
[54:23] Jamaica?"
[54:27] [applause]
[54:27] I said
[54:31] I said, "Yes, sir. It's crossed my mind
[54:32] a time or two.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[54:35] &gt;&gt; And so he um so he he arranged the the
[54:38] trip for us to get down there and
[54:39] connected with brother Keith and some of
[54:41] the brothers and they arranged the
[54:42] meeting for us to go. And I was sitting
[54:44] with brother Morris on Ginger Hill up
[54:45] there. And uh Brother Lewis had packed
[54:47] me all the way up the top there. And we
[54:48] were sitting back in one of these rooms
[54:50] around the corner of the church light.
[54:51] And he just I noticed when he was
[54:53] talking to me, he kept looking above my
[54:54] head like that and trail his eyes. And
[54:56] he looked back at me and he looked up
[54:58] and he'd trail his eyes. And every few
[54:59] minutes he was doing that like that. And
[55:01] we talked and talked just about normal
[55:03] things and this and that. And he said,
[55:05] "Well, brother Ben, I'm going to let you
[55:06] go." And he said, "I know that God has
[55:08] sent you here." He said, "Because all
[55:10] the time we've been sitting here
[55:12] fellowshipping about 10 or 15 minutes."
[55:14] He said, "The pillar of fire just keeps
[55:15] going back over your head like this over
[55:16] and back and forth." He said, "I know
[55:18] that you're God's servant. You've been
[55:20] sent to us." Do you know that night
[55:22] there had been some representatives from
[55:24] VGR that had come in for with the sole
[55:27] purpose of making Brother Joseph Brandom
[55:29] an eighth day prophet telling him to
[55:31] quit preaching to play nothing but tapes
[55:34] and to quit allto together believing in
[55:37] any other kind of thing except for
[55:38] return ministry and a few things and the
[55:40] Holy Ghost put it I didn't even know it
[55:42] until I was done preaching two hours I
[55:45] laid into that thing about how you've
[55:47] got to go to church and brother Brandham
[55:49] didn't believe things like that and
[55:51] that's not what the Bible teaches us.
[55:53] [applause]
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[55:57] And when I got done, some of these
[55:58] people run over to me and said, "You
[56:00] don't know what's been happening here,
[56:01] do you?" I said, "No, I really don't."
[56:04] Evidently, they've been just assaulted
[56:05] for two straight weeks, these men coming
[56:07] in doing those things. Now, I'm not
[56:09] casting any aspersions on Brother Joseph
[56:11] for the VGR, but there are people in
[56:13] every organization and in every group
[56:15] and every, you know, circle or whatever
[56:17] you want to call them that'll do these
[56:19] kind of things. And they're just they're
[56:21] just troublemakers and they should be
[56:22] weeded out all together and made to
[56:25] repent for the evil things they're doing
[56:27] in the name of this message
[56:29] &gt;&gt; and in the name of the prophet.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Those things ought not be. Christians go
[56:34] to church. We believe in five-fold
[56:36] ministry. And I I have no problem with
[56:39] brother Joseph being a prophet. There's
[56:41] many prophets in the New Testament. But
[56:44] every prophet must acknowledge God's
[56:47] star of the age. And there's only one
[56:50] star and that one star was William Marry
[56:53] and Brandon. Let all apostles,
[56:56] prophets,
[56:58] evangelists,
[57:00] let them acknowledge what he wrote and
[57:02] said was the commandment of the Lord.
[57:05] Oh, you say that's strong. No. But he
[57:07] said, I preach what Paul preached. And
[57:09] he was the seventh angel to reveal the
[57:11] book of Revelation to us. We have no
[57:13] problem believing that. I have no
[57:15] problem with there being other prophets
[57:16] on the earth. No sir,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; not at all. No, sir, I don't. Because in
[57:20] the book of Acts alone, there are 13
[57:22] recorded in the book of Acts alone.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; So, we don't have problems with that.
[57:27] God sent prophets to this generation,
[57:30] but there's only one star to God's age.
[57:32] One voice. And all of us have to say
[57:34] what that voice says. Amen. So, we thank
[57:38] the Lord. And the Lord does I could just
[57:40] talk to you all afternoon about it. I
[57:41] mean, he done so many things down there.
[57:42] And I I'd like to go again if the Lord
[57:45] help us. And so pray with me, will you
[57:47] about those things and pray for us with
[57:49] Honduras coming and then uh excuse me uh
[57:51] El Salvador, I mean to say and u and
[57:54] pray for us with um uh with that burden.
[57:56] And uh there's some little transitioning
[58:00] things ministry-wise happening for me.
[58:02] I'm not exactly sure what's going to be
[58:04] or how it's going to work, but uh I've
[58:05] got several little things that's coming
[58:07] on, new things that I'm going to try to
[58:09] see what the Lord will say about it. And
[58:11] I I I won't say too much about it out
[58:13] loud because I don't exactly know the
[58:15] directions or how it's but you just pray
[58:17] for me. The Lord help me give me some
[58:19] wisdom about some things. Uh I haven't
[58:21] been able to travel for a couple years.
[58:23] I tried with brother Dale one year and
[58:26] uh you know they gave me trouble with
[58:28] the visa and I I didn't I couldn't
[58:30] hardly get there and I ended up not end
[58:31] up being not not able to go at all. And
[58:33] I I I'm ashamed to have to say that that
[58:35] didn't work out like that. Brother Lane
[58:37] staff was so nice. He helped me with the
[58:39] ticket and everything. And I still got
[58:41] that money. Little fool. I'm going to
[58:42] use it one of these days, the Lord
[58:44] willing. Uh, but my my health after that
[58:47] hit I took with CO, my health wasn't
[58:49] good.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm an alpha. I'm stubborn. I'm
[58:52] proud. And I don't like to admit when
[58:54] I've been kicked and I'm down. But I had
[58:57] to finally just kind of say, you know
[58:58] what? I'm not well. So, I've taken a
[59:00] couple years and I've really been
[59:02] working on things. And I'm so happy to
[59:05] testify that God has just completely
[59:08] restored me all together. [applause]
[59:12] I'm so thankful to the Lord.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; I had what they call long COVID. You
[59:18] know, I had blood pressure problems and
[59:19] you name it and all that kind of stuff.
[59:21] But the Lord has been gracious to me.
[59:23] The lady gave me an examination the
[59:25] other day. She said, "Your lungs are
[59:26] perfect. Your kidneys are perfect. Your
[59:28] liver is perfect."
[59:31] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [laughter]
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm so grateful to the Lord for it.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, with all that said, we love
[59:41] you. God bless you. Thank you for your
[59:43] nice participation and support of this
[59:45] meeting this weekend. And uh you know, I
[59:48] I hope y'all know that I don't put on
[59:49] this ain't just me acting like a
[59:51] preacher. I genuinely love you.
[59:53] [laughter]
[59:54] I really do. And I I thank the Lord for
[59:56] the opportunity to get to shake your
[59:57] hand and talk to you and you know and
[1:00:00] and uh sometimes you know when you get
[1:00:02] in a crowd like this it's hard to grab
[1:00:04] everybody but you you just know that if
[1:00:06] I saw you across the room brother or
[1:00:07] sister don't matter I wanted to say hi
[1:00:09] to you or shake your hand or God bless
[1:00:11] you some way. [applause] So we thank the
[1:00:14] Lord and u at that point now I'm going
[1:00:18] to go over here to this pen and sing a
[1:00:19] little bit and then we're going to get
[1:00:21] right into the preaching of the word of
[1:00:22] the Lord. Are you looking forward to
[1:00:23] what the Lord's going to say this
[1:00:24] morning?
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering]
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Me too, folks. Too
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; the Lord.

[1:06:41] of such
[1:06:43] mercy. [music]
[1:06:46] [singing]
[1:06:47] When he was on [music] the cross that
[1:06:53] day,
[1:06:54] I was [music] on
[1:06:58] his mind.
[1:07:01] [music]
[1:07:02] And [singing] the look of love was on
[1:07:07] his face.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; The thorns were on [singing]
[1:07:12] his head.
[1:07:14] The blood that ran down that scared
[1:07:19] [singing] roll. [music]
[1:07:21] It cr
[1:07:26] all his eyes were on the ground that
[1:07:31] day.
[1:07:33] He looked ahead [screaming]
[1:07:35] in time.
[1:07:38] When he was on the cross that day,
[1:07:43] [music]
[1:07:44] I I was on

[1:09:29] When I need someone

[1:11:07] He's [music]
[1:11:08] all
[1:11:12] I need.
[1:11:15] [music]
[1:11:17] He's all I need. I want you to listen
[1:11:20] this morning.
[1:11:22] I dare not turn to
[1:11:26] any other.
[1:11:29] Some of you need to hear this next line.
[1:11:31] For he's [singing]
[1:11:32] a friend. [music]
[1:11:35] A friend that's closer [singing] than
[1:11:40] any brother [music]
[1:11:46] and this friend.
[1:11:49] I can't rely
[1:11:52] to be my strength
[1:11:56] as life goes by. He
[1:12:00] [music] is the Lord of all. Remember the
[1:12:02] Jose and he's all remember the name. I
[1:12:08] need [music]
[1:12:12] comfort
[1:12:14] me
[1:12:16] when I'm weary.
[1:12:19] I'm going to tell you something. [music]
[1:12:21] They told me because of the way CO hit
[1:12:23] me, I'd never be able to hold long notes
[1:12:25] or sing like this anymore. So, I'm just
[1:12:27] going to go ahead and let you know I'm
[1:12:28] about to kick the devil in the mouth for
[1:12:30] a little bit. He comforts [singing] me
[1:12:33] [music]
[1:12:34] when I'm weary
[1:12:37] and hees
[1:12:40] every pain. [music and singing]
[1:12:43] Listen. Fills
[1:12:46] my deepest longings.
[1:12:50] Time and time
[1:12:54] and time again.
[1:13:07] He's [music] my soul
[1:13:11] inspiration.
[1:13:14] My heart [music]
[1:13:21] is [music and singing]
[1:13:22] my everything.
[1:13:31] [music]
[1:13:34] mercy
[1:13:37] when [music]
[1:13:38] I'm weary
[1:13:40] and [singing] he eases
[1:13:44] everything. [music]
[1:13:47] Oh yes, he fills
[1:13:50] my deepest longings. [music and singing]
[1:13:55] Time and time and time again.
[1:14:00] [music] Is [singing] my soul
[1:14:04] inspiration
[1:14:06] [music]
[1:14:07] my [singing] heart
[1:14:10] consolation.
[1:14:13] He's my everything. [music] Thank you,
[1:14:17] Lord. He's [singing] all
[1:14:21] [music]
[1:14:22] I need. [singing]
[1:14:26] As you get your Bible, stand with me.
[1:14:28] He's all
[1:14:32] I need.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; He's all
[1:14:39] I need.
[1:14:41] 1 Thessalonians 4, Jesus
[1:14:46] is all [singing]
[1:14:49] I need.
[1:14:52] Sing it. Sing it now. He all
[1:14:58] I need.
[1:15:02] He all
[1:15:05] I need. [singing]
[1:15:10] Jesus
[1:15:12] is all
[1:15:15] I need.
[1:15:19] One time heers
[1:15:24] prayer.
[1:15:26] He [singing]
[1:15:28] answers
[1:15:30] prayer.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus
[1:15:36] is all
[1:15:39] I need.
[1:15:44] He answers
[1:15:47] prayer. How many believes he does? He
[1:15:51] answers
[1:15:54] prayer. [singing]
[1:15:57] Jesus
[1:16:00] is all
[1:16:02] I need. [singing]
[1:16:07] Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [applause]
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. For the Lord himself
[1:16:19] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[1:16:22] with the voice of the archangel, and
[1:16:26] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[1:16:29] Christ shall rise first. Then we which
[1:16:33] are alive and remain shall be caught up.
[1:16:40] This word means to seize suddenly, to
[1:16:43] snatch away by force,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; or to rescue eagerly. This is not known
[1:16:49] as much of a violent act, but rather a
[1:16:52] lover's pull.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Third pull to be honest with you.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; To be clear, the same word is used in
[1:17:00] Jude verse 23 is saving others, pulling
[1:17:03] them out of the fire. Harpadozo caught
[1:17:07] up together with them in the clouds to
[1:17:11] meet the Lord in the air. And so shall
[1:17:14] we ever be with the Lord. I want to read
[1:17:17] to you now from the rapture message.
[1:17:19] Brother Beam said, "But to the church,
[1:17:21] the bride, the rapture will be a
[1:17:24] revelation to her." Yes. Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; It's revealed to her
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; that the revelation, the true bride of
[1:17:32] Christ
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; will be waiting for that revelation
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; of the rapture. That's right.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you this morning on
[1:17:42] the reason for the rapture.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[1:17:48] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, Lord
[1:17:50] Jesus,
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; for the presence that we feel in this
[1:17:53] place.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We know that it is nothing
[1:17:56] more and nothing less than the presence
[1:17:57] of almighty God. And
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Father, we look to you this morning to
[1:18:02] come by your word,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; not only to anoint me and to anoint
[1:18:06] them,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; but to open our hearts that we might
[1:18:09] speak and receive that which you want to
[1:18:11] give to us, Lord.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; We pray, Father, that your word will be
[1:18:17] broken to us like the bread of life. And
[1:18:19] may we as your hungry little eagles open
[1:18:22] up our mouths to receive today what the
[1:18:25] engrafted word would want us to have. We
[1:18:28] commit this service both speaker and
[1:18:30] listener in Jesus Christ's name. And all
[1:18:33] the saints said, "Amen."
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May the Lord bless
[1:18:37] you.
[1:18:38] The rapture is um a beautiful subject
[1:18:41] and as honestly as I can express it to
[1:18:44] you, I don't think I'd ever be able to
[1:18:46] get it done in this particular service.
[1:18:48] If I had 10 in a row, I don't think I
[1:18:51] could get it done. There's so much in
[1:18:52] it. And um but it's um a vital subject
[1:18:56] for us because of the time we're living
[1:18:58] in, the hour living in. We need to make
[1:19:01] sure that we're ready for the coming of
[1:19:03] the Lord Jesus. And you know, you hear
[1:19:06] so much preached about it at times. You
[1:19:08] hear folks talking about the rapture,
[1:19:10] rapture this, rapture whatever. And um
[1:19:13] you know, it's almost kind of like we I
[1:19:17] I know this going to sound a little rude
[1:19:18] in a way, but it's almost like we just
[1:19:20] blow it off like we don't even care that
[1:19:22] it's coming.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; We know why that is. Is because Jesus
[1:19:25] told us that before the coming of the
[1:19:27] Lord or the second portion or this
[1:19:29] portion we're waiting on now, that there
[1:19:31] would be a time of delay. Yeah.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And in that time of delay, that's where
[1:19:35] people would have a tendency to kind of
[1:19:37] uh look to the left and the right. And
[1:19:39] if you study it closely, their attitudes
[1:19:42] begin to change. They start smiting
[1:19:44] God's fellow servants and the uh the men
[1:19:46] of God and the people of God and so
[1:19:48] forth like that. And so the delay is a
[1:19:51] hard time for people. And of course,
[1:19:53] they had the same thing at the first
[1:19:55] advent of the coming of the Lord. There
[1:19:56] was a delay between the voice of Malachi
[1:19:59] and the coming of John the Baptist. And
[1:20:01] by the time that Jesus arrived, the
[1:20:03] prophet said there were only six
[1:20:06] believers in the Ladyan, what he called
[1:20:08] the Ladyan Old Testament church age. And
[1:20:12] during that time, that little handful
[1:20:14] that held on, Simeon and Anna and some
[1:20:16] of them like that, they were looking for
[1:20:18] the coming of the Lord. And they knew
[1:20:20] that God would come, maybe perhaps not
[1:20:23] in their generation, but they knew he
[1:20:24] would come according to prophecy. and
[1:20:26] they were making their hearts ready at
[1:20:28] any moment that the Messiah might show
[1:20:31] up. And one of my favorite passages and
[1:20:34] you know if I could have chose some
[1:20:35] places to be in life and you know if I
[1:20:37] was a time traveler you know what I'm
[1:20:39] talking about if I could get in a little
[1:20:40] egg or a buggy or a machine or some kind
[1:20:42] of thing and push a button and go
[1:20:44] somewhere. I would have loved to been
[1:20:46] standing there that day in the temple
[1:20:47] when they brought Jesus in to be
[1:20:49] circumcised on the eighth day and watch
[1:20:51] old Simeon pick him up and say let the
[1:20:54] Lord servant depart in peace for I've
[1:20:57] seen God's Christ on the scene. I I
[1:20:59] would have loved to seen that. I would
[1:21:01] have loved to seen the look, amen, on
[1:21:03] John Baptist's face when he was standing
[1:21:05] there on the riverbank. Amen. This man
[1:21:07] that was a cousin according to the
[1:21:09] natural way of life. Amen. As far as
[1:21:11] they were concerned, Amen. And come by
[1:21:13] the family way of being a cousin. Amen.
[1:21:16] And then let him stand there on that
[1:21:17] bank. Amen. And look over and see the
[1:21:19] pillar of fire above Jesus and that
[1:21:22] revelation striking. Behold the lamb of
[1:21:24] God that takes away the sins of the
[1:21:26] world. I would have loved to been there
[1:21:28] to see that. Amen. But we know that
[1:21:31] people in the message of that day
[1:21:33] because that's what they were following
[1:21:35] had come to such a a place that there
[1:21:39] was a a rudeness about them when it came
[1:21:41] to the truth. As I said yesterday, Amen.
[1:21:44] The people had so lost their love for
[1:21:47] the things of God until they weaponized
[1:21:50] weaponized rather the message of that
[1:21:52] day. Amen. They didn't take the quotes
[1:21:54] and the scriptures and the things that
[1:21:56] have been given to them from all the
[1:21:57] prophets and things and try to weave
[1:21:59] them together to make the people come
[1:22:01] closer to God, but rather it became a
[1:22:04] tool or a weapon or a device for them to
[1:22:07] call men unto themselves for the call
[1:22:10] the people and subjugate them to
[1:22:12] themselves until Jesus said, "Woe unto
[1:22:14] you lawyers," which was an interpreter
[1:22:16] of the word that day. He said, "Because
[1:22:18] you stand right in the door and will not
[1:22:21] allow them to pass through into eternal
[1:22:23] life." These men were the custodians of
[1:22:26] the message of the hour. But because
[1:22:28] they had an evil heart and an evil
[1:22:30] spirit and because they had lost all the
[1:22:32] love that a person could have for the
[1:22:34] word of God. Amen. But you say that only
[1:22:36] come in the New Testament. No, no, no.
[1:22:38] One of the first things that Jesus said
[1:22:40] in the commandments, he referred back to
[1:22:42] Moses when he talked to the rich young
[1:22:44] ruler. You know the commandments and
[1:22:45] things. Love the Lord thy God with all
[1:22:48] thy heart, thy strength, thy soul, thy
[1:22:50] mind, thy spirit, and thy purpose. Amen.
[1:22:53] In other words, the love for Almighty
[1:22:55] God was present then, it's present
[1:22:57] today.
[1:22:59] [applause]
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the big differences between
[1:23:01] us as believers and the rest of the
[1:23:03] organizations, denominations, and
[1:23:05] everything else is that we know who we
[1:23:08] love.
[1:23:09] Yeah, [applause]
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; the word, the message of the hour has
[1:23:12] revealed to us the true nature of Jesus
[1:23:15] Christ, his personality, what kind of
[1:23:18] person he is, and who he is by God's
[1:23:21] prophecy and promise of the last day.
[1:23:23] Amen. Stay with me a little while. Amen.
[1:23:25] The delay brings about, Amen. the uh uh
[1:23:29] expression or the manifestation, if you
[1:23:31] will, of every unbeliever. But so does
[1:23:35] it bring the believer, amen, into their
[1:23:38] apex and into their zenith of believing
[1:23:40] Christ.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Listen to me carefully and don't fail
[1:23:45] this. We do not become what we become
[1:23:48] when everything is positive.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; We will never express perfect
[1:23:57] [screaming] love
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; unless there's perfect hatred all around
[1:24:02] us. Yeah. [applause]
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "But brother Ben, we can
[1:24:08] express it at any time." That's true.
[1:24:10] But the darker it gets, the brighter the
[1:24:13] light can shine.
[1:24:16] [applause]
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And brother, [screaming] there will be a
[1:24:18] body on this earth that will overcome
[1:24:22] hatred and everything the devil has to
[1:24:24] offer.
[1:24:26] And by the grace of God, we will express
[1:24:29] [screaming] perfect love.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; In an age of perfect hatred,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; people don't trust. They don't have
[1:24:37] confidence. Even church people don't
[1:24:40] feel they can trust one another.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; They spend a lot of time mistrusting one
[1:24:47] another.
[1:24:49] How could we ever see God move in a
[1:24:52] united body when we stay so divided in
[1:24:55] our hearts?
[1:24:57] [applause]
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; I said, "Wait a minute, preacher. I
[1:25:00] thought you were going to talk about
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I am."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; You'll see in just a moment how this all
[1:25:08] works into what we're getting at.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; You know, and the rapture for a lot of
[1:25:13] people is just an event. I want you to
[1:25:16] notice that a lot of folks would believe
[1:25:18] the rapture to them is just an escape
[1:25:20] from bad.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; To them, it's like a fire escape.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; I'll live in my house or the be work in
[1:25:28] this building and do anything I want to
[1:25:29] do and live anyway I want to live and
[1:25:31] well if I get in some trouble there's a
[1:25:33] fire escape and I can run out of here.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not a fire escape and neither
[1:25:39] is the rapture.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Y'all get so quiet for I got something
[1:25:43] on my face. Oh, it's these band-aids
[1:25:45] holding my mic still. Oh, I see what
[1:25:47] you're see looking at.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; That must have been what surprised you
[1:25:49] so much. I It couldn't have been what I
[1:25:51] preached. Surely it couldn't have been
[1:25:52] what I preached.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ben, there's nobody
[1:25:56] like that." You would be absolutely
[1:25:58] shocked.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; How many people in this message only
[1:26:03] want the goodness of God if it means
[1:26:06] escaping hell?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Brother, let me [screaming] go on
[1:26:10] record. I don't serve him or love him
[1:26:12] because I want to escape hell.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, if his will would
[1:26:17] be for me to go to hell.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; If that's what he wants for me, that's
[1:26:21] what I want. [applause]
[1:26:26] [cheering]
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not there yet, but that
[1:26:28] goes to prove your love needs to mature.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Because when you fall in love with
[1:26:33] Christ in the right way, you're not
[1:26:34] looking for what you want.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; You're looking for what he wants.
[1:26:39] I'll agree with you. The real elect of
[1:26:41] God cannot be sent to hell. That's true.
[1:26:43] But if a man or a woman that really
[1:26:45] loves Jesus thought for a moment
[1:26:46] [screaming] that it would please God to
[1:26:48] not let them be a part of the bride. If
[1:26:50] they really loved him right, they would
[1:26:52] say, "Father, not my will but thine."
[1:26:56] Lord, [applause]
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, somebody.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; That is the nature of the true elected.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Woo! Somebody don't like that.
[1:27:08] Well, I'm so sorry. You're just going to
[1:27:10] have to tough it out cuz here we are.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Well, but I want to be bride. I want to
[1:27:14] [screaming] be elect. You can't make
[1:27:16] yourself that.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; That comes by God's choosing and God's
[1:27:19] election.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You cannot make
[1:27:23] yourself. You can't pray yourself into
[1:27:25] bride.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; There will be many categories of people
[1:27:29] that will even live outside the city and
[1:27:31] be saved people that were never bride.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:27:36] [cheering]
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Gar and I was talking last night
[1:27:38] about St. John 3:16 and talking about
[1:27:40] God so loved the whole world. And this
[1:27:42] is what the prophet said. God projected
[1:27:44] his love to everyone. His love has been
[1:27:46] projected to the whole wide world. But
[1:27:49] election comes in in in accordance with
[1:27:52] the will of God. His love will not allow
[1:27:55] him to contradict his own word. So if
[1:27:58] his love would allow him to contradict
[1:27:59] his word, what kind of love you got?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; You could live any way you want. drink
[1:28:04] and smoke and cuss and lie and cheat and
[1:28:06] everything else in the world. Well, God
[1:28:08] loves me.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; He sure does.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; That's why when you do such things,
[1:28:13] he'll burn you up when you come to
[1:28:14] church. [applause]
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory to God.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz he loves us
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; and he wants us to be right.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. I heard
[1:28:28] brother Bon say it just the other day.
[1:28:29] He said talking about drinking whiskey
[1:28:31] and things like that. He said that if a
[1:28:33] person wants to drink like that, there's
[1:28:35] a toxin in there that blanks out their
[1:28:37] mind. And I'd never heard Brother Ben
[1:28:39] say this before till the other day. He
[1:28:40] said, "My goodness, if you had a
[1:28:42] sickness," he said, "that was blanking
[1:28:44] out your mind, you would run everywhere
[1:28:46] you could looking for a doctor to help
[1:28:48] you figure out how not to have a blank
[1:28:50] mind." He said, "And yet people will go
[1:28:52] out [screaming] and buy it by the barrel
[1:28:53] loads."
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; It goes to prove that Satan has moved on
[1:28:58] this generation.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. until well they feel they can
[1:29:01] do anything they want. And most of these
[1:29:03] organizations will preach, don't worry
[1:29:05] about it. God loves you.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; He may love you and he may project his
[1:29:12] love to you.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; But if he doesn't correct you or if you
[1:29:16] don't correction,
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; you cannot find proof of the love of
[1:29:20] God.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; His proof that he loves me is that he
[1:29:26] corrects me.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:29:30] I'm not just here as a Christian by
[1:29:32] happen stance. I am here by the
[1:29:34] corrective and the guiding hand of
[1:29:36] Jehovah God.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I am living [screaming] as I live
[1:29:40] because he loves me enough to tell me
[1:29:43] the truth.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And one thing is for certain, as you'll
[1:29:50] see in a few moments, if you want to
[1:29:53] make the rapture, if you want to go on
[1:29:55] the resurrection, there's a certain life
[1:29:58] that you're going to have to live
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; in order to get out of here.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:30:06] insert amen here.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; A lot of [screaming] people think, I'm
[1:30:13] going to make the rapture cuz mama's got
[1:30:14] the token on me because I love Brother
[1:30:16] Bradom. You will not make the rapture in
[1:30:18] those conditions.
[1:30:20] [applause]
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; The rapture is only for the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] filled.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Now, don't split hairs with me. I'm
[1:30:28] talking about real born again.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about people with gifts
[1:30:32] and feel the Holy Ghost. I'm talking
[1:30:33] about the absolute [screaming] authentic
[1:30:36] baptized changed from the [laughter]
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I get to talk in that way and I want to
[1:30:41] shout, not preach. Hallelujah to God.
[1:30:44] Amen. That's [screaming] who I am.
[1:30:46] Change that St. Paul sky blue sinkilling
[1:30:50] devil chasing. That's what I got in my
[1:30:52] [screaming] heart this morning.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have it when Jesus
[1:31:00] comes, you will be left here.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe the you will be left here.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe the pro you will be left
[1:31:09] here.
[1:31:14] Let's go into this a little bit, can we?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Now, we realize that the pattern of
[1:31:21] this, look at it again. First
[1:31:22] Thessalonians 4. The Lord himself should
[1:31:24] descend with from heaven with a shout.
[1:31:26] That's a message.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; The voice of the archangel is the voice
[1:31:30] of God.
[1:31:32] That voice will be in the bride.
[1:31:36] I know I about shock some of you
[1:31:37] Canadians to death until you
[1:31:40] some some of you almost take a deeper
[1:31:42] breath when I say this. I knock the wind
[1:31:44] out of you. But I believe it to be the
[1:31:46] truth. I believe the bride of Jesus
[1:31:48] Christ when the time comes for change. I
[1:31:51] believe the real elect of God will be
[1:31:53] able to speak her own body change.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; I don't think it's just going to be some
[1:32:00] great planes falling out of the air and
[1:32:02] trains derailing. That's denominational
[1:32:05] dogma.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; The rapture and the coming of the Lord
[1:32:09] will be a total [screaming]
[1:32:11] secret.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Only those that with a trained heart
[1:32:17] will know him when he comes. Oh, glory.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Now, watch the pattern of this. And the
[1:32:25] dead in Christ [screaming]
[1:32:26] shall rise
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; first
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; first.
[1:32:32] Then [screaming] we were to alive and
[1:32:35] remain.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; So look at the pattern of it. The dead
[1:32:39] will rise first. So Jesus as he leaves
[1:32:41] that seventh dimension and comes and
[1:32:43] sweeps through the sixth dimension will
[1:32:45] gather up all the saints of each age.
[1:32:48] This is where those elect told brother
[1:32:49] Ramy beyond the curtain of time that
[1:32:51] Jesus comes, he will come to you first.
[1:32:53] That's right. He will descend from the
[1:32:55] seventh dimension down into that sixth
[1:32:57] dimension rolling fields of blue grass.
[1:32:59] And he will go to each leader of each
[1:33:01] age and say, "Collect your group. It's
[1:33:04] time to go back." Now remember, he does
[1:33:06] not meet upon the earth. We don't meet
[1:33:08] Jesus on the earth yet, but we meet him
[1:33:10] somewhere between his home and somewhere
[1:33:13] between our home, which is in the air.
[1:33:15] We're translated up into that dimension
[1:33:18] where we will meet the saints of God for
[1:33:20] 3 and 1/2 years of the wedding supper.
[1:33:26] You know why brother Brandham said we
[1:33:27] meet each other first?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said when that hour arrives,
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; he wants you to make sure you knew who
[1:33:34] made it and who didn't.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Said that
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; cuz you couldn't enjoy Jesus if you were
[1:33:41] sitting around wondering if mama made it
[1:33:42] or daddy made it or whoever didn't make
[1:33:44] it.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; But you'll be able to gather and shake
[1:33:47] hands with the saints of God. Now
[1:33:49] whether you believe it's a natural table
[1:33:50] and we're all going to be catered by the
[1:33:52] angels, fried chicken and and ters and
[1:33:55] maiders and whatever you believe about
[1:33:56] it doesn't matter. It is three and a
[1:33:58] half years of a gathering place with the
[1:34:01] saints of God. And at the end of that,
[1:34:03] Jesus comes back for the third part of
[1:34:05] his coming on white horses to the battle
[1:34:08] of Armageddon to deal with all of those
[1:34:10] sinners, those denominations, and those
[1:34:12] things that will go down in the battle
[1:34:14] of Armageddon.
[1:34:18] But on this side of the rapture, it's a
[1:34:21] secret.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz the rapture itself, reason number
[1:34:29] one,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; the rapture is about a uniting.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Don't misunderstand what I'm getting
[1:34:38] ready to say, but as far as the rapture
[1:34:41] goes, I'm already in it.
[1:34:44] Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "Now, wait a minute, brother
[1:34:49] Ben. You're still in that [screaming]
[1:34:50] old body." I didn't say it wasn't.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; The saints are still here. Didn't say
[1:34:55] they weren't.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; But the problem is, you think the
[1:34:59] rapture is a one-time event.
[1:35:03] [cheering and applause]
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; It is not. The very moment a believer
[1:35:08] receives the Holy Ghost, [screaming]
[1:35:10] they are
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; caught up.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Did not the Apostle Paul say, "We have
[1:35:17] been risen to heavenly places in Christ
[1:35:20] Jesus." [screaming]
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; What is that? Rapturing revelation,
[1:35:24] rapturing power, rapturing faith taking
[1:35:27] us out. [applause]
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It's a process. [screaming]
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And yes, it's going to take time. my
[1:35:35] body to catch up with the final moment
[1:35:37] of the rapture.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; But I'm already in it.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; I just heard brother Bon say on Who's
[1:35:45] this Melzdic a few weeks ago. He said if
[1:35:47] you are here in the air,
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; if you are here in the air, he said you
[1:35:52] take this body [screaming] to meet the
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; theophony.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Well, how can I be in the air already if
[1:35:58] I'm not already in the air?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:04] Only the born again know what I'm truly
[1:36:07] talking about.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; The rest of the world has no idea what's
[1:36:11] taking place.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It's a secret.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's an invisible union between you
[1:36:17] and Jesus.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz you see, this union is the
[1:36:21] revelation of the rapture.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Your love affair with Christ. Hey,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; brother Dale and I was fellowshipping
[1:36:29] last night a little bit and we got done
[1:36:31] with everything and he was saying, you
[1:36:32] know, you can't miss the relationship. I
[1:36:34] said, "Oh, that's right." He said, "The
[1:36:36] relationship is everything." Yes, sir. I
[1:36:39] just kept quiet cuz he didn't know what
[1:36:40] I had in my notes this morning. I didn't
[1:36:42] want to let the kitty out of the bag too
[1:36:43] much. But, oh, how true it is.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; The real reason for the rapture is not
[1:36:50] so I can escape Satan's Eden.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:36:55] My real reason for the rapture is
[1:36:58] because I can finally unite fully fully
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; with my bridegroom, the Lord Jesus
[1:37:04] Christ. [laughter]
[1:37:06] [applause and cheering]
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Friends, do you understand that if
[1:37:10] heaven was nothing more than an old
[1:37:12] tinge shack?
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; If Jesus was there, that's what make it
[1:37:16] with heaven. Make it heaven for me.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; I don't need gates of pearl and streets
[1:37:20] of gold and I don't need all that. And
[1:37:22] if he wants to give it to me, amen and
[1:37:23] hallelujah, and so be it. But if it was
[1:37:25] nothing more than a mudill on the side
[1:37:27] of the road,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; as long as Jesus is there, that's all I
[1:37:31] care about.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz he is what makes this worthwhile
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; as far as preaching goes. Think about a
[1:37:41] man getting up here and preaching and no
[1:37:42] Holy Ghost, no anointing.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; You know what makes preaching so
[1:37:46] enjoyable for me? This part of it right
[1:37:48] here is because I get to fellowship with
[1:37:50] him so deeply when I get to preach.
[1:37:52] [applause and cheering]
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz he comes in such a special way when
[1:37:56] he's dealing with the people. And I love
[1:37:58] this part of it. All the other stuff of
[1:37:59] preaching. You can have it. But this is
[1:38:01] I like
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; being under his anointing and his
[1:38:05] [screaming] presence. And think about it
[1:38:07] one of these days. We're going to live
[1:38:09] in it and never leave it. Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And if you're not in love with him, then
[1:38:17] you have no reason for rapture.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; If your only reason is because well, you
[1:38:24] think it's a good part of Christianity.
[1:38:27] Oh, it's something to do.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; It's not that at all. It is the
[1:38:32] completeness of the union between the
[1:38:35] bride and Christ. Also, it is the
[1:38:37] finishing of all redemption.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Right? Remember,
[1:38:42] redemption is not completed completed
[1:38:45] until your body is changed.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; You've got the earnest. Now, you've got
[1:38:51] a little portion of God down inside of
[1:38:53] your heart. You got what the prophet
[1:38:54] called a down payment.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Mercy me.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Woo. If the down payment makes me feel
[1:39:00] this way, what do you think the whole
[1:39:01] thing's going to look like? [laughter]
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; brother. is going to be beyond anything
[1:39:07] we could ever imagine or think.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's a truth.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; The rapture is for a ready bride.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Notice in Revelations 19, it said, "The
[1:39:20] bride hath made herself ready." Did you
[1:39:22] notice
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; she didn't make herself bride,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; but she did make herself ready.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Come on now. You can't make yourself
[1:39:33] bride,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; but you can make yourself ready.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Why? Cuz if my name
[1:39:41] was on the lamb's book of life,
[1:39:42] [screaming] that titled de of
[1:39:44] redemption. Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; And redemption is [screaming] not
[1:39:48] completed until I'm ready to go meet
[1:39:52] Jesus.
[1:39:56] Praise Jesus.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; The rapture [screaming] is God's way to
[1:39:59] remove the bride before wrath.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; You know, the beautiful thing of this is
[1:40:11] whenever it comes time
[1:40:14] for the change of our body, we will not
[1:40:16] even know the day nor the hour.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:21] It'll be just a normal day,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; just regular old things happening.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, Juliet will hear
[1:40:28] that ladder hit the top of the window.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; And she'll hear a voice. Come on,
[1:40:37] Juliet.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; It's time to go home.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; It's time to [snorts and clears throat]
[1:40:43] get out of here. Come on. Come on. Shh.
[1:40:45] Shh. Be quiet now. We can't let the
[1:40:47] church here. They got to go through
[1:40:48] tribulation. But the rest, don't let
[1:40:49] them denominations hear you. Come on.
[1:40:51] Come on.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You see, all those days that those women
[1:40:56] were standing around, Amen. waiting on
[1:40:58] that rancher to come back, do you know
[1:41:00] that that little lady, they'd say to
[1:41:01] her, "What you waiting on? He's coming
[1:41:02] for me. He promised me. He's coming for
[1:41:05] me. Oh, why don't you just go ahead and
[1:41:06] sit down? Sit down. I might wrinkle my
[1:41:08] dress. No thanks."
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; She stayed virtue. She's stayed all
[1:41:14] these things. And you know how she knew
[1:41:15] he was coming? This is the guy in the
[1:41:17] west, remember? And when them wagons go
[1:41:19] rolling down in the west, they always
[1:41:21] create a cloud everywhere they go.
[1:41:25] [applause]
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Woo! Hallelujah [screaming]
[1:41:27] to God. Hallelujah. And brother, that's
[1:41:30] how we know our bridegroom was coming
[1:41:32] for us because he came in the form of a
[1:41:35] cloud.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say now. Now, brother, be
[1:41:42] careful. I've heard guys preach that one
[1:41:44] off [screaming] in the air. And I've
[1:41:45] heard the ones that refuse to preach it
[1:41:46] go off in air,
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; too. Yes,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; That wasn't just rocket ship smoke.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; That was our Lord up there.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's the truth.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And it was all part of the coming of the
[1:42:00] Lord.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Not one event, not just one phase, but a
[1:42:04] process that began on the day of
[1:42:07] Pentecost.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He was only gone 10 days,
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; He promised he would return. He was only
[1:42:14] gone 10 days. He came back to them on
[1:42:16] the day of Pentecost. And that's what
[1:42:18] started the rapture for the church.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Every message had a part of the rapture.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; They without us cannot be made perfect.
[1:42:26] So they had to be sewn in the ground.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Wesley had a part. Luther had a part of
[1:42:33] the message. Pentecost had a part of the
[1:42:35] message.
[1:42:39] that all of these little loose ends had
[1:42:42] to be tied together
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; so that the message would be so clear
[1:42:47] that the bride would know what to
[1:42:48] expect, how to make ready, and when it's
[1:42:51] time to get out of here, be ready to get
[1:42:52] out of here.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; What do y'all reckon's been happening in
[1:42:55] these times you've been coming to church
[1:42:57] and hearing this message and that
[1:42:58] thought and that revelation and God
[1:43:00] speak that and God do that? He has been
[1:43:02] working you through a process to get you
[1:43:04] ready for the finality of rapture, which
[1:43:07] is the change of your body.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Let me prove that to you right now.
[1:43:14] Genesis 5 25 or 24, excuse me. The Bible
[1:43:18] said, "And Enoch walked with God."
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; There has been cosmonauts. There has
[1:43:24] been astronauts. He was the first was
[1:43:26] not.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; For God translated him. Now this word uh
[1:43:35] walk it literally means to walk about to
[1:43:38] live to conduct oneself in continual
[1:43:42] fellowship. So Enoch didn't just get up
[1:43:44] one morning brother Dale and say you
[1:43:45] know what I think I'll just walk with
[1:43:47] the Lord. And God came down say oh that
[1:43:48] pleases me. Off you go.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; We use the expression he took a stroll
[1:43:54] but that was one stroll of many.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Yes sir.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Cuz for Enoch, this was a daily
[1:44:02] walk,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; an everyday thing, an everyday walk with
[1:44:06] God, an everyday moving forward with the
[1:44:08] things of God.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; It was not a halfway life. [screaming]
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; It was a continual walk
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; of fellowship.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "Well, you know, I've had
[1:44:23] so many things in the past and I've been
[1:44:25] this and I've been that." We're not
[1:44:27] talking about what you was. We're
[1:44:29] talking about what you are.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; God ain't looking at what you was. He
[1:44:37] wants to know what you are right now.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; What does your faith say? What does your
[1:44:41] life declare? What's your heart say?
[1:44:43] Come on, somebody preach to me.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; He wants to know right now [screaming]
[1:44:46] where's your heart right now.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; If you're halfway in and halfway out,
[1:44:52] that testifies what you think about
[1:44:54] what's coming in the future. Right?
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Cuz many testify with the way they walk
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; as to what they think is getting ready
[1:45:02] to happen in this world,
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; folks.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; How much longer do you think we could
[1:45:06] possibly have? For the first time since
[1:45:08] the prophecy was spoken in the book of
[1:45:10] Revelation, and brother Brandham
[1:45:12] reiterates it to us in 1954, we now have
[1:45:14] a pope from the United States.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Don't say America. You're America, too.
[1:45:20] He didn't say America. He said the
[1:45:22] United States.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Canada is not the image to
[1:45:26] the beast. The US is.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; We are the ones that have the ability.
[1:45:30] And look at the setup of it. Now, I
[1:45:32] don't mean to sound like I'm trying to
[1:45:33] prophesy something, but my what better
[1:45:35] setup will we have right now for nearly
[1:45:38] 90% of Trump's office is his cabinet is
[1:45:41] Catholic people.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; The future president of 2028, highly
[1:45:46] possibly JD Vance, is a Catholic to the
[1:45:49] four.
[1:45:51] Yeah.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; What better [screaming] man if our new
[1:45:54] pope is still alive in four years
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; to go to JD and say, "You belong to me,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; and this is the way you're going to do
[1:46:04] things." And the Bible said that he gave
[1:46:06] them power to speak as the beast did
[1:46:09] before it.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; There ever was a lamp trimming time. Now
[1:46:16] is that time.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's
[1:46:20] right.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Notice again, Enoch's entire
[1:46:25] [screaming]
[1:46:25] lifestyle was in step with God's rhythm.
[1:46:29] God said, "Do this." He said, "Yes, sir.
[1:46:30] God, do that." Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; He had this testimony that he pleased
[1:46:34] God.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Now, all the years I've been walking,
[1:46:37] I've had some scraped knees and bruised
[1:46:39] elbows. But in order to be the kind of
[1:46:41] human I need to be, I don't stop walking
[1:46:44] because I scrape my knee. Right.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I don't stop walking because I trip over
[1:46:50] my big old long feet
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; and fall on my [screaming] face. You
[1:46:54] know what I do? I get right back up
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; and I keep on walking
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; cuz you know 15 or 20 years or whatever.
[1:47:02] It's just a little tiny few seconds for
[1:47:04] God Almighty. He's not even looking at
[1:47:06] the length of time knowhow.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. People say, "Well, I've
[1:47:13] gotten so far. If we only knew how far
[1:47:15] the hand of God reached for us, we'd
[1:47:17] quit saying that foolishness,
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; right? I love it." That's right. Now,
[1:47:24] watch this spiritual parallel. In
[1:47:26] Galatians 5:16,
[1:47:28] the Bible teaches us to walk in the
[1:47:30] spirit,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; so the bride's [screaming] rapture
[1:47:35] is the they're talking about the
[1:47:37] translation now is the ultimate final
[1:47:39] walk home.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said,
[1:47:49] "Think of it. On this earth, one day
[1:47:52] there'll be missing people."
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; You ever been to Walmart or some of
[1:47:57] these places and they put these missing
[1:47:58] photos up in that little box?
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; One of these days, mine's going to be
[1:48:02] there. Yeah.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "If 500 went out of here in the
[1:48:10] rapture,
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; the world would know nothing about it."
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; In another place, he said, "How do you
[1:48:18] know it's not going on all the time?"
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, you see, we've got certain things in
[1:48:25] our mind because we're dogmatic. That's
[1:48:27] why
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; quite honestly we haven't died from
[1:48:30] denominational prospects and ideas and
[1:48:32] conditions and theologies of this. We
[1:48:35] think God just has to do it in our
[1:48:36] little box of things. God does what he
[1:48:37] wants to.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; But as far as first Thessalonians, the
[1:48:44] event of the rapture, this is a
[1:48:46] universal thing.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, there's no way God could
[1:48:50] be taking people off the earth
[1:48:51] privately." How do you know?
[1:48:53] How do y'all reckon that people knew
[1:48:55] whether Philillip was there or there?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; He was in one city. God translated him
[1:49:01] to another. Nobody knew nothing about
[1:49:03] it.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Just a few people standing right there
[1:49:07] saw him just caught away. They might
[1:49:08] have not thought nothing about Well,
[1:49:09] praise the Lord. God done something.
[1:49:10] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; 15 years later, anybody ever Philip,
[1:49:14] what happened, old brother Phillip?
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We don't know but what
[1:49:21] God is doing things all the time right
[1:49:23] underneath our nose.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Lord.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Now watch. We are to walk in the spirit
[1:49:31] not walk in the flesh.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Walk according to the spirit. Listen to
[1:49:35] this. He swore by himself. He said just
[1:49:37] walk unconscience of fear.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Walk unconscience of criticism.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Walk unconscience of the world. Walk as
[1:49:48] you walk in Christ. walk with him, not
[1:49:51] paying attention to the right hand or
[1:49:53] the left.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; So, how do you do that?
[1:50:04] Uh-huh. You got the same look on your
[1:50:06] face whenever I ask myself the same
[1:50:07] question.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; It's easy to read this,
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; but to do it is an entirely different
[1:50:14] thing. When your heart is so gripped
[1:50:16] with anxiety and fear and you don't know
[1:50:18] how to think or do or act or whatever,
[1:50:20] then you just pull these quotes out. You
[1:50:21] say, "Well, brother said, walk uncons.
[1:50:23] Okay, I'm going to do it." And you're
[1:50:24] scared to death like a little boy
[1:50:25] whistling in the graveyard pretending
[1:50:27] he's not scared.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; So, how am I going to get to a place to
[1:50:34] where I can walk unconscious of
[1:50:37] everything else around me?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Says, "If something comes up in the
[1:50:43] church, walk with God." Hallelujah.
[1:50:45] Says, "If sickness strikes you, walk
[1:50:47] with God. If the neighbor don't like
[1:50:49] you, walk with God." Are you getting the
[1:50:51] essence of it?
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; How [screaming] am I going to get there?
[1:50:55] Just keep walking.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Don't stop.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm scared. I'm fearful.
[1:51:06] Okay. Keep walking.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Eventually. Eventually, brother Jose,
[1:51:11] you'll hit a spot
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; to where all of that will just go behind
[1:51:14] you. That's
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; And yet many of us get scared or fear or
[1:51:24] something strikes a sickness and we stop
[1:51:26] in our tracks. [gasps]
[1:51:29] That's just what the devil wants you to
[1:51:31] do.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; The doctor looks at you and says,
[1:51:38] "You've got dementia. You've got this,
[1:51:40] you've got cancer, you've got that. All
[1:51:42] of a sudden, that fear strikes your
[1:51:43] heart [gasps]
[1:51:45] and you stop walking.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; That's the key. The key. Oh, glory to
[1:51:51] God.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; The key. [screaming]
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Don't stop walking.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [cheering]
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Catch a vision of a well
[1:52:00] person and just walk right into
[1:52:02] [screaming] it."
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Well, what if I do? Well, don't know
[1:52:07] what to do. The Bible said just stand
[1:52:09] there and wait on the Lord.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; That's true. Just stand and wait on him.
[1:52:12] When you can't walk, then [screaming]
[1:52:13] stand there and wait on the Lord.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; But standing there is a lot different
[1:52:17] than stopping there.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; I stand and wait on the Lord cuz I know
[1:52:24] he'll make a way. When there's a wall in
[1:52:26] front of me, I know he'll make a way
[1:52:27] through it.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; But when someone stops, just flat out
[1:52:31] stops, it's because they have no
[1:52:33] ambition to keep on going.
[1:52:38] Oh Lord, if sickness strikes you, walk
[1:52:41] with God. The neighbor don't like you,
[1:52:42] walk with God. Just keep on walking.
[1:52:44] Enoch one day walked like that. You
[1:52:46] know, he walked all the way home. He got
[1:52:49] so far up the [screaming] road. Glory. I
[1:52:51] love this quote. That he didn't want to
[1:52:53] come back anymore.
[1:52:55] Amen. He said, "That's right. Walk with
[1:52:57] God. The doctor says you're going to
[1:52:59] die. Walk with God.
[1:53:03] Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4:1.
[1:53:09] Now,
[1:53:11] Paul is going to tell us how we're
[1:53:13] supposed to walk.
[1:53:16] And remember, the rapture
[1:53:18] is a uniting with Christ.
[1:53:21] Here we go.
[1:53:23] I beseech you that you walk worthy of
[1:53:26] the vocation wherewith you are called.
[1:53:30] This word he uses here is axios which
[1:53:32] means to be in balance with the value
[1:53:36] given.
[1:53:38] So walk equal literally means to walk
[1:53:41] equal to your qu to your calling rather.
[1:53:44] So the rapture bride isn't walking
[1:53:47] aimlessly
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; but proportionately. Amen.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:53:57] God's grace.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; I may not be able to behave myself and
[1:54:02] get through it. Boy, this blesses me.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; God's grace. Every time I take a step
[1:54:07] forward, there is [screaming] a measure.
[1:54:11] There is a measure of God's grace.
[1:54:13] Hallelujah. That meets
[1:54:16] Oh my
[1:54:19] Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah.
[1:54:23] [applause]
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Now, mind you, he don't pull out the
[1:54:26] fold, the full possession of He don't
[1:54:28] dump it all [screaming] on you at one
[1:54:30] time,
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; but he gives you enough to be able to
[1:54:33] take
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; the next step.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus, heal my eyes. Jesus, heal my
[1:54:43] eyes. Jesus, heal my eyes. Paul said,
[1:54:45] Paul,
[1:54:47] my grace
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; is so
[1:54:54] I would [screaming] like for someone to
[1:54:55] show me
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; where Paul's eyes ever stopped him from
[1:54:59] writing the Bible. Lord have mercy.
[1:55:03] [applause]
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; What it prove [screaming]
[1:55:05] God's grace was proportionate to where
[1:55:07] he was at.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; He needed to write the letter to the
[1:55:10] Ephesians. God grace was there to let
[1:55:12] him write these. See what big letter I
[1:55:14] [screaming] write.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. told him Galatians, "You
[1:55:20] love me so much at one time, you would
[1:55:21] have plucked your own eyeballs out to
[1:55:22] give them to me to fix my eyes."
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; But it was given to him because of the
[1:55:27] abundance of revelation,
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; so he wouldn't get lifted up in pride.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; But God's grace met that standard, that
[1:55:35] condition. And every time Paul needed to
[1:55:38] go forward,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; there was enough grace there to meet
[1:55:41] that next step.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; And enough to meet the next step. and
[1:55:47] enough. Say, "Brother Ben, are we ever
[1:55:48] going to run out?" Are you kidding me?
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Are you joking me?
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; He is the inexhaustible fountain of
[1:55:56] grace and life. [applause]
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; He is an abundant supply, an
[1:56:01] inexhaustible [screaming]
[1:56:02] fountain of grace and mercy.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; So walk proportionately.
[1:56:11] Walk in a balanced way.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:19] Now notice, oh my
[1:56:23] notice how the walk is just as
[1:56:27] predestinated as the baptism.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; We talk a lot about rapturing faith, but
[1:56:35] don't forget there's going to have to be
[1:56:37] some rapturing works go with our
[1:56:39] rapturing faith.
[1:56:46] There's a lot of people that don't
[1:56:47] believe in works.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe the Lord. I trust God. I
[1:56:52] love him. God don't care if I smoke or
[1:56:54] dip or vape or
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; God don't care if I sit around and watch
[1:56:58] pornography. God don't care if I hate my
[1:57:01] neighbor. God don't care if I Y'all look
[1:57:04] at me like you ain't never heard nothing
[1:57:05] like this before.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about people out there.
[1:57:08] I'm talking about people that walk in
[1:57:09] the same churches you walk into.
[1:57:11] believe, claim to believe the same
[1:57:12] things you believe.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Some of these places I go around the
[1:57:18] world, they're pitiful, but nothing like
[1:57:21] right here in North America.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Between the Canadians and the Americans,
[1:57:26] we are the most pitiful of all the
[1:57:27] bunch.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Because we have used the message for
[1:57:31] every excuse there is to live any way we
[1:57:35] want to.
[1:57:39] But if you plan on going out of here,
[1:57:41] your walk must be balanced.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; You can't be living in sin and then
[1:57:47] claiming grace. You can't be living like
[1:57:48] the world and then claim grace. You
[1:57:50] can't live like the devil and claim
[1:57:51] grace.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; There should be a lot bigger amens on
[1:57:55] this.
[1:57:57] [applause]
[1:57:59] Canadians, have you gotten so soft on
[1:58:01] sin and so light on sin and so tolerant
[1:58:03] on sin that you don't even like a
[1:58:05] preacher preaching this way? What's the
[1:58:06] matter with you?
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; You better wake up and pinch yourself.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; The devil's not [screaming] playing
[1:58:13] games. Even if you are.
[1:58:17] [applause]
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; And when somebody starts living wrong,
[1:58:20] [screaming]
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; if the word don't correct them and get
[1:58:23] them right,
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; they are on their way to hell. Amen.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Remember folks, hell was created for the
[1:58:34] devil and his angels.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Hell was not created for human beings.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; God never intended for people to go to
[1:58:42] to hell. He never wanted humans to go to
[1:58:44] hell. He was not willing that any
[1:58:46] [screaming] should perish. Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; But because he's a just God,
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; when people contradict and cross up his
[1:58:55] word,
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; there's no other place they can go.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; God don't send anybody to hell.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Man or woman sends themsself there by
[1:59:05] disbelieving the word of God. [applause]
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; That's why they do what they do anyways.
[1:59:10] They don't believe.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; They live an unbeliever's life, but they
[1:59:14] hide it under religion.
[1:59:16] The devil's deceived you, my brother.
[1:59:17] The devil's deceived you, my sister.
[1:59:19] Repent and come back [screaming] to God
[1:59:21] or you're wind up in the tribulation or
[1:59:23] worse.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; This rapture is not for just any old
[1:59:27] willy-nilly thing that wants to come
[1:59:28] along. Well, I believe the message. You
[1:59:29] better straighten up and live a life
[1:59:31] that shows you believe it.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz there'll come an hour of the voice
[1:59:40] will say, "He that is filthy, let him be
[1:59:42] filthy still.
[1:59:45] Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The unchangeable word.
[1:59:49] This is in July of 1960.
[1:59:51] [snorts] He said, "But a man seldom will
[1:59:53] you ever find one that'll lay down his
[1:59:55] life for the cause of Christ. He won't
[1:59:58] even call out of his shade tree and go
[2:00:00] to church.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; He won't even get out from behind the
[2:00:04] television long enough to attend
[2:00:06] Wednesday night prayer meeting."
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. He says, "Amen. It's a
[2:00:10] shame. It's a disgrace."
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now listen close.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the angels don't visit
[2:00:19] the churches.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason the angels don't
[2:00:25] visit homes.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; We've got to get to deep sincerity of
[2:00:31] this thing. Yeah. Yeah. [applause]
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; So, if an angel won't visit a church
[2:00:37] that's backslid and won't visit a home
[2:00:39] that's backslid and won't repent, by the
[2:00:41] way,
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; then how do we think Jesus is going to
[2:00:44] come take us out of this world?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; If our life is any less than that right
[2:00:49] there,
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; if an angel won't come to me, how will
[2:00:52] Jesus?
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, mercy.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the truth. [applause]
[2:00:58] If an angel doesn't feel comfortable to
[2:01:00] be in, they come from a heavenly place,
[2:01:02] friend. And if they come into their
[2:01:03] home, the atmosphere should match what's
[2:01:06] in our home, then what's in heaven.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; But if every time they come in the home
[2:01:10] is nothing but a bunch of fussing and
[2:01:11] fighting and lying and laughing and
[2:01:13] gossiping and everything, how can
[2:01:15] [screaming] an angel of the Lord
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; ever feel comfortable in that
[2:01:18] atmosphere?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; That's why when we come to the house of
[2:01:26] God, We must be pure people.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; If you walk in here a sinner or a
[2:01:34] backslider or somebody trying to get
[2:01:36] your life right with God and you don't
[2:01:37] know any better, this does not apply to
[2:01:39] you. But if you claim to be a believer
[2:01:41] and you're a regular and you're still
[2:01:43] living like the devil,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; don't expect not even Jesus or an angel
[2:01:48] to ever come to your house.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; He'll only come where he's welcome.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:56] Amen.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; The words amen in case you forgot it.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I know. I know. I've been getting
[2:02:06] kicked at this whole service. Some
[2:02:07] There's somebody in here or people in
[2:02:09] here don't like what I'm preaching. That
[2:02:10] is too bad. You don't like it, go ahead.
[2:02:12] You can leave.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to keep you here. I'm not
[2:02:17] trying to joke you or laugh you or or or
[2:02:19] entertain you to keep you here. If you
[2:02:21] don't want to go on the rapture, then
[2:02:23] you're in the wrong church service. Cuz
[2:02:26] I'm talking [screaming] about only those
[2:02:27] that are dedicated to the word of the
[2:02:30] hour.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah [screaming]
[2:02:32] to God. Hallelujah. We want to be ready
[2:02:34] when he comes.
[2:02:37] [applause]
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:39] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe the World Series got you more
[2:02:42] excited than this did.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; No thanks.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Wow. I turned the TV on last night. Look
[2:02:49] at it. I've always liked baseball
[2:02:52] and
[2:02:54] I flipped it on a few minutes just to
[2:02:56] kind of see where they're at. [snorts]
[2:02:58] And I'm sitting there watching these
[2:02:59] people and this guy hit a big thing and
[2:03:01] they run to certain bases and jumped
[2:03:02] around all that. Them people were
[2:03:04] screaming.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; They were hollering.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; They had towels in their hand, brother.
[2:03:09] And they were going like this.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; I thought, my God, what a bunch of
[2:03:13] unholy rollers.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; But we come to the house of God. We hear
[2:03:18] the word preached. We hear the truth
[2:03:21] manifested before us. We feel the
[2:03:23] presence of God around the building and
[2:03:25] we sat there like an old bump on a
[2:03:27] pickle.
[2:03:29] [applause]
[2:03:31] [cheering]
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; I don't mean quietnatured people. I'm
[2:03:33] talking about people that are stubborn
[2:03:35] and resistant to the moving of the
[2:03:37] spirit of God.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; We ought to be worse than what they are.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz they'll finish that game as they
[2:03:44] finished it last night and then people
[2:03:45] will talk about it for a few months and
[2:03:47] that'll be it till the next season comes
[2:03:48] along. But we've been talking about this
[2:03:50] for over 2,000 [screaming] years,
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; and it still should excite the people of
[2:03:55] God.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; But some people will get so excited over
[2:04:01] a puff bag of air.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; That's their God.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; I teach some of these Europeans and some
[2:04:07] of these Chinese kids that's big on
[2:04:09] football. I don't mean American football
[2:04:10] now. I'm talking about football.
[2:04:12] Football
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; and uh soccer. Thank you. and and and
[2:04:17] when the World Cup is going on, these
[2:04:18] kids will come in. They don't know any
[2:04:20] other English. Normally, I can barely
[2:04:23] get them to say two words. But when it
[2:04:25] comes to football, they are the most
[2:04:27] English- speakaking people I've ever
[2:04:28] heard in my life.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; They'll tell me stats and figures and
[2:04:33] who's doing what and how they did it and
[2:04:35] when they done it. I think, my lord,
[2:04:37] that's the problem. I just need to be
[2:04:38] teaching these people English through
[2:04:39] football.
[2:04:43] But that's become their God in this last
[2:04:45] day.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And the Apostle Paul prophesied in the
[2:04:49] last day that would come those scoffers,
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[2:04:54] God.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus comes,
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; you'll be left sitting right here.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing wrong with liking
[2:05:05] ball games or enjoying sports of some
[2:05:07] kind like that. I believe there's a
[2:05:09] balance to all of those things.
[2:05:12] Just like Christmas, just like anything
[2:05:13] else you look at, there is a balance to
[2:05:16] every single one. Oh, I hit the buzz
[2:05:17] word. Some of you anti-Christ people
[2:05:20] almost swallowed your gum. You shouldn't
[2:05:21] have gum in church in the first place.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, preach to me a little
[2:05:25] while.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Right. But I'm telling you, brother, in
[2:05:28] the name of the Lord, everyone's got a
[2:05:30] balance to everything,
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; but Holy Ghost gives you a right balance
[2:05:36] in the word.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you don't have the Holy
[2:05:41] Ghost, you'll you'll go out of step and
[2:05:43] out of sync every time.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Did you notice those last ones in
[2:05:46] Brother Ram's vision, the masterpiece,
[2:05:48] they got out of step at the end,
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; but that didn't stop them from making it
[2:05:52] cuz there was a voice that told them to
[2:05:54] get back in line. Oh my,
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; I never saw it that way before.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; They got a little bit out of step.
[2:06:00] [screaming] That's true. But just
[2:06:01] because they got out of sink a little
[2:06:02] bit didn't mean they weren't
[2:06:04] correctable.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean they wasn't teachable.
[2:06:08] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:06:10] That's the way it is with a child of
[2:06:12] God. Lord, I may be wrong, but teach me,
[2:06:14] Jesus.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Correct [screaming] me, Lord. Help me
[2:06:17] get right with you.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yes, sir. It'll take that born
[2:06:28] again experience, washed in the blood of
[2:06:30] the lamb,
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; sanctified,
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; or they'll never make that rapture.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. And from that time,
[2:06:44] could you get a little bit more of your
[2:06:45] time?
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; And that's called from that time. When
[2:06:49] the church comes together in the
[2:06:51] resurrection,
[2:06:52] the same spirit
[2:06:56] that was in Jesus Christ
[2:06:59] will have to be in the church.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; You can't copy anything like it.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; You can't make nothing different from
[2:07:12] it. It's got to be the same holy soul
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; that dwelt in Christ. And when the
[2:07:20] rapture comes, [screaming]
[2:07:21] when that body comes, his bride that was
[2:07:23] torn from him or the Holy Ghost will
[2:07:25] bring that bride
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; and exactly dovetail. I love this word
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; will dovetail right into the body
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:41] Oh, [laughter]
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not so certain, but I'm not ready to
[2:07:48] speak your language, Jose.
[2:07:50] Oh, glory to God. Remember, we are
[2:07:53] trying to become the stature of a
[2:07:55] perfect man, [screaming]
[2:07:56] not men.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; This is not the stature of perfect men.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; This is the stature of a one perfect
[2:08:07] man.
[2:08:09] And there was only one [laughter]
[2:08:11] and that was Jesus Christ. [screaming]
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; And his life, his spirit, his love,
[2:08:19] everything once it unites into the body
[2:08:22] of Christ, when the rapture comes, it'll
[2:08:24] perfectly tail.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, help me, Lord. Help me. All right,
[2:08:31] son. I'll help you. Uh, Jesus, I'm
[2:08:33] having trouble praying. I'll help you.
[2:08:34] Don't worry. I'm your advocate. Thank
[2:08:36] you, Lord.
[2:08:41] Praise be to God.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; My faith will be his.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Get this right.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Not like his.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; My faith will be his.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; My patience will not be like his. It
[2:09:01] will be. M
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; let me go a step further and finish it
[2:09:07] off. My [screaming] love will not be
[2:09:09] mine or like it, it will be his.
[2:09:15] [applause]
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Do you realize you can't forgive unless
[2:09:20] you've got that?
[2:09:24] [applause]
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; And faith and forgiveness go together.
[2:09:28] Yeah.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; So, if you want rapturing faith, you're
[2:09:31] going to have to have rapturing
[2:09:32] forgiveness.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Mercy. I hope some of y'all are writing
[2:09:36] some of this down. Never remember it
[2:09:38] when I get out of here.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, [screaming] glory. Hallelujah.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Speak, Lord Jesus.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Again, in his eye, be not afraid. Since
[2:09:51] the days of Luther, they lived under
[2:09:52] justification. The days of Wesley, they
[2:09:54] came a little higher. The church become
[2:09:56] in the minority under sanctification.
[2:09:58] Then come the Pentecostal move which was
[2:10:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[2:10:02] restoration of gifts. Now we're going
[2:10:06] above that.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; For some people you don't get no higher
[2:10:11] than the gifts.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; But the gifts are not the end of it.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; You know some people still have that
[2:10:19] idea. For them, the best that the bride
[2:10:23] can offer is some gift in the pull pit
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; or a bunch of gifts in the church.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; I read it to you last night. Whether it
[2:10:31] be prophecies, they'll fail. Whether it
[2:10:34] be tongues, they'll cease. Whether they
[2:10:36] be good gospel preachers, they will
[2:10:38] fall. They will make mistakes.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; So, how [screaming] much higher can we
[2:10:46] go?
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; More.
[2:10:50] He said, "We're going above that to the
[2:10:52] capstone."
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:56] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; You see, that pyramid within itself is
[2:11:00] imperfect.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; And the capstone is a perfect pyramid
[2:11:03] within itself. Oh my God. Hallelujah.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; And without that, the rest Oh,
[2:11:09] [screaming] hallelujah.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Without that, the rest of it cannot be
[2:11:14] made perfect. But once he sets down,
[2:11:16] [screaming]
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; the rest of it becomes a perfect.
[2:11:22] [applause]
[2:11:23] [cheering]
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; I'm about to say something to you. I
[2:11:24] hope you're ready for it. Martin Luther
[2:11:26] hated the Jews, called a man of Christ,
[2:11:28] smoked pipes, and drank beer. Wesley
[2:11:30] hated predestination. Pentecost got off
[2:11:32] denomination and evidences. Amen. But
[2:11:35] where they were imperfect,
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; that capstone makes them all perfect.
[2:11:48] Well, if it made them perfect with what
[2:11:50] little bit they knew.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; I said if it made them perfect with what
[2:11:56] little bit they knew.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; What about the [screaming] rest of us?
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Preach to me.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; What about the rest of us? Imperfect
[2:12:09] human beings. But when he sits down,
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; it makes me perfect.
[2:12:23] [sighs and gasps]
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "The church,
[2:12:27] the spirit that's in the church and the
[2:12:30] spirit that's in him has to be
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; the same."
[2:12:36] Oh,
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; brother. [applause]
[2:12:41] When
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; I was in Jamaica, some of them saints
[2:12:43] would amen like this. Amen. M. I feel
[2:12:45] like saying the same thing. Amen. M.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Glory [screaming] to Hallelujah.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what language to pick, but
[2:12:54] I want to pick one of them.
[2:12:57] [sighs]
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; December of 59. What was the Holy Ghost
[2:13:01] given for? Now, we're going to show
[2:13:02] after a while that just those who are
[2:13:06] filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that
[2:13:09] rapture.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. The rest of the dead live
[2:13:15] not for the space of a thousand years.
[2:13:17] That's right. Just Holy Spiritfilled
[2:13:20] people.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Was all that went in the rapture.
[2:13:32] Next point,
[2:13:35] the rapture
[2:13:37] is the presentation
[2:13:39] of the completed elect.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Romans 12:1
[2:13:45] presents your bodies a living sacrifice
[2:13:48] that he might
[2:13:50] present it to himself. Ephesians 5:27,
[2:13:54] that he might present to himself. So
[2:13:55] present your body as a living sacrifice
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; so that he can present it to himself. So
[2:14:00] what's the rapture going to be? The
[2:14:01] formal presentation of a completed
[2:14:04] bride.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; It's just like whenever somebody's
[2:14:07] getting ready, the preacher standing up
[2:14:08] there and everybody's standing up there
[2:14:10] and all of a sudden you hear that
[2:14:13] [music]
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; everybody stops and they take Now listen
[2:14:20] close. Listen, listen. [screaming] Don't
[2:14:22] you fail this in the name of the Lord.
[2:14:24] They take their eyes off the groom and
[2:14:26] the preacher.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; The attraction changes from the groom
[2:14:36] and the bride's groom. The uh the
[2:14:39] advocate for the bridegroom. Amen. Uh uh
[2:14:42] the porter. I was trying to think of the
[2:14:44] word that Jesus called him. Amen. The
[2:14:45] one that would be like the best man. The
[2:14:48] one that stood by the bridegroom that
[2:14:49] prepared everything. Oh,
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; when they hear that music played,
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom might have come out and
[2:14:58] all those people might have been out
[2:14:59] there and they all might have been
[2:15:01] sitting, "Oh my, look at the groom. Look
[2:15:02] at his tux. Look how he is." All of a
[2:15:04] sudden,
[2:15:07] [music]
[2:15:10] what happens?
[2:15:12] Everybody stands up.
[2:15:22] Hallelujah. [music]
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; And they see her come walking through.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; The focus changes from the bridegroom
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; to the bride.
[2:15:46] And one of these days, brother, one of
[2:15:49] these days, Jesus is going to come and
[2:15:52] he's going to meet us in the air. And
[2:15:55] the focus, Hallelujah to God,
[2:15:56] [screaming]
[2:15:57] is going to change from the bridegroom.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; To the bride.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want to scare you, but that's
[2:16:06] what God's been doing for 60 years now.
[2:16:10] preparing and presenting
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; the wife of Jesus Christ.
[2:16:17] [cheering]
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [applause]
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say it's all about Jesus, but
[2:16:35] then Jesus would turn around and say,
[2:16:36] "Oh, but she's I'm all about her."
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; You say that's impossible. No, it's
[2:16:51] [screaming] not.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "What sir is the attraction on
[2:16:54] the mount today?
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; He's moved from the prophet
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; to the prophecy."
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; you are the reason
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; for the rapture.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:17:11] [cheering]
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; And let me say this to you. He is my
[2:17:15] reason for the rapture, but I am his
[2:17:18] reason for the rapture. [laughter]
[2:17:21] [cheering]
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to take it easy on
[2:17:29] me, Lord. You're about to kill me.
[2:17:31] [laughter]
[2:17:32] The prophet of God said that Einstein
[2:17:34] had discovered that if objects could
[2:17:36] move at 1 billion miles per second that
[2:17:39] they could pass through one another. You
[2:17:42] see CNN, Fox, MNS, MSNBC, all the
[2:17:45] Canadian channels, all the Africa
[2:17:47] channels, Jamaican, Trinidadian, all of
[2:17:50] the Hispanic countries and all of Latin
[2:17:52] America where they don't have a camera
[2:17:54] fast enough to catch Jesus when he
[2:17:57] starts moving.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he'll move faster than a moment,
[2:18:01] in a twinkling of an eye. And he'll move
[2:18:03] in such a way that only the bride will
[2:18:05] be looking for him. I've waited my whole
[2:18:08] [screaming] life to say to the devil,
[2:18:10] "Now you see me, now you don't."
[2:18:14] Cuz
[2:18:16] [screaming]
[2:18:21] one of these days he'll come down, swoop
[2:18:23] in here, and he'll take me out of here
[2:18:25] before you [laughter] could even blink
[2:18:26] your eyes and battle him.
[2:18:30] [applause]
[2:18:32] [gasps]
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; In St. John chapter 14 2 and 3, he said,
[2:18:52] "It my father's house are many mansions.
[2:18:53] If it were not true, I would have told
[2:18:54] you. I go to prepare a place for you."
[2:18:58] This word prepare means to put in proper
[2:19:01] order.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; To arrange and make ready in proper
[2:19:05] order. You see what I am here matches
[2:19:09] what he's doing over there.
[2:19:12] [applause]
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; In my new house, brother Jose, in the
[2:19:14] new place that I dwell, there will be no
[2:19:17] Netflix, Prime Video. There will be no
[2:19:19] gossip. There will be no this and that
[2:19:21] and internet chat rooms. And there will
[2:19:22] be none of that. My character here will
[2:19:25] match what's going on over there.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:19:29] [applause]
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; I was preaching the other night and I
[2:19:31] said, "If God gives a man the desires of
[2:19:33] his heart, my portion of the river of
[2:19:35] life will have D flowing through it."
[2:19:38] And after a church brother come by and
[2:19:40] he said, "And don't forget Taco Bell
[2:19:42] right next to it."
[2:19:44] Oh my. Praise be to God. Amen. It's
[2:19:47] going to be built. The prophet said
[2:19:48] he'll build it to [screaming] your
[2:19:49] liking and your specification. He
[2:19:52] already knows what you need.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:19:57] [cheering]
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; So my life is a reflection here
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; of what is going to be there.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; So he's putting everything in its proper
[2:20:06] order. Imagine
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; the prophet said right now he's working
[2:20:09] on that city.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; And while he's working there, I'm busy
[2:20:16] working over here.
[2:20:18] Amen. [applause]
[2:20:20] Amen.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Making sure my prayer life is right.
[2:20:23] Making sure my heart is right. Making
[2:20:24] sure the things I do for God is right.
[2:20:32] [sighs]
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Let me read this and let's close. 1
[2:20:34] Corinthians 15:51-52.
[2:20:38] Behold, I show you a mystery.
[2:20:45] You know what was a mystery to them is
[2:20:48] no longer a mystery to us.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Paul could talk about it, but Paul
[2:20:55] didn't understand it.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Not unless he knew something from what
[2:20:58] God showed him when he went beyond the
[2:20:59] third one when he entered that third
[2:21:00] heaven. God may have understood and
[2:21:02] showed him this and he wasn't permitted
[2:21:03] to say it. But there was not another
[2:21:05] person on this planet. John wrote about
[2:21:07] it and put it in the book of Revelation
[2:21:09] and the symbol was there, but John
[2:21:11] didn't understand it. Peter had the keys
[2:21:14] to the kingdom, but Peter didn't
[2:21:15] understand translation. Those other ones
[2:21:17] had great works of God, great God, great
[2:21:20] of God, but they didn't understand that.
[2:21:22] But where they didn't, we do.
[2:21:28] [cheering and applause]
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Behold, I show you a mystery. Yes.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; And in the days of the voice of the
[2:21:37] seventh angel,
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; the mysteries of God should be finished.
[2:21:44] [applause]
[2:21:45] [cheering]
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; That's why for people around this truth
[2:21:49] that that still look at brother Brandham
[2:21:51] as like he's optional, the message like
[2:21:53] it's optional. Well, I can have the Holy
[2:21:55] Ghost. I can be born again. I can get
[2:21:57] right with God and I don't need the
[2:21:58] message. You are deceived.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; God didn't send that star to this age to
[2:22:04] light up just a certain portion. And God
[2:22:06] was only going to hold that certain
[2:22:08] portion accountable. That message was
[2:22:10] sent to this age. And the entire
[2:22:12] [screaming] world is responsible for
[2:22:13] what he preached.
[2:22:16] [applause]
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "If you even hear that
[2:22:18] there's a prophet in the land, you're
[2:22:19] responsible to go check it out."
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:24] Now,
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; there'll be those that won't hear these
[2:22:26] things and they'll have their own
[2:22:27] journeys and their own routes.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; But if you want to make the rapture,
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; cuz you see, to be saved, all you have
[2:22:34] to know is Jesus by salvation.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; He can forgive you of your sins. He can
[2:22:38] forgive you and and and save wash you
[2:22:41] and save you.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; But if you want to make the rapture,
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; you need to know the name William
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Brandom.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ben, be careful. I know
[2:22:54] where I'm standing.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Obviously, you don't. That's why I'm
[2:22:57] preaching it.
[2:22:59] [applause]
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you tell me that. All I need to
[2:23:02] know is the name of Jesus. Them first
[2:23:04] early Jews had the same idea. And Paul
[2:23:08] told them, "Follow me as I
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. [applause]
[2:23:16] [cheering]
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; You ain't getting all scot-free. You
[2:23:18] pulled this up. You pulled this out of
[2:23:20] my gift. And I'm going to deal with it
[2:23:21] before we quit." The message is what
[2:23:23] prepares us to get out of here. And if
[2:23:26] you reject the message of William
[2:23:27] Brandham, you'll be left sitting right
[2:23:29] here.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; It's not optional.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; It's not like, you know, when you go buy
[2:23:36] a car and they ask you what options you
[2:23:38] want. Well, I want power windows. I want
[2:23:40] warming seats. The message is not an
[2:23:42] option.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; To get ready to go out of here and to
[2:23:47] meet to meet Jesus and the coming of the
[2:23:49] Lord. The message is essential.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:53] I'm glad to see these preachers shaking
[2:23:54] their head. Yes.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz we've got what what else could we
[2:23:58] preach?
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; You listen to me. We had the Bible for
[2:24:01] 2,000 years and never understood what it
[2:24:04] really meant until Malachi 4, Elijah
[2:24:07] come and straightened it. Amen.
[2:24:09] [screaming]
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Until that prophet straightened it out.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; We didn't even understand what the book
[2:24:15] of Revelation was.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Men had probed at it and probed at it
[2:24:19] and probed at it. Charles Taz Russell,
[2:24:22] the leader of the Jehovah Witness, had
[2:24:23] the bride, 144,000.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Larkin believed in Trinity and had all
[2:24:28] kinds of other things going on.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; But when Elijah come,
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; he took a big step back.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; And he looked at all of these things.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "My goodness, the body of
[2:24:41] Christ is the sickest body I've ever
[2:24:42] seen in my life."
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; She don't even know who the church is.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; She don't even know who the bride is.
[2:24:50] Well, look at this guy. He's saying the
[2:24:51] bride is going to go through
[2:24:53] tribulation. Well, my goodness. Where
[2:24:54] does he get that?
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Do you realize this is the only man on
[2:24:58] the face of the planet with the only
[2:24:59] revelation that the people needed and
[2:25:01] nobody knew what he knew?
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; They had portions of truth.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz of course, the seventh angel had no
[2:25:09] specific message in himself. Well, so
[2:25:12] where was he supposed to get it?
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Pull it out of thin air?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; No. He went and collected all of the
[2:25:17] truths out of all of those lost ages,
[2:25:19] all of those ages that had partial
[2:25:21] things.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [screaming]
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; And when the seven seals came open,
[2:25:30] that's where he began to positionally
[2:25:32] place everybody.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "I no longer call you church. I
[2:25:37] call you bride."
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz the church Oh, glory to God. Cuz the
[2:25:44] church will go through the tribulation
[2:25:47] period. That's right. He said that's
[2:25:48] that sleeping remnant, that sleeping
[2:25:50] virgin, that foolish virgin. But the
[2:25:53] wise,
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; the wise [screaming]
[2:25:56] went in with him cuz they had oil in
[2:25:59] their lamps.
[2:26:03] [applause]
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; They come to that 144,000. He said,
[2:26:07] "That's the Jews."
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Their names are on the Lamb's Book of
[2:26:10] Life.
[2:26:12] They'll receive two prophets.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Did you ever stop to think about the
[2:26:17] type there, Billy Graham and or Roberts
[2:26:20] represented the two angels went down to
[2:26:21] Sodom, right?
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Did you notice after their message was
[2:26:25] completed
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; that Lot I just heard it in the Bible
[2:26:28] yesterday? I was listening to the audio
[2:26:29] book and I was going up the road
[2:26:31] listening to my little Bible program and
[2:26:33] I caught something I never saw before.
[2:26:36] When the men come to the door wanting to
[2:26:38] bring those men angels out so they could
[2:26:41] have their way with him.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Lot,
[2:26:44] he was just a penny anyhow.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; He didn't have enough quality about him
[2:26:49] to be able to stand against sin.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz he wasn't like Abraham,
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible said his righteous soul
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; grieved him,
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; hurt him, afflicted him.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; He wanted to do the right thing and God
[2:27:02] recognized it as righteous. As I heard a
[2:27:04] few days ago, Abraham praying saying
[2:27:06] there, Lord, if there be 40 in the city,
[2:27:08] if there be 30. See, that's where a real
[2:27:10] believer does.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; No real believer wants to see anybody
[2:27:13] lost.
[2:27:14] [applause]
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; I said no believer wants to see anyone
[2:27:22] go to hell.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:27] [applause]
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; And God sent them angels down into
[2:27:30] Sodom. Did you notice
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; after the message had been delivered,
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord told Lot, "If you
[2:27:36] don't get out of here, I cannot bring
[2:27:39] judgment against this city."
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, how about this little
[2:27:42] one? Isn't it a little one? I can go to
[2:27:43] that one, right?" He said, "Why sure you
[2:27:45] go there, but you've got to go because I
[2:27:48] can't bring judgment until you leave."
[2:27:50] Did you notice two angels
[2:27:53] brought judgment on the homosexuals?
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, it wasn't just
[2:27:59] homosexuals. It was perverted of all
[2:28:01] kinds.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Well, I know I'm in Canada. I got to be
[2:28:05] careful because you got your little hate
[2:28:06] crimes and all that. I don't hate
[2:28:08] nobody. Let me be clear.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; And if Carney or Trudeau or anybody's
[2:28:11] listening to me right now, I don't hate
[2:28:13] anybody.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; I want to see them all saved.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Or whatever big brother wants to listen
[2:28:19] to me. I want to see them all saved.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; But God reserves his own judgment for
[2:28:25] what he thinks is wrong. I don't have to
[2:28:27] say a word about it.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; But these two angels begin to speak and
[2:28:31] judgment fell upon that perverted city.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; And here we come all the way to the end
[2:28:36] time. We've had an Abraham
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; who turned his back to the people.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's
[2:28:42] right.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; God discerned through an ham. Right. The
[2:28:45] angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham.
[2:28:47] Why'd Sarah laugh in the tent? Is that
[2:28:48] right?
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; We've seen that last sign that come
[2:28:52] before what? Before the change of their
[2:28:54] body. Yes, sir. [applause]
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Right after that, what do you have?
[2:28:59] Moses and Elijah in Sodom
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; with the power of the sixth seal to
[2:29:05] speak
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; to speak fire. Those two angels. Isn't
[2:29:09] that amazing?
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; Moses and Elijah
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; right down in Sodom. The type was laying
[2:29:15] right there in front of my face all
[2:29:16] these years and I saw it to just
[2:29:17] yesterday.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; The two witnesses will bring judgment.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Listen carefully. Elijah was raptured up
[2:29:25] because God loved that spirit of Elijah
[2:29:27] because it was obedient
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; and because he was faithful to the truth
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; and he loved that spirit so much. God
[2:29:32] would not allow Elijah to be killed.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; So he took him up in a cloud.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; And do you know what made Elisha the man
[2:29:43] he was? When he saw Elijah caught up
[2:29:45] into the cloud.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; You might as well sit down. Obviously
[2:29:49] I'm not done preaching yet.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Sit down. Go on. I'm not done yet. You
[2:29:54] keep pulling. I'm going to keep
[2:29:55] preaching. We ain't there yet.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; But do you realize that Elisha seeing
[2:30:03] Elijah caught up was when the mantel
[2:30:05] fell back on him. Same thing in this
[2:30:07] hour when we see our Elijah caught up in
[2:30:10] the opening of the word. That's where
[2:30:11] the manel falls on us.
[2:30:14] [cheering]
[2:30:17] [applause]
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; And God loved that spirit of Elijah.
[2:30:19] When Elijah, Elisha, John the Baptist,
[2:30:21] Brother Brandham, and it connects and
[2:30:23] continues over into Israel
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; with Elijah the prophet. [applause]
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; They torment those people so badly. The
[2:30:30] Bible said when they kill them, they lay
[2:30:32] in the streets for three days and they
[2:30:33] give gifts one to another.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; And then the spirit of life enters back
[2:30:42] into them.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Guess what happens? Guess what happens?
[2:30:46] They're caught up
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; into a cloud.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; You have the three raptures of the old,
[2:30:54] three raptures of the new, with Jesus
[2:30:57] being the keystone right in the middle.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; That connects both of them.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; If the only way to be a part of the
[2:31:10] bride was you had to hear the message of
[2:31:12] your hour,
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:31:15] The people that wanted to be bride in
[2:31:17] Luther's day had to hear Luther.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; The people want to be bride in Wesley's
[2:31:24] day had to hear Wesley.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; How do you think we're going to be bride
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; if we don't care nothing about what
[2:31:33] Brother Brham taught us?
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to get back to
[2:31:39] studying
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; what he said. Cuz
[2:31:46] you know we got we got too many
[2:31:47] preachers that are professional quoters.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; That's all they know. They couldn't
[2:31:51] preach if they wouldn't say the Bible
[2:31:52] said the Bible said brother said
[2:31:53] brother. What about inspiration?
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; There must be some inspiration in what
[2:31:58] you're hearing
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; to be able to minister to the people
[2:32:02] what was said.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; And if I'm going to say what he said,
[2:32:06] I've got to say it in the same
[2:32:08] inspiration he said it in
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; or I'm not saying it like he said it.
[2:32:12] Amen.
[2:32:14] [applause]
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; We got too many preachers now that they
[2:32:17] think rapturing faith. Okay, I'll just
[2:32:18] read it and you believe it and that's
[2:32:20] all there is to it.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; if we don't have some inspiration,
[2:32:28] [clears throat]
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; if we don't have an awakening within
[2:32:31] oursel,
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; no matter how much you read,
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; study, or listen,
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; when Jesus comes,
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; you'll be left sitting right here.
[2:32:45] Now I'm done. Let's stay.
[2:32:51] [applause]
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; I'm just a troublemaker. I think I think
[2:32:58] that's all I
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; That's all right. Amen.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[2:33:06] either listening to me today,
[2:33:10] if you know your heart is not ready for
[2:33:11] the rapture,
[2:33:14] if you know after listening to what I'm
[2:33:16] preaching today, perhaps you didn't even
[2:33:19] understand much of what I said, that's
[2:33:21] fine,
[2:33:23] I have to preach to the Christians in
[2:33:25] here, too.
[2:33:26] Amen.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; But if you're standing here this morning
[2:33:31] and in your heart, you know, you're just
[2:33:33] not ready to meet Jesus.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; Would you be honest enough with God?
[2:33:43] Now, bow your heads. Close your eyes.
[2:33:44] No, everybody. Just real reverend.
[2:33:48] The reason I want you looking around is
[2:33:50] because somebody might think, "Oh,
[2:33:51] somebody might see me." And they won't
[2:33:52] put their hand up.
[2:33:54] This is pretty serious for me. as a
[2:33:56] Christian, as a preacher, it's pretty
[2:33:58] serious for me. I I want everyone to
[2:34:00] feel comfortable. So, please just just
[2:34:03] give everyone some privacy
[2:34:06] in your heart. You know, cuz see,
[2:34:08] friends, you don't realize sometimes I
[2:34:09] preach things like this and preachers
[2:34:10] get under conviction, put their hand up.
[2:34:13] That's hard for them of a congregation
[2:34:15] looking at their pastor doing something
[2:34:16] like that. They start think, well,
[2:34:17] something's wrong with him or whatever.
[2:34:21] But I want you to be able to be honest.
[2:34:22] No matter where you at,
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; no matter what occupation you might be,
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; no matter what position in the church
[2:34:29] you might be, if you hear me this
[2:34:31] morning preaching and you in your heart,
[2:34:32] you're convicted and you know, I'm not
[2:34:35] ready to meet Jesus if he comes.
[2:34:39] Would you slip your hand up to the Lord?
[2:34:42] God bless you and you and you. You and
[2:34:45] you and you and you and you and you and
[2:34:49] you. My goodness.
[2:34:52] Now, remember, I'm not talking about you
[2:34:54] with the Holy Ghost that you're just
[2:34:56] struggling or having problems or just
[2:34:59] having difficulties. I I don't mean you
[2:35:01] Christian people now,
[2:35:03] but those that are not born again.
[2:35:07] You know that your life isn't converted
[2:35:08] and you know that you just battle the
[2:35:10] world all the time and desires of the
[2:35:12] world all the time and
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; you struggle, but you just don't know
[2:35:15] what the next steps are and you don't
[2:35:16] know how to Well, this is how you this
[2:35:17] is your next steps.
[2:35:20] Just put your hand up to the Lord and
[2:35:21] say, "Father, that's me.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; I need salvation. I need to be saved. I
[2:35:26] need to be sanctified, filled with the
[2:35:27] Holy Ghost. I need to be converted.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; God bless every hand."
[2:35:36] Now, perhaps you're your backslid on the
[2:35:38] Lord or cold or something.
[2:35:41] Maybe you'd just like to say to the Lord
[2:35:43] Jesus, "Father, as I stand here today,"
[2:35:46] Lord, I I I don't want my life and my
[2:35:48] heart to be some kind of
[2:35:51] scandal or some kind of constant
[2:35:54] misstep.
[2:35:56] Lord, I want to rededicate my life. Many
[2:35:59] come here last night. I was so happy to
[2:36:00] see preachers and everything come up
[2:36:02] here want to rededicate their life to
[2:36:04] the Lord Jesus.
[2:36:08] And so
[2:36:11] maybe you wasn't here last night or
[2:36:12] maybe you're just hearing this today
[2:36:16] and you want to say, "Brother Ben,
[2:36:20] I've just lived such an awful life and
[2:36:22] been so out of touch."
[2:36:25] But can I remind you the first song I
[2:36:27] sang to you tonight? That very first one
[2:36:28] I sang this morning. All you have to do
[2:36:31] to Jesus is just say, "Please forgive
[2:36:33] me, Lord.
[2:36:35] Though your sins be as scarlet, they can
[2:36:37] be white as snow.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; If you're some of those Christians or
[2:36:45] confessed or potential Christians, I'm
[2:36:48] talking about running around everything
[2:36:49] in the world smoking and vaping and
[2:36:51] drinking and cussing. And some of you
[2:36:54] men and women alike. I've seen it on
[2:36:56] both sides. Not just men, but women just
[2:36:58] as addicted to things like pornography
[2:37:00] and social media sites to where they're
[2:37:04] flirting with men and women alike and
[2:37:06] doing all kinds of ungodly things. Or
[2:37:08] some of you sisters may be sneaking
[2:37:10] around cutting and trimming off your
[2:37:11] hair or wearing makeup or something like
[2:37:13] that. Do you know that according to
[2:37:16] God's Bible, you cannot enter heaven
[2:37:18] like that, sister?
[2:37:20] Brother, if you're just mean to your
[2:37:22] family, your wife, you're just a
[2:37:23] dictator and everything's got to be your
[2:37:25] way and you're just some old hardhearted
[2:37:28] hard-headed type thing and rule your
[2:37:30] home and weaponize the quotes and just
[2:37:34] live and rule in fear. Do you know the
[2:37:36] Bible said, "My brother, you can't go to
[2:37:38] heaven like that."
[2:37:42] Maybe you're someone sitting in the
[2:37:44] sound of my voice
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; that needs
[2:37:50] real forgiveness in their heart towards
[2:37:51] someone else.
[2:37:55] You're holding some bitterness or some
[2:37:56] grudge. My Christian brother or sister,
[2:38:00] do you know that the Holy Ghost will not
[2:38:02] allow you to do that? How can you love
[2:38:04] God whom you say you've you have not
[2:38:07] seen and not love your brother whom you
[2:38:09] have seen?
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; Some of you women running around doing
[2:38:14] things in the goal of you man doing it
[2:38:16] and then turn around and let your family
[2:38:18] get away with the same things.
[2:38:23] If the angels won't visit you, how can
[2:38:25] Jesus?
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to repent today and
[2:38:29] make your heart right.
[2:38:32] Are you hard-hearted and become so
[2:38:34] stiff-hearted that nothing moves you,
[2:38:36] nothing affects you?
[2:38:39] Well, I can do a few little things and
[2:38:41] dip and lie and cuss and oh, don't
[2:38:43] bother me none. If that's the condition
[2:38:44] of your heart, my brother, the Holy
[2:38:46] Ghost, you have not.
[2:38:50] Sister, if it's gossip all the time and
[2:38:52] you stretch your ear to hear every old
[2:38:53] filthy thing about the church or the
[2:38:55] pastor or somebody else,
[2:38:58] don't call yourself the name Christian
[2:38:59] anymore until you get that straightened
[2:39:01] out.
[2:39:03] cuz the angels of the Lord will not
[2:39:04] visit you and Jesus will not come for
[2:39:07] you if that's the condition of your
[2:39:08] heart.
[2:39:10] And some of you listening to me right
[2:39:12] now, you listen to me good. You may be
[2:39:15] receiving your very last o last
[2:39:17] opportunity to get this straightened
[2:39:18] out.
[2:39:20] So don't you take this lightly.
[2:39:23] Take it seriously with everything that
[2:39:25] lay within you
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; because brother Bram taught us that we
[2:39:29] don't know when the rapture could come.
[2:39:31] Jesus could come before I finish this
[2:39:34] prayer for you.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; You want to be ready.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; I wonder again maybe I'll make another
[2:39:45] call just in light of how the Holy
[2:39:46] Spirit's leading me. There'd be more in
[2:39:49] here that would just say, "Brother Ben,
[2:39:50] you're right. The Holy Spirit's right.
[2:39:53] What you're telling me is true. I've got
[2:39:54] these things in my heart and I need to
[2:39:56] be right with God and I want to put my
[2:39:57] hand up. I'm not ready in this condition
[2:39:59] like I am. Let me try it one more time
[2:40:01] now. Raise your hand to the Lord who
[2:40:03] feel that way.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Sure. There we go.
[2:40:11] I'm going to pray for you now.
[2:40:15] Jesus sees every hand that is raised,
[2:40:17] whether in the back, in the front, in
[2:40:19] the middle, sound room back there, or
[2:40:21] the piano over here, or the music behind
[2:40:23] me, or even the little ones over here in
[2:40:25] this fellowship hall, or those that are
[2:40:27] streaming online.
[2:40:29] God sees every hand that's going up.
[2:40:34] Heavenly Father,
[2:40:37] it's the most important thing
[2:40:43] cuz you told us what shall it profit a
[2:40:46] man if he gain the whole world and lose
[2:40:49] his soul.
[2:40:51] We don't want to be like that, Lord.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; We don't want the pull of this world to
[2:40:58] become so great.
[2:41:00] We don't want the effect and the a
[2:41:03] effect of this world to become so strong
[2:41:06] that we lose our love and our desire for
[2:41:09] the things of God.
[2:41:14] If we have no vision for ourselves,
[2:41:17] we'll perish.
[2:41:20] And all we can do, Lord, is put the word
[2:41:22] before us.
[2:41:25] Let that be our guide. Let that be our
[2:41:27] vision.
[2:41:29] that our hearts
[2:41:31] can be right before you. If our homes
[2:41:34] aren't clean,
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; if our lives aren't clean,
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; you can't come for us.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; I pray for every hand that was lifted
[2:41:44] that said,
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; "I'm not ready to meet you, Lord.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not ready to meet you, Jesus. I pray
[2:41:50] for every hand."
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; God, may your Holy Spirit visit them
[2:41:56] right there where they are.
[2:41:59] You don't need a passport to go to them
[2:42:01] like I did to come here.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; You don't need to go through some travel
[2:42:05] person or some gate agent or some kind
[2:42:07] of border patrol.
[2:42:10] You don't even need anything except for
[2:42:12] them to open the door as it was wrote of
[2:42:16] the little picture that the artist put
[2:42:18] together. And the man criticized said
[2:42:20] the only problem with your Jesus
[2:42:22] standing at the door knocking is there's
[2:42:24] no knob on the outside. He said, "You
[2:42:26] see, sir, the knob is only on the inside
[2:42:30] cuz he cannot come in unless you open
[2:42:32] the door and invite him." Father, may
[2:42:35] these that had their hands raised, Lord
[2:42:38] Jesus, may they open up
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; grab that knob inside their heart as it
[2:42:43] were and turn it and open up the doors
[2:42:46] to welcome you into their life.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; They may not be able to solve every
[2:42:50] problem they got today. They may not be
[2:42:53] able to put behind them every memory and
[2:42:55] every sin and every wrong. Maybe they've
[2:42:57] got cleaning up to do. But Lord, if
[2:42:59] you'll just let them somehow, if they'll
[2:43:02] just open up the door to you and you'll
[2:43:04] just come in there and help them.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; You are the problem solver.
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; and may you move into every heart
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; into every life.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; And may you do your great work. I pray
[2:43:18] Lord Jesus.
[2:43:20] For God hath not appointed us to wrath,
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[2:43:26] Jesus Christ, who died for us,
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; whether we wake or sleep, we should live
[2:43:32] together with him.
[2:43:34] Oh Jesus,
[2:43:37] whether we go by the way of the grave or
[2:43:38] whether we're translated,
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; let us live
[2:43:43] in you.
[2:43:46] Pray you'll move on every heart
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; and every life
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; in the name
[2:43:53] of Jesus Christ.
[2:43:57] Praise the Lord.
[2:43:59] I wonder if those that you had your
[2:44:01] hands raised, maybe you'd just like to
[2:44:03] raise your hands up to the Lord and say,
[2:44:04] "Thank you, Father, for touching me."
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; All of us have got something to praise.
[2:44:13] All of us have got something to be
[2:44:14] grateful about.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; I want each of us just to thank the Lord
[2:44:19] in our own way. Can you
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah?
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; Get us a song ready there, will you,
[2:44:36] sister? Anything you want.
[2:44:42] Maybe the
[2:44:53] return [singing and music]
[2:44:56] for you may be
[2:44:59] [music]
[2:45:01] [singing]
[2:45:02] watching
[2:45:05] and I [singing and music] wait
[2:45:09] Just any day now
[2:45:14] face I'll see
[2:45:17] [music]
[2:45:18] just any day now [singing]
[2:45:23] [music] is
[2:45:29] [music]
[2:45:29] [singing]
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; oh [music]
[2:45:35] for I've been [singing] watching
[2:45:39] And I' been away. [music]
[2:45:43] Oh, just
[2:45:46] [music]
[2:45:48] his face. [singing]
[2:45:52] Just any [music] day. [singing]
[2:45:57] Our Lord is coming.
[2:46:02] will be [singing]
[2:46:03] return.
[2:46:05] [music]
[2:46:07] [singing]
[2:46:11] [music]
[2:46:20] Just [singing]
[2:46:24] [music]
[2:46:26] sing it one more time. [singing]
[2:46:28] Nothing [music]
[2:46:34] [singing] is.
[2:46:36] [music]
[2:46:44] Thank you my Jesus for [singing] I've
[2:46:47] been watching
[2:46:50] and I wait
[2:46:55] just
[2:46:58] [singing and music]
[2:47:04] the day of redemption [music]
[2:47:08] is here. [singing]
[2:47:11] God does.
[2:47:13] Our men's hearts are failing for fear.
[2:47:18] Be filled with the spirit. Your lamb's
[2:47:22] trimmed and [singing] clear. [music]
[2:47:24] Look up. Your redemption. Your [singing]
[2:47:28] redemption is here. Sing it again. Oh,
[2:47:33] the day of [music] redemption.
[2:47:37] Oh
