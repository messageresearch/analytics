welcome all of you so just just really welcome and of course brother Steve and Kathy are good friends and we've known for many years brother Steve worked on the floors in our house and our kids were young and actually his son actually did some of the floors in the church here just amazing amazing family friends and a long time and we just pray that God will bless everybody we're just honored to have Pastor June but just before our pastor comes we want to show you some things we talked about last week and so uh um first off we're going to show you we didn't talk about this last week but we want to show you some things that you are doing as a body of Christ and just for we're not trying to take pastors time he's he's got his Liberty to to preach all that God wants them to we got lots of time this is Pastor Long Dong from the Philippines and if you can make that bigger that would be awesome but this is uh that's a very maybe better if you could see in the middle of that picture sister luanne's in there and Amy I believe Amy's in there but that's a bamboo church I preached that in Mindanao in the Philippines and after that a typhoon took it down and by the way when we say that just remember the Philippines right now they have a typhoon going through right now Pastor he's talked to his wife this morning since we got to church and it's the highest rated typhoon they have never raided it for never they've always been a three they've never read it before amen but a typhoon took this down and so by the grace of God you can go to the next picture we were able to uh build this little building for him a brick building and a steel roof and so it keeps them dry and rainy season we've never finished the windows or doors or that but we were able to do this so I'm going somewhere with this next picture so we had sent money for that's another picture of the church that God helped us put together for him um next pitcher so we had helped he put a parsonage right beside the church and it had no roof and so I sent him some money from the church maybe six months ago and we had did the back half of the roof and by God's grace we had enough that we could finish the roof on his parsonage so there is a steal that you brothers and sisters bought last week for a pastor in Manila in the Philippines for the front half of his house amen and now he he's promised he said I'll send you more pictures when this is on the roof you know we didn't send this till Monday I don't know if there's another one and then there's another picture of the the churches beside it the block building the parsonage is the White House when we were there 100 no 100 of the buildings were bamboo 100 except a little room when I asked the ministers that I would go to the restroom or the washroom or what or they call it the comfort room it's not the comfort room in that country it's called the washroom there or something that was the only building that was not bamboo it was the only concrete block but anyway is there another picture okay and then uh so we have more pictures there and then there's uh then so last Sunday we brought a need of a pastor in uh Uganda that his wife's appendix had ruptured and we were taking them out and we uh we had more than enough people give of you brothers and sisters to this is a sister in the hospital his wife next picture that's her with a lady nurse with her and then so I had the brother I had him I actually this message just says at the top of that message it just says give me the name of the hospital she's in her bed number and you know just for clarification imagine so that's the next one we can go to the next one and that's them back in their house you'll see his wife is still covered with the sheet amen and she was back home by God's grace because in part because of you brothers and sisters that have give to her appendix and that so God's good amen amen God's good amen I really believe you maybe there's maybe one more I don't know if there's yeah you said oh that was just a yeah you can show us that that's a receipt from the hospital that's just what you call accountability amen and so uh so God's really really good amen amen let's just stand and sing that that one song uh more than ever before Lord I love you as our pastor comes God bless you welcome you all just if I start calling names it'll just be go and go

things amen and I would really love to follow the footsteps of of God I mean the line of thoughts of the word that we have been read here this morning so pray for me and pray for my accent Filipino accent hope you can bear with me sometimes I really I really want to you know to to follow your accent but but I'm uh I'm Filipino I know but maybe he used my accent and Pastor Dale and everyone I I hope and pray that God will bless us this morning now I would like to talk to you this morning about this subject you know I hope you see it God create himself so that out of himself he can create all things amen God create himself so that out of himself he can create all things and the scripture that we have real while ago is talking about verse 9 let all the nation be gathered together and that the people be assembled among them then there was a question right there who among them can declare this and show us four more things let them bring forth their Witnesses do that then they may be justified or let them hear and see it is true then verse 10 ye are my Witnesses now you can be a witness without being there I mean you know I used to I used to be a small judge you know in our in our community I I encounter different kind of cases and uh the witness must be present I mean when when things happen okay so you must be there you must be there and he said you are my Witnesses said the Lord and my servant how I believe whom I chosen so the witness was already chosen that you may know the first component yet me know and believe and understand not just knowing not just believing but you must understand I mean because there are people believe and there were people know him amen now that there is God everyone know that that there is God but everyone must come into the knowledge of understanding and there were people try to learn and learn and learn and learn and Paul said to Timothy said ever learning but they will never come into the knowledge of understanding oh I'm sorry I talked fast I want to talk slowly you know would I be excited yeah I wanted to speak slowly I'm sorry for that then right here then before me there was no God form meaning before God come into existence it seems that God before his existed he wasn't there but no we know that God is there the self-existing God was there okay and he wants us to know that this time he said before me there was no God form okay so God had a form before he didn't have formed but God wants to have form amen Nadal shall be after me so there are no other God that was formed neither shall there be after him that was formed that's why I would like to talk that God create himself God formed God create himself so that out of him out of himself he can you know create all all things I hope the Lord will guide help us and I hope oh God I almost two months here and in in Canada I'm just two weeks in the U.S and uh here oh I almost one month and another another another two weeks so almost two months oh I hope the Lord and I saw God moving you know and I saw him guiding you know almost every day Pastor that we've been talking about the goodness of God I know it's so good to know that because yeah oh Hallelujah now let me just I would like to I would like to uh lay a foundation about these thoughts why God create himself all these things we do not know these things I mean never I'm bad never coming to the knowledge of all this that we're talking about we don't know because we were not there amen our existence is right here but we were there but not there we were not there but we were there because we are here it seems that we are there but not there so there was there was a very thin line between this this natural and Supernatural this this the celestial and the terrestrial but that you know that connection that that that God wants to wants us to realize okay he wants us to know so may the Lord help me and help you because as you pull something you know God just you know Channel it I mean behind the small pit praise God that all your maybe your question and your your thoughts maybe Express right here and your question will be answered so I want to talk about the uh the this object and the and the predicates of all this objects would be known amen I hope and pray that all the predicates of this subject because predicates talks about you know the subject amen I'm not a grammarian so now I just I just talk about simple things you know so that we can see the great things because that's the way of God that's the way of God if we will if you will see something great then you're gonna say because it's already great but it will just talk some simple things we can say the great things of God amen because that's really how he unfold himself God rebuilt himself in simplicity so that we can see him in his greatness and His glory amen so these things we did that this before but praise God because the Bible is in Romans 3 verse 10 okay praise that it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand it there is none that seeketh after God they are all gone out of the way they are together become unfit unprofitable there is not do it good no not one so no one seeketh God no one can understand God because he was so great he felt heaven on Earth he was a great Jehovah God in the Old Testament I remember he was the Jehovah that Jehovah is one of the attributes one of his you know one Jehovah is say he say is what we say a immacral terminology it's a it's it's a generic name that's not the proper name of God there were seven confound them of Jehovah the Old Testament on all these things he said the proper name of God so that Jehovah and the Old Testament is the Jesus Christ in the New Testament although there were people so happy in the Old Testament and until now they were still there in the Old Testament but they are they are here you say that just embracing the shadow they don't want the reality so they were just embracing the shadow but praise God by the grace of God we have seen that and now embracing the reality of all the Shadows amen so God said that we are all I mean no one understanded God as it is written there is none that understand that there is not that secret God there is none righteous so why why we come up into this understanding if there's no righteous why what did God do what he did for us because in that next verse 23 Romans 23 for all have seen and come short of the glory of God now let me just die sick this verse verse 23. okay I hope the Lord will help me and help us for all have sinned past tense all as I said no one is righteous there is none righteous no even one you know because for all have sinned and come short of the glory of that the word come shirt means you have the glory before but you lose it you lose it so this time we'd like to speak simple things basic things but sometimes basic is just you know will lead you to a deeper things amen the ABC they always believe Christ ABC not the ABC alphabet but whatever it takes whatever it takes you always believe God thick or tense have or nothing still believing God that's ABC healthy or not healthy still you believe God that ABC amen rain or no rain that's ABC summer or winter that ABC because you always believed God okay then he said for all meaning oh that's a Double L all hub sent past tense and come shirt of the glory of God now before now we we are all born in sins and shipping inequity speaking lies amen now sisters when you bring forth your child did he see your child lapping after you deliver a baby is a child laughing after you deliver he's crying yeah cry why why but because job talking about that he said all that was born by woman are full of trouble and Beauty so you know Furious meaning all that was born of a woman is full of trouble see he said and even hit cars you know even even job he calls his birthday and sometimes we have spend money for our birthday now I'm not against birthday next week will be my birthday you are invited yeah let the people especially when the age of Liberty came you know the age of Liberty Ethan oh I'm now a lady I'm the Man I'm a young now I'm fully young I'm a oh and sometimes we spent more money about it but but you cars his birthday so now the reason why God wants to redesign you he wants you to recreate you okay because the first creation we have you know he's a sinner okay for all I've seen that's why the Bible said we are all captured of the glory That Glory that was in the hands of our father is lost he found it when you lose it the glory and when the glory was you know was lost all that was born is under cars do you know that sisters you know that you have the seven cycle the first cycle is the first seven years the second cycle is second year the second cycle is third is the 21 years old and the last cycle is 49 something like that okay and you know uh uh our body is different from your body you know why the woman is uh when they have when they start bringing forth children your body start to defile you know you know that if you are a Coca-Cola body I mean small hips and then but we start bringing four children then you are become healthy that's a good term healthy meaning winning yeah why you know why because the Bible says so that sin you know that was in you that was in US defile this body and the women leaders women is is easily defiled when they start to bring forth children the men the men the the male the male part even though we are already you know or rather you see that still young I'm 64. but still you know just kidding just to make you not that's why because the cars that we have is not directly but the woman was direct you know was direct it was the womb of the woman was Cars ectopic pregnancy they have cancer because God cars because of that sin that we have from the beginning it's because aim you know because of what she did in the beginning I mean when when Adam hit the fruit of the ground then the cars start to enter in our body male male creation but but the female creation was direct directly cars by God that's why when you bring forth your children it's so hard tough and almost almost my my wife almost you know with the first born that we have Sister Abigail and holding his neck right here he almost destroyed my you know it's so hard because that's the cause of God but praise God praise God the firstborn that we have is not enough to go to heaven that's why this verse I would like to dissect this like I hope the Lord will help us and I hope the Lord will you know give us an understanding about this okay so something lost from human race That Glory there was a pastor when I when I when I have a seminar with the pastors from the denomination I asked them I said Jesus came and redeemed us what was Adam lost our father all things that Adam lost promised Authority promise right to the Earth this Earth this Earth hello said and he strike his Dominion lose it and his godship godship being the small God he was the god of the physical creation he lose it he lost every bit of it you know the the you know the uh what we call this mosquitoes the mosquitoes before the no dinghy no virus but when the cars came the lion did not eat animals now the crocodile did not eat no they have they have food for them the lion they have food for them but when man fall their God the small God was full uh you see that the lion kills buffalo deer everything and everything was full Now That Glory that's generic terminal the word Glory it could be salvation it could be your peace it could be you can name it so man lost from where he was man is out of his possession amen the thing that God gave to him that he must possess it he lose it he looks at everything that God given even you know now eternal life did not lost from Adam it was Adam lost from eternal life you're going to lose eternal life because it's it's Eternal no you're gonna lose that so Adam lost from eternal life the prophet said the Bible said that Adam perfected every bit of it the three Realms of Adam was you know lost his title did today Earth this Earth this Earth is lost you know before he can speak the mountain and transfer it to another in fact he named all the creation I mean the physical creation he named after the the nature of an animals when he called the lion is a lion is really a lion because Adam knew the nature when he's when he called the name Buffalo he knows that a hard worker Buffalo when he when he called the name it's a cow because a burdenberry I don't know it so that authority over the creation was lost okay now when Adam lost these three things the three the the his rights to the Earth his Dominion and he lost his rights to eternal life so this thing is so something something uh something deeper I I want to speak shallow because Adam we know he was created in the image of God and he had eternal life he was not mortal but right after he commits sin he become like as we are mortal and we're going into immortality but Adam he was Immortal but going to mortality that something is something deeper but I hope we because of the cars because for all have sinned that Romans straight to the tree actually we are just the product of that verse but the one who commits sin is Our Father Abraham I know Adam we were in his loins right here and we were also in the loins of God every man male man we have two loins the first loan we have is our thoughts loins loins of the spirit okay mind then the physical is loins we have sons and daughters that's why God wants to express this these things from his loins from his mind so Adam right after the fool that's why if you can just if we have just timer to draw the outer man's body and the second one is the spirit and the Third Realm is the soul okay so all his rights from these three Realms was totally lost lost now when he lose it when you lose it someone squat this body I will okay I don't want to read it because you know my time will be consumed you know someone you know you know that what is squatter he poached her someone squat this body it's no longer the owner of the body you know if you have if you have a house and you let them rent the renter will not take care about the house but if you're really the owner you're going to take care of it feed it once in the morning dress it in the morning make it grow me you know because you're the owner of the house but this quarter came you know and put all these things I'm sorry if you have this I'm not I'm not referring to you Mark there tattoo here faster everything because they are not really the original owner of the house I'm sorry is there anybody here tattoo I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not referring to you I'm talking about this quarter of this house okay so I'm talking about the literal house and talking to the this house that we have okay now someone scored this squat this house okay now God wants to you know restore back to the owner that's why the word here all have seen and come short meaning meaning that glory is no longer in the hands of men now we can we can Define the word redemption or restoration atonement because we we must believe that something lost amen you must believe that something is in the pawn shop it's no longer in your possession and you cannot you cannot redeem it it has to do with the Redeemer say uh the cross is right there so you can see the cross is empty because he wasn't there anymore he wasn't there anymore I said the crown of thorn right there inside you see so someone squat this land amen now uh I hope I can consume all your your time okay I was just making a foundation making a foundation I hope the Lord will help me okay now there was a day that the time that the owner of the land must come now I would like to share something the type and Shadow you know praise God now Israel most of the Israelites was born in Egypt that's why Egyptian was so insecure because they become overpowered of this you know on some day the Chinese growing up in Canada yeah even in Auckland and New Zealand the Chinese growing up if you're in the Philippines growing up okay and you know I don't want to tell the story about it so someone really owned this land and other Adam lost it and Adam could you know Adam tried to get back but he was not qualified it's just like it's just like the brother of Boaz I know if you remember it uh that eliminate eliminate both set to offer to eliminate because he was the firstborn but eliminix said I can do it if I do that militants my inheritance will be mired marred meeting in trouble I can do that then boys said okay if you can do it I will do it I will do it so someone is qualified and someone relative to the word would come it should be our kinsman redeemer I would like to say more deeper about relative to the world because there's something you know oh I love that but I just want as I said yes percentage in a shallow terminology so Our Redeemer came and brought us I mean redeem us the word demise to bring us back to our original possession so you must know what was your position before the meaning of redemption so the first the original situation original position that Adam has that Adam was perfectly United with God he can talk to God God can come down and fell asleep with Adam lip to ear lip to air anytime you see that Dimension is so close the third and the sixth Dimension is so close together and there's no barriers about it what I mean is the spiritual your spiritual the the distance of God and you is not is that far it's so close before okay I just show you the the the the uh the former condition of Adam that that was his condition before the fall came but right after the full now this morning maybe there were brothers here that really read what the prophet said you can talk to me and brother Richard where did you get the coach I will give you I will give you okay let me just speak about it so these things you know when Adam lose it someone till the ground and any things the squatter wants to to do you know he did it for so many years but there will come a day called a jubilee okay you know this Jubilee we have uh Independence Day here is that July okay liberation were liberated from other you know colony Philippine store we are liberated from the Spanish that's why most of us are you know I have Spanish name Roberto that's my name pardelio okay that's my name so because we are you know colonized before then come to Japanese again but praise God MacArthur came and liberated Philippines from the hands of you know Japanese and oh praise the Lord we are liberated and when that declaration came one returned back to their own poor session now you know before you can place that position you have to position something yes yes all right let's see where you you were just there as you know but if you can possess something to be qualified in that position oh my uh you can do it you can do it so Jubilee King and this quarter must off the land you have to go away okay so Israel the origin the original place of Israel was in Canaan we know that and Moses was commissioned to bring the people back the word back meaning they were the before and we were here we have to go back meaning we were hello we were there before we have to go back so where were you what what is your what is your meaning for there if you were there because if you were not there you're gonna go back there he that is from heaven will go back to heaven Judas was from hell he go back to hell we are from Heaven We Came From Heaven we will go back to heaven but we did that came from heaven but we were but we did not but we were but we did not the 16 element body did that came there this body came from my mother and father he said this is the product of you know agreement of your father and mother you see that so God wants to be to restore all these things then God speak to Moses Moses bring back my people to the promised land I repeat they were all born in Egypt but the scripture said Moses bring back my people you say that so out of these people out of this land out of this man God had something in this okay now before before Moses can bring thee back you don't you know that there were people who squat their land the amorites the parasites do you know that this body that you have you know that's why we have the Bible required your second birth because the first birth is not enough you see that so before Moses can bring thee back there they have to eliminate they have to take away they have to demolish all these squatter in Canaan to all these amorites the parasites the parasites the the Hittites do you know the Hittites people that hits the tights now all these people that were squat the land of Israelites King and approach all you know the boundary the demanded system that they put right there we have we have five inlets in the spirit we have memory the the uh the uh what we call this it's so easy to memorize because the acronym Micra memory emotion uh conscience reasoning affection okay and that and the most things that you that your enemy is your your memory because you try to confess everything you try to renew that you want to be that memory keep on reminding you keep on ringing on your mind that you are guilty you are guilty you are guilty although you are confused Lord forgive me but anytime that memory will be open I'm sorry I speak fast again okay okay anytime that the devil tried to open that memory uh you know sometimes during your Elementary days high school days if you can meet them I said I remember you you did something wrong with me it's it's that AC you know it's that AC but praise God God provide the instrument you can delete it or if you wanted to copy and paste to Satan copy right click then praise to Satan go back you know what God did to us God help us to download to download right here and upload right here did unloading and uploading has come now we hop we have now the right click you see and God guide us he gave us a spiritual GPS and guide us well the way that he wants us to walk amen you will not go astray because God give you that spiritual GPS and that's the Holy Ghost [Applause] so Moses bring these people back to the promise then you know the story if you can type it if you can if you can parallel that events it's really you can see that in the shipment or Jesus from Egypt to the promised land it's a similar genius oh all the stages we can see that so they start troubling and the Bible said when Moses starts the heart of peril you know he have compassion with Israelites if the hands of God take off from the heart of peer of peer will become you know brutal you know killer so Pirro is you know Piro he has no choice I would say it's like it's just like Peter didn't have a soul because he wants to do but he cannot and Paul you know cutscene the revelation of people he said Piro is just like a clay Roman Stein Peter he was just a clay if you want to read that chapter 9 of Book of Romans he said he said Piro is just like a clay what if God wants to mold the clay to honor him and wants to move another clay to dishonor him he was talking about Piro and he said who are you to try to find fault against God so we cannot blame Avery oh everything that happened in this life we cannot blame God I like what sister Carter said he said I believe that God has a purpose of these things for brother still I love that he was she was a Bible reader that's not ordinary thing no because when when Paul knows that there's something there there were people that could complain against God that's why he said who are you to find fault against God what if God wants to willing to show his wrath and his Mercy what is this to you the chapter that that chapter chapter nine but if you'll reverse that chapter 8 he said all things work together for good yeah that's why because chapter nine details what was happening in chapter eight and if you will just you know try to try to read it slowly from chapter 6 chapter 7 chapter 8 chapter 9 you can see all how God's really a gracious God because the love contrasts you know so Paul cuts the revelation who was this hero you know why Paul write that because one day he tried to resess the will of God he was Saul before but all things that he tried to write is his experience he experienced it how to resist the power of God until only God smed him to Blind blind him Acts chapter 9 you see that that's a win her right pull his the scripture oh it's full of experience he said who are you try to ask God so Paul will he write that oh really I I told you last Wednesday about the glimpse of this what I'm talking about bully cuts the revelation that even The Unborn son he knows he said oh the election must turn he has to God has to decide who will be and hold it be who will be saved who will not be saved that while Paul writing on this he said he said it is written that he said Jacob love isaw I mean Jacob and hate no love Jacob and no he said I hate Jacob now that verse is not pertaining to to to to to to what's this uh Esau you see that so Paul cuts the mind what was in the mind of God he cuts the mind he said you must have the mind of Christ he said oh I he said it was written so well where was written it was in the Bible is that it's the literal Bible it was written right here because he was talking about predestination chapter nine you see that so Paul's Soul these things said that God worked in both ends I love that God work in both end when you start and your ending he does you he keeps you he keep you safe from the beginning you will die right there but he God knows that someday that someday he will you will response the word he keeps you safe even from the beginning do you know that God before your birth before before your mother delivered you there was an angel watching you to catch you and even before your death before you you you give up the ghost someone right there waiting to catch you too so God will not you know he will not allow you to be peerless oh I love that Hallelujah so Paul you know God for God God walked or full his beginning he's beginning and he's ending you're starting on your end that he work with that's why we win win win win win ananias when we speak to ananias and then yes you know I love the brother I said Lord he was Criminal but a murderer but God saw you God saw you one day he keep you safe even from your from your in your Elementary High School College he keep you safe there were accidents that I might be dying I might die but God keep me safe because one day 1979 December 15. I would hear his word that's the time I was baptized in 1979 I'm not too old I'm still young okay because God knows you before even before your existence he knows you and he tells you because God knows you before before you were born God knows you that when that year is come like this year 2012 that day that man that year he will hear his word and you will respond his word and you will follow his word and you will serve him that's why he keeps you safe even before your birth there's a new thing happen right here in this world no new things so sometimes you you will see yeah maybe I heard because someone invited me no no that invitation is just an instrument so that you can walk the path of the way of God down to his you know his program his plan for you [Applause] so God will not look after your what how Wicked you are how how bad you are but he's looking your representation right here in his mind and that when your season is come someone will oh you know If That season is come someone will come to you and will remind you the word remind you will you were there in his mind and now someone came to remind you [Applause] you see that when you heard it you response because you were in the mind of God I remember the male factor in the right hand of God when when they were at the cross what did he say Lord remember me so God no need to remember him it's already in his mind and he said because he says on a scam not during the day of his criminal works right here but right there at the cross that's his season then Jesus said right now I will you will go with me in Paradise [Applause] that's his right season you know sometimes there were things happen that will push you to realize that you really need God in your life why this sickness and diseases comes in our life because God wants you to realize that he is our healer God is our comforter so he permits distress and sadness to make you smile if you already smile how can I smile how can you make a smile if you're already full how can I feed you if you're not thirsty how can I let you drink if you're happy how can I could make you happy if you are saved how can I proceed savior you know so all these things work out I mean he permits all these things just to you know just to push you to the spot where he can contact you amen so all these trials problems God just permit posing you you know sometimes God puts you into an unboxed area so that you can see how he protect you because if you are right there in your comfort zone and will protect it how could God can operate his attribute as protector how could God Express being a ship your savior if you are already the same uh uh can we give him one another Applause for him [Applause] so Moses come and before before they possess the promised land before he the you know possession all the Dwellers in that promised land was killed that's why that's why this quarter must of the land pastor am I the squatter before am I it seems that I'm still the same before I was converted and now I'm it it looks like the same no no the Bible said sir Corinthians 5 17. If any man be in Christ I would say he's a new creature all things are passed away now reward all things it doesn't mean repair is that the old creature made over no no it's not a repair no no it's a new creature it's a new creation Pastor I have the same body it seems It's I I still the same no what are those things that becomes new in your life not this no not this one do you know when you have a dream and in your dream there was something run after you and you keep on running in your dream when you wake up the penetration your dream is right here you know right there someone run after you but the impact is right here maybe every one of us had a dream right so the impact that I someone you know drive this land before which we do not know that there was a man drive this before that's our old you know our old nature well it's up to you if you want to hold it you can call in anyone you'd call it because the prophet's military terminology old man old nature old soul a lot of any if you are happy to use that old terminology Okay so the things first that was changes your mind now you send your children to the Kinder right right then as they hear the teacher in our in our country the first thing that they learn is how to say good evening yeah papa good evening oh really you knew that our teacher told us they were just here the teacher okay then they learn about ABC ABC you see that then did they learn how to identify Ness my shoulder my head then proper way of singing and action is come you see that wow you know what is your where is your head what they were doing you were just hearing then because you're a good hearer you'll be promoted into Elementary still good hearer you will just you know hearing the one day High School one day you were in college still hearing but in college is something different because there was a Critic professor okay there was a Critic professor and criticize you you must admit his critics okay because before you place into the States you must pass all this critics and Jesus was to criticized at the cross make him naked you know you see Jesus At The Cross you have something right here but the truth is no he was totally naked because his punishment is a capital punishment but in our picture you have covered he admit all the critics then one day he was promoted you see that now after the critics all that you hear we were just hearing we were in college but one day you become an engineer by just hearing you promote as a manager by just hearing you become a doctor by just hearing you become well-known you know just by hearing this is it the word that here that we hear that word will redesign our life that will inform us that our you know the first one that feeling this body I mean the first the the first one that squat this body must off this body then one day Israel pushes the land yeah you know the story the world trumpets first day they just going around on the seventh they have seven times then blow the trumpets we have seven one two three four five six seven trumpets gospel trumpets yes gospel trumpets then one day we are we are we are in the bandage of religion and denomination we are all slain of our religion and all people claim to be the right one everyone so people were confused but one day there will be a summoning of trumpets Jubilee to do Wherever You Are through the hole and the speed you are not free the date of Independence come amen the squatter must off the land that you'll realize that you have already restored back to your original land at the day and try to oh I tried to fix myself I want to do this this is the will of God so I want to follow because that time you'll realize that you are not you are not of your own someone owns you oh I love that so I used to write pushes the land the same as we have also learned the seven dispensation now I'd like to say something this might be I hope if this is not right a pastor Dell is here he can iron out everything he's your pastor don't worry I will not convert you I just share something that one person so I I told the brothers in America I said I was just your brother or I was just an armpit part of the body I would be happy and as long as I'm part of the body I would be happy yeah something bad smell I need you to run it's okay it's okay as long as I know that I'm a part of a body okay now that's seven trumpets gospel trumpet there was a trumpeters that's seven trumpet Gathering all the trumpets it's no longer one term but it's the seven trumpets inside that one trumpet I repeat the seven trumpets in one trumpet the seven voice and one voice the seven eights in one age called The Bride AIDS okay what I mean is we have to realize that God has something special in this AIDS this is not an ordinary AIDS this is not also a literal AIDS this is a supernatural AIDS out of the ages okay and now God wants us to realize that he wants to redesign us okay that all of us that to us in his thoughts that we were there we have to go back there that there is two things that there okay I heard a Pastor said we have to go back to the word where back to the thoughts oh back to the thoughts you say yes I said no but yes but no and the prophet said the message says that we have to go back where we were now if you can read the book Christ The Mystery of God Revel I did not see my notes anymore mix me delay praise the Lord amen we have to go back where we were now what was the original position of Adam he walked with God in a perfect body with a fellowship that's where we were before okay now all that to us in God he poured Antichrist okay and all that was in Christ he poured and to ask the brother church now let me just let me just uh what we call this slowly okay dissing it slowly chop it slowly okay you must believe that you were there if you were not there you are not here now it depends up under there it could be there or there if you came from there you will go back there but if you came from God you will go back to God now someone said to me Pastor John brother June how could I know if I came from God well you know as I told sister Kathy the birds fly not to become Birds I serve God because I came from God okay if I did that came from God uh I will not do the things of God the fish swim not to become Fists you are born in it the maple tree did not struggling to become unbuffled no the nature and the species testify who are you you didn't become long stop you are long stop too big to start with you see so what you have now is just the product of being a long stop okay now if you are came from God if you came from God Son of God you can't help him you can help yourself I want to swim no you have wings to fly I want to swim no you are not in the right position I will come to you and pick up your nose you have to fly you have the wings was given to you to fly so you didn't become bird no we didn't become seed we were said we did not become Sons and Daughters of God we were sons and others of God at the moment you realize that you are sons of God duties of God you can help yourself you know have you seen the birds that keep on flying it's a small bird if the birds can complain that bridge will complain Lord why you create me soon you know I I want to risk no you are created to fly so you have to fly you are created to serve God you can help yourself because down in your heart there were you know God will put something in your heart you did not say God it God it's God seeking you you didn't I want to be good no there's no God because all things are bad born in sin speaking lies you know shipping inequity but someday you know time comes and we realize oh this is not my world I want to serve you Lord you see so oh let me just one there's a thought right here I love this stuff I love this thought it says here he said God condescending to his creation hold it up God wants to be worshiped the word means the word god means object of worship you know that if and it's God trying to condition his people he tried to condition us okay his people that he can get from them what he created them for he want to pull something that was in you okay God wants to get something what is that something you want you to serve him so but you do not know yet before we do not do that because someone squat this land okay someone squat this land okay the original condition of Adam was lost and God came to return back that's why the word redeemed so bring us back what was in the pawnshop we cannot redeem it so he came at the cross two thousand years ago being you know if you're gonna pay your bill literal bill that bill will be cut off you have to pay for it to restore now that relation of God to Adam and Adam to God was cut up it had to be paid for the blood so Jesus came and paid the connection now the connection being restored being restored and we realize Who We Are we realize that we are now in our possession the lights restored you are not in your own land and the squatter is of the sin get out I am the original owner of this land so Jesus first thing is you have to know the prophet said you have to know that you lost something you know there was a pastor I said what was what kind of items you lost that Jesus restored back to you did the Pastor said pastor it's my salvation that I I say when did your salvation lost then he said oh ten years ago I was saved I received him as my savior but until now I didn't lost my salvation so you do not know what you're asking for Prophet said you have to know that you lost something and Jesus bring it back to you if I lost my wristwatch I know that my watch is wrist watches in the pawn shop if somebody come I didn't lose it and said past brother June this is your no look he's here hello I know you you know I know you're thinking about it you think about it I just called whatever rabbit said you know what he said Redemption really means to bring us back now now these things what he did for us because he said he wants us he said God is just trying to condition his people because you are out of the condition he wants to condition his people that he can get from them what he created them for he never will beat you he never made you to be something else beside his son and daughters of God so why when these things came to our mind to my mind I realized where did I serve where did I where did I dedicate myself to God or to Satan if he designed for me if he wants me to realize that he did not create something else that he created me as Sons and Daughters of God where did I serve now so I make up myself I said oh thank you Lord I have to return back over I was I have to know that my father and mother was just an instrument for me okay put his body okay and when I realized now I know that I am not but I am but I am not their sons and daughters but I am en I am not but I am it's safe that you have but you have not it seemed that we're not sitting in human places but still right here in this Tabernacle it takes a revelation it's a condition we're not sitting in Heavenly places it's a condition if we've got the clarity of Revelation then we can we can drive this you know where to go amen where am I to open myself I may offer myself to the word or to God so that attributes that came from God in his mind okay the thoughts the attribute okay all this I I love this stuff if you if you can go with Pastor Dale in Toronto for a convention I have to you know details that more the stuff okay all that to us in God Where's God right there in the dimension it's a dimension again it's a condition again seventh Dimension and he alone was there what he did he create first you know himself because he wants to create man in His image but he himself don't have image yet so he had created an Amex before he can create man all his amens can you see him into that so he created himself make an amidst and that image is his son okay now right here he couldn't descend to his creation under sixth Dimension now in this sixth Dimension is the place of expression place of expression place of creation and place of manifestation not this no no no no not this not this Dimension six so the first creation that was made is not right here in the seven it was right in the sixth dimension and the first thing that was created is God himself he formed himself You Must Believe you must know and believe and understand that there was no other God that was formed so now God had a form amen will he create that form someone came out from him when someone came out from him he became a father see that that's why when your wife delivered your firstborn the doctor said brother you are now a father yet you are a son because how could he be a father without a son and how could you be a son without a father so the Oneness and the tallness and the threeness was confused because they were just looking at two but just one creation but it's too but it's one but it's two but it takes a revelation do you know that you are not a thoughtful being when you receive God in yourself you are not a thoughtful being one is you you are not eating Heavenly Heavenly food that they send them eating for your tummy you know so you are no double I mean you are you are now too for being one being to eat and die and one being and will never die while eating spiritual food you will never die while eating this body is still eating the steak and uh wife of sister Dallas oh like a ship why are you still eating you will die someday but you're spiritual well you will never die so when you receive it you become a TOEFL being being then the war is begins before uh there is no passing I want to do this you will do it right away I want to go there you know no problem no one will stop you do you know that going to hell is that AC I repeat it again do you know that going to hell is not easy a murderer adulterer limit that will that cause you to go to hell oh brother June hold your peace anything that's bought before your eyes that will not cause you to go to hell it's not easy to go to hell if anyone go to hell God will blockage your area God will block you there he don't want you because you sit right here he never made you to be something else he made you to be Sons and Daughters of God so if anyone wants to go to hell God will block him don't go there God sent someone to say you you know the word of God is this the word of God is this it's an essay now to go to hell he says it's hard you have to reject the word for your day then that's it that will qualify you to go not your ass including myself I repeat it's not easy to go to hell you have to reject the word that you have heard because the thing that you have heard will place you somewhere we are just hearing the word seven times the Bible said an ear let him here what the messenger now what the spirit but it was the messenger but the spirit you say again you see that it was not the message you're speaking it's a spirit but it was it takes a revelation to recognize that it was that brother John speaking no it was a Pastor Dale it was a man speaking it was not it was the Holy Spirit flowing to the mouth of the speaker then that voice is that the voice of man that boy is the voice of you see so going to hell is that easy you have to reject you have to speak you have to blaspheme the Holy Ghost for you to go to hell now killing murdering adultery is just the result of being an unbeliever okay you do that because that's the product of being an unbeliever amen again because the specie of that man is unbeliever so what are the fruits of course what are the things all this is just a worldly things will just follow because that's to us his PC now get UPS had something special for you you came from God God bless you that seed I mean by means of your hearing we were just heard this word I'm just a wordless singer before I used to you know I tried to follow the the face of nilian Hey My My Apollo you know imagine there is no Heaven you know all these things are just the product you need a title manufacture no you did manufactured it the product is automatic because you are an unbeliever now the old things the old nature the old man the old way the old system is gone you are not new creation so the same face although a little bit old the same body but it's new right here Paul said be not conformed into this world what was next but be it transformed by what by the renewing so the renewing it has to do it our mind you see we were just hearing the word every Sunday behind us and you will surprise because the thing that you used to do oh you will never do it anymore [Applause] you know before I was a dancer brother strut oh I have my own sound system and then oh did the people look like I'm so proud but now I say oh how pity am I before and I will not do that anymore that's not his design for me to do you see it's him this is not our work anymore this is God's work this is not our efforts this is God's efforts okay so all that to us it starts being manifested right now now let's well it's 12 o'clock five minutes more I'm not I'm not like Pastor Cindy it's two hours three hours now we were in the touch of God Express right here in the sixth dimension thoughts all that to us in God is right here in this dimension okay and the first creation that was made is Christ the logos the theophany the Sun the sun okay he said he wants to be a father so that that that that that that identity has to do with the Sun so right here is the John 10 30. I and my father are one you see that and this is right here exclusion to verse 9. God but the God had manifested in the right not flesh yet not flesh yet in that word when he stepped down here in flesh formed the same I and my father won the same Quran to verse 9. manifested In the Flesh now you being the attributes you are the attributes someone would and has to speak your representation because you were in the thoughts Pastor cuts the mind the prophet and the prophet cuts the mind of God you see and the pastor speaks the word you heard it when you heard it you realize who you are Ah that's hard that's that's hard statement but that's the truth if you never heard about the word you will never know who you are [Applause] praise God I Know Who You Are if the bride knew who she is then she will know who she was your host yours is in the thought now you are who who you are who you are now because you realize the manifestation the thoughts come into material materializing his body or being and walk with God thank you you know I don't want to mixtape tired and all of you I know this is just the beginning Pastor hedeli said you will have cup meeting one day right there in the workshop oh it's good to have brother sisters I'm so happy to see you and my advocacy is the same with your pastor I want you to be in your position I want every Minister's realize also their possession that's why there was there were trouble because they tried to make the ears put right here put their nose right here Paul tried to eliminate this barriers I'm not the body because I'm the nose no we are working in one we are part of the body I'm a body but when this part put into the body I'm not a body anymore I'm just a part of the body that I would be happy if I'm just an armpit and I need you know you to run I would be happy as long as I know that I'm a part of you amen so well it's 12 o'clock may the Lord bless you may the Lord bless us remember me in your prayer Trinidad and Puerto Rico and I want to be just apart you know one percent of it of that convention shall we all stand can we sing the song Jesus I love you glorify his name amen can you give me a key sir Jesus we love love you [Music] worship and [Music] adore glorify his name glow we fight his name and all the Earth [Music] we glorify your name father we love you father we love you we worship [Music] [Music] fire by your name glorify your name we grow goodbye [Music] Lord Jesus we thank you for this wonderful word that we heard this morning Lord Jesus we thank you Jesus for election and your word Lord Jesus and we thank you Lord Jesus that we came from you Lord God we thank you that our scales fell off our eyes we recognize that we didn't belong here and you're pulling us back like the magnet to your very self Hallelujah love you with all of our hearts bless your beautiful bride here this morning and we give you the glory and honor for it your beautiful name Lord be with our fellowship after Lord Jesus and our food and just may we be able to enjoy each other's company Lord Jesus in your name we pray amen I'd like to sing the song I Feel the pull I apologize for the church being cold you uh the cold blood person showed up this morning and he thinks it's warm in the winter time and we do actually have a furnace in the church but we thought it was still summertime we will actually turn it on amen but God forgive us for being so cold amen and let's just sing this song I I really hope you'll stay we'd like to shake your hand and say hi and enjoy there's just abundance we had an abundance of spiritual food first and we fed our spiritual man our spiritual soul and there's lots of physical food too amen amen let's just sing this song as we're dismissed I [Music] did not cry cry [Music] [Laughter] I can't explain it with tongue [Music] deep within it must be God it's here in my soul cause I feel the poor Hallelujah Lord Jesus [Music] I hear the call Hallelujah and I know his spirits [Music] to me and I agree Lord please come and take control I feel [Music] he was right on a high play hallelujah thank you Jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus I back home and I know his spirits [Music] in me and I agree Lord please come and take control Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus God bless you your dismissed thank you Lord Jesus
