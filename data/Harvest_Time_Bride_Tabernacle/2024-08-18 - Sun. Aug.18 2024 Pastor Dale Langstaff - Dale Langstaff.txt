back in his house today amen and me and Lan we uh canceled Wednesday service we went to uh a family friends funeral of Lan and just pray that you remember the family and Lan that's just a uh just I mean uh so you understand Lan's family Lan was born about 10 years after her siblings so all her brothers and sisters left home and when Lan was nine her mom got very sick and her dad left and this was the family that Lan lived with traveled with they were evangelists and singers and uh so they were very special to Lan amazing people they were part of our wedding and all those things so it wasn't it wasn't family per se and it wasn't just a casual acquaintance but it was somebody that was very dear to Lan for many many years in her life and amen so you know chapters of our life close because most of their family don't even recognize me and Len they they they wouldn't know who Lan was if she was a stranger but her oldest daughter told Lan for weeks before she died she was asking is Lan coming today L coming today amen it's just it's funny how chapters of our life the young ones come up and the and they don't know they don't know the old people or the old phones or old things amen life moves on and amen but we just praise God for the opportunity to serve him amen and be a part of his kingdom we also are very grateful for all the wonderful experiences we had with brother Bartley here and camp meeting and the two weeks was amazing you all were amazing the the the presence of God was amazing and it was a a good good uh uh I believe I I've turned it on if it's a amen am I on yeah amen we just thank God remember Pastor barley he went home to a house with no running water no electricity and no internet I've not received one message from them since I left them at the airport amen just remember them I do know he arrived safely I found that out through junior's wife but sometimes things that we take for granted here are not for granted there you know you know you know when you see a a minister come and travel you know it's like we had much Great Fellowship in our house with them and and for him it's the same in his church as it is every church around the world you know he he in their place he stopped having Wednesday night services because many of the people come to the church are single sisters and they would get robbed on the way home from church and then their unbelieving husbands would blame him so he has a Bible study online amen it's just you know you sometimes we get an opinion that you know it's just uh something but it's it's maybe different than what you think you amen it's just a different but amen but it's a great great uh great opportunity so just pray for me and Lan we're actually going today to Newland and uh we kind of held that before the Lord and so uh you know we had prayed and thought about it we're going to see brother Carson and sister Sharon and sister Donna and and uh you know we we tossed it around toss it around toss it around and and and uh uh we finally made a day where I told Lan I said if you go back to the airplane tickets and they're the same price or less we'll go but if they're a penny more we won't go and they were actually much less or some less and so we she uh purchased them and we're looking forward to that so maybe we'll stand and just uh looking forward to what God has for us let's turn to Galatians 4 Galatians 41-7 and and uh just looking forward I want to preach on adoption through marriage and if I had a second title it' be a name change and a name change and now I say that the heir as long as is a child differeth nothing from the servant though he is Lord of all but under tutors and governs until the time appointed of the father and even so we we were children in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time come God sent his son and made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that they might receive the receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God has set forth his Spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefor Thou Art no more servants but Sons for if a son than an heir of God through Christ let's just read another scripture here as I scroll back and find GL uh Genesis 2 Genesis 2:21 and 24 just and the Lord caused and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God took from the man he made he a woman and brought her onto the man and Adam said now this is bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of a man there therefore shall a man leave his mother and father and shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one flesh Lord Jesus we pray that you'll add the blessing on the word Lord God and Lord as you Minister this morning I pray that the people will receive it as you showed it and brought it to me Lord Jesus we pray and bless your bride around the world and the servants and as the word Goes Forth this weekend and your beautiful name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning you know as our scripture there in Galatians talks about the adoption of sons and we you know you've heard that preach multiple times and and there's so many different ways that you could go with that but I want to uh you know in the adoption of sons you you deal with immaturity and you deal with lots of different things uh that would consider a young a young person a young man a young child that would be born into a family family but we know and so I want to look at the adoption in a different way than than as a young person but we know that we came from God that we're going to go back to God but we but but through the fall of sin he came to redeem us back and you know we're living in a world in a realm of spirits around us that we rub shoulders with and so times have changed and our day and we have a day with no commitment we have a day that people don't commit to their work people don't commit to each other people just shack up the reason people shack up is not because they don't love each other because they're not attracted but because they have zero commitment it's just what's good for me for today and if it's bad for me tomorrow I'm out of this opportunity amen but we cannot serve God like that and you know the last time I ministered I preached on being converted and here here the prophet showed how how he said to Peter he said when you're converted stengthen the Brethren now this was somebody that had walked with Jesus the prophet said he was saved and Sanctified he had been given the power to cast out demons and evil spirits and heal the sick and you know the disciples come back to Jesus and they were rejoicing because even the Devils were were uh you know receptive to them and and they bow and Jesus said those powerful words he said Rejoice not that the Devils respond to you but Rejoice that their name is in the Lamb's Book of Life and our Prophet talked about you know the the popular evangelist when we were when we were in Indiana I bought a book and I'm going to put it at the church after I read it myself and that but it was in the the era of like the 42 to 60 there 45 to 65 and it and it's just unbelievable the move of God that was in the country in Revival and it it took literally thousands probably tens of thousands the books a big book tens of thousands of newspaper clips of Revival services that were all week Revival Services 10 Revival services and this is how this was a standard equipment in the newspaper it was said the church couldn't hold them there was an an ected amount of crowds huge that was a that was a move of God and the Revival of that day was unexpected but in our day it's not like that because there's no commitment it's not that people don't love God it's not that people didn't come from God but our Prophet said when those evangelists they would come and they would have 20,000 or 30,000 and they come back a year later there'd be five people in the church he said they didn't go far enough said you didn't take take them on to Christ you got them saved they love God they love the word they obey the word that they believe the word I mean sorry Satan believes the word too but he's not going to be in heaven and you know when Pastor Bley was here he talked he read scriptures and I'm going to read one of them and and there's a scripture in John where it talks about those that keep the word and there's another one in John that says those that hear the word and the hear the word it's not just the definition of hear but hear is to understand and to do amen it's not just about believing that there's a God and you know we believe this message the devil believes this message amen lot lots of the the the the TV evangelists around the world believe that brother Brown was a prophet and had an amazing Ministry which he did and they they they know that it was a move of God but they're not sitting in a message church amen and it comes down to this here one point right here you know if you were going to a wedding today it would sound something like this it would say do you and you can put your own name in there do you take Christ to be your lawful weeded husband do you choose to love and cherish do you choose For Better or For Worse whether he makes you rich or whether he makes you poor see a lot of us would love to serve God as long as we have a big bank account and get to drive a fancy car and we see healings all the time and we get a bigger house or what those things are 100% fine and and I have all of them amen but if God took them from me why would that change well we know in the natural and the prophet was a na a natural type the natural typees a spiritual you know the history of marriages in North America probably close to 90% as soon as sickness hits poorness hits you know wealth anything it changes everything but that's how we must serve our God but I believe when God gave me these thoughts and these uh this message I believe God's concerned that that some I don't mean even here but people around the world haven't went far enough they haven't done their wedding vows yet amen they haven't made the decision that you know we actually met with somebody coming back and he was talking about their young kids you know you know God don't have no grandkids my children have to receive their own experience for God themselves and your children do too and they were talking about children that were in University and they were sick and they had been praying and God hadn't healed them and she said she she actually told her parents she said I'm just burned out I'm tired of asking God for anything some of us are burned out we don't think we've seen what we thought we should have seen and so we're having second thoughts about our wedding vows I wonder you know my husband yed at me my husband my wife burned dinners see in our relationship in the message and serving God the honeymoon's over and so how do we but if we're hiss we're heads for the duration we're his till death do us part but death Won't Do Us Part cuz we're both Eternal amen and so you see see how this thought pattern's different we think that so many that would be listening even online they would think you know and and even in the ranks of the message you know we should never have respects the person as I was studying in this and I I didn't put them down but I took pictures of them you know brother Brown said that you are no better than the drunk that get saved one minute ago we we don't really the one that you can still smell it on but but he did his marriage vows you know what I mean and so we're still in flesh and so everybody kind of struggles with cuz you know if you know we rank people beings on their their wisdom and their knowledge and the Revelation that God's give them and and how long they've been in the message and how big their church is and you know or how many bodyguards they have when they leave the church but God don't our Prophet didn't he he said I'm no better than a drunk that was saved one minute ago that's how we're supposed to respect people cuz we're brothers and sisters but we're the the wife of Christ and I want to tell you something just like our adoption scripture in Galatians you you don't have the inheritance if you're not adopted period and when the Rapture comes your feet ain't leaving the ground that's thus saith the word of God because you're not air to nothing until you got the seal on your life which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's adoption but you can take that the exact same way in marriage is adoption you get your name change when you're married do you know a bride I know I know the prophet said this and but there you think of how many people the prophet said when you did your promise that in God's eyes you were the same as marriage but you didn't have a name change yet oh yeah you were Sanctified do you know until a bride goes to the wedding and has a name change and and the marriage is consumated that it's very easy for a bride to change your mind it's very easy for a groom to change his mind but when you've drove your Stak home and you got a new name see Dad men don't argue I promise that for richer or poorer makes no difference me you know Pastor barley when he was preaching sity convicted me he said Believers don't worry my goodness I have a whole new approach you know when when we're going to newand you know me and Lan were I even talked to some of you brothers and I oh man can you know we think about things cuz we're adults you know we think about okay you know are the dots all meeting you know what I mean and literally literally I mean it was it was Supernatural you want to see something Supernatural I literally felt to tell the when if the tickets were less or the same buy the tickets literally the very next day or two we got the bill for the back window and we got the bill from the town for putting in the street I'm like woo Glory if I would have knew two days ago and it was just like brother Bartley hit play so Christians don't worry I just I just went to bed at night and said God you got a couple bills to pay I'm going to Newland you take care of everything when I get back I mean what would have my worry changed amen but we we think sometimes we're going to help God in all these things amen God help us to understand we need to understand that unless we're married here we're not going on a honeymoon you get married before you go on honeymoon our Prophet said that amen let's read a quote and proven his word he said it's no more as a church see it's no more he said the bride is called he said in the day that the son of man is revealed he said what join a church to the Head United in the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom has come right into this and when the son of man comes down and the human flesh they're United together and the church is the word and the word the two are united together together to do that and it manifests a revealing of the son of man and see the son of man Jesus Christ will come down into human flesh among us because of marriage see you know when you're married and your wife goes to town she represents you when my wife goes to the bank she is me or she is a langstaff period my wife will tell you it was the weirdest thing for her when she came to brigon that no everybody looked at her like a weirdo because she wasn't from the area she was from Indiana who are you you're asking about Dale's business you're going in the co-op paying Dale's Bill who's this woman amen you know the time and this is a side note because you think of where the thoughts of the people are in the world you know my When We Were Young I was working in uh at work at the elevator and Lan went to the cattle sales with my my dad and the people that had knew my dad for 50 years were just losing their mind laughing uncontrollably because they thought my dad was in his midlife crisis and got a girlfriend that's that's a that's 100% the true story 100% but see Lan was me yeah and she was me at the cattle sale and it was her paying for the cattle but it was me but that how it is with Christ that's why in Galatians it said that when you're air you're air of everything it's you that's the inheritance that's you have the power of healing you have the power of Deliverance amen it's in you you know when when Christ prayed to the father and said father if it be your will take this cup from me but nevertheless not thy will but my will be done who was he talking to himself 100% himself that's why the prophet said that when you're in road rage and somebody cut you off and you say step out of the vehicle we'll s said that your attitude to a reaction can actually change that person's Eternal destination why because you're packing the Deliverance who are you praying to to yourself you're not going to pray to a far away God you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you oh Father up there somewhere oh my line got cut off because it was Christ in flesh tabernacled Among Us exactly the same Holy Spirit that's in you was Christ in a measure amen God help us to recognize this he said now when we come down to the human flesh Among Us it will make his word so real that the the church and him are one and the bride and she'll go home to the wedding supper and she's already United he says this multiple times she's already married and she'll go home to the wedding supper amen he's already United the wedding supper not to a marriage filled in the flesh and all the Flesh of man is gone you know when you seal you know brother Brown talked about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he talked about the train car and I have that quote in here but I'm just going to paraphrase it you know he said you can fire in all your dishes and all your furniture and all your clothes and just fire it in there and say okay I got it that's how some Believers say well I got it I went to church I got it you know I get saved I got it I got it all fired in there but no but this the the the inspector called Jehovah has to come by and he says did we do our wedding vows yet and he walks through and he goes oh that's poor we'll put it up there we'll put it on the top oh this is Rich and heavy I'll put it on the bottom and he packes the container but when that Holy Ghost Jehovah shuts the door amen it's it's it's not a amen when you say I do when the door is shut that's till the day of your redemption in God's mind you're already glorified if if you're you can't be glorified until you get a night name change it was him that CED you it was him that no man father except the father draws him who was according who it wasn't you that desired to serve God it was God that came and was looking for the part of him that he placed in there before the foundation of the world and it was him wooing you back to himself and he was just pulling you in like this Sending You Flowers and gifts and presents until the he came and expected he said you got everything you need here's my name Christ the anointed one and he closes the door and it's good for the whole journey but you ain't going in that Journey if you haven't been shot you know when you look at Ephesians 5:2 22-32 and we're not going to read that but that's the whole scripture about wives and husbands but if you go to the end scripture verse Ephesians 5:32 and you can pull that up it says for this is a great mystery concerning the Christ and the church so if if that was a great mystery and you leave that up the concerning great mystery it was wives who are we Christ's wife wives submit to Jehovah submit to the anointed one wives honor your husbands wives obey obedience is better than sacrifice this was it has very little I mean it's used for fleshly relationships but God had a way bigger plan for this it was talking about you the bride the wife of Christ and himself spiritually speaking because when they asked Moses he said it was not so from the beginning but for the hardness of their Leo to seeing Hearts well bless God that's not the way I see it divorce was never ever an option and it can't be an option if you actually pumping his blood and pack in his rib we have this warped opinion while I would just get together and we'll part aart that's impossible he would die I would die if you took a rib out my heart would collapse my lung would probably puncture huh I'm talk I'm think of that spiritually speaking we think we can survive without God the world thinks they can survive without their husband or wife but they can't if they were one in the beginning amen is that amen that's right oh Hallelujah a great mystery concerning Christ in the church here's some some quotes just short quotes chist Christ in his church as a bride Christ being one like a husband and wife are one church and the Christ are molded together as one person the same as the Holy Spirit and that's in the seven Church ages you know what you don't have to worry about your body going up it won't be your body it'll be Christ's body going up because you were Christ you were part of him you come from him it's his anointing on you it's it's his germ of life that was in you you don't think Christ can pull himself back to Christ oh my goodness we have lots of examples of that when Jesus went up it was Christ going back to Jehovah the anointed one remember that God is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth we we're putting God off in some big uh Coliseum somewhere in some big university or college or some big church that's got a gold steeple or something God's a spirit God ain't wood this ain't God God ain't flesh God ain't God ain't flesh God can use God can use this wood just as much as he can use his flesh if it's surrendered to him what do you think the church pews are you think they're God you think if you sit in the front Pew or the back pew you got more of God or less God it's no more God than it's it's maybe surrendered to God it's for the purpose of God but that's not God and so people have got God in their church and oh Wyoming church is God it's a beautiful place to meet God and keep the rain off our head today but that's not God that's right God's a spirit and that's how he can be in tabernacled in you and me and all these warped people if you ever go to a place and they're raided with bodyguards or that's completely the spirit of L is garbage it's how that's right if the preacher needs a bodyguard then all the brothers and church need bodyguards because I'm packing gold refined by the fire of the holy spirit that the the robbers can't come in and break away and steal and moth and rust don't corrupt lay up your treasures and so then we' have to get bodyguards for all the sisters because they're the only pure unadulterated beautiful virgin wives of the bride of Christ but oh no we just get that for the five-fold ministry because they're special that's not what God Said Amen World special God help us not to have this religious modern day Doctrine amen Revelations of the brid tree he said I'll go with you here's our Prophet talking he said I will be a he said you will be part of me how can you be a part of somebody that you're not married to or you weren't born from you weren't born from or you're not married to you will be a part of me and you will be in many places he calls Bri and I'm actually going to get to a quote where he actually said the bride is the wife is the same thing the bride because the bride would have already committed her vows and my life will be in your body that's a direct quote the prophet says and my life will be in your body how can your life be in my body that's Christ's life but you're way past salvation see you've had you've had Jehovah come and inspect the car and he said now everything you need for this journey all all the way to the Rapture you're already packing amen if we're not we're deceived we're the most deceived people there ever was we might as well join the the Catholic church and bow to the pope my life will be in your body and just like watch this this is in the restoration bride tree 620422 just like a husband and wife is one person you and I are going to be one and that day I will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me that it that sounds like marriage to me amen hallelujah God help us here in another example of this here it's the tongues of fires set upon each of them and God dividing himself among his church because that's what his wife was his wife and husband and wife is one together and God and the church is one together God in you that's in this world is falling part 63 11:15 if anybody would like to see those amen you see we got this idea that if it's convenient the world has this idea and it's crept in the message that I I you know when we were we were away and in the states there's churches are sometimes very close amen I mean there're sometimes close I mean here London's close Petro's close Windsor's I mean but I had people tell me said the people they just wrote rotate among the churches oh we go here and that sounds kind of boring we'll move on but you can't do that in a marriage amen not with Christ people people want to rotate around god well I think I'll I'll go sew my Wild Oats now and then I'll no you don't sew Wild Oats with God that's a warped opinion that's some new age idea from Hell amen God ain't marrying people that go s so Wild Oats amen e Eve fell and and when Adam came to Eve she was already impregnated and spiritually speaking God came to the denominations and when she was already pregnated by worldly Creeds and dogmas and man's ideas he divorced her there was no marriage he didn't have to divorce her he said get lost I'll find a pure unadulterated that's us sayth the prophet I might have paraphrase that in there but I have the quote in my iPad he ain't marrying somebody like that what are we thinking God divided himself among his people this another quote questions and answers because the church in Christ is one just as a husband and wife are one amen if we if we ain't done our our our vows here and he hasn't come and inspected our vows we ain't going in a Rapture because only Mrs Jesus Christ is going in Rapture it's it's going to be a family reunion a honeymoon in heaven what do you think the Millennium is that's a honeymoon now it's going to be plush I mean you talk about five star hotels a thousand years I mean that's going to be a huge Visa bill can you imagine on streets of gold amen John 5:24 if you want to pull that up John 5:24 verely verily I say unto you that he that heareth my word this is this is just ain't heing the whole world's here in the Bible but it's to keep and to do and obey my word and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life and shall not come to the condemnation but shall pass from Death onto life here is his word is say will you marry me will you be true will you be committed amen here in John 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto them if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and he will come onto him an abode sounds like a relationship to me amen husband and wife relationship what do husbands and wife Abode together amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus here's another one in questions and answers this is a bit longer just uh forgive me but I believe this is good word for us to to hear what our Prophet says amen and we realize it was anointed and and still anointed and when you used to express that if if I do believe the word we will be eternally separated if we do not sorry believe the word we'll be eternally separated from Christ and do you mean the foolish virgins will live eternally this was a question that was asked to uh brother brandham about the wise virgins and the foolish virgins you know they were they were both message Believers the wise and the foolish they were both virgins so they were both Sanctified they were both holy but one had taken their marage fows one had made a commitment one had actually taken his life into him called the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said absolutely he said I just explained that this morning the same on the same thing you've got to have all the stages he said you can't just be saved and go in a rapture he said you've got to the got you've forgotten you've begotten of the spirit and just as a baby is in a mother's womb he said you're not converted until you're married or until you're adopted and he said the reason for all these great Mysteries is given to Luther could not be given these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther they could not be given to Wesley they could not be given up in the age that is just passed us the Pentecostal age why it wasn't the time yet they were begotten but now the person of Christ himself the son of man do you understand he's revealing himself in the son of man in human flesh like a husband and a wife amen oh praise God thank you Lord Jesus amen is isn't it amazing you know what would be the reason there's only one reason in today's world that somebody don't want to go to a marriage now if you were looking at a child standpoint in Galatians and you were looking at adopted and and you didn't and you know the father and mother gets a tutor and they raise up the kid and he's a rotten spoiled rotten bride he's a silver spoon he's good for nothing needs a kick in the teeth if he refuses to change he's never adopted if he don't follow the tutor which is the word of God the instruction book that the mom and dad give to him which would be Jehovah he ain't never going to have signning authority on that bank account that's why that's why the prophet said things like this the that women that cut their hair can't even pray because they men that mistreat their wives like dogs can't even pray oh you can pray but God has zero obligation to answer your prayers that's right oh absolutely zero what about how we treat treat each other that's packing the Holy Ghost you treat them in some kind of a different level the Bible calls it sin and guilty of the whole law which would make God completely oh bless God I'm praying I pray for an hour a day but I never see it answered it's because God ain't required to answer it because you're not adopted yet you haven't bonded with him yet yet and marriage commitment Hallelujah God help us he says it'll change your nature when you're converted we we read that last night your old nature dies you know a a a a man a a dad man don't talk a dad man don't have an opinion you know you know we have a a a PEC every relationship's peculiar right we'll go out to a restaurant every one of yours is peculiar just it's all right me and my wife we go out to a restaurant and Lan always pays because I don't want to carry my wallet and I'm fat and so she has all the money she pays she gets in the car and says thanks for supper I say thanks for supper wasn't my money it was your money and normally we say well thank you Jesus for supper you see how it is but see if you're divided you keep score but see you can't keep score on God and you can't keep scoring your husband and wife if you're if you're not divided it's like well it's been a long time since she who's keeping score it's one person if that was me I would say it's been a long time since she lets me get in an airplane go for a trip she said but there no money honey said we got to pray harder amen you see how you you literally think differently so like Pastor barley was here and you you you you you believe you're in God's will and you're going to go to Newland and you're going to see Believers and you're going to go to a church camp in St John's and the next day you get a bill you just say well no problem cuz see I think differently see that's a mystery see it's really not my bill because I'm one with Christ CU it's in a marriage amen you don't think God has the ability that's how that's how a natural relationship would be you know when we were young and I was foolish and I would spend way more money than any human being could ever possibly pay my wife was very wise she had education and she would just lay out the tractor paint on the desk you just Farm credit payment and she'd do it maybe maybe even a few days or months before and wasn't her payments but that's how we're supposed to be with God Amen are we not if you have a need in your body you're supposed to worry about it or you just say hey God this is your body you have a need with your children you're supposed to worry about it lay awake at night or just say God they're your kids you gave them to me you couldn't had them without him giving them to you so you just go to sleep and you sleep like a baby cuz they're God's kids anyway cuz whatever he predestinated he won't lose any that's right but we think somehow because if God sees that we're laying awake and we're more sincere he'll answer it more it don't work that way don't work that way God help us so when we we have to go through a death that's why there's no marriage nowadays and that's why people just shack up because the day that they have a disagreement they're gone they don't have to change their name back they don't have to go see the lawyer they don't own no property together they have no assets together it's just I take my clothes and I walk and that's how most people are serving Christ in our age because it's the realm of the spirit around us that's how people hold their jobs Jared has guys that you know oh my goodness they'd give you a headache you know they uh they wake up and the truck don't start or they got you know whatever they got a problem they don't bother calling and that maybe two or three days later their wife will call what kind of a commitment is that it's cuz there is no commitment there's no commitment in the world it's just well like whatever amen but you know the Bible says that those that are going to go in a Rapture are watching for him and the Bible also says that those that are going in a Rapture are adopted Sons and Daughters they've had a name change they actually in the adoption of their kids they actually had a ceremony that sounds like a wedding to me you know they have a ceremony and they say is there anybody here that disagrees that these two shall be tained amen God help us Amen in Matthew let's pull that up uh Vicky please Matthew 12 43:45 and I'll just read this this is what happens so many and this is a very very sad story in for uh people that are hanging around the truth amen here's here's people that decide to serve God they they they you know this what the prophet said he said they're around the true anointing they're around the True Believer and they feel something it's different you you've had that happen in the grocery store every one of you it's it's not zoned to just or different sort and they feel something there's just something and they they're like you know you had somebody that going to miss talk or or say something oh and so they feel it and they want to be like you and this is what happens and when the unclean spirit said when out from the man he cleans himself up and he walks through Dry places seeking rest and finds none he he's got rid he said now I want to quit stealing quit smoking and quit flirting you know doing whatever quit looking at you know doing things that Christians do but he ain't got sealed by Jehovah and he's walking around this dry space and he says well I'll return into my house this is the evil spirit from whence I came and when he came back he finds a house beautifully cleaned and empty now you know why it was empty because God hadn't adopted that person God had never said I will that's why it was empty and that evil spirit goes and says praise the lord we got a clean house let's bring four more demons F seven more demons with us seven more other spirits that are more wicked than himself and enter in and dwell therein and the last state of the man which was worse than the first why because he never got married he never got filled he never got adopted he never got a name Chang change was worse than and even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation look at that last sentence that's what's happening in church there's people that's sitting around people that hang around you know that's what I said when when we preached on not not converted you know that's how people could come and Minister the the the the the Bible and the message for 30 years and just just walk right away from it cuz they never ever were filled you can't you know you know like we said with the the the train car and the inspector comes and he seals it hello it's sealed when you're impregnated with Christ you can't take Satan's seed your worm's already full amen even so shall it be in this wicked generation and here I already mentioned this at my next quote was you know and I'd read this in the converted where people 20,000 would get saved and they'd come back two weeks later the prophet says they weren't ex converted he said he said they accepted Christ as their personal savior but they're still not converted converted means that you're changed converted don't just mean that I'm going to church converted don't mean that you're wearing a tie and packing a suit or a beautiful dress or something no your whole life changes amen you know when Jacob wrestled with the angel his walk changed because the angel grabbed his thigh you can Google that the Bible talks about it we might come to that scripture yet now this ain't to be funny but I want you to get the point Christ wants did you ever see a sister that's very far along in pregnancy thank you sister Joanie she walks differently do you ever see somebody that's so full of Christ you can't even they're just come completely their presence is like magnetic and they're sweet and they're humble and they don't want to be seen by anybody and they're trying to hide and they give you the front seat and they take the back seat and they they walk differently you know like a pregnant on I can't do it cuz I've never been pregnant but they they waddle do you ever see a duck they walk different amen but when you got Christ you walk differently that's why when you go up town everybody my wife was in the mall I think I told Brother laurren s brother Bartley this or so I told somebody this don't and she she's seen some old people old so this wasn't funny or nothing they were older than us by long shot and the guy's looking at Len like she comes up to Leen and I think he was just a little squirt of an 80-year-old man you know and he goes like he probably can hardly why and he said am I lying honey am I lying no thank you and he said can I touch your hair and he rubs his hand down her hair back and he looks over at his wife and he says why can't you have that no my wife never witnessed to him she never preached to him she didn't pass out a message book of The Seven Church ages or the mystery of what those are all true but she had a different walk she looked so peculiar that his wife was in his husband was insulting his wife in my wife's pres I hope this don't come to Arms amen because you can't be married you can't be adopted you know I I I I don't know if you're getting this you know my neighbor uh Garnet McCormack he he had a big plant job and when I was younger and skinnier I had more cows than I have now a lot more at one point I had up to about 160 during BSE and he sent his kids to the sale and I didn't know this doctor he told me directly to himself this is an adopted son and he told his kids he said listen when you go to the sale for no reason do not come home with d c do not not come home with deal SKS said don't tell me that they missed your bid don't tell me they didn't see you don't tell me you got there late don't tell me that they sold too dear if you're breathing don't you come back unless you bring his CS you know those kids could walk in the sail bar like this cuz they weren't spending their money they were spending Papa's money and papa had give them strict orders D's cows come in just put your hand up goo boooop if I would have knew that I would have sat beside him and put my hand up one just to kind of help things along he didn't tell me that till after I got way less cattle but see that man wed my calves and he lived two miles from me and he watched them all summer like Jehovah's watching you all summer and he's saying now listen you're not coming coming home without them in your hand there's it's not a possibility they're going to be every one of my sheep are going to be there you know and each when when Israel left Egypt they they took they took everything they even took their back wages for slavery because it says they took the wealth of Egypt they took all the cows they didn't leave the m and goats behind they didn't leave the Lambs behind which are disgusting to eat mutton but you see what I mean they took everything they took the young man and they took the old man because it was Jehovah's it was his promise family it was chosen you see but that can only happen if you're his amen that can only happen if you're his if you got his name he ain't leaving you behind it's not like the parents that got a whole bunch of kids and when they get in the van they start the van and if the van sounds noisy and it looks kind of full they just drive away they don't matter who's kids are in there cuz I heard parents say you know when they during the Depression they would ring the bell and pray that they didn't all hear it or come they W they weren't worried about cooking three different meals or you see but Christ spiritually speaking he ain't leaving you hungry you're I mean the Bible says if he you being evil and how to give good gifts to your children and him being Jehovah God hello amen God help us God help us but in this generation we're self I don't mean you guys I'm just saying the spirit on Lea is people's rights my rights and it's me first me I me myself and I what's good for me what can I get out of this opportunity what can I get out of this relationship I'm going to you know they having different countries not so much here but and and and sadly very sadly to say even in the churches brother Bernard I'm sorry and not just you and the philippin they talk about marrying up yeah well their family was rich and connected in the government and we were just peasants and they married way up way and you know what lots of countries that's completely forbidden because the bride ain't going to come and pack an inheritance to the groom site and they want they want to bring the richest and the richest and bring them together but Christ's family is completely different than that Christ had everything and you were born and sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and he said that's my little child right there amen oh praise God that's beautiful amen so we see that people sadly are self-willed self-governed and self Direction and they will only marry or stay married autonomy in one of these Scriptures it mentioned autonomy and it was Independence freedom and self-direction was the meaning of autonomy that oh maybe our Prophet said that it was personal value and freedom of your own will amen that won't work in God's family if you've reached adopt option and that's why most people haven't went far enough is because they're not willing to make the commitment amen God help us I want to read a quote and and this quote is not based on our natural life and this this is going to but I just it's based on it's it's something the prophet said but I want to use it as a spiritual connection brother Bram said he said I remember one day when we when his family were getting married he said when they were young he's talking about his parents he said I was just a little bitty fellow I'm sure many of you have heard the story this is in his life story in 51 he said but I want you to catch what he means spiritually and see because we've the our society has changed you're going to disagree with the prophet right here okay I'll guarantee you you will so you can just be prepared to he said when I was born my daddy was 18 and my mama was 15 you still agreeing with the prophet anybody got daughters that's when she was born born you don't like that quote do you but it's still a quote and he said I was born and we were just children and we all grew up together now that's ends with a period I'm going to quote it directly it's paragraph 22 in my life story he said I think that was a good thing you still think he's your prophet he ends out with the period and then he carries on and he says and I do actually I'm sorry he he he takes the end out he says I do so he repeats it twice that it was a good thing that his mama was 15 when he was born and now he explains why because like the first Eve she got impregnated before Adam got to her and he said my little girl when they get to the age and finds a good Christian boy he said I want her to marry and he said I'd rather him marry him and settle down and be a lady than be out in some of these roadhouses running around and what they call having a good time that's right the Bible says now this is in preferences in the message I have never I've actually maybe heard one two at the max but in 40 years I've never really I've never heard a preacher in North America mention this oh maybe one this what this what our Prophet says he says that's right the Bible says let your daughters marry young when's the last time anybody heard that preached wait a minute that's the message and the prophet said that was in the Bible see we're religious too we don't like that quote so we don't go there I'll say it for you ouch let's shake that one off he said ' that's right the Bible says and it's in parenthesis to catch your attention let your daughters marry young someone already turned aside after Satan see when we see new Believers come in the best thing they can get is the baptism of the Holy Ghost get them baptize and get them with the Holy Ghost the bible promises that those that make a commitment and they're baptized shall not maybe shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost shall that's guaranteed that's money in the bank I shall combine beans this fall that's better than that CU it's raining a lot that's why the prophet never ever ever ever listen to me children that's why the prophet never ever denied water for baptism I don't care if they're two they want to be baptized if they get re-baptized at 15 or 20 or a 100 but it's a promise never ever turn down water ever never say they I boom do it CU it's a god-given promise that it's a type that you're bearing your you're telling publicly I'm married or I'm dead and you buried the old man in water and now Christ can say okay I'll take you amen God help us natural types of spiritual marrying Christ you got to die out to yourself and really have a conversion and a conversion is not your testimony God could care less very little about your testimony he wants to watch your life Hallelujah not just saved not just Sanctified you know there's thousands of people like that I was raised Westland they're good people Dom menites good people clean people but is their house just swep and empty is it if they haven't received Jehovah if they haven't received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it won't matter if their host is clean whether they got one Spirit or seven spirits they're lost they're not converted amen Luke 1 30 and 31 it was hurry here sorry Luke 1 I want to show you something here and I want to read read some of these scriptures now I'm going to tell you what I'm going to add some emphasis to make it up to date and the angel came unto Mary and said fear not Mary now think spiritual think spiritual for thou art highly favored predestinated elected of God and behold Thou shalt conceive the word of God in thy womb the Holy Ghost and bring forth Jehovah a son and shall call his name Jesus and then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing that I am not known I've never joined the church I'm not known in Creeds and dogmas and doctrines of men and the angel answered unto her and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon you and you'll have a new birth and the power of the high highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also the holy thing which shall be in Born of thee Shall be Called Jehovah and Mary said unto her him that angel those amazing words Behold The handmade of God you could say Behold The Bride of the Lord be it onto me in marriage according to Thy word Mary's death to God's will did she understand it she didn't have a clue what that guy was talking about and the angel departed from her now if we look back at that if we jump to Matthew 18-22 I want to show you something here Joseph heard this testimony and he was some bewildered Matthew 1 18 and 22 let's go to 18 uh start at 18 sorry Matthew 18:18 and now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise that when Mo his mother Mary was exposed saved and Sanctified see they were engaged she was living a good Godly life you know the prophet said there was lots of virgin girls that could have been picked then but she wasn't converted yet she was esposed to Joseph but behold they came together behold before they came together she was Matthew 1 I'm sorry Matthew 1:1 18-22 sorry sorry I told you wrong sorry I'm bad and before they came together Mary was found already expecting and Joseph being just a human being said uhoh that was Supernatural that she'd received the baptism of the holy ghost in her womb that's what Christ was and Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public Exempted was mindful to put her away privately verse 20 and while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared onto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David what did he say to Mary what did what did the angel say to Mary when he came to Mary he said fear not what did he say to Joseph when he came to Joseph to say Mary's okay he said fear not to take thee Mary thy wife I want to show you how the scripture changed in the last scripture we read he said they were a spoused now God's saying you're going to be wife there's a difference so fear not to take thee Mary thy wife into marriage here for which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth the Son of God the seed and thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall save the people from their sin and now all this was done that it might be fulfilled what was spoken of the Lord by the prophets in this last day there will be another wife and it'll be the second Eve and God's Not Afraid because of the promise of her Fallen amen this second Eve will never be impregnated with denominational Creeds and man's ideas because she will already be married she will already be in a relationship amen hallelujah Revelations 19 I'm I'm winding down here just finishing some scripture Revelations 19:6 and8 and behold I Heard a Voice of great multitude which was people and the voice of many Waters and the voice of many thundering saying hallelu hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth and let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and she was granted that she shall be raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is a righteousness of the Saints amen Revelations 21 and9 and there came unto me the seventh angels and the Seven vows that were full in the last plagues and talked with me saying come up hither and I will show you the bride that has changed to be wife the bride that's the Lamb's wife the wife of God oh amen hallelujah and that that let's just a I'm just wrapping it up here and he said that's the way Christians is so he said we're planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and when you're planted in Christ brother Bartley read this one sorry and we we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything you have need of on this Earthly Journey Divine Healing is completely in you the power of God it's in you and all these other things very individual in here that's receiv received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and adoption marriage however you want to say it and amen that's in a relationship with Christ that's packing their womb has already been sealed like the box car he said you're planted in Christ think of that amen you're already in rated Hallelujah he says the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of in this life Journey even the Rapture is right now in you amen and he watch this in paragraph 86 he said now don't resist that that's the truth the Rapture is in us now and he said I can prove that by the gospel he said those that he called he justified and those that he justified he is glorified Hallelujah and they're in heaven and then in Heavenly today they're they're glorified in the presence of God right now just pushing out that's all you have to do God's in his word do you believe it amen to get to that point in Revelations 2213 and 14 for I am Alpha and Omega that's just the beginning and the end that's everything is in Christ the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are he that do his Commandments that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates unto the city that's Revelations 14 22 and 14 Luke 6 and 45 and a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the treasures of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil and for the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks and says I will I do man brother brandham he said now that and there there's three and now the next thing to do is you're born again and when you receive the baptism Holy Ghost and that's when you're converted when you're married that's when you're converted and you might be in the process of conversion you might be in a courtship but until you get a name name change you are you ain't going nowhere he said and you're not converted until it's completely and you're sealed into the kingdom of God and sealed down just like that starting the box car out there and I already mentioned that and the inspector says nope not yet but as soon as it gets the whole thing loaded up and it's sealed in and it's piked right the do slam shut and the inspector puts a seal on it and there you are she's ready and [Applause] filled and ready to be gone Hallelujah born again isn't just because you believe born they say you're born again when you believe and the Bible says this another quote why it had to be Shepherd the Bible says that the Devils believe also now notice it's not that it's the experience it's a marriage experience amen well you say well I've lived a good life so did the apostles and they wasn't born again until they received the Holy Spirit and that wasn't there wasn't even converted until they had received the Holy Spirit remember the night of betrayal and I read that in the conversion a month ago sorry when thou art converted Peter strengthen the Brethren and Peter had preached the gospel cast out Devils healed the sick you know that's an amazing that's a that's the end of 64 that was his wedding message 641 12:21 W had to be Shepherds you know what that exact same scenario you know if you were in a convention this if you were in a it wasn't even a it make me but most people when we go to camp meeting in St John's and whoever's preaching I whoever it is and they have people come out and they're miraculously Miracles right in their presence there will be very few to zero people that will say they might not be converted yet the people that's praying for them and that would be exactly the same as Peter and your Prophet said he wasn't converted amen amen Matthew 25 talks about the virgins and we know I I want to just read Matthew I just want to read the end of that Matthew 25 and it starts at 1 to 12 but I just want to read verse 12 and and you think you know the whole story by memory I know but think them them were all believers but some were impregnated and some were not some had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and some did not cuz you say how can you say that because of the Bible you say how can how can you compare impregnated with the baptism of the Holy Ghost verse 12 he's answered and said unto them verily verily I say unto you I know you not amen and if you're not sure about that that's in marriage then go to Matthew 7 21-23 and not everyone that says L unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but them that doeth the will of the Father which is in heaven and Mary saith unto and many shall say unto me in that day Lord Lord haven't I prophesied and preached in thy name and cast out devils in my name and done many wondrous works in the message church I added that and and I will profess unto them marriage again I never knew you only in a marriage would Christ know you in that way now be and you say how can you say that because he's omnipotent he's all knowing so for God to say I don't know you it's to make him a liar but it's a different no he didn't know them as wife now there's two scriptures where he says and the foolish versions he said I never knew you you don't think God knew the 10 foolish versions well let me let me just rephrase it like this if God didn't know the 10 frish versions he ain't worth worshiping cuz he's not omnipotent of course he didn't he knew them but he didn't know them as wife and then he says the same thing in Matthew 7:23 he said depart from me I don't even know you he knew them but he didn't know them as wife oh God that's amazing amen John 17 I'm just I'm sorry this is this so good amen I just want to finish this and we'll go to something different when I come back John 17 21-23 that they may all be one as as thou thy father art in me and I in thee and they also may be one in us and the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them and they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me and they may be made perfect and one that this only happens in marriage not you you can't even comply this to a son in an adoption and the and that the world may know that thou has sent me that thou thou has loved them as thou H has loved me in marriage husband and wife amen Matthew 19 we're just honestly we're wrapping this up Matthew 194 and 6 and he answered and said unto them have you not read that it was made them in the beginning made them male and female and he said unto them for this cause a man shall leave his mother and father and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh and therefore it shall be no more Twain but one flesh and therefore what God has put together let no man put a center now that's normally used in a marriage ceremony physically but if you're just in a courtship you're still to so if you're in a courtship with God you're not converted yet and you're definitely not going in Rapture because you're still Twain amen hallelujah amen just a couple more and we're going to close here here the prophet's talking about his love to Christ and he said if he sends me to hell and in Hell there is such a thing as love then I'll still love Christ because it's my part of my life and and it's become me and I can't help it cuz there's something in there that makes me love him that's in a commitment a marriage even it goes bad goes really bad for richer or poor sickness and in health no matter how bad it gets he said here and this will be my last quote and we'll stand on this one maybe you can come honey and Satan came to the Prophet this is when he lost all his family members and now he said will you serve Christ and he said now what would you think about him he said your daddy died about two weeks ago in your arms a doctor killed him with an overdose of medication said your brother less than a month ago was killed up there on the road and you picked him up with blood all over his body running down and a drunk had run all over him and said now there lays your wife down there in the Mard and now you're taking your baby out of your arms and he said Satan said to brother Brown he said now you still love this God and brother Brown said though he slay me yet I love him and if he sends me to hell at the Judgment Day he still just and I love him anyhow let's stand amen you know those quotes at the end are a lot more than just a courtship if he sends me to how no matter how bad it gets I'm still his if he takes everything you got financially and physically will you still serve him how long will we be here amen we don't know for sure we know God will protect his bride and we know that we're not here for the tribulation but what will go on before that I want to give you a news briefing you can Google this brother Lauren has sent it to me the bank Act is already set in Canada that June 25 next year the banks will stop operating that's in your country in Canada how will that affect your Christian walk amen we know that when they take paper off the market that they're going to be coming to tattoo you that'll be the chip how will that affect your walk with Christ see if it things get tough will that cons will that change your relationship if it changes your relationship you're not married yet if it changes you once back in your love for Christ then you're not adopted yet cuz you got something else ahead of your husband Jehovah wow God help us man those are solemn things to think about this world is falling apart completely it's already fall apart I was watching a a thing and they said uh investors I'm just telling you I'm I'm not trying to scare you I'm just showing you we're at the end we're at the end now we could be here for 20 years but we're still at the end could be here for 50 years but we're still at the end we know he'll come back he says to watch Israel can there get any more Wars around

army of Putin told him to use nuclear weapons on Ukraine because they had invaded Russia this week this week brother Bown said you wouldn't be here for that never since the history of Hitler has any country ever went into Russia's territory I know you don't think it's going to happen because you just always oh well bless God well like it'll happen tomorrow it will never happen in my lifetime it'll happen in my kids's lifetime really maybe Biden the Reagan air carrier over with I don't hold me but a lot of air Jets to protect Israel because Ukraine was going to send missiles into Israel and when Ukraine said that they went to Russia to back them up now that that sound Russia to pull Russia into Israel Ukraine wanted or I'm saying that not Ukraine sorry Iran sorry forgive me Iran had went to Russia that if the states retaliated that Russia would back them up bring them right down to this area that we don't even believe we're going to be here to see happen there's not a lot more can happen without it actually happening amen are we adopted are we married that's up to you to decide it's an individual walk but we're at the door amen we're for sure at the door God help us God help me God help me if you would change one thing then you're not adopted cuz our Prophet said if you know he's coming tomorrow which I would have a hard time doing this matter of fact I'm probably not there yet I'd still plant my potatoes knowing I'm not going to harvest them but that's how prepared you know you're just living life you're just married and whenever God decides to take us home we're completely his cuz we already got his name it's not about if you're going you know if you're married you you you guaranteed know if you're married you don't have to tell me if you're married you know in yourself if you're married you know in yourself how great your commitment is with Jehovah no matter what I'm going amen that's how it's got to be amen God help us amen be it onto me be it on [Music] h [Music] might [Music] next Sunday be an I've asked for the come back onay wednes [Music] no name like Jesus is sweet Jesus is the sweetest name I Jesus Jesus is the sweetest name I know sorry and also I want to I just just uh this is information maybe you can just take this for what it's worth if it's not worth nothing to you it's not we had a contact that sent us an email that said that the government in Canada was warning businesses to prepare for another lockdown pendemic and that there would be actually food shortages and fuel shortages now God knows my heart I am not trying to scare [Music] you but that is 100% man-made intentional by the government it's a power setup for a one world government and if you're still believing your government you're deceived any government you're deceived I don't care what they are because this kingdom is Satan's and in one of those things they said there's a food shortage and I want to just tell you so you understand perfectly the prices on my crop has depleted over 30% because there is such an abundance of corn wheat and soybeans now you can decide if you want to believe brother Dale or you want to believe trud that's entirely up to you it's no sweat off my breath but there ain't no food chage and there's more oil in Canada and the states than we could burn in your grandkids generation so if you believe that lie I feel really sorry for you and monkey pox is a gay and lesbian disease Almost 100% or an incest disease and that's why they didn't bring it out sooner because they realize that everybody that got were about 95% gay lesbians but in countries where prostitution is off the charts that's how it spreads because people don't have one spouse amen but the anointing of Lucifer is on the world for a savior and it ain't Christ Jesus it's called the pope and ran that's why if we go into something like this it's as fake as the East is from the west and I'll tell you ahead of time brother Dale ain't getting the jack I am not afraid of monkey pox I don't visit those places amen now it's an individual thing but I'm just showing you now that notice came to us from an exp potition that had sat in our Parliament for 15 years and it's preparing businesses they're trying to bankrupt the wealthy it's the only way they can take over and there's no food CHS you want to come to brother Dale you can get a whole wagon load of corn that you could live for probably 10 years on making corn mesh and biscuits what Russia lives on or China lives on Africa men of the world their common base is maze it's a lie it's a deceptive lie amen God help us not to be we we need you know the world how's that scripture go the world fainteth or or is destroyed because of of lack of knowledge lack of knowledge you need to
