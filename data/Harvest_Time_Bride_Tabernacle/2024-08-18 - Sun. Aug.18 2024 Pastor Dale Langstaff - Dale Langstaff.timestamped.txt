[20:37] today amen and me and Lan we uh canceled
[20:41] Wednesday service we went to
[20:44] uh a family friends funeral of Lan and
[20:48] just pray that you remember the family
[20:52] and Lan that's just
[20:55] a uh
[20:59] just I mean uh so you
[21:03] understand Lan's family Lan
[21:06] was born about 10 years after her
[21:10] siblings so all her brothers and sisters
[21:13] left
[21:14] home and when Lan was
[21:18] nine her mom got very
[21:21] sick and her dad
[21:23] left and this was the family that Lan
[21:27] lived with
[21:29] traveled
[21:30] with they were
[21:33] evangelists and
[21:36] singers and
[21:39] uh so they were very special to
[21:44] Lan amazing people they were part of our
[21:47] wedding and all those things
[21:50] so it
[21:52] wasn't it wasn't family per se and it
[21:56] wasn't just a casual acquaintance but it
[21:58] was somebody that was very dear to Lan
[22:01] for many many years in her life and amen
[22:06] so you know chapters of our life
[22:09] close because most of their family don't
[22:12] even recognize me and
[22:14] Len they they they wouldn't know who Lan
[22:17] was if she was a
[22:19] stranger but her oldest daughter told
[22:22] Lan for weeks before she died she was
[22:26] asking is Lan coming today
[22:29] L coming today amen it's just it's funny
[22:33] how chapters of our life the young ones
[22:35] come up and the and they don't know they
[22:38] don't know the old people or the old
[22:40] phones or old things amen life moves on
[22:44] and amen but we just praise God for the
[22:48] opportunity to serve him amen and be a
[22:51] part of his kingdom we also are very
[22:53] grateful for all the wonderful
[22:56] experiences we had with brother Bartley
[22:59] here and camp meeting and the two weeks
[23:02] was amazing you all were amazing the the
[23:06] the presence of God was amazing and it
[23:09] was a a good good
[23:12] uh uh I believe I I've turned it on if
[23:16] it's a amen am I on yeah amen we just
[23:22] thank God
[23:23] remember Pastor barley he went home to a
[23:26] house with no running water no
[23:29] electricity and no internet I've not
[23:32] received one message from them since I
[23:33] left them at the
[23:35] airport amen just remember them I do
[23:39] know he arrived safely I found that out
[23:40] through junior's wife
[23:43] but sometimes things that we take for
[23:45] granted here are not for granted there
[23:47] you know you know you know when you see
[23:49] a a minister come and travel you know
[23:52] it's like we had much Great Fellowship
[23:55] in our house with them and and for him
[23:58] it's the same in his church as it is
[24:01] every church around the world you know
[24:04] he he in their place he stopped having
[24:07] Wednesday night services because many of
[24:10] the people come to the church are single
[24:12] sisters and they would get robbed on the
[24:14] way home from church and then their
[24:17] unbelieving husbands would blame
[24:20] him so he has a Bible study
[24:22] online amen it's just you know you
[24:25] sometimes we get an opinion that you
[24:26] know it's just uh something but it's
[24:30] it's maybe different than what you think
[24:32] you amen it's just a different but amen
[24:35] but it's a great great uh great
[24:37] opportunity so just pray for me and Lan
[24:39] we're actually going today to
[24:42] Newland and uh we kind of held that
[24:44] before the Lord and so uh you know we
[24:47] had prayed and thought about it we're
[24:48] going to see brother Carson and sister
[24:51] Sharon and sister Donna and and uh you
[24:54] know we we tossed it around toss it
[24:56] around toss it around and and and
[24:59] uh uh we finally made a day where I told
[25:03] Lan I said if you go back to the
[25:05] airplane tickets and they're the same
[25:07] price or less we'll go but if they're a
[25:10] penny more we won't go and they were
[25:13] actually much less or some less and so
[25:15] we she uh purchased them and we're
[25:18] looking forward to that so maybe we'll
[25:20] stand
[25:21] and just uh looking forward to what God
[25:25] has for us let's turn to Galatians 4
[25:31] Galatians 41-7 and and
[25:36] uh just looking forward I want to preach
[25:39] on
[25:41] adoption through
[25:44] marriage and if I had a second title it'
[25:47] be a name
[25:51] change and a name
[25:54] change and now I say that the heir as
[25:57] long as is a child differeth nothing
[26:00] from the servant though he is Lord of
[26:02] all but under tutors and governs until
[26:05] the time appointed of the father and
[26:07] even so we we were children in bondage
[26:10] under the elements of the world but when
[26:13] the fullness of time come God sent his
[26:15] son and made of a
[26:16] woman made under the law to redeem them
[26:20] that were under the law that they might
[26:22] receive the receive the adoption of sons
[26:26] and because ye are Sons
[26:28] God has set forth his Spirit of his son
[26:32] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[26:36] wherefor Thou Art no more servants but
[26:39] Sons for if a son than an heir of God
[26:44] through Christ let's just read another
[26:47] scripture
[26:49] here as I scroll back and find GL uh
[26:52] Genesis
[26:54] 2 Genesis 2:21 and 24
[26:58] just and the Lord
[27:01] caused and the Lord God caused a deep
[27:03] sleep to fall on Adam and he slept and
[27:06] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[27:08] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[27:13] which the Lord God took from the man he
[27:15] made he a woman and brought her onto the
[27:18] man and Adam said now this is bone of my
[27:21] bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she
[27:24] shall be called woman because she was
[27:26] taken out of a man there therefore shall
[27:28] a man leave his mother and father and
[27:32] shall cleave to his wife and they shall
[27:36] be one flesh Lord Jesus we pray that
[27:39] you'll add the blessing on the word Lord
[27:41] God and Lord as you Minister this
[27:43] morning I pray that the people will
[27:45] receive it as you showed it and brought
[27:48] it to me Lord Jesus we pray and bless
[27:51] your bride around the world and the
[27:53] servants and as the word Goes Forth this
[27:55] weekend and your beautiful name we pray
[27:58] amen amen you may have your seats this
[28:01] morning you know as our scripture there
[28:03] in Galatians talks about the adoption of
[28:06] sons and we you know you've heard that
[28:08] preach multiple times and and there's so
[28:11] many different ways that you could go
[28:13] with that but I want to uh you know in
[28:16] the adoption of sons you you deal with
[28:18] immaturity and you deal with lots of
[28:20] different things uh that would consider
[28:23] a young a young person a young man a
[28:25] young child that would be born into a
[28:27] family family but we know and so I want
[28:31] to look at the adoption in a different
[28:33] way than than as a young
[28:37] person but we know that we came from God
[28:42] that we're going to go back to God but
[28:44] we but but through the fall of sin he
[28:48] came to redeem us back and you know
[28:50] we're living in a world in a realm of
[28:53] spirits around us that we rub shoulders
[28:56] with and so times have changed and our
[28:58] day and we have a day with no
[29:02] commitment we have a day that people
[29:04] don't commit to their work people don't
[29:06] commit to each other people just shack
[29:09] up the reason people shack up is not
[29:11] because they don't love each other
[29:13] because they're not attracted but
[29:15] because they have zero
[29:16] commitment it's just what's good for me
[29:19] for today and if it's bad for me
[29:21] tomorrow I'm out of this
[29:24] opportunity amen but we cannot serve God
[29:27] like that and you know the last time I
[29:28] ministered I preached on being converted
[29:31] and here here the prophet showed how how
[29:33] he said to Peter he said when you're
[29:35] converted stengthen the Brethren now
[29:37] this was somebody that had walked with
[29:39] Jesus the prophet said he was saved and
[29:43] Sanctified he had been given the power
[29:45] to cast out demons and evil spirits and
[29:48] heal the sick and you know the disciples
[29:50] come back to Jesus and they were
[29:52] rejoicing because even the Devils were
[29:54] were uh you know receptive to them and
[29:57] and they bow and Jesus said those
[29:59] powerful words he said Rejoice not that
[30:01] the Devils respond to you but Rejoice
[30:05] that their name is in the Lamb's Book of
[30:07] Life and our Prophet talked about you
[30:09] know the the popular evangelist when we
[30:11] were when we were in Indiana I bought a
[30:14] book and I'm going to put it at the
[30:15] church after I read it myself and that
[30:18] but it was in the the era of like the 42
[30:21] to 60 there 45 to 65 and it and it's
[30:25] just unbelievable the move of God that
[30:28] was in the country in Revival and it it
[30:30] took literally thousands probably tens
[30:34] of thousands the books a big book tens
[30:37] of thousands of newspaper clips of
[30:40] Revival services that were all week
[30:42] Revival Services 10 Revival services and
[30:44] this is how this was a standard
[30:47] equipment in the newspaper it was said
[30:49] the church couldn't hold them there was
[30:52] an an ected amount of crowds
[30:58] huge that was a that was a move of God
[31:00] and the Revival of that day was
[31:02] unexpected but in our day it's not like
[31:06] that because there's no
[31:09] commitment it's not that people don't
[31:11] love God it's not that people didn't
[31:13] come from God but our Prophet said when
[31:16] those evangelists they would come and
[31:18] they would have 20,000 or 30,000 and
[31:20] they come back a year later there'd be
[31:22] five people in the church he said they
[31:24] didn't go far enough said you didn't
[31:27] take take them on to Christ you got them
[31:30] saved they love God they love the word
[31:32] they obey the word that they believe the
[31:35] word I mean sorry Satan believes the
[31:37] word
[31:37] too but he's not going to be in heaven
[31:40] and you know when Pastor Bley was here
[31:42] he talked he read scriptures and I'm
[31:43] going to read one of them and and
[31:45] there's a scripture in John where it
[31:46] talks about those that keep the word and
[31:49] there's another one in John that says
[31:50] those that hear the word and the hear
[31:52] the word it's not just the definition of
[31:54] hear but hear is to understand and to
[31:56] do amen it's not just about believing
[31:59] that there's a God and you know we
[32:01] believe this message the devil believes
[32:03] this
[32:04] message amen lot lots of the the the the
[32:06] TV evangelists around the world believe
[32:08] that brother Brown was a prophet and had
[32:10] an amazing Ministry which he did and
[32:12] they they they know that it was a move
[32:13] of
[32:14] God but they're not sitting in a message
[32:18] church amen and it comes down to this
[32:21] here one point right
[32:23] here you know if you were going to a
[32:26] wedding today
[32:28] it would sound something like
[32:30] this it would say do
[32:33] you and you can put your own name in
[32:36] there do
[32:38] you take
[32:41] Christ to be your lawful weeded
[32:47] husband do
[32:49] you choose to love and
[32:55] cherish do you
[32:58] choose For
[33:00] Better or For
[33:03] Worse whether he makes you
[33:06] rich or whether he makes you
[33:09] poor see a lot of us would love to serve
[33:12] God as long as we have a big bank
[33:14] account and get to drive a fancy car and
[33:17] we see healings all the time and we get
[33:19] a bigger house or what those things are
[33:22] 100% fine and and I have all of them
[33:26] amen but if God took them from
[33:31] me why would that
[33:34] change well we know in the natural and
[33:36] the prophet was a na a natural type the
[33:39] natural typees a spiritual you know the
[33:41] history of marriages in North
[33:44] America probably close to
[33:47] 90% as soon as sickness
[33:50] hits poorness
[33:52] hits you know wealth anything it changes
[33:57] everything
[33:58] but that's how we must serve our
[34:01] God but I
[34:03] believe when God gave me these thoughts
[34:06] and these uh this message I believe
[34:10] God's
[34:11] concerned that that some I don't mean
[34:13] even here but people around the world
[34:15] haven't
[34:16] went far enough they haven't done their
[34:20] wedding vows
[34:22] yet amen they haven't made the decision
[34:24] that you know we actually met with
[34:26] somebody coming back and he was talking
[34:28] about their young kids you know you know
[34:30] God don't have no
[34:32] grandkids my children have to receive
[34:35] their own experience for God themselves
[34:37] and your children do too and they were
[34:40] talking about children that were in
[34:42] University and they were sick and they
[34:44] had been praying and God hadn't healed
[34:46] them and she said she she actually told
[34:48] her parents she said I'm just burned out
[34:50] I'm tired of asking God for
[34:54] anything some of us are burned out
[34:58] we don't think we've seen what we
[35:00] thought we should have seen and so we're
[35:02] having second thoughts about our wedding
[35:05] vows I
[35:07] wonder you know my husband yed at me my
[35:11] husband my wife burned
[35:14] dinners see in our relationship in the
[35:17] message and serving God the honeymoon's
[35:19] over and so how do
[35:24] we but if we're hiss we're heads for the
[35:28] duration we're his till death do us part
[35:32] but death Won't Do Us Part cuz we're
[35:33] both Eternal amen and so you see see how
[35:37] this thought pattern's different we
[35:39] think that so many that would be
[35:42] listening even online they would think
[35:43] you know and and even in the ranks of
[35:45] the message you know we should never
[35:47] have respects the person as I was
[35:49] studying in this and I I didn't put them
[35:51] down but I took pictures of them you
[35:52] know brother Brown said that you are no
[35:54] better than the drunk that get saved one
[35:56] minute ago we we don't
[36:03] really the one that you can still smell
[36:05] it
[36:06] on but but he did his marriage vows you
[36:09] know what I mean and so we're still in
[36:11] flesh and so everybody kind of struggles
[36:15] with cuz you know if you know we rank
[36:19] people beings on their their wisdom and
[36:21] their knowledge and the Revelation that
[36:23] God's give them and and how long they've
[36:26] been in the message and how big their
[36:28] church is and you know or how many
[36:31] bodyguards they have when they leave the
[36:34] church but God
[36:36] don't our Prophet didn't he he said I'm
[36:40] no better than a drunk that was saved
[36:42] one minute
[36:43] ago that's how we're supposed to respect
[36:46] people cuz we're brothers and sisters
[36:49] but we're the the wife of Christ and I
[36:52] want to tell you something just like our
[36:55] adoption scripture in Galatians you you
[36:57] don't have the inheritance if you're not
[37:00] adopted period and when the Rapture
[37:03] comes your feet ain't leaving the ground
[37:07] that's thus saith the word of
[37:09] God because you're not air to nothing
[37:12] until you got the seal on your life
[37:14] which is the baptism of the Holy
[37:16] Ghost and that's adoption but you can
[37:19] take that the exact same way in marriage
[37:22] is adoption you get your name change
[37:26] when you're married
[37:29] do you know a bride I know I know the
[37:31] prophet said this and but there you
[37:33] think of how many people the prophet
[37:34] said when you did your promise that in
[37:37] God's eyes you were the same as marriage
[37:38] but you didn't have a name change
[37:41] yet oh yeah you were Sanctified do you
[37:44] know until a bride goes to the wedding
[37:47] and has a name change and and the
[37:49] marriage is consumated that it's very
[37:51] easy for a bride to change your
[37:55] mind it's very easy for a groom to
[37:58] change his mind but when you've drove
[38:00] your Stak
[38:02] home and you got a new
[38:07] name see Dad men don't
[38:12] argue I
[38:14] promise that for richer or poorer makes
[38:17] no difference me you know Pastor barley
[38:18] when he was preaching sity convicted me
[38:20] he said Believers don't
[38:24] worry my goodness I have a whole new
[38:28] approach you know when when we're going
[38:30] to newand you know me and Lan were I
[38:33] even talked to some of you brothers and
[38:34] I oh man can you know we think about
[38:38] things cuz we're adults you know we
[38:40] think about okay you know are the dots
[38:43] all meeting you know what I mean and
[38:47] literally literally I mean it was it was
[38:50] Supernatural you want to see something
[38:53] Supernatural I literally felt to tell
[38:55] the when if the tickets were less or the
[38:57] same buy the tickets literally the very
[38:59] next day or two we got the bill for the
[39:02] back window and we got the bill from the
[39:04] town for putting in the
[39:06] street I'm like woo
[39:10] Glory if I would have knew two days
[39:15] ago and it was just like brother Bartley
[39:17] hit play so Christians don't worry I
[39:20] just I just went to bed at night and
[39:22] said God you got a couple bills to pay
[39:24] I'm going to Newland you take care of
[39:26] everything when I get back
[39:30] I mean what would have my worry
[39:34] changed amen but we we think sometimes
[39:37] we're going to help God in all these
[39:39] things
[39:40] amen God help us to understand we need
[39:43] to understand that unless we're married
[39:46] here we're not going on a
[39:49] honeymoon you get married before you go
[39:52] on honeymoon our Prophet said that
[39:59] amen let's read a quote and proven his
[40:02] word he said it's no more as a church
[40:04] see it's no more he said the bride is
[40:06] called he said in the day that the son
[40:08] of man is revealed he said what join a
[40:11] church to the Head United in the
[40:14] marriage of the Bride the bridegroom has
[40:17] come right into this and when the son of
[40:19] man comes down and the human flesh
[40:21] they're United together and the church
[40:23] is the word and the word the two are
[40:26] united together together to do that and
[40:29] it manifests a revealing of the son of
[40:32] man and see the son of man Jesus Christ
[40:35] will come down into human flesh among us
[40:38] because of
[40:40] marriage see you know when you're
[40:42] married and your wife goes to town she
[40:44] represents you when my wife goes to the
[40:47] bank she is me or she is a langstaff
[40:51] period my wife will tell you it was the
[40:53] weirdest thing for her when she came to
[40:54] brigon that no everybody looked at her
[40:57] like a weirdo because she wasn't from
[40:59] the area she was from
[41:02] Indiana who are
[41:05] you you're asking about Dale's business
[41:08] you're going in the co-op paying Dale's
[41:10] Bill who's this
[41:12] woman
[41:14] amen you know the time and this is a
[41:17] side note because you think of where the
[41:19] thoughts of the people are in the world
[41:21] you know my When We Were Young I was
[41:23] working in uh at work at the elevator
[41:27] and Lan went to the cattle sales with my
[41:29] my dad and the people that had knew my
[41:32] dad for 50 years were just losing their
[41:37] mind laughing
[41:42] uncontrollably because they thought my
[41:44] dad was in his midlife crisis and got a
[41:49] girlfriend that's that's a that's 100%
[41:51] the true story
[41:54] 100% but see Lan was me
[41:58] yeah and she was me at the cattle sale
[42:01] and it was her paying for the cattle but
[42:04] it was me but that how it is with Christ
[42:07] that's why in Galatians it said that
[42:09] when you're air you're air of everything
[42:11] it's you that's the inheritance that's
[42:13] you have the power of healing you have
[42:16] the power of Deliverance amen it's in
[42:19] you you know when when Christ prayed to
[42:22] the father and said father if it be your
[42:24] will take this cup from me but
[42:26] nevertheless
[42:28] not thy will but my will be done who was
[42:31] he talking
[42:33] to
[42:36] himself 100%
[42:39] himself that's why the prophet said that
[42:41] when you're in road rage and somebody
[42:42] cut you off and you say step out of the
[42:45] vehicle we'll s said that your attitude
[42:48] to a reaction can actually change that
[42:51] person's Eternal
[42:52] destination why because you're packing
[42:55] the Deliverance who are you praying to
[42:57] to yourself you're not going to pray to
[42:59] a far away God you got the baptism of
[43:01] the Holy Ghost you oh Father up there
[43:04] somewhere oh my line got cut
[43:08] off because it was Christ in flesh
[43:11] tabernacled Among Us exactly the same
[43:14] Holy Spirit that's in you was Christ in
[43:17] a
[43:18] measure amen God help us to recognize
[43:21] this he said now when we come down to
[43:23] the human flesh Among Us it will make
[43:25] his word so real that the the church and
[43:27] him are one and the bride and she'll go
[43:29] home to the wedding supper and she's
[43:31] already United he says this multiple
[43:34] times she's already married and she'll
[43:36] go home to the wedding supper amen he's
[43:38] already United the wedding supper not to
[43:41] a marriage filled in the
[43:44] flesh and all the Flesh of man is gone
[43:48] you know when you seal you know brother
[43:50] Brown talked about the baptism of the
[43:52] Holy Ghost and he talked about the train
[43:54] car and I have that quote in here but
[43:56] I'm just going to paraphrase it you know
[43:58] he said you can fire in all your dishes
[44:01] and all your furniture and all your
[44:03] clothes and just fire it in there and
[44:06] say okay I got it that's how some
[44:08] Believers say well I got it I went to
[44:10] church I got it you know I get saved I
[44:13] got it I got it all fired in there but
[44:15] no but this the the the inspector called
[44:19] Jehovah has to come by and he says did
[44:23] we do our wedding vows yet
[44:27] and he walks through and he goes oh
[44:29] that's poor we'll put it up there we'll
[44:30] put it on the top oh this is Rich and
[44:33] heavy I'll put it on the
[44:35] bottom and he packes the
[44:38] container but when that Holy Ghost
[44:40] Jehovah shuts the
[44:43] door
[44:44] amen it's it's it's not a amen when you
[44:47] say I
[44:49] do when the door is shut that's till the
[44:52] day of your redemption in God's mind
[44:54] you're already glorified if if you're
[44:57] you can't be glorified until you get a
[44:59] night name change it was him that CED
[45:03] you it was him that no man father except
[45:06] the father draws him who was according
[45:08] who it wasn't you that desired to serve
[45:11] God it was God that came and was looking
[45:14] for the part of him that he placed in
[45:16] there before the foundation of the world
[45:18] and it was him wooing you back to
[45:19] himself and he was just pulling you in
[45:21] like this Sending You Flowers and gifts
[45:23] and
[45:24] presents until the he came and expected
[45:27] he said you got everything you need
[45:29] here's my
[45:31] name Christ the anointed one and he
[45:34] closes the door and it's good for the
[45:37] whole journey but you ain't going in
[45:40] that
[45:42] Journey if you haven't been shot you
[45:45] know when you look at Ephesians 5:2
[45:48] 22-32 and we're not going to read that
[45:51] but that's the whole scripture about
[45:53] wives and husbands but if you go to the
[45:56] end scripture verse Ephesians 5:32 and
[45:58] you can pull that up it says for this is
[46:00] a great
[46:03] mystery concerning the
[46:06] Christ and the church so if if that was
[46:10] a great mystery and you leave that up
[46:12] the concerning great mystery it was
[46:14] wives who are we Christ's wife
[46:18] wives submit to Jehovah submit to the
[46:23] anointed one wives honor your husbands
[46:26] wives
[46:27] obey obedience is better than sacrifice
[46:30] this was it has very little I mean it's
[46:33] used for fleshly relationships but God
[46:36] had a way bigger plan for this it was
[46:39] talking about you the bride the wife of
[46:42] Christ and himself spiritually
[46:47] speaking because when they asked Moses
[46:51] he said it was not so from the
[46:53] beginning but for the hardness
[46:57] of their Leo to seeing
[47:01] Hearts well bless God that's not the way
[47:03] I see
[47:05] it divorce was never ever an
[47:08] option and it can't be an option if you
[47:11] actually pumping his blood and pack in
[47:14] his
[47:15] rib we have this warped opinion while I
[47:18] would just get together and we'll part
[47:21] aart that's
[47:24] impossible he would die
[47:28] I would die if you took a rib out my
[47:30] heart would collapse my lung would
[47:32] probably
[47:34] puncture huh I'm talk I'm think of that
[47:37] spiritually speaking we think we can
[47:39] survive without God the world thinks
[47:42] they can survive without their husband
[47:43] or
[47:44] wife but they can't if they were one in
[47:47] the
[47:49] beginning amen is that amen that's right
[47:53] oh
[47:54] Hallelujah a great mystery
[47:57] concerning Christ in the church here's
[47:59] some some quotes just short quotes chist
[48:02] Christ in his church as a bride Christ
[48:04] being one like a husband and wife are
[48:07] one church and the Christ are molded
[48:11] together as one
[48:14] person the same as the Holy Spirit and
[48:16] that's in the seven Church ages you know
[48:17] what you don't have to worry about your
[48:19] body going up it won't be your body
[48:21] it'll be Christ's body going up because
[48:24] you were Christ you were part of him you
[48:27] come from him it's his anointing on you
[48:29] it's it's his germ of life that was in
[48:33] you you don't think Christ can pull
[48:35] himself back to
[48:37] Christ oh my goodness we have lots of
[48:40] examples of that when Jesus went
[48:43] up it was Christ going back to
[48:46] Jehovah the anointed one remember that
[48:50] God is a spirit and those that worship
[48:52] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[48:54] truth we we're putting God off in some
[48:57] big uh Coliseum somewhere in some
[49:00] big university or college or some big
[49:03] church that's got a gold steeple or
[49:07] something God's a spirit God ain't wood
[49:10] this ain't God God ain't flesh God ain't
[49:13] God ain't flesh God can use God can use
[49:16] this wood just as much as he can use his
[49:18] flesh if it's surrendered to him what do
[49:21] you think the church pews are you think
[49:22] they're God you think if you sit in the
[49:24] front Pew or the back pew you got more
[49:26] of God or less God it's no more God
[49:28] than it's it's maybe surrendered to God
[49:31] it's for the purpose of God but that's
[49:32] not God and so people have got God in
[49:35] their church and oh Wyoming church is
[49:38] God it's a beautiful place to meet God
[49:41] and keep the rain off our head today but
[49:44] that's not God that's right God's a
[49:47] spirit and that's how he can be in
[49:49] tabernacled in you and me and all these
[49:52] warped people if you ever go to a place
[49:55] and they're raided with bodyguards or
[49:58] that's completely the spirit of L is
[50:02] garbage it's
[50:05] how that's right if the preacher needs a
[50:07] bodyguard then all the brothers and
[50:09] church need bodyguards because I'm
[50:11] packing gold refined by the fire of the
[50:14] holy spirit that the the robbers can't
[50:17] come in and break away and steal and
[50:19] moth and rust don't
[50:21] corrupt lay up your treasures and so
[50:24] then we' have to get bodyguards for all
[50:26] the sisters because they're the only
[50:28] pure
[50:29] unadulterated beautiful virgin wives of
[50:32] the bride of
[50:34] Christ but oh no we just get that for
[50:36] the five-fold ministry because they're
[50:38] special that's not what God
[50:42] Said Amen World
[50:47] special God help us not to have this
[50:51] religious modern
[50:53] day Doctrine amen
[50:56] Revelations of the brid tree he said
[50:58] I'll go with you here's our Prophet
[51:00] talking he said I will be a he said you
[51:03] will be part of me how can you be a part
[51:06] of somebody that you're not married
[51:08] to or you weren't born from you weren't
[51:11] born from or you're not married to you
[51:14] will be a part of me and you will be in
[51:17] many places he calls Bri and I'm
[51:19] actually going to get to a quote where
[51:21] he actually said the bride is the wife
[51:22] is the same thing the bride
[51:27] because the bride would have already
[51:28] committed her vows and my life will be
[51:31] in your body that's a direct quote the
[51:33] prophet says and my life will be in your
[51:35] body how can your life be in my
[51:40] body that's Christ's
[51:42] life but you're way past
[51:45] salvation see you've had you've had
[51:48] Jehovah come and inspect the
[51:51] car and he said now everything you need
[51:54] for this journey all all the way to the
[51:57] Rapture you're already
[52:00] packing
[52:02] amen if we're not we're
[52:06] deceived we're the most deceived people
[52:08] there ever was we might as well join the
[52:11] the Catholic
[52:12] church and bow to the
[52:17] pope my life will be in your body and
[52:20] just like watch this this is in the
[52:22] restoration bride tree
[52:24] 620422 just like a husband and wife is
[52:28] one
[52:32] person you and I are going to be one and
[52:36] that day I will know that I am in the
[52:38] father and the father in me and I in you
[52:40] and you in me that it that sounds like
[52:43] marriage to
[52:47] me
[52:49] amen hallelujah God help
[52:53] us here in another example of this here
[52:57] it's the tongues of fires set upon each
[53:00] of them and God dividing himself among
[53:03] his church because that's what his
[53:07] wife
[53:10] was his
[53:15] wife and husband and wife is one
[53:19] together and God and the church is one
[53:22] together God in you that's in this world
[53:25] is falling part 63 11:15 if anybody
[53:28] would like to see those amen you see we
[53:32] got this idea that if it's convenient
[53:35] the world has this idea and it's crept
[53:36] in the message that I I you know when we
[53:39] were we were
[53:41] away and in the states there's churches
[53:43] are sometimes very
[53:46] close amen I mean there're sometimes
[53:49] close I mean here London's close Petro's
[53:51] close Windsor's I mean but I had people
[53:54] tell me said the people they just wrote
[53:56] rotate among the
[53:58] churches oh we go here and that sounds
[54:01] kind of boring we'll move
[54:04] on but you can't do that in a
[54:07] marriage amen not with Christ people
[54:10] people want to rotate around god well I
[54:14] think I'll I'll go sew my Wild Oats now
[54:17] and then I'll no you don't sew Wild Oats
[54:20] with God that's a warped opinion that's
[54:24] some new age idea from
[54:27] Hell amen God ain't marrying people that
[54:31] go s so Wild
[54:33] Oats amen e Eve fell and and when Adam
[54:37] came to Eve she was already
[54:40] impregnated and spiritually speaking God
[54:43] came to the denominations and when she
[54:45] was already pregnated by worldly Creeds
[54:48] and dogmas and man's ideas he divorced
[54:52] her there was no marriage he didn't have
[54:54] to divorce her he said get lost I'll
[54:57] find a pure
[55:00] unadulterated that's us sayth the
[55:02] prophet I might have paraphrase that in
[55:05] there but I have the quote in my
[55:07] iPad he ain't marrying somebody like
[55:10] that what are we thinking God divided
[55:12] himself among his people this another
[55:14] quote questions and answers because the
[55:16] church in Christ is one just as a
[55:19] husband and wife are one amen if we if
[55:22] we ain't done our our
[55:25] our vows here and he hasn't come and
[55:29] inspected our
[55:32] vows we ain't going in a
[55:35] Rapture because only Mrs Jesus Christ is
[55:39] going in
[55:41] Rapture it's it's going to be a family

[56:37] here in John 14:23 Jesus answered and
[56:39] said unto them if a man love
[56:43] me he will keep my
[56:45] words and my father will love him and he
[56:49] will come onto him an
[56:52] abode sounds like a relationship to me
[56:57] amen husband and wife relationship what
[57:00] do husbands and wife Abode
[57:03] together amen
[57:08] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus here's
[57:10] another one in questions and answers
[57:12] this is a bit longer just
[57:15] uh forgive me but I believe this is good
[57:18] word for us to to hear what our Prophet
[57:20] says amen and we realize it was anointed
[57:24] and and still anointed and when you used
[57:26] to express that if if I do believe the
[57:29] word we will be eternally
[57:33] separated if we do not sorry believe the
[57:36] word we'll be eternally separated from
[57:38] Christ and do you mean the foolish
[57:39] virgins will live eternally this was a
[57:42] question that was asked to uh brother
[57:45] brandham about the wise virgins and the
[57:48] foolish virgins you know they were they
[57:50] were both message
[57:53] Believers the wise and the foolish they
[57:56] were both virgins so they were both
[57:58] Sanctified they were both
[58:01] holy but one had taken their marage
[58:05] fows one had made a
[58:07] commitment one had actually taken his
[58:10] life into him called the baptism of the
[58:14] Holy Ghost he said absolutely he said I
[58:17] just explained that this morning the
[58:18] same on the same thing you've got to
[58:21] have all the stages he said you can't
[58:23] just be saved and go in a rapture
[58:27] he said you've got to the got you've
[58:30] forgotten
[58:32] you've begotten of the spirit and just
[58:35] as a
[58:39] baby is in a mother's womb he said
[58:42] you're not
[58:44] converted until you're married or until
[58:47] you're adopted and he said the reason
[58:50] for all these great Mysteries is given
[58:52] to Luther could not be given these great
[58:55] Mysteries could not be given to Luther
[58:57] they could not be given to
[59:01] Wesley they could not be given up in the
[59:03] age that is just passed us the
[59:06] Pentecostal age why it wasn't the time
[59:10] yet they were begotten but now the
[59:14] person of Christ himself the son of man
[59:17] do you understand he's revealing
[59:20] himself in the son of man in human flesh
[59:24] like a husband and a
[59:28] wife amen oh praise
[59:33] God thank you Lord Jesus amen is isn't
[59:36] it amazing you know what would be the
[59:38] reason there's only one reason in
[59:41] today's world that somebody don't want
[59:43] to go to a
[59:46] marriage now if you were looking at a
[59:49] child standpoint in Galatians and you
[59:51] were looking at adopted and and you
[59:53] didn't and you know the father and
[59:55] mother gets a tutor
[59:56] and they raise up the kid and he's a
[59:58] rotten spoiled rotten bride he's a
[1:00:00] silver spoon
[1:00:02] he's good for nothing needs a kick in
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:07] teeth if he refuses to change he's never
[1:00:11] adopted if he don't follow the
[1:00:15] tutor which is the word of God the
[1:00:18] instruction book that the mom and dad
[1:00:20] give to him which would be Jehovah he
[1:00:22] ain't never going to have signning
[1:00:24] authority on that bank account
[1:00:27] that's why that's why the prophet said
[1:00:29] things like this the that women that cut
[1:00:31] their hair can't even
[1:00:34] pray because they men that mistreat
[1:00:37] their wives like dogs can't even pray oh
[1:00:40] you can pray but God has zero obligation
[1:00:45] to answer your prayers that's right oh
[1:00:49] absolutely
[1:00:54] zero what about how we treat treat each
[1:00:56] other that's packing the Holy
[1:01:00] Ghost you treat them in some kind of a
[1:01:03] different level the Bible calls it sin
[1:01:07] and guilty of the whole
[1:01:09] law which would make God completely oh
[1:01:12] bless God I'm praying I pray for an hour
[1:01:15] a day but I never see it answered it's
[1:01:18] because God ain't required to answer it
[1:01:21] because you're not adopted yet you
[1:01:24] haven't bonded with him yet yet and
[1:01:26] marriage
[1:01:28] commitment
[1:01:32] Hallelujah God help
[1:01:34] us he says it'll change your nature when
[1:01:37] you're converted we we read that last
[1:01:40] night your old nature dies you know a a
[1:01:43] a a man a a dad man don't talk a dad man
[1:01:47] don't have an
[1:01:49] opinion you know you know we have a a a
[1:01:52] PEC every relationship's peculiar
[1:01:57] right we'll go out to a restaurant every
[1:02:00] one of yours is peculiar just it's all
[1:02:03] right me and my wife we go out to a
[1:02:05] restaurant and Lan always pays because I
[1:02:08] don't want to carry my wallet and I'm
[1:02:10] fat and so she has all the money she
[1:02:12] pays she gets in the car and says thanks
[1:02:13] for supper I say thanks for supper
[1:02:17] wasn't my money it was your
[1:02:20] money and normally we say well thank you
[1:02:22] Jesus for
[1:02:24] supper you see how it is but see if
[1:02:27] you're divided you keep
[1:02:30] score but see you can't keep score on
[1:02:33] God and you can't keep scoring your
[1:02:35] husband and wife if you're if you're not
[1:02:37] divided it's like well it's been a long
[1:02:39] time since
[1:02:43] she who's keeping score it's one
[1:02:49] person if that was me I would say it's
[1:02:51] been a long time since she lets me get
[1:02:52] in an airplane go for a trip she said
[1:02:55] but there no money honey said we got to
[1:02:58] pray
[1:03:00] harder amen you see how you you
[1:03:02] literally think
[1:03:05] differently so like Pastor barley was
[1:03:08] here and you you you you you believe
[1:03:11] you're in God's will and you're going to
[1:03:12] go to Newland and you're going to see
[1:03:14] Believers and you're going to go to a
[1:03:15] church camp in St John's and the next
[1:03:18] day you get a bill you just say
[1:03:20] well no problem cuz
[1:03:23] see I think differently
[1:03:27] see that's a mystery see it's really not
[1:03:29] my bill because I'm one with Christ CU
[1:03:32] it's in a
[1:03:34] marriage amen you don't think God has
[1:03:37] the ability that's how that's how a
[1:03:40] natural relationship would be you know
[1:03:42] when we were young and I was foolish and
[1:03:45] I would spend way more money than any
[1:03:47] human being could ever possibly pay my
[1:03:50] wife was very wise she had education and
[1:03:54] she would just lay out the tractor paint
[1:03:56] on the desk you
[1:03:58] just Farm credit
[1:04:00] payment and she'd do it maybe maybe even
[1:04:03] a few days or months
[1:04:06] before and wasn't her
[1:04:09] payments but that's how we're supposed
[1:04:11] to be with
[1:04:13] God Amen are we not if you have a need
[1:04:17] in your body you're supposed to worry
[1:04:18] about it or you just say hey God this is
[1:04:20] your body you have a need with your
[1:04:22] children you're supposed to worry about
[1:04:23] it lay awake at night or just say God
[1:04:25] they're your kids you gave them to me
[1:04:28] you couldn't had them without him giving
[1:04:29] them to you so you just go to sleep and
[1:04:32] you sleep like a baby cuz they're God's
[1:04:33] kids anyway cuz whatever he
[1:04:36] predestinated he won't lose
[1:04:39] any that's right but we think somehow
[1:04:42] because if God sees that we're laying
[1:04:44] awake and we're more sincere he'll
[1:04:46] answer it more it don't work that
[1:04:49] way don't work that
[1:04:51] way God help us
[1:04:56] so when we we have to go through a death
[1:04:59] that's why there's no marriage nowadays
[1:05:01] and that's why people just shack up
[1:05:03] because the day that they have a
[1:05:05] disagreement they're gone they don't
[1:05:08] have to change their name back they
[1:05:10] don't have to go see the lawyer they
[1:05:12] don't own no property together they have
[1:05:14] no assets together it's just I take my
[1:05:16] clothes and I walk and that's how most
[1:05:19] people are serving Christ in our age
[1:05:22] because it's the realm of the spirit
[1:05:24] around us that's how people hold their
[1:05:26] jobs Jared has guys that you know oh my
[1:05:30] goodness they'd give you a headache you
[1:05:31] know they uh they wake up and the truck
[1:05:34] don't start or they got you know
[1:05:35] whatever they got a problem they don't
[1:05:37] bother calling and that maybe two or
[1:05:39] three days later their wife will call
[1:05:41] what kind of a commitment is
[1:05:43] that it's cuz there is no commitment
[1:05:46] there's no commitment in the world it's
[1:05:48] just well like
[1:05:51] whatever
[1:05:53] amen but you know the Bible says that
[1:05:57] those that are going to go in a Rapture
[1:05:59] are watching for him and the Bible also
[1:06:02] says that those that are going in a
[1:06:03] Rapture are
[1:06:05] adopted Sons and Daughters they've had a
[1:06:08] name change they actually in the
[1:06:10] adoption of their kids they actually had
[1:06:12] a
[1:06:14] ceremony that sounds like a wedding to
[1:06:17] me you know they have a
[1:06:20] ceremony and they
[1:06:22] say is there anybody here that disagrees
[1:06:25] that these two shall be
[1:06:29] tained
[1:06:31] amen God help us
[1:06:37] Amen in Matthew let's pull that up uh
[1:06:41] Vicky please Matthew 12 43:45 and I'll
[1:06:44] just read this this is what happens so
[1:06:46] many and this is a very very sad story
[1:06:49] in for uh people that are hanging around
[1:06:52] the truth amen here's here's people that
[1:06:56] decide to serve God they they they you
[1:06:59] know this what the prophet
[1:07:01] said he said they're around the true
[1:07:04] anointing they're around the True
[1:07:06] Believer and they feel something it's
[1:07:10] different you you've had that happen in
[1:07:12] the grocery store every one of you it's
[1:07:14] it's not zoned to just or different sort
[1:07:16] and they feel something there's just
[1:07:18] something and they they're like you know
[1:07:21] you had somebody that going to miss talk
[1:07:23] or or say something oh
[1:07:28] and so they feel it and they want to be
[1:07:30] like you and this is what happens and
[1:07:34] when the unclean spirit said when out
[1:07:35] from the man he cleans himself up and he
[1:07:38] walks through Dry places seeking rest
[1:07:40] and finds
[1:07:42] none he he's got rid he said now I want
[1:07:44] to quit stealing quit smoking and quit
[1:07:47] flirting you know doing whatever quit
[1:07:49] looking at you know doing things that
[1:07:51] Christians do but he ain't got sealed by
[1:07:55] Jehovah
[1:07:57] and he's walking around this dry space
[1:07:59] and he says well I'll return into my
[1:08:01] house this is the evil spirit from
[1:08:03] whence I came and when he came back he
[1:08:05] finds a house beautifully
[1:08:09] cleaned and empty now you know why it
[1:08:12] was
[1:08:13] empty because God hadn't adopted that
[1:08:17] person God had never said I
[1:08:22] will that's why it was empty
[1:08:27] and that evil spirit goes and says
[1:08:29] praise the lord we got a clean house
[1:08:32] let's bring four more demons F seven
[1:08:34] more demons with us seven more other
[1:08:37] spirits that are more wicked than
[1:08:39] himself and enter in and dwell therein
[1:08:41] and the last state of the man which was
[1:08:44] worse than the first why because he
[1:08:47] never got
[1:08:49] married he never got filled he never got
[1:08:53] adopted he never got a name Chang
[1:08:56] change was worse than and even so shall
[1:09:00] it be also
[1:09:02] unto this wicked generation look at that
[1:09:06] last
[1:09:10] sentence that's what's happening in
[1:09:12] church there's people that's sitting
[1:09:14] around people that hang around you know
[1:09:16] that's what I said when when we preached
[1:09:18] on not not converted you know that's how
[1:09:20] people could come and Minister the the
[1:09:22] the the the Bible and the message for 30
[1:09:24] years and just just walk right away from
[1:09:26] it cuz they never ever were
[1:09:29] filled you can't you know you know like
[1:09:32] we said with the the the train car and
[1:09:35] the inspector comes and he seals
[1:09:38] it hello it's sealed when you're
[1:09:43] impregnated with
[1:09:50] Christ you can't take Satan's
[1:09:53] seed your worm's already full
[1:09:58] amen even so shall it be in this wicked
[1:10:02] generation and here I already mentioned
[1:10:04] this at my next quote was you know and
[1:10:07] I'd read this in the converted where
[1:10:09] people
[1:10:10] 20,000 would get saved and they'd come
[1:10:12] back two weeks later the prophet says
[1:10:14] they weren't ex converted he
[1:10:17] said he said they accepted Christ as
[1:10:20] their personal savior but they're still
[1:10:22] not
[1:10:23] converted converted means that you're
[1:10:26] changed converted don't just mean that
[1:10:29] I'm going to church converted don't mean
[1:10:32] that you're wearing a tie and packing a
[1:10:33] suit or a beautiful dress or something
[1:10:36] no your whole life
[1:10:38] changes
[1:10:42] amen you know when Jacob wrestled with
[1:10:45] the
[1:10:46] angel his walk changed because the angel
[1:10:50] grabbed his
[1:10:53] thigh you can Google that the Bible
[1:10:56] talks about it we might come to that
[1:10:58] scripture yet now this ain't to be funny
[1:11:01] but I want you to get the point Christ
[1:11:03] wants did you ever see a
[1:11:05] sister that's very far along in
[1:11:10] pregnancy thank you sister Joanie she
[1:11:14] walks
[1:11:17] differently do you ever see somebody
[1:11:19] that's so full of
[1:11:22] Christ you can't even they're just come
[1:11:25] completely their presence is like
[1:11:27] magnetic and they're sweet and they're
[1:11:30] humble and they don't want to be seen by
[1:11:31] anybody and they're trying to hide and
[1:11:33] they give you the front seat and they
[1:11:35] take the back seat and
[1:11:38] they they walk
[1:11:41] differently you know like a pregnant on
[1:11:44] I can't do it cuz I've never been
[1:11:45] pregnant but they they
[1:11:48] waddle do you ever see a duck they walk
[1:11:52] different amen but when you got Christ
[1:11:55] you walk differently that's why when you
[1:11:58] go up town
[1:12:02] everybody my wife was in the mall I
[1:12:04] think I told Brother laurren s brother
[1:12:05] Bartley this or so I told somebody this
[1:12:07] don't and she she's seen some old people
[1:12:10] old so this wasn't funny or nothing they
[1:12:13] were older than us by long
[1:12:18] shot and the guy's looking at Len like
[1:12:25] she comes up to Leen and I think he was
[1:12:28] just a little squirt of an 80-year-old
[1:12:29] man you know and he goes like he
[1:12:32] probably can hardly why and he said am I
[1:12:35] lying honey am I lying no thank you and
[1:12:39] he said can I touch your
[1:12:42] hair and he rubs his hand down her hair
[1:12:46] back and he looks over at his wife and
[1:12:48] he says why can't you have
[1:12:53] that no my wife never witnessed to him
[1:12:57] she never preached to him she didn't
[1:12:59] pass out a message book of The Seven
[1:13:01] Church ages or the mystery
[1:13:03] of what those are all
[1:13:06] true but she had a different walk she
[1:13:10] looked so
[1:13:12] peculiar that his wife was in his
[1:13:15] husband was insulting his wife in my
[1:13:17] wife's
[1:13:18] pres I hope this don't come to
[1:13:22] Arms amen
[1:13:25] because you can't be
[1:13:28] married you can't be
[1:13:31] adopted you know I I I I don't know if
[1:13:34] you're getting this you know my neighbor
[1:13:37] uh Garnet McCormack he he had a big
[1:13:40] plant job and when I was younger and
[1:13:43] skinnier I had more cows than I have now

[1:13:52] kids to the sale and I didn't know this
[1:13:54] doctor he told me directly to
[1:13:56] himself this is an adopted son and he
[1:14:00] told his kids he
[1:14:01] said

[1:14:32] those kids could walk in the sail bar

[1:14:41] money they were spending Papa's money
[1:14:45] and papa had give them strict
[1:14:49] orders D's cows come in just put your
[1:14:52] hand up goo boooop
[1:14:57] if I would have knew that I would have
[1:14:59] sat beside him and put my hand up
[1:15:01] one just to kind of help things
[1:15:07] along he didn't tell me that till after
[1:15:09] I got way less cattle but see that man
[1:15:12] wed my calves and he lived two miles
[1:15:16] from me and he watched them all summer
[1:15:19] like Jehovah's watching you all summer
[1:15:22] and he's saying now listen you're not
[1:15:24] coming coming home without them in your
[1:15:26] hand there's it's not a possibility
[1:15:29] they're going to be every one of my
[1:15:31] sheep are going to be there you know and
[1:15:32] each when when Israel left Egypt they
[1:15:35] they took they took
[1:15:37] everything they even took their back
[1:15:39] wages for
[1:15:41] slavery because it says they took the
[1:15:43] wealth of Egypt they took all the cows
[1:15:45] they didn't leave the m and goats behind
[1:15:47] they didn't leave the Lambs behind which
[1:15:49] are disgusting to eat mutton but you see
[1:15:52] what I mean they took everything
[1:15:55] they took the young man and they took
[1:15:57] the old
[1:15:58] man because it was
[1:16:00] Jehovah's it was his promise
[1:16:04] family it was chosen you
[1:16:07] see but that can only
[1:16:10] happen if you're
[1:16:13] his amen that can only happen if you're
[1:16:16] his if you got his name he ain't leaving
[1:16:19] you
[1:16:21] behind it's not like the parents that
[1:16:24] got a whole bunch of kids and when they
[1:16:26] get in the van they start the van and if
[1:16:28] the van sounds noisy and it looks kind
[1:16:30] of full they just drive away they don't
[1:16:32] matter who's kids are in
[1:16:35] there
[1:16:37] cuz I heard parents say you know when
[1:16:40] they during the Depression they would
[1:16:41] ring the bell and pray that they didn't
[1:16:43] all hear it or
[1:16:45] come they W they weren't worried about
[1:16:47] cooking three different meals
[1:16:49] or you
[1:16:51] see but
[1:16:53] Christ spiritually speaking he ain't
[1:16:56] leaving you hungry you're I mean the
[1:16:59] Bible says if he you being evil and how
[1:17:01] to give good gifts to your children and
[1:17:03] him being Jehovah God
[1:17:08] hello amen God help
[1:17:12] us God help
[1:17:14] us but in this
[1:17:16] generation we're self I don't mean you
[1:17:19] guys I'm just saying the spirit on Lea
[1:17:22] is people's rights my rights and it's me
[1:17:27] first me I me myself and I what's good
[1:17:32] for me what can I get out of this
[1:17:35] opportunity what can I get out of this
[1:17:38] relationship I'm going to you know they
[1:17:40] having different countries not so much
[1:17:42] here but and and and sadly very sadly to
[1:17:46] say even in the churches brother Bernard
[1:17:49] I'm sorry and not just you and the
[1:17:51] philippin they talk about marrying up
[1:17:54] yeah well their family was rich and
[1:17:57] connected in the
[1:18:00] government and we were just
[1:18:03] peasants and they married way up way and
[1:18:07] you know what lots of countries that's
[1:18:10] completely
[1:18:11] forbidden because the bride ain't going
[1:18:14] to come and pack an inheritance to the
[1:18:16] groom site and they want they want to
[1:18:19] bring the richest and the richest and
[1:18:21] bring them
[1:18:23] together but Christ's family is
[1:18:25] completely different than
[1:18:28] that Christ had
[1:18:30] everything and you were born and sin
[1:18:32] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:18:34] speaking lies and he said that's my
[1:18:37] little child right
[1:18:39] there amen oh praise God that's
[1:18:42] beautiful
[1:18:44] amen so we see that
[1:18:48] people
[1:18:52] sadly are self-willed self-governed and
[1:18:55] self
[1:18:57] Direction and they will only marry or
[1:19:01] stay
[1:19:02] married autonomy in one of these
[1:19:05] Scriptures it mentioned autonomy and it
[1:19:07] was Independence freedom and
[1:19:09] self-direction was the meaning of
[1:19:11] autonomy that oh maybe our Prophet said
[1:19:13] that it was personal value and freedom
[1:19:16] of your own
[1:19:18] will
[1:19:19] amen that won't work in God's family if
[1:19:23] you've reached adopt option and that's
[1:19:25] why most people haven't went far enough
[1:19:29] is because they're not willing to make
[1:19:30] the commitment amen God help
[1:19:38] us I want to read a quote and and this
[1:19:41] quote is not based on our natural life
[1:19:45] and this this is going to but I just
[1:19:47] it's based on it's it's something the
[1:19:49] prophet said but I want to use it as a
[1:19:52] spiritual connection brother Bram said
[1:19:55] he said I remember one day when we when
[1:19:58] his family were getting married he said
[1:20:00] when they were young he's talking about
[1:20:03] his parents he said I was just a little
[1:20:05] bitty
[1:20:06] fellow I'm sure many of you have heard
[1:20:08] the story this is in his life story in
[1:20:10] 51 he said but I want you to catch what
[1:20:14] he means
[1:20:15] spiritually and see because we've the
[1:20:18] our society has
[1:20:21] changed you're going to disagree with
[1:20:23] the prophet right here okay I'll
[1:20:24] guarantee you you will so you can just
[1:20:26] be prepared to he said when I was
[1:20:30] born my daddy was
[1:20:33] 18 and my mama was 15 you still agreeing
[1:20:38] with the
[1:20:40] prophet anybody got daughters that's
[1:20:43] when she was
[1:20:45] born
[1:20:47] born you don't like that quote do
[1:20:50] you but it's still a quote
[1:20:55] and he
[1:20:58] said I was born and we were just
[1:21:02] children and we all grew up together now
[1:21:05] that's ends with a period I'm going to
[1:21:08] quote it directly it's paragraph 22 in
[1:21:10] my life story he said I think that was a
[1:21:15] good
[1:21:17] thing you still think he's your
[1:21:21] prophet he ends out with the period and
[1:21:24] then he carries on and he says and I
[1:21:29] do actually I'm sorry he he he takes the
[1:21:32] end out he says I do so he repeats it
[1:21:36] twice that it was a good thing that his
[1:21:39] mama was 15 when he was
[1:21:44] born and now he explains
[1:21:46] why because like the first
[1:21:50] Eve she got impregnated before Adam got
[1:21:54] to her
[1:21:55] and he said my little girl when they get
[1:21:57] to the age and finds a good Christian
[1:22:00] boy he said I want her to marry and he
[1:22:03] said I'd rather him marry him and settle
[1:22:05] down and be a lady than be out in some
[1:22:08] of these roadhouses running around and
[1:22:11] what they call having a good
[1:22:15] time that's right the Bible says now
[1:22:19] this is in
[1:22:21] preferences in the message
[1:22:25] I have never I've actually maybe heard
[1:22:28] one two at the max but in 40 years I've
[1:22:31] never
[1:22:32] really I've never heard a preacher in
[1:22:35] North America mention
[1:22:37] this oh maybe
[1:22:39] one this what this what our Prophet says
[1:22:43] he says that's right the Bible
[1:22:46] says let your daughters marry
[1:22:50] young when's the last time anybody heard
[1:22:52] that preached
[1:22:58] wait a minute that's the message and the
[1:23:01] prophet said that was in the
[1:23:06] Bible see we're religious too we don't
[1:23:09] like that quote so we don't go
[1:23:14] there I'll say it for you
[1:23:19] ouch let's shake that one off
[1:23:25] he said ' that's right the Bible says
[1:23:27] and it's in parenthesis to catch your
[1:23:29] attention let your daughters marry young
[1:23:33] someone already turned aside after
[1:23:38] Satan see when we see new Believers come
[1:23:42] in the best thing they can get is the
[1:23:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost get them
[1:23:49] baptize and get them with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:52] the bible promises that those that make
[1:23:54] a commitment and they're baptized shall
[1:23:59] not maybe shall receive the gift of the
[1:24:02] Holy Ghost
[1:24:03] shall that's guaranteed that's money in
[1:24:06] the
[1:24:07] bank I shall combine beans this
[1:24:11] fall that's better than that CU it's
[1:24:14] raining a lot that's why the prophet
[1:24:17] never ever
[1:24:20] ever ever listen to me
[1:24:23] children that's why the prophet never
[1:24:25] ever denied water for
[1:24:29] baptism I don't care if they're two they
[1:24:32] want to be baptized if they get
[1:24:33] re-baptized at 15 or 20 or a
[1:24:37] 100 but it's a
[1:24:40] promise never ever turn down water ever
[1:24:44] never say they I boom do it CU it's a
[1:24:49] god-given
[1:24:51] promise that it's a type that you're
[1:24:53] bearing your you're telling publicly I'm
[1:24:57] married or I'm dead and you buried the
[1:25:01] old man in
[1:25:03] water and now Christ can say
[1:25:06] okay I'll take
[1:25:09] you amen God help us natural types of
[1:25:14] spiritual marrying Christ you got to die
[1:25:16] out to yourself and really have a
[1:25:19] conversion and a conversion is not your
[1:25:22] testimony God could care less very
[1:25:24] little about your testimony he wants to
[1:25:27] watch your
[1:25:30] life Hallelujah not just
[1:25:33] saved not just
[1:25:35] Sanctified you know there's thousands of
[1:25:38] people like that I was raised
[1:25:41] Westland they're good people Dom menites
[1:25:45] good people clean
[1:25:49] people but is their house just swep and
[1:25:52] empty is it
[1:25:55] if they haven't received
[1:25:57] Jehovah if they haven't received the
[1:25:59] baptism of the Holy
[1:26:03] Ghost it won't matter if their host is
[1:26:05] clean whether they got one Spirit or
[1:26:07] seven spirits they're lost they're not
[1:26:12] converted amen Luke 1 30 and
[1:26:17] 31 it was hurry here
[1:26:20] sorry Luke 1 I want to show you
[1:26:23] something here and I want to read read
[1:26:24] some of these scriptures now I'm going
[1:26:25] to tell you what I'm going to add some
[1:26:27] emphasis to make it up to date and the
[1:26:30] angel came unto Mary and said fear not
[1:26:33] Mary now think spiritual think spiritual
[1:26:37] for thou art highly favored
[1:26:41] predestinated elected of God and behold
[1:26:45] Thou shalt conceive the word of God in
[1:26:48] thy womb the Holy Ghost and bring forth
[1:26:51] Jehovah a son and shall call his name
[1:26:57] Jesus and then Mary said unto the angel
[1:27:00] how shall this be seeing that I am not
[1:27:05] known I've never joined the church I'm
[1:27:09] not known in Creeds and dogmas and
[1:27:11] doctrines of men and the angel answered
[1:27:13] unto her and said unto her the Holy
[1:27:15] Ghost shall come upon you and you'll
[1:27:19] have a new
[1:27:20] birth and the power of the high
[1:27:24] highest shall overshadow thee and
[1:27:26] therefore also the holy thing which
[1:27:29] shall be in Born of thee Shall be
[1:27:33] Called
[1:27:36] Jehovah and Mary said unto her him that
[1:27:39] angel those amazing
[1:27:42] words
[1:27:45] Behold The handmade of God you could say
[1:27:49] Behold The Bride of the Lord
[1:27:54] be it onto
[1:27:56] me in marriage according to Thy word
[1:28:01] Mary's death to God's will did she
[1:28:04] understand it she didn't have a clue
[1:28:06] what that guy was talking
[1:28:09] about and the angel departed from her
[1:28:12] now if we look back at that if we jump
[1:28:15] to Matthew
[1:28:17] 18-22 I want to show you something here
[1:28:25] Joseph heard this
[1:28:29] testimony and he was
[1:28:32] some
[1:28:35] bewildered Matthew
[1:28:38] 1 18 and 22 let's go to 18
[1:28:43] uh start at 18
[1:28:45] sorry Matthew 18:18 and now the birth of
[1:28:49] Jesus Christ was on this wise that when
[1:28:51] Mo his mother Mary was exposed
[1:28:54] saved and Sanctified see they were
[1:28:57] engaged she was living a good Godly
[1:29:00] life you know the prophet said there was
[1:29:02] lots of virgin girls that could have
[1:29:04] been picked
[1:29:06] then but she wasn't converted
[1:29:09] yet she was esposed to Joseph but behold
[1:29:13] they came together behold before they
[1:29:15] came together she was Matthew
[1:29:20] 1 I'm sorry Matthew 1:1 18-22 sorry
[1:29:24] sorry I told you wrong sorry I'm bad and
[1:29:28] before they came together Mary was found
[1:29:31] already
[1:29:34] expecting and Joseph being just a human
[1:29:37] being said
[1:29:46] uhoh that was
[1:29:49] Supernatural that she'd received the
[1:29:50] baptism of the holy ghost in her womb
[1:29:54] that's what Christ
[1:29:57] was and Joseph her husband being a just
[1:30:00] man and not willing to make her a public
[1:30:02] Exempted was mindful to put her
[1:30:04] away
[1:30:06] privately verse 20 and while he thought
[1:30:08] on these things behold the angel of the
[1:30:10] Lord appeared onto him in a dream saying
[1:30:13] Joseph thou son of
[1:30:15] David what did he say to
[1:30:18] Mary what did what did the angel say to
[1:30:20] Mary when he came to Mary he said fear
[1:30:22] not what did he say to Joseph when he
[1:30:24] came to Joseph to say Mary's
[1:30:30] okay he said fear not to take thee
[1:30:33] Mary
[1:30:36] thy
[1:30:38] wife I want to show you how the
[1:30:40] scripture changed in the last scripture
[1:30:42] we read he said they were a
[1:30:46] spoused now God's saying you're going to
[1:30:49] be
[1:30:50] wife there's a difference
[1:30:56] so fear not to take thee Mary thy wife
[1:31:00] into marriage here for which is
[1:31:02] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:05] and she shall bring forth the Son of God
[1:31:09] the seed and thou shalt call his name
[1:31:11] Jesus and he shall save the people from
[1:31:13] their sin and now all this was done that
[1:31:16] it might be fulfilled what was spoken of
[1:31:19] the Lord by the
[1:31:20] prophets in this last day there will be
[1:31:25] another
[1:31:27] wife and it'll be the second
[1:31:31] Eve and God's Not
[1:31:33] Afraid because of the promise of her
[1:31:38] Fallen amen this second Eve will never
[1:31:42] be
[1:31:43] impregnated with denominational Creeds
[1:31:46] and man's
[1:31:48] ideas because she will already be
[1:31:52] married she will already be in a
[1:31:56] relationship amen hallelujah Revelations
[1:32:00] 19 I'm I'm winding down here just
[1:32:02] finishing some scripture Revelations
[1:32:03] 19:6 and8 and behold I Heard a Voice of
[1:32:06] great multitude which was people and the
[1:32:08] voice of many Waters and the voice of

[1:32:25] she shall be raid in fine linen clean
[1:32:28] and white for the fine linen is a
[1:32:31] righteousness of the Saints amen
[1:32:33] Revelations 21
[1:32:38] and9 and there came unto me the seventh
[1:32:41] angels and the Seven vows that were full
[1:32:43] in the last plagues and talked with me
[1:32:46] saying come up hither and I will show
[1:32:49] you the
[1:32:51] bride that has changed
[1:32:55] to be
[1:32:56] wife the bride that's the Lamb's wife

[1:33:02] God oh amen
[1:33:05] hallelujah and that that let's just a
[1:33:08] I'm just wrapping it up here and he said
[1:33:11] that's the way Christians is so he said
[1:33:12] we're planted together in Christ Jesus
[1:33:15] who is the inexhaustible Fountain of
[1:33:17] Life and when you're planted in Christ

[1:34:03] Rapture is right now in you amen and he
[1:34:09] watch this in paragraph 86 he said now
[1:34:11] don't resist
[1:34:12] that that's the truth the Rapture is in
[1:34:15] us now and he said I can prove that by
[1:34:17] the gospel he said those that he called
[1:34:20] he justified and those that he justified
[1:34:22] he is glorified Hallelujah and they're
[1:34:24] in heaven and then in Heavenly today
[1:34:27] they're they're glorified in the
[1:34:29] presence of God right now just pushing
[1:34:31] out that's all you have to do God's in
[1:34:34] his word do you believe it amen to get
[1:34:38] to that point in Revelations 2213 and 14
[1:34:42] for I am Alpha and Omega that's just the
[1:34:44] beginning and the end that's everything
[1:34:46] is in Christ the beginning and the end
[1:34:48] the first and the last blessed are he
[1:34:51] that do his Commandments
[1:34:53] that they may have the right to the tree
[1:34:56] of life and may enter in through the
[1:34:58] gates unto the city that's Revelations
[1:35:02] 14 22 and
[1:35:04] 14 Luke 6 and 45 and a good man out of
[1:35:10] the good Treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:35:12] forth that which is good and an evil man
[1:35:16] out of the treasures of his heart
[1:35:18] bringeth forth that which is evil and
[1:35:20] for the abundance of the heart
[1:35:27] the mouth speaks and says I will I
[1:35:31] do man brother
[1:35:33] brandham he said now that and there
[1:35:36] there's three and now the next thing to
[1:35:38] do is you're born again and when you
[1:35:40] receive the baptism Holy Ghost and
[1:35:42] that's when you're converted when you're
[1:35:45] married that's when you're converted and
[1:35:47] you might be in the process of
[1:35:49] conversion you might be in a courtship
[1:35:52] but until you get a name name
[1:35:54] change you are you ain't going nowhere
[1:35:58] he said and you're not converted until
[1:36:01] it's completely and you're
[1:36:04] sealed into the kingdom of God and
[1:36:07] sealed down just like that starting the
[1:36:10] box car out there and I already
[1:36:11] mentioned
[1:36:12] that and the inspector says nope not
[1:36:17] yet but as soon as it gets the whole
[1:36:20] thing loaded up and it's sealed in and
[1:36:22] it's piked right
[1:36:24] the do slam shut and the inspector puts
[1:36:27] a seal on it and there you are she's
[1:36:29] ready and
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:32] filled and ready to be
[1:36:35] gone
[1:36:38] Hallelujah born again isn't just because
[1:36:42] you
[1:36:44] believe born they say you're born again
[1:36:47] when you believe and the Bible says this
[1:36:50] another quote why it had to be Shepherd
[1:36:54] the Bible says that the Devils believe
[1:36:57] also now notice it's not that it's the
[1:37:02] experience it's a marriage experience
[1:37:06] amen well you say well I've lived a good
[1:37:09] life so did the
[1:37:12] apostles and they wasn't born again
[1:37:14] until they received the Holy Spirit and
[1:37:16] that wasn't there wasn't even converted
[1:37:18] until they had received the Holy Spirit
[1:37:20] remember the night of betrayal and I
[1:37:22] read that in the conversion a month ago
[1:37:25] sorry when thou art converted Peter
[1:37:28] strengthen the Brethren and Peter had
[1:37:30] preached the gospel cast out Devils
[1:37:33] healed the
[1:37:35] sick you know that's an amazing that's a
[1:37:38] that's the end of 64 that was his
[1:37:41] wedding message 641
[1:37:43] 12:21 W had to be Shepherds you know
[1:37:46] what that exact same scenario you know
[1:37:50] if you were in a convention this if you
[1:37:52] were in a it wasn't even a it make me
[1:37:56] but most people when we go to camp
[1:37:57] meeting in St
[1:37:59] John's and whoever's preaching I whoever
[1:38:02] it is and they have people come out and
[1:38:04] they're miraculously Miracles right in
[1:38:07] their presence there will be very few to
[1:38:09] zero people that will say they might not
[1:38:11] be converted yet the people that's
[1:38:14] praying for
[1:38:15] them and that would be exactly the same
[1:38:17] as
[1:38:18] Peter and your Prophet said he wasn't
[1:38:21] converted
[1:38:26] amen amen Matthew 25 talks about the
[1:38:30] virgins and we
[1:38:34] know I I want to just read Matthew I
[1:38:37] just want to read the end of that
[1:38:38] Matthew 25 and it starts at 1 to 12 but
[1:38:41] I just want to read verse 12 and and you
[1:38:45] think you know the whole story by memory
[1:38:47] I know but think them them were all
[1:38:51] believers but some were impregnated and
[1:38:53] some were
[1:38:54] not some had the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:57] Ghost and some did not cuz you say how
[1:39:00] can you say that because of the Bible
[1:39:03] you say how can how can you compare
[1:39:05] impregnated with the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:07] Ghost verse 12 he's answered and said
[1:39:09] unto them verily verily I say unto you I
[1:39:11] know you
[1:39:15] not amen and if you're not sure about
[1:39:18] that that's in
[1:39:21] marriage then go to Matthew 7
[1:39:25] 21-23 and not everyone that says L unto
[1:39:27] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:39:29] kingdom of heaven but them that doeth
[1:39:31] the will of the Father which is in
[1:39:32] heaven and Mary saith unto and many
[1:39:35] shall say unto me in that day Lord Lord
[1:39:36] haven't I prophesied and preached in thy
[1:39:38] name and cast out devils in my name and
[1:39:41] done many wondrous works in the message
[1:39:43] church I added that and and I will
[1:39:46] profess unto
[1:39:48] them marriage again I never knew
[1:39:51] you only in a
[1:39:54] marriage would Christ know you in that
[1:39:58] way now be and you say how can you say
[1:40:01] that because he's omnipotent he's all
[1:40:03] knowing so for God to say I don't know
[1:40:06] you it's to make him a liar but it's a
[1:40:08] different no he didn't know them as
[1:40:12] wife now there's two scriptures where he
[1:40:16] says and the foolish versions he said I
[1:40:18] never knew you you don't think God knew
[1:40:20] the 10 foolish versions well let me let
[1:40:23] me just rephrase it like this if God
[1:40:25] didn't know the 10 frish versions he
[1:40:26] ain't worth
[1:40:30] worshiping cuz he's not
[1:40:32] omnipotent of course he didn't he knew
[1:40:34] them but he didn't know them as
[1:40:37] wife and then he says the same thing in
[1:40:40] Matthew
[1:40:41] 7:23 he said depart from me I don't even
[1:40:44] know you he knew them but he didn't know
[1:40:47] them as
[1:40:48] wife oh God that's amazing amen
[1:40:55] John 17 I'm just I'm sorry this is this
[1:40:58] so good amen I just want to finish this
[1:41:00] and we'll go to something different when
[1:41:02] I come back John 17
[1:41:06] 21-23 that they may all be one as as
[1:41:10] thou thy father art in me and I in thee
[1:41:14] and they also may be one in us and the
[1:41:17] world may believe that thou has sent me
[1:41:19] and the glory which thou gavest me I
[1:41:22] have given them
[1:41:23] and they may be one even as we are one i
[1:41:28] in them and thou in me and they may be
[1:41:30] made perfect and one that this only
[1:41:34] happens in marriage not you you can't
[1:41:37] even comply this to a son in an
[1:41:40] adoption and the and that the world may
[1:41:43] know that thou has sent me that thou
[1:41:46] thou has loved them as thou H has loved
[1:41:49] me in marriage husband and wife
[1:42:01] amen Matthew 19 we're just honestly
[1:42:03] we're wrapping this up Matthew 194 and 6
[1:42:05] and he answered and said unto them have
[1:42:07] you not read that it was made them in
[1:42:09] the beginning made them male and female
[1:42:11] and he said unto them for this cause a
[1:42:13] man shall leave his mother and father
[1:42:14] and cleave to his wife and they twain
[1:42:17] shall be one flesh and therefore it
[1:42:19] shall be no more
[1:42:21] Twain but one flesh and therefore what
[1:42:25] God has put together let no man put a
[1:42:26] center now that's normally used in a
[1:42:28] marriage ceremony physically but if
[1:42:31] you're just in a courtship you're still
[1:42:35] to so if you're in a courtship with God
[1:42:38] you're not converted yet and you're
[1:42:41] definitely not going in
[1:42:43] Rapture because you're still
[1:42:45] Twain
[1:42:47] amen hallelujah
[1:42:58] amen just a couple more and we're going
[1:43:01] to close here here the prophet's talking
[1:43:04] about his love to
[1:43:07] Christ and he said if he sends me to
[1:43:11] hell and in Hell there is such a thing
[1:43:15] as
[1:43:16] love then I'll still love
[1:43:19] Christ because it's my part of my life
[1:43:22] and and it's become me and I can't help
[1:43:25] it cuz there's something in there that
[1:43:28] makes me love him that's in a commitment
[1:43:32] a marriage even it goes bad goes really
[1:43:35] bad for richer or poor sickness and in
[1:43:38] health no matter how bad it gets he said
[1:43:42] here and this will be my last quote and
[1:43:44] we'll stand on this one maybe you can
[1:43:45] come honey and Satan came to the Prophet
[1:43:48] this is when he lost all his family
[1:43:50] members and now he said will you serve
[1:43:52] Christ
[1:43:53] and he said now what would you think
[1:43:55] about him he said your daddy died about
[1:43:58] two weeks ago in your arms a doctor
[1:44:01] killed him with an overdose of
[1:44:04] medication said your brother less than a
[1:44:07] month ago was killed up there on the
[1:44:10] road and you picked him up with blood
[1:44:12] all over his body running down and a
[1:44:15] drunk had run all over him and said now
[1:44:18] there lays your wife down there in the
[1:44:20] Mard and now you're taking your baby out
[1:44:23] of your
[1:44:24] arms and he
[1:44:27] said Satan said to brother Brown he said
[1:44:31] now you still love this
[1:44:36] God and brother Brown said though he
[1:44:39] slay me yet I love him and if he sends
[1:44:42] me to hell at the Judgment Day he still
[1:44:48] just and I love him
[1:44:51] anyhow let's
[1:44:53] stand amen you know those quotes at the
[1:44:58] end are a lot more than just a
[1:45:01] courtship if he sends me to
[1:45:05] how no matter how bad it
[1:45:08] gets I'm still
[1:45:10] his if he takes everything you
[1:45:14] got
[1:45:16] financially and physically will you
[1:45:19] still serve
[1:45:21] him how long will we be
[1:45:24] here amen we don't know for
[1:45:28] sure we know God will protect his bride
[1:45:32] and we know that we're not here for the
[1:45:36] tribulation but what will go on before
[1:45:38] that I want to give you a news
[1:45:43] briefing you can Google
[1:45:45] this brother Lauren has sent it to me
[1:45:48] the bank Act is already set in Canada
[1:45:53] that June 25 next year the banks will
[1:45:57] stop
[1:45:59] operating that's in your
[1:46:02] country in Canada how will that affect
[1:46:05] your Christian
[1:46:11] walk
[1:46:19] amen we know that when they take paper
[1:46:22] off the
[1:46:24] market that they're going to be coming
[1:46:26] to tattoo you that'll be the chip how
[1:46:30] will that affect your walk with
[1:46:32] Christ see if it things get
[1:46:35] tough will that cons will that change
[1:46:37] your relationship if it changes your
[1:46:39] relationship you're not married
[1:46:42] yet if it changes you once back in your
[1:46:45] love for Christ then you're not adopted
[1:46:51] yet cuz you got something else ahead of
[1:46:54] your husband
[1:46:57] Jehovah wow God help us man those are
[1:47:01] solemn things to think about this world
[1:47:03] is falling apart completely it's already

[1:47:24] end could be here for 50 years but we're
[1:47:27] still at the
[1:47:30] end we know he'll come
[1:47:33] back he says to watch Israel can there
[1:47:35] get any more Wars around Israel can can
[1:47:39] any more things happen around Israel
[1:47:40] with just out

[1:47:50] know this week the uh the army of Putin
[1:47:53] told him to use nuclear weapons on
[1:47:56] Ukraine because they had invaded Russia
[1:47:58] this week this week brother Bown said
[1:48:01] you wouldn't be here for
[1:48:03] that never since the history of Hitler
[1:48:06] has any country ever went into Russia's
[1:48:09] territory I know you don't think it's
[1:48:11] going to happen because you just always
[1:48:12] oh well bless God well like it'll happen
[1:48:13] tomorrow it will never happen in my
[1:48:15] lifetime it'll happen in my kids's
[1:48:17] lifetime
[1:48:19] really
[1:48:21] maybe Biden
[1:48:23] the Reagan air carrier over with I don't
[1:48:28] hold me but a lot of air Jets to protect
[1:48:31] Israel because Ukraine was going to send
[1:48:34] missiles into Israel and when Ukraine
[1:48:36] said that they went to Russia to back
[1:48:39] them up now that that sound Russia to
[1:48:42] pull Russia into Israel Ukraine wanted
[1:48:46] or I'm saying that not Ukraine sorry
[1:48:48] Iran sorry forgive me Iran had went to
[1:48:52] Russia that if the states retaliated
[1:48:54] that Russia would back them up bring
[1:48:57] them right down to this area that we
[1:48:59] don't even believe we're going to be
[1:49:00] here to see happen there's not a lot
[1:49:03] more can happen without it actually
[1:49:06] happening
[1:49:08] amen are we

[1:49:14] to
[1:49:14] decide it's an individual walk but we're
[1:49:17] at the door amen we're for sure at the
[1:49:20] door God help us God help me God help me
[1:49:24] if you would change one
[1:49:26] thing then you're not
[1:49:28] adopted cuz our Prophet said if you know
[1:49:31] he's coming tomorrow which I would have
[1:49:33] a hard time doing
[1:49:35] this matter of fact I'm probably not
[1:49:38] there yet I'd still plant my potatoes
[1:49:40] knowing I'm not going to harvest
[1:49:42] them but that's how prepared you know

[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:33] h
[1:50:38] [Music]

[1:51:17] [Music]
[1:51:44] next
[1:51:47] Sunday be
[1:51:49] an I've asked for the
[1:51:53] come back
[1:52:03] onay wednes
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:29] no name like Jesus is
[1:52:32] sweet Jesus is the sweetest name I Jesus
[1:52:35] Jesus is the sweetest name I know sorry
[1:52:38] and also I want to I just just uh this
[1:52:40] is information maybe you can just take
[1:52:43] this for what it's worth if it's not
[1:52:44] worth nothing to you it's not we had a
[1:52:49] contact that sent us an email
[1:52:53] that said that the government in Canada
[1:52:56] was warning businesses to prepare for
[1:52:58] another lockdown
[1:53:01] pendemic and that there would be
[1:53:03] actually food
[1:53:05] shortages and fuel
[1:53:07] shortages now God knows my heart I am
[1:53:11] not trying to scare
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:14] you but that is
[1:53:17] 100%
[1:53:19] man-made intentional by the government
[1:53:24] it's a power setup for a one world
[1:53:27] government and if you're still believing
[1:53:29] your government you're deceived any
[1:53:32] government you're deceived I don't care
[1:53:35] what they
[1:53:36] are because this kingdom is
[1:53:41] Satan's and in one of those things they
[1:53:43] said there's a food
[1:53:45] shortage and I want to just tell you so
[1:53:48] you understand
[1:53:49] perfectly the prices on my crop has
[1:53:54] depleted over
[1:53:56] 30% because there is such an
[1:53:59] abundance of
[1:54:01] corn
[1:54:03] wheat and
[1:54:07] soybeans now you can decide if you want
[1:54:10] to believe brother Dale or you want to
[1:54:12] believe trud that's entirely up to you
[1:54:16] it's no sweat off my breath
[1:54:22] but there ain't no food
[1:54:24] chage and there's more oil in Canada and
[1:54:28] the states than we could burn in your
[1:54:30] grandkids
[1:54:32] generation so if you believe that
[1:54:37] lie I feel really sorry for
[1:54:40] you and monkey
[1:54:42] pox is a gay and lesbian
[1:54:48] disease Almost 100%
[1:54:52] or an incest
[1:54:56] disease and that's why they didn't bring
[1:54:58] it out sooner because they realize that
[1:55:00] everybody that got were about 95% gay
[1:55:05] lesbians but in countries where
[1:55:08] prostitution is off the charts that's
[1:55:12] how it
[1:55:16] spreads
[1:55:17] because people don't have one
[1:55:21] spouse amen
[1:55:25] but the anointing of Lucifer is on the
[1:55:29] world for a savior and it ain't Christ
[1:55:33] Jesus it's called the
[1:55:36] pope and
[1:55:38] ran that's why if we go into something
[1:55:41] like this it's as fake as the East is
[1:55:45] from the west and I'll tell you ahead of
[1:55:48] time brother Dale ain't getting the jack
[1:55:52] I am not afraid of monkey
[1:55:56] pox I don't visit those
[1:56:00] places amen now it's an individual thing
[1:56:04] but I'm just showing you now that notice
[1:56:06] came to us from an exp potition that had
[1:56:08] sat in our Parliament for 15 years and
[1:56:12] it's preparing businesses they're trying
[1:56:14] to bankrupt the
[1:56:16] wealthy it's the only way they can take
[1:56:20] over and there's no food CHS you want to
[1:56:23] come to brother Dale you can get a whole
[1:56:24] wagon load of corn that you could live
[1:56:27] for probably 10 years on making corn
[1:56:29] mesh and
[1:56:31] biscuits what Russia lives on or China
[1:56:34] lives on Africa men of the world their
[1:56:38] common base is
[1:56:40] maze it's a lie it's a deceptive lie
[1:56:43] amen God help us not to be we we need
[1:56:46] you know the world how's that scripture
[1:56:48] go the world fainteth or or is destroyed
[1:56:51] because of of lack of
[1:56:54] knowledge lack of knowledge you need to
[1:56:58] understand the
[1:56:59] truth will set you free amen God help us
[1:57:03] say sing the song and you're dismissed
