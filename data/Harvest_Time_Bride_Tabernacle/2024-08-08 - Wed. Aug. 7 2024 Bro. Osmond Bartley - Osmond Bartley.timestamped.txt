[1:18:11] down Philippians chapter 2 said
[1:18:14] something here let's look at what it
[1:18:17] says Philippians chapter
[1:18:19] two woo glory to God I just love the
[1:18:23] word of God Philippians chapter 2
[1:18:26] brother Paul is a great Apostle to the
[1:18:29] Gentile no one they said I magnify my
[1:18:32] office he said there are two gospels he
[1:18:34] said Peter get one and I get
[1:18:37] one he said Peter got one and I got one
[1:18:39] said Peter you go Peter God give you the
[1:18:42] gospel to the the circumcised but he
[1:18:44] give me those to the
[1:18:45] uncircumcised Oh Glory to God remember
[1:18:48] when they came and they shook their
[1:18:49] hands and said guys you go to the to the
[1:18:51] to to the Heathen these were people that
[1:18:54] had the Holy Ghost
[1:18:55] are you right is that right they're
[1:18:57] filled with the Holy Ghost coming from
[1:18:58] Pentecost but they were still calling
[1:18:59] those that they heard that God was
[1:19:01] manifesting among them the same way God
[1:19:04] manifesting among you they shook their
[1:19:06] hand and said God go with you you need
[1:19:07] to go to the
[1:19:08] Heathen even when they came from
[1:19:10] Pentecost had problem act chapter 15
[1:19:12] tell you that read the book it's
[1:19:15] there Hallelujah so God so the apostles
[1:19:19] said here is it Philippians chapter 2
[1:19:22] and the amen verse 6
[1:19:26] speaking of Jesus I'm going to read six
[1:19:29] before I read five he said Christ who
[1:19:31] being in the form of God thought it not
[1:19:35] robbery to be equal with God he was
[1:19:42] God but he made himself of no reputation
[1:19:46] who made him he made himself of no
[1:19:50] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:19:52] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:19:57] of men and being found in the fashion of
[1:20:00] a man he humbled
[1:20:02] himself Glory
[1:20:05] Hallelujah he humbled
[1:20:08] himself I think that's supposed to be
[1:20:10] the first Hallelujah manifestation of a
[1:20:14] born again child of God
[1:20:17] humility humble yourself became obedient
[1:20:21] unto death even the death of the Cross
[1:20:24] which the ultimate most disgraceful
[1:20:27] punishment that was during the time
[1:20:30] wherefore God had highly exalted
[1:20:35] him ah glory to God hallelujah he was
[1:20:39] exalted him he was exalted and given him
[1:20:43] a name above every name oh Hallelujah
[1:20:47] before you can be exalted let's do the
[1:20:50] formula right humility
[1:20:55] humility
[1:20:57] obedience you want the right result you
[1:20:59] need to apply the right
[1:21:01] formula is that right
[1:21:05] humility obedience and the result will
[1:21:08] be right you'll be exalted don't exalt
[1:21:12] yourself Hallelujah we know nothing is
[1:21:15] that right chames it's all about God I
[1:21:18] know nothing I never try to project my
[1:21:22] own knowledge I hate that I actually I
[1:21:25] even hate who I
[1:21:26] was I hate who I was until Christ came
[1:21:30] in my life I'm learning to love people
[1:21:34] more when Christ is in you you love
[1:21:37] people hallelujah it's about love it's
[1:21:41] not about me standing up here trying to
[1:21:42] project my
[1:21:45] knowledge when I understood my purpose I
[1:21:49] spend my time in the
[1:21:52] Bible so I don't know it because I study
[1:21:56] it the Holy Spirit revealing it to me to
[1:21:59] us so what I'm saying to you right now

[1:22:25] something you that oh I fabricated and
[1:22:27] bring it to you it's right here in the
[1:22:29] Bible it's right here in the
[1:22:33] Bible Oh Glory to God hallelujah so he
[1:22:37] was exalted after he humed himself and
[1:22:40] became obedient to his
[1:22:46] purpose Revelation chapter 10 so you

[1:24:55] things on earth he saw things in heaven
[1:24:56] saw things on earth that was it all
[1:24:59] right now when you understand Revelation
[1:25:01] even though you see Revelation chapter 1
[1:25:03] revelation 22 all things happen here
[1:25:05] does not happen
[1:25:06] concurrently Revelation chapter 10 you
[1:25:09] could have placed it in Revelation
[1:25:10] chapter
[1:25:13] 5 is that right Revelation 11 you could
[1:25:16] have dropped that right in Revelation
[1:25:18] chapter
[1:25:19] 7 amen glory to God so here John show
[1:25:23] him again this is powerful and I saw a
[1:25:26] mighty
[1:25:28] Angel any dispensation that God wishes
[1:25:32] to represent himself as a mighty Angel
[1:25:35] it means that that's a season you ought
[1:25:38] to
[1:25:40] wrestle is a wrestling season for
[1:25:45] you amen
[1:25:48] Jacob now this is not an anointing from
[1:25:51] a rock that Jacob Anointed The Rock
[1:25:53] because he felt an anointing he said
[1:25:55] this is the house of God when he was
[1:25:57] running away as a refu as a refugee
[1:26:00] right he was running away anointing hit
[1:26:02] him one night and he got a glory and he
[1:26:04] saw the ladder and when he woke up the
[1:26:06] next morning he said oh my God the
[1:26:07] anointing was so great this is the house
[1:26:09] of God he Anointed The Rock and called
[1:26:10] the place beel coming back he saw the
[1:26:13] anoint the anointing was still there he
[1:26:15] called The Place El
[1:26:16] betel but then coming back what met
[1:26:22] him in all
