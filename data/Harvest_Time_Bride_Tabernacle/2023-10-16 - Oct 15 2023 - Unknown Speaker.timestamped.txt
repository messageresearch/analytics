[21:05] Christ Hallelujah we bless your name
[21:09] amen amen you may have your seats this
[21:11] morning I want to preach on the current
[21:13] events and what time is it and talk
[21:15] about some about what's happening in
[21:17] Israel and different things and we want
[21:19] to use you know our Prophet taught us
[21:21] that the natural always types the
[21:23] spiritual and you know it's very easy
[21:25] for us to see the sliver that's in our
[21:27] neighbor eye but sometimes we got a
[21:29] whole Barn beam in our own eye and we
[21:32] can't see that because it's in my eye
[21:34] and that goes for me too the ministers
[21:36] or or nobody's exempt to that um we all
[21:41] have a a back a backyard let's put it
[21:44] that way amen ministers do too but you
[21:47] know there was somebody that tried to
[21:49] curse the hinder side of Israel and God
[21:51] turned his curses the blessings amen and
[21:54] we just see how how because of us being
[21:57] here for a period of time spiritually
[21:59] and physically people Everything grows
[22:03] common and and we tend to let down the
[22:05] bars and that's why the goats get in and
[22:07] I want to compare this to Israel uh
[22:10] first you know knowing that they were
[22:11] God's nation and you know and then we
[22:13] were grafted in the bride of Christ and
[22:16] and it's just an amazing thing but I
[22:18] want to show you some uh updates and
[22:21] things that the prophet said about it
[22:23] you know when when Israel was attacked
[22:26] physically they had let down their
[22:29] bars you know and and and you know we're
[22:32] not promoting death of any
[22:34] time
[22:36] amen but but God has you know God's in
[22:39] control we know that and you know when
[22:42] when the the those people those
[22:43] murderers terrorist came in that most of
[22:46] the people that were killed L the area
[22:49] they attacked was in the dance most of
[22:52] you probably heard that yeah yeah amen
[22:56] yeah that dance was worshiping Bo
[23:01] buddh I have pictures of St
[23:07] here amen Israel every time God Israel
[23:11] forgot about God God had to chastise
[23:13] them and so will it be spiritually
[23:15] speaking when when you know if if we're
[23:17] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're
[23:19] going to it'll just be our second nature
[23:22] because it's not even our nature it's
[23:23] Christ's nature and and Christ is the
[23:25] word and so we'll line up with the whole
[23:27] word
[23:29] amen you can't you can't you can't
[23:31] testify of something that you aren't and
[23:34] it'll show by your by your
[23:37] life with the word amen what did John
[23:41] 539 just lay a scripture thing you can
[23:44] pop this up John 5:39 it says search the
[23:48] scriptures for in Ye Ye think you have
[23:51] eternal
[23:52] life and they are they which
[23:55] testify against
[23:58] me
[24:01] yeah
[24:03] me and maybe you yeah yeah and the only
[24:07] way those scriptures can testify against
[24:09] you is if you were outside of some of
[24:11] the
[24:12] [Music]
[24:13] scriptures amen God help us you know and
[24:17] and and you know you just see these
[24:19] things and things that our Prophet said
[24:21] and it just how it's beautiful dve Tales
[24:23] you know the the the we're living in the
[24:25] age where where the anointing on the
[24:28] bride of Christ the word is in the bride
[24:30] of Christ you have thus sayith the Lord
[24:33] you aren't you anymore it's Christ mean
[24:36] it's not you saying this shall be it's
[24:38] Christ saying this shall be you have the
[24:41] right to signature on the bank account
[24:44] amen we don't have all these promises
[24:46] tonight to not have the know how to make
[24:48] a door to
[24:50] CH
[24:52] amen but we're to a time where Christ is
[24:54] coming for a mature bride and we have to
[24:57] be able to take the
[24:59] TRU and the truth will set you
[25:02] free that's right that's right
[25:05] Hallelujah God help
[25:07] us that was a budoo music festival yeah
[25:12] and a spiritual dance a worship now you
[25:15] know see how
[25:17] God God won't be mocked no there'll be
[25:21] many surprises
[25:23] amen many surprises if any of you doubt
[25:26] that I actually have the video of the
[25:28] dance if you want to see what it was
[25:29] like it would be like a rock concert
[25:32] amen and we know that not all Israel are
[25:34] Israel and we know the bride of Christ
[25:35] will be parts of the Bride there and we
[25:37] know the 144,000 is there but we want to
[25:39] look into different things here and I I
[25:43] just want to lay a foundation and and
[25:45] some scriptures I just got to
[25:49] uh look into some things that you know I
[25:53] I it fears me even myself that that you
[25:56] know the Bible says that he's coming for
[25:58] those that are watching for and he'll
[26:00] come like a thief in the night and and
[26:03] you would we don't know when and if we
[26:05] let down our guides and we're unprepared
[26:07] he's going to find us
[26:08] asleep now I know the predestinated
[26:11] bride can't be lost but the predestin
[26:14] bride will be watching for them yeah
[26:16] that's right Hallelujah that's right and
[26:18] let's just look into some scriptures you
[26:19] know the prophet mentioned in the gospel
[26:21] about the Fig Tree and we we mentioned
[26:24] all this and he and he talks about
[26:25] current events before this is men in
[26:28] Matthew Mark and Luke and I want to look
[26:29] in all three of them we got time cuz
[26:32] Luke is really special to me in the back
[26:35] part of this but I'm not you know so if
[26:37] you look at the beginning of these
[26:38] chapters it talks about all the wars and
[26:40] rumors of wars and and you know all the
[26:43] separation and you know not one stone be
[26:45] left upon a stone because Tomac was
[26:47] built with gold between the stones and
[26:49] and you know the the disciples asked
[26:51] Jesus once of these times be and many of
[26:53] those things have already taking
[26:55] place and then so there's many like high
[26:58] the top and we're just going jump and
[26:59] then he said but then you'll see the Fig
[27:01] Tree and when it begins to blo
[27:07] yeah that's where it should catch our
[27:09] attention am man let's go to Matthew 24
[27:12] and we'll start at 32 and and we're
[27:14] going to read uh we're going to skip
[27:16] around here a little bit just to save
[27:17] time but you know the prophet said
[27:20] multiple times that we've already
[27:23] received our last son you know there's
[27:26] much of the message that's waiting for
[27:27] God something to happen and then that
[27:29] will spark their faith and they'll be
[27:31] ready for Rapture sorry you're going to
[27:32] be lost do say it in the word of God
[27:36] feel bad for
[27:38] you but there ain't going to be nothing
[27:39] else to spark your faith to go to
[27:41] Rapture proph said you're seeing your
[27:44] matter of fact let me back up he said
[27:47] thus sayith the Lord you're seeing your
[27:52] last
[27:53] yeah help Jes and our Prophet said that
[27:57] if God really tells me something really
[28:00] really tells me
[28:02] something I'll say
[28:05] that's how in the world is there
[28:07] believer thinking something's going to
[28:09] happen and then they're going to become
[28:11] a
[28:13] Believer
[28:15] uhoh uhoh you're in trouble you better
[28:18] run
[28:21] for because you're
[28:23] deceived the Bible says that many of
[28:25] those people God give over to a strong
[28:27] illusion that's right that they would
[28:29] believe they were okay when they were
[28:31] not okay and they would believe a lie
[28:34] and be
[28:37] dead God have mercy on us those people
[28:41] believe they're
[28:43] okay matter of fact they actually
[28:45] believe they're real good sincere
[28:51] Believers God help us God help me m m m
[28:56] m
[29:16] trying to figure out my notes Here on my
[29:19] iPad that's Mass
[29:23] confusion help
[29:26] us
[29:30] Matthew 24 we're going to read in verse
[29:42] 32 give me just bear with me for one
[29:46] minute God knows what he's
[29:51] doing Matthew 24 22- 24 maybe we'll go
[29:56] further than that we just a except the
[29:59] days be short and there shall no flesh
[30:01] be saved but for the elect's sake those
[30:04] days should be short and then if any man
[30:06] shall say unto you Lo Christ
[30:09] is Christ is
[30:11] here or L I believe he's over
[30:15] here believe it not for there shall

[31:50] li a lie and don't do it and don't
[31:53] believe
[31:56] it and you see thousands and thousands
[31:59] of people that run here they're run
[32:03] they're looking for something and
[32:05] they're tripping on and they can't find
[32:07] it God help them that's like Israel they
[32:11] were run they we want to be like the
[32:13] neighbors we want to have a
[32:15] cre yeah the prophet came to Israel and
[32:18] said have I ever robbed you have I ever
[32:20] Li to you have I ever put you in
[32:24] armies have I ever oh no no no no no but
[32:28] but we're looking for something yeah
[32:31] looking
[32:32] for it's right in front of you called
[32:35] the prophet of
[32:37] God Amen Matthew
[32:41] 24 I got 30 2 and
[32:48] 34 now learn the parable of the Fig Tree
[32:51] when the branch is yet tender and
[32:53] putting forth his leaves you know that
[32:54] summer is night so likewise ye when you
[32:57] shall see all these things happen know
[32:59] that we are know that it is at it is
[33:04] near even at the door verily verily I
[33:06] say unto you that this generation shall
[33:09] not pass
[33:11] away until all these things be
[33:16] fulfilled now we know that God's word
[33:19] never
[33:20] lies but that Generation by the time
[33:23] frame in the Bible our clocks were off
[33:28] because we're operating on God's
[33:31] clock but a
[33:34] generation by the clock in the Bible
[33:36] that we've gotten in the letter form is
[33:37] already over right so how close are
[33:42] you you're seeing the world armies
[33:46] concentrate right where we won't be here
[33:49] when that war takes place yeah
[33:53] yeah that's right wow you think that's a
[33:56] mistake
[33:57] no no you know you know I could just so
[34:00] many things you know they had an
[34:02] emergency
[34:03] meeting this they had an emergency
[34:06] meeting with the
[34:08] UN which we know the UN is a joke and
[34:11] and it was just an army for the the uh
[34:15] Rome but they had an emergency meeting
[34:17] with the
[34:18] UN and and uh the Saints wanted the UN
[34:24] to give a strong condemnation to the
[34:26] attacking
[34:28] and Russia abstain so there can be no
[34:32] security action what's our
[34:35] prophecy what
[34:37] Russia Russia's at L and Russia will
[34:40] need
[34:42] fuel you know where I'm going what time
[34:45] is it what time is it at the time of War
[34:49] Russia will need
[34:52] fuel and Israel's at
[34:55] War see how things are coming together
[34:58] so quickly and yet we can fall
[35:01] asleep and
[35:04] wonder when we see the Fig Tre but let's
[35:07] just let's just look into the other
[35:09] scriptures let's read
[35:15] 36 but the day and the hour knowth no
[35:18] man know not even the angels in heaven
[35:20] but the father only and let's just jump
[35:22] to 41 just to save time in Matthew 24
[35:30] 42 sorry watch therefore for ye know not
[35:33] the hour or the day that the Lord cometh
[35:36] let's just jump ahead to uh to Mark 13
[35:42] just laying some foundations of the Fig
[35:44] Tre
[35:49] here barely very I say unto you this
[35:52] this generation shall not pass to all
[35:55] these things shall be
[36:03] done for heaven and Earth shall pass

[36:08] but of the day and the hour knoweth no
[36:10] man no not even the angels in heaven but
[36:12] the son neither the son but the father
[36:17] only amen and then we're going to go to

[36:37] us take heed to yourself lest at any
[36:39] times your heart be
[36:41] overcharged or S with Sur surtin I
[36:46] looked up that word I asked my wife so
[36:48] what's that word mean I don't know and
[36:51] then let me just explain here this is
[36:53] God talking in the gospels and this word
[36:55] serpentin means
[36:57] it means exactly where every one of us
[36:59] are living It's Easy Living it says it's
[37:02] an overabundance of
[37:06] Supply it's access exess like a huge
[37:11] amount
[37:13] amen it's it it's disgust caused by
[37:18] access of drinking or
[37:20] food now here's God telling us he said
[37:23] don't be don't let your hearts come at
[37:26] this time be overcharged with access and
[37:28] drunkenness and the cares of of this
[37:31] life so that the day will come upon you

[37:57] whole earth watch you therefore and pray
[38:00] always that ye may be accounted worthy
[38:03] and accepted of all these things that
[38:06] shall come to pass and stand therefore
[38:10] for the son of
[38:11] man God help us that in this hour you
[38:14] know God put everything before us to
[38:17] show us what time it is the fig tree has
[38:19] been there for a
[38:21] generation and and we we're living our
[38:24] life I'm living my life
[38:27] sometimes much of the
[38:31] times
[38:33] like it's never going to happen in my
[38:37] day
[38:40] yeah let me just tell you what the
[38:42] greatest events are going to happen in
[38:45] your day let's just look at Israel and
[38:47] see that let let's lay set a foundation
[38:50] of what's going on you know all the wars
[38:52] that have happened in Israel and how the
[38:54] Arab Nations all attacked Israel when
[38:57] they become a
[38:58] nation you know whenever you know in the
[39:00] 40s amen and they had the 1948 war and
[39:05] Israel
[39:06] won and they had the
[39:08] 19676 day war and Israel won and every
[39:13] time Israel won the
[39:16] war Israel asked for
[39:19] peace that I would like to be your
[39:24] friend but they couldn't
[39:28] you say how could they not but they were
[39:30] refused because God hardened their
[39:32] hearts now everything that's happened in
[39:34] Israel is happened in Joshua 11 and I
[39:38] would hugely encourage you when you go
[39:40] home read the whole chapter of Joshua 11
[39:44] but let's look at Joshua
[39:47] 11:20 and it'll show you what's
[39:49] happening and the same thing now think
[39:51] spiritual with me don't just think
[39:54] natural think spiritual
[39:57] for it was the
[40:01] Lord that's
[40:03] that's that's the top we can't go no
[40:06] higher than that yeah it was the Lord
[40:08] the Harden their hearts that they should
[40:11] come against Israel in battle don't
[40:13] think spiritually don't think of the
[40:15] bride of Christ the Bible says that if
[40:18] you were of the world the world would
[40:19] love you but when you're not of the
[40:21] world they hate you because you're not
[40:23] of them that's right so so you should
[40:25] not have nobody in the bride hating
[40:28] me that's right yeah that that's kind of
[40:32] the math I learned in high
[40:34] school or then they wouldn't be in the
[40:37] bride it was the Lord that hardened
[40:39] their hearts that they should come
[40:40] against Israel in battle that he might
[40:43] have no
[40:44] favor of the world but that he might
[40:48] mightily oh this should humble
[40:51] you like Jared
[40:54] said destroy them
[40:57] there's going to be a
[41:00] massacre a
[41:02] massacre and I'm going to tell you
[41:04] something what'll
[41:06] happen when the massacre happens the
[41:09] Bible says there'll be a massacre that's
[41:11] that's say the Lord of God word to
[41:14] God the world will turn against
[41:18] Israel and this
[41:25] prop
[41:27] when they see the M do you know you want
[41:30] me to tell you something Biden he's a
[41:33] joker already told Israel make sure you
[41:36] don't do war
[41:42] cries just almost turnning if you got
[41:46] the Holy Ghost you should have some
[41:50] discernment turning
[41:53] it I'm not so sure that carrier be there
[41:56] if the Congress wasn't controlled by a
[41:59] different
[42:00] party as the Lord ha commanded Moses now
[42:04] you let's look into this when Joshua you
[42:07] know that you know I love these
[42:08] scriptures because Moses was God to
[42:11] Pharaoh but when Moses died God was done
[42:14] without
[42:15] wrench man we're past the time of
[42:18] worshiping people you know we had
[42:19] beautiful fellowship at Sharon and
[42:21] brother Carson's and oh if you ever go
[42:23] to sister Sharon she's going to
[42:27] oh you don't go on a diet or you come
[42:30] hungry or something you don't leave
[42:31] hungry that's for sure it was just
[42:33] amazing but we had a wonderful time and
[42:36] they were showing how Wayne Lawson was
[42:38] mentioned we moved Beyond The Prophet
[42:41] The Prophet is Dead period he's
[42:45] completely de I have quot dozens of
[42:48] quotes where the Prophet said my name
[42:50] should never be mentioned he says never
[42:52] look at the messenger look at the
[42:54] message don't look at a F Pastor don't
[42:57] look at a good pastor look at the
[42:59] message that's coming forth watch what
[43:01] they say don't look at the delivery and
[43:04] the gift and how if he's got a $100
[43:07] hairo and if they got a Roman cathol
[43:11] Church God can care less about that it's
[43:14] what he's saying amen what's the word of
[43:17] God we got the spirit has moved into the
[43:20] prophet is being fulfilled in our lives
[43:23] and we're watching it and we're falling
[43:26] with you a Wonder Foredom
[43:29] fall the greatest event that's ever
[43:31] going to take place in the history of
[43:33] all of God's predestinated plan it's
[43:36] going to happen in your day you should
[43:38] lose your
[43:40] mind
[43:42] hallah Hallelujah and so see God ain't
[43:46] stuck on veger skin you know he had no
[43:48] problem getting rid of the old
[43:49] Tabernacle in the wilderness of the Old
[43:51] Testament when the perfect sacrifice
[43:53] Christ came and he run that Veil from
[43:55] Top the bottom didn't have nothing to do
[43:57] with the kings of the earth they were
[44:00] ton Potter of
[44:02] God he's Jehovah he's the provider he's
[44:07] everything it's all about Jehovah it's
[44:10] not about
[44:13] amen
[44:16] hallelujah we love worshiping
[44:20] people people worship the prophet they
[44:23] worship the best preacher they worship
[44:27] this they worship the building
[44:31] Hall that's right it could burn tonight
[44:35] sir and Earth will pass away but my word
[44:38] my word it'll never pass away his word
[44:42] is never going to burn up it's inside me
[44:44] you can burn me up but it's still
[44:47] myy I am Jesus
[44:51] Hallelujah and so Joshua come on the
[44:53] scene and he just s SP I've said that
[44:56] multiple times your brother's here I
[44:59] have tremendous confidence and I can be
[45:01] in a car accident on the way home don't
[45:03] even cry for me don't have a funeral
[45:05] just cook me and save all the money and
[45:07] send it to missions and what do you
[45:09] Brothers stand up here and start
[45:11] preaching
[45:12] again you say why it won't be
[45:15] you just get out of the way just shut up
[45:19] and get out of the way and let Christ
[45:21] come in amen thank
[45:24] you should be out to teach and handle
[45:27] the
[45:29] word hallelujah and so here we see
[45:32] Joshua God L this his attention from
[45:35] Moses to Joshua praise God he don't
[45:38] worship flesh
[45:39] [Music]
[45:41] hallelujah thank you
[45:44] Jesus Joshua was 10 times the warrior
[45:47] than Moses ever dreamed about being and
[45:50] you know Joshua we all think of Moses
[45:53] and every kid in the public school would
[45:55] know Moses name and all this but it was
[45:58] Joshua that conquered the land it was
[46:00] Joshua that had the commission from
[46:03] Christ and to your inheritage you have
[46:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have
[46:08] the baptism that's better than Moses
[46:11] message I
[46:13] AMC I don't want to live in The
[46:15] Prophet's day I want to live where the
[46:17] unfolding of the Revelation is
[46:20] completely
[46:23] unfolded Hallelujah a prophet I'm
[46:26] heading the top of the mountain piece
[46:27] and the young F ministry will come and
[46:29] open all the revelations up yesus 38
[46:33] says I do nothing except I reveal the
[46:35] secrets to my prophets but then the
[46:37] secrets unfolded and unfolded and
[46:40] unfolded and the Revelation expanded and
[46:42] expanded and you say how can that be
[46:44] because it's
[46:46] God you can't put God in just one little
[46:49] box from 1945 to 1965 he won't fit in
[46:53] that box no no no w CU there sub boxes
[46:57] bigger I'm still
[46:59] here
[47:02] hallelujah but even when God changed to
[47:04] Joshua as I was with Moses so I'll be in
[47:08] the bright praise God
[47:12] hallelujah hallelu thank you Lord Jesus
[47:16] blessed be your name but when joshu was
[47:18] here on Earth the type of the N there
[47:20] was three
[47:22] cities that
[47:24] Joshua did not come
[47:27] first did anybody know that I didn't
[47:31] either until I
[47:32] studied you know the Bible told God told
[47:35] Joshua I said wherever your foot
[47:40] goes
[47:42] George I think it' be good to have a
[47:44] good walk in
[47:45] life to go into all the world preach the
[47:48] gospel that's the only commission only
[47:49] commission it's not build churches it's
[47:52] not side churches it's not put on Church
[47:54] go just go
[47:56] just go don't take no money you don't
[47:58] need no money don't even take an extra
[48:00] pair of shoes I'll make shoes they'll
[48:02] last in the wilderness 40 years just
[48:03] just go just go just go don't build
[48:08] hospitals don't just
[48:11] go Hallelujah and Joshua went and he did
[48:15] a great work and I'm not beating up
[48:17] Joshua but there was three cities that
[48:20] somehow they could have put him in a
[48:21] wheelchair and put his feet down and
[48:23] just step them and give them a little
[48:24] push I tell my kids I'm getting old and
[48:27] they think I'm kiding them but I know
[48:29] I'm getting old I'm getting really old
[48:31] my leg follow me sometimes I'm
[48:34] F and there was three cities Josh what
[48:37] in the
[48:38] T and you're all looking at me like
[48:40] Brother
[48:41] D that's what the Bible
[48:44] says Joshua
[48:49] 11:22 I feel like you better pull it up
[48:51] because if you don't believe me my voice
[48:53] you maybe need to see it
[48:56] and we're still dealing with
[48:59] this
[49:01] today now three of two of these three
[49:04] cities are
[49:05] abandoned one was the POR
[49:08] City

[50:21] all God had give me and why did I want
[50:23] to have a more spiritual deep infinite
[50:25] Rel relationship with God you know I'm
[50:27] satisfied with the Revelation that the
[50:29] prophet brought
[50:34] and uh
[50:40] oh
[50:47] wow I'm going to say oh here soon
[50:49] because there's a scripture I'm missing
[50:52] but in that same
[50:54] chapter
[51:00] maybe one of you can find it in after
[51:02] 22 it says that God would come against
[51:06] them and utterly destroy them oh
[51:08] actually was 20 the one I read already
[51:11] I'm
[51:11] sorry see
[51:14] Israel will liberate
[51:19] God it's God work
[51:22] said and I'll tell you right now
[51:26] when it hits the
[51:28] screens it won't be
[51:32] 30 yeah and that'll build a
[51:36] hatred yeah yes sir uhuh just say uhhuh
[51:41] s for Israel now we know the prophet
[51:44] said this he said you know I've always
[51:46] had a
[51:48] feeling for the Jewish people he said
[51:51] I've always felt and I you know he
[51:54] always had an awesome feeling for from
[51:55] the Jewish people he talked about the
[51:57] Gentiles taking the message to the
[51:58] Jewish people Jewish people will
[52:01] recognize that that's in' 62 and here's
[52:03] another quote he said the ceing of
[52:06] 144,000 of Israel he said now them Jews

[54:59] able to forgive
[55:00] you forgive the Arabs for killing our
[55:05] own
[55:06] sons that sounds
[55:09] good
[55:12] right but it'll be much harder

[55:29] son
[55:34] forced

[1:07:11] fuel but I'm not going to be here for
[1:07:14] that cuz I'm not looking for another
[1:07:18] sign here's another one in spiritual
[1:07:22] Amnesia 6 for he says now look I want to
[1:07:28] ask you something what if he does come
[1:07:31] tonight
[1:07:34] 64 oh say he isn't
[1:07:37] coming I don't know whether he is or not
[1:07:41] this is your last sign he said remember
[1:07:44] this I didn't know that had this again
[1:07:47] he says thus sayith the
[1:07:50] Lord our
[1:07:52] Prophet did you ever hear me say that
[1:07:56] but whatever it is
[1:07:59] true he said you've seen your last sign
[1:08:03] that's spiritual and you've seen your
[1:08:05] last
[1:08:06] sign anybody watching this need to hear
[1:08:09] this
[1:08:11] Pentecostal you've seen your last
[1:08:18] son you've seen your last sign
[1:08:21] Pentecostal don't get all mixed up now
[1:08:24] with that and what he promised Israel
[1:08:27] after the Rapture we were talking about
[1:08:29] that brother
[1:08:31] Christ some of all the great Miracles
[1:08:33] and signs and wonders and just speaking
[1:08:36] food on your table and all that thing

[1:08:40] God as long as sister Sharon's cooking
[1:08:42] it it'll be
[1:08:43] wonderful
[1:08:45] uh but I'm not looking for
[1:08:47] it because like the Bible said but I
[1:08:49] thought Elijah was going to
[1:08:52] come and Jesus said said yeah he has
[1:08:55] already
[1:08:58] come and you missed it he said don't get
[1:09:01] all mixed up now what he promised for
[1:09:03] Israel after the Rapture now that means
[1:09:04] I won't be here when I oh I'm going to
[1:09:07] miss all that cool stuff I don't have a
[1:09:10] problem with
[1:09:12] that that ain't for
[1:09:15] you you're done then now your now is
[1:09:20] your day and now is your sign and now is
[1:09:23] your time don't don't reject it don't do

[1:09:33] not be here next
[1:09:36] Sunday I I don't know but that's how
[1:09:39] you're supposed to live
[1:09:41] correct Jes I honestly don't know that
[1:09:44] we will arrive to but if we do we're
[1:09:47] going to have a good time in the Holy
[1:09:48] Spirit
[1:09:52] right that's how
[1:09:54] right yeah and you're de with me right
[1:09:56] now when the Bible says he'll come like
[1:09:58] a thief and you could read many more
[1:10:01] scriptures that I said about like the
[1:10:03] good Master he said he put off his com
[1:10:06] and so the servant slumbered and slept
[1:10:08] and beat up the M servants and all that
[1:10:10] and he came in a time when you didn't
[1:10:14] think he would go the Bible says you
[1:10:16] didn't
[1:10:20] expect and that goes for about
[1:10:25] two
[1:10:27] men amen God help
[1:10:29] us another one thus sayith the Lord
[1:10:32] third one thus sayth the Lord we're
[1:10:35] seeing our last
[1:10:37] sign what time are we living in what

[1:11:09] don't see God moving I don't see God
[1:11:12] moving brother I don't see God moving no
[1:11:15] it's because you're Stone
[1:11:18] blind
[1:11:20] Y and he gave you a strong delusion
[1:11:25] because you're a m believer he's going
[1:11:26] to leave you
