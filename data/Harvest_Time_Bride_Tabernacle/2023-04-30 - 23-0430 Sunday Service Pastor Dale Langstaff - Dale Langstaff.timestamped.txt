[25:56] amen and uh we just we had a I had a
[26:00] young brother you know and the body you
[26:03] know we're all in different stages and I
[26:05] had a young brother that was paying his
[26:07] ties
[26:09] and he came to me
[26:11] and he asked me he said where's the ties
[26:14] flow
[26:16] and I'm gonna I told that brother I said
[26:18] I'm going to answer some of those
[26:19] questions today
[26:20] I'm going to answer some of them
[26:23] right now
[26:24] man we'll Vicky we'll start with uh
[26:27] thing you know for this young brother
[26:29] and anyone else pastors paid ties
[26:32] also
[26:34] and Levites are to pay ties to Levites
[26:38] so pastors are Levites
[26:42] and I paid tithes too
[26:44] I pay my tithes the pastor Sunday
[26:47] Pastor Vincent and Pastor Leo
[26:51] I send them ties monthly
[26:53] amen I wish I had a picture of these
[26:56] brothers but I send your
[26:58] the charts
[27:01] amen because God's blessed us at home I
[27:05] don't need to make a living
[27:07] ministering I'm like Paul I make Nets
[27:12] man that's not on scriptural at all
[27:15] Amen brother Branham had a game morning
[27:17] job and worked for the electricity
[27:19] company
[27:20] and so at this time we can assist the
[27:23] bride around the world
[27:25] and I think it's neat for you to know
[27:28] what you're going to be a part of when
[27:30] you get to heaven
[27:32] amen here's a pastor that we met in
[27:34] Uganda he'd built a mud Church
[27:37] bamboo in my church
[27:40] and uh so he was shy of a roof there's a
[27:45] video there you can play it you can
[27:47] actually see the rain coming in
[27:49] now I have not physically been there you
[27:51] can see the rain raining inside the
[27:53] church
[27:54] and so I had Pastor Leo
[27:58] because I send money to Pastor Leo send
[28:00] this brother
[28:02] some of your money
[28:04] through his phone
[28:06] amen so we sent him enough for about
[28:09] five or six sheets of Steel
[28:12] to do this church I'm sorry it's so dark
[28:14] it's just I'm sending you what he sent
[28:16] me
[28:16] amen but there's one example
[28:20] of where your ties went in that past
[28:22] this is a different church this is a
[28:25] note reach this was a Pentecostal Church
[28:27] you might say or or at least not a
[28:30] message church at the time and uh that's
[28:34] one great blessing that um
[28:37] oh no
[28:40] that's one great blessing that they have
[28:41] there
[28:43] is uh
[28:47] just back another one or two
[28:50] further yeah okay
[28:53] um thank you
[28:55] is the people even in the denominational
[28:57] setting still have a strong pull for God
[29:01] and so Pastor Leo and Pastor Sunday was
[29:04] invited to this denominational Church
[29:07] the minister
[29:08] now can you imagine that happening here
[29:10] when the Baptist Church invites me to
[29:12] preach
[29:14] uh we'll be really close to going home
[29:16] amen and so they baptized 13 people you
[29:20] can go through this just slowly we got
[29:22] lots of time this morning this is the
[29:24] pastor
[29:24] to the to my left to your left and
[29:28] Pastor Leo there
[29:30] um okay we can go the next one
[29:33] this is Pastor Leo just arriving and
[29:35] he's showing us the church he's he's not
[29:38] trying to show himself he's just taking
[29:39] a selfie because there's probably nobody
[29:41] there he would give his phone to and so
[29:43] when after they preached there was you
[29:45] can take your time Vicky we got all day
[29:47] uh
[29:49] there were 13 people in that church
[29:52] wants to be baptized
[29:54] Jesus Christ you know
[29:57] they baptize people
[30:00] every single week
[30:02] Pastor Sandy and Leo we're in a this
[30:04] Outreach about type 13 Pastor Leo said
[30:07] I'm baptizing six this morning so far
[30:09] and Pastor Sunday was preaching another
[30:11] Outreach and on Saturday night I think
[30:13] he'd baptized two or three
[30:15] I said I said pastor Leo
[30:18] I would almost never baptize
[30:25] man amen who's rich and who's poor
[30:29] you can decide
[30:31] amen the Bible says lay up your
[30:33] Treasures where and so Pastor Leo told
[30:35] me this I'm just telling you what I was
[30:36] told you can read it in my WhatsApp he
[30:38] said it was during the rainy season
[30:40] he said it was pouring rain
[30:42] they're going to get baptized anyway
[30:44] Pastor Leo rented this truck with your
[30:46] money
[30:48] that we would send them he rented the
[30:50] truck so he could take the people in the
[30:51] pouring rain in the back to re-baptize
[30:53] like Nothing Stops
[30:56] nothing
[30:58] amen you can leave the video go this is
[31:01] just one person being baptized you can
[31:03] let it go through the video there was a
[31:05] video on the truck I believe Vicki maybe
[31:07] okay perfect yeah beautiful and then uh
[31:11] uh because it's raining season
[31:14] when they left Pastor Leo got hugely
[31:17] stuck
[31:19] and they don't have a tractor down the
[31:21] road at the neighbors
[31:24] they called the whole
[31:25] basically all the church and people
[31:27] around
[31:28] put as many people that could lean
[31:30] against the van
[31:31] and push the dope
[31:34] man Pastor Leo told me himself he said
[31:36] it was really god pushing it out because
[31:37] I was really stuck
[31:40] you can turn volume up we got volume
[31:49] we can only do this because you give
[31:53] you want to see where your ties goes for
[31:55] the young Brothers
[32:05] amen

[32:11] and and Pastor Leo's with them they do
[32:13] prayer they pray that's another picture

[32:21] oh this is another video that's good the
[32:24] sister they're praying with
[32:26] hugely
[32:28] presence of God there in the baptisms
[32:31] hugely the presence of God Amen actually
[32:34] Pastor Sunday I think it was just it was
[32:36] within the last month I showed you honey
[32:38] Pastor Sandy was baptizing and he he
[32:42] baptized he was there for pastor Leo
[32:46] and the pillar of fire came in the
[32:48] baptism and you can see it just looks
[32:50] like a cloud around the bright sunny day
[32:52] like they sent me like a half a dozen
[32:54] pictures I'll show them to you I don't
[32:56] have them here it literally was like a
[32:58] cloud
[32:59] right hun you see
[33:01] sunny sunny day and it just went through

[35:20] an alcohol problem but he was a Believer
[35:24] he was a Believer and Pastor Leo told me
[35:27] they said he will go to the bar
[35:29] and be drinking
[35:31] and he will be preaching at the same
[35:33] time he'll tell him the only real God is
[35:35] the god that my family has my wife
[35:38] but I'll take another beer
[35:41] and he's preaching I said God will save
[35:42] them
[35:43] that'll save him he's literally
[35:45] preaching from the bar but he's a drunk
[35:47] himself so sister Luanne they call it
[35:49] capital A lot of times people that are
[35:51] completely hopeless uh brother uh Andre
[35:54] Boutique did this a lot in Haiti people
[35:56] that are completely hopeless rather than
[35:58] just give them a fish today and then
[36:00] they need a fish tomorrow
[36:02] if you give them just a tiny bit of
[36:04] capital
[36:04] they can fish the rest of their life you
[36:06] buy them a boat and they go fishing or
[36:08] you buy him a fishing rod they go
[36:09] fishing and so uh this is where Leo got
[36:12] stuck this is his video but sister
[36:14] Luanne gave that uh
[36:16] sister a little Capital so she could
[36:18] build that little shed
[36:20] and sell food goods for her
[36:24] family mainly her daughters are younger
[36:27] amen this is actually building the shed
[36:32] this was from after when we were there
[36:35] and that's their family
[36:38] the the tall brother in the center or
[36:40] Sue Lord willing will be coming to be
[36:42] with us
[36:43] Amen brother Daniel
[36:46] that's her in the shed after it's built
[36:49] yeah
[36:51] just we can move on there okay this is a
[36:54] sister sister Ruth's done a lot of
[36:56] clothes I don't I don't think I have
[36:57] many clothes but this family got a bunch
[36:59] of baby clothes from from the baby
[37:01] clothes that were sent through and this
[37:02] is actually the family
[37:04] that is going to live in the second
[37:06] house on the property by the church as
[37:09] soon as it's finished Roofing that's her
[37:12] seeing his wife
[37:15] amen this is a brother Pastor that we
[37:18] met there and uh I I honestly really
[37:21] have not supported him
[37:24] as of yet but I would like to
[37:27] some in the future
[37:29] we did support a person that was sick in
[37:32] his church a little bit but just go back
[37:35] to the other one sorry but um he he is
[37:37] in a completely different part of Uganda
[37:40] East close to Kenya so he's a long ways
[37:42] from Pastor Leo I'm not sure how far
[37:44] that is but multiple hours and they're
[37:47] printing books in the native tongue
[37:51] which actually I think 80 percent of the
[37:53] people
[37:54] can read a huge percentage and even
[37:57] there's other brothers in the capital
[37:58] city that were doing that another
[38:00] brother talked to me actually it was my
[38:02] interpreter my interpreter and so I was
[38:05] with him a lot and can pray for him also
[38:08] he's it's just uh
[38:11] but there's different so this one in the
[38:14] capital city actually uh Cloverdale
[38:16] supports and they had kind of changed
[38:19] their support uh funds I'm just
[38:22] repeating what he said he said funds
[38:23] were kind of tight and they had changed
[38:25] from printing so many books in the
[38:27] native tongue
[38:28] to do in a different language I didn't
[38:31] necessarily follow that completely but
[38:33] this brother is close to Kenya and he
[38:37] wanted he actually used me on his
[38:38] Facebook he wanted me to be the half I
[38:40] said I don't I said no I said I I'll
[38:43] encourage you and support you and I mean
[38:46] and I'll
[38:47] and uh but this brother uh what's his
[38:49] name sorry
[38:51] boy
[38:52] Branham and so they're printing books in
[38:56] the native tongue amen and if we can in
[38:59] the future
[39:00] send money for the printing of these
[39:03] books I will and if I go back if I don't
[39:07] go myself I'd like to send brother Jim
[39:09] there to see
[39:11] it's always good to see it's always good
[39:13] to see and touch and no
[39:16] amen so Lord willing but he's a really
[39:20] good friend he probably is watching our
[39:21] service right now he watches service
[39:23] every Sunday
[39:24] brother Ian I brought another brother
[39:26] right in the church that was in the
[39:28] house that's asked me for the link this
[39:30] morning just literally When I Was Here
[39:32] different people will be watching I hope
[39:34] you got that on the TV screen Vicky the
[39:37] video perfect thank you uh for brother
[39:40] Jim and sister Linda we were able to
[39:42] visit them this actually this was our
[39:43] visiting week we went and seen uh you
[39:45] can go to the next picture we went
[39:46] seeing John Blackman
[39:48] and just remember him we went seen
[39:50] Stephen Kathy and we also gave them not
[39:54] gave them this is for everybody because
[39:57] everybody here has a different interests
[40:00] the church your ties or or offerings
[40:03] we gave
[40:05] the doctor that's teaching Steve how to
[40:08] eat
[40:09] we made the check right out to him
[40:12] he's from
[40:14] Congo
[40:15] where they're fighting Sudan sedan uh
[40:19] and he seriously is like an angel
[40:24] uh literally he's from Sudan but his
[40:28] whole he's a doctor
[40:30] but he takes uh
[40:33] people that can't eat orphans babies
[40:35] babies from the hospital two years old
[40:37] that and literally he was teaching Steve
[40:39] because of Steve's head injury and that
[40:42] he would teach Steve how to to cough and
[40:45] and not choke to death and and all this
[40:47] stuff and so every morning because of
[40:50] him every morning Steve instead of just
[40:52] straight ivy straight up which is very
[40:55] expensive by the way uh uh every morning
[40:58] Steve eats two waffles and a banana
[41:00] every morning amen and so we gave the
[41:03] doctor 200 in their house made right out
[41:07] to the doctor from the church on the
[41:09] church check amen so that's a mission
[41:12] field at home so your mission field
[41:14] might not be in Uganda
[41:16] then your mission Field's over and
[41:18] whoever it is Warwick hey man she's been
[41:22] here a few times and so we try to
[41:24] witness and we're trying to show them
[41:26] and just remember Steve I I just think
[41:29] it would be an amazing Miracle to see
[41:31] Steve they have to go to the bathroom
[41:33] alone and Eat Alone
[41:35] that would just be
[41:37] praise God this is just Whoa stop don't
[41:39] move this is a church when me and and
[41:42] sister Luanne
[41:44] and Amy went to I'm just this is a kind
[41:46] of old news this we we I think last year
[41:49] sent money for his parsonage next to the
[41:51] church but when me and Luanne and Amy
[41:53] were there it was a bamboo church it was
[41:55] a straw roof and a typhoon took it down
[41:59] and way way back when we were still in
[42:01] the house
[42:02] we sent money for this church and by
[42:05] God's grace we're able to build this as
[42:07] many years ago this is eight years ago
[42:09] and they had a camp meeting here
[42:12] and he sent me pictures and it just
[42:13] blessed my heart because I I didn't know
[42:15] if the pastor was somewhat uh
[42:18] alone you know like
[42:21] he don't I don't see him in all the uh
[42:25] you know reach outs uh
[42:27] but uh
[42:30] anyway uh
[42:31] uh yeah right there yeah one of them
[42:34] yeah anyway this is so let's go through
[42:36] that group of pictures there
[42:38] so this was a church that okay there's
[42:41] there's probably mostly ministers or
[42:43] Minister wives there or just different
[42:45] pictures and it kind of blessed my heart
[42:47] there was actually a large picture of of
[42:49] people but this is something that you
[42:51] used to be a part of or those that were
[42:53] with us eight nine years ago in the
[42:56] house there there's the camp meeting
[42:59] see when you get there and you're having
[43:01] and God will say hey there's a star for
[43:03] you and you say what are you talking
[43:04] about
[43:06] they were way back
[43:08] so I don't even remember
[43:10] but God remembers
[43:12] God remembers amen God remembers amen
[43:15] lay up your Treasures where moth and
[43:18] wrath don't corrupt and thieves don't
[43:20] break through and steal I'm going to ask
[43:21] sister Ruth to come give a testimony and
[43:24] we're going to leave that right there in
[43:25] that picture sister Ruth give it the
[43:27] testimony
[43:28] of this uh this year um what's the
[43:32] matter which one
[43:35] I mean unless you want to set up right
[43:37] yeah
[43:42] God bless you Saints
[43:45] so who you see up there that's brother
[43:47] Gideon and his wife sister Susan
[43:51] um they sister Susan just recently gave
[43:53] birth to triplets
[43:57] um after being told
[43:59] probably over 25 years ago that she
[44:02] couldn't have any more children we only
[44:04] had one child
[44:05] and so obviously that's a big miracle
[44:11] and uh about 10 or 11 years ago at my
[44:16] brother's wedding in Uganda
[44:18] my dad is the one who told me this
[44:20] brother Gideon was the one officiating
[44:23] my brothers Joseph you know him he was
[44:26] officiating his wedding and so he was
[44:29] introducing his wife
[44:31] and uh
[44:33] he said that we only have one daughter
[44:36] and then he made a statement almost like
[44:39] something that he never even thought
[44:41] about it just came out of his mouth he
[44:43] said and there's more coming
[44:46] and my Dad held on to that
[44:49] and so uh his wife blushed and went off
[44:53] the stage and you know like that was
[44:55] that so when I gave my dad the news that
[44:59] they've gotten triplets he was like oh
[45:01] my goodness like I remember his words at
[45:03] Joseph's wedding when he said this and
[45:05] this and uh so he texted brother Gideon
[45:09] who you know was not even recalling that
[45:12] and then when when he narrated the story
[45:15] to him then brother Gideon remembered
[45:17] what he said back then so we give God
[45:21] thanks for that
[45:22] so uh the the children are prematurely
[45:26] born I think they're about seven weeks
[45:28] premature and right now they're in
[45:31] hospital uh sister Susan was in hospital
[45:34] for most of her pregnancy and the bill
[45:37] is extremely extremely high uh they're
[45:42] required to pay around 1400 Canadian per
[45:46] day
[45:48] and the hospital is demanding
[45:50] a down payment of a minimum of roughly
[45:55] nine thousand dollars to attend to the
[45:58] babies
[45:59] uh the total bill up to date up to up
[46:03] until yesterday
[46:04] for the hospitalization and everything
[46:06] else up until that point is 80 83 000.
[46:11] dollars
[46:12] so I'm just trying to
[46:15] do yeah that's Canadian so I'm just
[46:18] trying to do what I can to fundraise and
[46:20] you know spread the word and see how
[46:24] how they can be assisted
[46:27] now brother Gideon doesn't want doesn't
[46:31] want this to be broadly publicized
[46:36] um so
[46:38] um just keep that in mind uh even I mean
[46:42] you may talk to your friends or other
[46:44] brothers or sisters you may know but uh
[46:48] they don't want anything like you know
[46:49] their pictures or their story going on
[46:52] Facebook you know circulating around so
[46:55] just keep that in mind and keep them in
[46:58] your prayers and we trust that you know
[47:01] this is a mountain that is not too hard
[47:03] for God to move and it's going to be a
[47:06] testimony I believe that that we will
[47:08] hear the good side of it
[47:11] in a few times to come so thank you
[47:21] was brother Bernard's pastor
[47:23] and I preached for him three years ago
[47:25] and and he's a wonderful brother and he
[47:29] can really preach he has a large Church
[47:32] and uh he preached the Saturday night at
[47:36] Pastor Leos and actually the curtains
[47:39] behind Pastor Leo's church
[47:42] came from him originally you know amen
[47:44] we gave him a portion and the rest was a
[47:47] gift amen but a wonderful person and you
[47:50] know maybe we can just pull up the
[47:51] scripture and uh maybe we'll just uh
[47:54] stand with this and first John that was
[47:58] all there actually there was another
[47:59] picture of the sister but that's fine
[48:01] First John 3 16 17-18 just to say this
[48:05] if anything is given tagged for that
[48:08] need 100 of the penny will be sent to
[48:12] them
[48:13] 100 percent and the church we will send
[48:16] money on Monday for the this need when
[48:21] we praise God that the babies are
[48:22] healthy and the mom's healthy and uh
[48:25] everybody's live but I believe I was I
[48:29] was I believe I was told it was 220
[48:31] million Uganda Shillings now I know what
[48:35] they make there an average person makes
[48:37] about a half a million a month and
[48:39] that's if they're employed
[48:42] so I mean it it's like
[48:44] if that was 83 000 over there Canadian
[48:47] that would be like 8 million here
[48:51] literally I mean it's just a
[48:53] non-believable mountain but you know God
[48:55] owns the cattle on a thousand hills
[48:57] and God has a a magnificent bride around
[49:00] the world and uh
[49:03] God knows where his his Help Cometh From
[49:06] amen and he's where he's placed it in
[49:09] his bride amen and uh this is this is no
[49:13] problem for God and think of the glory
[49:15] the God will get you know here's here's
[49:17] the brother spoke you know my wife knows
[49:19] something about that
[49:21] because I was we were talking this week
[49:23] and long before this man here's here's
[49:26] Pastor Gideon speaking that there was
[49:28] more coming you know when Joseph crossed
[49:31] the river
[49:33] it was at the brim
[49:35] it was at the top
[49:37] and the river never parted until they
[49:40] stepped in
[49:41] some things in your life you know what I
[49:43] read that quote a while ago it's about
[49:45] time that we start claiming what God's
[49:47] already given us
[49:48] and man just start speaking it it'll
[49:50] happen forget about the dope part you
[49:52] know amen
[49:54] it's God's will that couples have a
[49:56] family it's God's will that you know he
[49:59] said I know the thoughts I have for you
[50:01] it's not torture and persecution amen
[50:04] amen God help us amen God help us to
[50:07] just believe I mean this this is the the
[50:10] greatest Banker of all Jehovah God and
[50:12] man First John 3 16 17-18
[50:16] and we'll let you have your seats and
[50:18] we'll just carry on and uh just looking
[50:21] forward to uh next Sunday is Mother's
[50:23] Day just remember we we've seen brother
[50:25] Jim and sister Linda also this week amen
[50:28] so we were visiting this week and uh
[50:30] just remember Sister Linda of course and
[50:33] brother Jim's taking care of her and and
[50:35] just that God would have mercy on them
[50:37] amen them and and also Steve and Kathy
[50:42] different ones brother John just many
[50:44] people you know if you think you got if
[50:47] you think you're having it rough
[50:49] you need to travel or visit some people
[50:51] I mean it just uh
[50:53] we're very blessing man amen hereby
[50:57] perceive ye the love of God because he
[50:59] laid down his life for us
[51:01] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[51:04] the brethren
[51:05] [Music]
[51:06] but whosoever hats of the world's good
[51:09] and seeth his brother in need now you
[51:11] know first you have to have it but if
[51:13] you have it and you see your brother in
[51:14] need and you set up your bowels of
[51:16] compassion for him how dwelleth the love
[51:19] of God
[51:20] in him
[51:22] my little children let us not love in
[51:26] word neither in tongue but in deed and
[51:30] in truth Lord Jesus we ask you to just
[51:32] add the blessing to your word this
[51:34] morning bless your bride Lord Jesus as
[51:36] we as we Minister here this morning your
[51:39] what you've laid on our hearts and the
[51:41] words of truth Lord Jesus in a special
[51:44] way amen amen God bless you you may have
[51:47] your seats this morning
[51:49] hey man I just want to read another
[51:51] scripture Psalms 25 10.
[51:55] just carrying on our same thought I I uh
[51:58] I believe Beyond any shot of a doubt
[52:00] that we're moving on after today and uh
[52:03] I believe God's got something different
[52:05] for us for Mother's Day
[52:07] amen next week and just be talking uh
[52:12] moving in a different direction amen
[52:14] Psalms 25 10
[52:16] says all the paths of the Lord are mercy
[52:21] and Truth unto such his Covenant and the
[52:25] word covenant is God's laws
[52:28] so if you want God's mercy and truth you
[52:31] got to keep his lost
[52:34] or his Covenant
[52:35] and all these are his Covenant and his
[52:38] testimonies and we drop down to 14 and
[52:41] the secrets of the Lord is with them
[52:43] that fear Him
[52:45] and he will show his
[52:49] Covenant
[52:50] again amen God God has a peculiar people
[52:54] amen and and God's proud of his peculiar
[52:57] people just like a young brother or or
[53:00] or or or man a man betrothed to uh to a
[53:05] sister amen see it's it was God's pick
[53:09] and God's proud of his bride before the
[53:13] foundation of the world Amen
[53:15] and but but God expects things
[53:18] from us also amen we we've read the
[53:21] scripture many times all scriptures
[53:22] given for for correction and reproof and
[53:25] exhortation amen and God help us to look
[53:28] into these these different scriptures
[53:30] that we don't normally look into
[53:32] Philippians 4 6 and 7. and this is a
[53:36] scripture we're just going to touch on
[53:38] laying down peace be careful for nothing
[53:42] you know I was looking into the ministry
[53:45] and you know in the Scripture it shows
[53:46] muzzle knocked the ox that trampled the
[53:49] corn and all these things and and you
[53:51] know it was just bless me you know you
[53:54] know when when when the brother in the
[53:56] Bible invited Jesus to his house and the
[53:59] sister came and washed his feet you know
[54:01] he had invited Jesus for uh for uh uh he
[54:05] had invited Jesus because he liked them
[54:08] he had actually invited Jesus and this
[54:11] blessed my heart and it I'm just trying
[54:13] to show you what God what God's word's
[54:16] showing you is he said every time the
[54:19] other side does that
[54:20] every time the make-believer did like
[54:23] this brother did
[54:25] was the mock Jesus
[54:28] to Mark the troops amen and so if you're
[54:31] out in the travels of your life
[54:34] and you see somebody that
[54:36] mock you
[54:40] they're mocking God through you
[54:43] and see these people were directly
[54:44] mocked and got the mocking Jesus amen
[54:47] and making fun of the sister washing his
[54:50] feet and how much it costs and could
[54:51] have spent and and then in the same text
[54:54] and and all this I studied this week how
[54:56] the people came to Jesus asking them
[54:58] we're going to talk about taxes
[55:01] and saying you know should we paint see
[55:03] they were trying to trap Jesus
[55:07] they didn't really want to know the
[55:08] truth
[55:09] uh-huh
[55:11] and you'll see that in the ranks that
[55:14] you will be sometimes people will try to
[55:17] crop you
[55:19] you've all felt like you were going to
[55:22] be trapped and no matter what you said
[55:23] true or false
[55:25] you were still trapped and they did the
[55:27] same thing to your lord was to try to
[55:30] drop them but look at this spirit
[55:33] they're not one of us
[55:36] nobody in the spirit of Christ tries to
[55:39] trap Christ
[55:40] never never be careful for nothing and
[55:44] in everything you have prayer and
[55:45] supplication with Thanksgiving
[55:48] and let your requests be made known to
[55:50] God and the peace of God that passes all
[55:53] understanding I mean you'll never figure
[55:56] it out
[55:57] even if you go to university
[55:59] so keep your hearts and Minds
[56:02] through Christ Jesus that's Philippians
[56:04] 4 6 and 7. I always want to I just want
[56:07] to dwell on that for a second you know I
[56:10] in studying and and I reach out you know
[56:12] and you know I try to I mean of course
[56:16] we we're looking for God's will but as a
[56:19] minister you'll look out and look in the
[56:21] edges and God can bring it back to you
[56:23] know amen I have quotes right in front
[56:25] of me or read this week amen where where
[56:27] God always had a levite in the area God
[56:30] always had a witness in the area and God
[56:32] always gave it to the levite to give it
[56:35] to a sheep it's just I mean that's just
[56:37] the way it is if you can't understand
[56:38] that or you struggle with that ask God
[56:40] about it amen I don't mean that God
[56:42] can't give you the Holy Ghost and and
[56:44] you'll discern if that's you should know
[56:47] who labors among you amen but at some
[56:50] point at some point
[56:53] you should be at peace with who's labor
[56:55] and among you you shouldn't go through
[56:57] your whole life
[56:59] in turmoil no different you shouldn't go
[57:01] through your whole
[57:02] life in turmoil for anything else
[57:05] because you have to come to rest and
[57:07] peace amen that's that's what the Holy
[57:09] Ghost was given for
[57:11] it wasn't a law but it was rest and
[57:13] peace amen and so I seen this and this
[57:16] was a doctor and you know you know my
[57:19] feeling on this and I apologize in
[57:20] advance for anybody that's watching that
[57:22] that disagrees and that's all right
[57:25] but if Max was here I'd have to
[57:27] apologize to him this morning and the
[57:29] next time I see him I actually will
[57:30] apologize to him but I want to tell you
[57:33] something uh this was a medical doctor
[57:36] that was is not a believer
[57:39] and he was investigating all this stuff
[57:41] that's happened the last three years in
[57:43] our lives
[57:44] hugely
[57:46] and some of the stuff he told me and I'm
[57:48] I'm actually going to probably
[57:49] investigate it more and I will tell you
[57:51] more in the future but he he showed and
[57:55] proved how everything
[57:58] was the Catholic Church
[58:00] in Rome he said Rome has never lost
[58:03] power since Jesus was here
[58:07] no it was Roman Jesus was here and it's
[58:09] still wrong see it was a physical
[58:11] government then now it's just it's not a
[58:13] spiritual government I refuse to say
[58:15] that it's a it's a religious government
[58:19] that's better it's a covering government
[58:21] and this was unbelievable and he showed
[58:24] me things that that I will have to
[58:26] apologize to the max for
[58:27] but he said you know that Dr felchi
[58:31] he was showing how the Jesuits control
[58:33] the world
[58:35] the Catholic priest
[58:36] said you know Dr fauci went to a Jesuit
[58:39] university
[58:41] do not know that
[58:42] President Biden went to exactly the same
[58:45] Jesuit college
[58:49] no
[58:51] I'm gonna have to duck down it I hope
[58:53] you ain't got no eggs you know that
[58:54] President X Trump went through the exact
[58:57] same Jesuit college
[59:02] and Juno
[59:04] that I would say In the Flesh you know
[59:06] we have to be so careful because we have
[59:07] to come above us and and I I'm in favor
[59:10] of
[59:11] doing what's best for us when we're
[59:13] still here
[59:15] but don't look for a better place to
[59:17] live
[59:18] because the conservative leader that's
[59:20] running for our country that will
[59:22] probably win is a member
[59:24] a hundred percent thank you
[59:27] of the world economic Forum it probably
[59:29] went to the same Jesuit school and this
[59:31] guy showed how that Biden in his
[59:34] campaign has only got 50 percent of the
[59:36] Americans and so the Romans are working
[59:38] through Trump to come with a different
[59:40] angle and still backing the vaccine and
[59:43] everything he also showed where the pope
[59:46] Pope the pope today
[59:48] said the the the the two greatest needs
[59:51] in the world were Humanity had to
[59:54] vaccinate them all
[59:57] tada
[59:58] he left out that person
[1:00:01] amen I might also shock you so so the
[1:00:04] news broadcaster and this you need to
[1:00:06] hear this because
[1:00:08] like amen don't put your hope in people
[1:00:12] don't put your hope in politicians don't
[1:00:14] even put your hope in the fivefold
[1:00:16] ministry although God uses them the real
[1:00:18] five-fold Ministry but put your hope in
[1:00:20] Christ we're going to heaven and Canada
[1:00:23] ain't heaven and Uganda ain't Heaven
[1:00:26] either or the Philippines or any other
[1:00:29] place definitely not the Americans
[1:00:33] you see what I mean and up north ain't
[1:00:35] happening down North ain't heaven
[1:00:40] because the same Lucifer
[1:00:42] is controlling every one of them
[1:00:44] now there's there's ones where there
[1:00:46] might be
[1:00:47] you know less
[1:00:50] but before we go it'll all be the same
[1:00:53] you know there's 69 countries in the
[1:00:55] world where it's illegal to be something
[1:00:58] but that'll all change before we go
[1:01:00] it has to
[1:01:01] it has to it's called the
[1:01:04] squeeze
[1:01:06] and it's called taking us out of here
[1:01:08] and Christ will take us out of here so I
[1:01:09] want you you know ask the flesh we get
[1:01:12] oh well if we just get a new government
[1:01:13] I say that too often
[1:01:15] nothing will change
[1:01:19] Trump made on Max told me that he said
[1:01:21] he's he's he he said he's just one of
[1:01:23] them he is one of them he's taken his
[1:01:25] orders from the Pope
[1:01:27] so they showed me the guy came back and
[1:01:29] he said well how's how's China and
[1:01:31] Russia and even I I said I believe the
[1:01:33] states will go to war with China and I
[1:01:35] do believe that I I did clarify that it
[1:01:37] wasn't a prophecy but man when you hear
[1:01:39] this brother he said well how's China
[1:01:41] tie you into controlling the world we
[1:01:42] know it came from there and China was
[1:01:44] the one that came out with a lot of the
[1:01:46] vaccinations and and uh
[1:01:48] and we know that the virus came from
[1:01:50] there
[1:01:52] and he said now he knows this personally
[1:01:54] he knew the bride personally he'd
[1:01:56] interviewed him for an hour he said that
[1:01:58] you know that
[1:01:59] China receives traffickers I'm speaking
[1:02:03] in
[1:02:04] uh
[1:02:06] so adults to understand and so I don't
[1:02:08] get in
[1:02:09] prison tomorrow
[1:02:11] but China receives traffickers from Rome
[1:02:14] and Italy
[1:02:16] and those bodies are Saran Wrap babies
[1:02:21] children
[1:02:22] and that brother had worked 20 years
[1:02:25] cutting the Saran Wrap off of infants
[1:02:28] headed to China
[1:02:30] because the the news broadcaster asked
[1:02:32] him he said how come China pays Rome
[1:02:36] like 120 million a month
[1:02:39] and he said see China's the boss of the
[1:02:41] world they actually got dominion over
[1:02:43] China and that doctor watch this that
[1:02:45] doctor
[1:02:47] no way you're right brother Matt that
[1:02:49] doctor
[1:02:53] caught something and he went out to his
[1:02:55] producer so exactly that's how he said
[1:02:57] you watching me he walked out to his
[1:02:59] producer and he said did you hear what
[1:03:00] that guy said China was the boss
[1:03:05] he said not even close
[1:03:07] he said Rome is a drug lord
[1:03:10] and they have a product called children
[1:03:12] for trafficking
[1:03:13] and they sell it to China and China pays
[1:03:16] 120 million a month to Italy Rome
[1:03:23] and you thought this world was your home
[1:03:25] I'm just like I almost lost control and
[1:03:27] the girls sang that song
[1:03:29] the God all I can think about is getting
[1:03:31] out of here
[1:03:32] I I just just just come and take me home
[1:03:36] I don't want to live here
[1:03:38] brother Matt I don't want to live here I
[1:03:41] want to go home in a rapture
[1:03:44] that is that is the most
[1:03:47] I can I actually sent the videos to
[1:03:49] Sister Ruth everything
[1:03:51] was it yeah matter of fact he went into
[1:03:54] so many things and not sorry I'm
[1:03:58] supposed to be preaching but he went
[1:03:59] into everything was the inflation of
[1:04:02] Mexico coming into the United States He
[1:04:04] said what what religion is Mexico
[1:04:07] 95 percent thank you sister Patty Roman
[1:04:11] Catholic
[1:04:12] everything
[1:04:14] is a plant
[1:04:16] everything is a plan it's a one world
[1:04:18] government and it's coming really fast
[1:04:21] really fast and I'm going to tell you
[1:04:23] something I don't believe it was but
[1:04:26] that vaccination accepting that from
[1:04:28] Rome you accept that from the Roman
[1:04:30] Catholic Church that was very closest
[1:04:33] thing to the mark of the beast
[1:04:36] I don't believe it was
[1:04:37] but that was in part
[1:04:40] accepting Fellowship
[1:04:42] with evil
[1:04:44] now I you might all leave me by next
[1:04:47] Sunday but
[1:04:49] if I tell you something evil
[1:04:51] and you take it and still fellowship
[1:04:53] with me
[1:04:55] that's given the right hand to
[1:04:56] Fellowship
[1:04:57] and that's what the mark of the beast is
[1:05:05] I mean sometimes the truth is scary but
[1:05:09] wow
[1:05:10] amen God help God help us man it's not
[1:05:13] going to get easier before we leave
[1:05:15] amen it all it will get easier
[1:05:19] as you surrendered him you say it just
[1:05:21] don't matter God it just don't matter it
[1:05:24] just doesn't matter
[1:05:25] everything's yours
[1:05:28] that that's that's my goodness that wow
[1:05:32] God help us God help us you know see
[1:05:34] here we read our last scripture in first
[1:05:36] Samuel 15 22 he said God God has
[1:05:40] his obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:05:44] God is expecting obedience in his word
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] God is expecting obedience and and watch
[1:05:52] here in first Samuel 15 23 and it says
[1:05:55] to re Rebellion as the sin of Witchcraft
[1:05:59] and stubbornness is as iniquity iniquity
[1:06:03] is the no to do right not do it so there
[1:06:06] you know the word of God and you look
[1:06:07] right at the word of God and you say
[1:06:09] about I don't know I'm not going to read
[1:06:10] that for devotions
[1:06:14] amen and you know even my you know when
[1:06:17] I was studying even my wife said you
[1:06:18] know we were talking some of these
[1:06:20] things and I was showing her the video
[1:06:21] and he said you know you know if you're
[1:06:22] struggling with what I just said you
[1:06:24] know the Bible says that if you were
[1:06:25] guilty in one part
[1:06:33] yeah
[1:06:34] if you you're a really good believer but
[1:06:36] you're guilty in just one part
[1:06:40] you guilty of them all
[1:06:42] amen God help us amen this is this is
[1:06:45] see God wants God's Mary God never came
[1:06:48] to marry a baby he came to marry mature
[1:06:51] adults that that are sold out to him
[1:06:54] amen it's it's it's it's just
[1:06:56] wow it's beautiful
[1:06:59] it's beautiful amen
[1:07:02] Hallelujah
[1:07:04] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:07:10] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:07:12] here in first in Samuels or in James I'm
[1:07:15] sorry in James 22 it says but be not
[1:07:19] doers of the word
[1:07:21] but be
[1:07:22] be not
[1:07:24] but be ye doers of the word sorry and
[1:07:27] not hearers only deceiving only
[1:07:29] yourselves you need to pull that up
[1:07:31] because that's worth seeing James swan
[1:07:34] 22. being doers of the word and not
[1:07:38] hearers only deceiving
[1:07:40] yourself
[1:07:42] wow amen this is this is not amen look
[1:07:47] at look at the hear what the prophet
[1:07:48] said he said here in in 63 uh here he
[1:07:53] said the paragraph uh one-on-one he said
[1:07:55] let to be born again is to have a new
[1:07:58] nature come in and he said the only way
[1:07:59] is to kill the nature that's inside of
[1:08:01] you
[1:08:02] that you might become
[1:08:04] the word the living the word living
[1:08:07] because the word's a living thing and
[1:08:10] it's the expression of itself through
[1:08:11] you and I I got this just blessed my
[1:08:13] heart to say this and there's so many
[1:08:16] scriptures where the Prophet mentioned
[1:08:17] this he said when you're looking into a
[1:08:20] Looking Glass when people see you as
[1:08:23] Amir
[1:08:25] he said because you know that God made
[1:08:27] uh made a way and people don't read the
[1:08:32] Bible now how many know that
[1:08:34] people do not read the Bible
[1:08:36] maybe even Christians struggle with
[1:08:38] reading the Bible
[1:08:40] you know that people do not read the
[1:08:41] Bible so God has made no this is a
[1:08:44] direct quote and so God has made you a
[1:08:47] Bible
[1:08:49] you are
[1:08:51] what you do people are looking
[1:08:55] at you
[1:08:57] Amen Let me just read another one let's
[1:09:00] just go up here and I wrote it on my
[1:09:02] thing here here in 64 questions and
[1:09:04] answers he said Christians aren't what
[1:09:06] you say it's what you live what you do
[1:09:09] it's an it's an example he said you are
[1:09:13] the salt of the earth people are
[1:09:14] watching you and even more so you know
[1:09:17] if the world gets darker and darker
[1:09:19] there might only be a few of you but
[1:09:21] when I go to the shed and it's midnight
[1:09:23] dark I can take a really small lash late
[1:09:26] and I can see where I'm going
[1:09:28] hey man
[1:09:30] people are watching you and people
[1:09:32] that's another great quote on questions
[1:09:35] and answers oh wait uh 30 in the morning
[1:09:37] he said people won't go to church
[1:09:43] how did the prophet know that message
[1:09:45] people won't even go to church
[1:09:47] they said people won't go to church
[1:09:52] but they'll read you
[1:09:55] and you better see what you do
[1:09:58] because the only church they're going to
[1:10:00] see
[1:10:01] is you at the grocery store
[1:10:04] amen a paragraph 47 he said the of
[1:10:07] the spirit is the holy spirit is a being
[1:10:09] it's God it's God in you the person the
[1:10:13] person God that's the whole entire being
[1:10:18] like wow
[1:10:20] is it neat and it's in you
[1:10:23] let me all right to read that again the
[1:10:26] holy spirit is a being it's God
[1:10:30] and God in you the person God
[1:10:34] you're able to say sit down
[1:10:37] wow
[1:10:39] and that's it your whole entire being
[1:10:43] you're changed you're a new creature
[1:10:48] the things you do the world will look at
[1:10:50] you and go oh oh I don't understand they
[1:10:54] are never going to understand you
[1:10:57] hey man you won't even understand you
[1:11:01] I'm mad
[1:11:03] paragraph 48 he said whatever you've
[1:11:06] done for God it won't mean one thing
[1:11:08] he's talking about he's talking about if
[1:11:10] you jumped and preached and spoke in
[1:11:12] tongues and prophesied and did all that
[1:11:14] he said whatever you've done for God it
[1:11:17] won't mean one thing if the Holy Spirit
[1:11:19] wasn't there to condemn you to to
[1:11:23] condemn you
[1:11:25] on the things that are right
[1:11:28] and wrong
[1:11:30] you know I told you there last week that
[1:11:32] we went and seen people that Luanne had
[1:11:34] not seen for 40 years at the funeral
[1:11:38] I told you that
[1:11:40] you know she had a friend
[1:11:44] it was before we were married so that's
[1:11:46] a while ago
[1:11:50] told her when she's there she said I
[1:11:51] have something to make right with you
[1:11:53] he ain't a message Believer by the way
[1:11:56] not that I know
[1:11:58] and he called the land this week
[1:12:02] if the Holy Spirit ain't in you to
[1:12:04] condemn what's right
[1:12:07] and what's wrong he had only spoken to
[1:12:10] Luanne on the telephone
[1:12:13] in a harsh way
[1:12:16] after we got engaged
[1:12:19] hello
[1:12:21] that was like 39 years ago
[1:12:25] and it was still condemning him and he
[1:12:28] was living with them because he had
[1:12:30] talked harshly
[1:12:34] whoa
[1:12:38] how much more
[1:12:42] amen and if the Holy Spirit
[1:12:45] that the Holy Spirit isn't in there to
[1:12:47] condemn you on the things that is right
[1:12:49] and wrong you know God lives in you know
[1:12:52] this is I can't preach any happier than
[1:12:55] that
[1:12:56] if you know God lives in you and that
[1:12:59] you won't walk on your own mind it's the
[1:13:03] mind of Christ that leads you in the
[1:13:05] word
[1:13:07] in the word
[1:13:12] wow
[1:13:14] man this message is fantastic
[1:13:17] I
[1:13:18] it's it's just God it's it's God's
[1:13:22] fantastic
[1:13:26] to think that God almighty
[1:13:28] is a being the spirit of God God is the
[1:13:31] spirit knows the word the spirit is a
[1:13:33] being and you're a hundred percent the
[1:13:36] spirit
[1:13:37] oh Church my goodness you did
[1:13:42] whoa
[1:13:45] so watch Aaron he said whatever he says
[1:13:47] and this is an older quote he said he
[1:13:49] said it We Don't Preach he said it's a
[1:13:52] holy spirit that does the speaking oh
[1:13:53] you might write something he's talking
[1:13:55] about this is the Prophet by the way I'm
[1:13:57] actually reading this
[1:13:59] he said you might write something down
[1:14:01] us ministers we might study I know it
[1:14:03] says study yourself and prove and I love
[1:14:04] being in the word of God that's not a
[1:14:06] problem
[1:14:07] but I say things that don't have nothing
[1:14:09] to do with studying
[1:14:11] he said you might write something down
[1:14:13] but that isn't that isn't preaching
[1:14:16] he said preaching is the inspiration
[1:14:18] that comes and sees the preaching is
[1:14:20] inspired by the Holy Ghost and he said
[1:14:22] that gives the uh the anointing gives
[1:14:25] the action
[1:14:27] to the word of God he said just he said
[1:14:31] you can read something and it doesn't
[1:14:32] matter a bit
[1:14:34] he said but when the Holy Spirit grabs
[1:14:37] onto
[1:14:39] it it won't matter how the preacher says
[1:14:41] it won't matter if his coat matches his
[1:14:44] patents
[1:14:45] when the Holy Spirit grabs onto it
[1:14:48] look out Scout
[1:14:50] amen God help us amen
[1:14:53] God help us amen hallelujah he said
[1:14:56] Malachi 2 2 so we can move on with this
[1:15:00] uh Malachi 2 2 if ye will not hear to
[1:15:04] give Glory unto my name sayeth the Lord
[1:15:07] of hosts I will then send a curse upon
[1:15:11] you and I will curse your blessings yea
[1:15:14] I have cursed them already
[1:15:17] because you have not laid it
[1:15:21] in your heart
[1:15:24] I'll give you the wrong
[1:15:26] scripture
[1:15:27] I must be seeing it wrong
[1:15:33] I'm sorry your pastor is amen

[1:15:42] Malachi 2-2 amen
[1:15:45] you know my wife tells me that you're
[1:15:47] not supposed to say you're and
[1:15:49] I read a quote the other day for the
[1:15:51] prophet said I don't have it with me and
[1:15:53] the prophet said that it was good for
[1:15:54] you to insult yourself
[1:15:56] that raises Christ's stuff now don't you
[1:15:59] do it somebody else but if you do it to
[1:16:01] yourself
[1:16:02] amen
[1:16:04] hallelujah it's the truth amen God help
[1:16:07] us see here we we need to hear God's
[1:16:10] word and give glory to him sometimes we
[1:16:12] say you know everything we have is God's
[1:16:15] here here you know in this scripture
[1:16:17] we're going to look at where God sends a
[1:16:19] minister out he said don't take nothing
[1:16:21] with you
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:24] I I could tell you some stories but I
[1:16:27] think you would see me but but
[1:16:30] even probably my own kids thought that
[1:16:33] we had personally lost our mind you know
[1:16:34] when when you get older the Bible says
[1:16:36] that you become as children
[1:16:38] and I think our kids are thinking that
[1:16:40] if Luanne ain't there I'm probably
[1:16:42] getting close to it
[1:16:44] but I I have scriptures and quotes watch
[1:16:46] this
[1:16:47] we couldn't afford to go to Uganda
[1:16:50] me and my wife figured out the bill we
[1:16:52] spent about 23 000 Canadian 100 on the
[1:16:55] Visa
[1:16:56] that's exactly 100 the Bible
[1:16:59] he said you don't listen to what people
[1:17:01] say don't listen Jake's go where God
[1:17:04] sends you he said don't take a suitcase
[1:17:07] don't take a second pair of shoes don't
[1:17:09] take any money and he said that's where
[1:17:12] he was actually talking about the muzzle
[1:17:14] and the ox of the servant being worthy
[1:17:15] to hire you and he said you go into the
[1:17:17] house and you live from the people
[1:17:24] man
[1:17:25] God help us if you will not hear and
[1:17:27] give Glory unto my name say it's the
[1:17:29] Lord of hosts I'll send a curse unto you
[1:17:31] and curse your blessings
[1:17:32] now man we don't need our blessings
[1:17:34] cursed
[1:17:37] for sure not
[1:17:39] God help us
[1:17:40] let's move on Hebrews 10.
[1:17:44] Hebrews 10 31 it is a fearful thing
[1:17:48] to fall into the hands
[1:17:50] of a living God Hebrews 10 31 a fearful
[1:17:53] thing to fall into the hands of the
[1:17:54] Living God and the prophet will mention
[1:17:56] we'll read some quotes on that Amen Let
[1:17:58] me just read uh
[1:18:00] uh
[1:18:03] some here he said people were making fun
[1:18:06] of him when he was when when not I have
[1:18:10] to be careful when he says when the
[1:18:11] prophet was Discerning the thoughts of
[1:18:13] the people now people come up to him he
[1:18:15] said that's fortune telling
[1:18:17] remember I mentioned about the devil
[1:18:19] perverts everything God does
[1:18:22] he said farting telling his other of the
[1:18:25] devil
[1:18:26] the people that were doing that to our
[1:18:28] Prophet were insulting God they weren't
[1:18:30] insulting the prophet they were
[1:18:32] insulting Jehovah God he said did you
[1:18:35] ever he said he said that's taking
[1:18:37] that's nothing but a gift perverted
[1:18:42] he said just like on righteousness to
[1:18:45] righteousness perverted
[1:18:47] see everything that we do serving God
[1:18:49] the devil has took it and perverted it
[1:18:52] so he says he said did you ever see a
[1:18:54] fortune teller preaching the gospel save
[1:18:56] and soul
[1:19:00] no but they'll sell it for money
[1:19:05] stay away from that money
[1:19:08] amen a fortune teller healing holding a
[1:19:12] healing service or doing some great
[1:19:14] money Works to God no it's a it's a it's
[1:19:17] a it's a permission
[1:19:20] it's a perversion of what Jehovah God
[1:19:23] only can do we know that you're a man
[1:19:25] sent from God because no man
[1:19:28] can do these things
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:31] Hallelujah so be careful friends what
[1:19:34] you say about
[1:19:36] about anything that God does that's what
[1:19:39] I said oh man that's not my anointed he
[1:19:41] said be careful what you say about
[1:19:43] anything what God does because it's a
[1:19:45] dangerous thing to fall into the hands
[1:19:47] of a living God and if you don't
[1:19:49] understand it
[1:19:52] you'd better just sleep still
[1:19:55] don't say nothing say the Lord Make Me
[1:19:58] humble and I'll understand and come to
[1:20:00] that
[1:20:04] you wouldn't want to know the things
[1:20:05] that people said when God started to
[1:20:07] work here
[1:20:09] it's a kind of attitude he said you just
[1:20:11] get away from get up go away with the
[1:20:14] crowd and pass your own opinion he said
[1:20:16] search the scriptures
[1:20:19] it's a fearful thing to fall into the
[1:20:21] hands of God
[1:20:22] he said if it be God stay with it and if
[1:20:25] it isn't God get away from it
[1:20:27] but if it's if it isn't scriptural
[1:20:31] than it is of god
[1:20:34] amen
[1:20:35] here he says that just falling down he
[1:20:38] says I'm only reading the highlights he
[1:20:39] said he said he will never be without a
[1:20:42] witness
[1:20:43] and he said when God sends a gift to
[1:20:45] Earth he sends and the people reject it
[1:20:48] that generation goes into chaos and
[1:20:51] Blackness and darkness
[1:20:54] and reject darkness of and rejecting God
[1:20:58] watch us God judges that generation
[1:21:02] the same way that generation mocked
[1:21:07] God's gifts
[1:21:10] wow
[1:21:12] the exact same way that those people
[1:21:15] mock God's gifts is how God Will Mock
[1:21:18] and judge them
[1:21:20] for rejecting them
[1:21:25] wow
[1:21:27] I want to know these things I personally
[1:21:30] want to know these things
[1:21:32] I don't understand just
[1:21:35] God help me
[1:21:37] no man has tamed the tongue but the Holy
[1:21:40] Spirit
[1:21:41] amen
[1:21:43] Hebrews 13 7
[1:21:46] Hebrews 13 7. and we're going to read uh
[1:21:50] I I there's multiple quotes on these I
[1:21:52] go into the message Hub and I'm just
[1:21:54] printing these quotes out that the
[1:21:56] prophet said in the same verse but I
[1:21:57] erase them I I had ones that I think and
[1:22:00] I erased more last night when I was
[1:22:02] printing them and
[1:22:03] remember them which have the rule over
[1:22:06] you
[1:22:07] who have spoken unto you the words of
[1:22:10] God
[1:22:11] whose Faith follow considering the end
[1:22:15] of their conversation and here the
[1:22:18] prophet said in identifying Christ in
[1:22:20] all ages he said because the Bible says
[1:22:22] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:22:24] today and forever identifying Christ in
[1:22:28] all ages you know how you're identifying
[1:22:30] Christ what's Christ Christ is the
[1:22:32] anointed one and you are anointed this
[1:22:35] morning
[1:22:36] amen you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:39] Ghost who's Christ this morning
[1:22:41] hello the anointed the Holy Ghost filled
[1:22:44] brothers and sisters are anointed with
[1:22:46] Christ not you in the flesh aren't
[1:22:48] Christ but if if you are the being of
[1:22:51] God inside you
[1:22:53] amen watch what he says here identifying
[1:22:56] Christ and all now did you notice here
[1:22:58] that the scripture saying remember those
[1:23:00] that have the rule over you considering
[1:23:03] your conversation you see the end of
[1:23:06] their conversation is Jesus Christ
[1:23:09] the same yesterday
[1:23:11] today
[1:23:13] and forever
[1:23:15] amen that's not a yesterday gospel
[1:23:17] that's a right now Jesus
[1:23:20] amen hallelujah
[1:23:22] Hallelujah I had a brother one time tell
[1:23:25] me
[1:23:26] that this was the government
[1:23:28] I said I never knew any government
[1:23:31] to watch for my Souls
[1:23:36] amen God help us
[1:23:38] amen Matthew 10
[1:23:43] and seven
[1:23:47] if we're in the same house remain as
[1:23:48] eating and drinking and such things as
[1:23:51] was given for a laborer
[1:23:54] is worthy of us higher in Matthew 10 10
[1:23:56] it says a Workman is worthy of his meat
[1:24:00] and here here in the Revelation Series
[1:24:02] in 61 the prophet mentions he says he
[1:24:05] says you go and you're sent
[1:24:08] and he said he said you don't take it
[1:24:10] with Assurance he said you don't go
[1:24:13] because you're going to get this this is
[1:24:15] his exact words he said you don't go
[1:24:17] because you're going to get a hundred
[1:24:18] thousand dollars
[1:24:20] for preaching a Revival
[1:24:22] he said you don't go he said he said you
[1:24:25] go because you were sent to go I'm
[1:24:28] sending you to go
[1:24:32] and he says
[1:24:34] you go right where you're sent and I
[1:24:37] already mentioned this and don't pay no
[1:24:39] attention
[1:24:40] to all the critics
[1:24:42] I say otherwise
[1:24:43] what anybody else says
[1:24:45] amen and he says later the same hour
[1:24:48] remaineth in the same house rather
[1:24:50] remaining in the house eating and
[1:24:52] drinking such as was given unto them
[1:24:57] that means when you go to the mission
[1:24:58] field you don't fill your suitcase with
[1:25:00] granola bars
[1:25:05] because you'll live eating their food
[1:25:08] amen I found that to be true
[1:25:10] and now that now the prophet puts us in
[1:25:12] Brackets and the prophets mocking the
[1:25:16] people that's coming against God's word
[1:25:17] and he said now all this stuff about
[1:25:19] eating meat and so forth oh my goodness
[1:25:22] see
[1:25:26] profit like eating meat
[1:25:28] even the Lord liked to eat meat when he
[1:25:30] came to Abraham they killed the little
[1:25:33] calf gave a meat and milk
[1:25:35] I'm going to do well in heaven brother
[1:25:36] Tim
[1:25:38] amen for the laborers are worthy of his
[1:25:41] higher
[1:25:42] he goes into this morning man Matthew 5
[1:25:46] 37 let her let your communication be
[1:25:49] Matthew 5 37 let your communication be
[1:25:52] yea and yay and nae and nay for
[1:25:57] whatsoever more these cometh
[1:26:00] is of evil
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:04] we need to be honest people
[1:26:07] we need to be honest people in the
[1:26:09] country
[1:26:11] if we say something we need to stand
[1:26:13] with our word even if it hurts
[1:26:15] amen
[1:26:20] I share things like this
[1:26:23] in other countries amen but hearing
[1:26:25] questions and answers in 57 the prophet
[1:26:28] says to say make sure that you hold your
[1:26:30] hand
[1:26:31] oh here here's somebody coming to the
[1:26:33] prophet it was a Catholic priest and he
[1:26:35] said will you hold your hand out and
[1:26:37] solemnly swear to tell the truth and he
[1:26:39] the prophet said he said I will not
[1:26:43] the prophet is preaching back to the
[1:26:45] priest and he says because the Bible
[1:26:47] says that to swear not in heaven or on
[1:26:50] Earth because the Earth was his
[1:26:51] footstool and it says let your yab not
[1:26:54] and the bishop said something he said
[1:26:56] well I want to hear what you got to say
[1:26:58] he said did you baptize a certain
[1:27:01] certain person in the name of the Lord
[1:27:03] Jesus Christ
[1:27:05] he said I did
[1:27:08] but I won't swear
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:13] God help us I know when we put up our
[1:27:15] fence and you know the prophet said
[1:27:16] things that are uh you know we're going
[1:27:19] to get into where he paid this taxes
[1:27:21] amen and things I know when we we put up
[1:27:24] a line fence and the the people refused
[1:27:27] to obey the law and and we went to a
[1:27:29] tribunal and they wanted me to swear in
[1:27:31] the Bible and I said no sorry I can't do
[1:27:33] that
[1:27:34] and I'd forgive you forget how they
[1:27:35] handled that but I still testify
[1:27:39] and the neighbor still paid for path
[1:27:40] defense
[1:27:42] amen it don't mean that Christians have
[1:27:45] to be a doormat no different than your
[1:27:47] wife isn't a doormat you don't have to
[1:27:49] be a doormat like imagine I I don't even
[1:27:52] understand some things that uh
[1:27:54] uh you know as the government changes
[1:27:56] and comes in on us amen we have the
[1:27:59] right to to have the law
[1:28:01] that stands with us
[1:28:03] amen
[1:28:05] you don't just have to give everything
[1:28:10] amen like for example when we put the
[1:28:13] gravel in the backyard and we were
[1:28:14] improving the parking lot that's been
[1:28:16] there before the town was here
[1:28:19] they come after us and said we're going
[1:28:20] to put 10 000 on your taxes
[1:28:23] and because you didn't get an engineer
[1:28:25] and put drains in and pavement and
[1:28:27] concrete it and all this and I just said
[1:28:29] uh
[1:28:30] I went and seen Mr lawyer
[1:28:32] and Mr lawyer wrote him a letter and he
[1:28:34] quoted back their loss to them
[1:28:36] instead of this has ever been a parking
[1:28:38] lot it can be maintained as a parking
[1:28:40] lot don't matter how much the parking
[1:28:42] lot was in disrepower
[1:28:45] see so a Christian just don't you don't
[1:28:48] just throw out the money
[1:28:50] necessarily
[1:28:52] their own laws they were see they were
[1:28:54] trying to abuse you the Christians
[1:28:56] aren't to be abused they're supposed to
[1:28:58] be humble and submissive but hey man if
[1:29:01] you don't
[1:29:02] huh
[1:29:04] so that'll get your hair up when when
[1:29:07] people keep people in jail that they
[1:29:09] don't even have a right to keep in jail
[1:29:11] like Tamar from the truckers Convoy and
[1:29:13] she never even committed she never broke
[1:29:15] a law the Constitution stands with her
[1:29:18] for the right to to demonstrate and they
[1:29:21] left her in jail for almost two years
[1:29:24] that government should be kicked in the
[1:29:26] knee
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:29] because their own laws condemn them
[1:29:32] their own laws
[1:29:34] that's not breaking the law their own
[1:29:36] laws condemned them
[1:29:37] amen that's like when the Government
[1:29:39] tried to close the churches and in the
[1:29:42] Constitution that we have the right to
[1:29:44] freedom and worship period that's their
[1:29:47] law
[1:29:50] besides that their law don't stand above
[1:29:53] the law of God
[1:29:54] every time it comes second
[1:29:57] amen here here's talking about let's
[1:29:59] read uh
[1:30:01] they're talking about here here you
[1:30:04] should be honest and truthful and you
[1:30:05] let your yay be day and your nae nae and
[1:30:07] I I tease Leo with this and that in
[1:30:10] Uganda because you know we show up four
[1:30:12] four hours late to a church but there's
[1:30:14] something to that he said watch this he
[1:30:16] said the prophet says we're not supposed
[1:30:18] to have vain repetition and not have
[1:30:20] Idle Words let your yes be yes and your
[1:30:24] no no
[1:30:25] if you say you're going to show up show
[1:30:28] up
[1:30:28] if you say you're going to buy a
[1:30:30] lawnmower buy a lawnmower
[1:30:33] or whatever little thing it is
[1:30:36] he said for any more of this cometh
[1:30:41] for anything more than this come a sin
[1:30:49] so whichever is more is this cometh evil
[1:30:52] the Bible says evil the prophet said sin
[1:30:56] he won't sinned
[1:31:00] amen so you could have good and believe
[1:31:03] me I got the T-shirt I used to tell
[1:31:05] people I'd show up to work on their
[1:31:06] house and
[1:31:07] some of them I still haven't showed up
[1:31:09] for
[1:31:11] amen everybody I said when are you going
[1:31:14] to show up and I'd say two weeks and
[1:31:17] but I was
[1:31:19] God forgive me
[1:31:21] man we shouldn't we shouldn't mature and
[1:31:23] come out of that just say truthfully I'm
[1:31:25] busy I can't be there for two months
[1:31:28] maybe not even this year
[1:31:30] I wasn't good at that
[1:31:33] man what kind of people should we ought
[1:31:35] to be then this is a prophet talking we
[1:31:37] should be sober and ready always looking
[1:31:40] and waiting for the leading of the Holy
[1:31:42] Spirit Christians are the salt of the
[1:31:45] earth that's what he's saying about this
[1:31:47] verse right here
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] you have watched this and I love this oh
[1:31:55] I love this praise God I tell you I
[1:31:58] challenge you when you're at home this
[1:32:01] last week I've been listening to the
[1:32:02] message every night in bed I put it
[1:32:04] going when I go to bed and five o'clock
[1:32:06] when I wake up I set it up it's been
[1:32:08] amazing but listen the invisible Union
[1:32:10] of Christ
[1:32:11] right before he died oh my you'll just
[1:32:15] you'll be fat spiritually
[1:32:17] he said watch this those are the prophet
[1:32:19] talking paragraph 33. he said you got a
[1:32:22] barrel of meat
[1:32:23] and a barrel of salt you know I want to
[1:32:25] cut in here remember what I was saying
[1:32:27] about going to the preachers
[1:32:29] thing you know seen the preacher at the
[1:32:31] guy station going to preacher singing
[1:32:33] and going here going there
[1:32:36] I said I'm not joining them but I'm
[1:32:37] trying to
[1:32:38] huh
[1:32:40] you know the prophet deal with this he
[1:32:42] said you got a barrel of meat and you
[1:32:44] got a barrel of salt here
[1:32:46] and it'll never save the meat until you
[1:32:49] get the salt in contact with the meat
[1:32:53] uh-oh
[1:32:54] so if you just keep living in your home
[1:32:57] and you never say anything or do
[1:32:59] anything and you just hide your little
[1:33:01] beautiful light under a bushel and you
[1:33:03] don't share it with anybody because
[1:33:04] you're afraid of hurting your little
[1:33:06] tiny feelings
[1:33:08] you're afraid of the meat getting mixed
[1:33:11] you'll never save the meat till it comes
[1:33:14] in contact and we got to be salty and
[1:33:17] it's got a contact
[1:33:20] the world
[1:33:23] that means you got to have
[1:33:27] or you got to be really bright
[1:33:30] he said you got to be salty and it's got
[1:33:32] to contact the world it's the Savor and
[1:33:34] the salt makes the salt creates a thirst
[1:33:37] and when you're a Christian people who's
[1:33:39] called themselves Christians are we
[1:33:41] Christians we call ourselves Christians
[1:33:44] then then we'll be then you call
[1:33:47] yourself Christians we'll be so salty
[1:33:50] will be so salty
[1:33:53] that when you go outside everybody the
[1:33:56] sidewalk walks up to talk to you
[1:34:02] that the world will desire to be just
[1:34:05] like you you're making a contact
[1:34:10] with them
[1:34:13] I wonder if we've been doing a good job
[1:34:15] on that
[1:34:21] have you seen Christians you'd say oh I
[1:34:25] just love to be like that woman
[1:34:27] I just love to be
[1:34:30] like that man
[1:34:33] if there ever was a Christian then there
[1:34:35] is one that's salty and you just be
[1:34:39] salty
[1:34:40] and God
[1:34:43] will take care of the thirst
[1:34:48] Matt
[1:34:50] the prophet and other places said that
[1:34:52] if we if we weren't salty God would
[1:34:54] judge us for not doing it
[1:34:57] amen
[1:34:58] wow
[1:35:00] taxes Matthew 22.
[1:35:04] actually before we go into that James 7
[1:35:07] this is the same
[1:35:08] same line as conversation James 7 or
[1:35:12] James 5 12. he said Above All Things
[1:35:15] Brethren swear not neither by Heaven
[1:35:17] neither by Earth neither by any other
[1:35:19] oath but let your yea be ye and your nay
[1:35:23] nay lest ye fall into
[1:35:27] condemnation
[1:35:29] so you know see if you want to take that
[1:35:32] to the extreme
[1:35:34] if you said you know
[1:35:37] this is I know this is to the extreme
[1:35:39] but sometimes the prophet said when
[1:35:42] you're you're lean you lean one way to
[1:35:44] bring them to pull them back to center
[1:35:45] of the road and then I'll come right
[1:35:47] back to the center well like I was
[1:35:49] trying to explain this to Pastor Leo I
[1:35:51] said you know we told him we'd be there
[1:35:53] four hours ago we told them we'd be
[1:35:55] there at 11 o'clock and we showed up at
[1:35:57] three o'clock
[1:35:58] that you'd have no condemnation
[1:36:05] see you can't put your
[1:36:07] traditions
[1:36:09] the head of God's word
[1:36:16] you can say well us Canadians we're just
[1:36:18] starting we don't get excited
[1:36:20] well maybe you need to get the baptism
[1:36:22] of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:23] you won't be Canadian anymore
[1:36:27] amen
[1:36:28] just like
[1:36:29] you know I I was Pastor Leo asked me
[1:36:32] because we're friends and we speak the
[1:36:34] truth he you know he was driving the one
[1:36:36] time and it rained and the road was
[1:36:37] slippery and you've seen the road to
[1:36:38] stick to their mess they're they're
[1:36:40] they're not even roads they're just
[1:36:42] like
[1:36:43] they're terrible
[1:36:45] I mean they call them roads but
[1:36:48] you know by the way this just came to me
[1:36:49] you know when we were finding Pastor
[1:36:51] Sandy's house we we we would pull up our
[1:36:54] Google on my phone
[1:36:57] and they would have the roads there and
[1:36:59] they'd say no identification to these
[1:37:00] roads
[1:37:03] they were appointing us to his church
[1:37:06] that was the freeway anyway
[1:37:09] he asked me he said well have you ever
[1:37:12] drove on slippery roads and I said
[1:37:13] pastor Leo he said we get snow and ice
[1:37:17] because he was saying like it rained so
[1:37:18] the roads were bad so I have to go
[1:37:20] slower I said pastor Leo I said when it
[1:37:22] snows at home and I'm going to church
[1:37:25] and I know it snowed I leave early
[1:37:33] see
[1:37:36] that's a good word
[1:37:37] that's a good word let your yay be yay
[1:37:39] that you do not have condemnation
[1:37:43] man that's why people don't trust nobody
[1:37:45] no more because they say I'm going to
[1:37:48] buy something and you have to give a
[1:37:49] deposit because
[1:37:50] that's why when we bought the girl's
[1:37:52] house you know we never signed nothing
[1:37:54] you know they agreed to so much I said
[1:37:56] I'll buy it and it was a done deal and
[1:37:57] the people were moving in and they were
[1:37:58] having a meltdown they said you ain't
[1:38:01] signed nothing I said no he told me this
[1:38:03] he told me what he wanted I have the
[1:38:05] money and
[1:38:06] he said but what if he I said it was our
[1:38:09] word
[1:38:11] Prophet said if your word ain't good
[1:38:14] you ain't no good either
[1:38:17] uh so what he said
[1:38:19] he said you're as good as your work
[1:38:21] amen so so these things are scripture I
[1:38:24] meant and and by the way I just want to
[1:38:26] point out that this is in Matthew and
[1:38:27] James
[1:38:30] amen just just so everybody knows that
[1:38:32] we're not being ridiculous here I mean
[1:38:34] this is scripture I meant taxes I mean
[1:38:36] Matthew 22 17. and that is is it lawful
[1:38:40] to paste tribute unto Caesar or not and
[1:38:44] he saith unto them whosoever
[1:38:46] is this image an inscription
[1:38:50] they said unto him Caesars then he said
[1:38:53] unto them Render unto Caesar the things
[1:38:56] which are Caesars and unto God the
[1:38:58] things which are gods
[1:39:00] amen
[1:39:02] and our Prophet had some some uh to say
[1:39:06] about this
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:15] sorry
[1:39:17] I think sure I didn't miss a quote
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:26] see they were trying at this time and we
[1:39:28] mentioned this stuff they were trying to
[1:39:30] trap Jesus
[1:39:32] and make an offense to him they were
[1:39:35] playing games with him
[1:39:37] they didn't really care what he thought
[1:39:39] about this but they were trying to get
[1:39:40] him in jail
[1:39:42] for breaking the law
[1:39:47] and here he goes into uh you know you
[1:39:50] know when uh Peter owed taxes or Peter
[1:39:53] and Jesus owed taxes
[1:39:55] in the Bible and Jesus asked Peter he
[1:39:58] said you got a fish hook in your pocket
[1:40:00] and I I love this man this is the god
[1:40:03] that you serve
[1:40:05] it's a God that you serve Jesus said I
[1:40:08] just made a deposit in a fish today
[1:40:10] I said you got a fish you got a hook
[1:40:12] Peter
[1:40:13] God knows everything
[1:40:17] and he said go drop that hook down and
[1:40:20] he said pull up that fish and cut him
[1:40:21] open he said there's a good piece in
[1:40:23] there and go pay the taxes for you
[1:40:28] and me
[1:40:30] it's always the Bible says it
[1:40:32] and let me kick into where the puff and
[1:40:34] he said so they're not offended
[1:40:37] by us
[1:40:41] wow
[1:40:43] now I don't sometimes it's impossible to
[1:40:47] not have somebody but he said let them
[1:40:49] not be offended and bring the offense to
[1:40:51] them but see go pay it Simon Peter
[1:40:55] and that'll be for me and for you
[1:41:00] but when we went down we here he's
[1:41:02] talking about the his taxes amen
[1:41:10] I better I better start again this is
[1:41:11] absolute 62. let me start at the top he
[1:41:14] said he he's under pressure about his
[1:41:17] taxes
[1:41:18] now you know I'm going to tell you this
[1:41:20] up front I would not be the person that
[1:41:23] pressured The Profit into paying taxes
[1:41:26] that he didn't know
[1:41:27] I wouldn't want to be that person
[1:41:29] brother Matt in the Judgment I just I
[1:41:32] would really want to be a long ways from
[1:41:34] that first a really long race because
[1:41:37] vengeance is mine saith the Lord
[1:41:39] but the prophet never owed that money
[1:41:42] but watch his thought in this and you
[1:41:46] know
[1:41:50] I I struggled with this quote
[1:41:53] just being honest with you because the
[1:41:56] Bible also says the borrower is a slave
[1:41:58] to the lender
[1:42:05] but here's the prophet and he said I
[1:42:07] thought that
[1:42:08] I've turned over in the Bible and I read
[1:42:10] and he said I thought that truly
[1:42:14] but here he's wrestling with God he said
[1:42:16] but Lord that's right but he said this
[1:42:19] didn't belong to Caesar this was yours
[1:42:22] he said it wasn't Caesar's he said it's
[1:42:25] been it it's being mine and he said it
[1:42:28] was paid more in taxes than something
[1:42:30] has been different he said it never
[1:42:33] belonged to Caesar but it was yours and
[1:42:36] it belonged
[1:42:37] and he said see
[1:42:40] he said and it was it don't belong to
[1:42:42] Caesar in the first place here's the
[1:42:45] prophet wrestling with God
[1:42:47] actually in the this this front page he
[1:42:49] says he said I went in to pray
[1:42:52] he said I thought I'm trying to jump
[1:42:55] ahead and God's rebuking me he said well
[1:42:57] maybe I'd better go pray again
[1:42:59] it seems like he said to me
[1:43:02] look in the scriptures and he said I
[1:43:04] went and searched the scriptures of what
[1:43:06] God said about it
[1:43:09] amen
[1:43:12] and here's the prophet searching the
[1:43:14] scriptures knowing what to do in his own
[1:43:16] life
[1:43:17] and he's saying God this money was given
[1:43:20] to the church for the mission field it
[1:43:23] never was Caesar's it's already had the
[1:43:25] taxes paid on it and we have a
[1:43:28] charitable number
[1:43:29] and I'm just going to tell you my
[1:43:31] thought if he would have had a good
[1:43:33] lawyer the prophet would have won
[1:43:37] what was it his he hadn't spent the
[1:43:39] money
[1:43:41] here's the prophet telling how he worked
[1:43:43] it out he said you know he God always
[1:43:46] says the answer in his word he said I
[1:43:48] read a little father and he said Simon
[1:43:49] you know you got a fish hook in your
[1:43:51] pocket he said you always carry a little
[1:43:53] fish hook and a string it's a good way
[1:43:54] to feed yourself and he said you just
[1:43:56] made a deposit he said I just made a
[1:43:59] deposit in the fish bank this morning
[1:44:00] down up the river he said you know he
[1:44:03] said I made a perfect deposit in a
[1:44:05] banker and he said I'll certainly Give
[1:44:06] It Up
[1:44:07] what he's got he said just go down there
[1:44:10] and throw the hook in the river
[1:44:12] and then you get up to the bank and open
[1:44:14] your mouth
[1:44:16] and there he said go pay the coin he
[1:44:17] said I thought true God
[1:44:21] but you got fish Banks
[1:44:23] and everything else across the country
[1:44:25] and I don't know how this is to be done
[1:44:31] the prophet's struggling
[1:44:33] with this you know this was a tremendous
[1:44:36] battle he went through he was almost
[1:44:37] sick to his stomach over
[1:44:40] and he said
[1:44:42] so after he read that scripture
[1:44:45] this is what the prophet did
[1:44:47] he said we went down and I got the
[1:44:50] brothers right here from the church that
[1:44:52] stood on my Note so he got brothers from
[1:44:55] the church that signed
[1:44:57] and he said I put a note in and he said
[1:44:59] I borrowed forty thousand dollars and
[1:45:01] paid the government off
[1:45:03] and he didn't owe the money
[1:45:06] but he did that so they weren't offended
[1:45:12] wow
[1:45:13] and I went home and I wanted to know the
[1:45:16] way the check was wrote see he wrote in
[1:45:18] the check if they ever came back to me
[1:45:20] again he said this say this that I'm
[1:45:23] this is what he wrote on the memo of the
[1:45:25] check this was for all taxes paid but he
[1:45:28] wrote you hear he's saying it a little
[1:45:30] differently he said this is to say that
[1:45:33] I'm free from all tax bills
[1:45:37] and if the government endorses it and
[1:45:39] takes it
[1:45:40] then
[1:45:43] they'll be in a mess and I'll be free
[1:45:45] and the prophet kept calling the bank to
[1:45:48] find out from the bank manager if they
[1:45:50] cast it
[1:45:51] and he said yes but uh
[1:45:54] they did take it they accepted it Billy
[1:45:57] they took it and he said I ran and threw
[1:45:58] my wife
[1:45:59] and he said I'm free I'm pardoned
[1:46:02] and he said I'll pay back that forty
[1:46:05] four four thousand a year forty thousand
[1:46:08] for 10 years
[1:46:12] all because he didn't want to offend the
[1:46:14] government
[1:46:16] wow
[1:46:17] now see that money
[1:46:20] there's a way when you look at that
[1:46:21] money all monies is the government
[1:46:26] even charitable money is a government
[1:46:28] law that's government money
[1:46:31] it's made by government
[1:46:33] and that's got to be the reason why the
[1:46:35] prophet and he felt God leading him to
[1:46:37] do that because there's other scriptures
[1:46:39] that would have stopped him from
[1:46:40] borrowing
[1:46:43] amen
[1:46:45] amen amen like like it but you know I'm
[1:46:49] not questioning the prophet that's he
[1:46:51] did what he felt God led him to do amen
[1:46:54] but
[1:46:57] we should be careful borrowing money
[1:47:02] amen
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:16] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:47:19] we're going to close on this we're just
[1:47:21] I'm just going to touch on this you know
[1:47:23] uh and I'm not going to preach on this
[1:47:25] because it it don't apply I'm gonna I
[1:47:28] touch the first scripture I did look
[1:47:30] into scriptures on tithes and offerings
[1:47:32] and there's dozens and dozens and dozens
[1:47:35] and dozens and dozens and dozens
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:52] Malachi 3E
[1:47:57] will man rob God yet ye have robbed me
[1:48:01] but he says wherein have you robbed thee
[1:48:04] in tithes and offerings ye are cursed
[1:48:07] with the curse for ye have robbed me
[1:48:10] even the whole nation and bringing ye
[1:48:12] all the tithes into the storehouse that
[1:48:15] there may be meat in my house and prove
[1:48:17] me now where herein herewith say it's
[1:48:21] the Lord of hosts if I will open the
[1:48:23] windows of heaven and I'll pour up
[1:48:26] blessings upon thee and that there shall
[1:48:29] be not room enough
[1:48:31] for you to contain it amen and here's
[1:48:35] the prophet he's talking about this and
[1:48:37] he gives an amazing scripture he says he
[1:48:40] says uh
[1:48:42] he says if somebody gave me 25 cents to
[1:48:44] go down and buy a loaf for Brad
[1:48:47] and and I met somebody on the street and
[1:48:49] they asked me for some money and I gave
[1:48:51] them your money
[1:48:53] he said I didn't have the right to do
[1:48:54] that
[1:48:56] and he said that's what you do when you
[1:48:58] don't pay your tithes he said you should
[1:49:00] have given your money not the money that
[1:49:02] I give you for Brad
[1:49:05] he said let them take it out of the
[1:49:07] other pocket and give them my money but
[1:49:09] this was your money the tense is the
[1:49:12] Lord's the Levi's the priest is a tense
[1:49:15] that they live on the tense of tidying
[1:49:18] is brought into the storehouse and
[1:49:19] promised to God that he would bless it
[1:49:21] and prove it
[1:49:23] tizen goes to the church pastor and so
[1:49:26] forth like that to live and the building
[1:49:28] funds
[1:49:29] and things like that are separate all
[1:49:32] together
[1:49:33] not scriptural
[1:49:35] but he here here the prophet what I want
[1:49:38] to go into the prophet he talked about
[1:49:41] how when he paid tithes
[1:49:45] when he paid tithes he said his family
[1:49:48] was sick and he said this was
[1:49:51] wow here let me just read this just find
[1:49:54] this here
[1:49:55] he said it was a challenge to any
[1:49:57] individual he said he said if I only had
[1:49:59] the time I said I would get into the
[1:50:01] scripture and finish this
[1:50:03] uh my personal testimony said now how I
[1:50:06] was even hungry and my mother and them
[1:50:09] hungry and my daddy was sick and I took
[1:50:11] my ties out of
[1:50:13] ties out first and I gave it to God and
[1:50:16] you ought to see what happened I never
[1:50:18] seen in my life where any man or woman
[1:50:20] that if you'll make a dollar a week and
[1:50:23] if you'll pay 10 cents of that money and
[1:50:26] put it in the storehouse of God that
[1:50:29] where you'll come where God will bless
[1:50:30] it
[1:50:31] he said you may call me a hypocrite but
[1:50:33] he said that's the truth sir
[1:50:35] amen we all know we all have those
[1:50:38] testimonies say man
[1:50:40] God help us amen
[1:50:43] to be here here looking back at some of
[1:50:45] these quotes that I just pulled up this
[1:50:47] morning I just want to finish on these
[1:50:48] and we can let this go amen

[1:51:25] stamps out the corn he said you go ahead
