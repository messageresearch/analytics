[6:00] a testimony I want to share. You know,
[6:02] it's uh you know, we we bring our needs
[6:04] to the Lord and we should, but it's good
[6:06] to also praise him when good things, you
[6:09] know, come our way, you know, and uh too
[6:12] too often we just let them slip by and
[6:14] and uh keep it to ourselves. Amen. But
[6:16] we just uh we've been doing a lot of hay
[6:18] this week and we've just had a good a
[6:21] good safe week. But uh but I have a spot
[6:24] where uh I've been cutting hay now for
[6:26] three years and the f the folks that own
[6:29] it, they uh they just mow the hay down
[6:31] to feed the deer. They keep the keep the
[6:34] grass fresh, you know. And so I uh I've
[6:37] been cutting a couple spots here, you
[6:39] know, for a couple years now. And and uh
[6:41] so there's some more and I had to talk
[6:43] to somebody else and this and that. And
[6:46] so we, you know, this year, you know,
[6:47] we're we're up to quite a bit that we've
[6:49] just mowed for, you know, we feed it to
[6:51] the cows and it's just free. And, you
[6:54] know, uh, so they, I talked to them last
[6:56] year. We got some more of it. And, uh,
[6:58] this year they, you know, they, I guess
[7:00] the the right hand didn't know what the
[7:02] left hand was doing. And they mowed a
[7:05] whole bunch of it, like half of it for
[7:07] me. And then I raked it, you know, and
[7:09] it just the guys that are, you know,
[7:11] we're doing a lot of it green cuz it's
[7:13] just raining quite a bit right now. So,

[7:16] are helping me, they're like, "Well, you
[7:18] know, where's the like the the what's
[7:20] good luck charm do you have?" You know,
[7:22] but it's just it's not it's not good
[7:25] luck. It's, you know, it's God's grace
[7:27] and mercy and you know, it's just uh you
[7:30] know, the world they they have a
[7:32] different opinion of that than but uh
[7:35] you know, you just see the Lord move and
[7:37] stuff like that. You know, as if it
[7:39] wasn't a good enough deal that I get it
[7:42] for free. Well, they're mowing half of
[7:44] it for me, too, you know. So, you know,

[30:09] Can I say that we're in this season? The

[30:33] said in the book of Matthew 16, he said,
[30:36] "Who do men say that I, the son of man?"

[30:43] say that you're John the Baptist, some
[30:45] say you're Jeremiah's, some say you're
[30:48] one of the prophet, but the problem that
[30:51] Jesus had with them, they did not
[30:54] understand the season that they're
[30:56] living in. Hallelujah. And we see today
[31:00] that people are so complacent that they
[31:02] don't even understand the season that
[31:05] we're in. Hallelujah.
[31:08] Praise the Lord. Do you love him this
[31:09] morning? Let's give the Lord a hearty
[31:12] praise this morning. Hallelujah. Praise

[33:54] Lord.
[33:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What a mighty
[33:59] God we serve. Amen. Hallelujah.

[34:05] Hallelujah.
[34:07] You know, we're living in a glorious
[34:09] time. And I believe that we're living in
[34:13] a wonderful time. Amen. In spite of the
[34:17] obstacles that we're facing. Despite our
[34:20] differences, hallelujah. We're here for
[34:23] a purpose. Amen. We did not bring
[34:26] ourselves here, but God bring us here.
[34:30] Amen. And when God put you somewhere, he
[34:33] expect you to be there. Hallelujah.
[34:37] Thank you, Lord. Praise God. I tell you,
[34:40] saints, you know that the Bible said,
[34:44] there will be a great shakening.
[34:47] And I believe that we're experiencing a
[34:50] great shakening.
[34:51] You know, so I want to encourage you
[34:54] this morning. Amen. And I just want to
[34:57] take this time out to wish all the
[34:59] fathers a happy father's day and the
[35:04] potential fathers as well. And even
[35:07] those that are online, I wish you a
[35:09] happy father's day. It is a special day
[35:13] and I want to give you a gift this
[35:16] morning. And the gift that I want to
[35:19] give you is a message about fathers.
[35:22] Hallelujah. That's the best gift that I
[35:25] can give you. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[35:29] And I just want to share what the Lord
[35:31] has placed on my heart.
[35:35] You know, I love you all. I love you all
[35:37] saints, you know, and I and I thank God
[35:41] for your love and your support. And we
[35:45] thank God for the pastor. Brother Dale
[35:47] is being a wonderful,
[35:50] wonderful servant to us. And we thank
[35:52] God. We give God thanks for him. And we
[35:54] give God thanks for every one of you.
[35:57] You're special. I'm just your servant.
[36:01] You know you're more important than me.
[36:03] Amen.
[36:05] You're more important than me. I'm here
[36:07] to serve you. Yes, sir. You're special.
[36:12] You know, so that's why I'm here. You
[36:14] don't It is not my will to be here. It's
[36:16] not my choice. If it is up to me, I
[36:18] wouldn't be here in the first place.
[36:20] Amen. But thank God, it's not up to our
[36:23] will. It's up to him. Amen. If you have
[36:26] a Bibles with me, could you turn your
[36:28] Bibles to the book of Genesis?
[36:32] Genesis. We're going to read a few
[36:33] verses here from the book of Genesis,
[36:35] chapter 17.
[36:37] And then after we read, then you can
[36:40] take your seat.
[36:43] Hallelujah. Bless the Lord. And we're
[36:47] going to talk about a great man. Amen.
[36:49] You know, I know that many persons, you
[36:51] know, you heard so many things about
[36:53] this great man. But you know, you can
[36:57] never heard much. Hallelujah.
[37:02] And this man that we're going to talk
[37:04] about is Abraham.
[37:06] Amen. You know, remember that his name
[37:09] was Abraham. And God changed his name
[37:12] from Abraham to Abraham. Right. So if
[37:15] you hear I'm speak about Abram, I'm just
[37:19] putting it in the context where God was
[37:22] speaking about him at the time. Right.
[37:25] So you don't don't don't don't don't
[37:27] feel any way. Amen.
[37:30] Genesis 17:E1.
[37:32] And when Abraham
[37:35] was 90 years old and nine, the Lord
[37:40] appeared to Abram
[37:43] and said unto him, I am the Almighty
[37:47] God. Glory to God. Amen. Walk before me.
[37:53] And this word, this statement, walk
[37:55] before me, it is mentioned
[37:59] two times in the Bible away from Genesis
[38:01] 17. Oh wow. It is mentioned in Genesis 5
[38:06] 24, right? And it's also mentioned in
[38:09] Genesis 6 verse 9 when God said to Noah,
[38:14] Noah, you are you are righteous.
[38:18] Hallelujah. And the Bible said, "And
[38:21] Noah walked with God."
[38:24] Amen. And here God said to Abraham,
[38:27] "Walk before me and be thou perfect."
[38:33] Hallelujah. We're going to look into
[38:35] that. And when we when the word of God
[38:38] mentioned perfect, it not mean it it's
[38:40] not meaning that you you're you're
[38:43] sinless right now. We all born in sin
[38:47] and shape in iniquity.
[38:49] Hallelujah.
[38:51] Verse two. and I will make my covenant
[38:55] between me and thee, and I will multiply
[39:00] thee exceedingly.
[39:03] And Abram fell on his face. And God
[39:07] talked with him, saying, As for me,
[39:11] behold, my covenant is with thee, and
[39:15] thou shalt be a father of many nations.
[39:21] Oh my God. Look at this covenant that
[39:24] God made. Amen. Hallelujah.
[39:27] Verse five. Neither shall thy name
[39:31] anymore be called Abraham. Abraham. But
[39:34] thy name shall be Abraham.
[39:39] For a father of many nations have I made
[39:43] thee.
[39:45] May the Lord have his blessing to his
[39:47] word. You can be seated. Thank you
[39:49] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[39:51] What a covenant that God made with
[39:54] Abraham. The word Abraham, the word
[39:57] Abraham means
[40:00] exalted father.
[40:02] Abraham means father of many nations. It
[40:08] also means father of multitudes.
[40:12] So God changed his name from Abraham to
[40:17] Abraham. Right? And as the prophet said,
[40:20] every name carry a spirit.
[40:23] Hallelujah.
[40:25] God was doing something new in this
[40:29] generation.
[40:31] God was doing something new in his plan.
[40:36] Glory to God. We understand as we make
[40:41] mention earlier that today is father's
[40:44] day, right? And I want to give you a
[40:47] gift. Right? And the gift is the role of
[40:51] a perfect father.
[40:53] We see that this world is facing the
[40:57] number one crisis that this world is
[41:00] facing today is the absence of a father.
[41:07] Oh my god. The absence of a father. And
[41:12] when I make mention of a father, I'm not
[41:15] talking about a daddy, right? I'm
[41:19] talking about a father. Hallelujah.
[41:23] Not all males are father.
[41:26] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Not all males
[41:30] are father. Some males are just
[41:33] considered as sperm donor.
[41:37] But a father is someone. Hallelujah.
[41:40] that the word father comes from the
[41:43] Hebrew word abba right glory to god and
[41:47] the word abba mean source
[41:50] and what is a source a source is a place
[41:54] or person or thing or thing from which
[41:57] something comes comes out of or can be
[42:01] obtained
[42:02] and we see hallelujah when god placed
[42:06] the man in the garden hallelujah whom
[42:10] woman come out of the man. So the man
[42:13] was the foundation of the woman.
[42:17] The man was the source the of the woman.
[42:21] That's why brother Paul said in first
[42:23] Corinthians uh 1 Corinthians chapter I
[42:26] believe verse 9 he said hallelujah that
[42:30] the man is not of the woman but the
[42:33] woman is of the man.
[42:36] Hallelujah.
[42:37] Because a woman come out of the man.
[42:41] Glory to God. But we see we just to
[42:45] understand something here. Hallelujah.
[42:48] The male does not come from God. The
[42:52] male comes from the hurt. It is the man
[42:55] that come from God. The Bible said in in
[42:59] Genesis chapter one, "And God created
[43:03] man in his image." Hallelujah.
[43:06] Hallelujah. And the Bible said it said
[43:09] in John 4:4,
[43:11] God is a spirit and they that worship
[43:14] him must worship him in spirit and in
[43:18] truth.
[43:19] Hallelujah. So the man come from the
[43:22] hurt. In Genesis 2, God placed the man.
[43:27] The man was the spirit and God placed
[43:31] him on the hurt and the Bible said God
[43:35] formed him from the dust of the hurt and
[43:39] breathe into his nostrils the breath of
[43:42] life.
[43:44] Hallelujah.
[43:46] I'm going somewhere with this now.
[43:48] Hallelujah. The breath of life. And the
[43:51] man became a living soul.
[43:55] Hallelujah.
[43:57] So when we talk about so the male is the
[44:00] foundation of the woman but while he was
[44:04] there something was in him a mystery was
[44:07] in him when God formed him from the dust
[44:10] of the earth. Hallelujah. Something was
[44:13] in him also. Hallelujah. There was a
[44:16] female inside of him. But it was a
[44:20] mystery. Hallelujah.
[44:23] And the Bible said oh glory. The prophet
[44:26] said he could not have fellowship.
[44:28] Right? Hallelujah. Because it was
[44:30] hidden. Right? And the Bible said Adam
[44:34] saw all the animals that were male and
[44:38] female and there was no meat for the
[44:41] man.
[44:43] And the Bible said, hallelujah. And God
[44:46] saw that he was lonely.
[44:50] And the God said, I will make an help me
[44:53] for Adam. Right.
[44:55] And the Bible said he caused a deep
[44:58] sleep upon Adam. And while Adam was
[45:02] sweeping, the first surgeon ever
[45:05] mentioned was God.
[45:07] And he perform a surgery.
[45:11] And he took the female part out of Adam.
[45:15] And he made the woman. And he brought
[45:18] the woman to Adam. And Adam looked at
[45:21] her and said, "You are bone of my bone
[45:25] and flesh of my flesh. You shall be
[45:28] called woman." That means the womb of
[45:31] man.
[45:35] Hallelujah.
[45:37] Glory to God. So here God, Hallelujah.
[45:43] when he said to Abraham, I will made a
[45:47] covenant with you. Hallelujah. Abraham
[45:50] was exalted father. Hallelujah. And God
[45:55] want to start a nation. Every time when
[45:58] God wants to start a nation, it will go
[46:01] to the male.
[46:02] Hallelujah. We must understand, oh God,
[46:06] work. Hallelujah. When and the bad said
[46:10] in Genesis chapter 12, he said, "Come
[46:13] out of your kindred. Come out of your
[46:16] people, your nations, and your tongues,
[46:19] and I'm going to show you a land." God
[46:22] was separating Abraham from his kindred.
[46:26] Hallelujah. And when Abraham came out of
[46:30] his kindred, hallelujah. The Bible said
[46:33] in Genesis 15, Abraham's looked at God
[46:38] one day and said, "God, I am no son of
[46:41] my home,
[46:42] all everyone that is born in my house."
[46:45] Hallelujah. He said, "It's not my does
[46:48] that come out of my bowel, God said, I
[46:50] am your exceeding reward. What will you
[46:53] give me?" See, I go childish.
[46:56] God said, "I'm going to give you a son."
[46:58] Right? Hallelujah.
[47:01] He said, "I'm going to I'm going to
[47:03] multiply your seed." But in Genesis 12,
[47:06] he said, "I will bless you. I will make
[47:08] you a father of many nations." Thank
[47:12] you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[47:14] Glory to God. And the Bible said in
[47:18] Genesis 16, Abraham was 75 years old
[47:22] when God made him the promise.
[47:25] And then 11 years after, 10 years after
[47:29] when he was 85,
[47:31] Sarah came to him and said,"Abraham, I
[47:34] know that I've seen how you react. I
[47:37] know that you're depressed, seeing that
[47:39] I cannot give you any child." This is in
[47:41] my own words. Hallelujah. He said, "Here
[47:44] is my maidar going unto her." And when
[47:48] he was 86,
[47:50] Aar bear a son. All right. God said to
[47:55] Abram, "That's not the promise I gave. I
[47:58] promise you." But in Genesis 17, glory
[48:02] to God.
[48:04] Hallelujah. In Genesis 17, 13 years
[48:09] later. Hallelujah. Because he was 86
[48:12] when Aar gave birth to him. So 86 + 13
[48:17] is equal to 99.
[48:20] God said, Hallelujah. God appeared and
[48:23] said, "Hallelujah. I am the Almighty."
[48:27] Amen. Walk before me and be no perfect.
[48:32] This word perfect is not to say it's not
[48:35] saying to Abraham that you are sinless.
[48:39] Hallelujah. Because man, every man that
[48:42] is born is born in sin and shaped in
[48:46] iniquity. What God was simply saying to
[48:48] Abraham, be complete. be whole. Have a
[48:53] full relationship with me. He said, "Let
[48:57] your actions align with my will."
[49:01] Because, hallelujah. It wasn't God's
[49:04] will for Abraham, Hallelujah, to get
[49:06] Ishmael. It was man's will.
[49:10] Amen. Hallelujah. So, oh, you know that
[49:13] you're walking before God when your will
[49:16] Hallelujah. When your action is is
[49:18] aligning with his will.
[49:21] Hallelujah.
[49:23] When your action is aligning with his
[49:25] will, you know that you're walking with
[49:27] him. Amen. But if your action is not
[49:29] aligning with the will of God, you're
[49:32] not walking with him. That's right. The
[49:34] prophet said, hallelujah. The word
[49:38] statement, hallelujah, walk with God.
[49:41] The prophet said, this statement means a
[49:43] life fully of faith.
[49:47] Hallelujah. A life full of faith. He
[49:50] said Enoch
[49:52] walked with God. Hallelujah. And he was
[49:55] not found because God took him. Right.
[49:59] He said that walk was a life full of
[50:02] faith. Hallelujah.
[50:05] Hallelujah.
[50:06] So your walking has to be a relationship
[50:10] with God. Hallelujah. Because God
[50:14] Hallelujah. God loves when his people is
[50:16] in a relationship.
[50:18] Hallelujah. And here when we understand
[50:23] about the father,
[50:25] when we look in our society and see the
[50:29] father, the absence of the father is not
[50:32] in the home. It's not in our community.
[50:37] It is not even hallelujah in the school.
[50:41] Hallelujah. It's is the number one
[50:43] crisis upon the earth today.
[50:47] But when we understand the role of a
[50:49] perfect father, God who is our heavenly
[50:52] father, he shows us what the role must
[50:56] be. And the Bible said he leave an
[51:00] example for us to follow. So do you want
[51:04] or can a man know a perfect father when
[51:08] you watch when you study the life of
[51:11] Christ?
[51:13] Hallelujah. Because the son, oh glory,
[51:16] the son duplicate the father's action.
[51:21] Hallelujah. The son duplicate the
[51:23] father's character.
[51:26] Hallelujah. And Jesus Christ who was a
[51:29] son of the living God,
[51:32] he said, hallelujah, my fathers, my
[51:36] father work and I work here too.
[51:41] A true father always work.
[51:45] Hallelujah.
[51:47] A true father, glory to God, he paved
[51:50] the way for his son. Hallelujah.
[51:54] And when you look at this, this is very
[51:57] interesting.
[51:58] You know that a lazy father can produce
[52:00] lazy children, right?
[52:04] Fathers be careful.
[52:07] Your your children is watching you. They
[52:11] are watching every move. If you're a
[52:13] complaining father, your children is
[52:16] going to be complain.
[52:20] Oh, if you're a lying father, you're
[52:23] going to have lying children.
[52:26] Did not Jesus tell them you of your
[52:28] father the devils? He was a father of
[52:31] lies.
[52:34] Am I preaching the Bible? Hallelujah.
[52:38] So we have to be careful as a father.
[52:42] And here the word complete,
[52:45] the word perfect, it means complete.
[52:48] Hallelujah. It signifies a complete and
[52:53] a and and and undivided devotion to God,
[52:57] a wholeness of character and a
[53:00] commitment to living to God's will.
[53:04] Hallelujah. Amen. So that's why God had
[53:07] to change his name from Abram to Abraham
[53:12] because God made a promise in Genesis 12
[53:16] that he should be a father of many
[53:19] nations.
[53:21] Hallelujah. And when God made that
[53:24] promise, God want to see a nation that
[53:27] is carrying his character, that is
[53:29] producing his character, reflecting him
[53:33] upon the hurt. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[53:36] why God always starts from the male,
[53:39] right? Why you think why you think the
[53:42] male was considered hallelujah to as a
[53:45] high priest of the family?
[53:48] It was God's doing. He was the one that
[53:51] chose the male to be the high priest.
[53:54] The purpose of the the purpose of the
[53:56] priest, hallelujah, is to hallelujah, is
[53:59] to carry the the the the the prayers of
[54:02] the family to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[54:05] They were carrying the birthright.
[54:08] Hallelujah.
[54:10] The fathers was responsible. Hallelujah.
[54:13] To live a life that reflects God. That's
[54:17] why the only commandment in the Bible
[54:20] that have a promise attached to it is
[54:23] honor thy father.
[54:27] Did you hear me? Did you hear what I
[54:29] said?
[54:31] The only commandment in the Bible that
[54:34] had a promise attached to it was honor
[54:37] thy father. Amen. Let's find it in the
[54:41] Bible.
[54:42] Hallelujah.
[54:45] Glory to God.
[54:49] We're going to we're going to go into
[54:50] the word of God. Yes, sir. Because once
[54:53] it is in the word, we're going to find
[54:55] it.
[54:56] Hallelujah.
[54:58] You still love him? Amen.
[55:01] Amen.
[55:03] Genesis Exodus 20:12.
[55:10] Exodus 20:12.
[55:12] The word said, "Honor,
[55:16] honor thy father and thy mother
[55:21] that the days may be long upon the
[55:23] land." Right? Which the Lord thy God
[55:26] giveth thee. Amen. So if you do not
[55:29] honor, your days will not be long. So
[55:33] this is the first commandment.
[55:36] Hallelujah. That had a promise attached
[55:39] to it. Honor your father. Glory to God.
[55:44] Hallelujah.
[55:47] A father is a position.
[55:50] It's a function
[55:53] and not a name. Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen.
[55:59] The father is not the name of God.
[56:03] It's a function.
[56:06] The Bible said in James 1 verse 17, he's
[56:08] the father of lights. Meaning he's the
[56:12] source.
[56:14] Hallelujah. He create things. Creation
[56:17] came out of him. So you become the
[56:20] source. So when you are a father,
[56:23] hallelujah. Glory to God. You become the
[56:26] source. Your children come out of you.
[56:30] Hallelujah. You are their foundation.
[56:34] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[56:37] The word also father
[56:41] it comes with the word progenerator.
[56:45] The word pro r o means to support.
[56:49] Right.
[56:51] Gen generator comes from the word
[56:55] genetics.
[56:56] Hallelujah. Meaning the genes. Glory to
[57:00] God. That's why when Jesus spoke to the
[57:04] Hallelujah the Jews there hallelujah. He
[57:07] was chasing their DNA when he said you
[57:10] are your father the devil. Right.
[57:15] Hallelujah.
[57:16] Glory to God. Oh, praise God. So the
[57:21] rose of a perfect father. Hallelujah.
[57:27] When God said to Abraham,
[57:30] you shall be the father of many nation.
[57:34] It means hallelujah. Those nations, oh
[57:37] glory to God, you are their source.
[57:41] Those nation come out of you.
[57:44] Hallelujah.
[57:45] So that's why God could able to look and
[57:48] said, "Hallelujah. Not all sons are of
[57:52] Abraham.
[57:54] You're not all of the promise."
[57:57] Hallelujah.
[57:59] Glory to God. Because there are some
[58:01] people, some sons, hallelujah, they came
[58:05] from Abraham and not Abraham.
[58:08] Ishmael came from Abraham. Hallelujah.
[58:12] But Isaac came from Abraham.
[58:16] Hallelujah.
[58:17] That's why I said you're not all of the
[58:20] promise.
[58:21] When they said Abraham is our father
[58:25] and we're never yet in bondage.
[58:28] Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I know, but
[58:31] you're not of the promise."
[58:33] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[58:37] Glory to God. Amen.
[58:40] In the book of Matthew
[58:44] 5 verse 48
[58:46] Jesus said hallelujah
[58:50] be therefore perfect
[58:54] even as your father
[58:57] which is in heaven is perfect.
[59:00] And as we establish this perfect is not
[59:03] meaning sinless.
[59:06] It means to be complete. Right. Amen.
[59:09] Having a relationship with God.
[59:13] Hallelujah.
[59:17] A being a father is not about a male
[59:21] but of a position.
[59:24] Hallelujah.
[59:26] A lot of persons they misunderstand
[59:30] or they don't know to be a father.
[59:33] That's why brother Dale I'm disappointed
[59:36] in some of the the females them they are
[59:41] expecting too much from a male.
[59:45] Hallelujah.
[59:46] You know when you look across in all the
[59:50] world and see what is happening right
[59:53] and when you listen to people's stories
[59:56] and so forth and you listen to their
[59:59] background and their history and where
[1:00:01] they came from and they're giving their
[1:00:03] report that the family that they come
[1:00:05] from the the father was absent.
[1:00:08] Hallelujah. But you know I'm a little
[1:00:11] bit disappointed because I believe that
[1:00:13] some of the problem the female help to
[1:00:16] cause some of the problem. Why I say
[1:00:19] that is they are expecting too much from
[1:00:22] the male and they don't have it in them
[1:00:25] to give it.
[1:00:29] Let me use let me use uh this as an
[1:00:33] illustration.
[1:00:34] If you plant a corn,
[1:00:37] what are you expecting to reap?
[1:00:41] Tell me, answer the question. Corn. But
[1:00:45] persons plant corn and they expect
[1:00:47] peace. It doesn't work that way. When
[1:00:51] you plant a corn, you must expect to
[1:00:54] reap a corn.
[1:00:58] That's why when you take back the word,
[1:01:01] we have to take the word as it is.
[1:01:03] Right. Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] So when you get a real father from God,
[1:01:08] right? You're going to get a real father
[1:01:11] in your life. Amen.
[1:01:13] But if that doesn't come from God, you
[1:01:15] cannot expect the person to perform
[1:01:18] hallelujah the support role.
[1:01:21] The person may perform the financial
[1:01:24] part but not the support role.
[1:01:29] Oh Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:35] It's the position.
[1:01:38] Glory to God.
[1:01:41] Hallelujah.
[1:01:44] The man,
[1:01:46] he was made out of the soil,
[1:01:50] but the man was created in the image of
[1:01:53] God.
[1:01:54] Hallelujah. And even in today, males
[1:01:59] have lost their identity.
[1:02:02] They don't know who they are.
[1:02:05] But when you're in Christ, you know your
[1:02:08] identity. You know who you are. You know
[1:02:12] what is your role, what is expected of
[1:02:15] you. You know that as a father, you must
[1:02:18] function in that position.
[1:02:22] You must be a support for the family.
[1:02:25] You must uphold the family. Hallelujah.
[1:02:29] You are the source of the family. You
[1:02:32] are the provider for the family. You are
[1:02:35] the defender for the family.
[1:02:39] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:02:43] And Abraham and Abraham plays that
[1:02:46] perfect role in the life of Isaac.
[1:02:52] Hallelujah.
[1:02:54] in so much that when Isaac was a little
[1:02:57] boy, you know who was his role model?
[1:03:01] His role model was Abraham.
[1:03:04] Amen. He watched his father Abraham.
[1:03:08] Hallelujah. He wanted He wanted
[1:03:11] Hallelujah to follow his father Abraham
[1:03:14] in everything that he was doing.
[1:03:17] Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] He he become the perfect mother.
[1:03:23] Hallelujah.
[1:03:26] When you're talking about the father,
[1:03:29] the meaning,
[1:03:31] you're talking about the quality.
[1:03:34] And quality is a standard of something
[1:03:37] as measure against other things.
[1:03:41] What perfect quality that we have of the
[1:03:44] father, our heavenly father.
[1:03:47] What is his standard? His character.
[1:03:50] Right. Hallelujah. His image is his
[1:03:54] standard. And when you take his
[1:03:56] character, nothing can measure to his
[1:03:59] character.
[1:04:01] Hallelujah. Nothing can measure to it.
[1:04:04] Hallelujah. Praise God. No wonder why he
[1:04:09] said if hurt fails you,
[1:04:13] if earth hurt fails you, you need to go
[1:04:16] to heaven. Hallelujah. Because earth was
[1:04:20] made with the subject of weaknesses.
[1:04:24] Hallelujah. Earth is weak but heaven
[1:04:28] cannot weak. Hallelujah. Heaven is
[1:04:31] strength and power and glory. That's why
[1:04:34] he said be perfect as your father in
[1:04:38] heaven is perfect. Amen. Not your father
[1:04:42] on the earth but your father in heaven.
[1:04:46] Because earth is a weakness.
[1:04:49] Hallelujah.
[1:04:51] And earth will fail. But heaven cannot
[1:04:55] fail.
[1:04:57] Heaven must be our role model. It must
[1:05:01] be our example.
[1:05:04] Jesus.
[1:05:05] Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] Glory to God. Amen. I wonder why when
[1:05:12] Jesus he said if the earthly father know
[1:05:16] to give good gifts to their children,
[1:05:18] how much more the heavenly father?
[1:05:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:25] Oh, praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:05:32] What what a wonderful father we have.
[1:05:37] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:39] The Bible said, "Children, obey your
[1:05:44] parents in all things."
[1:05:48] So, everybody's getting it. Children is
[1:05:51] getting it, mothers is getting it,
[1:05:54] father is getting it, wives is getting
[1:05:56] it. It's a message for everybody. Amen.
[1:06:00] Amen.
[1:06:02] Hallelujah.
[1:06:04] You come to the right place.
[1:06:08] Children,
[1:06:10] obey your parents
[1:06:13] in all things.
[1:06:16] Because when you obey your parents in
[1:06:18] all things, this is well pleasing.
[1:06:22] Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] It is well pleasing unto the Lord.
[1:06:29] The word honor, it means regard with
[1:06:32] great respect.
[1:06:35] It means reverence.
[1:06:37] It means admire.
[1:06:40] It means look up to. It means appreciate
[1:06:45] value.
[1:06:46] Sometimes
[1:06:48] children doesn't value their godly
[1:06:51] parents.
[1:06:53] Sometimes they don't appreciate their
[1:06:56] godly parents as much as they ought to.
[1:06:59] Amen. And I when I look at these things
[1:07:04] I said they are so blessed that they
[1:07:05] don't even realize it.
[1:07:08] Many person doesn't have get that
[1:07:11] chance. Hallelujah. To grow up with a
[1:07:14] godly parents.
[1:07:16] True. My father I've been absent in all
[1:07:20] my life. Oh wow. I didn't grow up with a
[1:07:23] father. Wow. Hallelujah. And
[1:07:28] God was so merciful to me even when I'm
[1:07:32] at school, brother Jim, and when I see I
[1:07:34] see other children of their father and I
[1:07:37] love to play sports, right? I play
[1:07:39] football and cricket. Well, you call
[1:07:42] football soccer. Well, and I don't see
[1:07:45] my father bringing come to a game
[1:07:48] because he was never around, right?
[1:07:50] you know, and I said, "God, I didn't
[1:07:53] know God then, but you know what?
[1:07:56] Something was in my heart that was
[1:07:58] pulling me to him." Hallelujah. from I
[1:08:01] was a little boy. I always when when I
[1:08:04] was a little boy, we used to have this
[1:08:05] coffee coffee tree. Yeah. You know, we
[1:08:08] plant coffee in Jamaica in the garden
[1:08:11] and you know and bananas around and I
[1:08:14] find myself preaching, you know, to show
[1:08:17] you the hand of God has been on my life
[1:08:20] a little boy and I didn't even fully
[1:08:23] understand it. I did not understand it
[1:08:25] to be honest. Hallelujah. you know, and
[1:08:29] I I was preaching to the banana tree,
[1:08:32] right? You know, the birds was flying,
[1:08:35] all of that, you know, and I remember I
[1:08:40] remember somebody said to me that, you
[1:08:42] know, God is calling you to preach.
[1:08:45] And I said,
[1:08:49] you know, I just shake that off, you
[1:08:51] know. And then somebody say, you know,
[1:08:52] when you grow up, you're going to become
[1:08:54] a great father. I just shake that off.
[1:08:56] But now I'm understanding.
[1:08:59] Hallelujah. When you receive the spirit
[1:09:01] of God upon your life, you can't be the
[1:09:05] same. You got to go into a difference
[1:09:08] into a difference mood because you want
[1:09:11] to reflect Christ. You want to produce
[1:09:14] Christ. And if you're producing Christ,
[1:09:17] you're going to produce it in your
[1:09:18] children. Amen.
[1:09:21] Hallelujah.
[1:09:23] No wonder why the Bible say in Hosea
[1:09:25] 4:6, "My people are destroyed because of
[1:09:29] lack of knowledge."
[1:09:32] And did you know that when you read the
[1:09:35] scripture further on down, it said, "And
[1:09:37] your children will be destroyed."
[1:09:40] Oh Jesus.
[1:09:44] Your children will be destroyed.
[1:09:46] So it come back down to the father,
[1:09:49] right?
[1:09:50] You have to be a role model. You have to
[1:09:54] be a source for your children. You have
[1:09:57] to be a provider for your children. You
[1:10:00] have to be the light for your children.
[1:10:03] You have to be the way for your
[1:10:05] children. You have to be the truth for
[1:10:07] your children. Amen.
[1:10:10] Jesus.
[1:10:11] Hallelujah.
[1:10:13] You have to be the truth.
[1:10:16] Jesus said, "I am the truth.
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:20] Amen. I am the truth, the way, and the
[1:10:24] life.
[1:10:26] Jesus. Hallelujah. Some children don't
[1:10:29] know no true worship.
[1:10:31] They don't even know how to build an
[1:10:33] altar.
[1:10:35] Why you think God Why you think God make
[1:10:37] made the male priest of the family to
[1:10:40] show them how to build an altar? To show
[1:10:43] them how to hallelujah to worship. Amen.
[1:10:46] Jesus.
[1:10:48] Hallelujah.
[1:10:50] Glory to God. It's on you fathers.
[1:10:55] You have a responsibility.
[1:10:57] You have a duty to God. Hallelujah. And
[1:11:02] the role of a perfect father. The Bible
[1:11:05] said
[1:11:07] a good man leave inheritance for his
[1:11:10] children. Children.
[1:11:13] You believe in the Bible. You believe in
[1:11:15] the Bible.
[1:11:17] The Bible said, "A good man leaves
[1:11:19] inheritance for his children." Children,
[1:11:23] oh my God, see this Bible, I believe in
[1:11:27] it. I believe in everything. A good man
[1:11:32] leaves inheritance for his children.
[1:11:34] Children,
[1:11:37] yes, sir. We said that we're reflecting
[1:11:39] God. What did God leave for us?
[1:11:42] [Laughter]
[1:11:45] Hallelujah.
[1:11:46] We got to find what God leave for us.
[1:11:50] Hallelujah.
[1:11:52] Let us turn our Bibles to the book of
[1:11:54] St. Luke.
[1:11:57] Oh, praise the Lord. St. Luke 12:32.
[1:12:10] Hallelujah. Can I talk to you saints?
[1:12:14] Fear not. Right. Can I talk to you? Fear
[1:12:17] not.
[1:12:19] Fear not, little flock. Jesus. For it is
[1:12:24] your father's good pleasure
[1:12:28] to give you the kingdom. Hallelujah.
[1:12:32] Jesus. You heard that?
[1:12:35] Fear not, little flock. Why fear is
[1:12:38] taking over?
[1:12:40] It is the father's good pleasure to give
[1:12:43] you the kingdom. The kingdom is God's
[1:12:46] heritage.
[1:12:50] A good man leaves inheritance for his
[1:12:53] children.
[1:12:55] Hallelujah.
[1:12:57] And here Jesus said, hallelujah. It is
[1:13:00] the father's pleasure. It it the it is
[1:13:04] pleasure the father so much to give you
[1:13:07] the kingdom. But do not fear. Because
[1:13:10] fear is a demon. Hallelujah. Rise above
[1:13:14] your fears. Rise above your doubts. And
[1:13:17] take full control of the kingdom because
[1:13:20] God has given you it.
[1:13:23] Hallelujah.
[1:13:26] Glory to God.
[1:13:29] God has given you it. It is yours.
[1:13:32] Mighty God. Hallelujah. It is yours.
[1:13:37] Praise God. Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:13:42] You know one other thing
[1:13:45] brother Paul in the book of Ephesians 5
[1:13:49] he said
[1:13:51] be ye therefore followers of God as
[1:13:56] their children. Wow. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:14:00] God. It is important to have hallelujah
[1:14:04] a role model in our life. It is
[1:14:07] important
[1:14:08] and we see hallelujah when you take on
[1:14:12] the father characteristics
[1:14:14] you're becoming a role model
[1:14:17] not just for your children brother Jared
[1:14:20] but for the children of the world.
[1:14:24] Hallelujah. Sometimes we think that our
[1:14:27] duty is only to our children but it is
[1:14:30] not just to our children. Glory to God.
[1:14:32] You must be a father of your nation.
[1:14:36] You must be a father of your society,
[1:14:39] your communities.
[1:14:41] Glory to God. Hallelujah. You know
[1:14:44] sometimes as I said, hallelujah, my
[1:14:47] father was absent in my life. But when I
[1:14:50] see a good father, I used to say, I wish
[1:14:52] I had a father like him.
[1:14:55] That person was was being a father to me
[1:14:58] without him knowing it. or if he knows
[1:15:00] it. Probably I didn't tell him.
[1:15:02] Hallelujah. But there was something
[1:15:04] inside of me said that's a true father.
[1:15:08] That's what a true father must be. I
[1:15:11] used to look into that.
[1:15:15] Hallelujah.
[1:15:17] When you look
[1:15:20] another thing
[1:15:23] when the perfect the perfect role of a
[1:15:26] father is when the father can trust you.
[1:15:32] When the father can trust you, right?
[1:15:34] And when the father trust you, trust
[1:15:37] works on both way. Both ways. If I trust
[1:15:40] you, I must can trust you. You must can
[1:15:43] trust me. It must work on both ways.
[1:15:46] Amen. You believe that? Amen.
[1:15:48] Hallelujah. Oh, praise God. If God
[1:15:52] trusts you, you must trust God.
[1:15:57] We're going to look at Jesus for
[1:15:59] example. Hallelujah. Jesus, hallelujah,
[1:16:02] he reflect the father's character.
[1:16:05] Right. The Bible said in Luke 23, I
[1:16:08] believe verse 46, the Bible said, Jesus
[1:16:12] said, "In thine hands have I commit my
[1:16:18] spirit in your hands." Jesus.
[1:16:21] Hallelujah. Sometimes look at what Jesus
[1:16:25] did. He command he commit his spirit in
[1:16:28] the fathers and meaning he trusts him.
[1:16:32] Jesus. And sometimes even with our
[1:16:35] little finances, we can't even trust
[1:16:37] God.
[1:16:40] Not even with our little time, brother
[1:16:42] Dave. We can't even trust God with our
[1:16:45] time. Jesus. Am I preaching to somebody
[1:16:49] today? Hallelujah. We even want sometime
[1:16:52] God's need our time and we can't even
[1:16:56] trust him with our time.
[1:16:58] Jesus my God. Hallelujah.
[1:17:02] Glory to God. And Jesus said in thine
[1:17:05] hands have I commit my spirit. Meaning
[1:17:09] he trust the father. Hallelujah. And we
[1:17:13] must able to trust the father with our
[1:17:15] time, with our self, with our mind, with
[1:17:20] our spirit,
[1:17:21] with all our resources.
[1:17:24] Jesus.
[1:17:26] Did not the Bible say do not leave
[1:17:28] treasure on earth. Right? But let it be
[1:17:31] in heaven. That's right.
[1:17:34] But we rather to put it down on earth
[1:17:36] than in heaven.
[1:17:38] When you do that on earth, that mean you
[1:17:40] don't trust him.
[1:17:43] Hallelujah.
[1:17:45] Meaning you don't trust him. And here
[1:17:48] we're going to see where the father
[1:17:50] trust Jesus.
[1:17:54] Oh, John five.
[1:17:57] You still with me? Amen.
[1:18:00] John 5:36.
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:04] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:18:14] Before you reach to John 5:36, let us
[1:18:16] turn to John 3:34 first. I think that's
[1:18:19] the scripture I want to get at first.
[1:18:22] St. John 3 verse 34.
[1:18:37] The Bible said here, hallelujah. Praise
[1:18:42] God.
[1:18:44] That for he whom God had sent speaketh
[1:18:48] the words of God. For God giveth not the
[1:18:51] spirit by measure unto him. So when the
[1:18:54] father came,
[1:18:57] he speak the things of the father. When
[1:18:59] the son
[1:19:01] When the son came, he speak the things
[1:19:04] of the father. He is carrying out the
[1:19:07] vision of the father is carrying out the
[1:19:11] purpose of the father.
[1:19:13] Jesus my god. Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] John 5:36.
[1:19:20] Amen. Thank you.
[1:19:25] But I have a greater witness than that
[1:19:28] of John. For the works which the father
[1:19:32] given me to finish the same works that I
[1:19:36] do bear witness of me that I had.
[1:19:41] Hallelujah. That the father had sent me.
[1:19:45] Jesus my God.
[1:19:49] If the father can send the son that mean
[1:19:52] the father trusts the son.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah. The father has complete
[1:19:59] trust in his son. Glory to God.
[1:20:03] Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] Complete trust. Yeah.
[1:20:08] Like for example, you know, if I should
[1:20:11] use an illustration,
[1:20:13] you know, if I should say, "Brother
[1:20:15] Gerard, I know that you will not take
[1:20:18] your keys and give to Curtis."
[1:20:24] Why?
[1:20:26] Because he don't reach the age of
[1:20:28] complete trust yet. He will not trust
[1:20:31] him with the keys. Right.
[1:20:34] But if he could give Matthew,
[1:20:37] he would trust him.
[1:20:40] Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] You see, that's why when you talk about
[1:20:46] maturity and growth, right? We have to
[1:20:49] reach a whereby the father can
[1:20:52] completely trust us. Amen.
[1:20:57] Hallelujah.
[1:20:59] You think Peter had to reach to the
[1:21:01] stage whereby Christ have to trust him
[1:21:04] with the keys of the kingdom of heaven?
[1:21:09] Hallelujah.
[1:21:11] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:21:16] You know,
[1:21:21] Hallelujah. When we look also
[1:21:26] at the the the parables that spoke about
[1:21:29] the parable son
[1:21:32] about the prodical son the parable right
[1:21:35] in Luke chapter 15 right we heard many
[1:21:40] times we heard that story many times we
[1:21:43] heard preachers preach over it many
[1:21:45] times
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:49] and
