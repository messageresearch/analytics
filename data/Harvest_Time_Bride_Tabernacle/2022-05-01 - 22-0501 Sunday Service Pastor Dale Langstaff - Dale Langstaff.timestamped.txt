[29:18] it's just a
[29:19] just an amazing scripture here and you

[29:23] so many ways with this you could preach
[29:25] for the rest of time and this and
[29:29] i really uh
[29:30] i thought it was going to be two
[29:32] messages and then god kind of put it
[29:34] into one message
[29:35] and then i just had a lot of different
[29:38] confirmations
[29:40] even up to this morning
[29:42] and it was just
[29:44] really
[29:45] really fantastic
[29:48] what god is amen and what he wants to
[29:51] show you
[29:53] this morning and in the next
[29:56] few days amen i really want to stress
[29:58] before i start you know
[30:00] we are not
[30:02] a religion
[30:04] this
[30:05] is not a religion of any kind
[30:10] this
[30:11] is a family
[30:13] or a love affair
[30:16] both
[30:17] completely
[30:18] god knew you
[30:20] before
[30:21] you knew yourself
[30:23] there's no chance
[30:25] nothing is by
[30:26] perchance i want to just to lay a
[30:29] foundation i want to read just a couple
[30:31] other scriptures galatians 2 and 20
[30:35] just to uh
[30:37] show you some of the thoughts of god and
[30:39] then just dive into this
[30:41] you know galatians 2 and 20. i am
[30:43] crucified with christ nevertheless i
[30:46] live
[30:47] but if you were crucified you're dead
[30:50] yet
[30:51] not i but christ liveth in me
[30:54] and the life which i now live in the
[30:56] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[30:59] god who loved me and gave
[31:02] himself for me let's go to romans
[31:06] along the same line romans 14 and 8 and
[31:09] this will lay
[31:10] our foundation
[31:14] for whether we live
[31:17] we live unto the lord and whether we die
[31:21] we die unto the lord
[31:23] and whether we live therefore or we die
[31:27] we are the lords
[31:29] that pretty much takes care of fear
[31:34] amen that pretty much takes care now we
[31:36] know believers can't die
[31:39] because you've already died
[31:41] to be a believer you must have died but
[31:44] i want to show you and this was one of
[31:46] the confirmations that came to me you
[31:48] know the prophet had a picture
[31:52] of
[31:52] of you know a bunch of lights and he was
[31:55] kind of in the background preaching and
[31:56] there's a lot of lights in the picture
[31:59] and i've seen the picture multiple times
[32:01] it's i like a picture of somebody
[32:04] theophany or somebody
[32:06] before they die
[32:08] i'm sure i'm sure you've all seen it and
[32:10] i could actually i might even next
[32:11] suddenly show the video amen
[32:15] but in this picture and in this video
[32:18] brother branham tells perry green he
[32:20] says do you see the picture of the man's
[32:23] face
[32:24] behind me
[32:27] matt anybody heard that amen and he says
[32:30] i i hadn't heard it maybe ever for a
[32:32] long long time
[32:33] and he says
[32:35] he brother perry says he says yes he
[32:37] said i see it now
[32:39] he said now that you mentioned it and
[32:40] brother brown said he said now that's
[32:43] my old man
[32:51] and he said he looks like
[32:54] an indian
[32:57] and he said the reason he looks like an
[32:59] indian
[33:00] was because my grandma
[33:02] was an indian
[33:04] now watch what he says
[33:06] and he shows perry with his hands he
[33:08] says now when the holy spirit god
[33:11] comes and tabernacled into me
[33:15] my old man
[33:17] leaves me
[33:19] and he's behind me
[33:21] watch us
[33:23] i want you to catch us
[33:26] he has no power
[33:29] but he negs on me
[33:32] daily
[33:41] when you have those thoughts that i'm
[33:42] going to do something that's off the
[33:44] word
[33:46] that's your old man
[33:48] you're still a believer
[33:49] you're tabernacle
[33:51] but he
[33:55] paul said i die
[33:57] daily
[34:00] but the prophet said
[34:02] he's there
[34:04] he has no power
[34:07] so you know we have to be so careful in
[34:09] this this journey that we go with
[34:12] you
[34:13] now by that vision and i can show you
[34:16] that video there's a video
[34:19] of it
[34:20] in that
[34:23] you can be a believer now i'm not
[34:25] preaching sin you know that you know
[34:26] that i'm not preaching that
[34:28] but
[34:29] your flesh ain't perfect
[34:31] now it will get perfect it will it will
[34:35] it will get
[34:36] as perfect as it you know it's a journey
[34:40] but from the time you believe
[34:44] and christ comes into you he accepts
[34:46] your belief
[34:47] you're a believer
[34:50] but your body
[34:52] falls down
[34:55] or can't
[34:59] let me tell you that let me tell you now
[35:01] watch this keep this in your mind you
[35:03] are
[35:04] you are
[35:07] god's vision
[35:09] but so was rahab
[35:12] but she was a prostitute
[35:20] now i didn't say god made her a
[35:22] prostitute
[35:24] but that was her own nature
[35:28] and as she
[35:29] matures
[35:31] it got laid down
[35:33] you say well you don't have to brother
[35:34] dale you're going out on a limb hey when
[35:36] the when the spies went to rahab
[35:39] she said what'd she say she said our
[35:41] hearts burned
[35:45] she's still a full-fledged prostitute
[35:48] she's our hearts i think the bible says
[35:51] by hearing you know faith comes by
[35:52] hearing she said when we heard
[35:56] i'm a prostitute when we heard
[36:00] our hearts were whoa
[36:07] whoa
[36:10] so so watch us now a religious christian
[36:14] say oh bless god i was never a
[36:16] prostitute
[36:18] bless god i never went to that blessed
[36:20] god
[36:21] dirty house
[36:23] bless god
[36:25] i'll tell you she's
[36:27] oh god
[36:31] there's another lady like that in the
[36:32] bible too
[36:34] and god said
[36:36] he had an appointment with her
[36:40] all right so adjourns goodbye
[36:45] so
[36:48] judge not unless you
[36:51] be judged
[36:54] you could be no i'm not saying
[36:58] to sin i'm not saying that's a ticket
[37:00] sin
[37:01] but i'm saying you can be baptized with
[37:03] the holy ghost
[37:05] and your old nature
[37:07] is nagging you
[37:11] that's it's nagging you
[37:13] it might take you a couple days to lay
[37:15] down
[37:17] a sin now god will help you and you'll
[37:20] do it because because the bible says
[37:23] this body
[37:24] will come in subjection but it might not
[37:26] be like blitz lightning
[37:33] that's why we're still here
[37:35] because if it was blitz lightning then
[37:36] you just go like enoch and you'd be
[37:38] raptured you wouldn't even have to wait
[37:40] till the general retro
[37:45] wow ain't that something
[37:47] see you know in this picture of love
[37:51] there's no fear
[37:53] in love
[37:54] you are as free
[37:57] as can be
[37:59] but you know
[38:00] when you look into this it's so
[38:02] beautiful
[38:04] the bible says
[38:05] that no man ever hateth
[38:08] himself
[38:11] amen
[38:13] and the bible then maybe we'll turn to
[38:15] that ephesians 5 29 30 and 32
[38:18] and god's talking here in ephesians 5
[38:21] about
[38:22] marriage and husbands what but it was it
[38:25] was really wasn't that at all
[38:29] you can use it for that
[38:32] but was actually the marriage
[38:34] of christ
[38:36] and his bride
[38:38] and that's why he says in chapter 32 he
[38:40] said this
[38:41] is a great mystery
[38:44] now when you look into that it says no
[38:47] man never ever hateth his own flesh
[38:49] but nourishes it
[38:51] and
[38:52] nourished it as even the lord does
[38:56] the church now watch us
[38:58] why did god
[39:00] nourish the bride or the church
[39:05] because we were his
[39:07] foundation because a piece of him god
[39:11] isn't completely god
[39:13] without you because he dropped the seed
[39:16] of him in you
[39:17] before the foundation of the world
[39:20] and we as members of oh
[39:24] this is just unbelievable
[39:28] of his body now i just got done telling
[39:30] you it was his body
[39:32] members of his body and his flesh
[39:37] and of his bones
[39:39] see god's saying you love yourself
[39:44] and god loved himself too
[39:47] and now
[39:49] not now but you were a part of god see
[39:51] you always were a part of god or you
[39:54] won't be there
[39:55] and so that's why it's such a i know
[39:57] this is
[39:58] and even brother steve watch even what
[40:00] brother steve preach touched on and it
[40:02] was
[40:03] i just it took me all week to get over
[40:06] the weekend it was just beautiful
[40:08] it was just amazing
[40:12] you know he talked about samson
[40:15] was god's prophets or prophets are born
[40:19] did he make a mistake oh he made a he
[40:22] made a really
[40:24] but where is he at the end of his life
[40:29] the old nature
[40:30] he was flirting with a
[40:32] girl
[40:34] the old nature
[40:36] but his hair still
[40:37] grew
[40:42] amen
[40:43] it's beautiful see it's oh bless god i
[40:46] never had trouble with swimming like
[40:47] samson did
[40:49] careful
[40:50] see you actually when you're saying that
[40:56] let's go back to this other scripture
[40:57] when you're saying that
[41:00] but we are part of god
[41:03] so when you see somebody
[41:06] attack
[41:09] a believer
[41:13] when you see
[41:14] message believers
[41:17] attack
[41:18] believers
[41:19] even make believers
[41:32] could have attacked samson
[41:35] could have attacked graham
[41:37] could have attacked the woman at the
[41:38] well
[41:40] could have attacked david
[41:43] could have attacked me
[41:46] and they could have attacked you
[41:50] would jesus say i love
[41:52] how jesus puts it he says don't be
[41:55] bothered that they're attacking you
[41:58] why they attack me
[42:02] they i talked to all the prophets
[42:05] before there was you
[42:10] he even tells us the different
[42:11] scriptures to be rejoiced and being said
[42:13] praise god they lied about me
[42:18] hallelujah
[42:22] [Music]
[42:25] because see god couldn't lie about god
[42:29] you say oh now this just
[42:32] who was the accuser of the brethren
[42:36] the brother and the bride who was an
[42:38] accuser of the bride let's look at that
[42:40] revelations
[42:42] revelations we have it here somewhere
[42:48] oh
[42:49] maybe i have it here
[42:56] revelations 12 and and uh
[43:00] 12
[43:02] while you're while you're pulling that
[43:03] up i want to read a quote
[43:05] 65 the invisible union
[43:08] of the bride of christ
[43:10] see you are living
[43:13] in god's vision
[43:15] and i get it next week i believe we're
[43:17] going to go into some of those visions
[43:19] that the prophet said said
[43:21] you want me to tell you what when you're
[43:23] predestinated
[43:26] and you're here and you're when you're
[43:28] rejoicing in the word
[43:30] nobody
[43:33] nobody
[43:35] can take your place
[43:38] absolutely
[43:40] nobody
[43:43] you are a part of god you came from god
[43:46] you're going back to god and there's
[43:48] that part of god that no that even god
[43:51] himself and the other part's gonna take
[43:53] your part
[43:55] my big toe never be my heart
[43:58] and my left ear will never be my right
[44:00] ear
[44:00] amen and my nose will never be my eyes
[44:03] she said well god don't need me bless
[44:06] god
[44:09] that's a lie from hell
[44:13] hallelujah
[44:15] here's the prophets talking about grain
[44:17] and ripening and i want to say this you
[44:19] know and he talks about that the grain
[44:21] will put all the life and emphasis into
[44:24] the the seed the the he's talking about
[44:26] the plant you know the wheat coming up
[44:28] or the grain coming up
[44:30] and the corn and i've seen that you know
[44:32] in times of drought especially
[44:34] especially in corn stocks you'll see
[44:36] that
[44:37] where when the corn is putting the cob
[44:39] out
[44:40] the corn is putting the cob out and you
[44:42] run into a dry season maybe late in
[44:44] august first of september
[44:47] and all the leaves on the bottom of the
[44:49] corn will die
[44:51] right up to the cob
[44:54] and that stock will empty every drop of
[44:56] moisture out of that stock
[44:59] to push the power
[45:01] into the kernel
[45:04] it'll die
[45:07] to save the colonel
[45:09] christ died to save the colonel
[45:14] it's just
[45:16] powerful
[45:17] it's just it's just amazing and he says
[45:20] so he said well you're separated from
[45:22] your first union and your spirit by
[45:25] spiritual death
[45:27] and you're born again and remarried
[45:28] again by a new spiritual union
[45:31] and it's your natural life and things of
[45:34] the world
[45:35] but of the eternal life that's the
[45:38] germ
[45:40] that's the key part that's the germ or g
[45:43] i'm sorry gene
[45:45] of god
[45:46] that was in you from the beginning

[46:21] union and your name and your old
[46:24] and it's been transfigured
[46:27] and you say what do you mean tell me
[46:28] about my old book you see god put it in
[46:30] the sea of his forgetfulness
[46:33] you
[46:35] with this old man behind here
[46:38] talking to you daily
[46:40] saying
[46:42] his lies
[46:44] are still perfect

[48:16] i didn't smoke
[48:19] he said but but but i'm going to forgive
[48:21] you he said
[48:23] you can't forgive me
[48:24] because i never did it
[48:28] and he said that's just like you
[48:32] the bride and christ
[48:35] wow
[48:36] you know you won't hear that
[48:38] at the corner church
[48:43] see
[48:44] god couldn't
[48:46] forgive you
[48:47] because the re because watch
[48:49] oh wow
[48:51] you came from god
[48:53] and god can't see sin
[48:55] he can't be sin so he can't forgive you
[48:59] because he knew you were him but he
[49:02] could redeem you from the pawnshop
[49:05] but it wasn't you that did it
[49:07] so he redeemed you and you're justified
[49:10] as if you never did it in the first and
[49:12] in god's thoughts
[49:14] you didn't smoke
[49:17] not the real you oh this nature from eve
[49:20] did
[49:21] and he's taking it from you
[49:24] or or looking at pictures or whatever it
[49:27] would be
[49:32] see god ain't getting that
[49:34] prostitute see see what god's marrying
[49:37] is a virtuous
[49:39] pure
[49:41] garmented with the word
[49:42] why royal seed
[49:45] of abraham
[49:47] and she never was touched by man's hands
[49:50] that's the germ that he put in you
[49:54] oh this might have made a mistake or two
[49:57] but god's looking at the film that he
[49:59] printed before this flesh was there
[50:02] because you were in the thoughts of god
[50:03] and he said all these wonderful people
[50:06] i'm going to just put up
[50:10] wow
[50:12] oh it's it's
[50:15] you won't get this is no
[50:17] great book

[50:23] and your knowing life is in the lamb's
[50:24] book of life your marriage certificate
[50:25] eternal gene from the beginning who
[50:27] takes hold he said now you're not
[50:30] he's oh here he says
[50:32] you're justified glory he said justifies
[50:35] romans 5 1.
[50:38] therefore in the beginning he said
[50:39] you're justified
[50:41] by faith
[50:43] hallelujah
[50:45] he actually says here he says you're not
[50:47] only forgiven but you're justified and
[50:49] then he corrects himself
[50:51] in the next page
[50:52] he said now when you look up the word
[50:56] the word don't mean
[50:57] forgiven so he watch watch this i want
[51:00] to i want to show you something
[51:02] for all the people that take every
[51:03] single word that the prophet
[51:05] he says now you're not only forgiven but
[51:07] you're justified glory justified like
[51:10] romans 5 1.
[51:11] the very next line
[51:14] look up the word
[51:15] the word don't mean forgiven
[51:18] so you're not forgiven
[51:20] the word means justified
[51:24] he says
[51:25] it don't mean same line it don't mean
[51:28] you're forgiven but he just said i was
[51:34] forgiven see
[51:39] for instance you heard that i i drunk
[51:42] got drunk and did some evil things and
[51:45] and all these other things and you come
[51:46] around to say you found out i didn't do
[51:48] them and he said well come around and
[51:49] say i forgive you
[51:51] to forgive me
[51:53] what are you you forgive me for what
[51:57] he says you can't forgive me
[51:59] i didn't even do them
[52:01] he says now if i didn't do them
[52:06] if now if watch this this is important
[52:09] he said now if i did do it i'm guilty
[52:14] but i
[52:16] but i could be forgiven
[52:19] and i wouldn't be guilty
[52:23] but yet i'm justified because i actually
[52:28] done it
[52:30] it's just see it was he said now if i
[52:34] did do it i'm guilty
[52:37] but you could be you could forgive me if
[52:40] i did do get drunk you could forgive me
[52:42] but i
[52:43] but i'm but i wouldn't be guilty
[52:47] you see
[52:48] if i did do it
[52:50] if i did get drunk you could forgive me
[52:56] and i wouldn't be guilty
[52:57] but yet i'm not justified what he i'm
[53:01] sorry for that's confusing
[53:03] he gives an example
[53:05] he gives an example and he talks about a
[53:07] woman
[53:08] that lives improper
[53:12] in her life
[53:14] in her flesh
[53:15] he tells us earlier in the same message
[53:19] the bride union i i it's on my ipad
[53:22] he talks about that that woman in her
[53:24] flesh she can be forgiven
[53:27] but she'll never be justified in her
[53:29] flesh
[53:30] because she actually did an act
[53:33] that she was supposed to do
[53:37] but he said this life the predestinated
[53:40] life
[53:41] it's completely different
[53:44] amen
[53:46] but the word let's continue on paragraph
[53:49] he said but the word justify is though
[53:51] you've never done it amen
[53:54] it's not even regarded
[53:56] at all
[53:58] so all the faults
[54:00] that believe or see
[54:02] in your life
[54:06] what are you gonna do with that quote
[54:10] or what are you going to do with the
[54:11] scriptures
[54:13] but the word justified says though you
[54:15] never did it in the first place amen not
[54:17] even
[54:18] not even regarded at all
[54:21] how is it done
[54:23] in god's book of the sea
[54:26] of forgetfulness
[54:28] see god can't remember
[54:31] what your flesh
[54:32] did wrong
[54:36] but all the believers can
[54:39] but if they got the character of christ
[54:41] they won't be able to either
[54:44] because the prophet told us he said you
[54:45] can't stop a bird from flying over but
[54:47] you can stop from building a nest oh
[54:49] bless god i'll tell you a whole bunch of
[54:50] stories about brother dale why he used
[54:52] to do this when he was earlier
[54:54] you know and they'll lay a whole bunch
[54:55] of eggs up there
[54:56] because you let them nest
[54:59] you know the bird always nests really
[55:01] close to the mind you see
[55:04] satan's playground
[55:07] the cues are the brethren
[55:08] we're getting to this revelations
[55:12] where was i
[55:13] wow
[55:17] he said how's it done he said it's in
[55:20] god's book of the sea of forgetfulness
[55:23] your old book
[55:25] the church get this part your old book
[55:28] and your old marriage of divorcement is
[55:30] in dead
[55:32] and god see a forgetfulness
[55:35] he don't know
[55:36] he's god but he don't know
[55:39] that you did it
[55:45] whoa
[55:49] watch us
[55:50] it's not even in god's memory amen
[55:53] you're justified
[55:55] therefore being justified it was accused
[55:59] you was accused
[56:01] you were accused of drinking and smoking
[56:03] and living in proper and looking at bad
[56:05] pictures you were accused and you the
[56:08] real you
[56:09] and you never done it
[56:11] in the first place now the old union is
[56:14] put in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[56:17] and you wasn't and you wasn't married to
[56:20] it
[56:22] to it to begin with
[56:24] watch was it your fault that's what he's
[56:26] saying
[56:27] he said he's the bridegroom
[56:29] bore your shame himself for you and he
[56:32] took your place when he died for us that
[56:34] was for our watches see he didn't die
[56:37] for your predestinated seed
[56:41] because your predestinated seed never
[56:43] did it
[56:45] he died for your flesh
[56:49] so he could take that and put it in the
[56:50] sea of forgetfulness
[56:52] man
[56:54] oh it's beautiful
[56:55] he said the bridegroom bore your shame
[56:58] himself for you in your place and he
[57:00] took your plies for you and you were
[57:03] predestinated in him to be his bride
[57:05] before the foundation of the world
[57:07] so the bible said so you were his
[57:09] predestinated seed let's go to
[57:11] revelations 12
[57:13] 7
[57:14] and to 12.
[57:16] this is where he says he says it was
[57:18] accused you was accused that you did it
[57:24] amen
[57:25] this is how
[57:27] by god's revelation
[57:29] when somebody's coming up
[57:31] and accuses
[57:34] the brethren
[57:36] now see god knows your heart god knows
[57:39] if you love the word amen
[57:41] that you know
[57:42] you know the vindication of of being
[57:45] you know
[57:47] with the baptism of the holy ghost is
[57:48] believing the word for your day
[57:50] man believe in the whole word of god
[57:51] amen being able to say amen to it but it
[57:54] don't mean you're flesh
[57:57] it's a process for your flesh
[58:00] watch this and there is a war in heaven
[58:02] and michael and his angels fought
[58:04] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[58:06] and his angels
[58:08] under leia
[58:10] and they prevailed not neither was their
[58:12] place found in heaven okay now watch
[58:14] this i've got to stop here now where did
[58:16] you come from
[58:19] if you're going to heaven you came from
[58:21] heaven no man came from no man's going
[58:23] to have unless he first came from heaven
[58:25] that's important in this scripture we
[58:26] got to remember our destiny okay next
[58:29] one
[58:30] hallelujah
[58:31] and the great dragon was cast out in the
[58:34] serpent the old serpent called the devil
[58:36] and satan which deceived the whole world

[58:41] remember that because you're not
[58:43] deceived you're here this morning you're
[58:44] not deceived deceived the whole world
[58:47] and he was cast into the earth and he
[58:50] and his angels were cast out with them
[58:52] okay it's the next verse
[58:55] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[58:57] heaven
[58:58] now he's come the salvation and strength
[59:02] and the kingdom of our god now who's
[59:04] that

[59:19] amen
[59:20] hallelujah
[59:22] and the power
[59:24] of christ
[59:26] and the accused
[59:28] [Music]

[59:32] flesh
[59:34] to work through
[59:35] amen
[59:37] let me let me let me let's do it let's
[59:39] do a trial is god here this morning
[59:43] but but the bible says no man's ever
[59:45] seen god

[59:52] morning and you so who are you

[1:00:11] so anybody he says well bless god i went
[1:00:13] to that church and
[1:00:16] not now there is places that are off the
[1:00:19] word that ain't to say you know
[1:00:22] if there was somebody that's off the
[1:00:24] scriptures
[1:00:25] you say well
[1:00:26] this is what the scripture says
[1:00:28] and they're not lined up i'm talking
[1:00:30] about people putting guilt on holy
[1:00:33] ghost-filled
[1:00:35] believers
[1:00:36] god's predestination
[1:00:38] accused in god's predestination that's
[1:00:40] what we're talking about the next
[1:00:41] scripture is important
[1:00:47] oh sorry sorry and they overcame him by
[1:00:49] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:00:51] their testimony that's us right we're
[1:00:54] confessing christ and the word of our
[1:00:56] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:00:59] until the death that means you don't
[1:01:01] need to wear a mask
[1:01:03] regardless what the world lists us
[1:01:05] yeah i'm afraid of dying
[1:01:11] you know what you do with that verse
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:15] therefore
[1:01:16] rejoice oh you have it now that means we
[1:01:20] should
[1:01:20] be rejoicing
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:24] you know i want to tell you a story in
[1:01:26] the middle of this we went to a wedding
[1:01:27] yesterday
[1:01:29] and they were happy at the wedding
[1:01:32] and there's nothing wrong with that
[1:01:34] how can you be god's family and be sad
[1:01:37] you think jesus is in heaven like
[1:01:42] oh my
[1:01:45] but see the prophet called us starchy
[1:01:49] and he said
[1:01:50] if you don't have no emotion
[1:01:52] bury it your daddy
[1:01:55] so you're in a love affair with christ
[1:01:57] and you're
[1:02:02] i never seen anybody at the wedding fall
[1:02:03] asleep
[1:02:04] and for sure not at the reception or
[1:02:07] after the kisses
[1:02:09] they were like
[1:02:15] but if you were starting at that wedding
[1:02:17] your starchy this morning
[1:02:21] because you're still packing the same
[1:02:22] flesh
[1:02:24] if you were happy at the wedding in the
[1:02:27] flesh
[1:02:28] you'd be happy this morning because
[1:02:29] that's just how that's why africa is
[1:02:31] like that
[1:02:32] you know it don't matter where you go to
[1:02:34] africa
[1:02:35] and
[1:02:36] i'm just giving you a paraphrase you can
[1:02:38] always disorder it
[1:02:44] they're well done
[1:02:48] because they're just
[1:02:51] bouncy type of people
[1:02:54] they have no problem they get to church
[1:02:55] they're just
[1:03:00] therefore rejoice
[1:03:02] now that don't mean
[1:03:06] you haven't now remember we came from
[1:03:09] heaven
[1:03:10] so we're just on a trip here and
[1:03:12] sometimes when you go camping to
[1:03:14] algonquin park my kids have told me this
[1:03:16] if it rains the whole trip it's not
[1:03:20] the greatest
[1:03:22] you know you can kind of prepare
[1:03:25] that's what we're in
[1:03:27] we kind of prepared but it might rain a
[1:03:30] bunch when we're here
[1:03:32] because watch this scripture
[1:03:33] and ye that dwell in them now that's us
[1:03:36] right because john 3 13 says that no man
[1:03:40] ascended up to heaven but first he came
[1:03:41] down from heaven first and the son of
[1:03:44] man that was talking to him said he's
[1:03:46] there right now
[1:03:48] oh that's
[1:03:49] dead my favorite scripture
[1:03:52] but you're going to rejoice all ye
[1:03:53] heaven
[1:03:54] and ye that dwell in the heavens that's
[1:03:57] me
[1:03:58] i'm there right now
[1:04:00] but i'm preaching to you this morning
[1:04:02] i'm no different in christ you say
[1:04:04] you're lying to me well then
[1:04:06] i'd like to see you tell christ he was
[1:04:07] lying
[1:04:09] because he was standing right in front
[1:04:10] of him he said christ jesus is there
[1:04:12] right now and he's telling them he's
[1:04:13] already standing in jerusalem
[1:04:17] but watch this is the part you need to
[1:04:19] but whoa
[1:04:21] to the inhabitants
[1:04:24] of the earth
[1:04:27] it's reigned in a golf course
[1:04:32] and the inhabitants of the sea
[1:04:36] for the devil is come down unto you
[1:04:40] having great wrath because he knoweth
[1:04:44] his time
[1:04:51] the accuser of the brothers
[1:04:53] satan
[1:04:55] and he's attacking
[1:04:57] things on the earth
[1:05:01] but we're not of the earth
[1:05:03] we came from heaven
[1:05:05] so he might try to get to our flesh
[1:05:10] but he'll never get to the predestinated
[1:05:12] sea
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] because our predestinated seed ain't
[1:05:18] from the earth
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:21] we know that our flesh is because flesh
[1:05:23] and blood don't carry the kingdom of
[1:05:24] heaven
[1:05:26] amen this was our proving ground
[1:05:29] to satan
[1:05:30] the god in this age
[1:05:34] would take a wife a bride
[1:05:37] and she would be a happy bride
[1:05:40] see let's go back to our first scripture
[1:05:42] there's no fear
[1:05:45] in love
[1:05:47] you can't serve god and be in fear
[1:05:53] you're not get if i mean unless it's
[1:05:55] some kind of a warp deal you're not
[1:05:57] getting married
[1:05:58] and fearful of the person that you're
[1:06:00] married
[1:06:06] wow
[1:06:09] can i finish this quote
[1:06:11] how did you come to do this
[1:06:14] you were deceived into it by your first
[1:06:17] marriage
[1:06:18] to your adulterous parent
[1:06:21] even
[1:06:23] it ain't your fault
[1:06:27] no did you ask to be born
[1:06:29] in the flesh it's not your fault
[1:06:33] it's no fault of your own
[1:06:36] by your own birth you came after eve who
[1:06:40] had committed adultery
[1:06:42] and that's the reason you were born an
[1:06:45] adulteress
[1:06:48] you're a sinner to begin with the flesh
[1:06:50] that's right
[1:06:52] but you was deceived into it and you had
[1:06:55] no no you ain't
[1:06:57] your fault
[1:07:00] it ain't your fault
[1:07:02] that's how you never did it the real you
[1:07:05] it's the next prayer it's 2 30. he said
[1:07:07] you never did it because the little germ
[1:07:11] that's in you
[1:07:13] was to be with you
[1:07:15] before the foundation
[1:07:17] of the world
[1:07:19] and that's the germ
[1:07:22] that god put a name to
[1:07:24] in the lamb's
[1:07:26] book
[1:07:27] of life
[1:07:30] now he says something about this
[1:07:33] he says now you heard the story
[1:07:36] of my little eagle
[1:07:39] in the
[1:07:40] barnyard and the head farmer found an
[1:07:43] egg
[1:07:45] and he put it under the chicken
[1:07:48] and the eagle was in the barnyard
[1:07:51] and that eagle was eating grain and
[1:07:54] it was scratching in the the
[1:07:57] stuff
[1:07:59] but it wasn't supposed to scratch in
[1:08:00] that stuff it wasn't me but was it his
[1:08:02] fault was it his fault that the farmer
[1:08:05] went took the egg put it under an eagle
[1:08:08] no wasn't his fault
[1:08:11] none of that stuff in that chicken yard
[1:08:14] none of that stuff went on in the
[1:08:15] chicken yard will be held accountable to
[1:08:18] that eagle
[1:08:22] but
[1:08:24] when the lord jesus flew over
[1:08:27] and he went whoa
[1:08:32] uh huh
[1:08:33] ray up our hearts burned within us
[1:08:37] he said we never had strength in our
[1:08:39] legs to stand for fear
[1:08:43] of the things that your god
[1:08:45] had done
[1:08:49] wow
[1:08:51] no wonder our prophet could say
[1:08:53] that believers would walk
[1:08:56] where angels had more sense
[1:08:58] to go
[1:09:01] he said where angels would fear to tread
[1:09:06] wow
[1:09:08] god help us
[1:09:11] god help us
[1:09:13] see what god thinks of you
[1:09:15] love
[1:09:17] love
[1:09:20] you know if you we're going into let me
[1:09:23] let me go into first john 4 and 17.
[1:09:27] now we read 18 and i want to go back a
[1:09:30] verse
[1:09:31] for satan's
[1:09:33] to to clench
[1:09:35] something
[1:09:37] 17.
[1:09:38] we're not talking about love that's like
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:43] it goes
[1:09:44] you don't have to put clothes on this
[1:09:46] morning
[1:09:50] someone at the wedding
[1:09:52] forgot to get dressed
[1:09:58] this love
[1:09:59] can still speak the truth
[1:10:03] you want to read a good scripture you
[1:10:05] read all the chapter 4 first john
[1:10:07] it's all about love
[1:10:11] therefore is our love made
[1:10:14] perfect
[1:10:16] that we may be wimps
[1:10:24] and you say
[1:10:26] that's off the word brother
[1:10:28] that's a lie
[1:10:30] boldness
[1:10:31] though we may have perfect love
[1:10:34] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:10:36] judgment
[1:10:37] because as he was so are we
[1:10:42] this world see christ himself
[1:10:45] don't even lower you below him
[1:10:54] remember that old man
[1:10:55] the indian head
[1:10:57] oh he sure does
[1:10:59] oh yeah he tells you about the chicken
[1:11:01] yard remember when the chickens hate
[1:11:03] that thing and the farmer brought out
[1:11:04] the bean meal and the corn had mold in
[1:11:06] it and you ate that corn and you were
[1:11:08] supposed to be eating just fresh cut
[1:11:10] flesh
[1:11:12] that's the indian man
[1:11:14] he's powerless
[1:11:16] but he's talking to you
[1:11:18] and you need to tell him a few things
[1:11:20] like uh where he's going and and like a
[1:11:23] few other words like uh femi's the boosh
[1:11:27] and shut up
[1:11:28] that was one of the only french words i
[1:11:30] could remember in school you know
[1:11:33] femi chaboosh i mean it was important
[1:11:36] he needs to tell satan that
[1:11:38] amen i know you're in i know where you
[1:11:41] came from and i know where you're going
[1:11:44] man
[1:11:45] but i also know where i came from
[1:11:48] and i know where i'm going to
[1:11:52] because i'm living the vision
[1:11:55] that god had
[1:11:57] oh that's beautiful
[1:11:59] this ain't no denomination this ain't
[1:12:01] about brother dale preaching they're
[1:12:03] saying about this church they're saying
[1:12:05] about the church in wyoming this ain't
[1:12:07] about any church this ain't even about
[1:12:09] the mess this is about this is about a
[1:12:12] wedding
[1:12:13] this is about christ and a bride a wife
[1:12:16] a wedding
[1:12:17] we're going to uh can you imagine the
[1:12:20] party there i mean we went home at nine
[1:12:22] o'clock last night but can you imagine
[1:12:23] like a thousand years a party
[1:12:26] i mean they're gonna have good pepsi
[1:12:27] there
[1:12:30] just think of that
[1:12:36] think of how christ is going to dance
[1:12:38] with his pride
[1:12:40] for 1 000 years
[1:12:42] you say oh damn
[1:12:44] bless god i would never do that
[1:12:46] that's what the prophet said
[1:12:49] though god anointed him and he went
[1:12:50] dancing too
[1:12:52] remember david's wife
[1:12:55] when david danced
[1:12:57] oh he was dancing under the anointing of
[1:12:59] the spirit but he got so consumed in the
[1:13:02] spirit that he took off his clothes
[1:13:05] you know see see we have this
[1:13:09] hard
[1:13:11] dutch
[1:13:12] canadian cold weather
[1:13:14] philosophies
[1:13:16] like of course we believe in being
[1:13:18] modest
[1:13:19] and women and men's apparel and all that
[1:13:22] that you have to do that to get to
[1:13:24] heaven
[1:13:25] how come god never judged david for that
[1:13:34] instead he cursed david's wife for
[1:13:36] laughing at him
[1:13:38] now
[1:13:41] when you get that one figured out i'll
[1:13:42] ask you another question
[1:13:50] you see
[1:13:53] love
[1:13:55] see the bible says will be peculiar
[1:13:58] that's why
[1:13:59] women will look like one you know what
[1:14:02] i'm talking about
[1:14:03] you know
[1:14:04] holiness is beautiful
[1:14:07] if you don't think so go look at the
[1:14:08] mennonite people they still have it
[1:14:11] i ain't seen an ugly mennonite girl yet
[1:14:16] it's just
[1:14:18] it's just like a radiant
[1:14:21] it's because it's god
[1:14:24] he said well bless god
[1:14:26] careful no man will see god without
[1:14:28] holiness
[1:14:38] wow
[1:14:39] but david was so consumed he was so
[1:14:43] happy when the ark
[1:14:45] watches
[1:14:46] that was just a type
[1:14:52] wow
[1:14:53] that means
[1:14:55] our prophet said
[1:14:56] i know you say well bless god he's
[1:14:59] careful
[1:15:01] our prophet said
[1:15:04] he's here right now
[1:15:06] not a type
[1:15:10] he said right now
[1:15:13] and when you could feel his presence
[1:15:15] in the worship service
[1:15:17] what was this i'll just say ouch ahead
[1:15:20] of time for you like brother steve i'd
[1:15:22] say ouch
[1:15:23] once or twice when you say ouch
[1:15:25] and the reason you could stay in your
[1:15:27] pew
[1:15:28] is because you're starchy dutch cold
[1:15:31] canadian
[1:15:34] that goes for me too
[1:15:37] because
[1:15:38] it's not a tight now
[1:15:41] it's the presence
[1:15:43] of jehovah god
[1:15:46] your groom
[1:15:49] and if david in a type in the old
[1:15:52] testament before the baptism of the holy
[1:15:55] ghost was given
[1:15:57] danced so violently that he tore his
[1:16:01] clothes off and god never rebuked them
[1:16:08] and you could stay in your pew all put
[1:16:10] together
[1:16:17] and i got nine fingers pointing at me
[1:16:23] are we going to a wedding
[1:16:26] the prophet said clearly multiple times
[1:16:30] we're already married
[1:16:34] and we're we're already been pronounced
[1:16:36] wife
[1:16:38] you have to be if you're a small g god
[1:16:41] and we're going to the party
[1:16:45] but the
[1:16:46] wedding is
[1:16:49] part of the party
[1:16:56] careful you don't get too much
[1:17:01] carry over amen
[1:17:03] oh bless god i was raised
[1:17:08] that's the old indian
[1:17:10] because he don't want you to break loose
[1:17:13] in the presence
[1:17:15] of your lord
[1:17:19] he don't want you to show us why did
[1:17:22] satan
[1:17:23] fight
[1:17:24] jesus michael the angel
[1:17:27] god jehovah god
[1:17:31] only one reason
[1:17:33] because he
[1:17:35] wanted your worship
[1:17:38] your worship
[1:17:40] he don't want to be prayed watch us
[1:17:42] don't get it wrong
[1:17:45] satan was in heaven
[1:17:48] and that's where pure holy people go
[1:17:53] watch this
[1:17:54] satan didn't come to earth
[1:17:57] to get the praise
[1:17:58] of prostitutes
[1:18:02] that's cheap praise
[1:18:13] god cast saved earth
[1:18:16] but satan
[1:18:18] wants your praise
[1:18:21] and if the next thing to your praise
[1:18:26] obviously you can't give it to him
[1:18:28] watch this i'm preaching to myself the
[1:18:31] morning you'll ever know
[1:18:33] the next thing he'll do
[1:18:35] if he can't take your praise
[1:18:38] which you can't give it to them because
[1:18:40] you only have one husband one lord so
[1:18:43] it's impossible for you to praise them
[1:18:45] but it's not to praise the lord
[1:18:49] at all
[1:18:55] he'll keep this thing
[1:19:01] oh don't don't say
[1:19:03] you don't think so spiritual what did
[1:19:05] the lady say when he came to our prophet
[1:19:11] remember
[1:19:12] he said you brag
[1:19:15] on jesus
[1:19:17] too much
[1:19:22] what did sarah
[1:19:24] call abraham this has nothing to do with
[1:19:26] flesh
[1:19:28] brothers listen brothers and sisters
[1:19:30] when we get to heaven brothers aren't
[1:19:32] the head
[1:19:34] we're we're his bride
[1:19:36] period this has nothing to do with
[1:19:39] some cheap
[1:19:40] stupid hitler dictatorship
[1:19:46] this has to do with
[1:19:48] worshiping god
[1:19:51] but sarah called
[1:19:53] abraham my lord
[1:19:56] but that's just how we should be with
[1:19:58] our lord
[1:20:00] not not each other but it's it's all the
[1:20:04] what what was the scripture
[1:20:06] it's a mystery
[1:20:08] concerning christ
[1:20:11] and the church
[1:20:15] he just told you about husbands and
[1:20:16] wives just so you knew what pain she was
[1:20:20] on
[1:20:26] so when you come
[1:20:28] to a love affair
[1:20:30] with god
[1:20:32] you should be drunk
[1:20:35] stone drunk
[1:20:37] in the presence of jehovah god
[1:20:40] that's why
[1:20:42] that's why this is no game
[1:20:45] that's why on friday night
[1:20:48] lucifer imitates god's jehovah presence
[1:20:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:55] and gets people to go out and drink
[1:20:57] happy water
[1:20:59] to get drunk
[1:21:00] in an imitation
[1:21:02] of the real genuine baptism of the holy
[1:21:06] ghost and the life
[1:21:09] that'll follow it and when they ask
[1:21:11] peter
[1:21:12] they come out of the upper and he said
[1:21:14] you are stone drunk
[1:21:21] and peter said this is that the jewel
[1:21:24] spoke of
[1:21:28] and it's just the third hour of the day
[1:21:35] watch this
[1:21:36] satan
[1:21:38] will deceive brother dale
[1:21:40] he knows that i'll brag on jesus
[1:21:43] he knows i won't he knows i won't br
[1:21:46] that's oh let me rephrase that he knows
[1:21:47] i won't brag on him
[1:21:50] so he'll get me not to brag on anybody
[1:21:54] like jesus
[1:21:59] and he ain't got your praise
[1:22:02] but he's getting the same effect
[1:22:06] that
[1:22:08] wow
[1:22:16] amazing
[1:22:19] amazing
[1:22:20] love
[1:22:22] see this is not no religion
[1:22:25] this ain't no church this ain't about
[1:22:27] churches saying about pews this is about
[1:22:31] jehovah god
[1:22:32] a life in a marriage
[1:22:35] and uh just it's just amazing
[1:22:40] that you never did it
[1:22:42] the real you
[1:22:44] never did it
[1:22:46] in the first place
[1:22:50] wow
[1:22:51] john 15 13 we're going to close
[1:22:54] soon with this he said no greater love
[1:22:57] hath a man
[1:22:59] then he'll lay down his life
[1:23:04] for his friends
[1:23:06] i want to close with this thought
[1:23:09] how could jesus
[1:23:12] lay down his life
[1:23:16] when our prophet said it wasn't the
[1:23:18] nails that held them there
[1:23:21] jesus said himself itself to the
[1:23:23] disciples when he had peter put his
[1:23:25] sword away he said don't you know i
[1:23:27] could have called for
[1:23:29] ten thousand legions of angels
[1:23:33] to destroy the world
[1:23:35] and set me free
[1:23:39] you know how christ could die
[1:23:43] for you you could look in the scriptures
[1:23:46] let's just let's just tell the story
[1:23:48] here for a second if you give me a
[1:23:50] couple minutes look back in genesis
[1:23:52] where god made
[1:23:54] mad
[1:23:55] it made this man first in genesis i
[1:23:59] don't know if it's one or two but it
[1:24:00] says it made god made man in his
[1:24:06] image male and female
[1:24:09] but it was
[1:24:12] one person
[1:24:17] and then about
[1:24:19] seven scriptures verses now
[1:24:22] said god made flesh
[1:24:26] made a flesh man made abraham
[1:24:28] in the flesh
[1:24:30] he had already made the man
[1:24:32] in the image of god
[1:24:34] and then so watch us so
[1:24:37] so all you sisters
[1:24:39] god made
[1:24:40] man and woman
[1:24:42] in his image
[1:24:45] then he made the flesh body
[1:24:47] and then he cracked the rib off of the
[1:24:49] one
[1:24:51] and put it in the woman
[1:24:54] directly
[1:24:56] the image
[1:24:58] amen
[1:24:59] now you could say you i know some
[1:25:01] ministers would say well the man
[1:25:03] was the image of god and the woman was
[1:25:06] the byproduct
[1:25:08] in the flesh
[1:25:10] maybe
[1:25:13] but not in the creation
[1:25:15] not in the spirit
[1:25:17] you go to genesis i'm not sure where it
[1:25:19] is but i think it's genesis 3 right near
[1:25:20] the beginning he said god made man in
[1:25:22] his image man and woman in its image it
[1:25:25] was one person
[1:25:27] he hadn't made the body yet
[1:25:29] hadn't made the body yet
[1:25:31] so no greater love hath a man that he
[1:25:34] would lay down his life
[1:25:36] he wasn't just laying down for his
[1:25:38] friends
[1:25:41] he was laying it down
[1:25:43] for his
[1:25:44] wife
[1:25:46] wife
[1:25:47] male
[1:25:48] in the first image there wasn't male or
[1:25:50] female man was made in the image of god
[1:25:53] you say woman was made the
[1:25:55] the
[1:25:56] see what i'm trying to say is we were
[1:25:59] made in god's image
[1:26:01] and he laid down his life for his
[1:26:06] wife it's beautiful
[1:26:09] and you just look at how that goes in
[1:26:12] in the to uh
[1:26:14] predestination and all of
[1:26:17] these things it's just
[1:26:19] amazing
[1:26:21] amazing thank you lord amen
[1:26:25] hallelujah
[1:26:27] no greater love
[1:26:29] at the man
[1:26:32] to lay down his life now we in our flesh
[1:26:35] will surrender our will
[1:26:38] of this flesh
[1:26:39] to the real person
[1:26:42] inside
[1:26:43] you know back when we read our first
[1:26:45] scripture there's no fear and love
[1:26:48] god never forced himself
[1:26:51] on anyone
[1:26:54] but the reason god
[1:26:56] drew you
[1:26:58] was
[1:26:59] he was in you
[1:27:02] that's amazing
[1:27:04] through predestination
[1:27:08] that's why not all
[1:27:10] you know i you know i gotta i gotta tell
[1:27:12] you i gotta show you something
[1:27:15] somewhere here
[1:27:17] i'm sorry
[1:27:18] just
[1:27:26] oh
[1:27:28] wow
[1:27:30] well i might go into this part of my i
[1:27:32] can't find my scripture right now well
[1:27:34] maybe if i opened it up and maybe i
[1:27:35] could
[1:27:40] but the bible says
[1:27:42] i can't i can't lay my fingers on the
[1:27:44] scripture but the bible says if you were
[1:27:46] of the world they'd love you
[1:27:49] but see because you're of god
[1:27:53] i know it's here so much
[1:27:56] but because you're of god
[1:27:59] they hate you
[1:28:02] that goes right back
[1:28:03] to genesis
[1:28:06] see
[1:28:07] the ones that were made in the image of
[1:28:09] god
[1:28:11] sorry i can't
[1:28:13] that's for next week
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:17] but you were made in god's image
[1:28:20] and that's the reason the world
[1:28:23] hates you so if we go back to the people
[1:28:26] matt you know the people and the prophet
[1:28:28] and and i'm i'm not taken away from what
[1:28:30] the prophet said but you know
[1:28:32] the prophet said
[1:28:34] we misunderstand the prophet
[1:28:37] the prophet said in this last time
[1:28:41] that the bride
[1:28:42] will become unified
[1:28:46] but the bible says that not all israel
[1:28:48] was israel
[1:28:49] and only two went in
[1:28:53] and so when people put posts on the
[1:28:56] internet or stuff and they actually well
[1:28:57] you know the churches are really gonna
[1:28:59] the churches will never all come
[1:29:00] together
[1:29:03] no because they're not all bright
[1:29:05] don't matter what you put on the sign
[1:29:08] it's your life
[1:29:10] see it didn't matter what israel called
[1:29:12] for a king
[1:29:13] is there life
[1:29:16] will you watch us will you go to the
[1:29:18] promised land
[1:29:20] that proves
[1:29:23] your life
[1:29:24] the ones that are in the pro not gold
[1:29:27] the ones that are in the promised land
[1:29:31] will all be in unity
[1:29:33] but it won't be see we're
[1:29:36] we're doing a crossover you're looking
[1:29:38] at the flesh you think well all the all
[1:29:40] the people that say
[1:29:44] he said don't preach me a message live
[1:29:46] me one don't tell me a testimony which
[1:29:49] they're good
[1:29:51] and and telling the message too is good
[1:29:54] but if you can live it
[1:29:58] those are the ones that have went over
[1:30:02] those are the ones that will be unified
[1:30:06] that
[1:30:07] man so don't be discouraged when you say
[1:30:09] well not everybody's come together yet
[1:30:11] so i still got a little bit of time
[1:30:12] that's an old man telling you that
[1:30:15] that's all that meant on you because the
[1:30:16] ones that are there they're already
[1:30:18] unified because see
[1:30:20] i'm here but i'm already in heaven
[1:30:23] so i'm already unified because i'm not
[1:30:26] really here i'm actually there
[1:30:28] but i'm talking to you but i'm actually
[1:30:30] there because god's talking to me there
[1:30:32] sending it down to me here
[1:30:36] that's crazy but that's true
[1:30:39] that's crazy that's true
[1:30:42] man if you ever get a hold of that
[1:30:46] that's how peter that's how god
[1:30:48] could call peter
[1:30:50] that was
[1:30:53] that's how he could call brother dale
[1:30:57] when he felt great
[1:30:59] that's nothing to do with flesh
[1:31:02] absolutely nothing to do with flesh
[1:31:06] nothing to you with flesh i know the
[1:31:07] bible says study show yourself proof and
[1:31:09] i do that
[1:31:12] but how would a peter studied when he
[1:31:14] couldn't read and write his own name
[1:31:19] it's nothing to do with flesh
[1:31:23] has everything to do with jehovah
[1:31:26] man what our prophets say
[1:31:28] my greatest gift
[1:31:32] is getting out of the way
[1:31:34] just shut up and get out of the way
[1:31:39] and then it's all god
[1:31:41] amen let's stay
[1:31:45] thank you lord oh he's
[1:31:48] he's amazing
[1:31:51] thank you lord
[1:31:56] hallelujah i'll tell you this this
[1:31:57] morning church
[1:31:59] no fear and love god's not afraid that
[1:32:02] you won't make it
[1:32:04] you might be afraid you're not going to
[1:32:05] make it that's that's that indian head
[1:32:08] but god ain't afraid
[1:32:11] god already
[1:32:13] he
[1:32:15] see he knew before you knew and
[1:32:18] that's
[1:32:19] that's just amazing
[1:32:21] no fear in love how could he love you
[1:32:24] because he knew
[1:32:26] it's beautiful amen
[1:32:28] thank you lord
[1:32:30] hallelujah
[1:32:33] thank you lord
[1:32:35] you are
[1:32:37] we are
[1:32:38] i i believe with all my heart every
[1:32:40] person here
[1:32:41] you are literally living
[1:32:44] with
[1:32:45] brotherdale's mistakes
[1:32:48] i'm literally living the vision
[1:32:53] liter you see the footsteps of the lord
[1:32:58] are
[1:32:59] ordered
[1:33:01] of the lord i'm
[1:33:03] man
[1:33:05] this is unbelievable
[1:33:10] how did god
[1:33:11] send the spies
[1:33:13] to a prostitute whorehouse
[1:33:21] the footsteps
[1:33:22] of the lord
[1:33:24] are ordered
[1:33:27] of the lord
[1:33:29] and even in your
[1:33:31] shortcomings it's unbelievable he's here
[1:33:34] this morning like you never believe
[1:33:38] remember our prophet said
[1:33:41] all the denominational word would preach
[1:33:43] that jonah
[1:33:45] had backslidder run from god
[1:33:48] and our prophet said
[1:33:51] he was perfectly
[1:33:54] in god's will
[1:33:59] and your shortcomings
[1:34:03] your god will see maybe god i'm not
[1:34:06] saying god made you sin
[1:34:07] but god will turn that
[1:34:10] to his glory
[1:34:11] he will take your mud and turn it to
[1:34:13] diamond
[1:34:15] and he knew that jonah had to run from
[1:34:17] him and he had to prepare a fish and
[1:34:19] when he went out to it do you think of
[1:34:21] this he went out to a heathen nation
[1:34:25] he then i i'm going to shut her down on
[1:34:27] this he went out to a heathen pagan
[1:34:29] country
[1:34:31] superpower of the world
[1:34:36] and they put sackcloth
[1:34:39] on their animals
[1:34:41] jonah's message was so
[1:34:44] powerful
[1:34:45] because in their pagan sin god used
[1:34:49] their pagan sin watch this if you got a
[1:34:52] pagan problem this morning god used
[1:34:54] their pagan sin
[1:34:58] to convert them because they worship the
[1:35:01] god
[1:35:02] of the ocean
[1:35:05] and jonah walked out of the god
[1:35:08] of the and they just recognized
[1:35:11] god
[1:35:12] there's god
[1:35:14] just like moses was god the pharaoh he
[1:35:17] was he was jehovah god to pharaoh
[1:35:21] jonah was jehovah god to those people
[1:35:25] but he wasn't but he was
[1:35:27] and they were so affected in their sin
[1:35:31] it turned up to god
[1:35:34] wow
[1:35:38] take that devil
[1:35:41] take all my mistakes
[1:35:43] god will turn them to his beauty
[1:35:46] and see what you think of that
[1:35:52] oh it's
[1:35:53] it's just unbelievable
[1:35:56] you can see why it's not hard to
[1:36:00] man gotta just come with the thought and
[1:36:02] i'll just look that up and it's just
[1:36:03] like dump a whole pail of thoughts and i
[1:36:05] just looked them all up and just oh
[1:36:12] it's unbelievable just
[1:36:15] that's
[1:36:15] nothing
[1:36:17] nothing to do with flesh
[1:36:19] nothing you never came to god
[1:36:23] god
[1:36:24] took you
[1:36:28] oh man let's sing the size off
[1:36:32] he's he's unbelievable
[1:36:34] church oh man
[1:36:36] he became me
[1:36:41] i might
[1:36:43] become him
[1:36:46] by grace
[1:36:50] [Music]
[1:36:59] in my grace
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:06] took my place
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:20] me
[1:37:21] so that i
[1:37:23] might become him
[1:37:29] hallelujah
[1:37:34] me
[1:37:35] so that i might
[1:37:38] become in
[1:37:40] my grave
[1:37:45] [Music]
[1:37:55] hallelujah
[1:37:57] think of those words
[1:37:59] he
[1:38:00] took my place
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:28] his words are so beautiful i started to
[1:38:30] tell you
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:32] god sent it back to me
[1:38:34] to finish my story i said in genesis
[1:38:36] when god made
[1:38:39] us
[1:38:40] in his image
[1:38:43] and then later on he made flesh
[1:38:49] he made the body
[1:38:52] god's not marrying
[1:38:55] somebody
[1:38:56] that had ever touched sin
[1:38:59] because he's marrying the image
[1:39:02] the image the first image he's not
[1:39:05] marrying the man
[1:39:07] he's marrying the first image
[1:39:11] that he created
[1:39:14] because god is a spirit
[1:39:16] and those that worship him
[1:39:18] must worship in men spared
[1:39:20] and a truth he made a body
[1:39:23] and he and tabernacle but he ain't
[1:39:25] marrying the body he's marrying the
[1:39:26] image
[1:39:30] so if your body fell down and you were
[1:39:33] in rachel
[1:39:34] rahab's whorehouse he ain't marrying
[1:39:36] that body
[1:39:37] i i tell you why because he brought the
[1:39:40] lineage of himself
[1:39:42] right through those lineages
[1:39:45] rahab and then david came up
[1:39:48] and david had stole the other man's wife
[1:39:51] and christ came right through thousands
[1:39:54] he came right through all that sin the
[1:39:56] house
[1:39:58] and david stealing the wife and
[1:39:59] prostitution
[1:40:01] and all that he came through all that
[1:40:04] but he did
[1:40:05] because he didn't take the bodies
[1:40:09] oh
[1:40:14] he took the image
[1:40:17] that was in his mind
[1:40:21] that's why he say
[1:40:22] you didn't do it
[1:40:24] you were tricked but it wasn't i married
[1:40:26] you and then some other things happened
[1:40:28] but it wasn't it wasn't the person i
[1:40:30] married because
[1:40:32] oh
[1:40:33] oh that's just crazy that's just crazy
[1:40:37] you can just take all that garbage and
[1:40:38] just
[1:40:39] leave it to the man behind
[1:40:43] oh
[1:40:47] he
[1:40:48] became me
[1:40:51] so that i might
[1:40:54] become him by grace
[1:41:00] he
[1:41:02] became me hallelujah
[1:41:05] i
[1:41:06] might
[1:41:07] become him
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:11] hallelujah lord thank you jesus he
[1:41:15] took my
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:26] [Applause]
[1:41:28] he
[1:41:29] became me
[1:41:31] so
[1:41:32] that i might
[1:41:35] become him
[1:41:37] by grace
[1:41:39] oh hallelujah lord jesus we love you

[1:42:18] your thoughts that you had
[1:42:20] planned in your mind
[1:42:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:42:28] how
[1:42:29] in your mind the marriage had already
[1:42:31] taken place
[1:42:33] because you made it
[1:42:35] that there couldn't this covenant
[1:42:36] couldn't be broken
[1:42:39] because it was already signed
[1:42:42] hallelujah you came yourself
[1:42:46] and you placed a part of you in each one
[1:42:48] of us
[1:42:50] and there's no fear
[1:42:53] that you'll be lost
[1:42:56] thank you lord jesus
[1:43:01] blessed be your beautiful name
[1:43:06] hallelujah
[1:43:09] thank you jesus
[1:43:12] for your wonderful presence

[1:43:18] please come and show us
[1:43:21] as we live in this flesh and we fight
[1:43:24] battles and demons
[1:43:27] of the flesh
[1:43:30] may your sweet holy spirit come and
[1:43:33] take every unbelief
[1:43:37] which is sin out of our lives
[1:43:40] and then we'll be written epistles right
[1:43:43] of all men
[1:43:45] we walk out
[1:43:46] people won't have to be able to write
[1:43:48] their name
[1:43:49] or read
[1:43:51] they'll just look at us
[1:43:53] like they did jonah
[1:43:56] and they'll say god
