[0:00] he'll be with us so we don't we have him
[0:02] until the following Tuesday he goes back
[0:04] on the 14th and just
[0:07] uh just just keep them in your prayers
[0:10] like the the services and we want to see
[0:13] God we we don't want to see just people
[0:16] people are nice but we want to see God
[0:19] amen amen Matthew 9:36 and 38 to 38 and
[0:24] I want to preach on something or God
[0:26] wants to preach on something your
[0:28] ministry in the body of
[0:32] Christ and and and even before we read
[0:35] the scriptures I want to I want to put a
[0:38] disclaimer out there I'm not talking
[0:40] about ministers only because our Prophet
[0:43] said that every single person here this
[0:46] morning as their own ministry as their
[0:49] own Ministry and that's not talked about
[0:51] very much but I want to talk about that
[0:54] and how that we are to build up the body
[0:56] of Christ by supporting other people in
[1:00] their Ministry and in their battles
[1:03] because if you have a Ministry this
[1:06] morning you have a
[1:09] battle and so you have both hallelujah
[1:13] amen Matthew 9:36 but when Jesus s when
[1:16] he Jesus saw the multitudes he was moved
[1:20] watch that watch that
[1:22] characteristic amen he was moved with
[1:26] compassion on them because they fainted
[1:29] and they were scattered abroad as sheep
[1:32] having no Shepherd and then he said unto
[1:34] his disciples the Harvest is truly
[1:38] plenteous but the
[1:40] laborers are very
[1:42] few pray ye therefore the lord of the
[1:45] Harvest that he'll send forth laborers
[1:48] into the Harvest and let's just turn to
[1:50] another scripture here I'm just 2
[1:53] Chronicles 20 and I want to read 15 I
[1:56] believe and we're going to preach on
[1:58] Jehoshaphat this morning some and just
[2:01] uh how God works in his
[2:04] body 2 Chronicles uh 20 15 hearken ye
[2:08] all Juda Juda and all ye inhabitants of
[2:12] Jerusalem and thy King J josifi thus
[2:17] saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid
[2:22] nor be dismayed by the reason of the
[2:25] great multitude for the
[2:28] battle it's not your yours but God's
[2:32] Hallelujah and God tells them what and
[2:37] where that'll it'll happen amen Lord
[2:39] Jesus we ask that you would add your
[2:41] blessing to the reading of the word this
[2:43] morning Lord Jesus and we just give you
[2:45] the glory and honor for it in your name
[2:48] we pray amen amen you may have your
[2:51] seats this morning I just want to read
[2:53] some quotes just to lay a foundation
[2:56] here right at the
[2:57] beginning amen of our are scriptures
[3:01] here here the prophet was saying he said
[3:04] you know he preached many times the
[3:05] greatest battle ever fought he
[3:09] said he said we are his the soldiers of
[3:13] the Cross and let's press the battle and
[3:16] pray and study into his word amen he
[3:20] said here I'm just trying to find my SP
[3:25] here
[3:28] hallelujah
[3:37] amen there we go revelations in the 60s
[3:41] he said that's the reason we have such a
[3:43] battle is because when we're when we
[3:46] Minister the word god exposes the devil
[3:50] see that tells us what He is amen and
[3:54] and God and so many times here the the
[3:57] prophet ministered and is saying you may
[3:59] not be a preacher and you may not be a
[4:00] minister or you may you may not do these
[4:03] things but he said the holy spirit is
[4:05] calling every one of us into our
[4:07] ministry amen and the greatest the
[4:10] greatest mistake and the greatest fear
[4:13] that we do in the church is we don't
[4:16] support one another like we should and
[4:19] their battle we look at a brother or
[4:21] sister going through a battle and we
[4:23] have all the advice in the world to help
[4:25] them fight their battle when all we need
[4:27] to do is support them to work out their
[4:30] own salvation with fear and trembling
[4:32] amen it don't matter if it was a deacon
[4:35] in the church or a mother raising her
[4:37] children for the glory of God raise up
[4:39] the child and the way you'll go and he
[4:41] won't depart from it amen it's not a
[4:43] fast food restaurant where you drive
[4:45] through and the Victory is won like that
[4:47] but it's a battle in the ministry of the
[4:49] word amen and
[4:51] participation is what helps you know the
[4:54] prophet said he had a had a sister come
[4:56] to him and he said oh he said that was
[4:58] such a terrible Serv Serv she said I
[5:01] couldn't understand a thing you were
[5:02] saying by all the hollering and
[5:04] screaming and amen and Hallelujah and
[5:07] the prophet came back to her and he said
[5:08] sister I couldn't even preach and I'd be
[5:11] scared to
[5:13] death if there wasn't holler in a
[5:15] screaming and saying
[5:17] hallelujah am man there's lots of places
[5:19] literally dozens and dozens of places
[5:22] where the Prophet said he said there
[5:23] would be a gift but he said it's you
[5:26] people that operate the gift he said I
[5:29] know No Control in the gift but it's so
[5:31] for your gift too you can see a sister
[5:34] gifted with hospitality and you'd only
[5:37] be a you'd only be a
[5:40] miserable uh person to go there and
[5:43] insult everything she was doing to to to
[5:46] give you kindness and hospitality and
[5:49] honor your presence in her
[5:51] midst amen you'd say oh the potatoes are
[5:55] burnt and the steaks dry
[5:58] and and she gave her
[6:01] heart to give you her best her
[6:05] best amen God help us you know we see a
[6:08] song leader behind the pulpit or or
[6:11] whoever would be you know you could see
[6:12] your pastor or Minister and he would
[6:14] come up behind the pulpit and he's
[6:16] stuttering and spitting and and like
[6:19] maybe like Dwight Moody he say why would
[6:21] you ever come and hear him you don't you
[6:23] don't realize that behind the scenes
[6:25] there's a battle going on and the
[6:27] prophet say I catch that and I caught
[6:29] that and I can feel that it might and I
[6:32] and I don't feel that here it's not the
[6:34] people in our
[6:35] midst but the prophet was preaching to
[6:38] the tapes and the spirits and online and
[6:40] we're online amen and you KN you would
[6:42] know that Satan was botl anything for
[6:46] the kingdom of God like just like it
[6:48] would be for a mother trying to raise
[6:49] her family and the and Satan's
[6:52] Eden and everything's turned against
[6:56] her you could give her all the advice in
[6:59] in the
[7:00] world but what about just cheering her
[7:02] on that's what about just praying for
[7:06] her just saying sister you're doing a
[7:08] fantastic job in a few months it'll be a
[7:11] lot easier amen amen you see a song
[7:15] leader that misses a tune or a piano
[7:17] player not and we get oh why do we get a
[7:19] better musician why did you just cop or
[7:22] show your hands or wave or smile or
[7:27] amen hallelujah God help us and and and
[7:31] that's not the case here this is not for
[7:33] us but you know we're going into
[7:35] meetings and there will be different

[15:52] on so what's
[15:54] it you ever see churches advertise for
[15:57] their special meeting
[15:59] the host pastor's picture is bigger than

[16:03] picture like as if the people in the
[16:05] church don't know his
[16:06] picture I mean you already know I'm ugly

[16:50] special meetings by the way I haven't
[16:51] heard back from not that I
[16:55] care
[16:57] amen I it's not what Christ
[17:02] did that wasn't how the prophet preached
[17:04] living for others to lift somebody else
[17:07] up no matter what behind the scenes he
[17:11] said he said quotes like this in the
[17:13] greatest battle ever fought he said do
[17:15] you know the secret was the sisters he
[17:17] said we had meetings where there was two
[17:18] sisters for the whole week they fasted
[17:20] and prayed the whole week nobody ever
[17:22] seen their picture on the
[17:23] poster and he said 100% of the benefit
[17:26] of that meeting was the gift of those
[17:28] two sisters and their gift of Prayer
[17:32] Warriors Prayer
[17:34] Warriors and our Prophet recognized them
[17:40] publicly amen amen you know it's like
[17:45] the prophet preached about if you stick
[17:46] your hand in the pale of water and you
[17:47] pull it out that's how big your picture
[17:50] will be when you pull your hand out of
[17:51] the pale of
[17:52] water you know he he he he ministered
[17:55] everything in in in the ministry about
[17:57] if you could make make yourself small
[17:59] small small small small small
[18:03] small and God can make somebody the
[18:05] whole bride
[18:08] large
[18:10] amen we're not if we are we're wrong
[18:13] we're not building individual kingdoms
[18:14] it's all the kingdom of Christ it's all
[18:17] for the glory of God it's nothing to do
[18:20] individually we're a
[18:22] family we're get the family
[18:26] inheritance oh God help us God help us
[18:29] to recognize these things and and and
[18:32] and expose the
[18:34] devil amen we can't live it for somebody
[18:37] else but don't put yourself in bondage
[18:40] that's amen man you have a Ministry the
[18:43] greatest gift you could to win souls
[18:46] witness the prophet talked about the
[18:47] Holy Spirit moving through the people
[18:49] and he said the holy spirit's pulling on
[18:52] to you and he said you may not minister
[18:54] or be a missionary but you'll have a
[18:57] testimony amen can you imagine watch
[19:00] this we're not far from can you imagine
[19:02] get to the spot that you got to ask
[19:03] permission to give a
[19:05] testimony come
[19:09] on you got to ask anybody permission to
[19:12] worship
[19:17] Goden you know what that is that's the
[19:20] chain yes of religion
[19:23] domination it's ownership it's flesh
[19:26] ownership it's dict
[19:29] leadership is
[19:31] evil from the pit of
[19:34] Hell
[19:36] amen God help
[19:39] us God help us let me read a quote in 63
[19:43] he said and we have seen his star and
[19:45] come to worship Him and this is a
[19:47] longest quote I'll read this morning but
[19:49] I I'd like to just lay a foundation he's
[19:52] talking here about Joseph and Joseph had
[19:55] realized that Mary was pregnant
[19:59] and he wanted to put her
[20:01] away and there was no prophets in the
[20:05] land at that
[20:07] time
[20:11] amen and here's where he gets in he said
[20:14] now there wasn't a prophet in the earth
[20:15] in those days and he said one who could
[20:17] come to Joseph and give him thus sayith
[20:19] the Lord and so the
[20:21] Lord took a secondary
[20:25] way a secondary way see that's secondary
[20:28] way could be your
[20:33] gift watch
[20:35] this he said took a secondary way and
[20:37] that's the reason that
[20:39] God took the welfare of his own son to
[20:44] the man Joseph in a dream and he said if
[20:49] you'll yield yourself to God just drop
[20:50] to the next paragraph then he he was
[20:52] just he said if you'll just yield
[20:54] yourself to God God has many ways uhoh
[20:59] Oh I thought it was just the ministering
[21:01] of the word bless God oh that's that's a
[21:04] major
[21:06] way but God has many ways that he calls
[21:09] and reveals
[21:11] himself to you see see many gifts many
[21:16] ways many gifts it might be in a in a
[21:19] fantastic meal of hospitality and and
[21:22] you'll be just blown away by
[21:26] kindness I'm serious
[21:31] and God will reveal a mystery to you and
[21:33] say this is
[21:35] Supernatural in a world of people's
[21:42] rights
[21:44] amen he said it might
[21:46] not might not you might not be a prophet
[21:50] and you might not be a teacher and you
[21:52] might not be a Sunday school teacher and
[21:54] you might not be a preacher but there's
[21:57] a way there's ways that God will reveal
[22:01] himself to you see whether it might be
[22:05] in
[22:06] dreams and it might be in some other way
[22:10] if you'll just submit
[22:12] yourself like
[22:14] Joseph like
[22:16] Joseph
[22:20] Hallelujah he let him get to sleep he
[22:22] let Joseph get to sleep and he sent the
[22:24] angel of the Lord to him in a
[22:26] dream and the angel of the Lord came to
[22:30] him Amen to Joseph amen and and of
[22:33] course revealed the
[22:36] mystery of
[22:39] Mary amen we we want to be careful that
[22:42] we don't step in the way of what God
[22:45] predestinated gave in gifts in the body
[22:50] in the body and we focus too much on on
[22:53] Hollywood popularity on whoever's on the
[22:56] screen
[22:59] amen but it's a body it's families that
[23:03] make up the family of God it's husbands
[23:06] and wives and homes and
[23:10] children
[23:11] amen God help us here let's just go and
[23:15] to 2 Chronicles 20 and I'm just going to
[23:17] go through this scripture here here
[23:19] Jehosaphat had became king and he was a
[23:22] Godly Man and and had done great things
[23:25] took down Idols in the country and and
[23:28] this you'll find in chapter 19 before
[23:30] this
[23:31] chapter and here in chapter 20 you know
[23:35] the beginning of the verse many three or
[23:37] four countries raised up against
[23:39] josaphat in battle and this was an
[23:43] amazing thing to me he said you know
[23:45] people are good at giving bearers of bad
[23:47] news but they're not so good at Living
[23:50] Good Tidings and so everybody came to
[23:53] josaphat and told him he said oh he said
[23:56] there's like there all
[24:00] oh if you've never experienced that try
[24:02] to do something for
[24:04] God and everybody will come to they
[24:10] go so they're not encouraging you in
[24:12] your battle of your
[24:15] gift they're trying to discourage
[24:18] you uhuh you don't think that's happened
[24:21] happens all the times happens multiple
[24:25] times
[24:26] amen
[24:29] and they told J Jehoshaphat you know how
[24:31] many there was and how close it was and
[24:33] in verse three it says Jehoshaphat
[24:36] feared and himself of course he feared
[24:40] because all he had heard so far was bad
[24:44] news amen and he set himself to the Lord
[24:49] and proclaimed proclaimed a fast through
[24:51] all Judea and here Judea gathered
[24:54] themselves together and and now watch I
[24:57] want to show you in verse four he said
[24:58] Judea gathered themselves together and
[25:00] they asked the help of the Lord even out
[25:02] of all the cities of Judea oh they were
[25:04] pulling up reinforcements now I I wonder
[25:07] when they pulled up those cities if they
[25:09] had to ask
[25:13] permission like they were calling on the
[25:18] Lord and then you'll see here that they
[25:22] they came forth and seek the Lord and
[25:23] they prayed and and they were you know
[25:25] in verse 5-13 he said here here
[25:28] jehoshaphat's praying and the people are
[25:30] praying and they're reminding god of
[25:34] what he's done now they didn't really
[25:36] need to but they're reminded God of how
[25:39] he's been with them and brought them out
[25:41] and how he's gave them the land and all
[25:44] the promises he's
[25:45] done and now he's reminded he said but
[25:48] now God
[25:51] whoa we're we're here to do our gift and
[25:55] Minister all that you've given to us
[25:58] and we got this fierce
[26:03] battle Hallelujah they reminded God of
[26:06] all he'd done in the past and they asked
[26:09] God how in the world are you going to
[26:11] get us through this
[26:13] one now I want to tell you something
[26:16] this may surprise
[26:18] you but God never spoke through a
[26:21] minister God never spoke through a
[26:24] prophet and it may surprise you but if
[26:26] you look in verse 14 the holy of the
[26:29] spirit the Holy Spirit
[26:32] spoke you hanging on through the
[26:35] congregation oh somebody spoke out
[26:39] during
[26:45] church somebody spoke out during church
[26:48] and this is what they said in verse 15
[26:50] he said hearken ye oh Judea inhabitants
[26:54] of Jerusalem and Thou King of
[26:56] Jehoshaphat now why wouldn't the god
[26:58] went to the king I mean many times you
[27:01] could have and I'm not I'm I'm not

[27:06] them I'm trying to show you I'm trying
[27:07] to make the play we're brothers and
[27:10] sisters we all have gifts the gift of
[27:13] ministry is without repentance it's no
[27:16] different than the gift of Sunday school

[27:24] sister's car that's a widow amen how do
[27:28] you rate the gift of

[27:41] midst it said in verse 14 that the
[27:44] spirit of the Lord came in the midst of
[27:47] the
[27:50] congregation now I meant that everybody
[27:52] was in unity it wasn't an
[27:56] individual War fair or win if they were
[28:00] in this together they were either all
[28:02] going to win or all going to

[30:08] uh God help
[30:11] us God help us see when you you this
[30:14] affects me you know with the the poor
[30:18] countries and and other things it's
[30:20] affected me because Christ came to us no
[30:23] good people he left the Splendor of
[30:26] Heaven to come to the Earth and die as
[30:29] is a is a as a criminal a butcher L
[30:32] literally butchered
[30:35] him and we
[30:37] see the bride wife and I I I I think
[30:41] about stuff like I I know I know I know
[30:44] there's a I know there's a lot of stuff
[30:46] in this but you know you see churches
[30:48] where you know like we we're very
[30:53] comfortable and I have a pastor right
[30:55] now begging me to come to India
[30:58] he's probably sent me 1,000
[31:11] pictures yeah Church in the tree sitting
[31:15] on the mud they pass out food so they
[31:17] don't starve to death after
[31:20] church some Churches got to have gold
[31:23] Steeples and brass door knobs and
[31:26] ceramic child floors and other ones
[31:29] don't even and and them aren't all evil
[31:33] but our Prophet said some things about
[31:35] them he said God never give us
[31:37] commission to build hospitals or
[31:39] churches or I mean it's it's fine to put
[31:42] a new sidewalk in we'd get muddy feet
[31:43] and place would be a mess but but he
[31:46] said Minister your
[31:49] gift Minister your gift preach the
[31:52] gospel preach the gospel be a minister
[31:55] of your gift
[31:57] to the bride of
[32:01] Christ I wonder if we're fulfilling
[32:04] that like we
[32:06] should I'm gonna shock you to
[32:09] death that Pastor in India I don't even
[32:12] know if he has a
[32:14] revelation of this beautiful
[32:17] message if God told me to I'd go to him
[32:20] and the
[32:25] partly literally thousands of
[32:32] people every time we get built up in
[32:35] ourself God can never touch you you
[32:39] think you got a great ministry be
[32:42] prepared it's going to
[32:43] collapse you think you're great
[32:46] somebody buy a casket
[32:50] because amen because God you'll be like
[32:53] a dad bed to
[32:55] God Amen
[32:58] it's it's time in the body that we puff
[33:00] each other up in Christ in Christ you're
[33:05] doing a great job you're doing an
[33:07] amazing job the food is unbelievable I
[33:10] can't believe that you're so
[33:13] kind because every one of us with this
[33:17] truth are in an unbelievable
[33:20] battle amen it's a battle for your
[33:23] eternal
[33:24] life and what would be wrong with with a
[33:27] brother or sister cheering y on see the
[33:30] natural types of spiritual in Israel
[33:32] every time they went into battle every
[33:34] time they used the Arc of the Covenant
[33:35] and the holy of holies was going into
[33:37] there the praisers and the worshippers
[33:41] went
[33:42] first so let's just look at how God
[33:45] thinks about cheerleading on Christ
[33:48] anointed wife let's just look at
[33:52] that amen when we look here in our
[33:55] scriptures here
[33:57] in 16 and 17 God tells them what to
[34:00] do and where the battle will be and then
[34:04] in 18 and 19 Jehoshaphat and all Judea
[34:08] and all of Jerusalem worship and praise
[34:12] God hallelujah and they obeyed the
[34:15] Commandments of verse 16 and 17 where
[34:18] God told them just just you know like he
[34:20] said ad ministering the word he said
[34:23] amen I'm not there yet he said don't
[34:25] check your bank account
[34:28] uhoh uh and don't check your clothes
[34:31] robe and don't see how many shoes you
[34:34] got no that's
[34:38] Bible but that's
[34:42] Insanity it is but it's still
[34:46] Bible because see if we have the faith
[34:48] that we're supposed to have we'll know
[34:50] that God's in control of everything and
[34:53] God will provide where where it's just
[34:55] just it's impossible possible to provide
[34:57] but see it's not impossible for Jehovah
[35:01] amen and here's what Jehoshaphat was up
[35:03] against and here when we look into how
[35:05] they here in verse
[35:08] 21 uh in verse 21 of this chapter here
[35:12] he said here they go and they're obeying
[35:14] the
[35:15] Commandments of what
[35:18] God told them to
[35:21] do and and Jehoshaphat counsel the
[35:25] people in verse 21 and he said when he
[35:27] had counseled the people he appointed
[35:29] the singers of the
[35:32] Lord now those singers were
[35:36] encouragers of the battle that wasn't
[35:39] even
[35:42] theirs
[35:45] who
[35:47] amen and he appointed the singers of the
[35:50] Lord that they should praise in the
[35:52] beauty of Holiness as they went out
[35:54] before the Army and said praise the Lord
[35:57] for his mercy endureth forever now now
[36:01] this battle wasn't even theirs and and I
[36:04] want to show you
[36:05] something most of the time when Israel
[36:08] sent the musicians out it was they were
[36:11] phys God was physically using them in
[36:13] the Battle of
[36:14] War but in this case but in this very
[36:20] case they never did that at
[36:23] all then God never God never even worked
[36:26] through through human flesh in this case
[36:29] not not not in battle not in
[36:32] battle only in music only in
[36:35] encouragement oh God bless you God bless
[36:39] you in your gift God bless you as your
[36:42] servant God God bless you as you're
[36:47] growing verse
[36:50] 20 verse 22 he said and when they began
[36:53] to sing and praise the Lord said and
[36:57] embarassments against the children of
[36:58] the amorites and the
[37:01] moabs and and
[37:03] ambushments against the people that came
[37:06] which came against
[37:08] Judah and because of encouragements and
[37:12] because of worship because of
[37:14] encouraging somebody else in their
[37:19] gift God Smite them
[37:22] all smot them all amen you know when you
[37:26] see a minister you know maybe maybe
[37:28] Pastor barley he's preached for a
[37:30] hundred years and it won't be the case
[37:32] but but you know you see somebody and
[37:34] and you just feel
[37:37] like you'd have to be a minister to
[37:39] understand what he's going through and
[37:42] that's it's not the time for you to be
[37:43] quiet and say
[37:44] oh I'm
[37:49] also I S the time it never was the time
[37:53] in the battle when there was a battle
[37:54] going on noise
[37:57] was what fought the Battle noise and
[38:00] worship and encouragement look look at
[38:02] even our prophet in studying this week
[38:04] you know said look at David we mentioned
[38:06] that Wednesday night he said I I tell
[38:08] you David was anointed of God before he
[38:11] was
[38:11] anointed amen you don't think so when he
[38:15] went to David's diad and he brought all
[38:17] the popular Preachers by they did that's
[38:20] how the Bible said it and they couldn't
[38:22] believe it wasn't the first son and and
[38:26] and and God had to rebuke his own
[38:29] prophet and he said you're looking at
[38:31] the Statue of the man but I'm looking at
[38:34] the heart I'm not looking at his bodily
[38:40] features and so you say well how did you
[38:42] know David was anointed over because God
[38:44] said he was looking at his
[38:46] heart God had already
[38:50] Chosen and many of us this morning we
[38:53] are in the the phase of David a perfect
[38:56] time type of David where David then when
[38:58] he got anointed everybody recognized oh
[39:01] he's
[39:02] gifted he was already
[39:07] gifted he was already
[39:09] gifted but here now David's gifted and
[39:12] he don't have a kingdom he don't have a
[39:15] throne he don't have an army he don't
[39:17] even have Israelites that like him you
[39:20] know that you know that David when he
[39:22] was when he was running for his life and
[39:25] the and the the
[39:27] uh the people had conquered the well at
[39:30] Bethlehem the palestin the I can't think
[39:33] of their name had conquered the well and
[39:35] and watch how David was David's just
[39:38] David's just very casual
[39:41] thought
[39:43] wow I'd like the
[39:45] church David just casually mentioned I'd
[39:49] like David's heart yearned for the time
[39:53] when he was a little boy and we down to
[39:55] the well in Bethlehem
[39:56] and and he drunk of that water that
[39:59] Abraham water that fleshly water he just
[40:02] yed for the time when he was at
[40:04] peace but he was in a
[40:09] bottle and his own people didn't support
[40:12] him you know if you read the B the
[40:14] scriptures in the Bible all the PE all
[40:16] the people that supported David when he
[40:18] had 30 men and three went down and
[40:19] fought in the well none of them were
[40:22] Israelites none of them none not
[40:25] one
[40:29] Hallelujah and watch how David's Fest
[40:34] desire was like their
[40:39] command
[40:41] amen look at it like
[40:43] this I'd like to get together for
[40:46] Fellowship I'll be
[40:50] there I'd like
[40:55] to
[40:56] David just casually
[40:59] think and because those people had no
[41:03] take for their own personal welfare but
[41:06] everything was regarded to the
[41:09] kingdom sound for me the kingdom of
[41:16] God your desires our
[41:19] Command amen watch this in David we we
[41:22] went back to this here David was
[41:24] anointed he never had a he never had a
[41:26] throne he never had an army he never had
[41:28] a kingdom he never had all these
[41:31] things but he was still
[41:35] God and I know a bride wife that's
[41:38] sitting here and you might be in the
[41:39] smallest Church in Canada and you might
[41:42] be in the ugliest Church in Canada but
[41:44] there's going to be a day when the Great
[41:46] Rapture is going to take place and
[41:48] you'll be sitting on the king of kings
[41:50] and Lord of lords beside the throne and
[41:52] judge the
[41:54] world Amen amen it'll be because of
[41:59] predestination and amazing
[42:02] love amen see how the people
[42:06] supported one
[42:10] another they never
[42:12] went let me
[42:18] see that won't work for
[42:23] me you
[42:25] see when somebody's in a battle and they
[42:28] reach out for help brother
[42:31] man and and the person you reaching up
[42:34] for help for they look and they
[42:38] go that won't
[42:41] work can you imagine the battle that
[42:43] just increased for that
[42:45] person but when can you you imagine the
[42:48] same person would reach out and say yes

[42:51] there I'll pray for you I'll I'll be yes

[47:22] was just a uniform battle you know I
[47:25] just
[47:26] I just
[47:27] see God help us but you
[47:30] know we we got to get
[47:33] unified it we got to get we got to come
[47:36] together and and it's not about my
[47:38] opinion or your opinion and I don't have
[47:40] a thought coming and I don't
[47:43] understand half as much as I wished I
[47:45] did I pray for God to open my eyes more
[47:48] and
[47:50] more
[47:52] amen but you see when when these great
[47:55] battles that we read in the Bible took
[47:57] place and the great victories that
[48:00] happened it was because the people
[48:01] worked together and they were unified
[48:05] and they weren't a amen when when J when
[48:09] they came here against Jericho and they
[48:11] marched around you know everything about
[48:14] that was
[48:16] ridiculous they marched around Jericho
[48:18] for six days one time and all they did
[48:20] is blow
[48:22] trumpets just just put that spiritually
[48:25] they'd be like me coming to your house
[48:27] for six days just saying oh everything
[48:28] you're doing is
[48:30] wonderful that's what I me they were
[48:32] they were encouraging each other in
[48:35] fellowship and
[48:37] worship and and then on the last day
[48:40] they went around seven times and they
[48:42] had a wild Revival and the blew Trum and
[48:45] God delivered them
[48:48] amazingly
[48:49] amen
[48:51] unified and all those people gifts guess
[48:54] what bless God of I can't play the
[48:56] guitar nobody's playing the
[48:58] guitar why I hate the
[49:03] drums well if I can't have a harp in my
[49:05] church and I don't want no string
[49:11] instruments
[49:18] amen help us
[49:22] Jesus you know our Prophet said when
[49:25] studying
[49:26] talking about David and looking into
[49:28] David so much he said David this was
[49:33] before the Holy Ghost was given David
[49:37] chased away
[49:41] demons playing a string instrument and
[49:43] you know how the prophet finished that
[49:45] quote he said God have mercy on you
[49:48] people that don't believe in string
[49:53] instruments no Holy Ghost given
[49:56] yet played the string
[50:01] instrument
[50:04] W see the
[50:07] gift
[50:08] amen and we see this
[50:12] amazing story about the seven priests
[50:15] that beared the ark and the trumpets of
[50:17] the Rams went forth this is in Joshua
[50:20] six talks about where they took Jericho
[50:23] and on the seventh day they compressed
[50:25] the city seven times and the priests
[50:27] blew the
[50:28] trumpets and it shall come to pass it
[50:30] when they make the long blast of the
[50:32] Ram's
[50:33] horns when you hear the sound of the
[50:35] trumpets that now maybe we pull this up
[50:39] Joshua 65 I want to oh oh we can't pull
[50:42] that okay we got a we got a roadblock
[50:45] here well that's all right Satan you're
[50:47] still going to lose
[50:48] because God help you next weekend amen
[50:53] but Joshua 65 he he said you know and it
[50:57] shall come to pass when they press that
[50:59] when they make the long blast of the ram
[51:01] horns now it was the priest that blew on
[51:03] the ram Thorns that when you hear the
[51:05] sound of the
[51:07] trumpet that just the
[51:11] ministers Oh no just the adults Oh no
[51:14] just the men oh no oh was it all the
[51:18] people including the kids all the people
[51:23] shouted with the loud Shout
[51:28] I'll tell you something right now if
[51:30] that wouldn't happened those walls would
[51:32] have never
[51:33] moved would have never they would have
[51:35] never
[51:36] moved you're wondering why walls aren't
[51:42] moving you wonder why walls aren't
[51:44] moving because you're not obeying the
[51:50] prophecy
[51:51] uhuh this was this was an order of of
[51:55] all
[51:57] participation
[51:59] amen hallelujah and the walls of the
[52:02] city s fell flat and the people ascended
[52:06] up straight there now those walls that
[52:10] fell flat now when the Bible says they
[52:12] fell flat I believe they fell
[52:16] flat but they were big enough to ride
[52:18] chariots on
[52:21] top I think there would have been a
[52:23] little for the matter would have
[52:26] no no it said
[52:29] flat flat amen God help us amen we we
[52:36] try to analyze everything I want to
[52:37] close with this last story that girl Amy
[52:40] can you turn the fans on I'm dying up
[52:42] here up here uh and it must be a hundred
[52:47] we're not in
[52:49] Uganda um here in Second Kings 5 and I
[52:53] want to close with this story and maybe
[52:54] finish with some quotes here we had
[52:57] nahem was the captain of the host of the
[53:00] king of Syria and if you drop down on
[53:02] that first verse it said that he was a
[53:05] mighty man of value but he had leprosy
[53:08] actually let me read that but he was a
[53:10] mighty
[53:11] man in the middle there it says but
[53:13] because of him the Lord had given
[53:15] Deliverance unto Syria so God had
[53:19] actually worked in his
[53:21] life
[53:24] amen but nahem had two
[53:28] battles he had two battles one battle
[53:32] was he had
[53:35] leprosy and the Second
[53:38] Battle was he was
[53:43] proud and I want to show you in this
[53:46] scripture that nahem never conquered
[53:50] that
[53:54] alone they never conquered none of the
[53:56] battles
[53:58] alone you
[54:00] see God has a plan God didn't leave us
[54:04] alone that's why he said we should not
[54:06] forsake the assembly the C together
[54:08] bring your licks of fire together and
[54:10] and and and and see we we we feed off of
[54:13] each other amen we we rub the shoulders
[54:17] with our Believers the like price is Fai
[54:20] amen how can two walk together unless
[54:22] they agree but we
[54:23] agree amen
[54:26] and here we see in nem's life that he
[54:28] had leprosy and he was hiding it like
[54:30] most people hide their sins because of
[54:32] the de City would have realized that he
[54:34] would have lost his position and lost
[54:36] his place but there was a little slave
[54:41] girl and I want to ask you something
[54:44] what was the benefit for that little
[54:45] slave girl to help n
[54:50] him absolutely nothing did she get more
[54:54] pay after
[54:56] did she get a better bed or bedroom or a
[54:59] plusher job or did she get her picture
[55:02] on the
[55:08] poster she saved nem's
[55:14] life
[55:17] life just like you'll Save a believer's
[55:19] Life by witnessing sharing the gospel
[55:23] and say this is what God did for me
[55:26] this is what God's doing in our
[55:28] time amen I don't mean you'll throw your
[55:31] pearls before the swine god'll tell you
[55:33] when you don't have to ask your pastor
[55:36] you got the Holy Ghost you'll just feel
[55:38] that little ticker go you'll see the
[55:40] door crack open a little a spat and
[55:45] you'll
[55:47] uhhuh
[55:49] amen and she said but there's the
[55:54] prophet
[55:55] and if you get to his
[55:57] word you'll be
[55:59] saved see
[56:02] how this battle wasn't
[56:05] hers and chances are if nem would have
[56:08] died she would have been closer to being
[56:10] free than if he
[56:12] lived see she was a
[56:17] slave
[56:23] huh
[56:28] see how she had the same characteristics
[56:30] of
[56:32] Christ when he left
[56:34] Glory To Die for a sinner like brother
[56:39] Dale living for
[56:41] others at all costs living forever the
[56:45] prophet said multiple multiple multiple
[56:47] times I couldn't read all the quotes
[56:49] where he said Christianity was living
[56:52] for
[56:53] others amen
[56:56] just it can be just in a
[56:59] little kindness and then we see you
[57:03] know the reaction to nahem to the
[57:06] prophet and the
[57:09] prophet uh sent his servant and nahem
[57:13] didn't like the word that God give to
[57:17] him and we've all seen that and people
[57:19] in our midst where the word will come
[57:22] forth and you'll know you'll know you
[57:25] you experienced it I'm sure in your life
[57:27] where somebody's struggling with the
[57:29] true word of God that's getting
[57:33] Clos am how do we help
[57:38] them do we avoid them that's that's how
[57:41] we help
[57:42] them do we side with them say oh I
[57:45] understand your position this is no how
[57:49] did here the servants help nak him they
[57:52] said you know th this is it's not really
[57:56] that big a deal you know you've built
[57:59] this battle in your
[58:01] mind but you know I I know it's but
[58:06] like it's it's
[58:08] just like you're going to die if you
[58:12] don't obey the message of the hour
[58:15] you're never going in the Rapture but
[58:17] like if you just you know like I I mean
[58:21] you might like the tribulation but like
[58:24] I think it be all right if you just went
[58:26] down seven
[58:29] times just just kind of like they were
[58:32] just kind of like putting butter on the
[58:35] wheel just saying you know maybe you
[58:38] should reconsider your actions
[58:43] like it's possible really that you'll be
[58:47] completely
[58:49] clean you see that see that but not us
[58:53] not us typical Message Church you know
[58:56] oh bless God I know they're in a trial
[58:58] but
[59:11] like amen I I don't say that to be you
[59:14] know but and that's not the case here
[59:18] it's this is not for us this is only
[59:21] because you you'll see at other places I
[59:25] really do I I'm I'm saying that dra I
[59:27] don't feel that from one single one of
[59:29] you here not one not not even not even a
[59:32] spe praise God Amen look at the the
[59:36] beauty of the church it's the character
[59:37] of the people and oh wow you amen that's
[59:43] that's
[59:45] amazing but see how we could guide
[59:48] people
[59:51] in they never these people never went
[59:54] back said well I wonder if we could go
[59:55] talk to the prophet and change the word
[59:59] change the prophecy or you know what I
[1:00:01] mean they they what was already laid
[1:00:03] down they just tried to encourage them
[1:00:06] in their
[1:00:09] battle you know what me I've seen it
[1:00:12] before let me give you an example I you
[1:00:14] some of you are looking at me like I'm a
[1:00:15] ghost or something I've seen it before
[1:00:17] when I was leading songs when I was
[1:00:19] young and maybe I just was I I'll say I
[1:00:22] was just right off the musician was
[1:00:25] perfect and I was like in another
[1:00:30] place and you know you'd see half the
[1:00:32] people they and the other
[1:00:36] people that really helps you fight the
[1:00:41] battle see what I'm talking
[1:00:43] about if you have any experiences
[1:00:45] sometime you should come up and Lead
[1:00:46] song sometime but what be wrong with
[1:00:48] just like doing anything just make
[1:00:53] noise I can't fix the problem I can't
[1:00:55] sing but I can stand up and smile or
[1:00:58] slap my
[1:01:01] hands
[1:01:02] I you know that and this is definitely
[1:01:05] not n of my notes do you know that it's
[1:01:08] scientifically proven the Clapping Your
[1:01:11] Hands I I even foret I read it so long
[1:01:13] ago I forget it Clapping Your Hands
[1:01:15] stimul your nervous system and rebuilds
[1:01:18] like it's it's one of the healthiest
[1:01:19] things you can do it's cling your
[1:01:23] hands
[1:01:33] it's just particip just and and and
[1:01:36] maybe the person really is doing a
[1:01:37] terrible job but but going along with it
[1:01:39] ain't going to help it I'd raise oh you
[1:01:42] know we've all heard this with me and
[1:01:44] the well me I said you know we see
[1:01:46] people before we had kids you know
[1:01:48] because we didn't have kids for a few
[1:01:50] years and we said oh I'd never do that
[1:01:51] bless God I I'll do m
[1:01:55] oh oh bless God that came
[1:01:58] back H I had somebody tell us that we
[1:02:02] probably said that about your kids they
[1:02:04] said when you have kids you have a new
[1:02:07] boss in the
[1:02:09] house it's a kid that's
[1:02:11] born well you know it's a growing
[1:02:17] process amen sometimes we just think
[1:02:20] people are all going to be the best at
[1:02:21] what they do it's a growing process we
[1:02:24] can we can we can we can support one
[1:02:27] another and and grow and in our ministry
[1:02:29] and we're actually going to come to the
[1:02:30] stue of perfect man we're going to be
[1:02:33] ready for
[1:02:35] adoption because God will actually see
[1:02:37] the character and he'll give you the pen
[1:02:39] and say you can sign the checks
[1:02:42] now because he can see the
[1:02:45] maturity and amen and it won't

[1:09:52] God that that that I I I know I
[1:09:55] mentioned that before that just blows my
[1:09:57] way to think that that I had a thought
[1:09:59] and I think you know and it went all
[1:10:02] through all the politics in heaven got
[1:10:03] right to the top and he sent it back and
[1:10:05] brother Bram had to process it in his
[1:10:08] head and speak it and it took five
[1:10:13] seconds and you don't think God can take
[1:10:16] care of your battle oh my my amen you
[1:10:21] could just we could go forever on this
[1:10:23] look at Paul and Silas in jail how did
[1:10:25] they break out of the locks and the
[1:10:27] stocks in the inner of the
[1:10:28] jail
[1:10:30] worship worship praising God I mean just
[1:10:34] go on and on and on look Peter when he
[1:10:37] was in jail and they prayed for Peter
[1:10:38] Peter come out and they thought he was a
[1:10:40] ghost and they said well we prayed but
[1:10:41] we don't believe God would ever answer
[1:10:42] our
[1:10:44] prayer you know like you serve such an
[1:10:47] amazing God that even in your unbelief
[1:10:49] God still answered the prayer that's
[1:10:52] unbelievable
[1:10:54] but it's true and God gives you these
[1:10:56] beautiful examples and we just oh well
[1:10:58] that's a nice story no that's that
[1:11:01] actually
[1:11:02] happened they actually prayed they had
[1:11:05] no belief that God would answer the
[1:11:07] prayer and they confessed that he was a
[1:11:09] ghost at the door and the people when
[1:11:11] they come back the girl come back and
[1:11:12] said there's no way that happened
[1:11:13] Peter's in
[1:11:16] Joe but your
[1:11:19] Jehovah your Jehovah could pass over
[1:11:21] your even unbelief
