[8:10] It is our pastor's birthday tomorrow.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; And we wanted to thank our Lord Jesus
[8:15] Christ for his life.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; And for what Jesus has called Pastor
[8:20] Dale to do.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; As we know, that's not an easy road.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; Bless him.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; We want to thank the Lord for the love
[8:27] he has put in Pastor Dale's heart, not
[8:31] only for our congregation, but to all of
[8:33] those outside of these four walls.
[8:36] And we want to thank the Lord for how
[8:38] Pastor Dale is always in search of God's
[8:41] truth in God's word and standing for the
[8:44] truth no matter what those consequences
[8:46] may be.
[8:49] He's always also humbled himself and
[8:51] he's been very transparent, sometimes
[8:54] even revealing his own thoughts that he
[8:56] battles with. And it's encouraging to me
[8:58] because I I go through the same. And we
[9:02] also want to thank the Lord for all his
[9:04] time and sacrifices along with his his
[9:07] wife, sister Lanne, to help those in
[9:10] need. Yes.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; When I think about how much they have
[9:13] been there for me and my family in the
[9:16] last year, it truly brings me to tears
[9:20] and I truly thank God for the both of
[9:24] them.
[9:27] And in honor of our pastor's birthday,
[9:29] we are going to sing Consider the Liies
[9:32] as it's one of his favorite songs.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; We pray it blesses you.
[9:53] They don't
[9:55] nor
[10:02] with more splendor
[10:15] for soul. Oh my
[10:20] master
[10:21] who watches.

[11:33] to be
[11:36] together

[13:55] Praise his name. That song is very, very
[13:57] humbling. Amen. Amen. Well, thank you,
[14:00] girls. But, uh, that was wonderful. But
[14:03] man, we're going to invite Brother Jeff.
[14:05] He's got a song for us this morning.
[14:07] Just uh very much uh enjoy brother Jeff
[14:10] and the family and and
[14:14] thank you.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Praise his name.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; He sung for us last week when we were at
[14:22] his house. So, it's a it's a song he
[14:25] wrote, I believe. But, uh and just uh
[14:29] just very good to have him with us, man.
[14:34] Jesus.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:47] Just going to make sure my guitar is in
[14:49] in tune here.
[14:52] Amen. Blessed
[14:55] &gt;&gt; in Psalm 61,
[14:59] Jesus read uh Psalm 61 and said this
[15:02] this scripture is fulfilled in your
[15:04] hearing.
[15:06] And
[15:08] &gt;&gt; the go I love the beginning of Psalm 61
[15:11] because what we see there, the gospel
[15:15] brings transformation.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; If it
[15:18] &gt;&gt; from darkness to light, lost to found.
[15:22] from alienated to reconciled.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus came to do.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; And uh
[15:30] it says this. It says, "The spirit of
[15:32] the Lord God is upon me because he has
[15:34] anointed me
[15:35] &gt;&gt; to preach good tidings to the poor. He
[15:38] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
[15:40] &gt;&gt; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
[15:43] the opening of the prison to those who
[15:45] are bound. Amen.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; To proclaim the acceptable year of the
[15:48] Lord in the day of vengeance our our
[15:52] God. To comfort all who mourn. To
[15:56] console those who mourn in Zion. To give
[15:58] them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy
[16:02] for mourning. The garment of praise for
[16:06] the spirit of heaviness.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; The Lord brings that kind of
[16:10] transformation. And then they go on and
[16:12] they become trees of righteousness, a
[16:14] planting of the Lord that he may be
[16:16] glorified.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; So anyway, there's a there's a song I
[16:22] wrote and I want to I' been asked to
[16:24] come share it and uh it's just from
[16:27] that. Put on a garment of praise for the
[16:30] spirit of heaviness. Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; And we know that uh there's a lot of
[16:35] people that deal with heaviness or
[16:36] depression,
[16:38] &gt;&gt; but the Lord's provided the way up, the
[16:41] way out,
[16:42] &gt;&gt; something to overcome that.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; So, here we go.
[16:53] Heat. Heat.
[17:16] Heat. Heat.
[17:31] Heat. Heat.
[17:53] Heat. Heat.

[20:47] we don't lift him up, who will? Amen.

[27:23] thank you for your amazing presence in
[27:26] our lives and in this place, Lord God.
[27:30] Lord, I pray you'll bless your children,
[27:32] Lord God, your bride,
[27:35] ones that have come, Lord God, in cold
[27:38] day. And Lord, we love you. That's this
[27:42] just we love you, Lord God. There's no
[27:45] other but you
[27:48] help us, Jesus.
[27:51] Bless these beautiful people that you
[27:54] purchased with your very own blood.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:02] Oh God, we pray that you're in this
[28:04] place and in our hearts, no matter where
[28:06] we walk,
[28:08] may our light be so bright and way we be
[28:12] so salty that the world will run
[28:15] &gt;&gt; for a drink of your Holy Spirit to us.
[28:18] Run to the water of life,
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[28:24] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen.

[30:34] amazing. Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, sister Domin.
[30:38] The girls and brother Jeff. I love
[30:41] Brother. I love songs out of the
[30:43] scriptures. That's just amazing.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Psalms is full of just beautiful psalms,
[30:48] right? Just right out of God's word is
[30:50] just amazing.
[30:52] Amen. Maybe we'll just uh Thank you,
[30:55] honey. Yeah. Yeah.
[30:58] Maybe we'll just turn to uh to his word
[31:02] today.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you for coming. And I wasn't
[31:07] really sure
[31:09] what was going to happen, but we live in
[31:11] Canada.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; This is this is fairly normal.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; I walked outside in my garage and I
[31:16] said,
[31:17] &gt;&gt; "It's January."
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:22] Amen.
[31:24] John 17
[31:27] 9 and 10.
[31:30] Just want to carry on the same
[31:33] same uh thought. We read our scripture.
[31:36] I might give just a little testimony.
[31:39] Man,
[31:42] this is Jesus talking here. This is
[31:45] amazing.
[31:47] And I prayed for them. And I pray not
[31:49] for the world,
[31:51] but for them which thou hast given me.
[31:55] For they are mine,
[31:59] and all are mine are thine, and thine
[32:04] are mine, and I am glorified in them.
[32:07] Just one more scripture. Ephesians or
[32:10] sorry, Hebrews 13. Hebrews 13 and8. a
[32:14] really common scripture that we know and
[32:17] I just I'm going to just testify a
[32:19] second before
[32:21] just a little shout out to the parents.
[32:23] I enjoy the kids in the alleyway. We're
[32:26] not opposed to walking the alleyways or
[32:29] even running the alleyways if they're
[32:31] blessed. They don't scare God. God loves
[32:36] children.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; They definitely don't scare me. Amen. If
[32:40] the kids are Amen. We could use a few
[32:44] adults in the alleyway sometimes.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be a lot easier to preach.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[32:54] and forever. Amen. Amen. God bless his
[32:58] word. And you may have your seats. Amen.
[33:00] Amen. I just before I preach, I just
[33:02] want to say
[33:05] uh just a couple things and just uh uh
[33:09] you know uh it seems like we're almost
[33:10] still in a New Year's Eve mode cuz we
[33:12] never really New Year's Eve we had a lot
[33:15] of snow and and that but uh uh you know
[33:18] anything that's truth
[33:21] is under attack. The Bible said
[33:24] repeatedly that if you were persecuted
[33:27] for truth that you were in good company
[33:30] because Jesus was and all the prophets
[33:32] they killed or stoned.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; So everything that's truth and we're
[33:37] living in an age where everything is
[33:40] gray. There's no but that's not true
[33:44] &gt;&gt; because the Bible talks about when the
[33:46] age comes that they call good evil.
[33:52] Y
[33:53] &gt;&gt; and they call evil good.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; It's a great sinful time.
[34:01] Amen. A great sinful time. Now, I don't
[34:04] mean we're sinful, but I mean the age,
[34:06] the thing, the situation around us, the
[34:08] atmosphere around us. And uh and so
[34:13] uh yesterday we had we had a beautiful
[34:16] day. Brother Jeff and Sister Dama and
[34:18] different ones can buy the kids some and
[34:21] but uh the beginning of the day I was
[34:24] communicating with brother Osman and and
[34:26] what sister Dama said is very true
[34:28] because Len carries as much pressure of
[34:32] the pastorship or more than I do
[34:36] &gt;&gt; because she's part of me.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; She's part of me.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; She's not just my wife. She's my rib.
[34:46] She's my flesh
[34:47] &gt;&gt; like you're part of God.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; That's what God said.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; God said, "Let us make you in my image."
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; And so, our church personally here was
[34:59] under a great attack September 21st. I I
[35:03] don't really understand why, but I know
[35:05] that anything that is truthful
[35:07] &gt;&gt; is under attack. And you can draw great
[35:10] hope that anything that rises against
[35:13] you
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. to hurt you will never prosper.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Will never ever prosper. But we were
[35:21] under a great attack on that uh day
[35:25] inside and outside the church. Amen.
[35:29] There was people that didn't like our
[35:30] video outside the church and is now
[35:33] posting us as false liars.
[35:36] And and uh it's something when God's
[35:39] Bible becomes a false liar.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; And there's people inside our church.
[35:44] was calling us false liars.
[35:47] Amen. And so, uh, God, just God help us.
[35:50] We're living in a peculiar God help you.
[35:52] God help me. Amen. God, but God is God.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear. Amen. And so, I
[35:58] want to just show you something, you
[35:59] know, before we start. And and like our
[36:02] whole absolute this morning is the
[36:05] Bible. It's Christ. You know, John 1:1
[36:08] said that in the beginning was the word.
[36:11] Amen. And God become the word and the
[36:14] word was with God and the word was God.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; That's it. This is what we believe in
[36:19] our Bible.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; It's the Bible. Now, we understand that
[36:23] some of the things in the Old Testament
[36:26] like the Sabbath, Jesus said, "I'm the
[36:28] Lord of the Sabbath."
[36:30] &gt;&gt; So, when the when the religious people
[36:32] came and accused, can you imagine tried
[36:35] to accuse Jesus for picking corn on the
[36:38] Sabbath? He said, "What are you talking
[36:39] about? It's not a day.
[36:41] The Holy Spirit is your Sabbath.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; I'm God.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; I'm your rest.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; I'm totally your rest.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; But you know, Revelations talk about
[36:51] that we can't add nothing to this
[36:54] &gt;&gt; or take nothing away from this. And
[36:58] &gt;&gt; at all.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; So I had somebody just actually after
[37:02] our service last Sunday, he said, "Well,
[37:03] I don't believe the Old Testament."
[37:06] Well, I feel sorry for you. You're
[37:08] probably in the wrong church.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Because there's things in
[37:11] the Old Testament for us.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; I know we're in the grace dispensation.
[37:16] Yes. Understand? But we don't throw out
[37:18] the old we don't throw the things we
[37:19] don't like.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to ask you a personal
[37:24] question this morning. You can all put
[37:26] in your head. Which is your favorite
[37:28] book in the Bible?
[37:32] Favorite verse?
[37:35] You you you got it all in your head now?
[37:37] &gt;&gt; What's your favorite verse? Jesus never
[37:40] wrote it.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; A person wrote it anointed by God.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; That's the same as this morning.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not Jesus.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; But if I'm anointed by Jesus and I'm
[37:52] preaching the Bible,
[37:55] &gt;&gt; it was wrote by people under the
[37:57] influence of Jesus.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; You see,
[38:00] &gt;&gt; so I would quote anybody from this
[38:02] pulpit
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; that is backing up the word of God.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Any person, brother, sister,
[38:09] child, preacher, anybody, anybody that
[38:13] dovetales with this Bible.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; You can love, you know, let me give you
[38:18] an example. I got a perfect example here
[38:20] right now and and then then we're
[38:22] actually going to preach. I was just all
[38:23] free, but Hebrews 13, I want to read
[38:25] three scriptures. I read one of them
[38:28] and most of us really love verse 8.
[38:32] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[38:34] and forever. That's the God I serve.
[38:36] Yes.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Because if God ever did it in the past,
[38:39] he can do it today.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't serve a weak God. He
[38:44] didn't He didn't fall to sleep. He's not
[38:45] tired. He ain't cold. He's God is a
[38:48] spirit. And those that worship him must
[38:50] worship him in spirit and truth.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. So So most people when you'd read
[38:54] Hebrews 13:8, they go, "Woo,
[38:58] &gt;&gt; beautiful."
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Most of us would have that memorized,
[39:05] &gt;&gt; right? Now, most scholars would believe
[39:10] that Paul probably wrote Hebrews.
[39:13] Paul wrote most of the New Testament.
[39:15] Now, if he didn't write Hebrews, some
[39:18] say that it was a follower of Paul,
[39:20] somebody that came up after Paul.
[39:23] But let's read this verse just above
[39:25] eight. It's not near as popular.
[39:28] Remember them that have the rule over
[39:30] you, for they have spoken unto you the
[39:32] word of God. Uh-oh. Oh, don't believe
[39:36] that one.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; No,
[39:38] &gt;&gt; that must be an Old Testament scripture.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz we don't believe the Old Testament.
[39:42] But we don't believe the ones that we
[39:44] don't want to believe.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; For they spoke the word of God unto you.
[39:48] That's like the people that are on the
[39:49] internet and they say, "Well, you know,
[39:52] I mean, if we preach against sin and
[39:54] your conscience condemns you and you're
[39:57] a sinner, now you post you post pictures
[39:59] of our church website and say they
[40:01] preached against sin." What was I
[40:03] supposed to preach against? Yeah.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; What was I supposed to preach against?
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. No. Okay. Then we read, you know,
[40:13] read verse eight again. That'll make you
[40:14] strong again. Jesus Christ the same
[40:16] yesterday, today, and forever. Now, this
[40:18] is the same person that read this. Let's
[40:20] drop to verse 17.
[40:24] Obey them that have the rule over you.
[40:26] Why is he repeating that the same
[40:27] person?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; You know, I want to tell you something.
[40:32] I'm going to give you just like a like a
[40:34] commercial break. Anytime I repeat to my
[40:36] kids, they said, "You already told me
[40:37] that."
[40:39] You already told me that once. What do
[40:41] you tell me again?
[40:44] &gt;&gt; God does it all the time.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; He don't want you to forget it. What did
[40:48] Peter say? I bring these things into
[40:50] remembrance
[40:52] &gt;&gt; for your mind. Amen. Remembrance. I If I
[40:54] something new, you better get out of
[40:56] this place.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; I can just bring it into remembrance the
[40:59] things you already know.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Watch this. But this c this scripture
[41:03] ain't near as popular to the people that
[41:06] want to pick and choose the Bible.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Obey them that have the rule over you
[41:10] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[41:14] your souls
[41:16] &gt;&gt; as they must give an account
[41:19] &gt;&gt; not for themselves
[41:21] &gt;&gt; but for you.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; I had somebody that came here in the
[41:25] past said this was the government. I
[41:27] said I never knew Trudeau was watching
[41:29] for my soul.
[41:31] I'm going to have to give him a raise.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; So, I just just laying a foundation. We
[41:44] believe the Bible.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; But we don't just believe the parts you
[41:47] think are popular.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I can show you where God put it
[41:52] in the Bible and you don't want to
[41:54] believe it, then show me where God took
[41:56] it outside of the Bible.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you can't show me where God
[42:01] took it outside the Bible,
[42:03] &gt;&gt; then you're not a believer.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; See, the Bible is just for believers.
[42:09] That might surprise you,
[42:11] &gt;&gt; but it's not wrote for unbelievers
[42:14] &gt;&gt; cuz they don't believe.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; It is impossible for you to have faith
[42:20] &gt;&gt; to believe that that without faith, it's
[42:23] impossible for you to please God. And
[42:26] you must believe that he is the rewarder
[42:28] of those that diligently seek him.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; And you can't have faith unless you
[42:32] believe that Jesus Christ was sent by
[42:35] God.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; So if you don't believe Jesus Christ
[42:41] came to die for my sins,
[42:44] then you're not a believer.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; You might sit in the church.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; You might send all your money to the
[42:51] poor people, but that don't make you a
[42:53] believer.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; No. No. Yeah.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Here Paul in Galatians just just laying
[43:04] a bit of a foundation before we get
[43:05] right into our examples of meeting Jesus
[43:08] face to face. You know, when we meet
[43:10] Jesus face to face, we won't take out
[43:12] parts of the Bible
[43:14] &gt;&gt; because Jesus is the Bible.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I marvel Galatians 1:6. And I
[43:22] marvel that ye are so soon moved from
[43:24] the grace of Christ unto another gospel.
[43:29] Was it wasn't the Bible gospel. This is
[43:31] Paul talking.
[43:34] And he said, "Which is not another,
[43:38] but there is some among us that trouble
[43:43] and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Watch this. September 21. There was some
[43:50] among us that perverted
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; the real gospel.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Into their own interpretation.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Watch what Paul says. But though we or
[44:04] an angel from heaven preach any other
[44:07] gospel unto you than that which I have
[44:10] preached, let him be a
[44:16] &gt;&gt; By the way, this was Paul doing
[44:17] preaching. But God had given him the
[44:19] revelation of the written word in the
[44:21] spirit.
[44:23] And it was God anointing him to write
[44:24] this. And as ye and as we have said
[44:27] before, watch this. Remember what I
[44:29] said? My kids say, "You told me that
[44:30] once before." Here's God, right? Again,
[44:33] repeating it. I'm going to have to start
[44:35] saying because God does.
[44:38] And as we have said before, well, you
[44:40] already told me that.
[44:43] So say I again.
[44:46] Now this must be important.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; If a man preach any other gospel unto
[44:53] you other than what ye have received,
[45:01] &gt;&gt; let them be a curse.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; That's fairly straightforward.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just jump down to Judges and
[45:12] get into our texts. And we want to look
[45:14] at some examples and and uh you know,
[45:17] we'll just see where God takes us. And
[45:19] we got some promises at the end to uh uh
[45:23] you know to to to uh to uh to give us
[45:27] great hope in that. And again, I want to
[45:29] say I really really enjoyed the worship
[45:31] service and both specials were
[45:35] &gt;&gt; were supernatural, beautiful, very very
[45:38] beautiful. And you know a church is not
[45:41] about the pastor. A church is about a
[45:44] family.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; We're not worshiping me.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; I'm just one of you,
[45:51] &gt;&gt; man. If the kids got a special, they
[45:53] should sing it.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; That's part of worship.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; That's part of church.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; If God anoints you and you get blessed,
[46:01] cry, or stand up or run the aisles or
[46:03] swirl or
[46:05] &gt;&gt; or your kids walk around,
[46:07] &gt;&gt; it's fine.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. See, we want
[46:12] what God wants. I want what God wants
[46:15] for me.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Not just today, but in my life.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we see here that Samson, I'm
[46:23] going to tell you something that will
[46:24] just shock you. We know all of Samson's
[46:26] life, and he had a few difficulties in
[46:28] his life.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; He liked women.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; He liked wicked women.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; And he had a few of them.
[46:41] But I'm going to shock you and I got
[46:42] scripture for it. Samson
[46:47] in that state
[46:49] was a prisoner of Christ.
[46:57] You say
[46:58] God unbelief don't hinder God. The
[47:01] prophet said that
[47:03] &gt;&gt; unbelief don't hinder God. And God knew
[47:05] before he called you
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; that you would make mistakes.
[47:10] God knew before he called me in my uh
[47:14] office that that there would be times
[47:16] that I would give my wife a hard time
[47:18] and have to go back and apologize cuz
[47:20] the pressure was so great.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] And so we see here, let's just read uh
[47:28] Judges 169. And and here uh he's with
[47:32] Delilah and Samson slept on his knee and
[47:35] she caused him to shave off the seven
[47:37] locks. Well, Samson was was uh you know,
[47:41] it was a chosen of God and and these
[47:43] locks were a a a covenant, you know, an
[47:46] Azarite covenant. And uh this was a that
[47:50] the Israel had been overrun and they
[47:52] were prisoners in their own land and and
[47:55] hostages for many years because they had
[47:57] disobeyed God. You know, I want to just
[47:59] show you something. Even with Saul, I'm
[48:01] jumping way ahead, but you know, it's
[48:03] obedience is fairly important. You know,
[48:05] when we say we obey the Bible, God makes
[48:07] a big deal about that.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; You know, Saul didn't make out too well
[48:10] when he didn't obey. When you go fight
[48:12] the Amorites, kill them.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Kill them.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; If you got some demons in your life, you
[48:21] better kill them.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; If that's what God tells you to do,
[48:25] &gt;&gt; struggles.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; And you know, we're going to look in
[48:29] that. But, you know, like the Bible is a
[48:32] paradox. And I couldn't begin to answer
[48:35] all the paradox of God because I only
[48:37] have a three-pound brain and God's
[48:39] omnipotent.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. God God's eternal. He's omnipotent
[48:44] and and he's awesome. And so when you
[48:47] hear somebody try to tell you every
[48:49] speck of God and like say, "Well, I got
[48:52] it all figured out." Well,
[48:54] don't laugh in front of them.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; You know, laugh behind them. if
[49:00] &gt;&gt; because I believe God has taken the
[49:02] mysteries in this day and and the Bible
[49:04] is a new book and it's revealed to us.
[49:07] But the Bible says that someday we'll
[49:10] see him face to face and we'll recognize
[49:13] the son of Jehovah
[49:16] &gt;&gt; and you won't hold it together when you
[49:18] walk in his presence.
[49:21] When you realize that the King of Kings
[49:23] left the splendor of heaven
[49:26] &gt;&gt; to come to earth
[49:28] &gt;&gt; to die for a sinner boy like Dale.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; I want to read you how I can say that
[49:41] Samson was a prisoner to Christ and all
[49:45] of his mistakes. See, some people don't
[49:48] want to follow somebody that's a human.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know my mistakes.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; But watch what God says in Judges 13,
[50:03] we're in a different chapter than 16. In
[50:05] Judges 13:3 and5, "And the angel of the
[50:08] Lord appeared unto a woman, and said
[50:11] unto her, Behold, now thou art barren,
[50:14] and thou beest not, but thou shalt
[50:16] conceive and bear a son." Now, let me
[50:19] just tell you what, every one of you,
[50:21] you didn't get your commission from the
[50:23] pastor. You got your Holy Ghost from
[50:25] God.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; You got your commission from God. This
[50:28] ain't a Catholic church where you got to
[50:30] come before a priest. you you do got to
[50:32] come before a priest, but it's the
[50:34] priest up there. The priest, the king of
[50:36] kings and king of glory.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; So, an angel of the Lord came to this
[50:42] woman in verse four. And now, therefore,
[50:45] beware. Now, he's commanding the woman,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; not the son that's going to come.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And he said, now therefore, beware, I
[50:54] pray thee,
[50:57] drink not wine, nor strong drink, and
[50:59] eat neither an unclean thing. Now, now I
[51:02] want to just clarify this was the orders
[51:05] from the angel in this situation from
[51:09] heaven.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; And lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a
[51:15] son, and no razor shall come upon his
[51:18] head.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Okay, now remember what I said. Samson
[51:22] and all of his faults
[51:26] &gt;&gt; was a prison Christ.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Right here it is. For the child shall be
[51:32] a Nazerite
[51:34] unto this church.
[51:36] No, no, no, no. Unto God.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; He shall be a Nazerite unto God.
[51:46] God is the boss in case you forgot.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; From the womb,
[51:51] and he shall begin to deliver Israel out
[51:56] of the hands of the Philistines.
[52:00] Yeah.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Period.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; God used Samson's
[52:07] God was called or Samson, sorry, was
[52:11] called of God, specially ordained,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; a chosen vessel
[52:17] that had loads of shortcomings.
[52:22] But even our prophet said that it was in
[52:24] in his shortcomings,
[52:27] it was God that was able to manifest the
[52:30] glory.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Remember Israel had a lot of
[52:33] shortcomings?
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Remember how God said to to Moses, he
[52:37] said, "Pharaoh, I is this hard to
[52:40] believe? Do you know God could harden
[52:42] somebody's heart? Why would he do that?"
[52:47] Like, I can't explain that why he would.
[52:49] But the Bible says so he got glory.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; God loves
[52:55] &gt;&gt; glory.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; God loves He won't give it to nobody
[52:59] else.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That's why if you worship a big pastor
[53:02] or a TV evangelist or a prophet or a
[53:05] anybody. There's one God.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. And he deserves the glory
[53:10] and the honor and the praise and
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; And the rest of us are a family
[53:18] &gt;&gt; in different positions.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Y that's right.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I don't even mind washing the dishes
[53:23] when it's this cold cuz I don't have to
[53:24] go outside.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Give me the broom,
[53:27] honey. I'm not going to the tractor.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] Yeah.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; And watch this in verse 27 of 16 of
[53:43] Judges. And the Philistines, this is
[53:46] what needs to, you know, most of the
[53:48] time. And you know, I went to the
[53:51] Philistines took Samson.
[53:53] I'm just jumping through this. You know
[53:56] the story, and put out his physical
[54:01] eyes.
[54:03] I want to show you something that when
[54:05] you really die out to Christ, like Paul
[54:09] said in the Bible, it's no longer I that
[54:10] liveth, but Christ that liveth in me.
[54:13] You won't come and say, "Well, I don't
[54:14] believe."
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, I I got to I got a Have
[54:20] you ever heard a dead man talk?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; No.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; It's no longer I that liveth
[54:25] &gt;&gt; but Christ.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. It's no longer I liveth.
[54:31] So, I'm dead.
[54:33] But if you're really dead, you're not
[54:35] talking.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; It's God's anointing and God's spirit
[54:40] that's on. It's Christ that liveth in
[54:42] me.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they plucked out his eyes.
[54:49] And that's when Samson could concentrate
[54:52] on God.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; He couldn't look at wicked women then.
[55:00] Yeah,
[55:01] &gt;&gt; cuz he didn't have ice.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; And where I got this that Samson was a
[55:09] prisoner is is in the end of verse 21 is
[55:13] and they took him to the grinder mill in
[55:17] the prison house.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; And you know, you may be in the prison
[55:21] house in a grinder mill grinding for
[55:24] somebody that's attacking you,
[55:27] but it'll never prosper. Yeah.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; I want just give you just a a commercial
[55:31] break that every kingdom will fall but
[55:34] God's kingdom.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And you can attack God's work inside the
[55:41] church and outside the church and post
[55:44] it on Facebook and all that
[55:47] &gt;&gt; and I feel very scared for you.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Very scared. I pray for mercy.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:56] Help us, father.
[55:58] You know the people in the Bible that
[56:00] came to Peter and lied before the Holy
[56:03] Spirit, God killed them.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; That quick.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Now, we just read the scripture that
[56:13] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[56:15] and forever. God don't like when you're
[56:17] lying about his wife, his bride, his
[56:20] Christian people.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. God don't like when
[56:24] people lie about the bloodbought
[56:26] purchase of the lamb that he paid for.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Pray for mercy on those people.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Because good things won't happen to
[56:36] them.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Watch that. That's Bible. God's a just
[56:43] God. Vengeance is mine, sayaeth the
[56:47] Lord.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; You can't mock God and think it's going
[56:51] to go good for you. No, no.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Here, Samson was in the prison house
[56:56] working for God.
[56:58] And I want to give you great hope this
[57:00] morning that you can be in your prison
[57:02] house and the pressure can come in. You
[57:04] know, before the rapture, there's going
[57:05] to be a certain amount of pressure. You
[57:08] know, the world's kind of went goo.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; But what Satan forgot was that St.
[57:18] Samson's hair in verse 22. How be it
[57:24] that his hair
[57:26] of his head began to grow again
[57:30] after he was shaven. You see Samson's
[57:34] covenant, now this is a unique
[57:36] situation, but Samson's covenant was in
[57:39] his hair
[57:42] &gt;&gt; and his power was in his hair.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; And
[57:48] for sinful reasons, he told his secret
[57:52] and he lost all his power.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; But even in his weakness,
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; God was still alive.
[58:02] Yeah.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; And his hair started growing. And the
[58:06] people in the prison house when he was
[58:08] grinding the flower didn't realize
[58:12] &gt;&gt; that his hair wasn't shaved anymore.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And Samson in verse 22 28, sorry. And
[58:20] Samson called unto the Lord and said,
[58:21] "Oh Lord, redeem me, I pray thee,
[58:26] and strengthen me. I pray they only
[58:31] this once.
[58:33] Samson met Jesus Christ face to face.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; See, Samson knew who to call out for.
[58:43] Samson knew where his strength come
[58:45] from.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Samson knew what it would take.
[58:50] And you know the story. Let's read
[58:52] second Corinthians. He killed Samson
[58:55] killed more in his death than he did in
[58:58] his whole lifetime working for God.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said
[59:05] unto me, "My grace is sufficient for
[59:08] thee, for my strength,
[59:12] that's not my strength,
[59:16] is made perfect in weakness. Yeah.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Must gladly therefore will I rather
[59:23] glory in my infirmities. You know what
[59:26] the infirmities is? Shortcomings,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; mistakes.
[59:32] Said the wrong thing fell down.
[59:36] Here Paul and Corinthians saying, "I
[59:38] would rather gladly glory in my
[59:40] infirmities that the power
[59:48] of Christ may rest upon me.
[59:52] Samson had some infirmities.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Samson definitely had some shortcomings.
[1:00:02] But in Samson's weakness
[1:00:05] and in Samson's
[1:00:07] terrible state,
[1:00:10] God was made strong in his weakness.
[1:00:13] Amen. For my strength is made perfect
[1:00:17] in weakness. Ain't that power? That's a
[1:00:20] great promise. You can say, "What am I
[1:00:23] doing for God?" Or like, "How how does I
[1:00:25] fit in your weakness?"
[1:00:28] God's moving mountains in your weakness.
[1:00:32] God's doing things that you can't even
[1:00:35] comprehend or see.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just jump ahead quickly here
[1:00:42] and we'll go on to Second Kings 2 and
[1:00:44] show you another one. Elisha. Elisha was
[1:00:47] an amazing prophet in the Bible. And and
[1:00:50] here he he come up. Elijah came up under
[1:00:52] Elijah. Elisha.
[1:00:55] And it came to pass in verse 9 that when
[1:00:58] they were gone over that Elijah said
[1:01:00] unto Elisha, "Ask what I can do for thee
[1:01:03] before I am taken away from thee." And
[1:01:05] Elisha said, "I pray thee, let a double
[1:01:09] portion of thy spirit fall upon me."
[1:01:12] Now, I just want to show you something.
[1:01:13] This is how the Bible's wrote. But
[1:01:15] understand, the Bible's wrote in a
[1:01:17] mystery. This wasn't Elijah's power.
[1:01:22] No,
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; this was God's power in Elisha.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Eli Elisha wasn't saying, "I want to be
[1:01:29] just like you, Elijah." No, he said, "I
[1:01:32] want double of God what you got."
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] And verse 11, this is amazing how
[1:01:44] Elisha,
[1:01:46] Elijah, seeing Christ face
[1:01:51] to face.
[1:01:53] Verse 11. And it came to pass while they
[1:01:55] still went on the way talking and living
[1:01:58] their normal life, coming to Wyoming on
[1:02:00] a snowy day, that behold, there appeared
[1:02:03] a chariot of fire. Did they ask for a
[1:02:06] chariot of fire?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:02:11] and horses a pirate. And they both and a
[1:02:16] parted both of them aunderder. And
[1:02:19] Elijah went up in a whirlwind
[1:02:22] into heaven.
[1:02:26] And Elisha saw it
[1:02:30] and he saw the face of Christ and he
[1:02:33] cried, "My father, my father, the
[1:02:36] chariots of Israel
[1:02:38] and the horsemen
[1:02:40] thereof." Do you know? I want to show
[1:02:42] you something, saints. You know, and
[1:02:43] most of you do, maybe all. But you know,
[1:02:47] God comes down to earth in many
[1:02:49] different symbols.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; God came in the pillar of fire.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; They're in the upper room. He came down
[1:02:55] in the cloud. When he stopped when the
[1:02:57] the Egyptians came after Israel, it was
[1:02:59] a fire by night and a cloud by day.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Who was that? They couldn't go through.
[1:03:04] It wasn't a strong army.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the Russian army.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; No, it was God.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; God was a fire at night. They couldn't
[1:03:14] go through it. They tried.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; But he was a cloud of day. I can drive
[1:03:18] through clouds,
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; but not a God cloud. No.
[1:03:27] And God came down in a chariot of fire
[1:03:29] and horses of fire, but he took him up
[1:03:31] in a whirlwind,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; a cloud.
[1:03:39] And if you jump to
[1:03:42] verse 14, and Elisha took the mantle of
[1:03:45] Elisha that had fell from him, and he
[1:03:48] smoked the waters, and he said, "Where
[1:03:51] is the God
[1:03:53] of Elisha?"
[1:03:55] Why didn't he just say, "Where's God?"
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes people have trouble
[1:04:04] following
[1:04:06] a man of God.
[1:04:09] I love it when the Bible says a man of
[1:04:13] God.
[1:04:14] I pray someday God will say that about
[1:04:16] you and me.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you right now, if you're a
[1:04:22] believer,
[1:04:23] he will.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Not maybe.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; He will.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is the God of Elisha?"
[1:04:34] Because Elisha
[1:04:36] had said saw God in Elijah.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; You know, we're living in a headless age
[1:04:47] anymore.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I don't mean you guys are. I'm just
[1:04:50] saying the spirit in the world.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Nobody wants to get married.
[1:04:55] Bless God, I'm the boss.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; That that's just that's just facts. I
[1:05:00] mean, people get married when they're 40
[1:05:02] and then 95% get divorced. Not not
[1:05:05] believers. I mean, in the world.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Well, like we want equal. How do you you
[1:05:12] know, see, nobody wants headship.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to sit under any
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; but everybody watch this worships
[1:05:24] something.
[1:05:26] Yeah.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; If you don't worship God, you worship
[1:05:30] Satan.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; And how you worship, I don't mean we
[1:05:34] don't worship I'm not talking about
[1:05:35] worshiping people. That's that's sin.
[1:05:37] That's of the devil.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; But you watch the people that worship
[1:05:41] the devil. They'll lay out 200 bucks to
[1:05:44] go to a rock concert and hear somebody
[1:05:47] go,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; "Yeah, that's right."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; You know what they're doing? They're
[1:05:52] paying their tithe.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; That sure are
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; to Lucifer.
[1:05:56] Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; If you don't think you worship God,
[1:06:04] you'll worship your car that'll rust out
[1:06:06] really quick
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; or your husband or wife that might
[1:06:11] disappoint you. If it's me, it's all the
[1:06:14] time. And uh or
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; but God won't disappoint you. Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; But God,
[1:06:25] I feel very sorry for people
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; that just can't
[1:06:33] see God.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; I see God everywhere.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; It don't make you weak because you see
[1:06:42] God everywhere.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; It gives you eternal strength.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Unbelievable strength.
[1:06:50] Elisha
[1:06:52] seeing God
[1:06:54] face to face. Amen. Let's go to Second
[1:06:57] Samuel and and and we're doing good for
[1:06:59] our time. 2 Samuel 6,
[1:07:03] we see and I mentioned this maybe a
[1:07:05] couple weeks just in passing because I
[1:07:06] was studying this message two, three
[1:07:08] weeks ago. But here we see that David
[1:07:12] met God face to face. David was a man
[1:07:15] after God's own heart. Amazing. Look at
[1:07:17] the David was a a murderer and an
[1:07:21] adulteress.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And he was a man after God's own heart.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; I couldn't have sat under David's
[1:07:29] pastorship.
[1:07:31] I would have had to get converted.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; do you know do you know that when David
[1:07:38] committed adultery with Basheba
[1:07:41] that that uh who was the husband there?
[1:07:43] Uh
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Ariah. Ariah's family had to sit in
[1:07:46] David's church. I couldn't have done it,
[1:07:49] brother Jeff. I would have left. I would
[1:07:52] have said that.
[1:07:54] I would have said a couple things.
[1:07:58] Yeah. Yeah. I would have said, Do you
[1:07:59] know the same Bible says that if
[1:08:02] somebody touches your wife or husband
[1:08:03] that there's no forgiveness for that?
[1:08:06] That you'll never get forgiveness for
[1:08:07] that. The Bible says that
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; for if another man takes your wife, the
[1:08:12] man will never forgive you. That's from
[1:08:13] the Bible. Yeah,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; that's exactly what David did.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And God come up and said, "I love you so
[1:08:21] much. You're a man after my own heart."
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Uh, that'll take about a day to explain
[1:08:31] that one.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; But I can give you the short version.
[1:08:36] David knew how to repent.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Yep. When D when the prophet came to
[1:08:41] David and he said, "You are that man,
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Lord."
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Before David was going to kill that man,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; it would have had to been himself.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; See how easy it is for everybody to pick
[1:09:01] out everybody else's mistakes?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Bless God. We need blinders.
[1:09:07] I think sometime, you know, maybe in the
[1:09:09] future, Brother Lord, we might pass out
[1:09:11] like dark sunglasses with like uh the
[1:09:13] frosting on them so you can't see
[1:09:15] through them and with side things like
[1:09:16] for the horses
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; and then if Brother Dale does something
[1:09:20] wrong, you won't see or hear it.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:09:35] But when David
[1:09:38] here in verse
[1:09:40] 12, I believe it is, it must be the
[1:09:42] part. So David went and brought up the
[1:09:44] ark of God from the house of Oadiah, I
[1:09:48] believe it is, into the house of David
[1:09:50] with gladness. And verse 15 in 2 Samuel
[1:09:54] 6,
[1:09:56] and so David and all the house of Israel
[1:09:59] brought up the ark with quietness.
[1:10:03] They weren't excited that God was in
[1:10:05] their midst.
[1:10:07] They didn't worship very much. They just
[1:10:09] put their hand up a little bit.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; They worshiped the Lord with shoutings
[1:10:20] and with the sounds of the trumpet.
[1:10:22] David was losing his mind
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; because that that the the the tabernacle
[1:10:29] the the ark was come which which held
[1:10:32] the holies of holies in the Old
[1:10:34] Testament
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; which you have in your heart today.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; The Holy of Holies is the Holy Spirit,
[1:10:40] the Holy Ghost. So you have it right
[1:10:43] inside your heart. But when David Oh, so
[1:10:46] watch this. Watch it. This is how it
[1:10:47] works. I want to show you how it works.
[1:10:49] So David was bringing the Holy of Holies
[1:10:52] back into Israel.
[1:10:55] And when he was getting in the presence
[1:10:57] of the Holies of Holies, listen the
[1:10:59] honey, this is really good.
[1:11:03] He completely lost all physical control.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
[1:11:08] minute.
[1:11:10] That happened today.
[1:11:13] Well, every one of you are packing the
[1:11:15] holy of the
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:11:18] the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Holies.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; That's where the Holy Ghost is.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And so when you showed up church, I
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; That's about what I did when I heard
[1:11:30] Brother Matt behind me. I Oh, boys. Oh,
[1:11:32] boys. I considered closing church and he
[1:11:34] drove from Oh,
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; don't worry. They made fun of David,
[1:11:40] too. So, you can make fun of me, too. It
[1:11:42] won't go very good for you.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I think somebody should tell
[1:11:46] those people that are attacking the
[1:11:47] church from outside that won't make very
[1:11:50] good when you attack God.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you know what the you know
[1:11:53] what the that that God told the prophet
[1:11:55] in Israel when he said they have not
[1:11:57] rejected me you
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; rejected me
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; the word
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; that I will lead you.
[1:12:10] How could people choose to be completely
[1:12:14] free, have no king, no army, no
[1:12:18] mistress, no cooks, no taxes. Oh, that
[1:12:22] would be Wouldn't that Wouldn't that be
[1:12:24] pretty cool?
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And they said, "We want that."
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; That sounds like the people in Canada.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; And the prophet went to him and said,
[1:12:36] "Wait a minute. Have I ever taken your
[1:12:38] money?"
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[1:12:40] Have I ever taken your sons for the
[1:12:42] army? No. No. No. No. Have I ever taken
[1:12:44] your daughters for my mistress? No. No.
[1:12:46] No. No. Have I ever taken all your
[1:12:48] horses and cattle? No. No. No. No. No.
[1:12:52] No. No. You're good. But we want you to
[1:12:54] take them.
[1:12:56] We want a king cuz we want to serve the
[1:12:58] devil.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I said the devil. I didn't
[1:13:05] God didn't make a mistake when I said
[1:13:07] that.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They said, "We want to be like
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; the other king."
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; All
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; the others.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Who did they serve?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; See, on on situations like that, I need
[1:13:28] counsel either from God or my wife cuz I
[1:13:30] just can't figure that out.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amazing.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; You know, it repeats the scripture.
[1:13:45] Remember how we talked about repeating
[1:13:47] in 1 Chronicles 15:25-28. And I'm not
[1:13:50] going to read it, but I'm just going to
[1:13:51] read the good part. It said, "David went
[1:13:53] up and the ark of the covenant of the
[1:13:55] Lord out of the house, and they brought
[1:13:57] it in with joy. And all the Israel
[1:13:59] bought the ark of the covenant up with
[1:14:00] shoutings and the sounds of the the
[1:14:04] cornet and the trumpets and the cher the
[1:14:09] I can't even say these words. Anything
[1:14:11] that would make noise,
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; they beat on it.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; God is not afraid of your noise. We are
[1:14:21] far too quiet. You're not going to
[1:14:24] offend me if you offend. Don't worry
[1:14:26] about offending me. You're definitely
[1:14:27] not going to offend God if you get
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; you're serving God. You're not serving
[1:14:33] me.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; You're not serving the church. If God
[1:14:36] anoints you and you get blessed
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And you got to hold it in because you're
[1:14:41] cuz you're afraid you're going to offend
[1:14:42] the church beside you, leave the church.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Would you rather offend the church or
[1:14:47] God?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. That's right.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Who said it in the Bible that I was I
[1:14:56] was a natic radical, a fool?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; For Christ.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Whose fool are you?
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I've seen some pretty bad fools. And
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; so have you.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And you know
[1:15:15] they're never ashamed.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You know, you see somebody that's stoned
[1:15:18] drunk and they're just puking over the
[1:15:20] toilet. I can be stoned drunk by the
[1:15:22] Holy Spirit, but I never have to puke in
[1:15:24] the toilet.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; I'm the healthiest. My My immunity goes
[1:15:28] way up to the sky. Their immunity goes
[1:15:31] way down.
[1:15:41] High time we're not ashamed.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Put a high time you're not ashamed.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the power of God.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That'll lead me to salvation.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of heaven.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Thank you,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; God. Help us.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Exodus 14:30 and 31. Here we see that
[1:16:07] God brought Israel out by a mighty hand
[1:16:09] and and Moses was actually God actually
[1:16:12] told Moses, I mentioned this maybe
[1:16:14] before.
[1:16:16] God actually told Moses, "I will make
[1:16:18] you a god to Pharaoh." That whatever
[1:16:21] comes out of your mouth is my words.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; That That's power.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; That's power.
[1:16:28] You wouldn't have made out too well if
[1:16:30] you wouldn't have followed Moses in that
[1:16:31] day.
[1:16:33] No,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; you would have been the ones that the
[1:16:35] earth swallowed up.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz when they got on the other side of
[1:16:39] the Red Sea, he said God was
[1:16:43] God has bad days, too. Honey, ain't that
[1:16:45] reassuring? God even had a bad He said
[1:16:47] he repented that he'd made men.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And God said, "All the ones that want
[1:16:52] are Moses side come and stand with
[1:16:53] Moses. All the other one, God just went
[1:16:58] and buried them
[1:17:00] alive.
[1:17:02] alive.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; That was the biggest mass grave in
[1:17:06] history.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; God didn't need bolos.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Exodus 14:3. And thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:17:18] thus the Lord, sorry, saved Israel that
[1:17:21] day out of the hand of the Egyptians.
[1:17:22] And Israel saw the Egyptians die upon
[1:17:26] the seashore. And Israel saw the great
[1:17:29] and mighty works of the Lord. See,
[1:17:32] there's people that are alive today that
[1:17:34] ain't seeing God. I have people all the
[1:17:36] time say, "I wish we would see the power
[1:17:37] of Pentecost. I have the power of
[1:17:39] Pentecost packed inside me.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; I woke up today.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I got to tell you another story. I
[1:17:53] actually fell asleep last night. Do you
[1:17:55] know half the world has to take downers
[1:17:57] and sleeping pills?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I can't see God. I
[1:18:03] People are walking into God. I can't see
[1:18:05] them." No way.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; It's cuz you got great big old scales
[1:18:10] over your eyes.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz you haven't been in the word enough.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; You haven't been praying enough. You
[1:18:18] haven't been looking for God.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He hid himself from the wise and
[1:18:23] revealed himself unto
[1:18:26] babes.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And they saw the great work of the Lord
[1:18:33] that did come upon the Egyptians. And
[1:18:35] the people feared. Now, this fear is
[1:18:37] respect. They respected the Lord and
[1:18:40] believed the Lord, the servant of Moses.
[1:18:43] And when they sang and uh Exodus 15:1
[1:18:48] and then Mo sang Moses and the children
[1:18:50] of Israel a song unto the Lord and I'll
[1:18:53] bet you that was one winging of a
[1:18:55] worship service.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Hey, you know what? Israel had just
[1:19:03] taken 40 years wages in one crack. Or
[1:19:07] no, not 40. 12
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; because they emptied the wealth of
[1:19:12] Egypt.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And they came and they'd seen God in the
[1:19:17] pillar of fire in the cloud and they'd
[1:19:19] walked on dry land and then they stood
[1:19:21] around on the dry shore and watched the
[1:19:24] horses and that drowned.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Brown.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And then they had a worship service.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; They didn't need a song leader.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; It was just like atomic bomb.
[1:19:39] Boom.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And Moses saying the children, it was
[1:19:42] sing unto the Lord. They spake saying, I
[1:19:44] will sing unto the Lord, for he has
[1:19:46] triumphed gloriously, the horse of the
[1:19:48] rider, throw down the sea. And and he
[1:19:50] said, the Lord is my strength and my
[1:19:52] song, and he has become my salvation.
[1:19:53] He's my God, and I will prepare for him
[1:19:56] at habitation. My father's God, and I
[1:19:59] will exalt him, and the Lord is a man of
[1:20:01] war, and the Lord is his vain. And verse
[1:20:04] 17, and they shall bring them up and
[1:20:06] plant them in the mountain heritage,
[1:20:10] which is made to dwell in the sanctuary
[1:20:12] and established. And here, let's just
[1:20:14] drop to verse 20. This is where it was.
[1:20:16] And Maliam was losing her mind, the
[1:20:19] prophetess, and the sister of Aaron, and
[1:20:22] she took the tambourine.
[1:20:25] She was very conservative.
[1:20:28] She didn't want to make too much noise.
[1:20:31] She definitely Oh, dancing. That would
[1:20:33] be in the spirit.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; No, she didn't ask for permission. She
[1:20:40] was like,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; she took the tambourine in her hand and
[1:20:50] all the women went there. Man, they were
[1:20:52] converted after their tambourines and
[1:20:55] and with dances.
[1:20:59] Praise the God for kids when they get
[1:21:01] out. And you know when kids get out and
[1:21:02] they can't walk too good that it's like
[1:21:04] they're dancing for God.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey. You don't think so? What did
[1:21:10] Jesus say? Said if you don't become like
[1:21:13] them.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; You won't even see the kingdom of
[1:21:16] heaven.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Might be time that we can't walk too
[1:21:19] good. You know, my little Oliver, he's
[1:21:21] just learning to to walk and he's kind
[1:21:24] of wobbly, but
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And Miam answered them, and said, Sing
[1:21:36] ye onto the Lord, for he hath triumphed
[1:21:40] gloriously,
[1:21:41] the horse and his rider has he thrown
[1:21:46] into the sea.
[1:21:49] Do we still believe that?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Can he do that today?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Can he do? Well, I tell you what. Thank
[1:22:01] you. The ones
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; he can
[1:22:05] for the ones that believe.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; But if you come to the pastor after
[1:22:09] church and say, "Well, I don't believe
[1:22:10] in the Old Testament because that wasn't
[1:22:11] for us."
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:22:20] See, God can't do it for everybody.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; It's for believers.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Believers.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; You must believe.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; I believe. I believe.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that God's more than able.
[1:22:46] Amen. I got another example was Mary
[1:22:49] that washed the woman that washed Jesus'
[1:22:52] feet. I just want to go through that
[1:22:53] fast and actually just let me give you
[1:22:55] the scripture. It's Luke
[1:22:58] Luke 7:36-48
[1:23:02] and also John 12 1-8. But I want to show
[1:23:04] you the example and I love this.
[1:23:06] Amazing. So here's a woman that's a
[1:23:09] sinful woman and she's seen Jesus face
[1:23:12] to face.
[1:23:14] and in her state of sin, a wicked woman.
[1:23:19] John called her Mary. All the other
[1:23:21] gospels called her a wicked woman.
[1:23:24] But when she saw Christ
[1:23:27] face to face, she took all of her
[1:23:29] wealth.
[1:23:32] All of her wealth.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; All of her wealth. And bought a special
[1:23:37] ointment.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:40] And she probably didn't even know why,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; but God did
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; because the sacrifice had to be anointed
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; before it was killed.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And the church people that had all the
[1:23:59] answers came up to this Jesus God said,
[1:24:04] "Don't you think we wasted that money?"
[1:24:09] And Jesus said,"I have a question for
[1:24:11] you."
[1:24:13] There was two debtors and one owed a lot
[1:24:15] of money and wo just a little bit. So
[1:24:19] like let's give an example. One was born
[1:24:21] in the church and really never sin and
[1:24:24] that's beautiful. I'm not taking away
[1:24:26] from that. But if you had a bad attitude
[1:24:29] and you thought you were so holy that
[1:24:31] you barely needed forgiveness cuz like
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; that that would be sad. And then you had
[1:24:39] the woman that was just she had no
[1:24:41] doubt. She was just a sinner.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If their debt was
[1:24:47] forgiven,
[1:24:49] this is Jesus now. This is this is God."
[1:24:54] Asked in the church, "Who would love me
[1:24:56] the most?"
[1:24:58] He said, "Oh, the one that was forgiven
[1:24:59] the most." And he said, "So I forgive
[1:25:01] her
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; because she's actually able to love me
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; like I expect."
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; See y I'm going to just give you close
[1:25:12] with this and I got a couple scriptures
[1:25:13] just for promise. God don't this ain't
[1:25:17] condoning sin.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I believe in being honest and
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; and good character. You're taking your
[1:25:25] character with you.
[1:25:27] But heaven will be full
[1:25:31] of bad people.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Grateful
[1:25:37] because they were able to say, "Lord, I
[1:25:39] know I'm bad. I deserve hell, but only
[1:25:41] because of you can I get into heaven."
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace and not of
[1:25:49] yourself, lest any man
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; should boast. Yeah.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Bless God. I'd never do that. I don't
[1:25:59] care.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; and grace alone.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; That's why the woman at the well and the
[1:26:17] woman caught in the act and Rahab and
[1:26:19] and David and David. Oh boy. and Samson
[1:26:26] and they'll all be there.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Even Saul.
[1:26:31] Hebrews and we're winding her down.
[1:26:33] Hebrews 12:1. Therefore, seeing that we
[1:26:35] are compressed about by such great cloud
[1:26:37] of witnesses, let us lay aside every
[1:26:39] weight of sin and sin that does so
[1:26:42] easily beset us, and let us run with
[1:26:44] patience the race that is set before us.
[1:26:48] and 2 Corinthians
[1:26:51] 1:20 and 22.
[1:26:54] For all the promises
[1:26:57] of God in him are yay and in him amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not sure if God could do that
[1:27:07] again.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:27:12] unto the glory of God
[1:27:16] by
[1:27:17] us.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Now, which he has established us with
[1:27:23] you in Christ and has anointed us in
[1:27:27] God. That that's a pretty powerful
[1:27:28] voice. Now that he has established you
[1:27:33] in Christ
[1:27:35] and has anointed you, that means you're
[1:27:39] not alive no more.
[1:27:43] anointed us is God
[1:27:47] who hath also sealed us and give us the
[1:27:51] earnest
[1:27:54] of our spirit in our hearts.
[1:27:58] Amen.
[1:27:59] What an amazing God.
[1:28:03] What an amazing God we serve. Amen. I
[1:28:06] tell you at church, we should be so
[1:28:08] careful.
[1:28:10] So so careful
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; to
[1:28:14] to
[1:28:15] put God in a box.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; We can put him in his word
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; cuz that's who he is.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't believe. You just I mean it
[1:28:30] wouldn't even be edifying, but you just
[1:28:32] wouldn't believe the people that come by
[1:28:33] our path say, "Well, I don't believe
[1:28:36] this part, but I believe this part.
[1:28:39] by the hundreds and thousands.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; But in James, it says if you didn't
[1:28:44] believe in this, if you were guilty in
[1:28:46] one part,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; you're guilty of the whole law.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; God did the greatest judgments on those.
[1:28:56] You know, with Saul, he said, "Obedience
[1:28:59] is better than sacrifice."
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; God just said, "This is who I am.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Will you love me?"
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:10] And that's just really sad when people
[1:29:13] start, well, I well this, you know, this
[1:29:15] ain't for this day and this was for over
[1:29:17] there and God changed and he he can't
[1:29:20] heal. No. Oh my my I don't serve a God
[1:29:24] like that.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; My God didn't change.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; God help us. You know,
[1:29:40] God's ability in his Bible is a paradox.
[1:29:46] I I want to I just felt this come to me
[1:29:48] and I and I wasn't going to say it and
[1:29:50] but I want to show you something. You
[1:29:52] know, you know the people that got to
[1:29:53] heaven, you know, I read a poem here a
[1:29:56] few months ago with that and it was
[1:29:58] about somebody getting to heaven. I'm
[1:29:59] just paraphrasing fast but paraphrasing.
[1:30:02] And they were they got to heaven and
[1:30:03] they were just stunned and shocked at
[1:30:05] people that they seen
[1:30:07] and they thought that there must have
[1:30:09] been I don't know what they were
[1:30:11] thinking but they they must have thought
[1:30:12] they were still on earth and possibility
[1:30:14] there might have been some mistakes at
[1:30:16] the pearly gates
[1:30:20] and this really makes you think it made
[1:30:23] me think and they cannot talk to
[1:30:27] somebody that had authority like Peter
[1:30:30] or Jesus or something. And they said,
[1:30:32] "Hey, I didn't think heaven would be
[1:30:34] like this.
[1:30:37] I didn't think brother Dale would ever
[1:30:39] make it."
[1:30:41] And the person they asked, they said,
[1:30:43] "Sh."
[1:30:47] Or, "Sorry, the person that was asking
[1:30:48] this person, he said, "Why is everybody
[1:30:50] so quiet?"
[1:30:53] He said, "Cuz they're stunned that you
[1:30:54] showed up."
[1:30:59] You see, we always think that everybody
[1:31:01] else is a sinner,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; but we're a saint.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Like, that's Bible.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Take the beam out of your own eye
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; before you try to get the sliver.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; That's why people can't sit together in
[1:31:22] a church.
[1:31:24] Yeah.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Because they're trying to take a sliver
[1:31:26] out of somebody else's eye
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; and they got a beam in their own.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's just Bible. If that
[1:31:36] offends you, that's right.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not even sorry because it's Bible.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; I mean, I What am I supposed to preach
[1:31:41] if I can't What am I supposed to preach
[1:31:42] when somebody comes up and says, "Well,
[1:31:44] I only believe this part of the Bible
[1:31:45] but not the other part."
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; You know what I told that person?
[1:31:54] Well, I believe it, so you're probably
[1:31:56] in the wrong church.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's not being mean.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That's just being plain truthful.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Anybody that would take
[1:32:13] away or add to, I would just take them
[1:32:17] right out of my kingdom."
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, help us. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; But you know, we have to we need a lot
[1:32:25] of understanding and grace because God
[1:32:28] wants us to be a family.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to give you a big shock.
[1:32:37] You don't know everything.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Father. Yeah. That's right.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And neither do I.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:52] Do you know and I I I I really am
[1:32:55] closing. Do you know when Saul was
[1:32:58] become king
[1:33:00] was because the people wanted that
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; and Saul disobeyed God's direct order
[1:33:06] from a prophet.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; And he brought the money and the
[1:33:10] valuables back, the animals and the
[1:33:13] king.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And he said the people made them do it
[1:33:18] for worship.
[1:33:20] And the Bible says, not brother D, that
[1:33:24] God took his spirit from Saul.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; And somebody asked me this the other
[1:33:31] day.
[1:33:33] That's heavy. Now, now I'm going to show
[1:33:35] you God. I'm just going to show you God.
[1:33:38] And the Bible says
[1:33:41] that God,
[1:33:44] forgive me, God, gave him an evil
[1:33:47] spirit.
[1:33:51] But God's not evil. How did God do that?
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; How did God give him an evil spirit?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Because God's a holy God.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm showing you something.
[1:34:05] Obedience is really a big deal.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; But I I I want to jump ahead of this.
[1:34:13] And then Saul was afraid of a war that
[1:34:15] was coming up. And he went to the witch
[1:34:19] and she pulled up the spirit of the
[1:34:20] prophet.
[1:34:23] And the prophet told him, he said, 'Wh'd
[1:34:24] you bring me out of my You know all this
[1:34:26] scripture. You can pull it up. And then
[1:34:28] the prophet told Saul. Now wait a
[1:34:31] minute. Now, now wait a minute. Now
[1:34:32] watch this. Saul is now a sinner, right?
[1:34:36] Well, by my sin, like I mean, right? He
[1:34:39] ain't got the Holy Ghost no more because
[1:34:41] God took it.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; He's got to be a sinner. And the Bible
[1:34:45] says that the prophet said that today
[1:34:49] you and your son will be with me in
[1:34:51] heaven.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[1:35:02] He
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; saw is in heaven.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Can I explain that all? No. But I told
[1:35:21] you what the Bible says.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; God's not evil.
[1:35:27] So my suggestion would be that God
[1:35:29] allowed an evil spirit to come on him
[1:35:31] because he was
[1:35:33] disobedient.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; But how did God remove his spirit from
[1:35:39] Saul and then say you're in heaven?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; That means
[1:35:49] you're going to fall off your chair when
[1:35:51] he said that means that Saul went to
[1:35:53] heaven without the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:07] I thought you had to have the Holy
[1:36:09] Spirit to get to heaven.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; I actually believe you do.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; When you get that figured out, let me
[1:36:17] know.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:21] Now,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I just showed you something that God is
[1:36:24] the boss.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad I ain't the boss?
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; I'm mighty glad some other people aren't
[1:36:33] the boss.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; God is the boss.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; God's You look at all the names that God
[1:36:44] is.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; He's just the boss.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. God can do
[1:36:48] everything but fail.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Everything but fail.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That that's you know what I mean? So
[1:36:57] when you see people say, "Well,
[1:37:00] that's not the way I see it." That's not
[1:37:02] the way I see it either, but it's still
[1:37:04] in the Bible.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Unbelievable.
[1:37:16] I think I better show you something.
[1:37:18] Just just will you forgive me?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 16:14
[1:37:32] and and when I show you where this is
[1:37:34] found, I just got I don't want anybody
[1:37:37] going out and say Dale was a liar today.
[1:37:39] 1st Samuel 16. Now, now there's one
[1:37:43] disclaimer, though. If you don't believe
[1:37:46] the Old Testament, well then then well
[1:37:49] then then you're set free.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, hilarious. God must really have a
[1:37:58] chuckle in heaven sometimes.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 16:14, "But the spirit of the
[1:38:03] Lord departed from Saul, and an evil
[1:38:06] spirit from the Lord troubled him."
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; I I do not understand that.
[1:38:16] And it troubled him so badly that the
[1:38:18] next verse said, "And Saul's servant
[1:38:20] said unto him, Behold now an evil spirit
[1:38:22] from God trouble a thief."
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And let's just jump down to
[1:38:39] not have the next one in there.
[1:38:44] So, I always got to find it.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Well, I got it on my phone that I didn't
[1:38:53] edit my iPad.
[1:38:56] But after this part,
[1:38:58] Saul, because of in an army, went to the
[1:39:01] witch. That'll be still in Samuel. It's
[1:39:04] just down a couple chapters. I I just
[1:39:06] didn't edit here.
[1:39:08] I actually got a message started for
[1:39:10] down the road. God's family.
[1:39:12] I had that in there.
[1:39:15] And Samuel, he Saul wanted to know, "Are
[1:39:18] we going to win the war or not?" And he
[1:39:20] said, "No, you will lose the war and God
[1:39:22] will scramble it, scatter Israel,
[1:39:25] but you and your son Jonathan will be in
[1:39:29] paradise in heaven with me."
[1:39:33] Saul's in heaven.
[1:39:36] That that shouldn't make us cadet. That
[1:39:38] should make you rejoice that even if
[1:39:41] you're sitting and you know I'm a loser
[1:39:43] and I'm a saw that I'll be in heaven
[1:39:45] with you,
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; loser and winner.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; No, but you see, we have believers have
[1:39:54] no right to judge.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Wasn't it Christ that died?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; See, I never died.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; It was Christ that died. So why am I
[1:40:09] pointing fingers?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; So all be pointing at yourself.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; And you know if that ever happened in
[1:40:16] the family of God, we'll go home in a
[1:40:18] rapture cuz we'll be united.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And like it'll be such a hoopla that
[1:40:24] we'll we'd have to have walls around the
[1:40:27] town because the whole town would be
[1:40:28] converted.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:40:30] because we would stop con you know what
[1:40:32] the and I wow the who is the accuser of
[1:40:37] the brethren
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Satan so why is it coming out of
[1:40:42] believer's mouths
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; if it comes out of a so-called Christian
[1:40:52] you're either a make Christian
[1:40:55] or you're anointed of the devil
[1:40:59] Yeah.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; So I can't say so I this morning can't
[1:41:04] say well none of you are good enough
[1:41:08] cuz in Christ
[1:41:11] you're all good enough.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God I want to serve.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; That's that's
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; the kind of God I want to serve. I want
[1:41:22] to just give everything to him and just
[1:41:24] say you're the boss. I love you. However
[1:41:28] you run your kingdom, that's entirely up
[1:41:30] to you. But I love you and I'm going to
[1:41:33] be there.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:36] See, God's just amazing. Amazing.
[1:41:41] Amazing. All in the Bible.
[1:41:45] God, help us never to get to the point
[1:41:47] where we reject
[1:41:50] God or God's family
[1:41:53] because we think we got God figured out.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Well, bless God, they don't come to my
[1:42:01] church.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Or bless God, I don't believe the Old
[1:42:07] Testament.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:42:14] Wow.
[1:42:16] Amen.
[1:42:18] Amazing.
[1:42:21] Just amazing.
