[27:24] by God
[27:26] and man we want to continue on part two
[27:28] of the Gentile age and the Bride of the
[27:31] Gentile age and I just would say that
[27:35] this has just been just overwhelming and
[27:37] thrilling to me and
[27:39] and God has been gracious and
[27:43] just very gracious and just just uh
[27:48] you know uh we're definitely in the last
[27:50] days the prophet said that in the 50s
[27:52] and 60s amen tremendously but you're
[27:55] seeing something and we're going to show
[27:57] you I'm going to show you in the the the
[27:59] Bible and the message but we're seeing
[28:01] something in the last days that is just
[28:04] Supernatural amen
[28:06] and it but it's partying
[28:09] the church
[28:11] it's see God was a separator
[28:14] hey man he said come out of her my
[28:16] people and be I I can't hold this no
[28:19] longer let me share this with you you
[28:21] know we preached on not that long ago
[28:23] that the prophet said that we know that
[28:26] Daniel was the first prophet to the
[28:28] Gentile age
[28:29] we know the Gentile age started with
[28:32] Prophet worship
[28:35] but at the exact same time
[28:39] I when Satan comes in like a flood
[28:43] God will raise up a standard against you
[28:45] exact same day
[28:47] that part of the church was Worship in
[28:49] Daniel
[28:50] God was showing visions and dreams
[28:54] and Supernatural Revelations and Daniel
[28:56] could interpret the Unseen written hand
[29:00] on the wall
[29:04] the same day
[29:09] and that's happening right now
[29:12] and the same message you'll have people
[29:14] worshiping man
[29:17] and you'll have people where God is
[29:19] pouring out his spirit and Revelation
[29:21] and you're interpreting the unwritten
[29:24] word
[29:25] to the point that's never been seen
[29:27] before
[29:29] oh
[29:30] wow let's turn to Revelation 10. we're
[29:34] going to read verses 1 and then we'll
[29:36] just for time we'll jump to five to
[29:39] seven
[29:40] just uh I pray you will help me pick up
[29:42] my thought and God will help us pick up
[29:45] our anointing and this will be part two
[29:47] and I'm sure it'll be a part three next
[29:49] Sunday
[29:50] or we're going to really have to preach
[29:53] like a machine gun
[29:54] amen you know our girls they were when
[29:56] they were gone was whatever they were
[29:58] gone last Sunday was it last Sunday they
[30:01] went to a shooting range amen and this
[30:03] is what it's like when the people really
[30:05] pull on the preacher they went through a
[30:08] shooting range and they shot some guns
[30:09] that were not semi-automatics but
[30:12] machine guns
[30:15] and there was only one bullet to hit the
[30:17] target off
[30:18] and that was the first one because I was
[30:20] told when Sister Amy shot the machine
[30:22] gun held the trigger then it went
[30:28] a man
[30:29] but that's like the Revelation the
[30:31] anointing man when it's just coming and
[30:33] coming and coming amen amen it's
[30:35] beautiful amen Revelations 10 1. and
[30:39] then to five and seventy men
[30:42] amen and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[30:45] down we know this was Christ
[30:47] God himself came down from heaven
[30:49] clothed with a cloud amen and a rainbow
[30:52] this happened in our day upon his head
[30:54] in his face and was as it were the Sun
[30:57] and his feet were pillars of fire now
[31:00] this happened in our generation let's go
[31:02] to verse 5.
[31:04] in our generation just think of how much
[31:06] God loves you and the angel which I saw
[31:09] stood upon the sea and upon the Earth
[31:11] this was taking control and dominion
[31:12] over all of Satan and we're going to
[31:14] show you how God's kingdom and Daniel
[31:16] how Daniel's seen this over the years
[31:18] and he lifted up his hand in heaven
[31:22] and he swear by him that liveth forever
[31:25] and ever and who created the Heaven and
[31:27] the things there are in and the earth
[31:29] and the things that there are in and the
[31:32] Sea and the things that there are in
[31:34] that there should be
[31:36] eternity
[31:37] time no more hallelujah oh wow seven but
[31:42] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[31:45] angel when he shall begin to sound this
[31:48] is in our day
[31:49] the mysteries of God
[31:52] the unwritten word and the written word
[31:55] shall be finished
[31:57] as he has declared it
[32:00] to his servants the prophets Lord Jesus
[32:03] we pray you'll come in this place and
[32:06] you take complete control Lord Jesus and
[32:10] we just love it Lord Jesus that you'll
[32:13] Minister the word this morning
[32:15] to your bride of Christ that you
[32:17] purchased with your blood
[32:19] before the foundation of the world
[32:22] we give you the glory and honor for it
[32:24] in your name we pray amen amen you may
[32:27] have your seats
[32:29] amen yesterday and you know just in
[32:31] studying the preparation you know you
[32:34] know our Prophet said that we need to
[32:35] come to the point where we recognize
[32:38] Who We Are
[32:40] we need to come to the place that we're
[32:42] positionally placed and you need to
[32:44] you're insulting God to not recognize
[32:47] who you are you say how that's possible
[32:49] because you are taking his name
[32:51] if you if you as a father had a had a
[32:54] wife or a daughter or son or anything
[32:56] and can you imagine that they wouldn't
[32:58] recognize that they were part of your
[33:01] family
[33:04] can you imagine
[33:05] you would just be like destroyed
[33:09] and now just think of Jehovah God you
[33:11] know I want to give you an example a
[33:12] best example of this here here David was
[33:15] a little pipsqueak uh not important his
[33:17] dad didn't even recognize him as as uh
[33:20] you know uh
[33:22] wasn't even considered in the anointing
[33:24] of the prophet
[33:26] Matt
[33:27] he wasn't
[33:28] the the dad never even mentioned him
[33:32] until pushed
[33:35] too pushed man
[33:38] oh it's beautiful and here David becomes
[33:41] anointed
[33:42] like Christ's bride is Anointed right
[33:45] now on this age it could it be any more
[33:47] anointed when God himself came down he
[33:50] didn't send an angel he didn't sign the
[33:52] important person he didn't just send a
[33:54] five-fold Ministry he came himself
[33:57] himself
[33:59] and deity
[34:00] and he told the prophet he said just
[34:02] turn that cloud
[34:03] to the right
[34:05] whoa just turn it to the right
[34:09] you know that was Unwritten word
[34:14] show me that in the Bible
[34:17] but it was spiritual revelation
[34:20] amen and here David and I'm I don't I I
[34:24] don't even have this I actually put it
[34:26] on a message that I might preach to you
[34:27] conduct but it's a lot this is free here
[34:31] David was the anointed king
[34:33] and the prophet said in God's eyes
[34:37] he was already sitting on the throne
[34:40] here he was ready for his life doesn't
[34:43] a running for their life
[34:45] they're running away from their
[34:48] domestics are running away from the the
[34:51] politics for sure if you're not running
[34:54] from nothing else you're running from
[34:55] that
[34:56] here David was running for his life
[34:59] and he was anointed Jehovah King before
[35:02] the foundation of the world and he had
[35:04] no Throne no Army no Kingdom no subjects
[35:08] nobody that was bowing to him
[35:10] sound familiar
[35:14] I know there's a bride on Earth
[35:17] that the Jehovah God came down in our
[35:19] day
[35:20] to take the scales off your eyes so you
[35:23] would recognize just a little bit
[35:26] he's trying to make your face grow
[35:28] beggar
[35:30] and you're anointed
[35:32] and he's got a throne right beside him
[35:35] in glory where the smallest squirt in
[35:39] this church WIll judge the world
[35:45] oh
[35:46] oh man oh man oh man oh man can you
[35:52] and you come to church so with your
[35:55] hands
[35:56] you go
[35:59] oh my goodness
[36:01] your car should be running on ethanol
[36:04] Holy Ghost ethanol
[36:08] amen
[36:10] I think about that
[36:13] he was running for his life
[36:17] he was anointing through something that
[36:19] he didn't have
[36:20] he was anointed through he didn't have
[36:22] he didn't have he was anointing to run
[36:24] an army that he didn't have he was
[36:25] anointing to subjects that he didn't
[36:27] have
[36:28] his own his own people refused them
[36:30] David's David's first Army he weren't
[36:32] even Israelites

[38:39] be still and know that I am Jehovah God
[38:42] and I will be exalted among the heathens
[38:46] that's why Daniel's seen a rock cut out
[38:48] of the mountain
[38:49] without hands and I will be exalted
[38:52] right on Earth
[38:55] wow one more verse
[38:58] the Lord of hosts
[39:01] hey this he said this already
[39:04] you know if I preach the message twice
[39:06] you'd say oh brother Dale he must not be
[39:07] studying and he preached last Sunday's
[39:10] message this Sunday because God never
[39:12] gave him no fresh anointing
[39:14] but they just said this last verse
[39:17] do you think God wants you to know that
[39:18] and the Lord of hosts is with us not in
[39:22] the Rapture he's with us right now
[39:25] and the god of Jacob is our refuge
[39:27] Sheila you know in Daniel and you can
[39:29] pull this up Daniel 7 and I'm not going
[39:32] to read these all but in Daniel 7 from
[39:34] verse from verse 3 to verse 8 Daniel
[39:37] sees in the vision and he sees all these
[39:39] beasts rise up
[39:41] amen all these great beasts
[39:45] and I praise God for a prophet and if
[39:48] you go and you look at these through the
[39:51] message Hub our Prophet said that these
[39:53] beasts
[39:56] and then in the end of that there was
[39:58] four beasts blew up and then in the end
[40:00] of Daniel's Vision in verse 8 there was
[40:02] a Great and Mighty Beast to come up
[40:06] amen
[40:09] I tell you what if God if God keeps
[40:12] preaching to me like like he's been
[40:14] we're going to stay in Daniel for a
[40:15] while these beasts are all satan
[40:20] amen
[40:22] wow
[40:24] and a Great and Mighty beast that's
[40:26] raised up at the end
[40:29] is no less
[40:30] than Lucifer through Rome
[40:34] but all the other beasts were great
[40:37] kingdoms on the Gentile age since the
[40:40] time of Christ
[40:41] and they were just different faces on
[40:44] Satan
[40:48] so one Beast come up in the Roman time
[40:50] when Jesus was here one come up in the
[40:52] Greek time when Jesus was here what
[40:54] Jesus was eating here sorry and Through
[40:56] the Ages and all these different beasts
[40:58] but thou in our time there's a Great and
[41:01] Mighty beast but at the same time that
[41:04] Satan has got a Great and Powerful Beast
[41:07] and they got the gold Of The World God
[41:11] owns everything
[41:16] and he just shoots like he said Don't
[41:19] Fear communism there's just a puppet in
[41:22] God's hands well Rome is just a puppet
[41:25] in God's hand and they think they're
[41:29] controlling the strings of the puppet
[41:31] show with literally Jehovah God just has
[41:35] had them stored his gold for them
[41:43] because that same Daniel seen a vision
[41:46] when the Stone come out that hit the
[41:48] feet of the Statue of iron and clay and
[41:52] destroyed all the kingdoms
[41:57] on the Earth
[42:00] well we got time to read Daniel 7 9.
[42:05] because the picture
[42:08] has changed
[42:11] and I beheld till the Thrones were cast
[42:14] down that's the kingdoms of the Earth
[42:16] and the Ancient of Days did sit
[42:20] whose garment was wide as snow and whose
[42:24] hair on his head was as pure
[42:27] as well
[42:29] and his throne was Fury
[42:33] Fury aflame and his will was as Barney
[42:40] fire
[42:42] and this is immediately the vir index
[42:45] verse
[42:47] where he's talking about the Beast
[42:50] and our Prophet said that every one of
[42:53] them
[42:54] was a manifestation
[43:01] amen
[43:03] there's one Kingdom that's an
[43:06] everlasting Kingdom
[43:08] amen and he owns all the Atomic Warfare
[43:13] wow
[43:15] amen hallelujah
[43:17] the Saints of the most high is the only
[43:20] Everlasting Kingdom Acts 2 16 and I'll
[43:24] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and my
[43:27] sons and my daughters will prophesy and
[43:30] my own
[43:32] men will see dreams
[43:34] and you're a young man
[43:37] divisions
[43:39] that's
[43:40] this morning
[43:45] Joel 2
[43:47] 8-32
[43:50] let's pull that out Joel 2 and I'll just
[43:53] paraphrase one of the verses here it
[43:55] says and it will come to pass that
[43:58] whosoever
[43:59] that whosoever belongeth to the bride of
[44:02] Christ they're the only ones doing this
[44:04] that whosoever was predestinated before
[44:07] the foundation of the world because the
[44:09] Bible says that no man sought God and no
[44:13] man comes to the father except first he
[44:16] whoops draw him in up the street where
[44:20] the cars are going really fast
[44:22] Hallelujah
[44:26] that whosoever calleth upon the name of
[44:28] the Lord
[44:30] so worry about the wars in the world
[44:33] no oh no no no no
[44:35] that was the new IV version
[44:39] shall be delivered
[44:42] you're already but
[44:44] I'm going to show you a quote
[44:46] no I ain't going to show you a quote
[44:48] sorry I'm kind of kind of I was putting
[44:52] a message on my iPad for the Philippines
[44:54] I'll show you a quote from my
[44:56] Philippines or for the Uganda sorry
[45:00] just as God had already recognized David
[45:03] as on the throne
[45:04] in Romans 8 I believe it's about 20.
[45:08] God had already already passed that
[45:12] already
[45:13] past this glorified you on his phone
[45:19] and you say but brother Dale I'm running
[45:22] for my life
[45:24] you're running for your life just let go
[45:27] and be still
[45:32] I want to tell you this morning that it
[45:34] ain't because you're nothing in yourself
[45:36] it's nothing but Amazing Grace from
[45:39] Jehovah God himself
[45:41] but every single Kingdom and every
[45:43] single person and every single demon
[45:47] will bow before you
[45:50] yeah before you
[45:52] because our Prophet said that the king
[45:55] and the queen if you ever get that
[45:58] you'll lose your mind the king and the
[46:01] queen will be on the throne
[46:03] together
[46:06] and you ain't judged in the weight
[46:09] Throne judgment so when every knee bows
[46:11] you've already bowed by choice well by
[46:14] predestination Sorry by predestination
[46:16] so when every need comes up and they bow
[46:19] before a Jehovah God they'll be bowing
[46:22] before the queen
[46:27] and you thought you went to a small
[46:29] Church
[46:32] you thought you did
[46:33] but our Prophet said he's seen
[46:36] millions and millions
[46:40] of people there
[46:49] wow you know the rapture
[46:52] is a change in disposition and we know
[46:55] that the prophet said the Rapture is
[46:56] going on right now brother Dale's
[46:59] already raptured his flesh is just still
[47:01] walking
[47:03] there's going to be a time yes a pacific
[47:05] time that I'll get a different body
[47:06] change
[47:07] but you know what our Prophet said
[47:12] even that I already have
[47:14] because he said it's hovering by you
[47:20] he said it's hovering by you
[47:23] oh my
[47:26] but you know before you can actually
[47:29] take this body change
[47:33] your body has to change
[47:37] amen
[47:39] let me say that again
[47:40] before you can actually take your
[47:43] Celestial your glorified bodies
[47:47] your body
[47:49] that's the change
[47:56] the nature
[47:59] the Nature has to change it'll still be
[48:01] your body
[48:02] but your glorified body will never come
[48:04] in and pick this body up
[48:06] unless your nature
[48:10] is subceptive to it now whatever that
[48:14] word is like the dove
[48:17] you know what the prophet said when you
[48:19] came up and the wrong spirit that Dove
[48:20] just went
[48:23] uh-huh
[48:25] because it could only eat fresh kill
[48:31] they never picked in the barnyard
[48:35] John 14 16 and I pray the father that
[48:38] he'll send you another comforter that he
[48:41] may abide with you forever and even the
[48:44] spirit of Truth
[48:46] whom the world cannot cannot it cannot
[48:50] even if it wants to receive
[48:54] because it don't see him
[48:57] let me tell you something this morning
[49:00] to see him is not just written word I
[49:04] actually might not be no written word at
[49:06] all
[49:08] you know when all the other churches in
[49:10] town
[49:11] they're probably reading something very
[49:12] similar to this
[49:16] and they're looking
[49:18] and they don't see
[49:24] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[49:29] he dwell in this is I don't know if you
[49:31] pulled this up this is John 14 16-18 but
[49:34] ye know him
[49:36] for he dwelleth
[49:38] inside of you in you and he shall be he
[49:42] shall be with you and be in you and in
[49:46] that day in what day in the day that he
[49:49] came down ye shall know that I am in the
[49:52] father he came down was it two different
[49:55] people three different by cars it wasn't
[49:57] I am in the father and you are in me
[50:02] and I am
[50:04] in you
[50:06] so when he came down in the cloud and
[50:09] the Holy Spirit told us the prophet to
[50:12] turn it to the right
[50:13] brother Dale
[50:15] brother Matt brother Bernard sister
[50:17] Patty and all the rest of you I was in
[50:20] that picture if you look really really
[50:24] really close
[50:26] wow
[50:29] you will recognize
[50:32] the family resemblance
[50:36] oh boys
[50:41] thank you Lord
[50:45] oh
[50:46] Matthew 13 10-11 to you he has given
[50:52] to know
[50:54] and you're able to sit in your seat
[50:58] and you got to pull this up Amy I don't
[51:00] think they believe me
[51:02] Matthew 13 10 and 11 to you
[51:06] to who to the little tiny flock
[51:10] the little tiny fear not little flock
[51:12] for it's the father's good pleasure
[51:16] to give you
[51:20] the whole Kingdom
[51:23] you thought it was just salvation
[51:32] to you it is given to know but to them
[51:36] it's not given
[51:38] Jesus answering them he says it's given
[51:41] to you to know the Mysteries of the
[51:44] Kingdom of Heaven
[51:47] that's the unwritten word
[51:53] but to them it's not given
[51:56] I'll tell you what it's going to protect
[51:58] your soul
[52:01] this is a razor edge
[52:05] and I tell you what
[52:06] brother Matt and every one of you
[52:08] brother sisters in here if you go to
[52:10] some places and the preacher's talking
[52:12] about the unwritten word you might want
[52:14] to get nervous
[52:18] and you'd have brother Dale be nervous
[52:20] right beside you
[52:21] because brother Matt it's just a razor
[52:23] it's a it's it's thinner than a hair
[52:27] and if you see your pastor just wobble
[52:29] one way or the other
[52:31] I even I will fall off
[52:38] that's why in our Prophet God bless you
[52:41] because Fred that's why in our day
[52:44] in our day in this in this morning
[52:48] I see it every week
[52:51] I see it every week you have people that
[52:53] are by the letter worshiping the same
[52:56] truth that we see
[52:58] and they're doing it
[53:01] to the prophet
[53:03] and we're doing it
[53:04] to the revelation of the spirit
[53:08] do you notice I could show you literally
[53:12] probably 25 Bible scriptures
[53:15] where it talks about it has nothing to
[53:18] do it has everything to do with but it
[53:20] has nothing to do with the person in the
[53:22] body
[53:23] but it has everything to do
[53:26] it's not about brother Dale this morning
[53:28] it's not about the fivefold ministry
[53:30] although God chose them for the
[53:32] perfecting of the Saints see what I'm
[53:34] trying to show you is when Daniel is
[53:36] seeing the vision this is Bible
[53:38] I'm backing this up when Daniel seen the
[53:40] vision and there was a rock cut out of
[53:43] the mountain
[53:45] whose hands did he see
[53:49] was in the hands of the pastor
[53:52] was it the hands of the five Florida
[53:54] mantras it wasn't the Pat in the hands
[53:56] of the the best evangelists in town it
[53:58] wasn't an evangelist of somebody that
[54:00] walked with the prophet still preaching
[54:02] it wasn't the Evangelist somebody's got
[54:04] the biggest church in the world
[54:09] it was Without Hats
[54:12] see those that worship Christ
[54:16] our Prophet said that Jesus was the body
[54:20] and Christ was the anointed
[54:24] the Bible says those that worship Him
[54:25] must worship Him and spare him and
[54:28] address
[54:31] spirit and truth yes Jesus Christ was
[54:34] Jehovah God
[54:36] perfectly Tabernacle didn't Flash
[54:39] amen and when he was done with that
[54:42] flesh it's laid somewhere and he's
[54:44] sitting in the throne on heaven
[54:48] hallelujah it's beautiful
[54:52] it's beautiful you know I'm gonna
[54:56] move on to a different part of Daniel
[54:58] here let's pull up Daniel 1 8 17 and 20.
[55:04] I'm going to touch on something this
[55:05] morning that's going to and then we're
[55:08] gonna move on and I want to if I get
[55:10] there I'm gonna show you a bunch of more
[55:13] examples in the Bible of the unwritten
[55:15] word and just oh it's just really really
[55:18] beautiful to me for sure to you
[55:22] amen
[55:23] Daniel 1 8 Amy
[55:28] when she's pulling that up I want to
[55:30] show you something here
[55:32] uh
[55:33] and me and Luanne were out driving and
[55:35] we've seen something wrote on a sign I
[55:37] took a picture of it you know God can
[55:39] speak through anything you know God's
[55:41] everywhere
[55:42] and I changed it a few words
[55:44] amen
[55:46] but I want to show you something and I'm
[55:48] going to prove it by the Bible in Daniel
[55:49] here where we read this scripture
[55:51] but your life reveals
[55:56] what you really believe
[56:00] not what you say
[56:08] your life reveals
[56:10] what you really believe
[56:14] and not what you say
[56:16] and that goes for preachers too
[56:21] amen
[56:24] amen that goes for every single human
[56:27] being
[56:28] here is an example and it's just
[56:30] beautiful you know let me read the
[56:32] scripture and then I'll carry on on this
[56:34] thought we we need to be
[56:36] we're we're at the end of the closing
[56:40] the prophet said after the seals
[56:43] that it was set up
[56:46] to going home
[56:48] it was the end it was all over there was
[56:50] nothing for the Gentile bride after the
[56:52] revealing of the seals
[56:54] amen if anything at all was just to
[56:57] ripen
[56:58] to become more like him just to Bow your
[57:01] head let the sun bake out all the Dale
[57:03] and so the real genuine was pure
[57:07] amen
[57:09] but Daniel purposed now compared Daniel
[57:12] to the bride of Christ
[57:15] and this is serious stuff because you
[57:17] know
[57:17] Satan knows that his time has showered
[57:20] he knows that it's probably going to be
[57:23] really soon
[57:26] and so
[57:27] uh
[57:29] he's like a raccoon when you're Corner
[57:31] in a corner when he knows his time's
[57:33] running out
[57:34] you want to make sure you got good shoes
[57:36] on because he's going to bite your toes
[57:39] amen
[57:41] and Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[57:43] would not defile himself with the
[57:45] portion
[57:46] of the king's meat now just put that in
[57:50] today
[57:50] can I can I read that same verse again
[57:53] brother Dale Style
[57:55] and the Bride of Christ's purpose in
[57:57] their heart that they would not defile
[57:59] herself
[58:01] with the portion of the world to me
[58:06] nor nothing wrong with meat here now
[58:11] remember I'll jump ahead remember when
[58:13] the Three Angels Came to Abraham
[58:16] amen and maybe they mentioned this last
[58:19] week when the Three Angels Came to
[58:20] Abraham and Abraham said my Lord one was
[58:23] Jehovah God and our Prophet said that
[58:26] God wanted to go down himself to make a
[58:27] covenant with Abraham and Sarah and he
[58:30] just pot a body and just jumped in it
[58:32] and he walked down there
[58:34] amen and here here this is what people
[58:37] don't see this morning amen sister
[58:39] Luanne heard this when I was studying
[58:41] and and she was laughing out loud but
[58:43] here's Jehovah God is that true brother
[58:45] Matt Abraham said it was my Lord here's
[58:48] Jehovah God
[58:50] in a body
[58:52] light never recognizing
[58:54] he called them Lords
[58:58] and Abraham said Sarah quick get the
[59:00] microwave
[59:02] and the servants wouldn't kill the calf
[59:03] and they had to cook it in the microwave
[59:04] because it had to cook fast
[59:06] I'm kidding
[59:09] and here's my Lord
[59:11] eating a piece of soft baby calf
[59:15] and the Flies are landed on it and he's
[59:17] shoeing the Flies the very God that
[59:19] created the Flies and created the calf
[59:21] and created the meat and created the
[59:23] microwave and he's chewing the Flies off
[59:25] them said I don't see them I don't
[59:27] recognize God in that picture he should
[59:30] like God he wouldn't have flies and he's
[59:32] shooting
[59:36] oh my
[59:39] God and people are looking right on them
[59:40] they're looking right out and said this
[59:42] person's shooting the Flies Opera
[59:43] there's no way that's there's no that's
[59:45] not my Lord there's that's not my Lord
[59:47] brother he's he he and he's eating me
[59:52] oh my goodness
[59:56] and Jesus said I thank you Father
[59:59] that you hid it from the wise and the
[1:00:01] prudent and I could go down Tabernacle
[1:00:03] in the flesh and I could chew the Flies
[1:00:05] off meat and I'm sure it was pink
[1:00:07] because it cooked it fast Vicki and it
[1:00:09] probably was just really the soft pink
[1:00:11] you know
[1:00:14] and just like that
[1:00:16] he was gone
[1:00:23] but before he was gone
[1:00:25] he could reveal their own written word
[1:00:27] When Sarah's your thoughts are louder in
[1:00:30] heaven
[1:00:32] than your voices here
[1:00:34] oh my why did Sarah lie
[1:00:38] don't laugh at God's word this morning
[1:00:41] amen
[1:00:43] Hallelujah and Daniel purpose in his
[1:00:45] heart that he would not defile himself
[1:00:46] with the portion of me
[1:00:49] nor with the wine with switchy drink
[1:00:52] therefore he requested the prince
[1:00:54] eunuchs that he might not
[1:00:57] defile himself I want to make a a
[1:01:00] proclamation here God will protect his
[1:01:04] bride while you're here on Earth and no
[1:01:06] matter what comes down the channel you
[1:01:09] will not have to defile your body here
[1:01:13] to serve God
[1:01:16] that's
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:20] because God can change the heart of a
[1:01:23] king
[1:01:24] and even a eunuch in this case
[1:01:26] because the Bible says that died and
[1:01:28] you'll found favor
[1:01:30] he found favor with the man that said if
[1:01:34] the king finds out he will lob my head
[1:01:37] off
[1:01:38] that's pretty strong favor
[1:01:43] oh my
[1:01:45] thank you Lord 17. now just you can read
[1:01:48] this it's powerfully good
[1:01:52] verse 17 the key
[1:01:55] and as for those four children God gave
[1:01:58] them knowledge now watch before Daniel
[1:02:02] said in his heart the bride of Christ
[1:02:05] said in their heart I won't worship or
[1:02:09] defile my body
[1:02:11] now just think of that in worshiping in
[1:02:14] the Trinity and and Doctrine and Creeds
[1:02:17] and man's ideas and that all these
[1:02:19] things I won't do it
[1:02:23] and because of that
[1:02:28] and as for these four children God gave
[1:02:30] them knowledge and skill and skill and
[1:02:36] who God gave and because of that God
[1:02:40] gave them knowledge and skill in all
[1:02:44] learning
[1:02:46] and all wisdom
[1:02:50] and Daniel had understanding in all
[1:02:55] visions
[1:02:57] and dreams
[1:03:01] you could take these two verses
[1:03:03] and say if you're looking for something
[1:03:06] that you're not seeing
[1:03:09] you've defiled yourself
[1:03:14] see if you're not defiled
[1:03:17] and you're in Christ
[1:03:22] you're the same as Christ
[1:03:25] you say oh brother Dale you're making me
[1:03:27] a God the prophet said
[1:03:30] that the word is in the bride and the
[1:03:34] bride has has thus saith the Lord
[1:03:39] wow
[1:03:44] defile yourself
[1:03:50] uh sorry but 20.
[1:03:55] see how God blessed them
[1:03:58] super
[1:03:59] Supernatural lessons
[1:04:02] uh and this scripture is going to tell
[1:04:04] you and it was so
[1:04:06] powerful
[1:04:08] that the world
[1:04:11] the world
[1:04:13] for the man
[1:04:15] recognized
[1:04:18] and in all matters of wisdom and
[1:04:21] understanding that the king
[1:04:24] I got their attention
[1:04:26] that the king
[1:04:28] inquired of Daniel no no no no no no no
[1:04:32] no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:04:34] no no no no that's not what it says
[1:04:37] brother down
[1:04:40] see one man worshiper
[1:04:43] one man prophet
[1:04:46] one man big evangelists
[1:04:50] he inquired of the big evangelists that
[1:04:52] had a knockout Ministry
[1:05:02] the king inquired of them
[1:05:07] the bride of Christ
[1:05:09] call
[1:05:10] and he found them
[1:05:14] the bride
[1:05:15] ten times
[1:05:17] and you thought you wanted that cheesy
[1:05:20] Hollywood garbage
[1:05:27] be careful brother
[1:05:33] God help us
[1:05:34] see Satan has come up
[1:05:37] with garbage
[1:05:39] of of knowledge and entertainment and
[1:05:41] when I'm studying I like the knowledge
[1:05:43] because I have the internet and I can go
[1:05:45] on the message Hub and I can search what
[1:05:47] the prophet said about every single
[1:05:49] verse in the Bible and how many times in
[1:05:51] all this and I can search the message
[1:05:53] because of the internet and so okay I
[1:05:56] could get rid of the internet
[1:05:58] but there's other garbage
[1:06:01] garbage see Daniel
[1:06:05] in his heart not to defy himself with
[1:06:10] the with the world's meat
[1:06:15] uh-huh
[1:06:17] that came to me but there's the King of
[1:06:20] Kings me on the same channel
[1:06:28] unbelievable
[1:06:37] your desires
[1:06:40] and your life will prove Who You Are
[1:06:45] if you have an appetite
[1:06:48] for the world's meat
[1:06:51] you don't have to have me tell you who
[1:06:53] you are
[1:06:55] but if you have an appetite
[1:06:57] for the king of kings of me
[1:07:02] whoa
[1:07:09] what did Satan tell Christ told God go
[1:07:13] on a boat like a roaring lion to and
[1:07:16] throw through Wyoming seeking whom he
[1:07:19] may give the king's meat to
[1:07:23] oh my goodness
[1:07:28] and the King found them the bride of
[1:07:31] Christ
[1:07:32] 10 times better of an employee
[1:07:37] 10 times better
[1:07:39] of a trustworthy
[1:07:44] anything
[1:07:47] 10 times
[1:07:52] then all the other
[1:07:55] servants
[1:07:57] of the devil
[1:07:59] magicians and astrologers that were all
[1:08:03] in awe of his route
[1:08:08] ten times smarter
[1:08:10] than the people that went to cemetery
[1:08:14] and Seminary
[1:08:16] and came from Creeds and deeds and
[1:08:18] dogmas
[1:08:20] ten times
[1:08:24] ten times
[1:08:26] God could it's unbelievable God is
[1:08:29] unbelievable
[1:08:31] but he's true
[1:08:32] God could take a prophet that never had
[1:08:35] what do you have no education couldn't
[1:08:38] even talk right
[1:08:40] you know I I don't I'm just saying you
[1:08:43] know I'm just saying if we believe he's
[1:08:45] the same God and I'm not downplaying
[1:08:48] brother Brown
[1:08:49] I failed grade one and went to speech
[1:08:51] therapy in grade two
[1:08:54] and great between kindergarten and grade
[1:08:56] four I was the joke on the school bus
[1:08:59] like my nickname was mikao
[1:09:02] because I couldn't speak right
[1:09:05] but the king of kings
[1:09:10] said you'll go to through the prophet
[1:09:12] Every Nation
[1:09:14] and you'll have three of Kings listen to
[1:09:18] you
[1:09:22] because they'll recognize
[1:09:24] that your body is not defiled with the
[1:09:28] world's meat
[1:09:31] not defiled
[1:09:33] but it's on the same web
[1:09:42] be careful
[1:09:43] being very very tackle
[1:09:49] your life
[1:09:52] and your appetite
[1:09:55] tell Who You Are
[1:09:59] if you can only watch movies on the web
[1:10:07] and you can't never watch
[1:10:11] anointed word of God
[1:10:14] or study the word of God or Search the
[1:10:16] word of God
[1:10:18] you better take that web
[1:10:20] smash it with a hammer and throw it out
[1:10:22] the door
[1:10:24] because it'll eat your soil
[1:10:26] batter to arrive in heaven
[1:10:29] with less Revelation on the word of God
[1:10:33] than have arrived in heaven to go to
[1:10:36] hell
[1:10:38] you say oh bless God I got the website
[1:10:41] so I can study the message
[1:10:43] yeah but if you're watching the devil
[1:10:47] you're going to have fellowship with
[1:10:48] them in Everlasting Darkness
[1:10:57] I want to show you something and I'm not
[1:11:00] preaching on Holiness here but the
[1:11:02] Daniel
[1:11:07] marked in his heart
[1:11:09] that he would not defile himself
[1:11:12] and God blessed him with things now God
[1:11:15] knows everything
[1:11:16] amen and just in my life just
[1:11:20] wherever I went this week and yesterday
[1:11:23] do you know just randomly last night
[1:11:27] late I studied all day
[1:11:30] last night I pulled up a it was late I
[1:11:35] believe it was it might even met this
[1:11:36] morning I pulled up do you know that you
[1:11:40] couldn't intend
[1:11:42] you could not attend a Tupperware party
[1:11:47] a Tupperware party
[1:11:52] everybody hear me
[1:11:53] you couldn't attend a Tupperware party
[1:11:55] in the 50s without a skirt on
[1:12:02] they wouldn't have the party Tupperware
[1:12:06] and Satan has robbed people
[1:12:09] with perversion
[1:12:12] to to garbage
[1:12:17] and they've defiled themselves with the
[1:12:19] king's meat
[1:12:22] do you know this very morning
[1:12:24] the lady that sister Luanne watches they
[1:12:27] asked her to work next Sunday
[1:12:30] and Lil Wayne said well I'm going there
[1:12:32] today so I don't want to work
[1:12:35] in the way I said well I guess I can and
[1:12:37] she said oh it's all right I'm sending
[1:12:39] my niece there
[1:12:40] and Luanne proceeds to tell me that this
[1:12:44] lady raised the niece
[1:12:46] because of perversion of her mom and dad
[1:12:51] but she's a niece
[1:12:53] they only know what that means
[1:12:56] she's a gyro
[1:12:57] and now she comes to sit next Sunday
[1:13:00] with the very mother on Earth that
[1:13:03] raised her that's 93 years old
[1:13:06] and she's dressed and beliefs she's amen
[1:13:14] because she took some man's meat and cut
[1:13:18] some things off her body and took some
[1:13:20] other things and sewed some things on
[1:13:23] and the man said when I go there Monday
[1:13:26] my little girl will be all messed up in
[1:13:29] her head because this is a little girl
[1:13:32] that she raised from birth
[1:13:35] pervers said
[1:13:37] that's hell
[1:13:41] and it started with women wearing pants
[1:13:44] and men getting rid of their backbone
[1:13:47] wearing a dress
[1:13:49] that's thus say it the word of God and
[1:13:52] brother Dale
[1:13:53] I can prove that upside down
[1:13:57] I also said
[1:13:59] it's still on my phone they give a
[1:14:02] picture of somebody you know there's you
[1:14:04] know everything's everywhere you know
[1:14:06] you can just turn your iPad on it
[1:14:09] there was a picture in the 1930s so this
[1:14:11] is farther back walking in the some I I
[1:14:15] actually thought it was somewhere
[1:14:17] popular but it makes no difference
[1:14:20] and you would have thought every single
[1:14:23] woman on that curb
[1:14:25] I just walked out of a wedding
[1:14:27] because their skirt
[1:14:29] was as long as my pants are right now
[1:14:31] brother Mike can you see that
[1:14:36] and they probably were just walking out
[1:14:38] of like California Hollywood
[1:14:42] don't kid yourself Satan knows exactly
[1:14:45] what he's doing
[1:14:47] he just comes really slow now he knows
[1:14:50] brother Dale won't compromise too much
[1:14:52] so I'll just bring him a little bit
[1:14:56] yeah
[1:14:57] and then
[1:14:59] oh he didn't mind the taste of that
[1:15:01] right Kings me he didn't mind to take
[1:15:04] that I'll just put a little bit more
[1:15:06] seasoning on that
[1:15:08] and pretty soon you'll be like the
[1:15:10] people that God swallowed up when they
[1:15:12] left Egypt and they said they went to
[1:15:14] Moses God's servant and said we would go
[1:15:16] back to the leeks and garlics
[1:15:19] God have mercy on the bride of Christ
[1:15:23] stay away from that garbage
[1:15:26] this is pure and holy and it ain't a
[1:15:30] man's teaching
[1:15:38] I can't help myself and if you I don't
[1:15:41] mean to offend you but we're going up to
[1:15:43] the Amish Country this week and we're
[1:15:45] going to Elmira to a nice restaurant I
[1:15:47] like
[1:15:48] and the atmosphere is unbelievable
[1:15:51] I can tell because water and oil don't
[1:15:53] mix
[1:15:55] every single woman in there will be
[1:15:57] wearing small flowers on a full gown
[1:16:00] dress like a like a bibs not a skirt in
[1:16:02] the top the full ground dress way down
[1:16:04] to the bottom of that and they're
[1:16:05] bringing me my bowl of soup like this
[1:16:13] I'll tell you what if I didn't already
[1:16:15] have the queen of Glory
[1:16:17] and I was 16 again I know which one I'd
[1:16:20] be looking at
[1:16:22] it wouldn't be some old hard bored stiff
[1:16:25] Butch tough hair prostitute
[1:16:29] cheat garbage
[1:16:32] that you could find everywhere else
[1:16:37] uh-huh
[1:16:41] and that's exactly how God feels also
[1:16:46] do you think he's going to marry
[1:16:48] something that's just indulging in the
[1:16:50] king's meat you are deceived
[1:16:55] you are deceived
[1:16:58] and you can also take this another step
[1:17:00] farther that not every single thing of
[1:17:03] Allah that though man made kingdoms on
[1:17:07] this Earth pass does the bride of Christ
[1:17:10] have to indulge in
[1:17:13] thus saith brother Dale
[1:17:16] and God
[1:17:17] like the vaccination
[1:17:21] now if you do it's fine I'm just saying
[1:17:27] let me ask you this
[1:17:29] if Daniel watches Daniel was a slave
[1:17:36] let me repeat that
[1:17:37] Daniel was a captured slave
[1:17:44] hello
[1:17:46] hello
[1:17:50] and he chose
[1:17:52] to go against a foreign government
[1:17:55] law
[1:17:58] now put that in your cup and drink it
[1:18:06] and God said whoa
[1:18:14] thank you Lord
[1:18:16] that's good food anyway
[1:18:18] oh wow so we know that the church ages
[1:18:22] are over
[1:18:23] oh no
[1:18:25] not exactly
[1:18:27] they're not over for the people that are
[1:18:30] in them
[1:18:34] the church ages are not over
[1:18:37] for the first virgins for the night
[1:18:39] they're not over
[1:18:41] but for the bride of Christ
[1:18:44] that's already been glorified
[1:18:46] and already sitting in Heavenly places
[1:18:49] even though I don't have my Throne yet
[1:18:51] and even though I don't have my Army yet
[1:18:54] and even though I don't have my dominion
[1:18:56] over the the kingdoms of the Earth
[1:18:59] I'm already
[1:19:01] there
[1:19:03] I'm already in the bright age
[1:19:07] I'm not affected
[1:19:10] or I'm not partaking let me say it that
[1:19:12] way
[1:19:13] of laodicea
[1:19:16] I have no taste for it
[1:19:18] I'm not loathing the leeks and garlics
[1:19:22] of laodicea
[1:19:26] all right
[1:19:27] our Prophet said it
[1:19:30] similar to that
[1:19:31] he said the bride is in the bride age
[1:19:34] even though the church ages are for the
[1:19:36] ones that aren't called
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:41] Hallelujah
[1:19:43] but Jesus
[1:19:46] you know I know you're having trouble
[1:19:48] seeing it
[1:19:49] you just need to take about 12 hours and
[1:19:51] just spend in Daniel
[1:19:53] you'll come a lot clearer to you if you
[1:19:55] do some praying before
[1:19:59] Jesus is just as much here right now
[1:20:01] this morning
[1:20:03] as he be comes in an actual Corporal
[1:20:05] body
[1:20:06] to have us glorify you know
[1:20:08] the anointing
[1:20:10] will be no stronger
[1:20:14] and you say how can you say because he
[1:20:16] said in his word
[1:20:18] in the end of his word in Revelation
[1:20:21] in the book that tells what's going to
[1:20:23] happen to Satan
[1:20:26] I'm already
[1:20:30] I'm already here
[1:20:32] watch how the cloud came down in our day
[1:20:35] when they come down there and science
[1:20:38] photographed it it was right before
[1:20:42] to see us
[1:20:45] God himself
[1:20:47] came told the prophet
[1:20:51] what the Mysteries were
[1:20:54] what the unwritten word was
[1:21:00] and he didn't trust nobody
[1:21:02] to do that
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:08] there ain't nothing
[1:21:10] watch this there ain't nothing
[1:21:13] that can stand in front of you
[1:21:16] everything if you're a part of the bride
[1:21:18] of Christ and got the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:21:20] everything will bow
[1:21:27] you know
[1:21:29] Hallelujah a thousand will fall at your
[1:21:32] side and ten thousand on the other hand
[1:21:36] but not once back
[1:21:43] amen
[1:21:44] Hallelujah
[1:21:48] thank you Lord
[1:21:51] you know I showed you that example
[1:21:53] of Jehovah
[1:21:55] eating meat with Abraham
[1:21:58] that's exactly what the bride is doing
[1:22:01] this morning
[1:22:02] where the Eagles are gathered
[1:22:05] where the fresh kills
[1:22:08] they're meat eaters
[1:22:11] they don't just drink grapes and fruit
[1:22:15] they indulge in the rescue
[1:22:20] and this day
[1:22:22] Satan our Prophet said this and this day
[1:22:25] Satan knows your address brother Matt
[1:22:27] brother Tim brother Bernard and Fred and
[1:22:30] all of us he knows your address
[1:22:34] Felix he knows your address brother
[1:22:36] really he knows exactly your address
[1:22:38] Satan does
[1:22:39] so sometimes he'll put stuff in the mail
[1:22:43] and my wife calls it garbage man
[1:22:47] it don't make it very far in our house
[1:22:49] it just gets fired down the basement
[1:22:50] stairs and through in the furnace
[1:22:57] but sometimes he'll send you stuff
[1:23:00] and you think oh
[1:23:04] there's my name
[1:23:06] found the right house
[1:23:09] but I don't recognize the other name on
[1:23:11] here
[1:23:13] it's got my name see you know when you
[1:23:14] get a letter it's in the front big and
[1:23:16] center it's in the middle of the
[1:23:18] doohickey you know
[1:23:19] brother Dale
[1:23:21] 2104.
[1:23:24] but sometimes the other person that's
[1:23:27] coming from
[1:23:29] things
[1:23:34] you know you don't have to accept
[1:23:36] stuff that ain't for you
[1:23:39] if somebody sends you rattlesnakes
[1:23:43] now if you like snakes you can eat them
[1:23:45] I suppose I don't want to be the one to
[1:23:47] kill them thank you very much uh I would
[1:23:49] probably eat them if they were cooked
[1:23:51] real nice
[1:23:54] but you can just put it right back in
[1:23:56] your mailbox
[1:23:57] that garbage mail
[1:23:59] you don't even have to put it in the
[1:24:00] furnace you don't even have to carry it
[1:24:01] in your house because it's under the
[1:24:03] token that would be really scary
[1:24:07] you just put it back in the mailbox
[1:24:10] and the mail lady will come the next day
[1:24:11] and she'll say oh you didn't clean out
[1:24:13] your mailbox because that's got your
[1:24:14] name on it
[1:24:16] and you can just put a little sticky
[1:24:17] note on it before the foundation of the
[1:24:19] earth called return
[1:24:22] to send her
[1:24:25] no such
[1:24:27] number
[1:24:29] Return to Sender
[1:24:32] no appetite
[1:24:35] for what you said to me
[1:24:37] huh
[1:24:39] I look no no taste
[1:24:43] pornography
[1:24:44] no taste

[1:24:47] garbage
[1:24:54] doing the perfect sacrifice come down it
[1:24:57] didn't cover it up
[1:24:58] it didn't do like when I was a kid you
[1:24:59] know when company came brother matters
[1:25:01] somebody's coming I just went true and
[1:25:02] pulled the mat down
[1:25:08] but no
[1:25:10] and this day he just sucked her all the
[1:25:12] way
[1:25:14] man
[1:25:15] Hallelujah
[1:25:17] thank you Lord
[1:25:20] amen Satan knows what he's doing and
[1:25:23] he's trying to get you to eat the king's
[1:25:25] meat
[1:25:26] don't come off the word of God
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:30] even when you receive
[1:25:33] watches the prophet said this when you
[1:25:36] receive the unwritten word
[1:25:38] make sure it lines up with the written
[1:25:42] make sure it's of The Same Spirit
[1:25:44] as the written word make sure it's of
[1:25:46] the same
[1:25:47] taste as a written word the same texture
[1:25:52] as the written word

[1:25:59] and uh and we're gonna maybe if we get
[1:26:02] to that ear
[1:26:03] see we need to have the wisdom of
[1:26:05] Solomon
[1:26:07] and it's in the bride
[1:26:10] that when a minister comes and he starts
[1:26:12] talking about the unwritten word and
[1:26:14] that throws out on you
[1:26:17] and it don't taste right
[1:26:19] it's not right brother not
[1:26:22] amen if it don't taste
[1:26:25] unless you're part of the people that
[1:26:28] live in the leeks and garlics

[1:26:34] Heavenly Mana
[1:26:36] I'm telling you what that's a pretty
[1:26:37] cool cook
[1:26:40] uh-huh
[1:26:42] that that kitchen in that restaurant
[1:26:44] wasn't just approved by the government
[1:26:45] of Canada
[1:26:47] that was approved by the Jehovah Jireh
[1:26:50] the King of Kings just
[1:26:58] you know
[1:27:00] this is free
[1:27:02] and this I'm not supposed to
[1:27:06] as we come down to the end
[1:27:10] things are getting crazy
[1:27:13] you know ministers we're talking about
[1:27:15] climate change
[1:27:18] and the Bible says in Romans
[1:27:21] that there will be things happen on the
[1:27:24] Earth
[1:27:26] but they have it all wrong
[1:27:28] everyone
[1:27:30] or not mostly
[1:27:33] you know
[1:27:36] climate change happened brother Matt you
[1:27:37] want to know when climate change
[1:27:38] happened
[1:27:40] I'll tell you when climate change
[1:27:40] happened
[1:27:42] was the one where William Phillips was
[1:27:43] born
[1:27:45] was when brother Bernard was born or
[1:27:47] Fred he's a lot older than all of them I
[1:27:49] mean sorry for
[1:27:50] well or maybe well maybe
[1:27:55] you know when climate change started
[1:27:58] thank you
[1:28:00] as soon as Sin hit the earth in the
[1:28:02] garden
[1:28:02] climate change happened yummy tell you
[1:28:04] what climate change ain't no worse today
[1:28:06] than it was one second after the fall in
[1:28:09] the garden
[1:28:10] now one second not one second I I
[1:28:14] answered some of those ministers
[1:28:16] with no response because I have no
[1:28:19] filter
[1:28:21] amen I said
[1:28:24] climate change has been here forever
[1:28:26] something well something like that I
[1:28:28] said when you give the politicians all
[1:28:30] of your money the government sorry I
[1:28:32] said when you give the government all of
[1:28:33] your money they'll stop preaching
[1:28:35] climate change
[1:28:38] you just brother Matt
[1:28:40] I'll just take it off and the preaching
[1:28:42] will be over
[1:28:44] there
[1:28:44] you I just met
[1:28:47] as soon as the government gets all of
[1:28:49] your money
[1:28:50] there'll be no more sermons on climate
[1:28:52] change you know and there was one
[1:28:53] Minister that had a backbone uh there
[1:28:56] and he put a thing up he said you know
[1:28:58] like in the 30s they said we were going
[1:29:00] to die from the Ice Age in 10 years and
[1:29:02] in the 40s they said we were going to
[1:29:03] die from the Sun age because the ozone
[1:29:06] was gone in 10 years and the in the 80s
[1:29:08] I remember this when I was in high
[1:29:09] school in the 80s and I married my
[1:29:11] beautiful girl we weren't going to be
[1:29:12] able to drive cars because the oil was
[1:29:13] all going to be gone there would be no
[1:29:15] more oil and you know
[1:29:18] huh
[1:29:20] you got Unwritten Revelation brother
[1:29:22] Matt
[1:29:23] climate change happened in the fall
[1:29:25] and climate change ain't one's back
[1:29:27] different today than it was in the fall
[1:29:29] and you say well brother Dale what about
[1:29:30] all the cars driving around I'm sure
[1:29:31] glad you asked praise God I have an
[1:29:33] answer for that dude you're telling me
[1:29:35] that a Jehovah god with eternal ultimate
[1:29:38] wisdom created the gum beds in Oil
[1:29:41] Springs Royal Springs in Oil City and
[1:29:43] all that the gum beds that the oil
[1:29:45] bubbled right out of the ground from the
[1:29:47] creation from the creation and that was
[1:29:50] going to destroy the Earth
[1:29:53] or a cow when it Toots and the stuff
[1:29:57] that smells really strong was going to
[1:29:59] kill the earth when they were killing
[1:30:01] cows when Abraham and Jehovah went down
[1:30:04] and ate the cow
[1:30:05] those people are nuts insane sorry
[1:30:10] man they're deceived I'm sorry for being
[1:30:13] so
[1:30:14] honest
[1:30:17] amen
[1:30:18] do you know Jesus on the on the beach
[1:30:21] and this is free so there might be
[1:30:24] fourth message do you know Jesus on the
[1:30:27] beach cooked fish for the disciples when
[1:30:30] he was calling them but now if you burn
[1:30:31] wood it's killing the old Zone later
[1:30:35] now if you need if you believe this
[1:30:37] stuff you are
[1:30:45] you know what some ministers reply to
[1:30:48] some of our stuff on the thing
[1:30:50] they talked within themselves and they
[1:30:51] said well some of these pastors don't
[1:30:53] believe in climate change bless God
[1:30:56] we're so right
[1:31:05] it's a good thing you pray for me
[1:31:13] and you know what you go to Camp mini or
[1:31:16] travel you're going to visit those
[1:31:18] people you're going to hear them preach
[1:31:24] and it'll be okay
[1:31:26] because God before the foundation of the
[1:31:28] world
[1:31:29] created a five-fold Ministry
[1:31:32] was for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:31:35] and no not all the fivefold gifts and
[1:31:37] colonies are without repentance so no
[1:31:39] not probably most of them aren't holy
[1:31:42] but in the unwritten word
[1:31:45] by the taste of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:48] God could decipher a group of people
[1:31:51] that never loathe the leaks and Gardens
[1:31:56] and you could just tell when you're
[1:31:57] laying it out there
[1:32:00] oh
[1:32:03] this don't tastes right
[1:32:06] there's old days right
[1:32:08] and you're just kind of like
[1:32:12] I don't want to offend anybody
[1:32:15] but I think I'll stick to my wife's
[1:32:17] cooking
[1:32:19] Jehovah gods
[1:32:25] oh man
[1:32:27] amen
[1:32:29] amen so just for the record in case
[1:32:33] anybody's watching our thing brother
[1:32:34] Dale believes in climate change
[1:32:38] praise God
[1:32:42] but it started in the Garden of Eden
[1:32:47] thank you very much
[1:32:51] ain't God good
[1:32:53] I can't I told I can't you know you know
[1:32:56] I was showering this morning
[1:32:58] you know I said
[1:33:00] I can't make this stuff up brother Matt
[1:33:02] I don't even look for it
[1:33:04] do you know the Bible says
[1:33:06] brother Matt
[1:33:08] now when you pray
[1:33:10] to go into your closet
[1:33:13] and pour out your heart to God
[1:33:16] in prayer this application
[1:33:19] and what you do in secret
[1:33:21] God will reward you openly and it says
[1:33:24] do not be like the religious people in
[1:33:26] the message
[1:33:27] Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:33:29] that go to the front corner so ah bless
[1:33:32] God
[1:33:35] 45 minutes later oh the power of
[1:33:39] oh and about being sacrilegious I'm
[1:33:42] teaching the truth
[1:33:44] our Prophet your Prophet brother married
[1:33:46] your prophet
[1:33:48] said a church order and doctored not to
[1:33:50] do that
[1:33:53] he said you don't pray in the service
[1:33:55] for the governor and your sick aunt and
[1:33:58] your Uncle Harry and Papa Louie
[1:34:03] and the Bible says don't be like the
[1:34:05] religious Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:34:08] who go to the street corner and want
[1:34:10] their prayers heard by their fancy words
[1:34:12] of what nobody interprets like the words
[1:34:14] of the message like May the pot don't
[1:34:18] kid yourself
[1:34:19] most people that pray with the message
[1:34:22] terminology that we understand nobody in
[1:34:24] the world would understand
[1:34:26] that don't make it wrong but the Bible
[1:34:28] says
[1:34:29] not to do it
[1:34:31] to do it in secret because
[1:34:35] they have the reward
[1:34:38] they were only praying
[1:34:40] and ministers in this message
[1:34:43] almost every other month
[1:34:45] hire baked name people I've never been
[1:34:47] asked yet to pray
[1:34:48] praise God I haven't start World War 4.
[1:34:53] to pray on the internet
[1:34:55] in front of the whole world
[1:35:04] when my Bible says Pharisees and
[1:35:06] Sadducees
[1:35:08] they have their reward
[1:35:10] now am I now I ask you is that am I
[1:35:14] right brother am I preaching the truth
[1:35:20] you decide
[1:35:24] there's one reason they're doing that
[1:35:28] for one reason
[1:35:30] popularity
[1:35:32] they had their reward
[1:35:35] oh bless God I hope you have a good
[1:35:38] prayer
[1:35:40] in front of a TV
[1:35:45] to the whole world
[1:35:49] you know
[1:35:51] we share our video on the internet
[1:35:54] and the number one reason is because
[1:35:56] brother Jim what's this Patricia aren't
[1:35:58] here this morning
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:01] and almost every week I'm checked in my
[1:36:04] spirit for you
[1:36:09] yeah almost every week
[1:36:15] popularity
[1:36:17] money
[1:36:18] and women
[1:36:22] and the Bible says don't do it
[1:36:24] you want to pray
[1:36:28] it don't even say in the Bible to go to
[1:36:30] pray me now David said you know I'd love
[1:36:32] to
[1:36:33] but it says go in the closet
[1:36:35] I believe if you did come to prayer
[1:36:36] meeting you can have your own closet in
[1:36:37] your pew
[1:36:39] and I'll have my closet wherever it is
[1:36:41] and we could still
[1:36:45] huh
[1:36:47] and you're going to see this
[1:36:49] in the message
[1:36:51] until we go home because our Prophet
[1:36:54] said
[1:36:55] that it will go into complete Insanity
[1:36:59] complete Insanity and the Bible says it
[1:37:02] will be so close that it would deceive
[1:37:04] the message believer
[1:37:06] if
[1:37:09] he wasn't all Israel is unusual
[1:37:15] brother Dale ain't taking nobody out of
[1:37:17] the Kingdom
[1:37:20] but I ask you is that Bible
[1:37:23] did I just say is it message
[1:37:26] Bible and message
[1:37:29] that same Prophet that we believe
[1:37:32] you know
[1:37:33] a lot of people they need to
[1:37:35] either study or pray or get relevant
[1:37:39] same Prophet said that God will never
[1:37:40] use a mechanical device to spread his
[1:37:42] word
[1:37:46] uh-huh hey
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:52] let's see if huh
[1:37:56] now
[1:37:59] you see wisdom
[1:38:01] like Solomon
[1:38:03] see you know the story for the boys
[1:38:06] the boys need to hear this story you
[1:38:08] know Solomon was the wisest person on
[1:38:10] Earth did you know that he
[1:38:12] wisest person on Earth you know why he's
[1:38:14] the wisest person
[1:38:15] because he pleased God and God said I'll
[1:38:18] give you I'll give you money
[1:38:20] that'd be pretty cool
[1:38:21] or I'll give you this Kingdom or I'll
[1:38:24] give you this
[1:38:25] and Solomon recognized the awesome
[1:38:28] responsibility of being in charge of
[1:38:32] God's anointed Kingdom Israel
[1:38:37] that's kind of like me sometimes as a
[1:38:39] pastor
[1:38:41] might come here and pray
[1:38:43] and I mention every single one of you by
[1:38:46] name
[1:38:49] and Solomon said God I can't lead your
[1:38:52] people
[1:38:53] without you doing it in wisdom
[1:38:58] until this day in the history books
[1:39:00] Solomon is reported as the wisest man
[1:39:06] to ever be born
[1:39:08] Google I'll tell you that
[1:39:11] am I
[1:39:12] and so they brought two mothers
[1:39:15] and they had little Curtis
[1:39:19] two mothers looked exactly like Julie
[1:39:22] and they were both claiming Curtis
[1:39:25] but they both couldn't have curse
[1:39:28] how did you know Solomon chose all over
[1:39:31] Felix knows Solomon said that's no
[1:39:33] problem he just said over to one of his
[1:39:35] soldiers he said give me a sword it was
[1:39:37] like the Bible two edit swords and he
[1:39:40] went and he was going to cut Curtis
[1:39:41] right in half
[1:39:42] he said now this will please both of you
[1:39:45] because I won't offend neither one of
[1:39:47] you and you can both take them home with
[1:39:49] you let me tell you something this
[1:39:51] morning Brad
[1:39:52] not all the bride is taking Christ home
[1:39:54] with them
[1:39:57] not just today but in the rapture
[1:40:00] they're not all taking them home
[1:40:03] two will be in the back
[1:40:04] one will be taken and the other one will
[1:40:06] be locked
[1:40:08] she'll be in the field
[1:40:09] and one will be taken on the other way
[1:40:12] we'll still be in the field
[1:40:15] and there's where the wisdom kicked in
[1:40:18] you know how that went near you
[1:40:21] the real mother
[1:40:23] realizing that the baby would be dead
[1:40:29] that's like the word of God
[1:40:41] it's Solomon said you're the mother
[1:40:48] that that's Supernatural
[1:40:53] but that's what the bride has and needs
[1:40:56] today wisdom and revelation
[1:41:00] that the spirit that comes over you
[1:41:03] because it's not a one-man Ministry
[1:41:06] the spirit that comes over you from
[1:41:08] anybody that comes and ministers or
[1:41:10] anything in your travel or even when
[1:41:12] you're at work brother matter Jared or
[1:41:14] Tim anybody my brother anybody
[1:41:17] just about the spirit that they throw it
[1:41:19] over you oh oh oh this ain't right
[1:41:23] this ain't right
[1:41:25] amen
[1:41:29] hey man let me let me uh
[1:41:31] wow
[1:41:33] wow
[1:41:35] wow
[1:41:37] I'm on page seven of
[1:41:39] eleventh
[1:41:41] man let me read a quote brother Brown
[1:41:42] said the Gentile dispensation paragraph
[1:41:44] 81 and I already said it I said it
[1:41:47] verbally but I want you to understand it
[1:41:48] and we preached on this and so I'm not
[1:41:51] dealing with this although
[1:41:53] there's there's the more I study it the
[1:41:55] more I see let me just throw this out
[1:41:57] there you know idol worship everything
[1:41:59] that God worked through the people
[1:42:01] afterwards worship
[1:42:03] the brass serpent
[1:42:05] Mo like you name it everybody did
[1:42:09] even John did Revelations fell down
[1:42:11] worship he said what'd the person say
[1:42:13] when John fell twice brother man
[1:42:17] a man greatest man ever born
[1:42:20] twice
[1:42:22] you know what it says in Revelations
[1:42:24] says I'm a big man
[1:42:26] I'm a prophet I'm one of the full
[1:42:29] ministry bless God I'm important no no
[1:42:31] he said I am your fellow brother servant
[1:42:36] brother
[1:42:40] worship brother
[1:42:41] how in the world twice
[1:42:48] the very servant breast servant that God
[1:42:50] raised up and the people could look at
[1:42:52] when they get bit by The Serpent and
[1:42:54] would live
[1:42:55] even our Prophet said when when Jonah
[1:42:58] was in the well looked at where he
[1:42:59] fought the servant the to live
[1:43:03] the very same godhead them tear it down
[1:43:06] and smash him
[1:43:09] man you know what it is
[1:43:14] our Prophet said that they don't
[1:43:15] recognize
[1:43:18] presence
[1:43:20] of Jehovah
[1:43:21] that was like that with Jesus that
[1:43:23] crucified Jesus why they didn't
[1:43:25] recognize the pro The Presence of
[1:43:27] Jehovah why did they Stone Stephen
[1:43:29] because they didn't recognize The
[1:43:31] Presence of Jehovah why why did they
[1:43:33] Stone all the prophets because they
[1:43:35] didn't recognize the anointing of
[1:43:38] Jehovah in the Tabernacle they didn't
[1:43:40] recognize the anointing it wasn't the
[1:43:42] Tabernacle it wasn't the brass servant
[1:43:44] it was the Jehovah
[1:43:47] that was despairing it was
[1:43:50] that
[1:43:51] I can't like
[1:43:54] it was it was the god
[1:44:03] oh man so he starts out I mean he's just
[1:44:06] starting out talking about that it
[1:44:07] starts out well I'll read the first
[1:44:09] paragraph and you'll notice a gentile
[1:44:11] age started out in idle worship
[1:44:14] you already know what that is it was the
[1:44:15] worship of Daniel but let me just drop
[1:44:17] down in paragraph 83
[1:44:21] uh
[1:44:23] 82. and that's the way it was ushered in
[1:44:26] was prophet worship and it was condemned
[1:44:31] the the head of gold was the image to
[1:44:33] worship to worship everything was
[1:44:35] worship and it was it forced to do it
[1:44:40] the three Hebrew children were forced to
[1:44:42] worship the image of Daniel
[1:44:44] and it ended up in Supernatural
[1:44:47] handwriting
[1:44:50] God took the Kingdom from the King
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:56] so at the same time
[1:44:58] Idol worship's going on God's pouring
[1:45:01] out Revelation that's Supernatural
[1:45:04] same time amen 83. now my words and the
[1:45:09] and as a gentile age commands so will go
[1:45:11] out worship of a holy man but watch this
[1:45:14] and I got this screaming in capital
[1:45:16] letters but also on the other side
[1:45:19] Supernatural
[1:45:24] understand
[1:45:27] Supernatural revelation
[1:45:30] at the exact same time
[1:45:35] those people are falling down and
[1:45:37] worshiping an idol
[1:45:39] and God's showing you the real
[1:45:41] Supernatural on written
[1:45:44] spoken word
[1:45:47] oh
[1:45:50] for interpretation
[1:45:52] or revelation
[1:45:54] for your life
[1:45:56] it's unbelief it's it's just amazing
[1:46:01] amen we are no way shape or formed
[1:46:04] worshiping a dad
[1:46:07] we are no way shape or form worshiping
[1:46:10] any bad
[1:46:12] we are worshiping
[1:46:15] the god that they pointed to
[1:46:18] every one of them worship them even when
[1:46:20] our Prophet was here he said when people
[1:46:23] started doing stuff like that in his
[1:46:25] life he said if and he come off the
[1:46:27] field for a period of time he said if
[1:46:29] you do that you make me an antichrist
[1:46:33] you make me the devil
[1:46:36] unbelievable
[1:46:38] Hallelujah
[1:46:43] amen you know we talked about Unwritten
[1:46:46] words here and I'm gonna I'm gonna wind
[1:46:47] it down here I just wanted to I wanted
[1:46:50] to get to something if I
[1:46:54] um
[1:46:56] let me close with this I'll close with
[1:46:58] this
[1:47:00] you know when I talk about Unwritten
[1:47:01] word
[1:47:03] amen
[1:47:04] I believe that you could take everything
[1:47:06] back to the Bible
[1:47:08] brother Branham believed you could take
[1:47:09] everything back to the Bible
[1:47:11] but there is an Unwritten word
[1:47:14] amen it's called Revelations let me let
[1:47:16] me I I just I'm going to give this to
[1:47:18] you let me I give you an example of
[1:47:20] Eliezer and Rebecca for the unwritten
[1:47:23] word for Rebecca when she did the
[1:47:25] unwritten word but there's two more
[1:47:26] examples you know another example was
[1:47:28] when Jesus asked the disciples who do
[1:47:30] men say that I am
[1:47:33] why was Jesus answering asking
[1:47:38] because it wasn't written
[1:47:42] amen it wasn't written or the people
[1:47:44] didn't understand and you know they said
[1:47:45] oh you know they all these other things
[1:47:47] and then Peter said Thou Art the son of
[1:47:51] God
[1:47:51] you know
[1:47:53] and what did Jesus say to him he said oh
[1:47:55] you did really good reading that in the
[1:47:56] Bible Peter that was under Luke 13 5.
[1:48:01] thank you brother
[1:48:03] he said blessed are you Simon by Jonah
[1:48:06] for flesh and blood and the written word
[1:48:09] never revealed that to you
[1:48:12] see it was the
[1:48:15] taste
[1:48:17] spiritually
[1:48:19] said Flesh and Blood never revealed that
[1:48:21] unto you what was the other one here
[1:48:24] amen
[1:48:27] amen
[1:48:28] the other one was the three Hebrew
[1:48:30] children the unwritten word you know
[1:48:32] when they did the three Hebrew children
[1:48:34] they wouldn't fall down worship the idol
[1:48:36] remember we just read the quote at the
[1:48:38] exact same time that message Believers
[1:48:40] will worship an idol worship a big
[1:48:42] something
[1:48:44] at the exact same time God will be
[1:48:46] taking the true message believer and
[1:48:48] give them Untold Revelation discernment
[1:48:50] visions and dreams okay John written
[1:48:53] word okay
[1:48:55] exact same time that was happening when
[1:48:57] the King Nebuchadnezzar made the decree
[1:48:59] for everybody worshiped the image and
[1:49:01] the three prohibits from them never come
[1:49:02] down he brought him up and he said okay
[1:49:03] now we're going to make the sound again
[1:49:04] loud and you'll fall down
[1:49:07] don't don't bother yourself with that
[1:49:09] fancy worldly music because I don't have
[1:49:11] a taste for that world of music I just
[1:49:13] have a taste for the you know you know
[1:49:14] once in a while almost every single
[1:49:16] night we listen to brother Brown when we
[1:49:18] go to sleep that's a really good
[1:49:19] practice you could never go wrong with
[1:49:21] that man I you can afford an iPad and if
[1:49:23] you can't afford it the church
[1:49:26] no I won't even take it over the office
[1:49:28] the church will give you the ties to
[1:49:30] actually get an iPad you can put it
[1:49:31] right by your nightstand and you know
[1:49:33] lots of times we'll go to bed and we'll
[1:49:34] do whatever once in a while we're there
[1:49:36] I want to say
[1:49:38] I can't go to sleep are you going to put
[1:49:40] brother Brown
[1:49:42] I'm trying to go well aren't you going
[1:49:44] to turn the profit on
[1:49:46] but once in a while
[1:49:48] once in a while we'll turn on some music
[1:49:52] and unless it's a CD
[1:49:53] if you happen to turn on Christian radio
[1:50:03] it'll be somewhere between rock and roll
[1:50:05] and Brew glass
[1:50:09] it was only okay
[1:50:13] around Christmas
[1:50:16] you can't even tell the difference and
[1:50:18] he's here here and here that he
[1:50:20] portrayed Daniel 3 23 and here at Daniel
[1:50:23] he said the three Hebrew children they
[1:50:25] threw the three Hebrew children into the
[1:50:26] fiery furnace
[1:50:28] now yo yet I got a question for you how
[1:50:30] many people did they throw in the
[1:50:31] furnace
[1:50:32] three how many people wrote down to be
[1:50:34] thrown in the furnace
[1:50:35] great thank you in verse 24 King
[1:50:38] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:50:39] became astonished why did he become
[1:50:41] astonished
[1:50:43] because of the unwritten word
[1:50:47] yeah the written word was we're putting
[1:50:49] three in the furnace
[1:50:50] yep they wrote a degree
[1:50:53] you know all that fancy stuff
[1:50:56] but when God came on the scene they
[1:50:58] didn't need that
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:00] Jesus I
[1:51:07] and the Fourth Man
[1:51:09] like every time it was Unwritten word
[1:51:14] didn't just look like the son of God
[1:51:17] but he actually was the son of God
[1:51:21] the king said hey hey didn't we write
[1:51:23] down that we put just three men in the
[1:51:25] furnace
[1:51:27] they said yep king that's all that's in
[1:51:29] the records it's three men
[1:51:31] and he said
[1:51:37] but I see four
[1:51:41] and I recognize
[1:51:43] my brother Matt I get a question
[1:51:46] he was pagan
[1:51:49] heathen
[1:51:52] he wasn't God's chosen like Nation
[1:51:55] before the Holy Ghost came
[1:51:57] before Jesus came
[1:51:59] true sacrifice
[1:52:01] he never went to Bible School
[1:52:03] they never had prayer in the school
[1:52:06] not even the Lord's Prayer
[1:52:13] and you're having trouble recognizing
[1:52:15] Jesus
[1:52:18] hello
[1:52:22] and he said
[1:52:26] I see four
[1:52:29] and I ain't never seen them before
[1:52:32] I never read the Bible
[1:52:34] and I never went to cemetery
[1:52:38] and I definitely ain't in the
[1:52:40] predestination plan of God
[1:52:43] but I'm pretty sure
[1:52:50] Revelation even comes to an unbelievers
[1:52:55] it did do them no good
[1:53:00] didn't do them don't yet
[1:53:03] I said I'm sure that's the son of man
[1:53:07] it's up to God oh oh my goodness I gotta
[1:53:12] shut her down
[1:53:16] I close with this we could stand you
[1:53:18] know when you talk about this Unwritten
[1:53:20] word our Prophet said
[1:53:23] I I was
[1:53:25] I was I was toying
[1:53:27] with that when I was studying I said you
[1:53:29] know
[1:53:30] I know you got to be careful when you
[1:53:31] start going in untreated Waters and I
[1:53:35] know what God was giving me but I was
[1:53:36] wanting
[1:53:37] I was wanting some
[1:53:39] flesh on it you know Sister Patty
[1:53:43] I'm like Unwritten word you got to kind
[1:53:44] of be careful with that kind of stuff
[1:53:46] because I always preach that
[1:53:49] if you couldn't find it here brother
[1:53:51] Matt
[1:53:54] huh
[1:53:56] I looked in the message
[1:54:00] the prophet said 64 times
[1:54:03] he said a lot more than that if you just
[1:54:04] change one word
[1:54:06] but he said 64 times
[1:54:10] to read between the lines
[1:54:13] he actually said I could tell you just
[1:54:15] by paraphrasing an upper I just I'm
[1:54:18] trying to stop
[1:54:19] he said you can't even read your Bible
[1:54:22] properly
[1:54:25] and it came on a rare thing that the
[1:54:28] king required
[1:54:30] he said you can't even read your our
[1:54:32] Prophet said president he said you can't
[1:54:35] even read your Bible properly
[1:54:38] unless you read
[1:54:40] between the lines
[1:54:43] and I just in the kitchen I just had one
[1:54:45] of those runarounds the Wind wasn't
[1:54:47] there and I looked
[1:54:49] like I was just like losing my mind
[1:54:53] and actually when I started to dig that
[1:54:55] up I searched it and I had just you know
[1:54:57] how when you start punching in he's like
[1:54:59] read between I think read between he
[1:55:02] said like 70 sometimes but I wanted to
[1:55:05] get read between the lines and he said
[1:55:07] that's 64.
[1:55:08] so I'm punching it in my iPad and my
[1:55:11] computer and I was like read and every
[1:55:13] word it's like like read it was like 10
[1:55:15] million and then it was between and it
[1:55:17] was like 70 some and then between the
[1:55:19] lines it dropped to 64.
[1:55:22] and I just went
[1:55:25] could really preach tomorrow
[1:55:29] no
[1:55:31] because I have God's prophet and his
[1:55:34] word which is
[1:55:38] just amazing
[1:55:39] and the word of God is my backup
[1:55:42] amen wow
[1:55:45] God bless you
[1:55:47] here
[1:55:48] they're real easy to preach to
[1:55:51] amen
[1:55:54] amen this this is
[1:55:57] the saying about Harvest Time bright
[1:55:59] Tabernacle right
[1:56:01] it's it's
[1:56:03] this is just
[1:56:07] amen I want to leave you with this just
[1:56:09] remember this please remember this
[1:56:12] don't defile yourself
[1:56:14] but it's a king's meat and how you live
[1:56:18] is what you believe
[1:56:21] I see you doing so I see you smoking I
[1:56:23] know you think that's okay
[1:56:25] I see you wearing pants you think that's
[1:56:27] okay
[1:56:28] I see you cut your hair you that's your
[1:56:32] testimony
[1:56:33] amen
[1:56:34] if I see you partaking in movies that
[1:56:37] have The Taste of
[1:56:42] and that's all you've used the internet
[1:56:44] for
[1:56:45] that's how you live your life
[1:56:47] it reveals Who You Are
[1:56:50] amen
[1:56:51] it certainly ain't the chosen
[1:56:53] unless it was for
[1:56:56] collectify
[1:56:57] amen but I want you to leave you with
[1:57:00] this so it starts to try to say
[1:57:02] as we come down
[1:57:06] it's going to be a great separation
[1:57:08] because the difference between idol
[1:57:10] worship
[1:57:11] and Revelation is going to be
[1:57:13] unbelievable
[1:57:15] it's going to be
[1:57:16] unbelievable it will be as far as the
[1:57:19] East is from the west and farther than
[1:57:22] that
[1:57:23] it'll be farther than that
[1:57:25] and that's why if you're sitting in out
[1:57:30] if you're let me rephrase that that was
[1:57:32] self-serving if you're in fellowship
[1:57:34] with Jehovah you will be as far as the
[1:57:38] East is from Sister Patty when you go to
[1:57:40] work you must look
[1:57:42] when I go to the rest you know me
[1:57:45] somebody see
[1:57:47] like
[1:57:48] and let me back that up Sister Patty or
[1:57:51] myself
[1:57:52] you know what it ain't just about your
[1:57:54] luck it's what your cat it's it it's the
[1:57:56] atmosphere it's the stuff
[1:57:59] you can't see see I got a tie on this
[1:58:01] morning but I wouldn't look no different
[1:58:03] if I didn't
[1:58:04] if I had my blue jeans on
[1:58:07] because it's this stuff
[1:58:09] that you're a Creator and you so you
[1:58:12] just carry yourself like
[1:58:14] okay I'm closing
[1:58:16] like the slave let his dad back home was
[1:58:19] a king
[1:58:26] he was still a Slave
[1:58:28] I said I'll buy him
[1:58:31] because when you just go you're you're
[1:58:33] you're just
[1:58:35] you just
[1:58:36] I'll take them that's who I want right
[1:58:39] there how'd they recognize it the same
[1:58:41] way King Nebuchadnezzar recognize
[1:58:44] somebody
[1:58:45] like
[1:58:46] oh my
[1:58:49] wow
[1:58:51] I'm trying to
[1:58:52] it's just
[1:58:54] see how easy you know the prophet said
[1:58:56] he said I could preach forever
[1:59:00] and it would take near as much out of me
[1:59:01] to see in One Vision
[1:59:04] I never seen a vision but I can see what
[1:59:07] he's saying about preaching forever
[1:59:09] because
[1:59:10] it's just it's not the person
[1:59:12] if you ever realize it has nothing if
[1:59:15] it's of God it's not the person
[1:59:18] I couldn't
[1:59:24] he loves you unbelievable
[1:59:29] Hallelujah
[1:59:32] thank you Lord
[1:59:34] amen
