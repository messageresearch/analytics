king of chose her you'll be accepted by the king the lord jesus because he chose you how could he deny what he chose oh my jesus hallelujah well we're just honored and blessed to have brother emmanuel and sister grace tom be with us and we're thrilled to have the fifo ministry coming back through and putting covet behind us and hearing some wonderful men of god and just uh just amazing man uh just look forward to that well i believe i believe next sunday brother henry or his pastor is preaching if it's pastoring here brother henry jax is preaching next sunday amen that's just beautiful we also want to announce uh uh i believe it's next sunday convention starts in ottawa convention is from the last weekend of august to the first weekend of september in ottawa pastor samuel's church and many brothers are coming through from all over the world brother ben's opening it brother ben norad and me and luanne are going from tuesday to friday we'll be home both sundays um but we're going to be there tuesday friday and also i want to mention before our brother comes that uh because we were close we had a great time at pastor jose's in kitchener and joint fellowship just was just beautiful but but right before we went brother jim had three heart attacks and so he'd actually had a shower and he and he had some chest pain and he his sister-in-law took him into the hospital and while they were actually putting the ivs in he had heart attacks and so i was asking brother john said i said what was that like because if he would have been at home he he just would have died he said i didn't even know until the doctor said you just were out and we just shocked you back amen it's beautiful to have the peace of god that there's just no fear in death at all man you can just you can whether i go or stay it's up to you look hey man today it's just beautiful like paul said you know to die is gain and to serve him as the love of christ man it's just beautiful so matt damn this to me uh uh maybe it's all right um anyway so we just prayed for brother jim so he was actually shipped to windsor and uh they put a stint in him and uh but he's doing much much better me and brother emanuel went and seen him last night and also remember her sister linda she's just so so their household she's she's completely bedridden completely bedridden and now brother jim is very weak he his heart was operating at 26 percent and so it was so low they had him on oxygen um so much of the time he meant so uh but you know but he was uh walking good and he was doing stairs good when we were there so so we praise god for that so maybe we can sing uh more than ever before lord i love you it's our brother emmanuel comes and just look forward to the word of god and just welcome you all here just it's just amazing you're you're we're all his bride we're all his wife i mean it's just it's just beautiful to be together the family the family of god amen [Music] more than ever before learn i need you and more than ever before [Music] for more than ever [Music] i want to tell you [Music] more than ever before one more time let's sing that song more than ever before lord let's raise our hands to the lord [Music] lord i need you more than ever before i want to tell you [Music] i love you now more than ever before hallelujah is that they deserve your heart to love the lord we're here in march your family amen and uh surprisingly my sister is here and my brother-in-law brother bennard god bless you ruth brother bernard amen so at this time that's thank you musicians amen you know every time we come into the house of the lord i i believe it's a time to come to meet with god i i really don't believe in just doing religion as a formality because what's happening in this last days there's a lot of religion available a lot and the prophet said that religion is just a covering so we want to go beyond just coverings because we want to come into the presence of god because we believe that there's a rapture take about to take place and where i've written my walk with the lord i want to be sure that i know him in the power of his resurrection is that right i mean i believe in big crowds sorry let me correct that small crowds of or big crowds doesn't really matter to god what god wants is the heart because what good would it be if you had 500 people in this building and christ cannot even find two who can have faith in him so i trust that we won't look at numbers and that's why you know when brother dale invited me to come back to speak i i counted an honor because some preachers only go where they are numbers i believe that wherever god's children are even if it's one i want to go where god sends me amen so i want to encourage your faith this morning we're going to touch a little bit on faith just to encourage you to keep fighting this fight and i trust that god will speak to your heart individually amen so once again thank you brother dale for the invitation may god continue to bless your ministry and the work that you're doing here i will keep praying for you amen so without wasting much time let's turn to the scriptures in genesis chapter 22 genesis 22 14 amen this morning i want to speak on possessing the gate of the enemy amen let's read and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jiren as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sun which is upon the seashore now here is where we are taking our text from and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice god bless the reading of the scriptures you may have your seats amen so if if we go back to verse 17 when god is giving the promise he says thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies now if you notice closely the scriptures is not saying gates singular the gate of his enemies and i believe that this has a significance to us christians today because you see there's only one god and there's one devil the prophet says there's only two forces in the world today the force of god and the force of the enemy and this morning there is a warfare going on and i believe we are coming to the climbers climax where those two forces are coming to our showdown and you're either identified on the side of god or you are on the side of the enemy there is no neutral grounds is that right so we want to be sure we want to be certain on which side we are on because the showdown is coming where they you know in world is what they call no man's land but let me say this with god there's no such a thing you're either on god's side or you are on a devil's side or amen so looking at that thought where god is saying that you will possess the gate of your enemy it means that there's only one control center not two not three not five only one the gate of the enemy that's very important you see if in this building for example we have multiple gates or let's say doors we have one at the back we have one on this side there's one in here so if thieves want to break into this building they have many points of access all right but if you only had one entrance there you won't have to worry about what's happening on this side or this side that's where you have to watch that right and so god is saying that there is only one gate and you are going to possess the gate of your enemy so you are going to be standing at the place where satan has access to the building is that right so that you can focus on your enemy and i want to zero in on the enemy this morning because satan has one objective one objective and that is to kill to steal and to destroy amen so by god placing in that position as a christian it means that you control who and what comes into the kingdom isaiah 54 says no weapon listen no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper okay you've got to believe that i have to believe that no weapon that is formed against the jared shall prosper and every town that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn that is the promise to the believer oh i wish that christians today could recognize what god has given them you know i believe we are coming to a point where we've got to rise up saints of god we've got to recognize who we are gone are the days of saying i i hope so or or maybe you know i'll make it in you either have you you're either in or you're out amen and i trust this morning by the grace of god you can begin to see yourself in the promise of god and like you know the prophet gave a story of that boy who went to i think his auntie's house or i forget exactly but he saw a mirror and he went before the mirror away and the boy in the mirror went he dug down perhaps and the boy got down and after a while he said mama that's me that's me so god wants you to look into the mirror of the world and not just say oh i see paul well i see peter well i i see our brother branham but what about you you've got to come to a place where you can say papa that's me in the mirror and you are written in the scriptures the problem is that a lot of us when it comes time to taking the word and saying ah i see myself in the word the bible says in malachi for behold i send you elijah the prophet so you have a place in the scriptures because without you what's the point of elijah of malachi 4 sorry see malachi 4 came because of you and you are identified in the scripture so you have a program to play god sending a prophet in this age wasn't just to to come and broadcast brother branham and brother branham and brother brown we have so much of god her son a prophet but what about the bride now who has a position or a calling in this hour the final voice to this final age is you sense of god and i want you to recognize yourself according to the promise of god because the enemy is going to challenge you and he will come in the forms that you least expect hallelujah so jesus said in saint john 10 he said that he said this then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you i am the door to the sheep you see where jesus placed himself at that door okay all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them listen i am the dog singular by me by you because you are the one to possess that gate of the enemy so the same is the the same is typed with jesus because he places himself at that door being the door all right says if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture now the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy okay satan operates in a threefold manner always remember that everything god does satan will patent himself after the same the same person as god all right jesus said that i am the way the truth and the life he says and i came that you might have life and have it more abundantly and watch the enemy every promise that every one of those attributes of christ satan is here to match it to steal to kill and to destroy you but i thank god that greater is he that is in me hallelujah than he that is in the world you've got to recognize who it is that is in you and that's why the preaching of the world is to bring into a recognition of who you are and how do we how do we know who we are is it because i tell you no because i'm just a sinner saved by grace but jesus is here today and i believe that's why the holy spirit is so important in the church because without the new birth without the new birth saints of god you are none of his okay i am not talking about the letter of the word because the bible says that the letter killeth but the spirit give it life so we've got to take the mechanics and the dynamics so that it can produce the spark of the gospel because the world today is looking not for more religion but they want to see jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and who else can represent christ in this age but you hallelujah god loves you god loves you how many can say amen to that if god didn't love you you would not be sitting here or you would not have you won't even be sitting under this ministry you won't have come this far in your journey you see the prophet said that christ was sorry the bible says that christ was slain before the foundation of the world in god's mind jesus was slain and the prophet said that god did not send jesus to calvary so that somebody could have pity on him you know this pity gospel of oh give your life to jesus because you know he died for your sins and she feels sorry for what he went through all the pain and the agony that he suffered no no no no god said that i mean the prophet said that god does not run his business like that it's not based on pity he came because he knew exactly who would be in and who would be out so jesus's death was only meant although he died for the sins for the sin of the world but he knew that not everybody would receive the sacrifice that he made on calvary so he his coming was meant for you you who was ordained before the foundation of the world amen so god has placed his children in a position of power and authority over the affairs that take place in the kingdom of satan i'll say that again slowly god has blessed you sister luanne brother matt i'm sorry to mention your names i know a few believers brother bernard all of you believers god has placed in a position of power and authority and by virtue of that that means that you are in control of what happens in this kingdom okay then the bible says said that he has made us priests and kings what was the king for a king rules over a kingdom i don't believe for one minute that when the rapture takes place takes place we will just barely make it out of this place i want to leave this earth and when i'm gone satan says they're gone i want him to say that i'm glad that they are out of here you see wherever jesus went demons trembled to the extent they said that have you come to torment us before our time without speaking a word is that right because jesus carried a power within him he was full of so much of the power of god his life was atonement to the enemy and that's where we should come to that it's not just about religion but wherever you go at school young people at your workplace you live such a life until demon powers recognize who you are see if jesus did it then so can we do it today i want to come to a place where when i walk into a grocery store for example without speaking a word demon powers will bow not to me but to the god that lives in me and that's where we are coming to by the time we leave this world it should be such a sigh of relief for the enemy to say thank well you can't say thank god but at least they're gone because there's going to be three and a half years of tribulation that's coming upon this earth jacob's trouble and it's going to be so bad not so much for those who never heard the gospel but for those who heard the gospel and rejected it it's a time of purging those who heard the gospel being preached and under the sound of the gospel they failed to take heed to the warning of god they failed to go and receive the promise of the holy ghost the tribulation period is not just a time of trouble for the world but a time for those people who were just religious church goers and they failed to take the promises of god to get their lives correct it would be a time of weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and how many people would say i wish i wish i had taken heed and perhaps this morning you are receiving that call that warning in your heart to come to christ because i'm not here to present to brother dale's church we are here brother dale is striving to present you to christ we are preaching jesus not no man because all that are in christ jesus will come up in the resurrection those are the ones who are going in the rapture is that right so we are here to present jesus to the people and we don't want to preach a dead gospel either because the paul says i came not in word only but in the power and in the demonstration of the gospel that is so lacking today and sad to say that a lot of people when i say a lot of people let me say this way so-called christians they just know the letter of the word no prayer life when you don't have a prayer life church of god you are powerless before the enemy because jesus is greater success it's not so much when the miracles happened what people saw which was when he spent time praying out in the mountains praying to the father waiting on on the father to anoint him so when he came out to perform miracles it was just a mop up operation and we need to pray you need to have a prayer life where you spend time with god in your closet develop a relationship because that's when god speaks to you when we come to congregate like this it's only what one hour of preaching of the world then you go home and you have the whole week you come back wednesday let's say that's not enough you've got to develop a relationship with christ spend time reading your bible read the message pray and i'm not talking about like just five minutes and saying lord well thank you for the food and thank you for this day bless us as i go to sleep amen no spend time you know when you're in love with somebody to those who have been who are married now during courtship you can't wait to hear the voice of that special one i mean if it means talking for two hours who cares you know why because you're in love because you're in love so when you're in love with jesus spending time with him it's not just a quick affair and that's where the power of the church lays but a powerless life it means it's a prayerless life and you can't meet the enemy just by intellectual amen satan is a creature who has been around or let me say this way he has studied the program of god for the last 6 000 years he was in heaven so he knows a lot more than what a lot of us know so if we think that we're going to meet him on intellectual grounds we're mistaken because when he met jesus after jesus received the holy ghost and he went to be tempted in 40 days look at how he came to him it is written he was using the word to quote the word and if you think that by knowing just the bible or what the prophet said i'm sorry i've got sad news for you satan knows all those things but you've got to come to the place where him god christ is living in your heart and it's no longer your efforts or my mind or my intellect but it's christ now manifesting his life in you because jesus met him with the word i think last time we preached on it's written when i came you see but satan also being an intellectual creature he also knows this bible so it was word for word word for word but eventually what did jesus say says get thee behind me satan because he knew who he was okay he knew who he was and you've got to recognize who you are today amen now in war you know in the natural now right now ukraine and russia are at war we all know that i believe before putin went to ukraine he must have spent a long time perhaps years or months preparing for this walk i don't think he just woke up one day and says well let's go there's preparation that's needed and you see he had to study to know his tactics and who is going to fight all right the same thing applies in the spiritual you've got to know the tactics of the enemy because if you go to war without knowing having a strategy or knowing how the enemy fights you might get killed okay and let's look at a few of satan's tactics and i'm taking this from uh brother branham when he was in a prayer line because he's in a prayer line that he identifies a lot of the spirits that we're tormenting people especially when it comes to sickness so we're going to look at a few about five or six of the of these what i did is i took snippets of quotations so i will not mention the whole thing just snippets so that you can see where satan operates okay the prophet says and now this man is standing here before me listen and satan has plugged his ears to make him walk before a vehicle or something and be killed on his feet trying to do this harm to this poor brother but we are here to make him whole father he has plugged the ears of a poor innocent creature of god remember what i said in the beginning satan came to kill to steal and to destroy all right number two satan has talked to you i'm quoting the prophet now satan has talked to you try to get you to doubt that and get away from that but you held out do the same thing your stomach trouble will be gone if you do that so number one plug the ears number two talks to you okay satan talks oh yes he does okay number three the prophet says our heavenly father you who created this man who brought him here to the earth and he's just here a youth says he means so much to your kingdom father among young men today that's gone astray but he wants to serve you how many today want to serve god young people they have the desire to serve god listen but he wants to serve you and satan has bound him but now thou has him to be healed these are the tactics of the enemy okay just bound him because him being a youth he wants to take advantage of because the bible says remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth there's something about youth and satan knows if he can get you young people while you're still young he has a lot of potential look at the stars of the world today the movie stars and the and the great singers a lot of them the satan gets them when they're still in their teenagers young so that you can get maximum service out of them all right all right let's look at number four the prophet says on your mental conditions that you feel strained and upset all the time depressed says is that right many times listen to this one satan has told you you've crossed over the line another tactic of the enemy you have crossed over the line oh this hits so many christians god does not love me god does not care for me god forgot about me long i've heard people say this god forgot about me long ago another tactic of the enemy so if the devil can get you to believe that he knows that he has conquered you and you've got to cast those thoughts aside don't ever let the enemy tell you that you have crossed the line in fact if he says that to you just think about it the bible says he's a liar because he cannot tell you the truth he can never come and tell you the truth so it means that there is hope for you amen says you have satan has told you've crossed the line but he has lied jesus christ has healed you praise god number five dear father this is still brother burnham praying he says dear father i realize that satan has set a trap there you go and now he's caught our sister for her to have to have one of these brain hemorrhages now and leave the world premature death set a trap the last one friends this is the prophet now quote i'm quoting the prophet says friends satan has got something to pattern or impersonate anything god has another tactic of the enemy okay listen all the things that he has he had to impersonate god with it but where there is a false there's got to be a true one somewhere for it to be made off of or it won't be false you've all heard of counterfeit money well where does it come from you've got to have the original somewhere because the the counterfeits is always made after the form of the original one and satan has nothing original because he cannot create there's only one creator and that's god okay so his job is to pervert the original creation of god and we're going to see a few of the things that satan is perverting in this age all right do you realize that the very demon spirits behind sexual orientation they try to pattern after the scriptures to justify their evil ways all right look today what's happening i mean brother dale you just look back what 15 20 years ago how much things have changed in the last five ten years and before we go into that let's read this scripture in genesis 1 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them this year is one of the scriptures that is being used today to justify sexual orientation or let me say perversion in the beginning god made a man he made a man a man and he made a woman a woman now adam when adam was created in that spirit being of adam was both male and female but god eventually said no i need to separate the two god made that decision and then out of that he put adam in a deep sleep performed a surgery took a rib from his side and created the woman and when adam looked at this woman he says oh my this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone and then god took the female spirit and placed it in that body and since then that program of god has never changed so you can't find anywhere in the scripture where god has a man coexisting with a woman's spirit in him you will not find in the scripture if god separated the two let's keep it that way all right god made adam it wasn't adam and steve it was adam and eve i know this is not popular to preach but we are going to stand with the bible the laws of man will change and be twisted but there's coming a day where we've got to face the one who wrote the scriptures and we should stand in this hour and be fearless against the invasion of this demon powers that are coming up to tell people that oh you know what if if if you're a girl and you feel like you know you're trapped uh in you know i don't know you feel like you're a boy what nonsense god made a boy a boy maid a girl a girl how can you suddenly start feeling like oh i'm a girl trapped in a boy's body that is a perversion right from the pits of hell oh i know it's not popular our kids now are facing these spirits when i was in school just a few years ago we didn't hear these things my daughter she went to register for middle school and we went to uh to tour the school just before they closed in june and when we walked in the building the first thing that i saw was a table spread out and the material on that table was about homosexuality right at the forefront because this is the agenda of the enemy to start programming the minds of these young children to believe that if you are a a girl and feeling trapped sorry a boy feeling trapped in a girl's body or vice versa you have the right to change that is a direct insult on the creator himself you cannot change you might change this form and do surgery and whatever science can touch but the spirit no man can change that spirit because that came from god is that right so how can a man tell me that you have a right to change what god created you are literally insulting god in his face when you feel that you can do all these things is that right satan comes to pervert the original let's take another example in jeremiah 17 verse 7 and 8. i'm just showing you two scriptural examples so that you can see where all these demon powers are coming from verse 7 it says blessed is the man that trusted in the lord and whose hope the lord is for he listen to this very carefully for he that's now representing christ shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spread it out listen her roots by the river so a tree that is both male and female how does that make sense it says he shall be as a tree but her roots you see without spiritual understanding we can take these scriptures here to serve our means all right but the bible was written and that's why jesus said that father i thank you that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed it's unto babes such as would learn because many times the bible has compound meanings and god has a way of hiding himself in the scriptures now he is representing christ okay her is representing the bride church because jesus said in saying john 15 says i am the vine and ye are what the branches now does that make jesus a pervert no no but you see when we take things out of context we can use the scriptures and we try and justify this perverted onslaught of satan in his last days jesus says i am the vine and ye are the branches husband and wife just like it was in the beginning so god is constantly representing himself he has he the male part and then you the church male female male female working on the body okay he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing so he the male is the one that energizes the branches his life is the one that flows through the body that's why we cannot do anything on our own jesus said in my own self i can do nothing and so it is with us without him we can do nothing amen so satan takes these types and shadows and he perverts them to accomplish his means listen to some of the these modern names which honestly i i learned a lot of about i learned about these names in the last two years and i'm going to read some of them to you agender or gender fluid i just learned about this like this year non-binary pan gender queer or questioning i didn't even know that exists transgender two spirits where does two spirit come from jesus said as it was in days of lord luke 17 28 to 32. actually just pull it up for me please if you don't mind i want to read that luke 17 28 32. it says likewise also as it was in the days of lot now we all know what happened in the days of lord god burnt that city because of sodomy he says they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it the next verse but the same day that lord went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed the next one in that day he we shall be up skip to okay just leave it there let me read that in that day he which shall be upon the house stop and his staff in the house let him not come down and take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back the next one there we go remember lot's wife now i'm just going to recap briefly what happened in the days of lord basically it was a time when god came down himself because the the sins of sodom and gomorrah had come to a place where god says i need to come down now and investigate what's happening on the earth and with him there was two angels okay and when those two angels came one angel went to visit abraham and the two went to visit lord and when those two angels were coming to lord's house the bible says and the men of the city they saw these angels and they desire to have them i hope you're spiritual enough to understand what what i'm saying they wanted to live with this man imagine angels have come from heaven and these people were so perverted that they could not even recognize when the supernatural was taking place and they desired lot to release those men so that they can live with them well let's just summarize what happened the angels told lord says lord hurry up and leave this place right away because the judgments of god are fixing to strike this city all right god destroyed sodom and gomorrah because of homosexuality and all these sexual perversions that's the height that it had reached so jesus is saying as it was in that time so shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed and if you want to know what happened in the days of lot just look around you just look around you the bible is interpreting itself right before our very eyes if you want to know what the days of noah look like look around you people mocking the gospel saying these are just a bunch of crazy people fanatics oh we might not be popular in the world but it was only noah and his family who was saved so god is not coming for the majority all right and jesus says remember lord's wife you know what lord's wife did she actually started on a journey she was going going with her family but her heart was there and the angels had said don't look back so as she was going you see god help us some of us we have actually started this journey we are literally in motion doing what god wants us to do but because our hearts are still back in the world she turned to look and god made a memorial of what happened at that moment turned her into a pillar of salt and jesus says remember lost wife so this is not a playing game if you're going to serve jesus go all the way don't don't say well i'll just try because you're treading on dangerous grounds amen it's either i'm in with jesus or i'm out hallelujah god wants your heart in this and that's the mistake lord's wife made and jesus is saying in fact the bible even gives her gives this that verse a single line so that it sticks out it's not mixed up with anything else says remember lord's wife and that is just one verse for everybody to see and i believe the church of god is being warned because jesus said that he that will put his hand to the plow okay and turn back is not worthy so we've got to remember lord's wife under the conditions that we're seeing today god help us i wonder if the lord terrorists for another 10-15 years we have small kids eliot felix and so forth brother brown in his time he spoke of rebecca and his heart cried out he says lord does my rebecca have to live and see all this that was years ago probably over 50 years now and his heart was crying out because of what he was seeing at the time now imagine for us parents who have our children being taught these things in school the only thing that i can see is the coming of the lord jesus christ to save us from this perversion of the last days and all parents we need to flee to the cross we need to be at the altar crying for god to help us to give us wisdom to know how to navigate through these dangerous times because it's not easy some of them these are topics that you should not even be discussing their minds cannot take it they are not built to understand these things but yet the enemy is already bombarding their minds with this oh my god have mercy on us hallelujah the spirit of pornography you will be shocked how many believers in this message in this let me say christianity are bound by the spirit and i ain't talking about just single brothers even men who are married come in prayer lines and they confess pornography being bound by that spirit you know why when a smartphone came out oh it sounded fabulous you could now browse on the internet go on youtube and go into a private world you know before it was tv you put it there and everybody can see what's going on but now satan became smart and even called it the smartphone and he makes sure that everybody has one to the extent that you know my wife forgot her phone at home when we're driving she remembered but even myself sometimes i forget my phone at home where's my phone we are so attached so attached to our phone that it seems like we can't breathe without it but how about the bible when you don't read your bible every single day how do you feel lord i'm detached what happened where you know but the phone we breathe and we live with it because it's our world satan call it the smartphone you know why so that you you can be in your bedroom there's no mommy no daddy no husband no wife you can even lock it you know secure it so that in case your wife or husband finds it they have no access so you have this private world where you can go deep into all these things and you just fill your mind and watch anything you want and nobody seems to know what to know what you what you're doing but i have news for you he's watching he knows the very thoughts and the intents of our hearts you know we should come to a place where we are so in love with god that it's not oh who is watching me but lord i am are you pleased with what i'm doing because there's an all-seeing eye and when you know that god is watching every move that you make you are careful what you do and you don't do it because of legalism you do it because of love so pornography it's it's it's it's it's gotten a grip of so many men today and it has destroyed so many marriages now pornography and lust they're really the same spirits people think that when they get married or find a partner that those last spirits will be taken care of no no a last spirit is the last spirit david had how many wives solomon his son had how many a thousand but even david with his 500 he wasn't content he went and took bathsheba the bible says that solomon he loves strange women i'm talking a bit plain next forgive me today but these are the spirits that are plaguing a lot of people call themselves christians and a lost spirit does not end when you come to the altar and you take your beautiful bride or your handsome husband and you think it's over oh no if you're bound by that spirit you've got to get delivered because it will plague you it will affect your marriage and it's just a matter of time and you'll see the manifestation of it amen oh my god have mercy flee to christ because there is no way to escape the demonic powers that have been released upon the earth today young people hear my voice today flee to christ know him in the power of his resurrection know him as your personal savior forget about just knowing you come to church that's good we would that more people came to church but without knowing him what's the use amen we want to possess every gate of the enemy glory oh my time really flies i want to start winding down with this story of david and goliath you know i preached this last sunday at our youth we had a youth service and i mean the lord really blessed us you know when you see the spirit of revival coming among the young people you just have to thank god because we need to see god among our young people amen and so i'm just going to touch on a few things that i spoke on concerning david and i'm going to use uh first samuel 17. okay we're just going to go a bit slow and talk on some points now this is david going to meet to visit his brothers in the battlefield he says and jesse said unto david his son he says take now for thy brethren an effort of this perched corn and these ten loaves and run not just walk but run to the camp of thy brethren because the message is urgent and i believe that's the message today we've got to run okay we have no time to keep walking and just taking our time run and carry this 10 jesus onto the captain of the thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge verse 19 now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines and david rose up early in the morning i like that because you see urgent matters require like you know you've got to be urgent about what you do the bible says a little sleep a little slumber you know it says you will become a poor man poverty will will catch up with you you just want to sleep all the time and be lazy no he woke up early in the morning and he took off and he left the ship with a keeper listen and took and went as jesse just as his dad had commanded him okay so he was not going on his own accord he did not just decide well let me go the father sent him jesus said therefore as the father sent me so send i you so we are also under commandment to go because our brothers are at war some of them are under captivity we need to go like brother dale was speaking yesterday talking about the need to go and preach the gospel because there are those who are bound they need deliverance see and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to fight and shout for the battle okay for israel and the philistines had put the battle in a rape army against army and david left his courage in the hand of the keeper of the courage and ran into the army he did not just walk he ran and came and saluted his brethren and as he talked with them behold they came up the champion the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and speak according to the same words and david heard it big mistake this time goliath uttered words and it landed in the ears of the wrong man i pray to god that you will be that david today who will hear all this nonsense that the enemy is spewing out and change the story around the bible says that the champion but goliath was not no champion and we're going to see david's attitude towards him and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and was so afraid fear right there brother branham said one of the greatest things plaguing the church is the spirit of fear people don't know who they are i'm going to be closing shortly and the man of israel said have you seen this man that has come up surely to defile defy israel verse 26 i'll just jump and david spake to the man that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this listen that was david's attitude to david this was just this philistine not the champion because we only have one champion and that is the lord jesus christ amen he is the champion of our warfare he's the champion of our lives golett is just another philistine and that's the way david saw him as just this philistine hallelujah for who is this uncircumcised philistine he didn't say who is this champion so we've got to change our talk many times we give glory to the devil oh the devil did this oh the devil did that oh the devil is no no no no what about god what has jesus done for you today yesterday last week that you can talk about his goodness amen we need to testify about what he is doing for us you know people come to a place where we're so used to what the devil does to us i'm feeling sick oh my head hurts oh my this my that and it's always what the devil is doing you might not say that way but you see out of your mouth what you confess you are glorifying either god or the enemy so the prophet says that even if you feel pain say by your stripes i am healed you're feeling weak say i am strong let the wick say i am strong amen thank oh my verse 28 i want to jump real quick and elia his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the man and eliab's anger was kindled against david and he said why has thou come either now watch this is his eldest brother the one who should be an example to him he's asking this question what are you doing here david and with whom has thou left those few sheep look at his attitude despising attitude just those few sheep all right oh but who are you you just have a small congregation like what are you you know those attitudes exist in a message if you don't have a big church well just look look what he's got just a few sheep devils the same spirits are still here today despising attitudes instead of saying we are brothers god has given you 20 has given this one a hundred we are brothers we are all working for the kingdom of god what do numbers have to do with this nothing absolutely nothing it's the quality of the spirit that we're aiming aiming for all right and watch he says i know by pride oh i know i just want to be another big minister known in the message that's why you're doing what you're doing just trying to make a name for yourself i know thy pride this was david's elder brother the one who shall be there to encourage him and say brother you have come you brought food join us in battle let's fight together hallelujah and the naughtiness of thine heart first to the one i'm going to jump and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him that's one of the best things to me that saul did one of the best things that he did you know i can imagine when those soldiers came to saul and says you know sir i got news for you great king you won't believe who just came there's this little young boy who just showed up and he's talking of killing the goliath i mean this this this uh this uh this philistine here and i could imagine how they rehearsed all the words to him and described how the bible says he was he was ruddy and unfair to look upon probably like a sexy looking type of a boy in other words what's what's in him what can he do they rehearsed all of this to saul but saul was wise enough he said and he sent for him perhaps the best thing that saul did and when he came to saul well saul said well i i admire your courage young man i really do but why don't you take my armor and try to try what what i got and david tried it on put it on it says no no no no no take this off of me this has not been proven that's what the bible says david said it had not been proven so we want to go with what we know we want to meet the enemy with the things that has been proven and to close the bible says when dave was going to face goliath he took five smooth stones i like that smooth stones well rounded no rough edges you know that's a type of perfect faith and the bible says that he took one not two but one stone and he swung that stone with his slingshot and when he released it one stone is what was used to kill the enemy we don't need to be running all over the place and doing all kinds of crazy stuff just take your simple faith in god so long as it's well-rounded no rough ages your life is is right with god everything is smooth release that one hallelujah and you will see this enemy this philistine come down before your very eyes hallelujah how many today want to possess the gate of the enemy i do i trust that you have come to a place in your life where you want to see god manifest himself in such a way that he's real when you talk about him people can see christ in you when you live people can see christ in you hallelujah do you love him do you appreciate him are you ready to possess every gate of the enemy hallelujah let's turn to our feet sister lawrence could just play that song uh pass me not a gentle savior amen oh [Music] savior [Music] humble cry while [Music] very deep [Music] just raise your hands to him this morning
