Uh me and Luen are are praying about we're planning we got invited to go to uh Mexico in El Salvador. And so we had actually the guy that I had interpreted, Brother Leno had uh I interpreted for him or he interpreted for me, sorry, in El Salvador and and Nigeria. and uh he had called me last year to go at Easter time and I just didn't feel uh I didn't feel to go. I didn't feel for multiple reasons I didn't feel to go and so uh he called me yesterday and asked me to go and so uh if the Lord's willing I mean we're we're just searching. I haven't told him yet for sure, but uh I I felt a lot different this year when he called me the second time to go. They'll have a big convention there at Easter. He said there's I think last year there was 1,800 people there. He said they expect about 1,500 people. And uh last year, Brother Nelson went because I didn't go. And uh and so brother Nelson from Scar Bro and uh but anyway, we just plan on if we go to that convention. It's the first part of April. Uh we plan on [clears throat] going there and uh however long we're in Mexico. The conventions one weekend. He said you could stay and preach in local churches, but we think we will go from there to El Salvador for a couple weeks and preach in the uh capital of El Salvador and go to Pastor Nelson's church. So that's we're just praying for that and just looking for God to provide and make a way that that that would work. Amen. And so we just praise him for that. Amen. Amen. I'm just trying to I think I'll do the books for those that are here. Um we can't wait for uh the weather forever. It might be bad weather till uh till uh April when I'm gone. Amen. That's the only sad part about going to Mexico or El Salvador in April. It'll be already getting nice here. Amen. Um, we'll maybe ask Jeff and Dom and the family to come up first.

Thank you. Amen. We just want to thank those We got a beautiful uh gift and card from Sister Joan. He was just a very My cards I cards that are given from the church I actually keep. And we went this past week, we went to uh brother Luz and brother and sister Margaret's and had our African dinner and we had a a wonderful time. If you ever get a chance to get Brother Leu and and sister Margaret to cook for you, Brother Leu is from uh South Sudan and Sister Margaret is from Uganda and and Brother Leu fled to Uganda because of the civil war and he was right around the village of where sister Margaret was born and raised. But they had to move to Canada to meet each other and got married here. Amen. He was actually in Uganda right around her village for five years. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; But she came to Canada and he got sent to Canada and of course her first desire was his anyway was to go to the States and then New Zealand. But God has a tremendous plan. Amen. Can never fight God. Uh God has the ultimate say and and uh we just praise them for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So if the other ones come in, children, I you know, I know they were planning on being here. It just be the weather, but uh we'll do it at the end of service or we'll do it next service. Let's just stand and read a scripture. I'm not really preaching on this, but I wanted to touch on this current events and I'm I'm just going to touch on this and then uh I'm going to we're going to talk about this on Wednesday nights. Let's turn to Revelations 13. [clears throat] Revelation 13 and verse 4. We'll read verse 4 and verse 8. Just a just a preview and then I'm going to continue my message from last week. And Revelation 13:4, "And they worshiped the dragon which gave power to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying, who is like unto the beast? And who is able to make war with him?" And verse eight, and all that dwelt upon the earth shall worship him whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world. Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll just be with the ministering of the word. And Lord, if there would be any still on the road for the from the snow or the ice, Lord God, please protect them, Lord God, and and just keep them safe. I know I know some had poor tires and were changing their tires needed to and Lord just we don't want one's hurt Lord God. So we pray that you'd have safety for them &gt;&gt; in your name we pray and be with this service Lord and we surrender to your will completely in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I know when we were at brother Lakuz uh he hadn't got your tires on yet, brother Jaft and he said he had got stuck in London on a little incline. And I think his old tires were uh uh very uh well furnished or finished. Amen. For those of you who don't know, this is just uh brother Bram talked about uh Revelations was uh a reflection of the states and uh the everything type everything was numbered God's numerology. See, the states have 13 stars, 13 stripes, and they're represented in 13. And if for those that don't know that the states uh decided to uh take over another country yesterday or the day before and I just I'm not going to preach on that, but I just want to show you some statistics and and show you that we have to be careful that what appears to be good is evil. Amen. And if you look in Revelations 14, just touching on this a bit, but it talks about that in the sight of the first beast. And if you interpret that word to the Greek and and and I've got this off Google, it talks about that word is e n i p i o n. And anybody can have this when I'm done. And it means in the face of or in the presence of and by the blood the secret blood covenant and the world authorities every United States president goes before the pope and it that is it goes before the pope and the Jesuits and that's a face-to-face visit acknowledging him as the image of Jesus Christ. That's that's disgusting, almost repulsive for me to say it. And that's the reason why every regardless of party, it makes no difference to party. It's just uh you know, you know, it was in Matthew where where Jesus or Satan went to tempt Jesus and he offered them all the kingdoms of the earth. See, because how could Satan offer Jesus all the kingdoms of the earth is because their kingdoms are his. So you can think there's a great kingdom here on earth. &gt;&gt; And it's as great as Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lucifer will feed the kids and then he will kill them or sell them for trafficking after. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like don't be deceived by good things that happen. They're they're anointed and of the devil. Here we here the states and many of the Republicans and we could care less about the parties, but many of the people that voted for Trump voted for no wars. And a president that bragged that he was warless bombed seven countries in 25. He's not the boss. &gt;&gt; He's not even close to the boss. &gt;&gt; The Jesuits and the Pope &gt;&gt; are the boss. And if if you even think close to that, you're so strongly deceived, Google could tell you differently. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they go, you know, in the Bible, the words have numbers and en is a number 17:22. The root of the word en means the intermediate and it's between self holy too. And and this word this means that the US presidents are acting as a mediator to the boss Lucifer. Watch this. Remember Satan offered the kingdoms of the Lord, the kingdoms of the earth to Jesus, the Lord. &gt;&gt; They'll be his in the end &gt;&gt; when Satan's bound. But Satan offered them to to the Lord Jesus so he wouldn't have to as a side step that he wouldn't have to be sacrificed. Watch this here. He says the intermediate this this number en22 the root word means intermediate between that they the presidents are wholly given to the pope of Rome and stand as a proxy that are given everything under his authority. And here it shows a picture of the of the last president and sitting in bowing to the pope. And it's got Rome the beast in front of his man, the saints, doing his dirty work. &gt;&gt; A so-called Christian nation that goes around bombing seven sovereign countries and and right this very month is is threatening to bomb like two or three more. They're actually setting up right now to bomb Iran. Amen. Let's read our scriptures and you can you can fill in the blanks. I'm going to read 2 to four and and seven and 8. And the beast that I saw was like a leper and his feet were as the feet of bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. This is where I want to give. And the dragon gave his power and his seat to the great authority. Now just watch how this authority is. Watch how Revelation is talking about it. And I saw the heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed. This and the world wondered at the beast. That beast is Rome. And they worshiped the dragon and gave its power to the beast. And they worshiped the beast saying, "Who is like unto the beast? And who would be able to take war of him?" And it was given verse 7. And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them by the power to and by power was given to him to over over all the kindreds, tongues, and nations. and all that dwelt upon the earth worshiped him and whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life slain before the foundation of the world. If you want to know the countries that the states bombed in 2025, Syria, Iran, Iraq, uh Yemen, Simmon, Naia, and Venezuela all the time telling you on the news that Russia's evil for bombing one country. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lucifer the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Close. You know, you can worship the states all you want and you their wonderful government, but they will be the ones that will force you to worship Rome. &gt;&gt; It will be it would if I was moving the dead last country in the world I would move to. &gt;&gt; Is the USA of the devil? &gt;&gt; I know some of you are just stunned beyond words. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is read your Bible. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you want to go more than your Bible, just show what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; About his own country. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Evil, evil, evil. I I I posted a video. Nobody was brave enough ex in our country or the states to put a like to it. But in Nigeria or in Central America they were that since after about the 50s since World War II the states has overthrew 70 plus governments in the world &gt;&gt; and you think they're wonderful. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You're laughable. &gt;&gt; They're completely laughable. Completely laughable. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know our text that we preached about yesterday, the Bible says that without faith it's impossible to please God. And and I'm going to drive this home and if nobody likes it and it's just me and Len here next Sunday, it'll be fine with me. It's impossible to be afraid and be a Christian. &gt;&gt; You know, on my Facebook, I'll post truthful videos or truthful Bible truths. I erased one yesterday or today. Been on there like a year. I had like four people like it. And the way said, "Well, they're afraid of the government seeing you." Hey, let me just show you something. How the Christians were afraid. The three Hebrew children, they said, "We're not even careful how we answer you, Pope. We're not even careful how we answer you, president. We're not even careful how we respond to you, prime minister, because I am sold out to Christ. And if you come against my Bible, I'm not afraid to put a light to the truth. You say you got the Holy Ghost and you're afraid. You ain't got nothing. You haven't even got faith. &gt;&gt; You got to have faith before you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's impossible to please God without faith. &gt;&gt; And there ain't no fear in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So many people are blatantly deceived. &gt;&gt; Hey, Peter, they threw him in jail. He wasn't afraid. You You think you you're serving [screaming] God and you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and everything's great, but you're afraid. Afraid. Not only if you're afraid, not only do you not have the Holy Ghost, you don't even have faith. So, you haven't even started the beginning of the journey. I I I I don't think many people are Bible readers nowadays. I pray these young families will religiously forget about your daily food and do your bi spiritual food first and then God will take care of all the physical food. I promise you. But if you would read your Bible, Daniel, you know, Daniel, there's no place in the Bible it says you got to, matter of fact, it's the opposite. There's no place in the Bible it says you got to pray with your windows open. It says when you pray, go into your closet. But Daniel, because he was fighting against the the realms of Satan, the government. &gt;&gt; Oh, not many amens in that one. He said, "I ain't changing how I operate as I serve God." Man, a lot of believers could have read that during CO. We really found out who had the Holy Ghost during CO. I'm not [screaming] changing how I serve my God during CO. I'm not changing how I serve my God. Before the government passed a degree that you couldn't pray to no other gods but the king, that's just laughable. Some little squirt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "If I prayed three times a day with my windows open before the degree, I'm praying three times a day after." &gt;&gt; It is impossible. If you're afraid for what I think or what your brothers and sisters think or your wife thinks, that's that's a huge [screaming] part of why you don't see the power of the anointing in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're afraid. [screaming] You're afraid to be ridiculous for Christ. You're afraid to to let go and let God have his way. &gt;&gt; You're afraid what your mama might say or your preacher might say or your brothers or sisters or God forbid the deacons would say, &gt;&gt; you're afraid. If God comes down and an overflowing Holy Spirit and and you want to cry and you're afraid cuz oh, I'm embarrassed. I'm over 20. I shouldn't. I'm afraid to say amen. That's not my style. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here the Bible says in Luke 12:32, it says, "Fear not, little flock, for it's a father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." That ain't subject to who's in government. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm going to give you a shocker. I I I I tell you something that would just blow your mind and I I'm not political at all. So just don't this but Paulie Evan the Conservative party will never get a vote for me and I'll die of old age because of what he said yesterday. He congratulated Trump on bombing and capturing a sovereign country. What a complete breaking international law. [screaming] Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Who who would congratulate somebody for breaking international law but Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Remember the world is his kingdom. He had the power to give it to Christ Jesus before he went to the cross. Said you don't have to go to the cross. Like that's going to be a bad scene. So, I'll just give you the kingdoms of the earth, but worship me. And we go, "Oh, you America, you're such a wonderful country. Why, you're so beautiful and careful, &gt;&gt; careful, &gt;&gt; careful. &gt;&gt; Watch this. When you watch the teams go and play, that's why the prophet preached against professional sports. You watch the teams and somebody will hit a home run, you'll fall asleep in church or or not be afraid to say amen. If somebody hits a home run, they'll do the wave. Oh, praise God. Praise that ball player. &gt;&gt; But when you're worshiping God, you go, "Oh, &gt;&gt; but if you're watching a soccer game or a baseball game, you're like, "Oh, [screaming] let's do the wave. Let's do the wave. I've never seen the wave yet in a Holy Ghost fil church. Who's your Lord? &gt;&gt; You know, if we seen the wave in the Holy Ghost fil church, it wouldn't be waving at the preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Be waving at Jesus Christ. Jehovah, Gyra, the alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Here we just show some fast examples here in in Luke 1:30. It says the angel came to Mary. You know, human flesh is the first thing they do is fear. Oh, I feel God's presence on me. I better freeze up. &gt;&gt; I feel I feel the presence of God. I better freeze up. I better not say glory. I better not prophesy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid God will be wrong. &gt;&gt; God can't be wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm afraid to. You're afraid. You You're afraid that you're Jehovah can't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Here the angel of the Lord said to Mary, "Fear not, Mary, for thou are highly favored of God." without &gt;&gt; God's always been dealing with fear. &gt;&gt; God's always been dealing with fear. And I I said this last week and I say this again, you know, and this coming week, if we and we do, Christ is the head of this church. &gt;&gt; And I could die this week in a car accident or anything. And Christ is still the head of this church. The flesh, the flesh person will change &gt;&gt; because of time and but God and God's Holy Spirit will never change. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Hebrews 8:13. And so the anointing of God comes onto you. And God desires for you to serve him and worship him in a specific way in the body. &gt;&gt; And you refuse &gt;&gt; because of fear. It's not fear of me because that's what I want. &gt;&gt; Anything that God wants here this morning, that's what I want. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we spent our whole life believing and pretending that. And as soon as God would come down and bless somebody or or or do anything supernatural, we're like, I wonder I wonder I wonder I wonder what &gt;&gt; I wonder who's doing that. I I wonder if that's Bible. &gt;&gt; I wonder if the nine spiritual gifts are the Bible. &gt;&gt; I wonder if I should make noise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Know, you can be as quiet as you want. He said the rocks will cry out and worship him. You know, you ever watch the people that are serving Satan? You know, you ever watch somebody get stoned drunk or be at a ball game or any kind of game and and they're in the spirit of the game? &gt;&gt; I've never been there ever once. Well, I haven't been there ever once for over 30 years, but when I was really young and I never ever seen ever an account where the person was embarrassed to be in the spirit &gt;&gt; except in church. &gt;&gt; I've seen that lots of times &gt;&gt; on a regular basis. You go to the ball guy and you want go [screaming] &gt;&gt; the whole the whole building vibrates cuz somebody scored in the last 30 seconds &gt;&gt; but the preacher says something that's amazing word of God and everybody's like &gt;&gt; how come Satan's converts are not afraid to look ridiculous to show the world &gt;&gt; who their Lord is. Hey, what what's a professional singers? &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach on that. &gt;&gt; It's all it's all it's all the satanic symbols. &gt;&gt; Lucifer, you'll see them all. They do a big goal before they go out to sing. They'll do all these things. You know, the Bible says that you you you fail because of lack of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Do you know that every professional sports has a triangle in the thing? I just watched this the the mind control from Cersant from Quebec and he showed the pictures every there there's no there's the the the the wealthy countries of governments of the companies sorry of the world is the money from Lucifer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't think they sell beer and all that without Satan's symbol on it? We mentioned that last week. You know, if on my business card, everybody would recognize the symbol of the cross, but most people will not recognize the symbol around it because you do because you're part of the kingdom of God. You're part of the the the the truth of the message. And you would recognize the eagle with the two-edged sword dividing the word to the very bone of the marrow. You would recognize it. We could put that cloud out anywhere and everybody look out at me looking at a new gate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when they're part of their kingdom &gt;&gt; and they do this or they do sexual scenes or they do this watch the press, you know, I was I was studying when I was studying and said, you know, every speech in the US, I have it on my phone. Would any of you would like to see this? They would always say, we just released 33 files from the Epstein case. We just had 33 of this thing. We just in 33 days we're going to do that. So you know why they do 33 &gt;&gt; because 33 is the highest Freemason level by Lucifer. &gt;&gt; And you voted for that clown. &gt;&gt; I just watched the video where they had a dozen different government officials and they all said, "Well, in 33 days, we had 33 boats. We had we released 33 files of the epsil and 33 we we had 33 vaccines &gt;&gt; because they're part of the kingdom &gt;&gt; of Lucifer. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says if your name ain't in the lamb's book of life, you'll fall for that craziness. It's only those that got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God will give you spiritual eyes and this these scabs will fall off their eyes because Satan don't come in here like a dragon with long tail and a long, you know, and growling and fire coming out of his mouth. No, he comes looking just similar to me, just a little bit better than me. Look, cuz he's got a full robe. He goes right to the ground and he says, "Amen." so sweetly. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But inside, &gt;&gt; he's a raging wolf. &gt;&gt; Seeking whom he can devour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; We We're to the point that we're going to go home in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you got to say goodbye to your fear. Matthew 28, the angel came unto the woman and said, "Fear not, for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified." &gt;&gt; Are we seeking Jesus? &gt;&gt; Are we seeking Jesus in this day? Or are we afraid? &gt;&gt; I read many scriptures last week. You know, there's no there's no fear and love and and and every there everything in the Bible. You wouldn't believe the amount of stuff that speaks about fear. Matter of fact, I had it. Let me go back to the beginning here. I had it. Fear. Fear not. Anybody know how many times fear not is in the Bible? &gt;&gt; 365. One for every day. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and there's different textes. It's actually mentioned in the way of fear not 500 times, but fear not. It's mentioned 365 times. &gt;&gt; I wonder if God was trying to tell us something. &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 41:10, it said, "Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be no matter where you're at, &gt;&gt; be not dismayed, for I am thy God. &gt;&gt; I will strengthen thee. Yay, I will help thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yay, I will uphold thee with my right hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. And yet if you were in public, are you afraid to take a stand for Christ? &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to say somebody asked you a question in in this world that we live in? And they say, "Well, the Bible says we can't do that." That does that make you fearful? &gt;&gt; Not all of us. It does. &gt;&gt; Most it does. Doesn't. See, God can't use you if you're afraid. &gt;&gt; God couldn't have used Daniel if he was afraid to pray and open his windows. He couldn't have used the three Hebrew children that came to the king and said, "You got to bow down and worship me." And they were so bold, they said, "We're not even careful what we tell you, king." &gt;&gt; Not Not only were they not fearful, they were actually bold. We're not even fearful of you. Because you know, like when Jesus stood before the king and and and he was astounded that Jesus never responded to his his little pee-wee thought and he said, "Don't [screaming] you know that I'm a powerful man &gt;&gt; and I have the power to destroy your life or save it?" &gt;&gt; And Jesus being God said, "You have no power at all. You have no power at all &gt;&gt; unless God &gt;&gt; says it's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But our kings, we walked around like &gt;&gt; and it was God that let him do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I'm not afraid of God. See, when you meet your God like Moses did at the burning bush, he was never the same man again. &gt;&gt; You know, I I honestly believe that in in the ranks of Christianity and in the message, people are afraid because they've never really themselves met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; They know all about it. They know what he looks like. They even know how he acts. And they know all the testimonies of their parents. Mhm. &gt;&gt; But did they do you personally &gt;&gt; coming face to face with Jehovah? &gt;&gt; You know, Sister Margaret when we were at their house was telling a testimony of a sister from Uganda and that just literally give me goosebumps, sister that you have to share that someday, but or give me permission to share it. It was about somebody that had died and oh well I I got to be careful because maybe she want to test it herself but beautiful. We're afraid of dying and the people were there bidding them tell come on here come on [screaming] come on we're here we're here to take you home. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet said that the life there is more real than here. Amen. &gt;&gt; She's like, "Oh, [screaming] please don't make me go back to this dirty place in Wyoming, your body was like your glorified flesh was there. &gt;&gt; I'll guarantee you when you get in your glorified body, your all your shoulder won't hurt and &gt;&gt; your lower back won't hurt &gt;&gt; and you won't have a speck on your eye. &gt;&gt; There'll be no glasses there in your glorified body." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless you want to wear them just to look cool, &gt;&gt; but you won't need them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute wait. And we're afraid to go there. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, I was thinking about we we're praying about going to Mexico and I I and Mexico has some of the most unsafe cities in the world. And I and I was thinking, you know, if something happened, Sister Patty, I wouldn't be worrying about nothing back here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, I would literally be in the presence of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In a perfect glorified body, losing my mind, &gt;&gt; stone drunk in the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Worshiping &gt;&gt; my Savior. &gt;&gt; You've never seen me do cartwheels, but when you get over there, oh, you'll see the best cartwheels you've ever seen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we'll do everything we can do to not get there. &gt;&gt; You know, I want to tell you a story. You know, I had I I knew somebody that had bought a new vehicle and they couldn't afford it and it was just by per chance that it was no fault of their own. Somebody come pulled right across the road in front of them and they get t-boned and the vehicle got rode off and they paid off their debt and they didn't have the payments on the vehicle no more. And after it all happened, they got paid off. They think, "Praise God, I don't have that burden no more." And then after a few years, you know, they forgot that that that example and they went out and they bought another big vehicle like that and and this person, you know, distantly and and and I knew somebody that was riding with them and and the person riding with him was getting really agitated cuz we were driving on ice. I mean, the person that was with him and he said, you know, I'm I'm not afraid to meet my maker, but I wasn't thinking of it this morning. And the person that was driving the vehicle said, you know, if I smashed it up, I wouldn't have the payments. And I thought, well, that'd be all right as long as I wasn't in it. You see, we'll do everything we can do &gt;&gt; to not get to heaven. &gt;&gt; You do everything to make it easier for you here. But when it says, now I I'm not saying that we hurry up, but but we're actually afraid. Many are afraid that, you know, if I go to Mexico and the drug lords took me and as long as they uh, you know, killed me fast, it'd be all right. Listen, it wouldn't m I would be so much better off than you here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Help us, Father. I like I would be in heaven &gt;&gt; and you would still be in Wyoming &gt;&gt; in snow. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have to go in the basement and fix the fire. I would never have to make another mortgage payment again. I wouldn't even have to sweep the streets of gold. I'd just go whoop and then &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like there's not fly pus in heaven. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the you you think I'm crazy. I think I'm crazy. But the Bible says that you can't comprehend &gt;&gt; or compare the things that he has in store. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For you. &gt;&gt; That love him &gt;&gt; and you're trying to not get there. &gt;&gt; That's confusing. Or is it because we've never met him personally &gt;&gt; and we're going on our mama's faith or our daddy's faith &gt;&gt; and we're still afraid. See, when we're talking about God and you're one with God, you know, any minister that gets up and preaches, unless he's just naturally got a big mouth, uh he would be scared to death. &gt;&gt; But when he's one with God, Brother Bram said no one should step behind the pulpit unless they've met the pillar of fire face to face. But when he's one with God, it don't have no, it has nothing to do with me except this thing flopping up and down &gt;&gt; because I'm dependent on everything coming from him just going through &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 43 and let's let's hurry up. We'll be here forever. Isaiah 43:1-2. He said, "But now thus sayaith the Lord that created created thee, oh Jacob, and he formed thee, oh Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed thee, and I have called thee by thy name, thou." Watch this. Watch those last two words. Thou art mine. You're mine. &gt;&gt; You're completely mine. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. The only way you could fear is if either you're not God's or you think you're God's too weak to protect you. &gt;&gt; Now, I I tell you what, both of them is not a problem with me. I have no not even it would be impossible for me to think that God couldn't provide for me. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I could tell you testimonies upside down even this church and you know, well, I'm going to tell you one from Wednesday night. You know, God has a way of this is definitely not in my notes. We were here putting up the lights in the fellowship hall and you know because anybody heard of inflation means your money don't go very far. Let me tell you a little story about inflation. You know, when my dad bought his home farm, it was 100 acres. He paid $1,200 for it. $1,200 for the buildings and 100 acres. He made a dollar a day and got his lunch. And you know, if that farm today was worth a million, you'd have to make $833 a day. But that farm is not worth a million. It's worth over two. So if you make if that farm was if you were to buy that farm today for 2 million, you'd have to make $1,666 a day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A day. And that's not counting that you got your dinner for free. &gt;&gt; So you need another 25 bucks on there for that. &gt;&gt; But that farm is actually worth 3 million. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so on today's standard, you need to make $2,400 a day to buy the farm that my dad did 70 years ago to be equal. &gt;&gt; You know what that kind of a lie is? It's called the Rockchilds. &gt;&gt; It's called the World Bank. &gt;&gt; They made it feel good that you got a big number in your bank account, but it don't buy nothing. &gt;&gt; It don't buy nothing at all. You know, I seen a post on on the internet and at and and uh and at at at uh that good they have the root beer stuff. Uh A&W A&W a cheeseburger was 35. A gallon of gas [screaming] was 30 and a brand new car was 3,300. &gt;&gt; Not bad. I'd drive a few cars if I had that price. But I know somebody that was really weak moment and they bought a car that was about 103. &gt;&gt; Now 103 is a lot different than 33. &gt;&gt; Now if you just divide 33 into 103, you got to make a lot of money. &gt;&gt; And we think, "Oh, we're rich." And God's like, "Oh, how am I going to show them? Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'll have to get a pastor that don't have no brains that he'll just surrender to me and he'll tell them the truth even if they all leave. &gt;&gt; You're working for money that's got paper and ink on it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if that government falls, which it will fall because all the kingdoms of the earth fall. All All that's a ll in case you're spelling. All the kingdoms of the earth fall. That paper won't be worth the ink that they bought to put on that money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're putting in front of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; You would go to work to make some of this fake money and miss being in the presence of their brothers and sisters in the presence of Jehovah. shows who your God is. &gt;&gt; You know, I could tell you another story. Not that my dad's long gone, so it's no glory to my dad and and I wouldn't even have but he was up and for his confessions. I want to show you how the oldtimers when when they serve God when they had revival in their day, it was because they were dedicated. &gt;&gt; They were dedicated because you don't have revival today, it's cuz you're not dedicated. &gt;&gt; You're afraid. My dad grew tree foil and it popped in the sun and the seeds were the size of beach sand. He would put a tarp down to catch it and just put it in a teacup. And the guy that bought my dad's tree foil controlled the markets of all Ontario. Taro is a fairly big place if you want to go for a drive. &gt;&gt; And when it was the Sabbath and Brother said when the church doors are open, nothing would stop you from coming. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it would lose the Sabbath, he went to church. &gt;&gt; And if God popped all that tree fo on the ground, which some years he took off 30,000 per farm before I was even born, he said, "Oh, oh well, no big deal. God didn't want me to have it anyway." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they seen God move in their life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because they put him number one. &gt;&gt; Number one. &gt;&gt; Number one. &gt;&gt; Number one. They didn't say, "Well, well, you know, maybe maybe God will forgive me if I backslide today." Number one. If God's number two in your life, he's not even a million. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm afraid. Afraid. You know, Moses was afraid when he left Egypt because he hadn't met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was called of God. He was in the church. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, he was. He was called to God. Prophet Prophets are born prophets. He was called of God. But he ran &gt;&gt; because the people seen him kill some measly Egyptian that was attacking the Jews. But when he met the pillar of fire, they said, "Where are you going, Moses?" He said, "I'm going to Egypt to take over." That was that would be like taking over the states and Russia together combined. Do you know if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you right now, you have more power inside of you, deity, &gt;&gt; than all the governments of the world. &gt;&gt; Every one of them will bow a knee &gt;&gt; in front of me. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch this. &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere. If you have the Holy Ghost inside of you, &gt;&gt; brother Brenham said that deity is not in heaven alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is deity? Jehovah &gt;&gt; gyra. &gt;&gt; That means I am packing deity. That means you're packing deity. And when the Bible says that every knee will bow &gt;&gt; and every tongue will confess in front of deity, guess who they'll be bowing in front of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm deity in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody seen Jesus lately &gt;&gt; in the body? &gt;&gt; I have. I've seen him right here. Jesus, God bless you, Sister Jesus. God bless you, brother Jesus. God bless you, [applause] Sister Jesus. Sister Kim, God bless you, Sister Jesus. Brother Lord. Brother Gar, God bless you, brother Jesus. Sister Dama, God bless you, Sister &gt;&gt; uh Sheila, brain freeze. Sorry. Sister Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Wes, God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. That's right. &gt;&gt; Who's whose hands he's using? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Bible says that he ascended up into heaven. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll go to prepare a place for you &gt;&gt; that where I am that you may come also." &gt;&gt; And but he sent down. But he said, "But wait until I send the spirit." &gt;&gt; What was that? That was him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Wait until I send the Holy Spirit down and then you wake." What? What did it say? They said they would be endued [screaming] with power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's that? That ain't you. That's not me. &gt;&gt; That's God. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Endued with power. &gt;&gt; Who do you think the people are going to bow to? They're going to bow to the [screaming] power. Every knee will confess that he's Lord of lords. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And King of Kings. Oh, it hasn't happened yet. But don't lose faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, when David was anointed king, he was as much king when he was running for his life as he was when he was sitting on the throne. &gt;&gt; He was anointed by the prophet Samuel to be king. And he was running for his life. That's what you're doing. You're running for your life. Don't be too fearful. Remember, remember, remember, remember David wasn't fearful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Tell me one time that David was fearful when he was running for his life. &gt;&gt; I'm listening. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't fearful &gt;&gt; because tell tell me the time that Paul was fearful when they had the shipwreck and they were building a fire and the the the the poison serpent, the snake bit his hand and and the people said, "Oh, oh, he must you he must be a bad guy. You must be a bad guy." because the serpent bit you. And and everybody said, "You you you must have did something bad because the snake bit you." And then he just went on doing his day and he kept growing a foot a year and and his shoulders kept getting wider. They said, "Oh, you must be God. &gt;&gt; You must be God." &gt;&gt; They they went from thinking he was the devil &gt;&gt; to being God. You know, people in the world are very confused sometimes that that the people in church called Jesus Babel, the devil, and the demons [screaming] called him, "Why are you here so soon? &gt;&gt; It's not time for you to cast me out." So when Saul got bit [screaming] by the snake, they said, "Oh, he's the devil. God's God's getting even with him." And he just shook it off because the go because God had told him that he was going before the king &gt;&gt; and he was on the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what, you know, Brother Bram said this, you you need to hear this. Brother Bram said that if you go on a mission trip, you don't have to pray about it. He didn't say that. He said you're 100% always in the will of God. Do you know what we miss in church most of the time, and I'm going to deal with that in the next few weeks when we have our business meeting. We have we have two or three commissions. We do foot washing communion and I I don't even know if we're doing that today, but we have footwashing communion. But it says go in all the world and preach the gospel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so if you leave your home and and it also says this, he said, "If you're not willing to leave your comfort zone and leave your mommy behind or your daddy behind or your brother or your sister or your little pet dog or the little snookle to go into all the world and preach the gospel, you're not even worthy of the kingdom of heaven." But what did God tell us? One thing that God told us to do, travel and preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. travel and preach. He didn't tell us to build houses. &gt;&gt; Houses are fine. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I got a question for you. And and you know, and building churches is fine. It it helps the whole congregation. We we've done that and people have done I'm not preaching against that. I want I want to tell you something. Do you believe Brother was a vindicated prophet of our day? The last messenger to this age? For sure he was. How many churches did he build in around the world? He went around the world seven times. He had millions of dollars at his disposal. How many churches did he build in the poor countries? &gt;&gt; Not one. How many houses did he build? How many times did he preach? Three, four times a day. &gt;&gt; What did What did God tell us to do? Go into all the world and build houses. Build hospitals. Build schools. They're really good. I believe in schools. I believe in hospitals. I might need one someday. I'm not I'm not antihosp. But are you preaching? &gt;&gt; If I can't afford to go into all the world and preach, but I can afford to help somebody put a steel roof on their house. &gt;&gt; I think you're reading the Ukraine. It's not in the Bible like that. &gt;&gt; Go into all the world and preach gospel. God had one goal was that everybody got to hear the good news. You know, Brother Bram said things like this. He said, "It's it's it's unfair that you would hear the gospel preached to boredom. You're bored." &gt;&gt; But in Mexico, they would invite me to a 1500 people convention. And there'll be nobody bored there. &gt;&gt; There'll be not one person bored there. And probably half them will be standing most of the service. &gt;&gt; I'm the same person. I'm no different. &gt;&gt; Help us, father. When I preach in Uganda, there's people getting blessed, slain in the spirit, running the aisles up around the pulpit. There'd be 50 people up around the pulpit. I'd have to go through I I'm still Dale. &gt;&gt; See, they're in the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, they're they're in all the go into all the world and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Well, that was free cuz that's not in my notes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me read a quote in our prophet and we'll get into we'll actually get into our message now. I've actually just got to the top of my message part two. Uh Amen. He said in total deliverance here Vicki if you pull that up that'd be great. 90 59 he said what would he do if we were all in one accord? The only way that we can do that is to unify our hearts together with brotherly love. With brotherly love, obey the offices of the church and the pastor and the pastor. Obey God. Now, we know I'm going to stop here right now. We know the Bible clearly says, "Know those that labor among you." If the pastor ain't in obedience with God, well, then you're in real bad trouble. You need to run for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to run for your life cuz to protect your soul. But if you believe that the pastor's in line with, you know, you know, I I'm going to just, you know, this is our New Year's Eve service. Can I give a testimony? I give a testimony. I learned something in 25. We're still growing, right? We believe the prophet had progressive revelation. &gt;&gt; I learned something in 25. You know, Vicki has done an unbelievable amazing job. Is our sound person. &gt;&gt; There's nobody in this building that's helped me half a quarter as much. Any hard difficulty for me to put my notes on iPads or or answer my phone or any technological stuff, it's normally been Vicki. I want to tell you what I learned in 25. I thought that when you were preaching in a message church, this is very, you need to hear this. I actually believed that when you preached in a message church that there were believers there &gt;&gt; and that so you have believers, believers believe in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? And we believe that brother Brandham came to reveal the secrets of the Bible. &gt;&gt; And this is something I learned 25. I just giving you a little sneak peek. &gt;&gt; I thought in 25 from the very beginning of the year, Vicki put every verse up and every quote that I preached from, &gt;&gt; we had three families leave the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm like, you know, I have my private time with God. &gt;&gt; I'm like, God, did I sin? God, was I under your headship? &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; I'm only a human. &gt;&gt; I'm actually a dumb human. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to lead. Look at how the prophet that the wisest man ever lived said, "God, I have no idea how to lead your people. &gt;&gt; I have no idea how to lead your people. God, what did I do wrong? What other book am I supposed to put up on the screen besides the Bible and the message of the hour?" &gt;&gt; Wow. Fear. &gt;&gt; Fear of the truth. &gt;&gt; You're afraid of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Afraid of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Why do you think God said fear not 365 times? &gt;&gt; Because the believers in the Bible were afraid. &gt;&gt; You know, watch this. You know, there was disciples one time in the Bible. This is definitely not in my notes. And they were out rowing and they were fishing for big old salmon. You know, when we went to brother and sister Margaret's the brother Lagoo's place, he had a salmon there that was as big as a log jar. And it tasted better than a It was good. We ate the next day, brother. And it was woo. It was wow. Amazing. And the disciples are out there fishing and Jesus comes walking along like they're like [laughter] They had just spent with him two hours ago. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question. The Jesus that was with the disciples before they got in the boat, did he look any different when he was on the water? &gt;&gt; I I'll answer that for you. Nope. But they were afraid because their God that they believed them couldn't walk on water. &gt;&gt; Not in their mind. &gt;&gt; In their mind, they said, "Well, God can do this and this and this and this, but he can't walk on water." &gt;&gt; And so, as soon as they seen him walking on water, whoa, that must be a ghost. &gt;&gt; So, I started to tell you a testimony. So, you know, you know, we have a few bills that come in in the church, you know, like we pay the light bill and, you know, few little things like that. And the the income was about half of what it was a year ago. And so when there wasn't no money in the church, Lan got it out of our bank account. And you know, I thought about that some because you know, Brother Brown said, he said, "God, when you split quit paying my bills, I quit preaching." That's what he said. &gt;&gt; You know, I said that to some preachers in Africa and they never seen those quotes before. Brother Brham said, "The day you quit paying the bills, I stop preaching." &gt;&gt; You know what? I don't have to preach. I'm quite fine not preaching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I don't I don't preach cuz I have low self-esteem or I need like you know something to do on Sunday or &gt;&gt; and we were here putting up the lights. Remember I started back at the lights. I got sidetracked but we're back at the lights. My little phone went ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding. And I was like halfway in the light mode. And so I never answered it. And then after a little bit, Lann's phone went ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding. And she answered it cuz she wasn't sitting on the ladder holding the lights like this. &gt;&gt; And it was somebody four and a half to 5 hours away. &gt;&gt; And they said, you know, we haven't had a pastor since March. &gt;&gt; We got a whole bunch of tithes and offerings to send out. Do you got an email that we can send it to your church? &gt;&gt; See, the Bible says this. When the disciples came to Jesus and they stopped the people from worshiping Jesus, he said, "If it's of God, you don't want to be fighting against it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if it's not of God, you don't have to worry. They'll close the doors. &gt;&gt; So, you know what? Like if you don't want to pay the bills here, &gt;&gt; God will have somebody from five hours away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The week before the end of the year when I'm here putting up lights that we bought from camp, &gt;&gt; he jump &gt;&gt; the last I probably haven't seen that person in six to eight months. Probably about 8 months. And before that, I probably hadn't seen him for two or three years. &gt;&gt; Well, if I seen him once a year, that would be max. &gt;&gt; You see, I'm I'm preaching on fear. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're in God's will, &gt;&gt; you what? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's What's the problem? &gt;&gt; And if you're not, you have a right to be fearful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; see, it don't matter to me if God pays the bills. It don't matter to me if I go to the mission field. If you think I go to the mission field and I get there to Uganda, I got there about 4:00 in the morning, 3 4:00 in the morning and and and got up that morning. They they knocked on my door at 7:00. I think I got 2 to three hours sleep and we had four services that day and I preached the second service. If you think that was a holiday, well, you you need counseling because uh &gt;&gt; you know, like when when we went to O Salvador, I just I'm not bragging. I'm just saying if God's in it. See, see, when we went to O Salvador, we got there in the middle of the night on Well, we got there Wednesday morning, like 2 3 4 Wednesday mornings. I preached Wednesday night locally. Five p some pastors came from the capital over two hours away on a Wednesday night. distance didn't mean nothing to them cuz they're in love with God. Now, they only make $25 a day, but they're in love. See, they're not fearful. And so, the local pastor, he asked me to preach in the country. I'm thinking, "Oh, boys. We're going to Nicaragua at we have to get up at 3:00 a.m. to leave at 4:00 a.m. to go about a 6-hour drive. We were 2 hours in customs. Two hours. We never had a chair. There were two hours seeing if they should let us in or not into Nicaragua. And I got to and and you know what I told God? I said, "God, I'd had an experience in the Philippines and God whooped me because I turned down somebody preaching." And I told the pastor in the country, I said, "I'll go." I preached Thursday night. Do you know Thursday night? It wasn't even their regular service. They put up tables out in the parking lot, Sister Patty. They had those lights like string to the trees and that. They have no bugs there. And the middle of the night and they served a full course meal at 1000 p.m. on Thursday night. I'm getting up at 3:00 a.m. to go to Nicaragua. I went to Nicaragua. We got there Friday afternoon. I preach Friday night, Saturday night, twice on Sunday. I tell you what, I slept really good Sunday night. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just saying that. But see, God has to provide. &gt;&gt; And see, it's not because we're do. If God don't want to provide, then God don't want you doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when you're weak, God makes you strong. &gt;&gt; When you're broke, God makes you rich. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you're sick, God makes you healthy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that'll come in the way with that. Fear. If you think that you have to help God because you're fearful, you'll mess everything up. &gt;&gt; Fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's finish this quote. for God work. When God works through the pastor and through the board down in the church and all together are all in united in the kingdom of God, then God will hear. Then God will hear. And when we're unified in a group, then nothing then nothing can bother you. Don't be dismayed at anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Timothy and we're we're just going to go a little bit and and uh here 1 Timothy 1:6. Therefore, put thee in remembrance that I stir up the gift of God which is in thee by putting on of h of of hand putting on of my hands. And verse seven, for God has not given us the spirit of fear. So if you're afraid, where'd it come from? but of power and love and a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the Lord. Now, you know what? When you put on a Bible scripture or Bible prophecy, like I I want to show you something. I put on I put on a little post of what happened yesterday morning and I put on this is Revelations 13 and I put the verses the dragon given power to the beast. You know how many Americans liked it? &gt;&gt; One. Is there no message Americans? No. They don't want to admit that their country is evil. &gt;&gt; Every country is evil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They did in the third world countries. They did from Africa. They did from Central America. One American did. And he said, "Oh boy, is that ever true." &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said the the America was Revelation 13. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the Antichrist. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Wow. Be not ashamed of the testimony of the Lord, nor of me a prisoner, his prisoner, but be thou partakers of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God. Most people take the easy road. You know why most of you wouldn't go visit poor people? It's because it's afflictions. &gt;&gt; If it's hard, not going to do it. Well, you might not be called to it, and I understand you got families or jobs, but do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You know why you have you'll have certain ministry? I I've had ministry right here, and I would ask them about going to other countries to preach where they got nothing to preach. Oh, no. I'm not called to leave outside the states. Uh what's it say? The gospel according to uh wait and be thou partakers of the afflictions. When you see a minister that's not willing to leave his home country for the gospel of Christ, don't invite him here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't invite him here. &gt;&gt; He ain't got nothing I want. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're not willing to be partakers of the affliction of Christ and not be ashamed, I don't want you behind this pulpit. Isaiah 44 or 41, sorry, 10 and 13. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee. Yay, I will help thee, and I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. For I, the Lord thy God, will uphold thee, thy right hand, and say unto thee, Fear thou not. Fear not, for I will help thee. My goodness, aren't these amazing scriptures? Amazing scriptures. How How could we be in a state of fearfulness? &gt;&gt; Isaiah 43 1 and two. But now, thus sayaith the Lord that created thee, oh Jacob, and formed thee, O Israel. Oh, I I've already read this one. I got that double. Praise God for that. Let's go to Joshua 1, and we'll close on this this example in the Bible. Amen. [clears throat] Joshua 1 1:3 and 5-7. Here God was telling Joshua not to fear. And here in one he said now after the death of Moses my servant the Lord came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun. Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise. You can't sit still. God can't use anybody that ain't moving for him. and go over Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I will give thee, even to the children of Israel. And verse three, and every place that the soul of thy feet tread, I have given to unto thee, as I said unto Moses. In verse five, we're going to drop to verse five. [snorts] And this here scripture is perfect for us and you today. In whatever state you find yourself in, there shall not any man, that's quite a few. &gt;&gt; There shall not any man, how many did I leave out, be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life? But you're afraid. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor will I forsake thee. Be strong and of good courage. For unto this people shalt thou divide the inheritance of the land which I swear unto their fathers to give thee. Now here he's bringing it up again about fear. Verse seven. And only thou be strong and very fearful. Oh, no. It didn't say fearful. &gt;&gt; Be very courageous. Now, he's already told him that three times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That thou may observe according to all the law that which Moses thy servant commanded thee, and turn not from the right, nor the left, that thou may prosper whethersoever thou goest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And verse nine, this is the climax of fear. We're going to close on this verse. Have I not commanded thee? Did not Jesus put in the Bible, fear not, 365 times. Every day you do your devotions, you could go, fear not. I'm not sure how the day is going to go. Fear not. I I I'm not sure I can do homeschooling one more day. Fear not. I'm not sure how I'm going to pay the bills the end of the month. Fear not. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have I not I commanded thee? Be strong &gt;&gt; and of good courage, &gt;&gt; and be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed. Now, if you weren't supposed to be dismayed, how could you be fearful? For the Lord thy God is with thee, whethersoever thou goest. That means anywhere that you would travel to go into all the world and preach the gospel. Even everybody watch this. Everybody has a ministry. Not behind the pulpit, but everybody has a ministry. Remember brother Brown said that the mother could be the fifth gospel. &gt;&gt; Mothers are to teach their children. raise up your children the way they would go. Do you know when my wife goes to the mission field, the sisters will ask her questions that nothing to do with the ministry? &gt;&gt; Amen. Does the Bible not say for the older women to teach the younger women? &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not a ministry. &gt;&gt; No. No. We just put it all on one little priest behind the pulpit. &gt;&gt; The older women to teach the younger women. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sounds like a ministry to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us to to come in contact with the pillar of fire. You know, I have at least two more examples in here. Three maybe. You know something I found out in the Bible is it just goes and goes and goes and goes. Every time you read it and study it, it just unfolds and gets bigger and bigger and there's more and more and more and more. &gt;&gt; God's telling his church says, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; You don't have to fear, for he's the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. When he came down in Revelations and he put one foot on the land and one on the sea, that was Jehovah. &gt;&gt; And he's saying, "I'm the boss of the sea and I'm the boss of the land." I'm the beginning and the end. He's all of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God is good. Very good. &gt;&gt; All the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I believe we're going to move communion to next week because the pastor was long- winded and uh very uh long- winded. It's almost 12:00. Soon will be. Amen. I believe we'll we'll just plan on communion next week regardless of the weather. Let's put it this way. We'll even set the communion up. Amen. cuz we've been playing with the weather for three weeks now. Amen. Still many out. But uh but uh Amen. Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; You know, a Aren't you glad that you serve a God that when you wake up in the morning, you don't have to be afraid? &gt;&gt; Aren't you Aren't you glad that you're serving a God Amen. Amen. That's a good one. Thank you, Jesus. [applause] You You You're serving a God that you don't have to be afraid what you put on social media about God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be afraid of going and witnessing for Jesus and how the people might turn you down. &gt;&gt; Because because you're a part of him, you know, you're you're not afraid of getting in the road and driving, you know, because you're God's. &gt;&gt; Nothing can, you know, in Job say, you know, God said to to Satan, he said, "You can go this far." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can you watch this. I I want to You just bring it up today. He said you know when God and Satan you know you know when the watch I I am closing I am going to close eventually when the spirit leaves me. He said when the sons of a man when the sons of God sorry came before the throne of God Satan was there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and God said to Satan what what are you doing here? And he said well I'm just going around you know seeing what's going on. And he said, "Well, well, did did you ever check out, you know, this person?" And and Satan said, "Oh, yeah, but you got you got this around." And and God, this what this this is my final point of fear. God said, "You can go this far." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can go that far. You can push Brother Dale that far and that's it. &gt;&gt; You can push Sister Patty that far and that's it. Can't go no further. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Who was the boss? [laughter] [screaming] &gt;&gt; Who are you serving? You can go this far and that's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want I want to just tell you something. The person Lucifer that was asking for permission is a million miles under my feet. &gt;&gt; I walk on them on a regular basis. I I tape his faith, you know. Do you see his picture? Well, just imagine it's right there. &gt;&gt; He's completely under my feet. &gt;&gt; He cuz he is so far below &gt;&gt; the God that I serve. &gt;&gt; That the only way that I can comprehend fear &gt;&gt; is in respect. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The only way that fear was taught is not a bad word was respect to Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was reverence. Holy. You alone, Lord God, &gt;&gt; are amazing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You alone &gt;&gt; are amazing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We We're going to close. Honey, you can come and we'll sing some songs.
