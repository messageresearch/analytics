And we're just repeating what's printed on a paper like anybody could. But as the bride of Christ this morning, help it to be our heart and our soul that said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; you're welcome. You're not just welcome in this outer part, but you're welcome in our body, and our tabernacle &gt;&gt; in every part of us, Lord God. Every room of every door is open, Lord God. &gt;&gt; We praise your name today, Lord God. We just we just bask in the presence of this weekend. Lord God, we're almost we're almost done that we're in the last service is like a blur of time. &gt;&gt; But we sure thank you for the opportunity for the word that's went forth. Lord God, &gt;&gt; we love you abundantly. Lord God, be with your servant this morning. have your way &gt;&gt; as you strengthen him and lead him and anoint him and and guide him Lord God as we hear from your throne today and Lord not just your servant but be with the hearer &gt;&gt; that you would anoint us &gt;&gt; and lead us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Guide us &gt;&gt; and may we not just hear but may we be doers of the word &gt;&gt; in your name we pray Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats for just a moment, man. Just a great privilege to be here. Wow. What happened last service? That's just that's just unbelievable. Amen. Just thank you all for coming. And those that you drove or or bought rooms or or motel or that you you have no idea. You you might not know till you get to heaven what it meant to God that you came and sacrificed and and you did something out of your comfort zone. This is out of our comfort zone. I mean for some of us &gt;&gt; I'm very comfortable. This is my life. I was born on this kind of property. &gt;&gt; But you know God sometimes needs us to get us in our comfort zone. I just want to before a pastor comes you know I want to mention like the word has been amazing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know, we heard a lot this weekend about fear &gt;&gt; and we heard about purpose last night. &gt;&gt; And you know, brother Osman brought it so beautifully. You know, the three Hebrew children, they they uh before they went in the furnace, they said, "Even if we die." &gt;&gt; So, they weren't convinced they wouldn't. &gt;&gt; And asked her, she said, "Well, even if the king kills me." &gt;&gt; So, she wasn't convinced. &gt;&gt; But I want to get to be a people that I'm convinced. And if you want to ask me to come and pray for you, you need to be a person that's convinced. &gt;&gt; When David went to Goliath, he never said, "Even if Goliath kills me." &gt;&gt; David said, "I will take that giant now." &gt;&gt; It's not maybe I will. I'm not sure if God's backing me. &gt;&gt; I don't know. We need to get beyond the I don't knows. &gt;&gt; We need to get to the purpose. that when you have a giant in your life, you say, "Just give me my slingshot." &gt;&gt; And I just need five stones of grace, &gt;&gt; it won't take all five. &gt;&gt; And do you want me to tell you what David did? &gt;&gt; He not only took down his Goliath, &gt;&gt; he didn't just kill him. &gt;&gt; He stood on him. &gt;&gt; You know, when David cut off Goliath's head, he stood on his enemy. &gt;&gt; He put Satan under his feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; David was a boy, &gt;&gt; a little boy. &gt;&gt; He would have stood on the chest of that giant to cut his head off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's amazing. Amen. &gt;&gt; An amazing God we serving today. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God gave us a little test this morning. &gt;&gt; God gave us just a little test. He's seeing Were you here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you hear the word? &gt;&gt; You know when a teacher teaches a lesson that he gives us a little test. &gt;&gt; So a sister got hurt on the trampoline &gt;&gt; hurt badly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And God wanted to see if we had a purpose. And then when we prayed that we could have prayed and said, "Well, even if God don't hear our prayer, &gt;&gt; you know, the doctors, and we believe in doctors, &gt;&gt; and doctors can stop and and take away things." But you know something our prophet told us, &gt;&gt; sometimes we call an ambulance as if the ambulance is going to heal us. &gt;&gt; Those doctors can stop all injury, but they can't heal nothing. They can stop any further injury and any further pain. &gt;&gt; But there's one person that healing comes from. &gt;&gt; One person. You understand? One person &gt;&gt; right in that ambulance and ain't going to do no healing. &gt;&gt; It's going to be give me my giant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all right. You know, I remember when my and pastor, you'd come. I remember when our grandchild was born, it was very early, the last one. And and they were, you know, the doctors come in and and they were telling the the the the parents, you know, they said, you know, the baby, it was very early. And the baby, he says, the baby could be blind. The baby could be death. The baby might not have a heartbeat. The baby might not have lungs. It might have to be on oxygen. The baby might the baby might have Down syndrome. The baby might not, you know, be mentally sound. &gt;&gt; And the mother started to like lose her mind. &gt;&gt; Were you there? Is this true? And I said to the mother and my son, I said, "This is nothing but fear. &gt;&gt; There's nothing but fear." &gt;&gt; I said, "Everything will be okay." We pray, we laughed and we said, "Listen, Riley and Brent said, "Everything will be fine." &gt;&gt; And everything's just fine. &gt;&gt; Every test they put on that, he's just fine. &gt;&gt; You got to be careful with that fear. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, I I mentioned one thing and Pastor Osman, please come. You know, when Jesus went and prayed for the little sick girl in the room, he said, "Everybody get out of here. &gt;&gt; Get out of here. &gt;&gt; We don't need no more fear and doubt and wondering and gawker, slow down, and &gt;&gt; get out of here. We just need the ones that have a purpose. &gt;&gt; Purpose, &gt;&gt; giant. &gt;&gt; There's no competition here." &gt;&gt; It's not maybe I'm going to take down Goliath. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm already taken. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, Pastor Osman. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a privilege to have the family of God. Man, I can't imagine. I like to try, but I can't imagine what heaven's going to be like when I'm with brother John Garrett, Le Ministries, his brothers, all of you. Just think for eternity. Just think about that. Won't be like a 4 day weekend. &gt;&gt; No, no. We'll have a 400 weekend and that'll just be the preview. Amen. &gt;&gt; 4 million over the weekend. I mean, it's just beyond comprehazing. You have a thought and you'll be with your best buddy. The presence of God. Amen. God bless you. I I I would sing it if I could, but I can't. &gt;&gt; Let me just uh But uh Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I keep falling in love. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] should be refilled with your love of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; You know when you know when we say we keep falling in love with him, it's about each other actually. &gt;&gt; You know that, right? You know, I've known people, they love God so much and they pray and I'm I'm preaching up here. I had to rebuke some people not long ago and I'm up there preaching and all they do is pull a message book and reading while I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; And I rather rebuke that spirit because that could never be the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; You know, you know, you got people praying as loud as they can and they don't love their brothers and sisters. So, you know, when we say we keep falling in love with him over and over, I'm in love with you, you're in love with me, &gt;&gt; the closest we will ever get to Christ is when we walk wash one another's feet. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And I've been just meditating there. And you know, when Jesus said, "Whatever you do in his name, uh, whatever you do, do it in his name." And we everywhere you go, people say, "Oh, praise the Lord. In the name of Jesus, this in the name of Jes. That's more than that, you know." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anything anybody can say Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anything can say in the name of Jesus. It mean more than that. &gt;&gt; When you do things in the name of Jesus is when you take his place, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When you stand in his place and do it. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is how Galatians 3:27 says, "For as many as being baptized into Christ, you put on Putting on Christ is more than the water of baptism." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Putting on Christ is when you take his place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's when you take his place. When you put him on, you take on his role. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. You want one more singing from Barber? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We're having a great time this weekend. I I tell you what, s I'm I'm I'm I'm happy. It's just a different atmosphere. From I started I would you know, brother Dale called me twice. He said, "Go, come on, preacher." But I was trying to hide. Don't let him keep talking. We're enjoying him, right? So if I if I was here, it would have given me the time right here. Long time no you know sometime we're like that but you be seated and Barbara's coming to bless us. So &gt;&gt; thank you sister Vicki for doing that and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; You know back home I I seldom sings. &gt;&gt; Yes. Sometime for months. &gt;&gt; They ask me all the time, do you sing in church every time? I said &gt;&gt; I I I I whenever I sing at church, it's like I'm inspired &gt;&gt; to do a song. I just don't sing because okay, I can sing or I want to sing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And um you know they said time flies when you're having fun. &gt;&gt; I can't believe I was here Friday and service ends. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Already you wonder more days. &gt;&gt; No, no. I I don't think so. I'm going to be sister. You know, as as women, we get, you know, we like it, but you know, it's a little tiresome, but you know, we we enjoyed it. I know it's a lot of preparation cuz we've been there. And let me tell you, it's not easy, &gt;&gt; you know. I don't know if you have it here, but we have the same sector of people working every year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so sometimes, you know, because we're doing it for the Lord, &gt;&gt; you know, we just go ahead and do it. We just don't complain. &gt;&gt; And uh it's it's really wonderful to meet you people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, um family &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; from different somebody would say we are a brother from another mother, but we are the same. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we have the same father. &gt;&gt; So, um you know, we we we pass the color of the skin &gt;&gt; or the texture of the year. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're one. &gt;&gt; We don't we don't mind where we're from. Jamaica, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Canada, America, but we are one because we you know what? Because we were in his mind. And I trust this morning that this song that I'm going to bless into your hearts, it's it's a well-known song. You know, God's goodness and mercy is always with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, surely goodness and mercy shall always follow us &gt;&gt; all the days of our life. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me. In all my days, I've been held in your hands. &gt;&gt; From the moment that I wake up &gt;&gt; until I lay my head.

With every breath that I am able, oh I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In darkest times, you are close like no other. I've known you as a father. [Music] I've known you as a friend. Oh, I have lived in the goodness of God. For all my life, you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. And every breath that I am able, oh I will sing &gt;&gt; of the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord, I do. &gt;&gt; For your mercies never fail me. on my days. I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] For all my life you have been faithful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And all my life you have been so so good. In every breath, Lord, I am a Lord, I will single &gt;&gt; of the goodness of God. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. &gt;&gt; Your goodness is running after. It's running out to me. When my life laid down, I surrender now. I gave you everything. Your goodness is running after running after me. &gt;&gt; All my life you have been. You have been Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In all my life, you have been so so good. In every breath that I am able. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; He never fails us. &gt;&gt; Never fail. &gt;&gt; He's not a man that he should lie. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop God's &gt;&gt; word from coming to pass in our lives. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, as I'm standing here before you, I want to say I appreciate the words and you know, when I listen to the words from brother Junior from Friday night and &gt;&gt; brother John Garrett, you know, yesterday and &gt;&gt; these words just playing over in my spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's like the words are unfolding before me every day seeing what happened and &gt;&gt; you know we're being given a test. &gt;&gt; You know, let me see whether you guys believe what you preach. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, I I appreciate it. Really appreciate it. Everybody, you know, singing and &gt;&gt; we're in the last days. &gt;&gt; You read the book of Luke chapter 21. Jesus outlined all the things that we ought to look for. The book of Matthew chapter 24, Jesus outlined it again. There was never a season in humanity on earth here because everything is governed by season. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; That you we see so many preachers rising. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody become prophets, prophetists, preachers, everybody have a word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it's a season &gt;&gt; and Jesus said they're going this season is going to come on. Why? Because men's heart failing for fear. People want something. &gt;&gt; I have never seen so many apostles and prophets rise up around the world now. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know and I tell you what they've got they have got great crowds too. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Great mega thing is just popping up all over the place. You know, I'm not criticizing nobody, nobody thing, but I'm just saying &gt;&gt; people are hungry. &gt;&gt; People are hungry for something. &gt;&gt; And you got to give them something, you know. &gt;&gt; But then again, the same word says there will be famine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Amos 8 from verse 11, &gt;&gt; he never said faming for the word. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Fing for earing. &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Faming for hearing. &gt;&gt; When you read uh 2 Samuel &gt;&gt; and you read there, God says that famine means I won't be speaking. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You remember with Saul? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Saul inquired of the Lord and the Lord did not answer. &gt;&gt; Right. So we got to fabricate things to give the people because they're hungry. &gt;&gt; So we have to put things together because you know you come you need something. &gt;&gt; And so that's the platform that is forming now &gt;&gt; people not hearing from God. &gt;&gt; No no &gt;&gt; notice what Saul after Saul stopped hearing from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Even when the music from the anointed David was being played, it wasn't helping him. No, &gt;&gt; that's when he start to throw javelin &gt;&gt; to kill David. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of us preachers because we're not hearing from God, all we can throw are javelins. &gt;&gt; Not no inspiration. So, we are throwing javelin. Javelings, which is fear. &gt;&gt; We're trying to kill. And you watch everybody. If one rise, one little prophet rise up on social media, another one rise, what is he doing? He's trying to throw dabbling across this guy, &gt;&gt; because he's this guy's trying to rob his bread, &gt;&gt; trying to cut his bread. &gt;&gt; And so another one rise is throwing javelin. &gt;&gt; If God was speaking to you, you don't need to throw javelin. &gt;&gt; You listen to anointed voice of God. &gt;&gt; Such as I have I give. I come to give life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this morning, let's have a wonderful lesson. by the grace of God here. Amen. Thank you for the song. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the songs that came before and my heart is just being blessed and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and it's the Holy Spirit is just leading me in the direction because I've got other preachers at church instead of being pulling in the direction of teaching more at church. &gt;&gt; You know, because everything is a part of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know that's what I've been doing and &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; during the week I have Bible studies and I have people from Pakistan &gt;&gt; joining Bible studies &gt;&gt; you know wanting to serve the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; people from the Muslim &gt;&gt; believing want to listen to Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and you know that's my heart not I don't need to be recognized &gt;&gt; just that I want people to know Jesus Christ is real &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus Christ is real and standing here and &gt;&gt; I don't want to be looked as a preacher. &gt;&gt; I want to be recognized as your brother, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That loves you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I seek God for a word to encourage all of us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be seen as that. No. Thank you, brother John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God have no big you or small me in this day. &gt;&gt; I love you, brother John with my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God have no big you and small you. So there is a so there is a direction that we're going to go. I trust you got a good sleep last night that you won't sleep in this church tonight. &gt;&gt; You know you're well rested and all that.

But we're depending on the Holy Spirit, Father, to just come and bring a word from these these words, God, to our hearts, Father. And it is more than just enjoying a preaching, more than just enjoying a word, God. But Lord, as we drink and drink, there is something coming out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet remind us Lord in his in his teaching, he says that everything that we have got need of in this life is already in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said even the rapture and all we has to do is to just drink and drink and drink and &gt;&gt; it will come out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God, Father. Lord, this weekend of service, Lord, is just is just awesome, God. And Lord, uh the fact that we're not in a big uh well conditioned and polished auditorium and thousands of people and all this great entertainment and all of that, but Lord, we're on the &gt;&gt; the straw trail. &gt;&gt; Oh God, it's just beautiful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful atmosphere. just remind me of &gt;&gt; often times you would just go in the wilderness upon the mountain and your disciples just come up to you and you would just have a great time with them and teaching and oh beautiful atmosphere God &gt;&gt; Lord we thank you just bless us continually today and &gt;&gt; oh remember brother Jose father whose mom just &gt;&gt; made a transition and he has to travel over now I know his spirit is here &gt;&gt; and his heart is here God but he has to go with virgin be with the family over there in El Salvador God as they you know as to uh enter this season of their lives.

Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. It's beautiful, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless God. You're awesome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a awesome God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're amazing, God. Amen. Thank you again in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The guys that brother Junior work with, they're they're from Jamaica, different parts, and they're here on the farm work. &gt;&gt; And he brought them to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. and they're oh they they they enjoy the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Jamaica they they they don't go to church. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But it takes the work to bring them to church. &gt;&gt; Isn't God awesome? &gt;&gt; Isn't God He knows how to bring people in, you know. &gt;&gt; God is awesome. &gt;&gt; They come to work and end up in church. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless God. You know, &gt;&gt; amen. Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 11. We're having a good time, you know. Give me some time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said Christ God Christ himself and it says and he gave and I want us to look at that word gave. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers &gt;&gt; for the perfecting of the saints. That's the purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, now remember these are gifts because if you notice in verse 8 he said and he when he ascended on high he led captive with the captive and he gave gifts unto men. &gt;&gt; So these apostle is a gift. A prophet prophets are gifts. I'm not talking a major prophet of of an age. No. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; You know a major prophet is is is not quote unquote a gift but is a messenger to the age. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. But you got prophets a gift and evangelist is a gift. Uh pastor is a gift and teachers are gift and so he said the purpose of that is for the perfecting of the saints. That mean the saints will be getting to perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or for the work of the ministry. All right. &gt;&gt; Good for the edifying of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, till we all come into the unity of what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not faith but the faith. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So you got faith and you got the faith. &gt;&gt; So it's you have your faith which is without that you cannot please God but you got to come to the faith of the gospel. &gt;&gt; You got to come to the faith. Now this faith was established upon the apostles doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Upon the go apostle doctrine. Right. Because there's one place in the Bible that the word doctrine mentioned in this acts 2:42. &gt;&gt; They all continued that steadfast in the apostles doctrine. &gt;&gt; Right? That's where Christ established his church. All right. &gt;&gt; Good. And so look at this part of it. And of the knowledge of the son of God. So the saints which is the church coming to the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man onto the measure of the statue not just of Christ &gt;&gt; but of the of the fullness &gt;&gt; of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So the the thought that we can study on this morning is the full measurement. If you want us to put a title to that, a little focus on this, the full measurement. &gt;&gt; You know, a a lot of times we we, you know, growing up and different heroes in the ministry, the focus was so much on the five-fold. And nowadays, there's been such a war over the five-fold. and the five-fold is not needed anymore and all that type of thing and and and the emphasis placed on the five-fold ministry and you know it's just it's just sad out of ignorance. I said that you know uh we lose focus of what that is and you know uh the Bible said he gave gifts and sometimes we take it and it wasn't given to us &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you know a lot of us take and wasn't given because my father was a pastor and so I'll be inheriting the chair &gt;&gt; and it's more than that &gt;&gt; you know my grandpa was a pastor of this and so I'm in line to inherit this &gt;&gt; the gifts are not inheritance &gt;&gt; they are given And so sometimes the pastor may not be the brightest guy among the preachers, &gt;&gt; but he has the gift of a pastor, &gt;&gt; you know, and so everything is just upside down sometimes in some areas, brother John. &gt;&gt; That you know, you're surprised. And so the the saints will never come to perfection if the gifts are not placed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can have a whole bunch of church and all we have is just a ritual over and over again, &gt;&gt; right? because it's not being done properly, &gt;&gt; you know, because I take the gift of an apostle and I feel that you can't talk to me because I have it and it was not my gift, &gt;&gt; but because I like it, I take it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just like an evangelist, you read six message books and you travel the whole world preaching and you you don't have a gift of an evangelist and you read six more and then you want a pastor. And so I ask you, who are you? No. Why? Last year you was an evangelist. Oh, I got promotion, brother Barkley. I'm a pastor now. And so it's much more than that, Satan. &gt;&gt; You know, I I'm your brother. I I want to tell you the truth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's much more than that. &gt;&gt; But then when I say that the emphasis is placed on the on the on the fivefold when you're talking about the ministry and uh but but there this is what sometimes we miss. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in verse 11, till we all &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; come to the unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That part of it is being &gt;&gt; pushed aside, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. Because nowadays you may come to church and you know you're looking for it for Wednesday night or some of us do come and Sunday morning and you come you fold your arms and you expecting to be preached to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know when you come with your burdens and you needed to be lifted by one person. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And then uh you know you have no business who want to die die who want to sick. sake is is the pastors or the or the responsibility of the the the the evangelist. That's their job because the Bible speaks of fivefold, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we forget that we all &gt;&gt; has a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Every one of us have a responsibility to come to the full measure. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come to the full measure of the statue of Christ. &gt;&gt; Every one of us saints of God, &gt;&gt; just as our God can speak to brother day, your pastor, he can speak to you, Sister Vicki. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But he will never tell you to take his position. &gt;&gt; That's not of God. &gt;&gt; But God can speak to every one of us. And so, &gt;&gt; amen. We has to understand that when we talking about the full measurement, it is pointing to every person that are believers. &gt;&gt; Every one of us have to express the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we have different measures of course. &gt;&gt; To express the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; We were all created in the image of Almighty God. Every one of us in this building. &gt;&gt; And I and as we said last night, God uh created us in a certain measure. And then later on in the life, God said, "Well, I'm thinking of something extra for you. &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to add it to what I put already." No. &gt;&gt; Everything that God have for your life is already in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it takes seasons and season to bring that out. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. One time I was just a boy. Amen. But I I was always a husband. &gt;&gt; I was always a father. I was always a grandfather. &gt;&gt; And all of that was in the loins of my father. All about me was on the loins of my father. But then there was a time when I was a little boy running all over the place. And as a Caesar changes, I become a teenager. And as a Caesar changes, I became a father. And as another Caesar come, I know a grandpa. And who knows if God permits another part of my attribute coming out which is called a great great grandfather. &gt;&gt; It was always there in the plan of God. &gt;&gt; But as she the Bible says Ecclesiastic 3:1 everything is governed on by season and a time and season for everything under the sun. &gt;&gt; So you are always who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on saint. Hallelujah sir. &gt;&gt; A perfect man there the Bible speaks of is uh Amen. Glory to God is a complete man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God speaks of the word perfect, he's referring to a complete man. &gt;&gt; The book of Ephesians chapter 1, Amen. in verse 22, Amen. speaks of who Christ is. And uh Christ being resurrected from the dead, the Bible says he's far above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is name, not only in this world, but also in the in that which is to come. And he put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things, the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. which is his body. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And the fullness of him that fill all and in all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the church is the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That y &gt;&gt; Christ is the head of the church. &gt;&gt; And it it is useless if we're here worshiping and Christ is not the head. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you disconnect my head from my body, I am dead. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am a lifeless corpse. &gt;&gt; So Christ, the Bible said God, Amen. when he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, he placed him to be the head over all things, even the church. Amen. And the church is now expressing the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot express nothing less. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the fullness of Christ. Because remember, Amen. for your hand to to operate it get the intelligence from the head. &gt;&gt; If your finger is to operate, the intelligence come from the head. And so if you disconnect this intelligence, you have no life in you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when you understand that the church, the body is complete when she enters union with Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, beautiful &gt;&gt; Christ. Amen. And she is now a complete Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we talk about Christ, do realize that the church is the Christ that is representing the kingdom of God. You're in hurt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I love the word of the Bible says we have fellowship one with another. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have fellowship with you which is actually the God in you. &gt;&gt; The Christ in you is able to connect with me &gt;&gt; when the Christ in me as Paul says the works that I'm doing is not myself. &gt;&gt; It's the Christ working through me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why a true believer that is filled with the spirit of God, we don't see colors or nationalities. We see Christ &gt;&gt; and that Christ cannot be counterized. &gt;&gt; You cannot put him in a region or a custom. He is universal because he's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now is the words to his wife constantly ringing in her ears. The prophet says when Christ said because I live in the book of John chapter 14 from verse 19. The prophet said when Christ says because I live you shall live also. He said he was speaking and he is still speaking to his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He took the ultimate manifestation of God in Christ &gt;&gt; to bring those disciples to the knowledge of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this knowledge does not come by just reading and reading. It comes by revelation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. hit them and that brought that knowledge of the son of God that the ministry is bringing us to is what produced the joy that those apostles found. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said to them in John chapter 16 22, when you get that joy, he said, you are sorrowing now, but when you get that joy, no man can take it from you. &gt;&gt; They didn't understand it. Amen. When you put that to John chapter 14 from verse 9 from verse 19 Jesus said a little while and the world won't see me but you are going to see me. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was she talking about? They walked with Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They h with him. They fished with him and they fellowship with him and all those miracles were good. But when they saw, Amen. their witness, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They witness him hang on the cross. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They knew that his body was wrapped &gt;&gt; and placed in a super, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But then here is he standing before me. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He's standing before them in that room. Amen. And he said to them, "I'm not a spirit. Feel my hand and my side. It is still me. He went further. He said, "Give me something to eat. Let me show you and my spirit." Oh, when the joy filled their hearts, &gt;&gt; you know what they overcame? They overcame the fear of death. &gt;&gt; My Lord God, now he's alive. Oh, death, where is your st? &gt;&gt; No grave can hold this body. My Lord went and he became the first fruit of them that slept. &gt;&gt; Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That joy. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; You ever thought of that before? Amen. The knowledge of the son of God is lacking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Knowledge is lacking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm not talking the intellectual hash of knowledge. I'm talking the knowledge revelation of the son of God. &gt;&gt; When knowledge is absent, fear is present &gt;&gt; and doubt will be lurking around your home. Doubt will be lurking around the church. And for therefore you find there is no joy in fellowship. Brothers and sisters, coming to fellowship now become like if I can and when I want to &gt;&gt; because there is no joy of us coming together because iron shorten iron and if I mean I amen it's supposed to be time where I look at you as the body of God the body of Christ. I'm discerning the body of Christ. This is more than a a piece of bread and drinking wine. &gt;&gt; Call that communion is good. &gt;&gt; But this is more than that. Brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; no wonder communion today with the literal bread and the wine become a ritual, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Because people still not discerning &gt;&gt; the Lord's body. &gt;&gt; It's not that bread. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's you and I. when you there ought have to be a time you can only wait for Sunday morning because I want to shake your hand. I want to greet my sister. Why? Because I acknowledge that we are all here temporarily. We all here we need to enjoy the company of each other. But all that is lost. I come when I want to and I come when I can and if I feel like. Oh God, help the church today who is called the body of Christ. We have to express the full measure or we're expressing none at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Look at this. God creates attributes in us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it was the prophet who came and taught us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What it meant when he said all that God was, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was, he poured into us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The song we sung to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful song, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But that's the message, &gt;&gt; right? Yep. Yep. Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; The time of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We said a lot of things last night, but it's okay if we say it again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to hear it. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; In the time of Abram as he interceded for the life &gt;&gt; for Oh, glory to God. For you. Okay, let me back up a little bit. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Colossians chapter 1 and verse 15, and let's look at it if you want to. Glory to God a little bit here. bad. &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1 verse 15- 16 speaking of Jesus Christ who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature. For for by him are all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, &gt;&gt; whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. Can we say that together? All things were created what? By him and for him. That's interesting. [Music] So it's not for us, it's for him. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I don't own the church is for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if all things Amen. If you heard the words of worship in Revelation 4:1 from the four 20 the 24 held on the four beasts they confirm it this verse. Amen. For all things were created for his pleasure. &gt;&gt; Which means his will, his favor, his satisfaction. &gt;&gt; So whatever comes out, God let it comes out to satisfy himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You heard what I just said. Amen. &gt;&gt; So all things were he created. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So no matter how we we enjoy it or we express it, he brought it out of us for his satisfaction. &gt;&gt; No matter how it looks. And so the book of Genesis chapter 126, God shall let us create man in our own image. What? After our likeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. the image after the likeness in Genesis verse the next verse. &gt;&gt; God created man in his own image. You don't see likeness there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You don't see likeness there. He said this is how I'm going to do it. I'm going to create man out of my own image, after my likeness. And then he actually create man. Man was a spirit man. &gt;&gt; Right. Sure was &gt;&gt; all every every attribute of God was already created in man. &gt;&gt; But the likeness comes from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; The light, you know, because God Amen. All things were created for him and by him. So God will set conditions and situations &gt;&gt; to bring out his likeness through your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which means to act like him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To bring out an attribute. &gt;&gt; So we cannot just get up and manifest the attribute of our home. God create the situation. &gt;&gt; God create the condition. I'm getting there. You may not. Some of you trying to Oh, where's he going? I get understand. I can see the expression of the fishes. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; God. Okay. Okay. Let me just bring it down. Brothers and sisters, God is not going to hold you by the collar. &gt;&gt; Squeeze your collar like robots. &gt;&gt; I said, "Act like me. &gt;&gt; Act like me." No. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God create the situation. &gt;&gt; Bring you to the situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There you go. &gt;&gt; Because there's an attribute of God in you that he's pulling out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God says, Amen. God could have gone to Sodom and Gomorra and destroyed himself &gt;&gt; without saying a thing to Abraham. &gt;&gt; God don't need to consult us. Right. &gt;&gt; But God said, "I'm going to tell Abraham." &gt;&gt; What was God doing? Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God was pulling out &gt;&gt; of Abraham an attribute called intercessor. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You heard the fullness now. &gt;&gt; You see the the complete measure &gt;&gt; is image and likeness. &gt;&gt; You see the full measure now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Image and likeness. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's the full measure. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We're getting some here this morning. &gt;&gt; So, sitting down in church, you're enjoying some service. Hey, saints, there are some things that God will put before you. &gt;&gt; It's not to destroy you, but to pull out a likeness, &gt;&gt; to pull out an attribute &gt;&gt; that sometime it laid dorm on for 40 years. &gt;&gt; God said, I'm going to pull that out of you. Oh, I'm going to pull that out of you &gt;&gt; because I'm looking for full measure. &gt;&gt; I don't want half. I want full measure. &gt;&gt; Oh, God will let your God will let your pastor hate you. God will let your pastor speak evil against you. And God knows that that cannot defeat purpose. He's just bringing something out of you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to love him anyhow. I'm going to respect his office. You didn't know where it's coming from. God was bringing out his likeness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Woo. God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There are many more we can talk about in the house of Isaac. You remember that? Amen. Before the foundation of the world, God says, and brother Paul pick it up in Romans chapter 9:1. He said, "Before there were he bonded, before there were evil conceived, he dam Jacob have thy love and Esau have hated." Is that what the Bible says? I tell you where it is. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But then you saw the actual happening of it. Brother said, "I if he was choosing a man, he would have choose Esau &gt;&gt; because he was more manly." &gt;&gt; But it's not what you choose, it's what God says. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Y &gt;&gt; think about it. &gt;&gt; He created for himself, not yours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; We're having a good time this morning, isn't it? &gt;&gt; And you think about it. Glory to God. Amen. Isaac favorite. You know, the Bible really clearly say Isaac favorite was Esau. &gt;&gt; And Rebecca's favorite was Jacob. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saints of God. And you know what? Rebecca used deception. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; To bring Jacob forward for a lifelong blessing &gt;&gt; and the fulfillment of covenant. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what it just says? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What did she use? &gt;&gt; Deception. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. See, see &gt;&gt; to the unlearned and ignorant like some of us, &gt;&gt; we said it's deception. &gt;&gt; But in God's plan is fulfillment of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; In God's plan is bringing forth his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She deceived Isaac. &gt;&gt; Everything. She at one point Jacob was so scared.

The hatred and the jealousy towards Joseph was God molding and forging and training Joseph &gt;&gt; to bring out attribute &gt;&gt; for preservation. &gt;&gt; Amen. They hated him &gt;&gt; in so much so that Joseph brothers and isolated him and threw him in a pit and &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; you know, and they sold him out and Joseph, you know, it was the Bible says after Joseph saw them and all of that, he spoke to them in a different language and cuz he knew the language. &gt;&gt; You see, he never allowed the pit the prison &gt;&gt; and the different region to change his original language. &gt;&gt; That's a message in itself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But he maintain the lang. He could speak the language. &gt;&gt; But then he came over Egypt and learned another language and then he it obviously he spoke to them through interpreter. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He dressed different. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They couldn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Everything changed.

Kids lost the watch. Somebody stole the watch. And so he ran to the teacher and said somebody stole my watch. The teacher asked all the kids and said hey we got to find this watch. You know and nobody would surrender the watch. And so the teacher said, "We got to all line you up across the chalkboard." He said, "We want everybody close your eyes." He said, "I, the teacher, I'm going to check all your pockets and I'm going to find a watch." And so the teacher did. We'll just say the teacher found the watch in my pocket. &gt;&gt; The teacher found the watch in the pocket. And the boy that had the watch was just completely humiliated &gt;&gt; because he knew that the teacher knew that he was a liar. &gt;&gt; And so 25 years later, he's a grown man. He's got a family. Teacher calls him up. He sees the teacher at a reunion. The moment he seen the teacher's eyes, he relived the watch. He said, "That teacher knows that I'm a liar." And so he was all embarrassed and just could hardly control himself. And he went to the teacher and he confessed to the teacher. He said, "All I could think about is you finding the watch when you lined us up in the chalkboard." He said, "I knew you know who had the watch." And the teacher told him years later said, "I closed my eyes, too, because I never even trusted myself." &gt;&gt; She said, "I didn't know you had stoli. &gt;&gt; I just went by every kid with my eyes closed and I checked every pocket because I didn't even trust me to know to know who had the watch." And 25 years later, here's the brother thinking that teacher will still hate me and think I'm a robber. &gt;&gt; The teacher said, &gt;&gt; "I don't know. Cuz my eyes were closed." &gt;&gt; I didn't know cuz my eyes were closed. &gt;&gt; That's kind of got me. God's eyes were closed, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's eyes. You think of that. Amen. That's amazing. Amen. Let's sing Amazing Grace as we close. Amen.
