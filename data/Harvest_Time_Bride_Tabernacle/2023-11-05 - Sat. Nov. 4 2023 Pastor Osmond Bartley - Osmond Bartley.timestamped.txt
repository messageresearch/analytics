[43:40] Christ's name we pray can you say amen
[43:44] amen amen I just want to read from Dr
[43:47] Luke's
[43:49] writing uh chapter
[43:51] 18 amen and verse just one verse there
[43:55] and we're just going to take a thought
[43:56] tonight and I was just there in the
[43:59] pastor's office and glan over and I
[44:01] stole forgive me for you I stole it one
[44:05] of his notes it's so in line with what
[44:08] the Lord want to speaking so you know we
[44:11] we know we as preachers we like to steal
[44:14] each other's notes you know sometime
[44:16] you're preaching and
[44:18] them it'll get a few things so you know
[44:22] it's like that you know so forgive me I
[44:25] I'll return it
[44:26] yes I will return it after I'm finished
[44:30] but he he he place it there that I get
[44:32] it so I just got to read it it's in line
[44:35] with what the Lord want and
[44:38] amen and and here Jesus after he was
[44:41] actually talk can you hear me clearly
[44:43] right I tell you the engineers are great
[44:46] at the back they did wonderful work amen
[44:49] and so Jesus was talking about the the
[44:52] the the Widow the widow woman and and
[44:55] the the judge and all of that but I just
[44:57] pick from this from Luke
[45:02] 18:8 the second part of it is actually
[45:05] what stand out to me and to us tonight
[45:08] and Jesus said I tell you that he which
[45:11] Speaking of the father look at verse
[45:12] seven actually and shall not God avenge
[45:16] his own elect which cryed day and night
[45:19] unto him though he bear long with
[45:23] them I tell you that he will avenge them
[45:26] speedily yes sir but this is the thought
[45:29] jumped out of us nevertheless when the
[45:32] son of man cometh shall he find faith on
[45:37] Earth it's
[45:40] powerful when the sh of man cometh shall
[45:44] he find faith on Earth it's a question
[45:48] the Lord bless you be
[45:52] seated glory to God so so you know uh um
[45:58] uh as I was there uh talking about faith
[46:02] if we could pull a thought tonight and I
[46:05] and I'm going to say a few things
[46:07] because we started last night on change
[46:10] of the Dynamics that was great from God
[46:12] I believe it change of the
[46:16] Dynamics
[46:18] now we want to talk about a leap of
[46:22] faith a leap of faith Saints and it is
[46:26] good and humanly to believe what
[46:29] happened
[46:31] yesterday and it is so common for us to
[46:34] looking forward for what's going to
[46:36] happen that's right but it's so hard for
[46:39] us to have faith for what's happening
[46:42] now believe it it's so hard to take the
[46:45] God out of history and make him be
[46:49] present we talk about it we sing about
[46:52] it oh we we we recite the quotes and we
[46:55] we we dance around it but when it comes
[46:58] to making the word become effective it's
[47:03] missing it's missing and we you know we
[47:07] are people that believe the word we are
[47:10] people that have gotten the absolute
[47:13] word we are a people that know how to
[47:16] study the
[47:18] word I can Bo about that glory to God
[47:23] but we need more than just that
[47:26] we want to see the word in its full
[47:31] effect is that right sense of God I'm
[47:34] not just satisfied to hear about my
[47:37] Prophet did this to hear what my Prophet
[47:40] said I'm not just satisfied to hear amen
[47:44] of the god of Abraham what he did and
[47:47] Jacob and we talk about him we're going
[47:49] to talk about him again but I want to
[47:51] see my God working among amen the people
[47:54] here
[47:58] Oh Glory to God I want to see some sick
[48:01] Hill I want to see people
[48:04] delivered I want to hear some
[48:06] testimonies of what God is doing in your
[48:10] lives hey glory to God
[48:12] Amen praise be to God Amen and so you
[48:17] know this is the one I I I me jumped out
[48:20] of me you know the prophet says in the
[48:22] message now amen
[48:24] jarus and the Divine Healing I believe
[48:27] that's where they come from and he said
[48:29] the devil is trying to scare you out of
[48:32] something he's trying to put something
[48:35] off somewhere else saying some of these
[48:39] days you will be
[48:42] this but you are
[48:46] now you are now we are sons of God we
[48:53] are now seated in heaven Heavenly
[48:56] places now listen to script we have all
[49:01] powers in heaven and earth
[49:06] now glory to God
[49:09] hallelujah we have it now not in the
[49:13] Millennium we won't need it
[49:16] then we got it
[49:19] now now if you have something now I want
[49:22] to see
[49:24] here
[49:28] hallu so last time we talk about change
[49:30] of the Dynamics and you know the
[49:33] prophets talk about the the the
[49:35] the this text that I wrote talk about
[49:41] faith Jesus said when I come shall I
[49:45] have shall I find Faith he said in the
[49:48] message angel of God
[49:50] 1951 he said when I return will I find
[49:54] Faith Jesus Jesus did not question glory
[49:58] to God he said did not question about
[50:00] sincerity or
[50:02] Christianity he said shall I find
[50:06] faith
[50:08] faith 1962 to take Hallelujah on the
[50:13] whole armor listen this talking about
[50:15] Matthew 16 commission he said that was
[50:18] the last commission Jesus gave Go in all
[50:23] the world and preach the gospel
[50:24] whosoever believe it and his baptized
[50:25] shall be saved he said that was the last
[50:28] commission Jesus gave he said these
[50:32] signs shall follow them that
[50:39] believe Oh Glory to God oh my do you
[50:43] [Music]
[50:44] believe do you believe this is for you
[50:49] in my name they shall consult Devils
[50:53] they shall speak with new tongues
[50:56] if they take up serpents or drink deadly
[50:58] things it won't hurt them if they lay
[51:02] hands on the sick oh God hallelujah if
[51:06] they lay hands on the sick they shall
[51:09] recover he ask when I shall I find Faith
[51:14] he never said I find righteousness will
[51:18] I find a church will I find a people he
[51:22] said I want to find faith
[51:28] glory to God I want to find Faith now
[51:33] there is nowhere in the word amen or
[51:37] amen that tells me that this power has
[51:41] left the
[51:42] church there was no in the word that
[51:46] tell me healing of the sick is of the
[51:49] minor Don't Tell Me Oh Glory to God that
[51:53] God coming this last day and remove the
[51:56] gifts out of the
[51:57] church Hallelujah a True Church of God
[52:02] possesses the gifts of
[52:05] God and that's the church that's going
[52:07] in the
[52:08] Rapture that's the church up back upon
[52:11] the
[52:12] original Oh Hallelujah Shake must be
[52:15] healed people must be
[52:18] delivered eyes must be
[52:21] open that's the True Church of God in
[52:24] operation but back to the book of
[52:32] Acts he the Bible said in Romans
[52:35] 1:17 for therein is a righteousness of
[52:38] God revealed from Faith to Faith from
[52:42] Faith to Faith we are
[52:46] growing the aisle we
[52:49] goes is the more the pressure
[52:52] increases because we're going up we're
[52:54] not going down
[52:57] but don't
[52:58] worry our father knows he can trust
[53:02] us he POS he put in us what we need to
[53:06] resist the
[53:08] pressure is that right he knows what
[53:11] we're going to
[53:12] encounter the higher you go in the word
[53:16] is more pressure you
[53:22] experience glory to God Hallelujah so we
[53:27] we progress from Faith to Faith to Faith
[53:32] amen remember our Father Abraham amen oh
[53:36] God sh the test to Abraham the Bible
[53:39] says in Genesis 22 he said God tempted
[53:44] Abraham so when he said Abraham leave
[53:46] your father's place that was a test
[53:50] Abram believed God is that right oh when
[53:54] it come for Abram to get a son or to get
[53:57] a child that was a test so Abram was
[54:00] growing from Faith to Faith Can I preach
[54:04] this church we're talking about a leap
[54:06] of faith tonight woo how I feel the
[54:09] anointing of God Amen but then there was
[54:14] another level of God was bringing Abram
[54:17] higher then God to Abram take your H son
[54:21] and offer him up as a sacrifice that's
[54:24] another level of Faith oh
[54:27] Hallelujah is that right the are you go
[54:31] in your in your understanding is unless
[54:34] you question the word of God
[54:38] hallu because you're
[54:40] growing you don't question God some you
[54:44] know sometimes God will tells you what
[54:47] if God tells you to write a
[54:52] book some of us we're waiting for God
[54:55] God to give us the
[55:00] paper can I
[55:02] preach God give me the paper you're
[55:06] waiting for God to you the
[55:09] pen and then you know what some of us
[55:12] take it further we have the pen and the
[55:15] paper we want God to hold our hands and
[55:19] describe their
[55:21] words where is the leap of faith faith
[55:25] is a
[55:30] revelation faith is a revelation oh
[55:34] Hallelujah when God said to my father
[55:36] Abraham take your only son up a place
[55:40] I'm going to show you and offer him up
[55:43] as a
[55:48] sacrifice the procedure Abraham know it
[55:52] bring him up there and kill him and burn
[55:55] him that's the procedure he never
[55:59] question it because he had already grown
[56:02] wo
[56:03] hallelujah oh glory to God he takes a
[56:06] leap of faith Amen to put the wood on
[56:09] your son's
[56:11] shoulder he takes a leap of faith amen

[56:33] but a leap of faith I'm going to stand
[56:36] there and he said amen the Lord shall
[56:41] provide
[56:43] himself amen the
[56:49] L the mechanics has changed we don't
[56:53] just want to sing about it
[56:55] we don't just want to jump over the
[56:58] quotes and dance because the prophet
[57:01] said it we want to see it in
[57:08] action it takes a leap of faith to
[57:12] activate your purpose within the
[57:18] change it's changed I'm I'm not asking
