God bless those that are online. Amen. We recognize it's winter time. Every time we go by Matt and Abigail's or we go to visit them, I am amazed at how far they drive to come and fellowship with us. I think it's a good hour and 20 minutes on a good day on a Sunday. [snorts] one way. Amen. Amen. Well, I got good news for you. If God will let me, I'm going to stop my I'm going to stop my uh series after today. Amen. Next Sunday, if God willing, I'm going to preach on Judas Escariat. Next Sunday. Amen. Let's read a scripture while you're standing. 1 Corinthians, I mentioned this last week. We're going to preach on what Paul preached. 1 Corinthians 4 and we want to read verse six. I think we'll just read verse six and seven. Amen. You know, our prophet told us this that if you thought too highly of yourself and you wanted to recognize yourself. Now, you know, this is a paradox because we came from God. So, we're a part of God. So, we are gods with a small G. So, God greatly loves you. You're a part of him. But you and your flesh, if you want to think too highly of yourself, Brother Brham said, stick your hand in a pale of water and pull it out. Find where your hand is. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll never find it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the scripture says those exact words. And these things, brethren, I have in figure transfigure to myself [snorts] and to Apollus for your sakes, that ye might learn in us not to think of a man above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up, for one against another. For who maketh thee to differ from the other another? And what hast thou that thou dost not receive? Now if this if thou dost disreceive this, why dust thou glory? As if thou hadest not received it. Let us not think of a man above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up one against another. For who maketh thee to differ from another? What hast thou that thou dost not receive? For if thou hast received it, why does thy glory as if thou hast not received it? Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll take this text, Lord God. You know what you've laid on my heart and what you've shared with me, Lord God, and what we've studied and and Lord, I pray that you convey this to your family, Lord God. And Lord, more than as much as any, we thank you for your presence, Lord God. And Lord, our only desire is to adore you, to worship you, to give you all the glory, and to serve you, Lord God, with our complete heart. And we praise you, Lord God, for yours is only one God, Jehovah Gyra. And we love you, Lord God, this morning in your name. Bless the hearer, Lord God, and help them to catch your spirit, your revelation, Lord God, we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. [clears throat] Amen. [snorts] I want to continue this same title we were preaching on. The seed of God always brings the nature of God. And and if we were going to go down a little different road this morning, you know, Brother Bram said about a hundred times in the message that your attitude controls everything. Your attitude controls everything. If if you came in anything, your attitude in your relationship, in your job, in serving God, your attitude, you know, and if and we might go into this more in the new year, but brother talked about the angel, the Holy Spirit coming by, and if your attitude was wrong, it would just it would just fly away. God God was a dumb nature. And if you're woing and barking and and howling and all this, he will not sit around your territory. And even he can explain this. You know, you know the angels that are hovered about us, you know, the footsteps of the righteous are are ordered of the Lord, but they're encamped with angels of God. And those angels have left the presence of Jehovah in heaven. And they will only be pres they will only be comfortable in that same presence. You know, you wonder why God and and Brother Ben mentioned this in in El Salvador last night. You wonder why God isn't in our church as if we don't have the same presence that's in heaven. You wonder if God's not in our home is if there ain't the same atmosphere in our home that there wasn't in heaven. And so when the angels come to a different atmosphere, they don't know how to control it because they're a dove dove and they can only feast on Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; They're a dove anointing. You know, brother Bram said this so many times, your attitude will change this, you know, and and different things. You know, Brother Bram, you know, as as he had a gift of visions and and you know, the in the healing the prayer lines, you know, there would be people that God would want to speak to. And when the power of God was there in a special supernatural way, he'd say, you've heard this thousands and thousands of times in the message, be reverent. Be reverent. Bow your head. Be reverent. Be reverent. Be respectful. But your attitude, your attitude. Be respectful. If you're if you're barking, those those demons will go on you &gt;&gt; instead of leave the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, you know, brother Ben, I we'd listened to a message there. He preached in El Salvador and he was pointing out and so I I'm just taking this part of his. He said, you know, there was in brother Bram's meetings, you would know you he would see how the angel would go over people and he could see the pillar of fire over them. And he said there was a brother and there there you've heard this and the thing he said, "Be careful, sister. Be careful, brother. You're going to miss it." And you'd miss it for all of eternity. And there was a brother that the angel had went over and he said that the the the devil Lucifer got him to go out to the bathroom and the spirit the the angel left him and went to another person. He said that man died with the disease he took to the bathroom because he didn't have the reverence and the attitude of the presence of Jehovah. God created the angels &gt;&gt; to worship him in the presence. Now watch this. And those angels leave that presence and they expect the same presence that was just here. &gt;&gt; That's the only presence they're comfortable in &gt;&gt; is worship to Jehovah &gt;&gt; and him alone. &gt;&gt; And that's the same with our homes. Amen. And you know, it's actually I really got this message I wanted to preach next Sunday. You know, it it it's just uh I actually had a couple things. It's really peculiar how God sends a message. But you know, Brother Brandham said things about Judas a Scariot. Brother Brham did. And many of us have made decisions like Judas the Scariot. God bless you, brother Fred. Very, very welcome. Amen. Amen. God help us. Amen. But that's we want to go on with this. Let's watch this here. What our prophet said just a couple in the fifth seal. He said, "Don't you never he" He said, "I don't want to never think because I'm a wash woman or a little plow boy that I can't receive a revelation from God." See, God has children. Amen. And and we never want to put oursel above what God has planned. And then we'll go to the next quote here and I want to get right into our text. He said, and this was he mentioned 97 times he said, "Your approach, your attitude is what it takes." If you're healed today or not healed today, it's all on your attitude &gt;&gt; and your approach. [snorts] And that's what it is tonight, dear friend. It takes the attitude. And we are and we believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ. But he said it's your attitude that brings the results. &gt;&gt; God never changed. The presence of Jesus Christ never changed. &gt;&gt; It is your attitude to his presence. You know the prophet said this many times. He said most of the time that people met miss the presence of God is because they didn't recognize &gt;&gt; him. That's right. &gt;&gt; You didn't recognize him. So, we had in our text and last week we'd finished out reading a bunch of quotes about uh arrogancy and being arrogant and and the opposite to arrogant and humility. And I want to show you just fastly and quickly and we're we're going to go into it, but I want to show you three examples of the difference of being delivered or not being delivered over humility or arrogancy. And the first one is in Luke 23. And uh I got different verses here, but I want to show you here that here's the time that Jesus is being crucified. And there was a couple cross or a couple thieves that were being uh charged also with them, one on each side of him. And we see in in the the chapter here that Jesus is is being illegitimately killed by crucifixion. And he prays here. He says, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they did." Amazing and unbelievable humility &gt;&gt; in the in the presence of injustice. But we see in verse 39, and maybe you can pull that up. Excuse [clears throat] me, Vicki. And they call them the the male factors, but these were actually thieves. And we see here that the one male factor, the one thief railed on Jesus and mocked Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't be too critical of them cuz sometimes we do that also. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want to I want to this this is powerful annoying. I want to I want to go back to Judas the scared. I want to tell you something. You know, every one of us do what he did is we value Jesus. on Jesus Judas a scar the value was 30 pieces of silver &gt;&gt; what is it to you &gt;&gt; you have a value on &gt;&gt; it's very clear to see it in your life &gt;&gt; amen we see this one male factor he's railing on Jesus and he said if you're him and you're the Christ and you could save others why don't you just save us Now watch the difference in arrogancy to humility. And the other thief on the exact other side that was both being charged for robbery, he he looked at the other guy and he said, "Are you out of your mind?" He said, "Don't you fear God? We are getting justly the price that we deserve to be charged with because we're robbers. But here's a man that has done nothing and is paying the equal price." And Jesus looked at that man and he said, "This day you'll be with me in paradise." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'd like to ask you the something. What was the difference? &gt;&gt; Both men, both on a cross, and both robbers. Y &gt;&gt; it was their attitude. &gt;&gt; That's right. Y &gt;&gt; it was their attitude to God. &gt;&gt; For the other robber said, he said, "Lord, when you come into your kingdom, remember me." And Jesus said, "Because of your attitude, &gt;&gt; I'll never forget you. Wow. We see another example in the Old Testament is Saul and David. Both godly men. Both godly men. But Saul never ever repented for his sins. Paul went out to war. He had orders from God through the prophet to utterly destroy. And when he come back and he brought the lambs and that Saul says twice he said it was the people that did it. I'm not guilty. It was all your fault. It was my fault. &gt;&gt; You know Saul never asked Saul never did ask for forgiveness. But he never admitted that he had done wrong until Jesus said, "You're through." &gt;&gt; But the difference was arrogancy. But the difference with David was David did a far worse crime. But God don't rate crimes. But David had murdered and raped. &gt;&gt; Far worse crime. And when the prophet came to David and he said, "You are that man." David said, "I have sinned." &gt;&gt; Period. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Look at the difference in their approach. &gt;&gt; One was arrogant, said, "I never did nothing wrong. It was the people that did it and they were just hanging around me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the other one, David said, "I have sinned against the Lord." And I want to show you our last example before we really get into our text here in Corinthians is there was a woman in the Bible whose daughter was grievously vexed with the devil in Matthew 15. and she came on to Jesus and because she was uh a gentile and not a uh she called Jesus by her wrong name. She was asking for Jesus to touch her daughter and Jesus gave her the greatest insult that he could have possibly gave a woman. He said, "It's not meat to take the children's bad and cast them to dogs." That would have pretty well cleaned up the church &gt;&gt; most places. &gt;&gt; But look at her humility. She had just been called &gt;&gt; She' just been called by who she had called her Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A dog. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; A dog. You know, &gt;&gt; she says, "Truth, Lord." I That's unbelievable. If there was ever a Christian in the Bible, it had to be her. &gt;&gt; That's right. But even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table. &gt;&gt; And look at how God he he literally changed 365 degrees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Over her attitude. Jesus said,"Woman, you have great faith, &gt;&gt; and be it unto thee as thou even thou wilt." &gt;&gt; And her daughter was healed the very same hour. Do you know her daughter would have died of that sickness? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If she would have took the proper steps of saying, "You just insulted me." &gt;&gt; And he did. So see, you know, it's it's amazing. Amen. So our attitude really does define everything you get from God. &gt;&gt; Everything you get from God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just jump into our text and we're we're really preaching here this morning in Corinthians is Paul's message. And and let's just go to 1 Corinthians 1:10. And he said, "Now I beseech you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing." Well, that would be a miracle. And that there be no divisions among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. That's what God is expecting of the believers this morning. And he said, "For it has been declared unto me, brethren, that there's ones in the house that are contentious among you." And here we can go into this scripture in verse 12 and 13. And I'm not going to read all these because we would be here tomorrow and that. But here they were saying there was people that were saying, "Well, I got saved under Paul and I got saved under Apollos and I got saved under this one and that one and this one is a great person to me and and I would listen to this one online and not that one and I wouldn't go to his meetings but I would go to this one and and Paul here he jumps into this and he said, "Was Christ divided? Was Paul were these people crucified for you &gt;&gt; or were they b were you baptized in Paul's name? And here Paul says, he said, "I'm glad that I never ever baptized you because you would think that it was my spirit getting on you that I baptized you in my name because it was me." &gt;&gt; Said, "Christ didn't send me to baptize you, but to preach the gospel &gt;&gt; and unless the cross of Christ should be made to none effect." You see, we we have to be so careful. You know, you know why the worship felt so powerful on that last song. &gt;&gt; Because we were worshiping Jehovah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We respects one another but not worship. Amen. God's no respective person. So even when we respect one, I I don't deserve no more respect than any one of you sitting here of the least of the children. Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; He said in 23, he said, "But if we preach Christ crucified, it is unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness." You know that same spirit's here today because people want to adore. Brother Bram said it this way. He said, "People are looking for a Superman to save the world." He said, "Russia's looking for a Superman &gt;&gt; that'll save their continent. We're looking for a Superman that's going to save our continent, but God's the only Superman." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So here the the the very Christ that was crucified was a stumbling block and foolishness to all the believers in the Bible. Wow, that's amazing. But unto them that were called, Christ was the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of God. And here and we jump into chapter 2 in 1 Corinthians. And I want to show you how Paul's emphasizing one person, Christ. He said in 1 Corinthians 2, he said, "I am determined to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And him crucified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. Wait a minute. Paul was a scholar. He was a brilliant genius. &gt;&gt; But Paul never counted none of his physical abilities. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to serving God. &gt;&gt; For I was with you in weakness. He wasn't a weak man. In fear. He wasn't fearful &gt;&gt; and in much trembling. at look at the humility of Paul. No wonder God could say, "I've chosen him to take a message to the Gentiles." &gt;&gt; Amen. The humility of humbling himself was like enormous. He said, "Watch this." And the after the scripture, watch this. In Christ, the mystery of God revealed, he said, "By the lack of revelation is why we have so many divisions among us and is so much mockery. God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we move on to 1 Corinthians 3. And we see here and and you know God does everything for a reason. 1 Corinthians 3 is almost an identical retreat of chapter one. &gt;&gt; Almost an identical. For I cannot speak unto you of spiritual things, because you are carnal, even babes in Christ, because you put this one ahead of the other. Be ye not yet carnal, whereas there is among you envy and strife and divisions, and ye are not carnal, but walk as men. you know, and and he this ain't personally here, but it it is so sad to see go Christians. It I'm telling you, it's a it's it's a sin. &gt;&gt; It's a sin, but it's flesh nature to put somebody else down &gt;&gt; to raise yourself up. &gt;&gt; That's very powerful. Who did Jesus put down so he was able to save me? &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; He never even put down the soldiers &gt;&gt; that drove the nails. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He never put down the soldiers that give them the vinegar. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he never put down the ones that threw the dice and gambled for his uniform. &gt;&gt; But you just let somebody come and have a different revelation than you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they'll talk behind that person's back. &gt;&gt; They're not as far as me think. &gt;&gt; That's that's a terrible curse. terrible sin. &gt;&gt; It breaks God's heart. &gt;&gt; It's everywhere in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. If somebody isn't and we I know we mentioned this you well I I'm just going to tell you this. This is are the last two years we've been at Central America this time of year, you know, and the churches are just as divided there as they are anywhere in the world. &gt;&gt; People that are professing, it don't matter what somebody else thinks. Why can't you just hold the door for them? You know, I'm going to shock you. Shock you really bad. You know, my brothers are singing in a Zinfree Methodist church tonight Christmas songs. &gt;&gt; And I'm going &gt;&gt; and I'm going &gt;&gt; and I'm going to go and I'm going to let my light so shine. And I'm going to put salt and pepper on top of me. And I hope some of them brush and get it in their nose. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be their buddy. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to to say I'm I'm above. No, if I was, I'd need to stay home. &gt;&gt; Actually, I'd need to go to the altar. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That That's so sad. So sad. You know, when I went I I had I had a man tell me yesterday, he said, "The only time there's unity in this country is when you show up, D." And when I was there, there was a minimum of five pastors in one building. And the guy said, "As soon as you leave, they'll not have nothing to do with us. But when your presence is here now listen brother, I am not put that should be the case with every one of you. &gt;&gt; It has I'm not preaching a message about brother Dale." Amen. &gt;&gt; When you show up somewhere, &gt;&gt; you should draw people to you like flies on a molasses pale &gt;&gt; on a hot day. &gt;&gt; You get a lot more with honey than you do with vinegar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You should attract people like a magnet. &gt;&gt; I feel the pull. The people should feel the pull of something crazy supernatural. &gt;&gt; And they do. I got a testimony of that from a sister in in in our church yesterday. Met somebody at the grocery store. They were so drawn to him. They came to their house the same day. &gt;&gt; You see, it ain't a message about brother Dale. &gt;&gt; But we don't to get to heaven. You don't have to divide people to get there. Just take care of yourself and make everyone want to go on your cloud, &gt;&gt; on your wing. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You could read this scripture in chapter 1 or chapter 3 1-10, but I'm not going to read it. But it was all divisions over flesh. &gt;&gt; And actually I am going to read part of this here. Here he said Paul he says he said I have planted and Apollos says watered but God give the increase. The only part of that verse you need to read is but God give the increase. &gt;&gt; But God give the increase. And so then neither is he that planteth anything &gt;&gt; he that waterth anything &gt;&gt; but God. Oh, I like that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God give the increase [snorts] according to the grace that is given on to you. Amen. God help us. God help us. And then we come down to our text. Amen. In Corinthians 4, 1 Corinthians 4. Now you see how every chapter Paul is dealing with what we've preached on the last three services. every single chapter &gt;&gt; that you might learn in us not to think of yourself above what it is written. That no one be puffed up &gt;&gt; one against the other. Puffed up. I was talking to a pastor in another country and he said it's customary here if somebody's throwing a big service that you know depending on you know it it wouldn't happen in North America continent but sometimes the churches are really full and sometimes there's not even parking and so let me give you an example this wasn't evil at all when when we did the dedication for pastor Leo in Uganda he had m he had zillions of pastors 70 or 80 pastor pastor's present. That's that's just unbelievable. And he physically told the pastors, "Don't bring nobody but your family or there'll be no place to sit." Now, they had three tents outside the church that held about 6 or 700 people. And you you would have had to park a mile away if because they don't have a bike parking lot cuz nobody has cars, very few cars. And so, see, there is reason. And so this brother was telling me in another continent, he said, "We wouldn't show go to a church if they were having a big special meetings unless we had a formal invitation." And somebody's saying, "Well, I had sent him an invitation and the brother sent me the message from the other person and this is what the message said. Am I going to be blessed to have your presence?" He said, "That's not an invitation." Do you see how Christians, so-called Christians, will go right on the line of lying? &gt;&gt; And they believe they're going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; You know, I have things among ministers that are so close to white life that the minister copies and pastes. He said, "You'll never believe this. So, I'll just send you what he sent me. and they all believe they're going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, now God knows we're not we're not worried about But see, that's got to change for those whoever's going. That's not going to be that way. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's all comes down to our attitude. We were we were in God's plan and we can't change where we are in God's plan. And but it's miraculous his plan. And and you know, if you have a bad attitude because because you don't like what God did in the plan, well, you're actually fighting God. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Let's just drop to chapter 7 of Second Corinthians. And you'll notice how the content is still the same. And I want to read this in verse 17. But as God has distributed every man as the Lord has called everyone, so let him walk. You know what Jesus said to Peter? What is that to thee? Follow thou me. &gt;&gt; What is that to thee? Follow thou me. Well, they What is that to thee? Follow thou me. &gt;&gt; And so ordained I in all churches. Here's Paul saying how he walked. Amen. As God called everyone, that's how he walked. And is any man called being, watch this. Is any one of the men being called circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. &gt;&gt; If God called you to that's fine. &gt;&gt; It is any man uncircumcised, let him not be circumcised. &gt;&gt; Watch how he says this here. He's trying to He's trying to show you how valuable your doctrines are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and I believe in doctrines. You you know, Brother Bram said, "A local church ain't even a local church without doctrines." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I I do believe in doctrines, &gt;&gt; but doctrines don't divide. &gt;&gt; Watch in verse 19. And he said circumcision is nothing. Uncircumcision is nothing but keeping the commandments of God. You know what the commandments of God is? You must be born again. If you don't have a new birth and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you ain't going nowhere. Let every man abide in the same calling wherewin when he is called. And ye are bought with a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not ye servants of men, brethren. Let every man wherein he is called there abide in God. Amen. We should be so pleased and so blessed. God knew. God made you exactly how he wanted you to serve him. &gt;&gt; You were you were made to worship God and to prove to Satan that there would be a bride in this last age that would never fall like the first Eve. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all the characteristics and and and everything you need to fulfill that plan was in God's mind when he created you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I I want to I'm going to get into I got some I got we're going into Corinthians 12, but I want to show you a a quote that will jar your foundation. Now, now I I want to just show you something that our prophet was a man of God. And and so watch how he shows how a man of God, the nature of God operates. And this will jar you and you need to put this up here, Vicki. 263. Here's brother Bram talking. So, Brother Dale's not insulting Brother Bram. This is Brother Bram talking in ' 61. He said, "I am not a preacher, but if you read this, he was talking about the preachers that were on the platform when he's talking." He said, "But there's preachers and they've got a higher office than I have. I wonder how many message believers believe that. &gt;&gt; Let's move on. Mind now he's explaining the gift of God. And we're going to go into this in in multiple quotes. He compared the gift of God as a diamond and as a room in a building. He said, "Mine is prophetic office to prophesy." He's a prophet. &gt;&gt; Now, they're not that a minister. Most ministers can't prophesy. It's not a pathetic p. I can't see. I don't see visions. &gt;&gt; They're not built like that. They wasn't ordained for that. But what does the Bible say? Now I believe the Bible was a good absolute. &gt;&gt; God has said in the church, apostles, missionaries, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists. Do you know that brother Bram said, and I have the quote not in my message right here, but I have it in my iPad, that brother Bram said, the highest co calling of the five-fold ministry is an apostle. The very highest. &gt;&gt; You know what apostle is? A missionary. one that saves souls, the highest calling. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; Watch this. And he said, "Them are gifts ordained of God and anointed." Now watch here the next paragraph. Now this is again just for clarification. This is the prophet's message here. He said, "Now I have no education and that's the reason I am not a preacher." These men, now he's talking about the preachers. She's just carrying on the next paragraph. These preachers could take the word and they wouldn't have to use one of these gifts and they could lay the word out there so they could tie Satan in such knots that he couldn't get out of it. Now, he's talking about the preachers on the platform behind him. &gt;&gt; Okay, are you picking up something? Look at the humility of God's prophet. He's saying the men of God sitting behind me have got a gift that they can tie the Satan in knots. And watch what he says. You could tie Satan in knots and he couldn't get out of it. &gt;&gt; See, but let's let's look right after the C there, right near the bottom about the bottom last paragraph. But he says, "I can't do that. He said that's not my calling. They're called for that now, but they're men of God. Every man that's called of men. And he said, "If you go into this," he said, "now then, how are you going to fail from getting well passing through that ark like this?" See how the look at the nature, the seed of God brings the nature of God. Look at the attitude of the star messenger for this age. Father &gt;&gt; said preachers, &gt;&gt; those preachers on the pot have a higher office than me. &gt;&gt; Now if we look into this in first Corinthians, this backs up what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now 1 Corinthians 12:4, he said, "Now there is, how does it say that? diversity of gifts and the same spirit and different administrations in the same Lord. And see how that that all workketh the same God which workketh in one and for all &gt;&gt; and the manifestations. But see how people won't take this scripture and they'll take one gift and they'll put it up on the clouds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or or or one revel. See how the &gt;&gt; but this is Paul's message &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham built upon it. He said I preach what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; He said this is a manifestation of the spirit that is given to every man to profit with all. Now I'm going to there you know and so he goes into the spirit of wisdom, knowledge and faith and all this and discerning of tongues and kinds and all this. But let's go to verse 11. But all these workketh that one and the self-made same spirit dividing every man s separately as he will. It's God. It's God that puts the gifts in the church. It's God that puts the gifts in you and it's God in the different manifestations. &gt;&gt; But it's all one body. As the body is one, so it has many members and all the members are of the are members of that body being many and are one body. So also is Christ. So I want to show you something this morning. Christ [screaming] will look different. &gt;&gt; The anointed one will look different. Remember how the prophet gave gave credit to his wife to Jehovah because she prepared his clothes and ironed his shirts &gt;&gt; and kept the crowd back from the door and answered the doorbell. &gt;&gt; He was saying God's placed a gift in her to protect me so I can minister. Yeah, &gt;&gt; every [screaming] part of that is value. &gt;&gt; Every part of that's value. And the prophet goes into this. [cough] He said, "For the one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free or been made to drink of the one spirit." But we forget that. For the body is not one member but many. But most of the time in the in the ranks of Christianity, if a member is different than you, it's got to be wrong. &gt;&gt; But it could still be a part of the body. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we see this, you know, it goes into now it's talking about foot and hand, ear and all this. And then we go to verse 19. It says, "If they were all one member, then where would the body be? But now are we many different members, &gt;&gt; but yet we're Christ?" Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're all individuals and you all are different than me but still Christ. &gt;&gt; Then he goes after this in 21 he talks about if you were all the eye and the ear all this and then you know this chapter actually finishes that the the the the more comely parts get more credit but that's not how our fleshly body works. your little toe gets more credit because you know if you don't think you need your little toe just chop it off and you'll tend to fall over to your right side &gt;&gt; if that's the one you cut off cuz your little toe is balance for the whole body &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; but because we're humans we tend to only value what we can see as important &gt;&gt; but that's not how God is. Amen. Now, I want to read if if it's okay, I want to and we're we're doing good. I want to read some quotes that are directly connected to 1 Corinthians 12:4 on the message of he said, "Now about Christ was the fullness." And if you see a man here prophesying and another one a pastor, another one evangelist, and another one a teacher, he says, "Now, you can't say that you're not in it because it's just one of them is a raise off of God." And it all points right back to God, the big master diamond. You know, if you have a big diamond or a little diamond or if you have a blue diamond or a round diamond, it's still a diamond. &gt;&gt; Another one here, the infallible. He said, "Now, we might differ one from another." Now, is is that kind of what I was saying? Here's a prophet backing that up. He said, "You often thought the reason that doo perhaps is because it's the body not recognizing different ministerial gifts that are in the body." You see, we do believe in the gifts of the spirit certainly and God's supernatural. And so, let's just jump to the next paragraph here. He said, "So God is just like a great big diamond." That's God. How's it chipped out and fixed up and magnified and God so arrayed in his affairs on earth until he would be able to like a big diamond, the light of the diamond would reflect these rays of light. And some of them might be blue and some might be green and some might be real, whatever that word is, dime. But sometimes as humans, we get it in our head. Well, if if you're a blue diamond and you see a red one, well, that that's that's the other that's the other. &gt;&gt; What? But there's not another God. &gt;&gt; That that's the other uh Oh, you mean the other church. But it's God's the diamond. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the other. &gt;&gt; But see, God had different, you know, brother Brandham talked about God was God of variety. That's why he made flowers different &gt;&gt; and each light would array a different color maybe. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Right at the bottom, but it's all reflecting from the same great diamond. Amen. &gt;&gt; Another quote and and we're coming to the end here. We're not going to be long this morning. I don't believe. But another one from the same verse in the message hub 12 and 4. And he said this he's he's comparing the the body of Christ to a room. And he said so let's just jump to the main paragraph. He said, "This room here is the body of Christ, and by one spirit are we all baptized into this room. And in the room, there's a gift of a chair to relax in. And there's a gift of light to be able to see. And there's a gift of heat, so you didn't have to wear your coat." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there's a gift of a rocking chair for their mothers with babies. And there's a gift of a lounge and a gift of a rug. And they're all And there's a gift of a picture, but it's all the room is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The room is Christ. Be careful you don't reject Christ. &gt;&gt; Be careful if the person sitting beside you you don't like might have the spirit of Christ on them. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Bram talked about every church age that missed its its move of God was because it didn't recognize the presence of God. When Jesus came and was born on the earth, the reason they crucified him was they didn't recognize the presence of Jehovah in their midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is so the case with everything you do to serve God. If you truly recognize the presence of Jehovah in your life, in your atmosphere of your life, &gt;&gt; everything you did this past week, you do different. &gt;&gt; Me, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to read about three quotes. Vicki, you're going to see some with the paragraph or the brackets around them. Them are the ones I want to read. Now, I want to show you something. We preached on this June 22nd, and I'm just going to hit on I think there's four of them, and I'm just going to hit Pacific paragraphs, but if anybody wants these are long quotes. So, this morning, I'm pulling out a paragraph. I'm not pulling out of context, but I didn't want to be another hour. And we did preach it June 22nd. He said, 'Now you'll see what I mean here, brethren. I'm driving towards one thing, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the unifying of the body of Jesus Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; One thing I'm driving between the Jesus Christ and unifying the body of Jesus Christ. Brother Brown didn't care if you believe different than him. I'm going to prove this. &gt;&gt; Do you? Now, I I have to disclaimer this because as soon as you say something like that, you'll say people will say, "Well, you don't believe what Brother Brham." I wholeheartedly believe what he preached. And this is what he preached. &gt;&gt; What I'm reading right here, &gt;&gt; what I don't believe in is ministers pulling out their favorite oneliner &gt;&gt; that's not balanced in the message &gt;&gt; of the hour. &gt;&gt; He said that's my whole purpose is unifying. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Next paragraph. Now, I don't say nothing about, hey, you ain't baptized in Jesus name. Now, I want to just stop right there. That's true baptism. &gt;&gt; True baptism. &gt;&gt; Is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true baptism. &gt;&gt; Father's not a name. Son ain't a name. Father, Son, Holy Spirit, it's not a name. There's no [screaming] power in those titles. &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to just I want to sm this. You know, brother Bram had two or three times where he tried the power of God. Do you know he had he had Lucifer come in his room and stand at the head of his bed and challenged him in on the godhead of of how brother Brham taught the Godhead. And brother Bram said, you know, in the name of brother Brandham, William Brandham, and in the name of the titles and all this. But when brother Bam said in the name of the Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; he said that Lucifer vanished. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he also talked about when he was in I forget the exact scenario, but he talked about twice I think there's at least two quotes where they were doing spiritual witchcraft and they had actually tooken a a table, a four-legged table, and it had wavered up in the air and it was floating up in the air and they were trying to curse Jehovah. They were mocking Jehovah. And brother Bram's presence. Brother Bram was not a a Brother Bam was a gentleman because he had the nature of Christ. &gt;&gt; But there's times when you're pushed &gt;&gt; that it's more than you can take. &gt;&gt; But Brother Brham wanted to try it. And so he'd say he said and you know in the name of this and the table just stayed there. I'm talking the table super elevated off the floor. He said, "And and you know, he'd say his name, it's elevated. William Brandham, it's elevated. In the Father, Son, Holy Ghost, it's elevated. In the pastor's name, it's elevated." &gt;&gt; And this is how the quote goes. He said, "But what I said, in the name of Jesus Christ, may you come down." He said, he said, "That table smashed down, all four legs broke off the table &gt;&gt; because the power &gt;&gt; is in the name &gt;&gt; of Jehovah." But watch how the prophet explains this. He So, so you you understand that's true baptism. &gt;&gt; If you get baptized, you need to be baptized in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; But he said, "If you ain't baptized in Jesus' name, then you're going to hell." He said, "Now that's nonsense. Wait a minute. You don't You mean I got to quit insulting the trinitarians? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now that's nonsense." &gt;&gt; I I'm just going to show you a little disclaimer. There's a lot of people won't show you this. &gt;&gt; Because they're building a kingdom onto theirel, &gt;&gt; but brother Dale's not built this. See, you're not mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; You You're never will be mine. &gt;&gt; And And I'm a sinner. &gt;&gt; Okay, you understand? I was born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world stealing cookies. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't get this wrong. &gt;&gt; You're Christ. &gt;&gt; We're his servants. I just happen to be the one sharing the word. &gt;&gt; We're his servant. Is that Can somebody huh? &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, sorry, Fred. Oh, that's all right. It didn't up said that's all. I was thinking it was mine. Fred, don't have a heart attack. It won't scare away God. It takes a lot more noise than that. Scare away God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the exact same ring I had. Say, I'm I'm sure I shut it off. Do you see how Do you see how our prophet was the seed of God &gt;&gt; and he had the nature of God? Now watch watch his attitude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You just seen it there. &gt;&gt; I got to go down and find this. Oh, here we go. Did you find the next one there, Vicki? It's a bigger &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, no. 11 11. Yeah, there we go. That's what I'm on. He said, 'Now brother, if you get to the place that you won't reach across the fence [snorts] and come across the street and associate and go to another church to hear Christmas carols. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And call a man a brother just because there might be a little hair's difference. &gt;&gt; Watch what he says in the paragraph. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is brother Brown talking. A little hair is different. He said, "How do you know you're not a little different in God's sight in some little something?" &gt;&gt; You know what brother Brown just did there? He killed your arrogant spirit. &gt;&gt; He killed your arrogancy. Well, bless God. I've been in the message 45 years. I sat in the prophet's message and I &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; so &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Blessed are those that have not seen and yet still &gt;&gt; believe." &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's Let's go back. This I can actually give you the the title of this one. How do you know a hair's difference? How do you know that you might be off just a little something? You say, "Well, we have the revelation. All the mystery." Yes, there are all the mysteries. How do you believe your interpretation of the mysteries that Brother Brham did and aren't exactly &gt;&gt; like Jehovah thought? &gt;&gt; Well, you you're saying your brain is as big as Jehovah. Well, let me just tell you something. The Jehovah I serve won't fit in your brain &gt;&gt; even with the mysteries revealed. Because my Jehovah is bigger than about a three or three and a half pound brain. &gt;&gt; So no matter how much you see, let me tell you. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, is it okay to quote the Bible? The Bible says that we through a glass darkly. But someday [laughter] &gt;&gt; someday I'm going to step right before &gt;&gt; 100% of the presence &gt;&gt; of Jehovah &gt;&gt; and you won't be standing. I'll guarantee you that &gt;&gt; and be a brother. And be a brother. Somebody is a hair different than you. And be a brother. And be a brother. Why certainly brother? The altar is your place. Exactly. Right. get right with God. I wouldn't want that evil spirit to ever be on me. That's right. The one the pot is calling the kettle black. &gt;&gt; And this whole series has been nothing but God shown me that a lot of ministry is the pot calling the kettle black. Help us, father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, help me. &gt;&gt; I'm only human. &gt;&gt; You're ahead of me, Vicki. &gt;&gt; Now, I apologize for boring you June 22nd message, but you know, when Paul wrote Corinthians, he wrote the same thing in chapter one as he wrote in chapter 3. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; uh, we're doing the same thing as June here. Brother Brown says, "Wow, you belong to our organization or you don't belong to anything." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're the one that's right and the rest of you is wrong. &gt;&gt; Separate yourself. Oh my. Yay. The days of miracles has passed. That's He's just putting a scenario. They're not past. Yay. And divine healing. And there's nothing to it. Yeah, there is. Yo, and there's no such thing as this or the other. Watch what prophet says. He says, "Oh my." See, that's nothing but the poison breath &gt;&gt; of Satan. &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing to do with him. You don't believe it like we do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and around the ranks of this. The reason we don't have nothing to do with anything other than our ranks and our camp meeting is because you don't believe to where you don't go to the you don't go to the temp camp. Well, no, you don't go to let me see. You don't go to the advis camp. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And oh, fantastic man of God. Well, no, you don't go to the camp in New Brunswick. No. Uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's there's got to be a camp somewhere else. No, I go to this one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's because you won't." He said, "That's the poison breath of Satan. We're the ones that's right, and all the rest of them are wrong." Well, of course you think you're right because you live in that tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But watch how Corinthians, I believe, what what did I read there? Corinthians 17 say it said that you're one member of the body. &gt;&gt; You're one ray of light that's blue coming off the diamond, but there's another ray coming off that's red. &gt;&gt; There's another one coming off. Now, those rays are still, now watch, I want to clarify something. Those rays are still going back to the God diamond. I'm not talking about leaving the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The word of God is you must be born again &gt;&gt; and be filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Let's go to another one here. 61 quote here. Just just a one paragraph. And I I have way more in my iPad here, but I'm literally scrolling. 61 is Vicki where I'm at. Um was just down a little bit from 116. I don't think that's He said, 'I tell you what, where we've made our mistake. Now, if you'd excuse me for saying this in closing, I picked that in the right spot because we are closing. Where we've made our mistake is we've tried to denominate oursel into it and we've made it and the rest of them don't have it. We have it and the rest of them don't have it. And then he names different churches. They're nothing. They're all cool. And he said, "If you don't watch out, you're going to be the same &gt;&gt; as the others. And we're going to watch and find oursel that same way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we go back and we &gt;&gt; the prophet said, he said, "If you don't watch out, you're going to fall too." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the poison breath of Satan." And then he said, "Well, that's what did he say? Foolishness. Something when you think somebody's going to hell. Ridiculous. I believe the word he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And watch how brother Bram's and we're we're closing it. Watch how his seed and his nature and his attitude was. Watch how his his attitude was that I'm pointing everything to Jesus Christ. And my whole goal and my whole desire is unify everybody around this Jesus Christ. That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody. &gt;&gt; And like you're some aren't going to like pumpkin pie and some aren't going to like banana pie or cherry pie. And if you hit a pit, just spit it out. Don't throw the whole pie out cuz we worked really hard making the pie. &gt;&gt; But there might be, you know, &gt;&gt; you see what I mean? And that is the spirit of Christ. Now, you have been enormously blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. and this day to have a star messenger &gt;&gt; come and reveal the mysteries of the Bible. But if that makes you arrogant, you backslid. &gt;&gt; You backslid. &gt;&gt; And many I I believe God's going to let me say this. And many are in that state right there. God help us. That has to change for those that are going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's to change. Now, I want to just close with this scenario. You know, God's going to have a wife &gt;&gt; and that's going to be caught away in a rapture. There's going to be a great tribulation on the earth. We're going to have a honeymoon, which will be a thousand years. While the tribulation's carrying over, there'll be 145,000 Jews saved. Then there will be those that are converted in the tribulation, Gentiles, and those that were even good to the bride that will actually be serend. &gt;&gt; But your attitude can never change where those people are placed. &gt;&gt; But watch this. But your attitude will change where you're placed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. Your attitude towards me &gt;&gt; will never change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where brother Dale's being placed. &gt;&gt; But that same attitude would change your placing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember our first quote that we read? Everything that's that's a lot of stuff that God does is based on your attitude. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. God help us. He left the splendor of heaven. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God. Let's sing that song. Hallelujah. He left the splendor of heaven for a no good sinner boy like brother Dale. He left the splender of heaven, knowing his destiny was [music] Yeah. Heat.

Blessed is your name. Let's sing that song. We're singing again. Come, let us adore him. You know, church, I want to share [music] something with you. When you have your light of your baptism of the Holy Spirit and you're in the presence of God, I'd have a hard time seeing your light [music] for God's light. &gt;&gt; But God placed us where we are. &gt;&gt; To go where it's dark. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're to go where it's dark. Where brother Dale can't go. [music] and where your neighbor can't go &gt;&gt; and where your husband can't go and where your wife can't go and you take that exact same light and it's just radiant [music] &gt;&gt; and you're the only one in the room with that light. Everybody in your presence [music] will see your light. Don't hide your light under a [music] bushel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's all these messages are. &gt;&gt; Throw away your church bushel [music] &gt;&gt; and let your light shine all around. And then on Sunday, you can bring your light back to church. [music] Put it under the bushel. Cuz see, we all have the same light. If we were all baptism had the new birth, we all had the same light. So we don't have to shine our light to each other's. [music] It's not about brother Dale's light shining more than anybody else's light. Even little child. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when you get out these doors, throw them in the bush. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what all these messages meant. [music] We've been hiding our light far too long [music] &gt;&gt; and nobody can see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this and we'll be dismissed. God, we love you. God bless you. Amen. [music] He loves you. Come us. [singing and music] Yeah. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Oh, [music and singing] [music] heat, [music and singing] heat. [music and singing] Oh, [singing and music] [music and singing] [music and singing] [singing and music] heat, heat. [singing] Heat [music] [singing] [music] [singing] up [music] here. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music]
