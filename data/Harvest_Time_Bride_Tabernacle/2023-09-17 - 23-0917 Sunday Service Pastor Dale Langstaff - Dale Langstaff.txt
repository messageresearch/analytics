community may their light shine bright so bright and may they be so salty that it creates a thirst and the lives of the unsaved bride this morning we give you the glory for it in your name we just pray that You' be with every part of this service we take every Spirit under our control in Jesus Christ's name and may everything be pleasing to you in your name we pray amen amen we just welcome you this morning hugely amen we're Unworthy of your presence we really are but he's sure worthy this morning amen and just uh Jared and Julie and their family and Vanessa's out and when somebody's out it's a huge uh huge pocket amen and jar ask me uh my thoughts on it and and I encouraged them to go man they they did a they did a church in Sombra a very very small Church probably half as big a sanctuary as ours it's it's a very narrow church it's like a Community Church an independent church and they did a much much work on it and the people really really loved them and they wanted them to come be in their service and uh man just uh but I mean our our desire is that there could be a testimony just Jared's family walking in that church can you imagine the questions that'll come up why why just why man the prophet said that the only Bible that most of the town will read is your life you won't have to preach a word just live your life amen so we of these people in the church I've known my whole life man so uh just uh so that's that's why they're out and also remember sister ptty she just had a she worked in nights and had a hard night and and no sleep and she messaged us this morning and and just that God would bless her and give her a sister Patty has a hard life at work and at home man if you know the situation amen and just that God would show her grace and mercy in her life and and we really mean that you know I woke up this morning thinking you know looking at the clock and was up early and I was thinking even even when I showering I said you know Joseph and sister Meer they'll be they'll be on the road and and then I think of mat and Abigail next and I said you know you don't we don't drive that far to see people I mean we'll be disappointed if we do and and and even though we appreciate each other but when he comes oh I'm I it's just it's just crazy crazy good just really really good amen we just we just uh we love him this morning amen amen we're just going to turn to our scripture just uh uh just pray that you'll help me preach this morning uh just picking you know uh a minister normally has many many many many messages that he's thinking of or meditating on but the Holy Spirit really spoke to me something from last week and when uh when our brother Isaac's in actually just a word of announcements he's going to be here the first of October the first Sunday first two weeks from today um we have a we're going to on the Saturday and we'll get home very late and so it worked out for him to come but he he mentioned something about and our prophet and I have these quotes and and I I need to go fast through the beginning of our message or I'll never get to the the meet of where I want to go but he mentioned our Prophet said that we would have another Ephesians age and this age and the Ephesians age was a very mature age amen let's we better read our scripture I I'll start preaching and you'll be standing all Hebrews 121 Hebrews 121 and2 man just as you're looking to that I'll just carry on that and the he the Ephesians Church age was very mature age and had a grip on the word and and he just you know as I studied that and even brother ising said you know there was there was 11 members in the Ephesians Church age and Paul Paul the greatest Apostle ministered to them for 13 years and they they were a dynamic just like we have the revealed word in our day and the Mysteries are unfolded in the Bible is a brand new book but Jesus just had one thing wrong with them amen and I say God help me God help me that just in studying that it really ministered to me and and you know here when when we when we would just read our scripture sorry therefore seeing we also are compressed about by so great a cloud of witness wait which does easily so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking onto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross did ured the cross despising the shame and is set down of the father let's just turn to another scripture here a couple more Mark 4 Mark 4 Hallelujah and we're going to read Mark 4:18 and 19 and this Parable Jesus talked about is from and 18 and these are they which are sowed among thorns MNS and such as heard the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entered in and choked out the word and it became unfruitful Hallelujah let's turn over just before you're seated one more time sorry for Luke 123 and 48 Luke 12:43 blessed is the servant whom the Lord when he cometh shall find him so doing 44 of the of a true ruler over all that he has but but and if that servant say in his heart the Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the manservants and the maids and eat drink and be drunken and the lord of the servant will come in the day that he lookth not for him and the hour when he be not aware and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers and the servant which knew the Lord's will which knew the Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes iniquity to know to do right and not do it but he that knew not worthy of Stripes shall be beaten very few for whosoever much is given of us much shall be required and to have committed they will ask much Lord Jesus we ask that you'd just add the blessing to our word and we just pray that you'll come and just Minister this morning and we pray and everything that's done Jesus name amen man you may have your seats this morning I'm just sorry you're just laying a foundation of the scripture you see in the scripture there's much much talk about this and much warning about this and and and we we need to be careful in the Ephesians Church age they had they had the revealed word for their age they had a great leader they had and and and were mature dedicated people and were on the word of God but they just had one little tiny flaw Hallelujah God help us to to measure up you know I I just want to read a quote because it was I'm I'm ministering this message a lot from Harvest time before he went home but I I seen a nugget in here right at the beginning I wanted to grab that we ministered on you know recently we ministered on John seeing uh son of man Son of God in the the golden candlesticks in the church ages and I wanted I I just seen something you know and I I when we were ministering I showed you or God showed us how that we were in the Son of God before the foundation of the world when John seen him in the church ages we were there and John said in Revelations he said it looked like the son of man but he was confused because the bride was in him amen and listen to what the prophet said in the meaning the other night in the assembly he said I wondered if John saw me when he saw the Nations gathered and Propet says did he see me he says surely he did surely he saw you now John saw the son of man how did he see you he saw you in the son of man it looked like it looked almost like the son of man I I thought it was I thought it was him but there was a he said surely he did if your name was in the Lamb's Book of Life and a part of Christ before for the foundation of the world oh that's that's that's a good one man thank you Lord amen oh yes amen so the prophet you know when he ministers he'll he'll mention different things at the beginning of his message and that was one of those quotes that that was burning up his heart and uh he wanted to it he ministered the Harvest Time and the Harvest time if you've ever listen to that message is a lot about the Temptation Of Satan tempting Jesus and the wilderness and we want to close with that but we go back to our Hebrews 121 and we look at this scripture here for for a bit this morning and we see in in verse two it says looking onto Jesus and I looked in my study Bible and uh and when I was studying this week and it it breaks down a lot of the words and it takes them back to the Greek and I want to part just for a second and lay help lay a foundation that looking part when you go back to the Greek I'm not even going to pretend to say those Greek words but it says from and see is the Greek word is the definition of that Greek word is looking is from and to see and it literally is rendering to look away from and he said but it implies that it is to give one's undivided attention to be fixed on something it's not the preacher amen this is the person has turned away from all other things in order to gaze intently on an object a Believer whose Vision should be filled is Christ fixed on him rather than being filled with distractions we are living in a world of destructions man the the the modern so science and and you know all that goes with it the internet you know I I I shared testimonies uh a few weeks ago when we were preaching and and uh how how uh and we we sold those wagons was one of the testimonies that God did an non-believable thing uh every time God does something it's unbelievable but true and we went down was an Army a minite man that bought these wagons and we were actually able to witness to them and and and uh it's just our world has fell apart it's not is falling apart it has fell apart and their Amy Community I'm not going to dwell on this their Amish community they are stopping to stopping to have the kids ride their bike to school because they're afraid they're going to get abducted I'm just like there's nothing left in this world nothing the bride of Christ needs to come to this realization that we need to go home amen and you you see see the government talking about this winter coming up and things uh changing and you know the prophet said I listened to clip of of his message this morning and he was talking about we're coming to a Kadesh Baria and you're going to have to drive a stake down really deep and it's going to be an individual stake it's not going to be what our church believes it's going to be what do you you believe and the prophet was saying he said that's what the three Hebrew children did when they were challenge they said I won't go that far period period And there's going to be some periods that you're not going to be able to be some wishy-washy I think God will understand there's going to be some periods let's look at some scriptures just fast I'm just paraphrasing First Kings 18- 21 it says how long halt ye between two opinions First Kings 18:21 1 Kings 18:21 how long halt you between two opinions here here here's God saying you you must decide we got to drive an anchor down deep and the world and the distractions and all the things that's out there this world ain't our home and we really need to lay down our fation and see here we see in Hebrews 12 that was saying that we are compressed about by such a cloud of witnesses you know what it's talking about there when they're writing the Scriptures it was Hebrews 11 and it names all the great the great Heroes of the faith and and I want to I want to lay a foundation and tell you this they never had a perfect sacrifice that was just with lambs and goats they never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they were a lot better believer than brother Dale is they just stepped out in faith and they just blindly believe that someday a perfect sacrifice is coming and me and you have that perfect sacrifice we have it all revealed in the word of God we have we have a Christ Jesus a perfect sacrifice and we have it the word revealed so we can understand it all and do we measure up to them I'm not saying measure up to each other I'm saying measure up to the word of God we're compressed about by such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside all the distractions of leysia who Who Do You Love I titled my message this morning love one word love who Do You Love whoever you love you will not be distracted when I fell in love with my wife it didn't matter if it rained or it snowed it didn't matter if I had money or didn't have money I thought about one thing and that was my bride period I slept thinking bride I woke up thinking bride I dream bride but we're distract brother Dale's distracted God help me God help me God help we need blinders blinders we have so much we're living so far below our privileges speak the word and go forward you know we've preached those messages you don't if you're the baptism if you're Christ revealed in flesh today you don't have to pray and get permission I mean you have to pray and have a relationship of you won't even have the Holy Ghost if you didn't do that Hallelujah Joshua proclaims he said choose you this day whom you will Ser that's Joshua 24:15 we're like choose this is day Paul preached he said quit ye like men and be strong in other words Stand Fast and be of good courage that's First Corinthians 16 and 13 the Bible is saying you're going to have listen all these herrow of faith in Hebrews 11 had to drive down the steak and they said I won't go that far I won't go that far and they didn't have to drive down that steak either I I I know we a't catching the the full comprehension you are not catching the full comprehension that's what our Prophet said and I have the quotes in if I don't get to them you you they're right here on my iPad or or some of them I printed out he said they never had sin taken away from them I'm not comprehending that and I know you aren't it was just covered up hello and we have the baptism of the Holy we literally have a spoonful of Christ in each individual wow God help us here he says the restoration of the brid tree he said they never they' never seen the Holy Ghost they were believing for the the perfect they were looking forward to the promise but they never had never had the Holy Ghost but they believed in a good testimony and if they stopped the mo of lions quenched the the fire and escaped the edge of the sword the women received their dad their dad their their loved ones from the dad without without without a promise It's s a prophec it without a promise and oh but they look forward to under sheep skin under the sacrifice of sheep and that they divorc sin that it could only cover sin but they believed that there was coming a perfect sacrifice and they serve their God that good without the perfect and now we're sitting here with the perfect and we're influenced by the devil and internet and money and we are we are I am I I you shouldn't you know we are you know I if you listen to the news they talk about you know when the money will be gone will be digital currency that affects me maybe it don't affect you something else does the health Minister has already said in Canada that that we need to be wearing masks that's that's a lie of the devil that's ridiculous it's complete scam that affects me I say every time I see some of that I say God take me out of this word I don't I don't even want to be here but see those people lived under persecution and they took their stake and they drove really deep and they never had what you had they never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they never even had a perfect Christ sacrifice so it covered up their sin but it didn't take the desire of the sin completely away oh wow that's what it's talking about in Hebrews we're compressed about with such great cloud of witnesses it's like they did that and we did who really amen God help me God help me he said in an influence message he said when they looked and they they saw God sitting way up high he's talking about John here he said and his train filled the place he's seen he's seeing a real example here's John looking at Christ he said he's seen a real example he saw the one that could put his confidence in in amen hallelujah God help us this is actually sorry this is actually talking about uh the prophet in the Old Testament when he was looking to the king Isaiah and he was he the king everything the king did he was worshiping the king king Uzziah and he said and the King fell and here's Isaiah uh he's a prophet and he stumbled at that and he had to come to God and God showed him a vision he took a cool of fire and touched his lips but he seen a real example you know I'm telling you this morning church we have to focus on a real example let me read you a story that come up and if it's possible some of you maybe have heard this before if said but this when I heard this and I was printing it on my iPad it was all I could do to not cry the way had went on a walk and I was studying and by and this is a testimony of a preacher that and he said when I went to China matter of fact even this week I I listened to a few of the messages in the convention uh over the beginning of the month from yuganda you know some of those Services I just don't understand but some of those Services were like four and a half hours long that I mean there were they were still working been two hours later that would have lost me let me show you the example from China he said when I went to China he said we had service from 8:00 in the morning till 5:00 p.m. and he said there was 22 Believers that came and he said I asked the Believers he said now what happens if we get caught has anybody heard this story thank you brother he said what happens if we get caught and he said well you'll get deported within 12 hours and we'll get three years of prison and he said wow they still count by the way and he said well how many have you been in prisoned for your faith already and 18 out of 22 put their hands on three years in prison for the faith and you're afraid to come to Faith that the government closes it of Co Believers in China aren't which Heaven are they going to the same Heaven as us you know all these other great in Hebrews 12 I'm not making this up all those other great Heroes that our Prophet said were great Heroes disobeyed the government in Hebrews 11 the government said Daniel don't pray period and Daniel didn't just pray but he actually opened his windows and did out loud we're living that it's against the law to preach on the street it's against the law to testify with the speaker you know you know Amplified things what Daniel do not not I'm I'm just saying you like Daniel watch this so they said he said how how many of you believers do you know or are under your ministry there was 22 came to his me 22 and they they looked among themselves he said 20 million 20 million that's with the N million can you think of 20 million people that believe this message in Canada in Canada 20 million and he said and I checked this I actually asked Google the guy in the telling the story he said there's 1.3 billion there's actually 1.4 and a half billion people in China so 20 million said 20 million he said I had 15 Bibles and so there was 22 of them so he said seven were without Bibles and he said so when they got their Bibles I said let's turn to Second Peter chapter 1 and immediately Ely some of the people handed their Bible to the people next door to them and he he said I thought when I was preaching that's weird so he said I went to the after the ones that handed the Bible next door to the on beside or actually actually he did go to them after but he seen when he read the scripture that they recited the whole chapters from memory and he said I went to her after and I said I see you didn't need your Bible because you had it all in your mind can you imagine chapters not verse chapters in their mind he said where in the world did you ever get to recite or memorize chapters of the Bible she said in prison you have much time in prison and she said whoa whoa wait wait wait wait wait but you're not allowed to have a Bible in prison how do you memorize like you I would I would need I would believe me I'd need big print and like flashy letters and a highlighter and everything to memorize and they said oh no no no you're not allowed Bibles in prison but the Believers when they come in they'll write out little verses of the Bible and put it in there hide it and then you will memorize from the piece of paper and you but they'll steal the piece of paper oh he said oh yes they take the piece of paper so she said that's why you're intent on memorizing it as fast as you can before they come and take the paper I'm thinking love live I said so the time came he was there for three days the time came and he was about to leave them and they he said is there something I can pray for you to you know help you bless you before I go and they said you know in your country you're allowed to gather whenever you want as much as you want they said would you please pray that our country would be like your country and the guy said no I will not pray that prayer that sounds radical he says you see here you came on a train for 13 hours on public transit to hear me he said no this don't apply to this church sorry brother Joseph sister my or brother Matt said but here if you have to drive over an hour to church you just don't come think of all the Believers that just don't bother coming to church period he said here you sat all day on a floor for three days and in our country if a minister ministers for more than 40 minutes people would get up and leave he said not only did you sit here for three days but you sat on the floor for three days with no chairs and no air condition here in our country he said if they don't come and the pews aren't padded and the the air condition ain't set at the right temperature they might not leave but they want to come back cuz it's not comfortable he said in our country we have on the average of two Bibles per household or family but nobody reads them but in our your country you have no Bibles and you just copy what you do on a piece of paper and you don't read you memorize chapters of the Bible chapters he said no he said I'll never pray that your country becomes like us love you know before we go in rapture we may feel some of that we got just a little taste of that in a preeminent in our past history how did we do up J deci the prophet said this in the church age message he said I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word of God I wonder that help us let's turn to Hebrews 11 and verse 32 and we'll just read the end of the chapter I'm not reading the whole chapter and even the verse be actually let's read the verse uh verse 31 even before it you can put it up um sorry no let's start at 32 32 and what shall we say then what shall I say what shall I more say the time would fail me to tell you of Gideon and all these people Samson and different people David and Saul and all the prophets who by faith in verse 33 by faith subdued kingdoms WTH righteousness obtained promises and stopped the M the Lions quenched the violence fires escaped the edge of the sword and out of the weakness made strong and waxed the violence in fight turned to fight in the armies of the Allies the women received their dad and raised the life again and others were tormented not esap Escape uh not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had Trials of cruel mockings and scorning yay whosoever bonds and imprison M and they were ston saw a ther and tempted and were slain of the sword and about sheep skins and goat skins being desolate Afflicted and tormented whom this world here's Paul saying whom this world wasn't even worthy of their presence they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves and Earths and all these Haven obtained a good report through faith received not the promise of Christ the Holy Ghost in their day wow and God has gave us so much I wonder are we sufficiently impressed you know see our Prophet said that we are going to live he he even said this that in and the Leo theine Church watch watch what watch what I I I know you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's it's around around outside you so I I I encourage you to build an atmosphere around you watch what you're up against you're living in a Leo I know we're in the bright age if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're in the bright age but in the Bible scripture it goes as far as Le to see in church age and that was the only church age in the Bible where Christ wasn't even allowed in the church now you're up against that anointing I don't mean you've accepted it of course you have it you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you're up against that anointing and then our Prophet comes and he's revealed the word through the the word comes to the prophet the secrets and he's revealed the word and he said in this day with this message of truth that we have we're going to leave an Ephesians Church age again and it's a powerful Church age age we we want to watch how Paul expressed the church age in Ephesians 1 amen and and it was tremendous Church age but they had relaxed at the end and they were not sufficiently impressed to have First Love they had everything else and I believe with all of my and that includes my heart that we're very close this world cannot survive it C it cannot survive I'm not putting a date on I think we just cannot survive you say that's radical Brother D you need to listen to our prophet he was convinced happening his day and that was a lot of things that happened since then but because he was a prophet you could see so there's no it it got so dark in 77 where people misunderstood them he got so black past 77 that a Vindicated God called Prophet scripturally based couldn't even see it was completely black and that's where you are this morning black I don't mean you are black you're in that time frame of black and it behooves us to gird up our loins and check who and what do we love would you be like the three Hebrew children when the king says you know just fall down it's not really a big deal just just you know we we we need to do this and and they say you know we know our God can save us but we're not concerned whether he does or not we're not going there what I want to tell you this morning is they didn't know the end of the story at the beginning uhuh Daniel did not know Daniel did not know there's no copy in the Bible or even our Prophet that said that Daniel knew that when he got dropped in those lights that the atmosphere they wouldn't touch it Daniel didn't know but they had a backbone comes right here from the head down and they said you cross the line let me show you let me show you you know there's so many things here here in the key to the door let me I to a point where where the Prophet said that Satan never changes his tactics and I want to show you how the prophet tempted Jesus he's tempting you the exact same he tempted me the exact same way what watch what he did first off he tried to get Jesus to deny the word I'm G I'm jumping way ahead forgive me he denied the word and then we realized okay now these are believers they actually got the Holy Ghost so they won't deny the word then he tried to make them super religious super spiritual and and go to the like just woo and then when that one happened he tempted him if you don't want to be super extreme on the supernatural side that's what he did that's what our Prophet said we're going to get there then he said well then I'll give you the whole world and you can be the head of it all and our Prophet said he sted in you the same way if he can't get you to leave the word oh like we're we're grounded there okay I'm got you with that then he'll let's let's be super like uh like super messy you know just sloppy like you know what I mean like just like goo like like just super I I I'll I'll explain myself and people would go just right in the ditch of that now we believe in that okay but he was trying to get Jesus go one extreme first to leave the word then to be sloppy in the word and then well if you won't do that then the last one will for sure get you he took him up and he said now all the world mine it was it still is and if you just I I got the power I can give it to you so I can make you a big shot this what the prophet said I make you a pastor I make you a deacon I can make you a king I can make you a ruler I can make people think you're really something big you don't change amen here he says in the message the key to the door he said sin the meaning of sin is Miss the mark you're shooting at a mark with a gun and you miss it that made me think of Jared this this morning Jared shot a shot a Canadian goose in his uh he he got a new gun and he was telling Tim about it I think it was Tim he was telling Tim about it he was he was shooting at this goose and he knew it was off to the one ins side he said he said I didn't want to shoot in its body he said I want because it makes him blow up uh and then they you know they ate him for breakfast uh and he said so I aimed about three inches from the top of its head and he said I just lowered a little bit he said I just cut its neck right off but he said sin is you're aiming at something and you've missed the mark he said you better adjust your gun because something's wrong you've missed the mark and you got to come back and try over again he said it means to turn around you missed the mark and when a Christian wants to be a Christian and you just join a church you've missed the mark amen when you just join an association or a Ministry you've missed the mark Hallelujah God help us God help us and your desire the Lord just laying a foundation the Lord God maybe we don't feel that just that tug of love like we should remember it was their first love they had no distractions when you have your first love you can't think of nothing but he said it's your desire and these things will be done as he said to John thus it behooves us or becoming to fulfill all righteousness he says here so many quotes that the prophet mentioned about being in line and in Mark and and that he you know the prophet told the story about he said he was a tropper and and I don't have this one right in front of me it's probably my iPad but he said you know he said if I wanted to catch a he said he said this what our Prophet said he said Church Believers are like this he said I would draw a hole in a hollow log and he said I would put a tack from my dad's from his dad's uh toaca tack it was a packaging or something and he said it was really shiny and he said I would drill another hole this is in the Harvest Time message he said I would drive another hole so the sunshine would come in and shine on that t and he said the loves a Shiny Toy like Church Believers if I find this quote in my thing I don't want to stop to find it on my he said that would put his hand in that hole and grabbed the tack and he would be there the next day when I come back because he wouldn't let go of the shiny toy he was completely free all you said to do is just let go the world pull his hand up he said Hollywood shines but God glows in Holiness and humility Simplicity amen we're not we're not he Saidi wonder if we've lined up with Hollywood and we've grabed on the shiny toys and we won't let go and he said that would cost saon its life because he was completely free but he wouldn't let go of the world and the distractions of the shinness God help us he said in the Harvest Time also he said the Christian is to reflect Christ it's like the moon reflecting the sun he said it's it's the absolute it's the absolute he said a Believer only reflects the Son of God in the absence of the Son of God he said it's a light of the Bible in the scriptures being Vindicated in our life it's the word that makes the light Darkness Hallelujah that's what Jared and Julie's family will be doing this morning and and Vanessa in in a in a dark denominational world World there be the light reflecting Christ that's what we'll be doing when we go to the grocery store and buy a head of lce to be the Light of Christ reflect you don't think they know oh boys oh boys oh yeah they know amen they must know or our testimony would be Mar Hallelujah God help us at this time you know it's Revelations 2 where it talks about the Ephesians Church age and then uh let's just turn to Ephesians 1:1 and just read that before we go into the temptation of Jesus and and and I know there's just so much you could stop on that but here here in Revelations 2 is is uh John revealing what Christ has done onto him about the the Ephesians Church Age and and they were perfect except they had relaxed at the end and and by by the word of our Prophet that's exactly what we're living in is we're living because we've received the word for our day and the message and the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not in a leot to and church age and yes in a way we're in the bride age but here are a prophet saying you're actually in the Ephesians Church age but you don't want to be like them we don't to end like them we can't end like them the Rapture must happen amen watch how Paul talks to them in Ephesians 1:1 he said Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus Christ by the will of God not the will of men to the Saints which are at Ephesus the faithful in Christ Jesus here Paul's talking about the church they weren't babies they believed the truth they were they were us they were us and their that Hallelujah God help us to not be distracted God help us to not grab something shiny you know when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll you'll be able to discern Christ you can't be part of Christ and not who else is a part of Christ it might take it might take but Satan can't hide forever he couldn't hide from Christ and he can't hide from Christ revealed in flesh today not all that says Lord Lord and not all that says they believe this message will enter in because in the Bible he says that many he would say I don't even know you depart from me you workers of iniquity that's not to say that the message is false that's to say that people are religious and they will compromise Satan is a Slicker he's the shiny toy sitting amongst the church people are grabbing on to and they refuse to let go Hallelujah here let's go to Matthew 4 and we'll look at this temptation of Jesus and we'll just read what our Prophet says about this Hallelujah Matthew Matthew 41 he said when Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he fasted 40 days and 40 nights he afterwards hungered and when The Temper came unto him he said unto him Thou Art the Son of God command these stones to be made bread and here's what the prophet said in and this is the Harvest Time message he said Satan never changes his tactics neither does God it just changes the age or the time Hallelujah so we're under the same influence Hallelujah and he said he tried to give him he tried to give Jesus natural bread just like he did to Eve see Eve the first uh bride fell but the second one would never fall he said if you'll just eat this and take this or something of another he's got it and he said that's what he does to every organization and every individual he tries to give them the natural things that you can look at and take it away from and and it's taken away taking you away from Christ well look at the big churches and why they've got millions in it and the biggest in the city and we got the mayor that goes to our church and we got the all the educated uh you know he mentioned the DDS and the LDS and the phds he said that's just what Satan does the world he's trying to compare don't compare to the things of the world don't compare your church don't compare yourself to the church or the church church is but compare yourself to the word of God to the Bible That's the matter with he said that's the matter with our cets and our singers and so forth he said we've got to tr like Hollywood and Hollywood Glitters but the gospel glows it's a lot different between a glitter and a glow he said glow and humility he said God's humility glows and the believer no matter how arrogant sat Satan is Hallelujah he's offered he wanted God Jesus to leave the word of course we know the scriptures and Jesus answered him he said but it is also written that ye shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and then the devil took him up into a high city SED him on the Pinnacle of the temple and he said unto him if thou if that same Devil's alive and well well if you got the Holy Ghost you'll see it my way he's very healthy cast thyself down for it is written that the angels will give charge concerning thee and they will lay their and hands shall bear thee up unless thou Dash thy foot against the stone he said notice here that Satan failed in his first attempt and his second scheme he said was he he failed in his first one to disbelieve the word so now where you got to be real careful watch this watch what he says here he says he says now you want to be real careful and just sit here another few minutes on this part he said it makes he wants to make you a super natural offer I'm going to come and do all this just before the closing he said no you won't stay away from the word so then I'll give you a supernatural offer and he said I'll tell you what he said you can get up here and you can drive off the temple and bring it back and he said you can show off to the people see God don't show off for nobody amen it'll be a it'll be a private uh you know display you know look at how Christ when he went to the the the pool of bassetta you know there was one that was predestinated to be raised up you know they you know the same devil would say well let's go to the cemetery and raise them up that wasn't the will of God hallelujah for he said boy but they got them here he said now watch he said you watch to the end he said where this temptation comes he said maybe it might be some of you might speak in tongues and you might think you got it or he said you might even prophesy or you might even uh prophesy or interpret it prophecy he said I've seen people stand up and prophesy and contradict the word as far as the East is from the West he said it's the word that you live he said them Supernatural gifts he said Satan can handle them hand them out in handfuls certainly he said that don't mean one thing he said didn't Jesus say many of will come in my name in that day and the Lord will say I prophesied in thy name and all this and he said I never knew thee depart from me the worker of iniquity see Satan's doing the same thing in his church today is he's using distractions and if he can't use the distraction of the world he's using the distraction of the message or Supernatural things to take you off the attention of being focused intently looking onto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith how course here we say here that Jesus said unto him he said it is written again that you shall not tempt the Lord thy God and again the devil taken him to an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them the glory of the earth and he said unto him he said all these things I'll give you I'll make you rich I'll give you a job you never in church I'll give you a job you never even have to think about church if thou will just fall down and worship me Hallelujah a prophet says this he says Satan's third scheme he says we'll get to it quick and he said he's closing his service he says his third scheme was a Temptation and if other if the other ones didn't fail then this one won't you see he offers him a position in the church like he did to Jesus I'll give you the world I'll make you a king or I'll make you something that you'll belong to I'll give you this he said I'll make you a minister he said I'll give you a gift of laying on hands God sent it in the church all these things amen if you'll just worship me just go off the word just take your focus off of Christ and that's what we're living in this day if the Ephesians Church age had the the word for their day and they relaxed at the end and lost their first love history repeats itself when you hear the testimony from people living in China and other countries how are we going to measure up to our love our love of the word I'm not saying that you will measure yourself to a Chinese believer or some of these other people but what about your love for the word choose you this day who you'll serve is it a priority it it you know when you have your first love it it just consumes your whole body I don't believe that most of us are completely consumed we're convinced but are we consumed I wonder God wonders and it really God just spoke to me when brother Isaacson and and brother Jose's last Sunday he talked about living in Ephesians Church age again and seeing how they've relaxed and you just look at how the age that we're living in and look at the fire amongst the Believers wow are we burning up to do his will or are we building our own kingdoms God help us God help us I believe it's a question that we really have to ask because he's coming for a mature bride and he's not going to come for a bride that's distracted by whatever it would be distracted that Satan will use different tactics and and he'll study you to know what you'll fall for if you'll fall for money he'll offer it to you if you'll fall for popularity in a big position he'll offer it to you whatever's important more important in you than Christ Satan will dangle that shiny thing to you and you'll stick your hand in to take it and our Prophet said it was like the charge they wouldn't let go and it cost aun's life amen God gave us his word for our protection Holiness and and these things you know look at look at when the the the the sons of men married the daughters of Satan the prophet said God never forgave them you mixed marriage God never forgave them they never seen the promised land you can't cross the line with God this we're not we're not playing religion we're not we're not building a kingdom not our own and there's things that God's going to say you got to stop the Box stops right there and this same message I kept this quote from last I'm going to shake you I mean God shaking you sure I'm going to read what our Prophet said in the same message harveston that's about a 4our message by the way he covers a lot of hay in that message I mean he actually preaches like three or four messages in one I just took the back half of the message where he talked about the temptation of Jesus but I really believe you know in the past history of our last three or four years we've seen more happen in Canada than I personally Dale langa would have ever believed would ever believe do you know in our country in Canada but there's still ministers in prison you can say oh bless God they don't believe the M careful careful our Prophet said that in our day that ministers will give their life for this word are you willing to are you willing to drive down the state or are you going to bend Under Pressure if you looking for an example look at all the the heroes in Hebrews 11 They're Your Heroes who's your hero today in studying this week you know the prophet said of course we know this whole world is Satan's domain he owns this world 100% don't fall in love with it too much he ain't giving it to you amen this isn't the Harvest Time message right before in December of 64 about an hour before he left and he said he he he in 281 he says he says I'm a Christian what what church do you belong to he said I was born a brandom and he said I've always be a brandom it's talking about your birth Christ you were born in the family of God you were actually born in the family of God before the foundation of the world and John seen you in Christ in the church ages and Revelations but you he had to come and and take back what the what had been robbed from you in your flesh life and redeem you back and he justified you now you watch it Justified you know what the prophet said to that you never really sinned wasn't the real it wasn't you it was this but this ain't me this ain't me Justified as if you never did it in the first place you know the prophet said in studying this week he said he came to redeem back those that were already in him you don't get no better than that he knew the world wouldn't accept him so the ones that were already his he already them he just was well I'm just taking them back W Hallelujah that should just raise you up watch what he says here in 82 he said notice Eve she met uh Eve met her and so did the second Eve met he at Nan Rome and they gave it to the denominational Creeds and accept the dogmas instead of the word now this is in Harvest Time this is right here on the pulpit if anybody wants to read this I advise you to fasten your seat belts he says they've taken down the Pagan Idols like Jupiter and so forth and they put up Idols like Paul and Bernard Barn barus see God remember we preached on the tools God don't expect you to worship the tools this is the prophet of tul telling you don't worship me he said they took down Jupiter and so forth and they put up Paul and barnas and he said they took down the sun gods and and the moon gods and he names some of these and the moon God and around I can't even say the words of them and made her being a mother of the sun god which was Jupiter and they changed the birthday of Jesus I'm I'm reading exactly what your Prophet says and they changed the birthday of Jesus from April to where all nature and so forth where he was born under the ram and cause because he was a ram changed changed that up to the sun God's birthday in a solar there where it makes it one day and there's just one minute difference between the day and when it's passing into the 25th day of December the son God's birthday not the Son of God but the son as you in every one of you play Santa Claus and decorate your trees it's heathenism and things like that and they call themselves Christians what's the matter with you Christian Believers that's paragraph 182 282 oh I don't like that part well he didn't finish there well there'll raise up somebody Among Us who can preach the word and tell the truth and God vindicate and prove it to the people that he's the same yesterday today and forever and you don't need some cemetery and you don't need some theology we need somebody that will stick to the word a prophet that's right and God promised to do it and he said there where Eve failed so Eve failed so did do so did the church and they gave way to their denominational rules of men and they were ruled by men and not controlled by the holy spirit anymore let's stand amen you know as much as our Bible teaches us fivefold Ministry not we're not worshiping the fful ministry we're not worshiping a good pastor or or a bake name church or we're not even worshiping the prophet all these things but look at into Hebrews 122 looking on to Jesus your in your your your complete attitude was to be focused on Christ Christ avoiding all distractions amen love who or what is your love Satan will try to just pull it you know we preached that message just a few months ago about being radical and when if you're not careful Satan knows the word he knows the message and many times when Satan will come to you he'll say preach the message in balance and what he means is compromise that's what he means compromise our Prophet clearly stated strongly stated that Eve was one word one word not one three-letter word not surely die but God said you would surely die and God help us if we're going to believe the truth and we're going to believe the right I've said this years ago I said this when we started the church I said if we're going to look like the church next door let's just go there it'll be easier but the Bible says to be peculiar to stand out not arrogant I don't say arrogant but peculiar humble you and people will look at you and go whoa what is you know we've got so far from the truth that when the truth presents itself people don't even know what it is you know my my my son Brent that's not here in Fellowship right now today yet you know the girls there all wear their skirts and and and he's all over the Internet the things and here here he's out of fellowship with God and he's preaching every day God's got a sense of humor he's preaching every day he thinks he's avoiding God but he's preaching every day justifying the the girls in in California ask them if that was forced on them by dress code they don't even know what a dress is like it's brother can you believe that like like dress listen you dressed up for Halloween you were dressed how did we get that far I'll tell you how we got that far we let down the bars and the goats got in and now how it's been accepted for so long it's been accepted for so long that when you take a stand you're radical you're radical radical a radical Hebrews 11 every one of those Heroes of Faith were hands down radicals radicals and a lot of them that radicals they didn't who told Daniel that he must pray out loud and open the windows God never but he refused to change his lifestyle for a government refuse I refuse let me ask you this if you get caught what happens to us you get deported in 12 hours and I get three years in prison would you have went to church that morning I'll tell you what if you would have went to church that morning you would have been in a lot of prayer that week a lot more prayer than I was in this week this message probably was not for a single person in here but for God help me God help me not to accept the bend so much that when you see something straight you don't even recognize it it's being real anything God valued he hid public show Hollywood we're going to show the world lots of spiritual gifts you don't know God at all he hid the diamonds he hid the gold hid the silver he buried everything he hid Holiness he hid everything and the disciples came to him and said why do you preaching Parables you know I had somebody acquainted with the message and it's not here and you know in you know watch Satan watch Satan I'm closing in Revelations when it says that when the seventh angel begins to sound the Revelation period of God will be finished that Revelation is who God is the anointed one Christ Jesus amen Revelation period the person asked me he said well see we still have more Revelations to come because when that seventh angel came he just revealed just one for the one but you know God has a sense of humor as I looked in the scripture I realized that Jesus said that it was revealed to you and to them it wasn't given said why do you preach in Parables and Mysteries and he says because to them it's not given but unto you to know the Mysteries with an S plurals amen and we've been given so much wow so much God help us we're compressed about by such a cloud of witnesses how will we measure up with the perfect sacrifice and the baptism of the Holy Ghost God help us to put our
