The weather's been We me and Lynn went and got some chairs and where Matt and Abigail are, the weather's much much worse than here and and different ones and but uh we uh we uh want to show you some pictures. We kind of had a a full week this week. And uh God is very good. Amen. I wasn't sure what I was going to do. I actually had a brother offer to come and minister, but um I uh I chose not to. But Vicki, you can show the pictures. This is what happened last Sunday and Sunday evening or Monday. I didn't realize that this was happening when Vicki was showing our quotes last Sunday, but she wasn't feeling well. So, we lost our little grandson. God decided that God is God and he's sovereign. Amen. And we are his bride and his wife. I would have chose to been me a thousand times. I'm an old man and let my family live and enjoy life. But but God is God. Amen. I really believe that when the church comes into perfection and perfect love, we'll feel each other's pain. Amen. And you have to picture if you've been waiting 15 years for your first baby. Amen. Amen. It's his little feet that are walking in heaven now, waiting for his old grandpa to hurry up and get there. Amen. Amen. So, we kind of went from funerals to birthdays this week and it was kind of kind of all over the charts. Amen. We we feel Tim and Vickiy's pain tremendously. And you know, the Bible says we rejoice with them that rejoice and we weep with them that weep. And that's just because we are we are one and we feel if there's somebody homeless in our midst, we're concerned about that person. If there's somebody not eating in our midst, we're concerned. If we're one, we are. If there's somebody that can't pay their hydro bill, we're concerned about that. Amen. We have to be, or we want to. Maybe Vicki, if some are just coming in, so maybe if you don't mind just going through them. Amen. Because that makes us one in Christ. And you know, God is, he's an amazing God because we've been preaching on the feminine side of God. Amen. Which that's what we are. And the feminine side will never have an arrogant spirit. It was never ever the will of God. Amen. Never ever the will of God. So someday I'll meet him. I pray it's sooner than later. Little EMTT James Recman. Amen. Is waiting for Grandpa.

We definitely want to thank all the ones that had uh sent wonderful kind comments and called and and u just very very very special. Um, some had wanted to come by, but most of the family were just kind of uh spending their self time. Amen. Amen. I'm going to read a scripture. Romans, you're you're welcome. You're you're okay to be seated this time. Romans uh 12:16. I'm just I'm going to see what what God uh lets us do. I'm not necessarily going to preach a long message. I'm not sure I I'm uh going to be able to. I really believe what God was ministering was God's will. And I believe he really truly laid it on my heart to minister. And uh I got a taste of that this past week. Be of the same mind one to another. Mind not the high things, but be consc condescend to men of low estate, and be not wise in your own conceit. Be ye of the same mind towards one another. Mind not the high things, but condescend to men of low estate. And be not wise in your own conceit. Lord God, we pray that your will will be completely done &gt;&gt; and this place totally. Lord God, we surrender our vessel to you. We only desire to serve you and please you Lord Jesus this morning. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. God bless you and we desperately love you in Christ Jesus. And thank you for your kindness to us. Amen. And Tim and Vicki, this this word condescend. You know, we we were preaching on the seed of God will always bring the nature of God. And we're going to look into some things that Brother Brandham mentioned about who we are, the feminine side of God. and and uh and you know we've been on this for I it's very unusual for me to to preach multiple messages and I was actually doing my devotions this week in Corinthians and about every chapter of Corinthians Paul was saying something that was what we were preaching on but this condescend means to show feelings of support uh superiority and you know I I want to just say this that and and I've said this every service the message of that we believe of the hour that God graciously sent us through brother Brandham is is the revelation of unsealing the mysteries of the Bible is 100% the truth and I know that there's going to be a bride or a wife or whatever you want to call her in heaven and I know there's going to be servants in heaven I know there'll be 144,000 Jews saved and I know there will be people saved that go through the tribulation But you have no right as the bride of Christ or the wife of Christ to show your spir superiority &gt;&gt; in this world. And majority of message people do &gt;&gt; until you get to the millennium &gt;&gt; and when you sit on the throne and you judge the world then that's when you can show your superior superiority. But until now, you're God's wife &gt;&gt; and you got very little to say about it. &gt;&gt; You know, I was fellowshipping with most looking at most of your kind remarks this week and me and Lanne, and I I sent hard questions to Osman Bartley, and I said, "Osman, we prayed and God never heard us." The Bible says if you you have not because you ask not. We definitely ask. And that what that see God God heard us but he answered in a different way because he's an omnipotent God. And we have no right to show our superiority around what we think people are going to rank in the in the rapture and where they're going to be in heaven and that. It's not the mind of Christ. And I'm going to read what the prophet said. He said it's out of the nature of what God placed in you. He said something this this word uh condescend is a hotty spirit and that as though someone is below your dignity or level of importance. Now, if you listen to somebody like, "I know God's going to have a wife and a bride, but we don't have no right to put people out." Brother Bram said it like this. He said, "You're a fisherman, and you throw the net out, and God throws the things out of the net that God chooses, not the minister." You know, some people eat shrimp, but they're not fish. Some people eat starfish, but they're not fish. Amen. And you know it just it we we are to serve God humbly and reverently and in unbelievable gratitude for what God's surrendered onto oursel this the end of this verse and I want to I want to show you some things our prophet said just to back us up. To be wise in our own conceit, it means an extensive pride in oneself, puffed up and vanity. Well, bless God, I'm not them. That's not of God. &gt;&gt; It's not of God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to show you, but let's let's just let's just get into it for a few minutes here. Here our first quote in the brother M Brown preached the humble yourself. He said the reason the Bible has become such a problem today is because people try to interpret it to a higher type of language. Now let's just go to the next paragraph. And so God humbled himself humbles himself and God is humility. And a man can humble himself is is on his road up. And he that exalts himself is on the road down always. And we must remember that Christianity is not pushing ahead but is trying to go ahead of this fellow. It's not trying to get ahead of this fellow. But that's what the message has become. But stepping back and taking a back seat. You see, trying to let the other person go on. That's Christianity. Humbling yourself. Wow. God help us. God help me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let you know in in all situations, God is God. God's omnipotent. He's he he is the one that chooses. Amen. Watch this here. And I read I did read this one in June 22nd. I I keep track. So I don't Nothing here is new material or I mean it's all new material except this quote here. He said you show me a church that's humble. A real humble not arrogant. A church just sweet humble church. And I'll show you a church that's got the favor and power of God in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. The things it takes is humility. Humbling oursel before God. letting God work through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this this next scripture that we want to look at, 1 Corinthians, and oh boy, Paul ever hit on this and and you know, it's we're going to we're going to minister on it if God allows us down the road. My iPad's acting up down the road if God allows us. But 1 Corinthians 8 and2 brand new scripture we've never read before in this series. If any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth yet as he ought to know. An abandoned man thinkketh he knoweth anything. He knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. you know, and and I I don't I don't mean this I'm not trying to, but I just think that that when we come into the perfect capstone, we need to get away from being I don't know how to say it without but just just preach on ourselves and and not worry about &gt;&gt; just concentrate on am I right, &gt;&gt; not if the person next door is right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and I mentioned this last week, you know, Paul had an infirmity in the flesh because God had given him such enormous revelation &gt;&gt; that God said he wouldn't heal him. He said, "My grace is sufficient for you." Now, God has given us enormal revelation. I wonder if we flaunt it. &gt;&gt; Not everybody does, of course. It just it's just a spirit that is around the area. I want to I want to show you this is a direct quotes to the prophet on messagehub to this exact verse. You might be surprised what the prophet says. So if you look around today and think how the world is in its condition and that great bunch of confusion, the great bunch of nonsense and the world is and dogging in today, I we wonder where it come from, especially especially in church life. Now remember this directly tied to this verse in the message of being that we are Christians, we deal mostly on that. And how could there be so many people with so many different ideas and so many different thoughts and so many different angles to approach the gospel and everyone is claiming that they're perfectly right and the next fellow's wrong. When you see someone's doing that and you're pretty well when you see someone doing that, then you're pretty well on the line. The Bible says if he thinks he knows something, he knows nothing that he ought to know. So, Brother Bram's saying here, if you see somebody that thinks they got everything right, Brother Bram, a quote that's way down. I will read it tomorrow, but brother Bram said in this in this message late quote after the seals I believe it is um I don't have it in front of me right on my screen but he said how do you know that when you get to heaven that how you believe the interpretation of the message won't be a little different than what God intended. &gt;&gt; Now that dare quote will take away your hotty spirit. Now, in this message hub, brother Bram had, I think, five quotes. I put two up here directly connected to our Corinthians verse. Next quote, he said, "Now listen, we're going to say something now that might score you." The prophet's warning the people. He said, "Bless God. I'm the oneness." Hallelujah. And bless God, I'm the assemblies. And glory to God, I'm the church of God and you're this kind and you're that kind. &gt;&gt; You're nothing. As long as you think that, you're nothing. Now, I think if you could put in that quote that you're this kind or you're that kind, maybe you could put in you're this kind of a message believer or you're that kind of a message believer. He he uses all the things. Watch till we finish it. He said, "Then you're nothing." See, your thinking's wrong. As long as you think that, you're nothing. The Bible says that when a man thinks he's some some thinks himself something, he's nothing. Now, this is what Brother Brham says. Listen what brother Dale says. He is nothing that he ought to be. That's exactly right. You think yourself nothing, come down so God can empty yourself out and try to fill yourself up. You're empty. If you try to fill yourself up, you're empty. That's the biggest job for the church and the individual is to empty itself. Well, another word of empty itself would be to be humble. or to not have a hotty spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only us individually can do that. Amen. I really believe only us individually can choose to let God be God. Amen. Here our prophet is talking about the feminine spirit. That's what we are. Brother Brham typed everything in the natural to the spiritual. We were the feminine side of God. We come out of God like Eve came out of Adam was the feminine side. And here, watch what he says here in questions and answers. And I just to clarify, I I put I put three down here, but there was multiple ones that were 64 and 65 after the seals. Same message. And when you see a woman act now, this this quote is a natural quote, but think of it spiritual. When you see a woman acting like a man, she's got out of her place. When you see brother Dale acting like Jehovah God, I'm out of my place. You see in the beginning, see, all right, she's supposed to I think it's a shame that woman has lost their dignity, their feminine place. It's a disgrace. I tell you it is. It is. And you know, I'm going to say this and I know it's talking about you women here. I know it's not talking about you women and and this is the same applies today. This is a message uh this is a grand message for the spirit around us. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm not I'm not talking about in the individual. I mean I'm I'm the woman spiritually speaking. So if I'm preaching I'm preaching to myself. &gt;&gt; But of course if it hurts it just does. But look here. Let me ask you something. It used to be that a woman was so feminine till a man would go talking to them and they would blush. Oh, what is blushing anyhow? I haven't seen it for so long. Won't even know what it is. was if some woman blushed, they haven't got any dignity left anymore. That's all the fine feminine spirit. Now watch this. Now we are the feminine side of God. We come out of the side of God in Genesis 1:26-27. And so and and I know we we are the feminine side of his deity. But until we sit on the throne and judge the world, Wow. We have we should be ministering message ministers should be ministering as to to brother Bram said last week is to throw your arms around everyone. Let God sort it out. &gt;&gt; Every time he brother Bram divine he he he he explained that denominational spirit was to build walls. I got it and you don't. &gt;&gt; I got a revelation that you don't got. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ne quote here he says now I want to put some things this time he said make it something to worship. So his attributes produce this. And when he made a man in a man, he looked lonesome. And now he showed now his great mind. And what had in the picture was Christ and the church. And Christ is our head. And we are the church or we are the bride or we are the wife. You can just call it whatever you are. And when we start acting like the head, we've missed it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we might be the neck and he loves us greatly, but when we become Jehovah, &gt;&gt; we're out of our place. And I and I'm I'm I believe God believes a lot of us are out of our place &gt;&gt; and we're pushing them around. &gt;&gt; You can't push that around. We found that out this week. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If God decides to take your little baby, you can push all you want. He's still God. &gt;&gt; And he took not the different piece of clay, but he made the woman. See, now he's shown this spiritually, but he took it from the side of Adam, the rib, and he took the spirit of Adam, the feminist, and he put it in this rib. And when you see a man that acts there's something wrong. But when you see a woman, that's the church &gt;&gt; that acts like God, a man, there's also something wrong. I'm telling you, there's there's a lot of spirits that are wrong in the ministry in our ranks today. &gt;&gt; God knows it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God God knows it. It's It's the dead truth. &gt;&gt; You can You can ask God for something, but you don't order him to do anything. &gt;&gt; It won't work out so good for you. You see there's something wrong the two different spirits all together but they're together when they make united here. Let's just go to our next one and then we're going to go into a scripture and probably we'll close with this into Acts. He said you're nothing as long as you think you're think that you're nothing. The Bible said that when a man thinks himself something, he's nothing. And he's nothing that he ought to be. That's exactly right. Did I read this one already? &gt;&gt; I don't think I did. If I did, I'm sorry. You think you Now come down and empty yourself. I don't Man, I feel like I did. You're trying to fill yourself up. I'm sorry if I did. I apologize if I did, but the biggest job for the church and the individual is to empty itself. That's rough, but it's good. He said, "And though," I'm positive I didn't read. And though doing this, I was reading a medical journal and I believe it was the Reader's Digest. And now, now watch this. This is our prophet showing us something years ago. how that it's changed the course of life for people. &gt;&gt; It's even perverting men and women. Listen now, if you just jump to spiritual, it's perverted the church that men are becoming more like a woman and women like a man and men are becoming cisified and women are becoming masculine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and that that's the truth physically 100%. But that's the truth spiritually. &gt;&gt; And if it is for those people, they're off. They're really off. You know, I want, you know, and I I want to go to Acts 10, but I want to share something with you because I I I believe and I I've said this for years and and and please, I mean, you can take this for what it's worth, but we're at the end. We are at the end. Brother Brown totally believes he would go in the rapture. That was over 70 years ago. &gt;&gt; We're at the end. And I want to can I show you a type in the natural to the type in the spiritual? And then I want to go into Acts and I want to show where God rebuked Peter. And I'll close on that. And you know that Paul came to Peter. But I want to show you in Acts 10 where Peter gets rebuked by God. And I and this this is not politic. If you if you taking this as political, you're missing it. It doesn't matter what government is in either country. I'm not take I'm talking to the spirits. &gt;&gt; Look at an arrogant spirit in studying this. You can study h history and every kingdom that's fell. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's because of arrogancy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Rome back in the Bible times fell &gt;&gt; because they were cocky. &gt;&gt; And we understand Revelation 13 and the states is Revelation 13. And they'll f they'll force the world to worship the beast that those that our names are not in the lamb's book of life. Now watch this. They will collapse. That's prophecy. because of arrogancy. &gt;&gt; Not because they're not strong, not because they're not wealthy, but it's an arrogant spirit. It don't matter what the president is. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit when you cross the border. &gt;&gt; Watch this. By the very authority &gt;&gt; will be their downfall. Now watch how this has happened. All the Brinks country are countries that the states have invaded and tried to attack. The states is preparing to invade Venezuela. And I'll tell you, &gt;&gt; thus sayaith, brother Dale, it will not go well for them if they do. Because China has 62 billion invested in Venezuela's oil companies. And the smartest engineers of China are in Venezuela pumping the oil. And the states come out and put a tariff on any country that would buy Venezuela oil 25%. And they said, "Well, that's no problem. Russia can buy it all and China will buy it from Russia by the Chinese yen." And he said it will drop the use of the petro dollar which will literally collapse the finances of the states and because the states is putting missiles in Ukraine which is terrible. War is terrible no matter where it is. Remember politics it's not there there's believers in Ukraine that are going to die &gt;&gt; or could die. There's a message churches in Ukraine. Huge message people, &gt;&gt; but there's also message people in Venezuela. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, Russ has sent over two different kinds of their missiles and place them in Venezuela and they can hit every major city in the states from the s southern hemisphere in Venezuela. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the dumbest thing the states could do is show their doineering egotistic &gt;&gt; attitude that we control the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And it'll collapse them. &gt;&gt; It won't collapse because somebody will beat them in war. it'll collapse them because all the countries that that that arrogant spirit is attacking are joining together and they're dealing outside of the states. &gt;&gt; And so they said literally and now this this is politics. I'm going to go back to the Bible. They said literally it's costing the states almost 100 million to park the ships outside of Venezuela. And if they attack, they'll be destroyed because if Russia will attack back and if they don't attack, it'll be a step down that they've surrendered to the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See how the arrogant spirit in the natural. Now watch the arrogant spirit in Peter. Oh, now we're going back to the Bible. Acts 10:13. And there was a voice that came unto Peter, arise and kill and eat. And Peter said, now he's bossing God around now. He said,"Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is uncommon or clean." And God came back and spake unto him again the second time and said, "God has cleansed." What? God has cleansed that not thou common. Now, Peter had forgot that he was the bride of God. &gt;&gt; And he's telling God, "I'll tell you what to do." &gt;&gt; It didn't go so well for Peter. &gt;&gt; You see? See? See the spirit? &gt;&gt; Watch this. Verse 34. Just to to be faster. And Peter opened his mouth and said, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons, but we are." &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking, we are. &gt;&gt; Wasn't many amens in that one. Brother Brandham had people sit on his platform that were baptized in a doctrine he preached against father, son, and holy spirit. &gt;&gt; And he said, &gt;&gt; William Brandham said that they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and that's what it'll take to go in the rapture. Now, you can either believe Brother Brandham or you can believe message preachers that say that's not possible. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter to me which one you believe, but it shows the spirit of doineering &gt;&gt; masculine &gt;&gt; and it's out of place. Verse 35. But let every nation that fearth him, that's God, fearth him, and workketh righteousness is accepted. Whoa. Oh, that can't be is accepted with him. &gt;&gt; But I thought it had to be my way. You see, brother Brham said that the the the rules of lack have changed. Men have become sisified. You can see that in our country especially. But women have become th I in studying this I've watched this. you know that that the average age in the like the 70s or 80s like what they were saying in the other countries but around the world no matter where you go the average age of that like 90% of girls were married was like just say 25. Now at like 45 there's only like 15% married. It's because the dominating spirit &gt;&gt; is a masculine spirit that has invaded the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the woman, &gt;&gt; what happens physically happens spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here in Acts two, and the word which God spake unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, he was the Lord of all. See, God is the Lord of all. &gt;&gt; And you may be his bride, but he hasn't given you the opportunity to start giving orders yet. &gt;&gt; If he had a My little grandson wouldn't have died. &gt;&gt; Let's jump to 44. And while Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word. Oh, and they weren't message believers. And they of the circumcised which believed were astonished. &gt;&gt; And the message believers were astonished that there was people that had the wrong baptism that went in the rapture. And they were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And they were astonished. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Is this Bible? Is this Bible? &gt;&gt; Did I Did I read some message quotes? It's a spirit has changed in the environment in the world in the politics but it's also changed in the church &gt;&gt; cuz Satan is no respector of like the government or the church government or the grocery store or this tabernacle. It's a blanket spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to come into it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but it it's around us. I'm not even saying this church is into it, but it's around the churches. &gt;&gt; Watch verse 47. Now, we I I've been in multiple churches where message people would forbid people that were outside. But watch what it says here. Can any man forbid water that these should be not baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we as well as we yes God has blessed us with the the mysteries of the Bible and the secrets and all this thing but it don't it it we have to fight the arrogance spirit &gt;&gt; because you live in a nice house where you got a heat and radiator and all this. You have to fight the arrogant spirit because you drive a nice there. That's not sinful in itself. It's the arrogant spirit that's sinful. &gt;&gt; You can have all that you have and still be humble. Say, "Oh, God, you've blessed me more than I deserve. Thank you very much for my breast and my house and my food and and I'm obese. I'm obese. I'm taking to myself now. and I eat too much. When when believers will like there will be believers in heaven that will die of starvation. &gt;&gt; You know what the sin is? The arrogant spirit. &gt;&gt; The arrogant spirit. By God's grace, I'm going to try to the best of God's I pray that God will keep our pulpit clean. Keep our capstone clean. We don't need to fellowship with an arrogant spirit. &gt;&gt; That that spirit is disgusting. And now now I just read Acts, but you know very well the story when Paul and Peter met up that Peter was Paul was stood Peter to the face &gt;&gt; and rebuked him because he was a jellyfish &gt;&gt; because he lived double life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just just if if if it's all right. Mark 10. I I I'm not planning on going long, but we're we're in some good food right now. Just I I'll give you some stuff. This honestly, I I pray you hope that this is not brother Dale. I'm fighting with this. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. I was fighting with this on Monday. I went to go get those red chairs on Monday. &gt;&gt; When I got the news, you think I got blessed. &gt;&gt; Mark 10:13. And they brought the young children to him that he should touch them. That's improper. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them, said they should use birth control. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come on me, and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of heaven. And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child." Now, you know, if any of you seen a little child that had an arrogant and was sassing his parents, even though you weren't the parent, you'd want to go, "Woo!" You'd feel like it &gt;&gt; and you'd use great restraints. Keep your hands in your pocket. &gt;&gt; But what about God? &gt;&gt; God's a lot bigger than Brother Dale. Oh, you could barely were specs. &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah. It's the spirit. It's the all these things are pointing at the spirit. And I'm going to tell you ahead of time. First Corinthians is Jehovah. Every chapter Paul mentioned it. &gt;&gt; Every chapter. It was unbelievable. Here, let me just close with I'll read just a few. Maybe we'll get just uh two or three quotes and then we'll close before we get into Corinthians here. In his trip to India, he said, "Don't you see the same arrogant spirit gets among denomination and denies Christians the brotherhood in the same way? And we are the products of God, every one of us. And we should be brothers closely knit together by the gospel." and in our motives and our ideas and everything we should give God for the relief and the furthering of the gospel and to bring together the brotherhood and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Arrogant spirit can never do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Next one. There's many of us and many of us do that in our lives. As soon people as soon as they become Christians. Oh wow. It's a good thing you're sitting down. says, "As soon as you become a message Christian, &gt;&gt; you become arrogant and different." That's right. When they're just taking vice versa versa path and they're going backwards instead of forwards. This is this is brother Brown's preaching. So if you think I'm off, then more of you can get out of yourself. More room you the more you can get out of yourself, the more room you got for the Holy Ghost to come in. As soon as people become Christians, well, bless God, I'm not a sinner. Well, you just were five minutes ago. Well, bless God. I would have never No, but you did something way worse. &gt;&gt; Bless God, my kids would never do that. Oh, be careful. Be very careful. You would not believe how much Brother Brown preached on this. You think I you're going to praise God when I get done this series? So am I. Brother Bram preached on this every way possible. Upside down and sideways. And I'll also tell you, brother Bram's life was not this. He was a Christian. And we are about the father business of the Holy Spirit and getting every soul saved that we can. You know, brother Brandham said, you know, and and and I know I know we got to take people to the the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I know that. I know. Brother Bram said that the the the TV evangelists never took them far enough. I know that. But you know, brother said the only thing in the world that had value in it was saving souls. Do you know that a soul has to be saved before it can get a new birth and baptism of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; But we get sometimes we get so much in the revelation of deity and the seals and whatever that we never preach salvation. &gt;&gt; We just go straight to Holy Ghost. It &gt;&gt; don't work that way. Don't don't go to the grocery store and tell people, you know, God sent a a prophet and and you know, the cloud came down and and you know, he had the Baptist. Like, that's all true, but they're not even saved yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You got the cart ahead of the horse. You got the the horse eat the cows eating grass on top of the tree and the buggies underneath the tree. Why don't you just tell them that Jesus loves you and died for your sins? &gt;&gt; He died for your sins. And then when they get saved, they can move on &gt;&gt; to the fullness of a perfect net. &gt;&gt; Getting every soul saved that we can just on the word or we are if we don't do that or we are and what's that big word and dilatory and arguing our little religious differences, splitting hairs. Such nonsense. No wonder faith is gone. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe for God's chosen ones, whoever they are, we can lay down our splitting hairs, and just come in and feel each other's pain and what they're going through. I'm not saying compromise. I'm didn't say leave. The message is the truth. This is the message. But if the message has brought an arrogant spirit onto any so-called believers, they're not believers. &gt;&gt; Because the revelation and the Holy Spirit, the spirit of Christ, the seed of God, and the nature of God will never bring an arrogant spirit on his wife. It'll never bring a hotty, arrogant spirit because it's out of nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have to be careful when ministers minister the doctrine of the message which is the truth. &gt;&gt; That we give room for people listen to me that can't comprehend it yet. We give room for people that God hasn't showed the re no man showed this to you Simon Barjonah but my father which is in heaven. It won't matter how great a five-fold ministry have or how much the theologians are they cannot reveal the mysteries of God to you. &gt;&gt; It's God that can reveal it to us. I mean, I can explain any a part of it to you upside down. And I've done that to different people and they just look at me like they're staring at a new gate at the fence. Like, &gt;&gt; do you know there was things that you believe in this message, Brother Bram said, it don't take a revelation to understand, &gt;&gt; but there's people that can't understand it. But you if but if you come after that and attack it, it shows that you're not even converted either. &gt;&gt; You don't attack somebody because they're different than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. I I I know God knows this is this this this has to be corrected before we leave this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you know all the other things like last Sunday the ones I showed you positively what our prophet brought. &gt;&gt; I mean this is the message &gt;&gt; but it's been mis it's been mis construed in different ways. Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; God help God help me. &gt;&gt; God help us to catch the spirit of Christ. Grace is still here on the earth. and grace here until God comes back in the it'll even still be here even when Christ comes back in the revelation because he's going to turn his grace to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Yes, they'll suffer for it. But even that is still grace. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See the spirit that wants to ex the spirit that wants to say grace is over is the same spirit that's arrogant saying well I got something you can't have that that's like parents dividing their will. Do you do you know do you know my uncle my uncle did this. He gave the farmland to his sons and give the daughters nothing. They're they're women. That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; But in the spirit realm sometimes people that hang around us, you know, just let God all brother Dale God's trying to say through brother Dale is let God decide who he gives his inheritance to. &gt;&gt; Let God decide who he gives his inheritance to. Not very many cases the kids get to write the inheritance will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. And I I I tell you and I mean if if anybody wondered about this, I would sure give them nicely, but a lot of these places in the message hub, I took two or three out and there was multiple There was multiple ones out. The ones I took out earlier out of Corinthians, I took two. There was like a half a dozen. Some of them right up to 64, 65. Prophet still dealing with the nature change. It's a spirit that's in the world right now. Do you know? Do you know that there's very few countries in the world, there is a few, that it's wrong to have a change in the natural? You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Russia's one of them. &gt;&gt; They put people that they think they're something different. &gt;&gt; At the very least in jail because it ain't natural. &gt;&gt; And the seed of God will you will always have the characteristics of Christ and it was to save your brother even the unsavable. And I'm going to close with this. This is this is this is God tried to save Cain. &gt;&gt; He said if you do like your brother, you will also be saved. &gt;&gt; Wow. It's true. &gt;&gt; And if you came from God, you'll have the same nature. If you're the seed of God, you'll have the same nature as God &gt;&gt; and you won't know it's a cane, but you'll put out all the love and grace that you can to all those people. Say, "Jesus died for you." And if they go that far, then he did a lot more. He actually showed himself, &gt;&gt; man. Let's stand. Amen. God help us. God help me. Amen. Brother Bram clearly taught that the way up with God was the way down. Emptying oursel out. Brother Bram said multiple times in studying this message, he said anytime God had a minister and he gave him just a little bit of blessing and he went out and bought a nice big fancy tuxedo, got a $100 haircut and got all puffed up. God could never speak through him again. &gt;&gt; Because he thought he &gt;&gt; was the God, &gt;&gt; wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; The masculine feminine spirit. And anytime you see it jump, this ain't just physical spiritual. You can see the masculine spirit come in a feminine spirit &gt;&gt; just like that. &gt;&gt; It's not natural. Amen. God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. Amen. Amen. I believe we're going home soon. I really believe that. And if we don't, even if we don't, it's God if we don't go home soon, it's God's grace to the world, waiting for the last seat to come in. And he's relying on you and me, me having the right attitude and the right spirit to to bring that brother in. Maybe it's brother Fred driving back from out west that called me two or three months ago and his membership's over in the Dutch church, been there his whole life with his family and he wanted to send to the Dutch church and close his membership and move it over here and sign a piece of paper that he'd be a member of our church. It don't matter to me that he don't understand that. I'm not gonna go and humiliate and do something. You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; Said, "Fred, you're extremely welcome." &gt;&gt; That's the kind of spirit God's looking for. Amen. God help us. God help us. Wow. Amen. God upon the power that sets me free. be to my according to my the church set to our toe. He is. Yeah. Heat. He is the heat. Father, we have everything. Heat. Heat. Jesus Christ. I love you. Heat. Heat. Jesus Christ is Lord God. We love you today. Lord God, we thank you for your grace and mercy on us, Lord God. Lord, as we we never read the quote that study, Lord God, all the different ones that you sent trials, tribulations to, Lord God, you did it because you had confidence in those people. When you sent trials to Job, you knew that he would stand. When you sent trials to Abraham and told him to go up and kill his son that you had gave him, you knew he would stand. Your prophet told us, Lord God, in this day that when God sends trials and tribulations to us, he don't send them to us because he don't love us. He sends them to us because he's got confidence. I will stand. Thank you Lord God. Thank you Jesus. Lord bless these beautiful people of Jesus Christ of your own blood in your mind before the foundation of the world. that you abundantly bless and take care of them Lord God. They show their friendship and kindness through us Lord God and support your work Lord God. Meet every need we pray. Bless you around the world Lord Jesus we pray. Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you.
