[17:11] morning so we'll let them come
[17:31] the army of judah

[17:36] paralyzed by fear
[17:39] when they heard a mighty multitude
[17:43] was quickly
[17:44] drawing near
[17:47] but as they prayed for deliverance
[17:51] the victory would begin

[18:40] the worshiping

[18:46] what would be
[18:47] in store
[18:50] but when we stand on holy ground
[18:53] our smallest prayer is heard
[18:57] instead of all our circumstances
[19:01] our eyes are on the lord
[19:06] pray on for you who are who the lord is
[19:12] looking for
[19:14] pray on
[19:16] for this we'll tear those mighty
[19:19] strongholds down
[19:21] stay on your knees for this is where the
[19:26] battle is won
[19:29] very soon you'll win the victory
[19:32] prey on
[19:36] when your questions go unanswered
[19:40] and your prayers may seem in pain
[19:44] they don't seem to make a difference
[19:48] they don't seem to make a
[19:51] just rest assured god knows your needs

[30:12] amen
[30:14] amen well i
[30:16] really believe god is just beyond
[30:20] what we can comprehend
[30:22] and uh i hope it i pray my greatest
[30:25] prayer would be that you catch this
[30:28] that god give me and
[30:30] and it might seem like
[30:32] i've it's
[30:33] similar trends
[30:37] i can't preach nothing new
[30:39] the bible is all the same trend
[30:42] it's jesus christ
[30:44] and my thought came on relationships
[30:48] and then i went to
[30:53] investigate
[30:55] and
[30:57] it really showed how a relationship
[31:00] makes you his
[31:03] every relationship you know
[31:06] in a family
[31:07] makes you part of each other and it's
[31:10] it's just
[31:12] it's a
[31:14] man it's just like the song said thank
[31:16] you lord i'm yours
[31:19] just it's just unbelievable
[31:23] i'll just give you a pinch of a preview
[31:27] if you weren't his you never can be his
[31:31] you never can be
[31:34] and
[31:35] and god is trying to show us
[31:38] why things happen
[31:40] even
[31:41] in the church
[31:43] now let me show you what the prophet
[31:44] said
[31:46] and a preview of that is not all israel
[31:49] is israel
[31:51] and you can't be
[31:54] if you aren't
[31:55] it's not possible
[31:58] amen
[31:59] let's do into colossians
[32:02] 1
[32:03] and 26 and i'm going to read these
[32:05] quicker vicky we got to talk but i have
[32:08] literally hundreds of quotes that
[32:10] we got to get so we can put them on the
[32:12] screen
[32:13] because some people don't listen to my
[32:15] chinese and
[32:17] maybe if they could see it they could
[32:19] some people
[32:21] connect more by reading i
[32:23] really i wish they
[32:25] normally when i print off my quotes i
[32:27] erase them off my ipad but i think if i
[32:29] left them on here you could actually put
[32:31] them through the computer i think you
[32:32] could
[32:34] anyway that's
[32:35] a great goal that i would like to change
[32:40] i don't see sis patricia just remember
[32:41] her this morning
[32:43] galatians 20 uh here at 27.
[32:48] even the mystery which has been hidden
[32:51] from the ages
[32:52] and from generations but now has made
[32:55] manifested
[32:57] to you the saints
[32:59] to his saints to whom god would make
[33:02] known
[33:03] what is the riches of his glory
[33:06] of this mystery among the gentiles
[33:09] which is christ in you
[33:13] the hope of glory
[33:15] let's go over to matthew 7
[33:18] and this is a just a fantastic scripture
[33:21] matthew 7 and 21 and we're going to read
[33:24] down to 28
[33:26] matthew 7 and i'm just going to start
[33:27] here and not everyone that saith lord
[33:30] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[33:31] heaven but him that doeth the will
[33:34] of my father
[33:36] which is in heaven
[33:38] and many shall say unto me in that day
[33:40] lord lord have i not prophesied in thy
[33:42] name and in thy name have i not cast out
[33:44] devils and then thy name have i not done
[33:47] many marvelous wonderful works
[33:52] and he will
[33:55] and then will i profess
[33:57] unto them
[34:01] i never knew you
[34:06] yours
[34:08] depart from me
[34:09] ye workers
[34:11] of iniquity
[34:13] that means
[34:15] if you're a christian
[34:17] if you're part of israel and you don't
[34:18] know you you're working iniquities
[34:25] therefore whosoever heareth these
[34:27] sayings of mine and doeth them i will
[34:29] liken him unto a wise man that built the
[34:31] house upon the rock and the rains
[34:34] descended and the floods came the rock
[34:36] of revelation and the winds blew and
[34:37] beat upon the house
[34:39] and it fell not
[34:42] because it was a founded upon the rock
[34:45] revelation
[34:46] amen and everyone
[34:49] that heareth these saints of mine and
[34:50] doeth them not shall be likened unto a
[34:52] foolish man that built his house upon
[34:54] the sand and the reigns descended and
[34:57] the floods came and the winds blew and
[34:59] beat upon that house
[35:01] and it fell and great was the fall
[35:04] thereof now jesus is telling you this
[35:06] parable to try to show you
[35:08] a life story
[35:10] and he said it came to pass that jesus
[35:14] had ended these saints the people
[35:18] were
[35:19] astonished
[35:22] astonished
[35:25] at his
[35:28] doctrine they're still astonished
[35:32] amen
[35:33] hallelujah lord jesus we ask you just
[35:37] well we know you're already here
[35:41] so we
[35:42] we don't ask you to come we thank you
[35:44] for coming
[35:46] we ask you to stay
[35:48] we asked you to reveal unto your people
[35:51] what you showed me little
[35:53] glimpses of
[35:56] in our studies lord jesus and we'll
[35:58] praise you forever
[36:00] for all of eternity in your beautiful
[36:02] name we pray amen god bless you you may
[36:04] have your seats let's turn over to first
[36:06] corinthians 11 and i'm trying to lay a
[36:08] foundation here
[36:10] and this is an amazing paradox this is
[36:13] just it's actually mind-blowing it it
[36:16] it's it's blowing my mind and it's just
[36:19] i it's i want you to catch this
[36:22] revelation
[36:24] our prophet said that everything is
[36:26] built on revelation the
[36:28] our prophet actually said that the
[36:30] reason he was so misunderstood
[36:34] was because of revelation
[36:36] the revelation that christ gave him
[36:39] to bring a message
[36:41] wow it's it's just
[36:44] this i'm telling you this is this is
[36:47] this is
[36:48] christ in his family
[36:51] and it has nothing to do with religion
[36:54] nothing at all
[36:56] hallelujah it's
[36:58] amazing first corinthians 11 we're going
[37:00] to start at 3 and then we're going to
[37:02] jump down to 8.
[37:03] and but i would not have you
[37:06] know that the head of every man is
[37:08] christ and the head of the woman is the
[37:10] man
[37:11] and the head of christ is god now christ
[37:14] is the anointed one
[37:16] and
[37:17] god is a spirit amen and those that
[37:19] worship him must worship in the spirit
[37:22] and truth
[37:23] and let's just drop down to eight and
[37:25] man is not of the woman
[37:28] neither is
[37:31] but the woman of the man just like
[37:35] we are of god
[37:37] god any of us but we are of god
[37:41] you see what i mean and the man is not
[37:43] of the woman but the woman of the man
[37:45] neither was the man created for the
[37:48] woman
[37:50] but the woman
[37:53] for the man i want to show you something
[37:56] you were created
[37:58] for god
[38:00] god was not created because god always
[38:02] was and he's elohim but you
[38:06] were created for god
[38:08] and i'm going to show you some scripture
[38:10] that it's just beautiful
[38:12] hallelujah and for this cause out of a
[38:14] woman to have power over his head
[38:16] because the angels nevertheless neither
[38:18] is a man without the woman neither is
[38:21] god without you
[38:24] god is not made perfect without you
[38:26] because you're part of god so god's
[38:28] incomplete there's always a man

[41:23] thou has given me i give on to them

[41:31] the thoughts that god has
[41:34] towards you
[41:36] a wife ain't supposed to be sad in her
[41:39] castle
[41:40] neither did god intend you to be on
[41:42] earth
[41:43] sad in your castle
[41:46] hallelujah the glory that thou has given
[41:49] me i have given to
[41:51] them
[41:52] and they may be one even as we are one
[41:56] that's
[41:57] that's more than one that's part of each
[42:00] other
[42:01] that's
[42:02] soulmate like
[42:04] husband and wife
[42:06] if you get the right one
[42:08] and i in them endow in me and they may
[42:10] be made perfect in one that the world
[42:13] may know that thou has sent me and has
[42:16] loved them and thou has loved me father
[42:18] i will that thou also
[42:20] whom thou has given me
[42:22] be with me where i am
[42:24] that thou may behold my glory
[42:28] which thou has given me
[42:30] for thou lovest me before
[42:34] he loveth you
[42:38] before
[42:40] the foundation
[42:43] of the world
[42:46] oh
[42:47] that's
[42:48] that's that's almost too much
[42:51] that's just amazing
[42:53] here god here our prophet tells the
[42:55] story
[42:56] in 64 calling jesus on the scene and he
[42:59] says you know
[43:01] you husbands and your wives there's just
[43:03] something about
[43:05] your wife or husband
[43:08] and you can't even figure it
[43:10] out why you love them
[43:15] you know man if you were to marry the
[43:18] and you're the right kind of husband
[43:19] there's a woman in the world that you
[43:20] love
[43:22] like your wife there's no woman
[43:24] and there might be other women that are
[43:25] much fairer there might be other women
[43:27] that are much prettier
[43:28] and so forth but there's something that
[43:30] you really love your wife now there's
[43:33] something in there that you don't even
[43:36] notice you know the bible says this is
[43:38] just so
[43:39] perfect christ
[43:41] the bible says in ephesians 4 it says
[43:43] that no man ever
[43:46] ever
[43:47] hateth his own flesh
[43:50] there wouldn't be many divorces
[43:55] husbands love your wives as even your
[43:59] own flesh
[44:01] and the very next verses and there no
[44:04] man has ever hated
[44:07] his own flesh
[44:09] so god can't hate
[44:12] those that are his
[44:13] hallelujah there's just something that
[44:16] you really love their wife and there's
[44:18] something there that you don't even
[44:19] notice
[44:20] what she looks like
[44:22] you just love her and you don't know why
[44:25] but you're crazy about her you love her
[44:28] the woman
[44:30] the same to her husband and you love
[44:33] that person
[44:34] and you young girls
[44:36] and you young boys
[44:38] and girlfriends and boyfriends
[44:42] if you ever meet the person
[44:45] that's the same as your soul mate
[44:48] you will have a love for that person
[44:51] that's something in there
[44:52] and you don't know why
[44:57] you love them
[45:01] he said that's exactly like genuine
[45:04] faith
[45:06] he said it's a thing about faith that's
[45:08] happening
[45:09] and it's a shadow no matter how you
[45:11] would say contrary no matter what the
[45:13] world would say that you're just the
[45:15] littlest group in town meeting today it
[45:18] will mean nothing to you because you
[45:20] already met
[45:22] the boss
[45:24] hallelujah and reserving of the age
[45:28] our prophet says these words and i might
[45:31] be reading too many quotes but
[45:34] maybe just would skip to a scripture
[45:36] here
[45:37] john 17 or john 15 sorry 18 21
[45:41] and i just want to i want to
[45:44] i i probably am not going to finish
[45:46] this but i'm not going to hurry because
[45:48] it's too good
[45:49] and we'll just pick up wherever we stop
[45:53] and the world hateth ye
[45:55] and ye know not that it hateth me before
[45:58] it hates you you you see the same person
[46:04] the same characteristics
[46:06] spoon for the ocean or the whole ocean
[46:08] same ocean
[46:10] same person
[46:12] and if you were of the world the world
[46:14] would love its own but because you are
[46:17] are you getting not of the world but you
[46:19] have but i have chosen you it had
[46:22] nothing to do with us
[46:24] like weird neutralness
[46:26] but i have chosen you out of the world
[46:29] therefore the world hateth you
[46:32] because you are me
[46:35] remember that the world that i said unto
[46:37] you that the servant is not greater than
[46:40] his lord and if thou persecuteth thou me
[46:45] christ
[46:46] if they persecuted god they will also
[46:49] persecute you because you're not greater
[46:51] than jehovah
[46:53] it was like jehovah said you know the
[46:55] prophet said people misunderstood jesus
[46:57] when when and we're going to read that
[46:59] when jesus gave the definition of who he
[47:02] was jehovah and and all the people get
[47:05] up to leave you know how he chased after
[47:07] them he asked the handful that was there
[47:10] are you going to go also
[47:12] that's how he chased after them
[47:15] and peter said those great revelation
[47:17] words but where would we go
[47:22] that's how god chased after the other
[47:23] ones
[47:27] wow
[47:32] remember the word that i said unto you
[47:35] this uh
[47:37] for if they have kept my sayings they
[47:39] will keep
[47:41] yours also watch see what watch that if
[47:44] they had kept god's sayings
[47:47] they'll keep my sayings too because i'm
[47:49] just repeating what god said in the
[47:51] bible
[47:54] amen
[47:56] they'll keep yours also no no jesus said
[47:58] that by the way
[48:00] but all these things will they do unto
[48:03] you for my name's sake because they know
[48:06] him
[48:08] they know not him
[48:11] that sent me
[48:13] even though they look exactly like you
[48:16] and could sit on your pew
[48:20] i mean i'm going to read you
[48:22] the prophet said things like that
[48:25] i'm not making that up let's go to john
[48:27] also john 6
[48:29] and we're i want to read some you can
[48:31] jump around john 6 would be an amazing
[48:33] chapter to read it's a really long
[48:35] chapter
[48:36] but i want to i want to catch three
[48:38] verses and tell you some history on that
[48:41] john 6 and let's go to uh 4
[48:44] 44 first
[48:47] and no man cometh unto me except the
[48:49] father has sent me
[48:51] draw him
[48:53] so you didn't
[48:54] seek out god
[48:57] god sought out god
[48:59] in you
[49:01] okay
[49:02] which
[49:03] and i will raise him up in the last day
[49:06] now you have
[49:07] is that an amazing hope
[49:09] it don't matter if you die before the
[49:11] resurrection or after the or the rapture
[49:14] before the rapture after the rapture
[49:15] you're going to be raised up the last
[49:16] day if god drawed amongst you
[49:18] now the very proof that you feel part of
[49:21] god is that god
[49:23] there's two proof number one you're
[49:25] drawn to god
[49:26] and then the final proof is you will
[49:29] have the exact same character
[49:32] as god
[49:34] many are called
[49:36] but few have the character
[49:39] many are called but few are chosen to
[49:41] the chosen see you can't come from god
[49:44] and not be a god
[49:46] jesus said that thy own word called thy
[49:49] you gods
[49:51] okay but listen
[49:53] i i find this amazing i'm going to throw
[49:54] this in here this is free
[49:56] but you know many times see
[49:59] parents get married and they have their
[50:01] kids and they look exactly like their
[50:02] parents how's that possible
[50:05] well the same way that you look exactly
[50:07] like god now watch this
[50:10] you do something that god don't do
[50:14] i this just came to me i don't know this
[50:16] morning after i said he said you know
[50:18] parents have kids and they look
[50:20] identical to their kids
[50:22] and they do exactly what you did when
[50:24] you were in my house
[50:26] as kids and you spanked your kids
[50:28] because they did exactly what you did
[50:30] god don't do that
[50:36] some kids didn't learn that on their own
[50:41] no i'm going somewhere with that
[50:44] your kids that do exactly what you did
[50:47] when you were a kid didn't learn that on
[50:49] their own
[50:51] and neither if you came from god and you
[50:54] do exactly what god did you didn't learn
[50:58] that
[50:58] on your own
[51:00] a matter of fact you didn't even learn
[51:02] that in the host of god
[51:05] it brings it to your memory again but
[51:07] you didn't learn it from there
[51:09] it goes way
[51:11] back into the gene pool
[51:14] whoa
[51:15] you know the prophet talked about genes
[51:17] i think 21 times
[51:19] i have this from memory but the last
[51:21] four messages he preached he mentioned
[51:23] it 18 times
[51:25] because god was leaving the scenes he
[51:27] was pulling his prophet i mean god
[51:29] wasn't leaving the scene sorry
[51:30] god was leaving the scenes in the form
[51:32] of a prophet and he wanted to know you
[51:34] are you are me
[51:41] oh church
[51:43] i can't make you any happier than that
[51:49] sorry chris
[51:52] ain't that something
[51:58] 46.
[52:00] so so
[52:02] he's going to raise something the last
[52:03] day and we can't go to god unless he
[52:05] drew us
[52:06] because we're part of god no now watch
[52:08] us i had never seen this verse
[52:12] before
[52:14] no man has seen the father
[52:18] the bible says nobody's seeing god at
[52:19] any time and lived
[52:21] but i've seen god
[52:24] you've seen god i've never seen this
[52:25] before
[52:26] this is as fresh as it gets yesterday
[52:30] save he which is of god
[52:37] if you're of god
[52:39] you've seen the father
[52:41] oh come on church
[52:44] no man has ever seen god
[52:46] but i've seen him because he was my papa
[52:53] no man has ever seen the father save he
[52:56] which is
[52:57] is
[52:58] of god
[52:59] and he has seen
[53:01] god
[53:10] all by day
[53:13] i told you john 6 was a good one
[53:17] 63 now i'm skipping a whole bunch now
[53:19] here's where jesus say you know he talks
[53:21] about the the parable of feeding the is
[53:23] the israelites and the manna from heaven
[53:26] and he said i am the bread from heaven
[53:28] and the disciples
[53:30] the tree people in the church that
[53:31] walked out and of course the religious
[53:33] people the pharisees and that they were
[53:35] they were already gone they had left the
[53:37] split before but they disciple the bible
[53:40] says the disciples murmuring about
[53:42] themselves how how can god be brad sent
[53:44] from heaven like we didn't eat him we
[53:46] ate manna
[53:48] uh-huh they didn't understand them
[53:51] amen and jesus knew they were splitting
[53:54] hairs
[53:55] but i don't but it's all in there if you
[53:57] read it
[53:58] and 63 and it says and the spirit thou
[54:01] quickeneth
[54:04] it's the spirit that quickly this what's
[54:05] god
[54:07] a spirit
[54:08] it's revelation and the spirit question
[54:11] is
[54:12] but this old flesh
[54:16] that knows all the law
[54:19] has all the message memorized
[54:21] it knows how long i came to church it
[54:24] knows who the best ten preachers are it
[54:26] knows
[54:27] all the people that died and went on
[54:29] before us
[54:30] and it knows that you're supposed to do
[54:32] certain things a certain way
[54:34] and it it knows you're supposed to cut
[54:36] the lettuce certain somebody told me
[54:38] they said did you know anything about
[54:39] lattice and cut and lettuce they said
[54:40] what are you talking about they said i
[54:42] didn't think you did
[54:43] you want to believe god's got
[54:45] they said but in the kitchen there were
[54:47] certain people that wanted to let us cut
[54:48] a certain way so i have no clue what
[54:50] you're talking about
[54:51] she said i wondered if you did when you
[54:52] were preaching
[54:54] last sunday
[54:55] prophetess
[54:58] the flesh
[55:00] prophetess
[55:03] nothing
[55:05] nothing
[55:07] that's that's not a lot that's
[55:09] that's nothing
[55:11] and the words that i spake unto you they
[55:13] are spirit
[55:17] and they're life
[55:19] so
[55:23] they're everything the words i speak are
[55:25] everything
[55:28] and the flesh
[55:30] is nothing
[55:33] too bad the person that thought the
[55:34] flesh of jesus was in heaven when the
[55:36] bible says heaven and earth don't flesh
[55:39] don't inherit the kingdom of heaven they
[55:40] need to read this verse too
[55:44] oh it's unbelievable the false doctrines
[55:46] that earth there
[55:48] 65
[55:51] this is at a
[55:52] power we could preach the rest of
[55:55] to the rapture on this one chapter
[55:58] and he said therefore i say unto you
[56:01] that no man can come this is still jesus
[56:03] talking by the way no man can come to me
[56:07] except it was first given to him
[56:11] of the father
[56:13] before the foundation of the world
[56:15] it's not possible
[56:18] for you to be saved
[56:21] but he said
[56:23] let me just jump ahead and i read
[56:25] hundreds of quotes
[56:26] hundreds
[56:28] he said but but but lord
[56:31] i had your spirit fall on me
[56:35] a matter of fact i had to go back and
[56:40] really
[56:41] look at these
[56:42] because the prophet almost went below my
[56:46] it was it was amazing
[56:49] he said but lord i had your spirit fall
[56:51] on me
[56:53] and i sang under the anointing he said i
[56:54] don't doubt that one bit
[56:56] he said but lord i had your spirit
[56:58] following me
[56:59] and i prophesied
[57:01] he's
[57:02] i don't doubt that one bit
[57:04] but lord i had your spirit fall on me
[57:07] and i prayed for the sick and they
[57:09] recovered he said i don't doubt that one
[57:11] day
[57:12] you know what our prophet said
[57:16] you're gonna have to think up on this
[57:18] one for a minute our prophet said
[57:20] are you gonna have the baptism of the
[57:22] holy ghost
[57:25] on the spirit your spirit
[57:28] and go straight to hell
[57:33] your flesh has take smell here
[57:36] feel all these things but the spirit has
[57:38] what the spirit has the i don't just
[57:41] from memory it has
[57:44] and you're going to have the baptism
[57:46] and you know how the prophet says that
[57:47] he said it's not that that goes to
[57:49] heaven it's your soul
[57:55] so if you don't think
[57:58] that
[57:58] it'll be so close
[58:01] that it will deceive
[58:05] this is not me this this is i'm
[58:07] preaching on relationships
[58:10] okay
[58:11] that's where my
[58:13] but god's showing you
[58:16] not to worry
[58:17] about what happens
[58:20] not all the relationships are important
[58:23] relationships
[58:26] it's
[58:26] family relationships
[58:28] we sang the song the end of service i'm
[58:30] so glad i'm a part
[58:32] of
[58:33] if you're the children of abraham
[58:36] you're the same family you might have
[58:38] different parents on earth but you're
[58:39] the same parent it goes it goes on that
[58:42] tree goes back and connects up to god
[58:46] oh
[58:47] and nobody can sit and stay by you
[58:51] that didn't come from that tree
[58:54] they won't be at the family reunion
[58:56] in the millennium
[59:01] even though they believe the message
[59:03] they believe god sent a prophet they
[59:05] have long hair long dresses long tongues
[59:09] and
[59:11] and
[59:18] that's the truth
[59:20] intense they're resuming the eights uh
[59:22] now this is a whole
[59:24] just
[59:25] i it was a coloring book
[59:28] see kids it's all right to color
[59:32] it's going to take a minute
[59:33] but there's a couple things in here
[59:37] and from our studies you'll already
[59:38] learn so much
[59:40] that the revelation
[59:42] is totally
[59:44] misunderstood
[59:48] okay
[59:50] but god can do nothing
[59:52] without revelation
[59:54] but with revelation
[59:57] they get up and leave
[1:00:01] i think that means we're going to be
[1:00:03] pretty small for a long time
[1:00:07] it
[1:00:08] it's not because we don't like people
[1:00:11] let me go on
[1:00:12] because we have formally known
[1:00:15] because we have formally known now this
[1:00:16] is wrong teaching the the prophet talked
[1:00:19] about wrong teaching he says you know in
[1:00:21] north america we teach that if you want
[1:00:23] to get healed you have to have laying on
[1:00:24] a hand
[1:00:25] and and we i learned this in if somebody
[1:00:27] wants to listen to the message he said
[1:00:28] that day at calvary it's about a 60
[1:00:31] it's in the 60s that day at calvary i i
[1:00:34] have about
[1:00:35] six pages from that message
[1:00:37] that day caliber that's a great message
[1:00:39] to listen to the day of calvary and he
[1:00:42] said you know when i go to africa
[1:00:44] and one person would get healed the
[1:00:46] whole 10 000 people would get healed
[1:00:48] not north america no way
[1:00:51] no way every 10 000 person wants to come
[1:00:53] up stand in front of me have them read
[1:00:55] their life story and then hold their
[1:00:57] hands on them
[1:00:59] so they gotta they gotta like
[1:01:01] like seeing god wasn't enough they gotta
[1:01:04] like
[1:01:05] smell his clone and touch them
[1:01:11] zero faith and bad teachings
[1:01:16] amen you know why
[1:01:18] it's just wow
[1:01:20] you know we believe in noise
[1:01:22] we believe worship worship you
[1:01:26] unless
[1:01:28] i stand to be corrected but i don't
[1:01:30] believe you can worship quietly
[1:01:33] but everything else can be quiet
[1:01:35] and what god's doing right now is quiet
[1:01:39] i i i actually i was going to say
[1:01:41] something's almost false but like i've
[1:01:43] never heard of wheat field in the
[1:01:44] natural
[1:01:46] right before the combine comes and it's
[1:01:48] dry
[1:01:49] and you can hear it drying
[1:01:52] now i have heard tree foil because it
[1:01:54] pops when it gets dry
[1:02:02] but our prophet said the only thing left
[1:02:04] for us to do
[1:02:06] i love this you see it don't have
[1:02:08] nothing to do with us pentecostal people
[1:02:10] hate this
[1:02:12] and the reason they hate it is they're
[1:02:13] in the flesh
[1:02:15] now i like being in the flesh but it
[1:02:17] don't have nothing to do with my flesh
[1:02:20] if god makes my flesh happy i'll be
[1:02:22] happy
[1:02:23] but see your pentecostal you think
[1:02:26] you're
[1:02:27] gonna
[1:02:28] really do something
[1:02:30] god don't need you
[1:02:32] but he does need you see god can do
[1:02:35] things silently
[1:02:37] i think the prophet said he said god
[1:02:39] sucks more water off the earth without a
[1:02:42] speck of sound than you can pump on a
[1:02:44] hundred wells crickety crocketty chrome
[1:02:49] just
[1:02:51] where was it where'd it go
[1:02:54] where's god where to go
[1:02:58] he tells the story of the wagon
[1:03:01] you know anybody's a farmer he said you
[1:03:02] know i'm back to lane to pick up wagon
[1:03:05] he said it was clearly clinging to the
[1:03:06] blind everything
[1:03:08] he went back and i put all the good
[1:03:10] fruits on
[1:03:11] of god like the five-fold ministry
[1:03:14] i say that because nobody likes to fight
[1:03:16] for ministry
[1:03:18] bless god we can stay home and listen to
[1:03:20] tapes
[1:03:21] the prophets are a pastor
[1:03:26] oh you illegitimate
[1:03:29] ignorant
[1:03:30] deceived person
[1:03:33] and he said after i put the good gifts
[1:03:35] that god gave to the church on the wagon
[1:03:37] he said i come up the exact same lane
[1:03:39] and hit the exact same bumps
[1:03:42] and don't make no sound at all
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:47] he said we're formally known that the
[1:03:49] church spoken of and spoken to in this
[1:03:54] book does not refer to the pure
[1:03:58] what was that word he said this morning
[1:04:00] ecclesiastical
[1:04:03] the elect the body of christ
[1:04:05] so
[1:04:06] a lot of the teaching that talks about
[1:04:08] the church of god
[1:04:12] the spoken of the book does not refer to
[1:04:14] the pure
[1:04:16] ecclesical
[1:04:18] or the elect of god the body of christ
[1:04:20] the bride
[1:04:23] but it speaks of the entire body of
[1:04:25] people who are called christians whether
[1:04:28] they and i'm reading by the way
[1:04:31] so you can get really mad but this is
[1:04:34] from a vindicated prophet
[1:04:37] whether they be true or merely nominal
[1:04:44] i thought christians were christians
[1:04:47] you know the prophet preached some of
[1:04:48] his earlier message and they would ask
[1:04:50] people they said are you a christian
[1:04:51] they said well i'm a baptist and he said
[1:04:53] i asked you if you were a baptist are
[1:04:54] you a christian he said why are you a
[1:04:55] christian no i'm a pentecostal are you
[1:04:57] chris no i'm the brethren
[1:04:59] he said well
[1:05:01] you know are you christian but okay now
[1:05:03] we've moved forward in progressive
[1:05:05] revelation now i want to ask you are you
[1:05:07] a christian
[1:05:09] well there's even two kinds of them
[1:05:16] we're on to something good
[1:05:18] i say pursue it
[1:05:20] okay whether they be true or merely
[1:05:24] nominal
[1:05:26] as all of israel is not and it's in
[1:05:29] capital letters
[1:05:31] israel
[1:05:32] so are all christians
[1:05:34] are
[1:05:34] not in capital letters
[1:05:38] christians
[1:05:42] and you were getting upset because you
[1:05:44] thought you had done something wrong
[1:05:46] it had nothing to do with what your
[1:05:48] flesh did or how you cut the lettuce or
[1:05:50] what you said or nothing it was your
[1:05:52] birth way back to the foundation of the
[1:05:54] world and god never asked you about that
[1:05:58] ain't that amazing
[1:06:00] i don't know one person that was ever
[1:06:02] born that asked about the birth
[1:06:05] you see
[1:06:06] that was god's decision
[1:06:09] did we read god chose
[1:06:11] god
[1:06:13] so
[1:06:16] so just let her go
[1:06:20] huh
[1:06:25] so all christians are not christians
[1:06:27] thus we learned that the church is made
[1:06:29] up of two minds the true mind and the
[1:06:31] false mind which we've referred that in
[1:06:33] the scripture before and the two minds
[1:06:35] are
[1:06:36] motivated
[1:06:38] by two kinds of spirits
[1:06:41] i say we should listen to this
[1:06:44] and one has the holy spirit
[1:06:47] wait wait i want to show you this those
[1:06:50] people
[1:06:52] are sitting in
[1:06:56] message churches
[1:06:57] now there's none sitting in here because
[1:06:59] we've cleaned out
[1:07:03] i'm serious
[1:07:06] well i tell you what
[1:07:09] well
[1:07:10] the prophet said he could tell by the
[1:07:12] fives coming back to him
[1:07:15] i'm not the prophet in that sense
[1:07:19] but i can tell who's enjoying the word
[1:07:23] okay is that fair
[1:07:26] it's fair to me amen
[1:07:29] but two kinds of spirit one is the holy
[1:07:30] spirit while the other one is enduring
[1:07:34] with the spirit of antichrist
[1:07:38] you mean antichrist wears a suit and tie
[1:07:41] and has the chokes your throat by the
[1:07:43] way and has a long hair and a long dress
[1:07:47] and long tongue
[1:07:49] and
[1:07:52] yup yup
[1:07:55] no no this is available to all who want
[1:07:57] to read it after
[1:08:00] you know
[1:08:02] both claim watches both claim to know
[1:08:05] god to be to to know
[1:08:08] and to be known of god
[1:08:12] both claim to know and to be known
[1:08:16] of god
[1:08:19] we're together
[1:08:23] both
[1:08:25] purpose
[1:08:29] purport thank you honey
[1:08:32] purport now what's for part b
[1:08:35] anybody know
[1:08:36] i'll help you purport means
[1:08:39] to appear
[1:08:42] or claim
[1:08:44] to to
[1:08:46] appear or to claim
[1:08:48] to be
[1:08:50] see they they appear
[1:08:53] to be christian
[1:08:54] or bright they claim to be bride
[1:08:59] or something
[1:09:01] especially
[1:09:03] you should listen falsely
[1:09:07] professing
[1:09:09] see professing to be bride falsely
[1:09:17] wow
[1:09:20] now this is a paraphrase
[1:09:23] from google
[1:09:24] that answers what this purport
[1:09:27] report means
[1:09:28] she is not the person she purports to be
[1:09:35] and you felt bad that they left
[1:09:39] well did you want to have fellowship
[1:09:41] with satan
[1:09:45] said the spirit of antichrist somebody's
[1:09:46] at the door too you want to check
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:51] that means
[1:09:54] whoa
[1:09:57] spirit of christ
[1:10:01] amazing
[1:10:03] both believe
[1:10:05] certain very basic truths
[1:10:08] and the difference
[1:10:10] and difference on others
[1:10:12] but since both bear the name of the lord
[1:10:15] god's bride
[1:10:19] follow me
[1:10:21] we feel bad when they
[1:10:23] you don't have to
[1:10:26] now god never
[1:10:34] see you thought you were supposed to be
[1:10:35] sad
[1:10:37] that to be sad is to be upset that god
[1:10:40] did god bless you to be sad that god
[1:10:42] picked the wrong family
[1:10:46] man it was god that for new you before
[1:10:48] the foundation of the world
[1:10:50] it's beautiful
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:54] purport so they both purport
[1:10:58] or speak to god they both tell you and
[1:11:00] they act like their bride but they're
[1:11:03] not both pride
[1:11:11] they both believe most of what we
[1:11:13] believe the same
[1:11:16] but since both bear the name of the lord
[1:11:18] being called christians
[1:11:20] and by such a name bearing the obvious
[1:11:23] claim watch you so now we're getting to
[1:11:25] the good part
[1:11:27] of relationship
[1:11:31] it's impossible
[1:11:34] to have a relationship with god
[1:11:36] if you didn't come from god
[1:11:38] it's not possible
[1:11:41] you can't have a relationship
[1:11:44] with somebody you're not part of
[1:11:46] and and i'm gonna go farther with that
[1:11:48] one and god never intended for people
[1:11:53] to have an intimacy relationship with
[1:11:55] somebody that is not their soul mate
[1:11:59] that's why god introduced marriage
[1:12:05] and that's why god said in the
[1:12:06] millennium that your wife would be with
[1:12:09] you and if you got the wrong one on
[1:12:10] earth you would have the right one there
[1:12:12] because god makes all wrongs right
[1:12:16] now that's just what our prophet said
[1:12:20] oh buddy because see she is we are him
[1:12:24] and she is
[1:12:30] what's
[1:12:31] what god has put together
[1:12:37] spiritually
[1:12:38] you thought i was talking about the
[1:12:39] flesh
[1:12:41] what god put together what god put in
[1:12:44] his family
[1:12:46] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:48] through predestination oh church
[1:12:51] it's beautiful
[1:12:53] it's beautiful
[1:13:01] they bear the claim of relationship to
[1:13:03] him
[1:13:04] and god oh wow wow
[1:13:07] i didn't even i must have read that
[1:13:09] yesterday
[1:13:11] and in brackets it says and god calls it
[1:13:13] marriage
[1:13:15] now do you think god married somebody
[1:13:17] that wasn't his
[1:13:18] that would make him
[1:13:20] ah no no
[1:13:22] never happened
[1:13:23] and god now holds them both responsible
[1:13:26] to him therefore he speaks to each now
[1:13:29] further we learn that the two minds grow
[1:13:31] side by side until the end age and both
[1:13:33] would come to maturity that's why it's
[1:13:36] so obvious in our age we're blessed for
[1:13:37] that and both come to maturity and both
[1:13:40] come to the harvest and the true false
[1:13:43] mind would not overcome watches
[1:13:46] the false mind the false truth will not
[1:13:49] overcome the real mind but neither will
[1:13:56] the vindicated word of god
[1:13:59] from the word of our absolute and an
[1:14:02] absolute message
[1:14:04] from a prophet
[1:14:05] ever change
[1:14:08] the deity
[1:14:10] of the gene of god
[1:14:12] it'll never happen
[1:14:15] it says neither will the true mind ever
[1:14:18] be able to bring the false vine into a
[1:14:21] saving relationship with jesus christ
[1:14:26] wow
[1:14:27] and you were feeling bad about it
[1:14:35] wow
[1:14:40] does this give anybody
[1:14:43] peace
[1:14:43] relation does this
[1:14:45] this help you understand
[1:14:47] all the whys
[1:14:49] it helps me understand
[1:14:52] but why they seem to be such nice people
[1:14:58] and we learned the most amazing truth
[1:14:59] that the holy spirit could
[1:15:01] could and would fall watches could and
[1:15:04] would fall upon the ungenerated false
[1:15:07] fine christians and manifest powerful
[1:15:10] and various signs and wonders
[1:15:13] see you thought they were really god's
[1:15:15] pride
[1:15:18] this is just amazing to me
[1:15:21] even
[1:15:22] judas was identified in the ministry of
[1:15:26] the holy ghost
[1:15:27] through him
[1:15:28] himself and was pronounced
[1:15:34] a devil
[1:15:37] and he sat in the message church
[1:15:40] prayed for the sick
[1:15:42] prophesied and all those things that the
[1:15:44] pentecostal people wanted to see he did
[1:15:46] it
[1:15:49] whoa
[1:15:59] these same principles
[1:16:01] in mind we start to trace through the
[1:16:04] whole church in the various seven ages
[1:16:10] see
[1:16:13] wow
[1:16:14] preaching you just throw out the net
[1:16:18] and god does the rest
[1:16:22] it's god that won't lose any that were
[1:16:24] in his hand
[1:16:26] it's god's family see how the
[1:16:28] relationship
[1:16:31] you see we're going
[1:16:33] the prophet said that we're in this
[1:16:35] serious hour and the word it i have it
[1:16:39] here in sing but i'm just preaching from
[1:16:41] the noise the word is becoming life
[1:16:45] it's it's changing
[1:16:47] it's coming alive you're you're going
[1:16:50] into the veil
[1:16:52] and you're having intimacy
[1:16:54] with who you are
[1:16:56] jehovah
[1:16:58] and
[1:17:00] those that aren't a part of that
[1:17:02] will never go behind that veil
[1:17:07] and you thought it was your fault
[1:17:14] you see god would that none would be
[1:17:16] lost and we're definitely not judges the
[1:17:18] bible tells us not to judge don't judge
[1:17:21] unless we be judged
[1:17:24] but god through predestination
[1:17:26] omnipotent meant he knew the beginning
[1:17:29] from the end
[1:17:31] wow
[1:17:32] modern events made clear by prophecy we
[1:17:34] see this in in in the beautiful uh scene
[1:17:38] of technology uh you can go to the
[1:17:41] scripture
[1:17:42] in messy tub and you can get all the
[1:17:44] quotes that the prophet says about every
[1:17:47] verse
[1:17:49] now we read matthew 7
[1:17:51] 23
[1:17:52] i think the prophet had well right it
[1:17:54] has right there he had 69 comments
[1:17:58] to one verse
[1:18:00] now if i read all them comments we'd be
[1:18:03] on this series for a few days
[1:18:05] amen but modern events made clear by
[1:18:07] pharisees he said you find people and
[1:18:08] many people can't believe that even
[1:18:11] spirit-filled people and i'm going to
[1:18:13] give you something that'll choke you
[1:18:16] that the baptism the holy ghost don't
[1:18:18] mean
[1:18:20] you're going in
[1:18:23] now the bible says you have to be born
[1:18:24] again
[1:18:26] your soul
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:31] now the prophet says that this is going
[1:18:33] to choke you
[1:18:34] not at all he said not on that don't
[1:18:37] have anything to do
[1:18:39] with your soul that's the baptism see
[1:18:42] here's the inside soul in here and that
[1:18:46] has to come
[1:18:49] for you to be there
[1:18:51] that inside soul
[1:18:52] that had to come
[1:18:55] from god
[1:18:57] you ain't never going back to god
[1:19:00] if you didn't come from god
[1:19:02] no man has said in john 3 13 no man
[1:19:04] ascended up to heaven but first he came
[1:19:06] down from heaven even the son of man
[1:19:07] that's in heaven right now and he was
[1:19:09] talking on the ground
[1:19:11] that's got to be one of my most favorite
[1:19:13] scriptures
[1:19:15] amen but then on the outside of you you
[1:19:17] have five senses the five inlets to
[1:19:20] contact your earthly home inside you
[1:19:22] have the spirit and there is five
[1:19:24] outlets conscience love
[1:19:27] uh with genuine spirit of god
[1:19:32] conscious love and so forth the five
[1:19:34] outlets to your spirit
[1:19:36] and remember in that spirit
[1:19:39] you can be bapti have the genuine
[1:19:42] baptism of the spirit of god
[1:19:45] and still
[1:19:50] be lost
[1:19:53] wow
[1:19:57] it's the soul
[1:19:59] that lives and it's the soul
[1:20:02] that's ordained
[1:20:04] of god that's a 65 quote that's 12
[1:20:08] months that's that's two weeks before he
[1:20:10] died
[1:20:11] that's where the word was becoming life
[1:20:14] and god was going to get a message out
[1:20:17] right before he was gone
[1:20:21] a lot of things changed
[1:20:24] a lot of things changed
[1:20:26] and in people's three-pound brain they
[1:20:28] cannot comprehend
[1:20:31] jehovah
[1:20:33] and i can't either
[1:20:35] you thought you were going to say i
[1:20:36] could
[1:20:39] only by revelation
[1:20:44] that's amazing grace
[1:20:47] wow in jehovah jireh 64
[1:20:51] part 1. he said and that's the way it is
[1:20:53] in any life it takes god it isn't that
[1:20:56] you do
[1:20:58] it's what god does
[1:21:01] you say
[1:21:02] i sought god
[1:21:03] i sought god i'm a great person he said
[1:21:06] you're
[1:21:07] mistaken
[1:21:09] no man seeks god but god seeks men and
[1:21:12] it's not seeking god it's god seeking
[1:21:14] you jesus said i you haven't chosen me
[1:21:17] but i have chosen you and you were
[1:21:19] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:21:21] world and it wasn't chosen or you wasn't
[1:21:24] chosen
[1:21:26] at all
[1:21:30] he just come to redeem
[1:21:33] those names
[1:21:35] that were already predestinated
[1:21:38] ain't that beautiful
[1:21:40] but see the power of god was so great it
[1:21:43] affected ones
[1:21:45] that were not predestinated
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] it's it's it's not our fault it's not
[1:21:53] it's not even god's fault it's just god
[1:21:56] knew
[1:21:58] who were part of him
[1:22:01] you can't explain it
[1:22:03] let's go back to the quote where he
[1:22:05] talks about your wife if you got your
[1:22:07] soul mate
[1:22:08] you don't know why you love her
[1:22:16] tell you what he talks to young boys and
[1:22:18] young girls
[1:22:20] and parents you need to be
[1:22:22] wise on this and even you were listening
[1:22:24] to minister friday night and and part of
[1:22:26] it was right and part of it was
[1:22:28] you know our prophet said
[1:22:30] that you should always encourage your
[1:22:31] daughters to marry young of course there
[1:22:33] has to be somebody
[1:22:35] but it has to be their soulmate
[1:22:38] and you wouldn't want them to marry r r
[1:22:41] if they weren't ready or it wasn't their
[1:22:43] soul mate of course not you never marry
[1:22:45] a non-believer you might as well be a
[1:22:47] non-believer if it ain't your soul mate
[1:22:48] because it'll be hell on earth because
[1:22:50] it ain't part of you but when you see
[1:22:52] the part of you
[1:22:54] you'll never be able to explain it
[1:22:57] it'll just be wow
[1:23:02] huh
[1:23:03] and when you see god you'll never be
[1:23:07] able to explain it to the 70 that get up
[1:23:09] and walked out it'll just be wow
[1:23:15] won't it
[1:23:17] you say and jesus said well are you 12
[1:23:20] going to go toe
[1:23:21] and it's just like
[1:23:23] wow
[1:23:29] and all the 70 that walked out which was
[1:23:31] the large majority there were going
[1:23:40] revelation was our prophecy
[1:23:42] the number one reason that he was
[1:23:44] misunderstood
[1:23:47] was because of
[1:23:50] prevalence
[1:23:54] oh church
[1:23:57] jared started singing that song this
[1:23:59] morning
[1:24:00] oh buddy
[1:24:03] i'm so glad on
[1:24:05] your smart
[1:24:08] i'm so glad i'm
[1:24:12] all your tender mercy
[1:24:16] let's follow this old boy
[1:24:19] i'm so glad you found me after you sent
[1:24:22] me oath
[1:24:23] to prove to lucifer
[1:24:25] that in this last day of laodicean with
[1:24:28] corruption and rich and increased with
[1:24:30] goods and don't need god no matter what
[1:24:34] health care and government care and
[1:24:43] i'm so glad
[1:24:47] that you found me
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:53] oh wow
[1:24:56] so glad you found me
[1:24:58] and made me yours
[1:25:02] sorry mama
[1:25:04] oh it's amazing church
[1:25:10] jesus said
[1:25:13] those names that are not on the lamb's
[1:25:15] book of life
[1:25:17] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:20] they're not going to be there
[1:25:23] the ones that aren't on the limbs it
[1:25:25] don't matter
[1:25:26] if you wear your dress below your ankles
[1:25:29] it won't matter if you grow your hair
[1:25:31] until it drags and drags on the ground
[1:25:33] three feet behind you
[1:25:35] it won't matter if you go to church 75
[1:25:38] times a week
[1:25:40] you know i wanted to show you something
[1:25:41] and and of course we believe in holiness
[1:25:43] because the bible says no man
[1:25:46] will see god without holiness i wanted
[1:25:47] to show you something that'll make you
[1:25:49] just in the middle of this i was going
[1:25:51] to read it earlier it'll make you i
[1:25:53] wanted to make you think
[1:25:55] about holiness
[1:25:56] so god there's things that god intended
[1:25:59] us to do
[1:26:01] and they won't be la
[1:26:04] if you're married
[1:26:06] they won't be low oh no no
[1:26:09] no oh man
[1:26:11] i think next week we're going to get
[1:26:12] into the
[1:26:14] you say well how do i know
[1:26:17] whether he knows me or not
[1:26:21] there's a way
[1:26:25] how do i know
[1:26:28] like now these these were christians
[1:26:30] believers they got to have it
[1:26:32] and they're expecting to go into their
[1:26:34] message believers they're following the
[1:26:36] message of the prophet
[1:26:37] and they're expected to go into heaven
[1:26:40] and jesus says
[1:26:42] i don't know you
[1:26:43] depart from me your worker of iniquity
[1:26:45] now can you imagine
[1:26:48] the look
[1:26:50] that would fall on their faces
[1:26:55] stunned
[1:26:58] sheer
[1:27:00] white ghosts
[1:27:03] stunned
[1:27:04] eternally
[1:27:07] lost
[1:27:09] and they thought
[1:27:12] they were okay
[1:27:14] do you know how you there is a way to
[1:27:16] know
[1:27:20] you'll be in a relationship number one
[1:27:24] it'll be a
[1:27:26] let me rephrase that
[1:27:27] the woman
[1:27:29] was made for the man
[1:27:32] god created us
[1:27:34] for himself
[1:27:38] it'll be passionate
[1:27:42] it'll be passionate
[1:27:44] number one
[1:27:45] your love will not have grown
[1:27:47] cold
[1:27:49] it won't be like the sabbath church age
[1:27:52] where god spews you out of your mouth
[1:27:54] because he ain't doing that to his pride
[1:27:55] it'll be passionate but there's
[1:27:57] something else
[1:27:58] see back in genesis the blood was pure
[1:28:03] and abraham married his half-sister
[1:28:06] okay
[1:28:08] you can marry
[1:28:10] you know we go today we go
[1:28:14] brothers and sisters getting married
[1:28:16] that's just wrong
[1:28:18] but in genesis
[1:28:20] it was raped from the creation
[1:28:22] and it was pure
[1:28:27] what's god doing
[1:28:31] you came from god
[1:28:33] but he's marrying you
[1:28:37] okay so yes
[1:28:39] you're going to go in behind the inner
[1:28:40] bell
[1:28:41] and you're going to have an intimacy
[1:28:43] relationship with god
[1:28:45] yes oh i believe that with all of my
[1:28:48] heart
[1:28:49] but even before then
[1:28:52] now watches
[1:28:53] even before you knew everything you know
[1:28:56] now
[1:28:58] you will still just oh i'm glad you're
[1:29:01] gonna ask you would still display
[1:29:04] the characteristics
[1:29:07] of your daddy
[1:29:10] curtis
[1:29:11] looks identical to jared
[1:29:14] 33 years ago
[1:29:17] identical
[1:29:18] it's like reincarnation
[1:29:24] and you
[1:29:26] look identical
[1:29:29] to your daddy
[1:29:31] before the foundation of the world
[1:29:34] and you say what but how do
[1:29:40] oh oh there's there's a way there's a
[1:29:42] way the bible says
[1:29:46] that our pr what and the bible says and
[1:29:49] our prophet said
[1:29:51] oh that
[1:29:53] i'm telling you
[1:29:55] god is just unbelievable you know i just
[1:29:57] had like one word god just one word
[1:30:00] and i just went in and just it was just
[1:30:02] like
[1:30:03] i could have printed off 300 papers
[1:30:06] it was unbelievable
[1:30:08] it was just it was just unbelievable
[1:30:10] i was just like
[1:30:13] man
[1:30:17] our prophet said
[1:30:19] jesus
[1:30:20] was jehovah
[1:30:24] and he
[1:30:25] was a lamb led to the slaughter
[1:30:28] for me and for you to redeem the names
[1:30:31] that
[1:30:31] were part of him
[1:30:34] and he didn't even consider
[1:30:37] that he was paying a big price
[1:30:40] it was it was not even
[1:30:42] amen not not the real jesus
[1:30:45] oh the flesh didn't want to die
[1:30:48] and he said
[1:30:51] now i'm jumping way ahead so i'm
[1:30:52] spoiling next sunday
[1:30:57] he said if you're a believer
[1:31:01] you're living for others
[1:31:06] and he said
[1:31:07] now i'm gonna i'm just paraphrasing i
[1:31:09] might come to this quote you say no you
[1:31:11] said it twice well i'm telling you by
[1:31:12] memory so
[1:31:14] the brother brown had people come up to
[1:31:15] me said oh but brother brown you know
[1:31:17] you know mr susie she never had money to
[1:31:20] heat her house and so i bought some coal
[1:31:22] and i bought her some bananas so she had
[1:31:24] something to eat and that and you know
[1:31:25] what's a prophet called
[1:31:27] you're gonna need oxygen
[1:31:29] he said you low down hypocrite
[1:31:34] you mean to tell me that you're actually
[1:31:36] telling me what you did
[1:31:38] you mean to tell me that you're letting
[1:31:39] the right hand know what the left hand
[1:31:41] did
[1:31:42] he said you do that so naturally
[1:31:46] you just do that so naturally like
[1:31:48] you're just like christ well like you're
[1:31:50] just so natural you just walk up to the
[1:31:52] cross you throw your arms out drive the
[1:31:54] nails in
[1:31:56] because that's just who you are
[1:31:58] you're the sacrificial man
[1:32:01] and he said you will live for other i'm
[1:32:03] not saying
[1:32:05] you know i'm not talking about
[1:32:08] welfare
[1:32:09] but you will do things for others and
[1:32:12] you won't even be it won't even it won't
[1:32:13] even be like you don't have to like
[1:32:15] premeditate it
[1:32:17] it's just like
[1:32:28] he said that dozens
[1:32:30] and dozens
[1:32:31] and maybe in the hundreds
[1:32:34] of times
[1:32:36] we'll get to there
[1:32:38] let me show you how society has changed
[1:32:42] in brother dale's
[1:32:44] very short life
[1:32:48] you know in brother dale's short life
[1:32:49] there was no such thing as cordless
[1:32:51] anything
[1:32:54] even
[1:32:55] i even remember when cbs come out they
[1:32:57] were the first cordless thing and the
[1:32:59] and the antenna had to be 20 feet tall
[1:33:02] it was so tall our antenna on dad's old
[1:33:05] chrysler car would hit hydra wires and
[1:33:07] pulled the end off it
[1:33:12] you getting the picture
[1:33:14] you thought it was always like today
[1:33:19] no
[1:33:20] when luanne called me on the rotary
[1:33:22] phone
[1:33:22] that you couldn't move more than the
[1:33:24] cord would reach
[1:33:26] so everybody in the family heard your
[1:33:27] love affair
[1:33:28] i miss you on it like crazy
[1:33:32] took you half an hour the diary number
[1:33:34] because if it was if it was the one or
[1:33:36] the three it took a long ways to go
[1:33:38] around and then
[1:33:40] and then the one
[1:33:44] then like the knights it would just sink
[1:33:46] and they'd go right back
[1:33:47] by like the ones or the twos or that
[1:33:49] they were like
[1:33:52] it's three right
[1:33:56] it's in a pulse here
[1:33:58] he said you know our grandparents when i
[1:33:59] was alive
[1:34:00] he said we used to attend church
[1:34:03] in a tent meaning revival for six weeks
[1:34:06] seven days a week
[1:34:09] every night
[1:34:14] i wonder how many would come
[1:34:17] i should try that
[1:34:21] you know when i was a kid
[1:34:23] i remember revival going from friday
[1:34:25] night saturday night sunday morning
[1:34:27] sunday night monday night tuesday night

[1:34:30] night saturday night sunday morning
[1:34:32] sunday night
[1:34:40] see what we get on sunday morning
[1:34:44] same god
[1:34:46] exact same god
[1:34:48] matter of fact
[1:34:51] they never had what you had
[1:34:56] that matter of fact they never even had
[1:34:58] announce of what you had because all the
[1:35:01] seals have been opened
[1:35:02] and the mysteries are made known
[1:35:05] and you're in such a love affair
[1:35:09] oh
[1:35:15] ouch
[1:35:17] ouch
[1:35:19] you're so happy to see god ouch
[1:35:25] they said our parents they used to
[1:35:27] attend sunday
[1:35:29] sunday through wednesday night revivals
[1:35:31] at our church
[1:35:33] us
[1:35:34] we used to attend church
[1:35:35] occasionally
[1:35:37] on sunday morning our children we used
[1:35:39] to attend church on sun mother's day and
[1:35:42] easter and our grandchildren
[1:35:46] church
[1:35:47] what's the meaning of that
[1:35:56] see
[1:35:59] for all those people that don't think
[1:36:01] brother dale believes in holiness
[1:36:06] what you do in moderation
[1:36:09] your kids are doing access
[1:36:12] and your grandkids will be
[1:36:14] unrecognizable
[1:36:16] be careful
[1:36:21] be very careful
[1:36:27] wow
[1:36:29] when the lamb was chosen
[1:36:31] then you were chosen
[1:36:34] with him
[1:36:36] before the foundation of the world and
[1:36:37] you are as i said last night the
[1:36:40] attributes
[1:36:42] of god's thinking and see that's the
[1:36:44] only way
[1:36:47] that's the only way
[1:36:51] that's completely the only way
[1:36:54] that you'll have eternal life
[1:36:57] and a form of eternal life there's the
[1:37:00] only one form of eternal life
[1:37:03] and that's god
[1:37:05] and that's all
[1:37:07] and he's the one
[1:37:10] that's eternal
[1:37:13] wow
[1:37:15] ain't that amazing
[1:37:20] see it's not by perchance see that's how
[1:37:23] god
[1:37:24] could say i will have a ride
[1:37:27] and she won't fall like the first bride
[1:37:30] in the garden there's no chance just not
[1:37:32] it's not possible it's not even possible
[1:37:37] see
[1:37:38] i'm going to close with this
[1:37:40] is all these all these quotes in
[1:37:42] scripture
[1:37:49] you said even when you weren't seeking
[1:37:51] god you never did see god by the way
[1:37:55] but even when you weren't even conscious
[1:37:57] of god
[1:37:59] if you came from god
[1:38:01] there was something different
[1:38:06] right
[1:38:07] you say how can that be
[1:38:10] all of job's friends including his wife
[1:38:14] told him to curse god
[1:38:17] and die
[1:38:20] did he curse god
[1:38:22] no he didn't curse god but do you know
[1:38:24] god job came right up
[1:38:27] to telling god
[1:38:29] he wished he had never been born
[1:38:31] and if god would have let him been born
[1:38:33] he wished he would have died in birth
[1:38:40] pretty close
[1:38:44] i was reading after i kind of put my
[1:38:46] message together
[1:38:49] you know our prophet said that during
[1:38:51] your whole life when you're serving the
[1:38:53] devil
[1:38:54] you thought
[1:38:57] if you were part of god
[1:39:00] there's things
[1:39:01] that you would reach out to do
[1:39:05] and god wouldn't let you take them
[1:39:11] you desired them
[1:39:16] and it was within your grasp
[1:39:18] but it was not allowed
[1:39:21] every one of you got stories like that
[1:39:24] i
[1:39:24] do i do but let me tell you about the
[1:39:27] prophets
[1:39:29] when his wife and his daughter died and
[1:39:31] he disobeyed god
[1:39:33] he listened to a woman
[1:39:35] his mother-in-law
[1:39:37] and he called the people
[1:39:39] that the revelation was wrong
[1:39:42] called them holy rollers
[1:39:44] you know what
[1:39:46] the prophet said the way of a
[1:39:48] transgressor
[1:39:50] is really
[1:39:52] really
[1:39:54] really hard
[1:40:01] you wanted to know another reason how
[1:40:02] you know
[1:40:03] if god won't tell you
[1:40:05] depart from me i never knew you
[1:40:09] there's another way
[1:40:12] it's impossible
[1:40:15] for some for god
[1:40:19] to mock
[1:40:20] god
[1:40:21] it's not possible
[1:40:25] you might talk about a person
[1:40:28] and you might say i don't understand
[1:40:29] this person i don't understand why they
[1:40:31] have four dogs and
[1:40:32] eat
[1:40:34] eat
[1:40:35] hot dogs
[1:40:38] but when you come and attack them
[1:40:41] their god
[1:40:43] or their revelation of their god
[1:40:46] it's not possible
[1:40:50] to a believer it's not possible
[1:40:55] and god said himself
[1:40:57] that if you did that there would be no
[1:40:59] forgiveness
[1:41:00] ever
[1:41:02] amen
[1:41:05] i'd be really careful
[1:41:07] i just i just i told i said i just ain't
[1:41:11] going there
[1:41:13] that's just one place i ain't going to
[1:41:14] go
[1:41:17] the prophet said when his wife died
[1:41:21] and hope died and that was during the
[1:41:22] flood and when the water came 22 feet
[1:41:24] high in the city and his dad had died
[1:41:27] and his and his brother i believe
[1:41:29] brother or uncle had died and god was
[1:41:32] penalizing
[1:41:34] his disobedience
[1:41:37] he knew he was
[1:41:41] now
[1:41:42] the prophet was a part of god
[1:41:45] and when he prayed
[1:41:47] he said it was like a black
[1:41:49] sheep
[1:41:51] between him and god
[1:41:54] you say
[1:41:55] how's that possible because he was part
[1:41:57] of god
[1:42:00] the way of a transgressor
[1:42:02] is very hard
[1:42:07] like saul
[1:42:11] saul
[1:42:12] tried to kill god's people tried to kill
[1:42:15] david
[1:42:16] sought after him with the army
[1:42:20] threw
[1:42:21] javelins at him spears
[1:42:25] plotted against them
[1:42:29] went to the witch of indar
[1:42:31] never went to god to prayer meaning
[1:42:33] never went to prayer i mean he went to
[1:42:34] uh
[1:42:35] spiritualism
[1:42:38] called up samuel
[1:42:40] and committed suicide
[1:42:46] and when i i i i find this amazing
[1:42:49] when he went to the witch indoor and he
[1:42:51] called up the prophet
[1:42:52] the prophet said that god has left you
[1:42:56] saw
[1:42:58] and that wasn't even enough and god
[1:43:00] actually hated you
[1:43:02] now that that's that's far out
[1:43:05] but she was but he was still a part of
[1:43:08] god and god saved saul
[1:43:10] now
[1:43:11] now that's just
[1:43:13] that's a paradox
[1:43:16] but here's our very own prophet in our
[1:43:18] time
[1:43:20] and
[1:43:22] under the burden of losing his wife and
[1:43:24] his little sharon rose hope
[1:43:29] satan came
[1:43:31] and he said
[1:43:32] you mean to tell me
[1:43:35] that you came home from work you were
[1:43:37] saving pennies
[1:43:39] and you would go preach all night
[1:43:42] and you'd go this and you'd go to the
[1:43:44] hospital and pray for sick and
[1:43:46] you'd come on prayer meeting and pray
[1:43:49] and there was nobody there or two or
[1:43:51] three people
[1:43:53] and then now you're going through this
[1:43:55] big trial
[1:43:57] and you pray to god and he just shuts
[1:43:59] the door
[1:44:00] in your face
[1:44:03] he said
[1:44:05] this is still satan talking
[1:44:07] and he said you mean to tell me
[1:44:10] that you want to serve that kind of a
[1:44:12] person
[1:44:13] and that's your god
[1:44:15] i don't understand you brother brad
[1:44:19] and the prophet said
[1:44:22] he said you know satan
[1:44:25] that's just about how it is
[1:44:28] you know
[1:44:30] i beginning to think
[1:44:34] and he said all of us i did
[1:44:38] something hit me
[1:44:41] and he said
[1:44:42] but if you slay me
[1:44:45] i'll still serve you
[1:44:52] impossible
[1:44:54] for him to curse god
[1:44:57] he was preparing to
[1:45:02] but not able
[1:45:08] and that's how all of our lives have
[1:45:09] been
[1:45:10] so if you see somebody that goes around
[1:45:14] and they're just blasting
[1:45:18] the holy spirit
[1:45:20] wherever it would be
[1:45:28] check your math answer
[1:45:31] in the word of god
[1:45:34] because it's not possible
[1:45:37] it's not possible
[1:45:39] it's not possible
[1:45:42] you know you know that man it's
[1:45:45] it's not possible
[1:45:51] you know
[1:46:15] one second and we're gonna close
[1:46:28] wow
[1:46:34] here it is
[1:46:37] position of the believer in christ
[1:46:41] he said oh you say o brother branham i
[1:46:43] tell you i did this
[1:46:45] and i did that
[1:46:46] and yet i i know
[1:46:48] that i've got it because i know that
[1:46:52] i'm part of god because
[1:46:55] i prayed for the sick
[1:46:57] and they get healed
[1:46:59] it gets better than that
[1:47:01] he said
[1:47:02] i know that i've got it
[1:47:05] i i just
[1:47:07] that's just amazing our prophet
[1:47:09] he said god revealed his word to me
[1:47:12] like this
[1:47:14] and like that
[1:47:16] or the other
[1:47:18] and i have the knowledge
[1:47:20] of the written word
[1:47:24] and our prophet said
[1:47:27] you're wrong
[1:47:28] i healed the sick and i spoke in tongues
[1:47:31] and i do these things and i even cast
[1:47:34] out devils
[1:47:36] and jesus said many will come in my name
[1:47:39] with that same story
[1:47:41] lord i have cast out devils of thy name
[1:47:43] prophesied in my name and in thy name
[1:47:45] have i not done many works and then i
[1:47:47] will confess to them depart from me you
[1:47:50] worker of the devil iniquity
[1:47:53] i do not know you
[1:47:56] intimacy
[1:47:58] relationship
[1:48:01] family
[1:48:03] that kind of change is the picture
[1:48:05] doesn't it brother
[1:48:06] oh you say but brother branham i know a
[1:48:09] man that can
[1:48:11] and oh he does
[1:48:12] this
[1:48:15] listen to his answer to that
[1:48:18] don't never look at a man by what he can
[1:48:21] do
[1:48:23] in the signs of works
[1:48:26] that's where he's
[1:48:29] nothing
[1:48:31] he might heal the sick
[1:48:33] and he might have many gifts of prophecy
[1:48:37] and he might even understand
[1:48:40] all the knowledge
[1:48:43] don't you never
[1:48:46] look to that
[1:48:51] but you thought
[1:48:52] that was god's vindication
[1:48:56] of a called man of god
[1:49:07] if you're part of the word
[1:49:10] it's not possible to leave the word
[1:49:14] regardless
[1:49:16] of what people say
[1:49:18] less then
[1:49:23] oh thank you lord
[1:49:25] so glad i'm yours lord
