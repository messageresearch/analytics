uh you know we we uh counted a privilege myself I count it a privilege to be here always is a wonderful thrill to my heart to get to drive up that road and cross that hereon border over there and come down into Wyoming I I I really we've had some fond times in this little church through the years and it just means a lot to me and the Lord willing I'm going to put brother Dale on a plane with me and maybe brother Jose if he's willing we're going to go back to Uganda and give that another try at some point and uh we we're looking forward to that and I know this little church this body has been praying for me and uh you've been holding my health before the Lord and I want to give you a praise report before we go onah not only can you tell I've always been good-look but I'm a skinnier good-looking oh I'm just teasing I'm just teasing but I I've I've been able to significantly reverse a lot of conditions in my body as of right now I'm completely off of high blood pressure medicine alog together the Lord Jesus has completely reversed and healed blood pressure problems I have zero blood pressure problems praise God and according to all of the numbers the facts the figures and the experts I am actually in the process as they put it in reversing diab diabetes in my body Hall and I want to thank God I want to thank you people for your many many prayers I know you've been holding me up before the Lord and I want you to know how much it means to me nor OD you know my my family we're kind of stoic people we can be a little emotionless and kind of almost straight-faced sometimes and so I've had to learn how to use my words as much as possible to convey my feelings but I just want you to know what it's meant to me and quite honestly your prayers I suppose with all the others that's been praying too which whoever they might be but I I know of this church specific speically and you Saints gather here tonight your prayers has saved my life and I want you to know that and I was uh after that bout I took with Co my health and all the traveling and everything I've suffered my health was going straight down straight down but you know that's the thing the Lord knows how to do what he needs to do and God willing the next time I see you not only will I testify that diabetes is completely gone but I'm expecting to be about 50 lb lighter than what I am that's 25 kilos for you Canadians amen so we appreciate the Lord and so we just know that God is able God is able God can do anything you know something that I've learned in this last 14 years that I've been battling through different things I've learned not to say never I've learned not to say not to give up hope right and not to just quit and throw in the towel and I think my little problem compared to brother Jose some years ago he was uh in such a bad bad condition and look at how the Lord has raised our brother up amen I look around the room and I see many different ones that's battled and things like that you know in your own heart what I'm saying is true God is still a Healer he's still the same yesterday today and forever don't you think so and it doesn't matter what you may be facing tonight be it a physical thing a spiritual thing emotional thing our God is still on the throne and as long as he's there there's power for the believer healing for the believer Authority for the believer amen

chapter 9 verse 1 2 and 3 2 Samuel 9 let's look at verse one the Lord helping us tonight I want to speak to you upon a seat at the table a seat at the table bless Jesus and David said is there yet anything that is left out of the house of Saul that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake and there was of the House of Saul a servant whose name was Zeba and when they had called unto him called him unto David the king said unto him art thou Zeba and he said thy servant is he the king said is there not yet any of those the house of Saul any of the House of Saul that I might show kindness the kindness of God unto him and zebus said unto the king Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet drop down to verse six now when MTH the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come unto David he fell on his face and did reverence and David said MF and he answered Behold thy servant and David said fear not for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually let's pray together for the word while your heads are bowed this evening if you just like to be remembered in prayer maybe by the lifting of your hand you'd like to just say Lord I have a need tonight my hands up as well Lord Jesus what a privilege it is to come into to this place yes Lord father as we have assembled here we do so in the name of Jesus Christ not only do we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all of the goodness and the kindness that you have shown unto us but Lord Jesus we give you praise for what you're doing even right now and for what you will do in the future to come if there is a future before us for Lord we know that thou the same yesterday today and forever as we stand here and divine presence we do not come here Lord according to our own feeling of what we'd like to be doing on a Saturday night perhaps maybe folk tired from working and what more and maybe it's a bit of a sacrifice but Lord yet I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord hallelujah so father we thank you for this Divine appointment that has been set before us for Lord we know where two and three are gathered if any will gather in that name and that itude of worship Lord you will be right there in the midst we know you're here right now we want to thank you and praise you for being that same God yesterday today and forever we pray you'll come into this place Lord and that you'll take your word you'll break it forth the bread of life to each one of us open our hearts and our appetites that we might receive and eat down that word of God lord Jesus anoint me as your son tonight Lord to be able to get out of the way and speak that with which the people need to receive and hear father may you allow their eyes and ears to come open tonight to that which you will speak to us as we commit all of this to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and all of God's children said amen amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good amen we we we thank the Lord for the scripture reading and we're certainly grateful for the reading of the word of the Lord as we know that there's many things that a man could say but one thing for sure one word from God Amen is enough to solve all of the problems of our life and the Destinies that we hold and the directions that we'll take one word from God can change the course of everything around us amen and place us into the presence of the Lord in a way we never dream was possible before and I so love the Bible and how that the scripture lays out everything that we have need of and what I mean not only does it tell us about the things and the conditions of healing and salvation and deliverance and powers and authorities of God but the Bible lays out all of the patterns of life that we need to know how that human beings lived in this filthy old Satan's Eden I I want you to remember that this has not just been Satan's Eden just today but Satan brother said for 6,000 years has been restructuring and redoing and Reinventing the world around us amen and each year that goes by they get a little bit weaker wiser and sin heaps up and gets worse and worse as we go on Amen but Christian people those that have followed on to know the Lord they have stood the test of every age of every Century of every decade of every hour of every season of every time no matter what the difficulty may have been amen God's people have always Rose to the occasion can you say amen amen and that doesn't change here tonight we as God's people no matter how difficult things might be around us no matter what kind of conditions might be in our own lives or our bodies or families or churches or places of employment amen our school system our government uh uh uh uh structuring in the way that everything fits together amen it doesn't matter how evil they get it don't matter how down on the people of God they get how down on Church they might get Amen brother about told us they'll never ever shut us up God will take us out of here amen for there's a Rapture and a resurrection down the road a little while amen and if it's all right with you I plan on joining that number When the Saints Go Marching In amen and I want to tell you tonight that God's word lays out the pattern for every difficulty we're ever going to go through amen any problem that we'll ever face any issue that'll ever come up in our life somewhere in this blessed old book right here is a pattern an example of somebody that's gone through something similar to what you've gone through if not exactly amen and every time our God is a PR a help a present help in the time of trouble amen and whether you're white or black red or green or purple or whatever you might be man or woman African American Canadian amen Our God don't discriminate amen he honors faith and if you believe him like they did he can be the same to you that he was to them back then the Bible always has the pattern we always follow the pattern of the scripture because Christ brother bam told us hid himself in the pages of those Li of the of the Bible and the lives of the people that they wrote about you take for example The Book of Ruth four little small chapters amen from the outside looking in it's just a boy that fell in love with a girl and a girl that fell in love with a boy amen it ain't no different than any romantic uh uh uh television show or book that somebody might read and that way amen from the outside looking in it's just a common everyday occurrence but brother bam told us that Christ would hide himself in the lives of these people amen and in four little old chapters amen Ruth or Boaz or Naomi or Ora or none of them probably had any idea what it was that they were doing they probably had no understanding as to what was taking place amen but right there in them four chapters we have everything from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost himself we've got the Harvest Time the Gathering time the goodbye kiss god with the Orthodox Jews god with the 144,000 amen the opening of The Seven Seals Redemption to the bride of Christ seven Church ages all of that laying right just in them four little chapters amen why God hid himself in the lives of these people Amen brother R said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed if you go into the Bible and you can't see Christ in every page go back and read it again why he's hiding there somewhere Amen brother God see somewhere inside that word is Christ laying in there and I used to wonder to myself how could the Lord be hiding in all of those uh be able beat toab and the dubab be a hobab and all these other guys and I would think what how's Christ hiding in that amen and one day I was reading the Bible and I came up on the genealogy and the Holy Spirit said to me what are you looking at amen I said I'm looking at a family lineage he said that's right amen am I not also a father do I not also have many sons and daughters amen did I not send Jesus to this world that by one son I could bring many sons and many daughters into existence amen he even hides himself in the genealogies of many names we can't even pronounce amen but yet he's hiding right there in the pages of the word can you say amen amen and don't forget everything that we see in the Bible is inspired of God Paul told Timothy the entire word of God inspired again in Hebrews holy men of old spake was they moved on by the Holy Ghost entire Bible from Genesis Revelation amen is the mystery of God it is the the the very purpose of God Amen hid in the lives of human beings you know and I find it amazing that when we come to this hiding of the spirit of God in the lives of the fleshly Tabernacles some of the stories that we get out of this you would think that if the Lord was going to hide himself in a story he picked the great great great of the great warriors and the conquerors and the great uh pronounced ones of the world and look around for the wonderful ones and all of the smart and the intellectual ones but ain't know how God does things cuz brother already told us that God hides himself and he reveals himself in the Simplicity of this life in this world Amen in other words what I'm trying to say to you is that the Holy Ghost man hid himself in some of the worst cases in the broken cases come on you ain't fig how to say amen I know amen hid himself in the disasters and the train wrecks amen and the shipwrecks and all of the broken lives and all the broken material amen because All Things Are Made Beautiful In God's Time can you say Amen the Holy Ghost knows how to hide himself in all of these things and he shows his Beauty through all of the Brokenness of the world I'll tell you one thing for sure no matter how broken you might get Christ might be hiding in that Brokenness no matter how much disaster might be in the family or how much turmoil might be right there in the church or what kind of tension might be around your place of business don't forget it's in those things those things Brother D that God hides himself in amen I learned a long time ago as a Son of God As a Christian not to get excited when things start going wrong Amen to settle down a little bit cuz the Holy Spirit hides himself in those things amen I was reading the other day to a little assembly where brother am said God's the one that brings tension in the church God's the one that permits disasters God's the one that permits turmoil and bankruptcies and all these other things like that amen you think maybe that job Hallelujah that somebody said well you just ain't going to work here no more you were so upset and distraught about it amen but you don't realize in that Brokenness that God had a different path for you to follow and through all of that the blessings of God would come with it he always hides himself in the Brokenness of people as our story opens up tonight amen right in the king's Palace King David we see a such a case as this in this boy mblf and we know that this boy's life was something that many might have just read well that was a nice thing for David to do but actually what you can see here is a type of you and I and a type if you understand understand what a type is amen it's a story of someone's life that patterns the same as yours down here you can see parallels and equalities between what you read in the Old Testament the New Testament to what you see way on up up yonder here in the 21st century I can look back at some of David's situations amen and some of the very same things he went through in his mind his Spirit his body out there in the kingdom and what more I can see the same things taking place in schools in homes and everything else a why because somewhere in The Human Experience amen there's always going to be Brokenness in there God through Brokenness knows how to bring it out to make a beautiful picture you know what I love about this story of this boy is that when you look at the background of how this all transpired David as we know was taken from the Sheep coat he was a nobody God trained him the man said under a different atmosphere from the rest of his brothers so what he happened to be bringing amen the foods and the things in or whatever it might have been and he happened to be uh uh walking along a pathway perhaps and he hears the boasting from Goliath you see David hadn't been under the pressures of those armies those Israelites had lost so many battles to them Philistines that they were scared to death that this would wipe them out but David who had never experienced any of those things he' just been on the back side of the desert with his heart playing Thou shalt not and amen and the Lord Lay Me Down and Green Pastures and valleys of Shadows and he was singing These gospel songs back there amen probably David a little bitty guy probably had a little bit of piano to go along with him amen hallelujah but anyways David was a man that had the ability to so obey the Lord that when the anointing of the Holy Ghost would come upon him and a bear a lion would come after one of his father's Sheep amen he didn't fear what could happen to those uh uh those sheep he didn't fear what could happen to himself amen because God was bigger than all of it amen and when he come walking along and he saw this great big Goliath standing there amen he had eyeballs this big around I mean that guy's head must have been as big as a washtub amen but he wasn't looking at the size of Goliath he was looking at the size of his God that filled all space Time and Eternity knowing that he was able to deliver a lion and a bear amen and that uncircumcised Philistine would be nothing different amen but jealous said into the kingdom Saul who always wanted the spotlight always was the Big Man on Campus and wanted everybody to see how spiritual he was and always was promoting himself and things of that nature amen God had anointed this little Ruddy mama's boy to come take it over from him amen and like any man that's in power that don't want to lose his power he starts getting jealous and attacking amen and as David suffered through Saul's persecution the javelins and the backbiting and the and the name saying and all watching Saul go through that almost what we would call today a bipolar type personality Love David today hated him tomorrow best friend today he was a miserable enemy the next day amen just back and forth and the the the turmoil amen and the pressure that would must have been waged upon David's mind the very thing that he must have had to endure emotionally with a man he loved and respected Amen to think that that fell would treat him so scandalously and and ridicule him and and bash out every accomplishment he ever made amen and turn right around in the same breath and praise him and talk about how great he was the world today would have called Saul crazy but don't say that to David because David was a man that knew his office as a anointed king was something that God permitted and David would have stood by that office and even slayed someone when he found out what they had done to Saul and how they behave with Saul he had such respect for this man that when he was in the cave and cut a piece of His Garment his heart smot him that's how much respect and love that David carried for this old man he had such a feeling toward him that no matter what evil Saul may have said when he got in his presence he bowed himself and called himself a dog you understand how little David made himself in the Bible in the Old Testament the dog was the Lost thing that could have been spoke of nothing against your Pooch but we're talking Bible now not your home home address but you understand that you wer even allowed to receive tithing off of an animal such as that it was considered a a low thing in the Bible and yet here David would come before Saul and call himself a flea call himself a dog humble himself to the very man that would have taken his life had David yielded himself to it and God not protected him that's right now here we are many years later after he has bound his soul to Jonathan his beloved friend of whom they had such a Booz and relationship they said the Bible said even their souls were knit together you understand that when Saul and Jonathan now have gone off the scene this boy remaining mblf the nursea grabs him and tries to flee out when she does as anyone would in haste she made an error and she drops this boy and he falls on his feet and it makes him lame said the Bible MF was a was a creature that probably many looked at scandalously in some way if you've ever had anybody in your family that's ever had disabilities you know intimately how people treat people with with some kind of disability or uh some kind of inadequacy in their mind or something like that my my wife Samantha her brother Chris had a fetal stroke when they was using the forceps to pull him from the womb and the the the forcep the metal of it squished a little nerve or place right there on his head caused him to have a fetal stroke and you can see people that have this same behavior it's happened many many times especially back in our time in the 70s amen and it's uh it's his right arm and his foot he's got kind of a little limp like this and and and his arm is drawn like that now that left arm of his is strong as a tree trunk don't ever try to arm wrestle let me break your arm but that right arm is as deformed as it can be it's always is in a constant state like that right there and he's got a little limp in that foot from where that side was affected from the stroke and all the years I've known Chris past 20 almost 30 years now and uh probably even a little longer than that Troy told since we were boys people have always made fun of him treated him like a second class citizen showed pity on him when they shouldn't have showed pity on him always treated him like something you know wasn't always just exactly normal and there was behave like that you could look at a boy and see he's got a problem but they treated him in that way Samantha learned at a young age how to defend herself against bullies and things like that because when they would jump on Chris they had little 4 foot one to fight and she'll buy your kneecaps don't you think she won over that brother of hers she would stand up for him and fight and argue and scratch and carry on that's my brother you leave him alone she stood up for him amen but people always treated him like something you know education and things like that he could have done anything he wanted to do as far as his mind goes he's got a sharp mind but he was just handicapped where he couldn't do everything physically the same as the other boys but he loved football and he loved basketball and he loved them other kind of things and you know he get out there and he bounce the ball and try to shoot it and they'd make fun of him when he'd miss it amen while they're two good strong arms and legs just running up to the hoop and jumping and spinning and carrying on amen he suffered like that all of his days well in my mind I think of what myef may have had to suffer how people must have looked down upon him how they must have treated him and and and looked on him like you know maybe sitting around the dinner table you know that boy I feel so sorry for that kid all the things you know why don't they put him in a home or a nursing home or assisted living or just get there just a burden on everybody you know and that nursaid I heard about her let me tell you one thing she's a little old cuty thing anyways and fooled around dropped the kid can you believe that so had scandal from the very moment Not only was he lame at his feet but remember the reputation he was carrying came from what happened with Saul and the way that Saul went out of the Kingdom now David is Anointed to be the Son and the servant of God to rule over Israel and imagine now David with his love hiding in his heart wanting to do something for the kingdom of God Amen the Holy Ghost places upon his heart this little old crippled up twisted up MF I want you to understand something a lot of times when we come up to this altar right here we get in it on mind when we come up here that perhaps God is looking at us like we think maybe David was looking at him listen to me now in some cases we think that maybe David was looking down upon MF feeling sorry for him treating him almost as if well he's a poor crippled up thing and I'm a king so I can do something for this boy and often we think when we come to the altar before God we think the Lord does something for us because he's feeling sorry for us and he's taking pity on us because we're just these poor little old creatures but if you can look at this tonight Through The Eyes of David and you see that right you're going to be able to look through the eyes of God at yourself tonight and see that right too because whenever he takes this boy and puts him in his presence David was not looking at this boy in his crippled up condition David was not focusing upon his back around or who his family was not the ills and the wrongs of it I mean David wasn't focusing upon that boy and saying well look at what a sad condition you know history tells us he lived in a city called Lo dear we've all been in that place low debar the very City's name itself means a lacking insufficient and even this boy's name a fiish Chef the very meaning of his name is a breathing shame not only does his name represents shame in his character does a name represents something not only is his legs all crippled up and he lives in a city of lack low de bar we've all passed through there I think I'm the mayor of it sometimes I go back for for weekly visits and occasions as he goes into this place before the king's Palace and how he got there maybe we don't know exactly did they they wheel him in somehow or another amen or somebody carry him in or was he able to walk but he had kind of a his gate was kind of a little slanted hilted type thing but when he comes before the king listen to his words if you go and read the verse right after that will we stop verse eight I think it was MF gets down before David like this and calls himself a dog and I wonder if a thought didn't go through David's mind when he hears those that word looking at that boy he had every right humanly speaking now's my time to take Vengeance on the house of Saul if I wanted to show my anger and show how hurt I've been through the years and show that person I didn't deserve to be treated that way and now's my chance to get even with you but David didn't have that kind of heart in him because as he looked down at maef calling himself a dog he remembered something you know what he remembered this boy sees himself this way but that is the son of Saul that is the that is the grandson of Saul that is the son of Jonathan Royal Blood is flowing through his veins crippled up as he may be by the Coss twisted up as he may be living in a society in a world that is miserable around him living with scars living with with with all kinds of problems and is anybody hear me tonight living with all of the mess that he's living with no matter what that boy might be going through if he can only understand he is a king son Royal Blood is flowing through his veins he is the grandson of King Saul the anointed of God and that anointing is in his family and had Jonathan lived long enough he would have been King but because he didn't now here's MF this is the only blood lineage that is left in Saul's Kingdom so David didn't look down at that boy and say to himself ah here's my chance yes like some people do when they face abusers that's right when they face other ones that have done them evil through the years and uh uh molesters and and liars and adulterers and you know marriages and things when husbands have stepped out wives have stepped out amen that guy comes back and repents or she comes back and repent amen and they take that attitude like we think that maybe somebody would do with this boy here and say oh now's my chance now I'm going to get even with you now I'm going to show you what it feels like amen but you understand that's not the spirit of Christ but in this scenario we read about here tonight the spirit of Christ was fighting in David the spirit of Christ was in this man and as he looked at that boy in his condition maybe he might have said something like this MF you don't see who you are but I do oh Hallelujah the same thing that God may look at you and I in the same way all of our twisted up complexes all of our scars all of the abuses all of the bad experiences we've ever had we might come before God and s nothing but a doll but if Jesus could talk to us tonight he might say you might see yourself that way but I don't you are a king son roal blood is flying through your veins you don't live in L the bar anymore Mya he said as long as I live and as long as the Lord will permit me in other words will say language he said you have a special seat right here at my table thank you Hallelujah glory to God and all the days of his life this boy received the blessings of God I want you to understand I don't care how crippled up things may look around you are you listening to me I don't care how bad things might look I don't care how awful the scenario might be around you I don't care how low that bank account's going I don't care how poorly that car is doing out there I don't care how wed them children grandchildren are I don't care how much your lost loved ones might be running Here There and Everywhere amen I don't care how crippled up they are Jesus said no man can come to the father except I draw him first or you just keep hanging on because one day King David is going to call MF into his presence hallelujah amen amen amen he'll call him into my presence he said I draw all man unto me if I he lifted up I'll draw all man unto me and I'll call him into my presence and I'll bless him and how did he bless this boy with an identity he gave him a new identity from what he used to have remember that when he lived in this place this lar without pasture life of lack he lived in a place without a pasture no Shepherd in there neither cuz that's usually where the Shepherds hide is in the pastures no one to guide him no one to instruct him I wonder if that's not what's happening around the message of the hour so many people are being swept up in all of the crippling attitudes and the crippling doctrines and the crippling leadership of the day amen and preachers are like this wet nurse making haste and running from one thing to another instead of selling down on the word of God and saying what the prophet said and saying what the Bible said and telling the people the truth they've sat on and run around with every little old thing until they've crippled their entire churches up until they can't even walk spiritually and stand on their own two feet makes me wonder how many nurses in this late hour have dropped the sons of God and the daughters of God cause lameness because of their spirit and their attitude doesn't have to be just preachers it could be people in the church as well you see your attitude toward one another could make a big difference to where somebody feels comfortable here tonight amen if you're side ey am all the time or not shaking their hand or walking way around to get around them amen people pick up on things you can't Bluff Humanity amen and if you've got a problem somewhere or another they're going to pick up on that amen and you don't realize what you're doing but you're dropping causing lameness amen and God will require every bit of it at the day of judgment if we don't repent of it that's why we got to keep our hearts right our spirit right everything about us keep it right if we mess up make it right repent for it keep it right but here this boy imagine his name the mouth of Shame a breathing shame but notice the thing that caused maef to be is he was was because of a fall the fall is what made him like he was some of you getting it the fall was the reason that he became lame the fall was the reason that he lived in L dear the fall was a reason that he didn't take the throne like he should [Applause] have brother says we bypassed all theophany to come to this thing to be tempted and tried right you mean to tell me that I was supposed to come directly to a throne and wound up in this yeah wow and everyone that takes the breath of life becomes just like my FF a breathing shame these little youngans as much as you love them as much as you care for them they're precious but let their life just continue into the world let their life continue on they become a breathing shame that is if God don't get a hold of them if God's hand of Mercy isn't on them every person that takes the breath of life becomes a breathing shame in in this world the fallou is what put that Identity On Us the fou is what put us in loab bar the foul is what put us in the condition we are today the Fall In the Garden of Eden placed every one of us in this condition to where that our whole life without Jesus is a breathing shame you might be successful as successful can be by World standards without without Christ there's no success in it whatsoever am cuz I'll tell you one thing I've I've seen many a funeral I've never seen anybody with U-Hauls coming down the road amen nobody with Pinsky trucks and and and and moving characters and whoever else your guys are here in Canada amen they don't take it to the Grave with them well don't thing they got is whatever character they come to this world with and whatever they leave and notice this boy Falls at David's feet I'm a dog of course he saw himself as a loser not as one that could be identified as a king he could not identify himself with his true identity are you listening to me he saw himself based upon his handicap not upon who he was oh my God my God my God how many of us have done the very same thing sitting right here tonight instead basing all of our faith and our promises and our victories and our deliverances and the overcoming upon who God made us when he gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have always based it upon some little handicap in our life I hear people say it all the time brother J I would but I would but I could if I maybe sort of kind of God's holy ghost come to take all of that out of us we should not be identifying ourself by the weaknesses of this flesh cuz Paul said when I'm weak Thou Art strong Hallelujah I can trust that the Lord Jesus is going to raise me up to be a conqueror Raise Me Up to be an overcomer Raise Me [Applause] Up not because of the shortcomings of this but because of who I am in his sight I'm royalty I'm a King's son his blood flows through my veins and if I can see it in the right Spirit and the right light then I will not see myself as a dog the lowest thing that could ever be but I'd see myself in a proper identity amen now let's look at a couple scriptures for a moment in Exodus 30:1 praise the Lord Jesus I want you to notice we're going to change the scene for just a little bit and bring this down to all Israel notice and Exodus 30:10 and Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year the blood of the sin offering of atonements once in a year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your Generations it is most holy unto the Lord now I want you to notice that Christ is the principal theme of The Bible amen but Redemption is the story that tells that theme Christ without you there's no story not only are we a part of the Great Plan of Redemption but it is the primary goal of Christ glory to bring God and man together amen that's right and make them one in order to do this he had to set forth the proper types set the stage if you will for what would come later on now Israel every place that Abraham put his foot on whether he realize it or not he was outlining and drawing the border of what would later be known as Palestine Israel as he walked and walked and walked and walked and walked that little posted stamp of a country over there there wasn't a person that ever moved in into it but what God didn't give him everything that was in it from the north to the South to the east to the West it was all an absolute complete inheritance of any true Israelite circumcised on the eth day walking in the law of Moses god set this up for them so that when it would come time for them to present themsel before God even the animals had a sign ific an in this Plan of Redemption all animals don't mean nothing hold on Moses told Pharaoh not one hoof is going to be left behind when we go out of here amen God so wanted the inheritance to be that all would represent the great kingdom of God you say but there's an animal matter well I'll ask this we could ask brother Ram about that when God translated him beyond the curtain of time he found a little wet nose poking at his hand he looked around there was his horse he looked down a little bit and there was his dog amen right there beond the curtain of time that's when he said everything that ever loved you and everything you ever loved would be right here amen God created the animals for a purpose they represented something right and we know that the Lamb of God the atonement of the Lamb represented the Lamb of God from the foundation into the world but notice this one lamb when they would take it into the sanctuary all throughout Israel there have been Lambs that wasn't qualified to be the sacrifice some of them might be blind some might be hauled and withered some might have disease in the case of the red heer there might be some little white hairs somewhere upon the animal's skin the red heer had to be perfectly red where and those priests would check every little scripture in the Bible to make sure it Jed or cooperated everything had to fall in this proper place no matter what kind of crosseyed condition the other animals might have been in once a year there was one perfect lamb that was taken behind the sanctuary and that perfect lamb brother J he represented that lamb dying represented the atonement for all the rest of them crippled up blind Hal wither imp perfect impure animals in Israel brother B tells a story about this little donkey I don't know if you've ever heard about this but he said being a farmer he said a mule is no good he's crosseyed his knees aren't together his tail sticks straight in the air is the horriblest looking sight you've ever seen I preached to some people like that actually you get in some certain circles preaching the gospel and say something they don't like they just go PL crossy on you right there amen and then whenever I got to look into at that tail sticking straight up in the I thought yeah I've seen them get their F feathers ruffled a few times amen like an animal stick their tail up when they get aggravated about something I've seen him do that too but then he tells the story about he said if this little fell could look around he said thanking if he could speak the Master will never let me live when he comes home he'll knock me in the head cuz I ain't worth nothing brother said that's just about like every one of us insert a good amen here CU now it's showing exactly you and I crippled up crosseyed tail sticking There Our Knees aren't together in other words we can't run right can't work right ain't got no stable foot amen everything about us was crippled up and destroyed the fall put us in that condition another message called Redeemer Redemption she said but you know if the old mother could understand and speak back to that little cult and say but wait a minute son I like them sermons like that when I get to think in certain ways about myself I like it when the man of God comes to the platform and says but wait a minute son hold on just a minute with the way you're thinking he said you were borned under a Birthright if she could talk to him she'd say the man of the house is going to go over to that flock over there and get a lamb that is perfect and without blemish on it and when that perfect lamb dies it'll die so the disfigured mule can live hallelujah oh Hallelujah again brother B says what a beautiful picture of redemption oh my the perfect Lamb of God died that we poor alienated disfigured human beings could live again what a picture of redemption he says why that little mule could kick his little heels up in the air and jump around and have a big time why he's redeemed Oh Glory to God he wasn't able to redeem himself he could not meet the standard of the word amen he wasn't pure enough he wasn't clean enough he didn't meet the standard the measuring state of being a perfect lamb but there has been one that has been offered for that disfigured little mule same thing for you and I I could never meet the standard of this word of God I could never live the way the message tells me to live but there was one perfect lamb Hallelujah that died so this disfigured mule could [Music] live praise be to God listen again Leviticus 16:34 and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once in a year and he did as the Lord commanded Moses which is an interesting thing when you think about it because there might have been men in the world that lived a closer better more perfect life than Aaron but here's the other side of the type didn't matter what kind of person Aaron was he was called as a bloodline a Birthright by bloodline to be a priest amen and there's another side that you got to look at God only allowed those those Aaron uh the the the sons of Aaron those Levites to come right from that tribe they had to be born by the blood amen they had to be born in that same family and they couldn't be permitted to be Levites didn't matter if they were smarter or better or had better ideas for business or Better Business Acumen or knew how to run a church better than somebody else I I mean they had to be called by the blood it's the same thing today a minister of the Gospel is not a minister amen because he's smart because he's got a good business acument cuz he knows how to work people and speak well amen he is who he is because the blood the tribe he come from made him a levit same thing is a child of God I'm not a child of God because I'm the smartest the richest the fastest the most athletic I'm a Child of God cuz I was born in the family of God born by the blood born with the birth rights amen and this Birthright makes me a son and as a Son of God it don't matter if I'm the best or the worst I'm still a son Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah no matter what they might say about me I'm still a son oh we remember when you did I don't care what you remember I'm still a son oh we used to I don't care what we used to do I'm still a son I remember what it used to be I don't care what you remember I'm still a son that's all that matters and if I'm a Son of God then I am born by his blood you sang it a moment ago I'm so glad to be a part of the family of God didn't you sing it did you believe it when you sang it yes it's a good place to start if you didn't it's a good place to start believing what you're saying now number 6:14 now watch again the sixth chapter numbers 6 and 14 and he shall offer his offering unto the Lord one he lamb of the first year without blemish without imagine how many of these other Lambs might have been around if you could have had like one of these Disney conversations where all these animals talk you know or some of these little children's stories or something like that you know animal fantasy they call it and one little sheep May said to the other why didn't you get picked maybe you say I'm crosseyed you see maybe that little guy said to the other why didn't you get picked I got a lame foot you understand that guy said to another how come you didn't get picked said look over here at this big splotchy patch on me I ain't got perfect wool well I guess we're just a bunch of Misfits wow perhaps they'd say to one another I guess we're all just a bunch of losers amen oh but then here come the little Pastor lamb the shepherd would come around maybe and he would say I want to remind you of something whether you're crosseyed or lame or you got patches around your disease or you just can't B in the right way maybe somebody say what's the matter with you I can't B every time I say B say a but then maybe somebody would speak up and say but I want you to realize you didn't have to be perfect you don't have to be without blemish you don't have to be without blemish you don't have to be perfect you are not being demanded or asked or required or suggested even that you've got to have everything intact and everything just as it needs to be no one is asking you to be the perfect L nobody is looking at you maybe somebody speak up where's it at he's over there in the temple see that smoke coming up amen out of the Tabernacle over there there's been one perfect lamb that's already been accepted Hallelujah and that perfect lamb is some of there dying for all of you and me than Oh Praise His holy name he says without blemish for a burnt offering one year lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering one ram without blemish for peace offerings now I'm sure when a lot of people would read this if they were trinitarian they would see three but when I read it I see one I don't see one one for the Ram one for the one for the U and or you and what one for the for the for the big and for the little I see I see one one sacrifice one manifested in this in this and in this I see one Lord Jesus I see one faith I see one baptism I see one body One Church one head which is Christ overall in all and above all and in you all one Christ sacrificing for everything he said why that little mule could kick his heels up and jump around and have a big time why he's redeemed and yet here we sit and the word of God gets preached to us sometimes and instead of that we try to feel like that maef feeling I'm just a dog I'm a loser I'm no good I live in L dear a place without a pasture I live in a place where I'm a breathing shame my I I'm my mouth is a shame my life is a shame but myf your problem is you're not seeing yourself in the way that David sees you may they make fun of him and tell what a scoundrel he was and maybe MF would believe what they said but I got news for you MF it doesn't matter what they said David's got you on his mind don't worry boy in a little while the king is going to call you into his presence hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give it time and he'll call you directly into the presence of the king let's read now Ephesians chapter 2 vers 12 now let's look at another picture this is a picture of redemption for all of us watch here the second chapter in the 12th verse that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens this word aliens means to be shut out from one's fellowship and intimacy So Not only was the Gentiles completely shut out of God's Fellowship but shut out completely from his intimacy now listen to me now the Jews were the ones that God dealt with he dealt with them as a nation until she played the part excuse his sisters of a underneath every green tree with every Idol with everything and God divorced her put her away in divorcement and he took him a virgin bride this virgin Gentile group would eventually come forth from the very roots of Pentecost where the Jews would receive the holy ghost in the upper room and then it would bleed itself as we'd say as it go right through the tree and bleed itself into the Gentile now remember preaching as we look at in the morning the Lord willing preaching was so important to God that God would not allow the Gentiles to even receive the Holy Ghost until a preacher went to him and preached it shame on these tape player people out there they say all you do is push play and obey God wants Ministry to take this message and preach it to the people listen to your tapes obey what the message says honor brother Bram honor his office respect who he was put that word in your ear day and night amen but never did God intend for a mechanical object to replace what's happening here tonight Here Comes Simon Peter with the keys to the kingdom Paul in his third pool he turns from the Jews moves himself to the Gentiles at this time we were completely imagine this completely shut out from intimacy with God completely shut out from any fellowship with God do you know what a great miracle is occurring even here tonight where you as you sit here me as I stand Here preaching even when you feel that that something reverberating back from the spirit when you feel that little tug in your heart even hear in the scripture though you could be as tired as you could possibly be be wore out everything in the world on your mind yet there's a little something that that talks to you and you meditate on the word and you feel that little bounce back do you not understand that was a door that was open to the gentile people so that we could experience his intimacy and his fellowship before that the Gentiles did not have that kind of reaction to the word we didn't feel what we felt here tonight the door was slammed on us but God said MF it's time for you to have a seat at the table so God took that little prophet and turned him from the Jews and started that first church age with 12 people mind you the Ephesian Church age was solidified in God's first age with 12 people in it the influence of those men oh you know somebody said to me well you do know that when brother Brandon wrote the church ages out that one of those Messengers Martin I think it was wasn't even alive during his church age and I said you mean to tell me that there were people in the church ages that received the message of the hour and had never saw their messenger or had contact with him I said boy that's strange to me somehow and another I said why I said because I was born in 1977 brother bam went off the scene in' 65 I've never seen nor had contact with my messenger and yet through the ministry of those that have been Faithfully taught I've received the same messages though brother Baron preached it to me himself woo that was a good one thank you Jesus right why because God wanted us to not be aliens anymore come out of your crippled up idolatrous condition you Gentiles and come and sit at the king's table that's where he broke the bread of life to us imagine this brother Jose brother B said we've got a seven course meal laid out before us cuz all Seven Seals have been open to us the whole word of God is completely open 100% open to us I love this being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise you know how it is when you invite strangers into your household you watch your stuff you don't just invite them to do anything and everything you watch them you give them limitations gentile people have one limitation after another but watch what he said having their the excuse me where he said uh uh strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope without God in the world that that's us that's right no hope we had no chance whatsoever of knowing god by intimacy or Fellowship but God Amen who was rich in Mercy I imagine some of them Jews did Jesus why would you have fellowship with this when a dog over here he said I found such great faith like this one over here this little sarapa woman this little Gentile girl she's got greater Faith than all y'all I one of you message people have got the faith this little girl I got right here that's what he told them why because God knew give it just a little bit of time and eventually the Gentile would come to their place to see who they really were yes sir but they looked down upon the Gentiles you know that it said that in the I think it's in the in the mission that if the Pharisees were walking down through the street and the shadow of a gentile laid upon them they would and had to wash their flesh in water cuz they were impure that's not Bible doctrine that was their Doctrine about the same foolishness you hear in message churches today amen praise the Lord anybody that's not bride we can't fellowship with him we can't talk to them we can't be nice to them oh you don't believe the message what I want to do with you you're an old Baptist you're an old Catholic what was you when God got a hold of you if you don't know the answer to that allow me to fill in the blank for you an alien a stranger to the [Applause] Commonwealth that's what I was that's what you was yes sir that's what you were rather watch here to Ephesians chapter 4 now verse 17 I love how Paul words this is one of my favorite ways he puts this I love the way he put words this this he said this I say therefore and testify in the Lord oh goody testify Paul tell us something you henceforth what not is other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind I love this statement right here cuz you realize that's the way it is when you start thinking like mblf thinks like he thought I should say past tense thought when you think like that boy thought you're thinking in vanity yeah when you go around say well I'll do this and I should be that and I should be better than this and I do this and ought to go to school and why did I go to school and why did I go to this place and why did I take that job do you understand everybody that is Vanity our Destinies and you listen to me good church our destiny is in the hands of God not ourselves we will be whatever our Potter wants to make us somebody say Amen we do not control our Destinies so to sit around and say well I'll do this and I'll do the Bible said if you say that say if the Lord be willing don't bind your soul or I'll do this and I'll do that say the Lord be willing I'll do it cuz my destiny is in the hands of God and for me to get so caught up in all of this I'll do this and I should be this that's Vanity Vanity is in their mind oh how we could take another hour on that right there huh notice at Verse 18 having the their the the understanding darkened darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart think of this they see if eyes but they can't see it their heart is so blinded they just constantly walk in darkness you ever see people like that they've got Ambitions they've made money they've been successful they've got plans they're going to do this and that and the other and everything that their mind is set on they're blind to see that when that's all over with their soul is still in Jeopardy I was thinking about it coming up the road all the years that the Lord's let me serve him what benefit would it be for me to have everything just so so in my life and wind up in Hell wind up in the regions of the lost to preach all these sermons and travel all these places and try to help the people of God my entire life have dedicated and committed to the service of God and come to the end of it and wind up in the regions of the Lost why would I want to trade myself over just to be known or have some kind of an image with people to be popular or some kind of a thing like that men of God don't seek such things like this we seek for one thing to do only that which pleases my father but so many have made merchandise out of the very thing we've given our lives for you like me have given your life for this truth you've had families stand against you you've had friends will forsake you you've taken persecution beating after beating for the sake of this message like me you have suffered just the same as I have what good would it be to come all the way up to the end of the road and wind up in hell because we're blinded to see the real picture cuz you see that's what was going on with MF he was just simply blinded to seeing who he was but God who was rich in Mercy Hallelujah say come here boy come here I've got a special seat right here for you we were alienated but before the world ever began God already had a seat he already had a place prepared let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me I go to prepare [Music] Colossians 1:21 let's go a bit further and let's quit believe it or not it's already 6 o00 and you that was sometime I like how he makes this personal you he wasn't talking to everybody he's talking to the elect here this letter is only for us on tape so to speak to my crowd my group that follows message would say brother brandham and you that were sometime alienated and just like M fibf here this boy was alienated and an enemy in his mind it's amazing to think that such a a mindset would be an enemy but it was cuz anytime David would ever say well you're a king son oh but I'm a dog oh but you you know you're Saul's grandson oh yes but I I'm I I live in loar yes but you know you you got your royalty yes but my name even means breathing shame that vanity is an enemy I hope you see what I'm saying to you alienated in our mind and enemies in our mind by Wicked Works yet now half he reconciled now you see when God reconciled it was at Calvary of course but when you reconcile something you also solve the problem and the problem in our mind was we were full of vanity so it's appropriate in the very last part of the church age what brother called The Mind age to come down and use the message to change our minds right about who we are oh my God somebody somebody you should have got a hold of that one why would that be important you say it's not important yes it is brother Ben said when the bride knows who she is then the Rapture will come and he'll take us away out of here hallelujah so if you don't know who you are my FF there you go you're holding up the Rapture until that day comes hallu praise the Lord somebody and watch us again in law and Grace brother says I hope you see it it isn't whether you're good enough to be a Christian or not but it's whether he was good enough if God accepted him and his blood makes an atonement God don't see you hallelujah oh glory to God you see when the blood was sprayed for that lamb all of that altar it painted it didn't just paint that one spot at the altar but it created this Blood spr this pain over all of Israel that when God looked down at any of them red on red created [Applause] white he looked down through the red sins and looked down through that red animal blood of that red animal and when they look down at all Israel he saw them as being pure clean white and it didn't matter it didn't matter it didn't matter it didn't matter what was laying inside of Israel when that paint painted it painted what it painted woo glory god don't see you he sees the lamb here's another type of this in Leviticus 16: 89 and 10 the Bible refers to the scapegoat the scapegoat was in fact the sins was laid upon this scapegoat and the set was set free in the wilderness now that represented one thing when it was set free in the wilderness and it went out into the Wilderness it represented that jesus carried my sins as far as the East is from the West so in this chapter in Leviticus when you go back and read this later tonight and when you study Leviticus 16 you got to look at this scapegoat right here remember that the scapegoat carried them away but the scapegoat never brought them [Music] back maybe you didn't get it let's put it another way way the scapegoat carried the sins out of Israel never brought them back into Israel jesus carried my sins away but he never return return glory to God hallelujah but he never returned them to me once my sins are gone they're gone they'll never come back again hallelujah oh I know what you're thinking but what about when do it again then he carries it again what about if I do it again then he carries it again what if you do it again then he carries it again W glory to God Woo is Right amen whoever that was Woo is Right Hallelujah right exactly right he carries them out hallu I love this B says and that was me William brandham you know I wish the people that every word he said was thus sayith the Lord I wish they would quote this little Dandy right here William brandham no good not fit to live WHYY to go to hell born in a sinful family raised a sinner no good at all not one sound part about me say what he said say what he said how can they make in deity and read this how can you make this man infallible and he say these words sir I want you to watch how brother bam handles this though because you see I'm stopping here for a moment to introduce this to you there's a collection of people in the message and I'll say message people because that's what we're dealing with they're all around everywhere but especially around the ranks of the message I meet these people all the time that love the scandal of being bad they fall in love with the idea of I'm a sinner I'm no good I'm sorry I'm worthless you see that gets them a lot of attention from people when they can constantly be broken right woo it got quiet in here true remember brother B said when somebody is always seeking attention there's a spiritual sickness in there somewhere some people don't want to be healed of their sicknesses right I'm sure there was probably some that Jesus went to go heal and and maybe they say who oh Jesus don't touch me I draw a check every month [Music] I know there's some people that fall in love with that Low debar Mentality I've been to prayer meetings and hear them pray 45 minutes they go Lord I'm scum I'm good for nothing I'm worthless the whole world is going to hell in a hand basket we're all doomed for Destruction and spend five minutes maybe 5 Seconds saying Thank You Lord thank you for your mercy Praise Jesus but the world is Fallen apart and insurent SE everywhere and we y'all reckon if we switch that around how will we be better or worse what do y'all think if we spent more like 45 minutes saying Lord thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for all the good things you've done thank you for not leaving me alone when I felt alone thank you for not forsaken me when I felt forsaken thank you for not walking out of me when I was at my wor thank you for coming the Lord of and pulling me back up into the high mountain of praise but some people love this kind of attention the worse they can make it the better they feel they're addicted to that kind of attention so you'll watch them they never can fix nothing and if you fix it I know this is a preacher of 33 years if you fix it they'll break something else I work with a with a person for close to 10 years 10 years this person nearly half my life when I when I first met him I was just in my 20s I work from this person with this person from a boy up the time I started preaching at 14 all the way up to nearly 24 25 years old I work with this brother work with this brother work with this brother and right when I would solve one problem something else would pop up you ever play that little game with the little hedgehogs or whoever and you you and you bunk one and then come on now that's the way some people are you solve one problem they'll invent 10 more more cuz they love living in low to Bar they love the feeling that they get when they I'm just a dog I'm a flea I'm a worm but now if you watch the way brother Bram handles this he says these things about himself and he comes to a point he stops very next two three four sentences he says that's right but one day [Applause] I accept it Hallelujah he says when God looked down on Christ and Christ took my place then God don't see me he sees the perfect one so you see brother there's a line you can say yes I was a sinner yes I was no good but one day that's one of my favorite words in the whole Bible I've been blessed off that one word more than any word I can think of whenever you'd say well the world was going to be Smitten by a curse but in the days of the voice of the Hallelujah I was on my way to he alienated from the very Fellowship of God by God who was rich in Mercy so we got to learn the line there's a line we don't cross you go so far into it and then you stop and now you got to start realizing okay I may have been myf but I'm also sitting at David's table now I'm not going to micromanage how you do this as a preacher but I'm just going to tell you you need to be Discerning about what comes out of this big fat thing right here between your lips it's whether you realize or not this sound fire of hell it's a troublemaker life and death LS right here in this [Music] thing praise God m listen to this the message called the 10 virgins now brother randam is going to the story of Jesus his crucifixion and and he stops and he says oh I was that barabus I was the one that deserved to die and he took my place I I thought on this and I thought to myself what what what must have been like I tried to visualize in my mind what that must have looked like for this man here he's in prison chains around him he he's he's done nothing but condition himself to be hung on a cross to be crucified soon with the rest of those those other two thieves the one that got saved cuz you know God had that predestinated plan sitting there cuz the one Thief was the one on the left he pardon wasn't it was the left side the one was on the left didn't need a barabus the one on the left left needed to Jesus and the only way to get that Jesus in there was somebody had to trade places you imagine they had websites in that day how unfair message people would have been all over the place saying I can't believe they done Jesus the way they' done him they' have been tweeting they'd have been instagramming they would have been all kind they' been FaceTiming one another you ain't going to believe look up here on the mountain look how good but God's plan sometimes comes in ways we don't expect it and hear this man no doubt here's the commotion down the hallway and big burly Roman soldiers come down their armor clinking as they want and that little feeling where your arteries jump you know when you get scared that must have gripped him as blood pressure of M started raising up he heard his heart beat in his ears his mouth goes immediately dry and every muscle in his body starts trembling he goes in almost a nervous cataclysmic and these guards come walking down they hear the key Jam in the lock they come walking in through the door this big guy maybe a big beard like I got and come walk down look at him and say you're free maybe he would have you don't play with me now you telling jokes what what do you mean I'm free you're having fun with me right the last hours of my life now you're making fun of me Barabbas if it was up to me you'd be rotten on that hill in a matter of 12 hours but you see right down come here come here come look down this hallway down here you see that man standing down there with that purple robe on him at crown of thorns on his head he just took your place in this thing [Music] Hallelujah maybe Barabbas will say but was guilty of course you are I caught you in the ACT I deserve to die sure you do but according to the law we have to set one prisoner free and the people called for that man down there to take your place Hall that's the way we were alienated from God enemy in are Mind by Wicked works we deserve to die but all of a sudden we heard King David say come the Fe come [Music] this is how amazing the blood of Christ is for us in a private interview that brother B has with sister Bruce before she before he preaches U Masterpiece he sits down with this woman they tape this it's about 20-minute interview something like that and sister Bruce is concerned about her soul and where she's going and all these things is any Christian Wood b b tells you he's watched her life he says sister Bruce you're okay but then he encourages he encourages her with these words listen to this we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through [Music] us it's Christ talking through us to God therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christian hallelujah thank [Music] you C can you not understand that this is why when you take the very word of God upon your lips it's the same as deity speaking yes and when you ask in faith yes not a miss not missing any one thing but you ask on the foundation of faith of God in FA faith of God's word and you've got trust and faith in God's word and you ask something in faith you say Lord Jesus I'm sick in my body I need healing a healing touch from you Lord I I'm troubled about my family I need to touch from you Lord we need to move in our finances Lord we need to move in our our our our our home we need to move in this job situation we we need to move do you realize when you're asking that it's your voice but it's Christ blood and then God recognizes it as though it's God talking to himself oh my God I shouldn't have started this we're going to be here another 30 minutes I keep going that's how the Rapture is going to be that kind of a mystery to us you'll be standing there looking in the mirror previewing what you see man I'm getting old and you know how you doing I found one gray hair up here the other day before I got my hair cut one Gray hair right there it took me 5 days to get over it and I said and I said oh God I'm getting [Laughter] old one of these days you'll be stand there looking in the mirror amen you'll feel that anointing fall over you it's time for the Rapture and you will speak amen change isn't that what he said would be the message would be the shout and the message would also produce a voice the voice of the resurrection and that voice of God that voice of the Resurrection is going to be in here whether you realize it or not you'll be the one that will speak your very change that's right I It Won't Be You Hallelujah to God it'll be your voice but it'll be Christ's blood it'll be your voice but it'll be his life that's how a man or woman preacher or not you don't have to be a preacher for this that's how a man or woman with the Holy Ghost in them can lay their hand on somebody and say Satan move that's the TR and the devil's got to take leave why cuz it ain't them it's their voice but it's Christ's blood thank you Jesus so my CH get up from there amen you're not a dog you're a King's [Applause] [Music] son thank you Jesus let's pray together thank you Lord Lord Jesus you you have been so good to us [Music] Lord
