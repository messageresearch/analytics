[24:32] if you like take your seats you can take
[24:35] your seats if you like I we'll call you
[24:37] back shortly I'm not
[24:44] going this morning I had to run out
[24:47] early to pick up something and as I was
[24:50] coming
[24:51] back a thought come to
[24:53] me and when I looked at it is in align
[24:56] with something that I've been looking at
[24:57] the last couple weeks or
[24:59] more and it was the
[25:03] purpose each one of us have a purpose
[25:05] here this
[25:06] morning and you wonder why I'm here or
[25:09] you're here but we're here for a purpose
[25:13] and it's God's purpose yes there you go
[25:16] I mean many times we talk about why do
[25:20] we have mosquitoes what is the
[25:22] purpose why do we have this insect why
[25:24] do we have that animal why do we have
[25:26] this pest but they're all for purpose
[25:29] but that's just in the natural purpose
[25:32] what about our
[25:33] lives we all ever
[25:36] purpose and I I
[25:38] uh I uh I was looking at it and I I
[25:41] looked up what the
[25:43] purpose a short general purpose for a
[25:47] Believer we are to be made alive in
[25:50] Christ yes sir to be
[25:54] transformed not
[25:56] conformed we don't come to a church or
[25:59] go to a group to be conformed to we be
[26:02] transformed in Jesus in
[26:05] Christ and and by God's grace through
[26:08] faith and to do good
[26:11] works God prepared in advance for them
[26:14] to do and there's some there's some
[26:16] scriptures there um we go to
[26:25] Ephesians e e Ephesians uh
[26:38] two and we go start at the verse two
[26:43] we're in time past ye walked according
[26:46] to the course of this world that's in
[26:49] the
[26:50] past we don't look back in the past as
[26:54] we see what Lot's wife did when she
[26:56] looked back she got caught up and that
[26:58] was was it we don't look back we got to
[27:00] keep looking ahead looking ahead to the
[27:03] prince of powers of the air the
[27:06] spirit and worketh in the children of
[27:09] obedience amongst those those also who
[27:13] we are at our conversation in times past
[27:17] that lust of the
[27:19] flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[27:22] Flesh and of our mind and we nature of
[27:25] the children and Wrath of others so in
[27:28] past we
[27:30] were doing whatever the world do but God
[27:34] put a new mind in
[27:36] us a new spirit he created a new heart
[27:39] in the Believers and put a new spirit in
[27:41] them and so this morning as I was
[27:43] looking and says wow how amazing is is
[27:48] that uh line up with a Christian
[27:53] Life a Christian
[27:56] Life many people
[27:59] as we all know most of us here worked
[28:01] out in the in the city in the town and
[28:04] you meet
[28:05] people and they say they're a
[28:09] Christian you look and you say
[28:12] wow a
[28:14] Christian I didn't think a Christian did
[28:17] those things I didn't think a Christian
[28:20] act that
[28:24] way but to the world
[28:28] that's what a Christian is to
[28:31] them if they could do good works and if
[28:34] better junor talked to somebody at his
[28:36] work and say like we had we heard the
[28:39] week about the
[28:41] tornado and and they said I'm going to
[28:43] give you some money to go towards it
[28:45] that's their good works i' done a good
[28:47] part but then they go off and drink and
[28:49] smoke and swear and live like the world
[28:52] but they did a good part that's a
[28:54] Christian in their eyes but that's not a
[28:57] Christian with God he change us he
[29:00] transform
[29:01] us and in Romans 12:4
[29:05] and8 you could look when you look at
[29:07] when you look at all this as we got some
[29:09] ministers here brothers that study you
[29:12] start looking at one thing and something
[29:13] else comes and something and it all ties
[29:15] back everything goes back to to to the
[29:20] to the word and and and and we got first
[29:23] and whole first testament old testament
[29:26] and and brother B said that's
[29:29] binoculars and he take it and you look
[29:30] to two of them you don't look to one we
[29:32] don't go back to the law we don't go
[29:34] ahead we can look at two and right in
[29:36] the middle what is it cross ears there a
[29:40] cross and that's where we're hanging
[29:42] there on the cross amen we got we got to
[29:45] put that all together in
[29:47] perspective so in Romans 12:4 and8 it
[29:51] says for as we have members in one body
[29:54] and all members have not the same office
[29:58] so we've been many are one body in
[30:01] Christ and everyone members one another
[30:06] having them gifts differently according
[30:09] to the grace that is given to us whether
[30:12] prophecy Let It Be prophecy according to
[30:16] the prision of your faith and faith I
[30:19] looked at it the faith look is the first
[30:22] one we have to build on faith if we skip
[30:26] faith and we go through knowledge we're
[30:28] missing we have to start on faith and go
[30:32] all the way up till we get to brotherly
[30:34] kindness and then we get the holy spirit
[30:36] in is love so as we're building all
[30:39] these up we are getting love in our in
[30:43] ourselves and teach and then the faith
[30:45] uh your ministry or let us wait on our
[30:48] ministry that's right or let that teach
[30:52] be
[30:54] teaching or exort give exhortation he
[30:58] that giveth let him do it with
[31:00] Simplicity not be big amongst us and say
[31:03] I know more than you and I'm better than
[31:05] you and I could preach better and I
[31:07] could remember everything better I don't
[31:10] care really if I don't remember but I
[31:13] know the author and I got him in here
[31:17] and what I need to know at the time I'm
[31:19] talking he will putting it out when I
[31:21] need it at the time Hallelujah so then
[31:24] we'll go in foot chair and then we got
[31:26] to it says there
[31:28] let him do simply and simply he that
[31:32] ruleth diligently he that showeth Mercy
[31:35] with cheerfulness who we was just a
[31:38] thought come to me when we were singing
[31:40] a song and it's still here I think Mercy
[31:44] God's
[31:45] mercy and you imagine today if we were
[31:48] judged by a
[31:50] man we' be all lost and through aside
[31:54] man's ideas Al all man will see what's
[31:57] in front of him
[31:58] but God sees down here in here every
[32:02] part of our bodies and that's how he
[32:04] judges us he knows our heart he knows
[32:07] our mind so in the scripture he says
[32:11] show it show it Mercy with cheerfulness
[32:14] so we have to show Mercy to our brothers
[32:16] and sisters we don't know what's going
[32:18] on in our brother and sister's heart we
[32:20] don't know the brother and sisters p and
[32:23] we don't need to know their past we just
[32:25] need to look and say wow my brother and
[32:27] sisters come to church and I see a
[32:28] difference in them that's good enough
[32:30] that's all we need to
[32:31] see and Paul speaks in in Romans after
[32:34] he says a simple Christian Life based on
[32:38] how we treat each other around us within
[32:41] the body of Believers so we are a
[32:44] Believer now we don't we don't say just
[32:48] us four no more no we are believers
[32:51] there but there's Believers outside in
[32:53] our towns in the cities and other places
[32:56] that most of us have met that came we
[32:59] have to treat them the same and in
[33:01] return they will treat you you be you be
[33:04] salty and they will
[33:08] see within the body of Believers in the
[33:11] chapters proceeding chapter 8th in the
[33:14] Book of Romans he writes of
[33:16] justification righteousness and many
[33:18] other different things in chapter 8 he
[33:21] speaks of an indwelling Spirit of Christ
[33:24] after one being born again so that
[33:26] indwelling I looked at me dwelling is
[33:28] something come in Christ's life Christ
[33:33] life don't come in
[33:35] you you're not going to you're not going
[33:37] to live Christ life you're not going to
[33:39] have Christ attitude you're not going to
[33:42] have the Christ uh Behavior yes it it it
[33:47] it little little something when I was
[33:50] looking came up this if I had a a a
[33:53] glass with liquid into it and somebody
[33:55] bumped into me liquid came out why did
[33:59] that liquid come out not because someone
[34:01] bumped into me because I had liquid into
[34:03] it okay so we as brothers and sisters if
[34:06] I rub my brother Dale wrong way what's
[34:09] in him going to come out is he going to
[34:11] come after me with a rod and Har or he
[34:15] going to say that's okay my brother I'm
[34:16] sorry see our attitude toward each other
[34:19] are we rub each other how we talk to
[34:21] each other we whatever is inside of us
[34:24] will come out if we got that Spirit of
[34:26] Christ it would come out
[34:28] and we'll behave right way towards each
[34:31] other if not he's no good he's this he's
[34:35] that and tell everybody about that wrong
[34:38] brother Adam said in the word says you
[34:39] nothing good to say to anybody say
[34:41] nothing that's right better to say
[34:45] nothing so then in chapter 8 in dwelling
[34:49] spirit so that's what's inside must come
[34:51] out that's and this is a this is a
[34:54] purpose this is possible if we modify in
[34:58] Deeds of this flesh so this flesh we
[35:02] have to cut off this flesh the human
[35:05] flesh is enmity to Christ doing through
[35:08] the spirit so we got that spirit in us
[35:11] that nature
[35:13] flesh we are humans we can't forget that
[35:18] we will fail but God don't see us our
[35:23] failers what the devil do it'll work on
[35:27] you
[35:28] and he'll tell you you're no good tell
[35:30] you you're not a
[35:31] Christian it'll say everything to you
[35:34] negative but the word is
[35:39] positive and the through the spirit in
[35:42] the 12th chapter it begin to speak about
[35:44] important aspects of Christian Living
[35:46] wow Christian Living how do we
[35:49] live we don't go every day it's nothing
[35:52] there is some people I've heard say you
[35:56] got dos and don'ts I don't like your
[35:58] church our church we could do what we
[36:01] like well I don't think that's a
[36:03] Christian church and I don't have no dos
[36:06] and don'ts either I don't think anybody
[36:08] here if you do you bet you could come
[36:10] and talk to the pastor or ministers and
[36:12] see where the dos and don'ts it's not
[36:13] dos and don'ts it's God's purpose how he
[36:16] set things out God has a purpose for
[36:18] everything and he has set everything up
[36:20] and we have to follow
[36:22] that and oh I don't have to pay tithes
[36:25] yes you do have to pay ties because God
[36:27] said it yeah I don't have to wash my
[36:28] brother's feet Yes just not those things
[36:30] are not over the Millennium is not here
[36:33] we're not pass we're still in this in
[36:37] this
[36:38] life which Christ have us here for a
[36:41] purpose and are still things that we
[36:43] still have to
[36:45] do thank you Lord a Christian aspects of
[36:48] a Christian Living that ye knew should
[36:51] be particular focus on able to live a
[36:54] simple Christian Life yes within the
[36:58] Spirit now I'm not picking on nobody in
[37:01] particular but he also speaks with the
[37:03] ministers he
[37:05] said he talks ministers and members of
[37:09] the Bride so we got ministers and we got
[37:10] members of the Bride we're all together
[37:13] we're all together nothing is accepted
[37:16] from nobody this word didn't come just
[37:18] for brother brandom and do what he like
[37:21] or just for the ministers or just no it
[37:23] came for whosoever be he knew would be
[37:26] for everybody and and the bride who prly
[37:29] parts to play in the body of Christ so
[37:32] we are a body and we all parts to play
[37:35] one of the most important aspects of a
[37:37] human body using it example this is as
[37:40] example con consisted behavior and if
[37:44] you really don't believe me what I'm
[37:46] going to say we have a sister here that
[37:48] is a registered nurse and you got to ask
[37:50] her about it sister Ruth what I'm going
[37:52] to say the
[37:54] Earth should not be pumping o oxygen
[37:58] isn't that right heart pumps blood
[38:01] that's right so a heart should not be
[38:03] pumping oxygen but the lungs pump hair
[38:08] because it's focus on pumping that what
[38:10] the lungs get rest of the body simply
[38:13] putting everything in the body abides in
[38:16] its place so everything add to be in its
[38:19] place saying our human bodies we got a
[38:21] mind we got eyes ears we got a heart we
[38:23] got lungs and everything is to work same
[38:26] thing in the body
[38:28] Christ's body just as we are Christ we
[38:31] all have to be in our place and we must
[38:35] know our
[38:37] place the body functions smoothly you
[38:40] get somebody at a
[38:42] place
[38:44] uhoh we got a problem
[38:47] here but if we could
[38:49] discern and
[38:51] see and we'll go back to what I said if
[38:55] something is in you and somebody speaks
[38:58] to you about something if you got the
[39:00] Holy Spirit you will say Amen brother
[39:04] that's true we'll look into that we'll
[39:06] see that yeah he got a need this one got
[39:09] a need the little ones got a need the
[39:12] older ones got a need we got elderly
[39:14] that got
[39:16] needs I mean the town itself will say
[39:19] check on your neighbor it's so
[39:21] hot we don't need the town to tell us
[39:23] that should be automatically in our
[39:26] hearts we got sister Joanie sister Donna
[39:29] that's living by herself no disrespect
[39:31] to Sister Linda she lives by her G he
[39:33] should take care of her he should know
[39:36] she needs air condition but we got
[39:38] elderly sisters just a simple phone call
[39:41] and you would tell
[39:43] hey thank you you know what that leads
[39:46] to your brother's keeper and just
[39:49] because it says Brother's Keeper that
[39:50] don't mean we can't leave we got to
[39:52] leave his sisters sister Patricia same
[39:54] thing sister patty just a simple phone
[39:58] call well it say brother Brother's
[40:01] Keeper this way it said is I looked it
[40:04] up brother and sister and young
[40:08] ones if I go in that awe and I see a
[40:11] young one that's sad or you see a young
[40:13] one is s you go over and you talk to
[40:15] them and you encourage him you're the
[40:16] Brother's
[40:17] Keeper you'll say I'll be praying for
[40:19] you sister brother even our young ones
[40:23] we be praying for you yes so we have to
[40:27] we have to function together and the
[40:30] body is smoothly because every organ has
[40:32] a special part to play and continue in
[40:36] in the spirit and we have special
[40:38] talents gifts are given to each one to
[40:42] benefit God's
[40:45] kingdom sometimes it takes a little
[40:47] longer to find your specific gift or
[40:50] talent but if there's but it's there
[40:54] whever it may be let us do as the
[40:57] commands us to say that Paul has placed
[40:59] us within placed us without dismission
[41:03] dis and that word and I'm saying it
[41:05] right but it means without quirrel
[41:08] without
[41:09] fuss so we must not fuss with each other
[41:12] over this and
[41:14] that I mean brother a brother told me
[41:17] one time he seen a church but over the
[41:19] color of the carpet that's
[41:22] Colonel we don't need
[41:25] colonel colonel got a goal
[41:27] yes yes sir got to get behind us Satan
[41:30] get behind us but that's carel too much
[41:33] carel got to
[41:35] go in Corinthians 1 sorry Corinthians 7
[41:39] and 20 1 Corinthians 7:20 if we do this
[41:43] when God can do great things through us
[41:46] if we are at a
[41:48] place then we're only enter the Holy
[41:50] Spirit ability to
[41:53] move let us do what we can do by
[41:57] faith we have to build on the basics is
[42:02] faith
[42:03] faith and we have to do it simply and we
[42:07] have to be omly and let us work and dig
[42:11] dig and cheerfully be careful about it
[42:16] in the role of God has called us if
[42:18] you're a
[42:19] housewife you be a good housewife sister
[42:22] you're a housewife you got five little
[42:23] children you do your best and God will
[42:26] help you but Junior you're a farmer you
[42:29] do your best your wife is away but you
[42:32] do your best and God will bless you same
[42:35] with any other any other brother
[42:37] benard's a mechanic do his best sister L
[42:40] Ronda works in the home sister Ruth the
[42:43] guy has a special job teaching the de
[42:46] with
[42:47] ANS not anybody could do that but that's
[42:50] her purpose in life that's her gift and
[42:54] God will use her and we all have the do
[42:57] it according to and don't try to do each
[43:00] other's gift we can't do each other's
[43:02] gift we're going to
[43:04] interfere I can't do sign language but I
[43:06] can read lips but that's still no good
[43:08] to those
[43:10] children I could read lips cuz I'm I'm
[43:12] I'm death from one ear and just one ear
[43:14] is down and when you're talking I'm
[43:16] looking at you I'm looking at your lips
[43:18] to see what you're trying to say to me
[43:21] so that is
[43:22] mine but each one has a place and and in
[43:27] 57 brother Bron preached he says water
[43:31] from the
[43:33] rock just simply by grace are you saved
[43:37] through faith see we're going back to
[43:39] Faith every time we go back to the
[43:43] basics to the ABCs and if we don't have
[43:47] the
[43:48] ABCs everything else is going
[43:51] to be messed up by grace are we saved
[43:55] through faith we will trust try to
[43:58] mystify it and have all kinds of seen
[44:01] lights and signs sirens and everything
[44:05] and all kinds of things to get the
[44:07] people saved maybe someone see did see
[44:11] it but that don't mean all as to see
[44:15] it you just believe it that's it and God
[44:19] has his
[44:21] programmed and he will let you set you
[44:24] in place in you in Christ and yes he
[44:28] thinks you are the best for him but
[44:30] wherever you are God will place you just
[44:33] for him if you are just to stay on your
[44:36] calling don't try to get in somebody
[44:39] else's calling stay in your own calling
[44:42] if
[44:43] you're there I am he's reading I'm
[44:45] reading it now again just what I just
[44:46] said if you're a housewife be a hous Bo
[44:50] that's right from the word this is the
[44:52] brother Brown this is from the
[44:54] word whatever God has called you to do
[44:57] just remain there he knows where to put
[45:00] his hands on you to use you so we we we
[45:05] are in in in in
[45:07] Christ and we have to be in Harmony and
[45:11] we have to stick together brother ROM
[45:14] said brother ROM said out in the front
[45:17] of the street you
[45:19] behave we're in the
[45:21] backyard we could we could ask things
[45:23] out and when I ask things out with my
[45:26] brother and in here that's the far as
[45:28] should go I don't need to go out and say
[45:30] well me and brother Jim just had it out
[45:32] and we're okay I don't need to tell you
[45:34] that but Jim don't need to tell you that
[45:37] that's under the
[45:39] blood once it's under the blood it stays
[45:41] there you take that out is worse again
[45:45] so just things that happened to us in
[45:46] the past go got to go got to go we don't
[45:49] need it no more the simple Christian
[45:52] Life should be just as simple life of
[45:54] you and God not you new and your friends
[45:58] not new and your
[46:00] neighbors if they're a Christian you
[46:03] could fellowship with them but the
[46:04] Christian should be have simple life
[46:06] with God living in harmony with
[46:10] everybody we got to live in harmony we
[46:12] have an enemy and the old world is
[46:15] consumed by that same enemy we got
[46:18] everybody got an enemy Christians and
[46:20] non-christians yes sir and thus the
[46:23] battle rages and it's getting worse
[46:26] every day
[46:27] you you listen to the news if you got
[46:30] time and if you don't have time it's
[46:32] okay cuz you're not missing nothing if
[46:34] you want to get into the word get into
[46:36] the Bible read that more and that stuff
[46:38] that just fade away you don't it's nice
[46:41] to know what's going on around you not
[46:43] to be stunned and stupid say oh I you
[46:45] know don't be like that there there's a
[46:46] certain point but you could get be taken
[46:48] up in that stuff so much that are just
[46:51] consume important
[46:54] things by that enemy and th we battle
[46:57] rages but in the art of all Christ Jesus
[47:01] has saved us redeemed us and filled us
[47:04] with his spirit and that is the simple
[47:07] truth God all things are possible even
[47:11] in a simple Christian
[47:13] Life he preached in
[47:16] 1956 the true and the false
[47:19] Vine so we got
[47:22] two look how we could begin them up how
[47:26] we could bring them up through that
[47:28] beautiful type
[47:30] Israel that they came out of Israel the
[47:32] children of Israel came out they were on
[47:35] their way into the promised
[47:37] land they were sojourning out there in
[47:40] their
[47:42] tents they came to the country of
[47:45] Moab this is from Brother Bram now you
[47:48] could you could read it it's in
[47:49] 1956 truth of
[47:53] Vine he came to Moab where he did spring
[47:56] bring forth where Moab bring forth from
[47:59] lot's daughters they were lot's
[48:04] daughters Child by their father now the
[48:08] mobites is not
[48:10] unbelievers the said they're not
[48:12] unbelievers they were worshippers of
[48:15] Jehovah God certainly they was they even
[48:19] had fine preachers over there and he had
[48:22] one B name of
[48:24] beab b a l a a am a
[48:29] prophet but like the
[48:31] whole lot of hiring prophets was money
[48:35] crazy we see that today worse more than
[48:38] ever brother said amen selling their
[48:41] gifts oh yeah and they're doing today
[48:44] just find gift get things out in the
[48:46] world to make money and it's disgrace
[48:49] compromising so we don't have no time
[48:51] for
[48:52] compromising we don't have no time for
[48:54] be on the borderline
[48:57] this is this like the the story with the
[48:59] man with the train he said g to the
[49:02] Hedge he said I driving this train he
[49:04] said I'm getting the far away from the
[49:05] edge as I can I'm way right in and and
[49:09] just come to me that story but Ram
[49:11] talked about it and it says there and
[49:13] doing today fine gift things out in the
[49:16] world making money it's a disgrace
[49:19] compromising borderline one day in the
[49:21] world and the next day in church now
[49:24] this is word it's not my words
[49:27] and and like I said you could read it
[49:29] yourself one day in church one day in
[49:32] the
[49:34] world or one day in the world when the
[49:36] church whichever way is wrong you can't
[49:39] do that you can't you can't sell out to
[49:43] be born
[49:44] again he says move plunge
[49:48] Inland so that well Inland Inland is in
[49:53] the Middle with the body don't be a on
[49:56] the on the head head with the body going
[49:58] and coming we have to get on the middle
[50:01] the
[50:02] inside stay far away he said from the
[50:09] borderline so it's just something that I
[50:13] mean striking me about a Christian
[50:16] Life and we do not have time to be
[50:20] mingle with the
[50:21] world we are so close now my brother to
[50:24] the end end of the road
[50:30] that time is soon be running out yes sir
[50:33] vam said over well in 60 65 years ago he
[50:37] says it's
[50:39] over how much closer Are We Now how much
[50:43] closer so if we are going to live a true
[50:47] Christian Life we need to line up with a
[50:51] true Christian Life we need to live that
[50:54] life we need to be our brothers on it's
[50:57] Christian Life yeah you behave you dress
[50:59] right you you talk right and you you
[51:02] hang with the right people that's a part
[51:04] of it like I said we can't be like lot
[51:08] wife and to be looking back and just
[51:09] complaining the back about what happened
[51:11] in the past we got to forget that we got
[51:14] to be our Brother's Keeper we got
[51:15] friends we got to help out we got to
[51:16] help each other we have so many
[51:18] different things and then then in as a
[51:22] Christian you have to go to
[51:24] church it says Ass some yourself as
[51:27] often now we have things going on we
[51:29] can't help that that's just that's
[51:31] that's
[51:33] life but we must center oursel
[51:38] around
[51:40] church church is the most important we
[51:43] got to work we got to
[51:45] live uh brother bar I got to give him
[51:49] got to give him credit he cannot get to
[51:52] church but when there's Church he's
[51:53] there when he's home he's there amen but
[51:56] that that's that's his lot that's his
[51:58] purpose to do that he may meet somebody
[52:00] somewhere God's going to use us for
[52:02] whatever we
[52:03] want I mean I don't know why God moved
[52:07] me from Newan all the way around right
[52:09] down oh a right back here and one trip
[52:12] down O A man seen me
[52:14] walk into a washroom and when I walked
[52:17] out he said you got a bad foot I never
[52:20] spoke to the man I just seen that he was
[52:22] putting fuel in the tanks I never spoke
[52:25] one word when I walked out he said
[52:27] excuse me he said you got a bad foot I
[52:29] said yes sir how you know that he said
[52:31] the Lord told me he said I want to pray
[52:33] for your foot he reached down he put his
[52:36] hand on my foot and he prayed he said
[52:38] how is it I said it's better he said no

[52:43] and he prayed again and I walked across
[52:45] the parking
[52:46] lot my foot was
[52:50] good but but that devil the devil came
[52:54] back again but now today

[1:01:02] that was that was really good amen amen
[1:01:05] God brings different gifts different

[1:01:09] different people and uh we I recognize I
[1:01:13] recognize that and and that's beautiful
[1:01:16] Matthew
[1:01:17] uh Matthew
[1:01:19] 116 and we're going to read John
[1:01:23] 13 and and going to you know know
[1:01:26] nobody's going to work this
[1:01:28] afternoon that's fairly cool in
[1:01:31] here and uh so I mean if we're a little
[1:01:35] bit longer today might be all right I
[1:01:39] believe it'd be all right man we we
[1:01:41] don't think twice of working overtime so
[1:01:44] man we always just want to thank God for
[1:01:46] being an awesome God and and and I I
[1:01:49] believe what brother Carson said you
[1:01:51] know we we're close to going home and
[1:01:53] and there's some you know we know the my
[1:01:55] Mysteries and that but there's some fine
[1:01:57] tuning in these Mysteries that we just
[1:02:00] need to just line up just a little bit
[1:02:02] and then he'll take us just just a
[1:02:04] little bit just a little fine tuning
[1:02:07] amen and I believe God started that with
[1:02:09] our what our brother shared and I mean
[1:02:12] it you're you're going to see you just
[1:02:14] watch how it D is
[1:02:16] amen amen Matthew 11:6 and blessed is he
[1:02:22] whosoever is not offended in me
[1:02:26] let's go to 1 John 1 and 3 these are all
[1:02:31] very very familiar scriptures and I've
[1:02:33] preached this on being offended
[1:02:35] different ways and and went different
[1:02:36] ways but but
[1:02:39] God has a plan and God has a thought
[1:02:43] that he wants to share with you today I
[1:02:46] believe that the bride of Christ in the
[1:02:49] past and maybe even up till today we
[1:02:52] will change today have been offended in
[1:02:54] Christ I have been offended in Christ
[1:02:57] and I'll show you
[1:02:58] how uh John
[1:03:01] 13 all things were made by him and
[1:03:06] without him was
[1:03:10] anything made Lord Jesus we pray that
[1:03:12] you bless the word to your people and
[1:03:14] may you just give them with strength to
[1:03:17] to hear from your throne today and and
[1:03:19] keep us together and bless the communion
[1:03:21] service after our fellowship in your
[1:03:23] name we pray bless all that are online
[1:03:26] and Lord we just pray that you'll come
[1:03:28] and and Minister your thought that
[1:03:30] you've laid on us today and thank you
[1:03:32] for our brother Sharon Lord Jesus and
[1:03:34] forgive us for not giving them the
[1:03:36] service and and just uh feeding on your
[1:03:39] word from your servant Lord Jesus but we
[1:03:42] pray that you'll lead us and guide us in
[1:03:43] your name we pray amen you may have your
[1:03:46] seats this morning you know in this
[1:03:48] scripture in Matthew here we see that
[1:03:50] John was in prison and John was the
[1:03:52] greatest Apostle of all because brother
[1:03:54] Bram said that he wasn't just the one
[1:03:56] that that that witness of Jesus but he
[1:03:59] was actually the one that came with
[1:04:01] Jesus and actually said there he is
[1:04:03] right there he was the one that
[1:04:05] introduced Jesus to the world and here
[1:04:07] we see John that was in prison so I mean
[1:04:10] he had physically walk touch Fellowship
[1:04:13] ate with
[1:04:14] Jesus baptized Jesus and with the they
[1:04:18] with with time and and cares of the
[1:04:21] world and and different things his eyes
[1:04:23] got so glazed over
[1:04:26] he wasn't sure if Jesus was Jesus amen
[1:04:30] and here Jesus says this amazing
[1:04:33] beatitude brother Brown calls it the
[1:04:34] blessed beatitude but I want to from a
[1:04:37] way of of you know Jesus said let's just
[1:04:41] say that again in Matthew 11:6 he said
[1:04:43] and blessed is he whosoever is not
[1:04:45] offended in me now every single one of
[1:04:48] you sitting here have been offended by
[1:04:50] your brother and sister in the
[1:04:52] past guarantee
[1:04:54] it and if you were offended by your
[1:04:56] brother and sister you were offended by
[1:04:59] Christ because our Prophet said this
[1:05:01] that it was God's choice to make you a a
[1:05:05] free moral agency it was God's choice to
[1:05:07] have me fail it was God's choice to have
[1:05:10] your kids fail it was God's choice to
[1:05:13] give you free moral agency and we love
[1:05:15] it when we're just nice little baby I go
[1:05:17] hold brother M and sister Abigail's baby
[1:05:19] and oh that's a great time and then we
[1:05:22] love it maybe on their wedding day and
[1:05:24] then we love it when they're making lot
[1:05:25] of money but we don't like it when they
[1:05:27] go through
[1:05:29] adolescent we don't like it when they're
[1:05:31] peeing the bed we don't like it when
[1:05:33] they get old and they slobber and spill
[1:05:35] their food all over them that's why we
[1:05:37] throw our old people in the old age home
[1:05:40] that's why we could care less about the
[1:05:41] young people when they change the life
[1:05:43] and come to
[1:05:45] adolescent you know what there is
[1:05:48] because we're
[1:05:52] offended you know why nobody takes care
[1:05:54] of their mommy and daddy when they're
[1:05:55] old is cu you're offended that they
[1:05:59] retell you the same story twice you know
[1:06:01] I got a thing here and it says talking
[1:06:03] about and I'll read this just to lay a
[1:06:05] foundation he said let your parents grow
[1:06:07] old and love them the way they loved you
[1:06:10] he said let them repeat the story over
[1:06:12] and over and over and over
[1:06:15] again because they let you say the same
[1:06:17] word a hundred million times and never
[1:06:20] swatted
[1:06:22] you let them fill the food all over you
[1:06:25] and spill the milk and make a terrible
[1:06:28] mess because they let you spill the MK
[1:06:30] and mess up the carpet and did they put
[1:06:33] you in the
[1:06:36] home you were
[1:06:38] offended because it messed up your
[1:06:41] program in God you know brother Bram
[1:06:44] said that we were the they were the
[1:06:45] attributes of God and God chose to make
[1:06:49] you a free moral agency because he was a
[1:06:51] savior he was a Healer he was a provider
[1:06:55] he was all these things and the only way
[1:06:57] he can be those attributes is for to
[1:06:59] fall down that's right you don't want a
[1:07:02] pastor that falls down then God can't
[1:07:04] even
[1:07:13] be fix your messed up life you just want
[1:07:15] them to fill your bank
[1:07:19] account amen and so we go through all
[1:07:22] these different stages of life and if we
[1:07:25] get if we have eternal life we came from
[1:07:27] God CU he's the only form of eternal
[1:07:29] life so we are God sitting here we are
[1:07:32] God as an adolesent this morning we are
[1:07:34] God that don't know how to talk yet
[1:07:36] we're God that knows how to shut up
[1:07:40] yet we're God that tells the same story
[1:07:43] 10,000
[1:07:45] times and that was God's
[1:07:47] choice and it was beautiful in his
[1:07:50] flower
[1:07:51] garden that's why he has all different
[1:07:53] nationalities you know this is going to
[1:07:55] actually be a worldwide bride do you
[1:07:57] know I'm going to tell you something
[1:07:58] that'll shock you this morning it won't
[1:07:59] just be the Wyoming Church in heaven we
[1:08:02] won't just be the only ones that go
[1:08:05] up oh that's going to shock you you know
[1:08:07] there will be people that do things
[1:08:09] different than us and we will be
[1:08:11] offended by it because we won't like it
[1:08:15] but that was an attribute and a thought
[1:08:19] of
[1:08:21] God God thought of somebody being fat
[1:08:24] God thought of somebody being small God
[1:08:26] thought of somebody being
[1:08:29] old and the beauty of the
[1:08:34] Bride is in the
[1:08:38] beholder you picked your
[1:08:40] bride because you loved her and Christ
[1:08:44] picked you because he loved you he
[1:08:47] didn't ask for the Pope's permission or
[1:08:50] the denomination to Mission he didn't
[1:08:52] ask for the church or the pastor even
[1:08:53] the FF Ministries position so that's why
[1:08:56] people like Paul that went around
[1:08:57] butchering people God said I chose him
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:05] hallelujah amen this right up continues
[1:09:08] to go he said let let your old parents
[1:09:11] enjoy life let them enjoy their friends
[1:09:13] let them enjoy the things that they feel
[1:09:15] comfortable with let them stay in the
[1:09:17] home that they've always been
[1:09:20] in because they let you stay in the home
[1:09:23] that you were comfortable with maybe
[1:09:25] this School you were comfortable with
[1:09:27] and brought the friends over that you
[1:09:31] liked
[1:09:34] uh-huh
[1:09:37] offended let them end their Journey with
[1:09:41] the pleasure that they tried to give you
[1:09:45] in the
[1:09:46] beginning of your
[1:09:53] journey h
[1:09:56] offended we're offended if somebody
[1:09:58] makes noise in church the minister is
[1:10:00] offended if nobody does make and makes
[1:10:02] no noise in church we're offended if
[1:10:05] somebody talks all the time we're
[1:10:06] offended if they don't talk we don't
[1:10:09] understand adolescent we don't
[1:10:11] understand sisters we don't un we don't
[1:10:14] understand
[1:10:15] God God made God was a feminine part God
[1:10:20] was an adolescent God was a
[1:10:23] baby uh-huh
[1:10:26] and see it's not just that you're
[1:10:28] offended at the word if you're came from
[1:10:31] God then you are God do you know the
[1:10:33] prophet said and I have this thing here
[1:10:34] that God Made You God amateur Gods on
[1:10:37] the world and you can speak it into
[1:10:39] existence you don't have to pray if you
[1:10:42] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:10:43] know exactly what God
[1:10:45] wants you just say God boom I'm going to
[1:10:49] come mind my week today it's going to be
[1:10:51] tomorrow and it ain't going to
[1:10:53] rain huh brother Carson talked about
[1:10:56] faith one body it's one person you know
[1:10:59] where's Christ it's Christ is sitting
[1:11:01] right here but we got this religious
[1:11:05] Hollywood perception that we we got to
[1:11:08] look up to pray to Christ come on when
[1:11:11] you could maybe look down to little
[1:11:12] Curtis or or little you know an or
[1:11:16] little amen Alice or
[1:11:20] something
[1:11:24] uhhuh it's it's sad that the body of
[1:11:26] Christ can't even dwell in one place and
[1:11:29] one time it's sad that we're cutting off
[1:11:32] toes and fingers and ears and we're like
[1:11:34] Peter we we think we're defending the
[1:11:37] message of the hour and we're cutting
[1:11:38] off the Serpent's ears and butchering
[1:11:40] people the same time God's coming behind
[1:11:43] trying to heal what we're messing up and
[1:11:46] we say we got the spirit of Christ watch
[1:11:49] this it's a
[1:11:51] misplaced thought it's a misplaced uh
[1:11:54] comp passion it's a
[1:11:57] misinterpretation of what God is it is
[1:12:00] let me show you something watch this he
[1:12:03] said where are we never respect people
[1:12:05] when they're alive you're too busy to
[1:12:08] help me do
[1:12:10] anything
[1:12:12] amen we never open doors for people we
[1:12:16] never say please or thank
[1:12:19] you we definitely ain't going to help
[1:12:21] you
[1:12:23] move amen we don't celebrate birthdays
[1:12:26] or retirements or old age or or
[1:12:30] anniversaries or nothing well we're
[1:12:31] we're Way Beyond that we're
[1:12:34] mature we got the Holy Ghost we don't
[1:12:38] celebrate achievements of the bride of
[1:12:40] Christ do you know the Bible says that
[1:12:42] when one weep we all weep but it says
[1:12:45] something else too it says when one
[1:12:48] rejoices because they got something
[1:12:51] really nice on this Earth You know the
[1:12:52] Bible says that I know the thoughts that
[1:12:54] I have toward you thoughts to prosper to
[1:12:57] be good and health
[1:13:00] Deliverance so somebody gets a raise or
[1:13:03] gets a good job or retires or buys a new
[1:13:05] car
[1:13:06] and PR God there
[1:13:09] Rel but you just let that same person
[1:13:15] die

[1:15:07] the prophet said and I I'm not reading
[1:15:09] these quotes but I have them in front of
[1:15:10] me just to save time that we were his
[1:15:13] attributes and I want to tell you he
[1:15:15] said I want I'm just reading some short
[1:15:18] highlights he said these things were to
[1:15:20] be that way you were an attribute of God
[1:15:24] he said God made him so that his great
[1:15:26] attributes could be displayed that's
[1:15:29] right that was
[1:15:30] adolesent that was when I was throwing
[1:15:32] up or pee in the

[1:17:02] the ones that haven't even manifested
[1:17:03] that they are brothers and sisters yet
[1:17:05] because they still are brothers and
[1:17:06] sisters because the seeds planted in
[1:17:07] there from for the foundation of the
[1:17:09] world he said you nevered to serve God
[1:17:11] God already had chosen you so I'm
[1:17:14] offended because the ones haven't came
[1:17:16] to God yet you may have be offended
[1:17:19] because your kids are going Wayward and
[1:17:20] it's exactly God's plan and you don't
[1:17:23] like it
[1:17:31] unbelievable wow he said he made things
[1:17:34] this way God made it so that the
[1:17:36] attributes would be displayed he said if
[1:17:38] there wasn't this he said he never would
[1:17:40] have had a choice the opportunity to be
[1:17:43] a savior he would have never had an
[1:17:45] opportunity to do these things that's in
[1:17:47] marriage and divorce he said in the
[1:17:49] beginning was was life and it was
[1:17:51] eternal the the Eternal one and his
[1:17:54] attributes and these attributes became
[1:17:56] word and now they became our our
[1:18:01] flesh
[1:18:03] amen hallelujah I I I need to slow down
[1:18:06] to read this who is this Jesus he said
[1:18:09] he W as he was Emmanuel he was a
[1:18:12] self-existent one and he wasn't even God
[1:18:14] then but in him was attributes that was
[1:18:17] brother Dale with all of my
[1:18:20] failures that was the kids with all of
[1:18:23] their failures that was the teenagers
[1:18:26] with all of their
[1:18:28] failures that's what God planned now
[1:18:30] watch this this you got you got to catch
[1:18:32] this he
[1:18:33] said such as your thoughts see your
[1:18:37] thoughts I've seen something and then I
[1:18:39] think of it he said then speaking the
[1:18:41] word of thought expressed and so in the
[1:18:43] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:18:44] with God and the Word was expressed and
[1:18:47] that's who we are this morning he said
[1:18:50] and and now all the same the same we are
[1:18:52] born again and we got eternal life
[1:18:54] there's only one form of eternal life we
[1:18:56] know that and he said now now can I talk
[1:18:58] among
[1:19:00] Christians would that be
[1:19:02] okay he said we are his
[1:19:06] attributes and Jesus came as a redeemer
[1:19:10] and many believes that but a redeemer is
[1:19:13] not to
[1:19:14] create something
[1:19:18] new when you get converted you're not
[1:19:21] made
[1:19:22] new yeah you're changed me you have a
[1:19:25] you're converted but watch how he says
[1:19:28] this here he says a redeem being
[1:19:31] redeemed is not a creation something new
[1:19:34] redeeming is to bring back which was
[1:19:38] already been so even the ones that
[1:19:41] you're offended with are in Christ
[1:19:45] they're not where you are and because
[1:19:47] they're not you're
[1:19:49] offended
[1:19:51] W man God hit me like that he was like
[1:19:53] dumping a dump truck on
[1:19:57] me he said it's not cre created
[1:20:01] something new he said redeemed it's to
[1:20:02] bring back which has already been see so
[1:20:06] there you are you're scared about what
[1:20:10] are you scared about you're
[1:20:13] god you're an amateur God he said you're
[1:20:16] scared about about what see all of it's
[1:20:20] in his hands and the clock is ticking
[1:20:24] perfect perfectly
[1:20:27] right but we don't like how it
[1:20:29] takes we're
[1:20:32] offended you know brother bam said this
[1:20:34] he said you know many times multiple
[1:20:35] times he said and it's it's on my thing
[1:20:38] here I'm just trying to he said if you
[1:20:39] wanted to do something nice to me he
[1:20:42] said do it to my
[1:20:43] children and he said that's how God
[1:20:49] feels ouch I I I put multiple of those
[1:20:52] that
[1:20:55] oh bless God you know I think they're
[1:20:57] off the I I
[1:21:00] think offended when you say that you're
[1:21:04] offended because it's different than
[1:21:06] your and I'm not talking about breaking
[1:21:08] the word I'm saying when when we're in a
[1:21:11] family see remember God was the
[1:21:13] self-existent one but when he spoke us
[1:21:16] he wasn't self-existent anymore it the
[1:21:19] the Bible the word and we maybe I pass
[1:21:21] it or will come to it he says that he
[1:21:23] dwelt with his family family and for you
[1:21:26] to attack his family is to attack God
[1:21:29] himself and his family's not perfect CU
[1:21:32] I'm a part of it and I'm
[1:21:38] imperfect
[1:21:41] wow he said why are family members
[1:21:45] embarrassed with their family members
[1:21:48] why are we embarrassed why are we you
[1:21:50] know when my mom and dad get old we'
[1:21:51] take them to every place they would go
[1:21:53] with us I didn't care what they did
[1:21:54] wrong at that restaurant that's my mom
[1:21:57] and dad they could knock the table over
[1:21:59] they could knock the place over that was
[1:22:01] my mom and
[1:22:02] dad before my dad died I showered my dad
[1:22:07] I took my dad to the bathroom and
[1:22:09] cleaned
[1:22:10] them I B my oldest brother said I
[1:22:13] couldn't do that I said that's my
[1:22:16] dad I never even I it wasn't even a it
[1:22:20] wasn't even a thought wasn't even cons
[1:22:24] and that's exactly what God feels like
[1:22:26] with the young babies and the Adolescent
[1:22:28] and the imperfections and the stupid fat
[1:22:31] Dale when he opens his mouth and says
[1:22:34] that's my boy regardless of what he
[1:22:39] does I'm not condoning
[1:22:41] sin but remember I hope I haven't passed
[1:22:44] it and if I come back I'll come back to
[1:22:46] it brother Brown said God chose it that
[1:22:52] way he chose CH it that I would make
[1:22:56] mistakes he chose it that you would make
[1:22:58] mistakes or he couldn't even portray all
[1:23:01] the things that he was and it never
[1:23:04] changed one Speck of the blood
[1:23:08] line now you may not condone we're not
[1:23:10] condoning sin and if you and your family
[1:23:12] if your kids are in the world condone
[1:23:14] but it don't change one spec they're
[1:23:16] your
[1:23:17] kids they're your a
[1:23:20] Heritage if you have the prophet said
[1:23:22] this he said if you have enough Holy
[1:23:24] Ghost to believe you're going to be in
[1:23:26] the bride your kids will be with
[1:23:28] you amen or you better get to the Altar
[1:23:32] and confirm your own Holy Ghost because
[1:23:35] it's a token they're your
[1:23:37] Heretics god brother Dale didn't raise
[1:23:39] no Devils it don't make no difference
[1:23:42] how they're living I didn't raise no
[1:23:45] Devils there
[1:23:47] devils have predestinated seed in
[1:23:50] them if you don't think so think of
[1:23:52] Rahab the woman at the well and need I
[1:23:54] go on Paul and David and uh-huh we think
[1:23:59] that was just all in the Bible no that's
[1:24:01] right here in a thing and we're offended
[1:24:03] we would be offended by David and what
[1:24:05] he did we would be offended by Paul and
[1:24:07] how he butchered the Christians we would
[1:24:09] be offended by the woman at the wall
[1:24:10] that had six hus five husbands or six
[1:24:13] husbands we would be offended if she
[1:24:14] came to this church bless God we're
[1:24:16] clean we're pure Hallelujah we don't
[1:24:19] have that spirit in this church well
[1:24:20] praise God I wish we had some of those
[1:24:22] Spirits in our church and the Holy Ghost
[1:24:24] could take care of those Devils amen we
[1:24:27] don't have no wom's at the wall woman in
[1:24:29] the wall like Rahab but maybe we need
[1:24:31] some of
[1:24:32] them because she married the chief of
[1:24:35] the Army and the lineage of Christ came
[1:24:38] through that family
[1:24:39] bloodline now that's
[1:24:44] crazy but we would be offended you don't
[1:24:47] know what you're doing
[1:24:49] God that's oh they will never get it
[1:24:55] see it's our our our this Spirit of of
[1:24:59] the age in Hollywood has raised it
[1:25:01] that's why you know men get five women
[1:25:03] and they married their their fifth or
[1:25:05] sixth woman is younger than their
[1:25:07] daughters and that cuz we just throw
[1:25:09] everybody in the garbage we're a
[1:25:10] throwaway Society you know we had a we
[1:25:14] have a TV there in the the hall you know
[1:25:16] for singing and the one blew up and I
[1:25:18] went back to you know where we got it
[1:25:20] and I'm thinking oh my goodness than
[1:25:22] aive this thing's only like
[1:25:25] I I thought I'd probably just got it
[1:25:27] paid for but I think it maybe was two
[1:25:29] years old and he said oh praise God he
[1:25:32] didn't say praise God he said you did
[1:25:33] really good it lasted two
[1:25:36] years and I'm thinking you're filling
[1:25:38] ships with this kind of
[1:25:40] garbage let's stop polluting the
[1:25:45] ocean you know the smart screens are a
[1:25:48] piece of garbage if they last for over a
[1:25:51] year you ain't got no warranty on
[1:25:53] nothing just throw out and buy another
[1:25:55] one just throw her out and so when we
[1:25:57] get offended with each other we just
[1:25:58] throw them out throw them out throw them
[1:26:01] out of the church throw them out of
[1:26:03] office you know when the the woman was
[1:26:07] had had an affair and her husband had
[1:26:08] had an affair and she came to the
[1:26:09] prophet and I don't have this in my
[1:26:11] notes and and she was going to be healed
[1:26:13] and God couldn't heal her because she
[1:26:15] had hidden sin and the prophet revealed
[1:26:17] it she screamed and she said nobody
[1:26:19] knows that you'll destroy my life and my
[1:26:20] family and my husband will leave and he
[1:26:22] said well it help you if I tell you what
[1:26:23] your husband did and he had done the
[1:26:25] same act and they came together and he
[1:26:27] was a deacon and she was a Sunday school
[1:26:29] teacher and when they confessed her sins
[1:26:31] to one another they came to the prophet
[1:26:33] and they said well I guess we'll step
[1:26:38] down how would you like it if brother
[1:26:40] Dale nominated a Sunday school teacher
[1:26:42] was a prostitute and a deacon that had
[1:26:44] messed around bunch of women you want to
[1:26:48] know what your Prophet said said why
[1:26:50] would you do that he said it's all under
[1:26:52] the blood now
[1:26:54] I wouldn't sit under that Deacon bless
[1:26:56] God I'd be looking for a new
[1:26:59] church you'd have to look for a new
[1:27:01] prophet and then you'd have to look for
[1:27:03] a new
[1:27:04] God because God needed prostitutes to
[1:27:08] save
[1:27:12] amen watch this he said you know the
[1:27:14] devil he don't attack you or your family
[1:27:18] and the devil don't attack the family of
[1:27:20] God so hard for no reason at all
[1:27:25] he don't attack your family he don't
[1:27:27] attack the less you know the Bible says
[1:27:30] that the most uncomely
[1:27:33] Parts get special
[1:27:40] honor that's the ones that we're
[1:27:42] offended with you know I went to the
[1:27:44] doctor I had a problem with my body and
[1:27:46] I went to the doctor I couldn't imagine
[1:27:48] any doctor want to do that job and you
[1:27:51] know when I got done I told the doctor I
[1:27:52] said no matter what you made it was
[1:27:54] wasn't enough it wouldn't have mattered
[1:27:55] to me if it was $1 million that would
[1:27:57] have been a steal I would have given him
[1:28:00] double
[1:28:01] that and I said if you were here and I
[1:28:04] wasn't talk to you on the phone I'd give
[1:28:05] you a
[1:28:06] hug because he fixed an uncomely part of
[1:28:09] me that was want me to jump out of
[1:28:12] buildings stand in front of
[1:28:14] trains because I was in
[1:28:17] torture I was in torture
[1:28:24] but with those parts we're offended and
[1:28:28] so we throw them out but with those
[1:28:31] parts God gifts our same God that we say
[1:28:34] we are he gives special
[1:28:40] honor special honor so that's the people
[1:28:43] that don't know Church order and
[1:28:44] Doctrine God gives special honor because
[1:28:46] they're coming into
[1:28:48] it that's the the people that make
[1:28:51] mistakes say the wrong now now now we're
[1:28:53] not con in it we need to we need to
[1:28:56] see you know you know he would say this
[1:28:59] like even for communion he says you know
[1:29:01] there's no Angels Among Us because you
[1:29:03] would already be gone the Rapture but if
[1:29:05] you take communion you know you have to
[1:29:07] make your heart right but is your desire
[1:29:09] to be
[1:29:11] right you know Peter made some really
[1:29:14] stupid
[1:29:16] mistakes but God give him the keys to
[1:29:18] the kingdom and I would have cut his
[1:29:20] head off
[1:29:25] you would have too you would have too
[1:29:27] don't look at me like that Holy
[1:29:28] religious thing I would have just
[1:29:30] chopped his I said buddy there is no
[1:29:32] hope for you
[1:29:34] holy offended I would have been past
[1:29:36] offended I would have been
[1:29:40] murder but you know what God
[1:29:42] said he said he's
[1:29:46] mine even though the crewed three
[1:29:48] times and even though he denied and even
[1:29:50] though he cares and even though and even
[1:29:53] though and even know he today my there's
[1:29:55] my boy you know we've had some people do
[1:29:58] that you know the story brother Brown
[1:29:59] told of the young girl that came back

[1:30:11] how we are in the
[1:30:14] church amen I'll say amen for you that's
[1:30:18] why we rate ministers on how long they
[1:30:20] Minister and their quality and their
[1:30:22] delivery and their Dynamics and we amen
[1:30:25] well we're never going to have brother
[1:30:26] Carson preach at the camp meeting
[1:30:27] because you know he's not
[1:30:30] certified we never have brother Dale cuz
[1:30:33] he don't know
[1:30:37] English and God says that's my
[1:30:41] mama and the guy come up told that girl

[1:31:21] norrod preached this here the greatest
[1:31:23] thing God did do you know God's Own law
[1:31:25] wasn't that he could save us cuz he was
[1:31:27] God and we were
[1:31:29] humans wasn't possible and God's Own law
[1:31:33] was it that was a kinsman
[1:31:35] redeemer Ruth God had to become fat and
[1:31:39] ugly like brother
[1:31:41] Dale to redeem brother Dale he had to be
[1:31:45] one of us you see what you you you know
[1:31:48] where I'm
[1:31:49] going and what did the world say exactly
[1:31:52] what the message people say today there
[1:31:54] was nothing I would desire of that

[1:35:31] could have a nice old your wave arrows
[1:35:33] could be right full with lots of kids
[1:35:36] and it could be really running smooth

[1:36:10] offended and almost every family on
[1:36:13] Earth and you know I'm right and if you
[1:36:14] got gray hair you'll know this for sure
[1:36:16] is ripped
[1:36:19] apart with the marriage of the
[1:36:22] kids because they are different coming
[1:36:26] into the family and they're not
[1:36:29] accepted as
[1:36:34] family
[1:36:36] uhhuh back to the year the devil's not
[1:36:38] attacking us so hard he said he would
[1:36:41] never come against the bride of Christ
[1:36:43] unless he seen something
[1:36:45] valuable in the family I want to just
[1:36:49] tell you something Church thieves don't
[1:36:52] break into empty
[1:36:54] houses thieves don't break into places
[1:36:57] where there's nobody that lives there
[1:37:00] thieves don't break into where there's
[1:37:02] value and character and discipline and a
[1:37:05] and a longing and a connection
[1:37:10] regardless of the uncomely
[1:37:14] parts
[1:37:16] regardless that's not to condone sin but
[1:37:18] in a family see there's immaturity
[1:37:25] immaturity in in a predestination
[1:37:28] there's people that haven't even been
[1:37:31] sign the Son of God on it yet so that
[1:37:34] seed just hasn't even germinated
[1:37:37] yet but it has just as much life in it
[1:37:40] as you did you know our Prophet said
[1:37:42] that in in a you know an apple seed
[1:37:45] there's all the apples that are in that
[1:37:47] whole tree is in that
[1:37:50] seed and that coconut that great baked
[1:37:54] monstrous oak tree like Jehovah God is
[1:37:58] all packed up in a seed that is uncomely
[1:38:01] and immature and maybe even in come to
[1:38:03] the light
[1:38:09] yet and so we can't let our light shine
[1:38:13] we can't be salty we can't witness we
[1:38:15] can't invite people because everybody's
[1:38:18] offended with
[1:38:20] everything just pick your thing
[1:38:24] and here's God in heaven the father of
[1:38:26] us
[1:38:28] all trying to hold her
[1:38:35] together blessed is
[1:38:37] he who ain't offended in my
[1:38:43] family you know me and Lan had a
[1:38:46] scenario if we were young and and kids I
[1:38:50] understand there might be some
[1:38:51] exceptions to the rule but we were kind
[1:38:52] of thickheaded
[1:38:54] and maybe even immature and maybe
[1:38:56] even a few other
[1:39:00] things but we had six kids under nine
[1:39:04] and if we were't invited to something
[1:39:05] that our kids weren't invited it was
[1:39:07] just automatically that we weren't
[1:39:08] invited CU they were just as much a part
[1:39:10] of me as as the blood in my
[1:39:14] veins and if if that you were afraid of
[1:39:17] my kids messing up your life well then I
[1:39:19] was going to mess up your life because
[1:39:20] it was a package ordeal
[1:39:25] and that's exactly what God's looking at
[1:39:27] and that's why he hasn't been able to
[1:39:28] take us home yet because we couldn't get
[1:39:30] along when we get up
[1:39:32] there well we can't get along down here
[1:39:35] so how are we going to get along up
[1:39:36] there cuz we're in tighter
[1:39:38] quarters and you know that's the
[1:39:41] truth you know that's the truth if you
[1:39:43] don't think that's the truth you just go
[1:39:44] anywhere and you'll know that's the
[1:39:48] truth you know we went to Ottawa last
[1:39:51] yesterday there's like multiple like six
[1:39:53] seven different churches represented

[1:46:24] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:46:26] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right
[1:46:30] now according that he has chosen us
[1:46:34] before the foundation of the world that
[1:46:35] we should be
[1:46:38] holy Hallelujah and Without Blame before
[1:46:41] him in love but you know what you
[1:46:44] actually have to be
[1:46:46] alive you have to be alive now let's
[1:46:49] just go down and is it okay if I read a
[1:46:51] few things brother Brandon and I I'm
[1:46:54] sorry you're going to have to forgive me
[1:46:57] for uh oh my here here he said God when
[1:47:02] God chose
[1:47:04] us God chose you that you got the Holy
[1:47:07] Ghost and when he when he did choose you
[1:47:09] before the foundation of the world was
[1:47:10] for knowledge and he seen you and he
[1:47:12] loved you in your state before there
[1:47:15] was uh and He sent Jesus that he might
[1:47:18] be pay for our sins and reconcile him
[1:47:22] back to himself in
[1:47:24] love God would have never done it if we
[1:47:27] had the thinking of God because we would
[1:47:29] have been offended and let me therefore
[1:47:31] go uh any farther he said let me before
[1:47:34] we go any farther go to Genesis 1:26 and
[1:47:38] I'll I'll pick this up Wednesday and and
[1:47:40] it was Elohim and I mentioned this it
[1:47:43] was Elohim the word means in the Hebrew
[1:47:45] self-existence and there was nothing
[1:47:47] existed besides God and he was a
[1:47:49] self-existent one there he was all by
[1:47:51] himself and Elohim means uh all
[1:47:54] sufficient all powerful allmighty all
[1:47:56] self everything but in Genesis 2 he made
[1:47:59] men and he said I am Yahweh Jehovah and
[1:48:03] he said what's that mean he said I am
[1:48:04] all existence but I am one who created
[1:48:07] something off
[1:48:12] myself so if you're offended with any
[1:48:15] single person in here that's immature
[1:48:17] you're offended with God because God was
[1:48:20] immature off myself to be a son of mine
[1:48:25] it's impossible for God this is this
[1:48:27] this is an adoption in
[1:48:29] 60 or a temporary or an amateur one of
[1:48:33] the little ones a little one of mine
[1:48:36] Glory why he gave man god Jehovah means
[1:48:40] that he gave men to be an amateure God
[1:48:42] because the father he was a father God
[1:48:45] and He Man men amature gods and so he
[1:48:48] isn't self-existent anymore he exists
[1:48:52] with his f family and so if you're
[1:48:54] offended with the family even the
[1:48:57] immature and the uncomely and the babies
[1:49:01] and the old people when they get make
[1:49:03] mistakes and
[1:49:08] and then you're offended with
[1:49:11] God and now he's Jehovah and meaning one
[1:49:14] whom exists with his family and now God
[1:49:18] made
[1:49:19] men to be have dominion over all the
[1:49:22] Earth and he had dominion and the Earth
[1:49:25] is a man's domain is that scripture and
[1:49:27] he said now if it's his domain now watch
[1:49:30] this I said this before I know you
[1:49:31] questioned me I can feel it come back
[1:49:33] sometimes he said and now the Earth was
[1:49:37] his domain that's scripture and if it
[1:49:38] was his domain he was he was that means
[1:49:42] you he brother B is talking about God's
[1:49:45] creation that came off a god th you're
[1:49:50] God over the Earth
[1:49:53] that's an adoption
[1:49:55] paragraph 15 of 60515
[1:49:59] e he said the Earth is uh he said he's
[1:50:03] God over the Earth and he could speak
[1:50:06] and it would be be so and he could speak
[1:50:09] this and it would be so and oh there he
[1:50:12] is god Jehovah and he's he's once was
[1:50:15] self-existence but
[1:50:18] now it's his family and it's his now I'm
[1:50:22] still reading
[1:50:23] and it's his little ones with
[1:50:31] him that we think are making
[1:50:34] mistakes and God made them exactly that
[1:50:38] way that's an adoption that's in that
[1:50:42] that last paragraph is 16 and 605 15
[1:50:47] e blessed are those who don't shout at
[1:50:51] God blessed are those who talk behind
[1:50:56] God back blessed are those who point out
[1:51:00] God's failures blessed are those who are
[1:51:04] not
[1:51:06] offended in
[1:51:08] God because he chose it that he would
[1:51:12] make it you would be you would be free
[1:51:15] moral agent and you would come into
[1:51:17] Perfection but you weren't born in
[1:51:20] Perfection and there ain't none of us
[1:51:22] here this Perfection yet or we would
[1:51:23] have went on cuz when God's finished
[1:51:26] with us and we've came to the perfect
[1:51:28] like the prophet he would have just sent
[1:51:30] down a Char of fire took us
[1:51:32] home amen God help us it was God's
[1:51:37] purpose to be Supreme his his family his
[1:51:40] Earthly family watch this I I I I'm I
[1:51:43] just I'm just I hope you'll forgive me
[1:51:46] but it was God's purpose it was his
[1:51:48] purpose the father Supreme it was his
[1:51:50] family his Earthly family Adam and Eve
[1:51:52] and they were the ones that could be his
[1:51:54] family or with God because God's nature
[1:51:56] was with them and I said this before see
[1:51:59] the greatest thing God did even before
[1:52:01] he could go to Calvary was he had to be
[1:52:04] us he had to be flesh he had to become
[1:52:09] us to pay the price for us he had to be
[1:52:12] my brother that I was offended with cuz
[1:52:14] all the religious people were offended
[1:52:16] in that day all the religious it was
[1:52:18] them that crucified him and that
[1:52:20] spirit's still alive
[1:52:24] amen that's why we have different
[1:52:25] camps brother Braham and the King's been
[1:52:27] Redeemer he said you know he said Jesus
[1:52:30] died uh manifested In the Flesh God
[1:52:32] became man it was a law of redemption

[1:52:38] before he could redeem is lost Israel
[1:52:40] back he had to be a kinsman redeemer he
[1:52:43] said that's all in Ruth so now when

[1:52:47] sisters even ones you're not

[1:53:54] we're working for God we're working
[1:53:56] against God and God God's
[1:54:01] struggling you know you know when Paul
[1:54:03] was murdering the Christians he believed
[1:54:05] with his whole entire heart he was doing
[1:54:08] God's
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:16] Will and so if brother
[1:54:19] did so if something happens and oh
[1:54:24] oh
[1:54:26] wow no wonder we don't have to pray
[1:54:28] anymore because we just gossiped each
[1:54:29] other that's where we get our
[1:54:31] comfort but if we could take these all
[1:54:34] to God then God would deal with it and
[1:54:37] we wouldn't be the and we think because
[1:54:39] we're gossiping we're we're warning
[1:54:41] people of other people's mistakes and
[1:54:42] all that and we're actually murdering
[1:54:44] them by their
[1:54:48] [Music]

[1:55:12] having a message God sure give me one my
[1:55:15] goodness and now when we're in

[1:55:22] he wanted to have fellowship with you
[1:55:23] and he came down and he made flesh so he
[1:55:26] could perfectly fellowship with you see
[1:55:30] the perfect
[1:55:32] Fellowship oh my what th this is the
[1:55:35] power of being transfered this is right
[1:55:37] before the prophet died it's paragraph
[1:55:39] 235 and this is worth repeating now then
[1:55:42] now now we can fellowship with him and
[1:55:44] you can't back thereare because you were
[1:55:46] just a word in him a seed but now he's
[1:55:50] manifested you and now he wants to
[1:55:51] Fellowship with him and when he came
[1:55:54] down he made flesh so he could perfectly
[1:55:57] fellowship with you each other see
[1:56:01] that's perfect
[1:56:03] Fellowship he said oh my them are
[1:56:08] deep
[1:56:10] Mysteries oh you wanted me to preach on
[1:56:12] the seals or
[1:56:14] something he said those are deep M
[1:56:16] mysteries of God how wonderful see God
[1:56:19] could Fellowship in the spirit so God
[1:56:22] God could not Fellowship in the spirit
[1:56:24] with men so God became a
[1:56:29] man wow I'm going to close and I'm just
[1:56:32] going to give you three examples and
[1:56:33] we're not we're it's 1:00 and my
[1:56:35] goodness we're going forever um job was
[1:56:37] one you know job had three
[1:56:40] friends and uh that came and and uh were
[1:56:43] offended with job now I I want to just
[1:56:46] show you fast really fast in the
[1:56:48] scripture Job 1 16 to8 we're not going
[1:56:50] to read it but you know God chose job he
[1:56:53] said you considered my servant job
[1:56:55] that's Job 1 168 now if you go to job
[1:56:59] 2 now God had allowed Satan to attack
[1:57:02] job and so now they were disorderly in
[1:57:05] around the message or whatever the bride
[1:57:08] I mean job had problems right we all
[1:57:10] agree he had problems big problems and
[1:57:12] he had three message deacons come
[1:57:15] by and they were really straightening
[1:57:17] him out it gives their names but I can't
[1:57:19] even repeat them now I have them right
[1:57:21] here in front of me that's in job 2 11
[1:57:23] and 12 the two deacons come by and
[1:57:25] straighten them out and job answered
[1:57:28] them and he
[1:57:29] said he said I've heard much many of
[1:57:33] such things are are miserable from you
[1:57:36] and then if we go to job
[1:57:38] 42 and God went to job's three
[1:57:43] friends and would you like to know what
[1:57:45] God told him would you like me to read
[1:57:47] that that's job 42:7 to10 and I'll just
[1:57:50] paraphrase it because we're running
[1:57:51] overtime
[1:57:53] God told them he said if you don't go to
[1:57:56] job and
[1:57:58] repent and get job to pray for you
[1:58:01] you're a dead
[1:58:05] man
[1:58:07] offended they were
[1:58:10] offended they said everything you could
[1:58:12] think of about
[1:58:14] job job 42:7 to10 said if you don't go
[1:58:18] to job and you don't get him to pray for
[1:58:20] you and repent
[1:58:23] you're a dead
[1:58:29] B another example in the Bible is Joseph
[1:58:33] Joseph was chosen of God Amen this
[1:58:36] beloved of his well chosen loved of his
[1:58:39] father his brothers hated him because
[1:58:41] the spirit of God was on him because he
[1:58:43] was a dreamer sold into slavering Joseph
[1:58:46] is a perfect type of of of Christ and
[1:58:49] all these things that
[1:58:50] happen huh
[1:58:53] huh you know the end of that
[1:58:55] story another one was Abraham when God
[1:58:59] chose him said go to a land where I'll
[1:59:01] show you and the mistake Abraham made
[1:59:04] was he brought people that God never
[1:59:05] included in the
[1:59:07] promise and you know they were offended
[1:59:09] with each other because they quarreled
[1:59:12] their servants and he said we don't need
[1:59:14] to quarrel so you can build another
[1:59:15] church wherever you want and I'll go to
[1:59:17] another
[1:59:18] town and you know when lot got in
[1:59:21] trouble
[1:59:22] and the kings came and taken
[1:59:30] him Abraham because he had the spirit of
[1:59:34] Christ went and rescued
[1:59:36] him I want to close with this scripture
[1:59:39] Ephesians
[1:59:40] 5:17 and Junior you give this to me I
[1:59:43] seen it on your post today and it was
[1:59:45] beautiful I put it on after I came to
[1:59:47] church Ephesians 5:17
[1:59:50] wherefore be ye not
[1:59:53] unwise but understanding what is the
[1:59:58] will of the Lord
[2:00:02] is Let's Not Be
[2:00:04] unwise and let's have a little bit of
[2:00:09] understanding that the uncomely parts
[2:00:13] they came from God
[2:00:15] too and because they don't fit your
[2:00:19] program if you're offended
[2:00:25] Wow Let's
[2:00:48] stand that are not correct
[2:00:54] I'm not condoning being off the
[2:00:57] word I'm not condoning
[2:01:01] sin but it don't change
[2:01:04] predestination don't change the family
[2:01:07] part you got to let God be God let God
[2:01:10] Be The Savior and you just be the
[2:01:13] children because the prophet said this
[2:01:15] and I closing with this thought if if
[2:01:17] God will let me he said you know when
[2:01:20] somebody backslides
[2:01:23] they're not
[2:01:27] lost they're out of
[2:01:30] Fellowship so we can be offended with
[2:01:33] somebody's other fellowship and you
[2:01:34] won't have to worry they won't come back
[2:01:37] too
[2:01:43] quick and your Prophet said they're
[2:01:46] still
[2:01:48] converted they're still
[2:01:50] saved just out of
[2:01:53] Fellowship
[2:01:55] because that's sister Ruth like your
[2:01:57] brother
[2:01:58] Bill because he said when God seals the
[2:02:01] train car it's fit for the whole
[2:02:05] journey it's fit for the whole journey
[2:02:07] but the train car might go off the
[2:02:11] track not be in line with all the other
[2:02:13] train cars but it's still SE
[2:02:23] so be careful we don't get offended you
[2:02:25] know if somebody gets out of Fellowship
[2:02:27] they're going to do things that people
[2:02:29] do that are not in
[2:02:31] Fellowship that that even believer just
[2:02:35] hang
[2:02:36] on but they're not
[2:02:39] lost our Prophet said they could no more
[2:02:42] be lost than Christ could be
[2:02:45] lost because he said God don't do
[2:02:47] business like that he's a good
[2:02:48] businessman he don't start a he don't
[2:02:50] start building a shed of he knows he's
[2:02:52] got the money to finish his shed you
[2:02:53] know I was trying to teach the Africans
[2:02:55] that you know he said you don't build a
[2:02:56] tower you don't go to war until you
[2:02:59] investigate whether you got enough to
[2:03:00] win the war or finish the
[2:03:05] tower wow God help us to not be offended
[2:03:10] we think we're offended with flesh and
[2:03:13] blood but we wrestle
[2:03:17] not oh ain't the Bible good but against
[2:03:21] principal I ities and the Devil comes
[2:03:24] into houses that are full of gold
[2:03:26] predestinated seed tried in the fire of
[2:03:30] Jehovah and Satan's trying to get that
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:36] gold help us not to be offended but to
[2:03:39] be
[2:03:40] wise and
[2:03:43] understand and understand
[2:03:49] God I feel like I could preach for
[2:03:52] forever
