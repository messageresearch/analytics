========================================

that's that's the way God is always worked and and you know you know in the days of Moses one time they said to him when the time had come visit who made you a prince and a ruler of us well if you actually look Moses wasn't looking to be a prince and a ruler because he was already a prince and the ruler in Egypt you know but he was identifying himself with these suffering people so that it the Bible in the book of Acts as they thought they would understand that God will by his hand was about to do something well now I'm not a Moses or nothing like that but you see because of that attitude they end up spending more time in Egypt because then Moses was gone for 40 years you know so if we we always want to tweak our attitude so that we can pick we already made the sacrifice many things happening out there we are in the house of God so we pull what we need and the supernatural presence of God is here because God is omnipresent amen just um greetings from our little church you know the pastor made a point brother Nelson made a point he says greet the church for me once he done that now you know I'm like okay I got to do that but um he says greet them and uh and um that's um that's uh in Scarborough that's I think many of you know him he was away on a missionary in a trip I come back and just I think this would be his first Sunday in a few few weeks uh he has been away so just seeing everybody you know uh the Dale family God bless you and um but the map God bless you and your family brother Bernard sister Ruth and the the little ones is uh names I don't know God bless you you know we are just here just to have a good time in the presence of God appreciate my wife you know she just sang the Great emancipatora whenever I come here I'm reminded that uh it is uh by the Dell and I think brother John it was but but the Dell baptized her you know she came and she gave her life to the Lord and uh we were coming to meetings here when I was still by but they were still buying petroleum there and that's where she got baptized so I always see that God gave us some connection some special connection there amen you know I think that's why she can sing like that the great emancipator you know sometimes people get into where she came because uh she didn't know much about the message and all that but I remember when she came I simply said to her you know what because I became a Christian really when I came here to Canada and I said I I I go to church normally three times a week Sunday Wednesday and Fridays sometimes I said um if you want you can come with me if you want you can stay home I've never believed that matters of faith is a matters of force you know it's like when you take your fruit and you try to voice first ripen it it's still sour inside you know it got it got to go through the process on its own stay in the presence of the Sun and then it's transformed you know that's how I I I introduced she came because she wanted to she wanted to spend all in the process then the gospel took a hold you know um don't be hard up on people you know you can go through all the ceremonies and the rituals dress this way speak this way you know and sometimes people can start doing it but if it's not from the heart it's not it's not benefiting them it got to be a change from the heart now it's not that you are encouraging people to do evil no I mean if it becomes too too out of place and their kind of stuck naked in church wow obviously you got to kind of put an order out to that but a lot of times if you let the people that are supposed to deal with it the churches have pasta and in this case the pastor's wife as well normally they are positioned to deal with those things better you know sometimes I've we've heard stories away maybe people are new they are coming and someone who's a little bit trigger happy they just jump to the person and then they kind of throw them off you know years ago I remember I read that I'm just gonna talk uh and that's that's that's how it is notes but I I really don't care about that it's more a conversation with each other and with Fellowship that's just what it is uh there was a sister she she she had gone to to uh a place she she was kind of a box leading got to know about the message before she backslide but she came from kind of a very broken home you know the the father was abusive I think physically he used to be the mom or something like that and um she then the mom you know was uh she just I guess didn't know how to handle it and then in 10 she was rough with the children so that's the kind of home she grew up in and then uh even though they were kind of nominal Christians so she was a little bit negative about anything called Christianity he goes she's looking at how she's treated in the life she's living anyway then the message came along she found people with a bit different so she started going but then uh she she she threw the hustle and bustle of life she she she just end up sleeping so she wasn't going to church and then one time there was a funeral at the church I saw this uh this uh testimony a few years ago on the voice of God website so they they there was a funeral at the church and um then one of the sisters at the church told you to come to the funeral because I think it's somebody they knew both so she decided to go and when she decided to go she she thought okay fine I'm gonna dress up you know properly then she changed her mind she said you know if I do that that looks like um kind of hypocritical because this is not really how I'm living so then she she just put on her pants nothing too vulgar about pants not not decent she put on she put on your pants just dressed the way she was living she came so she was just expecting that hour you know people maybe she's looking at people somebody looking at me judging me and she's standing there and she said when she was kind of standing in the way he says this brother said to her in the most sweetest voice she ever heard in her life she says uh you know it's so simple it just shook me the way the Simplicity of how God works he says you know sister if if you don't mind just moving on the side because they're going to be moving with the vehicle and and you may be in the way so if you just don't mind he said the most politest the most sweetest voice and then she said wow you called me sister even though I'm dressed like this and that's what attending back to Christ that simple gesture you know sometimes we think that as people are back sleeping we got loved ones I think each one of us here can look maybe he's one loved ones uncles brothers sisters somebody whom we are trying to witness Christ too and uh then sometimes we start thinking wow you know if big Evangelistic service move all gods turn up your people you know we want a big kind of meetings and maybe we go back we see the meetings brother Branham used to have we think like men if it could just go like that maybe they'll attend back to Christ but a lot of times maybe we are looking at it wrong sometimes what God is looking for he just wants you to pick up the core and say man I just called to say hi how are you doing how are you doing that means sometimes a lot than all the sermons you can preach you know I don't know if anybody remembers the the testimony brother Branham gave I think it was old gab or something like that a man called old yab and it wasn't really good at shooting but he loved hunting and uh his wife was a Christian but he wasn't and uh he went hunting uh with the pastor for the while the the the wife's pastor and uh finally then that day is showed a lot of rabbits and it was really good and uh then he gave he says he says uh you know you know you know Pastor I decided to give my life to the Lord the pastor says what salmon did I preach that done that he says well you know they are good pastor you say mom they come from the good old book but but it's not wasn't your sermon what is it then Olga he says well you know I'm not a good shot and I showed all these rabbits I realized that if you would give me so much good game he must love me so much so you know it was in the past a sermon that changed him but the pastor's decision to take him hunting even though he might have been offensive in other ways and then God blessed that and use that so the pastor was used still but not in the manner that you would think Jesus Christ said I work my father worked Sita too and he that too I work some of Jesus greatest sermons was when he's in a little corner somewhere you see is that true you know the salmon we base a lot of our Christian teaching on John 3. it was prayed to a man who came by night it was impressed at a convention the man actually was kind of afraid kind of so that's why he came by night because you know they'd agree that whosoever identifies himself with Jesus is going to be kicked out of the church and this is one of them a Pharisee it wasn't even preached to what you call a regular message believe of that day it was preached if I received who came asking they say you must be born again these are some of Jesus greatest teachings and preachings one time one of the greatest sermons Jesus if a priest was in a tombstone and he said we must go over the other side where are we going we got out some preaching there well we didn't organize anything Pastor Jesus no there is where is the fellowship hall he's in the graveyard who's the audience it's one you mean 12 riches in there the Son of God for one person is a yes and when he went there after he finished with the legion Legion really wasn't his name is what the demon said when he's finished with that man nobody else wanted to hear him because they were upset that they lost their pigs and all that and they told him to leave right and the man said well I'm gonna follow you Jesus Jesus actually says no no no no no don't come to my church go and start your own go and testify what God has done right we've got to change the traditional you know I put it in quotes message way of thinking the message is Christ whatsoever Christ is the message is there sometimes the message is in the tombstones where these dead people sometimes the message is in a temple sometimes the message is on the streets there was even one time Jesus says when I'm preaching to this one I don't want preachers here I'm coming myself so he sent the preachers to buy bread the woman of Samaria he said all the preachers go and buy bread and then he come he start talking to the woman and the way he presented himself to the woman he actually presented himself like he's the one in need he says can I have some water so then they started the everyday thought you know we don't get along there's discrimination here we don't talk to you Jews you don't talk to us Americans why are you talking to me so they just start talking they talk of the day so Jesus starts saying something and the Bible says when the preachers came they wanted that he talked to a woman but they were afraid to ask him because he's Jesus right you see and then then then then he says I got rid of that you know nothing about you see anybody brought him food so he actually said I must pass a must you see so all these to tell you and say prepare yourself you know we are speaking to believer here a lot of us you know have been um saving the Lord for a while and when God brings us into the faith he brings us to use users but uh we have to prepare our mindset in such a way that he uses us we don't want to ever be in a situation where God is really pressing on to want to use us and we are missing it because our mindset is set a certain way God don't play the game of numbers at all actually I'll tell you for for myself when God begin to deal with me in terms of preaching I I'm not ashamed to say this that the deepest and most anointing preaching that I've ever preached in all the time God has had me to preach was when I was preaching to one person and that person was so zoned in he's like I'm speaking things the way I'm thinking like I never heard that and I know that Revelation is coming that's how much they were pulling and God started dealing with me it's not a game of numbers my father works in the two and did the two at work you know people when meetings and the conversions are dumb people work themselves into an atmosis so they feel something I'm not saying they are not feeling God they are because the reason they are feeling God is got nothing to do with numbers is because they've prepared their heart to pull from God that's why they would feel God that's why they say what a meaning we had you see but if anybody came under that expectation in the presence of Jesus it doesn't matter who's around they'll feel the same thing the most profound things Jesus is revealed to people sometimes is by themselves one time Jesus actually went to a place he hadn't gone to really preach he had gone there maybe just to Fellowship a little bit he said damn and uh and just like that you know I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes he sit down he's tired I guess he did a campaign and Martha is in the kitchen there she's doing what she's doing Mary said you know what Jesus is come here I'm pulling what I need she came she said at the feet of Jesus she began to hear things and it was such a tremendous thing and in the meantime Martha knows nothing about it she's busy in the kitchen no nothing wrong with that because people have to eat but you see what she ended up doing she went to Jesus she mastered don't you care my sister is not helping me you know how ridiculous that sounds she's telling the Creator that you don't know how to create to correct Mary so let me tell you so that you can correct her she does of course she's not thinking all that she's there thinking we need to save man we need to make people welcome Jesus was he knows all those you know Jesus is not about a big rebuke he come and says you are comfortable with too many things I say one thing is needful and Mary has chosen that so Mary had a Revival where nobody else knew about it it's just the way we look at it when we have that you see God just moving in a mind Mighty way away from the big action he moves there if he chooses to he's God he's sovereign but God is never a showman even if he moves among thousands he's not a Showman showman that's Hollywood stuff you know but God does something for a particular purpose and when we come under expectation we were received from God Hallelujah is the truth is the truth so we prepare our mind to be in that mindset then we can pull and then and then that's it 444 that wasn't premeditated that was just what came upon my heart to say you know so don't take offense if it may sound offensive no it's uh we we are we are brothers the Bible says this you say you say you have one master and that's Christ all you are brothers that's why to me there's no top 10 in the message it's in their head it doesn't work with God zero zilch do you know do you imagine the amount of effort it needed to deliver Legion with the Legion of demons how much prayer how much anointing is needed to deal with that so it's not a game of numbers sometimes one battle is more intense than 70 bottles depending on what you're dealing with instead of praying for loved ones that are addicted to drugs cocaine and heroin and the power of God you know that well there's no it's not about psychology because they know that I'm a mess I'm a mess I'm broken but they just can't help it and they try everything oh my goodness I remember about the dad who we dealt with this father he said he said I said Is it someone I don't know what else to do for sure and the Sun is made it's just such a mess and and and and he he desires to be free they just don't know how then you need a supernatural power of God to move you got them to know your God and I understand that this demon power you come face to face you think that battle is easy it's not a game of numbers the game of numbers is the game of man but the bottom one time I think he prayed was it for a blind person for our reaching out to God until finally the person breaks free you see we got to give that passion for Souls you know and then God will own us when we start bringing our loved ones when we start looking at things like that broken relationships broken fellowships broken people and stuff like that but the bottom says one of the sickest bodies that he's ever seen is the body of Christ you know we and we ought to be examples we ought to be the place where Sanctuary ought to be the place where people don't feel judged and look down upon but they know that when I come here I will find love I'll find Deliverance you know love heals you know says I'll rather have a church that is full of love than all the gifts that you can think of because Gibson callings are without repentance friends you don't have to repent for your gift to be expressed but you see when you love is something it does something to people it reaches people respond even dogs respond to love you know I tried it you know I went but yeah I see I see I see dogs and stuff like that I said let me extend my love to you let me see how it responds and all of a sudden I see it's jumping it's coming out after me I'm like wow yeah that's real that's real I'm a stranger you know I mean it's a nice dog I guess you know to start with but I'm a stranger and the other one the bigger one I looked at that I looked and said you say this is the the mother of them I'm like oh it has gone through life a lot and it took takes a little while to respond like it's studying me and say let me see what you're up to and then it's coming it's going I says Ah okay you see that's what happens with some of us we message Believers we've been for a while maybe then we start thinking too much right we just need to extend our love and then when we extend our love the rest God will take care of God is not out of methods to bless his people God is not out of ideas of how to free his people oh not at all to the contrary God is full of those ideas but brother Branham says God is uh waiting for that person that he can bless use remain humble that character that he can use that's where the challenge is do you recognize when John and James they pass through Samaria and these Samaritans they they didn't receive Jesus and you know what John and James is a master do you that we command Fire come down from heaven if they even quoted scriptures yes Elijah did you know even when you're in the wrong Spirit you always have a scripture to back yourself up but the only thing is that you are using it wrong oh yeah you know the prophecy you know if you don't like that Jezebel relax relax that's probably God's seed they are just not in their season yet if you just extend a little bit of love you will see all the makeup gone you'll see all the spaghetti tops gone you'll see all the nasty clothes gone and soon you just see a wonderful beautiful Christian friend that you never knew was there you see when my wife came I didn't even tell her I you know people take off your slacks she comes she wants to visit I'm visiting Christian friends well as long as it's not too tight and you know so so thing I'm like yeah okay fine because what am I doing sure no no oh it's God that changes people that's why she can then sing like that if it was me who told it to do that well it will still just be a show but when God has done it I don't have to say nothing you know that's how how is supposed to be and even the same thing with our children we teach them the right way and stuff like that well they come a point where they are older it's like well you have to make up your mind to serve the Lord because I'm your not your father but before God we are all children you know and you got to come to a point where you come face to face with your God you know it may be hard especially with children that grow up in Christian homes the father is a Christian the mother that's all they know so it looks like it's just regular it's normal they don't know the world out there they don't know how nasty how how messed up it is and stuff like that but the time comes when they of their own accord has to say well I need to surrender my own life to God but you can never do it by by compelling people by force but by reaching out praise God amen we're going to read scripture uh just so that um we tie everything to scripture that's what we always do because the words of men will fail but the written word of God will never fail so we always want to bring everything and Tide back to the scriptures and Jesus said here he was teaching them to pray because they'd asked the him and they said um he said Matthew 6 verse 9 to 10. you see the after this men are therefore pray ye Our Father we chat in heaven hallowed be thy name that means thy name is Holy thy kingdom come thus verse 10. thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven so we'll stop there we're gonna draw a text from that thy kingdom come thy kingdom come it's interesting that God would actually say that and then the question that comes is like well God is still a king what are we saying Jesus is telling us to pray to God and say let thy kingdom come when there's a coming there's a living of one place and they're going on to another place so where is it coming from and where is it going and that's the question that that that that that that needs an answer and um let's go I'm gonna lay a background here with uh what uh brother Branham said I got uh three quotations here I'll see which ones I'll read the first one in question and answers preached in 59 12 12 23 I'm just putting that so that if we ever want to go back and reference it's easy to search you know we live in an age way it has become so easy to search scriptures to set your thought and that's good because I had one one Minister that years ago when he was young certain preachers that they were just not good people they they would quote a scripture quotation there's a brother but I'm saying and it's a lie he never said that but because back then you had to have the book you know so they would throw those things and you have no way really of knowing you because because just because someone doesn't have it on them doesn't mean it's not true but they will be throwing on their ideas but we are now living in an age where instantly this this can be checked so make it always a habit the Bible say make your calling and the election sure and um the bereans always searched you look for these things especially if something sounds a little bit different to the way you might have known it or think about it you take it I always encourage somebody and say when that happens take it to God you can go to God and say I'm your daughter God I'm your son I don't want anyone to to deceive me I I want to I want you to help me I'm hearing different things I'm sure that you've been around enough message circles to hear this one through that thought this one through that thought some good some not so good and uh even though we know that but the Branham was a prophet but because there's all these different ideas sometimes it leaves people wondering okay so we do we actually stand what is really true to me I see when you're in that spot you know don't start going live right and Center pick up the phone and ask that one and ask on and even maybe add more to your confusion what you do is that you go to God and say God I'm your son speak to me show me what's true and God will because the Bible says he that comes to him he will in Noah is Cast Away she will that's his nature it's not his nature as a matter of fact I don't know why people resent that that God speak to people I've dealt with people it's almost there is they're resentful when you say God spoke to me even to Cain what's the problem how can he not speak to his own children if he's gonna speak to yourself and see it God even spoke with the devil when they were speaking about job so when you come to God God actually every day for how many years spoke with Judas Jesus was God in flesh we know that so it's not a big thing it's not the matter is not whether God speaks to people the matter is do we hear when he speaks because the Bible says he that is an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying to the church this is not physical hearing but let him understand that that's what we need so you can always go to God and verify these things for yourself Jesus said but the Barnum is uh is is is quoting he is a verily verily I say unto you in other words verily verily say amen amen absolutely absolutely truly truly I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now brother banam says this now you couldn't see the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit some standing here will not test of death till they see the kingdom coming in power he said the kingdom of God the Bible said is within you it is within you the Holy Spirit and you can't see that with your eyes see means to understand and Jesus comes around and teaches us and say when you pray now say thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth not on Earth in Earth in Earth your Earth as it is in heaven pray for this pray for the kingdom of God to be established inside of you in this question in these questions and answers brother tells you that is the holy spirit we can go back to the scriptures understand that when brother bana makes reference to things the reason we we we we caught him for me is simple a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word of God but whatsoever a prophet taught you can see it in the Bible if that Prophet is a prophet of God well if he's not that's a different story that's why sometimes that's why people go of tangents because they will go trying to quote brother Branham but they do it out of context because they can't lie in it with the scripture when you can't line it with the scripture well maybe you're understanding is off because a profit by definition is a Divine interpret of the word of God he's a word Prophet if he's not a word profit he can be a prophet the difference is that he's able not just to take the letter of the written bible but through the Holy Spirit calls the written bible to become a living article before people when the Bible says Jesus Christ Is A Healer a Vindicated prophet of God just doesn't tell you that Jesus Christ Is A Healer he actually demonstrates the healing power of God but that's just not for Prophets that's for all believers every believer because the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe it doesn't say shall follow prophets only in my name they shall cast out devils it doesn't even say men alone sisters has the power to do so as long as you're not doing it for the wrong reasons you better know what you're doing though because if you are dealing with demon power you want to know what you're doing because one time demons say Paul I know Jesus I know who are you so you better know who you are you better know where you are standing you see so God has given this power accessible to human beings I want you to hear something here in First Corinthians 4 20 I'm gonna line this up with something by the brand I'm saying so that you can understand that when he's making these Testaments where you get it from you know remember we are talking to young ones too so we may be going to things that everybody was older is familiar with but you know young ones are growing up and we got to teach them the ways of the Lord so so so don't let that out throw you off because we are speaking also to young ones right right it says for the kingdom of God is not in Word but in what power so the word of God the kingdom of God is not in Word this is where you get into another issue around the message because a lot of people preach word word word and that's true because the word is truth but if it's only word word with no power it's not the complete truth because the kingdom of God is not in word only it's in power trust me Satan don't care about you talking about the word actually he quoted it to Jesus you can talk all the word you want he can even correct you and say no no you quoted it wrong this is actually how it says it he came to Jesus he says oh throw yourself for it is written he shall give the Angels charge over thee and it was true Jesus never said you called they did wrong but Power that's what sit in Respect power you think I care for somebody who comes like you somebody comes and pretends and stand day or on the street and say hey stop stop I'm like who's that guy but if that person I see a police cruiser and they got their uniform and stuff like that I bet I respond now what am I looking at because I'm looking at the power of his position you know that could actually be a small framed young lady officer but by virtue of a position she got power wow she she has the power to raise her hand and stop me why she won't physically be able to stop the vehicle that I can knock it down but because I know that behind is the authority of the old PP or whosoever authority she's representing that's what people respect she so they Respect power that's behind so she's standing in authority and that Authority she knows that if something happens she has the power to Samoan people to stop you whether you like it or not so Satan Respect power that's why the gospel cannot be preached in word only the gospel is to be preaching power and in order to understand about this power well you got to know a powerful one and not only you know him he got to know you you know everybody knows here that our Trudeau is the prime minister of Canada he's a powerful man and uh in by virtue of his office this is not about whether you agree with his politics or not we are just talking about his office and stuff like that that office invests him with power to do things power to co-elections power to to print money and give it to people and all the different things that comes with that office and you find that in the message say we talk a lot about the election I was elected that was selected and we are going on about that predestinated and we are just going with the word the word the word the written word that is what I'm talking about but what I like about elections in the natural when elections have happened in the natural they put people in power if we are also elected and predestinated of God it must position Us in power and when we have power it means that your word is low this is what it means to govern that's why when they are giving a budget after they come to the power they call it the throne speech in other words we are speaking from a position of power power what we see here is become law our word has got the power to change things in this country that's what elections does I trust that I'm speaking to some elected people that have come to understand that thank you Jesus that our election hasn't helped us just to be elected people but it's put us in power I won't go too far with that but understand that true election puts in power and brother Barnum says in the Bible here says the kingdom of God is not in Word but in power to change things in the message of Oneness say listen closely now he's quoting it first Corinthians 4 20 says the kingdom of God is his word made Power the kingdom is in you and the when the word comes in there what does this word begin it turns itself into power making it just exactly what it said what is the kingdom of God we got to belong to the kingdom before we can ever be subject to the king well how do you get into the kingdom the kingdom of God is the word of God made back in power amen made Power taking away sins giving signs the Bible says you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you what was the Holy Ghost given for the banam went into that power speech power over sinful life power over all these different things the kind of gospel that brings people just to the written word the word the word written but never positions them in a power to see the signs of God to see their life turned to see all the things that are promised in the scripture that's not the gospel because the gospel is preached in power now we know it's more than that because we can have power for it to move mountains and we without charge it's it's coming up all the time it's coming up all the time what are we leading up to of course it's not to take your faith away from the written word if we do that then we are preaching false but we got to understand that we are walking steps towards God at every stage of our life the Natural Life comes forth in three stages As We Know water blood and life and over and over nature all things speaks of these threefold purpose of God to Usher you into life in the days of the Exodus in the book of Exodus the time of Moses we see God leading people out of Egypt leading people second through the Wilderness and then getting them into the promised land well it sounds easy to say but you know that that statement I said alone took them 40 years it's easy to say but it's a real battle so you find that many people come to realize yeah the word is truth there's a promise and exodus Prophet also came in our day you see come out from among them my people we came out whether it's the world whether it's denomination well we were Justified before God we heard the word of God we recognized we rejoiced over that but God requires more you know it's like badam give the illustration of picking you know a glass wherever it is whether it's in a barnyard and that vessel is thrown out there you don't pick it up and immediately put it on your table and start using it no you don't do that it goes through a process so there's nothing wrong God by his word he called us he says I love you we heard that howsoever that message came to us God picks us up from the ground we were dirty but Daddy picked her up we recognize that God loves me because I'm dirty he actually extends his Clean Hands to pick up something dirty and we felt that goodness as he lifted us up from whatever condition we were in and he says I'm calling you to the life I'm calling you to have a place at the table but a lot of times people stop there that's why sometimes people come and rejoice and come to the altar howsever they do Lord forgive me they actually feel the burden of sin lifted from them but you see if the gospel ends there by and by they tend back into the world again now don't discount them don't say it wasn't real that can even happen if they are in a denomination because we see denominational names Jesus see the heart so it doesn't matter where the person is as long as they come to Jesus and say forgive me he forgives them if they mean it but soon you realize that our problem is deeper than just our sins being forgiven our problem is our own very nature that's why David after doing so many exploits for God David killed the lie and David killed a bear David killed Goliath David slaughtered Philistines all these were Supernatural acts the power of God come down and anoint him and he inspired generations to fight and actually Israel never hit a king like David everyone was compared to David and yet the battle that overcame him but Matt was in the Battle of Goliath standing and boasting it wasn't the Goliath of a lion or a the giant of a lion coming forth and roaring after him it wasn't the grizzly bear whatever it was coming after him it wasn't that the many Philistines who were strong and were warriors for Generations gone those he defeated by trusting in his God his greatest battle was when he was by himself and he stood by the top of his house and he sees a woman friends don't say he didn't have the word he had David said Thy word if I eat my heart that I may not sin but you see that's when he wrote he says I was born in sin in iniquity did my mother conceive me well what was he talking about does it mean that his parents were not we were living out of wedlock that's not what it means he's saying I got this sin nature on me I need to be changed although I can Slaughter golap although I can I can conquer different things him before a naked body of a woman that was in a certain place I fell hard he feels so hard not only did he commit adultery he killed the man he shows you the need of another work of Grace cleansing you know that could never be fully accomplished in the way he wanted in the days of David because the sacrifice was not given Jesus Christ died on the cross to take away children the desire for sin no matter how your children are born with parents in the message the nature of sin is inside of you we teach you to do the right thing but that doesn't take away the nature of sin the nature of sin is the one that will make you calls you no matter how much you teach I never seen any right sensible even sin appearance who tell their children yeah go and do these wrong things this is how you do wrong things you don't have to teach them to life they start lying you don't have to teach them to deny things they've done they just start doing it on their own why because the nature of sin is inside of you so whether your parents are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost the nature of sin is still inside of you the natural birth could not impart to you the nature of life so when God picks you up the reason why people struggle it's not that they didn't give their heart to the sometimes sometimes it is but it's because they fail to recognize that after I give my heart to the Lord I got issues that needs to be uprooted from within me I got deep seated desires some of these desires it's not even anything you've done is passed on from generations to generation you see we're getting that from just look at the history of the line line of Judah David was in the line of Judah look what Judah these four parents did you they went and slept with Tamar thinking it's a hallowed so Judah was busy chasing a lot this is the spirit that was on his line and when he came face to face with it it's a company Moses look at you yeah everybody knows Moses would get upset quickly you know what that rock right and Beat It When God says speak to him say man oh good he was upset but just look at this line look at Levi Levi and the semen killed the whole city because they were upset with the people so these things are deep rooted sometimes it needs the blood of Jesus to break it I'm so surprised sometimes the people in the message they say we got the fullness of the word and they haven't even conquered themselves they have it here but it's not set in here because the word sanctifies you the word cleanses you you don't pick up that glass and start using it and start drinking God is not gonna do that you got to cleanse you well in the Old Testament there's an excuse so to speak because the fullness of time wasn't there even David Begins the one thing if I desired that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever because for all his mighty battles after he has slaughtered all the Philistines he Comfort when he's on the top of the his houses he falls at the feet of a woman now he had the history to look to because it is time Samson had come and gone and Samson fell with the same thing no matter how strong he was God then needs a work of Grace to change us to sanctify us let us not be like the typical message people that don't want to hear Holiness message they think that if you jump justification if you jump sanctification if you jump the restoration of the gifts if you jump the baptism of the Holy Ghost and forget and ignore them all of a sudden you're in adoption so it's almost you know it reminds me you know what one brother used to say when I was young I used to think that you know he was a little boy then he said I used to think that if I close my eyes no one is seeing me you know if you close your eyes to something because you are seeing nobody all of a sudden around you all of a sudden oh nobody's seeing me yeah because I close my eyes so nobody sing so people think that if they close their eyes to justification no no that's shallow the sanctification that's shallow then God is not seeing them but my life the best interpretation of what I believe is not what I say it's what I live no matter all I may confess it with my mouth no matter how might say brother Branham was a prophet of God and it's true actually Jesus I mean the devil does better the Bible says he believed that Jesus is the son of God and he tramples he does better than a lot of us We believe We Don't tremble right so sanctification is the second work of Grace and don't look down upon it because it's a work of Grace Grace means and merited favor Jesus Christ died on the cross so that he can bring sanctification to the hearts of people cleansing take away lying take away cheating take away fornication take away perversion take away foolishness this is what sanctification does if we are still caught up with those Spirits pornography and so on we are not Sanctified we need to come to Jesus and say Lord cleanse me from unrighteousness even as men in relation time I'm a married man God is a certain way he wants it to enjoy family relation don't be influenced by by Hollywood and come up with this perverted you know ways to come together that's dirty God hates it God wants us to be clean Hallelujah because he says I am Holy the word Sanctified means set aside cleanse and set aside for service you're not demanding Services you are just cleaned and set aside the word church means the Sanctified ones the separated ones so the church is a place of cleaning it's like a big laundry place if we don't hear the gospel of our cleansing what's the problem and you know when the Holy Ghost is coming to your life he continues the work of sanctification inside of you he keeps you separated be holy for I am Holy and under the preaching of the Methodist says you know they had to douse them with with with water this is this is John Wesley they call them men of fire and that was sanctification that was the restoration of sanctification in the church they become so moved under the power of God that they to pour water inside of them and we God message people that are supposed to be way above those things way above Luther way above Westerly way above Azusa Street and plump into the fullness of the word and don't leave holy Christian Sanctified lives and when you see live a Sanctified life they say shallow it's not shallow how can it be shallow if you are not cleansed the children of Israel do you do you recognize that Pharaoh could not prevent the children of Israel from leaving Egypt no matter how much he tried what defeated the children of Israel wasn't pharaoh it's their own lust when they were in the wilderness they say oh we remember Egypt so memories of Egypt tormented them until they died in the wilderness my friends if it was like that with the first Exodus Hallelujah that's right my brother that's how it is as it was then so is it now we are in the 10 Exodus now we got also a prophet that preached come out and many have come down came out sorry and then now they are in the wilderness and many perish in the wilderness because the love of Egypt put them to the world they say let us organize the captain we remember the garlic we remember the things of Egypt because they when the desire of Egypt was never taken away from them what they should have seen say Lord take away the desire of Egypt from my heart because instead of looking back I need to look forward to the promised land because he that puts his hands on a plow to plow and look back well he's not going to have straight lines he's going to be all over the place he says you know that person is not fit for the kingdom that's what Jesus said so the children of Israel were plowing looking back looking back and they all perished in the wilderness and God said they'll never enter into my rest that's the time we are living in if we are entertaining so there's how many believe we have the very Exodus we are we are not a denomination of church but we are in the truth that Exodus because we have also a prophet like unto Moses that came in preached unto us and said come out from among them my people and be separate Hallelujah in touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you he preached that and many around the world in drugs they left all these nasty way of life in the world in the denominations and they say here we go we are going in the Exodus we are going in the journey and they started and they rejoiced at the Red Sea and they say we now know the truth of baptism they were baptized of baptism just like the children of Israel were baptized at the Red Sea so in the message the truth of baptism was restored and people rejoiced it that's the truth just like in the first Exodus with many of them God was not well pleased because they lasted after the things of the world they lasted after flesh they committed fornication they died in the wilderness they say give us flesh so the works of the flesh kill them and the Bible tells us what are the works of the flesh so the flesh must be conquered the flesh got to be conquered don't think I'm screaming at you but it's the spirit of God because why would you die when there is salvation in the house of God Deliverance is in the camp Jesus Christ is called the great emancipator he is the Redeemer of mankind Hallelujah the power to set people free Hallelujah and he that the son of man has set free is free indeed you can look back and say those Egyptians that used to conquer me I want to see them no more again I am free I am delivered Hallelujah so when some of us caught up in sin Hallelujah oh praise God and when that has happened you are so free Hallelujah you don't have to be worried oh I don't know what I'm gonna do if I'm just out of here I don't know if I'm just by my corner myself I may be found in the pornographic side and stuff like that you can walk in front because God has changed you Hallelujah so we preached the gospel of power to change Hallelujah change that we can believe in why do we sit there I'll tell you why I said there on sanctification in my experiences in my going around and looking at people and preaching in different settings I find that many people are not sanctified that's my experiences and when the spirit of God sometimes you're actually agitating to preach over there you're saying I want to preach this Dice Man it's nice to preach give me my Mountain it's nice to preach Sun stand still hallelujah it's the truth I ain't gonna go into my testimons God has given me testimonies where I spoke things and they happened that's not what I'm talking so it's not like there's none of that but you feel that no but that's a waste of time like Saul King Saul when he came to Samuel came he sees oh Blessed Be of the Lord have done all that you said and somehow looked and said how come I hear the ability of the Sheep how come I hear the mowing of the cows if you've done all that you need to do how come I'm hearing these things how come if we are supposed to be so energized to the word how come we are still smelling pornography you're still smelling nasty things in message churches how come why is the daughters of my people not healed the Bible says so we are not talking down to anybody never if we are like that then we cannot represent Christ correctly but sometimes he got to be said of that because the message in the last churches therefore and repent it's the Zeal to repent to repent is to turn away from wickedness it says Lord just as I am I come Set Me Free I Want to Be Free of this Hallelujah when you do it from your heart God will set him and set you free Hallelujah when you've done it from the heart and you will know and you go testify and say Jesus sets people free and people will be looking at you like what are you saying oh but it doesn't matter you know what you're saying so the kingdom of God is not in word only it's in power power to change lives which is written you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost you see we haven't even come to the Holy Ghost here we're just speaking of sanctification sanctification means the desire to sin has been rooted sorry uprooted the root is not there anymore you're looking like Noah and then you feel free You Feel clean you can raise hands and say thank you Lord then when you are like that Your Vessel for him to pour His holy spirit inside of us then Heine says like what it's clean water the problem if if this container was not clean the problem is not the water is the unclean container the water is okay but if the inside was dirty then I couldn't drink it but because it's clean I feel good I feel thirsty it quenches my thirst what I'm really after is the water but the container contains the water so then I can separate the water from the container because well the water has to be in a container the problem with people there handling the word of God with dirty hands their vessel that's dirty inside and they're trying to handle the word of God and they are trying to offer it to people to drink and well God looks at that and say no it's dirty he came over that you see but what's wrong with the word it's nothing wrong with the word it's the vessel that needs to be cleaned I can't seem to move from there let me go to a patrol coordinator because that's the way I've heard some confusion too Peter said to Jesus Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and he said blessed are thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed this to you Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will future tense I will give you the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven let us see what the prophet says about that because many remember when Peter was told that he proceeded to lie and deny Jesus Peter after confessing that Jesus was the Christ and God actually say you didn't get this Revelation from a man you proceeded to deny Jesus you proceeded to violently cut somebody's ear he just didn't denying Jesus he crushed whilst he was doing after going to mount Transfiguration and they transfigured Jesus Peter proceeded to deny him so if only you had the Matthew 17 experience where you say thou are the Christ if that's all you have you're gonna deny Jesus you need more than that my friends you need more than that say what can you get more than Revelation you need an experience because the Revelation leads you to an experience there's nothing wrong with that now it doesn't mean your Revelation is off it was correct but when when that happens you know what P what Jesus is is Simon when thou art converted strengthen your brother only them can you strengthen them he says master I'm ready to go with you even today they say Peter you're ready to go today this is verily I tell you tonight this morning you're gonna deny me not one time not two times three times and three is a witness and they say I'll never deny you even to death you think Peter was lying he meant it from his heart but when The Showdown comes men in this message when the Swiss comes they will deny this very message why because you'd think you want to let The Showdown comes then you need power it's no more about brother but I'm saying it's about what you say have you met Christ but look at that Peter after Pentecost Hallelujah you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost and then you look as a silver and gold I have none but such as I have I give unto you Hallelujah now the very same Peter when they say is Peter stopped preaching he said must we listen to men or must we listen to God why something had taken a hold of Peter it wasn't just the Peter saying Thou Art the Christ it wasn't just that Peter coming down from Mount configuration this was a change Peter when thou art converted strengthen your brethren the problem we have in message Cycles is that people are trying to strengthen people without a conversion you can only give power if you have power power doesn't come from someone who's powerless God help us and when this Peter but the Branham say this let's anchor it let's bring to what the messenger says so that we understand we ain't saying this is just one this many it says Abraham's Covenant confirmed he says and now notice Peter with the keys what are those keys let's see we don't have to second guess I thank God for a prophet amen it wasn't the gospel of a Kentucky Irish man that converted me it was the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because somebody didn't believe God and took Jesus to my people hallelujah I don't care how you look like Hallelujah he was the message of God hallelujah when I read that I heard Hallelujah the voice of my Mecca calling not the voice of William Branham but the voice of the Archangel of God hallelujah that's what we are converting by Hallelujah so when Psalm resent it because of the way you look to me it's not a Kentucky man to me it's not a an Irish man to me it's not an American it's the Gospel of Jesus Hallelujah doy and Irishman preached it so I heard that the voice of my theophany calling Hallelujah come up here Hallelujah I believed Hallelujah thank you Jesus because that Ministry was sent forth to change me Hallelujah in the last days in an age that is Luke on that is powerless you know what the Bible says about this age it says men in the last days he said they shall have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof so many in the message say cause they got a form of Godless brother Branham says cannot make peace with their brothers and sisters which Heaven are you going to Hallelujah the word of God transforms you that your enemies becomes your friends if it isn't done that you are just a religious person denying the power of Pentecost not a denomination because this Pentecost denomination so that's not what we are talking about to prove that now Peter with the Keys of the Kingdom how many believe God gave him the keys that brother Branham asked Jesus did sure I did and when did he use them because I've heard some say this kiss and have searched to see what the messenger says and I've listened to some message preaches I'm like but that's not what the messenger says where are you getting it from because somebody said oh it was the Revelation and that's what he said let's hear what the messenger says it says sure he did and when did he use them in Acts too to the Jews then went right down to the Samaritans although Philip had went down and baptized them in the name of Jesus Christ but they did not receive the Holy Ghost as yet because Peter had the key to the Holy Ghost so the key was open in the Holy Ghost to the three groups of people the Jew asked to the Samaritans when Philip yeah I'd say and then come down and lay these ends upon them and receive the Holy Ghost so that's Peter using the key and then guess what what's the Next Generation the next class they're Gentile he went up and opened the gospel to the Gentiles that's correct that that's Cornelius and from that there was no more need of Simon Peter's keys cause it's already open to all the world so we preached the gospel of the Kingdom that's what brother said this Spirit came in the church ages [Applause] the locusts did that until the whole bride tree stripped down there's no restoration of gifts there is nothing but God promised and say I will restore what the years the conquer woman the caterpillar and all the different insects they've eaten in his day and you shall preach they just shall live by faith repent and give your life to the Lord but don't stay there I want to sanctify you so he was restoring the truth to the church and we say Wesley preached sanctification no point of correction You Preach justification and sanctification he added he didn't take away what Luther had he had what was he doing he was going back to the fullness of Truth after that they went on after a while people see but there is more to God we want power and then afterwards Azusa Street came forth but they had and the messenger they didn't have a messenger said see more started that so he wasn't the messenger of the age so they thought they had the fullness of Medicals they didn't they had the restoration of the gifts so they preached justification sanctification and restoration of gifts and people say oh Pentecost is back in the church oh God you're going too fast I must need to have a wet restoration and the word restoration came by William Branham and when the word restoration had come the fullness of the baptism could come back in the church that's just as true as it is I hope you don't resent that Hallelujah and when that it come if the fullness of the word is come the fullness of the baptism is to come the fullness of the Holy Ghost is to come in the church Hallelujah back to the beginning where the church where the gifts of God fell Hallelujah when the Virgin Mary moved under the power of God Hallelujah when Paul's looked at does he have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe Hallelujah when William Branham come down and say when the doctor locked in my face and said Son have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe say it was something that I wanted it was something that I earned for Hallelujah because I never expect to get it among those people but God gave me a pill of great pies Hallelujah and then he started preaching that but that wasn't all so that we can now stand as placed sons of God you see how far we are running people even sanctified only then only then when the Holy Ghost come then you are tested when the Holy Ghost come you just say oh oh I got the Holy Ghost now I'm gonna speak squirrels into auxiliary you've got to be tested and proven you got to look at people that are loved ones and they don't like you like Joseph [Applause] only then when you have been proven and you can't even get along with your brothers and you're talking the power of the spoken word which one friends if I don't say these things I'm useless to you because I'll be just saying things to make somebody happy as much as I'm talking to you I'm talking to myself each one of us is not exempt from the word of God we're
