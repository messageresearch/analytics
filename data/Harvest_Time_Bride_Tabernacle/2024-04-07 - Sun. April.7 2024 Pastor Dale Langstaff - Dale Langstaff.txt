Cloud whichever you would desire Lord God would come in this place Hallelujah and your people would be so consumed that like the disciples said their hearts burned that it would affect even our outer Badger skin and we'd make a great worship to you may it be so Lord God take away all the evil starchiness from us God formal and cold and indifference Lord God may we worship you as you are this day we pray amen amen hallelujah you may have your seats for a minute God bless you it's a great uh great privilege to be here and just uh just welcome you every single one hugely God bless you and thank you brother Matt just I thank you for catching the spirit of where the Holy Spirit wants to take us this morning you know I pray if I'm ever guilty of something in my Ministry it will be bringing caution and warning to us that the rapture's close if I if I'm going to have a fault I'll just lean that way call me an extremist crazy man or something because I don't ever want to get there and see one of you come up and say well you know if I would have knew it was really that close really that close it's really that close it's really that close don't be deceived by our our lifestyle in our modern technology and and stuff that's around us it can be a blessing and and and we need to live I understand that just uh just a little preview of of Wednesday night amen it's been a a blessing to me amen and uh you know our we read a quote I'm not going to reread them just a short clips is that is that all right just brother Bram said that you would see God in everything in nature and because of our modern lifestyle we are removed from nature and we're like the kids that say well mount comes from the grocery store and brown mount comes from a brown cow and and you know uh like cuz we're removed from the Natural Life The Prophet said that if the the Christians the Believers had not watched the skies during jesus' time they would have never known that he was coming to bethle but this time he's not coming to Bethlehem only he's coming in a grand Rapture and it will be like the saint now you think about that he said if the Christians then had to watch the skies and they would have been so modern that they were watching our iPads and computers which are are not evil in themselves they would have never had wise men come to Jesus and they would have never had the shepherd come to Jesus which was part of his plan and you know there's some amazing things and and I'm not you know we don't brother Dale don't know the day and if I did I'm a liar um that's what the Bible says but we are in the season I'm looking I'm looking for a land called Bula I'm I'm consumed with it I'm beside myself and you're not going to find it in another country not even another good country I'm I'm consumed with it we're going to find it in glory amen and you know uh just a just a just carry on Wednesday night's thought you know there was a ship that hit the the the major uh bridge in the states and the there was a painter that's dead now and past you know God God spoke through a donkey in the Bible because a prophet wouldn't listen to him you know so am man he don't don't put God in your box say you know that's a little far out there because he's still Jehovah amen and this painter's dad this painter painted six bridges that were all broken half two of them had ships running into them and the name of the ship wrote The Anthem for the states which is the fall of the states which is falling in the river so the states has fallen their national anthem has fallen and just this week God sent lightning habol to lightning down to the Statue of Li Liberty and it was photographed the very same week that Biden's pulling back from Israel the states has fallen and the one painting that was set up on that bridge that was painting was the falling bridge and the ladder to heaven the falling bridge was making a ladder to heaven and the exact time that the the boat hit the bridge there's is the exact date that a movie's coming out that's the end of the world that might not mean nothing might not mean nothing nothing but God's still God and and he's still real and we're close let's stand and read his word man just as you're standing just some announcements uh Joseph Brother Joseph from uh uh uh Gerard Samuel's Church in Scarboro Toronto will be with us uh April 28th he was here last summer uh Thomas epison is going to be here May 5th he's an EV he's a missionary from Ghana he was here 5 years ago um he will be here May 5th and Ben norrod will be here May 11th and 12th I I maybe I haven't got confirmed but I believe maybe Samantha will come with them if that works out May 11th is Saturday it'll be at 4:00 May 11th will be at 4:00 and Sunday regular time Ben Nora that Sunday that Ben Nora R's here uh brother Joseph's church or brother Jose sorry Jose's church will be with us that Sunday and that Sunday morning we're having a uh that's Mother's Day we're having a barbecue pig roast delivered so mothers can just relax and sleep in and chill and the brothers are going to bring the potos and carrots amen and the pig will be good even if the potatoes and carrots aren't amen amen oh brother Matt I loveed that bu of land song and shine on me I just almost lost my mind just God knowing what he's laid on my heart amen just uh really really good man let's turn to Second Peter 112 and 13 and you can have your seats and uh I just uh you know sometimes as a as a minister second Peter 1 12 and 13 you know sometimes uh thoughts will come to me and I will start a message and as the message goes it'll either grow but it'll even go down a different Avenue and I was uh you know uh preaching on the end times thinking of the end times and and and it's kind of changed from there and and uh it is the end times but I want to God wants to bring something to our attention therefore I will not be neglected that you put always in remember remember these things though ye know them and be established in this present truth now if I preach something brand new you know I pray to God that we never lose the the thrill and the excitement of the revelation of this day I like what haven't you heard there's nothing brother Dale can tell you that you haven't already heard Hallelujah yay I think it me as long as I am in this Tabernacle this is right before Peter was killed that I stir you up by putting you in remembrance Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless the word and bless your bride and may you fall in this place we pray in a special way amen amen you may have your seats amen we just want to read another scripture maybe uh just up above that let's just move up to verse uh 2 and four in the same chapter there Amy first uh second second Peter 1 2 and 4 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and our Lord Jesus Christ according to as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness though through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue therefore whereby sorry are given unto us exceeding great that's pretty good and precious promises that by by these you might be partakers that means not viewers only partakers partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust Hallelujah beautiful scriptures that God had to us you know I want to preach on partakers this morning and I want to preach on title it the day of the Lord this morning and I want to just lay a foundation you know brother Brown talked about this you know we are the children of light and you know totally we believe in predestination and election and all these things and they're the greatest promises in the Bible there's nothing better than that but but we are affected by our Badger skin and you know we're going to talk about worship some this morning and noise amen and brother bam says it like this and I I'm going to this is a little bit longer quote and I'm just going to slow down and read it and then we'll move on and we'll preach amen the least little bit of light will expose Darkness certainly that's the way life does it in the presence of death and that's the way it is that's the way right does in the presence of wrong that's why Faith does in the presence of doubt and it scatters it away and how can you the night stay here when the sun is shining her blessings through where does the night go it is no more what happens to the night where's the darkness this Tabernacle about 12 hours ago was completely dark but where's the darkness now he said it's concealed inside these walls here it is no more it's vanished why the light has come in and when the light comes in the darkness goes yes sir and he said you take the creatures now we're going to get down to ourself now now if if we're the creatures of light we it's just going to be nature that you're going to be light but if you're the creatures of Darkness you're going to be like the crotch roaches and The Beetles and all the animals that when you come in and flick on the light they scatter and so is it exactly the same when the presence of God and the word of God comes on the scene if you don't feel comfortable when somebody's getting blessed if you don't feel comfortable when the word of God and the revelation of God is coming through that was given in this day that we've come into everything in the word is ours the fullness of the word and we're coming to the Statue of the perfect man and if some you know our brother I kind of got this anointing you know when our brother was here he was preaching on uh you know maturity and and and coming up into full adoption and you can see it by our actions and reactions and I want to look at a scripture as we look into this so let's watch this he said they the creatures of night scatter and when the when the sunshine raises and the light flashes how they take to the darkness that's the way the gospel is he said when it flashes on them what happens to those who want to be called The Holy Roller he said if they're dark Darkness they'll Flee for the night and make fun of it he said because their children of darkness and the children of the day will walk right in to thy presence he said and the children of Light by the grace of God so when the light flashes on us we thank God that we walk with our eyes open looking at the things that we can see with our natural eyes and for by faith is the substance of things that we hope for and the evidence of things that we cannot see you know there was a story in the Bible talked about a message believer and he was connected to the message truth of his day and he wanted to be connected to the prophet of the day so he invited them over to his house but he was a children of darkness and so he had only done it for popularity for different reasons he had invited the parit of the day over this was Jesus and he came in his house and there was a sinner woman that came in his house that had a terrible life and a terrible story and she came and she took special ointment and she Anointed The Prophet's feet Jesus feet Jehovah's feet and she cried over his feet and it made the person of night uncomfortable wait a minute wait a wait a minute wait a minute that was a message believer he invited the prophet over to his house and Jesus asked this brother a question and I'd like to read that question he said he turned to the woman and said unto Simon he said see us thou This Woman This is Luke 7 sorry Luke 7:44 for where we're at now see is this woman and she washed she's entered into thine house and she G see is this woman and I entered into thy house and thou gavest me no water for my feet you didn't want to worship me you didn't want to really praise me you didn't really want to shout amen and jump up and down you didn't want to run the aisles you sat near the back he said but she has come in your house and she has washed my feet with your tears she has wiped them with her hair of her head thou gavest me watch does he goes back to him now he said you hadn't give him no water he said you didn't give me no kiss he said but this woman since the time that she came in has not ceased to kiss my feet hello this is in Luke by the way to kiss my feet I don't think you heard me that's like foot washing but I've never seen anybody kiss feet foot washing what we're get to the good part and my and she had anointed my head with the oil but this woman has not just anointed my head but anointed my feet also and let's drop to 47 verse 47 and she and he said therefore I say unto thee her sins which were many are forgiven for she loved much there's a reason why we have trouble the reason is because we feel like we were born in the message hear me Church this is Brother Dale too we feel like we've been born in the message and we feel like we live a Holiness life and we don't you know I want to tell you something just on the side view you know if we don't have real we're in we're in big trouble we're lost okay so I'll show you what the the children of Darkness I just just even yesterday I went to see brother Jim yesterday and we were paying at the restaurant you know you know the well I got to be careful because we're online there's a church in sarna that's the next denomination to our church and they have a rock concert coming in this week or soon the tickets are 30 bucks a person or 35 or something rock it says right on Rock it's Pentecostal and the I was paying at the tail and there was a a a singing group there Harmony by Voices was three people and the this is truth bake evangelic ja however I can't talk Church in ch and the one person had an earring in his nose like a like a hog we used to put them in Hogs so they wouldn't hurt the other pigs because it hurt their own nose and the other one had big earrings men you know the B talks about slaves and they're going to the foolish virgin to sing they're going to fake worship because they ain't got real worship but we're the B bride of Christ and we've been forgiven much and the Bible says that the much is given much is required amen and what is required of us is worship amen and I going tell you something it is impossible I believe me I can show you the scripture if God will allow us today we'll get to it it is impossible for the Holy Ghost to come down and noise and disrupt the service it's not possible it's not over not even in church order and Doctrine I've preached in places where people got completely stain slain Stone drunk screaming I'll tell you what you don't need notes when you're preaching in a place like that you talk about the power of almighty God falling on that place I've been in places where people dance or run or jump or and it never side affected me at all it never affected the anointing coming in and if it affected anybody out there it's because you were a child a creature of darkness and you wanted to scatter to the darkness watch what Jesus said here he said to to M to uh for she loveth much but to whom little is Forgiven now now this is God talking here this ain't a prophet no more this is God to whom little is Forgiven the same loveth little that's our problem right there we could go home if you have trouble entering into worship you don't actually believe that Jesus did much for you that's right to whom very little is Forgiven well you know bless God I was a pretty good man and I didn't really have a lot of dark sins you know cuz I didn't go in that way and you know I was near as bad as whoa who who who whoa who who who all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and deserve how Eternal damnation all have sinned even the elect have sinned but predestination saved them here he says here because whom little is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said in verse 48 and he said to her he said thy sins be forgiven thee you see this believer this Philistine that had invited Jesus to his house was rich and increased with Goods he was he had a position in the church he probably was the backup preacher or something and he wanted Jesus to be associated in his fivefold click but he put himself equal with Jesus so he didn't have to wash jesus' feet because Jesus could wash his feet I'm just as good as you you know I got to turn around call her too I'm just so see he put himself equal with God so he didn't lower himself to worship to wash God's feet to give him a kiss or to kiss even his feet now that's humility that's humility I wonder if we have our forgiveness wrong I wonder if we feel like you know the Bible says that no man comes to the father unless the father draws them you know but most most denominations believe that well you know we had a good preacher come in we paid him a lot of money he was a Ben norrod you know and I I decided I was in the the back pew and I wasn't going to go to the altar but you know I made a cud decision this would be a good time to go because you know he's a good preacher and and I I and it was i i i i i i i and God's just like oh my goodness no mud come to the father except the father drew them you had absolutely nothing less than nothing to do with where you are today it was all election and calling you know that's why the Bible said we read make your calling an election sure by by showing whether you're a CH Child of Light or a child of darkness by how you scatter when the presence of God Falls by how you scatter when you're around Believers be how you scatter when the revelation of the word's coming forth be how you scatter a you don't have to tell me nothing I just watch do you like being around the atmosphere do you lose your mind in the atmosphere do you get drunk very easy in the I'm talking about real Holy Ghost filled atmosphere in Isaiah 646 it says but we are all as unclean thing and all our righteousness as is with filthy filthy oh oh bless God I read the prophet I listen to him and I study in my as filthy rags that's how much all you're studying is filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind that has taken us away oh but you know I what I'm trying what God's trying to show us this morning is what we are will show and and I I I get scared as a minister that that we could be deceived and thinking that we're okay and be like the ones that'll get to heaven and say but God by God I sat in the prophet's meanings bless God and by God I passed out message books bless God by God I prayed for somebody in his he got healed and God will say you did because children of light are children of Darkness amen Isaiah 647 and8 for there is none that are called upon thy name that stirreth up himself because of our iniquities now now now this is kind of important because I'm we're trying to get rid of our own Holiness and get the real genuine Jo Jehovah there is none called upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee uh-oh well what am I going to do with my good life for thou has hid thy face from us and H has consumed us because of our iniquities verse eight but now oh Lord Thou Art our father and we are aha there it puts our position he's the boss and we're the clay and he's the Potter and you know when Potter's making clay it's pliable so it's doing some Glory Hallelujah and it don't affect the Potter any cu he's working with you he said we are the clay and thou art the Potter and we are the works of thy handiwork be not worthy very sore be thy wrath not very sore oh Lord neither remember our iniquities anymore God help us in this time you know we need to and and you know we we we we had a wonderful service here today so this this ain't just bear with me I'm preaching to myself here but remember what the prophet said you're a children of light and if you're like Darkness you won't feel comfortable in the presence of of God Amen we need to not let Satan take our blessing from us and your blessing will be in worship and you say well how can that be well Paul and Silas got put in jail and Paul it was unlawful for him to be put in jail because he was one of them and he got beaten which was unlawful because they were actually scared that he would charge them and so like he didn't feel good when he came to church he would have stayed home and sat in the coach he would have watched from the coach guaranteed I mean praise God we got a lot of polls that would have stayed home they were beaten wrongfully and they went to a miserable jail where they had rats as big as muskrats and they had no air condition and they put their feet in stocks and they sat on the stone and it was wet and cold and the Bible says how did they do it how did they do it that they started to worship God they move beyond their circumstances they move beyond their bills they move beyond their their their domestic they move beyond their problems they move beyond their they moved Beyond everything on Earth they didn't pray they didn't pray they had no promise that God would throw them out of jail they had no like prophecy they just worship and God God erupted the foundations of some of those buildings that stand for thousands of years thousands of years amen watch this quote of our prophet he said you know I'm an American citizen and I have the right to do whatever I want to bless God he said that's your American privilege he said it's your American privilege but if you're a Christian but if you're a Christian privilege he said for Christians you are sheep and sheep forfeit their rights he said it lay still just lay and let it taken away from you the rights that are rightfully yours you know I'm preaching to myself CU brother Dale thinks is a Canadian and you know things that's happened in history I said bless God you know that's our constitution what's the government doing Paul was beaten to the point that the people that put him in the jail were were afraid because they' done it wrongfully and watch how they were I it just came to me and I I have the scripture in front of me but Paul was beaten because there was a woman that was possessed with a familiar Spirit a demon and the the other Christians were making a profit offer kind of sounds like a rock group coming to a place called Church making a prophet and Paul cast that demon out of them and the Christian people were angered because they saw their benefits of wealth Blown Away wrongfully put in jail for doing good he was put in jail amen but because of the power of worship let's go back to our our quote here he said you forfeit your right it lays it still lays still and it lets you take it away from it all the rights that's yours he said but the goat will kick up a storm about it that's right he said but sheep will forfeit its rights and a Christian always forfeits I don't like this one this really Burns me their National R oo you mean I can't stand on the constitution of Canada don't that burn you up Burns me up bless God that's the law they broke the law what's that got to do with God you forfeit it this exact a Christian always forfeits their National rights oh Bo if it's contrary to their Christian rights wow God help us you know brother brandham talked about when he came to Canada that we were cold and starchy and formal but and we are praise God but we're not Canadian and if you are you're in big trouble you're in really big trouble now she I mean you were in trouble in the beginning of Canada but now there's just and we've let Satan brother Dale let Satan just say this is just for me this ain't for none of you be shy inverted backward oh bless God that's not my personality I don't want your personality anyway your personality was formed in sin if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost there ain't no shy there ain't no cold there ain't no bashfulness there ain't no formal it gives you great wisdom unbelievably wisdom and unbelievable worship and what we got to figure out is how much have you been forgiven how much did God do for you you know they show you know in our modern world you know they have lotteries and all these things and you know normally when people get a big gift they really show it but you got eternal life amen I have a scripture here if I just find it in all this uh here you know God help us God help us our worship you know what literally now I'm I'm I'm going to the far left but I want you to realize no amount of noise in this service can interfere with the Holy Spirit Satan cannot interfere with God's plan that's right it's not possible and for sure if it was caused by God but I'm going to get to places where brother Brown said every place God is it's no easier than this the hardest sermons I ever preach is to a quiet audience amen you know we we we if we had the revelation of we would go to Eternal damnation not sorry that's not Eternal but be lost forever and ever cuz hell ain't Eternal forgive me but be lost forever and ever or eternally in Paradise we'd have to put guards on these windows Insight brother Brown talked about a sister that came to him and said I never got nothing out of your service because there was one person in the service just screaming and shouting and amen and all this that brother Brown said if they wouldn't have been doing that this is a Vindicated Prophet the a brother Dale said I couldn't have even preached I couldn't even have preached that's right I couldn't even have preached that's how much it Disturbed him amen you know in the Old Testament in Exodus 24 or Exodus 28 sorry I just want to give you uh a a preview of this is the priest when they went into the holy of holies they had the Gown around them and they wore the golden Bells under gown and some of those verses brother Brown commented 10 and 50 times and even in the Old Testament before the baptism of the Holy Ghost was given everything was noise number one it was brother Braham said this he said in the quotes he said every place there's life there's noise amen so is there anybody alive you won't scare God or you won't scare me if you're noisy and he said the priests would go and when they walked they knew that they were alive but it actually he repeatedly said it played to him holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty the whole time he said holy holy holy is Lord God Almighty holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty holy holy holy and it was loud enough that through the badger skins with no fake instruments the whole congregation could hear the worship to God holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty you know there's another story in the Bible where when Jesus came in on the donkey and the F Sadducees and Pharisees came to him and said remember these were religious people you know hey you need to tone it down a bit and Jesus said to them if they tone down one second that immediately immediately ain't a second long that immediately the Rocks we cry out I wonder how close our Stones get to that in the parking lot I wonder seriously it's not possible and you see you can say well you know I was never raised that way I thought it was reverence or I thought it was disrespect I'm giving you Bible I'm giving you Bible it has nothing to do with respect that's a lie of Lucifer he's taken your blessing and he's taking God's blessing because we were made let me tell you that we were made you were made to be noisy to worship and see brother Dale's going through this I said I was preaching to myself you know I had a couple hard days this week and when we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not supposed to be affected by the environment around us when we're in the inner holy of holies you know I want to tell you something you're looking for something God doing I had a brother 5 hours away message me he said brother Dale you were really on my heart today I kept bringing you before God I said brother there was a reason there was a reason I had talked to him for weeks you want to see a power of God move it just happened it just happened it just happened it's because you can get so consumed with everything that's going on in your environment decisions and should I move should I buy should I sell should I should I should I build a bunker should I should I should I should I should I invest should I should I go should I go on a trip should I go to mfield you can be consumed you know what you can be consumed in the ministry you don't be biased the prophet and he had a special gift said why in the world do you go hunting he said because I'm always giving out and he said out there I fill up oh there I fill up nobody's made to just give out non-stop except Jehovah that's why there will be young Brothers in this church it's not about brother Dale brother Dale might go on a Hol you know what we were just at the the home show and the people the good friends in town here and they're going to a funeral and the people are 60 Lan turned 60 this year let that sink in you don't think God's called in you in the ministry brother Dale could go home this year and you have to still carry on till the Rapture it's not a oneman ministry that's why we have specials and and worship and testimonies and and teachers and Prophets and and and missionaries that we can buy their plane ticket and send them to Uganda and the pastor can stay here one of you Brothers can go over there and preach and they don't cost you nothing or or or where I just mentioned that it could be a Salvador we got to quit worshiping some big priest or some big and worship God and get into the the Holiness of worship and we need to get rid of the devil that says oh bless God I'm Sor or bless God they might look at me when you when you're in this when and I'm not talking about making rock and roll I'm talking about when the sweet Spirit touches your heart and you come into the you know what you decide brother bam says that I might not get to these quotes because I you know I'll lose them but he said you make a decision when you come into the house of God you it's a calcal decision am I a Christian did God do anything for me it's it's your mental it's it I mean like God can go past that but if you want to fall asleep in church you can when you when brother M started singing this song I'm thinking of BU land I'm think oh my goodness I'm looking for a city and a place who Builder and maker is Jehovah God it's not going to buy a house in O Salvador buy a house in Uganda or buy a house in Mexico or a cottage in the North Pole I want to buy a house in Jehovah and and Glory we got to get out of this place it's nuts a prophet said it's going completely insane and Insanity in a sound mind can't stay together oh church we we should just oh you know the the prophets in the bible they got so caught up with God God is so close to God that they were closer to Heaven than Earth the easiest way you'll ever do that is not studying the message the devil studies the message daily it's worship the devil cannot worship God remember that Satan got kicked out of heaven because he wanted the worship the greatest thing in Earth is worship and there's nobody on Earth nobody on Earth but a predestinated elected called chosen an already glorified bride that can worship God hallelujah you're already a part of him you don't anybody else ain't even connected you should be just W and worship amen oh Hallelujah God help us watch's here and thirsting for life in 58 he said and it's a bit of a longer quote but it's a good one he said we have nothing to be sad about oh boys I wish you could have told me that on Tuesday oh Bo he said we got everything to be happy about about no wonder the people no wonder he said we got everything to be happy about no wonder the people get noisy do we have the fault of being too noisy I'll answer that question for you no I mean close so then you must not be happy he said it's enough to make them get noisy he said I kind of like little noise this is a Prophet by the way he said it's a sign that you're alive he said you know anything I can prove it that scientifically if it isn't make noise he said it's Dad so if you got your religion and you don't get a little noisy bury it we need we got some shovels there's a snow shovel outside he said but as long as there's noise there's still life listen I I I I I need some life I need something real I want somebody here that can turn on the light Jehovah God I'm not talking about a flesh body I'm talking about a supernatural body he said so as long as we can still see people that's got enough of God in their heart to say Amen this is the I'm I'm still reading the quote in the presence of their oh watch this oh man our it's amazing in the presence of their boss oh I say let's read on let's

is better than life it's talking about eternal life it's eternal life do you know that you are one of the very very very very very very very few people in Canada that know where you're going when God

with feathers that the atomic bombs won't even come through it because we won't be here when the atomic bombs go through you know the prophet said we won't be here when the Tabernacle is built and Israel we won't be here yeah that's right Hallelujah did you ever think did you ever think that we're holding up to Rapture because you are quiet did you ever think that did you ever think that the last one has come in but because of stone quiet do you know that God wasn't even God in the beginning was Elohim because God is an object of worship and you know that only the elect bride can even worship the Rocks those rock concerts that are coming to the other places that are called the church is it's not called worship that's called Rock wow Church oh we got to get rid of our Canadian system citizenship take your passport home and just beat it well not you brother B you got to go over tomorrow you know you know what I'm saying we got to get out our Heavenly passport we got to say

Tabernacles or the humates they're filled CU they love their devil that's their God they really know how to do it and they're going to hell and they're going to hell the Illuminati make Lucifer their God because of the knowledge in the garden that he had the ability to reason wow that's what I said holy smokes you want to read the book just read it in there it took me about seven years to read it and it might make you lose seven years of sleep and all blessed God our politicians have all went to those baby sacrifice places and those illuminatis and kissed the ring and done all those sacrifices of just vomit from Hell listen church we are not Canadian citizens we are not a part of this world and we need to re brother Brown said that the noisiest place you'll ever get to is heaven and we need to run him tough competition right here in Wyoming can you imagine can you imagine sister Patty when you come to those Pearly Gates I tell you what brother Dale is going to lose us like all control is going to be gone and you can experience that right here because of the predestinated word you can you are all in God's mind you're already glorified you're already past those ply dayses I tell you you what they must yeah and if it don't affect you like that Jesus oh God help me and when Jesus passed this way he said strange thing he said I was sitting waiting he said and some noise came around the corner he said it's a strange thing whenever that Jesus is at wherever Jesus is at there's always a lot of noise am you know you know noise is a sign of life he said see remember the high this is a different quote by the way remember the high Priestly dress I talked about rest in the holy of holies and the Garment and the the would play Holy uh Play Holy Holy Holy and make noise in the holy of holies in the Tabernacle and he said where there ain't noise then might it might be dead he said well I think that's a whole lot the matter with our churches amen today it I put up three quotes sorry three quotes connected to this a whole lot the matter with their churches today there this a direct quote there's a whole lot to matter with our churches today there is not enough noise this the same Prophet that work wrote Church order and Doctrine yeah that's right there is not enough noise about it not enough enthusiasm and not enough of something and so where where Jesus is there's always noise that's in he was to pass by this way in a 64 quote after the seals 6403 21b he said one time he came to Jerusalem and they were screaming and hollering hosan to Kings in the highest uh Hosanna to the king that cometh in the name of the Lord and some of the priests standing there said make them keep their peace and he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out and something has to move watch this watch this watch this something has to move when Jesus is around something has to move when Jesus is around that's paragraph 103 of 6403 21b Hallelujah Hallelujah he said here in Luke 1937 to 40 Amy you can pull this up Luke 19:37 he said and when Jesus came nigh even to descend on the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing and praising God did they have more than you have they didn't have the Revelation you have they didn't have the seals open they didn't have all the Mysteries revealed started praising God rejoicing and praising God and God with a loud voice for all the multitudes M Mighty works that they had seen has anybody seen any multiple works that are worth praising God for in their life in the last year amen in the last week I can say that's right amen are you breathing try to make oxygen thank youen amen verse 38 saying blessed is the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory to the highest and verse 39 and some of the Pharisees among them rebuked the master and the disciples and he answered he said I tell you that these will hold their peace the stones will immediately craw out I want to give you in closing some scriptures and we'll shut her down but I I I intentionally showed you multiple scriptures spread out through the Testament New Testament Paul in jail you know Jesus going into the Mount of Olives uh the the woman that washed jesus' feet kissed his feet so those are new testament even even that one Jesus it was himself Jesus in worship and gratitude so now we're going to go to the Old Testament and there was one person in the Old Testament that had a mind after God's Own Heart amen and he really knew how to worship he knew how to say I'm sorry God and KN how to worship that's all that was qualified he said oh Psalms uh 471 I'm just going to read some quick and we're going to come down to a quote that a couple quotes and and it it's just really good oh clap your hands oh ye people and shout unto God the voice of Triumph I don't know how you get quiet out of that Psalms uh 49 uh 3 Psalms 49:3 Let Us Praise His Name in a dance and let us sing praises unto him with the tambourine and the harp and if you go to verse one in that same chapter praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song Praise Him all the congregation of the Saints and if you jump to verse 6 and I'm sorry I put it like that I found more as I was studying in verse 6 it says in 149 it says let the high priest High let the high praises of God be in their mouth and the two-edged sword in their hands Hallelujah here in Psalms 98 it says Make a Joyful Noise of the Lord all the Earth and make a loud noise and rejoice in the singing a praise that's verse four and verse 5 it says Sing unto the Lord with the harp and with the harp and the voice of the Psalms in verse 6 and with the triumphs and the sounds and the counters and Make a Joyful Noise before the Lord and the king and let the floods verse eight and let the floods clap their hands and let the hills be joyful together even nature you know when you study the prophet said the coyote holand you know when the prophet got blessing ran around the tree and he was getting the revelation of God and he said if anybody come by they'd put me in a crazy house he was talking about nature praising God you know what you know praise God for all you that got birds around your house I'm going to confess we open our window some morning and we have a yard full of evergreen trees and I'll tell you what in the spring holy cow they have Camp meaning I've closed the one I said holy smokes are those birds loud 4:00 in the morning before it's even right for any human being to be awake the the music the loud an coming have I not slammed us like 4:30 it's just like w and God's up there just sucking it all in just sucking it all Hallelujah Psalms 34 1-3 let us bless the Lord at all times Praise Him continually in our mouth that's not just on Sunday and my soul shall make her boast in the Lord and humble humble shall hear thereof and be glad oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together taste and see that the Lord is good you know if you can't do that you need to do some tasting you need to go to a buffet called glory and T some of Salvation and healing and and the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes sir that's right hallelujah amen acts is where Paul cast out the spirit of the woman we're going to just passed by that he said in Redemption 54 he said what a great pleasure the believer has knowing that he's living in doing something pleasing the Lord why if we would look for watch this this is beautiful why if we was looking for the coming of the Lord why I thought you weren't supposed to talk about the Rapture you're overemphasizing that brother Dale you know I'm so sick of hearing that Rapture talk you know we've been hearing that since I was born you know you know Paul talked about the Rapture in Corinthians he said the time was short in Corinthians that was a while ago I don't see a lot wrong with Paul's life he said why if we were looking for the coming of the Lord like we should be looking for it why my there would be no friction nowhere I don't care what anybody else does I'm looking for one thing that's the Rapture there can to be a tornado beside me but it's a Rapture I'm I'm thinking one thing is that telling me the raptures I'm going to still plant my beans I'm not going to get in a hurry I'm play them late May I'll have less weeds because maybe the Rapture will come I know you think I'm crazy but I'm not and if I am just leave me like I am man everybody would be in love and there'd be Harmony now now let's just back that up how are we going to get in love look for the Rapture today let's talk about the Rapture and we'll be in love today amen he said if everybody was in love oh wouldn't it uh he said everybody would be in love and there would be Harmony wouldn't that be wonderful and you know he may come he may come actually today now he said that in 54 11:14 in redeemed of judgment now he must have been crazy but I want to be the same crazy cuz he could come today you know when we get done I think he'll wait till we finish our fellowship CU that'll be the good send off and then we'll just we'll leave all their cars for everybody else to drive praise God hallelujah I hope they enjoy them he may come today and I don't know what's left that's right it's just the time for him to come wow for anybody that thought I was overemphasizing that it could come this year he thought it would come in 54 he didn't see nothing left in 54 H hello hello it really changes your thinking pattern now I'm not talking about us being on wise you know if you live to be 80 don't come to me to feed you I mean I'll try to feed you but you know what I'm saying we need to be wise but we need to have something else really weighing the other side of the scales you know my you know we did some far out stuff this week I actually had a real estate person come byy and considered selling a farm now that to my father would be worse than a divorce or equal that would be equal to a divorce but you know before he died he said something he said Dale if you're going to go out and do something invest something this is good advice by the way he was a smart man and it's it's not going to do you no good in your life don't bother what are we building a kingdom for when we're not even here I mean that's some kind of a weird Kingdom I'm not I'm not against I I mean I believe it's even scriptural to leave things you know whatever's left whoever can have behind but he said you know he was talking about buying something he said if you're going to buy something and it's not going to help you your whole life buy groceries why would you buy it that's called working for GM or that's called working for New Holland or John Deere you know you can just be so chained to the ball and chain that everywhere you swing you just send it directly to John that's not my kingdom you see to me but we should be so consumed I'm thinking like and you just walk out and and God God will tell you God will tell you he'll tell you in different ways you just got to have the ear say if God's pushing you he'll push you off but if he's saying you maybe not watch this he said it's time for him to come he said what if we were all have that in our what if we all have that in our hearts this morning he's talking about that it's time for him to come that today was the last day we ought to live every day like it was the last day and this would be the last day all in love I I just wonder what like if if we were going to go in the Rapture would we worship God I wonder would if we knew you know if the dad ones start coming to our door and we recognize them and the prophet said that only the ones that are going in the Rapture will recognize the ones that come to the door and the neighbors will be looking at them and I'm going to be talking to brother Wade or my dad or somebody and you know the neighbors looking at me and go oh brother Dale he's he's he's went off on the cuckoo and I can see them perfectly right in front of me and I'm thinking well they went off in the cuckoo no somebody's cuckoo here he said would we what I want to say is if you would do anything different if you knew the Rapture was happening today if you knew the Rapture was going to happen happen next Sunday during the worship would it be louder would you be more involved in the worship next Sunday morning if you absolutely knew that in the middle of the worship service God was going to lift your body right you were going to get a body change oh holy smokes I know the answer for me that's right amen wow I might read some more scriptures but I want to read a last quote he said what would diamel do this is a quote in 62 the wisdom versus face he said what would Dio do and I'm like who's Domino is that a person is that God is that another name I never heard of it so I went to Google and diamel is a charge of energy in a movement of electricity but I like the bottom of diamondo I'm a diamondo and I want to be more of a diamondo I want every one of you to be diol crazy he said diol in a human is a highly electric person uh in I can't even say that word explosive person with symptoms like a ball of fire a fireball a Powerhouse a selfstarter an Evangelical person are unusually uh intensive let's go to our prophet he said what would diamondo do he'd be a fireball he'd be a ball of fire he'd be explosive that's a prophet that's a prophet not Brother D these are the signs that he would be that what diamondo would do he said ask the father anything anything in my name and I'll do it John 1413 and 14 and what do you do you plug in to God if you want to worship God you got to get that old extension cord and plug it in you plug into God Amen he said that's right he said just plug into God that's all you have to do if you need something in your life just get out your plug and plug it into that I I don't the vce of God like the voltage must be out of the world it's got to be like whatever those big volts are and bigger than that he said the current comes flowing right down the line he said what happens the word starts growing and he shall be like a tree planted in the river of waters and his weaves leaves will not wither and whatsoever he doeth will prosper and Psalms 1 13 and the ungodly is not so well that's in the Bible because I had to look up to study because brother brand would be quoting things i' saying like is he just saying this is he thus sayith the Lord or is this Bible so the Bible is telling us that we can plug to God and anything anything is yours but the wicked it's not so the ungodly it's not so he said watch this he said the ungodly is not so he said now it didn't say The Sinner now he said it said the ungodly see that's the one who claims to be but has trouble worshiping claims to be but has trouble plug it in claims to be well you know bless God I'm kind of a quiet person I'll tell you how it works the very first time that Len laid eyes on me she told her girlfriend that I would never even cons I would never even it never even com through my mind cuz Dale don't speak cuz my older brother did all my talking I just nodded Arnold did everything you know they want to go there yep want to eat yep you want this yep she said how could you even cuz he don't talk that was my natural personality God's got a sense of humor see you thought you had a ni personality you weren't going to worship God that's what mine was I didn't speak I didn't have to speak yeah but but it's not our personality it's the Holy Ghost personality and you were made to Worship You Were Made To Worship that's right amen he said now it it never said The Sinner he said it said the ungodly see that's the one who claims to be and is ungodly with it you see that's right the ungodly is not so so the ungodly in a worship service won't worship but they claim this is in the wisdom versus Faith 62401 ungodly is not so they can't stand they can't stand the Judgment in righteousness they can't stand that we would worship God and be drunk spiritually speaking like when they come out of the upper room they said you know it's only the beginning of the day and they got like the new wine they can't stand the Judgment of the revealed word for the day and so if it's their favorite topic they're rejoicing but if it's not their favorite topic they don't want nothing to do with it that's why 90 well a big percentage so the ones that don't worship a man they stay home in their coach because they get to play their favorite tape but you can't push play on me and I can't even push play on God cuz I just open this and like stuff comes out that it's just the way the get God is CU if you're surrendered to him you see he said they can't stand judgment with righteousness that's the that's not the sinner that's the on Godly that profess he said no sir they certainly can't so the time has come for the seed to be swn through those who are predestinated predestinated they're the only way them are the ones that are going to be a ball of fire a fireball explosive to God to God Amen let's just close with some some fast scriptures here John John 14:13-14 whatsoever you ask in my name you shall have it that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and whatever you ask in my name I will do you know this is actually New Testament Bible do we realize I wonder are we Believers are we Godly or ungodly here's here's this maybe I'll I I've got too much but maybe I'll uh Psalm 63 3 to5 brother B mentions this 42 times talks about eternal life and I mentioned that uh because thy loving kindness is better in life he was talking about my lips shall praise thee because I have eternal life I have eternal life maybe if you're having trouble with the praise maybe you that's right that that's just Bible thus will I bless thy name why I live why I live not when I get to the Millennium it won't be any different in the Millennium if you're noisy here you'll be noisy in the Millennium if you're quiet here you won't even be in the Millennium amen why I live and while I lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied in the marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise the with the joys of my lips thy loving and and then he and there's 42 quotes so we could be here forever he talks about that the loving kindness is better than life is eternal life the resting Hallelujah Psalms 100 1-5 is a Joyful Noise unto the Lord serve the Lord his godness and let's just jump down Luke 12:43 44 46 and 48 said blessed be the servant of the Lord that cometh shall find doing he was talking about you know God would put us will God find us worshiping will God still be God when he comes because he's receiving worship I'll tell you what this morning he will be because if nature itself has to do it that's what God will do if he can't control your body he'll control the coyotes and the birds in my front tree and the stones in this parking lot amen oh a truth I say unto you that he will make make him ruler over all that he has oh my goodness the Lord is a servant will come in the day and lookth for him not and for the hour that he's not aware and he will cut him aunder say Well you know I think you know we've heard about the Rapture a long time and you know you know it it's it's going to come but you know human nature it never said never happened to me you know when you're getting in a car accident you're on black ice and the car Ro first thing that come to mind if you're ready to go make your maker is this not happens to me cuz it always happens to somebody else I see it always happen to somebody else but it's not it's not me this ain't my car it's not me you know I it was exactly like that when we had the accident in Uganda I'm sitting there and we're sliding down the road like this it's see I'm not here I'm not here this is not happening I'm not going to be buried in you no no this is not this van is not being destroyed it's being destroyed but it's not being destroyed because because that don't happen to me like I didn't come here I'm not going to be in an accident and that's how the Devil by the subd of Satan he just waxes you cold and formal oh it's just the same old home crowd you know just the same old boring song leader and the same old message that we've heard for years and years and I've already know that you can't teach me nothing I heard that since I was I know I can't teach you nothing I don't even want to try to teach you anything if God can't teach you anything we're Beyond hope amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah watch this Matthew 24:28 and 22 and we were talking about this on the way here Matthew 24:22 and 28 except these days were shortened yeah there shall be no flesh that's right saved but because of you it's directly that's personal because you are still here God will shorten our days because you are here and you're a part of God he's going to bring you to the bu land I'm just about ready to lose my mind he's going to bring you because he knows that you're his he's like I won't leave them there too long oh bless God I believe in his judgment I'm going to take you to that Beau land and hallelujah it's going to be the noisiest Rapture you ever did hear you want to talk about noise Hallelujah and wheresoever the carcasses there will the Eagles be gathered that's right amen Isaiah 64:4 and I I am I'm trying to wind this down but it's just so good Isaiah 64:4 for since the beginning of the world man have not heard nor have they perceived by their ear neither have they seen with their very own eyes God besides the what he hath prepared I don't think I'll bother worshiping him today I don't think he really is all that special you can't even your three PB brain can't even imagine you can't dream about it you can't comprehend or even make it up what God has in pray prepared for the elect and I going tell you something if you think you're brilliant if you can compare and think about it I have a different God why because my God Is Bigger Than The genius's three-b Brain that's right he's ELO him amen prepared for him yeah that love and weth for him wow wow my last scripture do Deuteronomy 30 my last scripture thank you for staying with me I I there was only one scripture on here I didn't read and I think it's going to get bumped to next Sunday Deuteronomy 311 to 16 and then 19 and for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it a far off what I'm telling you is not hidden from you you know to much is given much will be required I touched on that Wednesday night and I lost my little clip there you know you know watch this you know the Bible the guy that burned at the state for uh for translating the Bible from Hebrew and All Greek and whatever that was you know what he translated to English you know what the message came in English you know where the Prophet traveled the most in his home to much is given much much much much is required do you know when you want to listen to a tape and I know you all know this but like a tape that brother Brown preached 4 hours and you translate it to French it's now eight hours long so if you were only French you got to spend eight hours where you only got to spend four you think you're going to get oh scotf free to much is given much will be required is the one place when we preached for brother James in Uganda brother Jose preached he went through two translators now I tell you what that's close to mass confusion because one translator do it and the other one oh praise God it was him and not me too much is given much will be required it's not hidden from us and it it this truth is not in verse 12 it is not in heaven that thou should say Whom Shall go up to heaven for us to heaven and bring it down to us that we may hear it and do it God's already taken care of that part verse 13 neither is it beyond the sea that thou shalt say Whom Shall go over to the Sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it God's already taking care of that but the word is very nigh unto thee even in thy mouth MTH and in thy heart that thou mayest do it the word and worship see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil oh you get to choose if you want to worship God and Jesus himself God said if you feel like you didn't really do a lot for you you won't really feel like you need to worship a lot too much is forgiven much is required Hallelujah your righteousness remember as filthy rags Hallelujah where was I 15 see I have set before thee this okay 16 and in that the Commandment thee this day love the Lord thy God Walk in his ways keep keep his Commandments his statutes and his judgment that thou may live and multiply that means have a successful life even in Satan's Eden because we're Believers you know what you are the only people with a sound mind you know what if God leaves us here I want didn't tell you something you haven't thought about if God leaves us here I've had thoughts and I've actually mentioned it brother Carson this insane amount this the the mental illness in society is so great we're going to have to put Brothers at the door J you you I know you think it's far away away I the brother that goes to church with my oldest brother Paul in the Holiness Church they have a bookkeeping business in sarna hello SAR and you know when we go to the aop paath or whatever that what's that woman aop paath you know you go in theall and you go to the dentist here and the bookkeeper here and then you go on the ostop paath there and that and the people come in and the whole hallway was filled with homeless people and they desecrated on the center hallway and there was drug needles and everything everywhere and so what do they do they're paying like 2,000 a month rent what would I do I call the police you know what the police said said it's not our jurisdiction deal with them well the best you know how you just take care of it so when you come to church and you see homeless people living under the front porch don't call the police cuz he'll tell you it's not our problem you just deal with the squatter the best you know how I don't want to stay here I do not want to stay here brother brother Dale said I'm getting a lot more homesick amen sorry where was I to love the Lord walk in his ways and his Commandments and uh that thou may live and multiply and the Lord God shall bless thee and the land whe whether soever thou goest shall possess it and let's go to verse 19 I'm closing on this verse I promise they say I called Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set
