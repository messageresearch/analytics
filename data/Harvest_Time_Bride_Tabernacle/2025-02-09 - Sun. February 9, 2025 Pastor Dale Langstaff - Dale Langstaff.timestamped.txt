[27:33] there and almost majority of them
[27:36] two-thirds of them at least were
[27:38] pastors huge amount and uh you know even
[27:44] even this message this morning i' say
[27:45] you know you know when a minister
[27:47] messages it's not for it's it's not
[27:50] necessarily for every individual it's it
[27:53] might not even be for one single person
[27:55] here the message this morning not not me
[27:58] for one person present but it might be
[28:01] for the spirit of the age and the
[28:03] environment and the world we're living
[28:04] in it might be for the people that
[28:06] you're rubbing shoulders with yeah yeah
[28:10] okay amen but I would I would say this
[28:13] and I say this with uh uh you know maybe
[28:16] I'm out of order to say this but I would
[28:18] tell you this and and all the people are
[28:20] represented the ministers are more
[28:22] united than the
[28:24] people they they literally are it was it
[28:27] was
[28:28] unbelievable we were like the first man
[28:30] to leave at 7:30 and we were there at
[28:32] 6:00 or 10:30 I mean and it was good we
[28:35] drove back cuz they had freeze and rain
[28:36] the next morning and you know they they
[28:39] they talked about things and I mean
[28:41] generally about don't judge one another
[28:44] God uses pennies some people grow slower
[28:47] than others all those things some of
[28:49] those things the people we thought that
[28:51] had it they quit the people we didn't
[28:53] think that have it they'll be
[28:55] there yep all those things that
[28:59] amen ministers you'd be you would be
[29:02] stunned to know the unification of the
[29:06] ministers but it was it was that awesome
[29:09] of a meeting and amen and so we just
[29:13] praise God for friends so we did have
[29:15] one quick announcement Lan was the only
[29:17] Minister woman there and they were very
[29:20] concerned that you know we were letting
[29:22] wives in the
[29:23] Pulpit that's a joke brother Chad said
[29:26] we're not telling nobody we C women
[29:30] preachers amen that's just a inside joke
[29:33] but it was amazing and and many many
[29:37] friends actually de George Smith was
[29:39] there he wants to come to our church
[29:41] he's coming this year this summer um
[29:45] we've actually built a real friendship
[29:47] he is hilarious is actually the truth
[29:51] he's if you see him with his his hinder
[29:54] side he is just a clown I mean in a good
[29:57] way he's a wonderful brother and
[30:01] uh uh I said do you want to come he said
[30:03] I course I want to come there amen and
[30:06] just uh uh just a multiple good things
[30:10] we also met a brother that we hadn't
[30:12] seen for years and years and when I say
[30:14] years probably 20 years Jim
[30:17] Swanson is uh you I remember him I
[30:21] remember him preaching a message in
[30:23] chatam I never forgot it was the last
[30:24] message he preached there he said God
[30:27] has given me the the spirit of wire
[30:29] cutters to cut the barbwire fences and
[30:32] set his people
[30:33] free I told him that I said I
[30:37] remember I remember it like
[30:40] unbelievable because I was in that
[30:44] situation and God preached to
[30:47] me he didn't remember the message
[30:49] himself oh I said me and my wife
[30:53] do amen God ain't here to put you in
[30:56] bondage no no no period of any kind of
[31:00] bondage
[31:01] amen amen so it was wonderful let's
[31:04] stand and we'll read his
[31:05] word just uh you pray for me I pray for
[31:10] you God will speak through US amen
[31:13] Matthew
[31:17] 11:6 and then we're going to read Romans
[31:22] 8:28 amen are this is just a complete
[31:26] opposite of what we preached last SU
[31:27] Sunday and uh um last Sunday preaching
[31:32] on reverence this exact opposite Matthew
[31:36] 116 and blessed is he
[31:38] whosoever is not
[31:41] offended in me Romans
[31:44] 8:28 and we know that all things work
[31:46] together for good to them that love God
[31:50] and to them who are called according to
[31:53] his purpose Lord God I pray that you'll
[31:55] just just uh unite us this morning unite
[31:58] us in your word and Lord help us as we
[32:01] show the scriptures and and your word
[32:03] Lord God that may you anoint it and be
[32:06] with the speaker and the hearer Lord God
[32:07] that will understand your plan in your
[32:11] beautiful name we pray amen you may have
[32:13] your
[32:14] seats I'd like to to uh Minister on this
[32:18] and like I said already this this is not
[32:20] that I don't feel that here at all so
[32:23] this is not uh an inside uh you know
[32:26] meal or whatever if it any say could be
[32:29] for me uh more than anybody but I've
[32:32] been working on this for weeks and God
[32:34] just unfold even this morning God give
[32:37] me something in the shower and I and I
[32:38] put it on my phone and put it on my iPad
[32:40] when I came here but I want to show you
[32:42] this scripture Matthew
[32:44] 116 that John here gave Jesus the
[32:47] greatest insult the
[32:50] greatest disgusting
[32:53] insult that could humanly be given
[32:58] now John
[33:00] was and you know I I would say this that
[33:03] you know uh let's just look at the
[33:04] meaning you know the meaning of offended
[33:07] is to uh re be resentful upset wounded
[33:12] displeased put out angry
[33:14] disgruntled insulted or
[33:17] indignant now that's that's the exact
[33:20] opposite of
[33:22] reverence excuse me and here we see that
[33:25] John was in prison and he sent his disci
[33:28] in this scripture he sent his disciples
[33:30] to see you know are Jesus are you are
[33:33] you the one are you the anointed Messiah
[33:36] are you the Christ are you the one that
[33:38] was promised to come for us or have we
[33:41] missed it
[33:43] all and should we look for another and I
[33:47] want to I want to say this I know and
[33:49] you know this is uh subject to your
[33:51] interpretation of the word you know when
[33:54] we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:57] we become it's Christ in
[34:00] us now I know there's some scriptures
[34:02] talks about that you know you're a babe
[34:04] and you grow but Christ was never a
[34:11] babe amen Christ was never a baby so if
[34:15] you've there and there can be no two men
[34:17] living in a body so if you're dead and
[34:20] now Christ lives in you then you are the
[34:23] example Christ you are Christ so it's
[34:25] not us and you know we we even pre
[34:27] preach this a different way about the
[34:29] Father the father's never offended with
[34:30] his family and and believe me this is
[34:33] God it's a completely different thing
[34:35] but God God's dealing with something in
[34:37] the environment of where we live in the
[34:40] world in the environment not just this
[34:41] church but and and even the ministry and
[34:44] all the churches represented and it's a
[34:47] spirit on the age and and so but we are
[34:50] not we are not got the spirit of this
[34:52] age but we're we're rubbing shoulders
[34:54] with the spirit of this age and so we
[34:57] got to make sure that we keep the spirit
[34:58] of the age out and we have the spirit of
[35:00] Christ inside of us and so here God and
[35:04] the prophet gives some amazing quotes
[35:05] later on but here John comes and he he
[35:09] bluntly publicly insults Jesus to the to
[35:14] the highest
[35:16] degree you couldn't have been assaulted
[35:18] anymore because number one John was the
[35:20] closest person to Jesus
[35:22] alive he didn't just introduce Jesus he
[35:25] he was there to pronounce him and he he
[35:27] he was the messenger before God and I
[35:29] step aside I I must decrease so you must
[35:32] increase and he and he walked right with
[35:34] Jesus and he still couldn't figure them
[35:37] out but what I want to show you in this
[35:39] scripture is when John
[35:43] left Jesus gave John the highest regards
[35:48] and the greatest blessing of any
[35:50] breathing man on the
[35:54] earth he never said well never did think
[35:58] much of John
[35:59] anyway I never did think John had the
[36:01] Holy
[36:02] Ghost I never did agree with John's
[36:05] Doctrine he was always kind of leaning
[36:06] the one
[36:07] way no Jesus never that he said what did
[36:10] you go out to see he said I want to tell
[36:13] you something there's a man that has
[36:16] never been greater born of a woman than
[36:19] the man that just insulted me to my face
[36:27] can we do
[36:30] that can we say that about our enemies
[36:33] that say I don't think you got it I
[36:36] don't think you're called I don't think
[36:37] you're part of the family I think you're
[36:39] off I think you're missing it I don't
[36:42] think you're on the word can we just can
[36:44] we say
[36:46] wow brother Brown gave some quotes about
[36:48] that people that would come and insult
[36:51] we should get to a point that we would
[36:53] come that the people that come and say
[36:55] you know I I don't agree with that
[36:57] brother Dale he's just a ridiculous he
[37:00] he's not nothing he's you know he's just
[37:03] a like some of the insults that I got
[37:05] letters that get sent to me you know
[37:07] he's not called he just repeats what
[37:08] other people repeat and and you know he
[37:11] he had a high ego and he just left the
[37:13] start as he was a baby and all those
[37:15] those and you just say oh God bless you
[37:19] I pray for you I think you're amazing
[37:22] child of
[37:26] God he said said you would get to the
[37:28] point that you could pray for your
[37:29] enemies now see if we take the scripture
[37:31] and I want to keep this right in the
[37:33] scriptures now if we take that all
[37:35] things work together for good How could
[37:36] a holy ghost filled
[37:38] believer ever be
[37:42] offended well I don't like how you do
[37:45] that I think that's
[37:47] wrong but it was God's
[37:50] plan God put you in that
[37:53] position well God I I don't like it that
[37:56] that you know
[37:58] I well I don't I I
[38:00] don't but and you can't put that that
[38:03] all things are worked together for good
[38:04] to them that love God according to his
[38:06] purpose according to his not brother
[38:08] Dale's purpose or not Wyoming's purpose
[38:11] or not even you know the message purpose
[38:13] that but to God's purpose and so we're
[38:16] filled in a world of
[38:18] offenses I mean anybody that's breathing
[38:20] knows
[38:22] that he said this what the prophet said
[38:25] he said how can you tell
[38:28] he said 'well just give them the word
[38:29] test he said you you can know it he
[38:32] said' just speak the word and see what
[38:33] they say about it but I just give you
[38:35] the word
[38:37] test if you can be
[38:40] offended is Christ Living in you cuz
[38:43] Christ could not be
[38:47] offended let me say it like this like I
[38:50] can only preach from my standpoint like
[38:52] whether you're serving God or not don't
[38:54] offend me because I work out my own
[38:56] salvation with fear and trembling
[38:57] whether you see my Doctrine or not don't
[38:59] offend me cuz that's between you and God
[39:01] not between you and the pastor and
[39:03] whether you come to this church or not
[39:04] it don't offend me either cuz it's not
[39:06] my people it's God's flock and God calls
[39:08] whoever he wants to call in places
[39:10] whoever it calls so see we get really
[39:12] when we really get out of the way and
[39:13] we're dead you can poke somebody in the
[39:15] cket and say you're disgusting you got a
[39:17] boy orderer and then I'll say
[39:20] Well they're
[39:24] dead are we dead well we we can compare
[39:28] if we're dad what let's finish this
[39:29] quote we can compare this if we're dad I
[39:31] mean if the World's dad or if we're
[39:33] individually Dad I'm not saying by by
[39:36] how we handle the word see see if they
[39:38] don't believe it that that just if they
[39:41] don't believe the word then it just
[39:43] shows that they don't have no seed germ
[39:45] in
[39:48] them and they're
[39:50] deceived amen here's another one he said
[39:53] the one thing you can know if you're a
[39:55] Christian is when you're fully agree
[39:58] with the word of God you know I'm going
[40:00] to tell you something most message
[40:03] Believers hang on don't agree with the
[40:06] word of
[40:08] God yes Mo I mean the
[40:11] Bible under
[40:14] proper definition they don't believe
[40:18] it no they do not believe
[40:20] it I'm going to show you some examples
[40:23] you can't say we might get this I'm
[40:26] going way ahead of my myself but you
[40:28] can't say well brother Brown said if you
[40:30] go to a church and and you think he
[40:31] preached off just spit out the pit don't
[40:33] stay
[40:34] home we have 50% of this message sitting
[40:41] home
[40:44] somebody well well you oh bless God
[40:46] brother Brown you know what you know
[40:48] what they were sharing at the ministry
[40:49] meeting it was really good you see you
[40:50] know what's the evidence of the holy
[40:52] spirit it's not believe the word for
[40:53] your day oh but that's what brother
[40:55] Brown said well I know it is you see he
[40:57] said well if you believe the word for
[40:59] the day the one of the ministers said he
[41:00] said I know a whole bunch of gay people
[41:02] that believe in brother Brown is prophet
[41:04] and the message hour is true but they're
[41:06] gay will they be in
[41:09] heaven wow but the Bible says when the
[41:12] spirit of Truth has come he will lead
[41:15] and guide you into all
[41:19] truth we know there's people staying
[41:21] home and I'm I'm I'm sorry I'm messed up
[41:24] here but God ain't and we know there's
[41:26] people staying home
[41:27] because their Pastor would say the
[41:29] brother Brown made
[41:31] mistakes so they are qualified to break
[41:34] the next scripture that says Don't
[41:36] forsake the assembling of yourself
[41:38] together and go to a pastor that makes
[41:41] mistakes that qualifies you like one
[41:43] qualification qualifies you to break
[41:45] another scripture I want to give you an
[41:47] insight to this brother Brown said 224
[41:50] times
[41:51] mistakes and almost 100% of them was him
[41:56] me we I and
[41:59] everyone 224 times so if your pastor
[42:02] says brother makes mistakes brother B
[42:05] said he makes mistakes that's right
[42:08] brother B said there ain't never a man
[42:10] born that's
[42:11] infallible that's
[42:13] right God is
[42:16] infallible prophets are not infallible
[42:18] brother Brown said brother Brown said in
[42:20] questions answers said it three times
[42:22] and I'm way way way out to Lun chair in
[42:24] my head but he said three times he said
[42:26] my answers are not in
[42:31] ible
[42:37] uhoh if you can be offended by that
[42:39] you're not born
[42:42] again that's right if you're going to be
[42:44] offended by that you're not born
[42:46] again here here in Hebrews 511 it says
[42:50] whom have many things to say unto you
[42:53] and it's hard to UT seeing that you are
[42:55] dull of hearing and when the time has
[42:57] come that you ought to be teachers you
[42:59] have need to be teached again because
[43:01] the first principles of the Oracles of
[43:03] God being such as need
[43:07] milk and not strong meink and everyone
[43:09] that needeth milk is unskillful in the
[43:11] word of God righteous for he is
[43:14] a baby and strong meat belongeth to them
[43:18] that are not offended full age even
[43:22] those by reason who use the senses
[43:26] exercise tries to discern both
[43:30] good and
[43:32] evil
[43:37] wow so here in
[43:47] Matthew we see that John came and he
[43:50] sent his
[43:52] disciples to see are you it is this
[43:55] message this message of of Christ and
[43:58] salvation and Grace you know I want I sh
[44:01] you that message was rejected by the
[44:02] church they loved the
[44:05] law so I mean even Peter struggled that
[44:09] with Paul because he thought you should
[44:10] be circumcised literally in the
[44:13] flesh Paul brought Grace and there's
[44:16] many different definitions where the The
[44:18] Message Church will grab on to
[44:22] law when Paul's was I I want to show oh
[44:26] man alive this is unbelievable but let
[44:27] me show you something example do you
[44:29] know the very definition of
[44:31] qualification of a
[44:33] pastor that if you took the Old
[44:35] Testament Paul couldn't
[44:37] preach cuz he had a bad
[44:41] eye so when Paul gave the qualifications
[44:43] for New Testament ministers he gave it
[44:46] completely different than the Old
[44:47] Testament because he would have
[44:48] disqualified
[44:50] himself brother Chad Lamb couldn't
[44:52] Minister because he's
[44:55] bald and that's in the ex act same verse
[44:57] of the one that you might
[45:01] believe bless God I'm not preaching on
[45:03] that but God
[45:07] is Paul had a bride eye you can't be a
[45:11] minister in the Old Testament with the
[45:12] bad
[45:13] eye but you think you got God figured
[45:15] out and you can take and pick this and
[45:17] I'll pick this the brother says
[45:19] something wrong I'll stay home and I'll
[45:20] watch brother Brown said God will never
[45:22] use a mechanical device for his holy
[45:24] spirit to go flu so we should all go
[45:26] home listen to all the ministers on
[45:27] YouTube and really be blessed to God no
[45:29] no no that's
[45:31] unscriptural God could have chose the
[45:33] whole world he could have ch donkey
[45:34] women men you know the Sun the moon all
[45:37] these things to preach but he chose the
[45:39] man so all you that are living on the
[45:41] diet of the YouTube you're
[45:45] puking cuz it's not
[45:47] scriptural God chose a man now is that
[45:49] evil to watch no no no it's not even to
[45:52] you see with
[45:54] me and if you can be offended by that
[45:57] but that's God's
[45:59] word
[46:01] amenes see the Bible says that you must
[46:03] be born again and the Holy Ghost cannot
[46:05] be
[46:06] offended it's not possible a dad person
[46:09] cannot be
[46:10] offended Christ ain't offended because
[46:13] the world won't choose him he knew that
[46:14] from the
[46:16] beginning amen the problem is with the
[46:19] Believers the heaven went far
[46:22] enough now brother Brown gave that clear
[46:24] quote to every one of you know he said
[46:26] Billy Graham would go to Ministry and
[46:27] I'm just I got the quote right in front
[46:29] of
[46:29] me but I'm just saying up from things he
[46:32] said you know he had preached and the
[46:33] 10,000 would get converted come back a
[46:35] year later and there'll be 10 there he
[46:37] said you never took them into Christ
[46:40] they were on the journey oh praise God
[46:42] they were on the journey but you know
[46:44] brother Brown said things like this he
[46:46] said before you get the baptism of the
[46:47] Holy Spirit God gives you a new spirit
[46:49] and he said almost all believers stop
[46:51] when they get the new spirit because
[46:53] they become gentle and respectful and
[46:55] and say God bless you and courtesy and
[46:57] all that and that was just this a quote
[47:00] brother he said God just give you that
[47:02] spirit so you could put up with the Holy
[47:04] Spirit or get along with the Holy Spirit
[47:06] is what he said and so you sto way short
[47:09] and you can tell that when people can
[47:11] get
[47:13] offended so if you can get offended how
[47:16] I eat dinner or don't eat dinner or
[47:19] because I'm ugly and fat or skinny and
[47:23] tall
[47:29] remember Jesus was
[47:31] insulted he just smiled and
[47:36] said
[47:43] wow
[47:47] amen you didn't go far enough when you
[47:50] got the new heart the new spirit God
[47:52] puts the holy spirit in there right
[47:54] beside your new spirit and the cross
[47:56] becomes lined up with feathers amen and
[48:00] you can say anything you want to about
[48:02] me if I have the Holy
[48:07] Spirit I'm glad you're not my judge
[48:09] whether I'm going through or qualified
[48:11] or child of God or called to the
[48:14] ministry or pra God Amen blessed are
[48:18] those that are persecuted for
[48:19] righteousness sake for theirs is the
[48:21] Kingdom of Heaven anden we've all had a
[48:23] certain amount of C blessed are ye when
[48:25] men shall revile you and persecute you
[48:27] and shall say all manner of evil against
[48:28] you falsely for my name's sake rejoice
[48:31] and be exceedingly glad for great is
[48:33] your reward in heaven for so persecuted
[48:36] the prophets which were before you it's
[48:39] Matthew 5:10 and 12 so God came down and
[48:42] put his own Spirit into us and then so
[48:46] see I said it was not necessarily in
[48:48] this church but in your Christian
[48:50] Journey if you can see somebody get
[48:53] offended you know watch watch let me
[48:55] back the card up you know and this is
[48:58] God coming to me you know see brother
[49:00] Brown and and it's the truth but you
[49:02] know see how you have to bring
[49:04] everything and caught new and brother
[49:06] Bown said don't give me one scripture
[49:08] give me the flow of the scripture from
[49:09] Genesis to Revelation and blend them
[49:12] together that the spirit of the the when
[49:14] the spirit of Truth is come he'll let
[49:16] him lead and guide you in all truth
[49:17] that's not leaving the scripture so you
[49:19] know when you say and I believe it I I
[49:21] actually do believe it but you know the
[49:23] the the the the the the the proof of the
[49:26] Holy Ghost is believe in the word for
[49:27] your day but you know I've had Brothers
[49:29] Tell Me That by this message and by what

[50:01] fallible anointed word of
[50:05] God he said multiple times my words can
[50:07] fail but let's read the let's open up

[50:50] hallelujah amen so see see people are
[50:53] twisting this
[50:55] message brother is my pastor that's a
[50:59] bunch
[51:03] of Amen you know blaspheme you know
[51:08] there's a place in the world that says
[51:10] that if God himself came
[51:13] today that he would push play and
[51:19] Obey
[51:23] really it's the headquarters
[51:28] you know Catholic church has a
[51:31] headquarters you know amen so you know
[51:34] so you know what I mean that don't take
[51:36] away nothing it don't discourage
[51:38] me but when the spirit of Truth has come
[51:41] he'll lead and guide me in all truth
[51:43] amen don't live by your it by yourself
[51:46] it's Christ that liveth in you when you
[51:48] receive the Holy Ghost amen so let's
[51:50] just go we're growing day when we get
[51:52] bigger I'm just I'm trying to get to my
[51:54] main text here he said when somebody
[51:57] talks about you he said it won't hurt
[51:58] them when they laugh at you and insult
[52:00] you he said don't pay no attention to
[52:03] you he said they got one thing he said
[52:05] they're just he said you're so full of
[52:07] the glory of the Holy Ghost he said when
[52:09] they come up and say you're nothing but
[52:11] a great big hipocrite brother Dale will
[52:15] you say well praise the Lord God bless
[52:17] you
[52:21] too all right remember read the quote
[52:23] this is Divine Healing
[52:28] when you know certain certain things are
[52:30] going on at the church and you ought to
[52:32] not be going he said you just pray about
[52:36] it amen once here let's just go fast and
[52:40] get into our main scripture here John 3
[52:43] three Jesus and said ver except the man
[52:46] be born again he cannot see the Kingdom
[52:48] of Heaven that means you have to die and
[52:51] when you're dad you can't be offended so
[52:53] let's just look at some other scriptures
[52:54] here before we go into our main text
[52:56] John uh or Hebrews uh
[52:59] 10:9 for I came for I came down from
[53:03] heaven not to do my
[53:05] will but the will of him that sent me
[53:08] now any one of us here that's got the
[53:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost you know
[53:11] brother Brown said but being a Christian
[53:13] is living for others you're not here to
[53:15] make a big bank account no it's fine if
[53:17] that comes along you maybe you'll share
[53:19] it with me or something or we'll go on a
[53:21] trip together but you're here to live
[53:23] for others brother bam you know what
[53:25] brother bam said he said I couldn't go
[53:27] to Mexico after i' ate breakfast in
[53:29] Texas and I crossed the border and there
[53:31] was a baby there with a big stomach that
[53:32] was starving to death he said I could
[53:34] never be a rich
[53:36] man I could never have $100,000 in the
[53:39] bank and Drive by that boy with a big
[53:41] belly and know that he would die of
[53:44] hunger said I couldn't do
[53:48] it
[53:49] amen not to do my own will but to do the
[53:52] will of him that sent me and John 4:38
[53:55] what oh look at the Tren here John 4:38
[53:58] and when he said un me lo I come to do
[53:59] thy will oh
[54:01] God that's that's this scripture is for
[54:04] every one of us I come to do thy will oh
[54:06] God I didn't come to do brother Dale's
[54:08] will I wouldn't be preaching here this
[54:09] morning but I come to do God's will oh
[54:12] Lord amen what's the next scripture John
[54:14] 4th oh I might have been given those
[54:16] scriptures sorry they're on top one to I
[54:18] might have been giving them the opposite
[54:20] way John 4:34 Jesus said unto them my my
[54:24] meat is to do the will of him that said
[54:27] me that's for
[54:29] you that's that's for you and
[54:32] me my my real meal is to do God's will
[54:36] because I'm not alive no
[54:39] more
[54:41] amen hallelujah and we're actually just
[54:44] getting into but here's a quote here
[54:46] before we bre dive into like I got
[54:48] multiple examples in the Bible how
[54:51] before the holy most of these are before
[54:53] the Holy Ghost was given the people
[54:56] could not be and believe me I mean it
[54:59] was right to the point of death they
[55:00] could not be
[55:04] offended and they never had what you
[55:08] have so we got great hope watch here
[55:11] what brother bam said he said you know
[55:13] now you know Christianity has changed so
[55:16] much and these last days I want to just
[55:19] put in a disclaimer here I'm just
[55:22] stepping out of what the prophet said
[55:24] it's a lot more the last days now than
[55:26] than it was when he said
[55:30] this now you know Christianity has
[55:32] changed so much in these last days now
[55:34] you know you got to Baby the
[55:37] people you got to promise them a whole
[55:40] lot you got to give them a whole lot
[55:43] make them believe well if you come to
[55:44] church I'll make you be like the Usher
[55:47] the Deacon the piano player you know
[55:50] I'll let even this he said that's not
[55:53] Christianity CH Christianity is not
[55:55] being baby
[55:57] Christianity is rugged he said right
[55:59] Christianity is not being hot hot bad
[56:03] plant he said a hot bad plant a hybrid
[56:06] plant mostly he said you have to spray
[56:08] them with all kinds of little jugs to
[56:10] keep the mosquitoes off them you know I
[56:12] was talking thinking about this when we
[56:14] had Camp me I had one brother say after
[56:16] he slept in his tent two nights he said
[56:17] you know I had a sore back for two or
[56:19] three days after
[56:22] so it was a tent it was 2 days of your
[56:27] life half the world sleeps on the ground
[56:30] all the
[56:34] time we are so separated from reality
[56:37] you wouldn't believe
[56:39] it try sleeping on
[56:43] Sand I mean your forefather slept in a
[56:46] straw
[56:47] tick we put straw ticks Under the Tent
[56:50] oh
[56:54] oh I don't think I I'll come next year I
[56:57] can't sleep in a
[57:00] tent oh by the way I won't give to
[57:02] missions either cuz they sleep in a tent
[57:04] every day CU they're
[57:07] homeless rugged Christianity is not a
[57:10] hot Bud plant you spray them he said
[57:12] keep the bugs off he said that's because
[57:14] of
[57:16] weakness that's the way you have to do
[57:18] with a lot of Christians you have to
[57:20] spray them with a lot of
[57:23] promises and you don't need to do that
[57:25] with the real genuine healthy plant it
[57:28] don't need nothing the bugs stay off it
[57:30] that's calling Jesus on the scene a 64
[57:32] quote let's get into the meat and bones
[57:35] of our message here here we have an
[57:37] example of
[57:39] nahem in 2 Kings 5 1:4 and I'm not going
[57:42] to read the scriptures I'm going to tell
[57:44] you the story he was a great Soldier and
[57:47] they had went against Israel and
[57:50] captured
[57:52] prisoners so you know there's other
[57:53] countries thinking they're going to take
[57:55] over CA Canada they're going to come in
[57:56] with their military and they're going to
[57:57] capture us and we're going to go back
[58:00] and be forced labor under their thing
[58:03] I'm I'm just trying to make this Bible
[58:05] thing this is what
[58:07] happened now I'll guarantee you it
[58:10] wasn't a pretty
[58:13] sight the syrians had gone down by
[58:16] companies and had brought away
[58:18] captivities of the land of Egypt a
[58:21] little maid and she waited on non's wife
[58:25] she was a prize of war and a
[58:31] slave let me rephrase that she was a
[58:34] prize of War her parents were probably
[58:37] killed for sure her dad and she was a
[58:41] slave and she was The Spoils of
[58:47] War now I'll guarantee you I'm that
[58:49] little Ma I would have had a chip on my
[58:52] shoulder and it wouldn't have been no
[58:53] little chip it would have been the size
[58:55] of a
[58:56] Tomahawk chess
[59:01] missile and Ne man her Lord got leprosy
[59:04] had leprosy and he was hiding it from
[59:06] the people cuz they would have took him
[59:08] out of the city because he had a big job
[59:10] so he was like most of our offenses and
[59:12] sins we tried to hide them from all our
[59:15] public people and put a smile on WE tape
[59:16] a smile on we hide our leprosy under the
[59:18] coat and they were doing things to hide
[59:20] his leprosy or his own government would
[59:22] have put him away and he would have lost
[59:24] his pension plan and she said I would to
[59:27] God that you known that there's a real
[59:29] God in Israel a real man of
[59:32] God wait a minute wait a minute wait she
[59:35] was
[59:37] offended you know offended people never
[59:39] help
[59:42] you she was a prize of War she was a
[59:47] slave she was in a another country by
[59:53] force and she was going to help her her
[59:56] most chosen
[59:58] enemy Hey listen I can help you I can't
[1:00:02] help you but my God can help you and he
[1:00:04] sent a prophet in my home country and if
[1:00:06] you go see
[1:00:08] him he'll take care of your problem just
[1:00:10] like
[1:00:16] that a little
[1:00:19] Maid would the God my Lord were with
[1:00:27] and she said unto her mistress I would
[1:00:28] the God my Lord were with the prophet
[1:00:32] that was down in our country he could
[1:00:34] recover him of his
[1:00:36] leprosy I would have been praying with
[1:00:38] to God that he'd cut your
[1:00:40] throat I'm just telling you cuz I'm
[1:00:43] still
[1:00:44] human and there's a whole buch more of
[1:00:46] you that in the secret heart of your
[1:00:49] thing wouldn't be thinking that the most
[1:00:52] worst enemy I'm going to help you
[1:01:04] in Acts
[1:01:08] 6 here they needed Godly men to help run
[1:01:12] the people of God and Stephen was one
[1:01:16] that stood out as a godly man and he was
[1:01:20] like
[1:01:22] most well he was like many Godly man you
[1:01:26] know yeah I wish I would have put this
[1:01:28] in I just read a St and it's a big old
[1:01:30] man in this in maybe England even he
[1:01:33] said you know
[1:01:35] anybody that speaks the truth is
[1:01:38] hated remember I showed I I wish I had
[1:01:42] his name anybody if I tell you the
[1:01:46] truth that's why the churches that tell
[1:01:48] the real
[1:01:50] truth have empty
[1:01:53] seats but if I said you can just oh just
[1:01:58] love you
[1:02:00] know this place would fill right up
[1:02:03] praise
[1:02:05] God and Stephen was the man and he told
[1:02:08] them the real truth step was full of
[1:02:10] faith and power and had great signs and
[1:02:12] miracles among the people he was a man
[1:02:15] of God but the problem was that the
[1:02:18] Believers that were with him didn't want
[1:02:20] the truth that's the truth see and you
[1:02:22] can read that in verse Acts 6 I put a
[1:02:26] few scriptures down but I'm just trying
[1:02:27] to and acts 7 is where it really comes
[1:02:30] down and they stoned Stephen and called
[1:02:33] upon their
[1:02:34] God they thought they had the same God
[1:02:36] as Stephen oh my goodness I'm going to
[1:02:39] take care of that
[1:02:42] Pastor and they were praying to their
[1:02:44] God thinking they had the blessings of
[1:02:46] God just like Saul I'm doing God's work
[1:02:50] killing
[1:02:51] people and they God and saying the Lord
[1:02:54] Jesus oh here this was Steven actually
[1:02:56] sorry he called then Steven called on to
[1:02:58] his God saying Lord Jesus sorry I
[1:03:01] receive my spirit and he kneeled down
[1:03:03] but the people that were stoning him
[1:03:05] believed they were doing God's will cuz
[1:03:07] they were they were actually pricked in
[1:03:09] their heart but they were
[1:03:12] Believers maybe we'll read that acts
[1:03:15] 7:54 and when they heard these things
[1:03:17] they were cut to the heart and they
[1:03:20] gased on him with their teeth
[1:03:30] yeah but him being full of the Holy
[1:03:33] Ghost look steadfast up into heaven and
[1:03:35] seen the glory of God Jesus stand at the
[1:03:36] right hand of God and said behold I see
[1:03:39] the heavens open and the son of man
[1:03:40] standing the right hand of God and they
[1:03:42] cow cried with a loud voice and plugged
[1:03:44] their ears and ran to him in one Accord
[1:03:47] and caused him to go out of the city and
[1:03:50] stoned him and the witnesses laid down
[1:03:52] their coats in the young man's feet
[1:03:54] whose name was our greatest Messenger to
[1:03:58] this
[1:03:59] AG the New Testament
[1:04:02] age
[1:04:05] Paul you know they mentioned that at the
[1:04:07] ministers meeting said who would have
[1:04:09] believed that Saul had the baptism of
[1:04:10] the Holy
[1:04:14] Ghost bless
[1:04:16] God I would have never thought he would
[1:04:19] have made
[1:04:21] it he wrote all the New Testament most
[1:04:24] of it and he kneeled down and cried with
[1:04:27] a loud voice saying Lord okay this is
[1:04:30] how offended stevenh was now he told
[1:04:34] them the truth not like let's back to C
[1:04:36] up if you watch this story number one
[1:04:38] Steph never asked for the
[1:04:41] job they looked for holy men that was
[1:04:44] stood out that knew the word of God and
[1:04:47] Stephen was picked and he said it was
[1:04:49] full of power and full of the Holy
[1:04:52] Ghost he never asked for the
[1:04:54] job and then they didn't like what the
[1:04:57] Holy Ghost told them in his
[1:04:59] testimony and this is how offended he
[1:05:02] was he kneeled down and he cried with a
[1:05:04] loud voice Lord Lord lay not this sin to
[1:05:08] their charge and he and when he had said
[1:05:12] this he
[1:05:21] died
[1:05:23] offended well I don't think I'm really
[1:05:26] you know you know God's trying to I'm
[1:05:28] showing you something see you know
[1:05:31] there's there's not a and this is what
[1:05:32] the minister said there's no continuity
[1:05:35] in the body of the Believers today like
[1:05:38] the Believers that say we should take
[1:05:39] every word that brother Brown says th
[1:05:41] say the Lord don't come a half an hour
[1:05:42] early for
[1:05:44] service probably 50% of them don't even
[1:05:47] come to
[1:05:54] service or brother Brown said don't
[1:05:56] shrink your post of Duty Put Your
[1:05:59] Shoulder to the wheel and really help
[1:06:00] the work of God in the local assembly
[1:06:02] the pastor don't have to do all the
[1:06:03] shovel in the
[1:06:05] snow and cutting the
[1:06:08] grass
[1:06:10] oh I don't mind doing it by the way but
[1:06:13] it I mean I'm
[1:06:16] not I'm not
[1:06:19] preaching that's what our Prophet said
[1:06:22] that's right that's a prophet you love
[1:06:25] yes sir you wonder why you don't see God
[1:06:28] it's cuz you don't mow the
[1:06:30] grass you wonder why you don't see God
[1:06:32] in the service this morning you never
[1:06:33] shoveled the snow in the
[1:06:34] sidewalk you wonder why you don't see
[1:06:36] God you never came a half an hour early
[1:06:39] you wonder why you don't see God CU you
[1:06:41] don't want to hear
[1:06:43] truth truth truth you're hated for
[1:06:49] truth Daniel Daniel was a real man of
[1:06:53] God he he he he chose in his heart that
[1:06:56] he wouldn't defy his body Temple by
[1:07:00] eating the king's meat and the
[1:07:05] wine
[1:07:07] amen and they threw him in jail because
[1:07:10] they hated Daniel he was so blessed that
[1:07:13] the king watched His blessings and they
[1:07:15] said hey if I hang around this guy it
[1:07:18] might be a benefit you know like when I
[1:07:20] go to the cattle say everybody wants to
[1:07:21] sit with Tommy temps it's cuz he feeds
[1:07:23] 5,000 cattle and he's probably worth
[1:07:25] like 100 million but I don't think it
[1:07:27] rubs off on me I mean he's my friend i s
[1:07:31] my you see what I mean but that's how it
[1:07:33] is like that's why everybody wants to go
[1:07:34] to like that church because they think
[1:07:38] the holy ghost that they got it'll rub
[1:07:40] off on them or the gift that they got
[1:07:42] brother Braham said if I try to be one
[1:07:44] of those people I'll be a
[1:07:47] clown but we're all trying to be clowns
[1:07:49] cuz we want to hang around those people
[1:07:50] thinking oh bless God we'll be we'll get
[1:07:53] what they got no I don't what they got I
[1:07:56] want what Jesus got brother bam said he
[1:07:58] said I'm afraid that we're getting you
[1:07:59] to the spirit of the
[1:08:02] pastor and I add even the prophet we got
[1:08:05] the spirit of the Prophet but what about
[1:08:07] the Holy
[1:08:08] Spirit what about God like I don't have
[1:08:10] to wear a belt buckle where cowboy hat
[1:08:12] have a have a have a gun and have a
[1:08:14] moose on my we we could hang moose here
[1:08:16] oh that wouldn't that look cool a big
[1:08:18] old antler and a fool that would really
[1:08:20] and a
[1:08:22] fish well and and that's okay and
[1:08:25] they're and I like that and they're nice
[1:08:28] and and it's not evil and all that but
[1:08:30] that was just the fleshy life of
[1:08:33] enjoying the environment of I'm
[1:08:39] happy it wasn't like thus saith you got
[1:08:43] to be that
[1:08:45] way amen and here when the king said he
[1:08:48] said then Daniel said unto the king oh
[1:08:51] King live
[1:08:52] forever they thre Daniel and J he done
[1:08:55] nothing nothing wrong by the way except
[1:08:57] pray and he never changed his testimony
[1:08:59] because they pressured him he still
[1:09:01] opened the windows and Daniel was so
[1:09:04] offended that when the king that threw
[1:09:07] him in jail came to find him he
[1:09:10] said oh King live
[1:09:13] forever my God has sent an angel to shut
[1:09:16] the lion's mouth that they may not have
[1:09:19] hurt
[1:09:21] me now I mean anybody throws me in the
[1:09:24] lon stand I'm not going to tell to live
[1:09:25] forever I'm going to hope that they have
[1:09:27] a short
[1:09:29] life maybe like
[1:09:33] uh
[1:09:35] amen wow let's look at the three Hebrew
[1:09:38] children
[1:09:42] meach and abedo mesach Shadrach Meshach
[1:09:46] and abedo sorry I I had all three
[1:09:50] here and they told the King
[1:09:52] Nebuchadnezzar they said you know we're
[1:09:53] not even careful how we'll answer you
[1:09:57] you know I want I want to throw
[1:09:58] something out here if you believe a
[1:10:00] minister is called of
[1:10:02] God it has nothing to do with the flesh
[1:10:06] like less than
[1:10:08] zero and if he's a man of God and he's
[1:10:12] careful what he says what God tells him
[1:10:15] he's he's a
[1:10:21] liar that's right
[1:10:23] amen cuz he ain't If he if I'm saying my
[1:10:26] words well they're they're they're
[1:10:28] they're not life and spirit and life
[1:10:30] they're death and
[1:10:32] destruction but if I'm saying What God
[1:10:34] Says see the three Hebrew children they
[1:10:36] were saying the words of life and they
[1:10:39] said we're not even going to be careful
[1:10:40] to say them to
[1:10:41] you cuz you only have power because my
[1:10:44] God allowed you to have the power and
[1:10:45] we're not afraid of
[1:10:48] you and they say if it be so that our
[1:10:51] God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us
[1:10:54] from this burning furnace
[1:10:56] and he will deliver us out of thine hand
[1:10:58] oh King but if not it's okay we're cool
[1:11:02] with you and we're cool with
[1:11:09] dying no they they they now that's being
[1:11:13] offended bless God I'm not doing nothing
[1:11:15] more in the
[1:11:17] church I ain't even going to
[1:11:23] sweep my
[1:11:26] 15 22 and
[1:11:30] 28 and behold a
[1:11:33] woman from Canaan came from the same
[1:11:37] coast and cried onto him saying Lord
[1:11:39] Lord have mercy this is the greatest one
[1:11:40] of all oh Lord thou son of David my
[1:11:44] daughter is gevy vexed with the devil
[1:11:48] now I just want to just go we we we're
[1:11:50] doing we're blowing this right off the
[1:11:52] charts for time but you know there's no
[1:11:55] Greater Love next to God's love than a
[1:11:57] father or Mother's
[1:12:00] Love people talk about a mother's love
[1:12:03] she carried that little baby she felt it
[1:12:05] move and everything
[1:12:08] and and just the the the feminine
[1:12:13] Spirit of a mother is to nurture and to
[1:12:18] just grow
[1:12:22] and everything to help that little baby
[1:12:25] that that mother heart was
[1:12:28] breaking because her
[1:12:30] daughter was vexed with the
[1:12:34] devil I mean she was at the lowest
[1:12:38] web of her Christian walk I mean she
[1:12:42] could just barely get in the
[1:12:47] church she was like oh my her burdens
[1:12:51] were
[1:12:59] yeah is that is that true were her
[1:13:01] burdens
[1:13:02] big her natural love for her
[1:13:06] daughter and she came to the one that
[1:13:09] she
[1:13:11] knew had the
[1:13:14] answer you with me so
[1:13:17] far hang on you're going to be
[1:13:21] surprised and Jesus answered her not a
[1:13:24] word
[1:13:27] you know that made me think of something
[1:13:30] I was fellowship and I talked to Paul
[1:13:32] Fontaine by the way next month he's
[1:13:35] coming on a Wednesday night you pick the
[1:13:38] Wednesday night if you want to see him
[1:13:40] come every
[1:13:41] Wednesday cuz I don't know which
[1:13:42] Wednesday it
[1:13:43] is he has two families that moved to
[1:13:46] Windsor and he's coming up to pray over
[1:13:47] their house and he's coming down to have
[1:13:49] fellowship with me and he said' it have
[1:13:51] to be a Wednesday and he said' it'll be
[1:13:53] one Wednesday in March
[1:13:57] but I he had text me and asked me about
[1:14:01] some Bel some people that were
[1:14:03] fellowshipping with his church that were
[1:14:05] by me and he wanted me to connect with
[1:14:10] them and
[1:14:13] somehow that text got mixed and I
[1:14:16] answered him like four months
[1:14:18] later and I'm like
[1:14:21] oh oh brother Paul
[1:14:26] I know you're not going to believe
[1:14:32] this yeah I know I know what you're
[1:14:35] already
[1:14:36] thinking that you know what he was
[1:14:39] thinking I don't like him I'm not
[1:14:41] fellowship with him I'm not connected
[1:14:42] with you that guy's a loggerhead you
[1:14:44] know he's you know come
[1:14:47] on everything you going think of and he
[1:14:50] was just trying to take care of a little
[1:14:53] sheep but I just missed
[1:14:59] it Jesus answered him not a
[1:15:02] word I said oh Paul I'm begging your
[1:15:07] forgiveness I never I there's no intent
[1:15:11] ear at

[1:16:16] devil to rest right now next time Jesus

[1:16:23] making too much noise in church that is
[1:16:25] straight from the pit of
[1:16:28] Hell that ain't possible in
[1:16:34] worship it's not possible to make too
[1:16:36] much noise in
[1:16:38] worship it's not possible to be too
[1:16:40] drunk In
[1:16:44] Worship wow thank you
[1:16:48] Lord but Jesus answered and said unto
[1:16:51] him I'm not
[1:16:53] sent till the L sheep of the House of
[1:16:56] Israel now Jesus our
[1:17:01] lord okay let me just tell you what
[1:17:03] anybody a gentile in
[1:17:05] here were you offended at what he said
[1:17:08] he was saying it to the
[1:17:13] Gentiles he said I'm not sent to the
[1:17:15] last sheep of the House of
[1:17:18] Israel and then she came and worshiped
[1:17:21] him oh I'm not going to that church CU
[1:17:23] that Pastor you know he he says the
[1:17:25] truth and I have a hard time entering
[1:17:27] into worship cuz I'm afraid what he's
[1:17:28] going to minister after and saying Lord
[1:17:31] help me Lord help me I I just want to
[1:17:34] I'm trying to put Flesh on this that
[1:17:37] mother's heart was vexed and breaken and
[1:17:41] she was balling her face off and she was
[1:17:46] a
[1:17:49] wreck because the love of her heart was
[1:17:52] laying in a bad
[1:17:55] vexed with a
[1:18:00] demon that's
[1:18:03] right a woman was desperate and she had
[1:18:06] the right attitude she she had all these
[1:18:11] things but Jesus answered and said it's
[1:18:14] not
[1:18:15] meat to take the children's
[1:18:18] bread and cast it oh that would have
[1:18:21] done her right there you'd be surprised
[1:18:24] what pastors talk about when pastors get
[1:18:30] together it's not me that I would cast
[1:18:33] it to
[1:18:35] dogs oh bless God that would have made
[1:18:37] the hair stand up on the back of my
[1:18:40] neck well Glory Hallelujah where's the
[1:18:43] next closest Message
[1:18:51] Church see she had approached the Lord
[1:18:55] Lord in the wrong way she had done
[1:18:57] everything right but at that point God
[1:19:01] wasn't sent to the Gentiles he was sent
[1:19:03] to the Jews and so she when she called
[1:19:04] him
[1:19:06] Lord you know and so watch how you take
[1:19:08] the scriptures the Bible said that he
[1:19:10] came to the world because he loved the
[1:19:12] world none would be lost and yet he's
[1:19:14] calling her a dog she was part of the
[1:19:20] world but see how you got to get the
[1:19:22] spirit of truth and the continuity of
[1:19:24] the script scripture at that time in the
[1:19:26] beginning of Jesus ministry he was sent
[1:19:29] to the
[1:19:30] Jews and his own refused them and he
[1:19:34] blinded them temporarily and grafted Us
[1:19:37] in and we don't want to get an eagle for
[1:19:39] that because if he cut off the natural
[1:19:40] Branch how much more can he break off
[1:19:42] the grafted
[1:19:44] Branch he said it's not children's meat
[1:19:48] that I give you to the dogs now I just
[1:19:50] tell you what like what would you think
[1:19:51] if I invited you over for supper I I
[1:19:54] remember remember having this question
[1:19:55] about somebody you know when we were
[1:19:58] young and we had young children then a
[1:20:00] few a very few maybe not too many we
[1:20:03] went to a couple's place and you know I
[1:20:07] from birth could not stand respector of
[1:20:11] persons I just I couldn't I couldn't
[1:20:13] from grade one
[1:20:16] kindergarten and you know I remember
[1:20:18] going there and me and L maybe Jared was
[1:20:20] born and they had all the kids sitting
[1:20:22] in a different table cuz might spill the
[1:20:25] milk and they gave them like hot dogs or
[1:20:29] macaroni now they probably loved it but
[1:20:32] we were sitting up with the candle and
[1:20:34] the lace tablecloth and we got like the
[1:20:38] shrimp and the the shrimp and the and
[1:20:41] the shrimp and the and the shrimp and
[1:20:44] the the the the the the smoke
[1:20:48] brisket and you know I come home that
[1:20:50] bothered me because the kids were like
[1:20:53] second class
[1:20:55] I hate that
[1:20:57] spirit I hate that Spirit God hates that
[1:21:01] spirit I hate respector a person it's a
[1:21:03] sin you're guilty of everything in the
[1:21:05] Bible you respector a person now in this
[1:21:10] minor case uh probably the kids were
[1:21:14] happy with their hot ducks and that but
[1:21:15] you know
[1:21:17] don't we're all born in sin shaped in
[1:21:20] iniquity come to the world speaking lie
[1:21:22] and if you pull your hand out of the
[1:21:23] pale of water it'll go love and you
[1:21:24] despite how important you
[1:21:31] are and this woman was so
[1:21:34] offended now she came and addressed God
[1:21:37] in the wrong
[1:21:39] way but then she came and worshiped God
[1:21:41] which she could do
[1:21:43] that and now this is the third strike in
[1:21:46] you're
[1:21:47] out and she said in verse 27 she said
[1:21:51] yes
[1:21:52] Lord truth Lord
[1:21:55] and yet even the
[1:21:57] dogs eat hot
[1:22:00] dogs even the dogs come to the table
[1:22:03] with the lace curtain and eat what the
[1:22:06] Masters put on
[1:22:08] there and
[1:22:10] Jesus was
[1:22:14] stunned he was
[1:22:16] stunned he was stunned it was like
[1:22:18] somebody hit him on the forehead with a
[1:22:21] bat he was stunned
[1:22:27] yeah and Jesus answer said unto her he
[1:22:29] said oh
[1:22:31] woman
[1:22:33] wow great is your
[1:22:36] faith be it unto thee according to thy
[1:22:39] will thy daughter will be made whole
[1:22:41] this very
[1:22:48] hour what would she a God if she would
[1:22:50] have been offended
[1:22:58] I mean I'm only human she had lots of
[1:23:01] opportunity to get
[1:23:03] offended I mean I would have been rating
[1:23:05] the choir with her and I would have said
[1:23:07] yes sister I understand your story bless
[1:23:12] God I'm almost getting offended just
[1:23:15] hearing it
[1:23:30] wow child Le make Believers believe so
[1:23:34] much
[1:23:37] false justifying forsaking thems
[1:23:41] together
[1:23:43] justifying everything they can find in
[1:23:45] the me justifying remarriage in the
[1:23:47] message justifying sitting home and
[1:23:49] listening to the YouTube internet the
[1:23:52] favorite preacher you want to hear
[1:23:55] justifying and and they got they got
[1:23:58] message bless God they got
[1:24:00] message I'll show you my
[1:24:12] quote and at the same time Shing
[1:24:16] their dropping their duties of
[1:24:19] supporting God's
[1:24:21] Kingdom in a local assembly
[1:24:24] or a local col or wherever God would
[1:24:27] place you maybe you need to move praise
[1:24:31] God brother Jeff
[1:24:33] moved
[1:24:36] amen see Ro Romans you know the people
[1:24:40] that would say that that would make
[1:24:43] prophets INF followable I'm going to
[1:24:44] read this and and this ain't I'm we're
[1:24:47] we're we're we're we're break down the
[1:24:48] end but Romans 8 see you know when you
[1:24:51] say the spirit of truth comes it will
[1:24:53] lead and guide you Romans 11:29 says for
[1:24:56] gifts and callings are without
[1:24:59] repentance so in the five-fold
[1:25:11] ministry uhhuh plus pray and Obey
[1:25:14] because God will obey this message that
[1:25:17] came out of a man's life mouth not every
[1:25:19] word of it he won't he's the god that
[1:25:22] gave it
[1:25:24] he's God himself God don't have to
[1:25:26] listen to me God is the one that speaks
[1:25:29] to me God don't have to listen to His
[1:25:31] prophets he's the one that speaks to the
[1:25:35] prophets it's the other way around it's
[1:25:38] God doing the
[1:25:39] given that's
[1:25:44] right
[1:25:46] wow he said now genuine Holiness
[1:25:48] Holiness is not part of me it's part of
[1:25:52] Christ Christ his Holiness watch what
[1:25:56] the prophet says here and I'm this is
[1:25:58] this is just to
[1:25:59] show you know there's spir it's not here
[1:26:02] but it's spirits in the things even US
[1:26:05] minister talked about it's things in the
[1:26:08] world it's coming around watch this I
[1:26:12] don't have one of these in my notes
[1:26:13] brother Bram said that the Gentile age
[1:26:15] started in Daniel and it started with
[1:26:18] Prophet worship and he said about one
[1:26:21] dozen times he said it will go out
[1:26:25] the exact same
[1:26:30] way if you were like all 12 of those
[1:26:32] quotes I will be very glad to send them
[1:26:35] to
[1:26:37] you it will go out the exact same way so
[1:26:40] if you believe we're at a Rapture time
[1:26:43] or we're at the end that means that the
[1:26:45] majority of the
[1:26:47] message will worship the prophet
[1:26:58] amen and you know the people that
[1:27:00] worship the prophet they think the
[1:27:01] pastor's wrong the teacher wrong the
[1:27:03] Evangelist is wrong the apostles wrong
[1:27:05] the missionaries wrong but the
[1:27:09] prophet what are you going to do with
[1:27:11] Romans
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:15] 11:29 now now if you don't know me very
[1:27:19] well this message is Vindicated sent by
[1:27:22] God God will do nothing but he sends his
[1:27:25] secrets to the servants the prophets
[1:27:29] brother Brown is a major prophet to this
[1:27:31] age but if this offends you that what
[1:27:34] brother Brown says then you're
[1:27:35] worshiping a prophet that ain't
[1:27:37] infallible by his own words and he's not
[1:27:41] deity of God and he made loads of
[1:27:43] mistakes if you want to take every you
[1:27:46] know some people even for Christmas I'm
[1:27:47] going to preach on Christmas but I'm
[1:27:48] going to do it in July I'm tell you
[1:27:50] ahead of time or August and I'll show
[1:27:52] you everything but you know a lot of
[1:27:54] people that do things at Christmas time
[1:27:56] and you know by the way brother Brown
[1:27:57] said Christmas ain't going away and and
[1:28:00] I get together at
[1:28:01] Christmas just in case in case you had a
[1:28:04] heart
[1:28:05] attack but it a lot of people that go
[1:28:08] way out on Christmas they say well look
[1:28:10] at what the prophet did well the prophet
[1:28:13] also tried to shoot
[1:28:15] people he also tried to shoot himself
[1:28:17] and he also tried to commit suicide by
[1:28:19] grabbing the electric fence
[1:28:25] that's right so like see there's a
[1:28:30] veil and then there's thus sayith the
[1:28:32] Lord that's right he he had thus sayith
[1:28:35] the Lord this message you know I'm I'm
[1:28:38] going to give you a quote I'm going to
[1:28:39] jump I'm going to jump something and I'm
[1:28:41] going to leave it with you and I'll give
[1:28:42] you the answer when we
[1:28:44] quit this message I I'm going to give
[1:28:47] you the answer please don't walk out if
[1:28:50] you anybody starts walking out I'm going
[1:28:51] to give you the answer before you hit
[1:28:52] the door
[1:28:54] this message is not the
[1:29:02] absolute but inside the message is the
[1:29:06] absolute that's
[1:29:09] right this message is not the absolute
[1:29:13] you know even brother bam said himself
[1:29:14] he said we have no book but the
[1:29:17] Bible I think I'll witness and hand out
[1:29:19] a church book oh
[1:29:22] no brother B said we have no Creed but
[1:29:26] the message oh no
[1:29:28] no no book but the Bible no Creed but
[1:29:31] love no you know how's that go you
[1:29:35] know that's right the message is not the
[1:29:40] absolute but inside of it is the
[1:29:44] absolute Donnie Reagan said
[1:29:47] that but if I had said that you probably
[1:29:49] would have left the
[1:29:51] church but Donnie Reagan said it so he's
[1:29:55] Vindicated
[1:29:59] so brother Braham said I have no
[1:30:02] Holiness to present to God he said I
[1:30:06] make thousands of mistakes each month
[1:30:08] each year and surely I do here's another
[1:30:11] one here's the
[1:30:13] answer here's these answers are not
[1:30:15] infallible see because the scriptures
[1:30:18] are infallible and as far as I know they
[1:30:21] line up with the scriptures and I hope
[1:30:23] to make this plain that the tapes are
[1:30:25] kept now for everyone that want to get
[1:30:28] it and I could have it but I know that
[1:30:31] the scriptures but I know that the
[1:30:33] scriptures are infallible but my
[1:30:37] answers are
[1:30:41] not if that offends you you don't have
[1:30:44] the Holy Ghost that I
[1:30:45] have you don't even believe the prophet
[1:30:48] cuz he said that about like 36 times or
[1:30:51] something like that you know maybe
[1:30:53] that's enough for you maybe it's got to
[1:30:54] be
[1:30:57] hundred yeah I'm ready to vomit these
[1:31:00] people that worship the
[1:31:02] prophet they give me their pet quote
[1:31:04] that they can marry their you know their
[1:31:06] second third fourth
[1:31:08] wife but they W give me no scripture
[1:31:10] though no I won't give you that Matthew
[1:31:12] 1919 or I won't give you 1 Corinthians 7
[1:31:16] no no to 10 you know I W I'm not going
[1:31:18] to give you those
[1:31:19] [Laughter]
[1:31:21] ones what ones you think brother
[1:31:23] brandham read yeah yeah he didn't read
[1:31:25] his own message he was the message he
[1:31:27] was preaching the
[1:31:29] message he said I made many mistakes and
[1:31:32] still make them and always will make
[1:31:39] them
[1:31:42] amen prophets are not infallible they're
[1:31:44] not Angels they're
[1:31:48] men you know the main people I'm closing
[1:31:51] on this when we preached on reverence
[1:31:53] the main people that were offend
[1:31:56] offended in the
[1:31:58] Bible the the two main examples in the
[1:32:02] Bible was Moses and the children of
[1:32:07] Israel they were offended with God every
[1:32:11] day Moses was offended with God when he
[1:32:14] called them he was offended with God
[1:32:16] when he sent him and he was offended
[1:32:18] with God before he could go into the
[1:32:19] promised
[1:32:22] land and the children of Israel were
[1:32:25] offended
[1:32:26] all the
[1:32:28] time all the time we looked at that last
[1:32:31] week so where do where do you sit or
[1:32:35] where do we sit or where does the world
[1:32:41] sit well there's never been a time in
[1:32:44] history when there's been more
[1:32:49] division more
[1:32:51] divorce more separation you know it used
[1:32:54] to be back about World War II you know
[1:32:56] you were committed you know like like
[1:32:59] divorce was like
[1:33:00] 1% you know you went to the same I'm not
[1:33:04] saying you have to I don't mean that cuz
[1:33:06] we had to come out of her my people and
[1:33:09] move into the truth but people never
[1:33:13] moved they never moved from the province
[1:33:15] they never moved from their Church they
[1:33:17] never quit their job whatever their dad
[1:33:19] was they were that for 100,000 years
[1:33:22] after and and then never they married
[1:33:24] the the neighbor's daughter
[1:33:28] and but
[1:33:31] now we have so
[1:33:33] much Earthly and phys
[1:33:38] spiritually and we're all
[1:33:41] offended or we deal with it I should say
[1:33:44] we deal with
[1:33:47] it but we can get to a point you know
[1:33:49] every one of those examples except Acts
[1:33:54] was before the Holy Ghost was
[1:33:56] given and I mean they were Radical
[1:33:59] decisions like people getting murdered
[1:34:02] and
[1:34:06] dying and if you
[1:34:09] testify and believe and I do that we're
[1:34:12] living in the greatest age we have never
[1:34:15] had the revealed word all the Mysteries
[1:34:17] are open the seals are broke the Bible's
[1:34:19] a brand new book it's I'm in love with
[1:34:22] God and and and and I I've seen them
[1:34:26] unveiled completely in the three room
[1:34:31] house and I've even had Fellowship not
[1:34:33] just in the kitchen in the living room
[1:34:34] but even in the
[1:34:39] bedroom and you can still get
[1:34:44] offended you if that's the
[1:34:48] case with the
[1:34:52] truth then you need to look in the
[1:34:55] mirror if somebody can show you Bible
[1:34:58] with scripture or Bible with the message
[1:35:01] Hub that's get what the prophet said
[1:35:03] directly to that scripture and that
[1:35:05] starts a
[1:35:07] little in
[1:35:11] you everybody's like oh I don't like
[1:35:14] where that's
[1:35:17] going you know if there's just a little
[1:35:19] oh oh
[1:35:21] oh just a first little hint of oh I'm
[1:35:27] offended there ain't one Speck of God in
[1:35:29] there because that is
[1:35:32] God man the revealed word the spirit and
[1:35:35] Truth when it comes and the message is
[1:35:38] when the spirit of truth comes it will
[1:35:39] lead and guide you in all
[1:35:42] truth the same as the Bible brother
[1:35:44] Brown said don't just give me one verse
[1:35:46] don't give me one verse but do it in
[1:35:48] continuity with the scriptures
[1:35:50] continuity by established by two or
[1:35:52] three Witnesses
[1:35:56] just the
[1:35:57] flow of God's spirit because remember
[1:36:01] even in this message he hid it from the
[1:36:03] wise and prudent and revealed it unto
[1:36:05] babe such as would
[1:36:07] learn you know and I've said this before
[1:36:10] and and I am going to shut up and I I I
[1:36:12] hope a couple of you will shake my hands
[1:36:14] before you leave but you know every
[1:36:16] doctrinal issue the brother Brown
[1:36:17] preached he preached both
[1:36:19] ways and he did it for a reason God
[1:36:22] allowed it for a reason for people to
[1:36:24] get if I didn't
