[music] Amen. Let's just take our Bibles and turn to the scripture. Amen. Just maybe one announcement when we did it. Um Vicki helped me make a group text for the church. So it the text will be coming from Mayor Lannne or from my phone. Anyway, so if you get a text and you just send us thumbs up or a smiley face or something, we'll know that uh we're all still alive. Amen. Amen. Still got the messages. Amen. Amen. Let's go to Romans 18. Amen. Just so 18. &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. Romans 11. I'm sorry. I know Vickiy's walking up my thing, but I'm just going to read one scripture. Vicki, I got more than that down here. But verse 18, boast not against the branches, but if thou boast, thou beest not the root, but the root of thee. Boast not against the branches. And if thou boast, thou boastst not against the root, but the root thee. Lord Jesus, I pray that you be with the ministering of the word, Lord God. And may you meet every shortcoming and every uh disappointment, Lord God, and every we take every spirit under our control in Jesus Christ's name. And Lord, may you just unfold yourself to us. we pray and the simplicity of preaching, Lord God. And we we pray that you'll be with all of us, Lord God. May I not say nothing that's outside of your will, Lord God. We pray to your people, your bride. They're not mine, Lord God. I'm Eleaser, Lord God, purchased by your blood, your life, Lord God, your bride, your wife to be, Lord God. We pray that you'll bless us in this small gathering today. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. And you may have your seats. Amen. I want to God wants me, that's a better way to put it. God wants me to minister the next two or three Sundays on the seed of God brings the nature of God. &gt;&gt; The seed of God uh sorry, watch for a screen now. The seed of God brings the nature of God. And I am no way uh I you know you just have to trust me and if you can't trust me then you have to I don't know make another choice or something. But I I don't minister this because I got some kind of an eagle or or not at all. If I ministered anything outside of God's leadership, it would just be man's words. Amen. But you know, in the last couple months, God's dealt with me. I've had this in my iPad. I started this probably six weeks ago. &gt;&gt; Probably six weeks ago. And you know, over this past summer after our camp, we went a few places and and uh and every church is sovereign and and we're we're not concerned about what other people do. Amen. But I heard visiting ministers say stuff that was blatantly off the word, like black and white, off the word. But I sat there, sometimes even on the platform and watched 200 people praise God because it was a visiting minister from another country. And so when I minister in the next couple weeks, I'm just going to let the Bible and the prophet tell you if I'm off. But I'll guarantee you that the seed of God that's going in the rapture will first have the nature of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it won't be a hotty spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It won't be a hotty spirit. It won't be I'm better than everybody else &gt;&gt; cuz those people are not going in the rapture. Maybe we should read verse 18 again. Boast not against the branches. But if ye boast, thou beest not the root. Who's the root? That's Christ. That's God. And I can't go to another message church or even have somebody hardly come here and preach without boasting. Well, bless God, we're the only ones. Bless God, we're &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Lord. I got one brother on my side. &gt;&gt; This is Romans. &gt;&gt; This is Paul. You know, I'm I'm going to say this, and this is this is a full sermon ahead of my plans on my notes, but if you know what we know and the revelation that's coming our day, and you've had the opportunity to to to listen to the message in your own language of brother Brandham, you should be loosening your mind with gratitude, &gt;&gt; but not boasting &gt;&gt; because I'm going to prove to you in the next 30 weeks or next three weeks, sorry, maybe the next 30. God dies. Uh that it will not just be message believers that know Brother Bram's name that are going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I got Brother Brown said that. &gt;&gt; Anybody's afraid to say amen. &gt;&gt; You don't even believe the message, let alone the Bible. Do you know that right now there's 52 countries in the world that Christianity and the Bible is banned? &gt;&gt; Forget about what we call the message. &gt;&gt; Do you know that a dozen countries in the world that you're shot on site executed firing squad &gt;&gt; if you're the Bible? &gt;&gt; And you think they're going to have to know brother Abraham's name to know Christ? &gt;&gt; Impossible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because God's impossible and not because the message is not the truth. It's dad the truth. That's what should give us gratitude because we had the opportunity to know it. [music] You know the Bible that said this? The Bible said to whom much is given &gt;&gt; much will be required. &gt;&gt; Let me rephrase that. To whom much is given in Wyoming church. &gt;&gt; Forget your pastor. It don't have nothing to do with your pastor. You have the message on books. You have the message on CDs. You have the message on the internet. You have the to whom much is given &gt;&gt; and you make your own conclusion if you're worthy to what you've brother preached the things of thinking man filter. Are we worthy? Is your life worthy of this gospel? Are you is your life that's your own choice. Is your life worthy of what God's given you? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm going to take my time because God wants us to get something &gt;&gt; and uh it's only for the ones that God wants them to get. &gt;&gt; If we'd read verse 20, maybe we'll go up to 17. I got 17 on. Sorry, Vicki. I'm sorry. I'm trying to hurry and I'm I'm getting spanked by God. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a gentile, a wild olive tree, that's every one of us sitting here, &gt;&gt; were grafted in amongst them, and and with them be partaker of the root. That's being partaker of God's goodliness, and the fatness of the off the tree. Boast not against the ones that you were grafted into. Let's just jump to verse 20. Well, because of unbelief, they were broken off. And thou standest by faith. Be not highminded. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I preached what Paul preached." &gt;&gt; Paul laid the foundation. Brother Bram built on that. Be not high minded, &gt;&gt; but fear. &gt;&gt; You can't name me many message churches that practice that. &gt;&gt; I'll just say amen for you. Amen. I know it's the truth because God showed it to me. &gt;&gt; You will not believe how much ammunition that God gave me in my iPad. I could preach probably for 30 services, but I'll try to get it in three. &gt;&gt; You are saved by amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not of yourself. It is a gift. It is a gift. It is a gift. &gt;&gt; It is a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I said something before and uh I want to clarify something. I don't believe that you can come to this glorious truth, this message that we've come to and turn it down. That's iniquity. Because see, this message is not just a message. This is a revelation of the Bible of This is a revelation of God. It's a revelation of the Bible, but it's a revelation of Christ. And so you can't come to this message and say, "Well, this is all hog." No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not talking about that. &gt;&gt; You You can't turn down truth and think you're going in the rapture. But there's ones that will go in the rapture that will have received less than you have received. &gt;&gt; That's Bible. You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; So, you know, I'm not talking about people that turn down this truth. You can't turn down the Bible and turn down the revelation of the Bible and think you're converted. &gt;&gt; But you also can't believe the Bible and think you're the only one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because verse 21 says, "For if God spare not the natural branches, take heed, lest he spare not thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, watch this. My title for those that just come in is the seed of God always brings the nature of God. Want to know what the nature of God was? His nature was I would that none would be lost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He never came to the cross saying, "Well, it's just going to be me make it." &gt;&gt; Maybe we should read verse 20 again. Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standeth by faith, but be not &gt;&gt; high-minded. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think you're the only one going in the rapture, you're high-minded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But fear, John, let's go to our next scripture. John 5 24. Amen. There's just a ton of ton of ton of just fantastic fruit here, you know. And so I want to just hit on some different things. Amen. here. Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me, &gt;&gt; that's Jehovah, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, &gt;&gt; but pass from death onto life. Now, that's a promise given to anybody that believe on Christ &gt;&gt; that God the Father sent him to earth to redeem me &gt;&gt; shall have everlasting life and not come to condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 4:30 and 32. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption. And let all this this is how you grieve God. This is exactly how you grieve God. Bible. Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, evil speaking. I'm the only one worthy. Be put away from you with all malice. And this now we're coming into the nature of God. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We We have to be so careful because of what we have not to get hotty and high-minded. I'm going to show you things that are going to make you fall right off your pew of what our prophet said. Amen. Truthful things. You know, there will be many surprises when we get over there. &gt;&gt; Watch in the water baptism. Our first quote here, he said, "When the word that's written in parables and everything else that can only be revealed, only the truth will ever be known by spiritual revelation." Well, how do you get spiritual revelation? It ain't by believing this message. Because Christ said to Peter, "Blessed are you, Simon by Jonah, for flesh and blood never revealed this unto you, but my father [screaming] &gt;&gt; which is in heaven has revealed this unto you. And upon this rock, &gt;&gt; it was the revelation of God." There's billions of people that will read a message book and throw them in the garbage. Now, I feel sorry for those people because it is unveiling of God. It is the truth of God. But you can't find out about God. The prophet said this thousands of times. You cannot know who God is by education. &gt;&gt; So you can't read the message and get a revelation of God. &gt;&gt; It's by grace. &gt;&gt; It's by grace. &gt;&gt; You find out the revelation of this message because God opened your eyes so you could see it. What you understand about water baptism? Thousands of people could read and they're just like, "Well, I don't see it. I don't see &gt;&gt; what you know about serpent seed." Millions of people could read it and they just I don't see nothing different. &gt;&gt; And but because God anointed your eyes and because God anointed your eyes, you will be held accountable for more in more stuff. spiritual revelation. And if you watch this now, this is what I told you when I traveled &gt;&gt; and and I'm I'm just it's not because it's not because I'm brother Dale's very uneducated, but it's because it water and oil don't mix. &gt;&gt; And you when you drop water in a pale of oil, it just rides right up on top. And so when I'm swear someone else is in the pulpit and they say something that just flat out don't mix. It just rides right up on top and God says, "Well, I have a thousand scriptures that say contradict that." Here the prophet says, "If your revelation doesn't tie it together, then your revelation is wrong." See, it must blend. Like you're putting a jigsaw puzzle together. It don't have anything to do with the sides here. And look what he said. The sense is all mixed up. And you say, "Well, I believe it goes here and I believe it goes there." That's the human mind. &gt;&gt; People can do things with their human mind, but the first thing you know, your scene will be wrong and you'll be putting the cow on top of the tree. I heard a bunch of cows that were on top of trees in the last two or three months in churches around Ontario. &gt;&gt; And see if you don't work it. See, but if you will, if you got something here to go by, oh, now you say God revealed something to me. If it isn't according to the word and ties the word together, then your revelation is wrong. Right. The word. &gt;&gt; That means you do not have to know Brother Bram's name to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because John 5 said that if you believe on him that sent me. &gt;&gt; You shall have everlasting life and not come to the condemnation but shall pass from death unto life. Matthew shows it here. Matthew 16:17 and 18. And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah." Sorry, I'll read this. I just quoted this. For for flesh and blood did not reveal this unto you, but my father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock shall I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. That revelation is supernatural revelation. You can't get educated into the revelation of God. Here in a quote here of the prophet, he said, "If your revelation doesn't die, you say, well, God revealed it unto me and I should be baptized in the in the titles." He said if it doesn't tie with the word from Genesis to Revelations and it ties it all together then your revelation is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we we have to we have to be careful this whole this whole thought is God was never God was always the lamb of humility. always &gt;&gt; he was spit upon beard. You know when he was on the cross he said he saves other but himself he could not save. He said I could have called 10 legions of angels &gt;&gt; to destroy the world and set them free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when the prophet called out I'm going to just I'm showing you some some facts so you don't all get up and leave right away. But you know when the prophet came out and cursed those boys and the she bearer come out and ate all those boys. Brother Bram said that was not the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It was an angry prophet. &gt;&gt; See, the seed of God will always bring the nature of God. &gt;&gt; And the nature of God is you'll never say we're the only ones. &gt;&gt; You'll never say that ever. &gt;&gt; You'll never say that. That is straight from hell. Proverbs 16:18 and 19. Pride goeth before destruction and a hotty spirit before a fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. Better better is it to be of a humble spirit and and with lowly than to divide the spools with the proud. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, well, I want to take this revelation and dovetail it from Genesis to Revelations and the same in the prophet. You know, I'm going to I'm going to quote you quotes that the prophet said in the seventh seal that contradicts things that we heard just in the last few months. Here our next quote here and this is just showing how the nature of God will be different. Now sometimes we refer to people and he and he says look at this. He said like myself going forth praying for the sick and having success. Now I just like maybe a show of hands. Did brother Brandon have successful meetings praying for the sick? I mean God working through the brother. Oh yeah for sure. Watch this. He says, "That don't mean I'll go to heaven." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That don't mean I'll go to heaven. That That sounds really hottie to me, don't it? I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet that was the seed of God. And the prophet, Brother Brham, had the nature of God. You'd be surprised if the pro and he's not because he's his work is done. But if he came back, he would preach a completely different message than what many churches are healing around the country today. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Patty. &gt;&gt; A very different message. &gt;&gt; Cuz your prophet was humble, &gt;&gt; humble, &gt;&gt; humble, &gt;&gt; and more humble. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you something else. He was genuine. &gt;&gt; He was genuine and used of God &gt;&gt; like nobody since or before. &gt;&gt; See, the person that really gets to heaven, here's brother Bam still capital letters. The person that really gets to heaven will little be a little surprised you got there. You know what this is? Humility. This is humility. Land tells me it's nothing but grace. If I ever make it, it'll be amazing grace. &gt;&gt; It'll be more than amazing. It'll be actually unbelievable. It won't be, well, I'm the only one. God revealed it onto me. &gt;&gt; Next pair got I don't know if I we we got we got time. We are we all right? We got a little bit time. I'll just quit when it's time to quit and start up next week. Many in that day will say, "When I when you were naked, Lord, we clothed thee." They they don't understand when when you were hungry, we fed thee. And when you were in prison, you visited me. And he said, "In so much as you did it onto these, my brethren, you did it onto me." And they didn't even think that they were worthy to get there. &gt;&gt; They didn't even think they were worthy to get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where I'm going, Vicki. right there and then think that we're some kind of a big shot. &gt;&gt; No. No. Okay. Am I in line with our prophet? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. I'm just going to say, wow. &gt;&gt; And when we think that we're some kind of a big shot, how are you ever going to get to have that spirit get there? The message is the only one going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Never. Never. 52 countries in the world can't have the rapture or the message. And the Bible says that there will be people from every country, tongue, nation, and language go on the rapture. &gt;&gt; I mean, maybe I I wasn't going to and I might retell it better, but I listened to a a testimony that moved me. Unbelievable. Like, I've never been moved from a regular person from North Korea. And I I will almost guarantee you, you haven't heard it. It was almost supernatural how I got it. And he was living his life to be an engineer in North Korea. And his grandma was about to die. And it was literally less than 3 days before she died. She got him there. Now to very speak anything but to worship of Kim and the leaders is death. It's called treason. firing squad. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; When people come over here in our big country and they get highminded and bigheaded and and think that we got all the answers. Brother Bram said, "When you go to the mission field, you better know that he's on your side cuz those witch doctors will tie you up and spit you out." This grandma said told this young boy that had never heard of any gospel other than the government of the country. &gt;&gt; You don't think that's possible? They have no internet in that country. They have no media except the worship of the government. To own a Bible there is death almost on the spot. his grandma said, he said, "Your grandpa didn't die like you think he did. He believed in Jesus and he was sent away and died that way." And she said, "I have secretly served him my whole entire life. And now that I'm ready to die, I'm telling you that now." You have to picture this. This is a 30-year-old man ready to graduate from engineer school. He thinks I I know this is hard for you to believe. It was hard for me to believe. And you want me to tell you something else? If I could get a hold of that guy, I would invite him to this church to give his testimony. &gt;&gt; He's living in the States right now. He didn't know. Honestly, honestly, he didn't know with his whole heart that there was any other god other than the leaders of North Korea. That's hard to believe. Let me tell you something else hard to believe. My wife was born into a very rich, very big family in Indiana. And she had to meet me to hear about the prophet. And I didn't even know about him when I met her. &gt;&gt; But she grew up and walked around where the prophet walked. &gt;&gt; And never ever one time seen a quote, a picture, a nothing. &gt;&gt; A nothing. &gt;&gt; That's hard to believe. She had to go to Wallisburg Church to hear Lonnie Jenkins preach the first message that was truth. &gt;&gt; You know, God can't stand a hotty spirit. &gt;&gt; God can't stand a proud spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's disgusting. And so this boy just maybe I I wasn't planning on telling this testimony, but long story short, you know, his grandma dies and he's like he's got this in his head. There's a real God. But he he knew. And for him to search to find something outside of the God of his government was death. Death. &gt;&gt; They don't mess around. Forget the trial. It's immediate. You want to see the power of God, you need to do a little traveling. You You'll feel something supernatural. And he was somewhere uptown and somebody caught his spirit. Literally caught his spirit. And he said, "We should go for a walk." He said, "Okay." Never seen the person before. Ever. Ever. See, God is still God. And the guy they were walking beside a creek and everything this you had never heard all the secrecy until you were in a communist country like that. And he said I noticed something about you. Everything is very secretive. Very secretive. They don't trust nobody in that country. If somebody's caught for treason, like if I was caught, all my grandparents older than me, everybody older than me, aunts and uncles and everybody would be killed. And everybody younger than me that had the same name as me that would really wean out the length staff jeans. It don't matter if you agreed or hated or anything. It's unbelievable. It's execution mass. Anyway, after this is I mean I'm telling you in three or four minutes, but this is after literally months and years. Uh they secretly figured out that they were and so the guy fellowshipped with them some that he was he'd heard the name Jesus. Like that was just like unbelievable to him. Think of how much more you've heard than just the name Jesus. Just let that sink in for a minute. Just think how much more you've hurt than just a simple name. Jesus, I'm not worthy. I'm not even close to worthy. And so the the guy taught him some motions that they could uh communicate secretly. And uh anyway, after about a year or two, they trusted him enough to uh take him to a gathering. And he said it was so serious when we went to the gathering that my only person I knew that served God in the world. That's just unbelievable. We never went into the gathering but 20 minutes apart. We never rode together. We never went into the gathering together. And we went in a falling down building. He said there was just like one handful of people in a circle. And he said, "We come in 20 minutes later and that was an underground church like you've never seen before. And if they ever get caught, they would just been massacred right on the spot. Right. Right on the spot. Not maybe, not sort of." And so he went there for about 2 or 3 years. I mean, the trust is like through the roof. You talk about trust. We ain't got none of that here. And after like two years or something, they said, "Okay, you've been here for and everybody left and his friend stayed behind in this place and he moved some furniture and in the secret wall they had a New Testament only." And he said, "We have two of these in the group." And he said, "Nobody's allowed to have it more than two days." Nobody's allowed to have it more than two days. He said, "If this is caught on you, you're shot instantly. And he said, 'If you reveal who we are, we're shot instantly also. And he said, 'I got that Bible. And he said, I memorize books of the Bible. Not verses, books of the Bible, and I would play them through my thoughts when I never had the Bible. Anyway, I'm taking too long in this testimony, but I want I want you to get this. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He was returning the Bible and he was used to going through the guards for his school in the engineering and they knew him and he had the Bible hidden in an inside liner in the suitcase. Has ever anybody ever been searched in Canada and the inside liners of your luggage for hidden things? Notice my hand still up. I have been. I had my suitcase completely almost destroyed in the Toronto airport. I must have been hiding something. Take a look. Certainly don't have an honest face. I was stunned. But I tell you something. There's going to be some more things you're going to be stunned at before the rapture happens. &gt;&gt; Right here. &gt;&gt; There's things happening right here. Anyway, he had it hid so well they never found it. But the guy was he never found it even when he took it apart, but he felt it and he lied. He said, "My my bag came apart and I put a board in there to support it." And that's what you're feeling is the hard part. And they ripped the cut his bag apart and the Bible fell out in the ground. They said, "Treason." Not maybe treason. It is treason. Cuz there's only one God there, and that's Kim. They threw him in a vehicle, put him in a room 3x3 by3 with the bucket. And the next morning, they brought him out to the firing squad. They blindfolded him, brought him out before the firing squad. in his building. When they got him up against the wall where the wall was banged with all kinds of bullets and all that, they took this blindfold off and I I forget did I tell you? I think there was six five or six young soldiers. He said many of them would have never executed anybody before because they it it shows you know when you're serving Satan they you want to pro you know when you go into different secret societies you have to do things to prove your faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're online. So, I mean, that's online, too. So, it's fine. If I disappear, I didn't kill myself. Amen. There's things that you do in secret societies that you have to prove that you're loyal to that society. Freemasons is a society. [snorts] You You can Google that. You don't have to believe anything I'm telling you. Anyway, and that's like to show these soldiers that they're loyal to Kim and he's the only God, everybody has to get a chance to execute people that are treasoned. And so they were there and they raised his trial. Bible caught on and that they all brought up the guns to shoot him and the guns wouldn't shoot. &gt;&gt; The guy beside him was losing his mind because it was his badge. He's under Kim, you know. So he grabbed the closest gun next to him and grabbed it. Checked it and shot him also. It wouldn't shoot. So he told him to reload, put new ammunition in, and all five or six of them what they were. I have this testimony. I'm This is not fiction, &gt;&gt; by the way. &gt;&gt; This is a living person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living person that lives in the States. &gt;&gt; And if I can get his name and I could get him to come here, I would. &gt;&gt; They reloaded and the guns wouldn't fire. And I actually, now this is where SK, I don't know if they went and got six more people, but they had a timeout. And he thought he actually believed, he honestly believed the young man, the Christian young man honestly believed that it was a type of a fear tactic to get him to break down and denounce Christ and they did time out. And I this is the part the only part I don't know from memory and I listened to it multiple times is or many and I would have listened I didn't plan on sharing it today or would listen again, but I'm not sure if they brought in six more or not. But anyway, the guns wouldn't shoot. Now I I now this is no. And now listen, if you're here to this Sunday, you got to be here next Sunday cuz I'm going to tell you what our prophet says about stuff like this. And I can't get to it all in one day. &gt;&gt; But this person never heard of Brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; but there's still a God. Now, yes, God used brother Brandham. Yes, he was the messenger, the star for this age. Yes. And yes, it unveiled the mysteries. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to know all the mysteries to make guns not work. &gt;&gt; And so they actually believed it was some kind of witchcraft spirit. And they talked about the heavens weren't in favor of the government and this that. He talks about them and he said they the two young soldiers went in and put them back in his cell and he said they don't know it but they heard I heard them talking. And he said they their bosses and that were so afraid of how that was going to de demoralize that jail cell and the people like the people that were over it and his boss and the people in charge of doing that executing they like they could get executed by him and like it was just crazy. Anyway, I got this ain't my whole message but long story short, the next day they sent him to a labor camp which was basically labor camp for death. uh totally death. And there was another guard in there that that over he the labor they mined stuff that wrecked their lungs. And so he was he said, "I seen people die every day and beat and he seen you name it, he seen it." And I'm trying to get on to my message. Anyway, another guard that had been put in there for treason also helped him escape. Now, I want to show you how his faith was. He he told the guard, he said, "How are we going to get out?" And you know what the guard asked him? He said, "You're serving a god that stopped the guns from shooting you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're worrying how you're going to get out. &gt;&gt; What kind of a dummy are you? And then he said, "But what are we going to eat when we're out there?" And you know, and how we going to And he tells him the same thing again. He said, "Now, he just stopped like how many guns from literally shooting you, Dad. and you're worried about what you're going to eat tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Anyway, long story short, they went through they they went after they'd been in the prison long enough, they were trust that they went out to to to clear trees and make logs. This is this is a true story. This is not no fairy tale. And when they were doing the logs, they they they studied like they have unbelievable amount of time. They studied everything. They studied the guards and they knew where the guards would meet, then turn around and walk back and they knew the time that the guards would change. And so any break in the they would have and he said we had about a two-minute break when the guards went back and they would change the guards. But one something happened the one day they were there and the phone rg and the one guard went to answer the phone and the guy looked at them and give them the sign, drop your things and they dropped their tools and they went through the bush. They went through the bush and of course immediately they let the dogs out for them and and the the bullets and of course and that and he said you know uh you know I imagine you could really move when you know you know this is really it. And they got past that and and and away from that. And so then they came to the line and he said, "Now this is another dangerous spot because the the the borders were guarded and they had to cross the creek and they tied their shoes around their neck cuz they wanted to put their shoes back on dry and they were waiting through." And he said the guards they they also studied them. and they'd watch them come right by and overlap and then right by and they they were close enough they could hide them and they were there in the night in the dark and the fog and and so he said when the guards went back he said we went in and we went into the river but he said we couldn't make any noise in the river and he said oh boy so he said it was just like ice freezing ice but he couldn't make sound he said the current was so deep that he said I got my foot he let go and he said I started floating downstream the guy actually grabbed onto me and hung me up and he said our heads were coming out or our nose were coming out of the water and he He said, "We heard the guards coming back by and they were talking about soccer and sports." And he said, "Our nose was out." And he said, "If there would have been one sound," he said, "we would have been we would have been sheared with gunfire in the water." They got to the other side. They went to a now they're in China, which is only slightly better. Um, and uh, they they went to a barn and and all this and and uh they they actually hid in the barn until their clothes got dressed and then they they tried to look like a Chinese and they would only go out at night. And they finally found a a a secret undercover and his buddy went to South Korea because he had family there. And this man is in the States right now. You know what he does for a living? He goes around to churches, tells them how blessed they are, tells them a real testimony. I stood and fired a firing squad. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have so much so much. And that ain't to take away from, you know, uh if God wants this brother to know the message, he'll bring him to it. But there will be ones in those countries that will go to the rapture that will never been honored and blessed to know the revelation and the blessings that you know. &gt;&gt; And it's insulting to them and insulting to God &gt;&gt; to say different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me get back on my quote. I'm sorry. [snorts] We're going to start there about the third line down. Fourth line. He said, "When you take that attitude that you're bigger than somebody else or bigger than somebody else, you're larger in number or your denomination is bigger or something like that, how are you ever going to make it over there like that?" He said, "When the robe was to make them all look alike in the sight of God, we're all alike." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see this? Amen. We We because we're blessed with the truth and the revelation and and all that go with it. Yes, it's the truth. But I want to show you something. Spirits don't die. We're going back to the Bible. Spirits don't die and they don't change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Luke 9:46. Watch how the same spirit was back when Jesus was here is what it is right here in our midst. &gt;&gt; And then arose reasoning among them which of them should be the greatest. Well, there you go. That was the message of the day. &gt;&gt; Who's the greatest message person? And Jesus perceiving their thoughts of their hearts, took a little child, and he sat him by him. And he said unto them, "Whosoever shall receive this little child in the name receiveth me? And whosoever shall receive me receive him that sent me. For he that is the least among you all." Now, who would be the least among you all spiritually speaking? Somebody who wasn't blessed to hear this message yet because they live in one of the 52 countries in the world that haven't even been allowed to have a Bible. &gt;&gt; Watch what Jesus said. The least among you all, the same shall be the greatest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I've been blessed to know this message, but I haven't stood in front of a firing squad and the gun's not working. Amen. &gt;&gt; But somebody else wasn't blessed to hear the message and they stood in front of a firing squad and the guns didn't work multiple times. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean? &gt;&gt; We have to be very very very careful. Now, is this Bible? Amen. We we we realize this is Luke now. &gt;&gt; And watch how this goes along. You can't make this stuff up. I I'm not even this smart to put it together. In verse 49, and John answered and said, Master God, Jesus, Jehovah, whatever you want to say, we saw someone casting out devils in thy name, and we forbade them because he didn't follow us. Followed not us. &gt;&gt; We forbade them. Does that sound familiar? Does anybody catching this? &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, "Forbay them not, for he that is not against us is for us." So because somebody ain't sitting in the church that you go to, &gt;&gt; if they're serving God with all the revelation that God's given them and all the knowledge that God's given them and all the understanding that's got I don't mean turning it down. You can't turn it down. That's iniquity. But I mean, if if God's brought you truth and you've accepted it, and he brought you more truth and you accepted it, and he brought you more truth and you accepted it, &gt;&gt; but you haven't reached the kind of truth that you're sitting in. &gt;&gt; You have no reason to kick him out. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't turn down truth. That's sin. That's iniquity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I have a story to prove this that our prophet sold. Remember the story about the ranch owner &gt;&gt; that brought his son to the town to find a wife for his son. &gt;&gt; Now, I I have literally dozens and dozens of scriptures and quotes the next three weeks. I pray every one of you that are here cuz you're almost going to think I'm anti anti- something but I'm going to prove it by the prophet and you know the story of the the rich man and he was in and all the brides can we take the prophet did the prophet say that the natural types of spiritual &gt;&gt; was he did he not say that he was a typology and all he could use was typology &gt;&gt; okay so this rich young man was around all the message girls in the message and all they were were a bunch of flirt heads and his head was getting all foggy and brother Bram said he stepped outside because see they knew their value. Watch this. Watch this. Those girls that the rancher's dad brought her son to the girls that she first went to, they knew they were hot stuff. &gt;&gt; They knew their value. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the son stepped outside to clear his head. Now watch me. And there was a girl there that did not know her value. &gt;&gt; And she was a watch girl. And she was throwing out the wash work. And she wasn't dressed up. She wasn't puffed up. She wasn't smelled up. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; She did not know her value. And the son said, "I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you." Remember, she did not know her value. And she's like, the prophet doesn't like, "Oh, [screaming] no. What did I do? What did I do? Did I get water?" And she's like, "No, no, no. Don't don't talk to me. You go talk to them." &gt;&gt; Remember, there was one daughter there that didn't know her value, and that was a wash daughter. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; She was not the one that said, "I'm going to be the only one going in the rapture." She said, "I know I'm not worthy to go. I'm not even planning on going." &gt;&gt; And that was the one the son picked. &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference in the attitude? Amazing different attitude. Now that same story &gt;&gt; is also told in Mark and I'm not going to read it. The same story we talked about who will be the greatest among us is told in Mark 9:33 to 41. It's also told in there that they seen somebody that didn't attend their church, didn't believe the same message, and didn't follow the same prophet. Watch this. Do you know those people that were casting out demons did not follow the same prophet as the disciples &gt;&gt; because Jesus was a prophet. He was more than a prophet. He was Jehovah. But but but one of his names would have been prophet &gt;&gt; and he didn't follow us. You see? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, now listen, I'm not trying to de Jesus was more than a prophet, but one of his callings would have been a prophet. And they said, "Because he didn't follow us, we forbid them." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Why would you do that?" &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one. Let's let's go let's see what the prophet says. And a few days later, when [clears throat] they found a man that was not in their uh You're going to have to pull that up there. I don't know what that big word is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ecclesiastical Rome. What's that mean? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, he wasn't in their church. Now, this is the prophet by Is that all right if I show the prophet? &gt;&gt; And and we heard Jesus pronounce these things and he was getting the job done &gt;&gt; and he was casting out devils. And Peter and John came to him and said, "We had belonged." He didn't belong to their group and he couldn't do it. Why is brother Brandon preaching on that? Cuz God told him to. &gt;&gt; Why am I preaching on it? Because God told me to. &gt;&gt; You'll have to follow us and link up with us and you're going to and we're the church and you got nothing to do with it. Oh boys, I love the prophet. He said, "Stuff nobody reads." &gt;&gt; You know, it's cold. I got all the farmwork done. I can spend whole days studying the prophet. &gt;&gt; I find stuff there that has never been taught before. &gt;&gt; He Jesus said, and he let them know to attend to their own business. And here Jesus, he said he was getting along pretty good. Well, without joining their organization. How would that fit into most ranks? That is what the prophet said, right? Did I misquote it? Was I even misleading what the prophet said here? Next one. He said a few days later from then they found man casting out devils who wasn't a disciple and the man were getting the job done and he actually was getting it done and he was casting out devils and they stood around here and Jesus said whosoever will &gt;&gt; see whosoever will will serve Christ. &gt;&gt; Now this this is brother Brandham's preaching by the way. So if you don't like this kind of a slander on the message, you're going to have to talk to the prophet. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's me." And away he went and he's getting the job done. That's right. He said, "And they were and watch this though. This Oh, you maybe got that on there." And they were jealous because they couldn't do it. And they told Jesus, "We forbided him." And Jesus said,"Forbid him not, for he that is not with us scatterth abroad, and no man can do miracles in my name and speak lightly of me." And today, watch this. Now, you need, we could probably close after this. It's only 11:14, but I can go a little further. And today, it's nothing but play. childlike juvenile delinquency, juvenile jealousy among the high churches that won't bring themselves down to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and practice divine healing powers in the Holy Ghost among the churches. Amen. That's exactly it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. What we're preaching against is an arrogant spirit. &gt;&gt; And it's not the nature of God. &gt;&gt; You know, you know, when you get an arrogant spirit, it's because you have low self-esteem. You know, anybody that's troubled with smoking or drinking or doing drugs or anything at school or anything off your own conviction, you you know what, parents, your young kids, and when they're teenagers, you need to teach them who they are in Christ. &gt;&gt; And nobody can take it from them. &gt;&gt; Nobody. I am God's child. Period. &gt;&gt; I don't need to smoke to be cool. I don't need to drink to be cool. I don't need to do drugs to be cool. I don't need to do all these sins to be cool. I'm already cool. &gt;&gt; God's cool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Not I'm not in an arrogant standpoint, but but but when you get when you get arrogant, you got low self-esteem and you're trying to prove something that you don't have to prove. You watch this. You watch the richest people in the world &gt;&gt; wear no jewelry. They never wear a tie. &gt;&gt; They wear a t-shirt. Maybe just plain cuz they don't have to prove that they got money. &gt;&gt; But you see a [screaming] poor little person like me and I'll put on a gold necklace and try to buy a $100 suit to show you that I'm really something. &gt;&gt; Maybe ain't got five cents in the bank. &gt;&gt; You see the difference? Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you got God in your bank account, you don't have to prove nothing to nobody. &gt;&gt; You're working out your salvation between you and Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to prove to this church that you're of Jehovah. If nobody else can see it, well, Jehovah can see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that was a quote by the way. Notice and now how pretty people can be. Next quote, Vicki. These disciples, they were just like other men. Two [clears throat] or three days later, they found a man casting out devils and he was getting the job done, doing a real job. And the disciples found him and just like the man of our day. And they said, "Come join our church. Come be a message believer. Come hook up with us cuz you can't do this unless you go with us." I I do believe this totally. This is the full truth. But sometimes it takes years for people to come to this &gt;&gt; years. &gt;&gt; You got to trust God. This ain't drive-through McDonald's. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're witnessing to people that will they might not come here for you if if they're God's elect seed. They'll come to to to the fullness of the word if if if they're allowed to by by the governments and all this. But I'm just saying it it's not by Dale's schedule. &gt;&gt; They you know, Brother Bram said that grandma's prayers could be answered after she dies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you don't see something. Don't don't be so radical to throw them out. &gt;&gt; That's of the devil. &gt;&gt; Here he said down there in that quote, he said, "I heard Jesus say, whosoever will, let him come." They were jealous because that man that this man was getting the job done and they couldn't do it. That's greater in Solomon. Next one. He said, "You'll see that it was a little pretty jealousy in these disciples and they were in the men then and they were still men today." And it's still in the men today. That's right. Because the men are getting the job done. And many times you find people that are getting the job done and they don't belong to our ranks. Uh &gt;&gt; oh. &gt;&gt; And we want to to fly up about it, but it's just the same element if it was in the church of the 12 disciples that walked with Jesus. It abounds bound to be in this one and all the rest of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so you brethren, we are here representing the Lord Jesus Christ in his resurrection. And we pray that we'll fellowship around the word with us. And we shall pray for just a moment. &gt;&gt; Another just some quotes. I want to just and I'm trying to get to a a point if it if we're still all right. Just here. He says he said here when brother Brown went behind the curtain of the time he said then a voice spiked to me and he said it's what you preach the Holy Ghost is it's perfect love and nothing can enter in there without it. &gt;&gt; Okay another one the same and it's just two on this. Thus sayaith the Lord. Now we know that's God. Thus sayaith the Lord. It'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was is perfect love. That's an adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all there was. &gt;&gt; It won't take a perfect theology. &gt;&gt; It'll take perfect love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect love comes from Jehovah, &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to just a we just go give me maybe 10 minutes or something. And he said that's the reason today that we're wondering and that's what's the matter. And I hate when he brother Brandham was in a different age. He said that's the matter with the message. Bick church he said Pentecostal church said it's because we've taken a different nature. &gt;&gt; It's a different nature. &gt;&gt; We've taken a different nature. We've taken on the nature that we want our rights and we're going to do that and we know that it's right to do it and we become arrogant. &gt;&gt; We become arrogant and we become hostile and we become indifferent. Let that little temper come in and let the selfishness come in. Amen. That's why message churches are not witnessing. They're not standing out in the streets. That's why they're not going to their neighbors and passing out saying, you know, Jesus is alive today and he's actually real and he did some great things for me today. Today. You know why I message people? Because you know why? Because they're arrogant. They're hostile and they're indifferent. And when you're arrogant and you're hostile and indifferent, you can't go to your neighbor's door and when they and they come out and they look different than what you expect them to look and you say, "Hey, God bless you today. I just brought you a package of bananas and I really hope you have a great day and it's not supposed to rain. &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't think that was God? Well, we haven't got to the one where God comes down from heaven and he separates the sheep and the goats. We haven't got to that scripture yet &gt;&gt; because most of the spirit around this is I got it. You don't got it. I'm better than you. I'm not worried about you. &gt;&gt; It's not the nature of God. &gt;&gt; There's people that are literally seriously deceived. You know, there's churches in this message believe that there's a zero grace outside of the message of the hour. Brother Brown never said that and the Bible definitely don't say it. So who are they following? They're not following Brother Brown and they're not following the Bible. &gt;&gt; This message is grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but but Jesus was grace when he hung on the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now now listen, I know where I'm standing &gt;&gt; because I've had six weeks to study this and I got the prophet and I I don't just got one. I didn't just cherry pick one. I probably have 20 or 30 more quotes to show you. &gt;&gt; He said, "And the lamb, when it comes time, he owns his own wool. That's his right. And his own he owns his wool, but he's taken the lamb and he throws them up on his buttocks and he ties his feet up and he never kicks and he never fusses. And you take the rights away from him because he's a lamb. He can't do nothing else because that's his nature. But one time, watch this. But one time, but one time, cross a Christian's path and you'll find out whether he's a lamb or a goat. Just tell them something that they don't like. You don't have to worry about what nature. It'll come out &gt;&gt; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. And you'll find out that when you cross them up one time, that's the reason today that our churches are in the condition that they're in. Now, this is thus saith the prophet. &gt;&gt; If we want to change, we have to change what he's preaching against here. And you'll call ourselves the lamb of God. Women and men together has to begin to act everything but lambs of God. Wow. God help us. &gt;&gt; There there's literally I'm telling you something. There's people that are deceived. You know that you know brother Bam, let me just show you something that was said. You know, Brother Bram, if you're eternal, you always were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? And and you can Google this. Eternity means you have no beginning and no end. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody is that that's &gt;&gt; I know that's that's that's science and that's the prophet. &gt;&gt; And yet I just heard a message somebody preached a message and he said some people are eternal life and some people will get eternal life. How can you get eternal life? &gt;&gt; You can't get eternal life. You either are eternal or you not eternal. Brother Ram said that we're justified as if we never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how can we bring somebody a minister from another country to preach in a church of 300 people and everybody go, "Yeah, [screaming] let's give them a love offering of three or 4 thousand." &gt;&gt; And he said, "When I was there, some are eternal life and some will become eternal life." &gt;&gt; That's not nothing. That ain't science. That ain't message. That's just stupidity. Because you can't tell. There could be a prostitute at the well that has eternal life. Oh, she don't look like she's got eternal life. But she's got the seed of God that will change her nature. And before that, she's supposed to go. You say, "Huh?" Do you remember how the people that Jesus went to? Rahab in the wall, the woman at the well, the woman caught in the very act. The woman that washed his feet was a sinful woman. But they got justified as if they never done it &gt;&gt; in the first place. &gt;&gt; Now that's the truth. &gt;&gt; But where' that other stuff come from? &gt;&gt; Where we at, Vicki? In other words, I think we're in another quote here, but in other words, the righteous in returning with Christ to the earth shall tread down the ashes. And when you see this, like the prophet said things that were just amazing. And when you see these people hotty, arrogant, and disle despiteable, snoody, and just claiming to be Christians, they ain't nothing but ashes. &gt;&gt; Wow. I wonder if Brother Brown did come back and was ministering, how many big message churches would invite him to preach? &gt;&gt; I can tell you ahead of time. That's all. That's all they are. That attitude. That's what the scriptures say. See, now watch. &gt;&gt; Now, see, it wasn't brother Brown. It ain't brother Dale preaching this. Your prophet preached this. &gt;&gt; You say you believe the prophet. That's what I believe, too. &gt;&gt; You know, people in this message, you know, it sister Margaret, this confuses me really. You know, there's a few things that confuse me is there's people that want to take every single word the prophet says and I say, "Okay, no problem. Let's take every word." And then when I bring up words like this, they go, "Well, we don't want to take that one." Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Like, we got to take the ones that were like anointed. And he said, "Thus say like just tell me what the rules are." Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the R but you're changing the rules when I find I had people that came and said everything the prophet said was anointed and divine to God. I and I just rattled off three or four quotes. &gt;&gt; They didn't stay around &gt;&gt; because they didn't believe what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; They said they did. But then when I told him what he said, like this quote, &gt;&gt; they decided to find a church that they never read the quotes. &gt;&gt; But see, I'm not my own boss. &gt;&gt; I'm just following instructions. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what I think I got my Okay, here we go. Yeah. John 21. We're going to my 10 minutes. I think I got a minute left. We're going to close here. If I just read a few scriptures and then we'll close. John 21:20 and 22. When Peter turning about, seeing the disciples whom Jesus loved, which [clears throat] also leaned on the breast at supper time, saith unto the Lord, what which is he that betrayeth thee? And Peter seeing him saith unto Jesus, Lord, what shall this man do? That sounds like something I would say. I've definitely said that in the past. &gt;&gt; What should they do? Listen how Jesus answered me. And Jesus said unto me, "If I will tarry, if if I will that he tar till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me? Why are you worrying about the people that aren't going to make it &gt;&gt; when you should just be worrying about if you're going to make it? &gt;&gt; What is that to thee? Just shut up and follow me. &gt;&gt; You're worrying about other people's business and it ain't none of your business. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus is telling them, "This is none of your business. &gt;&gt; It just just leave it on." And it went around. The disciples said, "Oh, this person was going to tarry until Jesus returned 2,000 years later." No, Jesus never said that. He said, "You're worrying about something that you don't have nothing, no business to worry about." &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 13:12, I'm trying to hurry. And for now, we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now we see in part, but then shall we be known as also I am known. Now, now, now that is a paradox because I believe that the message revealed the seals and took the mysteries out of the Bible and all of that, but we even have quotes that the prophet said. He said, "Even your understanding and revelation of the message when you get there could be slightly different &gt;&gt; than what you believed." &gt;&gt; Amen. What this scripture is really saying is you think you have everything figured out perfectly. &gt;&gt; And yes, we do have the mysteries revealed, but I still don't have everything figured out perfectly. &gt;&gt; My my threeb brain or 4 pound brain or 10 pound brain or no brain at all couldn't comprehend God. &gt;&gt; Just let it go. you we you know like you know there's message believers that they would be better to keep their mouth shut and and keep the doubt whether they were dumb or not but instead you open your mouth and you remove all doubt &gt;&gt; you open your mouth and you just show where'd that come from &gt;&gt; didn't come from God &gt;&gt; Romans 12 I just got to get to Revelation so I Three scriptures here. Romans 12:3-5. For I say though, through the grace that was given unto me, that every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think. Wait a minute. But I'm a message believer. I'm a minister of a message believer. &gt;&gt; They didn't read this scripture. not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think soberly according as God hath dealt every man a measure of faith. Because somebody has more faith in you or less faith in you, let God just be Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You're definitely not the God. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we being many are one body in Christ, and every member one of another. Luke [clears throat] 12:47 Luke 12:47. And that servant which knew his lord's will prepared not himself, neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, these are the people that live in the 52 countries that they're not allowed to have a Bible. But he that knew not did not commit things worthy of stripes. Poor saying, "Ah, they can't go. They can't go cuz they don't know what I know." Huh? I got Bible that tells you wrong. &gt;&gt; Did not commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with very few stripes. &gt;&gt; For unto whomsoever much is given to him shall much be required, and to whom men have committed much, to him they will ask the more. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God help me for what we know and and and see. My last scripture and we'll we'll close on this. Amen. Revelation 7 9. Most I just just for next week I mean if any of you show up just by per chance anybody would show up. Most of my quotes of things that I stated and that of the prophet are still in my iPad. And if anybody wants any quotes or scriptures, I'll send them to you with flashing lights because there not one thing I've read here that isn't right in the message or the Bible. Revelations 7 and 9. And after this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number of all nations. and kindreds and people and tongue &gt;&gt; stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed in white robes and their and psalms in their hands. There will be Christians [snorts] and people come out from every nation, every kindred and every tongue. &gt;&gt; Do you know that this message is not even interpreted in every &gt;&gt; dialect &gt;&gt; in the world? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, how could a message believer that's born a minister in the States or Canada or Europe say, "Well, they can't go because they don't know his name, &gt;&gt; and it ain't even in every dialect of every language." &gt;&gt; I tell you, that spirit's wrong. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you who's going to be there. I'm closing. You can come, honey. I'm closing. I'm not trying to take away from anything that we know is truth. Not at all. &gt;&gt; But the ones that'll be in heaven and the ones that'll go in the rapture will be the seed of God that have the nature of Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God has given us abundantly more than than I deserve to give us a beautiful message in my natural language tongue, English, and North America. And we will be held accountable. Oh, wow. And 52 countries can't carry a New Testament Bible. Have no outside internet. Most of those countries have no news broadcasts unless the government is the news. God tells you this morning. I believe God tells you this morning. We need to come off our high horse. &gt;&gt; We need to come down off our high horse and pray like never before people less less blessed than you and me. I don't know what God will do with all this stuff. I don't know. And yes, the message is true, but he's gave us an unbelievable amount of revelation and knowledge &gt;&gt; that most of the world does not even have. &gt;&gt; Doesn't even have. Brother Bram said things like this. He said, "When I go to those countries," he said, "they deserve to live the same as I do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they haven't got what you got. and the last person in the world's going to stand up and say, "Well, I'm better than them." &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be this person. So, if you don't like that kind of preaching, you're in the wrong church &gt;&gt; because I deserve hell &gt;&gt; if it wasn't for grace. &gt;&gt; I deserve to be lost. Amen. But God help us. Sometimes we we get this and then we get this spirit on us &gt;&gt; that somehow we came to God on our own. Somehow we realized this message on our own. Somehow we figured it out on our own. Wrong seed, wrong nature. Amen. God help us. God help me. God help me. God help me. Amazing grace. Wow. Amen. I'm I'm sorry. Wow. I had other messages that are far sweeter to preach than that. &gt;&gt; But I got my orders. &gt;&gt; Part two will be next Sunday. And hopefully we can change the subject soon as God will let us. Amen. God I you know we're at the end times church &gt;&gt; and we need to check our nature. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to what I say. Brother Bram said all kinds of things. Don't live me a sermon. Like, don't preach me a sermon. Live me a sermon. Look at my nature. Look where I'm trying to do for the kingdom. He said things. Look at their spirit. What are they trying to achieve? Am I building a kingdom to myself? Well, run for your life. &gt;&gt; But are we trying to build the kingdom of God? Maybe you need to reconsider. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. God help us to build his. It's all about Jesus Christ. all about Jesus Christ. I'm I I will leave this with you. I will leave this with you. You're going to be surprised what your prophet says about this. I didn't I never touched the snow on the capstone of the iceberg of what the prophet said in your message. Even in the seventh seal and even in 64, what he talked about this spirit that's in the message It stinks. It stinks when you get so you can recognize the people in the street [music] as children of God and try to go share the love of God to them. You're getting on the right nature. &gt;&gt; You're getting on the right path. Amen. Let me maybe I just say this. Brother Bram said this is the nature of God. He said, "If I seen you riding in a boat going to Nagger Falls and I was losing my mind on shore, it's not because I don't like you, cuz I know you're going to die when you go over the falls [music] because your boat can't survive the fall." And so when you see message believers that do nothing for the kingdom of God, yeah, I'm going to repeat that again. [music] do nothing for the kingdom of God, including sharing the love of God, and you're letting people go over the false. It's a different nature. It's a different nature. It's a different nature. The nature will never lie. Every seed will bring forth the nature of its kind. I I got to stop. God help me. Let me be pleasing [music and singing] to you. Praise [music] [music] every [music] heart to [music] you. Heat. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; you [music] Jesus one more Jesus. [music] [music] You [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Great. [music] [music] Lord God, I believe that's a prayer that everyone represents here. [music] Lord, I pray that you'll take them all. I don't mean that this spirit is just in [music] our ranks here. And and I don't believe it is for the most part at all, but in the world fellowship that we fellowship around, Lord God, [music] help us Jesus to have the real nature of Christ. It's a sacrificial lamb. Lord God, I pray you'll bless a small gathering here this morning. [music] And Lord, may they not take it I wasn't preaching just to them, but it's just the atmosphere around us. Don't take it personal. If if if it's something God needs to deal with us, help me, Jesus. But this is this [music] spirit is everywhere. Help us Jesus. [music] Lord, we know that you promised in the Bible that all that the father had given you in your hand that none would be lost. [music] That's what we claim cling to, Lord God. We know that [music] he put us in your hand. It's impossible for you to lose us. Help me, Jesus. Bless your people in a special way in our fellowship after. In your name we pray. [music] Amen. God bless you.
