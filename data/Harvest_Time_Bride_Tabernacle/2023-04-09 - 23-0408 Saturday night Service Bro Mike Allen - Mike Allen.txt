you come you would use us mightily father Lord take these lips of clay and speak your word father in Jesus Christ then we pray amen you all may be seated I don't know if it's possible to get some water I get real dry when I start talking but anyways the trial of your faith and I was thinking I was going to speak on um forget the title my title there basically it was what I was going to speak on originally and maybe we'll end up going there who knows I'm just going to talk right now and what I was going to speak on was I was I had taken a subject where where the disciples in Jesus had been out and had been amongst a great a great Revival they had a great revival going on people were being healed they were out and they were going from town to town and people were being healed people were being saved people were coming to Christ and all that and then they went out for a time of rest onto a boat and they were just out there relaxing it and all of a sudden this great wave and this great wind came up that they were so much so that they were in Jeopardy that their lives were in Jeopardy that they were about to lose their lives and what they were done they had been and and Revival and everything had been going great and the word had been going great in their life and and they had been they'd seen great Miracles and had great things going on and they had great expectations of things to come and the next thing they know they found themselves in Peril they found themselves in the middle of a sea that was rough they found themselves in the middle of a trial that was rough they found themselves in a place where they were about to drown where they were about to go under when they had lost sight of the Lord they had lost sight of who he was they had lost sight of everything in their life they had lost side of everything that they had heard it's Satan had brought a great trial upon their lives and they were about to drown and they were in great Jeopardy in this last 2020 let me say this before I forget bring greetings from True Word Tabernacle in Bluffton Ohio and the Saints there and our pastor brother Wayne Lawson and our senior pastor Brother Ray Erickson were in the midst of a transition between the I don't know how to say it Brother Ray founded the church and and he was he's been the pastor and he's 84 years old so he's wanting to slow down not quit but just slow down the other church has asked him to come and evangelist to their Church and uh just kind of a joke there because as a pastor he never traveled out much there for so many years and they had him down to minister and they're like why don't you become an evangelist now but no we're we're happy to have brother Wayne as our uh Pastor now and we're we're starting to see more of him he's coming off the field and becoming stepping into that role as pastor and and uh but this weekend he's in Switzerland preaching meetings so uh most of our ministers are out somewhere I'm up here we got some in the South we got a brother in London as in London England and uh so we're growing but last year was a it started out really good and strong and powerful we're coming out of you know all the covert restrictions and all that but in about June we I went with a brother down he was preaching down in Dayton and I went down there and on the way back I got some of the some news I didn't like to hear we had a young couple this an awesome young couple in our Charlie and Rachel and and got news that they were in their house and the house blew up they had been married for about about to celebrate their second anniversary I think it was and find out they think she might have been pregnant and they had their whole lives ahead of them very well liked couple in the church all sudden they're gone but they were ready to go and then a month later we were at a wedding and this is the brother that brother Tom Sproles and sister Sharon Sproles they've become dear friends of ours and and uh they uh they we had a wedding at our church on a Sunday after service and on the way home their son give you some background their son had been away from the Lord their oldest son and him and his wife and his girls and boys so they have three girls and one boy and they were on their they'd just come back into church and I think was it that Sunday that she got up and testified that they were back and more than one before or something like that but they would come and I remember I'd met him we went to up to their house for Fourth of July picnic and and I had met her son for the first time there was a little bit younger than me his dad's a little bit older with me I think you and Tom are about the same age brother Dale and uh actually time I think's a little bit older but um we have become part of the Met his son and I remember I was and his son wasn't really coming to church at the time and and this this has nothing to do with me this is what I was told this is a testimony given to me but I want it to be a testimony that you guys could take home because you're more important than you think you are your witness is more important than you think you are and we hit it kind of off because we we're out alike and a lot of the stuff that he likes Hunting Fishing and all that kind of stuff and more of a hillbilly type guy and I enjoyed it but to me I wanted to be enlightened with us because I want to see him back in church and I remember I found out he worked at the AutoZone in Bryan Ohio and I just happened my second home was up in that area because of work I spent a lot of time up in northwest Ohio so I was like well I'm just going to start stopping in I'll say hi let him know that somebody at church is actually interested him and all that and and so I I decided I'd stop by and say hi to him and and just just say hey not not even didn't talk anything there and it's like I just want to stop in and say hi and all that and I find out later that's so impressed him that somebody would take their time to stop by his work to say hi and I remember when they started coming back to church it come a few Sundays and and uh remember he's like I was about to leave but I had to go say hi go shake the guy the guy that would stop and say hi to me and then we come up so we lost the two young the young couple there and beginning of June then come around June 30th on the way home from uh the wedding they're in one he's in a vehicle with his it's him his daughter middle daughter and his wife and then the back is his oldest daughter and his son and the youngest daughter and they're driving along and then Tom and Sharon and behind them they live about an hour a little bit over an hour away from church so they left the service a little bit early so on the way up a drunk driver swerves in their Lane loses troll flips over truck lands perfectly on top of him kills him instantly and uh we were at the wedding we get I get word and I'm like I've got to go to this go there and this is where I found when you look at a minister especially a pastor and this is to help you understand what a pastor goes through they're the ones that are getting the calls at four in the morning there's been an accident they're the ones going up to a hospital room and I went to the hospital room I sat with an eight-year-old boy who kept asking me or telling me I wonder how my dad's doing I wonder how this is going on I wonder how this is going on and I know I already knew his dad's gone I said and you're sitting there with an eight-year-old boy and I we had sent our two daughters went with some friends I mean instantly we're like figure out and they ended up spending a night at these friends and all that and and so we're up there until about two I think we got home to 2 33 in the morning something like that and you know the next morning I wanted to before I went to work I went it makes you appreciate your family and then remember your pastor here everybody relies on him when there's a hard time when there's sickness when there's some kind of trial going on just lift him up in prayer I got to see firsthand what it was like until what it was like to be in that position I'd never experienced that before administered many times but I've never stepped into that side of the ministry and that side of the ministry is actually more prevalent than the preaching because it's an everyday Ministry preachings once twice three to four times a week maybe but that's an offshoot but this is this family here brother Thomas this is Sharon said they did that and then probably going to miss then they've had some other family member members that have come and passed their daughter-in-law is pretty much walked away from the message now she was all in it she's the one that stood up and friend of the church and testified we're back and she's gone trying to pull the kids away and trying to keep them from the grandparents so they're going through a whole lot just found out his mom has colon cancer she's up for surgery here Monday and it's just like boom boom boom boom but he's also the one that when he was standing out there brother his cousin Taz when he showed up at the accident scene he looked over and there was a double rainbow and an eagle right in the middle of it you got that picture and he was showing it to Tom and Tom described it he said it was like something just come flying right right into his chest and that's when he knew that he knew that he knew him that he had the Holy Spirit I would turn around and baptize 10 people like a week or two later that whole family it was a privilege and we're believing the grandkids will be safe even though I don't know what to say about the daughter-in-law and it's a lot of stress and all that I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she's not there mentally and all that but we're getting ready to come up here and I said this Wednesday but Monday the Monday before the leave on Wednesday because some are here and I'd like to see faces I don't recognize but God bless you all it's good to see you but anyways so we're getting ready to leave and Sonya's like the car made some kind of clunk and I was like that'd be nothing and it's a Tuesday I got home from work and and I'm trying to catch things up at work and I'm getting home late and and this and all right or as Monday I did that and yeah it was Monday and I come home and I took it over to work because we have nice big parking lots she said when you make a sharp right turn at clunks and I'm going around circles next thing I know I lose all my power steering and our only other vehicle that's roadworthy is only holds three people comfortably and I wouldn't trust it to come to Canada so we're like we still want to go and we're wondering what to do and and the next morning Sonia gets a text have Mike call Tom immediately oh another thing that happened to that family before I get into that so I get a call one day one of their another granddaughter from another side of the family was hit by a semi truck run over semi truck was making a turn didn't see the kids standing there she's 15. back wheels he got out and it was still sitting on her she's alive she's got a lot of physical therapy ahead of her so they're just one thing after another after another after another but you know Tom's kept a positive attitude and what Satan's thought for evil is actually drawing him closer to the Lord his walk has changed he's at peace he finally got a piece because he was just so torn up or losing his best friend his son now he's in one service a few weeks ago I wasn't there but through the ministry and all that a piece like the past that's all understandings come into it and so here we come and amidst all that he hears about her car and he's like I ain't going to let Satan get one up on that he goes you want our truck take it so I drove the hour and something to his house and picked up his truck and all that and and you know Satan he doesn't like when you or him helping the ministry or helping the bride and all that so we get a call on our way up hey a tree fell in our house crushed back side of their house but you know what he still just ready to give Satan a black guy and he's not going to playing but he asked me to give you all that testimony and and I thought it would be beneficial because a lot of times we think that we've gone through a whole lot of Trials we've gone through a whole lot of hard trials and all that but there's always somebody that's going through something worse than we are and his attitude through this whole thing he's never cursed God foolishly remember in job when job was going through all those trials his wife said why don't you curse God and die and he said oh thou speakest as a foolish woman she wasn't a foolish woman because you know what and that's what our subject matters will be here shortly she was a part of job so she couldn't be a fool she couldn't be cast off because the fool was cast off but why speakers there was a foolish woman and job never cursed God amongst you think Joe boss's children he lost his animals he lost his houses he lost his land he just saw so much and all that but God gave him back double even eight more kids on this side eight on that side double if they'd give him double here that would have been what quadruple triple but anyways all that to say that God is good and when you're in the midst of a trial count it all joy and that and the uh I cherish your kids cherish your family cherish cherish one another in the in the body you're not guaranteed tomorrow you're not guaranteed that after you walk out of here you'll be here tomorrow morning for service and I remember thinking I wanted to go see my kids that was one of the toughest things I've ever done be up there in the hospital but I kind of did privilege I was able to go and minister to the body to minister to to a family that that needed help at that time and I would have done it as a friend or I didn't do it just because I'm a minister but and you Minister one to another one to another and we're gonna go over here to Mark chapter four I'll give you the the the chapter this time I was told that I didn't we're gonna pick up where I left off Wednesday and I'll do some review for those of you who aren't Wednesday and just kind of a I was going to go into the subject matter Overcoming By he who was in you a reality amongst chaos that's where some of what I just talked came out of and actually it's going to be Mark chapter five I brought up the wrong notes there Mark chapter 5 verse 35 and I guess I ought to get there too if I'm going to read it actually I think and we'll start at verse 35. while he gets fake they're they're came from the Roar of the synagogue's house certain which said thy daughter is dead why trouble style the master any further and as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe there we see Be not Afraid only believe we were talking about that and I know you all don't mind if I take this off I feel a little constricted in it sometimes then it gets hot be not afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him say Peter and James and John the brother of James remember he was putting out all unbelief when they got there they ridiculed him because he said she wasn't dead and he came to the house of the ruler of synagogue and he seeth the tumult and then that wept and wailed greatly and when he was coming he says and then why Makia it's a do and Weep the damsel's not dead but Sleepless why make you do and Weep the bride's Not Dead she never was dead it might look like she fell asleep at a for a period of time it might look like Satan put up that last nail in the coffin for a period of time when everybody's making fun of her when everybody's ridiculing her when everything's coming against her it might look like she's on her last breath about to go into the ground and about to die but he says why weep thou because she's not dead she may just be asleep but she's going to rise and they laughed him to scorn but he had put them all out and he take the father and the mother into dams on them that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha Kumai which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel Rose and walked for she was for she was of the age of 12 years and they were astonished with great astonishment you know in this last stage the bride is going to rise it says and Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 it says arise and shine for thy light has come and in this last stage the bride has to come and she has to ride and she has to shine and the world's going to be astonished that God is still alive and that he's still moving and that he's still working through flesh today because the denominations are dead people in the message are dead they've did away with the power of God and they've walked into their own thoughts and they've walked into their own ways and they've created this these programs and everything that have no life to them and people around this world they did not see much life in the name of Christianity today because of what the denominations have done and even in the message of the hour today they so polluted it they've so sad to where they've got their eyes on a man they've got their eyes on a man and the bride and instead of the bride and instead of the word that was come forth they're so fixated on the prophet that they forget that the word is still moving and it's still going forth and it's still going in power and it's still got a message to it and it's still going to be going into flesh that flesh it was in the prophet we're not doing away with the Prophet The Prophet is important the prophet is needful he brought a message to us this day he brought us a message so that we could live so that we can have power so that we can walk in the Name of Christ so that we can be his embodiment on Earth so that we could be the bride of Christ he came and he gave us a message he gave us all that we ever needed so that we could step into that role in this last day to be the final voice to the final wage there's got to be a final voice to an age that's going to be the last age there's got to be a voice that's alive if you ever heard a dead corpse speak I have never heard a corpse speak in my entire life I've been to a lot of funerals and they lay there so there's got to be a living breathing Christ on Earth today it's got to be something that you can see it's got to be something that you could touch it's got to be something that you can feel it's got to be something that you can see Christ manifested through a final voice to the final age and we're coming up to a final wage darkness is all around us the world is falling apart people are walking away from the word of God they're going to strange Gods they're going to strange religions they're going to dead religious they're going to just just just listening to a voice on a tape not the fresh kill that comes from the fivefold ministry then they want to take the guy that was flesh they want to make him infallible and say that everything he said and everything that he'd done was perfect I'm here to tell you he was not perfect there was no Prophet ever perfect Abraham lied David committed adultery Paul persecuted the Christians and if you remember Wednesday we were going through Esther and we came up to vashti and vashti just for review and I'm just gonna instead of reading it I'm just going to tell you what it is just bring everybody up to speed here so remember the king is that King Xerxes was having a big feast and and he was making everything that he loved and everything that he'd done known he was showing all his riches he was showing all his glory it was showing all his Beauty he was showing everything and it came down to where he had one more thing he wanted to show the world one more thing everything else was out in the open everything else everybody could see they could see the big castles they could see the signs they could see the Miracles they could see the tongues they could see the interpretation they could see all the beauty of Christ in that manifestation but there was still one mystery it had not come out yet there was still one mystery that had not been shown and that was what was inside of him the whole time you go back to Adam and Eve in the garden when Adam was created he was one there was two beings inside of him and nobody could see the beauty of the mystery that laid aside him until Christ until the Lord took it took Eve out of her and made two bodies so here we are we see xers he's having a big feast and all that and he's standing there and he's in plain view Christ has been in plain view for years Christ came in playing views at the beginning when he stepped up to the cross and when he died and he gave himself and that beauty in that love but it's not even was a mystery inside of it was a bride and she was hidden away in him until the last age all the church ages all the messengers came so that she could be presented to him so that he could present her to the world those nurses is here he sends vashti the queen he sends her seven Church ages he sends her seven Church Messengers and when those seven Church messages and that said wasn't showed up she refused to come forth she didn't care about him she didn't care about being part of Christ all she cared about was the glory all she cared about was the signs and the waters and Sam and the message it's saying I have a prophet that's all they were worried about the message has stepped forth out of the prophet and stepped forth into the bride she is the message today she is the final voice to this last stage and there's nothing Satan can do about it but you look at vashti he sent her seven Messengers to bring her forth to put her on display but she said I'm above being on display I'm above being Christ 's display and above showing Christ in my life but she wanted the riches she wanted the tongues and interpretation she wanted the Miracles she wanted all the benefits of living in Christ comes how many times in our own lives we want all the benefits of living with her Christ we want eternal life we want all that we want the healings we honor that but when it comes to living a life and showing it manifesting it we stopped there A lot of times because we're embarrassed because we're we're embarrassed of our groom because we were a little bit different it'll make us different than everybody around us it'll put us on its display and we'll become a peculiar person he said we are peculiar people he said we are peculiar people I want to be peculiar I don't care what this world says I don't care what they say but I want to be on display for Christ because it's not me that I want to show it's him it's what's behind me it's what's living through me that I know what's been shown in this world oh I can go show my calendar all the time but you know what they're going to see they're going to see faults they're going to send failures they're going to see per a person who gets upset they're going to be the same person against the Press they're going to see a person against anxiety they're going to see a person against afraid but if I show Christ here's none of those I'll have a boldness that I can step in the face of Satan and I can say is thus saith the Lord said you get behind me I have no fear I have no anxiety I have no depression I have no kids I have no high blood pressure it's got to go in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ story what are you doing with Christ in your life are you let him hiding back here because you're afraid of him because you don't want to be a computer person because you don't want to stand out I'm sorry live for Christ you're going to stand out if you're going to live for Christ and his Christ his life shines through you you're not going to be able to take homosexuality you're not going to be able to take transitionalism you're not going to take all the religions come into one you're not going to be able to take all the part in so vashti refused the seven churches vastly refused the seven Church Messengers vastly refused the Malachi 4 5 6 and 7 message that would take her vashti had she came forth she would have had up to half of the Kingdom in equality with Christ 50 50 proposition when you read we'll read here and ask her a little bit he said Esther what would you need up to half of my kingdom half 50 50. she is him she is him so she was cast out if you don't receive the message of the hour guess what you're going to be cast out and there went forth a decree to bring in all the virgins so they went out and they found all the virgins but they found one that was a gentile bride the marriage of the Lamb it says and that we know that there is going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as to be that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material in Earth now to make themselves ready it's not a future tense it's not a past tense it's not some way way out there but now she has the material what is the material it's the word of God Through the Bible and through the message of the hour you have everything you need in those 1100 and some 1200 whatever it is messages everything you need to be materialized as the bride to step forth and take your place and shine the rise shine For Your Glory has come that was the title this message let's go to Esther chapter 4. 14. the title that I had was bride you are made for this time bride you are made for this time in 4 14 it says let's go to verse 12 and so Mordecai was I'll give you some background so Mordecai was told that there was a law gonna coming out that's going to put all the Jews death and all that and so he's going to Esther who's now the queen and and Mordecai commanded to answer to Esther think not with thyself that thou will shalt Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for thou altogether Hold Us thy peace at this time then shall the enlargement then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy fathers thou shall be destroyed and who kneareth whether Thou Art come for to the kingdom for such a time as this right I say it's no longer a question who knows whether you might be it's not a question it might be it's not a question of maybe so but you have come to this time this is the end time we are looking at end time days we're looking at Russia's trembling we're looking at the United States to trim we're looking at all the nations they're trembling they don't know what's going on we're looking at economic downturns we're looking at at uh everything that's saying you throw into this world is more immortality and all that has come upon the Earth it is Blackness it is Darkness that's where we're at today but before this day is over there has to be a light that shines and who is that light it is the bride of Christ she will step forth and Shine the beauty of the king she will step forth in the power of the king and if you remember when we went we'll go back to chapter two here and we're just going to go through this part quickly here so they sent out the decree for all the all the virgins to come forth and here they are and and so it came to pass with the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together into shushan the palace to the custody of haggai that has that Esther was brought also into the King's house to the custody of haggai the keeper now who was Esther in marriage of the lamb in 62 it says it pleased the king it's uh paragraph 156 it please the king so he sent and he sent out the chamber maids and so forth that went out to pick all the young virgins that he could that could the beautiful women throughout all the kingdoms and the provinces that he was over which was the greatest in the world who's what's the greatest Kingdom in the world right now it's God God's Canaan the kingdom of God the greatest Kingdom of all the world this is perfect types and when he did it came to this little Jewish girl and she was rather kind of an off cast because like the Gentiles are seeing she was cast off to one side and she had no father and mother and Mordecai her uncle was Raising her and she had to go to qualify so when the Jews rejected Christ when they rejected the Son of God the Gentiles had to go to qualify and it was malting virgins that came forth to qualified and then so Esther was brought also into the King's house to the custody of haggai Keeper of the women and the Maiden pleased him and she attained kindness of him and brother Brandon's message remember the first pull in the second poll were to the denominations they were the signs and wonders all that but when it came to the third pool only one caught his favor only one caught his eyes only one found favor in the in the prophet's message and that was the bride of Christ the true bride so the bride found excellent favor more favor than the rest of the virgins and the Maiden Police them she attained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for her purification with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens seven Church ages the churches and females he gave her seven Church ages to reveal the mysteries of God throughout all the ages he couldn't just give her one Maiden because she can't just live on the first church age she couldn't give give her three because she couldn't live in three but she had to have all seven to take a rapture to take a body change she has to have all seven Church ages in order to step into the Fulfillment and the completeness of Christ's bride there were different parts of the Bride came out through all those ages but in the end time they all culminated they create one multi-member body he gave into her seven maidens which were meat to be given to her out of the King's house and they preferred her and her maidens are to the best place of the House of the women and Esther had not showed her her people nor Kindred for Mordecai and charged her that she should not show it and Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her now when every maiden's turn was come to go into the king of hasawaris or Xerxes after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of women where so the days of her purification were accomplished in what six months of more oil myrrh and six months sweet odors and other things of the purifying of the women and thus came every Maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women and to the King's house so when these versions were brought to go call to go forth they were given free moral agency they were given a choice to go in with what the king provided by his messenger or they she was given the choice to add to it or take away from it the denominations and even the denominations within the message are given the exact same choice to take away or give it's up to her and you know like the denominations they they love the signs and water wonders but some of them didn't think they were good enough that they needed to add Beauty to them they needed to add great buildings they needed that great the great programs and they said this word of God off to the side and they focus so much on the outward Beauty instead of the inward Beauty that when they were presented before the king he sent her off to the concubine home of the concubines and even in the message they were presented with the full word but they're not going on forth with the word they stopped when the messenger passed away and they denominated around him and they've denominated around all we need is the tapes there's nothing new to come forth though brother Branham would stand there and tell them take everything I said back to the word of God take it back and he would also tell him when he was asked the one time are you the only one to preach well whoever told you that whoever gave you that idea where did that come from they stopped right there they look at try not to be a reverend I'm not putting the profit down I'm walking on eggshells I feel like right now because it's a new territory for me they they look to a dead man as their pastor who can't be in the hospital rooms like I was like my pastor came up who can't sit there and give counseling to a wife whose husband's leaving the message or to a husband whose wife is questioning the message or to a teenager who's questioning the message or to a teenager that's looking for a life that's present tense living instead they are looking at people that are well listen to this this day and they're they're instead of having inspiration not saying that God can't if you're in a situation where you're not even close to a church and there's no way for you to be close to the church or anything like that and you've got some messages he can inspire you to choose the right message and all that but when you are denominated around just choosing a tape and all that there is very little chance for inspiration there a fresh kill inspiration whereas I've been in behind the pulpit and called something out before right in the middle of it then in the Pulpit but somebody was struggling something I said something they come up to me afterwards and say I was struggling with that and I go that was not in my notes I had no intentions of saying that how many times you heard a minister preaching and all of a sudden they start going off on a little Rabbit Trail you ever think that that little Rabbit Trail is because somebody's got a question because somebody out there has got a you got a a thought or a wrong way or something like that so when when these virgins came up they looked at themselves and some of them say oh I'm not good enough I'm not good enough I'm not good enough instead of looking well the king gave me what it takes to make me good enough and all I have to do is step into what his messenger told me all I have to do is take on Revelations 10 7. all I have to do is accept Malachi 4 5 and 6. all I have to do is look at the message and it told me I needed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if I look into the message it tells me that there's one God and and so forth and so on and all the Mysteries that he gave us instead of doing that they start looking at themselves or they start or they or they look back at the First Church Catholic the Catholic church and the beauty and glamor and all that and they start well we'll start patterning after Mother Harley we'll start patterning we'll paint our face up just a little bit like hers and and we'll we'll build big towers over here and and we'll we'll have these big programs over here and and they get so far away from the actual word of God that they refuse the beauty of Christ and they've turned down bright ship so you see they had free moral agency and then this came every Maiden unto the king whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the King's house and in the evening she she went and on tomorrow she returned to the second house of the women to the custody of the shahz guys the king's Chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except for the king delighted in her and that she were called by name there's many times that he uses the nomination there will be many times that he'll use a tape Ministry there have been many times that it will use different ones that that have even backslidden to bring somebody that's about to backslide or somebody has already backslot and whether they come back or not but bring them forth and bring them into the presence of God again so she wasn't of no use anymore I would say the denominations are of no use anymore God still accomplishes great humanitarian Works through them God still accomplishes bringing stray bride in from there so God still uses them it's like that illustration I said Wednesday you have a pocket full of change you have some pennies you have some quarters you have some nickels you have some dimes then you have a silver dollar well the silver dollar is the full package the others still have value and you can even say it this way and even in the bride itself maybe you consider yourself a penny and you're just a widow woman that sits in there and you pray for somebody and you look at the pastor as The Silver Dollar and in between you see all the different gifts and you say deacons and all that you know what you're still part of that silver dollar it still takes you to make up that silver dollar it still takes your gift in the body whether you're a penny whether you're a half a cent whether you're dented whether you're scratched whatever it is whether you're a piece of corner off a dollar bill it still takes you to make that hole so you have value no matter what your position is in the church if you're looking at something oh I wish I could sing like that and I wish I could do this get that nonsense out of your mind you were called to sing like that you be you you stay in your position they'll stay in their position and we'll make up that full dollar that silver dollar and will shine as a church will shine as a body and we'll step forward and we'll be that bride that will shine in this last stage stop looking at one another stop getting your eyes off of Christ and look at Christ full-fast look in his glory don't consider yourself don't consider your position maybe all you do is sit in the church pew but you sing you pull on the word of God you don't have a Ministry per se all of us have a Ministry all of us have to be where we are in the body of Christ I can't be Dale langstaff as a pastor I can't be Jared it's only here that's not me I can't be the singer that my wife is and she'll testify to that I can't be Luanne Carpenter I can't be Felix salad it's not my calling my calling is to be Mike Allen believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and to go forth wherever he should call me whether it be to Wyoming to harvest bright Tabernacle or whether it be to little Bethlehem down in Hamilton Ohio the Church of about 10 15 20. or B to some great big African congregation someday we still we'll get there one day but I can't pastor this church because it's not my call and furthermore nothing against you it's not in my heart to be your pastor it's just just examples and it's not my heart to be the pastor of true or Tabernacle where I sit under a wonderful pastor because it's not where the Lord's kept me and it's not my desire to be a great singer either well I would like to be a great singer but not necessarily a song later so here we have now when it now when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abigail and I'm sorry for all you that were here Wednesday I'm repeating a lot but but I know brother Dale's enjoyed it so much that the Lord dissoluted on my heart that I I do have more to go into but I'm bringing everybody else to speed but more is coming out than I didn't say Wednesday either so praise the Lord now with the turn investor the daughter of Abigail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but wahagai well her seventh age messenger what our Prophet gave us she required nothing but what the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the woman appointed we don't have to have an eighth day messenger we're not looking for another Prophet to come on the scene to fulfill what the prophet's already fulfilled to finish this work we're not we're not waiting for a return Ministry of the Prophet the return Ministry is the bride of Christ if you want to say there's a return Ministry the ministry is carrying on through the bride of Christ it has now stepped into her and now it's her turn to shine it's her turn to bring forth the word to the world let's go over to Revelations chapter 10 verse 8. and it's beautiful over here yeah I mean it's just beautiful you know in chapter 10 verse 7 that's our Messenger right there but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared unto his servants and Prophets that's our messenger's message right there 10-7 but you know what at 10 8 it goes on and it leaves the messenger and it's all of a sudden it's addressed to John and who is John the type of John's the type of the Bride she he is the bride's type and it goes on and it says in the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me and said go and take the little book that is opened in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth go and take the message of the hour go and take the word of God go and take your Bible go and take this message at the seventh angel in verse 7 brought and you eat it and you become one with it yes it's going to be bitter in your belly because it's going to create change in your life it's going to make you stand out to all those that around you and it's going to create some hard times and it's going to create some some times that are going to be questionable and you're going to be ridiculed you're going to be made fun of because you're falling after a 17 messenger and you're walking into his glory and all that and you know what you've got to take it you've got to eat it you've got to partake of it you have to be the one that takes a hold of it John had no choice here and if John's the bride we have no choice if we don't take the full message of the hour and take it and become one of it one with it then God has no part of us it's just like communion that we're going to do tonight if we don't partake of communion he said who you have no pardon me if you don't partake of foot washing you have no part in me this is communion right here this is you right here this is what you were to become this is what you are to be you step into it and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoken to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and I said unto him give me the little book give me the message of the hour give me the tapes give me the books give me the bible let me devour it let me take it in I don't care anymore I want to be one with Christ I want to be just like him I want him and me dwelling in me living through me and if I don't eat him how can he do it and I went unto the angel and said unto them give me that little book and he said unto me take and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in the mouth sweet as honey and I took that little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it and my belly was bitter well it created a change in him oh it was wonderful you remember when you first came to the message of the hour when you first got your Revelation oh it was beautiful and all that you thought the whole world knew about it and you all that and all of a sudden you found out you're just this little computer peculiar bird this little no-name this little saying that people make fun of you're you're nothing and if you really follow the truth in the message then you really become nothing if you follow the word as it's stated by the prophet and you don't denominate around the message and you don't take just the gifts and the healings and you don't take just the profit and denominate around a belt buckle and all that and the cowboy hat and say you're saved and all that but you step into the message fully you'll be made fun of even by message believers you'll be ridiculed even by message believers and that that's that's a better thing to take but you know what we're going to take it if you're the true bride you're going to take it you're going to step into it you're going on with it and you will love it there was a sweet side to it too there was a side that would give you rejoicing in your soul there was a giant sight that would give you Revival in your soul there was a side of the word that would give you all that and it would overcome that bitterness so that you would eat it and he said unto me this is the brain it's Commission this wasn't to brother Branham brother Branham was done in verse 7. brother random went off the scene in verse 7. because there was a revive a bright age to come there was an age that the bride had to step into to become the Fulfillment of the message of the hour to become one with him to become the one that he would put on display remember what I said Wednesday that that in the marriage no the groom's already standing at the front and he's in plain view and all sudden the music comes on everybody rides and they turn and they look back and there is his Beauty there's the secret that would have been hidden from all the ages there's his bride coming walking down the aisle coming in plain view coming that so she would shine to this world that she would be his representative that that she would be his completeness his fullness and he says and this is the bride and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings what's the bride to do to take the word and live it this isn't going out and saying I prophesy there's a tornado going to come into town it's going to take out this house of the times you guys be out of town or I prophesy you're going to get cancer and this and this and this and you do this and oh prophesy the word the Lord is coming the end is at nigh nigh it in your life on display you living the word walking talking living and Holiness and in righteousness taking on what does it say I wrote that down here in Galatians chapter 5 22 through 24 it says and this is I just kind of wrote this down here but you can go check it if you want if you don't believe me but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering this world doesn't have any long suffering anymore you cross me I'm going to kill you is what it is today you cross me I'm going to hit your head with a hammer or I'm going to get my gun out and I'm going to shoot you you come and you get in front of me you drive slow on the road and all that there is no long suffering today there's no love in this world today there's it's there's a there's a false love there's a mirage love you know they that's saying love is love that's a false love love is corrective if they really had loved they would go out and they would show them the word of God and say the lifestyle that you are living the way that you're living is a falsity and you're going to go to hell if you don't change and if you don't repent and back up love is love is not love it's a it's a mirage it's an illusion it's to help you it's the the satisfy your psyche to make you feel good to make you feel like you're some kind of a warrior or something like that because I got my love as love sign out there and I'm going to accept everything and everything but love is corrective why do we correct our children we don't want them to become bombs and all that we want them to respect authority we don't want to hear about them telling the police off or whatever and being shot and killed like they're doing the states these days we want to learn respect for the word of God we want to learn to sit still in church because it says be still and know that I am God that is absent from the world today it is my rights it's laodicea but the brides come out of laodice he and she's living in the bright age she's living in an age that the Satan can't touch she's living in a world that Satan can't touch he tries to touch her through the flesh he tries to touch her through mind battles he tries to get her down and all that but he cannot touch that Soul because she's already been raptured spiritually all we're waiting on is the natural change of the body but spiritually we're already resting spiritual era in Heavenly places spiritually earlier with Christ but the fruit of the spirit is love and joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no all and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts oh if you're still walking around baby in some kind of secret sin you're not you haven't fulfilled the law no Christ came to fulfill the law so that it could not touch us but when Christ lives in US we fulfill the law by living the works not that we're Saved By The Works but all of a sudden it becomes a desire it becomes a want it becomes I have to not because I'm afraid I'll go to hell because that was already settled from before the foundation of the world but I want to be pleasing I want to be that testimony I want to be I want to walk in full fellowship with the Lord I mean we can walk and have fellowship if we want to and still be saved but a true Christian has got the bad to the Holy Spirit once full fellowship and has to have full Fellowship the bride will have to have full Fellowship she has to walk in his glory she has to walk in his humbleness she has to walk in his strength and it won't be us doing the law and living it through us yes the flesh gets tempted As Romans chapter 7 the things that I would I do not the things that I do I would not and so forth and so on and he said I see two walls working in my flesh you know all the spirit and of all the soul they're always fighting which one are you feeding the most it's like that Indian guy he'd come up to that Indian Brotherhood given his heart to the Lord and he said how's it been since you started serving the lord and he said he says like two dogs inside fight one's white and one's black and he said well which one wins he goes whichever one I feed the most you ever get down and you ever get despaired and all that and and you notice you start feeding on easy things you might start watching more videos than you ever watched and you might start to watch start watching I'm just going to be real with you we're all the same we all have like passions and like desires and all that we might open up Facebook and spend hours and hours there we might open up YouTube and watch how-to videos for five hours long and not learn a single thing because it's easier than confronting our fears by the word of the lord it's easier than confronting our faults through the word of the lord it's easier because Satan's always there to tell you that you're no good he's always there to tell you that you won't amount to anything he's always there to tell you that you might as well give up you're lost in all that and we get down and we get in these pity parties and we start focusing more on natural things we started focusing more on the world than we do walking in the word so you must prophesy again and we see Esther here she required nothing but what the seventh messenger given she required nothing but the Lord had given her where is that in marriage of the lamb in 62 and verse to refuse the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king he took the word into our heart together before the king she took the word of the messenger in her heart to go before the king remember when she went before the king she went by herself when she went into the bridechamber the groom chamber the bridal chamber to consummate the marriage Peggy I didn't go in there with her Eliezer didn't go in that's God and his bride it was Isaac and Rebecca it was Esther and xers it is us and Christ our Prophet give us everything we need and the Lord had to take him off the scene so that the word message could be manifest through us and so that all he had to do is come tell us what God liked show us the Mysteries restores back to an Apostolic age and all that and tell us how to approach our King so that we would be accepted he introduced us to the groom then he steps back and it becomes a personal Revelation here and you think about the Rings the groom The Man Hands Up The Prophet hands off the marriage ring to the the groom and said here's your bride give her I present you your bride brother Branham said dear Lord I present you your bride I've done everything that I can now here's the Final Act I'm stepping back now it's eternity with YouTube the symbol of the Ring eternity insanity and there's never an end never a beginning gold deity the two of them become a deity then we go over here in chapter four and he says whether Thou Art comes with the kingdom for a Time as this then Esther made them turned Mordecai this answer go and gather all together the Jews that are present in shushan and fast for me and neither eaten or drink these three days or night or that I may also I also my maidens will Fast likewise and so will I go into the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish so here she comes she's she finally she she argued with Mordecai to start with I I can't she didn't realize who she was you realize she had already went into the and consummated the marriage she had already become the Bride of Xerxes she had already become favored in cersei's eyes she was already loved by xers we're already loved by Christ we're already favored in his eyes but we forget who we are and when Trials come our way what testings come our way we forget who we are and we're afraid to go and approach our husband and ask him for help and here Esther's coming and Mordecai and there's bad news haman's out they're going to kill all the Jews there's been a decree go forth against all the Jews there was a decree that went forth when Eve fell that everybody would die in their sin that the law the law was written already when Eve sinned law was written against all mankind that she would die and here she's afraid but but then she finally remembers her prophet's message she remembered how she was to prepare herself to go in the first time we remember Howard to prepare ourselves to go inside and the first time into our King we humble ourselves we make ourselves ready we get in the word we prepare our hearts how do we do it we come to church we we're getting the message in the hour and we're coming to church we have a need and we know we're going to get and we know if we come prepared to church we'll get Deliverance of some way or if we have something else and and we need to call somebody we prepare our we put down the Flesh and we start getting all antsy and all that and we start focusing on the word and say the answer is in the word maybe cancer is trying to kill you maybe somebody's trying to persecute you maybe some kind of Trials come in and they're taking loved ones or whatever but all of a sudden you stop you stop worrying about that and you start focusing on the word you start humbling yourself before God then he can come on the scene for you and here she is she comes and she she gathers everybody together and they pray and they fast and and they start reading the word and she starts to remember that what her messenger said she starts remembering the way that she said he said to her approach her and what kind of Garb do where the Robes of his righteousness the robes that he provided so many times we want to go there in the Robes of our own righteousness Lord I look what I did I did this yesterday and I helped feed this person over here and I helped this person over here and I did this and I didn't send over here and I remember I was going to say that cuss word and I didn't say that customer remember I was going to look at that pornography but I didn't look at that point wrong and we start looking at our own works we start looking at our own ways and we start to try to approach him in our own rights in our own works and all that but those are filthy rags to him what we got to do is remember we come in his righteousness oh Lord I'm sorry I did all this I've apologize I I Repent Lord and I come before you father God and Lord I ask your forgiveness and we humble ourselves before him and we come in his righteous Lord I have no righteousness but the blood that was shed that covers me I'm robed and you're righteous I'm robed in that blood that was shed for me I am robed and I'm stepping forth before you tonight and I'm 74th and I'm coming into your presence and you start worshiping remember and I'm just going to paraphrase that what goes on here Esther comes in before the king and she just starts worshiping and she finds favor because she come in the right attitude she come in and not her own rights but his righteous and she worships and she goes I'm going to build you a feast I'm going to I'm going to pray to you I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to feed you I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you how much I love you I want to do this and I'm going to do yeah and you know what the whole time that you're worshiping him the whole time you Feast of him Satan's in that present Haman was in that present you know she invited Heyman she invited Satan to come and watch her attitude towards him and Satan's like I'm getting to her she's going to deny him I'm getting to the bride she's going to fall I'm getting to the bride she's going to fall she's going to fall and and and and then the next day Oh I wanna I wanna Worship You Again I want to just I you know we go through these trials and we're praying Lord delivering with deliberately delivering me and and we think one day here here's Esther she comes again and she goes oh and the Lord's like well what do you want I just want to worship you up to half of my kingdom it's yours Esther it's yours bright up to half of my king it's yours to partake of it's yours to use it's yours you got the authority you use it up to half of your kingdom up to half of my kingdom up to half of it we're equal we're one you're my bride everything I have I've given to you you it's at your disposal and she goes oh let's just Feast again tomorrow let's just go back to church let's just get in a word and let's just read the Bible let's just fortify our minds in the message of the hour let's just fortify ourselves in the word of the hour let's let's do that and the whole time Satan's like well he didn't she didn't ask for anything you know what Satan doesn't know who we are he doesn't know who's bride and who's not brave well you could tell who's not bright sometimes but the way they act or if they walk away and all that and that kind of stuff but the true bride he doesn't know who she is he can't recognize her and all of a sudden the second time comes around and she's worshiping him the King Xerxes and she's feeding him and she's filling him up and he goes oh Esther what is your desire oh that you would get rid of this Haman that you would get rid of the Satan out of my life he's tried to bring cancer into my life he's taken my son he's taken my joy he's taken my happiness he's trying to give me anxiety he's trying to give me depression he's trying to do all this to me oh if you take who is it who is it who is it it's this hate right here and all of a sudden he was taken to the Gallows and it was cast out of her life and the last thing he's saying was the bride the last thing he's saying was the bride was they put the The Hangman's I don't know what it's called cover over his head because he was running away you know but you know what that though we have power over Satan right it didn't do away with that decree of death against us it didn't do away with the decree of death against the Jews in that day and you know what Esther had to go back before the king you know what she didn't hesitate this time amen I had just written down anyway she didn't hesitate to take a Time Glory and on that day the king of Xerxes give the house of Haman the Jews enemy over to Esther and the Queen so in that day he gave her Authority over Satan's kingdom in that day he gave the bride authority over Satan's kingdom he rendered Satan powerless though there was still a decree of death against him and Mordecai came to before the king for Esther had told him what was done the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it to Mordecai and to Esther then set Mordecai over the house of Hammond and Esther speak yet again listen this time this time she didn't just hesitate she just went up to him and started speaking once she realized who she was while she got her victory over Satan well she got victory in her life she didn't hesitate hesitate this time and Esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the Mischief of Haman the agite and his device that he had devised against the Jews and the King held out the golden scepter towards Esther so the Esther arose and stood before the king and said if it please the king and if I had found favor in thy sight the king and the King seemed right before and it and the thing seemed right before the king and I'd be pleasing in his eyes Let It Be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of a matter of we'll just call him ham the agite which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in the king's provinces for How Can I Endure to see the evil that shall come upon my people or How Can I Endure to see the destruction of my Kindred then King Cersei set a nest to the queen and to Mordechai the Jew behold I have given Esther the house of Haman I've given him the authority over Satan and him they had and of Haman and him they have hanged upon the gods because he was laid his hand upon the Jews righteous also for the Jews as it like you and the king's name and sealed with the king's ring for the the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed which with the king's Ring made no man reversed so he couldn't reverse the decree but he turned around and he gave Esther Mordecai the Jews who has won or the type of the Bride the baptism the Holy Spirit authority of the baptism of the Holy Spirit to write whatever decree she desired to overcome the decree of death think about that she was given the authority and signified by a seal signified by the baptism of the Holy Spirit that we the bride will have authority to say whatsoever we say to overcome death in our lives to overcome unbelief in our lives to put Satan to bed to put Satan at rest and you know they went out and they killed so many a lot of times we go out and we kill so many enemies in our lives we kill lust and we kill smoking maybe we kill drinking we killed this and we stopped there but you look under Esther they went out and then they came back and she went back to the King again he said do it again whatever your desire is you have authority you have up to half of the Kingdom you have you have just as much Authority as I do because my word is in you and I have given you my word I've given you my Signet I've given you the baptism of the Holy Spirit now you speak and you tell the Satan what he can and cannot do any Authority that Satan brings upon your life you've given him that Authority you've allowed it because God gave you the power if you are sitting here and you have the baptism of the holy spirit this morning or this evening do you have the baptism of the holy spirit this evening you have the authority to stand against Satan and say not today Satan not in my family Satan you are taking my kids you ain't taking my life you ain't taking their life you got to go you've got to flee but if you stop right there he'll just come back the next day each day we have to exercise that Authority in our lives each day we have to exercise that Authority overcame come mind battles every day we got to exercise that authority to bring our kids into the message of the hour to bring them into revelation if you've got kids out there that aren't serving the lord they're yours you apply the token you use the word you speak it he gave us third pool power what is the third pull power it's the spoken word you speak the decree against Satan Satan can't be thou cast down and behind me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not in us but what's inside of us that's the authority of Christ The Living inside of us that gives us the authority to speak peace to our lives because this Authority speaks peace to the storms that come our way it gives us the authority to speak healing in our lives you got something that you're being hounded with you speak to it and you tell it to be gone and don't just be with a wish you wash you and all that when it tries to come back you stand firm and say Satan I told you you have no part of me I told you you have to go and if I look I have the Holy Spirit here's the Signet this is my authority you have to listen to me Satan you have to go you cannot take my life just like you could not take job's life unless God was allow you you couldn't take Joe's cattle unless God allowed you you couldn't take job's children unless God allowed you and unless God allows you and oversteps my authority guess what I have authority to stand against you because she he and I are one so he won't override my authority because now I speak as him she is him we're in the last days it's the bride's message it's the bride is the message of the hour today she's the one living it the message lived through her the message of brother Brandon is being lived out through her it had to be put into action it couldn't just stand the prophet but it had to be put into action through a multi-membered body called the bride of Christ so that his glory could shine so that he could show off that it wasn't just me but it was what was behind me the whole time and why I did it I had to help me I wanted her to come into Glory I want her to shine right next to me even brighter than me because she is me the patman's vision amen cut every obstacle for human beings that they might be connected to the Garden of Eden no man I was going to choke it out but I'm I'm going to say this man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God as omnipotent there's the key he had to be fully surrendered if you're still halfway in the world and halfway into God you are not omnipotent yet you have to be fully surrendered you have to have fully surrendered your life so that he can work through you so he has every fiber every being every thought every way in your life you have to be fully surrendered you cannot live a halfway life a lot of times we want to live a halfway life because we want the things of the world but we also want God in our life and it doesn't mix it's like oil water they don't mix the oil is going to flow to the top but the water life is going to sink down the oil of this world to show forth first because you're burying it but that Water of Life Will flow out of you if you give it a chance a man fully surrendered to God as omniping it did you did not he say it in Mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man come together two opponents two ineptids I've been pronouncing it wrong two omnipotents something's got to shake whatever you do whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings it to pass things that is not and makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful two omnipotent men do you ever think that you are an infinite power when you are fully surrendered to God you are an omnipotent power and you have all full Authority to use the word not for your own Glory not for your own wants and desires but for his pleasure for his desires and what's his desires for you to have happiness joy long-suffering meekness among all that in your life that's his desire to manifest the fruits of the spirits and what are the fruits and Spirits it's him he is all those amen amen you are an independent we're facing here in our two subjects that we read and this is from shalom the two scriptures rather a very contrast one on the other and Isaiah it says arise and shine for the glory of God has come upon you the light is here and then the very next verse says gross darkness is upon this people and then then we are in a mystery of light and darkness isn't that our age we're in a mystery of light and darkness and then then my address to the church is Shalom peace let's find out what it's all about see we're facing this year with both Darkness and Light We Are The World is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness and it's ever stood and yet it's standing in again the Most Blessed light that ever did Shine we are in the darkest days we've ever seen yet the greatest light that ever shown on Earth is sitting in this building right here tonight it's sitting over in Switzerland and some meetings are there it's sitting down here in Lima Ohio it's sitting all over the world and it's called the bride of Christ arise Shine Let Your Light Shine the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water he said let there be light and God separated the light from darkness and I believe that we are now living in an hour again that when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest then the church the reason I say shalom to them is because that it's God's peace that's what I want to bring to you this morning for this New Year's is not looking back but we are looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something great laying ahead there where the years has been Joy that we've looked forward to the pressing the coming of the great light and now we can see the breaking over the horizon horizon of Realm it's breaking between Mortal and immortality we see it's the breaking between heavens and earth and an Earthbound sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of immortal life and a moral body and a mortal Earth shall never pass away it's shalom unto the people unto the church now it's the light coming for the Believers but gross Darkness for the people that's where we are that is exactly where we're at today close with us here the message has moved from the prophet to the bride and these are my thoughts the message is moved from the prophet to the bride the prophet fulfilled maokai 4 5 and 6. He restored the words that the father's priests in the days of old it was the prophet's commission to do so and now we are standing in the bright age and we have a commission to go forth and prophesy again before many nations people tongues and kings a Living Word and Flesh manifested on Earth today the prophet has gone off the scene but the message didn't die with him the word has to have flesh living and breathing on the earth to work through and she the bride has become him the two United becoming one and now she is the final voice to the final age standing and proving that the second Eve would not fall that she would accept the whole word and eat the book and become one with it and prophesy again to the Fallen World that he is alive and working on Earth today it has to come through a living breathing flesh the tapes only won't work the Flesh of the Prophet has gone on from this world having restored of Fallen Eve to the word making her one with the word having completed his commission as it says in Revelations 10 7 then John a type of the bride was commanded by The Voice from Heaven Christ to take the book and eat it to Devour the word revealed through the message of the hour and prophesy again and put it on display in an action performing the same works as Christ did when he was on Earth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in a wedding who's on display the bride she's the whole reason for the wedding she's a bride brother Dale we all want to stand the precious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this day and we thank you for your goodness and mercy Lord let's pray that you just take the word father and Lord you make it so alive and real to his father and Lord just ask that you would just come and anoint our thoughts Lord and Lord that we have become like you when we would realize who we are father and we'd step out Lord as the bride of Christ with all full and Authority Lord and to the day father even to the changing of our bodies Lord Lord a spoken word Lord we have spoken word Authority in our lives father that we can speak Lord the third pool father we thank you for that revelation we thank you for all you do for us Lord and Lord has Commit This bride into your hands father and Commit This Night Lord forgive me if I said anything in this Lord in Jesus Christ and we pray amen to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth [Music] Glory [Music] I only ask to be like him one more time Me Like Jesus [Music] [Music] on Earth I am to be thy King [Music]
