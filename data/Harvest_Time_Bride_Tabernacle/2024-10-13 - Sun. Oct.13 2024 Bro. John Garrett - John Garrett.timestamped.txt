[0:00] the flood with Noah to make to make
[0:03] sacrifices and we know that uh uh that
[0:08] that sacrifice was there from the
[0:10] beginning that the blood came because we
[0:13] had to be uh completely covered Abel's
[0:18] sacrifice was was by Revelation amen
[0:21] that he understood that that by
[0:24] Revelation that there was a sin a blood
[0:26] sin that had happened and blood must be
[0:28] shed to cover it to atone for it and so
[0:31] when he he made that sacrifice it's very
[0:33] interesting that it says that he went
[0:35] before God him and Abel went before God
[0:38] like the the the presence of God right
[0:40] there wherever it was right there at
[0:43] the stepped out from behind the the the
[0:47] the gate there and pushed the the
[0:50] cherubim with the Flaming sword aside
[0:52] and he he was ready to accept their
[0:54] sacrifice think about that and and so
[0:56] you know Abel sacrifices and he and he
[0:59] you know imagine he he took the sharp
[1:01] Rock and he just started whacking the
[1:03] throats of those those lambs and you
[1:06] know all the bleeding and the blood and
[1:08] you know like in in our mind in our
[1:10] thinking our way of thinking we say how
[1:11] horrible is that is that how a terrible
[1:16] you know and then comes up and he makes
[1:18] his sacrifice of of all the things that
[1:20] he had got from the earth and the the
[1:22] fruits and the the harvest and
[1:23] everything else and and God looks at one
[1:26] and looks at the other and he says I'll
[1:28] have respect towards the shed of blood
[1:31] because in his Mind's Eye there was
[1:32] always a lamb slain before the
[1:34] foundation of the world and so he knew
[1:36] that by re able knew and by God knew
[1:39] that he was right on track amen that
[1:42] this was speaking of things to come and
[1:45] then when Cain rose up and slew Abel
[1:48] that uh God comes down and he to Cain
[1:51] and Cain's in the field and he you know
[1:53] Cain is saying well where's God says
[1:56] well where's your brother and he said am
[1:57] I am my ael's keeper think about that to
[1:59] be able to lie to God directly to his
[2:02] face you know I I wonder how common God
[2:05] had become to to Abel and Cain uh and to
[2:10] to be able to to for Cain to be able to
[2:18] have days and look him in his face and
[2:21] lie to him
[2:23] wow wow and I think you know it's very
[2:25] easy I think it's very easy for us who
[2:28] have been around the word and been
[2:30] around the message for years and we can
[2:31] let this become a little bit too common
[2:33] to us amen we can let it become a little
[2:35] too common where we we we don't respect
[2:37] it enough we don't respect that these
[2:40] are the words of God from a prophet in
[2:42] our day amen amen so uh you know and
[2:45] know God says uh you know your
[2:50] brother's the ground it had a voice it
[2:52] spoke to God and it spoke it God heard
[2:56] that voice and there was a voice in the
[2:58] blood and and and you know it's it's
[3:01] it's interesting that that Cain couldn't
[3:03] hear that voice Cain couldn't hear hear
[3:05] it but God saw it and he understood it
[3:09] he heard it with his ears and he he uh
[3:13] he understood the the significance of it
[3:15] that this this shedding of blood and
[3:17] this this murder that and he began to to
[3:20] to curse Cain and he and that was driven
[3:24] away and and everything and I think that
[3:26] if Cain would have
[3:28] understood that that what the blood
[3:30] would do he would have never spilled
[3:33] Abel's blood he would have never
[3:34] committed murder if he had realized the
[3:36] voice of the blood in Abel he would have
[3:40] never have done it because that you know
[3:42] it went straight to God's ears as soon
[3:44] as it happened amen and that was because
[3:46] in Cain or I'm sorry within Abel within
[3:49] that blood there was a life in the blood
[3:51] amen and not the CH not the physical
[3:53] chemistry of the blood but within the
[3:58] BL life belongs to God and it goes back
[4:01] to God Amen so whenever that's spilled
[4:04] into the ground it
[4:07] carries what have you done the voice of
[4:09] your brother's blood cries to me from
[4:11] the ground uh and Abel's blood carry
[4:14] that loud message and it's amazing I
[4:17] thought about this as I was studying
[4:19] that we we consider our inner thoughts
[4:22] know we believe that our inner thoughts
[4:24] speak more loudly in heaven than the the
[4:26] things that we say out of our mouth amen
[4:28] that that the Throne of God God hears
[4:30] the things that we say amen I wonder how
[4:32] much more loudly the blood spoke when it
[4:35] was spilled on the
[4:38] ground cuz he didn't wait around did he
[4:40] he came right away right away to to
[4:43] confront Cain and it it Abel's blood I
[4:47] think expressed more than just a um what
[4:51] had happened but I think it had a voice
[4:53] that cried out for uh the the the
[4:57] separation of Brotherhood I think it had
[4:59] a voice that cried out that this was
[5:01] wrong that it was it was evil and and
[5:03] that something bad had happened that
[5:05] that it wasn't just
[5:06] a crying out because you cut your finger
[5:09] and the blood grow goes on to the ground
[5:11] but this spoke of something so
[5:13] significant so significant that it
[5:15] carried a
[5:18] message this carries on all the way
[5:21] through the Old Testament and we'll
[5:23] we'll talk a little bit about it as we
[5:25] go go along
[5:28] um some times we wonder it's like how
[5:30] can we do this how can we put our how
[5:33] can we place ourselves under the token
[5:34] how can we be the ones that are able to
[5:38] uh to live this kind of a life we can't
[5:41] do it on our own none of us none of us
[5:43] are able to to take and place ourselves
[5:46] positionally under the blood and and
[5:48] live a perfect life you know as I said
[5:50] that we we are in carnal bodies and we
[5:52] fall and and I don't know about you
[5:54] maybe some of you are perfect but I I
[5:56] sin every day and I don't want to sin
[5:59] that's not in my heart to sin but I do
[6:01] it every day you know uh brother Brandon
[6:04] once told Brother Perry
[6:06] green uh that brother brandom lives so
[6:10] close to God that just about everything
[6:11] that brother Perry did was sin think
[6:14] about that you know we're living the the
[6:16] best kind of life we know how but we
[6:18] constantly break God's laws amen we
[6:22] constantly do it and and that's why we
[6:24] have to to plead the blood and and amen
[6:29] do it on our own and it's it's very
[6:31] interesting
[6:33] in God came to
[6:35] Abraham and he he spoke with Abraham and
[6:39] he was giving them a promise of of of
[6:42] the land and what would come and he told
[6:44] Abraham to gather up certain animals and
[6:47] to to line them up and tear them apart
[6:49] and to make a path and back in those old
[6:52] days when would would come together and
[6:55] they would make an agreement make a
[6:57] covenant with each other they would take
[6:59] and would line the uh they would take
[7:01] these animals and they would tear them
[7:02] apart and they would line them up where
[7:05] they would walk through the path of the
[7:07] path of the animals you know birds or or
[7:11] beef or or sheep or whatever it was and
[7:13] they would line them up on either side
[7:15] and the idea was that as they walked
[7:17] through it they were in agreement that
[7:19] if any if we break this Covenant may I
[7:21] be as these animals torn apart and torn
[7:25] asunder and Abraham fell into this
[7:28] trance
[7:30] and a pillar of fire came and and walked
[7:33] through that he walked through the midst
[7:36] of those torn apart animals and then
[7:38] walked back and Abraham never went
[7:41] through Abraham never went through and
[7:43] walked through those those line those
[7:45] lines of animals but God did it for him
[7:49] he said it doesn't matter if you can't
[7:51] do it if you can't keep your part of
[7:53] this bargain I'm going to keep it for
[7:56] you and so that that's think about
[8:00] that the the blood of Jesus Christ
[8:01] covers you where you can't do it on your
[8:03] own he knows you can't do it on your own
[8:05] that you don't have the the physical
[8:07] strength or the intellectual capacity
[8:09] but at the same time he says even though
[8:11] you can't do it I will do it through you
[8:13] I will make a
[8:15] way amen I love that because uh there
[8:20] there's just sometimes it's so
[8:21] frustrating as we live and live life
[8:23] where we we make the same mistakes over
[8:25] and over we we do the same dumb things
[8:28] over we say the wrong things over and
[8:30] over and it's like why can't I get it
[8:32] right why can't I get it straight but
[8:35] God says he'll make a way he'll make a
[8:38] path you don't have to worry about
[8:40] keeping up
[8:41] your that's what I'm saying God's going
[8:43] to keep it for you he'll make a
[8:49] way all the time these
[8:51] sacrifices the blood went onto the
[8:54] ground with the exception of in the
[8:55] levitical priesthood that some of the
[8:58] sometimes they would use the blood for
[9:00] different things like putting it on the
[9:01] Horn of the altar or putting it um on
[9:04] the the priest's earlobes or thumbs they
[9:06] they had some different ceremonial uses
[9:08] but always the blood was returned to the
[9:10] ground and it was always given back to
[9:13] God in that way the only time that I can
[9:17] see where common man was asked to do
[9:21] something with the blood other than put
[9:22] it back
[9:26] into slew a lamb and man had do
[9:29] something with the blood and remember
[9:32] the story we all know it that that they
[9:34] had to take his up a common weed and
[9:36] after they kept the lamb up and and uh
[9:38] fed it and played with it you know and
[9:40] then they took and they slew it that
[9:41] they had to take and paint the the blood
[9:43] over the doorpost and the lentil and
[9:45] that's the only time that I can find
[9:47] where man has to do something with the
[9:49] blood of a sacrifice every time else
[9:52] that life is returned to God by putting
[9:54] it on the ground but here we have where
[9:57] the life of an animal is placed
[10:00] positionally by a by a human being by a
[10:04] man placed
[10:05] positionally according to the design of
[10:07] God now hold on to this back to it is
[10:10] that
[10:12] that did this a man went through and
[10:15] placed the blood without without priests
[10:19] without the Levites without the pastor
[10:23] without without help from his you know
[10:26] somebody down the street he placed that
[10:28] blood for himself and for his family and
[10:32] his household right amen now hold on to
[10:34] that because that's we're going to come
[10:36] back to it he said this blood will be a
[10:39] token for you it'll be a token upon the
[10:42] houses where you are and when I see the
[10:44] blood I will pass over you amen so there
[10:49] was something that man had to do with
[10:51] this
[10:53] blood and I and we we use that today in
[10:56] the terminology the message we call the
[10:58] applying the blood the token where we
[11:00] talk about uh you know cleaning up our
[11:03] houses and and kicking out the trash and
[11:05] and renewing our faith and staying close
[11:08] to God and not acting like the world and
[11:10] not loving the things of the world we
[11:11] say that that's we're applying the
[11:14] token and that's good and
[11:17] wonderful but I want to show you through
[11:19] scripture and I want to show you in in
[11:21] the uh some things that brother brandham
[11:23] said that we can do more with that blood
[11:26] than apply it to our own lives Leviticus
[11:29] 1711 just to as I'm kind of talking here
[11:32] and and going through some of these
[11:33] scriptures and rehearsing and bear with
[11:35] me Leviticus 17711 says for the life of
[11:38] the flesh is in the blood and I have
[11:40] given it to you upon the altar to make
[11:42] atonement for your souls for it is the
[11:44] blood that makes atonement by reason of
[11:46] the life it wasn't the blood remember it
[11:48] wasn't just the the red blood that would
[11:50] flow out that would coagulate upon the
[11:53] ground but it was the life that was in
[11:55] the blood the life is what's important
[11:58] amen amen uh and this this tells us how
[12:02] sacred blood is in the relationship
[12:04] between life and atonement it serves as
[12:06] a foundation for so many different
[12:08] things within the Bible all the way from
[12:10] the coaster laws you know where where
[12:12] the when you start talking about the the
[12:14] laws of Moses say you will not eat blood
[12:17] you will not eat certain things and it
[12:19] all has to tie back to this concept that
[12:23] the life of an animal belongs to God it
[12:25] is not yours to consume it has to be
[12:28] returned to God by being put placed in
[12:30] the ground okay and so this concept it
[12:34] all speaks of something that we'll that
[12:36] we can trace all throughout
[12:40] scriptures and and just give me as I as
[12:43] I'm doing this I'm trying to take my
[12:45] time and so the blood was the blood was
[12:48] used uh to sprinkle The Mercy Seat and
[12:50] it was on the horns of the altar it was
[12:52] used in different ways by the priest but
[12:54] but anytime otherwise that an animal was
[12:57] but butchered that that blood had to be
[12:59] returned to the ground and even on the
[13:00] on the altars and even on the sacrifices
[13:03] upon the Temple mount the the Waters of
[13:05] the guihan Springs would Bubble Up and
[13:08] it would wash the blood away down into
[13:10] the valley of jezrael and into the into
[13:13] the waste and everything to return all
[13:14] that to the Earth it didn't just stick
[13:17] stick around it all had to go back into
[13:19] the Earth and Jesus as I was saying
[13:22] earlier referred to this is uh or maybe
[13:24] I didn't already but Jesus is talking to
[13:26] his followers I think brother Dell you
[13:27] and I were talking about this
[13:29] he says except you eat the Flesh of the
[13:31] son of man and drink his blood you have
[13:33] no life in you amen and that was such a
[13:36] hard thing for the for the people who
[13:37] were following to him to to hear because
[13:40] all their life they've been taught you
[13:41] don't drink the blood you don't eat the
[13:44] the the Flesh of certain sacrifices you
[13:46] you cannot do that that is just wrong
[13:48] you your soul will be cut off from God
[13:51] if you do this and so then Jesus comes
[13:53] along and he says unless you eat eat my
[13:55] flesh and drink my blood and it's so
[13:58] opposite of everything that they had
[14:00] ever heard and it's funny how how God
[14:04] will talk about opposites and he'll say
[14:06] one thing over here and he'll say one
[14:07] thing over here and they just seem like
[14:09] total opposites you see that in brother
[14:11] brandom's Ministry we'll say one thing
[14:13] over here and then he says another
[14:14] another thing over here and and they're
[14:17] they're completely opposite amen but God
[14:19] has a purpose in that amen amen it's not
[14:22] it's not just Idol words is to help us
[14:24] keep balanc in the middle amen so
[14:27] whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh
[14:29] my blood hath eternal life you cannot
[14:33] have eternal life without this Blood
[14:36] amen because the life is in the blood
[14:38] amen that's right whoever eateth My
[14:42] Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal
[14:43] life and I will raise him up at the last
[14:46] day for my flesh is meat indeed and my
[14:48] blood is drink indeed and he that eateth
[14:51] my flesh and drinketh my blood dwells in
[14:55] me and I in him amen I think sometimes
[14:59] it's real easy to scrip to skip over
[15:01] scriptures like this and not really
[15:03] grasp the entire concept of what we're
[15:06] talking about that when we that when we
[15:09] consume Christ when we consume the word
[15:11] when we are placed positionally under
[15:13] the word that his life is actually
[15:15] within us that's right we we dwell in
[15:18] him and he dwells in us it's not just a
[15:22] casual relationship this is a this is an
[15:24] intimate relationship this is this is a
[15:28] family this is the firstborn of many
[15:30] Brethren being with us this is his life
[15:33] coming and living and being expressed
[15:35] through the believer amen and so you
[15:38] know many of the followers left after
[15:40] that it was just too hard for them to
[15:42] hear but Jesus knew what he was talking
[15:45] about right he knew that that some
[15:47] things call cause separation and he set
[15:50] them on purpose right amen but even the
[15:52] things that he said to cause separation
[15:54] and
[15:56] division had types and shadows that
[15:59] would live forever it wasn't just uh I'm
[16:01] going to be rude to people and they're
[16:03] going to walk away it was no this is the
[16:06] word is it's very
[16:08] interesting oh I don't know if I should
[16:09] say it I don't know I should say it or
[16:12] not you know a lot of people want to
[16:13] believe that brother brandham that
[16:15] everything he said is thus sayith the
[16:17] Lord and and they want to say you know
[16:19] everything that brother Bram said is
[16:21] just like the word of God and every all
[16:23] of it is just scripture and scriptural
[16:25] Doctrine and everything and they don't
[16:27] let brother Brandon be a man right and
[16:29] so then what do you do when you have
[16:30] brother random say one thing over here
[16:32] and then on the other side say something
[16:34] completely totally
[16:37] different you you can't do that you know
[16:39] one thing for sure is is when brother
[16:41] brandom said things in the name of the
[16:43] Lord he said thus sayith the Lord and
[16:46] that was a man speaking the words of God
[16:48] but when Jesus and people want to make
[16:49] brother brandom God Like Jesus and say
[16:52] but but when Jesus said he said I say
[16:55] unto you I say unto you brother brandom
[16:57] never said I say unto you he said thus
[17:00] sayith the Lord and we cannot we can't
[17:03] make brother brandom into some sort of
[17:06] deity I hope that's
[17:09] okay amen we're saved by the life the
[17:14] the wages of sin or death but the
[17:16] sacrifice of Christ reconciles us back
[17:19] to God but more than that we're saved by
[17:22] his life not the life that he lived but
[17:24] the life that he returned to God amen
[17:27] amen it it wasn't just he that he went
[17:30] to the Cross he could have got off the
[17:31] cross he could have bled just a little
[17:33] bit you know and I think about it that
[17:35] the very blood Christ is so powerful
[17:39] meant so much to God the very life of
[17:41] God that I can imagine as as Jesus went
[17:44] to the the hul and the and the scourging
[17:47] that the very first time the you know
[17:49] they they drew back the and went to whip
[17:52] him and the blood from his back flew
[17:55] over here and hit the dust that would
[17:57] have been enough right the blood had
[17:59] been shed that would have been enough to
[18:01] redeem everything and everyone but God
[18:03] in his plan said no all the life has to
[18:07] be drained from him all of his life all
[18:10] that is in me in him has to go back into
[18:13] the ground so that I can then give it to
[18:15] my people the
[18:17] [Applause]
[18:19] church thank you
[18:21] Lord thank you Jes I I I thought about
[18:24] that the other night you know that that
[18:27] that just that seen in my head I
[18:29] couldn't get it out of it you know I
[18:31] just imagine that that that as as things
[18:33] were happening all the Angels were
[18:36] just watching what was happening they
[18:38] knew this was the son of God and as soon
[18:40] as they saw that whip you know they
[18:43] just so they don't no we're going to get
[18:45] them we we're going to take these Romans
[18:47] out you know and they look back to God
[18:49] for for the authority to do it the
[18:51] permission and God's got his face
[18:53] completely turned away right completely
[18:55] turned away because Jesus had become sin
[18:58] for us and that's the difference friends
[19:01] between the an animal sacrifice and and
[19:04] the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is that
[19:06] the animal had no soul it had no
[19:09] consciousness of of sin and so its blood
[19:11] could never atone for sin it never could
[19:14] but Jesus Christ a man who knew no sin
[19:17] was perfect Without Blame a spotless
[19:19] lamb but had the capacity if he wanted
[19:22] to to walk away from it he could and
[19:26] because he didn't because he said your
[19:28] will not my will be done he was the
[19:30] perfect sacrifice amen Amen brother
[19:33] Brandon says in the in the token here uh
[19:37] that the animal life could not come back
[19:39] upon the human being when the blood was
[19:40] shed the life went out uh because it was
[19:43] a unit and the life's blood was gone
[19:45] from it the life being different from
[19:47] the blood and he says you know the blood
[19:49] is the chemistry of the life but the
[19:50] life is something different from the
[19:52] blood but the life is in the blood and
[19:56] the animal life could not come back upon
[19:57] the worshipper when he shed this Blood
[19:59] of the Lamb he had to apply the
[20:01] chemistry the life was gone and couldn't
[20:03] come back it could not come back upon a
[20:05] human being because that animal doesn't
[20:07] have a soul the animal doesn't realize
[20:10] sin and I'm I'm reading this because I
[20:12] don't want you to think I'm coming up
[20:13] with my own ideas
[20:19] here some of you have probably had pets
[20:22] that you or or cattle or a dog or a cat
[20:25] that just misbehaved all the time and
[20:27] you pretty sure that that an knew
[20:32] sin pretty sure they did but brother
[20:36] brandom said they
[20:38] didn't and so that that animal life
[20:40] could not come back upon a human being
[20:42] because it didn't have a soul in that
[20:44] life but Christ's life his blood speaks
[20:48] of a better thing his blood speaks of
[20:50] much better things than what the Abel's
[20:53] blood did Abel's blood cried out from
[20:55] the ground for for vengeance for for uh
[20:58] Justice for for God to to to repay this
[21:01] thing to make this right but when when
[21:04] God's blood when Jesus Christ's blood
[21:06] was shed upon the ground it cried out of
[21:08] better things it cried out and said the
[21:10] work is done it cried
[21:13] out it said it said it's finished we're
[21:15] not vengeance is served Justice is
[21:18] covered the debts been paid it C cried
[21:20] out that there's a Life coming upon the
[21:22] believer that you can't express on your
[21:24] own but I'll express it through you my
[21:27] life will go to you
[21:31] amen yes the the blood speaks it has a
[21:36] voice brother Randon he he he's talking
[21:38] about this concept here and he says I
[21:42] just I'm not sure if this is my note or
[21:44] his but I think it's mine I just want to
[21:47] say here that when Christ's blood was
[21:50] shed yes this is mine I I wrote it down
[21:52] so I would say it the voice of the life
[21:55] was in that was in that blood was
[21:57] something so powerful that it shook the
[22:00] Earth it shook not just the Earth but it
[22:03] shook the heavens as
[22:05] well it it shattered every Paradigm of
[22:09] between man and God it shattered
[22:11] everything that would separate man from
[22:14] God and we're talking literal
[22:16] earthquakes we're talking literal
[22:18] shaking of heavens and when and when he
[22:22] says this he says
[22:26] uh it goes on after he says this in
[22:29] Hebrews he says see that you refuse him
[22:32] not to speak it for they if they escaped
[22:34] who refused him how much more shall we
[22:36] not Escape if we turn away from him that
[22:39] speaketh here's what I want to get to in
[22:40] this is that this voice shook the Earth
[22:44] and he promised saying yet more yet once
[22:47] more will I shake not the Earth only but
[22:50] also the heaven amen and what that's
[22:52] referring back to is the prophecy uh in
[22:55] the Old Testament that when this happens
[22:58] that the the glory of the latter house
[23:00] will exceed the glory of the former
[23:02] house the glory of this new Tabernacle
[23:05] will exceed the glory of the latter
[23:07] thank you Lord and I know a lot of us
[23:09] you know there's different a lot of
[23:11] different ways we could take that but
[23:12] let's just look at it for just a few
[23:13] seconds here is that we have a
[23:16] tabernacle not built by Earthly hands
[23:19] this that rust and moth don't Decay that
[23:21] that sin cannot corrupt that we have
[23:24] something better waiting upon us than
[23:25] what we have here in this flesh and it
[23:27] doesn't matter how young you are it
[23:29] doesn't matter how good a shape you're
[23:31] in you know once you reach to a certain
[23:33] age in life your body begins to corrupt
[23:35] and to die and you can take all the
[23:37] vitamins and you can take all the
[23:39] minerals and you can do all the right
[23:41] things and your time is what your time
[23:44] is it's a lot your body will
[23:47] die but when he put his life in he he
[23:50] wasn't talking about a physical literal
[23:53] Tabernacle like this but he says the
[23:56] glory of the latter hallah will be
[23:59] greater than the glory of the former
[24:01] what's coming what awaits you is going
[24:03] to be so much greater than this so much
[24:05] greater than
[24:07] this amen the glory of the latter will
[24:10] always exceed the former and that's the
[24:12] contradiction that I love that in the
[24:14] Bible that that so many people Miss is
[24:16] that God God does things in these
[24:19] contrasts that of opposite of what we
[24:21] would seem and he says you know who who
[24:23] would be high among you let them be the
[24:25] lowest the lowest shall be exalted you
[24:28] know the the rich you know the poor will
[24:31] inherit the Earth all these contrasts
[24:33] God makes that the the mountain down and
[24:36] The Valleys will be raised up amen amen
[24:39] because he's going to express something
[24:42] in this day and age with with his people
[24:45] amen it's not just a a a a word uh
[24:48] preaching I'm not just up here just
[24:50] spouting words and nonsense I'm not up
[24:52] here to entertain but I'm up here to to
[24:54] encourage you in the name of the Lord to
[24:57] realize who you are
[24:58] and that you are the the Bride of Jesus
[25:01] Christ that you are the Invincible Army
[25:04] that you are
[25:05] walking word of God Amen that you can
[25:08] overcome that you have placed into
[25:11] adoption that you are sealed by the Holy
[25:13] Ghost the token life amen and you are
[25:16] sealed until the day of your
[25:18] Redemption Beau thank you Lord amen
[25:22] because in in the old days is sacrifice
[25:24] after sacrifice after sacrifice but his
[25:27] sacrifice is one sacrifice and I think
[25:29] some sometimes we we we we don't fully
[25:32] grasp the concept here of of what God
[25:35] has done for us because we we think that
[25:39] God keeps a record like we do when
[25:41] things go wrong we think that God keeps
[25:43] some sort of a a notebook with you know
[25:45] all the things that you've done but when
[25:46] you sin and when you repent the next
[25:50] time you do it it's the first time that
[25:51] you've ever done it God God doesn't
[25:54] remember he doesn't keep a scorebook he
[25:56] said you know the s over there with his
[25:59] list of things that you've done they did
[26:00] it again they did it again I had the
[26:02] whole history and I had their whole
[26:03] Playbook and and God says they never did
[26:06] it in the first place and
[26:08] Satan's Satan's jaw just bounces off the
[26:11] floor he's just standing there with his
[26:13] mouth
[26:15] open
[26:16] [Applause]
[26:18] right thank you Lord you never did it
[26:21] how could you do it how could you do it
[26:24] when you're a child of God
[26:28] amen thank you Jesus the blood of Jesus
[26:31] Christ is so so
[26:35] powerful
[26:36] uh let me skip some of this
[26:39] here his body his blood was was created
[26:43] specifically for a sacrifice that's
[26:46] right it it it wasn't just like randomly
[26:48] put together you know no everything
[26:51] about him was designed by God to be a
[26:54] sacrifice he was a man that says that
[26:57] there was no Beauty to be found in him
[26:59] but I tell you one thing he was a lamb
[27:01] without blemish he didn't have a blemish
[27:04] upon him he might not have been handsome
[27:06] and ruggedly good-looking we don't know
[27:08] but I guarantee you he didn't walk
[27:10] around disabled or deformed or or he had
[27:12] to be the Spotless lamb a lamb without
[27:15] blemish and that just just doesn't mean
[27:16] like he had never sinned but he was
[27:18] perfect in every
[27:20] way if anybody could have lived forever
[27:23] Jesus could have lived
[27:24] for etal am
[27:30] I think I think the devil has to be so
[27:32] frustrated when he comes to accuse you
[27:35] before the Throne of God I really do he
[27:38] he just you know here he is the slickest
[27:40] lawyer and the he's got all the the
[27:42] records and everything else and and God
[27:45] every time says that he never did it he
[27:47] never did it you know the thing is is
[27:49] the devil will confuse you and and put
[27:52] it into your mind and into your into
[27:55] your heart to sin and you'll think that
[27:58] you thought it and you'll think that you
[28:00] did this right he'll convince you that
[28:03] when you did it you did it willingly you
[28:06] said brother John that's crazy of course
[28:07] I I did I made a choice I did something
[28:10] willingly so I sinned I'm telling you
[28:14] you cannot sin it is impossible for you
[28:18] to sin that is the scripture that is the
[28:21] word of
[28:22] God we just have to reach out and
[28:24] believe it and claim it hallelujah
[28:27] hallelujah we cannot sin because our
[28:31] seed remains in us the life of Jesus
[28:33] Christ is with this now okay this man
[28:36] this carnal flesh sins but the soul the
[28:40] person who you truly are the person
[28:43] within you the inner man it is
[28:45] impossible for him to
[28:48] sin you
[28:51] Lord amen the only person that can sin
[28:54] is the devil righten
[28:58] amen John 1 John 3 says whoever abideth
[29:02] in him in in Christ sinth not I believe
[29:06] that you believe that if you're in
[29:08] Christ you can't
[29:09] sin amen whosoever sinth has not seen
[29:12] him or known him I've I I know him I
[29:18] know him in the way that a a husband
[29:21] knows a wife he has put his seed within
[29:25] [Applause]
[29:26] me I know him him yes and he knows me
[29:30] and he has known me before the
[29:32] foundation of the
[29:34] worlden he that committed sin is of the
[29:37] devil for the devil sinth from the
[29:39] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[29:41] God was manifested that he might destroy
[29:43] the works of the devil whosoever is born
[29:45] of God do not commit sin that's right
[29:49] say it with me doth not commit sin amen
[29:53] doth not commit
[29:56] sin what do you you worried
[29:59] about what what what gives you so much
[30:02] anxiety that you might miss the Rapture
[30:05] what gives you so much anxiety that you
[30:06] don't know if you're going to make it or
[30:07] not and the Devil comes and Whispers In
[30:09] Your Ear it is impossible for you to
[30:11] fail it is impossible for you to be left
[30:17] behind all that the father has given him
[30:19] will come he won't lose one of us
[30:22] Amen in this the children of God are
[30:25] manifest and the children of the devil
[30:27] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[30:29] of God neither he that loveth not his
[30:32] brother so who can be righteous only the
[30:34] children of God because they are the
[30:36] seed of God his blood Upon Us speaks of
[30:39] better things amen his blood has covered
[30:42] us quickening that seed making us a new
[30:44] creature in him your old man May sin but
[30:49] everything inside you that belongs to
[30:51] him is perfect it cannot sin it cannot
[30:55] fail because you are a part of him
[30:58] and he is a part of
[31:00] you that's that's the whole mystery
[31:04] right there that's the whole mystery of
[31:06] God revealing himself down throughout
[31:08] the ages is that God in his
[31:11] church yes among his people revealing
[31:16] himself I am I will be in you until the
[31:20] end of the ages hallelujah amen so this
[31:24] this entire sacrificial system that we
[31:26] kind of talked about it all required
[31:28] blood a life for a life but his life
[31:31] paid the debt once and for all it
[31:34] redeemed man from sin for all time not
[31:36] just the sin that was not just the sin
[31:39] that was going on but every sin that
[31:41] would ever be and that that
[31:44] forgiveness some some people in the me
[31:46] message May disagree with me and you if
[31:48] you feel free to take me out back and
[31:50] tell me I'm wrong but some people want
[31:52] to say that the blood is no longer there
[31:54] for people to come into the to into the
[31:56] church and be saved Heaven Help Us Lord
[32:00] help us that we would we would try to
[32:03] keep something that's so pure so
[32:05] precious and try to keep it all to
[32:06] ourselves and not give it to the poor
[32:09] and the
[32:10] needy amen the blood still speaks you
[32:13] tell me when it stops
[32:17] speaking
[32:20] amen
[32:24] hallelujah don't you love him this
[32:26] morning
[32:28] amen when that when that blood was shed
[32:31] and that life went back to God it
[32:33] carried with it a message that the the
[32:36] sin debt had been paid that everything
[32:40] was was atoned for that that when the
[32:43] the the the Earth had soaked up the the
[32:45] blood of Jesus Christ that the very
[32:48] Earth itself belonged to him the Earth
[32:50] was completely redeemed from Satan the
[32:53] the every molecule that would make up a
[32:55] human being all the the different
[32:57] elements and potach and different things
[32:59] you know that brother Brandon talks
[33:00] about all those elements were redeemed
[33:02] for you in this in this
[33:04] body amen don't you don't you appreciate
[33:08] him yeah and let me let me let me go
[33:10] just even a little bit farther that if
[33:13] if his
[33:15] life has been
[33:18] shed return to God and then sent to
[33:23] you he said my life will I send you yes
[33:28] I will be with you even in
[33:30] you and his life is in you and you have
[33:33] heard a voice right and you have heard a
[33:36] voice calling you out and you've heard
[33:38] the voice of this
[33:40] message what does that make
[33:42] you it's
[33:45] right has it not been written in your
[33:47] law I said you are Gods if he called
[33:49] them Gods to whom the word of God came
[33:54] hallu who are we thank you Lord literal
[33:58] family of God no wonder brother Brandon
[34:00] could say we were
[34:02] Messiahs amen that we're anointed for a
[34:05] reason for a purpose you know this can't
[34:07] just come on random people way you're
[34:10] called and chosen and predestinated to
[34:12] this and you hear the message and you
[34:14] heard you've heard the word of the hour
[34:15] you've heard a voice speaking and you
[34:17] heard it because it Quicken you had the
[34:19] seed inside you and it quickened that
[34:21] seed to believe how can you sin how can
[34:25] you fall short
[34:28] brother brandham says the blood speaks
[34:30] of better things the blood is speaking
[34:32] the blood has a voice and the voice of
[34:34] the blood is in the word hallelujah
[34:36] that's what makes it whether it's right
[34:38] or wrong the word is identified by the
[34:40] voice of the blood and the voice of the
[34:41] blood is the holy ghost that brings it
[34:43] life it is life and it brings life to
[34:46] the
[34:50] word go says the Old Testament blood
[34:53] spoke of guilt in the New Testament it
[34:54] speaks of redemption in the Old
[34:56] Testament it spoke of death and sorrow
[34:58] in the New Testament it speaks of
[34:59] resurrection and life it speaks of
[35:01] healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of
[35:03] power it speaks of life it speaks of
[35:06] Heaven the blood of Jesus Christ covers
[35:08] all our
[35:09] sins and speaks peace and resurrection
[35:12] and power and life and healing and all
[35:15] the Redemptive blessings that that blood
[35:17] was shed for it speaks for us certainly
[35:20] the blood speaks
[35:23] amen amen praise God he goes on in in
[35:27] another another time when he's preaching
[35:30] the token and he says we must believe
[35:32] for ourself like they did down there in
[35:35] Egypt and also for the house like they
[35:37] did in Egypt and Jericho and so forth
[35:40] and he says you know I he says I got a
[35:42] scripture wrote here acts 1631 where the
[35:44] Roman Centurion was came uh was going to
[35:47] take his life and he was going to stab
[35:48] himself to death and and Paul told him
[35:50] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy
[35:53] and thy house shall be saved and it's
[35:55] got to be a household yes that's the
[35:58] power of the
[36:01] blood and and a lot of time and that and
[36:04] that's powerful and wonderful amen that
[36:07] that that a husband a mama and a father
[36:09] can take the blood apply it over the
[36:12] doorpost and the ls kick out the garbage
[36:15] and claim all their children all their
[36:19] children we won't lose one of them I
[36:23] don't care how far they've gone I don't
[36:25] care what kind of sin they've committed
[36:27] I care whatever they've done it doesn't
[36:29] matter you know when when rahab's family
[36:31] was saved it doesn't say anything about
[36:33] them repenting it doesn't say anything
[36:35] about them like looking at the the
[36:37] armies marching around Jericho were
[36:40] going to be delivered no it was they
[36:42] came they were under the token that Ray
[36:45] had applied for her house and they were
[36:48] [Applause]
[36:50] saved we won't lose one of our
[36:54] family they'll come God's word said
[36:57] they'll come
[36:59] we have to believe him we have to him
[37:01] they they might do some bad decisions
[37:03] they might make some awful choices they
[37:05] might reap what they sow here on Earth
[37:07] but when that day comes for them to be
[37:10] resurrected under life or or to when
[37:12] push comes to shove God says I will not
[37:15] lose one of mine and I claim that by
[37:18] faith for my family I put out the
[37:20] scarlet cord and I apply the token in
[37:23] the blood I don't want filthy things in
[37:25] my house I my children I don't don't
[37:27] care what they do they are going to be
[37:29] children of
[37:30] God how can they be anything else they
[37:33] came from me they came from my loins I
[37:37] am a child of God my children are
[37:39] children of
[37:41] [Applause]
[37:44] God Amen you believe that
[37:50] token you believe that the life is in
[37:53] the blood amen that that the the life or
[37:56] the soul of that blood speaks that God
[37:59] is when he shed his life that his his
[38:01] blood is speaking better things over you
[38:04] I'm getting I'm getting this somewhere
[38:05] here and we're we're we're winding down
[38:08] I told you to hold things we're going to
[38:10] bring it all right together right now
[38:11] because this this life that we have is
[38:14] something that's so powerful so strong
[38:17] there are a couple things I found in
[38:19] brother brandom's Ministry that I want
[38:20] to share with you this afternoon or this
[38:22] morning that I don't even think brother
[38:24] brandom realized what he was doing or
[38:25] saying I was listening to the to a quote
[38:28] I'm going to share with you here in just
[38:29] a few moments and I was studying for
[38:32] this sermon and thinking about things
[38:34] and the power and the presence of God
[38:36] came down so strong in the room all I
[38:39] can do is just put my hands up weep and
[38:42] SOB that that God would do something and
[38:45] allow us to have so much power and so
[38:48] much Authority that we can apply the
[38:49] token on our fames lives but not only
[38:52] that that we can apply the token to
[38:54] other people's lives I'm going to prove
[38:56] it to you by by the
[38:58] word
[39:01] Amen brother brother Bram says when we
[39:04] pray we must have the token present with
[39:06] our prayers he says don't fail to get
[39:08] that when you pray you must have the
[39:11] token to hold over your prayer if you're
[39:13] not keep praking praying till the token
[39:15] comes cuz you're not promised to receive
[39:17] it amen see you've got to get the token
[39:20] first sir that's that that's where you
[39:23] have to do something physically with the
[39:25] blood right that's right amen doesn't do
[39:27] any good to have the message and it sits
[39:29] on the Shelf it sits on the Pew and you
[39:32] don't do anything with it it would have
[39:34] made no difference if they sacrificed
[39:36] the lamb it would have made no
[39:38] difference if they kept it up and they
[39:40] had the leevan and their loin GED and
[39:41] their staff in their hands if they
[39:43] didn't apply the blood amen there's
[39:45] something that we have to do with it
[39:47] amen amen now I'm not coming uh to you
[39:49] preaching some new doctrine or anything
[39:51] but I want to share share this with you
[39:52] because I think it's just so
[39:53] extraordinarily powerful that there's
[39:56] two times where seen that brother
[39:58] brother random did this in scripture and
[40:01] or or I'm sorry in in sermons and he
[40:03] does it so casually so casually that I
[40:07] don't even think that he realized the
[40:09] power of what he was
[40:11] saying now I'm not I'm not talking some
[40:13] new doctrine I'm just going to read to
[40:15] you what he said and what the effect of
[40:17] it
[40:19] was
[40:21] Amen brother brandom in blind barus uh
[40:25] he's in the prayer line the faith is
[40:27] very high among the people and he says
[40:30] do you believe that God can tell me and
[40:33] and he turns his his face Skyward
[40:36] looking up to Heavens like this what
[40:38] your trouble is
[40:41] diabetes believe go home and get well
[40:43] have faith he ask the next person do you
[40:45] believe God you know he's looking
[40:47] looking up in a way he says you're
[40:49] coughing you're asthmatic go home next
[40:52] person he's looking away he's not even
[40:53] looking at him ladies
[40:55] trouble all of it leaves you now go home
[40:58] and be well and then he something
[41:01] strikes in the crowd the faith level
[41:04] becomes so so palpable and so
[41:07] discernable that brother random says
[41:09] this he says now if you keep believing
[41:11] like that it won't even take discernment
[41:14] he said your TR next person comes up
[41:16] your trouble's in your back go home say
[41:17] thank you Lord Jesus you'll get well and
[41:19] be well the next person comes up and and
[41:23] he stops and he says now you have to
[41:25] have prayer because it's cancer
[41:28] and he prays this
[41:30] prayer and he he does something here
[41:33] that I want you to catch and this is
[41:35] just a couple sentences he says oh Lord
[41:38] I cast away this evil devil called
[41:41] cancer from this dying woman and I place
[41:46] between her and death the blood of Jesus
[41:51] Christ may it leave her go home
[41:54] rejoicing saying thank you Lord Jesus
[41:56] you had it all oh and he says the next
[41:58] person you had it also sir believe now
[42:00] when it left her it left you go believe
[42:02] me you're telling me that a man a man a
[42:06] man could take and apply the token to
[42:09] someone else's life now that wasn't that
[42:12] wasn't spiritual discernment he says you
[42:14] don't even need discernment when it's
[42:15] like that that wasn't thus sayith the
[42:18] Lord it wasn't a prophecy it wasn't
[42:20] something that God told him to do but by
[42:23] faith in the word of God and the power
[42:26] of of being in position and being
[42:28] adopted he was able to take and put the
[42:30] the blood the token between a woman's
[42:32] life and death
[42:38] yes and if he's the wave sheep
[42:42] offering then we can get there
[42:45] too I believe it yeah amen I I don't I
[42:49] don't think that he realized maybe he
[42:51] did maybe he did but I can't see it
[42:53] where anywhere else where he said it and
[42:54] if you ever find it you let me know
[42:56] because I think is just so powerful I've
[42:58] never seen it before he used the power
[43:02] of the blood of Jesus Christ and he
[43:04] applied the token to someone else's life
[43:07] and saved her from physical
[43:12] death Beautiful Jesus I want to I want
[43:16] to play a a clip for you of brother
[43:19] brandom testifying this is this clip is
[43:21] about 6 minutes
[43:23] long and just as I start to play it if
[43:26] you can't hear he it let me know and
[43:27] I'll adjust the microphone here so you
[43:30] can hopefully hear it um brother Brandon
[43:33] giving a
[43:34] testimony and we'll begin to to to close
[43:38] after
[43:44] this
[43:46] see I heard
[43:50] ring I was staying with
[43:52] wasn't justum in at that time to pick up
[43:55] the phone and I picked up the phone and
[43:57] answered it it is a a little Mexican
[44:01] missionary and he said I didn't know
[44:04] that if you were in town brother brand
[44:07] he said I uh I know that you're going to
[44:12] have a meeting tonight down somewhere
[44:14] towards the Cow Palace and he said I've
[44:17] got a little boy that's not yet 5
[44:21] months said he's dying with
[44:24] cancer and said I know what not
[44:27] customary to do this but said could
[44:30] there be mercy found that you would come
[44:33] and pray for the little
[44:34] [Music]
[44:36] land imagine what if that was your
[44:39] baby and I I said I'll have Mr ARG right
[44:43] come to the phone and used tell me let
[44:45] direct him to the hospital because I
[44:48] don't know the city that well 400 square
[44:51] miles of City I'd never find the
[44:54] hospital Mr Argan by came he said
[44:57] brother brandom you I said I feel
[45:00] definitely lad that this is all the holy
[45:02] spirit so we went down to the city and
[45:06] there to the hospital and a Mexican
[45:10] brother though he wasn't dark darker
[45:13] than I am and a man somewhat of my age
[45:17] and his wife was a Finnish woman a
[45:19] little blonde very lovely lady and he
[45:23] was a
[45:24] gentleman and we went into the hospital
[45:27] and oh I see lots of sights we all do
[45:31] that disturb us and bring our
[45:35] emotions but that was one of the worst I
[45:38] ever seen they had to bring the little
[45:41] lad to the near the nurse room with the
[45:44] special nurse and when I looked the
[45:48] cancer had spread his little Jaws out so
[45:50] far they had put a rag around his head
[45:53] to keep him bursting its head open and
[45:56] in its Little J where the doctor had
[45:58] tried to cut away the cancer and made
[46:02] great ditches back and forth like this
[46:04] all the way around his little throat and
[46:06] it just aggravated the cancer and I'd
[46:08] call it that word which scattered it the
[46:11] right word would be and it went into its
[46:13] little tongue and a little baby mouth
[46:16] thought over that wide the little tongue
[46:18] had swollen and run out about that far
[46:21] and turned black which had shut off the
[46:24] air where it breathed down from its
[46:26] nostrils
[46:29] and that daddy walked around inide of
[46:34] this little baby and said hello Ricky
[46:38] the daddy's little
[46:40] boy Daddy brought brother brand to pray
[46:43] for you Ricky and the little baby
[46:45] recognized its
[46:47] father and and it did not have any uh
[46:51] breathing up here so they had to cut a
[46:53] hole in his throat there's a little it
[46:55] just looked like a little round whistle
[46:57] that we used to have years ago was in
[47:00] its little throat and it was catching
[47:02] its breath through that whistle and a
[47:04] nurse had to stay there all the time
[47:05] because the cancer drainy would let clog
[47:08] up this little hole and she'd have to
[47:11] pull it out like that the cancer
[47:12] drainage from the cancer and his little
[47:15] arms do in splints so he couldn't catch
[47:17] this with his hand to pull it out when
[47:20] it was strangling and a nurse there all
[47:22] the time when it starts strangling she'd
[47:24] reach down take things and pull the
[47:25] cancer stuff out of the little whistle
[47:27] there where come to its
[47:30] throat and his little hands like this
[47:32] reaching for its daddy his little head
[47:34] back and it's little well we're brothers
[47:37] and sisters a little diaper it wasn't
[47:41] little baby all together wasn't that
[47:42] long not yet 5 months old and that
[47:46] little thing recognized it Dad and he
[47:49] said Ricky daddy's little
[47:52] bo oh how just melt the heart of a Iron
[47:59] Man and he was trying to play with it to
[48:01] P it like this and I standing there I
[48:05] thought Lord Jesus said Thou Art the
[48:09] Fountain of all
[48:11] Cathy and all Mercy lays within you
[48:16] would you get joy out of seeing this
[48:19] little darling lay here dying like
[48:22] that I just can't believe and never will
[48:25] believe that that the and that's the
[48:28] will of almighty God to see such as that
[48:33] I thought you are the Fountain of
[48:36] [Music]
[48:37] mercy and if you be the Fountain of
[48:41] Mercy then how would you could you be a
[48:44] merciful god and enjoy seem something
[48:47] like that oh what would you do if you
[48:50] were standing
[48:52] here well I hope that my own little
[48:55] group here knows me well enough to know
[48:57] that if I am a fanatic I don't know
[49:01] it if anything I want to be as honest
[49:05] when I meet God I want to meet him with
[49:07] an honest heart but I've done the best
[49:10] that I know how to
[49:12] do but something spoke to me when I said
[49:17] Lord what would you do if you were
[49:19] standing here something spoke back that
[49:21] I'm waiting to see what you
[49:24] do and as I looked that little thing I
[49:28] took his little baby hand not that wide
[49:31] and put it in my fingers like this and
[49:33] held
[49:35] it I said by faith in God I plac between
[49:40] this cancer and the baby the blood of
[49:44] the Lord Jesus
[49:46] Christ and just turned around and walked
[49:49] out the father came on with me I just
[49:52] couldn't say no
[49:53] more and I got to the car and he said
[49:57] brother Brandon here's a little Tidings
[49:59] I've been saving for I said oh merciful
[50:02] brother don't do that I said no I don't
[50:05] take money said but this is Tidings that
[50:07] goes to the ministry said I saved it up
[50:10] thought I'd see you someday I said Put
[50:12] it on Ricky's Little Bill in there I
[50:14] said he he'll need that and so I went on
[50:18] up to the house and within two hours
[50:21] from that
[50:23] time the little Jaws had gone back
[50:25] normal and T come back down in his
[50:28] mouth the loving mercy of a kind loving
[50:32] father had seen fit to heal the baby the
[50:36] next morning the baby was going to be
[50:38] sent home for a well
[50:52] baby it was so complete Saints it was so
[50:55] complete that the
[50:57] the the man tried to go and pay the
[51:00] doctor you know with th those tithes
[51:02] monies and the doctor wouldn't even
[51:04] accept it he said that's the most
[51:07] miraculous phenomena a phenomena I've
[51:10] ever seen right I don't deserve a penny
[51:14] I didn't have anything to do with
[51:16] it and I think I think it's very
[51:20] interesting that God spoke to brother
[51:23] brandham and said I'm I'm waiting for
[51:27] you to do
[51:28] something what are you going to do with
[51:30] the life that I've given you what are
[51:32] you going to do with the authority that
[51:33] I've given you you sit here like Moses
[51:37] why Christ
[51:38] speak you've been given power and
[51:41] authority over all evil over all Devils
[51:45] every demon in hell every sickness every
[51:48] Cancer every feminine problem every
[51:51] every mental problem every disease that
[51:53] You' have been given authority over it
[51:55] in the name of Jesus Christ you don't
[51:57] have to live with it you don't have to
[51:59] just let it hang around you don't have
[52:01] to just accept it that you can be
[52:03] delivered right now right now if you
[52:06] have faith and
[52:08] believe what are you going to do with
[52:10] this what are you going to do the blood
[52:13] speaks of better things it's speaking
[52:15] this morning it's speaking to your
[52:17] hearts it's speaking a promise of life
[52:19] it's speaking healing it's speaking
[52:21] Redemption it's speaking of better
[52:23] things to come amen
[52:29] this wasn't just for brother brandham
[52:32] because the same life that was in Bram
[52:35] is the same life that's in me it's the
[52:37] same life that's in you any Authority
[52:39] that brother brandom had for something
[52:41] like that is the same Authority that you
[52:43] have as and you don't have to like look
[52:45] at it like brother Brandon because the
[52:47] the scripture itself says that in my
[52:48] name they shall cast out devils in my
[52:51] name they shall Place hands on the sick
[52:52] and they shall recover it didn't say oh
[52:54] only the prophet can do it only the
[52:56] special minister in this big city you
[52:59] have to go to this Minister over here
[53:01] and he has a gift of healing that's not
[53:02] what the scripture
[53:04] says you have the authority you have the
[53:08] power the word has come unto you and you
[53:12] are him and he is
[53:19] you Jus amen why don't you stand with me
[53:23] this this
[53:25] morning we go down friends I just think
[53:27] it's so so powerful so
[53:31] wonderful like I said when I when I
[53:33] heard
[53:35] it it just hit me so hard all I could do
[53:38] is just weep maybe you don't agree with
[53:40] me and that's fine maybe you think I'm
[53:43] just being a little bit fanatical that's
[53:45] okay I don't mind at
[53:48] all I came here one time and I said I
[53:50] said and I felt this way so long I came
[53:52] here one time and a brother brother
[53:54] rebuked me for it and I said you know if
[53:55] I had the power
[53:57] you know if I had the healing gift of
[53:58] healing I would I would lay hands on
[54:01] each and every one of you and you'd
[54:02] recover and I and I'd said you know but
[54:04] I don't have
[54:06] that God told me you
[54:10] do God told me that you do and you do
[54:14] brother Jared brother Tim all of you
[54:18] this power is in with is in you
[54:24] [Music]
[54:26] just I'm amazed and I'm thrilled when I
[54:31] see how from the very dawn of creation
[54:33] there was a lamb slain before the
[54:34] foundation of the world and all these
[54:36] types and shadows all the way down all
[54:38] spoke of one thing that God reconciling
[54:42] his family back to himself and the in
[54:45] the Greater Works she'll
[54:49] do why don't you bow your heads with me
[54:51] this morning just play something Softly
[54:57] I
[54:58] think you know of situations that we
[55:01] have in our lives that we would want to
[55:05] apply the token
[55:06] to Healing salvation of our our friends
[55:11] or
[55:12] family and you know as we listen to that
[55:15] testimony I'm I'm certain that each one
[55:17] of us we thinking about
[55:21] situations maybe even thought boy I wish
[55:23] I had that I wish I could do that I
[55:25] don't I don't know know if that's quite
[55:27] right is it it sounds too good to be
[55:29] true wow praise God maybe you maybe
[55:32] you've spent countless hours in prayer
[55:35] over
[55:37] situations maybe you've you've
[55:39] remembered things to the Lord for your
[55:41] your children or your grandchildren or
[55:43] your loved ones for for years without
[55:46] something
[55:48] happening and I wonder if if God might
[55:50] be speaking to your heart today asking
[55:53] you what you'll
[55:54] do what will you do
[55:57] will you speak the word will you put the
[56:00] token will you apply it in
[56:03] faith the blood speaks of a better
[56:06] [Music]

[56:12] father I'm I'm in awe of your mercy and
[56:15] your grace amen the power of the blood
[56:18] that still speaks on our behalf the
[56:20] power of the blood that can still speak
[56:21] through
[56:22] US Lord as I reflect on on your word and
[56:27] the testimony of how your blood brings
[56:30] healing to little babies and how it
[56:33] saves lives and and how we can put the
[56:36] blood in between death and life I'm
[56:39] reminded that that this sacrifice you
[56:42] made was for each one of
[56:44] us that it's it's not there's no big
[56:47] eyes or Little People we're all one amen
[56:51] we're all equal before you
[56:55] yes and I I know the burdens that we
[56:59] carry and the situations in our lives

[57:31] household it's for every person that

[57:35] situation that I'll ever see again to
