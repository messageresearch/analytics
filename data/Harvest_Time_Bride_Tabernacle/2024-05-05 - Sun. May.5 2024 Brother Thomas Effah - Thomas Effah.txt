Supernatural unity and love and and uh just it was it was wonderful there was no bake shots there except God he he was he was awesome and and it was just it was just nice to see just uh just to to to to to tell you how wonderful it was we never got the message that it was casual and uh so I took more dress clothes than I took casual clothes and all these ministers came with their shirts tucked out flipflops you know blue jeans and I'm thinking oh boys I'm going to bring bibs next year it was really really really wonderful we had many services we had two two brothers speak in the morning and two brothers speaked at night and then the wives and the pastors split up and many times we went to bed at midnight or 1:00 man it was just it was it was really wonderful and and then we we moved forward we went to Pastor Jose's last night and and God tried to postpone the plan for uh or not God but the devil I mean for three hours and and brother Jose didn't know if he was going to be at the airport and call me and tell me to preach to his people and and him be stock on 401 but uh but uh we had a wonderful service a wonderful service I and I'm I'm going to tell you as as your friend and as your brother and and maybe as your pastor you can enjoy the word this morning it was it was good last night I was blessed last night it was really wonderful and this brother Thomas was with us right after we bought the church almost exactly 7 years ago amen and so it's just uh he's a missionary from Ghana Africa and uh some of the summer times he'll travel to different churches and it was just uh really really wonderful also I I don't I don't think I mention it but there's many many fellowships up that are on the board and uh and that's one of the greatest Thrills we get being in the presence of God but being in the presence of God that's tabernacled in each other amen that's why it's in God's will for you to visit other places amen we're not an island to ourselves we're not the only one that's going to be in heaven it's not going to have Wyoming in heaven it's going to be Christ Mrs Jesus and and many many and and probably not even all up there just it's just good to be a part of the family of God and uh wonderful brothers and and Sisters in Christ amen and so we want to show you uh uh something just before we look at the word um that's very dear to me and I I I pray that you'll make it dear to you I I pray you'll just catch a little a little hair of the vision um um Pastor Jose is my friend and he is no no I want the building first sorry um well I mean we can show this actually you got it up there we'll just show this we'll show you how Satan works you know we recognize Satan very very clearly you know when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can just recognize Satan everywhere you know that that God put or the sorry Satan postponed the plane uh brother Thomas walked in and ministered a powerful message right off the plane no food no no nothing and then uh somehow those two wonderful brothers decided to switch their bags last night and so about midnight when we were just about the last corner to turn into my house brother Jose said and he said I got your bag brother Thomas and brother Thomas when we got home we looked and he had brother Jose's bag and some reason those Brothers didn't think they wanted to share their notes for some reason so I got to bed about 1:00 last night and woke up about 5:30 this morning and we drove halfway back down to Kitchener to switch bags and I was telling brother Thomas I said you know you can just preach from the hip you don't need your Bible you don't need your notes just I mean it we have to Tabernacle site it it's all in here we just amen but he uh he thought it might be better if he had had a few things in front of him amen so we're just thrilled to to uh those are things that happen behind the scenes that you don't recognize but we look at the picture so brother Jose uh shared with us last night they had a a church building come up uh that's for sale and this one is unique because they put right oh I want to see the building first they put right in the real estate agent that we will and must sell to another flock of God that's that's super unique and uh you know brother Jose has pastored in Ontario for over 30 years you know our Prophet said that he liked preaching in a place that was dedicated to God better than renting because the spirits of the renting place he had to deal with every time man now it's not that don't mean if you rent you're over the will of God like this building's going to burn when we go away but it's set aside for the bride and let's just keep that in our prayers and and I desire to to to Really they you know they they're in a place now and it and it works but they set up every service they they go there Saturday night they bring out everything they put it away in a room they come Sunday morning they that means they set up every chair every every every speaker every Pulpit we're very very blessed very very blessed now uh so let's just pray you know prices there are unbelievable but we know a God that owns everything he owns everything you know he he literally owns everything God can do everything you know you know you know uh yeah yeah God can do everything it's just a number it's not really money the money that we handle it's not worth nothing it's just paper just paper with ink on it God can do something let's just uh just pray for that that God will bless the little group there with a beautiful building for the glory of God Amen let's stand and sing this song as our brother comes and we just looking forward to wonderful fellowship and and uh also this brother's going to be with us on Wednesday night so if anybody's in the neighborhood the lights will be on Lord willing if we're not uh in a new body amen and and also our door is always open we don't lock our house door so if we're not home just walk in use the bathroom get a drink of milk or whatever you need keep on trucking or whatever but you're welcome to come and fellowship with the brother eat eat a balone Sam or whatever that is and something we're going to have some fellowship maybe even with brother Jose on Tuesday night and just different things but just enjoy Christ and each other amen amen hallelujah I need some words you help me out I don't know how to sing this song but I sure love it I look back on History see the Mighty God on be proving over and over that is wor can never fail but I can't keep on dwelling on some past meor cuz he's the same God exactly Oh Glory Jesus Oh the same God he spoke to the woman at the way he the same gu is wonders they are too many to tell theing God parted the ring Red Sea and he's the same God is Liv in [Music] me the same God who created all the heavens and all the Earth who came back living in Jesus and there was power in his word but now in these last days I'm begin to see Oh Glory that is the same God there living in me oh thank you Jesus Oh the same God is [Applause] [Music] amen oh let us give him a hand Glory [Applause] it is good to be in the house of the Lord this is just like heaven to us hallelujah when you see Sins Of God converging like this it is just a display is what we are going to enjoy in eternity so we appreciate that God has given us this Revelation yes and before the foundations of the world he said he lead that stone in your heart that is the foundation stone Hallelujah and that is why word comes upon word word comes upon word word com upon word building a perfect structure a perfect habitation where God can live so the prophet said then God bring his buddh and throws all the de all the foolishness out of us and he set a perfect building is not beautiful what God is doing in our life we have super super highway say we have Supermarket we but God has also got super peopleall you a super bride let nobody cheat us on this one let us hold fast this Revelation unwavy unshakeable nothing can TR us because we know what we are talking about we are not just professing we possess we are possessors may the Lord help us so this morning we are back into the house of God for one purpose we are here to see Jesus sir if that is your objective if that is your motive of being here this morning I assure you you will see Jesus amen but you are here if you are here to see a man you will see a black man but if you are here to see Jesus you will see Jesus Hallelujah so let us read my scripture then you can take your seat turn with me to the book of uh Proverbs Proverbs chapter 22 I'm reading from verse 28 say remove not the ancient Landmark which thy fathers have set right may the Lord add blessing to reading of his word you can have your SE now the message this morning is the ancient land Mark right the ancient land mark thank you Jesus I did not really tell my friend uh before maybe time but uh uh if they can just fix it right away for me there's a missionary report for this seven years that I have been with my friend God have done many things and uh he has really done great things in my Ministry yes and I I want just to show it for the bride to know that God he keeps his promise so he is God that if we can trust in him he will do all things am there is no limitation with god brother Thomas they can't get it to come out they can't we a got the technology to make it work oh okay pictur it couldn't couldn't won't maybe later okay that's fine no problem let us go straight now we are talking about ancient Landmark now we have read in the scripture by the grace of God we have the word of God and because we have the word it will be difficult for the enemy to twist us because we have Revelation right yes sir that's right it has been seven years that Pastor talk about that was the very time they go this church and I fellowship with them and we thank the Lord that at least I'm seeing new faces now it was just some few people at that time God is adding to the church amen that's right we cannot go without the last one coming in that is why you are helping maybe sending money all over the places to support missionaries on the field so that can get the last one thank you Jesus may the Lord help us greetings from Africa greetings from Ghana from my family and the church bride manifestation ministry that's the name of my church bride manifestation Ministry greeting from home God bless you and uh brother I think my children they love him very heavy because sometime they always chat on the Facebook and so they know him very well so I told him right with Brad they say hallelujah now remove not the ancient Landmark this has been the strategy of the enemy anytime God set his Landmark his purpose is to remove it and if he's able to remove the lambar then he places man in an awkward position right that is his he he has never left that game he's always because it has paid off for him and he has settled with that strategy now in Ecclesiastes 10:8 he said he that dig a pit shall fall into it right and whosoever break a hedge a serpent shall bite him when you make a hedge when there is a line that is a fence that is protecting the church protecting God's children and you break that fence you are inviting in snakes you are inviting in demons therefore you'll be beaten a demon will bite you right Israel did it one time when they remov the Lark when they refuse to look at the pillar of Fire Snakes comes in and begin to buy them there you go why because they remov The Landmark yes sir in the message Faith was delivered to the Saints listen to what the prophet said but physically I was 48 I was 48 and I said see that if I am ever going to do something for God I got to do it now let somebody also have that thought if you have got anything to do for God you better do it now yes sir am for I see the signs and the writings on the wall I see the church going into is lusia condition I see little eoms and Fashions and little Sensations scattering the church and separating it making it worse than ever then I know it is time I can't help it something something in me makes me scream out back to the word back to the [Applause] word some screaming in the prophet he saw what happened we were getting out from the Lark the church is being dered we are being twisted around going out from God's Landmark The Landmark that he St for the church but the prophet has to scream back to the word amen now listen we need the oldfashioned gospel of fire getting the Holy Spirit back into the people's heart that is what we need friends the Holy Ghost Fire must get back into the house of the people praise Jesus the prophet said in presuming he said if you want to build a worldly Church you will use worldly materials but if you want to build a Holy Ghost Church you must use Holy Ghost materials to get a Holy Ghost Church it depends the materials that you use believe God this 1950 and what the church needs today is an oldfashioned Gospel of fire fire of the Holy Ghost fall around the Altar and every heart it will make a church sure as the word that's right yes sir get the power of God back get the Holy Spirit back in the people's heart where you can have a living faith in God when you say Divine Healing they say yes I accept it Hallelujah that is right back to the Bible and back to the Holy Spirit sure thank you Jesus beloved we are being carried back to the L M right God is bringing us back because he want to see a Perfect Bride sir he want to see his reflection he want to see a w body bride so said look at the a he said I have tried to really just scream Let the church come together but he said still as long as he tried still they are drifting bringing life separ separation all those kind of game going on and he said he has hit the walls and anyhow he has made some bomb holes and one of these days the church will come together that is our faith that is our what we are looking forward to see that God bringing the church together amen now listen in the book of that is numbers in the Old Testament numbers 21:5 and the people speak against God and against Moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loveed this like bread and the Lord sent fairy serpent among the people and they beat the people and more people the my people of Israel died wow we are not to do those Ming we are not to complain that is what makes god anoy with his people if you don't have faith in God he said I will lead you to the promised land right and he knows that they will be tasty he knows that he will be hungry that is not your business think not to eat think what to where God knows he'll provide he's the provider of good things that's right but Israel they forgot about all his goodness right yes sir they experience his powerful Ministry in Egypt they saw the power of God they saw what the RO of God could do in Egypt they got the sacrificial lamb and they pick the blood and they come under the blood and they went under the blood save nothing had any first born in that that apartment why God has made a promise to AB Abraham he keeps his word but Israel forgot about all these benefits yeah and they begin to complain Church Breen let us no complain if you are sick maybe it's for the glory of God but said sometime when God giv you a try it's a favor when he gives you a trial it's a favor amen man of God you say it's a favor yes Prophet say is a favor because God has confidence in you he knows that you can stand that test he knows that you can defeat that demon that is why he let him loose right let us have faith in God said we have not come to the time to have faith we are talking of perfect faith not faith not ordinary faith we are talking of perfect Faith people are opening the door at the back for Satan we are the front liners we are fighting a battle don't open the door from behind listen to what the prophet said the identify Masterpiece of God this was 64 now you must never get from behind now you never must get from behind when you do that you are going to opening the door to the enemy when you say oh well you can do a little of this and a little of that God wants you to separate yourself from everything that is called sin completely set aside for him and for him only he has a purpose in your life each individual that no one else on the face of the Earth can take your place God has got something for you you are made like that you was H you you was did that way for a purpose God did you or he made you that way for a purpose God is Sovereign in his work we are different one from another yes yes don't open the door from behind because God has set a lark he want his church to be confined in a certain perimeter in a certain bracket you need not to break that fence yes sir help uses removing the ancient Lark that is what has gotten the church into this awward situation right a can did it one time you know what happened to the church he open it from the back right that's right yes sir God has warned him he warned them don't take anything from the Babylonians all right but a was so Inus he was so attracted by those stuff and he say oh how can I a PO man like me looking at this gold look at this stuff and I will let them go free like that no let me have my portion he can wow OPP Jus in the Book of Joshua 7: 19 God has spoken that Joshua nobody can stand before you in all the days of your life amen isn't that the promise of God is not the word of God yes you shall possess the gates of your enemies is not the promise of God Amen and when you see that you're enemy jumping on you and defeating you can't you really oh just Halt and have a conference and then make what is for the problem what is happening why are we being defeated why are you losing battles why is it that I'm not heal why is it that I'm poor why is it that this is happening what is it you need to take you have to stop somewhere and reason with God that's why God in Isaiah 1:8 say come and let us risen together right call God he will come into the conference call him have a conference of God Amen and look for what what has really been misplaced what has gone wrong said it is always you not God so Joshua he has to call a conference what El going wrong and finally a was exposed let not you stay until you become exposed we must come to the altar confess our sins before we go to the place of aan when they cut the lot and then it fell on him I will not wait until that time I will run to the Altar and put it right [Music] Hallelujah it is really contrary he said Genesis 22:16 he said and I S by myself says the Lord for because th have done this thing Abraham and has not withheld thy son even th only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply the seed at the stars of the heaven and as the son which is upon the seashore and the seed shall possed the Gate of their enemies hallelujah amen and you tell me that you cannot possess the gates of your enemies are you not the Seed of Abraham we must begin to get our identity correct probably you lost your identity said look at the Hulk Mr Hulk lost his identity he's supposed to move with the with eagle but now he has chosen to go with the wizard vulture right lost his identity let it not happen to any one of us let us know our identity we are Sons and Daughters of God and if indeed you know that you're a child of God then you have every claim whatever Jesus wrote at Calvary all the benefit belongs to you you are a child of God God in the Book of John 24:2 it say some remove the Lark they violently take away flocks and feed them in the Book of Job 24:2 amen beautiful some people remove the lers and violently take away fls and feed them you are not a Shepherd you are violently taking people's frog that is what the problem with the church today even in this message we are seeing lot of things this kind of stuff going forth people violently take flock and they want to feed it are you a feeder did God call you to feed sheep thank you Jesus Hallelujah friends it is not I will preach I will preach you must meet God and God has to ordain you you have to meet with God let God anoint you as a preacher amen not because you got money not because you handsome not because you're a tough guy it is not that God doesn't look at personality it is the an one thing that break every [Applause] yoke you need to be anointed that's in the message that a thinking my filter he said I prefer to sit in the congregation and listen to anointed preach right you understand Paul also said this Acts 20: 29 for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous Wes enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own self shall man arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them is it not what is going on we are seeing it in the churches violently pulling that his flock to feed them wrongly it is time for the Sheep also to know who is the shepherd if you indeed a sheep of God you know your are Shepherd you know that the Holy Ghost is your Shepherd it's not a man but said it is not the man shining it is the Holy Ghost shining in the man amen amen don't put credit on the man I've got a a big Pastor I've got a big man I've got no it is the Holy Ghost he is the pastor he is the leader of the flock that is why God has plac the same Holy Ghost is sitting right in you if you are not being baptized by the Holy Spirit as a right here God will give you the Holy Ghost before we leave here and if you have the Holy Ghost there is no way somebody can deceive you let me stand behind the puppet and I try to deceive you you shake your this is not my meal this is not my meal am we cannot force anything through your throat you will not swallow that it is not your meal amen removing the ancient Landmark don't forget our our topic now Jeremiah is also speaking here Jeremiah 23:1 say wo I think Pastor was also reading this scripture yesterday wo unto the pastors Jeremiah 23:1 wo unto the pastor that destroy and Scatter the Sheep of my pastor said oh I'm I'm sorry who is it I'm sorry sorry for that now listen sorry who unto the pastors that destroy and Scatter the Sheep of my pastor say the Lord therefore that says the Lord God of Israel against the pastor that Feed My People he have scattered my flock and giv them away and have not visited them behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doings says the Lord and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whe I have driven them and I will bring them again to their fs and they shall be fruit for an increase and I will set up Shepherds over them who shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking seeth the Lord that is what God is doing today he's bringing us from all work of life whever we have been scattered in denominations and all those kind of stuff but he's bringing us conveying us bringing us together amen amen why are you running this walls we are running away from this dial walls because they are going to collapse very soon right that's why we are fleeing yes flee come to her that is the Mana is come to where the Good Shepherd is the prophet said if the Sheep will stay with the shepherd He secured the sheep that stay with the shepherd He is secured amen but if you don't stay with the shepherd I want to tell you wolf will get grip of you stay with the shepherd you understand don't don't think you can make it you cannot make it like people that are saying that you don't need a Shepherd I'm sorry for that if anybody tells tells you that you don't need a Shepherd he's a liar then we are not a sheep Ezekiel 13:22 says because Ezekiel 13 because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad right if you indeed a Son of God you begin to become you are sad because oh my goodness who is this [Music] one I'm sorry letting me through this thing here I'm sorry you understand you have made the heart of the rual sad right if youed a Son of God that is what Ezekiel is saying because with lies he have made the heart of the righteous s whom I have not made sad God has never placed sadness in US but there are some people that want to place sadness in our soul with their false teachings right that is what is going on in the message brother it will take somebody without even that is reputation to correct this errors it you take somebody that you look down and like David to correct the error of s thank you Jesus no reputation no respect just David with a sheep that is caught in he is the one he will correct the error that's right so this message brother if you have got the revelation of this message it means god reveal himself to you it is personalized brother is personalized it is not somebody telling you it is you and God you met with God and you know what God has spoken to you as an individual nothing can pull you away from God Le say hey he woke out out of of the door he said pastor I'm not going I am a child of God right nobody can keep you away you are a child of God you know your place am CL and Dayan they did it one time violently they wanted to Ste flock and feed them they ordained but they removed the Lark Moses was called to leave the people to the promised land although the pillar of fire was going around and Moses cannot do anything by himself he was looking at the leadership of the pillar of Fire yes sir but the corus and the D and the Abrams because of their intellectual concept because of their knowledge because they can read the compass they could spot the promised land within 3 days what is a hell with Moses Moses when you went to the Wilderness of media I cor I was doing degree you went maybe with first degree but I am p i Dr Cola I am holding p a so Moses you are not my size you are not my size when it come to technology when it come to knowledge when it come to reading Compass so I want to tell you what a mess is this why are you Ming the camp why are you taking a r look at look at the here brethren but Moses was fing the pillar of fire you don't go by your own imagination you don't go by your own thinking you don't go by your own understanding my friends you must go by the leadership of the Holy Ghost yes sir as the spirit of God leads you that's the way to go and that's exactly what Moses was doing but K andan they said no way stay back let us be the front but God said Moses I will let these guys know that I am God that call you yes sir friends there is going to be a showdown in this message all these giants that are claiming things un LLY God is going to bring a showdown I want to assure you for that that's right there will be a showdown thank you Lord you must run into the City of Refuge in the in the Book of Numbers 35:10 go told Moses Moses when you get to the promised land appoint them Cities of Refuge so that man Slayer who does something on willingly let him run into one of the Cities yeah I want to tell you they were appointed they got say series for Refuge but today we have got one Siri our Siri of Rey is the word of God we must run into Christ move into Christ that is our City of Refuge day God six and in those days he said when you move into the City of Refuge stay right there never cross the Wall do not try to go behind the walls if you go behind the walls and the man Slayer his brother FS you he will kill you and he'll be innocent

that shall eat of this food that shall surely die but he comes around and remove the lamb thou shall not surely die he remove it and the man listen to those lies of the enemy and they destroy the ancient Landmark you understand that is why Paul is saying Ephesians 2:14 Paul said he is our peace Christ who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partis between us having abolished in his flesh the enemity even the law of commandment contain in ordinances for to make in himself of plan when new men so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body

anent LK am sir am in the message pardon he said 53 this is 63 table number 1028 1028 63 paragraph 53 education has totally fail more educated we get further we get from each other denomination has totally failed we draw lines and barriers and each one trying to get that denomination higher than the other and embra Fellowship civilization has merely brought about confusion series towers and whatever more has all failed and God's plan Still Remains the Same it is always under the blood under the blood that's where you can enjoy Fellowship under the blood they has Blended in the M invisible you know he said he has Blended the people that they don't have opportunity to see it let nobody put any black sheet on your eyes pray with that season go on your KN and consult God ask God his direction if anyone is putting wrong Revelation to you God can speak to you you are a child of God go on your knees and pray will reveal it to you you understand amen am Jesus came and he made the same condition in Mark 7:6 he said well Isaiah spoke of you guys that hearing you hear but you not understand see you see but you not perceive he told them by doing this you have removed the L you have really got out from God's commandment so that we obey men's commandment Jesus told him why should allow people to remove the landmark you have really got outside the word of God and now you are sticking you are just be you have become slaves to people people's ideas people's interpretations he said if you are all back to the landmark First Corinthians chapter 1: 10 1 Corinthians CH 1: 10 now I Beech you Brethren by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we all speak the same thing let us speak the same thing there go and that there be no divisions among us but that we be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment we may speak the same thing you cannot speak different language and I speak different language when it come to the Holy Ghost yes help Jesus you speak the same [Music] thing the same holy ghost that is leing in you is the same holy ghost in me why do we speak different language then we speak the same language when I say language I'm talking about the Bible language Holy Ghost language if Jesus God is running you say God is one if baptism should be in the name of Jesus Christ you say baptism should be in thees you speak the same language the apostles Doctrine that's right not your adulterine that woman that was pregnant to bring forth a man child he was really Welling 12 Stars said the 12 stars were Apostles the doctr of the Apostles so now what do we see the Bible said in Genesis 223 and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall clave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is what God Said but today woman with woman man with man is that what the scripture said is that what the Bible said it is removing Lark the enemy is he's the his last Onslaught is to destroy human beings for a a man to think that I want to be a woman for a woman try to I want to be a man that is the last onslaught of the enemy we don't have time again on Earth how can you destroy the Lark how can you destroy God's purpose God's work the work his handw work what God has done what business have you got to destroy God's work yes sir that's right no true friends we are in a terrible time may God have mercy Jehovah 55222 550 0222 paragraph 9 the Holy Spirit overshadow Mary and she conceived and brought forth Jesus Christ the son of God the blood coming from the M was God's own blood and we and we are and and we are neither Jewish blood nor Gentile blood it was the blood from Emmanuel's veins so we are so thankful for that breaking down all the middle walls of ptis and bringing us into one lovely Fellowship amen Jesus Christ blood could do that that's the only blood sinless blood that could do that friends amen and that is why we have that assurance that absolute hope that we are being reconciled because this is the Lamb of God that takeen Away The Sins Of The World amen he is and if you have your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you recognize this Hallelujah that is why John stopped weeping right he stopped weeping when he saw his name yes redeemed he saw that my name is redeemed the price has been paid off he stopped weeping why weep my friend because you never saw your name but this morning I want to encourage you stretch your head and look into the L's Book of Life you will find your name and your name has already been redeemed hallu and then you stop you stop weeping when you see your name that your sickness you will not complain again when you find your name there right you know that all the Privileges of Calvary belongs to you yes amen is for you why are you drawing boundaries why is it that people are always interested to draw lines God made us one a family we are not to divide ourself that's why the problem said God divided himself sever so that we might be one God did not divide himself for us to be divided but he divided himself so that we might be one because this same tongue of fire that set on Peter is set on Thomas it set onomy and when they come together the FK of tongs comes together it makes the same Pillar of Fire why are we separated what is the problem with the church why are you becoming self self-centered in a in a deceived Church by the world this is 59 tape number 0628 if you can put it paragraph 12 59 tape number 06 to8 parag 12 and that is the way it is with the church when the church followed rently and daily after the leading of the Holy Spirit God blessed them and miracles and signs and wonders follow the church but when it begin to keep Bad Company with the word one of the worst things is done and the first thing is done it begin to organize and breaking a fellowship among other believers because they found out that nations were organized but this great gospel is not dedicated to One Nation or one people it is dedicated to whosoever will let him come all Nation Kindred towns and people God never did intend to as to draw boundary lines yes right that is not what he intended that was not what he purpose for you to draw lines if you know how to draw a line then you must be get out of the picture we are not here to draw lines but brah said when it come to that is building the walls straight wall everybody can build but when it come to turning the corner amen it needs a amazing we need a qualified person to turn the corner turn the corner for your brother and enclose him enclose him inside don't draw line and then get him out you understand in the M ever present water from the Rock and when we get out of fellowship with one another in the church and out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit it bring us to a dry place a desert nothing alive everything got stickers on it you see we have come to a desert a little piece of a h cactus cactus with that sticker on it did you know what it is that is a precious little Tender Leaf that hasn't had no water water it is just wound itself up so tight till it is a sticker and when you see somebody like that maybe it is a precious so that could have been watered right will have been a tend little leaf or something but instead of that it w up till it become a sticker just punching at everything you know always finding fault only thing it needs is just water that is all it just needs a Revival a breaking up a reflection from the Lord it will unfold it itself s if you will just put it to the water stickers we have come to a dry land that is why all this confusion but we need Revival let us go go back to where some one said blessed is the man that is planted By the Waters of many rivers of many Waters that's where you supposed to be that's a rightful place you are not supposed to grow on the desert you become a sticker you become you become you you be fighting when the church got on the desert when joram took them to the desert and there was no water there was fighting fighting that is why there is confusion in the camp we have come to Desert we need to go back to the waters that's what said in the message getting in the spirit he said my friend leave the leave the mountain top go to the valley but people prefer to stay on the mountain top so that everybody oh look at that Bishop look at that big man go to the valley snow will catch you right there the old PA was neglected Jeremiah cried one time say come stand in the ways and seek the old path where is the good way and what therein and you shall find rest for your souls but they said we will never walk in we will never do that I also set Watchmen over them saying hacken to the sound of the trumpet but they said we will not Heen Jeremiah 6: 16 you understand God is calling the people to come back to the ancient ways come back to the landmark right but the people violently refusing to take God's instruction to take God's correction and say anyone that refuse correction you are not Abraham seed Abraham seed will always correction when you see a man Adam very stiff he doesn't want to there is something wrong with his test testimony I don't care what your testimony will look like amen if you refuse correction come on if you don't want to be turned around right then there's something wrong with your testimony amen may go help us friends we should not remove the ancient lar that is where God is bringing the church he is bringing it back to Restoration amen that is why we have come back to this ancient path where did the Believers walk he said content for the faith that was once given delivered to the Saints not you contending for your faith but faith that God has already delivered amen get back to the ancient path removing lark it would never be well with you it will never be well with those guys trying to remove the landmark violently you understand now Paul was saying here let pre the message if a trumpet give an uncertain sound in the First Corinthians CH 4 ver 7 and even these things and even things without life giv sound whether pipe or H except they give a distinction in the sound how shall it be known what is po or H for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle you understand that is why we have a unique voice right speaking to the bride God speaking to his in the language to the bride the predestinated what you can hear the denomination cannot hear why it is right in the Bible repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ you shall receive remission of your sins and they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you show it to the P say no you don't believe that what do you believe you must baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost oh my friend I tell people I was really Ghana was preaching through my horns as I couldn't I couldn't show the there's horns on my church every morning maybe evening I broadcast to the community it goes over half M so a lot of people hear me right and Pentecost will always call ah brother that is what Jesus said we will never listen to Peter we always listen to Jesus and said that that is where you make your error you listen to Jesus you not listen to Peter and you are still holding the Bible and Peter wrote the Bible Paul wrote the Bible and you not listening to them and you are still holding the Bible I say it is Blindness you don't understand what Jesus meew wrote there but why are they always stick to methew when you go to look he said You shall preach repentance in my name in Christ name it is right there in Luke they will not read that one the only love met you I said my friend that was commission that was not the ACT it was a commission let us go to pente and see the act of the Holy Ghost that is where they started the job that is where they started the commission where don't you go where the commission was started but you are always staying with where the commission was G given out is that correct go to where they started doing the job he said wait in Jerusalem don't go and do any other go wait until you are endu from from power from on high and they waited for that power and God said now step out you are my witness thank you Jesus yes sir that's right so that is why we are funded on the apostles Doctrine Ephesians 2:13 now therefore we are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the sins and of the household of God and and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophet Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone that is what we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles no church doctrines no people's interpretation no people's theology we are built on the apostles foundation and that Foundation is Christ the word so the trumpet during the time of neemah where did the trumpeter stay neem asked the people to build but the trumpeter say stay right with me stay right with me because you cannot blow the trumpet on your own accord stay with me I will direct you what to let us look at neemah the book of nehemah Nehemiah 4:1 17 nemah 4:1 17 they that bued on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that L LED everyone with one of his hand wrote in the work and with the other hand he held a weapon for the builders everyone had his sword guarded by his side and so they builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me right the one that sented the trumpet was by neemah he is the prophet he wouldn't like you to blow any uncertain sound he wouldn't want you to confuse the camp he wouldn't want to bring any confusion in the camp so he asked the trumpeter to stay by him I will direct you how to blow the trumpet you understand that is why today said say what is on the table say he did not say play what he say say what is on the table the Commandment will not say play what is on the table say say what is on the table you understand why because we are trumpeters this man is a Trumpeter you have trumpeters the ministers are trumpeters but you supposed to stay with the prophet stay with meia so that the builders can be instructed so that they don't do any work they mess up and if there is danger the trumpeter will blow the trumpet because already they have their weapons friends that is why we must stay with the seventh angel but said in even messenger he said it is one man that receed the message and faithful men will take the message and give it to the bride amen Faithful Men not just I want to preach I want to preach we are talking of Faithful Men amen they are not going to contaminate they are not going to destroy the staff they will give the they give the Bri original what they receive from the prophet then they let it out give it it out to the bride yes sir that is why neem asked the trumpet stay by me so the prophet said God had in his Simplicity listen this paragraph 386 God hading in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same said listen may I say this quick now even the visions that God give here at the at the place it is misunderstood that is the reason you hear me on the tape saying say what the tape says say what the vision say now if you are wide awake you will see something see I hope I don't have to hold it in my hand and show you you see it is here we are at the end yes sir smart education smart educational me it the simple Vision when day are revealed in such Simplicity till it just cover over the top of the the people's head don't put your knowledge on it it's explaining Simplicity God revealing himself to the bride like I was talking to Pastor elzar has finished his job when he he took Rebecca to the field and he saw a man he said who is that one there that is Isaac your husband Rebecca jumped from the Beast run with arm open and then Embrace his husband Isaac Ela was only there watching the event yes sir yes sir that's right he has finished his work when is took Rebecca to the chamber Eliza has got no business to knock at that door he cannot go there that is what God is doing to us we are in the chamber with Jesus Christ intimacy falling in love with our husband nobody can come in it is you and Christ no man can come in between it is you and Christ so now we have to go back to the ancient lar in the message the results of decision said I think if pente started off back there with the same kind of free and going freeh hearted and free in the spirit and everything I think you better go and do your F first works over again don't you think so get back to the old healing the healing line the old Landmark again come back to to believing in God come back to letting the Holy Ghost have his way in your heart to worship God in the spirit and doing like they used to do get that old staty indifferent feeling away from you we need to get that scorching sun to melt that starch that starchy element that is really on your body must be melted off because God has to operate in you he has to have the right of way like said one time he was with a brother I think in the orient India somewhere and then he saw all the cars stop he said what is happening so he said Raam just clam on on the top of the car so that you can you can see what is going on so he just CL so he saw a Shepherd that is crossing the road with the Sheep yeah he said the shepherd He has the right of way he has the right of way when the shepherd step on the road every car must stop for the shepherd to cross wow when our great King Jesus Christ with the bride everyone will stop everything must stop for Jesus the great shepherd with the church that's right yes sir everything must tough because he has the right of way amen he's coming with the bride oh my brethren when we come to this realization and understanding you become Fearless because you are cross doubt barrier nothing can hold you again my friend you can never imagine it is not imagination it is a reality Christ in you amen amen I'm not here to tell you do you have Christ you know what is sitting in you yes if he not there there is room for you to really accommodate Christ there's room here that he can come in it is not presumption it is not something people my friend it is not time to be presuming presumption is death because you don't have the reality you don't have the actuals it is not no time to presume be very sure of your salvation amen yes yes thank you Jesus so now he said in the Book of Revelation chapter 2:4 say nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because I have left your first love that is the first church you left your because they have removed the lar God has to warn the first church you remove the Lark your first love has been tempered with get back to where you are falling and straighten things up it is time for us to straighten things friends we don't have much time to live on this Earth You know everything that is going on the arrows is pointing to his coming yes amen you don't have time to play games again this is the time for the bride Awakening for the bride to get that quickening power in us to prove to this generation that we are Sons and Daughters of God Fearless people regardless whatever happened you are a child of God and God is obligated if only you stand for him he will stand for you you understand so the prophet said if you me business with God God will also mean business with you if you mean business God will also mean business but sometime we are not serious with God we are not very serious and that is why we are seeing all this kind of stuff here you him 58 T number 0209 paragraph 4 when we get to meaning business with God God will mean business with you if we can just get that little shaken away from us maybe he will maybe I hope maybe he will maybe he promise we want to believe it is that the way you want to believe it maybe maybe maybe may God have mercy on us have faith in God we are not in a try and error we know what we are talking about let us go back to the ancient ways let's set the mark right let nobody remove the The Landmark when you see any man preaching contrary to this message he trying to remove the Lark when you see somebody telling that don't go to church he's removing the Lark because said don't forsake the assembling of yourself you understand what is sitting in you is not for you it's for the the church amen everyone has been CAU differently and you have a special gift if you're here in this church and you don't know your gift get back to the altar you have something for the church it's not for you to edify the body of Christ yes sir that's right amen and you want to tell me that you want to stay at home you want to stay at home whereas I need your gift for edification you stay at home are you not a selfish somebody Jesus come to church and edify me come to church and heal me from my sickness because healing is sitting in you God plac that gift in you that's right that's why we need one another and then you want to tell me that let people stay at home and then they don't come to church it is contrary to The Landmark am it's never God lar let us not buy into those things let us be honest to ourselves it is not because that Bishop said it this big man said it it is not that big man we are talking of the Lark that is what we are dealing with so before we close let me give me some few minutes to say these things Brethren he said the angels that did not keep their first estate what happened to them in the book of Jude Jude 1:6 Jude CH 1:6 says and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he have reserved in Everlasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day right they did not keep their first estate right they remov the Lark right that is what has happened in the message Christ is the Myster of God revealed but man said now listen close paragraph 550 listen close calling Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley cic Pentecostal who kept not their first estate like the Angels did and has fell into organization like Lucifer main hold at nessia and what have they done organized and they got a great eunic Association of ministers to make an image onto the Beast as the Bible said and the building a Christian economy that will close the doors of this church and others like this that is what they doing removing the landmark like the angels that did not kept their first estate what happened to them they lost their place that is what has happened to the churches they could not keep their first estate amen they didn't keep it they left their l L Mark is that right the Lark now so it is time for us to realize where we are standing yes sir go to the front line said go to the front line and look at the face of the enemy and tell him my friend you cannot deceive me again thank you Lord It's Time go to the front line and tell my friend enough is enough in the M of perfect Faith paragra 117 as I will see just how advanced my church is on what we believe in see just how advice the people are how they are ready to take the sword and walk out in the front line and say I challenge you Satan you see I challenge you you can't make me dis anymore what are these things done for so that people will believe it is the word it is where that shows that I am preaching what I'm preaching is the truth the word the word made flesh made flesh in you made flesh made flesh in you made flesh in me the word that is why you can go to the front line David could go to the front line why because he was anointed and you look in the face of that giant go my friend you cannot scare me with your size right you can't scare me with your size right there is something in me that is greater than that size you are posing up there there's something in you Fearless when you see the devil you look into his say my friend I am here to conquer like David said I am here to conquer I'm not here to see battle I am here to conquer I've not come to see battle but his brothers thought he has come to see battle you are not here to see battle you are here to win that's why we are here so Bren it is time for us to really bring the lamb back back to where it was set bring it back when you see anyone bringing restoration that is why Malachi 4 is bringing the L Mark where it's supposed to be that's why we have this message all the churches has removed the Lark but he said I shall restore say the Lord all the he said weep because the can the has eaten weep it was a time of weeping but later je said do not weep again Rejoice because all what was destroyed has been restored that is why John also stopped weeping when the The Voice asked for a Kinsman who is worthy there was silent there was mute and everybody kept quiet yes but when the voice came with not John there is one that has prevailed amen the time has come friends for the manifestation of sons of God the Bible says all creation is reaping all creation is groaning it was time of reaping because the master lost his estate the master lost his position amen and braam said in the Revelation chapter 5 he said when the master is restored all creation will be restored am amen this is the time friends that the sons of God are been restored amen that is the man manifestation it wasn't in those ages this is the age that we can see the manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God Amen you look like Jesus this is the age your features everything look like Jesus you could not see this picture in all those ages but today we can get the right picture to see the bride of Christ Christ am yes sir we are going to prayah said if you're holding the right policy bring it and draw your dividend we are here to pray friends because we want to set the landmark right yes Lord we want to get that restoration amen we want the Holy Ghost back in the church on in the church and its condition the prophet said the D will not leave you he will sit on the limp and then he will be crying oh look at my home they have kicked me out he cannot leave you like I preached last night because he has been ordained to lead you to the end of time the Holy Ghost in you is to lead you to the end of time but some along the line sometime you drive him away right he was commissioned to lead you to the end of time yes but you your attitude your behavior drove him out that's right he cannot go he will be sitting right there watching your attitude if you can call him back that is what we are going to do here we want to come back to that realization that we want to set everything right we want to put the line where it belongs and do it right when you do it right it will come out right when you say it right it will come out right say it right do it right it is time for the bride to get Awakening it is time for the bride to get Awakening it is always calling back to the church you understand don't pull away like people are saying I told Brother what did Brother Bram speak about our friend Brother Joseph he said I want Joseph to preach he must come to the pit and preach as I'm preaching he supposed to be a preacher that's what the prophet let you read that for his wonders to perform I love good singing his wonders to perform this 58 tape number 0112 paragraph 6 he said I love good singing and I love music the trumpet is one of my favorite instrument as the young man just got through PR playing and I want even my guest to take up the trumpet one of them to taking the piano and Joseph I don't know I want him to be a preacher I want him to be a preacher and I call him while ago that he was taking a little nap the afternoon and for getting ready for the service tonight he said I want him to be a preacher now ministers come and let us reason today said Minister come can help because they are ministers if they are really call of God Paul said who unto me if I preach not the gospel it is it is incubate it is a force on you to preach if you are called to preach bradel if I don't preach the gospel you understand they they are ministers maybe not by desire but because the Holy Ghost has called them to be ministers you understand I wouldn't desire My Boy either of them to be ministers if they just had to go away and get a little physiology or something like that and go out to make an act before people I want them to go to the pit and mountain of the Holy Ghost and preach because that they love the Lord Jesus not a meal ticket just because they love the Lord and do it for what good it can be done for the kingdom of God outside of that I wouldn't want him to even be a bishop whatever he might be I wouldn't desire it I will desire my son to preach the word under the anointing when you have the Holy Ghost the anointed word revealed to you brother say you share it with others that is why you sit on the seat right there you have a purpose you have a duty you must share this gospel even if you cannot tell people you AC to your character supposed to bring people to the church you must preach the Gospel wherever you go remove that the ancient Landmark let people not be disappointed when

amen God knows our hearts amen amen I I wouldn't mind reading one scripture just one verse in Jeremiah 3 I was watching to see if our brother would read it just one scripture to leave you with a promise when we go you know when The Whole World's Fallen apart God's completely in control that's when it seems like the landmark has moved it hasn't moved in God's mind and we see in Jeremiah that God was judging the children of Israel and there was many false pastors there was many false ministers and God said he'd take care of those people but in Jeremiah 3 and15 God said he would give something to fix the problem and all you have to decide is is if the servants around you have the heart of God that's all you have to decide I will give you you read Jeremiah God was judging them he had no mercy on them the man of God had failed God but he said I will give you pastors according to my own heart and they shall feed you knowledge and understanding a man of God with God's heart Will Never Move the landmark it'll only be a false prophet and a wolf and sheep's clothing amen somebody with an agenda or a kingdom to build that'll move the landmark God help us amen God bless you look forward to fellowship and this week and remember next week Wednesday night our brother will be with us on Wednesday night and then uh Saturday at 4 brother Ben will be here and Samantha sister Samantha is not going to be with him this time unless a miracle happens this week brother Ben will be coming alone but he'll be with us next weekend and uh and on mother on Sunday you don't have to bring nothing mothers it's all taken care of the brothers are doing all the cooking amen amen let's let's leave with that song we sang before it's the same God I uh I can't help myself but just love that song Amen it's it's the same God if it's not the same God it's not God at all amen hallelujah I look back on History see the Mighty God onbe proving over and over that his word can never fail but I can keep on dwelling on some p has meory do he's the same God who's living in me it's the same God is spoke to the woman at the way and it's the same God is what is to many to tell the same God who parted the ring R he's the singer who's living
