You're good Vicki. So &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his name. [Music] Happy to be here again with you all. um last time I gave uh the testimony and um there's quite a lot involved and a lot of detail obviously that I I didn't mention and uh so this morning when I woke up you know the Lord was kind of guiding me to give a &gt;&gt; more of a testimony and give a bit of the details &gt;&gt; behind um what I said last time Right. Great. &gt;&gt; So, um I I started having uh I would say a cyst uh when I was 17 years old. So, that's a very long time ago. Uh but it would come and go. It wasn't a big deal. Um and then in 2018 it turned into a tumor, a small tumor for which I had surgery and um it was benign. Uh and so that went well. Nothing happened after that. But then in around 2020, 2021, it came back and it just started growing from the size of a strawberry to a size of a plum. And in 2024, I started taking it a bit more seriously and um I just started speaking to that mountain. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. and I would uh declare that I'm healed by the stripes of the Lord. I would speak to the mountain and cast it into the sea and just speak the word over the tumor. Um so I was doing that for at least over a year and then in 2025 around March it just began to grow a lot larger and a lot faster. Um, so by the time I got a doctor's appointment in June of this year, it had almost doubled. I would say it was probably the size of a large apple. And um, it was growing very rapidly. Uh I when I went to the doctor I told her I said I I need this thing out as quickly as possible because it felt like you know it would just explode. Um and of course it takes some time to get appointments to schedule surgery and all of that. So by the time I actually got to to the day of the surgery you know it was it was very large as I showed you last time uh in the in my testimony. So, um, the point that I want to get to is the day when the doctor called me to tell me that you have cancer, I just laughed it off. And it seemed like a mockery. Not a mockery because I didn't not a mockery out of unbelief or denial. Not that kind of mockery, but because I already in my mind and in my heart, it was a done deal. I was healed. the tumor was dead. It was to me it was like it wasn't there. I was not right. So when she told me that in my mind I'm like you're kind of too late to tell me this now. Right. So I I laughed within myself and um obviously you know she asked me do you have anyone to talk to with great concern in her voice and I said yes I do and I'm very fine. Don't worry about me. I'll be okay. So she hung up and I went into the bathroom and I just laughed hysterically in front of the mirror and I can't say this voice came from me but from within me a voice came and said who told you that in in in other words who told you that you have cancer right um so just bear that phrase in mind who told you that then about a week later or two weeks later, I was talking to my brother Ben. And uh remember I told you that I didn't tell anybody about my situation, but I was calling him to just tell him I was dealing with a health situation, a serious one. And uh we were just talking about, you know, how, you know, we need to exercise our faith and and and uh really put put into action what we say we believe and mean business with God. And uh I made a statement to him and I said, "If not me, then who?" So, fast forward, uh, brother Danny Misilli had some weekend youth meetings at the end of August and, um, my appointment with the surgery was on the 28th. It was on the Thursday. The meetings were starting on the Friday. Um, I was a bit concerned that I won't be able to go to the meetings in case they have to do surgery right away. That's how critical it was. Uh anyways, the surgery didn't happen that day and we didn't make it for the Friday uh meeting or the Saturday morning, but we were able to go for Saturday evening. Now, before we left, I I wanted to listen to the sermon on the Saturday morning. So I sat in my living room and I listened to the service and the title of that sermon by brother Miguel was who told you that and I just froze and I was like oh my goodness what's going on you know um so anyways we go for the service on Saturday and then on Sunday morning brother Kry Diggs preaches and the title of his sermon was if not me then who. And um &gt;&gt; uh some of you were there in those services and uh I I was just in just complete unbelief like what's going on. And um so on Monday morning I texted brother Danny and I told him what was going on and and my experiences with the sermons. Even at the at the meetings itself, I actually greeted the ministers and I mentioned to them how God was dealing and obviously they have no clue what is going on. I just appreciated them for for the s the sermons and um I would just like to play a little clip before we do that. Um, on Sunday when brother Diggs was preaching, he was talking about David and Goliath and at some point he asked everybody to hold their hand up high and hold Goliath's head &gt;&gt; as a testimony of their victory. &gt;&gt; And so, everybody held their hand up high. And I held my hand. Keep in mind the tumor. I still had the tumor. It was on my left side. It was My hand was sore. It was It took a lot to put my hand up high and stretch it just like I'm doing right now. &gt;&gt; But I held my hand. &gt;&gt; And I was saying I'm testifying that this Goliath is is dead. &gt;&gt; And I have his head in my hand. And as you see my hand right now, I was wearing this watch. You're going to see it like this. and this black &gt;&gt; top and I was sitting at the back of the church. So, there's no way I would appear on the camera, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But I prayed in my heart and I said, "Lord, somehow my hand has got to show on this camera because it's going to be a testimony of me holding Goliath's head up." and I held my hand and sure enough this Wednesday when I went to look at that video my hand is up high like this &gt;&gt; in that video and that's a testimony &gt;&gt; at that moment the tumor was in my body today it's not there anymore &gt;&gt; and I texted Sister Julie on Wednesday. Um I was supposed to go see the surgeon on Thursday uh for a followup appointment and um I told Sister Julie, I said, "I'm bringing back Goliath's head." Uh but on Thursday, just before I went for my appointment, they called me and and cancelled and postponed the appointment. So, I didn't go. But it's been rescheduled for for next Thursday. And I am certain as I stand here, &gt;&gt; I will get Goliath's head and I'll hold it up high again, the real thing and testify &gt;&gt; of what God has done. So, I just wanted to play that clip &gt;&gt; of that service. &gt;&gt; I want everybody to hold their hand up. I want you to hold your Goliath up. Hold your testimony up. &gt;&gt; Hold your testimony up. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold your testimony high. Hold your victory high. &gt;&gt; There's my hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With the watch. &gt;&gt; Hold your victory high. &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] They go ahead and they champion. Everybody start to run. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "Hallelujah." He said, "Oh, you remember the maniac? The maniac that fell before his feet told you something." Okay, that's it. That's just a repeat. Thank you. So that is what the Lord wanted me to share with you this morningless &gt;&gt; and um I just pray that this testimony will will help somebody. Uh I I've already received several calls from different people in many parts of the world asking you know just uh me to share you know how did all this happen and how um and you know there's a lot to say but uh it's really about taking God at his word &gt;&gt; and all I did was speak the word. I would speak to the tumor every day. There are moments when um there's a time I was listening to a sermon preached in 1950 and in the prayer line, brother Brham talks to a certain sister and he says actually I'll I'll find it here. He said, "Um, um, sister, you have a tumor and it's been bothering you quite a bit. It might take me some time to find it, but he says, "The tumor has been bothering you quite a bit, but you believe God, &gt;&gt; and that tumor is dead." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it was as though he was speaking directly to me. &gt;&gt; And I took that And I would, as much as the tumor would grow, almost every day, I would speak that word and say, "You are dead and you're cast into the sea." And obviously the devil would try as much as possible to bring down my faith and and cause me to stumble. Uh and the battle got hotter because I started feeling all kinds of sensations in the tumor. I would feel like heat, like pulsating heat. Um there are moments when I could feel pins and needles. Uh and there are times when I could feel like literally the cells are are multiplying. If you've taken biology and you've seen mitosis, how cells multiply, like bubbling and and just expanding, I literally could feel bubbles and it felt like it was just growing. And I would just say, "You are dead. I don't care." You know, and the devil would put voices and say, "See, it's growing. It's multiplying." And I could see it. I was measuring it. But I would not take it. I would say, "No, I'm not accepting that you are dead and you're going to be cast out." And that's all I did from day to day. And today, as I as you see me, I I told you I'm completely healed. And I just want to give God the praise and thank him for all he has done. Thank you and God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his name. Thank you, sister, very much. Amen. That's just &gt;&gt; that's just wonderful. Amen. He's He's so good to take care of us. Amen. It's just Amen.

Great privilege to be here and we love you and and adore you. You know, I just uh just a couple announcements. Last Sunday was very special to me. Amen. It's just beautiful to see the fellowship and the sisters brought just an unbelievable amount of food and even the ones that couldn't stay, we got to greet them and before they different ones had to leave. But it was just I just went home bubbling just so beautiful. So very beautiful. see brother Mont Matt's mom Maria and sister Maria just it was just a beautiful time and and you sisters Amen you sisters really outdid yourself with the food man Amen God God loves fellowship you know I have a scripture way down in my thing I was looking I think it's in the Old Testament but you know the bi the Bible says to if you want friends you have to Show yourself friendly. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want friends like greet people and fellowship. That's all that you'll have when you pass this life. You're taking your character with you, &gt;&gt; your friendship with you. You know, when people die, they never say, "I wish I'd worked harder." &gt;&gt; They said, "I wish I would have spent more family time and friend time &gt;&gt; or more time with God." &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not taking your bank account with you. No matter what you leave behind, it'll be your God and your family and your friends, your church. And &gt;&gt; and it was it was just a beautiful day last Sunday. And I I believe as long as God carries, I believe we'll have many more of those. Amen. It's just a beautiful thing to see people uh enjoy one another and fellowship. It was it was lovely. &gt;&gt; We uh we had a great time. We went to me and Lynn went to John Denquas uh Friday night and and Saturday morning and it was amazing. And if if you were unable to go, I' I'd encourage you to listen to the services. But I would publicly like to encourage you to listen to two services. And that is the Saturday morning service of Mark uh Becker from Germany. And it really explains who we are and what we believe and why. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. It's I mean it's perfect. And brother uh oh thank god takes I got him in my Keith Reed from Jamaica preached Friday night late. &gt;&gt; Wow. It was just it was I the the the church went wild. I mean they completely were out of control. Completely wild. It was just so beautiful. You know, he used one example of the the woman that was uh I believe it was the woman that was caught in the act of adultery and they brought her up and he you know we as believers I preached on this upside down but he said all the believers that brought her were looking at her wrongs &gt;&gt; but Jesus was looking at election. &gt;&gt; He was looking at election. He didn't care what she had done. that they wanted to crucify her, stone her because of her life, but he was looking at election. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I'm going to share something with me if we get this far this morning. And and this is a this is a crazy thing to say, but Christ said it. The more you sin, the more you can love. &gt;&gt; The more you have sinned, the more you can love. &gt;&gt; Because to whom much is forgiven &gt;&gt; can they much love. &gt;&gt; And the reason that we don't have as much love in the message is because we feel like we haven't been forgiven of anything. &gt;&gt; That's Bible and that's Christ Jesus said that. &gt;&gt; He said it to the woman that came and washed Jesus' feet. And I'm just way way out on my thing. But the woman that came and washed Jesus feet with her tears and her long hair and the religious people came and criticized Jesus and said, "Why would you allow that knowing that her life is a disaster in sin?" &gt;&gt; And he told a story about a man that had been forgiven a large debt &gt;&gt; and a mind that had been getting forgiven just a very few pennies. And he said, "Which one you think would love the person that forgave the most?" &gt;&gt; And Christ Jesus said, "You judged right. The one that much has been forgiven can love me more." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is love. &gt;&gt; God don't have no problem with your mistakes. &gt;&gt; None at all. He don't matter how big they are. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about them all. He wants your love. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; He wants your love. Amen. Just one more thing before we read our scriptures. You know, I seen a post on the internet and it was really beautiful. And Sister Ruth, it's literally what you're living and have lived and it's perfect. You know, faith and fear both require you to believe something you can't see. The one you choose will predict your future. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Faith. You say, "Well, I can't see." You got to believe something that you can't see. Fear. &gt;&gt; I think something bad's going to happen. &gt;&gt; You can't see that either. &gt;&gt; The one you choose to believe &gt;&gt; writes your future. &gt;&gt; Faith and fear both ask you to believe something that you cannot see. That's a great &gt;&gt; That's powerful. I choose faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and I'm going to continue our topic if you can't uh already tell. This love thing has consumed me and ever since the uh Good Samaritan message. And and if you're bored uh if you hang around, we'll get on to something else when God gets done with this. But 1 John 4:7 1 John 4 and 7. Beloved, let us love one another. For love is of God. And everyone that loveth I'd like to be born of God. Is born of God and knoweth God. And verse eight, and he that loveth not knoweth not God. for God &gt;&gt; is love. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we pray that you will be with the hearer and may they be able to hear what you're showing and portrayed and already brought Lord Jesus before the foundation of the world. And Lord, be with this speaker that I can just speak your words. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. For God is love. You know, we know that the scripture says there's no fear in love for love castes out all fear. And here we have just a a first little just a little quote. See, love is what God is &gt;&gt; in the hidden life of Christ. Said, "Love moved God. It was love that brought Christ from heaven. It was love that held them on the cross. It wasn't those Roman soldiers. The Bible says that he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the Romans and set them free. It was love. Amazing love. For God so loved the world. It was love conquers everything. Preached many messages. He said, "When love was projected, sovereign grace took over." Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and we're we're to be we're to be him. &gt;&gt; We are him. Because if we got if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we're not our own self speaking. We are Christ that dwelleth in us. Deity don't belong in heaven alone. It dwells in bodies of clay. Christ is here today in one another with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And so that means we have the nature of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. and his nature is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to just finish this uh scripture here that we started. You know, God is love. And verse 7 says, "And this manifests the love of God towards us because God sent his only begotten son into the world that through him that we might live through him. Wherein is love not that we loveth God, but he loved us." See, God loved us when I was ugly. When I was a terrible sinner, when I was a woman at the well, God loved us. And we need to portray the same nature as Christ, the one that's still at the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sent his son to be the the payment for our sins. And beloved, if God so loved us, we ought to also love one another. For no man has seen God at any time. And if we love one another, God dwells in us. And his love is perfect, perfected in us. And we that knoweth and believe the love of God hath to us. Here he repeats himself again the second time. God is love. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we get this perfect perfect love, this agape love that God is. Let God be the judge and we do the loving. God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God. Now that means we don't need to step out of that. That means brother Dale don't have an opinion on any situation &gt;&gt; or any life because when sovereign when love was projected grace went forth. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture can say that love covers a multitude of sin. It's actually the grace of your life. But we are plagued with eyes and we see the sin. &gt;&gt; But God sees the love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Wow. And he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God. Now you want to dwell in God. You got to dwell in love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God in him. Wherein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness on the day of judgment. Because as he is, so are we in this world, that there's no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear. Because fear has torment and he that fearth has not perfect love. There's nothing you have to worry about. Absolutely nothing. You parents that you're worried about your children, forget about it. Love them. &gt;&gt; Just forget about the fear. Love them. &gt;&gt; Love them in their mistakes. You're not the God that's going to forgive them. That's God's business. Don't try to take God's place and say, "I need to correct them." Love them. &gt;&gt; God will correct them. &gt;&gt; God will do it however he wants to, but he'll do it through love. &gt;&gt; Grace is love. 19. We love him because he first loved us. And if a man say, "I love God," and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen. Now, every brother has mistakes. Every sister has Well, if you don't have mistakes, you at least have different ways of doing what I would do. &gt;&gt; And that's a mistake. Well, that &gt;&gt; you see, &gt;&gt; if you're going to cook the potatoes or fry the eggs or do something, you know, &gt;&gt; but if we don't love our brother whom we have seen with all his mistakes, this this scripture is very profound. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you have trouble loving somebody that's making huge mistakes, how can you love God whom you've not even seen? &gt;&gt; You say, "But God's perfect, but you haven't seen him." &gt;&gt; And this is the commandment that he give to commandment we have from him, from God, that he who loveth loveth his brother's mistakes also. Amen. &gt;&gt; I put the mistakes in there. Loveth his brother also. Wow. Here, you know, I just lay a foundation. You know, the message of this is in the the seventh verse talks about here. Brother Bram says, remember God loved you when you were a sinner and the spirit of God that's in you will love the other person. When he's been wrong, he said you'll pray and love for him. everything above everything love God and love one another. Amen. here you know and the next one I'm not going to read exactly but John after he was on the island of Patmas he could understand Christ better and when he comes back and you read the scripture the first scriptures that John reads he says little children love one another and then he come back and the disciples they wanted to destroy that city for uh because they wouldn't give them water and food or whatever and and John because he had been in the island of Patmas and he had been completely locked away in the atmosphere of Christ he said why he said you don't even understand the nature that's coming out of you. &gt;&gt; He said, "We're not to destroy life. We're to love." &gt;&gt; You don't understand spirit that's coming out of you. &gt;&gt; That's why we have to love one another. &gt;&gt; No matter what the outward demonstration you give, as long as the inward here is the Holy Spirit, it's the fruits. longsuffering. You'll be patient. Goodness, meekness, gentleness, tempers. That's with your brother that's making a mistake. That's with your kids that make a mistake. &gt;&gt; Watch this. I want you to catch this part that's underlined. Satan can copy any gift. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And any manifestation, &gt;&gt; but he can't love. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's why if you're serving the devil this morning, the devil is a vampire. He eats his own. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, if you're testifying that you're a believer and you're struggling with loving one person, the worst person in the world, you're showing who you are. Paul said it was impossible hand him to do these things without having the giver. He said, "Thou speakest in tongues of men and angels, but have not charity, it profitest me nothing." He said, "Now love one another above everything that you do. Love one another as you love one another as you love the ugly. You'll love God &gt;&gt; because that's what God did. You love each other and you'll love God. For God is love and perfect love castes out fear. What's fear? Unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mightiest force in the world is love. The greatest force more than atomic bombs. Yep. Love. There's nothing that will break down love. No matter what it is, whatever you are or whatever you might sing or however you might dance in the spirit or speak in tongues, you might have shook the elders's hand. You might have been baptized three times backwards, frontwards, whatever. But until anchor love anchors in your soul, you are still outside of God. Love is the strongest force on earth. God is omnipotent and God is love. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you some things. We're going to come into where Paul said, you know, Paul, when Paul came, Paul had his faith wrong. And here we see it in this debate where brother Bram, maybe it's the next one, we'll come to it. But here in the 13th chapter, Paul said, "I'll speak though tongue of men and angels of both kinds and have not love, I'm nothing. Though I have the wisdom, talk about these gifts in the body. Without the giver, love, the giver is love. Wis wisdom understand all the knowledge in the scriptures and can put them together like any great theologian. and to have not love which is the Holy Spirit. Now watch what the proverb says. Love is your baptism. I am nothing. Now we know that the Holy Spirit is God and we have to admit that and that's God. Well then God is love and so we have any gifts of God without having God because God is love. Satan can impersonate them all. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we see these. I want to read this next scripture here and then we're going to go into some things that Paul said. You know, Paul I want to just find this here. Oh, there we go. Let let me let me just hit on this and I I'll come back to it. You know, Paul when he was first serving God, watch how this goes. He was serving God out of intellect &gt;&gt; and he had intelligent faith. And I fear with my whole being that many times that message believers serve God out of the memory of the message. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Intellectual memory. &gt;&gt; We love a minister that can memorize and quote exactly in the right time the intellectual of the message. And here the prophet said, he said, "That's how Paul came when he was killing the Jews." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because Paul came with intellectual faith. But maybe you can pull that up, Vicki. It's it's down a few there. Sorry, I'm mixing you up. But uh it's a 55 quote Ernest contending for the faith. Paul was down. He was in the ner realm of his PhD. See, and he he didn't know, but he had intellectual faith. faith. See, he was killing people because that was the change of dispensation from law to grace. &gt;&gt; And so Paul was serving Christ killing Christians. &gt;&gt; Remember when Paul get stopped on the road to Damascus, he said, "Why p?" He said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus who thou persecuted." But Jesus wasn't on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So who was Jesus? It was Jesus was the Christians that he was killing and Paul thought he was serving God. &gt;&gt; That's church order and doctrine. &gt;&gt; You can throw anybody out of the church order because you think they they they're not qualified or they misinterrupt the sanctuary or something. That is intellectual faith. That's the intellectual doctrine of the message. But watch what the prophet says here. Now there's quite a difference in me having intellectual faith and divine faith. Quite a difference. Oh no, you got the one right above that. Uh the one right below it. Sorry. There's quite a difference in intellectual faith and divine faith. There's where you There's where you he he he he named somebody here, but I I'm going to he names a church, but this was many years ago. And so I'm going to change that name to There's where you message believers are. You failed to go on. You've got the intellectual faith, but you must have divine revelation &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ to you that takes the sin out of your heart and to intellectual faith is not enough. &gt;&gt; That's all right. But it only brings you to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; This message only bring you to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit has to be a personal experience. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; of the birth, &gt;&gt; the new birth, the regeneration, making the new creature in Christ. See, Paul was serving God. We'll we'll catch it next time, Vicki. Sorry, I I I messed you up. Sorry. Paul was serving God by killing Christ, by killing Jesus. And he thought he was doing God a favor because they were changing from the law to grace. And he was serving him with this intellectual faith. And he said, "That'll only bring you to the Holy Spirit." See that right in the middle? That's all right. But that'll only bring you to the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit is a personal experience, a new birth, a regeneration, making you a new creature in Christ. It's a divine revelation. That's that's the token. And that divine revelation, it don't just bring you to the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; which is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Vicki. Man, let's just read our 1 Corinthians 13 and and we'll we'll go into this. I want to touch on a scripture that I read a couple Sundays ago. Uh brother Junior preached last Sunday was amazing here. 1 Corinthians uh 13:1. Though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity, I become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and the knowledge, and though I have the faith and so that I can remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow my goods to the poor to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profits me nothing. Remember, Brother Brown said, your prophet said, "The world's dying for love. &gt;&gt; Charity suffereth long." &gt;&gt; Amen. Love suffereth long. It is kind. Love envieth not. Love vanth vaithth not itself and is not puffed up. Let's just drop to verse six. Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth. Bearing all things, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things, charity, love never fails. But where there is prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there's tongues, they shall cease. And whether there is knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect, you know what the perfect is? Love. &gt;&gt; You know what the love is? Christ. &gt;&gt; Nature. When that which is perfect is come, then that which is done away. That that which is in part shall be done away with. When I was a child, I spake and I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things. Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I see in part, but then I shall know even as I am known, and now abideth faith, hope, and love. But these three, the greatest of these &gt;&gt; is love. &gt;&gt; You know, our prophet, I want to touch on this last last Sunday. Maybe you can pull up this verse, Vicki. 1 Peter 4:7-10 and it and and here it says for the end of all things is be therefore sober and watch unto prayer for above all fervent love among yourself for love covers a multitude of sins and I might I'm not re but I I didn't finish that and and God checked me on that and I want to read you some quotes that come out of that scripture but I want to show you that brother Bram was shown what is the evidence of the token And what is the evidence of the Holy Spirit? And the first thing he had said was love. And then he added that to it and he said it was believing the word for your day. But then he also said that the evidence of the token is to have the very nature of your daddy. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when you watch the video Saturday night he you know brother Markson from Germany he was sharing he said this this truth that we follow is not a denomination. &gt;&gt; It I'm not making it one. It's not even a religion. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do really with church. It has to do with a family. And we're the only believers in the world that worship under a father. I have a father. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he knows my name. &gt;&gt; See, you'd have the nature of your daddy. &gt;&gt; And so, if you don't have the nature of your daddy, then you're believing a lie. And so, I want to I want to show this, you know, when we go into this and and I I got some Well, let me let me read some. But, you know, we can tell by our lives where we're at. And so in the Old Testament, the token was from the blood of bulls and goats and lambs and doves. But watch this. And I this is my whole message right here. But that only covered Brother Dale's sins. &gt;&gt; Those sins were still there. And the desire was greater than ever. &gt;&gt; Never changed that a bit. &gt;&gt; But the reason that that was that was a type of the perfect to come. But it was also the reason you say, "Well, why did it take blood of goats and lambs and doves is because they don't have a soul." &gt;&gt; And so if I took the life of an animal, it don't have a soul. So it couldn't be charged to my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And that's where most of us have been living. &gt;&gt; Because under that token, you still get angry. You still fuss. &gt;&gt; You still argue. See the s it's just covered. That's it. Under the lambs and goats. You still fight with your kids. You still fight with everybody at church. See what that's ain't gone away. It's still there. It's like when the company comes over, Mrs. Mark, when you come over, I'll grab the broom and I'll sweep it under the carpet and I'll step on it. You know, I tell you a family secret. I had good parents. The best in the world. I'm sorry. you're second. But but when company drove in, we normally had a dog that would let us know the company come in. If my mom had anything that she didn't want you to see, she threw it in the oven or in the microwave. &gt;&gt; That's what the blood of bulls and goats does. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It throws your dirty life in the microwave. It throws it in the oven &gt;&gt; so the people at church can't see it. &gt;&gt; But when I come and live with you, &gt;&gt; Yeah. I get to open the microwave. &gt;&gt; When you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the perfect sacrifice, God has to open all the oven doors &gt;&gt; and he sees that anger problem. &gt;&gt; That's why when I first came in and I was in betroa, I could holler at my kids. I could go back and apologize to them. But my sin was discovered, but it wasn't gone. That's why when me and Jared would sort cattle and the 12-year-old kid would let a cow go by him, I would be angry. I throw a fit. I know your story is different, but it's similar. It's because you've came to the Holy Spirit, but you haven't come into it. &gt;&gt; You've come to it and it's just covered. But as soon as you get under stress, what do you think we're going to get before we get a rapture? Pressure. Anything God made valuable, you put under pressure. Diamonds, gold, oil, put under pressure. As soon as you get under pressure, you snap. You know why you snap? Because it ain't gone. &gt;&gt; It ain't gone. &gt;&gt; It's just covered. So, see, let me go back to my mommy. So, as soon as that company left, she would open the oven and the microwave and she'd put the dishes in the zinc and she'd wash them really quick before somebody else come. &gt;&gt; It wasn't gone. &gt;&gt; Think about that. You just look at your own life. Every one of us got one of those. &gt;&gt; Have you come to the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; or is it gone? As soon as you want to correct anybody else, watch this. As soon as you think somebody else is off and you're not, you've come to it, but it's not gone. &gt;&gt; You've covered it, but then Satan exposes you again. &gt;&gt; That was the old covenant. And it was good for a season. But God had a far better plan &gt;&gt; and that was love. &gt;&gt; You look at David's life, a man after God's own heart. I don't have one pinch of David in my message today and on my iPad, but you think of the things that David happened in his life. You know, when when his kids raised up against him, David didn't want them killed. made a promise that they wouldn't kill him. When they killed him, they he killed those people. The very people that were coming after when they spit in David's face, he said, "Don't touch them." &gt;&gt; When anybody attacked David, &gt;&gt; he said, "Oh, it's all right. That's what God wanted." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But just try attacking me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or you &gt;&gt; And what'll happen is it'll show you what covenant you're under. &gt;&gt; You could still be living in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Let's look at what the prophet and the word of God says here. He says here in Jehovah Gyra, he says, "Now the token is not the blood. It's the life that's in the blood." What's the life? The nature. It's the life that's in the blood. That's the Holy Spirit. It's not the blood. So, it's the life in the blood, the love of God that'll stop you. It'll take care of your anger. It'll take care of your disappointments. It'll take care of your judgments. &gt;&gt; The next token, the blood should be a token unto you. He said, "Now it's a spirit." The spirit now is a token. See, the token in the Old Testament of the animals, it was the blood that was a token, but it did not take it away. It only covered it until a very on peculiar time that you would snap. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that just shows that you came to the Holy Spirit, but you ain't got it. See, the Bible says, this is very Bible, you know, it's actually very hard to understand, but the Bible says that the letter kills, but the spirit gives life. That's the same with the message. See, I can kill you with the message &gt;&gt; or I can love you with the message. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; God's word can kill you or it can love you. So, we're looking at spirit of God. Look at the nature of God. The nature. See, the Bible says, you know, watch this. When when they came to Jesus and they rebuked, they they called him Belge. He said, "I'll forgive you because that's just from the body." But when you say that against the Holy Spirit, you'll never be forgiven. Now watch Now watch who has that Holy Spirit. Watch this. This is This is good. Let's Jared, I'm going to use you and and Iliot for Watch who has the Holy Spirit. The Bible says that if you do something wrong to the little ones that their angel &gt;&gt; that I's angel reports it to God &gt;&gt; and he's got a sledgehammer. I mean, he's got more than a sledgehammer. &gt;&gt; So, when you lose your mind on somebody that you don't think matters because you have superiority, his angel runs up and stands before the throne. And he gets priority because the little ones get to go first in heaven. Remember that that the orphans and the widows get priority. He gets a priority and his angel reports to God and says somebody's beating up in one of the little ones. God says, "I'll fix that parent. I'll fix them. I'll fix that brother in the church. I'll squash them. God will do it. Vengeance is mine." &gt;&gt; Sayeth the Lord. So you don't ever have to have vengeance on somebody. &gt;&gt; God will take care of them. &gt;&gt; Your little ones, you watch. We have things so wrong. You know, the faith of a child, you know, when we ever if we ever have another prayer line, you know, again, we're going to bring up the little ones. We're going to bring up Isaiah and Curtis and and you know uh the tiny ones to lay hands &gt;&gt; cuz they have the faith of a child. &gt;&gt; They don't have no doubt. &gt;&gt; They don't know that it can happen. &gt;&gt; They just know it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So many times we've been brought to the what what did the prophet say about the evangelist where he said all the you know brother Mark mentioned this about oh you he said I come to Billy Graham he said I come to a city and 30 50,000 people get saved I come back a year later and there's only five there and he said it's because of you lazy pastors and brother Brandham corrected him. He said it's not because of lazy pastors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's cuz you didn't take them far enough. Amen. &gt;&gt; You brought him to the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and it was covered today, but then it was exposed tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Another one, the token. He said the life is in the blood becomes the token. Another one, the token has got there. He said, "The blood shall be a token onto you." He said, "Now the Holy Spirit is the life in the blood." That's your token. Amen. I'm going somewhere with this because the evidence of the Holy Spirit, no matter how you share it, it's love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can take every one of Brother Bram's quotes on the evidence of the Holy Spirit, and it still goes back to love. Brother Bram said it was love. Then he said it was believing their word for your day. That's still love. And then he said, "It's the nature of Christ." That's still love. &gt;&gt; It's all love. &gt;&gt; So if you have problem with love to the littlest ones or when you're alone, nobody's remember when nobody's watching, God's still there. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You know, just imagine when we get to heaven and God puts a film going of when you're in your private spots. But I am but all the bride of Christ is going to be watching. I want them erased. I don't want them covered. Sister Don, I don't want them covered. I want them gone. I want them gone. I don't want to just come to the Holy Spirit. I want to be the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here here in our next quote, he said, "The Bible says, no man shall call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Spirit." And the only thing that you can say, "Well, I believe he's the son of God." If you haven't been born again, you're taking someone's else's word for it. You say, "Well, the Bible said so." That's right. But the Bible's right. But what about you? You say, "Well, the preacher said so. The preacher's right, but what about you? Your mother says so. Well, your mother's right, but what about you?" It's a personal &gt;&gt; experience of your own that you've got to be born again and you'll never or you'll never understand God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I God's concerned that we've come to him, but we're not him &gt;&gt; cuz just look at the nature. &gt;&gt; Next one. But it must be divine revelation. I believe uh Keith Reed mentioned this. It must be a divine revelation to you that takes a sin out of your heart. Intellectual fa Oh, I read this. Intellectual faith, it's not enough. Just cuz you know the Bible and you know the message, that's not enough. &gt;&gt; That's all right, but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit. You see that &gt;&gt; right in the middle brings you to the Holy Spirit. You can tell by the nature of most believers that that's about where they've come. But the Holy Spirit is a a personal experience of birth, a new birth, a regeneration, making a new creature in Christ. Hey, there there's no way that God could have loved me. That was supernatural. It was supernatural love that that he left the splendor of heaven to come to somebody that was ugly. That's why when you get the nature of Christ, there will be people that does things wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you'll just smile. Praise God. Said, "But they're living in sin." That's between them and God. &gt;&gt; They're angels talking to God about it. &gt;&gt; If Brother Dale calls up, when the angel's talking to Christ, it'll clog up the phone lines. Amen. Watch this. This is what I was preaching. A Old Testament covenant just covered the sin. We got to get this up here, Vicki. You got her. Thank you, Z. That's amazing. You don't have to take my word for this. That's what I was just saying. Old Testament covenant. It just covers sin. It never got rid of your anger. Never got rid of your temper. Never got rid of you mistreating the least beautiful, the little ones, the non-desirable. Never got rid of you having respects to the person. You're nice to your elders, but you are disrespectful to anybody that steps on your clothes. You never got rid of the sin desire. You can tell what covenant you're under by how you love. You thought I was making that up. If you are doing or saying or being mean, rude, hateful, fuss, arguing, showing lack of respect to indifferent, different times, it's the old covenant. Wow. The testament means covenant. The new testament means a new covenant. The old testament was old under the lambs. Let's go. Yeah, you got there. Lambs. Thank you, Vicki. Lambs. But that life could not come back on the believer because the animal. The reason it couldn't because they never had a soul. But the New Testament life was God, Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the lamb of God. And yeah, it could come back on us. That's a good thing because he's Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And his life comes back on me and now I'm not me no more. I'm him. Cuz what did Paul say? That's very Bible. Paul said it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me. So that means if it's no longer I that liveth but Christ lives in me. That means it'll only be but Christ betrayed &gt;&gt; which will be one word. &gt;&gt; Love. &gt;&gt; Amen. there. You show me one time where God never loved in the Bible. Every decision he made was love. Even when he put the people under persecution, it was to spread the gospel through the country. That was love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The New Testament, the lamb of God, his life comes back on us. The blood's life. Not the blood, the blood's life. The blood is the life of the new testament. The life is from the blood of the lamb which means the new testament &gt;&gt; covenant. God's covenant, God's perfect covenant was agape love. I'm not talking about watch. You got all this. You got this felio love which is just attraction. And you also have in leodysian age. Brother Bram talked about this and I I have it on here but I don't have it sorted out. But leodysian love is self love. Everything's about me, mine. I, oh, I, you, I, who? Don't I, oh, I. I'm not talking about those men corrupt love. I'm talking about love that you love the unloly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We already read this one about Paul. See, Paul was operating under intellectual faith. I I fear. God fears that even even every minister that was at John Danquist we heard preached on this right here touched on this I already had it my iPad so I had said he said Mark had said this he said you know when we first got the message and we were young we were killing everybody ah they're wrong they're wrong I shoot them shoot them we we know the truth don't you know that's it kill him oh they're off there and then we realize that the personality of Jesus was to bless. That's what he said. Bless. Show love. God bless you. God bless you. Blessings. Blessings. But there might be I It don't matter if you're in sin. Blessings. God bless you. God bless you. You're in sin. God bless you anyway. &gt;&gt; Said we realize. Did God send the message for us to just kill everybody? No. He sent us the message to love everybody. God bless you. God bless you to the stranger. God bless you to the people that have a different lifestyle. God bless you to everybody. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; How will that hurt them? It won't hurt them. That's what we're sent here for. &gt;&gt; That's the nature. That shows that you haven't just come to the Holy Spirit, but that you are the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference in the two covenants? &gt;&gt; Okay, we're close. &gt;&gt; See the difference? Yeah. &gt;&gt; The old covenant covered covered the ugly dale &gt;&gt; and then as soon as it was gone, you know, I I let me tell you another story. Now I'm exposing my life for you to see it. I can remember being at Pete and Roo Snow's place and Brigden and Hank Vroom Hank and Vroom was there and their boy did something that was I think going to hurt somebody and I and Blanch looked like I'd shot her. See, I was just covered. The old brother Dale was, "Hey, listen. You're there, too. You have to make a decision. Are you under the old covenant or the new one?" &gt;&gt; If I was under the new one, it would have been gone. Sister Julie would go gone. That couldn't have come on me cuz it wasn't there. But it was still there. So, it came out. &gt;&gt; I I actually think, you know, one of our kids was going to hurt somebody else. But, see, and and I I scared and hurt everybody's feelings cuz see, I just covered my sins. I just covered them saying, "Oh, bless God. I believe Brother Ram's a prophet. So is the devil. &gt;&gt; He trembles. I believe the message is true. So is the devil." He He knows it's true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember what they said? But he can't love. &gt;&gt; The devil. Oh, the devil believes the Bible's true. I believe the Bible's true. Yeah. Well, that ain't that great. You know, the devil believes it and trembles, but he can't love. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's The devil's come right up to the Holy Spirit, but he can't take it. Cuz if he did, then he'd be my brother. He wouldn't be the devil no more. And so you can tell by the nature. The nature. So watch this. Like watch this. So you know people that have trouble with little kids, you you always got to watch. The devil knows your weak spots. He studies you &gt;&gt; and so old other than me and sister Donna and and a few and and sister Patty, but like sometimes older people kids will disturb them. &gt;&gt; Guess who knows that? &gt;&gt; Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan knows that. So then when the kid ralls them up, you can tell what covenant they're under. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; See, because it's when that happens, you can tell whether it's covered or gone. It can't it if it's gone, if it's no longer me that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me, then it's gone. Because Christ said, "Forsake not the the little ones, but let them come unto me. For such is the kingdom of heaven. If you don't love the little ones, you're not even going to be in heaven." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see how you can tell what covenant you're under? &gt;&gt; One was imperfect and one's perfect. God's perfect. Amen. Amen. I got to hurry. So Paul, he had his intellectual faith. He knew what the word of God said. Watch this. He did. He was living under Moses law. &gt;&gt; Remember Stephen? They wanted to kill Stephen because Stephen was bringing grace. They stoned Stephen for obeying Jesus &gt;&gt; because they said he blasphemes the law of Moses. That spirit's still alive. Spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; So, you can still kill people that you don't think are following the prophet's message properly and and that just shows that you've only come to it, but you haven't become it. Oh, that's just unbelievable. &gt;&gt; I want to close with this story. And I have dozens more scriptures that I've never read once on love. &gt;&gt; So, it might be part four or whatever. Let's turn to Luke 7 36- 48. I want to close with this story. I already mentioned it, but I want to go into it in detail. Here, one of the Pharisees desired to have Jesus come to eat with them. He didn't really want him in his house. That's what brother Bram said, but he went to the Pharisee house, and he sat down with me. This was Christ. And behold, a woman of the city, second verse, 37, sorry, which was a sinner. Uh-oh. We know. We can pick out those sinners. They don't look like us. When she knew that Jesus was at the Pharisee house, she bought a box of ointment. What? What's that first word? Whatever that is, but a box of ointment. And she stood at the feet of Jesus behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with her tears and did wipe him with the hairs of her head and kiss his feet and anoint them. And the Pharisee now the Pharisee was the message believers of their day. Everybody agree with that? That was the church. So can I change that word to message believer? You can see the truth. But there and now the message believer which had bidden Jesus bidden him saw that he spake bitten Jesus saw that he spake within himself saying this man if he were Christ he was a lot more than a prophet. he was Jehovah. He would know who that man or woman was that's touching him. For she she's not worthy. She's a sinner. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Simon, good old Simon, you message believer, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he said, "Master, say on." He said, "Now there was a certain creditor that had debts, and one owned 500 p, and the other 50, and when they had nothing to pay, they frankly forgave both. Tell me therefore, which one will love the most?" And Simon, the message believer, the Pharisee, answered and said, Well, I suppose he that was forgiven the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast judged, thou has rightly judged. And he turned to the woman and said unto him, said unto Simon, "Seeest thou this woman? I entered into thine I entered into thine house and thou gave me no water for my feet but she washed my feet with her tears. You wiped them with her hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss but the woman since the time I have came in has not ceased to kiss my feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let's just stop there. &gt;&gt; Is this the Bible? Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this Jesus talking? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is Jesus God? &gt;&gt; That's gross. &gt;&gt; If you seen somebody showing that much respect to anybody in the church, you'd be grossed out. You tell them to stop. &gt;&gt; Do you know? You know, they were mentioning I I'm gonna just stop here for a sec. Stay right there, Vicki. I want to show you something. you know, he mentioned, you know, I I believe one of the brothers in the weekend, he said, you know, when David was being sought by Saul to be killed and and Bethlehem was seized by the the enemy and he was on the mountaintop and he looked down into Bethlehem and there he played as a kid and and where he'd played ball and soccer and drunk at the well of Jerusalem and all this place and maybe it was, you know, where he grew up, you know, and he looked down and he said, "Oh, Oh, he said, "I wished I could just get a drink from that well." And David's soldiers were not Jews. See, the Jews, see, the Bible says the prophets poorly received in his own land. &gt;&gt; So, David's own people never accepted him. &gt;&gt; Watch this. I mean, God's trying to show you something. David's own family never accepted him. &gt;&gt; His brothers mocked him and his dad mocked him. He said, "Well, there's just a squirt left watching the sheep." &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch this. Watch the nature. Watch the nature. But that little squirt, David's angel was reporting to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, watch that. Remember, the next time you want to flip out on somebody, their angel takes it to the white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; Ouch. But this is what I wanted to bring up when I mentioned this. David was like David was not king. David was anointed going to be anointed king or he was anointed to be king, but it was like the bride. I'm going to I preached that before here in the early spring after the new year. The bride's anointing. Dave here. David was anointed to be king, but he never had a throne, never had a kingdom, never had an army. It's like the bride of Christ. But the foreigners that were not Jews recognized that David was the anointed of God. And this is what I want to get to you. This they were like the Gentiles to the Jews. We were pagan by religion, but we recognized that's why we were grafted in because we recognize that Jesus was the Christ. And there Jesus' own family, his very own people, nailed him on the cross, the Jews. Now watch this. But to those people, David's least command, least desire, sorry. Sorry I messed that up. David's least desire was a command to them. That's like this woman right here. They Jesus desire was that he would get his feet washed and he would get a kiss on his feet. Like normally they would kiss your cheek and wash your feet. And the message people, Simon, the Pharisees, they only wanted Jesus there for popularity, but they hated him. Amen. They hated him. But to Jesus, his least desire was somebody that was a sinner. But to David, his least desire was, "Oh, I yearn for a drink of water from the well that I played around." And the the men that weren't even Jews fought their way down, brought the water back to David. It was just it was just a common remark. I could sure use a hand. It was like, "No problem. I'll be there. Wow. You never get that response in the Bible from the same land as the priesthood. See, Jesus own people rejected him. David's own people rejected him as king. His own family rejected him. He had to go to another country. Watch this. Watch what David or what Jesus says. She has kissed my feet and my head with oil. Thou didest not anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Verse 47. Wherefore I say unto you, her sins which were many, we would have judged her for. We would not have showed love and we would have been rebuked if she would have come up and talked to the pastor and washed his shoes are forgiven. For she loved much because whom little is given, the same loveth little. And he said unto her, "Thy sins are forgiven." Let's just read that. For she loved much, because whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. I wonder I wonder if people that were born in this message, never went out in the world and sinned and they were always a goody to choose, always did what was right, can love God the way he wants it because they don't feel like they really ever were forgiven. the people that love God the most. You know, watch this. I'm closing. The angels can't worship God like we can &gt;&gt; because they weren't forgiven of anything. &gt;&gt; They can sing better, but they weren't forgiven. But when the forgiven get to heaven and they worship not just their king but their savior, &gt;&gt; you see &gt;&gt; to whom much is forgiven can love much. &gt;&gt; Wow. Just let that sink in. And we would look down on those people because we feel like in our flesh we're better than them. But to Christ were actually second. Cuz there's no way that a person that's been forgiven very little can love the same as somebody that don't feel like they deserve it. Unending love. that God should love a sinner such as I. You can come honey. Such love. Such unbelievable love. Such undeserving love. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the nature of the Holy Spirit. Love. You know, there's there's the Bible's full of examples. You know, look at, you know, in David's kingdom when the the one young man tricked the girl in to come and and bring her food and that was in David's family. I don't this is just fresh anointing. Amen. And and and it was wrong. It was simple what he did. But David judged the people that that that judged that as sin because yes, it was wrong. See, God, watch this. When love goes forth, grace covers it. Love covers sin. &gt;&gt; And the atonement for sin was love. The atonement for a wrong was grace. Adultery, incest, anything that it's wrong. It's flat wrong. But when sovereign love went forth, sovereign grace took over. When love went forth, sovereign grace took over. It's God's love that covers our sins. It's not the judgment of the righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch that. Now, I'm not promoting sin, but that was Christ himself that showed that example. &gt;&gt; And so, watch this. When when the woman was brought to Jesus in the very act and and there the Pharisees, back to the message believers, they said, "Well, look at that. We caught her." And your Bible says she shouldn't be allowed to have a position in the church. Actually, what they said is your Bible says that she deserves to be stoned. And Jesus wrote on the sand and they still portrayed him. They said, "Let's kill her. She's got to be killed. That's what your Bible says. Let's kill her." And Jesus was looking at the covering. He was looking at election. He was looking through love. But all the message believers, the Pharisees, that was that was the message of the day. The Pharisees of the day was the was the truth. That was Moses law. Moses was a prophet. But God was changing depositions and he was going from law to grace. He was going from imperfect to perfect. He was going from the prophets to Jehovah and they missed it. And they wanted to judge her because they knew her faults and they knew her life. And God said, "I forgive her because I have love." Love. Not that I have love. I am love. &gt;&gt; I don't have it. I actually am it. Love. Amazing love. I tell you, next week we're going to when we pick up on this love again, I'm going to I'm going to show you some of them stories of David where we're blighting blighting evil sins. David said, "Let it go." Because he was a father that was a man after God's own heart and he had love. And he had love say wrong. Yeah, that's wrong. But love covered it. Love covered it. [Music] It wasn't Jesus blood that saved you. It was his love that saved you. It was the life in the blood. It was the nature of the blood was love. I deserved hell. You deserved hell. But love said no. Love said no. Not this one. Amazing love. What covenant are we living under? the old one or the new one. Very clear to see. Just watch somebody's life. You know, there was a a man that got killed here recently and he was he was given good advice to a young couple and I I am actually trying to close. He said, "Before you marry somebody, you should go on a long road trip with them." [Music] and watch somebody cut them off and see what covenant they're under. Watch them run out of money when they're at the restaurant and their debit card don't work. Watch them get a bad waitress. And he said, "Now that's the person you're going to live with." [Music] Because see, when they're under the pressure, [Music] it'll show if it's gone or just covered. [Music] If it's covered, it's just we just came to the Holy Spirit, but we are not the Holy Spirit. But if it's gone, nothing out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. The joys of a child is he just speaks exactly what mom and dad said at home in secret. They just come to church and say, "Well, the cow died and the truck ran into the tree." And they're like, "Oh, I wish they would have heard that." But that's what's recorded in heaven. Dad kicked the cat. That's cuz what they seen. They're just saying it honestly. You're hiding it because you're under the old covenant. But if it's gone, [Music] it's in the sea of forgetfulness. I can't find it anymore. It can't come up cuz out of the abundance of the heart, I can't say it cuz it it ain't there. That memory's gone. Says, "Wow, [Music] help me, Jesus. [Music] Think about his love. Think about his love. Think about his [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Praise the Lord. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Praise the name. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Let's sing that song. Love lifted me. And just while Vickiy's finding that, I want to share something with you. Amen. That was quick. The Bible says that if you love those that love you, don't the Pharisees also pretty easy. But if you love the people that hate you, shows what covenant you're under. If you show love the people that have hurt you or disappointed you, shows what covenant you're under. Amen. Wow. Let's sing this song. longer be dismissed. I was saying g [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat, [Music] [Music] heat. Oh, [Music] [Music] heat, heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Oh, heat, [Music] heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Oh, lovely. [Music] Yeah. Heat.
