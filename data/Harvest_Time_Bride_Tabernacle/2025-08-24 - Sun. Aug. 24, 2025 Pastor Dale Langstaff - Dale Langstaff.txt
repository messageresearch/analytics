We want to minister on the family this morning and the the home and the household and and just God's uh desire for uh peace in the home and and the family and just kind of goes along with the the dedication. Psalms 127 3:5 children are inheritage of the Lord. The fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth. Happy is a man who has his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but shall speak in the enemy's camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn over to Matthew 18 and 10. Amen. Matthew 18 and 10. Take heed that ye despise not these little ones. For I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of the Father which is in heaven. Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll bless your word this morning. And may you may you take this thought and may you rest it on your people and all of us. And may it may it help us Lord God to to come to a maybe uh for maybe for just some of us maybe a different spot and maybe some are already there and doing and it will encourage them to know that God's already brought them to this place Lord God and help us all Lord God be with the speaker Lord God &gt;&gt; and be with the hearer Lord God that they could just receive the words from heaven not from a man and from your word Lord God we pray in Jesus name.

You can face the audience. Yeah. Face the audience. Amen. Uh Vicki, we need a camera that works. Oh, there we go, brother. Oh, sorry. Sorry. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. We're so excited to be dedicating our daughter Kaziah Isabella today. Um it's really true when you're going to be doing something for the Lord. Satan tries to discourage you or attack you and she hasn't been feeling the best the last couple days and I've had some health trials too. But we're going to be here and we're going to praise him anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we're going to share his testimony because her story truly it was a testimony of the Lord before she was even conceived. And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I really love writing poetry. My mom wrote poetry and I just love writing poems. It's a very natural way that I express myself. And so I wrote her story and her testimony in a poem. And I would love to share that with you this morning. and all glory be to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kaziah Isabella Omillian, God had your story begin before the foundation of the world. He gave your earthly father a vision that around his hand your fingers would be curled. In the vision daddy was holding you, rivers of emotions running down his face. A dark gray shirt he was wearing. You were content and warm in his embrace. A month before we knew about you, I said in a month's time in faith, we'd see a positive test. In April, we found out we were expecting to have three children and a fourth on the way, we were blessed. We chose not to find out if you were a girl or a boy. Whatever the Lord Jesus had in his plan would surely give us the most joy. Closer to when you were due, they said the fluid was too high. They wanted to induce and take your birth into their own hands, but we had faith that God our needs would supply. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Weeks later, our midwife came into the room smiling. She said, "You don't have polyhydramnio anymore. Your fluid levels are completely normal. In my whole career, I've never seen this before." Our Lord Jesus performed a miracle, but in their books, 41 weeks was still too late. I prayed to have the birthday Jesus had planned for you as Jehovah Gyra always has the perfect time and date. Daddy also said no boys names were needed. He was sure a girl was next and God sure made him clever. We picked your name Kaziah Isabella which symbolizes a restored life pledged to God forever. Daddy came downstairs with a smirk on his face. He said the gray shirt he put on was from the vision. He told me, "You have 24 hours to have our baby." And how beautiful that his faith was speaking God's decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Within about 15 hours of that moment, God said it was time. How beautiful it is when a miracle occurs. That is incredibly divine. You arrived in 4 hours and you were born in the veil. What a perfect type of the bride of Christ. He surely does never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Daddy held you in the gray shirt just as God had shown him earlier that year. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that God you will always love and to him be near. &gt;&gt; Every good and every perfect gift is from above. And nothing shall separate you from our God's love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward. Thank you Lord for giving us Kaziah Isabella Omillion, a sweet and precious little girl. We will teach her your ways and your truth in her life and to follow you with every word, every step, and every little twirl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's beautiful. Amen. Yeah. Brother Lori and Sister Sheila maybe can come and stand beside brother Jeff. And I I don't know if somebody's Yeah, you fig Yeah, pictures are Yeah. Amen. Vicki, we need somebody taking pictures or Amy or Tim or somebody. Julie, somebody got a camera. Amy does. Amen. Amen. Pictures are history. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pictures like history. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. You know, I have a little message for Jeff and DMA. You know, we believe that our children come from God. Amen. And we come out of the side of God and God had to trust us to send us your angel. If God wouldn't have trusted us, he wouldn't have gave us a part of him. And when he added us with children's, it was a double blessing because not only did he trust you enough, but he trusted you to to nurture and raise, take care of somebody that would raise up a child in the way you'll go, and when they're old, they won't depart from us. God has great confidence, great confidence in you both. Amen. God would have never blessed you if he didn't know the end from the beginning. Amen. It's great. Great confidence. Amen. Little Casiah, do you want to come to Bert Hill? Yes. You can look at your mama. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we just come this morning. And Lord, we just love you. And Lord, we thank you for election. And Lord, we thank you for little Casiah here and the election that she came from you. And you you sent her the parents that were elected, Lord God. and and you trusted her parents so much that that you would send a beautiful angel that they could nurture and guide and protect, Lord God, until until she received her own Holy Ghost and and you would be able to take care of her in adulthood, Lord God. And Lord, we bless this little child, Lord God. and we give her back to you, Lord God, just as a a token of our love that we thank you for trusting us enough to raise her and love her and and Lord God, we bless you and we thank you for this blessing. Thank you for the children. Thank you for the whole family, Lord God. Lord God, and especially this morning, we thank you for this little daughter of God, little Casiah, Lord God. We pray you'll bless her and keep her pure and holy, Lord God. And may she be an amazing sister of your family, Lord God, we pray. And bless the mom and dad and the grandparents and the brother, Lord God, and all even the church, all that will guide and help them to nurture this family and this little girl. And we give you the glory and honor for it, Lord Jesus. And your beautiful name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Which one of you boys want to help me preach? Amen. God bless you. Bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. You know, I remember the time when brother Jeff and Sister Damla were in this exact same church building and they were praying for kids. Amen. God is so wonderful. You know, God sometimes waits. We wonder why he's waiting for the right time. &gt;&gt; God's never late and he's never early. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And his time is right. I want to look in a scripture that we haven't read yet. Ephesians 5:15-21. Maybe you can turn there and we'll just lay a foundation of our thing. And you know when our message and you know when we minister this message and I'm going to try God kind of uh just you know talking to me and and you know in meditation and speaking you know anytime we minister a message it's not for everybody. Some people are already there. Some people are you know past that in life. Some people are past that spiritually in their life. And and you know, sometimes we have to be patient with the family because a part of the family might need something that somebody else don't need nothing to do with. Amen. And this message is going to be completely like that. If you're if you're a grandma or you're in a different state of life, maybe this message won't mean the same to you. But there's ones here that are right in the middle of their family or maybe about to start a family and it'll mean a lot to them. And and also, you know, well, you know, when a minister, if you you know, this the same line, but you know, if we're we're speaking against uh something that's wrong in in our lives, it's never everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just for whoever God intended it for. &gt;&gt; And so, we should never be offended. Not that we are, not that you are, but we should never be offended at the word of God. Lots of time when the minister's preaching, he's preaching to himself. cuz God's dealt with him in his own spiritual walk. God said, "You you aren't quite as far along as you think you are." &gt;&gt; And you need to preach this message to the people to change me. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's never intended to hurt or to to uh you know come across that way. Amen. But let's look in this scripture and and we want to talk about the family and we want to talk about the family environment. And I believe that God and and our prophet brother Bram has some amazing stuff here that we can learn. We see then that you walk circumspectly and not as fools. Now in this scripture, God's going to give us some counsel of how to live. He's saying walk circumspectly but not as fools. But you should be wise. Now the only the kind of wise he's talking about is wise in himself. &gt;&gt; Redeeming the time before the days are evil. Therefore being not unwise but understanding that the will of the Lord is I I want to preach on but understanding what the will of the Lord is for a family. And you know if we have a you know in the nation if you have a healthy family you have a healthy nation. But definitely spiritually speaking, if we have a healthy family, we'll have a healthy family church cuz you bring all that health that that that wealth of health &gt;&gt; into the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Understanding what the will of the Lord is. Now, this scripture really the first part really doesn't affect us, but it just I have to read it to get the end. Be not drunk with wine, where is his access, but be filled with the spirit. We're supposed to be filled with the spirit. And and you know when we get into this part, we should live our life. This is in Ephesians and in Colossians both. We're going to read this. Speaking to yourself with psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing, making me in your heart unto the Lord. Now, you know, here here it's twice in the Bible and the New Testament. And I'm going to show you how important worship is to God. And even worship in your home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It changes the atmosphere. It &gt;&gt; does. That's right. &gt;&gt; Making melodies in your heart to the Lord. Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus. Submitting yourself one to another in the fear of God. Now, that don't leave none of us out. A minister has to submit himself to God and the people and God's word. If a minister is only preaching his own thoughts and own ideas, oh, you better run for your life cuz it'll be distract. It'll be just disaster, &gt;&gt; cementing ourselves one to another in the fear of the Lord. And this verse 32, and this is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Now here here it went into the wedding vows and couples and and all this about and I just skipped that but I speak concerning Christ in the church. Nevertheless, let every one of us in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife to reverence her husband. Amen. You know the word of God is so beautiful and so perfect. And we see here, we already read our scripture in Psalms, how children are a heritage of the Lord. And I want to go to Colossians 3 12 and 21. Now, when God has something important to say, he repeats it. at verse 12. Put on therefore, this is only for a certain class of people as the elect of God. Now, he's narrowing in on who he's talking to. Holy and beloved, bows of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, and longsuffering. You know our prophet said that the only people that will have love in the end times is the elect. &gt;&gt; The elect. &gt;&gt; Nobody else will have love. &gt;&gt; The opposite of love is hatred. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forbearing one another, forgiving one another. And if any man has a quarrel with any, even as Christ forgave you, also ye do forgive them. Above all these things, put on charity, for it which is abounds of perfectness, and let peace of God rule in your heart, which is also ye are called in one body to be ye thankful. But we are called to be one, but we're in two. We're called to be one body, but we're multiple bodies here. represented this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And be ye thankful and let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each one another. Oh, here we go again. In Psalms, wait, you already read that scripture, Brother Dale. This is a different scripture. and in hymns and in spiritual singing and songs of singing with grace with grace and your heart to the Lord and whatsoever you do do in word and deed do all in the name of Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him and you know we can let's just uh drop to verse 18 and I'm just I'm laying a foundation showing how God expects the atmosphere to be in our home. You know, Brother Bam, and I'm going to read this. Brother Bam said, "We're we if we came from God, God was the only creator, but when we came from God, that makes us creators." And we create the atmosphere that you want to live in. He said, you know, and you know this, there's people that you just love being around &gt;&gt; and there's people you don't want you avoid. &gt;&gt; And it's because of their atmosphere that they choose &gt;&gt; to create. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch this. In the Bible, hospitality is not natural. Hospitality is a gift. &gt;&gt; If you can make somebody feel welcome in a strange place, it's not natural. It's a gift. &gt;&gt; It's a gift of God. Amen. Verse 18. Husbands, submit yourselves to your wives. Sorry. Submit yourselves to your husbands as it is fit in the Lord. And husbands, love your wives. and be not bitter against them. And children, verse 20, children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord. Children, obey your parents. They've been farther down the road. They can see an accident coming. You should respect them enough to obey your parents. But he counteracts that. The very next verse, fathers, much of this message today, even when we go into the the the prophet will be to the fathers. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger unless they be discouraged. Amen. how we live our lives and correct our children and and every one of us, you know, had our children, some of us when we were younger, you're not a human if you didn't make mistakes, but you you can correct them. You're a Christian if you can say, "Hey, I made a mistake here, and from this day forward, I can live and do better." Amen. Ephesians 6 1:4. I'm just I'm just literally laying a foundation before I get into the atmosphere of a home. Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother, which this is the first commandment of promise. Now, I want to talk to the children for a second. And this goes with adult children, too. It doesn't mean your mom and dad are right all the time. It might not mean they're right ever, but you're still commanded &gt;&gt; to honor and respect them. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; To honor somebody that you know can be dad wrong, you still honor and respect your parents. For this is the first commandment with promise, that your days may be long, that you may be well with thee, and thou may live long on the earth. And ye fathers, now see, we said something before. Anytime God's got something important, he repeats it. &gt;&gt; We already read this verse. No, this is a different verse. Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath. Now, God said that twice because fathers have a tendency to push your kids into wrath, &gt;&gt; anger, &gt;&gt; hopelessness. Amen. If that wasn't the case, you know, he never once mentioned that about mothers because mothers have the nurturing instinct and fathers have the command instinct. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So they think a father thinks that everything can be fixed by beating it. &gt;&gt; That's not the case. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Now what was the nurture and admonition of the Lord? that you would wake up and sing hymns and songs and medalities &gt;&gt; unto the Lord giving praise for all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch here the prophet and I I want to before I read this quote this this just blessed me and this quote is what hurts our families and it hurts our church family and God forgive me for any mistakes I've ever made. But I want to tell you this. This is a quote from 59. And how plain the prophet is in this quote. If this was the case then it's a million times worse today. Like how many of you would agree that in 59 it was pretty tame? Like the world, the government, sin. I mean, like, &gt;&gt; 59, we were still having a major revival around most of the known world. &gt;&gt; In 59, watch what the prophet says. He said the experience of the juniper tree. You all know the story of the prophet Elijah though. He sat under the juniper tree and he said, "Lord, kill me. Life is too much for me." He said, "There's many of us that find oursel under the juniper tree and I get myself under there many times myself to the place that I don't even know what to do." You're so frustrated. And frankly, I hope you catch this. This is your prophet in 59. He was blunt honest. He said, "And frankly, I'm right under there right now. How could a man of God be so frustrated and so in turmoil and so tore up that he was sitting under a juniper tree and he said, "I'm wondering, oh God, what would you have me to do?" There's nobody alive that God didn't show more than our prophet &gt;&gt; and tell him what to do. There's nobody breathing that even comes close to that. &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, many people are under the juniper tree, this the next paragraph, like Elijah, and they like to sleep. And I preach to more tired people than to anybody in the world. This is the prophet in 59. that did signs and wonders and prayer lines in almost every service. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine going to sleep when you seen like eyes that there was not even an eye socket and God cared about the color of the eye and limbs? &gt;&gt; Watch what he says it is. It's just not sleep. People are so tired they are mentally strained. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a news flash this morning. You are mentally strained &gt;&gt; and that's and I am more than mentally strained &gt;&gt; because our world is insane &gt;&gt; and there's so much pulling everywhere. Where is there not a war going on in the world or ships? Do you know the states just bombed some of China's land by the Philippines? Do you know the states is going to South America to take on another country there? &gt;&gt; Did Did anybody know that? Do you know that China shot a missile at US, one of their dearest planes? They only have six in the world last week. You didn't know that. Mentally strained. The world is insane. It's an island that China claims and the Philippines claim and China has a base on it and the states oblivated it. We are mentally. Even if you never listen to the news, &gt;&gt; the tension in the grocery store &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; is like to snap. &gt;&gt; Do you know like half the people in Ontario or 30% are behind on their rent or their mortgage payments? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, people are deciding on paying the car payment or buying food, &gt;&gt; mentally strained. &gt;&gt; It's an envir it's a world that we're living in. He said it's not just how he said people are so mentally strained until they're filling this is in 59. Can you insane institutions? I'll just tell you what. I wasn't born in 59 yet. I was born for nine more years. How in the world was this the case then? And see how drastic it is today. We're filling in stained institutions and hospitals everywhere. and they went to such a nervous condition until they don't know what they do believe or what they want and they're just laying there and they don't know what to do. And oh, it's such a sad sight. It's the pressure that's coming in on the elect. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I God's just saying this is the environment of the world that we're building in the the by by what you know whatever you would the pressure of of making a living the pressure of raising your kids the pressure of of being uh godly and spiritual in a wicked world in a Sodom Gomorrah and and and I mean now I I respect we're all in different situations of this And the family is tore apart because the dad's trying to make a living. The mother's trying to teach the kids and there ain't no time for nobody. Human time is not even in the equation. You know, I was driving the tractor yesterday and right across the road from us, our neighbors died. And they've lived there our my whole life. They lived there when my dad bought the farm when I was 10. A matter of fact, she taught kindergarten when I was in grade two at East Sombra School. and T died July 1st, 93 years old. And she died 3 or 4 days ago, almost to the day, 6 weeks later. Both 93. And you know, I was remembering everything they did on that farm, you know, fix the tow drains, take out a tree, and all that. They were good people. &gt;&gt; They were Catholic, but they were good people. I remember our kids when they were young inviting them to church, inviting them and uh they said no, they said we have our own church that we go to. But I thinking I was thinking when I was on that I said you know anything they did on that farm don't matter one lick. &gt;&gt; It don't matter one lick. You know anything you do on this earth it don't matter one lick because their kids are are far apart. That farm's going to be sold and it don't matter if it brings 1 million, 2 million, or three million. The kids are just going to sell it and it's going to be sold. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with being a farmer and being in the country, &gt;&gt; but we can destroy our family building kingdoms. &gt;&gt; Ministers have destroyed churches because they built kingdoms. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can, you know, you can go anywhere with that. Schools have destroyed themselves because they made their school the model for the world. &gt;&gt; You know, we're we're here for such a short time. &gt;&gt; And only what's done for Christ &gt;&gt; will last. &gt;&gt; That's right. And most of us the number one thing you unless you're a brother Brandham which there's not very many brother Brandhams around &gt;&gt; well there's no brother you know what I'm saying &gt;&gt; the biggest thing you'll do for Christ is your children &gt;&gt; your children &gt;&gt; and your grandchildren. If you're a minister and you're going around the world and your family serving the devil, you done lost your commission. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it couldn't happen. But if you can't save your next door neighbor, why would you save somebody in Ecuador? Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you can't influence the people that are your closest to you to to to be godly, then how are you going to influence people that don't even know you or seen you before? &gt;&gt; And this neurotic, insane age, that's the pressure. You know, God has chose not for the rapture to happen yet. And the Bible promises us, we have a great hope that he will shorten the days or there would be no or it's possible, but it's not possible that no elect would be saved. You know, I've said multiple times I never believed we'd still be here to see what we're here seeing. I'm not I'm not saying but I'm saying in our world I'm not we can't change the world but you can change your world &gt;&gt; and you can't change the world but you can change every parent sitting here can change the world for your kids &gt;&gt; and not only that it's your responsibility and you will be judged &gt;&gt; on how you change the world for your kids because your kids can't do that. Amen. My very next scripture in my notes was Matthew 18 that we read already 10. Take heed that you despise not the little ones. For I say unto you that the angel is sitting before the throne of God and he let your heavenly father know every time you mistreat him. Ouch. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 3. I I want to read just some different scriptures here, but it's the end that I want to get to. Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your husband, that if any obey not the word, that's if your husband did obey not the word, that they may be one that they may be without the word, one by your conversation of your wife. That means that if if a wife has a non-believing husband and the husband never asks the Lord for forgiveness that he can be saved by the wife and how she creates an atmosphere in the home. &gt;&gt; Now let me just tell you something wives that's powerful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean you can actually bypass the law of God for asking your husband for ask and forgiveness and you can dictate his eternal destination &gt;&gt; by how you carry and speak. [Music] &gt;&gt; Remember the story of brother Bram the drunker that was in the bar and said there ain't no Christians left. And an amazing, you know, the husband that was there in the bar drinking, he knew his wife was real, although he wasn't living the life. And he said, "Well, I know one wife that's a Christian." They said, "Nope." They said, "They're all hypocrites. They all go to this church." And he said, "I know them all and they're no good for nothing." He said, "Well, I'll prove it to you. Let's go home." And he said, "Let's pretend we're real drunk. You know the story. She cooked his favorite meal, the only thing that was in the house, eggs, cuz they were cheap. He smashed them on the floor and made a huge mess. That husband needed a punch in the face. &gt;&gt; But that's not what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; And she got down and they went outside and they said, "Now, now came the real test." And she got down cleaning up the mess that she had no business &gt;&gt; on logical thinking to clean up. And she said, "Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free? For there's a cross for everyone to bear and there's a cross for me." &gt;&gt; The husband outside said, "See, I told you she was real." &gt;&gt; See, I told you they was real. That's what the world's waiting for. See, I told you those people were real. They're kind of cuckoo, but I told you they're real. Wow. And while they behold your chase conversation coupled with fear. Verse four. But let the hidden man of the heart which is not corruptible, even the &gt;&gt; ornament of the meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God. Great price. Our homes should be a haven. Your home for your kids is the only haven outside of church, but it's a main haven that they'll have in this world. &gt;&gt; And it should be peace. There shouldn't There's no scriptures that you could have conflict of any kind in a home. Children are built for conflict. Let me say it again. Children are not built for conflict. Children cannot understand how mom and dad can be out of conflict. Children do not understand that the main purpose of the man is the head, but he's he's the bread winner and and he he's concerned that the bills are paid, but the wife is concerned that the environment and the nurturing and everything's nice. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Great price is meek and qual spirit. God don't consider a bossy anybody special. But after the manner of the old time, the holy women also who trusted God adorned themselves being subject unto their own husband. And I took that scripture out. But it was Sarah that called Abraham her Lord. She worshiped her husband, called her her Lord. And verse seven, but likewise husbands, be ye husbands, dwell with them according to the knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, is unto the weaker vessel, being hes together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered. Now, I want to show you something. We're always trying to show the different roles of a man and a woman, and in the flesh, that's the truth. But in the spirit it's not the truth because here it says as being joint hes together &gt;&gt; you can't what's the Bible say that the two the twain may be one &gt;&gt; twain must be one you're you're you're heirs of the inheritance of God together. So husbands, you can be as spiritual as woohoo. You're making it without your wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of the grace of life that your prayers may not be hindered. I wonder sometimes when our prayers aren't answered if it's because our hidden life is corrupt. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know what that corruption would be? Meanness. &gt;&gt; Just plain meanness. Just plain rude. &gt;&gt; It says meekness was of a great price. Humble and meekness. You know, brother Brown said that if you show me a church, and I'm going to say this with a family. If you show me a church that's humble, real humble, just really, really humble, I'll show you a church that's got the power and the presence of God in it. Let's just put that in the home. If you show me a home that's humble, that respect is there, and it's humble and humility and and and and you know what? When you get married, it's not like my business and my job and my career. And that's the problem with everything. There's no more my when you get married. It's ours. It's our career. It's our home. It's our bank account. &gt;&gt; It's our dreams. &gt;&gt; It's our plans. &gt;&gt; But in most homes, it's my plans. &gt;&gt; Her home. My home. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if we change that word of my to ours, that we're joined together in the inheritance of God, &gt;&gt; it'll change the atmosphere &gt;&gt; in the home. I want to show you another thought that our prophet brought out and this is this is just a beautiful thought and it's a fairly long one but he finishes it on us brothers. Amen. Us brothers need to listen. You know that we're all creators because we're a part of God and you're a son of God. You're the offspring of God. a daughter of God. That's right. So, you're a creator. And he talks about, he said, "Do you ever see people you just love to be around because they create a nice atmosphere." And he said here the next verse he said now my wife he said we had people running in and out of the house because brother Brown was a called prophet and people came to get prayed for and God answered his prayer miraculously and and people were involved in the ministry of God in a tremendous way and he said I came home and people had been in and out of the house and and she couldn't even live her normal life as being a housewife. She couldn't take care of her kids. She was she was continually answering the doorbell. The kids hadn't been fed. You know, the table hadn't been wiped off. The house looked like a pig pen. And the kids felt and looked worse. And he said, "I came in the house and I I want to show you this something too, brothers." He puts all the onus on the mad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, 'I come in the kitchen and my wife was crying. The children were crying and not she never even had a chance to cook them all through the day. And the little kitties and the little girls there, Sarah and Rebecca, they were crying and they were going on. My wife's crying and Billy just I'm just I'm just going crazy. Well, I want to just tell you something. This is a this is a this is an old quote. This isn't in the 50s. Yes. &gt;&gt; And this is the case where most of us in our home feel like we're going crazy to keep up with everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going crazy and I just don't know what I'm going to do, she said. And here she was gayheaded at 34 years of age. And brother Bam said, "Oh, that's right. Well, you know that's right, honey." And he said, "I never I don't never ever fuss with her." Can you imagine saying in a home that the kids had never ever seen the husband and wife fuss? That that would be quite a home. &gt;&gt; But you know, parents, &gt;&gt; you can do your business of fussing outside of the kids' ears. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can do it at 3:00 when you know they're sound asleep or take a drive. Your car won't be bugged. Your kids probably don't know how to do that yet. &gt;&gt; I don't never fuss with her. He said, "That's right, honey. It's very bad that you're serving all these people. You're serving. and we're serving the Lord and I'm doing all the time what's in my heart and I'm trying to create here's the brother Bram say I'm trying to create a different atmosphere and they're all nervous and they're all tore up and you know when God laid this on my heart for the family I thought you know that's the atmosphere in many homes I don't mean all homes but many homes on certain days maybe your home's perfect all month, but two or three days before the first of the month when you got to make the mortgage payment, the car payment, the rent payment, the hydro payment, the gas payment, and the and the visa payment, and then the and the other payment, the internet payment, and the &gt;&gt; just ain't enough payment. &gt;&gt; And inside the home becomes a nervous, tore up &gt;&gt; atmosphere. I I want I want to give you a a a highlight. Your kids don't understand. The kids have no clue what you're tore up about. All the kids the kids could care less about the gas, the hydro, the water, the sewer bill, the the car payment, the house payment. That all they want is harmony. They want harmony in Christ. That's all they want. That's why. And you know, I was talking to a minister this week. That's why when you go to the the poorest places in the world there everybody sitting on their front porch if they have a front porch or they're sitting on the side of the road and they're just like they don't have nothing but they got something you can't buy with money. That's harmony. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They got harmony. &gt;&gt; Now this is the prophet talk. Now I was thinking in my heart, oh Lord, now send your presence and send your love to my poor little tore up wife. Now I want to say, you know, your marriage might be perfect, but I doubt it was more perfect than the prophet's marriage. Now, if his wife could get tore up, I mean, I know he was a minister of God, but it wasn't no physical. He wasn't building a kingdom of himself. He was in complete obedience to the leading of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So even being under the leading of the Holy Spirit, you you you can be your family can be tore up. Moses was he forgot to do the law of God. His wife had to do it for him. She said, "You're a bloody husband to me and God would have killed him." &gt;&gt; It was a wife that saved the husband's life. &gt;&gt; Yes, dear. That's right. Here's brother Brandham agreeing that they're all tore up. He said, "Yes, that's right. That's right. This here." He said, "I haven't got anything." She said, "I haven't got anything to eat." And I said, "Well, there probably won't be nobody coming around for a couple hours. Let's get something to eat and I'll help you." He said, I started rolling up my sleeves. Started rolling up my sleeves and Brother Bram was going to start cooking. Now, right here, I I want to change the message and I want to change to a different message and I'm going to come back to that thought here. Here, Brother Bram says, he said in my heart, the next paragraph, Vicki, it's right in line. He said, Lord, I'm giving my love of God into my wife. And now, Lord, if you'll help me now here, I want your spirit now. And his very next sentence was, "And Satan would get us all confused, but I want you to help me." And I say, "Now, dear, I'll help you wash the dishes." And I'll get out there and I'll say, "Now, you just start with the children like say something there." And I'm standing there all the time praying now. Lord, send your Holy Spirit. I know it's quickening them right now. And I'm sending it. Watch. Watch how the prophets praying. He said, "I'm sending it into this home, my home, in the name of your son, &gt;&gt; Jesus." Do you know how he was sending that presence into his home? By rolling up his sleeve and saying, "Honey, &gt;&gt; step aside. I can do the dishes. &gt;&gt; Step aside. I can lighten your burden. Do &gt;&gt; you know I told some families in Africa, you know, where the wives were, and I don't mean, sorry, I I shouldn't have said the country. Forgive me. Forgive me. It's not Africa. Say it anywhere. Where the wives are respected to do everything for the kids. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a news flash. That's disgusting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's disgusting. They're not your wife's kids. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know whose blood those kids are carrying? &gt;&gt; Daddy's. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you see some men that they go off and they're doing their own kingdom, doing nothing to be assistants. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And their wife is dying. Dying. Dying &gt;&gt; under the burden. and responsibility of the kids. Guess who will be held accountable in the day of judgment? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not your wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not your wife at all. &gt;&gt; Yes. She has a spirit of nurturing. Yes. My wife changed most of the diapers. I changed every diaper that was completely necessary. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know, when my wife had all the babies at home, we got a nanny. I did 100% of the laundry. I cooked half the meals. &gt;&gt; I knew what a broom was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And some men married servants. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Slaves. &gt;&gt; And they and the wives never signed up for that. They signed up for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A wife's all about fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and and being together. They could care less if you have a big Most wives could care less how big your kingdom is. They want date night. &gt;&gt; They want relationship. Wives are about relationships. Men are about bank accounts. &gt;&gt; Wives don't care about bank accounts. &gt;&gt; You know, in the places and many country, half the world does it. The wife sits separate from the men. &gt;&gt; You can't show me one scripture for that. &gt;&gt; And the whole purpose of that is so the wives take care of all the kids. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's slavery. &gt;&gt; I've been to a couple places in my life and I've never one time in my life seen kids sitting on man's side. No, &gt;&gt; not one time. &gt;&gt; Atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Your wife couldn't have a good attitude in that situation if she was a saint. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; because you've just put her through the pig pen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Let's go back to our original quote. He said, "I started rolling up my sleeves and she said,"Now look at here, young man. You might be able to help me wash the dishes, but you can't cook." And I'd say, "Oh, who can't cook like this?" And Brother's joking with his wife. And he said, "You know, the first thing you know, I'd come over and I'd put my arm around her, hand on her, and she didn't know what I was doing yet. I'd say, "Bless your heart, honey. I'll tell you. I'll help you do this." And then lay down in my heart. And I'm saying, "Lord, send your peace to that woman. Send your peace that's in me into her now, Lord God. And quicken my family now. I'm your servant, Father. &gt;&gt; Send them peace." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's quite a difference. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the first thing you know, she'd say, "Billy, you know, I had a minister that was here. I'm not going to name him, but he said, I was and and and I respect them to the highest degree, and I know used to." He said, "Dale, I was destroying my He told me in the past, I was destroying my family studying the word of God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "My wife would say, 'Wh are you coming to bed, honey?" I'll say, 'Well, I'm just finishing this. I I'll be up there soon. He said, "2 3 4:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be in bed yet with her." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I was so consumed." He said, "My kids were becoming strangers to me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sound like Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Moses was doing a lot for God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sounds like doing God a service without it being his will. &gt;&gt; No matter how much God calls you to do, your first requirement is your wife and your family, &gt;&gt; your kids. It's the kids that pay the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the first thing she you know she'd say, "Billy, you know a certain thing." And they'd like this these black eyes of hers would start snapping again. He said, "You know?" He said, "Yep." And I'd look down and the babies, she'd be in there and she'd start playing with the blocks and playing together. And what was it? It was creating a different atmosphere. And this is what I mentioned at the beginning, brothers. Let me tell you brothers, the atmosphere is what does it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's exactly right. Look, it's not the hen that hatches the egg. &gt;&gt; It's the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It's not the Holy Ghost. I I just I'm going out on a limb here. It's not the Holy Ghost that'll save your kids. It's the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It's the atmosphere &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost can work. Do you know nobody The reason that the the churches are going cold is the atmosphere. It's the families. It's the atmosph. &gt;&gt; It's got to be warm and moist and loving and friendly and nurturable and just pop pop pop. &gt;&gt; You can't keep love life down of any kind. &gt;&gt; And the right atmosphere. He said, "What's the egg? You could put it under a stove. You could put a puppy on it. And if that egg's warm, it'll hatch." It's not the chicken that hatches the egg. It's the atmosphere. Now, I got a question for you. Why did brother Brown say, "Brothers?" Let me tell you, brothers. &gt;&gt; It's the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You got your wife by taking her on date night and sending her flowers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When's the last time you did that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said the atmosphere. He said you can put it under anything. It's the atmosphere. He said what we need is a Holy Ghost atmosphere. He said that's right. The atmosphere where the power of God is moving are separate ways. No. No. He didn't say that. in one accord, in one place together, under one atmosphere, &gt;&gt; expecting God to move down and put your family in harmony. That'll be the greatest sign and wonder you may ever see. &gt;&gt; You know, everybody wants to see signs and wonder, but their household is in turmoil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can forget about the signs and wonders when your household is in turmoil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam said, "If you want to see signs and wonders, become one. Become a miracle." &gt;&gt; You want to see miracles, become a miracle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders. I got another news flash for you. And you know, we get to talk to different people around the world as a minister. Sometimes people even ask us questions. And I had a brother ask me about involving their wife in their decisions &gt;&gt; that you make around your home. &gt;&gt; And I I'm just going to let you know whatever you do is f it won't matter to me. You don't even have to tell me. &gt;&gt; But I want to just tell you something. Every decision that I made regarding money for God, &gt;&gt; I want you to get this &gt;&gt; that my wife wasn't in favor of. &gt;&gt; She was right. &gt;&gt; She I mean she was dead right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And those two decisions totaled about 65,000 60 67,000 actually. And it was 100% for God. 100%. &gt;&gt; 100% for God. &gt;&gt; And it was to godly people, elected godly people. Leanne said, "I'm not comfortable with this." and I pushed through it and I regretted it. Matter of fact, I'm regretting it today. &gt;&gt; Your wife has a point of view that you will never see. &gt;&gt; Your wife is not a doormat. &gt;&gt; God gave her wisdom and a brain. And if you're not asking your wife if you feel comfortable with this, plan on some God God has a way of bringing the knocks home. &gt;&gt; You know, before we even and this is this is going way out, you know, before we even came into the message and this was we were young. We had no kids and we watched, you know, I'm very young, 21, 22. And we watched some business people with Christian laws with Christian ethics &gt;&gt; and they were in the business of real estate and they would go in and buy strip malls and they were in it was brotherhood so they weren't unequally yolked together and there was three or four brothers and their wives and every brother would go home and ask his wife said what do you feel honey do you feel anything. And he said, "We learned really fast that if our one wife out of the three or four that were in the partnership come back and said, "I don't feel right about this." He said, "When we did it, we normally lost it." &gt;&gt; I meant the bank took it from him &gt;&gt; because it was a bad decision. See, what did the Bible say? The Bible said that we may inherit together. &gt;&gt; It's an inheritance together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're not You're not the I I know that somebody has to be okay. I I really feel &gt;&gt; at the end somebody does have to make a decision, &gt;&gt; but if you step on your wife's decision, &gt;&gt; it might be okay. But be prepared. &gt;&gt; Wow. It's the atmosphere. He said, "What we need is a Holy Ghost filled atmosphere, an absence here of the power of God moving in one accord in one home, gathered together under one atmosphere, expecting God to rise kids in that atmosphere." here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watch this. In Proverbs, and we're coming to a close. Proverbs 22:6. Train up a child in the way he shall go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when he is old, he won't want to depart from it. &gt;&gt; That'll be all based on &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; the atmosphere. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, there's an old proverb, and this is my last scripture that I'm closing with. I I hope this, you know, I I I pray to God you'll get what God's trying to say this morning. Our homes are the safe haven &gt;&gt; and nobody's exempt. &gt;&gt; Like a news flash, even you men need a safe haven. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You need to have a a home haven where you can come down and you can let your guard down &gt;&gt; and you won't be attacked. &gt;&gt; Your wife needs to be able to be honest with you and you won't attack her. &gt;&gt; And your kids, even though they run into your truck, should come in and say, "Dad, I just drove the lawnmower right into the second door." and you just say, "Well, somebody had to do it." &gt;&gt; What good would it be to do anything different? &gt;&gt; The door's already smashed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, everything can be replaced but souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. An offended soul is harder to win back than a walled city. &gt;&gt; Souls. &gt;&gt; The Bible has or the the world has a proverbs. You get more flies with honey than vinegar. &gt;&gt; And that's true in our homes and in our families. &gt;&gt; But the Bible has the exact same proverb. Did you know that it says, "If your enemies are hungry, give them bread to eat. And if they're thirsty, give them water to eat. For thou shalt heat coals of fire &gt;&gt; upon their heads, that the Lord shall reward thee." Yeah. &gt;&gt; The north wind driveth away the rain. So does an angry countenance and a backbiting tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The north wind driveth away the rain. So doth an angry countenance and a backbiting tongue. You know the Bible says that a a soft response to an anger settle the problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We we need to we need to and in this day and it's it's nobody's fault. It's nobody's fault. But we're living in a world of people's rights. &gt;&gt; It's it's just it's just a spirit and you are not going to change that. It's here to stay. &gt;&gt; But what we need to live in under a spirit is of unity for each other &gt;&gt; and it'll start in the home. If you get your family happy and harmonized and you come to church in that spirit, there'll be no problems in the church. There'll be absolutely no problems. It's not possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the home and the tension and listen, it's going to get the sad I I'm trying to leave you on a high note, but it's only going to get worse. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so it really will separate who our God is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if you struggle with not having enough money to go around, um I don't know how to break this news to you, but it's probably not going to change. &gt;&gt; It actually probably only going to get worse. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you have to learn to Paul Paul said in the Bible he said whichsoever state &gt;&gt; I therewith find myself &gt;&gt; I've learned &gt;&gt; that's a decision &gt;&gt; I've learned &gt;&gt; therewith to be content. Do you know some of the laws that are coming down our own country is is digital money by 30 that in nine years digital money in 9 years or less. No commit no all electric cars in nine years or less. And that might be perfect but it's going to be different. &gt;&gt; It'll be different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It'll be different. And and I'm I'm just I'm just trying to say this world's my home. &gt;&gt; I I'm not I'm not building my relationship with my wife or my kids or my family on how many farms I own &gt;&gt; cuz they might all be gone tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Or how much you have in the bank account because they're not yours. &gt;&gt; If they're not the Lord's, they're the governments. &gt;&gt; You get the choice. I gave mine to the Lord's. The government can't take his. &gt;&gt; But you're holding &gt;&gt; back from the Lord. Well, the government already owns that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Environment. &gt;&gt; I've learned, Paul said, I've learned in whichever state I find myself, that's okay. See, kids don't recognize that the bills are due the first of the month. Neither should they. &gt;&gt; But they feel the pressure &gt;&gt; because of it. &gt;&gt; That's not godly. &gt;&gt; That's That's wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God God help me. God help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. To unify the family. And and listen, when when God's just building us without character, character is all we're taking. And so, we're going to have little bumps in the road cuz God's seeing what you're going to do in response. It's a it's a response to an action. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to learn that everything is elected and predestinated. God's already watched the video. And you know it's like there's a great proverb like this. He says you know don't worry about tomorrow. The Bible says physician is uh sufficient is the sorrows of today. &gt;&gt; But you but but you can even go farther than that. Don't worry about tomorrow. God's already there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's already there. You just take care of what's right in front of you right now. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then our we won't have &gt;&gt; this is what &gt;&gt; happen and and I'm I'm trying to close. This is what'll happen if we do that. We will get rid of the unexpected uh pressure on each other. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought you were going to be &gt;&gt; I thought you were going to do &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; I thought it would be like this. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're disappointed because you had a dreamland &gt;&gt; that is not reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, in this world, &gt;&gt; you know, the Bible says you can't comprehend what God has in store for you in heaven for those that love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we can experience heaven here. You're looking at me funny. &gt;&gt; I can prove that in the Bible. &gt;&gt; It's a choice. Brother Brown said, "You don't have to wait till the millennium to live in victory. &gt;&gt; You can live in it here. &gt;&gt; It's your choice. &gt;&gt; You want your millennium here, you just let go. Let go and let God have his way." Amen. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I I pray. I pray there is some key points there. God's looking out for all of us and especially the little ones. &gt;&gt; Remember this fathers and mothers, their angel, that's their theophony body is in heaven before the throne. And when you touch them in an improper way, God knows &gt;&gt; you remember the story of brother Bram and his wife and she was upset with him and she just slammed the door. She had a right to slam the door actually because she was he was gone so much and she was running everything in the turmoil. But it displeased God because it made him separate and God gave her cancer until his prophet healed him. So the God healed the from the word of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch what the prophet said. We never fuss. Nobody should ever see a fuss. You might have them, but it's in private. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Help us, Jesus. You know, we'll change our homes and our kids won't leave the church. &gt;&gt; We'll change our homes and our kids will like to be around us. It's &gt;&gt; your choice. &gt;&gt; Your choice completely. Amen. Let's pull this song up, Vicki. In the dark of the midnight, I have offl my face while the sun [Music] might [Music] Heat. Heat.
