[15:57] each bearing our licks of fire would
[16:00] come to hear from you Lord I pray that
[16:03] you just take the simple thoughts that I

[16:09] blessed from the youngest to the oldest
[16:12] Lord as we turn our eyes to your word

[16:16] we pray may your spirit Walk Among Us
[16:19] speaking to us in Jesus Christ's name
[16:21] amen amen you all can have your seats
[16:24] this
[16:26] morning I just wanted to express my my
[16:30] gratitude to our pastor brother Dell for
[16:32] the uh confidence that he placed in me
[16:35] to uh to come here and stand in his pull
[16:39] pit while he's uh out on the missionary
[16:42] field you know a lot of a lot of pastors
[16:46] uh they they do and they should guard
[16:49] their pull pits you know and so for for
[16:51] me to be here among you with without him
[16:54] present I I think says a lot about
[16:57] brother Dell and and um I just don't
[17:00] want to do anything that would uh break
[17:03] the confidence that he's shown by having
[17:05] me
[17:06] here
[17:07] um you have to forgive me because I uh
[17:11] two things I have going on here this
[17:12] morning that's a little bit unusual the
[17:14] first is is preaching I Don't Preach a
[17:16] whole lot so um you know uh you could
[17:21] it's real easy to get out of practice if
[17:23] you if you don't get to to use the gift
[17:25] very much and the second thing is I have
[17:27] a sermon that on my notes I have uh my
[17:31] written notes and then I have some
[17:32] slides and so because it was it would
[17:34] kind of mess up the uh program we're
[17:37] we're not going to use my slides but if
[17:40] I you see me going back and forth a
[17:41] little bit that's kind of why um not a
[17:45] problem for me but hopefully it's not a
[17:47] problem for
[17:48] you but hey you know we're just uh we're
[17:51] all in this together you know we're just
[17:53] all Christian soldiers fighting every
[17:56] day getting on our knees and praying and
[17:58] so we're all in this together and
[17:59] there's no big ones there's no great
[18:01] ones and you appreciate the the the
[18:04] gifts of God wherever they are and uh
[18:06] you just uh bear with me this morning as
[18:09] we we take a text out of Psalms 127 if
[18:12] you turn with me in your
[18:14] Bibles and
[18:17] um I I had two different sermons when I
[18:20] when I Was preparing for this
[18:23] uh for our visit here this weekend and I
[18:27] I honestly I didn't know which one I was
[18:29] going to
[18:30] preach and
[18:33] um
[18:34] uh you know some people feel like uh oh
[18:38] thank you for standing for the word some
[18:40] people feel like uh you know if you come
[18:43] to church and you don't have a
[18:45] Pentecostal type of experience have you
[18:47] really been to church and I appreciate
[18:50] that you know I appreciate a Pentecostal
[18:52] experience I appreciate enthusiasm from
[18:54] the from the pull pit to the pews and
[18:57] Lord knows we need the fire but there's
[18:59] also the scripture that says he leadth
[19:00] me to lie down in Green Pastures and so
[19:03] the word can cause us also at times to
[19:06] rest right and um uh so it's important
[19:11] that it settles us as well and so
[19:13] sometimes uh a message may not be a fire
[19:16] and brimstone jumping out of the Pew
[19:18] running around the church but I hope
[19:20] that the word of the Lord this morning
[19:22] ministers to you um I want to speak
[19:24] specifically to the men among us but
[19:27] parents and and
[19:28] in general whether you have uh
[19:30] grandchildren or children and and uh
[19:33] looking to have children um I don't like
[19:37] to go somewhere and and not give tools
[19:41] on how to live a Christian Life I think
[19:44] that's probably one of the most
[19:45] important things that that we seem to
[19:47] miss in in the message is we have all
[19:50] this Revelation people preach Revelation
[19:52] Revelation Revelation and people
[19:53] struggle at home in the family and they
[19:57] they have problems raising children or
[19:59] they have problems in the relationships
[20:01] with their spouses and I've preached
[20:03] here enough that you all have heard me I
[20:06] uh whether I'm talking about forgiveness
[20:08] in the family or I'm talking about how
[20:10] the husband needs respect from the wife
[20:12] or the wife needs love from the husband
[20:15] that this thematically in in my in my
[20:17] Ministry is uh I want to see
[20:21] relationships succeed Among Us so we'll
[20:25] take a text here this morning from
[20:27] Psalms 27 and
[20:30] um we'll start at verse
[20:33] three and the scripture reads this David
[20:36] writes Lo children are inheritage of the
[20:40] Lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[20:43] reward as arrows are in the hand of a
[20:46] mighty man so are the children of the
[20:48] youth happy is the man that hath his
[20:51] quiver full of him they shall not be
[20:53] ashamed but they shall speak with the
[20:55] enemies in the gate may the Lord just
[20:59] bless the reading of his words you all
[21:00] can have your seats this
[21:02] morning now I like this I like this
[21:04] scripture there's a there's a lot in it
[21:06] and we could we could certainly spend a
[21:08] lot of time unpacking it but um I want
[21:11] to take my my time this morning and if I
[21:14] don't if I don't finish this there's
[21:16] always a you know a part two to come
[21:18] along uh maybe at a later date but um
[21:21] just to bear with me as I labor to to
[21:24] put a foundation here um the picture
[21:27] that I'd like for you to think of in
[21:28] your mind with these arrows um we're
[21:32] kind of we're kind of distanced from
[21:33] this example that David gives of arrows
[21:37] you know we not many of us carry around
[21:39] bows and arrows anymore if you do you'd
[21:41] probably be looked at pretty strange but
[21:44] in the uh the ancient days uh a warrior
[21:48] would have a a quiver full of arrows and
[21:51] this is the image that imagery that
[21:52] David is relating here is that you would
[21:55] have a quiver full of arrows and the
[21:57] thing about these arrows is this it
[21:59] wasn't like the arrows that we buy today
[22:02] you know you go if you're a hunter and
[22:03] you go to the store and you buy arrows
[22:05] to go and and hunting with uh they're
[22:07] manufactured they're they're carbon
[22:10] they're lightweight they're they're
[22:11] machined you know within certain
[22:13] tolerances they're you know just
[22:15] everyone is just perfect you know and
[22:16] they're perfectly fletched and they're
[22:19] uh certainly wasn't that way 203,000
[22:22] years ago you know the the warrior would
[22:24] have to go out and he would find the
[22:26] material and he would he would spend
[22:28] time shaping it and squaring it and then
[22:31] you know making it round and he would
[22:33] select just the right feathers and he
[22:35] had just the right arot tip on the end
[22:38] for what the it wasn't just you know
[22:40] like a one arot tip one siiz fit all
[22:43] that you know depending on what was what
[22:45] his aim and his purpose was there were
[22:48] many different types of arrowheads and
[22:50] so um what I'm getting at with that is
[22:54] uh a a a father a man with this quiver
[22:58] fool is happy and each one of those
[23:01] arrows are unique each child is unique
[23:04] and we have to as as husbands and as
[23:06] fathers realize that um our children are
[23:10] not produced in cookie cutter fashion uh
[23:13] they're not machined and and
[23:14] manufactured and and just uh uh everyone
[23:17] has the same tolerances and the same
[23:19] nature and the same uh skills and the
[23:22] same uh dreams that our children are all
[23:26] unique and wondrously made
[23:28] in in the womb and God forms them and
[23:30] gives them individual personalities and
[23:32] as husbands as fathers we have to be
[23:34] able to look at our children uh look at
[23:36] our families and and prophetically see
[23:40] where that person is going to wind up
[23:42] and by by that I mean we need to look at
[23:44] our our children and see their uh their
[23:47] qualities and their their character and
[23:49] be able to mold them and shape them just
[23:51] like uh a warrior in ancient days would
[23:54] spend hours and hours you know shaping
[23:56] the arrow and SEL cting just the right
[23:58] Arrowhead and balancing everything and
[24:00] putting just the right feathers our
[24:02] children deserve no less that's the the
[24:05] imagery here that that David is
[24:07] giving amen so let me get to my notes
[24:11] here so I don't just uh skip
[24:14] everywhere all
[24:19] right
[24:21] okay
[24:22] so as I said I I primarily want to speak
[24:25] to uh fathers today but uh definitely to
[24:28] to the the husband and wife I believe
[24:30] the husband and wife should work as a
[24:32] team um that I don't like the idea uh
[24:36] brother brandom says it here and there
[24:37] throughout the the message you know not
[24:39] to treat your your wife as a doormat
[24:41] because she's your queen and um I
[24:43] believe in in a right relationship a
[24:45] husband and a wife will come together
[24:47] and they form a unit now the the husband
[24:49] and we'll talk about it is is as
[24:51] absolutely the head of the household but
[24:54] they work in conjunction together and so
[24:57] if husband and wife are are budding
[24:58] heads and they're they're not on the
[25:00] same page it creates chaos and confusion
[25:02] into the family but it's the father's
[25:05] responsibility the father's
[25:07] responsibility to fix that it's not the
[25:10] wife's responsibility and
[25:12] so I I know some of you you're older and
[25:16] and you're like we know this stuff and
[25:18] well that's all right you just support
[25:20] me with your
[25:22] amens all right so a true uh I believe
[25:26] that a father is uh called to be the
[25:29] king of his household I believe that a
[25:31] father has three distinct roles within
[25:33] God's economy in the house the first is
[25:36] is the king of the home he's called to
[25:38] be the high priest of the home and he's
[25:41] called to be the have a prophetic
[25:43] service to the home to be Prophet priest
[25:45] and king that's the ministry of Jesus
[25:47] Christ it's the ministry that we see
[25:48] duplicated in the father and I just talk
[25:50] about that for just a moment because a
[25:53] king is not set upon the throne uh uh
[25:58] here on this Earth to be worshiped and
[26:00] adored a king a true king is a servant
[26:02] to his people he serves his people he
[26:05] protects the borders what what is
[26:08] allowed into the home what is allowed
[26:11] what kind of friends your children will
[26:12] have what kind of things that you'll
[26:14] allow your children to engage in it's
[26:16] the father's responsibility and and his
[26:18] duty as the king of the home to uh to
[26:22] make those decisions you know it's not
[26:24] the the preacher's responsibility it's
[26:25] not the pastor it's not certainly not
[26:28] moms uh you know unfortunately what we
[26:31] see is a lot of times is when fathers
[26:32] abdicate the the the role of King many
[26:36] things wind up on Mama's lap and so I
[26:39] know none of us have this problem here
[26:40] today um but uh we'll just uh get
[26:45] through it anyhow a father has to be the
[26:49] uh uh has to lead from the front he has
[26:53] uh whoa
[26:56] sorry surprised me there uh a father h a
[27:00] true king leads from the front that
[27:02] means he's the one that that is the
[27:04] first into
[27:06] battle swinging a sword he's the first
[27:08] one to to go and meet the Enemy at the
[27:13] Gate we talk about the various problems
[27:16] that we have um uh you know with this
[27:19] things in the world and I I liking a lot
[27:22] of times to you know we we believe that
[27:24] there's a hedge of angels around our
[27:26] home providing protection amen and you
[27:29] know there uh as as I would put it is
[27:32] that that beyond the Hedge is the world
[27:35] and all the things of the world and all
[27:37] the enemies all the demons all the
[27:39] things that are set against the believer
[27:41] and they're just there popping their
[27:43] head up of be just beyond the Hedge and
[27:46] as as the as the the husband as the
[27:48] father it's it's our duty as a as the
[27:51] king of our homes to engage that enemy
[27:54] to protect our kingdom as it were right
[27:57] so we have a responsibility we have to
[27:59] be the first in the battle the first to
[28:01] you know when when when children bring
[28:03] something home or they have a question
[28:05] about something it's our responsibility
[28:07] to to look
[28:18] at high priest of the home he has to
[28:21] pursue a vertical relationship with God
[28:24] in order that the horizontal
[28:26] relationships with with mother and with
[28:28] our children with people work out just
[28:30] right because if our our vertical
[28:32] relationships are messed up then our
[28:34] horizontal relationships are messed up
[28:37] amen so he must be able to Shepherd his
[28:39] family he can't just rely on the pastor
[28:42] or a church relationship he has to be
[28:44] comfortable interceding for his family
[28:47] just as our high priest intercedes for
[28:49] us he has to intercede for his
[28:52] children um a little bit later I I want
[28:55] to if I if I don't get to anything else
[28:58] I want to get to some some
[29:00] prayers uh thematic things that we can
[29:04] pray for for our children doesn't matter
[29:06] if they're out of the house and and gone
[29:08] it doesn't matter if you have
[29:09] grandchildren but just some different
[29:11] things that uh I'd like to put put into
[29:14] your your tool pouch a a father must be
[29:17] able to prophetically Shepherd his his
[29:19] she Shepherd his family and by that I
[29:21] means he he needs to be able to pray and
[29:23] seek the leadership of the Lord if we
[29:25] believe that the footsteps of the
[29:26] righteous orain AED by the Lord then a a
[29:31] man a husband has to be able to seek the
[29:33] will of God for his family not just for
[29:35] his life but for the life of his family
[29:38] and Shepherd his family in that will in
[29:41] that the the scripture says that my
[29:42] people perish for a lack of vision and
[29:45] so a husband and a father needs to have
[29:47] a vision for his family he needs to have
[29:51] a vision for his children and where
[29:53] they're going if I if I go back to our
[29:57] uh the illustration that that David gave
[30:00] us of the bow and arrow you know it's
[30:03] not just the arrow that that's unique
[30:06] and different every bow is is a little
[30:08] bit different meaning we you know we
[30:10] each have a little bit different style
[30:12] of of parenting we each are unique you
[30:14] know but the parent is the bow that that
[30:17] pulls back the arrow and depending on
[30:20] where that Arrow has to go the the
[30:23] parent must know how much tension to put
[30:24] on the string dad must know how how far
[30:27] to draw the arrow back he must be able
[30:29] to point it and put it in the right
[30:31] direction and release it amen so that
[30:35] that prophetic Vision to know what the
[30:38] what the will of God is for your family
[30:40] is so important every every child is
[30:43] unique and every every every move that
[30:46] we make as parents must be carefully
[30:48] weighed when it comes to how we point
[30:51] our children in what direction and what
[30:53] we're going to allow them to do and
[30:55] what're we're going to allow them to
[30:56] interact with whether it's at at school
[30:58] if they're if they're not homeschooled
[31:00] or or if it's uh you know having friends
[31:04] and and what kind of friends will allow
[31:05] them to have what kind of activities
[31:07] will allow them to engage in and I
[31:09] certainly don't believe that that we uh
[31:12] uh are are to cloer ourselves off we're
[31:15] called to be Salt and Light to the world
[31:17] but especially when our children are
[31:19] young we must protect them you know they
[31:21] don't have the Holy Ghost yet and so we
[31:23] have to be their Holy Ghost for them
[31:25] that means making the decisions for them
[31:27] that they cannot make uh I know when I
[31:30] was when I was young I I like to use a
[31:33] lot of personal examples sometimes it
[31:35] gets me in trouble I've been told I'm
[31:36] I'm way too transparent in the pull pit
[31:38] and sometimes it makes people
[31:40] uncomfortable but um I I like to use
[31:43] personal examples because they're my
[31:44] examples I'm familiar with them you know
[31:46] it doesn't make sense for me to use
[31:48] other people's examples if you want
[31:49] brother brandom examples you you can
[31:51] read brother brandom's messages and and
[31:53] listen to the word and that's wonderful
[31:55] but um I remember remember when I I it
[31:58] makes people uncomfortable because for
[32:00] some reason we get this idea that the
[32:02] person standing behind the pull pit has
[32:05] somehow they've got it all figured out
[32:07] and they they they've arrived or there's
[32:09] some great somebody or listen we I put
[32:12] my my pants on one leg at a time just
[32:15] like everybody else I make plenty of
[32:17] mistakes and um I'm great you know it it
[32:20] sounds funny but I'm grateful for those
[32:22] mistakes because they've taught me so
[32:24] much um it'd be horrible to go through
[32:27] life and and not learn from your
[32:29] mistakes but um I remember when I was I
[32:32] was young I uh I think I was probably
[32:34] about 13 or so and there was a um uh
[32:39] kind of like a uh a military program for
[32:42] kids and um
[32:47] they uh you got a uniform and they
[32:49] taught us how to March and and how to
[32:52] you know do all these uh Maneuvers while
[32:55] you're Marching In step and in sink and
[32:58] and we sing CAD what we call cadences
[33:01] while we did it and um I when I when I
[33:04] found out I like the military stuff you
[33:06] know growing up I was just always always
[33:08] a military uh minded kid I probably read
[33:11] way too much World War II history and
[33:13] things like that and it just uh it
[33:14] always put it just like you know how
[33:16] brother brandom says you know the talks
[33:17] about the the young boy that turned into
[33:19] a sailor and he grew up in the middle of
[33:21] Kansas or something you know he's like
[33:23] well there was a there was an image of a
[33:25] boat or a little ship on the on his
[33:27] bedroom wall and he's seen that every
[33:28] day and so they put it before him he
[33:30] ended up going into the the Navy or
[33:32] whatever um I think I looked at that
[33:34] stuff way too much myself when I was a
[33:35] kid so then I that's the way I was bent
[33:38] and I was about 13 or so and I I
[33:40] encountered this program that was put on
[33:42] it was by our our air force and I begged
[33:45] my parents I begged them begged and
[33:46] pleaded let me do this you know um and
[33:50] it it it ended up they ended up allowing
[33:52] me but I ended up having to go and talk
[33:55] to the pastor and and he said you know
[33:58] well it's just going to take you away
[33:59] from church and um it it did and my my
[34:06] parents they they ended up make letting
[34:08] me make a decision you know they're like
[34:11] well you're 13 uh we got to start
[34:13] letting you make some of your own
[34:14] decisions so you can choose to do this
[34:16] if you
[34:17] want and uh sometimes 13 year olds
[34:20] aren't qualified to make good decisions
[34:22] like that and um you know at the at the
[34:27] end of the day what it did was it took
[34:28] me all the it took me out of church on
[34:30] on the week on a week night and then it
[34:33] bent me further into the military where
[34:35] I ended up going into the military and
[34:37] 26 years later still in the military and
[34:41] um you know so what I'm what I'm saying
[34:43] is that sometimes we we can't let our
[34:45] children make those decisions on their
[34:47] on their own we have to be able to make
[34:49] the decisions for them as as fathers and
[34:52] as parents we have to know that uh
[34:54] saying no is okay
[34:58] um as Christians the the ultimate the
[35:01] ultimate Target that we're we're
[35:03] pointing our children to must be the
[35:05] Lord it can't be anything else it can't
[35:07] even be University it can't be a
[35:10] specific goal or career field or
[35:13] something like that our ultimate goal is
[35:15] that our children serve God no matter
[35:17] where they are amen no matter where they
[35:20] go in life they must be able to to serve
[35:23] the Lord and uh the the big question for
[35:27] that is for us to do that as parents we
[35:29] have to ask ourselves how close are we
[35:32] to the Lord ourselves how close are we
[35:34] to the Target um righteousness is a a
[35:38] daily Target that we strive for and we
[35:40] want to launch our children to but our
[35:43] children see us they see the backside of
[35:46] us right they know all our faults they
[35:50] know all our weaknesses they know all
[35:51] our failures from the time they're very
[35:53] young they learn how to manipulate us
[35:56] Daddy please Mommy please Mommy says no
[36:00] they go and ask Daddy Daddy says yes or
[36:02] they go and ask Daddy Daddy says no and
[36:04] then they go ask Mommy and and so they
[36:07] they they know how to to manipulate us
[36:09] they know how to pit us against one
[36:11] another they know Daddy's weak in this
[36:13] area he'll let us do this mom's weak in
[36:15] this area she's a softy we can get away
[36:18] with this and and children just pit us
[36:20] back and forth together and then the
[36:21] next thing you know you and your wife
[36:23] are are in the bedroom and you're trying
[36:24] not to argue in front of the kids and
[36:26] and they like well I don't think we
[36:27] should do that but I already told him
[36:28] and and and you go back and forth and
[36:31] and and your little little ones there at
[36:33] the door just
[36:35] listening I'll get what I want you know
[36:39] um they see us they see all the negative
[36:42] they see all the the things that we do
[36:44] that we uh that we wish that we didn't
[36:47] do you know um they they there was a
[36:52] there's a quote I read once that says uh
[36:54] I can't hear what you're saying saying
[36:57] because I see what you're
[36:59] doing I can't hear what you're saying be
[37:02] because I can see what you're doing and
[37:04] we we want to live Godly lives we want
[37:07] to live Christian lives that are
[37:09] obedient to God that are that we walk in
[37:11] the paths of righteousness that we that
[37:14] we uh honor God in all that we say and
[37:16] do and and we're human we make mistakes
[37:19] I'm not saying that we don't you know
[37:21] we're going to get in arguments we're
[37:23] going to get in in disagreements and and
[37:26] we're going to disagree loudly sometimes
[37:28] and and uh you know that's that's
[37:31] unfortunately it's normal I wish it
[37:33] wasn't normal maybe it's not normal for
[37:35] you and and nobody else does that nobody
[37:37] ever else gets into a loud disagreement
[37:40] just it's just me and my family
[37:44] uh help us
[37:47] Lord but you can
[37:50] see I'm saying is like what we're aiming
[37:52] our children for and we and we when we
[37:55] tell them we want you to serve the Lord
[37:57] we want you to to walk in these Paths of
[38:00] righteousness that and and if they don't
[38:02] see our lives match up with what we're
[38:04] trying to aim them
[38:06] for then that creates a disconnect from
[38:10] a young age from a very young age it
[38:13] creates a disconnect and so as as
[38:16] husbands as fathers in particular um we
[38:19] have to know how to do that we have to
[38:21] learn how to do that unfortunately
[38:23] raising children doesn't come with an
[38:25] owner's manual I I have I've had four of
[38:27] them and not one came with an owner's
[38:29] manual or operator's manual each one of
[38:32] them is different not one of them is the
[38:34] same they're all unique uh they all uh
[38:38] the only thing equal about them is I
[38:40] love them all equal you know I don't
[38:42] they you know each one of them is
[38:44] precious to me but uh each one of them
[38:46] is just so unique and so different and
[38:48] uh by the time you got the first one
[38:50] figured out then the second one comes
[38:52] along and you're like okay I've got this
[38:54] and then you're like wait a minute the
[38:56] second one is completely different than
[38:58] the first one and you get that one
[39:00] figure out you're like okay I'm I'm
[39:02] ready for the next one and the next one
[39:03] comes and you find out the next one's
[39:05] different from both the F the first two
[39:08] and then the fourth one comes and you're
[39:09] just like whatever I don't
[39:13] care we'll just wing it you know and
[39:15] then that creates all kinds of
[39:16] resentment later because the children
[39:18] are like wait you let them get away with
[39:20] this you never would have let me done
[39:22] that and as a parent you're just like I
[39:24] don't have the energy to deal with it
[39:27] I was a lot younger when I had my first
[39:29] one but I I appreciate I appreciate this
[39:33] this idea that that David gives us in
[39:36] the Bible because it not only does it it
[39:40] it tell us that children are reward and
[39:42] and they are but it also tells us that
[39:47] we we will be happy with our children if
[39:50] you're not happy with your children
[39:51] something's wrong it's probably not the
[39:53] children it's probably you because the
[39:55] Bible says says you'll be happy if you
[39:57] you have a you have children and then it
[40:00] gives this next thing here it says they
[40:02] shall not be ashamed how many don't you
[40:04] want children that aren't ashamed of you
[40:06] don't you want to walk a life that your
[40:08] children will not be ashamed and it says
[40:10] here that they will speak with the
[40:12] enemies in the gate and what that refers
[40:14] to is that in ancient times when when
[40:17] legal matters were being settled well
[40:19] things were being disputed they would BR
[40:21] they would bring the the the argument to
[40:24] the judges who would sit in the gates of
[40:26] the city
[40:27] and then that this means that your
[40:28] children will argue on your behalf
[40:31] they'll they'll fight on your behalf
[40:33] they'll they'll speak with those people
[40:35] that would try to destroy you or destroy
[40:37] your influence and they'll say no I've
[40:38] seen his private life I grew up in his
[40:42] household economy I grew up under his
[40:44] kingdom and this is how he's taught us
[40:46] and how he's trained us and and that's
[40:48] what we want we want to CH our children
[40:51] to respect us and be proud of us and
[40:53] know that they lived in an economy of
[40:55] God that that uh is done properly amen
[41:00] it's it's so important uh for for us as
[41:04] husbands to to be in the word of God and
[41:07] to teach our children uh the a a scribe
[41:12] came one day to Jesus and they they
[41:14] asked him and uh they said what is what
[41:18] is the greatest
[41:19] commandment and if if I would ask you
[41:22] today you know what's what's the
[41:24] greatest commandment I would you ask
[41:25] just a little one of the children you
[41:27] know they say well uh Thou shalt not
[41:29] steal you know that's I stole candy once
[41:32] and I got a pretty good spanking that's
[41:34] the biggest Commandments don't steal you
[41:36] know or or don't covet or or you know uh
[41:40] what whatever they think it would be but
[41:42] uh when they ask Jesus this question he
[41:45] refers to back to the book of
[41:48] Deuteronomy he says the first of all the
[41:51] Commandments is here o Israel the Lord
[41:54] our God is one Lord
[41:58] it
[42:00] it I'm looking at my son because we've
[42:02] been learning this Cohen do you think
[42:04] you can recite it can you recite that in
[42:09] Hebrew you can't do it in front of the
[42:11] church so we've been learning this we've
[42:14] been learning this command at home
[42:20] it's it's
[42:23] um brother John why would you do that
[42:26] why would you why would you teach your
[42:27] children that I think that if somebody
[42:31] came to our Lord and savior and said
[42:34] what's the greatest
[42:36] commandment and Jesus didn't say well
[42:39] it's uh Thou shalt not kill or Thou
[42:43] shalt not steal he refers back to this
[42:46] commandment in Deuteronomy this is the
[42:49] greatest one the fir the first part of
[42:51] it is here o Israel the Lord our God is
[42:54] one Lord is one
[42:56] so immediately we have we have
[42:59] godhead secondly he says he says this
[43:02] that goes on to say and thou shalt love
[43:04] the Lord thy God with all thy heart with
[43:07] all thy strength and with all thy
[43:10] might now if you read the words in King
[43:16] James uh it says all thy
[43:19] mind but the in Deuteronomy it says all
[43:22] they
[43:23] might and the reason why that they put
[43:27] mind in uh the New Testament is because
[43:31] there wasn't a Greek word really that
[43:33] translates well to might and so they put
[43:37] mind but unfortunately I think that was
[43:39] almost I think it was almost prophetic
[43:41] because like people want to have a
[43:43] mental relationship a mental
[43:45] understanding a mental love of God when
[43:48] God does things for us you know we love
[43:50] him but what this what this actually is
[43:53] to love him with all our might is to
[43:55] love him passionately to pursue the
[43:58] things of God to pursue God passionately
[44:00] that we're always seeking after him and
[44:03] remember I'm talking to fathers and I'm
[44:04] and I'm laying a little bit more of a
[44:05] foundation here that that goes on to say
[44:10] and these words which I command thee
[44:12] today shall be in thine heart and thou
[44:15] shalt teach them diligently unto thy
[44:18] children diligently unto thy children
[44:22] and thou shalt talk of them when thou
[44:24] sest in thine house
[44:26] and when thou wst by the way and when
[44:29] thou liest down and when thou risest up
[44:32] and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[44:34] thine hand and they shall be as
[44:36] frontless between thy eyes and thou
[44:38] shalt write them upon the posts of thy
[44:41] house and on thy Gates and so this is
[44:44] what Jesus referred back to now he only
[44:46] quoted the first little bit when he when
[44:48] he answered the
[44:49] Scribe and he he went on saying Thou
[44:52] shalt love your neighbor as yourself and
[44:53] in doing so you fulfilled the whole law
[44:56] all this is what hangs the law and the
[44:58] prophets all of this and and we must
[45:02] understand that this is the God's model
[45:06] for parents as Leaders as Fathers as
[45:10] husbands that this is God's model that
[45:12] we have his word constantly in front of
[45:15] our families that we talk about it when
[45:17] we go to bed we talk about it at the
[45:19] dinner table we talk about the things of
[45:21] God always that that we're always
[45:24] presenting Christ to our our family we
[45:26] we remind them and we if we had time we
[45:29] could we could go into uh all the
[45:32] different times throughout the the Old
[45:34] Testament where it said that that talked
[45:37] about this to your children for this
[45:38] will save your children and your
[45:40] children's children and it's a
[45:41] generational thing and we just don't
[45:42] have time to go into it all but as
[45:45] husbands as fathers it's our role and
[45:47] our responsibility to to put this before
[45:50] our kids starting at a very young age
[45:53] just as young as they can understand
[45:55] where we teach teach them first by by
[45:57] Bible stories and then we teach them
[45:59] later by by Bible studies and and if we
[46:02] have to engage our children otherwise
[46:05] the world will engage our children for
[46:08] us amen if we don't teach our children
[46:11] then the world will teach our children
[46:14] and so uh this is a commandment for for
[46:16] All fathers All Fathers and and when
[46:19] when do you stop being a
[46:22] father never never
[46:26] and so it doesn't matter how old your
[46:28] children are it doesn't matter if
[46:30] they're your your your grandchildren or
[46:32] or anything like we have a role and a
[46:34] responsibility to always influence our
[46:37] children our children's children
[46:39] according to the word of God I like this
[46:42] because it it tells us that we first of
[46:46] all that it has to come from our heart
[46:50] that the that the love of God has to be
[46:52] in our heart that we're to pursue him
[46:54] passionately now you because you can't
[46:56] pursue god with a with just a head
[46:59] knowledge and a head relationship and
[47:01] expect it to translate to children
[47:04] because children will see through it if
[47:06] it's just head knowledge they'll see
[47:07] when you waffle on things and they'll
[47:09] see you stumble and fall but when you
[47:11] when you consistently go to the word of
[47:13] God for everything they see that they
[47:17] see this consistency they they learn
[47:19] they they will then learn just like how
[47:21] they learn to manipulate us they will
[47:23] learn I can't manipulate them on this
[47:26] this is the word and you and you see
[47:29] people unfortunately when they just have
[47:30] a head know if you have a head knowledge
[47:32] of something you can be talked out of it
[47:34] if you can be convinced of something you
[47:36] can be unconvinced and so this has to be
[47:39] a a a walk within us that we pursue God
[47:43] from our hearts uh it said that I I like
[47:47] the scripture that talks about David it
[47:49] says David was a man after God's Own
[47:51] Heart and and what we like to to think
[47:55] of that and how it means is David
[47:57] pursued the heart of God that David was
[48:01] always after even with his faults even
[48:03] with his failures and his shortcomings
[48:05] David diligently pursued God in all he
[48:09] did and you know I didn't talk about it
[48:11] but you know just when I was mentioning
[48:14] that leading from the front you know
[48:15] King David led the armies from the front
[48:18] until the one time he didn't and that
[48:21] was when he fell with bash Sheba the one
[48:24] time he stayed home from the fight is
[48:26] when he fell and what a lesson for us as
[48:30] fathers the one time that you don't go
[48:32] out and engage the enemy is the one time
[48:35] you'll fail and and it'll affect your
[48:38] family it'll affect your kingdom your
[48:41] children your children's children so
[48:44] help us Lord help us as fathers to to
[48:46] engage with the Enemy to to always be
[48:49] there fighting for our family fighting
[48:51] for the things that we love the ones
[48:54] that we love
[48:56] I I love good teaching I wish I was a
[48:58] better teacher you know so many times
[49:00] when I when I talk about these things I
[49:02] feel like uh I I I'm not explaining it
[49:05] well enough or I can I know I'll come
[49:06] come away it's I could have explained it
[49:08] better I could have explained it deeper
[49:09] but you know we only have so much time
[49:11] to to talk and and and uh I just want to
[49:15] try to put a little a little something
[49:18] in your hearts no matter whether you
[49:19] have children will have children or your
[49:22] children are out of that household that
[49:25] that speak speaks to you and if it and
[49:26] and if it's not something that's going
[49:28] to help you on your way maybe you can
[49:30] give it to somebody else that'll help
[49:31] them on their
[49:33] way
[49:35] amen
[49:37] um I I I just had I had a couple things
[49:40] in here I'm trying to to skip for for
[49:43] time because I I I brought my my phone
[49:47] phone out to set my timer and then I
[49:49] totally didn't and so I'm I'm trying
[49:52] to trying to think how much time I've
[49:55] actually been up here so we'll just go
[49:57] through a little bit more and and honey
[50:00] if I start going long you wave your arms
[50:03] at
[50:04] me it says you shall teach them
[50:07] diligently unto your children and that's
[50:10] I think that's the core of what I want
[50:12] to get at this morning is that we are to
[50:14] teach them diligently that doesn't that
[50:17] that means uh having a
[50:21] a consistent walk a a consistent thing
[50:26] that we know we're going to have family
[50:27] altar we know we're going to talk about
[50:28] God we know we're going to hear these
[50:30] things at the table we we're going to
[50:31] teach them diligently when we set at the
[50:33] table and we talk in the car with our
[50:35] kids our kids should expect to hear
[50:38] something about God they should they
[50:40] should expect to hear if if they don't
[50:42] hear something about God or a lesson
[50:45] that that pertains to Christian Living
[50:47] and how how uh how they should grow and
[50:51] develop and and I I love to do this with
[50:53] my my son um
[50:56] I wish I was better at it when I was
[50:57] when I was a young younger man a younger
[50:59] father I didn't do it so much with my my
[51:02] girls um I I I kind of just I I blame it
[51:08] really blame's not the right word but I
[51:11] I wasn't raised to do it and you learn
[51:14] as you grow amen you know so like I said
[51:17] we make mistakes with those first kids
[51:19] and then we make new mistakes with each
[51:21] one but we learn a little bit along the
[51:23] way and we try to try to to change as as
[51:26] we as we learn and grow and one of the
[51:29] things I like to do with my my son is is
[51:32] if we're traveling or we're talking you
[51:33] know just him and me in the car you know
[51:35] and I just you know Coen you know let's
[51:38] talk about uh I think the last one we
[51:40] talked about was uh doing doing the the
[51:44] right thing even when nobody's looking
[51:46] and having integrity and what that means
[51:49] you know and the lessons that that I
[51:51] like to talk to him about even if he
[51:52] doesn't really realize that he's getting
[51:54] a lesson you know whe I like to talk to
[51:56] him about honesty Integrity uh valuing
[52:00] the right things being principled being
[52:03] uh someone who can be counted on
[52:05] reliable and you know I might talk to
[52:07] him about a little something I might
[52:09] only just drop just a little bit of
[52:10] thing you know a little bit here a
[52:12] little bit there but I like to I like to
[52:14] encourage him and I like to uh you know
[52:18] uh teaching about the qualities that a
[52:21] man should have and that a godly man
[52:23] should have and you know
[52:26] I wish I had done better with my my
[52:28] first three were all girls and I um you
[52:32] know it's kind of funny for for a guy to
[52:35] teach girls about being girls but uh I
[52:38] wish I'd have done better with it but um
[52:40] you know that's where I'm grateful for a
[52:42] for a Godly wife who comes along and and
[52:45] brother brandom says you know there's
[52:46] there's there's uh there's so many
[52:48] gospels Matthew Mark Luke John and then
[52:50] there's mother you know and and we
[52:53] certainly that when we when we work
[52:55] together with our our spouses and our
[52:57] wives and we have that interconnected
[52:59] that we are unified front she catches up
[53:02] on on the things that we don't and and
[53:04] thank God for wives that that are um
[53:07] spiritual that have have discernment um
[53:10] I can't count how many times my wife has
[53:12] come to me and said John you know you
[53:15] did this but you didn't catch how they
[53:19] reacted because she knows them better in
[53:21] some areas than I do she knows them
[53:23] better in a lot of areas than I do and
[53:25] she said and she'll tell me she said you
[53:27] know you didn't see their reaction to
[53:29] this and you don't know that they did
[53:32] this and they did this I think you need
[53:33] to uh talk to them next time like this
[53:38] and and I try to I don't always do it
[53:40] but I try to then go and do what my wife
[53:43] says because she knows
[53:46] best and
[53:48] so you know that's that's that's a good
[53:51] Mama but you know then I talk about
[53:53] these things but it's it's it's it's not
[53:55] the Mama's
[53:56] responsibility to Pastor the kids it's
[54:00] not Mom's responsibility to to teach the
[54:03] kids to uh teach them about the things
[54:06] of God she does it's kind of like the
[54:07] natural order of things when they're
[54:08] young but the father should be over that
[54:11] all right because the way that a that
[54:13] that God set up the household economy
[54:15] was that we have uh Christ as the head
[54:17] of the church then we have the husband
[54:19] as the head of the home and the the wife
[54:21] is there under the husband and then
[54:23] there's the children and so there's
[54:25] there's a the a distinct picture of how
[54:27] things work and so the husband is
[54:28] ultimately responsible for all of it the
[54:31] husband is responsible for everything
[54:33] that happens within his kingdom as the
[54:35] king and so you know you can't you can't
[54:39] just uh say things happen and then you
[54:41] say well Lord look at the woman you gave
[54:43] me you know and try to blame things on
[54:45] the on the wife you're
[54:47] responsible amen so I the good thing the
[54:51] good news is is when is when uh my wife
[54:53] does all these amazing things that that
[54:55] I get to take credit for it because I'm
[54:58] responsible uh for all of it I'm
[55:00] responsible for the good and the bad
[55:02] right you know so when good things
[55:03] happen I'm responsible too so I get I
[55:05] get some of the credit amen Proverbs
[55:08] 22:6 says train up a child in the way
[55:10] she go and when he is old he will not
[55:12] depart from it we love that verse uh as
[55:15] it's a promise to us that when we do the
[55:16] right things when we even let me say
[55:19] this you know children you can do
[55:21] everything right with a child just as as
[55:24] well as you could do everything wrong
[55:25] and they'll still go their own path
[55:29] they'll still go their own path and but
[55:32] the principle is is that when we teach
[55:34] them the things of God that's always
[55:37] that that's never going to they're never
[55:38] going to escape that they're never going
[55:41] to escape the things that we've taught
[55:42] them and it's the same way with people
[55:46] that that leave the message of the hour
[55:48] that we've seen in the last decade
[55:50] people who have left the message of the
[55:52] hour they cannot Escape it they they
[55:55] can't escape what they've learned they
[55:56] can't escape they it it's always in
[55:58] their mind they're always rehearsing it
[56:00] they're always arguing about it they
[56:01] cannot Escape what they've been taught
[56:04] whether or not they want to acknowledge
[56:05] it anymore as a TR as a truth they're
[56:09] still with it every day and uh you know
[56:14] and then my hope obviously is that that
[56:17] those those that have departed will come
[56:19] back and and that's the hope that we
[56:21] have for our children when they choose a
[56:22] path that we didn't aim them for
[56:25] when we pulled back the bow string and
[56:27] we've Let It Go and then they they make
[56:29] choices that that take them further away
[56:31] from God that's when we have to rest in
[56:34] in the promises of the Lord that says
[56:37] they and their offspring with them their
[56:39] children and their children's children
[56:42] and and so I believe those things we I
[56:44] think we must believe and we must accept
[56:45] it as a promise from God Psalm 78 1-7
[56:50] says my people hear my teaching listen
[56:52] to the words of my mouth I will open my
[56:54] mouth mouth with a parable I will utter
[56:56] hidden things things from of old things
[56:59] we have heard and known things that our
[57:02] ancestors have told us so see there you
[57:04] see that that repeating and rehearsing
[57:07] of the things of God we will not hide
[57:09] them from our descendants we will tell
[57:11] the Next Generation the praiseworthy
[57:13] Deeds of the Lord his power and the
[57:16] Wonders he has done he decreed statutes
[57:18] from Jacob and established the law in
[57:20] Israel which he commanded our ancestors
[57:22] to teach their children so the next
[57:25] generation would know them even the
[57:26] children yet to be born and they in turn
[57:29] will tell their children then they would
[57:32] put their trust in God and would not
[57:34] forget his deeds but would keep his
[57:36] commands so you see that this is about
[57:38] establishing a generational Kingdom it's
[57:41] not just what what's in front of us but
[57:44] but as men we have to have that
[57:46] prophetic as husbands and fathers we
[57:48] have to have that prophetic vision for
[57:49] our children that aligns with the word
[57:51] of God that I'm not doing this just for
[57:53] my children to day but for my children's
[57:56] Children's children's as long as the
[57:58] Lord would tar that the the seeds that I
[58:02] plant today that they'll enjoy decades
[58:06] from now just like a farmer plants a a
[58:09] an oak tree an acorn he never gets to to
[58:12] sit under the shade of that tree but his
[58:15] children's children's children will sit
[58:17] under the shade of that tree you know
[58:20] and and that's that's the attitude the
[58:21] prophetic Vision that we have to have as
[58:23] husbands and fathers we it's so easy
[58:27] it's so easy to get wrapped up around
[58:30] the now and I think one of the hardest
[58:32] things to do as as as fathers and
[58:34] probably even as mothers is to um to to
[58:39] look Beyond what's happening right now
[58:41] and have a long-term Vision a long-term
[58:44] goal for our family because you know
[58:47] everything's so pressing and so urgent
[58:49] we have Financial concerns and we have
[58:51] you know this problem to deal with this
[58:53] child is acting this way or or whatever
[58:55] it is you know things at the work but it
[58:58] it's so easy to get wrapped as we say
[59:00] wrapped around the axle uh about things
[59:03] that are just temporary where we need to
[59:05] establish a long-term vision for our
[59:07] families a long-term a long-term vision
[59:10] for our children's children say well
[59:12] brother brother John the Lord's coming
[59:13] soon amen I believe that he could come
[59:17] he could come before uh the the day is
[59:20] over uh but brother random also taught
[59:23] us that that we plan our potatoes and
[59:25] everything just like he's not coming for
[59:27] another hundred years and how many of us
[59:30] ever thought if you've been around the
[59:32] message for for a while that we would be
[59:34] here in at the end of 2023 going into
[59:38] 2024 uh how many years now it's a
[59:40] prophet been gone how many years have we
[59:43] been uh saying the Lord's coming soon
[59:46] and he is and he is coming soon but it
[59:49] could be a hundred years from now you
[59:51] won't hear many probably many preachers
[59:52] tell you that but you know if even if it
[59:55] does I'm okay with it I'm okay with it
[1:00:00] it's it's his timing not my timing and
[1:00:02] so I want to have a vision for my
[1:00:03] children the the Bible teaches us that a
[1:00:05] that a wise man lays up a uh a an
[1:00:09] inheritance for his children's children
[1:00:12] yeah and and unfortunately not many of
[1:00:14] us are able to to really do that unless
[1:00:16] you're you're very well off financially
[1:00:18] and you're business-minded and and maybe
[1:00:20] your parents helped you out not many of
[1:00:22] us are able to lay out a an inheritance
[1:00:25] but what we can do is we can lay out a
[1:00:27] spiritual inheritance amen because our
[1:00:30] children will reap the benefits of the
[1:00:32] things we do amen they will reap the
[1:00:35] benefits even if they don't know it's
[1:00:37] because of the things we did God will
[1:00:38] still honor what we do and bless our
[1:00:41] children and our children's children I
[1:00:42] know that's true brother brandom talked
[1:00:44] to a businessman one time and he said
[1:00:46] you know the reason why you're
[1:00:47] successful is not because that you're an
[1:00:49] outstanding business person that's not
[1:00:52] it at all he said I look back and I see
[1:00:54] see that your grandparents were Barefoot
[1:00:57] missionaries in China and gave their
[1:00:59] lives on the mission field and because
[1:01:02] of what they did you're blessed in your
[1:01:06] business amen so the things that we do
[1:01:10] matter tremendously God honors what we
[1:01:13] do he honors us he honors his people he
[1:01:15] honors his bride amen it's a principle
[1:01:18] of his and so let me just try to get
[1:01:22] into some some practical application
[1:01:25] here and say brother John how do I train
[1:01:27] my example the how do I train my
[1:01:29] children the first first thing I would
[1:01:30] say would be to be an example to have
[1:01:34] Christ centered child training we must
[1:01:36] first have our hearts devoted
[1:01:38] consciously consciously to pleasing the
[1:01:41] Lord Jesus and all we say all we think
[1:01:43] all we do we need for ourselves to be
[1:01:46] completely focused on the things of God
[1:01:49] Amen we need to be completely focused on
[1:01:51] how uh God would want us to resp respond
[1:01:54] how God would want us to act and and I
[1:01:57] would say don't don't ever be too hasty
[1:02:00] it's so easy to be Hasty in judgment
[1:02:03] it's so easy to be Hasty with our
[1:02:04] children and and come up with a response
[1:02:07] like that when many times we should be
[1:02:12] whole me think about
[1:02:15] this in in
[1:02:18] punishment amen e even in a court of
[1:02:23] law even in a court of law the defendant
[1:02:26] gets a chance to to defend themselves
[1:02:29] and they have an advocate arguing for
[1:02:31] them and so never be too even too hasty
[1:02:34] to punish children but you know let them
[1:02:37] give an account for their actions and
[1:02:40] then don't spare the rot because they're
[1:02:42] probably
[1:02:45] guilty Jesus said I have set an example
[1:02:49] that you should do as I have done for
[1:02:50] you Paul says in 1 Corinthians follow my
[1:02:53] example as I follow follow the example
[1:02:55] of Christ 2 Timothy 2:15 be diligent to
[1:02:58] present yourself approved to God a
[1:03:00] worker who does not need to be ashamed
[1:03:02] rightly dividing the word of Truth and
[1:03:04] so we live an example we live our W our
[1:03:06] life in such a way to please Our Savior
[1:03:09] first but if we want children to glorify
[1:03:11] God we have to glorify God in our own
[1:03:15] lives amen so they have to be able to
[1:03:18] see that they have to be able to see
[1:03:19] that example and and then we have to be
[1:03:21] willing to when we make mistakes
[1:03:25] which we will to go and apologize to our
[1:03:28] children and tell them I did this wrong
[1:03:30] I'm sorry or even when we punish our
[1:03:34] children and we thought we knew the the
[1:03:36] whole truth of something and things come
[1:03:38] out later that somebody had hid
[1:03:40] something and somebody had lied and we
[1:03:42] punished unjustly then we have to go
[1:03:44] back and we have to apologize and say
[1:03:46] I'm sorry and what that does is it it it
[1:03:49] tells it tells your children that you
[1:03:52] are willing to be wrong you are willing
[1:03:55] to be wrong and to make things right
[1:03:59] Jesus makes things right and a Godly Man
[1:04:03] a Godly woman will make things right
[1:04:05] amen we're taught that principle all
[1:04:07] throughout scripture whether it's uh
[1:04:08] having conflict with a brother in the
[1:04:10] church or something that we we always
[1:04:13] strive to reconcile and make things
[1:04:15] right uh there's there's nothing wrong
[1:04:18] with being wrong if you're if you're
[1:04:20] willing to uh make it right
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:26] so we have to set an example for how in
[1:04:30] how we treat our wives Ephesians 525 God
[1:04:33] instructs men to love our wife instructs
[1:04:35] men to love our wives as Christ loved
[1:04:38] the church and so gave himself for it
[1:04:40] and that's a that's a pretty high
[1:04:41] standard to live up to and I preached it
[1:04:43] many times that uh husbands don't love
[1:04:47] naturally we we we we don't you know
[1:04:50] women women love naturally they're Born
[1:04:53] to Love and they they express love you
[1:04:56] know and and and men are like well I
[1:04:58] told you that I loved you 10 years ago
[1:05:01] it's still true I you know if it ever
[1:05:02] changes I'll let you know and so God
[1:05:05] specifically puts this command in there
[1:05:07] for us as husbands to love your wives to
[1:05:11] express love to your wife and so you
[1:05:13] know little children should see you
[1:05:16] giving Mama a hug little children should
[1:05:18] see you uh dancing around the the the
[1:05:22] the dining room with Mom you know just
[1:05:24] just holding one another hugging one
[1:05:26] another giving each other kisses and
[1:05:27] hugs and and laughing together and they
[1:05:29] should they they should know how much
[1:05:31] you love your wife how much you put her
[1:05:34] up on a pedestal I brother brother
[1:05:37] Carson I hope you don't mind this but
[1:05:38] the other day I I when we were we were
[1:05:41] sitting at dinner um I see where is
[1:05:44] brother Carson there he is he being
[1:05:47] blocked the other day you you had your
[1:05:49] phone we were sitting at dinner and I I
[1:05:51] seen what you had uh your wife labeled
[1:05:53] at that in your phone I thought that was
[1:05:57] beautiful so uh because in in my phone I
[1:06:01] have my wife
[1:06:03] labeled
[1:06:04] as NES shali which in Hebrew means my
[1:06:09] soul she's she's my
[1:06:12] queen and so I like that when I seen
[1:06:14] somebody else does that when somebody
[1:06:15] else has a you know this this is my my
[1:06:18] loved one this is this is who my soul
[1:06:20] desires and I've got her much Jus is
[1:06:24] everything to me kids should see that
[1:06:26] they should see that love that you have
[1:06:28] for your wife and know that nothing can
[1:06:30] ever come between that amen so they need
[1:06:34] to see that and then you know conversely
[1:06:38] children need to be be able to see the
[1:06:39] wife respecting the husband and honoring
[1:06:42] the husband and and and showing him the
[1:06:45] the ad admiration that he's due that he
[1:06:47] craves that he needs men work off of of
[1:06:50] affirmation and respect and so as wives
[1:06:53] you have to be able to Express that
[1:06:54] stuff when the children can hear it you
[1:06:56] know thank you honey for for getting uh
[1:06:59] for for providing thank you for always
[1:07:01] going to work thank you for being the
[1:07:03] provider that you are thank you for
[1:07:04] leading our home in Godly ways thank you
[1:07:06] for conducting that Bible study that was
[1:07:08] a real blessing you know I really
[1:07:10] enjoyed it and saying those little
[1:07:11] things it's not a stroking an ego it's
[1:07:14] respect because men need respect and
[1:07:17] children need to see that because that's
[1:07:19] modeling then the behavior and what
[1:07:22] they're to expect
[1:07:25] amen we have to model things you know
[1:07:27] you have
[1:07:29] to you have to date your wife well this
[1:07:33] is not not on my notes at all but you
[1:07:34] have to date your wife you have to
[1:07:37] continually pursue her and never stop
[1:07:41] just just as we passionately pursue uh
[1:07:45] Christ in our lives we can't ever stop
[1:07:47] pursuing our wife um it's not one of
[1:07:50] those things like oh we've got her we've
[1:07:52] captured her and we've drugged her back
[1:07:53] back to the cave you know like a caveman
[1:07:56] and now she can't escape and uh she has
[1:08:00] to feel wanted and needed and passionate
[1:08:03] and pursued and and and that you're
[1:08:06] always you always want to know more
[1:08:08] about her it's it's funny how how we're
[1:08:11] so completely different God made men and
[1:08:13] women so completely different you know
[1:08:16] if you a wife gives a husband a book on
[1:08:19] relationships you know the husband is
[1:08:21] like automatically what am I doing wrong
[1:08:24] why are you giving me this book what
[1:08:26] what's the lesson you're wanting me to
[1:08:27] learn here you know but you know the the
[1:08:30] husband brings a relationship book to
[1:08:32] the to the wife and is like hey honey
[1:08:34] here you go she's like wow this is
[1:08:36] amazing do you want to go through it
[1:08:37] together you know we can highlight
[1:08:39] things and and so you know that speaks
[1:08:41] that connection to her uh is you know
[1:08:45] it's just the same thing you know you
[1:08:46] buy your your husband uh uh some some
[1:08:50] dumbbells to lift you know for weights
[1:08:53] and he's like oh yeah this is great I
[1:08:54] can exercise he's not ever going to be
[1:08:56] like even if he's fat and out of shape
[1:08:58] he's never going to be like she got this
[1:09:00] for me because I'm fat and out of shape
[1:09:02] but if you get your wife exercise
[1:09:06] stuff she's going to think it's because
[1:09:09] she needs to use it we're just so
[1:09:10] different and God made us that way it's
[1:09:13] okay so don't ever do what I've done and
[1:09:15] buy your wife exercise stuff for her
[1:09:17] birthday because it does not go over
[1:09:20] well I
[1:09:22] promise amen so we got we have to aim
[1:09:24] for the right goal the goal of parenting
[1:09:26] is to bring our children up and nurture
[1:09:28] them uh in the ad in the fear and
[1:09:30] admonition of the Lord the goal of
[1:09:31] parenting is not to get children under
[1:09:34] control it's not to make them polite and
[1:09:38] respectful it's the goal of our our
[1:09:40] parenting is not to have little robots
[1:09:43] it's not to make them obedient that if
[1:09:45] we say jump they say jump and and ask
[1:09:48] when they can come
[1:09:49] down our our goal in parenting is to aim
[1:09:53] G our children towards Christ and all
[1:09:56] that they say all that we say and do
[1:09:57] that we point them always towards the
[1:09:59] cross towards a personal relationship
[1:10:02] with Jesus Christ and we see that
[1:10:04] reflected in in God's goal for us and he
[1:10:06] shows us the kind of goals that we
[1:10:08] should have for our children Deuteronomy
[1:10:10] 10: 12- 13 it says and now Israel what
[1:10:12] does the Lord your God ask of you but to
[1:10:15] fear that's reverence all respect the
[1:10:18] Lord your God to walk in all his ways to
[1:10:20] love him to serve the Lord your God with
[1:10:22] all your heart with all your Soul wow
[1:10:24] that sounds familiar and to observe the
[1:10:26] Lord's commands and decrees that I'm
[1:10:28] giving you today for your own
[1:10:31] good wow that's the that's that's that's
[1:10:34] the the same goals that God lays out for
[1:10:38] us as the goals that I want for my
[1:10:39] children that that the things that I
[1:10:42] teach them the things that they learn
[1:10:44] from me it's for their own good to walk
[1:10:47] in the right ways to walk in the right
[1:10:49] paths to establish the way of the Lord
[1:10:51] amen Micah 68 he has showed you oh man
[1:10:55] what is good and what does the Lord
[1:10:57] require of you to act justly and to love
[1:10:59] mercy and to walk humbly with your God
[1:11:02] and so I think that one of Christian
[1:11:04] parents greatest failures is having uh
[1:11:07] too low of expectations for their
[1:11:10] children we want our children to uh not
[1:11:14] do drugs we want them to uh you know not
[1:11:17] do poorly in school we want them to to
[1:11:20] do this or that but our our goals for
[1:11:23] our children should be first that we
[1:11:24] teach them to love the Lord we we we
[1:11:28] often times we set too low of goals it's
[1:11:30] a pretty good goal John I want my
[1:11:32] children to be successful and
[1:11:33] financially able and to you know to be a
[1:11:37] doctor or be a lawyer or be this or that
[1:11:40] but it's meaningless if they don't have
[1:11:43] Christ in their lives we put Christ we
[1:11:46] get Christ in their lives and get a
[1:11:48] solid relationship with with Jesus
[1:11:50] Christ and the Holy Spirit will lead and
[1:11:52] guide them amen yes amen so like I said
[1:11:55] my goal this morning is to give you
[1:11:57] something to help you uh practically in
[1:12:00] in joshua8 it says do not let this book
[1:12:03] of the law depart from your mouth
[1:12:04] meditate on it day and night so that you
[1:12:06] may be careful to do everything written
[1:12:08] in it then you will be prosperous and
[1:12:11] successful and too often we measure the
[1:12:14] the measure success by being prosperous
[1:12:17] or we measure success by the world
[1:12:19] standards but being successful in life
[1:12:21] is being part of God 's economy and
[1:12:24] being one of God's children knowing
[1:12:26] God's word living in obedience is what
[1:12:29] God repeatedly calls
[1:12:31] success me skip through just a little
[1:12:33] bit here some things that I've already
[1:12:35] kind of touched on I feel like I'm
[1:12:37] running out of
[1:12:39] time
[1:12:43] um amen so I I I touched on it briefly
[1:12:48] that that the the father's the head um
[1:12:52] and let me say this mom's first Ministry
[1:12:55] the we we all have a Ministry so to
[1:12:57] speak but Mom's mother's first Ministry
[1:12:59] is not to the
[1:13:01] children her first duty is to the
[1:13:04] husband her first duty is to minister to
[1:13:07] the husband then the children because
[1:13:09] she is part of him when God when God put
[1:13:12] us together he put us back together amen
[1:13:16] because we were one before the
[1:13:18] foundation of the world in Jesus Christ
[1:13:20] when we came we believe that that we
[1:13:23] separated just as Adam and Eve separated
[1:13:26] when Adam when God created Adam he the
[1:13:28] Lord says he he called their name Adam
[1:13:31] and Eve was still inside him and we
[1:13:33] believe that that then when Eve was
[1:13:36] taken out and separate person a separate
[1:13:39] personality that the ish and the ish and
[1:13:41] The Feminine was came out of Adam that
[1:13:43] coming back together the two shall
[1:13:46] become one for this for this cause shall
[1:13:48] husband uh man leave his father and wife
[1:13:50] and the two shall become one flesh not
[1:13:53] only not only is that just the the
[1:13:55] physical coming together but is the
[1:13:57] spiritual coming together as well and so
[1:14:00] the the wife must first first duty is to
[1:14:02] the husband and I say that because the
[1:14:06] overarching duty of the father is for
[1:14:09] the entire family right and so the the
[1:14:12] wife ministers to the husband she takes
[1:14:14] care of his niece she takes care of him
[1:14:16] um it's it's not it's not uh just the
[1:14:21] kids the kids the kids and the husbands
[1:14:23] neglected because the husband needs the
[1:14:25] wife we need one another I I cannot live
[1:14:29] without my wife I cannot live without
[1:14:33] her her affection and her admiration for
[1:14:36] me if we we've gone through great
[1:14:39] periods of Separation um with me being
[1:14:42] in the military and uh for weeks and
[1:14:45] months and you know at a time and it's
[1:14:49] it's affects me when I don't when my
[1:14:51] wife doesn't minister to me when she
[1:14:54] when she doesn't connect with me and we
[1:14:55] are unconnected and disconnected it it
[1:14:58] affects me and so Mama we we we love we
[1:15:03] love good Mothers and how that they they
[1:15:05] uh minister to the children but the
[1:15:07] first duty is to to the husband and that
[1:15:09] sets a order in the home U because in
[1:15:12] today's society children control the
[1:15:15] home and and children children run
[1:15:18] things by their emotions by their wants
[1:15:20] I want this I need this give me this
[1:15:22] give me that and so the children
[1:15:24] uh end up running parents ragged to
[1:15:26] practices and this event and that event
[1:15:28] and so you know we have to have have
[1:15:31] control and order in in the home a home
[1:15:34] is built through wisdom and and part of
[1:15:36] of wisely building a house is
[1:15:38] acknowledging that God has set things in
[1:15:40] order amen and so I referred to it e
[1:15:43] earlier that the head of every man is
[1:15:45] Christ and the head of the woman is the
[1:15:46] man and the head of Christ is god um and
[1:15:50] so we we we want our our sisters to live
[1:15:53] under the authority of the husband
[1:15:56] father's the head mom ministers to Dad
[1:15:58] she's under dad and over the kids but
[1:16:01] the authority uh is over the the the
[1:16:05] children not the other way around
[1:16:09] um excuse me as I'm just skipping
[1:16:11] through this 1 Corinthians 14:40 let
[1:16:14] everything be done decently and in an
[1:16:16] orderly way uh verse 33 the same same
[1:16:20] chapter uh for God is not the author of
[1:16:22] confus confusion but peace as in all the
[1:16:25] churches of the Saints and so proper
[1:16:28] family order is how we build the house
[1:16:31] we set things in order and we stick with
[1:16:33] it we don't let children manipulate us
[1:16:35] we don't let children
[1:16:38] uh well unfortunately many times we do
[1:16:40] let children manipulate us but we
[1:16:43] shouldn't
[1:16:45] um excuse
[1:16:52] me
[1:16:54] my like I said I use examples from my
[1:16:57] own life and
[1:17:00] um sometimes it gets me in trouble
[1:17:03] people don't don't like it when you use
[1:17:04] examples but my my oldest daughter she's
[1:17:07] married now we're very proud that she
[1:17:09] got married some of you came to the
[1:17:10] wedding we're so grateful that you came
[1:17:12] we're so proud of her uh
[1:17:17] she they got a little apartment and
[1:17:19] they're they're just Trucking along in
[1:17:21] life and you know we we went and visit
[1:17:23] them here a couple weeks ago and and
[1:17:25] just walking into their their little
[1:17:27] apartment you know and just you know
[1:17:29] hand me down furniture and everything
[1:17:31] else just like you know it's just like
[1:17:33] when we first started and so it's it was
[1:17:35] a little nostalgic in a way uh to to go
[1:17:38] and visit with them because of you know
[1:17:40] like when Laura and I first got married
[1:17:42] I think we had a cardboard table to eat
[1:17:44] at I think we had a we had a chair that
[1:17:47] the neighbor was he he was either
[1:17:49] throwing it in the trash or donating it
[1:17:51] to the Goodwill and I went over over
[1:17:53] there and got it at off the end of his
[1:17:54] driveway and somebody gave us a this
[1:17:58] couch from like the
[1:18:00] 1960s
[1:18:01] and you know we just didn't have nothing
[1:18:04] but we were happy you know and uh you
[1:18:08] know to so we walked in and we' seen all
[1:18:10] that and you know boxes and uh where
[1:18:14] where where do you guys eat at they
[1:18:15] don't even have a kitchen table well we
[1:18:16] just sit on the couch and eat
[1:18:19] okay that might get old but
[1:18:24] we uh so we're I'm proud I sure am proud
[1:18:26] of them and her her husband's a a fine
[1:18:29] young man and uh um pursuing the right
[1:18:34] things and and trying to get a career
[1:18:36] started as an electrician but uh I don't
[1:18:39] know why I kind of got down that Rabbit
[1:18:40] Trail but uh I guess because I'm getting
[1:18:42] ready to say something kind of bad about
[1:18:44] her so I wanted to say some good
[1:18:46] things so my my oldest daughter was very
[1:18:50] good at at I I don't want to call it
[1:18:54] manipulation but it is manipulation she
[1:18:56] would always be able to go to my wife
[1:18:59] and my wife would be like she would get
[1:19:01] in trouble and my wife would be like
[1:19:04] this is the law and You' have broken my
[1:19:06] Commandments and you will be
[1:19:08] chastised and then an hour or two later
[1:19:12] you know she would come in and she my
[1:19:15] daughter she would just be all sweet and
[1:19:17] loving and kind and and mommy don't you
[1:19:19] think this and don't you think that and
[1:19:22] and the next thing you know uh she
[1:19:25] wasn't grounded anymore you know it was
[1:19:28] just how she was she was just she knew
[1:19:30] her mama so well she knew exactly how to
[1:19:32] to approach her and to sweet talk her
[1:19:35] and smoo and she was just like a little
[1:19:38] politician and and uh always got her way
[1:19:42] uh well most of the time she got her way
[1:19:44] she got her way way too much but um you
[1:19:48] know what I'm what I'm getting at is is
[1:19:50] that we have we have to follow the order
[1:19:52] order and it has to be consistent and we
[1:19:55] can't let our children uh it's okay to
[1:19:57] let our children talk their way out of
[1:20:00] things sometimes you know and be like
[1:20:03] okay let you make a pretty good argument
[1:20:05] about why why I shouldn't have grounded
[1:20:07] you from that I'll go ahead and let you
[1:20:09] go this time but consistency is the PE
[1:20:13] is the key in in keeping order in the
[1:20:16] home amen so we have to uh focus on the
[1:20:21] right things and I don't I don't like we
[1:20:23] say
[1:20:26] uh you know get their heart right get
[1:20:29] their heart right um listen to your
[1:20:32] heart things like that are are just
[1:20:34] wrong
[1:20:36] um we we don't we're not we're not let
[1:20:39] me say it this way I'm not I would never
[1:20:43] give my children advice just listen to
[1:20:44] your heart and do what do what you think
[1:20:46] feels right because the heart is
[1:20:49] deceitfully wicked amen and and so it's
[1:20:53] not a question of listening to your
[1:20:54] heart it's a question of what does the
[1:20:55] word say what does the word say the word
[1:20:58] guides our decision-making process
[1:21:00] always the heart is deceitful above all
[1:21:03] things and desperately wicked who can
[1:21:05] understand it watch over your heart with
[1:21:06] all diligence for from it flow the
[1:21:09] Springs of Life from within out of the
[1:21:11] heart of men proceed the evil thoughts
[1:21:13] fornications thefts murders adulteries
[1:21:16] Deeds of coveting and wickedness as well
[1:21:17] as deceits sensuality Envy slander pride
[1:21:21] and foolish
[1:21:23] foolishness all out of the
[1:21:25] heart so we we don't I don't encourage
[1:21:29] my children to listen to their heart
[1:21:31] especially if they're they're unre
[1:21:34] unconverted amen our children have to
[1:21:37] know that they have Wicked and sinful
[1:21:38] hearts that are alienated from God from
[1:21:42] the very beginning um I I remember
[1:21:45] telling telling my two oldest one time
[1:21:47] that they were they were such beautiful
[1:21:49] little Sinners and they just laughed and
[1:21:52] laughed and laughed they thought that
[1:21:53] was funny but but I always Tred to put
[1:21:56] it before them that that they had to
[1:21:59] come to a a personal knowledge of Jesus
[1:22:02] Christ from a young age I've tried to
[1:22:04] encourage that in all my children that
[1:22:06] you can't just rely on Mom and Dad you
[1:22:09] have to come to a personal knowledge the
[1:22:11] the word of God is is for us as
[1:22:13] individuals and it says believe and you
[1:22:16] shall be saved repent and you shall
[1:22:18] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:20] and so I can't repent for you but I can
[1:22:23] I can show you the path through through
[1:22:25] my sacrifice through how I live my life
[1:22:27] that this is the way that the way the
[1:22:29] truth and the life amen because we are
[1:22:30] the light of the
[1:22:32] world Amen so skipping down and then let
[1:22:36] me I had a couple things I wanted to
[1:22:40] share with
[1:22:44] you first of all don't think like Jared
[1:22:47] brother Jared those of you have small
[1:22:49] kids don't don't think that I came and

[1:22:55] family and raising kids and nothing like
[1:22:58] that at all I promise I I'm a person who
[1:23:01] who preaches where I live so the things
[1:23:03] that I'm I'm studying the things that

[1:23:09] pull pit so um brother Dell didn't tell
[1:23:13] me hey you need to you need to talk
[1:23:14] about this or anything like
[1:23:17] that
[1:23:18] um I I I I think what I want to do is I
[1:23:22] I want to skip a bunch of this and just
[1:23:23] leave it and I want to um I thought I
[1:23:27] had it here I wanted to share with you I
[1:23:31] I pray for my children every
[1:23:34] day um and I pray for them
[1:23:38] specifically I pray for them in a
[1:23:40] specific way every day and and what I
[1:23:42] what I mean by that is I I pray prayers
[1:23:46] for my children that are scripture-based
[1:23:50] and I I speak God's word back to him
[1:23:55] over my children in prayer and I've done
[1:23:58] it for years and years and years and
[1:24:00] what I have is I have a a little card
[1:24:03] here with various prayers you know I
[1:24:06] think that I pray over my children and I
[1:24:09] put it on my my bathroom mirror and
[1:24:13] anytime I'm in the bathroom for years
[1:24:15] and years and years now I I have this
[1:24:18] there and as I'm brushing my teeth as
[1:24:21] I'm getting ready for the day or as I'm
[1:24:24] getting ready for bed I go through these
[1:24:26] prayers and I rehearse them to the Lord
[1:24:28] and I pray them over my children because
[1:24:31] the most powerful thing that we can do
[1:24:32] for our children is to pray for them and
[1:24:35] so I I want to share these with you and
[1:24:37] um I would encourage you to uh to copy
[1:24:41] them and and pray them
[1:24:44] yourselves and I guess since I don't
[1:24:46] have the the slide the slides up you
[1:24:48] won't be able to see them but you can
[1:24:50] always uh catch the gist and and uh go
[1:24:53] back and listen to the the tape I guess
[1:24:58] um the first one is I that I pray is I
[1:25:03] ask the Lord I say early in their lives
[1:25:05] fill my children with love for you that
[1:25:08] they would love you with all their heart
[1:25:10] with all their soul and with all their
[1:25:12] might I ask God to help me to train my
[1:25:17] children to love deeply sincerely and
[1:25:20] sacrificially seeing and loving others
[1:25:24] as he does and I ask him to empower me
[1:25:28] to to give me the strength to model his
[1:25:31] love and compassion towards them because
[1:25:36] as as fathers I think this is something
[1:25:37] that I learned very early on but
[1:25:39] regrettably it's something that I was I
[1:25:42] wish I would have have been better at I
[1:25:44] wish I was better at is that children
[1:25:45] get their concept of who God is from the
[1:25:49] father from their view of the Father the
[1:25:51] father is always angry angry and
[1:25:52] wrathful and always meeting out
[1:25:55] punishment then their children grow up
[1:25:57] with a concept that God is this angry
[1:26:00] God and so I I ask God to help me to
[1:26:04] model love and compassion for my
[1:26:05] children so that they know when they
[1:26:08] that if I if I'm going to be their
[1:26:10] example of what God is then I want it to
[1:26:14] be the right
[1:26:16] example I I asked God I said Give me
[1:26:20] give my children love for your word
[1:26:23] allow them to know it understand it and
[1:26:26] to follow it wholeheartedly Psalms 1
[1:26:30] 1-3 I pray fill them with the knowledge
[1:26:33] of your will and all spiritual wisdom
[1:26:35] and understanding so as to walk in a
[1:26:37] manner worthy of you fully pleasing to
[1:26:40] you bearing fruit in every good work and
[1:26:43] increasing in the knowledge of
[1:26:46] God another thing I pray is I ask God to
[1:26:50] compel them to pray Contin continually
[1:26:52] so that they will live and walk by his
[1:26:54] spirit that they would listen to him as
[1:26:57] Samuel
[1:26:58] did
[1:27:00] and if you if you recall Samuel heard
[1:27:03] the voice of
[1:27:05] God and it it was speaking to him and I
[1:27:09] want my children to hear his voice
[1:27:11] speaking to them I I want them to hear
[1:27:13] him speaking to their hearts and and to
[1:27:16] to hear his call in their
[1:27:20] lives I I pray help me to train my
[1:27:23] children according to the unique way
[1:27:25] that you have designed each one going
[1:27:27] over some of the scriptures that we we
[1:27:29] went through today because each one of
[1:27:32] them is unique they each have different
[1:27:33] strengths and talents each one is uh uh
[1:27:37] passionate about diff different things
[1:27:39] they care it this is something you know
[1:27:43] it's so hard sometimes for us as adults
[1:27:46] we want our children to be little adults
[1:27:48] too we want them to to just be just like
[1:27:51] these little men Min mes you know look
[1:27:53] at this that I have created it should be
[1:27:56] formed in my image and my model but
[1:27:58] children are they're different from us
[1:28:00] you know they have their own
[1:28:01] personalities they have their own things
[1:28:02] one of the hardest things for us to do
[1:28:04] is to connect with a child on their
[1:28:06] level and and and get down on their
[1:28:09] level and engage with them as a
[1:28:11] seven-year-old as a 10-year-old and and
[1:28:14] to like to interact with them in that
[1:28:16] way but it's so
[1:28:18] important I pray father enable me to
[1:28:22] commit them to your loving care control
[1:28:24] rather than to worry about them because
[1:28:28] I I don't know about you but worrying
[1:28:30] has really never solved anything worry
[1:28:33] has never really done anything you know
[1:28:34] when children go go up and they they
[1:28:36] they start making their decisions and
[1:28:38] you start allowing them to make their
[1:28:39] decisions and when they get out of the
[1:28:40] house the only thing you can do is is
[1:28:43] pray for them and you have to rely on
[1:28:45] the things that you've taught them and
[1:28:47] the things that you've modeled for them
[1:28:48] and and if you haven't model if you
[1:28:50] didn't model that you didn't do those
[1:28:52] things and you have to go back and you
[1:28:53] have to make it right and say listen I
[1:28:55] should have done this I should have done
[1:28:56] that I didn't I'm sorry please forgive
[1:28:58] me but I don't but sitting there
[1:29:00] worrying and fretting all the time it
[1:29:03] doesn't it doesn't do
[1:29:05] anything I I pray give them Godly
[1:29:07] friends that they would stir one another
[1:29:09] up to love and good works because
[1:29:13] friends uh like the Bible says you know
[1:29:17] a friend sticketh closer than a brother
[1:29:19] and and our children need friends they
[1:29:22] need good friends that that will rally
[1:29:25] around them that will that will not
[1:29:28] cause them to Stray From the Path and
[1:29:30] you hey let's go do this you know let's
[1:29:32] sneak out and go do this but our
[1:29:33] children need good Godly friends that
[1:29:36] will walk with them that will be like a
[1:29:39] a Jonathan to David and a David to
[1:29:42] Jonathan I pray I pray this ever since
[1:29:45] they were young cause them to be and to
[1:29:47] find a Godly spouse to or to glorify you
[1:29:50] in singleness if that's what what
[1:29:52] they're called to keep them sexually
[1:29:54] pure and honorable and I prayed this I
[1:29:57] prayed this for a young age for them
[1:30:00] because in this world there's so much
[1:30:04] Temptation there's so much Temptation in
[1:30:06] in pornography and and everything is
[1:30:08] just it's ever presentent it's
[1:30:10] everywhere you can't go to the
[1:30:12] supermarket without seeing it you um you
[1:30:15] know when when I was young you know is
[1:30:17] it it was pretty easy to stay away from
[1:30:19] that kind of thing because it was in a
[1:30:21] back room you know somewhere that you
[1:30:23] you know you would never walk into you
[1:30:24] know and and um the worst thing you saw
[1:30:27] was the tabloids at the supermarket and
[1:30:30] I didn't do much grocery shopping so I
[1:30:31] didn't see a lot of that but nowadays
[1:30:33] it's everywhere it's the Satan has put
[1:30:36] it in every in every type of Avenue from
[1:30:39] the the cartoons that we would allow our
[1:30:41] kids to watch now have uh lgbtq stuff in
[1:30:45] them and and the gender you know stuff
[1:30:48] and and um it's all there it's just all
[1:30:51] our our children are constantly being
[1:30:54] bombarded constantly being bombarded by
[1:30:56] the enemy amen so I you know I I want
[1:31:00] them to to to to be pure and honorable
[1:31:05] and keep them from those things I I pray
[1:31:07] Lord help them to be thankful and
[1:31:09] content to be thankful for what they've
[1:31:11] been given and it's
[1:31:15] gratitude is difficult for children to
[1:31:19] understand if they are always GI
[1:31:22] everything if we always give our
[1:31:24] children everything they want everything
[1:31:26] they ask for yeah they may say thank you
[1:31:28] for this but true gratitude comes from
[1:31:32] lack when when you don't have something
[1:31:35] and then you have it you're grateful to
[1:31:37] have it
[1:31:40] um it it might sound funny but it's good
[1:31:43] for children every once in a while to go
[1:31:45] hungry and and to to not have a have a
[1:31:48] lunch meal or a breakfast and only have
[1:31:50] a dinner meal you Express a little bit
[1:31:52] of gratitude for Mama for
[1:31:54] cooking um You probably won't hear Too
[1:31:56] Many people say that I don't mean go
[1:31:58] starve your children but you work hard
[1:32:01] all day you know and then you come home
[1:32:04] and you finally get a meal you're
[1:32:05] thankful for that meal you know and
[1:32:07] children children don't know AR aren't
[1:32:11] able to fully understand this concept of
[1:32:13] thankfulness and gratitude unless
[1:32:14] they've had it you know
[1:32:16] and in my in my life growing up we we
[1:32:20] were very poor we were very poor up
[1:32:23] until um my my dad when I was very young
[1:32:26] like one one or two years old my dad
[1:32:28] worked for the factory he made good
[1:32:30] money um but he was just getting started
[1:32:32] he certainly didn't come from General
[1:32:34] generational wealth he had just got out
[1:32:35] of the army uh the Vietnam ER and all
[1:32:38] that and um we lived in a a trailer park
[1:32:41] our our
[1:32:42] backyard was literally the dump where
[1:32:45] the city would come and dump things and
[1:32:48] we had nothing my dad then got laid off
[1:32:53] for nearly five
[1:32:55] years and if we had nothing before we
[1:32:58] had even less then and you know I
[1:33:02] distinctly I
[1:33:03] remember as as a kid uh going to school
[1:33:09] and at Christmas time they they would in
[1:33:12] classes as a little kid they would throw
[1:33:14] throw a little ball and then you know
[1:33:16] the children would throw a ball to each
[1:33:17] other when you caught the ball it was
[1:33:18] your turn and you would tell what you
[1:33:20] had got for Christmas
[1:33:22] and I I was really good at lying because
[1:33:26] I was embarrassed that I hadn't got
[1:33:28] anything and you know be oh I got a new
[1:33:30] bike or I got a new this or I got a new
[1:33:33] that and um we just didn't have it but
[1:33:37] then when when my dad got picked back up
[1:33:39] and and uh we finally got moved out of
[1:33:42] the trailer park and into a house and
[1:33:44] and they finally started giving us
[1:33:47] things you know because they could
[1:33:49] afford it I was grateful for it
[1:33:52] I was I was grateful for it you know and
[1:33:54] I I was glad to have little toys to play
[1:33:56] with and I was glad to have clothes that
[1:33:59] that didn't have you know uh five
[1:34:03] different patches in them because I wore
[1:34:05] them out and Grandma had to sew patches
[1:34:07] into my jeans and I was grateful that uh
[1:34:11] I remember many times waking up in the
[1:34:13] in the winter in the in the trailer that
[1:34:15] we lived in and uh Frost and Ice being
[1:34:18] on the inside of the walls because we
[1:34:20] didn't have enough money to keep things
[1:34:21] heated very well my eyes just brother
[1:34:23] Ram talks about his eyes being covered
[1:34:25] in matter I I've experienced that I
[1:34:27] don't know if you've ever experienced it
[1:34:29] but it's not pleasant you know your eyes
[1:34:30] are completely glued shut with with
[1:34:33] whatever that stuff is and you know to
[1:34:36] to not experience that anymore I was
[1:34:39] grateful I was grateful for a house that
[1:34:41] had heat I was grateful for uh you know
[1:34:44] to live in a in a in a when we moved to
[1:34:46] the to the house that I grew up in after
[1:34:48] that uh had a corn field behind it
[1:34:50] instead of a dump
[1:34:52] I just thought that was just wonderful
[1:34:55] and um so I was grateful I was grateful
[1:34:59] if we give our children too much they
[1:35:01] don't experience that that gratefulness
[1:35:03] and so sometimes it's good to withhold
[1:35:05] things from them for a little while and
[1:35:07] then and then bless them with it later
[1:35:09] so they experience
[1:35:12] gratitude uh
[1:35:14] amen be their Shield I I pray this be
[1:35:18] their shield in mind heart and body and
[1:35:20] guard them from the evil one I pray
[1:35:23] grant me wisdom and strength to raise my
[1:35:25] children in the discipline and
[1:35:26] instruction of the Lord and then lastly
[1:35:30] I pray let your favor rest upon my
[1:35:33] children let God's favor rest upon my
[1:35:36] children if I could ask nothing else God
[1:35:38] that you would just favor my children
[1:35:41] that you would bless them in spite of my
[1:35:43] failings in spite of my shortcomings in
[1:35:45] spite of all the things I've ever done
[1:35:46] wrong or tried to do right that your
[1:35:48] favor would rest upon them that's what I
[1:35:51] want I just want I want that for my
[1:35:53] children and so I pray these things I've
[1:35:56] kept this card uh I don't even know how
[1:35:59] long 10 12 years at least I've had it my
[1:36:02] wife can testify it I stick it in the
[1:36:04] corner of the mirror or and then I'll
[1:36:07] pray it I'll flip it over and I'll pray
[1:36:10] those and by God's grace my children
[1:36:13] will make it by God's grace my children
[1:36:15] will be there and it will be in spite of
[1:36:18] the failures that I've I've made the
[1:36:21] mistakes it'll be in spite of my best
[1:36:25] intentions falling short but by God's
[1:36:28] grace I believe for my
[1:36:30] children um I've got a lot more to say
[1:36:33] and and I'm looking at the little clock
[1:36:35] here and I know I've run a little I've
[1:36:37] run over and I thank you for being so
[1:36:39] attentive and so gracious uh I pray
[1:36:42] somehow some way this this was a help to
[1:36:44] you um especially those of you still
[1:36:47] with children in the household but even
[1:36:52] even those of you who who who have
[1:36:54] children who've
[1:36:55] gone um grandchildren are Second Chance
[1:36:59] grandchildren are second chance and um
[1:37:03] I'm personally looking forward
[1:37:05] to I guess I shouldn't say it that way I
[1:37:08] say I'm looking forward to having the
[1:37:10] first one but um that would kind of
[1:37:12] sound like she's expecting she's
[1:37:14] not but I'm looking forward to when she
[1:37:16] does so I can make up for some of the
[1:37:18] mistakes that I made when they were
[1:37:20] young um I'm I'm so grateful that the
[1:37:23] Lord that God is a god of Second Chances
[1:37:26] amen let's just bow our heads and close
[1:37:28] in word prayer father thank you Lord for
[1:37:31] your word for the attentiveness of your

[1:37:47] sometimes when we we talk about these
[1:37:49] things it can it can almost seem
[1:37:50] overwhelming in a way it's like I can't
[1:37:52] do everything the preacher said I can't
[1:37:54] remember all that but help us to to take
[1:37:57] away this the the one or two things that
