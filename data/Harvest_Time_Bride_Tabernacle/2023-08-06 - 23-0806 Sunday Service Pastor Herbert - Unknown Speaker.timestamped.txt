[32:15] with uh
[32:17] our subject
[32:20] we shall continue
[32:23] yeah
[32:28] okay we can start up
[32:36] so while we are standing like that
[32:40] uh
[32:42] uh we shall read from the book of
[32:46] Saint John chapter 15.
[32:55] Saint John chapter 15
[32:58] verse 13.
[33:15] and the verse
[33:17] 15 verse 13 to verse 15.
[33:23] greater love has no man than this
[33:28] that a man lay down his life for his
[33:31] friends
[33:35] you are my friends if you do whatever I
[33:39] command you
[33:42] uh henceforth I call you not servants
[33:47] for this servant no it's not what his
[33:51] Lord doeth
[33:53] but I have called you friends
[33:57] for all things that I have heard of my
[34:01] father
[34:03] I have made known unto you
[34:08] father once again we ask that
[34:11] you escort the reading of the words with
[34:14] your blessings
[34:16] father may you expound your word again
[34:19] to our
[34:20] Hearts to our lives
[34:23] that this word may edify us father
[34:27] that we may be more
[34:29] more nearer to you and the more look
[34:34] like you O Father and a more spiritual
[34:38] father make us everything more and more
[34:41] and more
[34:42] as we are approaching the nearing of you
[34:45] are coming
[34:46] bless us this morning
[34:49] Lord take me out of the way
[34:52] and your word is yours not mine
[34:55] so that you do what you want as you can
[34:59] talk to us
[35:00] in Jesus name Lord we pray amen
[35:04] we may be seated
[35:09] all right
[35:11] now let me try to go back to the
[35:14] foundation yesterday
[35:16] uh
[35:18] try to look at the foundation then see
[35:21] how what we are going to build on top
[35:24] today
[35:26] so yesterday we we saw how our Lord
[35:31] Jesus Christ
[35:33] he was fulfilling a scripture somewhere
[35:36] in the book of Deuteronomy
[35:38] I think it was Deuteronomy chapter 18
[35:41] verse somewhere there is is the verse 15
[35:44] or what it was fulfilling because uh
[35:48] Moses told the children of Israel that
[35:51] the Lord God
[35:53] shall raise you a prophet like me
[35:56] under him you should listen to
[36:01] right if you don't listen you become
[36:03] disobedient
[36:05] if you listen then you are obedient
[36:08] and then the Lord can start to build
[36:11] good things on the top of the foundation
[36:13] of obedience
[36:15] so now when our Lord was there
[36:18] with the disciples and the Pharisees
[36:23] then those people were not listening to
[36:26] him
[36:28] they were doubting him
[36:31] they were starting to fast with him
[36:35] so it prompted him
[36:38] to court for them
[36:40] about
[36:42] the only woman who was the woman of very
[36:44] fast
[36:46] of zidon the Widow
[36:49] and then he quoted it to them
[36:52] about Norman the Reaper
[36:57] there he finished his courting
[37:01] and then it was our job to see let's go
[37:04] through the Bible
[37:06] and find out why did he quote that
[37:10] and why did he say something in the book
[37:13] of
[37:14] Matthew chapter 10.
[37:17] that's when verse 41 42.
[37:22] he who will receive a prophet
[37:27] in a prophetess name
[37:30] will receive a reward
[37:34] that's right
[37:35] so we got another things put them
[37:39] together
[37:43] who said it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:47] who commanded and he commissioned that
[37:50] whoever
[37:52] whether you will be in 2023
[37:56] whether you are in what age as long as
[37:58] if I can send a prophet
[38:01] remember that behind the prophet there
[38:04] is a sender
[38:06] and that sender
[38:09] is the Lord himself
[38:14] because somewhere in the Book of Romans
[38:17] chapter 10 he said but how can they call
[38:21] on him of whom they have never heard of
[38:27] and how can they hear about him if there
[38:29] is no a saint person a preacher someone
[38:33] who has been sent
[38:36] so there we discovered that God prepares
[38:40] the three things
[38:42] he prepares himself
[38:45] with what to do
[38:47] and then he prepares a right person to
[38:51] send that's the prophet
[38:54] and then he prepares
[38:56] the true receiver
[39:00] because down there in the book of Isaiah
[39:02] where we did not really talk about or
[39:05] maybe we did not read it says but who
[39:07] has received our report
[39:10] who
[39:12] so there must be some people
[39:15] who are prepared
[39:19] to receive a prophet
[39:22] as they receive him they have received
[39:25] God
[39:29] so if they listen to him then we shall
[39:33] we find that the three things must be in
[39:37] line
[39:39] God who is Ever righteous omnipotent
[39:42] omniscientity never changes he's always
[39:45] holy for him he is intact
[39:49] he is always there
[39:51] so the only people who have to amend
[39:54] themselves and listen and be obedient
[39:57] must be a prophet and a receiver
[40:00] so that's why God starts with a prophet
[40:03] he starts with him
[40:07] so he starts with him then we saw a good
[40:11] example
[40:12] that was Elijah in the Bible
[40:15] God called Elijah
[40:18] and the commissioned him to go under
[40:20] dwell by the river kill it
[40:23] whereby
[40:25] if you see the circumstances of the
[40:28] river
[40:30] the river always consists of so many
[40:33] things
[40:35] too much mosquitoes there
[40:38] snakes there
[40:40] all kind of
[40:42] things animals
[40:45] they stay by the river there not a human
[40:48] being
[40:50] but he was sent there
[40:54] God was laying what we call a good
[40:57] foundation
[40:59] in a prophet so that he can be of great
[41:03] use to help others
[41:07] in otherwise God Was preparing him to be
[41:10] a good conduit is a transition that
[41:14] things can reach somewhere crossed
[41:17] through him
[41:19] a good person an obedient person
[41:23] so there we discovered all those things
[41:26] in Elijah
[41:28] and so on
[41:32] but
[41:34] we want to see
[41:37] there is a question
[41:41] there is a question that they asked
[41:44] brother Branham
[41:48] if you read
[41:50] c-o-d
[41:52] if you read a message
[41:55] this big book
[41:57] the red ones
[41:59] page one
[42:01] thousand and 42 there was a question
[42:04] that they asked brother Branham
[42:08] okay let me read the question
[42:13] brother Branham
[42:15] if you have time
[42:17] please explain in Matthew
[42:20] chapter 10 verse 41.
[42:23] I would like to know what is a prophet's
[42:26] reward
[42:29] now he answers
[42:32] well now
[42:34] Jesus said who's ever receive a prophet
[42:38] in the name of our Prophet receiver
[42:43] Prophet is a reward
[42:46] a prophet his reward is to be
[42:49] a friend with the prophet
[42:52] whosoever receives a righteous man in
[42:55] the name of a richest man receive a
[42:58] righteous man his reward
[43:01] is that right
[43:04] and if they want to know what a prophet
[43:07] is reward is
[43:09] is to be a friend to the prophet see
[43:14] that is a reward he is your friend like
[43:19] a mighty woman
[43:22] it might become in handy sometimes see
[43:26] it did with her see what
[43:30] God is servants
[43:37] Holy Spirit if we will manifest every
[43:40] promise that is uh okay let me end there
[43:44] Watch God's servants so this is a
[43:47] question that they asked brother Branham
[43:50] then he gives us a small crew that like
[43:54] a mighty woman
[43:56] so then when we go in the Bible we find
[44:00] this the mighty woman
[44:03] who is
[44:04] being a prophet
[44:07] in our home
[44:09] and even she proposed that we should
[44:11] make here a small extension whereby when
[44:15] this man comes and is tired he gets some
[44:19] food here and maybe something he had to
[44:22] drink and he lays down and he goes she
[44:25] received him
[44:27] in other times she received him
[44:31] and she made him like a real good friend
[44:33] because a prophet is God Is A Friend how
[44:37] do they start to be God his friend
[44:39] when they are obedient
[44:43] God
[44:44] when when when God chooses a prophet
[44:49] and he becomes obedient to his command
[44:55] or to his directives
[44:58] then God raises that Prophet to a level
[45:03] that he now calls him my friend
[45:07] so when he becomes a friend of God then
[45:11] he also as he goes on proclaiming the
[45:15] word of God to the Believers they also
[45:19] believe the word of God through the
[45:21] prophet and the time will come that
[45:24] those Believers also they elevate to a
[45:28] level of also becoming friends
[45:32] they also become friends of the Prophet
[45:35] as a prophet is also a friend of God so
[45:39] any times all were all of us then we
[45:42] become friends of God
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:50] praise the Lord
[45:52] yeah that's why I have gone with you in
[45:56] the Book of John
[45:58] chapter 14 15 where we have read that uh
[46:04] he he revealed to them
[46:07] he revealed to them that this is what we
[46:10] call Great not great only but greater
[46:17] Greater Love
[46:20] praise the Lord so he revealed to them
[46:25] he revealed to this uh to to his
[46:27] disciples that are greater love has no
[46:32] money than it is
[46:33] that a man lay down his life for his
[46:36] friends in other times he said
[46:39] if you go somewhere he said for their
[46:41] sake I sanctify myself
[46:45] Jesus say this all for their sake I
[46:49] sanctify myself
[46:53] and then time came that he died
[46:57] so some people did not realize why
[47:02] but now he's revering to them that the
[47:05] real ones
[47:07] that I'm gonna die for
[47:10] so by that time
[47:13] he was not yet
[47:15] but he was he was forward revealing to
[47:20] them he was
[47:22] giving them a crew
[47:24] that
[47:25] when I will be
[47:28] crucified when I will die on the cross
[47:32] that kind of love is called greater but
[47:36] it is a proper City for the friends
[47:46] praise the Lord
[47:49] yeah okay
[47:52] now let us explain a little bit about
[47:55] something friend
[47:57] the Bible tells me
[48:00] that Abram
[48:02] was lifted to a level of becoming God's
[48:07] friend
[48:09] but after some trials
[48:12] he underwent so many trials and so on
[48:15] and he was proved
[48:19] and he was qualified
[48:22] to be called a friend of God for example
[48:27] in the book of second Chronicles chapter
[48:30] 20 verse 7 says like this
[48:32] art not thou our God
[48:36] who did this to drive out the
[48:39] inhabitants of this land before thy
[48:42] People Israel and I gave a state to the
[48:45] Seed of Abraham thy friend forever
[48:50] you see
[48:52] so Abram became God is a friend
[48:59] and also in somewhere in the book of
[49:01] Isaiah chapter 41 verse 8 it says like
[49:04] this but thou Israel
[49:07] at my servant Jacob whom I have chosen
[49:12] the Seed of Abraham my friend
[49:18] so
[49:19] good himself is testifying
[49:22] that Abraham my friend
[49:30] also in the New Testament there's
[49:32] another
[49:34] um witness here James chapter 2 verse 23
[49:37] he says like this under the scripture
[49:40] was fulfilled
[49:43] which saith
[49:44] Abram believed God and it was imputed
[49:49] unto him for righteousness and that he
[49:53] was called the friend of God
[50:00] that is right
[50:03] so you find out that uh brother Branham
[50:06] has answered the question
[50:10] has answered in the Book of Matthew
[50:11] which we read yesterday
[50:14] and now we see how things goes how
[50:17] things goes that okay for you to achieve
[50:21] and get a reward you must totally be
[50:24] obedient and you must totally stand in
[50:28] the line
[50:30] and you make the three things line up so
[50:34] perfect so that when a promise comes it
[50:39] comes through when everybody comes it
[50:42] goes through very clear and good to you
[50:49] that's how we receive our Rewards
[50:52] that's how we become the friends of God
[50:55] that's how we can stand trials
[50:59] praise the Lord so
[51:01] you you will find that uh
[51:04] when brother Branham is saying like that
[51:08] about the sunamite woman then he also
[51:11] has a story
[51:13] that we all of us know
[51:15] that one day
[51:17] brother Branham
[51:19] was on his Service as a post office
[51:23] down there in Memphis
[51:26] his plane was grounded
[51:29] that he stayed there and I did not go
[51:32] under the Holy Spirit
[51:35] lead him
[51:37] to go to a certain woman
[51:40] whose son was dying
[51:45] and a god
[51:47] could listen to the prayer under God
[51:49] listened to the prayers of this woman
[51:52] the woman prayed all the night
[51:56] she was a real faithful woman with faith
[52:01] I was looking at this morning to to
[52:04] in this message book expectation
[52:08] and I want to read again uh
[52:12] uh what brother Brahman was doing
[52:14] um
[52:15] so
[52:18] he went down there
[52:20] and I said he met this woman
[52:24] and the woman said the person
[52:27] those people down there they would call
[52:29] a preacher person
[52:31] and then he said how do you know me
[52:34] brother says how did you know me
[52:38] she said
[52:41] in the Bible
[52:47] in the Bible
[52:49] and uh
[52:51] she had prayed yesterday or the night
[52:55] and the god listen to our prayers
[52:58] but God could not do anything
[53:02] but God wanted
[53:05] like like a widow woman in the Bible
[53:08] and with the woman who in the Bible she
[53:10] was a good woman she couldn't pray and
[53:12] the God can listen but God did not do
[53:15] any Miracle until
[53:18] he lined the heart in a straight line
[53:22] according to his own program
[53:28] so God wanted brother I mean
[53:31] Prophet Elijah
[53:33] after going through the tests and so on
[53:37] to go down there
[53:39] and line up
[53:41] put a woman with a woman in a line uh
[53:44] when whether she's trying to
[53:47] um
[53:47] kind of like fussing kind of like maybe
[53:50] doubting or maybe trying to make some
[53:53] reasoning capacity but the little food
[53:55] that I have is only for me and my son so
[53:59] when we eat and we die but the prophet
[54:01] said no no no no no you do this okay
[54:05] do it first do this bring for me first
[54:08] stand in the line listen to my voice do
[54:11] according to my voice because it is mine
[54:14] there's someone also behind me
[54:18] praise the Lord
[54:20] so when she lined up in the line the
[54:23] Miracles starting to happen
[54:25] so God is not God of shortcuts and
[54:28] whatever when he wants to do his things
[54:30] in his own program what you do just line
[54:34] up and be obedient
[54:40] so this is shunamite I mean this woman
[54:43] down there in Memphis she already prayed
[54:46] her only son was dying that's true
[54:51] her only son was dying
[54:53] but the Lord God revealed to her
[54:57] that I will send a prophet to you I will
[55:01] send someone to you
[55:03] and there will be some kind of some
[55:05] question is and you will answer and soon
[55:10] you line up and the things will go well
[55:14] amen
[55:15] then when he came down
[55:18] to that a woman
[55:21] and there she was patting him and okay
[55:25] uh
[55:28] I tell you
[55:32] I tell you about her
[55:34] the prophet and I said person
[55:38] he took the road that's wrong when he's
[55:40] about okay now she is explaining to a
[55:46] prophet about how her son took a wrong
[55:50] away
[55:51] and I got a group and she contracted a
[55:55] disease
[55:56] [Music]
[55:58] let me start from here she said and I
[56:02] said do you know my name
[56:04] she said no sir I said how do you know I
[56:08] was a person she said the person said
[56:11] did you ever hear about the shunamite
[56:15] woman that had a baby
[56:18] by the Lord
[56:21] promised her the baby and the baby died
[56:25] and I said yes
[56:29] she said I was a woman that way
[56:33] and I promised the Lord that I would
[56:35] raise my baby for him and I said the
[56:38] Lord give me husband and I am love and I
[56:42] I I lovely boy and I said person
[56:46] he took the road that's wrong when he's
[56:48] about a few years ago and I said he got
[56:51] a dangerous disease then real disease
[56:54] and I said uh it went so long on him we
[56:58] didn't suspect it and I said and now
[57:01] he's laying in the room dying say the
[57:04] doctor has given him all kinds of shots
[57:07] and said he can't get well and I said
[57:10] he's been unconscious since yesterday
[57:12] the doctor was back here and I said look
[57:16] for the worst at any time there was no
[57:19] hopes for him his blood was four plus
[57:21] and nothing could help him at all and I
[57:24] said he is dying
[57:27] and said I got down on my knees
[57:32] and I said I prayed and said I prayed
[57:37] oh lord said
[57:40] is a woman like this where
[57:43] where is Eurasia
[57:46] so this woman is telling the stories to
[57:49] a prophet
[57:50] said I got down on my knees and I prayed
[57:53] and I prayed and asked God where is
[57:55] Elijah
[57:58] praise the Lord
[58:01] the same story in the Bible was
[58:04] repeating
[58:07] and they just begin to praying said I
[58:10] prayed and I prayed and I said this
[58:13] morning just before daylight saved the
[58:16] Lord told
[58:18] stand at this gate
[58:21] so this woman said that the Lord told
[58:23] her stand out to the gate
[58:26] and they wait to line up in a true line
[58:29] so that I can perform things purely and
[58:34] so smoothly
[58:36] so
[58:38] under there was her back I was wait
[58:40] where she had been standing
[58:43] she was entertaining me anything wrong
[58:45] she said and look
[58:48] oh my
[58:50] begin to I walked into the house there
[58:54] was a great big Husky looking boy and
[58:56] she parted him he was laying there with
[58:59] with a blanket in his hand going
[59:03] like that and he was saying mommy it's
[59:07] so dark
[59:09] I don't know where
[59:11] it's going mommy like that
[59:15] she said honey child do you know Mommy
[59:19] child he was of course no matter how old
[59:23] you are You Are Mother's child just the
[59:25] same no matter what you've done you will
[59:28] still mother's boy
[59:29] and there she was patting him and loving
[59:32] him
[59:33] she said do you know Mommy saying you
[59:37] know your mommy he didn't seem like he
[59:39] recognized her he's hollering mommy
[59:42] going on he was unconscious like in that
[59:46] condition
[59:48] and that's all she said okay
[59:50] you know very well the story
[59:52] you know very well the story I will
[59:54] continue running maybe reading
[59:57] money you will find that brother brother
[59:59] must say
[1:00:01] I
[1:00:03] obeyed
[1:00:05] to the leadership of the spirit
[1:00:11] praise the Lord
[1:00:12] so it became obedient
[1:00:15] regardless of their situation at the
[1:00:19] airport whether the plane will deliver
[1:00:22] what God was in control of everything
[1:00:29] you see how God is great
[1:00:33] you see
[1:00:34] so therefore
[1:00:36] this woman here
[1:00:38] she lined up
[1:00:41] she she's also she has a face she prayed
[1:00:45] God listens but in other times God
[1:00:48] wanted to make a very good example put
[1:00:52] here in the life to make the three
[1:00:54] things go perfectly so that everybody
[1:00:56] comes
[1:00:58] there
[1:01:00] her boy was revived to life
[1:01:03] and the boy did not die
[1:01:07] that's right
[1:01:10] there's another story
[1:01:13] about sister Hattie
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:17] when brother brother was telling a
[1:01:20] testimony about hunting the squirrels
[1:01:25] that you may not find squirrels in his
[1:01:27] kamora trees sometimes
[1:01:30] but God did provide them in his
[1:01:32] commercial
[1:01:34] he was narrating the story
[1:01:37] some people were there listening
[1:01:39] listening but maybe in their hearts they
[1:01:41] were saying wow what is this
[1:01:43] but this lady here
[1:01:46] she jumped in the line
[1:01:49] showing obedience and the breathing
[1:01:52] said oh no matter whatever what God does
[1:01:57] he does it
[1:02:00] when she said a very good word it really
[1:02:03] made God you're happy
[1:02:06] God is so hard jumping in the line
[1:02:08] straight
[1:02:10] lining up with a prophet
[1:02:12] and the God is said ask her to ask
[1:02:16] anything
[1:02:18] and I do it because now
[1:02:21] I have elevated her
[1:02:24] I have lived here
[1:02:26] to a friend level
[1:02:29] she is your friend as you are my friend
[1:02:32] therefore things are going smoothly
[1:02:35] asking her to ask anything
[1:02:41] praise the Lord
[1:02:46] so therefore let me go back to about the
[1:02:49] what Jesus said
[1:02:52] so when Jesus
[1:02:53] said
[1:02:55] you I no longer call you servants
[1:02:59] but now I call you friends
[1:03:01] because all things
[1:03:04] that I have had
[1:03:07] I have revealed them to you
[1:03:12] so becoming a friend is another great
[1:03:14] level
[1:03:18] you become a friend after undergoing so
[1:03:22] many trials
[1:03:25] after being tested under tried and have
[1:03:29] been proven to be a true Royal servant
[1:03:35] then God takes away that title of
[1:03:39] servant and puts you into being a friend
[1:03:47] Hallelujah
[1:03:49] after being proven
[1:03:51] for example
[1:03:54] uh in somewhere in the book of world
[1:04:00] even if Jesus did not mention this in
[1:04:03] the Book of John 15
[1:04:06] he mentioned this in the Book of Luke
[1:04:09] uh I won't read that verse on him he
[1:04:12] mentioned this thing in the Book of Luke
[1:04:15] chapter
[1:04:17] 22
[1:04:22] chapter 22
[1:04:25] uh
[1:04:37] let me see chapter 22 verse 28
[1:04:41] . he said like this
[1:04:45] you are
[1:04:47] they
[1:04:49] which have continued with me in my
[1:04:54] Temptations
[1:04:56] and verse 29 and I appoint unto you a
[1:05:02] kingdom
[1:05:03] is my father has appointed unto me
[1:05:07] you see now
[1:05:09] it is the same thing
[1:05:13] that
[1:05:17] the disciples and all the Believers who
[1:05:20] are with Jesus most of them
[1:05:24] they
[1:05:25] back seed
[1:05:29] most of them they drew back
[1:05:35] and they never continued with him
[1:05:38] but some will continue them some of them
[1:05:41] were just hypocrites
[1:05:45] they were not genuine
[1:05:48] because someone will also find some
[1:05:51] doubted him some worshiped him
[1:05:57] now he's saying
[1:05:59] you are they you are those
[1:06:04] who have continued with me
[1:06:07] in my temptation is and at this
[1:06:11] particular level
[1:06:13] now I appoint you a kingdom
[1:06:17] That You Will Rule under you will judge
[1:06:21] how do you become a judge
[1:06:24] the Bible says
[1:06:27] we shall judge but how do you become a
[1:06:30] judge
[1:06:31] you become a judge because you are safe
[1:06:35] is not judged
[1:06:38] that's right
[1:06:40] in other times he said how can you take
[1:06:43] out a beam of on your friends on
[1:06:47] yes and you are said if you have it
[1:06:52] so that means
[1:06:54] you have to be undergoing so many trials
[1:06:58] so many temptations that you stand and
[1:07:02] overcome and then you are qualified to
[1:07:06] be a judge
[1:07:09] because what you say you know it
[1:07:13] that's right
[1:07:15] so when he said I appoint your kingdom
[1:07:18] that means they have withstand they have
[1:07:22] stood a lot and they are believed and
[1:07:26] that they have tolerated all kind of
[1:07:29] problems all kind of trials they have
[1:07:33] never forsaken me Jesus they have
[1:07:35] continued with him in All The
[1:07:38] Temptations until they reached a level
[1:07:41] that he elevated them to call them
[1:07:45] friends and as well to appoint them that
[1:07:48] you will be judges
[1:07:55] yes
[1:07:57] how
[1:07:58] it's because
[1:08:01] there are some situations
[1:08:05] whereby
[1:08:08] so many backseat for example when he
[1:08:12] started to preach about eating my fresh
[1:08:14] and drinking my blood
[1:08:17] many people became offended
[1:08:21] they did not do understand and they did
[1:08:24] not even ask but what they did is to go
[1:08:27] back and Jesus did not go and he just
[1:08:31] said to Peter do you also want to go
[1:08:35] like others
[1:08:37] Jesus behaving as if that's not the job
[1:08:40] that brought him
[1:08:42] the job that brought him is to gather
[1:08:46] the Sheep to give the anointed to sakata
[1:08:48] but now there's scattering as if he is
[1:08:51] again supporting because he's telling
[1:08:54] Peter do you also want to go
[1:09:01] it is a Peter who defended himself and
[1:09:03] said it to whom another shall we go
[1:09:06] in other times Jesus was looking as if
[1:09:09] he's not caring because he was putting
[1:09:12] them
[1:09:13] on a test to see if they will stand with
[1:09:15] him
[1:09:20] also
[1:09:22] he did not send them away
[1:09:25] so that he can hide and
[1:09:27] and start fasting with the Pharisees
[1:09:31] he allowed them to listen
[1:09:34] he allowed them he allowed them to see
[1:09:37] how the composition or whatever goes on
[1:09:44] okay
[1:09:47] he said you are Father Abraham
[1:09:50] rejoiced when he saw my day
[1:09:55] the Pharisees are listening the
[1:09:57] disciples are listening here Jesus is
[1:10:00] starting a spiritual war
[1:10:06] and things are not going to be right
[1:10:07] it's a real spiritual World fighting
[1:10:10] with words
[1:10:12] he's entering a Battle Ground
[1:10:16] your father
[1:10:17] a Brown when he saw me on my bed he
[1:10:21] rejoiced ah
[1:10:24] therefore as he said
[1:10:26] started
[1:10:31] so the war started
[1:10:33] how come that you are not even not fatty
[1:10:37] and you have seen Abraham
[1:10:41] then he also said here don't think that
[1:10:44] you have life do you have anything in
[1:10:47] the Bible you you you you look into the
[1:10:50] scriptures thinking that you have life
[1:10:51] and I refuse to come to me
[1:10:54] then they said oh until they send you a
[1:10:57] Bill's the book
[1:10:58] the disciples are listening
[1:11:05] and they also said okay
[1:11:09] if a house is divided it cannot stand if
[1:11:13] a kingdom is divided it cannot stand so
[1:11:16] therefore I am not I bet you see a
[1:11:21] stronger man it takes a stronger man to
[1:11:24] bind a stronger man in the house then he
[1:11:26] can read his things so you so he was oh
[1:11:30] it was a real of Great War
[1:11:33] and then
[1:11:36] all of a sudden said
[1:11:38] you
[1:11:39] you are over your father the devil
[1:11:43] and they said okay
[1:11:45] started binding teeth
[1:11:47] looking for mistakes
[1:11:49] trying to see I it was a great War
[1:11:55] but
[1:11:56] out of that
[1:11:59] that great to war
[1:12:01] all things that happen
[1:12:03] plus the doctrine that he said his
[1:12:07] what is fresh was
[1:12:10] meat indeed
[1:12:12] and whatever it made so many people not
[1:12:16] to trust it and follow him no longer
[1:12:22] until Remain the real ones
[1:12:25] remember the the story of Gideon when he
[1:12:29] called everyone let's go let's go on the
[1:12:32] fight
[1:12:33] let's go on the fight let's go
[1:12:35] and the God said there are too many for
[1:12:38] nothing
[1:12:40] reduce them
[1:12:42] reduce them
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:47] and when he introduce them
[1:12:50] here again he said there are still many
[1:12:55] let's give them a test
[1:12:59] take them to the river
[1:13:02] to go on a drink water
[1:13:06] you know some people you can't give them
[1:13:08] something when they are not in need in
[1:13:10] that time
[1:13:13] by telling people to go out and drink
[1:13:15] water
[1:13:17] I know many of them question themselves
[1:13:19] wow I'm just going to pretend why should
[1:13:23] I drink water for what
[1:13:26] they didn't understand
[1:13:30] you know sometimes when God tells you
[1:13:33] something
[1:13:34] he does not go through explaining it to
[1:13:38] you
[1:13:39] because it is your test
[1:13:43] it remains there
[1:13:46] and then
[1:13:48] they went down to the river
[1:13:51] and God told Gideon
[1:13:54] that whoever will put down his mouth
[1:13:57] into a river
[1:14:00] part them decide
[1:14:02] whoever will put a hand and lick like a
[1:14:05] dog
[1:14:06] this like this and then here like this
[1:14:08] like a dog
[1:14:10] Pat them this way
[1:14:13] so
[1:14:15] no one told one
[1:14:17] what to do
[1:14:18] but
[1:14:20] some of them
[1:14:22] they just blended into a will of God
[1:14:27] and I did what God wanted
[1:14:31] that's why Paul said you need to be
[1:14:34] patient until you do the will of God
[1:14:39] cast not your reward
[1:14:43] which has a great recompense
[1:14:46] so cast not your faith
[1:14:49] Keep On Believing keep on going back
[1:14:51] because he said God is not happy for
[1:14:54] anyone to draw back
[1:14:56] as he said in the book of Hebrews 10 35
[1:14:59] there
[1:15:00] so therefore that's how God tried his
[1:15:02] people
[1:15:03] he reduced them
[1:15:06] to a good quality
[1:15:08] you cannot go under dig diamonds and
[1:15:12] then carry a full load of a track and
[1:15:15] say I've got Diamond no you must take
[1:15:17] that diamond to a test and
[1:15:20] tests you will do until you get the
[1:15:23] small refined one which has the weaker
[1:15:26] the best quality needed
[1:15:30] so no wonder you see people are
[1:15:32] backsliding you don't know
[1:15:37] did the pews were meant to be seated on
[1:15:40] people
[1:15:41] fill up until they make more Appeals but
[1:15:45] now you see people have gone away
[1:15:47] what are they doing
[1:15:50] some people are just positioning
[1:15:52] themselves to the positions they want to
[1:15:54] be
[1:15:55] but I want to add the jail I want to
[1:15:59] cheer you I want to tell you that please
[1:16:03] you are in the right track Never draw
[1:16:06] back
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:09] keep on breathing
[1:16:13] see a good example in the Bible how
[1:16:16] Jesus is saying you are they that have
[1:16:20] continued with me during my temptation
[1:16:24] is
[1:16:27] so the word of God this message also has
[1:16:32] been undergoing many many trials the
[1:16:36] message
[1:16:39] but now you don't say oh this message is
[1:16:42] a disgrace this man said you look it's
[1:16:46] it remains very pure and good
[1:16:50] but it's people who want to make it look
[1:16:53] disgrace
[1:16:56] it's people who want to support it with
[1:16:58] this kind of stains and whatever it's
[1:17:01] people
[1:17:03] it's people's weaknesses
[1:17:07] the message is still good and the pure
[1:17:13] it's the people who are disobedient to
[1:17:15] line up
[1:17:19] you know when God is a true God
[1:17:22] and they send it to prophet
[1:17:24] and are you your disbelieve it then you
[1:17:28] already aside you are not in a straight
[1:17:30] line
[1:17:31] so when you wait for things are not
[1:17:33] going through don't blame the message
[1:17:36] don't blame God don't blame the prophet
[1:17:40] blame yourself because you have stood
[1:17:43] outside you are not in the line
[1:17:50] that's true
[1:17:54] and when you listen to a false of
[1:17:56] prophet then you remove away a real
[1:17:59] Prophet you put there someone else like
[1:18:02] in those times people remove their way
[1:18:05] Moses and they put balam in the middle
[1:18:08] things did not go well
[1:18:15] things did not go well
[1:18:18] in the Bible you find that some people
[1:18:20] used to take away a right prophet
[1:18:24] and put in the middle a wrong person
[1:18:28] and they got wrong results
[1:18:31] they got bad results
[1:18:35] they did not get real words
[1:18:39] but instead they got opposite
[1:18:42] instead of Life Death
[1:18:44] instead of Freedom captivity
[1:18:49] they went into captivities
[1:18:52] in the Babylon and so on
[1:18:55] because of their own mistakes
[1:18:59] we need not to do Mystic sex that
[1:19:03] we need to remain Royal
[1:19:06] understand in the line
[1:19:09] so that God's work can go so good on the
[1:19:12] small
[1:19:16] praise the Lord
[1:19:20] so therefore
[1:19:21] you find that
[1:19:23] then gives us safe
[1:19:25] you are now free you can ask anything
[1:19:29] whatever you're asking my name I will do
[1:19:32] it
[1:19:33] it's because you have been elevated
[1:19:36] to a friendship level
[1:19:39] I don't want to doubt you you are my
[1:19:42] friend I want to tell you that a
[1:19:45] friendship level
[1:19:47] you may have a brother
[1:19:50] but even being only brother is not
[1:19:52] enough
[1:19:55] there must be another level above that
[1:19:58] a friend
[1:20:00] you may have your husband
[1:20:03] and your husband is not enough
[1:20:06] he is your husband that's right
[1:20:09] but you must uplift him to a level of
[1:20:13] him becoming your friend
[1:20:15] because reaching a level of a friend
[1:20:18] that they never wear by there is nothing
[1:20:22] hidden all of mysteries are revealed
[1:20:29] all misties are revealed
[1:20:32] you may have your wife
[1:20:39] your wife and don't end there as that's
[1:20:41] all she's my wife she's my wife
[1:20:46] you have said with her that's good she
[1:20:49] has endure the test with you that's good
[1:20:51] she has passed so many tests that's good
[1:20:55] why can't you elevate her
[1:20:59] bring her to a level of being a friend
[1:21:02] too
[1:21:04] not on my wife which is also a friend
[1:21:06] not only a husband but he is also a
[1:21:09] friend not only a pastor but is also a
[1:21:12] friend not only believer but they are
[1:21:15] also friends you'll see
[1:21:19] we uplift
[1:21:21] that level
[1:21:23] because when Abraham became a friend of
[1:21:25] God
[1:21:28] he's saved
[1:21:30] can I hide anything from Abraham my
[1:21:34] friend
[1:21:35] Hallelujah
[1:21:37] Hallelujah I cannot hide anything from
[1:21:40] Abraham my friend I must tell him all
[1:21:43] the secrets
[1:21:46] I must reveal
[1:21:49] I must provide special Grace for him
[1:21:55] Hallelujah
[1:21:58] so
[1:22:00] that's why we need to impress this word
[1:22:03] as something very important yes
[1:22:07] to whom shall we go again who has life
[1:22:10] once of life we must select Peter
[1:22:13] so other people went and Jesus did not
[1:22:16] explain he did not bother to explain to
[1:22:20] them all you know I didn't mean this
[1:22:22] real fresh but but he left them to go
[1:22:27] sure
[1:22:29] the word he has his own
[1:22:33] so we must be very very determined
[1:22:39] especially in this end time we must be
[1:22:42] very determined because the world is
[1:22:45] changing so swiftly
[1:22:47] things are changing
[1:22:51] things are changing that these things
[1:22:53] are drawing our mind to think about our
[1:22:55] God when are you coming
[1:22:58] because there is no more peace in the
[1:23:00] world
[1:23:02] everywhere there is evil everywhere
[1:23:04] there's evil things are not going well
[1:23:09] people are promoting evil
[1:23:14] you remember in the time of
[1:23:17] uh
[1:23:19] Esther
[1:23:20] when she was promoted to be a queen
[1:23:24] as well also Carmen was promoted to be
[1:23:28] an enemy
[1:23:31] so in our time
[1:23:33] when God has promoted us we are not only
[1:23:36] a church but we are a bride
[1:23:39] then Senior has been also promoted
[1:23:43] and what's the work of the sin
[1:23:46] the Walk of the scene is to fight the
[1:23:49] bride
[1:23:52] what was the work of common
[1:23:54] was to fight tomorrow kind and fight the
[1:23:57] Jews who asked the true God and they
[1:23:59] killed them
[1:24:02] that's what happened
[1:24:05] but how did monologue how did the Esther
[1:24:08] overcome
[1:24:10] they concentrated themselves
[1:24:13] to pray too fast
[1:24:16] to seek God is Grace God is sufficient
[1:24:20] to Grace
[1:24:21] that's true and they overcame
[1:24:25] and when they did that what happened
[1:24:29] the same Signet the same Stomp
[1:24:33] those kings used to have a Signet on
[1:24:36] their hand it used to be something like
[1:24:39] also as well as a stump when something
[1:24:41] is stamped it is already recommended
[1:24:48] so the same King who signed for the
[1:24:51] death of the Jews
[1:24:54] King who signed for their life
[1:25:01] things changed
[1:25:04] that's right
[1:25:05] yeah things can change
[1:25:08] things can change if you pray
[1:25:13] if you trust God and I pray I tell you
[1:25:16] things can change your enemy can change
[1:25:19] and become your friend
[1:25:24] yes
[1:25:26] that's true
[1:25:28] so we have to continue
[1:25:32] we have to go forward
[1:25:34] we have to know that oh now
[1:25:37] we were elevated
[1:25:39] to us to a level of becoming God's
[1:25:44] friends
[1:25:48] so he does not sing that a friend of
[1:25:51] Jesus or what Bliss that one so far as
[1:25:54] Ash
[1:25:55] we sing knowing that oh we are real
[1:25:58] friends of God
[1:26:02] who have student trials so many things
[1:26:05] are going on
[1:26:07] so many things are testing the message
[1:26:11] so many things are testing the message
[1:26:13] believers
[1:26:16] who claim they have believed the message
[1:26:19] of the hour
[1:26:20] they must be tested
[1:26:27] under their message too must be tested
[1:26:34] so when Jesus called Peter he called him
[1:26:37] Matthew he called in Nathaniel he called
[1:26:40] all those disciples they followed him
[1:26:42] they even said Lord we have left all
[1:26:45] things and we have fallen to you and I
[1:26:47] promised them okay Whoever has left his
[1:26:50] people under his home under whatever has
[1:26:53] fooled me no no anyway but we will be
[1:26:57] he will be rewarded in this
[1:27:00] coming and in this world too
[1:27:04] he promised them
[1:27:06] but things are now going by Zach things
[1:27:09] are going astray things are going
[1:27:12] contrary
[1:27:14] so what did they do
[1:27:16] they endured
[1:27:19] those who endures
[1:27:22] were appointed
[1:27:25] to a kingdom
[1:27:28] and they were told in the day we shall
[1:27:31] judge the fellow tribes
[1:27:36] being a judge that means you went so
[1:27:38] many tests so many examinations and you
[1:27:41] passed under so on
[1:27:43] so you cannot become a judge for nothing
[1:27:47] so these people who are in the wars in
[1:27:50] the in the walls of judgment whatever
[1:27:53] courts in the world when they put on
[1:27:55] their goal and their widget or whatever
[1:27:57] and the people say you are worship you
[1:28:00] are whatever oh
[1:28:03] they don't call them for nothing those
[1:28:05] people underwent so many many trials
[1:28:09] they did so many examinations
[1:28:14] in school in research
[1:28:17] in everything
[1:28:20] they did not get their PHD for nothing
[1:28:24] so we may have our spirit too
[1:28:28] and we don't have them for nothing
[1:28:31] we undergo so many trials and so many
[1:28:34] things comes
[1:28:36] but please remember in the Bible
[1:28:39] God builds good things on an obedient
[1:28:43] Foundation
[1:28:50] that's why whoever comes to the Lord
[1:28:52] will never go intact without undergoing
[1:28:54] through tests and so on
[1:28:58] but when they come ask God for his
[1:29:01] sufficient Grace
[1:29:03] Lord help me
[1:29:05] Lord give me wisdom
[1:29:08] Lord give me perfumes
[1:29:10] Lord let me stand
[1:29:14] Lord bring me out of this wilderness
[1:29:18] and then you overcome
[1:29:21] praise the Lord
[1:29:25] that's right
[1:29:27] okay
[1:29:29] our Prophet said something like this
[1:29:32] I'm going to
[1:29:34] he says
[1:29:36] in this message
[1:29:44] in this message Souls that are in prison
[1:29:47] he says like this
[1:29:50] he uses a man
[1:29:53] that is it true
[1:29:55] he does nothing outside of what he does
[1:29:59] by man
[1:30:01] we realize that
[1:30:03] that his
[1:30:05] that that is his agent
[1:30:11] that what he chose
[1:30:14] why I don't know
[1:30:17] he could have made the son to preach the
[1:30:21] gospel
[1:30:22] he could make the wind to preach the
[1:30:25] gospel
[1:30:26] he could make the wind to do things
[1:30:30] but he chose man
[1:30:34] that was his idea
[1:30:37] that human
[1:30:39] that human would speak back to Human
[1:30:46] not himself
[1:30:48] but the word of the Lord came to the
[1:30:51] prophets
[1:30:53] the prophesires and a prophesire
[1:30:58] that denies the original word how can he
[1:31:02] be a true prophet
[1:31:06] the truth of the word and then if it
[1:31:10] doesn't then this uh word itself as is
[1:31:15] preached by the trueness of the word and
[1:31:18] by trueness of the Holy Spirit it will
[1:31:23] manifest everything
[1:31:25] promised that it promised
[1:31:29] praise the Lord
[1:31:32] yeah that's what the prophet is trying
[1:31:34] to explain to us
[1:31:37] that God has so many creation that he
[1:31:39] would have used either a sun s-u-n
[1:31:43] or wind or anything
[1:31:46] but it was not in his idea he just chose
[1:31:50] a man so that he can stand and then a
[1:31:54] man then a man
[1:31:57] put things in line
[1:32:00] he chose that he would speak to a man
[1:32:02] and a man speak to a man
[1:32:06] that's right
[1:32:08] that's how he does
[1:32:13] brother Dell lag stuff has caused there
[1:32:17] some of them maybe are his good ones
[1:32:20] that he really loves
[1:32:22] he would choose one to stand here and
[1:32:24] start preaching but it does not work
[1:32:30] it does not work
[1:32:33] he allows the preacher to stand here and
[1:32:36] speak backer to human beings too
[1:32:40] that's what God has done
[1:32:45] praise the Lord
[1:32:50] that's why
[1:32:53] let us never make a mistake
[1:32:57] and
[1:32:59] we sit there
[1:33:03] and then we put here cassette
[1:33:07] or a tip
[1:33:10] and then after hearing then we go home
[1:33:12] and I will say that is the service no
[1:33:17] him man man
[1:33:27] the one which we can hear here is poke
[1:33:31] that's true
[1:33:35] but he is no longer
[1:33:38] he's fresh he's no longer doing anything
[1:33:43] because Jesus commissioned and said
[1:33:47] these signs shall follow those who
[1:33:50] believe they shall lay their hands which
[1:33:53] has blood and afresh
[1:33:56] real low blood which is still warm and
[1:34:00] lay on the sick and they will be healed
[1:34:06] because Jesus stopped to preach his
[1:34:09] sermon on the side who touched me
[1:34:13] because I saw the vacuum from me doing
[1:34:16] the work
[1:34:20] from me to a woman who had the issue of
[1:34:23] the blood 12 years she got here because
[1:34:27] she touched a human being
[1:34:36] that's right
[1:34:39] so therefore this gospel shall continue
[1:34:41] likewise
[1:34:44] we shall need to come here and listen a
[1:34:47] living man breaking
[1:34:52] lay hands on the sick and they get
[1:34:54] healed
[1:34:57] a living man should take someone and
[1:34:59] take the baptism we pull and baptize
[1:35:04] any man should go and preach the gospel
[1:35:09] praise the Lord
[1:35:15] praise the Lord
[1:35:20] that's why
[1:35:24] Elisha did not come out
[1:35:28] he said
[1:35:30] you listen to a voice
[1:35:32] around you there's younger people
[1:35:36] there are corny people who will touch
[1:35:39] you
[1:35:40] and they put you and take you to do what
[1:35:43] the God wants
[1:35:46] he did not come out of the Grave or
[1:35:49] Elijah did not come out of his house as
[1:35:52] we saw yesterday
[1:35:53] he did not come out
[1:35:58] it's some people who are near
[1:36:01] number
[1:36:03] they are the ones who touched them and
[1:36:05] said sir you come
[1:36:07] let me hold your hand let's go
[1:36:10] and there they went
[1:36:12] so he was moving with those people
[1:36:14] around him
[1:36:17] and the work of God was done
[1:36:23] so in our time
[1:36:25] we just listened to the voice which
[1:36:27] spoke to us
[1:36:29] but the activities must be done by the
[1:36:33] living people
[1:36:37] the living preachers
[1:36:39] who are around
[1:36:41] but I've had some people don't want to
[1:36:44] go to churches they don't want to listen
[1:36:46] to a preacher they only listen to their
[1:36:49] voice and then go back home
[1:36:51] it's not good at all
[1:36:54] we can listen to it but we also still
[1:36:57] have the preachers
[1:37:02] to do the work of God
[1:37:06] praise the Lord
[1:37:08] so
[1:37:09] as I'm ending
[1:37:12] we have been elevated to a level of
[1:37:17] becoming God's friends
[1:37:20] because a prophet yielded himself to
[1:37:24] become a friend of God and we have also
[1:37:27] become friends
[1:37:31] and by that level
[1:37:34] remember
[1:37:36] you have now a possibility
[1:37:40] of asking God for your reward
[1:37:44] anything that you want
[1:37:46] believe
[1:37:49] it's your reward
[1:37:53] it's because you are the conduit is
[1:37:55] smooth it's good it's not it's not
[1:37:58] straight it's not zigzag
[1:38:01] it is straight it's it's good
[1:38:04] so what again
[1:38:09] because
[1:38:10] our Prophet promised us something like
[1:38:13] this
[1:38:15] you see it like this
[1:38:17] I am finishing
[1:38:19] with this quote
[1:38:22] uh-huh
[1:38:24] uh
[1:38:27] have I have have not I sent thee in that
[1:38:30] message
[1:38:31] he says like this
[1:38:34] and I remember always
[1:38:37] or immediately after that prophetism
[1:38:40] message
[1:38:44] God goes to work after the prophet gives
[1:38:47] the word
[1:38:52] then God goes to work on the word
[1:38:57] fast
[1:38:58] it is God to come forth fast
[1:39:03] the word is going to be preached first
[1:39:07] faith comes by hearing hearing of the
[1:39:09] word of God
[1:39:12] their true Prophet starts with the true
[1:39:17] word of God
[1:39:19] and it does not compromise on it anyway
[1:39:22] but it tells the people that you must be
[1:39:26] born again
[1:39:29] the promise is unto you and your
[1:39:33] children to them that is for far off
[1:39:36] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:39:41] call if he is a true prophet
[1:39:49] so
[1:39:50] a prophet brought a message and he went
[1:39:55] and now it's going to work after that
[1:39:58] word had been proclaimed it's now for us
[1:40:02] to see the results
[1:40:04] and God bless you this morning
[1:40:09] [Applause]
