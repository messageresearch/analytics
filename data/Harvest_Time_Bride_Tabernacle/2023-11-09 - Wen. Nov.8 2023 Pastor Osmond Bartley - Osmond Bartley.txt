when I applied and you know they want this whole bunch of things like like like you you never ask for for what you call a diplomatic Visa you know I just want to visit and so they want the whole pile of stuff but anyway I went in and applied and the lady said I don't know when you're going to get you but I I'll just put it in and then she called me two weeks later she said Mr Bley what did you do she said there's a whole bunch of lineing yours came up first I said he can do anything she said I don't know how this happened you know she start calling customers and said there's a man here you

families that are here father Lord and those who could not make it bless them also Father the babies and Lord throughout the weekend Lord that we're here in fellowship and Lord of a precious brothers and sisters that have traveled hours to be in Fellowship Lord it was great oh it all because of you father Lord Jesus I thank you God that you have brought us to understand the true Covenant that you have with us glory to God lord such a covenant Lord that we never knew about Lord but since we come to understand to your revealed word the word of God that you sent Lord to open our understanding so that we can know where we came from we know who we are Lord and we know where we're going father I'm grateful tonight that you have led us God tonight and we're going to open the pages of this book May the Holy Spirit speak to us Lord as you always do because we're hungry and we are thirsty for your word and whenever we come with a hunger and a thirst we know that there is a blessing await us and we shall be fed Ines Jesus name I pray amen and amen praise be to God we read Psalm 121 we're going to read just two verses here man just want to just you know speak to you probably a few minutes I don't know who who Who removed the clock oh I just I'll try to be disciplined with it it's a hour ahead right oh so it should be 7:31 now okay good so good just just wanted something just you know just on my heart want you speak to you from and this is a song of David and it said I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth you may be seated praise be to God Amen this is not too it's not too close it's okay it's okay right amen good just you know and so you know I'm I'm really glad that you know this this trip is a different one I I used to travel travel a lot and when I travel maybe for one month you know go from one place to the next not to in Canada though but different parts of the world and I will travel from one place but uh this is just a special trip for me though I I I I I I didn't just come to preach but I realize I am connecting to the the believer's spirit connecting to your spirit and that's wonderful you know I'm glad that we have a a DNA in common praise be to God and I love your spirit and I love your understanding of the word and you know we will Fellowship oh further definitely we will Fellowship further amen and I feel at home very interesting the first night I felt I felt at Liberty I I I didn't feel one foot and no breaks when I was preaching amen and so I'm glad I was a part of this and you know you know the Book of James chapter 18 he said that he begot us with a word of Truth and uh that truth is our DNA glory to God we have one DNA and that's the word of Truth you know think about we got he tonight and my mind reflect in s Simeon you know when he was led up the Holy Spirit to go to the temple amen that was when he meant the Lord Christ Jesus the baby Jesus so he takes the Holy Spirit to lead him to Jesus and I believe tonight that we're not just here to have church but it takes the Holy Spirit leading us here Amen on this connection we're not just here to look for a picture on the wall we're not just here to look for a man hang on a cross but we're here to Fellowship one with another amen and so you know when you think about there's something I was just thinking in the office there and you know people uh uh have you know have to see something to worship you know like Israel you know one time they said that Israel is a people in the hoing days you know they were people of tangibility they like to to see who are who they woring you know mo God took Moses from their presence and for 40 days and hey they built a cough they built a cough you know this is who brought us out of Egypt you know and so you know people even worship the representation of God you know God sh a man and instead of us worshiping God we may turn worshiping a man you know and so it is good when we can come and I said you know the the the the breathing ground is set for so many false prophets so many false gods and I mean saints of God I tell you during the the coid pandemic man there were so many prophets rose up who were not prophets became prophets everybody was prophesying and who knew what this was and so many different diagnosis of the situation and I said that you know because people crave for it there is a Crave in the hearts of people for these things if you notice you there's so many so many motivational platforms are forming now people don't want God people just want to be motivated you're looking at a world where mankind is is standing in quicksand and not they don't need a rope for rescue they're just let me feel happy even though I'm dying I just want to be happy just motivate me just tell me nice things don't shave me just tell me nice things even though I'm dying and more and more is Rising by the minute because you know people don't as I said they don't want life they just want some nice speeches and uh tell them uh uh motivate their gos get them jumping and happy don't tell them about God he's just sh yesterday today end forever no we just uh people worshiping themselves more today more than all the worshiping God real sints of God there is no crave anymore for God there is no crave anymore even to see the power of God manifest around us no more just come and read back to me and let me sleep and you know some of us can reach a stage of people rather stay in their pajamas and you preach to them from a distance what a world we're living into it won't change it may get worse as we get closer to get out of here oh God is that right Pastor you sho in my younger years in the ministry I used to carry the church on my head for the course if I come to church and I don't see the people I used to cry I would worried and I held the pastor call me he should come here let me teach you something never you carry God's Church on your head car it to the heart it won't change you're going to get worse but then so tonight let me just speak to you from amen the god of the mountains the god of the mountains we love all the Holy Spirit just came from Friday and was just coming nothing great or strange just just reminding us that the same God is here reminding us that there is no big you and small me there is no big one over here with all of the Holy Ghost and you are down here with just a little portion no the Holy Spirit just remind that every one of us have the same God in us he's the same God that spoke to the woman of the well he's the same God that's speaking to us today glory to God amen and so we're going to look at the god of the mountain how beautiful it is that our God can take the worst situations and bring out his glory Our God can take symbols and uh amen and bring them to us and show us the reality of his presence that's how our God hears it is not who you choose but who God chooses Hallelujah glory to God God can look beneath any corruption and she a glorified seed in there beautiful God who is is that right Saints and so this song Amen was actually a song of David but then in Israel you know in Jerusalem every year there would have certain Feast like on the day of Pentecost when the Bible says there were devoted Jews from All Nations because they came back home for this Feast to celebrate this feast and so you know when they would come home amen it was stated in history that this was one of the psalm that they used to chant coming through the Gates of Jerusalem Alem they used to chant it oh we lift up our eyes to the hills because that's where our help come from now they did it now actually they would physically look to the hills because geographically or they stated uh in Israel alone there were like 1,7 Mountains located in all of Israel and Jerusalem boasted seven of those mountains glory to God yes and so you couldn't blame them for looking to the hills because they believe that's where their help came from amen oh Hallelujah glory to God and so you remember in the book of even in psalm chapter 68 and verse 16 the writer said David again sing um singing this song He said why leap Ye Ye high hills this is the hill which God desire it to dwell in him yay the Lord will dwell in it forever this is a song by beer forefathers that's it he said God will dwell in this ill forever so they would use mountain and Hill interchangeably in their songs Hills Mountain Hills and so if their forefathers that God dwell on the Hills all the children grow up going to look to the hills so they would look physically to the hills let's go on further The Book of Solomon in his song Solomon chap 2 verse eight he said the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills Hallelujah glory to God let's go further oh we see amen glory to God even their father Abraham oh it was upon the mount Moria right or a mountain that he would have written and laid out the mirac amen given of a lamb that he used to sacrifice instead of his son when he was on the mountain and the miraculous of the Lamb was presented that was upon the mountain that he saw the Lord Christ the Lamb of God he saw Redemption upon the mountain oh Hallelujah and so much that he called the place Jehovah Gyra it was upon the mountain on the back side of the mountain oh the great prophet Moses when they met the pillar of fire it was a miracle he recorded it when he told this amen amen the children of Israel my God Amen came to me in the pillar of fire the Bush was a burning but the fire was Blazing and I heard God spoke to me where on the mountain many of the writings they would have shown that the god of Israel he spoke from the mountains is that right hallah glory to God oh it was upon the mountain again in the wilderness where Moses was given the two tablets of stones with the laws of Israel written by the fingers of God himself Hallelujah dear God on the mountain again Moses got the vision for the pattern of the Tabernacle to be built when God took him took him upon the mountain and showed him the blueprint from Heaven he would have come down and told them I got the vision from a mountain it was already established in the hearts of the generations coming down that your God speaks from a mountain Hallelujah even the prophet bam when he was paid to curse them he Hallelujah he got big money to curse Israel and he stood there and fixed his things properly and laid out his tools ready to curse God's people oh he could have curse them but words of blessing were coming out of his mouth he turned to the king he said I see their God Amen on top of rocks I see de God behold I sh on the Hills I could not curse what God blessed because dear God was just watching me from the hills amen hallelujah glory to God it was not just in Israel but if I told you in first Kings chapter 20 where it was noise abroad the Nations and the regions around oh my God Hallelujah the Nations around they heard what was taking place he said First Kings chapter glory to God first Kings chapter 20 it was noise abroad everywhere in the region you remember heard about Israel know you can find it first Kings chapter 20 from verse 21 to verse 23 we're going to look at this is interesting the nations in the region heard of the god of Israel well listen this and the king of Israel went out and smoke the horses and the Chariots and slew the Syrian with a great great Slaughter verse 22 and the prophet came to the king of Israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and Mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of C of Syria will come up against thee verse 23 and the Servants of the king of Syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills it wasn't a secret of what was happening in Israel such you know it was it was now known their gods are gods of the hills therefore there were stronger than we amen your father this is interesting but let us amen fight against them where in the plains bring them down in the valley bring them low Hallelujah and fight them and surely we will be stronger than they it was noise that their God is on the Hills they are weak in The Valleys they have no strength down here oh glory to God hallelujah we're going to look at the situation horar in 1 Samuel 17 amen and I'm going to give you a few verses to show you there was a war between the Philistines and Israel you know that under the reign of King Saul and we know that Israel is on Amen never trained to fight combat fight they train as an army Hallelujah but the Philistines and the regions of Greece and Rome amen and all these Persians they were known to fight combat fights one to one fight but Israel was trained as an army Hallelujah and then the Philistines would come and the wor and the SS that there were on one Hill and Israel on another Hill and Goliath would Echo his voice amen send one man because they want to fight combat fight you know what combat is if you understand the gladiator fight because amen that's how they were trained so you fight you send your Champion to me and my champion fight your Champion Israel couldn't fight like that they fight as an army oh Hallelujah glory to God it's so beautiful amen we understand and amen while it David as a youth was over there in the W in the desert taking care of sheep and a lion came upon him and through the power of God he slew that lion and another beer another time a beer came upon his flock and through the power of God uh amen he slew the beer in my mind I was shamed all that God was just training David Amen in combat War he was he never had an army he never had company he had God he never take a credit upon himself he knew it must be God so when oh Hallelujah no doubt when he came he me the saw and brought food for his brothers and he heard the Uproar and he said let me go fight him let me go fight this uncircumcised Philistines in the eyes of David look through the eyes of God the size of this man matters not because he was uncircumcised Hallelujah glory to God he meant nothing uh amen men to David it's not about size it's not about might nor by power it's by the spirit of God hallelujah I said to you the other day many trials and intestines and mountains and goliaths that comes in your pathway they can never defeat you but God is training you you're under training I said you are under training you can never be defeated wo Hallelujah glory to God Amen you thought about when they brought David to Saul no doubt you would have looked him from head to toe glory to God you know people like to do that looking from head to toe and trying to ask him did you really said what you said he said I mean it I'm going to fight him are you sure yes I'm going to fight him while Those Behind Goliath were jumping and shouting because they knew the size of their Champion Hallelujah yeah you heard me Saints they knew the size of their Champion oh and oh I know sha wasn't really convinced but he had no choice because the word of God says when goli had opened his mouth amen the army of Israel start trembling my God and he put his armor and his old old fit upon David and David have never worn this before and David maybe start walking and you know he had to bring them back and said take them off I have never proven these before I cannot go under your anointing Hallelujah Glory we can never fight in somebody else anointing I've got to go in my own anointing I have go with with my own testimonies the Lord he gave his testimony the word of God says uh you overcome the devil by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony not mine but yours woo Hallelujah glory to God your testimonies let me say this we ought to be careful God the miracle of God is real glory to God I may pray for rain in Jamaica because where we live we have no running water so we need water I pray for rain and I got it praise be to God that's my testimony is that right and I am over there jumping praise God what a great miracle you may over here and you need a dollar and you praying God give it to you that's still a miracle woo not because it never come in the big package like mine it's still God sir Oh Glory can I preach tonight he's still God hallelujah amen how amen I may playay I may pray amen for a plane ride and you just pray for a bike ride and we both get it it's the same God so you cannot go to God and says look what you did for brother Bley you shall reign and you give me a dollar that's what God know you need woo glory to God he's still God he still work miracles but sometimes uh amen we fail to see the mighty works of God through Small Favors yeah we fa the seat Oh Glory to God woo hallelujah amen so Saul said no doubt brother seron King sha he won many wars on those many wars and victories came through these armories so put it on David these are the best Oh Glory to God it's a king's Armory these are the best you never wore anything like that before Oh God hallelujah he didn't even borrow one from another Soldier he never even asked for a new one put on mine Hallelujah take on my oh God after David gave him his testimony David shall I have thank God that he has taught my hands to fight and and My Hands to War and my fingers to fight God delivered me about a from a beer he delivered me from a lion it's my God hallelujah amen he never hold a sword from he was born he could hardly lift the shield oh Hallelujah take them off and I'm going to go in the name of the Lord look at what look at verse 8 First Kings 7 1st Samuel 17 and verse 8 here the this loudmouth Philistine shouting and you think he was rough he's just a bluffer oh God woo and he stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them why you come out why are you come out to set your battle in a r I'm not a a philistin and you servants to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come where where bring him down let's fighten the body because it's everybody in you the god of Israel Israel God is stronger on the mountain that's what they think you remember I just read it a servant tell the the the Syrian King if we catch them in the Valley we'll win them because their God is on the mountains Philistines heard it too the whole region heard it so send a man down in the valley send a man down in the valley so in their mind oh Hallelujah we are reading between the lines we're reading between the lines sent him down the valley he never said let him come up here on the hill or I am coming up to him he was so big and strong he could have gone out to hell but he said bring him down the valy woo Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah but in my mind and my spirit I can hear David walking down to him when they David going you know the army of Israel never had confidence in David so no doubt they up there trembling and biting their nails wondering what will they tell Daddy what we going to tell our daddy and David going down though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for God is is with me he's my rod and my stuff he is comforting me David love the S Hallelujah woo glory to God and David going to that amen David was the singing song the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear he was singing that in his heart he was rejoicing going towards the Philistine what is it Hallelujah David took the god from the mountains amen David had the god of the mountains on his inside oh Hallelujah the word says David Man David looked at him and the word of God says he come to David near and David hasted towards him David ran towards him that's confidence that's confidence woo Glory Hallelujah that's total confidence you come to me with Spears and sword and shield but I come to you in the name of the Lord oh Hallelujah there's a people on this Earth Oh Glory to God that as we know he was God above us he became God Among Us now he's God in us hallelujah is a god of the mountains what a paradox what a paradox a god of the mountain is living in me he is he is is we're more than conquerors that's what the word says we're not just conquerors we are more than is that right we're a people with confidence Oh Glory to God is that right change we're people you know what and I said the other day that God know what he put in us he has confidence what he put in us that we can never be defeated what kind of God it is that would save you day long stuff and knows that he's going to lose you tomorrow if he's an infinite God hallelujah what kind of God is it that knows oh Hallelujah you see I like to challenge people in the word of God you know he's a God that watch amen the god that would watch you born amen so many sicknesses may have lur around you little baby dale is that right oh so many may be near misses from death oh and somebody says you were lucky growing a child of God does not survived by luck protected preserved Hall preserved amen there are angels that encamp around amen the elect of God Amen there's a fence amen that is being built around the elect of God uh no weapon that is form against you can prosper Hallelujah woo God I'm confident that truth hallelujah hallelujah you remember that Vision Nebuchadnezzar saw of the great of the four the four kingdoms Gentile kingdoms and their their rise and fall in the vision that he had and he they remember the vision and he took the Prophet Daniel to come and tell him the vision and give him the interpretation of his thereof in the vision he saw the four kingdoms but the outstanding part of it is that at the foot of the of those of that Beast you know what I'm talking of that image he saw a stone that was cut out of the mountains not with hand but God T it and that amen the word says that stone was a kingdom that that was being set up Hallelujah by God himself a stone cut out of the mountain and Israel believe that their God is a god of the mountains Hallelujah even when Jesus came on the sea Israel was looking for that Kingdom even the disciples were looking for that Kingdom Hallelujah even after the resurrection when they asked him Acts chapter one will you at this time restore the kingdom again to Israel because they were looking for the establishment of the Earthly Kingdom Hallelujah not realizing he was indeed setting up a kingdom Oh Glory to God they never realize that the Christ amen Jesus Christ himself when he said the amen the kingdom is in your and you failed to see it I am here oh Hallelujah you cannot see this Kingdom amen unless you are born again born of the water and of the spirit you need to be born again to understand this Kingdom it does not come by observation it's a revelation that will know hallelujah it's a revelation that will tell you who are the part of the body or who are part of this Kingdom amen that Kingdom that Daniel saw amen interpreting the vision that Kingdom that was cut out of the mountain it's a stone it's the last Kingdom oh Hallelujah that will be coming it's here oh hallelujah it's here Jesus Christ was that Kingdom that came un hurt when he said the kingdom of God is here the kingdom of God is here Hallelujah we are that stone we are that stone we are that Kingdom that Christ Our Father God has cut out for us saints of God we are a part of him oh no doubt when John saw him in the high of vision in the high of patas in that Vision he could not recognize him John walked with Jesus for three years and about four months and he heard that voice he turned to see the voice and the appearance oh Hallelujah he could only recognize him because I was him and he was me we're not looking for a Christ amen to come down again with wings stretched from east to west he came manifest himself in sh and wonders the last sign that a gentile generation was supposed to see amen you saw it you believed it and now we are convinced that we are him we are him doubted brother brother Paul they doubted brother Paul when he said he saw Christ read it they doubted him you coming in here 19 years after the resurrection and you tell you that you see him Paul said I saw him I saw the fire I saw Pillar of Fire and he said I am Jesus that is why the things I do is not I but the Christ that lives in me Hallelujah glory to God it's a Christ that lives in Me Oh Glory to God Amen Glory Hallelujah Saints don't you realize amen you know when the word of God says when you see these things happening in the end time he said look up lift
