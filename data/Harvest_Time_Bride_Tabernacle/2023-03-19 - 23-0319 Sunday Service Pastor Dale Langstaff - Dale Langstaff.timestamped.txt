[29:42] you know uh
[29:44] as a message believer the bride of
[29:47] Christ you know we have so many things
[29:50] that we could Minister on and of course
[29:52] we believe in uh being part of God and
[29:55] predestination and and these are all
[29:58] wonderful truths amen and and uh but
[30:02] sometimes we will step back as it is to
[30:05] say and uh maybe step back and slow down
[30:09] and look into the little details we said
[30:13] the little details there's really no
[30:15] details that are little but we'll look
[30:16] into we'll say In the Flesh the little
[30:19] details that God has and I want to throw
[30:21] this out there before we get into this
[30:23] you know we all know and I know too that
[30:26] the Holy Spirit and our sweet Lord Jesus
[30:29] is our head
[30:31] amen
[30:32] he's my head too
[30:34] and he's every Minister's head that's
[30:36] called of God and if he ain't their head
[30:38] you want to run for your life
[30:40] amen that's for sure
[30:43] but in that same text God gave us
[30:47] heads here on Earth
[30:49] amen
[30:50] amen I'm going to show you some things
[30:52] that the prophet said because you know I
[30:55] could Minister a store a message amen I
[30:58] was uh
[31:01] you know as is a balanced bride of
[31:04] Christ we shouldn't just get excited
[31:06] when when our our our sins aren't being
[31:09] exposed and our doctrines are being
[31:11] blessed
[31:13] amen we should get excited all the time
[31:16] amen see what I'm saying and so yes the
[31:19] Lord if if I'm if you don't believe I'm
[31:21] under the headship of Christ run for
[31:23] your life
[31:24] run for your life you'll help save me
[31:26] and yourself
[31:28] but God still had headship here
[31:32] that came under that headship now you
[31:35] must know those that labor among you and
[31:37] first off even the husbands the head of
[31:39] the homes amen and then even the
[31:42] fivefold ministry and then your local
[31:45] Pastor amen and I'm not trying to raise
[31:48] that Ministry up if you know me I'm not
[31:51] trying to do that
[31:53] but if you don't believe in the
[31:54] fightfood ministry you'll never be there
[31:58] you will not be there you I hope you and
[32:01] well I don't hope you enjoy but
[32:03] you will be in the regions of the Lost
[32:07] because the prophet said that the same
[32:09] holy spirit that leads you was the same
[32:10] Holy Spirit to put the five-fold
[32:12] ministry in the church
[32:14] amen and so I'm gonna
[32:17] what we're going to minister on the next
[32:19] many weeks and like probably three at
[32:22] least
[32:23] is little details
[32:26] and I want to title the message
[32:30] the kitchen table of God
[32:33] you know in the olden days in Canada at
[32:37] least
[32:38] families gathered around the kitchen
[32:40] table
[32:41] and most of the business and most of the
[32:44] planning
[32:45] was all done around the kitchen table if
[32:49] you were if you were doing anything and
[32:52] that family
[32:54] Realm
[32:56] in that household it was decided
[32:59] at the kitchen table
[33:01] amen
[33:03] and so we want to look into God's
[33:06] kitchen tables let's turn to Second
[33:07] Timothy three and if you'll stand with
[33:09] me one more time just in honor of
[33:11] Jehovah God and and his word second
[33:13] Timothy 3 and 16.
[33:16] and Amy I'm going to sing that song at
[33:18] the end of the script of service I'm
[33:20] sorry Amy wasn't pulling up our
[33:22] scripture fast last time because she had
[33:24] a song there for me to sing
[33:26] we're going to sing the little ones at
[33:28] the end of the service you remind me
[33:30] give me an old flag wave or something
[33:32] but all scripture is given for
[33:35] inspiration of God
[33:38] that means the ones we barely seldom
[33:40] ever read
[33:42] that's the ones that don't talk about
[33:43] predestination and you're a part of God
[33:45] and the Evangelistic services and all
[33:48] that they're all amen
[33:51] amen sister
[33:53] Katy is just coming in all scripture is
[33:56] given by inspiration of God and is
[33:59] profitable for Doctrine God bless you
[34:02] Sister Cassie welcome
[34:04] it's profitable for Doctrine
[34:06] that means it's good for all of us
[34:09] for reproof that means it's good for all
[34:11] of us
[34:12] and for oh I don't want that part
[34:16] and for correction
[34:18] ouch I just say it ahead of time
[34:21] ouch
[34:22] and everybody needs correction including
[34:25] the fivefold ministry including
[34:27] brotherdale
[34:28] and including your favorite faithful
[34:30] minister
[34:32] for instruction and righteousness Paul
[34:34] wait a minute now I thought the Holy
[34:36] Ghost did that
[34:39] right
[34:42] the Holy Ghost is our keeper
[34:44] I thought the Holy Ghost kept us in
[34:46] righteousness
[34:48] but here in Paul's in Timothy Paul's
[34:51] telling us
[34:52] that the scriptures is for instruction
[34:54] and righteousness and 17
[35:00] that the man of God may be
[35:03] am I reading that wrong I got my iPad
[35:05] verse 17 oh yeah no that's right I'm
[35:07] sorry I thought I was ahead of myself
[35:09] and that the man of God may be perfect
[35:13] and thoroughly finished
[35:15] unto all good works Lord Jesus we ask
[35:18] you just add the blessing to your word
[35:20] and your anointing on the people and the
[35:22] bride of Christ here in your beautiful
[35:24] name we pray amen
[35:27] amen you may have your seats amen so we
[35:29] see here that Paul is given us
[35:34] for Doctrine and you know in the Bible
[35:38] different uh uh things that we would do
[35:42] amen uh what the Bible says uh
[35:47] here let me just find it amen we're
[35:49] given many Oracles in the Bible that we
[35:51] would do man water baptism was one foot
[35:54] watching and communion and we believe
[35:57] them
[35:58] and we're to do them until Jesus comes
[36:01] amen their instructions to fulfill but I
[36:04] want to tell you this morning that if
[36:06] you get baptized and you don't have the
[36:08] right heart and you're not saved and
[36:09] you're not converted you'll just come
[36:11] down a wet Center go down a dry Center
[36:13] and come up a wet Center
[36:15] it will do nothing for you and if you're
[36:17] in a boxer than State and you come up
[36:20] and take communion to Fort Washington
[36:21] even after foot washing you give the
[36:23] pastor a big old-fashioned hug amen and
[36:26] you're a sinner you'll still go to hell
[36:30] amen so those outside things don't save
[36:33] us but God still said do them
[36:37] amen and so we believe them
[36:40] and we continue in this way and I want
[36:43] to just lay we're laying a foundation
[36:45] and we're going to go slow this is not
[36:47] going to be an Evangelistic service like
[36:49] when we were in Uganda
[36:51] but I want to look at some things
[36:52] because because we're seeing in the
[36:56] world
[36:57] the the edges of the Believers falling
[37:01] apart it's like an old cloth and it's
[37:04] getting frayed at the edges you know new
[37:06] Cod is just clean cut sharp and uh it's
[37:10] just getting clean cut amen uh just uh
[37:15] and but we're seeing that the churches
[37:17] and not are getting frayed none of the
[37:19] children are bothering me in the least
[37:20] by the way amen First Corinthians 11 1
[37:25] B here's Paul talking again First
[37:28] Corinthians 11 1. he said be followers
[37:31] of me even as I also am of Christ
[37:37] amen so if you have a Godly Pastor or
[37:42] Godly fivefold minister in your life
[37:45] amen they are to be an example and
[37:48] should surely be an example unto the
[37:50] bride and the people in the church
[37:52] amen that as I follow Christ you should
[37:55] follow me and if I stop following Christ
[37:58] you keep following Christ and find
[38:01] another Godly person to follow that
[38:03] could be your dad your father your
[38:05] grandfather
[38:07] or part of the fivefold ministry
[38:09] amen and verse two and now I promise you
[38:12] Brethren that ye remember me and all
[38:15] things and keep the
[38:19] articles
[38:20] aha
[38:22] as I have delivered them unto you see
[38:25] God expects us to do some things the new
[38:29] trend in the world today is this well
[38:32] God knows my heart
[38:34] I just got Stoned Out of My Mind on
[38:36] Friday night and I come to church and
[38:37] sing in the choir and said well God knew
[38:39] my heart I didn't mean to
[38:41] amen yeah God knows your heart and
[38:43] that's why he'll send you to hell
[38:45] because he knows your heart amen see God
[38:48] will be you will be his first love
[38:51] amen commitment amen and you could have
[38:53] named anything in this amen we know the
[38:56] sins of of of many amen and so we see
[39:01] this amen we can look into this farther
[39:03] amen well maybe we'll read this just
[39:05] because I don't want to rush but we know
[39:08] that but I would have you know that the
[39:10] head of every man is Christ and the head
[39:13] of every woman is the man and the head
[39:15] of Christ is God
[39:18] amen
[39:19] and we know that Christ is God Christ
[39:22] means the anointed one amen God is the
[39:25] spirit and those that worship Him must
[39:27] worship Him in spirit
[39:28] and in truth and every man praying or
[39:31] prophesying having they said uncovered
[39:33] dishonor us his head but every woman
[39:35] praying or prophesying with their head
[39:38] uncovered dishonours her head and even
[39:40] all one as she should be shaven that's
[39:45] where the scriptures that's one of many
[39:47] of the scriptures where it says that the
[39:49] long hair of a sister is the glory to
[39:52] God
[39:53] amen it's not the glory to brother Dale
[39:56] it's not the glory to the church it's
[39:58] like it's a glory to God Amen do I
[40:01] understand that no I don't understand
[40:02] that at all I just know that if you want
[40:05] to go where the the chief boss is saying
[40:08] to go you obey the rules or you're not
[40:11] going to arrive there amen amen uh so
[40:15] here the scriptures saying that if a
[40:17] woman was to cut her hair God's telling
[40:19] you to it would be better that it was
[40:21] shaven bald amen
[40:25] and the scripture and there's many other
[40:27] scriptures where it talks about the
[40:28] glory and honor it says even if the
[40:30] scripture even says this it said doesn't
[40:32] even nature teach us that it's a shame
[40:34] for a man to be a hippie and have long
[40:36] hair
[40:36] but it's a blessing and an honor for a
[40:39] woman it's just to have long hair and
[40:41] it's a shame for her to have a long
[40:43] short hair in most cases a woman that
[40:45] cuts her hair off looks very tough and
[40:48] Butchy and hard very very hard amen
[40:53] nature will teach you that
[40:55] amen for if a woman
[40:58] would not be covered then also or shaven
[41:01] then it is a shame for a woman
[41:08] let me start again for if a woman is not
[41:11] covered let her also be shorn
[41:15] but if
[41:16] it be a shame for the woman to be shorn
[41:19] or shaven let her be covered
[41:23] amen that means have hair for a man
[41:26] indeed ought to not cover his head in so
[41:29] much as his image and the glory of God
[41:32] but a woman is the glory of the man and
[41:34] for let the man
[41:36] is not of the woman but the woman of the
[41:39] man neither is the Man created for the
[41:41] woman
[41:41] but the woman created for the man I want
[41:45] to just jump ahead here and here in this
[41:48] this quote where we're we're going to
[41:50] look at in the prophet he was talking
[41:53] about because many in the churches
[41:55] especially in the message ranks are are
[41:58] uh are deceived amen and believe that
[42:02] the Holy Ghost is going to lead them
[42:04] through to a rapture
[42:08] and I want to show you
[42:10] here
[42:12] what the prophet says to that here in a
[42:14] second
[42:15] amen
[42:16] and brother Brown mentions this six
[42:18] times about Corinthians 1 11. and Jesus
[42:21] said he that receiveth them receiveth me
[42:26] he that receiveth
[42:28] them that I sent receiveth me sorry so
[42:31] here here God sent out the fivefold
[42:34] minutes right I'm talking about the true
[42:35] fight for Ministry you have the right to
[42:38] judge it
[42:39] you have the right to judge it but you
[42:41] don't have the right to get rid of it
[42:43] all
[42:45] amen
[42:46] amen so here Jesus says he said he that
[42:49] receiveth them that I sent receiveth me
[42:52] and now know them that he sent and them
[42:57] that receiveth me receiveth him that
[43:00] sent me
[43:01] he's talking about Jesus and God Amen
[43:03] which which we made time to linger on
[43:07] that but you are only you can only serve
[43:11] God as you serve
[43:14] you can only serve God and he repeats
[43:17] that you can only serve as you do and
[43:21] obey the Servants of God
[43:25] ouch
[43:26] now there's 50 percent of message
[43:28] Believers I'm looking for my glasses
[43:30] here fifty percent of message believers
[43:33] would struggle with that now he's not
[43:36] talking about obeying Servants of God
[43:38] that are off the word
[43:40] no no you have full authority to know
[43:44] the difference
[43:46] that's called the Holy Spirit
[43:48] amen
[43:49] but if the holy spirit is rightfully
[43:51] dividing the word of God and you say
[43:53] well I don't need that servant and man
[43:56] you're deceived amen and the prophet
[43:57] says that here farther down amen my my
[44:00] uh sorry
[44:03] amen and you can only serve God on Earth
[44:06] see as God's servants that was sent on
[44:09] Earth by divine inspiration
[44:13] and inspires the word to you
[44:16] amen and the prophet goes in here and he
[44:19] mentions
[44:20] multiple scriptures which I love amen
[44:23] when you when you compare what the
[44:24] prophet's saying he just takes it right
[44:26] back to the word of God so let's go to
[44:27] First Corinthians 14 and 16.
[44:30] and here he says else when thou shalt
[44:33] bless be shall bless with the spirit how
[44:37] shall he that occureth help me out honey
[44:42] occupyeth the room
[44:44] of the unlearned Say Amen
[44:47] at thy giving thanks seeing that he
[44:51] understandeth not
[44:53] what thy saith
[44:55] now here's God saying that you need the
[44:58] fivefold ministry to understand what the
[45:01] spirit of the holy spirit is saying to
[45:03] you
[45:06] amen
[45:07] now the same Bible that you read says
[45:09] that it's for the perfecting of the
[45:11] Saints
[45:12] so without them
[45:15] you're not going to be perfected
[45:17] so the people that are sitting home on
[45:19] the couch reading their Bible themselves
[45:20] are reading the same Bible
[45:23] but could be lost
[45:26] wow
[45:29] here's in Luke 16 and this was even more
[45:32] simple or plain and man Luke 10 16 and
[45:35] here the prophet mentioned these right
[45:37] after that last quote he said he that
[45:39] heareth me you here's me
[45:43] and he that despises you
[45:46] also despises me
[45:52] wow
[45:53] amen
[45:57] God help us amen
[46:00] now this is in no way
[46:03] trying to say
[46:06] that the ministry or the fivefold is
[46:08] above the Holy Spirit never not even
[46:11] flied out a hundred percent absolutely
[46:13] not
[46:15] amen
[46:17] but we have a spirit in laodicea that
[46:21] lacks headship
[46:23] amen it's not just in the church that's
[46:25] why young people are fighting the police
[46:27] and they will
[46:29] you know swear cuss out the police or go
[46:32] to court or you know they see they have
[46:34] no space backdoor Authority for any
[46:37] headship
[46:38] that's why they have no respect they'll
[46:40] run away from home disobedient to
[46:42] parents the Bible says that and the end
[46:43] times see it's not just let me
[46:47] it's a spirit
[46:49] and you're affected by that spirit
[46:53] I didn't say you were Anointed with it I
[46:55] said you're affected because on a windy
[46:57] day it blows by you and you go Shake It
[47:01] Off
[47:02] amen
[47:03] I'm affected by you too
[47:06] sometimes somebody cries
[47:09] it was a windy day and that Spirit blew
[47:11] by
[47:13] amen
[47:16] God help us that's not of God
[47:18] amen
[47:21] amen and I'm not trying to here's the
[47:24] prophet saying in church order and
[47:25] Doctrine 63 he said I'm not trying to
[47:26] observe the Authority or something like
[47:28] that but you see a man or anything that
[47:31] has two heads
[47:32] he said it doesn't know how to go God
[47:34] never had two heads in the church he
[47:37] always had one and he always
[47:40] dwelt in every generation God's in this
[47:44] generation so who's the head well yes
[47:46] the holy spirit's ahead but other than
[47:48] that then it steps down to the fightful
[47:50] ministry then it steps out to the head
[47:52] of the homes then it steps down to the
[47:54] wives and not over the children and then
[47:55] the children would be
[47:57] below that amen
[48:00] amen God help us amen
[48:03] I'm looking for my
[48:05] here we go here's the one I was talking
[48:07] about
[48:09] amen I hope you allow me to slow down
[48:12] and just read these because they're
[48:14] they're worth reading hear the if the
[48:17] holy spirit is singing Let the singing
[48:19] go on and if then if we're standing here
[48:21] and start preaching and he raises up
[48:23] then and starts singing at the same time
[48:26] he's preaching then that person is out
[48:28] of order the holy spirit is not the
[48:31] author of confusion amen and he said
[48:35] that's right and he said the church he
[48:36] said you're lovely people here but
[48:38] you're all in air he said if you don't
[48:40] got if you're not God a gift he said use
[48:43] the gift where the gift belongs
[48:46] there's a place that fits in
[48:48] amen
[48:51] and if I've got a brick or a shovel
[48:54] certainly I won't try to hoe my potatoes
[48:57] with it
[48:59] he said no see he said you pick up the
[49:01] shovel and when I'm picking or digging a
[49:04] ditch
[49:05] amen but not picking by Tomatoes he's
[49:08] just saying you use the right tool for
[49:10] the thing he says I want it dry to drive
[49:12] my automobile through a cornfield well
[49:14] some people when they're drunk they
[49:15] actually do they uh I think that's cool
[49:18] but uh but he's saying see you got to
[49:20] have the right tool
[49:22] you're not going to harvest the corn
[49:23] with your automobile
[49:25] amen
[49:26] and he said
[49:28] so I ain't nothing else against plowing
[49:31] but I haven't got nothing against the
[49:33] automobile
[49:34] he said they're both instruments but you
[49:36] got to use them in the right place
[49:39] amen and he said so let's just drop down
[49:42] and he he said so oh please church have
[49:45] faith just a little while here and see
[49:46] he said we must come under
[49:49] teaching now that's the exact word he
[49:52] uses
[49:53] he says you say I don't need no one to
[49:56] teach me after the Holy Ghost has come
[50:01] that sounds reasonable
[50:02] well the Holy Ghost is the ultimate
[50:04] teacher
[50:05] amen
[50:07] even even this watch this church even
[50:09] when a minister is going forth teaching
[50:11] including me
[50:13] you can't even help it you have the
[50:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's being
[50:18] filtered and that's all right and that's
[50:21] pure and that's good
[50:24] but at least allow it to go through the
[50:26] filter
[50:27] some have just closed the door and said
[50:30] my way or the highway
[50:33] amen watch what he says with this
[50:36] he says
[50:38] you say well I don't need no one to
[50:40] teach me after the Holy Ghost comes he
[50:41] says friends
[50:43] that gives me just a little room
[50:47] to doubt whether you even got the Holy
[50:50] Spirit or not
[50:56] wow
[50:59] how many would that apply to
[51:03] too many
[51:07] do you know if the people in this area
[51:09] that were sitting home listening to the
[51:10] tapes all came to church this church
[51:11] would be
[51:12] a lot Fuller
[51:15] don't matter to me if they come
[51:17] it's their eternal life you can't leave
[51:19] you can't make a horse drink water
[51:22] I can show them the water it's right
[51:24] here horsey
[51:25] Splash it in the pail
[51:28] amen
[51:30] amen
[51:32] he said just give me a little doubt to
[51:34] doubt whether you even really got it or
[51:36] not see he says CeCe he said the way
[51:39] you're acting with it see see the thing
[51:41] is you're doing he said now why if there
[51:44] was any
[51:46] no he said the the Bible says the holy
[51:49] spirit is the teacher
[51:52] that's beautiful they say praise God
[51:54] let's stop reading right there
[51:56] he said why then did the same Holy
[51:59] Spirit put teachers in the church
[52:02] well why did you have to finish the
[52:04] sentence
[52:06] bless God
[52:10] you see what I mean
[52:11] you can make the Bible say anything
[52:15] that's why we have ten thousand
[52:17] different churches
[52:19] you can make the message say anything
[52:22] you want all you gotta do is just stop
[52:23] reading right there
[52:25] not show the other part
[52:27] everybody's happy
[52:30] but if you want to take it all
[52:32] and go
[52:35] that'll be all that's fitly formed
[52:38] together beautifully and you'll be
[52:40] dressed beautiful
[52:42] man like Revelation says that the wife
[52:45] has made herself ready she's dressed
[52:46] with the word of God no amen and these
[52:50] are things that we don't normally slow
[52:51] down
[52:52] enough because we're we're preaching why
[52:55] did that same Holy Spirit put teachers
[52:58] in the church then to set the church in
[53:00] order it was the same
[53:04] Holy Spirit
[53:06] wow
[53:09] here they you know the the prophet when
[53:13] he went beyond the curtain of time amen
[53:15] and and all these things and we know
[53:17] about this and uh the the people were
[53:20] telling him that he would be judged for
[53:23] what he believed and what he preached
[53:24] and he said I looked and told them he
[53:27] said I remember in my vision I seen the
[53:29] presence of the Lord and his people were
[53:30] glorious land Yonder and I was looking
[53:32] around and I told them he said and they
[53:35] told me he said he will judge you first
[53:37] by the gospel that I preached and I said
[53:40] whoa just exactly I preached it just
[53:43] exactly
[53:45] the way Paul preached it and millions of
[53:48] them screamed out he said we're resting
[53:50] on that and another quote he says will
[53:52] Paul be judged also
[53:55] and sometimes operating has called has
[53:58] to be called and he said you call down
[54:01] or something on on that order and that
[54:04] person that's got a gift rejects it he's
[54:07] talking about calling somebody out
[54:09] that's out of order amen he said you
[54:11] called down or something on that order
[54:14] and the person that's got the gifts
[54:16] rejects it just remember
[54:21] refuse it remember the gift wasn't right
[54:26] it wasn't God in the first place
[54:30] you see
[54:31] because God don't reject God
[54:35] and if both had the Holy Spirit and the
[54:37] gifts are in order see somebody that's
[54:39] where he preached Church order and
[54:41] Doctrine where somebody won prophesy
[54:42] when The Minister's already prophesying
[54:45] amen because it's confusion they both
[54:47] can do it
[54:48] but at separate times when one finishes
[54:51] the next one comes up because God's not
[54:53] the author of confusion he said that
[54:55] gift just by see how you can judge the
[54:57] fruits is not this is not of God in the
[55:01] first place the spirit of God is always
[55:03] ready
[55:05] oh
[55:08] you wonder if some of these people that
[55:10] are on the edge of the material cloth
[55:13] material that's kind of frizzy
[55:16] this will answer that perfectly
[55:20] he said the spirit of God is always
[55:23] spirit of God is always
[55:25] is always
[55:27] ready for correction
[55:36] so if they're not ready for correction
[55:41] they're not even converted
[55:44] sweet and humble and willing see if you
[55:46] stand up and say why I'll do it anyhow
[55:49] you know how something then just
[55:51] remember an arrogant spirit's not of God
[55:53] and see why it takes this to uh
[55:58] to fulfill and man it was the subduity
[56:01] and everything the whole earth was
[56:03] filled with the glory of God Amen
[56:05] brother Brown said that multiple times
[56:07] in the quote say man when he preached
[56:11] that we're resting on that he actually
[56:14] said it five times here's another one
[56:15] where he says he says well he comes
[56:18] someday he's asking where Jesus is he
[56:20] said why can't I see Jesus when he went
[56:21] behind the curtain of time he said well
[56:24] now will he come someday
[56:26] and he said he'll come to you first but
[56:29] what but first you'll be judged
[56:32] and he said these people are all your
[56:34] converts that you've LED and he said you
[56:37] mean that I am the leader and that God
[56:40] will judge me for what I told the people
[56:42] and he said yes
[56:44] and he said does every leader have to be
[56:47] judged
[56:48] and they said yes and I said well what
[56:51] about Paul does Paul have to be judged
[56:55] and he said yes
[56:57] and he said he'll have to be judged for
[57:00] what he preached and he said well I said
[57:04] if his gift gift group goes through
[57:08] then so will mine because I preached
[57:10] exactly the same word
[57:13] as Paul preached and the millions
[57:16] screamed out
[57:17] we're rested on that let's turn to
[57:18] Deuteronomy 6 and we'll just lay more of
[57:21] a foundation amen and where we're trying
[57:23] to show you is that God has a plan on
[57:27] Earth
[57:29] let's say this right
[57:32] besides or in addition to
[57:35] to the Holy Spirit
[57:38] probably in addition to the holy spirit
[57:40] is more correct yes the holy spirit is
[57:43] the ultimate teacher of all of us
[57:45] and God's the boss
[57:47] but God has other plans on Earth in
[57:52] addition to
[57:53] the Holy Spirit
[57:55] and most the spirit of laodice sin where
[57:59] we're rebellious to parents and we're
[58:02] rebellious to the police and rebellious
[58:04] to the government amen rebellious to
[58:06] everybody
[58:08] and then we're of course we're
[58:09] rebellious to God's leaders
[58:12] it's a spirit
[58:14] amen Deuteronomy 6 and 6.
[58:19] and thou shalt love the Lord with all
[58:20] thy Lord thy God with all thine heart
[58:23] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[58:25] might and these words which I command
[58:28] thee this day shalt thou put in thy
[58:31] heart
[58:33] now see we don't need this next verse if
[58:35] the holy spirit is the teacher
[58:38] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[58:40] unto thy children
[58:42] and so talk with them when thou sin is
[58:45] in thy house and when thou walketh by
[58:47] the way and when thou layest down and
[58:50] when thou raised us up now that pretty
[58:51] woe covers your whole entire life
[58:56] God expects you to raise up your
[58:59] children in the way they should go that
[59:01] when they're old they will not depart
[59:02] from them and when you need to you this
[59:05] is how it is when you've done all you
[59:07] can do then you can rest on God's holy
[59:09] spirit that he's in control
[59:11] amen hallelujah
[59:15] and thou shalt bind them on a sign upon
[59:19] thy hand and thou shalt be as a frontal
[59:23] letters between thine eyes
[59:26] and thou shall write them upon the post
[59:28] of thy house and on thy Gates now he's
[59:30] saying that when you want to talk about
[59:31] God you should have a sign on your hand
[59:33] one between you on your forehead and on
[59:35] the post of your house
[59:44] I think he's saying that we should talk
[59:46] about him all the time
[59:48] out of the abundance of the heart the
[59:51] most speakest
[59:52] if all you're thinking about is your big
[59:54] bank account
[59:56] or how you're gonna
[59:59] or how long you're
[1:00:03] we spend so much to Any Time smelling
[1:00:05] good and looking good
[1:00:07] when we're all going to go through the
[1:00:08] grave whether we go in the Rapture or
[1:00:10] not we're going to fall away
[1:00:13] amen
[1:00:15] no I I I'm not saying don't take care of
[1:00:17] yourself because of course we believe
[1:00:18] that amen
[1:00:21] and then if we drop down to verse 12
[1:00:24] then it says beware lest I'll forget the
[1:00:26] Lord
[1:00:28] which brought thee forth out of the land
[1:00:30] of Egypt
[1:00:31] from the house of bondage now our house
[1:00:33] of Egypt is the world laodicea
[1:00:38] and sadly in many cases
[1:00:43] and brother Dale's too
[1:00:45] God's not always our number one priority
[1:00:47] thought
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:51] we might talk about going to our
[1:00:53] favorite restaurant
[1:00:54] on whatever Road it is more than we talk
[1:00:56] about
[1:01:02] amen
[1:01:04] and see God's watching this whole film
[1:01:07] and he can tell by your desires
[1:01:10] amen now I'm not preaching religion get
[1:01:13] me wrong religion you religion is just a
[1:01:16] covering you okay there's people that
[1:01:19] are anointed of the devil in churches
[1:01:22] this morning and they got a nice tie on
[1:01:24] they got a nice hair deal and they got a
[1:01:26] full robe and they put the collar up and
[1:01:29] they're saying God bless you
[1:01:35] and behind them
[1:01:36] is a dragon with the tail
[1:01:39] they're devouring the people I'm not
[1:01:42] talking about religion
[1:01:43] but that's no reason to say that Holy
[1:01:46] ghost-filled people are going to say
[1:01:47] well God knows my heart I would go to
[1:01:49] that church but brother Dale's the
[1:01:50] pastor or well God knows my heart but
[1:01:53] you know like it's a long ways or well
[1:01:56] God knows my heart but
[1:01:58] uh I just like to trim my hair because I
[1:02:01] get a headache when it gets too heavy
[1:02:02] I've heard that
[1:02:06] yeah
[1:02:07] the double lotion to trim your hair too
[1:02:10] or your skirt or amen amen or give you a
[1:02:14] goatee so you look like a goat if you're
[1:02:16] a man or
[1:02:17] amen you see what I mean
[1:02:20] it just it's things that you know we've
[1:02:22] seen somebody at a funeral a while ago
[1:02:25] and it was a family member my kids are
[1:02:26] probably going to smile when I say this
[1:02:27] but like his hairdo
[1:02:30] you know like
[1:02:32] you can have whatever hairdo you want we
[1:02:33] don't live in North Korea and so it's
[1:02:35] not doggy-minded by Kim Jones to have
[1:02:37] whatever kind of Heritage but like some
[1:02:39] hairdos just make you on talk about men
[1:02:44] make you look like Hitler
[1:02:47] like can you imagine if I got like the
[1:02:48] mustache like that and like did my hair
[1:02:50] like with grease like flipped their back
[1:02:54] they carry a spirit
[1:02:58] I know this is you say well brother
[1:03:00] where did you find this stuff that's
[1:03:02] what you know this person we've seen
[1:03:05] like their hair was long but it wasn't
[1:03:06] long it was all cut long and they combed
[1:03:09] it all back and then it was straight off
[1:03:11] right at the collar and they had to
[1:03:13] goatee
[1:03:16] and the first time I said I said like it
[1:03:18] looks so ridiculous because I was
[1:03:20] expecting to see somebody that resembled
[1:03:22] a Christian whether they were or not
[1:03:24] that's up to God and I was just like
[1:03:28] oh
[1:03:29] I was like
[1:03:31] what's that
[1:03:33] it looked like somebody that just came
[1:03:35] out of the barn
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:40] like it's a spirit
[1:03:44] huh
[1:03:46] you say well these you listen the realm
[1:03:49] around you that you can't see
[1:03:52] is more real than the one you can feel
[1:03:58] this whole place if you don't think so
[1:04:00] you describe ministers sometimes this
[1:04:01] whole place is Dancing with devils and
[1:04:03] angels
[1:04:08] and if you ever get under the anointing
[1:04:10] you'll be able to feel it and sometimes
[1:04:11] I get to catch them
[1:04:16] huh
[1:04:18] that's why when you go to a place like
[1:04:20] Uganda
[1:04:21] and the Believers have come for one
[1:04:22] purpose and they came three days before
[1:04:24] you got there even though it wasn't even
[1:04:26] scheduled till you got there and it came
[1:04:27] on Thursday night and it wasn't
[1:04:28] scheduled you talk about coming early
[1:04:30] for church that's coming early for
[1:04:31] church the first service is Saturday
[1:04:33] morning and you show up on Thursday
[1:04:35] you didn't want to be late
[1:04:37] like you were afraid the taxi might have
[1:04:39] a flat tire that's showing up early
[1:04:42] and somebody like me comes to the
[1:04:44] platform with notes and I never look at
[1:04:45] the notes one time and I try to preach
[1:04:48] for an hour and I preach for two and a
[1:04:49] half hours
[1:04:50] I'm like
[1:04:52] I'm done
[1:04:54] and I'm literally done and the whole
[1:04:56] movement
[1:04:58] is like
[1:05:02] you could have went right into eternity
[1:05:04] it's because of something you don't see
[1:05:07] it's spiritual warfare
[1:05:09] and it's a Spirits it's a spirits
[1:05:12] Satan is not coming in with a long coat
[1:05:15] and a long tail it's a spare it
[1:05:17] that were released in the Bible
[1:05:22] uh-huh
[1:05:24] it's not that you know if you want to
[1:05:26] cut your hair off the collar well bless
[1:05:28] God
[1:05:29] but it's a spare
[1:05:33] man
[1:05:35] Matthew 24 22.
[1:05:38] and I want to tell you we're going to go
[1:05:40] back to this scripture again
[1:05:42] and I looked it up
[1:05:44] studying and I did I just well like I'm
[1:05:47] not even going to go there
[1:05:49] but you know in the message Hub we have
[1:05:51] every scripture where the Prophet
[1:05:53] mentions to the scripture and he makes
[1:05:54] comments to the scriptures and in most
[1:05:57] of these verses there was over a hundred
[1:05:59] comments
[1:06:00] okay and there was ten verses so I would
[1:06:02] have to read like 1 000 quotes from The
[1:06:06] Prophet
[1:06:06] I didn't get that done in time for
[1:06:08] service today
[1:06:09] but I'll guarantee you we're going to
[1:06:11] come back to that
[1:06:13] and this is another example to kill that
[1:06:15] Spirit well like I can survive there's
[1:06:17] people have left this
[1:06:20] that a flat out told me flat out in
[1:06:22] messenger that I am going to
[1:06:25] it's going to be me and God
[1:06:29] we don't want to be hurt and so it'll
[1:06:31] just be me and God
[1:06:33] and here God knows that he's now we
[1:06:37] believe I already said that the holy
[1:06:39] spirit is your holder I know if you're
[1:06:41] predestinated yes I believe that you
[1:06:44] came from God and you'll go back to God
[1:06:46] I believe that in the Seven Seals the
[1:06:49] Seven Seals is the the unfolding of
[1:06:52] Christ
[1:06:54] hello help me preach it's the unfolding
[1:06:57] of Christ and you can't even unfold
[1:06:59] Christ with unfolded brother Dale you
[1:07:02] know I was preaching in Uganda I said
[1:07:04] when you unveil the seventh seals it
[1:07:06] actually shows Jesus Christ standing out
[1:07:09] there and I'm standing right beside the
[1:07:12] Son of God well because I was in him
[1:07:16] and if I wasn't standing beside the Son
[1:07:18] of God then Jesus ain't Complete because
[1:07:21] he's missing his little Tower his pinky
[1:07:23] or his hairdo or something because
[1:07:25] that's me
[1:07:27] and if you're ever gonna go there you
[1:07:29] got to get that Revelation for yourself
[1:07:31] and I can't give it to you if you were
[1:07:34] in him you'll be there in the end
[1:07:37] because God is complete
[1:07:40] and if being complete is part of you
[1:07:43] then you'll be there and you can't show
[1:07:46] me Christ without showing me brother
[1:07:48] Dale
[1:07:49] it ain't possible and I don't care what
[1:07:52] stories you've heard about my past or my
[1:07:55] youth or my childhood or anything if I
[1:07:58] came from Christ I'll be in Christ
[1:08:01] and Christ knew that too
[1:08:03] and he still said this
[1:08:06] he said Matthew 24 22.
[1:08:10] this is powerful he knew that
[1:08:12] he knew that I was in him and he would
[1:08:15] never be complete and he will never be
[1:08:18] uncomplete and so he never he knew that
[1:08:20] he would never be uncomplete so he knew
[1:08:22] I was coming back to him he knew that
[1:08:24] god Jehovah knew that and he said Son
[1:08:26] Matthew 24 22.
[1:08:29] he said except these days shall be
[1:08:31] shortened there shall be no brother Dale
[1:08:36] saved
[1:08:40] he said well look at that
[1:08:42] you just confused me greatly
[1:08:44] you came from God and God you must go
[1:08:48] back to God because God won't close the
[1:08:50] door until you're part of God
[1:08:52] and God still said this
[1:08:55] the prophet give us an answer that
[1:08:57] hundreds of them but he said this is
[1:09:00] what he said and this is why God's
[1:09:01] preaching on this he said the despairing
[1:09:04] of the age has so entangled
[1:09:09] asked all
[1:09:11] that even though you're elected
[1:09:15] you are so in God in Hollywood
[1:09:19] and everything
[1:09:24] that God's like using tweezers pulling
[1:09:27] out the hairs
[1:09:29] so you don't miss a freckle
[1:09:32] that was a part of them
[1:09:34] it's like a mass wreck where there's
[1:09:37] nothing but spaghetti and they get the
[1:09:38] vacuum and vacuum up pour it in a
[1:09:42] h
[1:09:44] that's how Satan has just infiltrated
[1:09:47] even the elected bride of Christ
[1:09:52] thus saith the prophet
[1:09:54] you don't believe me
[1:09:57] but the scripture says but for the
[1:10:00] elect's sake
[1:10:02] it'll be short
[1:10:04] you say wow bless God I got the baptism
[1:10:06] the Holy Ghost I'm fine yeah you're fine
[1:10:08] but you're still on take your ground
[1:10:12] because God said even you couldn't
[1:10:13] survived
[1:10:17] they remember when when Daniel Prayed in
[1:10:19] Daniel and God sent Gabriel the Angel
[1:10:23] his head Angel next to us can you
[1:10:25] imagine leaving the Throne of God you
[1:10:27] couldn't even survive there because God
[1:10:29] so holy you would disintegrate and the
[1:10:32] Gabriel Angel was standing there see
[1:10:33] they weren't born in sin shaped in the
[1:10:34] liquid comes the world speaking life and
[1:10:36] Gabriel the Angel's been standing there
[1:10:37] for like thousands of years and God says
[1:10:40] go and answer brother Dale's prayer in
[1:10:42] Wyoming I love that scripture I could
[1:10:45] lose my mind at that scripture and
[1:10:47] Daniel Prayed and God immediately sent
[1:10:49] the angel to heal your sister Patricia
[1:10:51] just like that but Satan was there and
[1:10:53] he fought the angel
[1:10:56] and sister Patricia thought why I
[1:10:57] thought Jesus didn't love me because he
[1:10:59] never showed up
[1:11:00] and God's pulling out his sword and for
[1:11:03] where and machine gun and Tom I
[1:11:06] shooting all the demons
[1:11:10] and the Bible says
[1:11:13] that Gabriel never succeeded
[1:11:19] until he called Michael
[1:11:23] good oh Lord Jesus
[1:11:26] he said I'll be Lord
[1:11:29] that's all you got to say is just call
[1:11:31] me Jesus Oh me come without me
[1:11:37] hey Gabriel said and I was able to go
[1:11:39] see Patricia
[1:11:41] now guess what he did and the scripture
[1:11:43] also said I left Jesus behind to fight
[1:11:45] tonight
[1:11:48] and you thought you were having a hard
[1:11:49] day
[1:11:52] I told you that story to tell you this
[1:11:54] and you were going to fight against
[1:11:56] Satan you and the Holy Spirit
[1:12:00] Gabriel couldn't
[1:12:04] Gabriel couldn't
[1:12:07] Master purposes gay broke on it in 21
[1:12:10] days
[1:12:14] amen
[1:12:16] that's why Jesus wrote the scripture
[1:12:18] that if I didn't what this means in
[1:12:21] Reverse is if I don't shorten the days
[1:12:23] even the baptism of the Holy Ghost will
[1:12:25] be lost
[1:12:27] so he says for the elect's sake but you
[1:12:30] could rephrase that and say for God's
[1:12:32] sake he had to be complete so he
[1:12:34] shortened it to draw himself back
[1:12:36] together
[1:12:38] oh
[1:12:40] that's unbelievable you're not going to
[1:12:42] hear that at a denominational Church
[1:12:44] because they don't realize that you're
[1:12:46] part of God
[1:12:47] and you're King God that's not religion
[1:12:49] that's a family unit
[1:12:52] you can't separate a family Union when
[1:12:55] blood's mix Bloods mix forever
[1:12:58] amen
[1:13:00] Hallelujah oh Hallelujah you could lose
[1:13:04] your mind on that
[1:13:05] it's because it's Christ it's beautiful
[1:13:08] and here's Satan he said watch this he
[1:13:10] said it's a quote in 60. and I'm
[1:13:12] paraphrasing I just paragraph 59 if you
[1:13:14] want to check it out I have the
[1:13:15] information for you Satan said he's fed
[1:13:17] he fed us so much Corruption of hell
[1:13:21] that many thousands and thousands have
[1:13:25] believed it
[1:13:31] huh
[1:13:33] that's why brother Dale needs you
[1:13:37] and that's why you need your husband and
[1:13:39] that's why you need your kids and that
[1:13:41] is because that's why brother Dale loves
[1:13:43] Fellowship you think I want to sit home
[1:13:44] alone forget it
[1:13:48] amen it's spirits
[1:13:51] birds with feathers flocked together
[1:13:52] what's the Bible say when we all bring
[1:13:55] our liquor fire together in the church
[1:13:56] we get a whole big bonfire you know you
[1:13:59] should desire this place be packed out
[1:14:01] for one reason alone to get a bigger
[1:14:03] fire
[1:14:04] Matt
[1:14:08] Hallelujah
[1:14:11] he says multiple things like well like a
[1:14:15] thousand quotes on that verses
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:24] our Prophet said
[1:14:25] if it wasn't for God's grace
[1:14:28] I wouldn't even make it
[1:14:31] and I'm a part of God you say but I
[1:14:34] but it's still Amazing Grace
[1:14:36] all you need to do is hear my life story
[1:14:38] and you'll just say oh my goodness all
[1:14:40] you need to do is hear about us going to
[1:14:42] Uganda and just say oh God some people
[1:14:43] are like are so blind they're just so
[1:14:45] blind you're so blind you just want to
[1:14:47] smack them right in the nose they said
[1:14:49] well I want to see God move in the
[1:14:50] church well I see God move everything
[1:14:52] time I breathe
[1:14:57] oh man that felt really take a deep
[1:15:00] breath
[1:15:02] oh thank you Jesus
[1:15:05] Jesus thank you Jesus for giving me
[1:15:07] lungs
[1:15:12] I can breathe
[1:15:14] you're Stone blind you're living on the
[1:15:17] ocean you say I want to see the ocean
[1:15:18] yeah I can't hear the ocean
[1:15:21] because God is the prophet said he's
[1:15:23] twinkled so many toys in front of you
[1:15:25] that you're not even impressed anymore
[1:15:27] with God
[1:15:28] you're not near any press God can just
[1:15:30] sprinkle himself there well that was
[1:15:32] just God that was just oh well you were
[1:15:34] just lucky oh luck alike like where's
[1:15:36] life come from
[1:15:37] can you please tell me where that come
[1:15:39] from
[1:15:39] so we're going to Uganda and you know we
[1:15:42] came the day before and we're leaving at
[1:15:44] nine o'clock we're leaving our house I
[1:15:45] don't know if I told you this but I'm
[1:15:46] sorry to bore you amen and we're leaving
[1:15:48] our house I'm telling you this because
[1:15:50] the devil wants to hear about God being
[1:15:51] alive my God's still alive he works all
[1:15:54] the time by the way amen and so we went
[1:15:57] to the thing we got some American money
[1:15:59] some Canadian money you know kick the
[1:16:00] tires and everything and we'd sent Leo
[1:16:02] some money a few days earlier and you
[1:16:04] know we're going and we operate out of
[1:16:07] our visa when we're there we just go get
[1:16:08] cash advances because it's easier to get
[1:16:10] money there and Leo messaged me at seven
[1:16:13] o'clock says Dale I need money
[1:16:15] said you need money I'll be there in 24
[1:16:17] hours
[1:16:18] he says oh yeah but the people want to
[1:16:20] you know
[1:16:22] try not to eat for 24 hours
[1:16:25] like the painter painting the charts
[1:16:27] when he gets done
[1:16:29] I know you don't know what it feels like
[1:16:31] but they wouldn't have nothing
[1:16:34] to eat
[1:16:36] so one minute after he's done pain he
[1:16:39] wants to go buy a bag of rice
[1:16:41] he said wait 24 hours just try that
[1:16:43] don't eat lunch today I'll eat for you
[1:16:46] you say oh bless God he could wait 24
[1:16:48] hours really I didn't see many of you
[1:16:51] waiting 24 hours
[1:16:52] when we packed dinner
[1:16:55] so I said oh Leo I said seven o'clock in
[1:16:59] the morning there ain't many there ain't
[1:17:00] a lot of post office opens there ain't a
[1:17:02] lot of uh banks open you know

[1:17:08] cards that I don't even believe in my
[1:17:09] wife does I don't I haven't backslid yet
[1:17:11] and and so we went and the car didn't
[1:17:13] work
[1:17:15] I believe in cash by the way
[1:17:17] I believe in cash or gold not encouraged
[1:17:19] I don't believe in plastic
[1:17:21] and even though I did use mine in Uganda
[1:17:24] I had to repent
[1:17:26] um
[1:17:27] and we went the card wouldn't work
[1:17:30] and I just tell you what you just try it

[1:17:44] that they won't even open the door
[1:17:47] okay I'll bet you ten well not that I'm
[1:17:49] bad but you know what I'm saying
[1:17:51] and but see
[1:17:53] you wonder if I was supposed to go to
[1:17:55] God but God opened the door
[1:17:58] and the first person was anointed of the
[1:18:00] devil and they said we don't open for 20
[1:18:02] minutes but then God walked by and the
[1:18:04] second person said by the way I'll get

[1:18:56] you know but most post offices open at
[1:18:58] night right

[1:19:01] but on Thursday in Oil Springs attend
[1:19:06] hello and just in case you don't know it
[1:19:09] Devil by the way the post office workers
[1:19:12] work for the federal government
[1:19:14] and if you think you're going to get
[1:19:16] favors from a federal government
[1:19:17] employee that you can't call by name
[1:19:21] you need more therapy
[1:19:26] am I all right so far
[1:19:28] well I get to the post office at quarter
[1:19:30] to nine now I'm catching a plane to
[1:19:32] Uganda
[1:19:36] and I knock on the door and God had me
[1:19:39] put on my spring jacket that was my Dale
[1:19:41] siding one which I don't even like to
[1:19:43] wear because I left it behind I did not
[1:19:45] take it to Uganda with me and the lady
[1:19:47] answered the door and I said I need to
[1:19:49] send the MoneyGram and she said I only
[1:19:52] answered the door because God had you
[1:19:53] put on your Dale siding code
[1:19:56] and I said well that's okay with me but
[1:19:58] I'm going on an airplane and I need to
[1:20:00] send money and she looked at her clock
[1:20:02] and she said today's Thursday and we
[1:20:04] open at 10.
[1:20:09] and you say well you know my God I don't
[1:20:12] believe in this kind of Miracle stuff
[1:20:13] you know like bless God that happened in
[1:20:15] the Bible times but you know bless God
[1:20:17] you know like that was David and Goliath
[1:20:19] you know we don't expect that today
[1:20:22] okay
[1:20:24] it's okay if you want to serve that God
[1:20:25] it's a different God than I have you can
[1:20:28] call them the same thing but it makes no
[1:20:30] difference like there's other Dales in
[1:20:31] the world but they're not me
[1:20:36] and I said well I'm going to Uganda and
[1:20:39] I need to send some money MoneyGram and
[1:20:40] I need a plane to catch
[1:20:43] and this is a federal worker that I have
[1:20:46] no clue who her name is and I couldn't
[1:20:47] even honestly tell you if I've ever seen
[1:20:49] her before I possibly could
[1:20:51] but it was not a recognized face
[1:20:55] and she says
[1:20:58] come in I said
[1:21:03] oh you were lucky brother lucky
[1:21:06] what kind of a devil God are you serving
[1:21:13] amen you say well oh God I'm not sure if
[1:21:16] I was supposed to go to Uganda
[1:21:21] you know like some people if a
[1:21:23] sledgehammer hit him right between the
[1:21:24] ice
[1:21:26] they wouldn't know what happened
[1:21:30] it's sad it's
[1:21:32] they can't help it
[1:21:34] amen Deuteronomy 11 I'm sorry
[1:21:38] that I was free that wasn't nothing here
[1:21:41] Deuteronomy 11
[1:21:43] . uh are you put on my glasses to see
[1:21:46] eight it looks like uh 18.
[1:21:49] therefore shall we lay up these my words
[1:21:51] in your heart and in your soul and bind
[1:21:55] them in the sign upon thy hand now by
[1:21:58] the way this is not the same scripture I
[1:21:59] just read
[1:22:01] why did God put it in the Bible twice
[1:22:07] bind it in the hand that thy may as
[1:22:10] front letters between Thine Eyes I'm not
[1:22:13] sure what front letters is but I think
[1:22:15] it's something like this
[1:22:18] I'm a Believer
[1:22:21] man
[1:22:23] I'd say carrying your character just
[1:22:26] your atmosphere around you the anointing
[1:22:29] around you is beautiful
[1:22:32] it's inviting
[1:22:35] you know what I'm saying it's like when
[1:22:37] you go to somebody's door that's a
[1:22:38] stranger and they're they open the door
[1:22:40] and they say good morning it's an
[1:22:42] inviting atmosphere
[1:22:46] huh
[1:22:50] and ye shall teach them now this is a
[1:22:52] command
[1:22:54] brother Jared this command and thou
[1:22:56] shalt teach them to your children and I
[1:22:58] don't mean Julie that means you amen
[1:23:00] Thou shalt teach them to thy children
[1:23:05] speaking of them when thou sit us in thy
[1:23:08] house and when thou walk is in the way
[1:23:10] and when thou layest down and when
[1:23:12] they'll raise us up and thou shall write
[1:23:14] them upon the doorpost upon their house
[1:23:16] and upon the gates and that the days may
[1:23:20] be multiplied onto days multiplied and
[1:23:24] the days of your children in the land
[1:23:26] which the Lord spared your fathers and
[1:23:28] give them
[1:23:29] and the days of Heaven upon the Earth
[1:23:32] and if Thou shalt diligently keep all
[1:23:35] these Commandments which I have
[1:23:36] commanded thee to do
[1:23:39] to love the Lord thy God Walk in his
[1:23:41] ways
[1:23:42] and to cleave unto him and I know what
[1:23:44] the devil just told you because I heard
[1:23:46] it
[1:23:47] he said well bless God this was the Old
[1:23:49] Testament and this was for Israel I'm
[1:23:52] sure glad he brought that up
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:57] because I got hundreds of New Testaments
[1:23:59] but let's go to Joshua
[1:24:02] just to continue thought here here
[1:24:04] Joshua and I love this part if you ever
[1:24:07] see it amen I don't believe in
[1:24:09] worshiping your pastor and I don't
[1:24:11] believe in worshiping prophets either
[1:24:12] amen and Joshua at the beginning of
[1:24:15] Joshua he says Moses my servant is dead
[1:24:19] Moses was God to pharaoh
[1:24:22] you can't get much higher than that in
[1:24:24] God's chain
[1:24:25] was God to Pharaoh God told Moses he
[1:24:28] said why are you crying to me just speak
[1:24:30] it that's exactly what God's telling you
[1:24:33] this morning you need your healing you
[1:24:35] just speak it you say God it's mine you
[1:24:38] paid the price on Calvary it's already
[1:24:40] paid for it's all you got to do is
[1:24:42] withdraw it now I I use this in Uganda
[1:24:45] and maybe I mentioned this before I left
[1:24:47] but it came to me again he said your
[1:24:49] healing is like eating dinner at my
[1:24:51] table at home
[1:24:52] and my wife don't do this very often but
[1:24:55] I'm still training her but my mom used
[1:24:57] to put all the food on the table
[1:25:00] and we would pass it to the right
[1:25:03] or the left
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:06] and the prophet said your healing sister
[1:25:08] Patricia's just like this say brother
[1:25:10] Dale will you pass the potatoes
[1:25:13] now you can see them sitting on the
[1:25:16] table
[1:25:17] hello I don't think you heard me you can
[1:25:19] see your healing sitting on the table
[1:25:22] and you say would you please
[1:25:24] nicely to Jesus would you please nicely
[1:25:27] pass me my healing
[1:25:29] he said that's exactly
[1:25:32] what it's like
[1:25:35] and I was doing without
[1:25:39] back up Lucifer
[1:25:42] I mean look at how easy it is for me to
[1:25:44] ask pasta pizza
[1:25:49] man
[1:25:51] and we were worried about our unsaved
[1:25:54] loved ones
[1:25:57] no
[1:25:58] hello
[1:26:00] and here so we're just a few chapters up
[1:26:03] and you know Joshua
[1:26:06] was a greater Warrior and the Bible than
[1:26:09] Moses ever was
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:12] I'll say it for you now if you want to
[1:26:14] take that to the prophet
[1:26:16] and Moses that means you're a greater
[1:26:19] Warrior
[1:26:20] oh you didn't like that one
[1:26:25] God came through Moses
[1:26:28] but the Next Generation were greater
[1:26:30] Warriors than Moses
[1:26:33] bless God that's free
[1:26:36] it's still the truth
[1:26:38] because them without you ain't not made
[1:26:40] perfect
[1:26:41] amen you're fighting worse demons now
[1:26:46] than when our Prophet was here
[1:26:50] amen if you don't think so the 60s was a
[1:26:53] lot Tamer then as it is now
[1:26:56] well I
[1:26:59] let me rephrase that they're more active
[1:27:02] and exposed
[1:27:05] they're more in our face
[1:27:08] back then they were more shy they were
[1:27:10] in the closets so they may and probably
[1:27:14] were still around in our Prophets
[1:27:17] but they were hidden
[1:27:19] because they were bashful
[1:27:21] now they're not bashful
[1:27:23] amen but look at what God told the
[1:27:26] people and Joshua's time to do
[1:27:30] I'm trying to lay a foundation here and
[1:27:31] I'm going to shut her down soon because
[1:27:33] we got three or four Services of this
[1:27:36] but what I'm saying is the godwear
[1:27:38] servant even though he is super duper
[1:27:43] he still likes physical stuff brother
[1:27:45] Matt
[1:27:46] you know what I mean he still likes us
[1:27:48] to you know be decently dressed
[1:27:52] and he still likes women to wear women's
[1:27:54] clothes and men to wear men's clothes
[1:27:57] and the Bible says the other than that
[1:27:59] it's an Abomination which is just puke
[1:28:03] to God
[1:28:05] amen it's because it and you say well I
[1:28:09] don't believe God cares in our day this
[1:28:10] is why God cares it's very simple
[1:28:12] brother Dale don't care that's entirely
[1:28:14] up to you
[1:28:15] but in Genesis God took
[1:28:19] and and I almost lost my mind preaching
[1:28:21] in Uganda when I mentioned this but I
[1:28:23] said God God was going to make us
[1:28:27] but we were already in God
[1:28:29] this is I mean anything could happen now
[1:28:34] and God said to me
[1:28:36] God said to us
[1:28:38] well we weren't made yet
[1:28:39] but we were in him
[1:28:42] are you getting the picture
[1:28:43] this is the beginning of time there's no
[1:28:45] Earth
[1:28:46] or God had just made it he's he's almost
[1:28:48] feeling tired it's like the fifth day
[1:28:52] and God said to us me and you brother I
[1:28:54] said hey hey Matt and Dale why don't we
[1:28:56] make us
[1:29:00] hello I oh wow that's a lot different
[1:29:04] here than in Uganda I mean I said that
[1:29:06] like a thousand people just about lost
[1:29:08] their mind
[1:29:09] God said
[1:29:11] let us make you
[1:29:14] let us make you and so when God and we
[1:29:17] said okay that sounds good god let's
[1:29:19] make us
[1:29:20] because see I was in God and so God was
[1:29:23] talking to me because I was I was right
[1:29:24] there I was I heard the whole thing
[1:29:29] oh man you're daddy
[1:29:31] I heard the whole thing he said I'd like
[1:29:34] to make you and I you know I'm just
[1:29:36] sitting here to I said oh that sounds
[1:29:38] good God yeah let's try it out
[1:29:41] that's exactly how it is church it ain't
[1:29:44] more Super than that I mean if that
[1:29:46] ain't super enough for you like
[1:29:48] you you need a shot of something amen
[1:29:55] and then God so now I was made
[1:29:58] and and it was me and Luanne because see
[1:30:01] we were one
[1:30:03] it's exactly what the Bible says
[1:30:05] exactly I'm not making this up the same
[1:30:08] brother Dale's Doctrine it's not the
[1:30:09] doctrine of our church
[1:30:12] Brother Band said the Millennium you'll
[1:30:13] be with your your mate and he said if
[1:30:16] you made a mistake and got the wrong
[1:30:17] mate here if you happen to he said God
[1:30:19] will give you the right mate in the
[1:30:21] Millennium because all wrongs are made
[1:30:22] right and see you're incomplete not
[1:30:24] being this one
[1:30:26] and so I so God was making me and me and
[1:30:28] Luanne were standing there and we were
[1:30:29] like having a cool old time like just
[1:30:31] and he said hey by the way he said I'm
[1:30:34] going to pull the feminine Spirit out of
[1:30:36] you and I'll have masculine ugly
[1:30:39] and feminine beautiful
[1:30:41] and we said
[1:30:43] that sounds cool guy
[1:30:47] and so he took me
[1:30:49] and so I got a beautiful me
[1:30:51] and an ugly knee that was all right
[1:30:54] and he said okay because it's our way I
[1:30:57] want you to dress different
[1:30:59] because a man
[1:31:00] is like ugly
[1:31:01] I mean it's just the way it is you can't
[1:31:03] put a pretty face on an ugly person
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:07] I mean they're trying to do that in
[1:31:08] plastic surgery but it hurts you know
[1:31:13] but then you got this and you know like
[1:31:15] the sisters brother Matt you know I'm
[1:31:17] talking like 60 year old sisters well
[1:31:20] come and get my plate
[1:31:29] I like brother Jose said the anointing
[1:31:31] around that atmosphere
[1:31:34] was like a unbully
[1:31:39] like if you were a man you could just
[1:31:40] hardly hear this is a and I don't mean
[1:31:42] lustful at all
[1:31:44] there was just so sweet
[1:31:47] that's so beautiful
[1:31:52] Satan has taught Womanhood a great big
[1:31:55] fat juicy lie and he's the Fat Liar of
[1:32:01] lice and his father was a fat liar of
[1:32:04] lice too
[1:32:05] that Womanhood is more Purdy with the
[1:32:09] masculine spirit
[1:32:10] rule
[1:32:16] on divorce number 10.
[1:32:20] that's disgusting it's just repulsive it
[1:32:23] just
[1:32:24] God
[1:32:30] and then you go to Uganda
[1:32:32] let's go
[1:32:37] you're free
[1:32:44] it's a feminine spirit
[1:32:47] and that feminine spirit
[1:32:49] came from God
[1:32:51] and God didn't plan on them being mixed
[1:32:54] and that's why he separated them
[1:32:56] and they won't be mixed again
[1:32:58] until they go back in him
[1:33:00] but when you're outside of him they're
[1:33:02] separate
[1:33:03] and you think we'll bless God the
[1:33:05] Womanhood is different today that's why
[1:33:07] when you see a man when he comes after
[1:33:09] your daughter's brother Matt and he's
[1:33:11] walked in like this
[1:33:12] kick them in the knee
[1:33:15] I'm serious
[1:33:19] because he's
[1:33:22] packing a feminist beer
[1:33:27] that's not God by the way
[1:33:30] not in a man
[1:33:32] but when you see his sweet beautiful
[1:33:37] girl
[1:33:39] and she's just
[1:33:42] beautiful in the eyes of God
[1:33:46] because she was a part of God
[1:33:50] and she's a feminine part of God and God
[1:33:52] just looks like oh
[1:33:54] God oh
[1:33:57] whoa
[1:34:05] what he said well bust God I don't
[1:34:07] believe in being
[1:34:09] I don't believe in a woman being a mad
[1:34:10] either
[1:34:12] I never one time in the Bible seen a
[1:34:14] queen be a doorman
[1:34:17] they were sitting right up beside the
[1:34:18] big old fat guy
[1:34:21] and most of the time in the Bible they
[1:34:23] said she had half the kingdom
[1:34:26] hello
[1:34:28] Satan's lying to somebody here
[1:34:30] Satan's lying to somebody here
[1:34:33] there's nothing wrong matter of fact
[1:34:36] it's beautiful
[1:34:40] to be a feminine
[1:34:42] and if God had made me a feminine before
[1:34:44] the foundation of the world
[1:34:46] I would have been the sweetest kneeling
[1:34:48] down feminine Spirit you ever did see
[1:34:52] because that's what God made
[1:34:55] that's what God was
[1:34:57] and that's what he made and that's what
[1:34:59] was in his thoughts
[1:35:03] it's just unbelievable
[1:35:05] that's why
[1:35:06] when I met brother Martins
[1:35:09] Sister Abigail
[1:35:10] I said I like that one restaurant
[1:35:12] because it's all beautiful sisters and
[1:35:15] they all got the little there's a
[1:35:17] special thing he's got to be a man to
[1:35:19] understand this I don't expect one to
[1:35:21] understand it because you can't figure
[1:35:22] out my brain and I ain't even going to
[1:35:23] try to figure out your brain but you
[1:35:24] have to have just a little flowers in a
[1:35:26] cotton dress and it just flows just
[1:35:30] you know and it's just a hair
[1:35:32] oh
[1:35:34] you know it's just like here's your suit
[1:35:37] so
[1:35:38] oh
[1:35:42] oh you go to one oh hey honey how are
[1:35:45] you doing today
[1:35:56] and that's exactly what God Said
[1:35:58] thoughts
[1:35:59] you saying brother Dale why do you think
[1:36:01] you have those thoughts because I came
[1:36:02] from God and God has the same thoughts
[1:36:07] that was free too I didn't have that in
[1:36:10] that spot here but amen let's look at
[1:36:12] Joshua 4 and we're going to read and
[1:36:15] again we're going to start at one and I
[1:36:17] want to show you where God's looking for
[1:36:19] physical stuff I'm trying to
[1:36:21] God is killing this devil where it says
[1:36:24] well God just sees my heart
[1:36:26] he knows I love him
[1:36:28] well God wants to maybe you know this is
[1:36:31] free but you know sometimes you wives
[1:36:34] need counseling
[1:36:36] because like see we made an agreement
[1:36:38] when me and the Wayne got married
[1:36:43] I can only share my testimony I'm sorry
[1:36:46] we agreed like ahead of time brother
[1:36:49] Matt that we neither one would change
[1:36:53] like that means if I open the car door
[1:36:55] before marriage I open the doctor
[1:36:56] because you don't know how to open it
[1:36:58] like how would you know how to open it
[1:37:00] because I open it
[1:37:01] you know I mean you see what I mean I
[1:37:04] like really drank out of one class in
[1:37:06] the restaurant a Pepsi
[1:37:07] you know and get a whole pizza and then
[1:37:10] we did that a while and
[1:37:13] and
[1:37:16] but see
[1:37:19] this is God
[1:37:23] when you become common
[1:37:25] with God or church or fantasies man
[1:37:29] I don't care if I say Amen
[1:37:32] I don't care if I clap
[1:37:34] let's go to the physical now my wife
[1:37:36] says well I don't care if I give you a
[1:37:37] little hug or give you a little peck on
[1:37:39] the cheek
[1:37:40] or you know
[1:37:43] touch you once in a while
[1:37:46] just put that to spiritual well you know
[1:37:48] don't really matter if I come late to
[1:37:49] church maybe I'll even miss a few times
[1:37:52] how many times I like to be without my
[1:37:54] honey
[1:37:55] I mean I didn't get married to live
[1:37:56] separate
[1:37:59] but God didn't get married to you
[1:38:00] spiritually to live separate
[1:38:03] and God likes to you know
[1:38:09] you hear me
[1:38:12] because God's real
[1:38:14] don't make God some far away like
[1:38:16] mystery no no God's real God likes it
[1:38:18] when you know God likes holding hands
[1:38:22] he said oh well we're not 18 anymore
[1:38:25] really
[1:38:26] God never changed see he he he ain't had
[1:38:29] no birthdays
[1:38:38] and we miss it
[1:38:41] because we've changed not God we
[1:38:47] I'm dignified
[1:38:50] I don't act like that in public
[1:38:53] I'm not talking about
[1:38:56] yeah there's nothing wrong with pressing
[1:38:58] God in public
[1:39:00] there's nothing wrong with someone whoa
[1:39:08] we've been lied to
[1:39:10] you've been lied to by Satan well God
[1:39:12] ain't into God ain't into all that no
[1:39:14] I'll show you what God ain't into
[1:39:18] and I was closed after
[1:39:20] I read a quote right after the scripture
[1:39:23] Joshua one and it came to pass it when
[1:39:25] all the people were clean passed over
[1:39:27] Jordan and that was a miracle on itself
[1:39:29] that the Lord spoke unto Joshua and he
[1:39:32] said take 12 men out of the people out
[1:39:33] of every tribe of man and command ye
[1:39:37] them saying
[1:39:39] put it in your heart so I can't see it
[1:39:41] but God can see it
[1:39:44] you know remember when Jesus was on
[1:39:46] Earth and Jesus said this is so you
[1:39:48] could hear the voice he said I didn't
[1:39:50] need to hear the voice when God spoke to
[1:39:52] him amen
[1:39:54] and he said take ye hats out of the
[1:39:56] midst of the Jordan and place where the
[1:39:59] priest's feet stood firm 12 Stones that
[1:40:03] you should carry them over with you and
[1:40:05] leave them in a lodging place where ye
[1:40:08] shall Lodge
[1:40:09] this night
[1:40:12] hello
[1:40:14] and Joshua called on to 12 men and
[1:40:16] prepared the children of Israel out of
[1:40:17] every tribe of man and Joshua said unto
[1:40:19] them Passover before the Ark of the Lord
[1:40:21] thy God into the midst of the Jordan and
[1:40:24] take ye up every man a stone on his
[1:40:26] shoulder according to the number of the
[1:40:28] tribes of Israel which were 12. and that
[1:40:31] this may be a sign unto your children
[1:40:37] that this may this is verse six that
[1:40:39] this may be a sign among you that when
[1:40:42] your children ask their fathers in the
[1:40:46] time to pass what mean thou these stones
[1:40:51] hello
[1:40:53] why didn't God just say well just write
[1:40:55] it I'll remind you
[1:40:58] God could have reminded us
[1:41:02] God wanted something with skin on it
[1:41:05] called stones in this case
[1:41:07] to be a trophy
[1:41:10] for a miracle he did he was a show-off
[1:41:15] it's all right God can show off
[1:41:17] I'm not afraid to show off for God it
[1:41:19] ain't me that did it it's not me that
[1:41:21] did it my father in me that does it
[1:41:23] that's what Jesus said
[1:41:26] amen we need to step up to the play
[1:41:31] amen
[1:41:33] like listen like orphanage children
[1:41:36] might walk with their head down you know
[1:41:38] we're homeless
[1:41:41] hello
[1:41:42] but if you're converted you have parents
[1:41:47] and they're loaded
[1:41:51] spiritually speaking
[1:41:54] hello
[1:42:01] that this may be a sign on to you that
[1:42:04] when your children ask the fathers in
[1:42:06] the time saying that means father have
[1:42:08] to slow down enough that the children
[1:42:10] actually have time enough
[1:42:13] ask you
[1:42:16] what meaneth saw these Stones then thou
[1:42:19] shall answer them the Waters of the
[1:42:20] Jordan were cut off before the Ark of
[1:42:23] the Covenant in the springtime when it
[1:42:25] was above the brim
[1:42:29] of the Covenant of the Lord when it
[1:42:31] passed over Jordan in the waters of the
[1:42:33] Jordan were cut off and these these
[1:42:36] Stones stand as a memorial
[1:42:40] but I'm still with us
[1:42:43] that I'm God of gods and King of Kings
[1:42:47] and if anybody asks what's going on
[1:42:52] you couldn't remind
[1:42:55] hello
[1:42:57] God wants you to remind your kids
[1:43:02] amen what did Peter say in the Bible I
[1:43:04] bring this in remembrance
[1:43:08] to your remembrance
[1:43:10] you were forgetting that God likes
[1:43:12] holding hands
[1:43:16] it's not a religion it's a relationship
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:23] Hallelujah now not not that uh quote I'd
[1:43:26] read just before this I actually took
[1:43:28] another paragraph out of it and I'm
[1:43:30] going to close with these uh quotes and
[1:43:33] before
[1:43:36] my next scripture
[1:43:37] and he this was a
[1:43:43] in the 60 quote I just read previous he
[1:43:46] said the falling there's a great falling
[1:43:49] away and cooling off and there is
[1:43:52] everything
[1:43:54] there's a there's a great Falling Away
[1:43:57] story and cooling off but is there
[1:43:59] anything too hard
[1:44:02] for the Lord
[1:44:04] he said in the pair in a message in 63
[1:44:07] the end of 63. he said
[1:44:10] he predicted that the spirits in this
[1:44:13] system would be so much
[1:44:17] like the real thing until it would
[1:44:20] deceive the very elected
[1:44:23] if
[1:44:25] possible
[1:44:27] and I skipped out one part and brother
[1:44:29] Brown talks your name that I'm I'm
[1:44:32] paraphrasing that I took out he said he
[1:44:34] talked about your names being in the
[1:44:36] Lamb's Book of Life now watch this
[1:44:38] Brother people ask brother Brown the
[1:44:39] prophet he said who's going to be there
[1:44:41] in the in the in heaven he said if your
[1:44:44] names are in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:44:45] that means if you were a part of God
[1:44:47] you'll be there
[1:44:49] and listen to what the prophet said
[1:44:53] knowing and saying that the sentence
[1:44:55] before
[1:44:56] and frankly it's got to them
[1:45:00] so tied up
[1:45:02] until God said that if he didn't cut it
[1:45:06] short
[1:45:07] they're safe
[1:45:08] they're no flesh
[1:45:11] saved
[1:45:12] and I I uh please forgive me I had I had
[1:45:16] one on my on my phone and I'm just I'm
[1:45:19] closing with this quote
[1:45:21] and he said uh
[1:45:23] matter of fact I'm going to close my
[1:45:27] this was tied to the scriptures May 20
[1:45:30] or I see 24.
[1:45:35] he's he made women different from men
[1:45:38] and men different from women and he
[1:45:40] dressed them different and wants them to
[1:45:42] stay that way and women wants to look
[1:45:44] like man and wants women and oh my
[1:45:47] that's where you get gay and lesbians
[1:45:48] the sex perversion he said and the whole
[1:45:51] thing looks like it's got
[1:45:53] It's gotta watch this he's talking about
[1:45:56] you
[1:45:57] and he said the whole thing looks like
[1:45:59] it's got a grip
[1:46:02] on the people
[1:46:04] and you can't change it
[1:46:07] I can't change it either
[1:46:10] that's why this place is
[1:46:13] mostly
[1:46:20] looks like a great monster
[1:46:22] and a great Blackness and if you
[1:46:25] understand what I'm speaking of it's in
[1:46:28] the spirit
[1:46:33] oh I wish
[1:46:36] our monsters got them grab I'm I'm
[1:46:39] reading you can have this is on my a
[1:46:42] monster's got them grabbed and they just
[1:46:45] can't get away from them and it's too
[1:46:48] much
[1:46:49] Hollywood
[1:46:52] too much
[1:46:54] television
[1:46:56] and too much other
[1:46:59] nonsense
[1:47:06] everything we've got
[1:47:09] on word for word
[1:47:11] everything you got
[1:47:14] is polluted
[1:47:19] whoa you wonder why the God's preaching
[1:47:21] on this
[1:47:24] no wonder if the work isn't cut short
[1:47:28] for the elect's sake there would be
[1:47:30] nobody come to this church in Wyoming
[1:47:33] I paraphrase that
[1:47:34] for the elect's sake there'd be no flesh
[1:47:37] safe you said I never known that before
[1:47:40] well now you know it from now on see
[1:47:44] You'd better stop doing that
[1:47:51] so bless God I'd never go there
[1:47:53] just wait till your grandkids are born
[1:48:04] God help me
[1:48:06] but stand
[1:48:09] man
[1:48:11] amen God help me
[1:48:18] what God was doing this morning
[1:48:21] was putting flesh on him
[1:48:23] because the devil has tried to distance
[1:48:26] God from us and he's tried to remove
[1:48:29] flesh even for healing and salvation of
[1:48:32] our lost ones and all that he's put
[1:48:34] God's way out there and I don't know if
[1:48:36] we can really get a grip on them
[1:48:39] Satan's done that not brother Dale Satan
[1:48:42] has
[1:48:43] and he's also put God way out there like
[1:48:45] well you know it really don't matter if
[1:48:47] we
[1:48:48] for us or really don't matter if we say
[1:48:50] Amen spiritually or Go whoo
[1:48:55] tell you what
[1:48:58] the Bible says that if he didn't go
[1:49:01] the God would have the stones do it for
[1:49:03] him
[1:49:06] lady came Father Brown said you know I
[1:49:08] really have trouble preaching when
[1:49:10] brother Dale goes
[1:49:12] brother Brown said I'd have a lot of
[1:49:14] trouble preaching if brother Dale didn't
[1:49:15] go woohoo
[1:49:20] it's another round
[1:49:23] just like the TV shows and the radio
[1:49:25] stations are passing right through here
[1:49:27] you turn on your Wi-Fi and it'll work
[1:49:31] so Satan's Wi-Fi
[1:49:34] and gods and it's a supernatural battle
[1:49:38] yes you'll need him to survive it
[1:49:42] but he's gave us a rule book
[1:49:45] and if we just do all we need to do in
[1:49:47] the rule book then we can just say hey
[1:49:50] it's like if you were a kid upstairs
[1:49:52] you'd say did you feed the calves you
[1:49:53] say yep I fed them everything's fine
[1:49:55] like the cap his head shot and dies they
[1:49:58] didn't think the kids fault they fed him
[1:50:01] that's how it is spiritual
[1:50:04] so did you do all my statues
[1:50:08] then it'll be fun
[1:50:11] amen
[1:50:13] God help the ones that aren't doing them
[1:50:17] God help them got to hold them
[1:50:20] there's no way they're going to say I
[1:50:22] didn't know
[1:50:24] God help him God help me
[1:50:27] amen it's actually what's humbling to me
[1:50:32] to know what I know about
[1:50:34] coming out of God
[1:50:36] and God actually asked in me and you
[1:50:40] permission
[1:50:42] or our counsel to make us
[1:50:47] and that same God would say if I didn't
[1:50:49] come quickly
[1:50:51] I wouldn't even be able to bring myself
[1:50:52] back to me
[1:50:56] oh

[1:59:17] that ain't coming
[1:59:20] that is law
[1:59:25] for all those that love your country
[1:59:33] wow
[1:59:36] wow
[1:59:38] and
[1:59:43] how do you how do you deal with that wow
[1:59:50] and two of the
[1:59:52] continents left in the world
[1:59:55] that are not this way
[1:59:59] continents
[2:00:02] continent of Africa
[2:00:06] and Russia
[2:00:12] if anybody was thinking of moving those
[2:00:16] would be two great places
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:21] I've seen a post
[2:00:24] from a judge
[2:00:27] in a country in Africa
[2:00:29] I'm saying this
[2:00:32] if I proof Ace and the judge had broke
[2:00:34] their constitution
[2:00:36] and I listened to about a dozen Jared
[2:00:38] listened to him the people from the
[2:00:40] Senate
[2:00:42] the law writers of the country
[2:00:46] and they were going to force the judge
[2:00:47] to publicly repent and step down
[2:00:52] and the one person was saying that the
[2:00:54] West is trying to make us like animals
[2:00:56] and the Speaker of the House stopped
[2:00:58] them sits up
[2:01:00] he said I don't know any animals
[2:01:03] that act like that and he said you're a
[2:01:04] correct speaker
[2:01:06] I need to repent publicly to the Animal
[2:01:09] Kingdom
[2:01:14] the country in the continent of Africa
[2:01:18] and they compared
[2:01:20] these laws
[2:01:22] to the West
[2:01:24] or to North America
[2:01:28] Europe
[2:01:31] two places you don't want to live
[2:01:40] another prayer request we have
[2:01:43] to leave with you
[2:01:44] I'm sorry for
[2:01:47] leaving me with something like that but
[2:01:49] another prayer request we are praying
[2:01:51] for
[2:01:53] and most of my family know more about it
[2:01:55] I maybe will sit out we have a drawing
[2:01:58] here from Pastor Leo
[2:02:00] of a piece of property right behind the
[2:02:02] church
[2:02:03] with two houses on it and a bathroom I'm
[2:02:06] not asking you for nothing
[2:02:07] except prayer
[2:02:09] just just pray
[2:02:12] we have actually rented the one house
[2:02:15] for six months for the homeless family
[2:02:17] that was living in the
[2:02:19] Sunday school rooms
[2:02:22] and me and the land were just
[2:02:25] sitting there last night and it kind of
[2:02:27] hit me like a ton of bricks and I said
[2:02:29] something Luanne she said that it
[2:02:30] already hit me I said you know if
[2:02:33] something happens that we aren't able to
[2:02:34] buy this
[2:02:35] That Homeless family is going to have to
[2:02:37] come out of that house we just put them
[2:02:38] in
[2:02:40] so that would almost kill me
[2:02:42] I'd rather move out myself
[2:02:45] uh
[2:02:52] I did check with Leo Pastor Leo
[2:02:55] and he said they had miraculously been
[2:02:57] able to get a Triple Decker bunker
[2:03:01] that is a triple three high bunk beds
[2:03:05] made of steel
[2:03:08] and they had every person in their
[2:03:10] family was sleeping on a mattress
[2:03:13] most of them were new the three in the
[2:03:15] bunk bed the parents had bought a new
[2:03:17] mattress and they'd give their smaller
[2:03:19] one to one of the other kids
[2:03:24] Thrills my heart
[2:03:26] unbelievable
[2:03:29] but we're
[2:03:31] praying that something will happen
[2:03:34] the people are actually asking a large
[2:03:37] price but God can change the heart of a
[2:03:39] king he can change the heart of a couple
[2:03:42] kids amen but uh
[2:03:45] you say well what's the purpose in this
[2:03:48] I'm going to close with this
[2:03:50] there's two houses on that property
[2:03:53] so potentially two families could live
[2:03:56] there that are homeless by the church
[2:03:59] which would also make them caretakers or
[2:04:02] security
[2:04:04] for the church
[2:04:06] and they also is enough ground
[2:04:09] that those same two families could
[2:04:11] almost grow their entire living
[2:04:16] off the ground
[2:04:18] that would be purchased
[2:04:20] amen
[2:04:24] but we want God's world Amen
[2:04:28] and all that that's don't mean man if
[2:04:32] we're not to have it we want God to
[2:04:33] block it
[2:04:34] take it away
[2:04:37] but uh it seems like it would be good
[2:04:40] for the family of God
[2:04:42] in that area we also our long-term
[2:04:45] Vision the church is almost completely
[2:04:48] completed is our long-term vision is to
[2:04:50] put in regular standard
[2:04:53] while not quite North American bathrooms
[2:04:56] but almost with showers in the center of
[2:04:58] the floor so the sisters and the
[2:05:01] brothers could use a regular bathroom
[2:05:03] that didn't smell
[2:05:06] and they could literally shower
[2:05:09] in a regular shower
[2:05:11] at the church
[2:05:16] let's pray Lord Jesus
[2:05:19] we love you with all of our hearts Lord
[2:05:21] Jesus just thank you for your presence
[2:05:23] and anointing and thank you for the
[2:05:25] beautiful people that are here Lord
[2:05:27] Jesus be with our fellowship after and
[2:05:29] anything that we do this day may we just
[2:05:31] meditate and think on these thoughts
[2:05:33] Lord Jesus
[2:05:35] your name we pray amen
[2:05:38] thank you
