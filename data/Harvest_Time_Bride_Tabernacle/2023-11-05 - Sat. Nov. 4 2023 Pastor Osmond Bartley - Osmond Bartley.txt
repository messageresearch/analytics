people Lord may be so insignificant in the highs of this country in the highs of the world Lord but we are your elect we're choosen before the world was Lord that we'll be here and Lord I Thank you for our pastors that are here Lord standing in the place of their Duty Hallelujah Lord for the work of the ministry Lord for the edifying of the body of Christ and for the perfecting of the Saints Lord Jesus may you continue to anoint them Lord as they know their positions every person here Lord I'm just grateful Lord that you were able to bring us together for this purpose father bless us the songs were just great Lord and for those at home Lord that are tuning to the service and those that are coming I pray Lord for a mighty blessing on their lives and their surroundings Lord as we yield ourselves tonight for your purpose in Jesus Christ's name we pray can you say amen amen amen I just want to read from Dr Luke's writing uh chapter 18 amen and verse just one verse there and we're just going to take a thought tonight and I was just there in the pastor's office and glan over and I stole forgive me for you I stole it one of his notes it's so in line with what the Lord want to speaking so you know we we know we as preachers we like to steal each other's notes you know sometime you're preaching and them it'll get a few things so you know it's like that you know so forgive me I I'll return it yes I will return it after I'm finished but he he he place it there that I get it so I just got to read it it's in line with what the Lord want and amen and and here Jesus after he was actually talk can you hear me clearly right I tell you the engineers are great at the back they did wonderful work amen and so Jesus was talking about the the the the Widow the widow woman and and the the judge and all of that but I just pick from this from Luke 18:8 the second part of it is actually what stand out to me and to us tonight and Jesus said I tell you that he which Speaking of the father look at verse seven actually and shall not God avenge his own elect which cryed day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily yes sir but this is the thought jumped out of us nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth it's powerful when the sh of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth it's a question the Lord bless you be seated glory to God so so you know uh um uh as I was there uh talking about faith if we could pull a thought tonight and I and I'm going to say a few things because we started last night on change of the Dynamics that was great from God I believe it change of the Dynamics now we want to talk about a leap of faith a leap of faith Saints and it is good and humanly to believe what happened yesterday and it is so common for us to looking forward for what's going to happen that's right but it's so hard for us to have faith for what's happening now believe it it's so hard to take the God out of history and make him be present we talk about it we sing about it oh we we we recite the quotes and we we we dance around it but when it comes to making the word become effective it's missing it's missing and we you know we are people that believe the word we are people that have gotten the absolute word we are a people that know how to study the word I can Bo about that glory to God but we need more than just that we want to see the word in its full effect is that right sense of God I'm not just satisfied to hear about my Prophet did this to hear what my Prophet said I'm not just satisfied to hear amen of the god of Abraham what he did and Jacob and we talk about him we're going to talk about him again but I want to see my God working among amen the people here Oh Glory to God I want to see some sick Hill I want to see people delivered I want to hear some testimonies of what God is doing in your lives hey glory to God Amen praise be to God Amen and so you know this is the one I I I me jumped out of me you know the prophet says in the message now amen jarus and the Divine Healing I believe that's where they come from and he said the devil is trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere else saying some of these days you will be this but you are now you are now we are sons of God we are now seated in heaven Heavenly places now listen to script we have all powers in heaven and earth now glory to God hallelujah we have it now not in the Millennium we won't need it then we got it now now if you have something now I want to see here hallu so last time we talk about change of the Dynamics and you know the prophets talk about the the the the this text that I wrote talk about faith Jesus said when I come shall I have shall I find Faith he said in the message angel of God 1951 he said when I return will I find Faith Jesus Jesus did not question glory to God he said did not question about sincerity or Christianity he said shall I find faith faith 1962 to take Hallelujah on the whole armor listen this talking about Matthew 16 commission he said that was the last commission Jesus gave Go in all the world and preach the gospel whosoever believe it and his baptized shall be saved he said that was the last commission Jesus gave he said these signs shall follow them that believe Oh Glory to God oh my do you [Music] believe do you believe this is for you in my name they shall consult Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it won't hurt them if they lay hands on the sick oh God hallelujah if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover he ask when I shall I find Faith he never said I find righteousness will I find a church will I find a people he said I want to find faith glory to God I want to find Faith now there is nowhere in the word amen or amen that tells me that this power has left the church there was no in the word that tell me healing of the sick is of the minor Don't Tell Me Oh Glory to God that God coming this last day and remove the gifts out of the church Hallelujah a True Church of God possesses the gifts of God and that's the church that's going in the Rapture that's the church up back upon the original Oh Hallelujah Shake must be healed people must be delivered eyes must be open that's the True Church of God in operation but back to the book of Acts he the Bible said in Romans 1:17 for therein is a righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith from Faith to Faith we are growing the aisle we goes is the more the pressure increases because we're going up we're not going down but don't worry our father knows he can trust us he POS he put in us what we need to resist the pressure is that right he knows what we're going to encounter the higher you go in the word is more pressure you experience glory to God Hallelujah so we we progress from Faith to Faith to Faith amen remember our Father Abraham amen oh God sh the test to Abraham the Bible says in Genesis 22 he said God tempted Abraham so when he said Abraham leave your father's place that was a test Abram believed God is that right oh when it come for Abram to get a son or to get a child that was a test so Abram was growing from Faith to Faith Can I preach this church we're talking about a leap of faith tonight woo how I feel the anointing of God Amen but then there was another level of God was bringing Abram higher then God to Abram take your H son and offer him up as a sacrifice that's another level of Faith oh Hallelujah is that right the are you go in your in your understanding is unless you question the word of God hallu because you're growing you don't question God some you know sometimes God will tells you what if God tells you to write a book some of us we're waiting for God God to give us the paper can I preach God give me the paper you're waiting for God to you the pen and then you know what some of us take it further we have the pen and the paper we want God to hold our hands and describe their words where is the leap of faith faith is a revelation faith is a revelation oh Hallelujah when God said to my father Abraham take your only son up a place I'm going to show you and offer him up as a sacrifice the procedure Abraham know it bring him up there and kill him and burn him that's the procedure he never question it because he had already grown wo hallelujah oh glory to God he takes a leap of faith Amen to put the wood on your son's shoulder he takes a leap of faith amen when your son ask you papa I've seen the wood I've seen the knife I've seen all the mechanics laid out where is the Lamb woo God never showed him the lme but a leap of faith I'm going to stand there and he said amen the Lord shall provide himself amen the L the mechanics has changed we don't just want to sing about it we don't just want to jump over the quotes and dance because the prophet said it we want to see it in action it takes a leap of faith to activate your purpose within the change it's changed I'm I'm not asking if it's changed it takes a leap of Fai to activate your purpose within the change and I said last night I'm going to read it back is that right when I said last night the prophet said cl to God in the message when talking about the the sons of God and the pillar of fire all right when he said in the message the eager n 1960 April 1960 he said the pillar of fire the life of it what does it produce it's not me now can you move it away from the man and see God it's not me now he said the same works that it's de that mean the Christ did did when it was in the Son of God he said now it's in adopted Sons and Daughters of God oh glory to God can some of us see ourselves in this can some of us look in the mirror of the word come on sisters look in the mirror of the word amen sisters look in the mirror of the word Brothers look in the mirror of the word he said now that same spirit that same power amen that was here hallelujah amen that called the names of the persons and tell them where they were it was the spirit of Elijah can you say amen and that same Spirit of Elijah amen call it not robbery for me but I believe that same Spirit must must be in the church Hallelujah that same spirit is in me today you preach like that somebody saying you're trying to be like the prophet the gift of discernment operating the churches you're trying to to be like the Prophet The Prophet said it's not him it's Christ he said the same Christ is in us people speaking in tongues today and the interpretation comes over oh amen people frightened people prophesy today oh God and churches want to close and that's a part of the ministry fre come on Hallelujah I'm not talking about pretending I'm talking about the genuine presence of the Holy Spirit where is God again in the churches we become formal and cold and Powerless oh I'm not lecturing people I want to bring you to understanding I want to bring you to remember who you are you are sons and daughters of God you are filled with the same Holy Ghost Hallelujah glory to God the gifts were placed in the church by almighty God and they are still in the church thank you for your Liberty brother Dale Hallelujah I never trou thousands of miles to come to Wyoming to remind you that God's in a prophet if you never know that you are too late I'm here to remind you that you need a leap of faith to activate your purpose within this change Hallelujah when there was a time when there was just one man the pillar of fire was over but he said no it's in every one of us each and every one of us we cannot place it on one person we cannot place it in one location it's in me it's in you doing the same Works glory to God Amen so we started so now look at it the spirit of Elijah was on Elisha is that right doing the same Works what good would it have done to Elisha if Elisha traveling around the world around the country telling everybody God did send Elijah I'm preaching to you today can I preach you can still say Amen sir so that wouldn't be a Ministry amen so if Elisha had the clo had the mantle walking around Samaria walking around Jerusalem reminding everybody God sent a prophet God did send Elijah you know what I tell people if God need me to tell people now that he sent a prophet that mean God never did his work properly God don't need me to tell you he sent a prophet God sent a prophet to the age and when he he could not live until his mission was accomplished I'm going to have a good time up here he could you cannot leave here until your purpose is complete W God hallelujah amen God s a prophet yes amen I'm not going to tell walk around and say God s a prophet God is s a prophet do you know God s a prophet no no no I've got a purpose I've got a purpose and I shall activate that purpose with a leap of faith I want to lay my hand on the sick oh Hallelujah I want to see the dead raise I going to change this body hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now so let's go back to Jacob turn over to the Book of Genesis 31 the stuff we always look at Jacob as a trickster and a Shyer brother Bram call him a supplanter that's good but there is something about it that you know it's it's kind of long but I need you to get the substance ofday it's all right thank you get the substance of it you want on all the thing that he was doing he was being he was inspired that's interesting he was inspired so we call him we said he was tricking the man he was inspired God so here the word of God says let me let's go through it sely now and he heard the words of flaming because I know what lay you know with his father-in-law they took out all the he the Rams and all that you know and left the pure ones so it's impossible for you to get so much but hey God God is good I told you before you remember you know Jesus was on the cross Satan said we got him now but that grain of corn fell to the ground it produce more we are Messiahs we are sons of God he has to deal with last night I I make mention to you about war tomorrow by the gra of God who may deal with that because you got to have war on your mind the whole world is in war the prophet taught you he said what you see happening in the world in the natural he said God is do it in the spiritual Satan is just a copycat sure if there is war all over the world it's there is war hello there is war going on then what about us we just sit in church and having a good time praising the Lord I want to go home to rest come on church is going on war is on us let's read he mean and he heard the words of laban's son saying Jacob had taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers had he gotten all his glory oh Lord Jesus the higher you get there's the more pressure you come under Hallelujah and Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban and behold it was not towards him as before amen and the Lord said unto Jacob returned unto the land of thy fathers and of thy Kindred and I will be with thee and Jacob sent and called Rachel and lay her to the field unto his flock and Sh unto them I see your father's countenance it is not towards me as before but the god of my fathers at being with me it's not me is Goden I like that oh and you knew that with all glory to God all my power I have served your father and your father ha deceived me and changed my wages 10 times but God suffered him not to hurt me look at this church and he's if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle be speckled and if he said thus the ring straight shall be the higher then Bear all the cackle ring strike thus god listen this thus God had taken away the cattle of your father and gave them to me I never tricked him glory to God hallelujah you see there verse 10 listen he said and he said it came to pass at the time that glory to God that the cattle conceive that I lift up my eyes and saw in a dream and behold the Rams which leap upon the cattle were ring straight speckled and Grizzles I saw in a vision glory to God hear what he says I saw in a vision Rams leaping up he never see Pop stick he never see the Asian nut or the chestnut trees is sure Hallelujah is sure the ram which were not there can I preach up oh glory to God is after those Rams were taken out the same day the agreement was made did I read it last night yes you read it in Chapter 30 the father-in-law made sure that wasn't possible glory to God hallelujah my God hallelujah so Jacob saw something that was not there in a dream but something inspired him to let that dream come to pass something inspired him it takes a leap of faith Amen to step into your Revelation it takes a leap of faith to bring your vision to pass it will take a leap of faith Amen to take your dream and bring bring it into reality it will take a leap of faith Amen to take that which is not written to bring it to pass oh Hallelujah some things will not be written but they are real it takes a leap of faith Amen to step into the reality woo Oh Glory to God the prophet of God told us he show up the seven ters Ed in Revelation 10 it's not even written in heaven that's he said if it was written Satan would have grabbed it run ahead amen and make avoc of it it's not written how will you catch it he said in the seven tunders amen the lies Rapture in [Music] faith it's not written how will you get it amen you got to go home is that right you're looking for the Rapture you're looking for the Rapture you cannot read your way home you got to LEAP into that Faith woo Hallelujah it will take a leap of Fai for the rap M Rapture is not a train that God is going to invite you to up on up on on the train upon on the train of rapture Rapture is a Ministry Rapture has to be manifested when the prophet said Rapture is in progress because we're being changed we're being changed from glory to glory we are being changed woo I want to preach it so bad we start ready the change already what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is we are experiencing a resurrection it takes a resurrection to bring forth this life amen whoa Hallelujah glory

follow me Church let's jump over to when Christ descent as a mighty Angel Hallelujah with one foot upon the sand one foot upon the sea oh Glory God the first time brother John saw the rainbow was around the throne for God so loved the world is that right rainbow represents a covenant of Life a covenant of life but this time he saw Christ coming back with a rainbow around his head amen it's personal this becomes personal you know Christ is selective Christ is selective St John 17:6 John 17:6 while he was praying he said father these are day that you gave me out of the world thine they were and you gave them to me verse n I'm praying for them I'm not praying for the word what is it he shift the Covenant the dimension changes when he came back Revelation 10 he pulled the rainbow from around the throne he brought it with them for his wife his wife I give you life I give you life you pass from dead to life Hallelujah I give you life for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife and they both become one we are not one flesh but we become one Spirit 1 Corinthians chapter 6:17 he that is joined to Christ is one Spirit you are united with Christ

you Ministry that has being empowered upon the wife of Christ understand that prophecy is not just about open your mouth it's about your life it's your life it's the life brother Jose didn't have to open in his mouth I felt the atmosphere around it brother John didn't have to say hello but the the magnetic field was so charged around him as he pared me on the chair I felt even my feet trembled what is he talking about what is he talk you mean I'm talking reality the Bible said when Elisha died and Oh Glory to God and his bones were in a Tob his bones were in a Tob there was a war one time and the soldiers had their their comrade running a dead man and the they thrw me not open too it was the bones of Elijah the bones of Elisha is that right Elisha God Almighty amen and as the man
