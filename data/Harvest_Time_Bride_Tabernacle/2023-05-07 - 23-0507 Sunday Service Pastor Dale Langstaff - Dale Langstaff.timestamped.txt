[29:49] mother
[29:50] without descendant having neither being
[29:54] a beginning of days

[30:51] Angel unto his servant John who bear

[31:10] these things which are written therein
[31:13] for the time
[31:18] is definitely at hand Lord Jesus we ask
[31:22] that you would just add the blessing to
[31:25] your beautiful word this morning and
[31:27] Lord we know that the bride of Christ is
[31:29] here assembled this morning because they
[31:32] brought their Holy Ghost licks of fire
[31:33] lord Jesus and we feel we're in your
[31:37] presence Lord Jesus from the worship
[31:39] service and we ask that you would bless
[31:41] your bride here Lord Jesus and we pray
[31:44] Lord Jesus you know the many different
[31:46] ways you could go on this topic multiple
[31:49] different ways Lord God we just want to
[31:51] go the way you want to go this morning
[31:53] Lord Jesus that I pray you'd preach to
[31:56] me Jesus

[32:00] more perfect today as you minister to
[32:03] your bride of Christ this morning and
[32:05] you're in beautiful name we pray
[32:07] amen
[32:09] amen God bless you this morning
[32:11] as you're seated amen we see here that
[32:14] you know we mentioned many times we
[32:17] preached on different topics like this
[32:19] amen and so many people have their
[32:22] opinion and uh
[32:24] thoughts on who God is amen and and
[32:28] that's that's good as long as it lines
[32:30] up with the word of God Amen but but I
[32:33] want to read you something that uh well
[32:35] I'm just going to go to the end this uh
[32:38] I want to read you a quote from the
[32:39] Hebrew series and and I I tell you where
[32:42] this thought came from you know we went
[32:43] to the friend of luance that was a
[32:46] funeral and uh you know uh like Luanne
[32:50] was in her realm she these were people
[32:52] she knew more than me and I'm sitting
[32:55] back and looking at
[32:58] the brother in the casket
[33:01] and I'm looking at his grandkids he had
[33:04] four generations going up saying goodbye
[33:07] they're their daddy
[33:09] and and how Grandpa and great grandpa
[33:13] I was kind of looking at pictures with
[33:16] the great grandson
[33:21] and my mind was
[33:23] racing
[33:26] about this life
[33:28] and and what's it all about
[33:30] you know we say goodbye and we're so sad
[33:33] but
[33:34] this is life and you know the prophet
[33:35] said
[33:37] he said when you're born when you have a
[33:40] baby that's death
[33:43] you've entered into your death
[33:46] that's amazing amen
[33:49] when we're boring we come here on Earth
[33:51] and it seems so real
[33:54] but it ain't real at all it's a shadow
[33:57] and a type of the real and we've left
[33:59] our real body and our real me and this
[34:01] ain't me and this definitely ain't you
[34:02] and and but we get so caught up in the
[34:05] use and the means
[34:07] but it ain't even the using the me's
[34:08] because it ain't even us amen and I said
[34:12] God like I'm I'm almost confused and
[34:15] help me and
[34:16] and
[34:19] wow
[34:22] and you know
[34:24] you know in the natural and I'm not
[34:27] following my notes at all but you know
[34:29] in the natural
[34:30] anytime a body
[34:33] is entered into another body in the
[34:35] natural
[34:36] if you have surgery and you take
[34:37] somebody else's
[34:39] whatever
[34:40] the doctor
[34:42] will give you antibodies
[34:44] or Auntie because your body naturally
[34:47] will fight it
[34:50] your body will completely refuse it to
[34:52] attack it and kill it and everything
[34:55] and you know the prophet said I just
[34:57] that's just physical the prophet said in
[35:00] just so many ways to preach this message
[35:01] he said in every Revival
[35:03] Jordans were born
[35:07] he's on Jacob
[35:10] Jesus and who betrayed him I forget the
[35:14] Judas
[35:16] they were believers
[35:21] it's a different appetite
[35:24] and I'll tell you this morning that if
[35:26] you came from Genesis 1 28
[35:28] and when God made Man In His Image
[35:31] if you were part of that God making you
[35:35] you're definitely going to have an
[35:37] appetite of God that it's just it's just
[35:40] it's just black and white science that
[35:42] is a physical impossibility for you not
[35:44] to have an appetite of God when you are
[35:46] God
[35:49] because your theophany was built in God
[35:51] you know we're going to look into this
[35:53] so much but uh
[35:55] it's just God even made the theophany of
[35:59] this theophany of God was when he made
[36:01] his son Jesus and you know in the world
[36:03] the world the denominations they're
[36:05] thinking that we got three Gods up there
[36:07] we got the father and we got a son and
[36:09] we got the Holy Ghost and somebody came
[36:11] to brother Brown and it was it was it
[36:13] was just beautiful How uh brother
[36:16] Branham that was he said brother Branham
[36:18] he said I'm coming to to straighten you
[36:19] out on your doctrine of the godhead you
[36:22] know I had uh I had somebody uh from a
[36:25] denominational Church put a comment on a
[36:27] friend of mine from Africa and he said
[36:29] you know that brother branham's a
[36:31] Doctrine on the godhead was was uh
[36:34] uh almost heresy
[36:41] is so deceived
[36:44] you're so very deceived because this
[36:46] person he said he said well hey brother
[36:47] Bram said he said well definitely I want
[36:48] to be straight no to the word of God so
[36:50] help me out and he said well you know
[36:52] and the godhead there's three
[36:54] personalities
[36:56] you know watch our prophet he was just
[36:58] amazing he said
[37:01] can you repeat that
[37:04] he said well like you know the
[37:06] theologians in our church and you know
[37:08] the denominations of we know that the
[37:11] godhead
[37:12] three personalities to prophecy
[37:15] could you repeat that
[37:18] and he repeats that and he said could I
[37:20] ask you where you learned that from and
[37:22] he said oh I learned that in seminary
[37:24] Bible school he said well I'm not the
[37:26] least but surprised
[37:28] but he said you need to go back to your
[37:30] science book and he said you know you
[37:31] can't have a personality without being a
[37:34] person
[37:35] and every individual person has its own
[37:37] individual personality and the
[37:39] personality always goes back to one
[37:42] single person
[37:44] my personality is completely different
[37:46] than anybody person in here
[37:50] so guess what
[37:52] even science proves that there's one God
[37:54] because there was one personality
[37:57] love for you
[37:59] amen hallelujah is it a god it's just
[38:03] amazing who's Christ but see we get so
[38:05] wrapped up back to we get so wrapped up
[38:07] in these bodies you know and we hang
[38:09] pictures up like this and pictures of
[38:11] our prophet and pictures of the pillar
[38:13] of Fire
[38:15] on our Prophets
[38:18] that's all death
[38:20] he said Jesus now that you're gonna have
[38:23] to hold your seat belts on this one he
[38:25] said Jesus body
[38:27] In the Flesh brother Matt
[38:29] was no different than horse
[38:34] I have a quote my iPad
[38:36] no different a horse or a cow or a dog
[38:39] he said it was 16 elements of cosmic
[38:42] light and all these things that came
[38:43] together and it was just flash period
[38:46] period
[38:48] and that flesh is definitely not sitting
[38:51] in heaven because the Bible says the
[38:52] Flesh and Blood don't inherit the
[38:53] Kingdom of Heaven God just had oh it's
[38:56] just amazing he said see when when the
[38:59] Three Angels Came to Abraham he said
[39:01] literally God just God came out in his
[39:04] theophany and he said he literally just
[39:06] grabbed the elements and threw 16
[39:08] helmets together and stepped into a body
[39:10] and walked up and he said no to the
[39:13] Archangel he said Gabriel he said come
[39:14] over here he said whoa whoa step in that
[39:17] and he said I might go Angel he said
[39:19] step in there
[39:21] but I don't want to we'll do it anyway
[39:25] and he said they walked right up to
[39:27] Abraham and flesh bodies and they said
[39:29] it doesn't matter what the picture was
[39:31] that Abraham was looking at he said he
[39:32] didn't recognize the flesh
[39:35] Jesus hadn't even born yet
[39:37] and Abraham didn't hang pictures in his
[39:39] tank they didn't stick to the studs
[39:44] but he said they're Supernatural always
[39:46] recognize this the spiritual always
[39:49] recognizes the supernatural and he said
[39:52] there was just there was just oil in
[39:55] Abraham that blended with the oil and
[39:58] the angel and he said that's God
[40:00] it had nothing to do with flesh because
[40:03] when God disappeared he just dropped the
[40:05] Flesh and went right back up to heaven
[40:11] and he said it was exactly the same with
[40:13] Mary when Jesus was born and married he
[40:16] said sure he came through the Virgin he
[40:18] just pulled the 16 elements together
[40:20] dropped it in her room and was born as a
[40:23] baby it didn't have nothing to do
[40:25] nothing absolutely nothing to do nothing
[40:29] to do
[40:30] was flesh
[40:36] the same God came in the pillar of Fire
[40:38] To The Burning Bush to Moses the same
[40:40] God claims the pillar fire when Israel
[40:42] left Egypt and he stopped them that day
[40:43] was the same God that came in the cloud
[40:45] to lead him in the daytime it was the
[40:48] same God that came down in our day and
[40:51] west
[40:53] exact same guy
[40:56] God is the spirit
[40:58] and all those that worshiped him must
[41:00] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[41:04] he said if you were and in the beginning
[41:07] God said and I preached this in Africa
[41:09] and it's just the place blew up but he
[41:11] said God said to you
[41:13] because you were in God he said you we
[41:16] know this and I preach this and I said
[41:18] it makes me very happy to preach this
[41:20] but if you're going to live eternally if
[41:22] you think you're getting to heaven and
[41:23] you're going to stay there forever then
[41:24] you always were there and John you know
[41:27] I'm just not even looking at my iPad but
[41:29] John 3 13 says that if you're ever going
[41:33] to go to heaven that first you ascended
[41:34] from heaven amen and when you came from
[41:37] the theophany of God
[41:41] you were little different than Jesus
[41:44] you are but little
[41:47] see Jesus was God
[41:50] and you were God's expression
[41:56] first God thought about brother Dale and
[41:58] then he spoke it into existence
[42:02] amen and there is no way if you ever see
[42:05] a Christian doing something I know you
[42:07] could stumble and fall because this
[42:08] flesh is weak but the spirit is willing
[42:10] but if you see a Christian with an
[42:12] appetite for evil
[42:18] they're a twin
[42:21] it's just it's just it's impossible for
[42:25] God to reject himself if if if if I want
[42:30] a blood transfusion and I go if I'm
[42:32] gonna have a big surgery and I don't
[42:33] want to take somebody with hypothetics
[42:36] blood I can go and give my own blood and
[42:39] put it in the fridge and they'll start
[42:41] and when they put that back into me
[42:44] it's me
[42:47] me won't reject me
[42:51] God is the word and God became flesh and
[42:53] dwelt among us but God is in the word
[42:56] and if you are rejecting one respect one
[42:59] Speck of the word if you have trouble
[43:01] with one Speck of the word
[43:05] you weren't part of Genesis 1 28 God
[43:07] made man
[43:09] and woman together
[43:11] and one person in His image
[43:16] because it's just physically impossible
[43:18] for God's antibodies to reject God
[43:22] in the same God
[43:24] amen and I don't mean that it's sinful
[43:26] to hang up pictures of of Jesus or a
[43:29] prophet not but when you get to heaven
[43:31] I don't mean to disappoint you
[43:33] but brother Matt don't look for that
[43:34] picture
[43:38] you're not going to have done Jesus by
[43:40] that picture
[43:47] because that's not how
[43:49] our Prophet said that Abraham identified
[43:52] him when he came to the angels look at
[43:54] the difference between Abraham and lot
[43:57] my lords
[43:59] he was a Baptist
[44:08] wow
[44:11] that's why a Christian
[44:13] when this is a shadow and a type
[44:15] oh wow
[44:18] you got to be careful getting too
[44:19] wrapped up with this world because this
[44:21] world needs it on our homes
[44:22] we might go through seasons in our life
[44:24] where I went through a season where I
[44:26] got carried away with that
[44:28] God will definitely bring you up short
[44:33] amen
[44:34] we are living
[44:36] a lie
[44:38] because this ain't real
[44:40] matter of fact our Prophet said we're
[44:41] probably going to get into a battle and
[44:42] slow down so much on such Deborah he
[44:44] said you have to die to see the real
[44:50] he said because this is a negative and
[44:52] he said you can't even see the picture
[44:53] of brother Dale until I die
[44:59] oh
[45:01] so Lord just come and take me home
[45:06] amen
[45:08] he said we know
[45:11] here's the people knowing that Jesus was
[45:13] the devil
[45:15] because he said before Abraham was
[45:18] I am
[45:20] and they said
[45:22] they're like
[45:24] you're just 50 years old
[45:29] you imagine God putting up with idiots
[45:36] here he's he's Elohim
[45:38] the beginning no beginning
[45:42] yeah yes 50 years old
[45:45] and they need to go back to school for
[45:46] longer
[45:47] and he said unto them he said before
[45:49] Abraham was I was and he said he said
[45:52] who
[45:54] was the I am
[45:56] he said the
[46:00] he said he was a pillar of fire the
[46:02] burning bush he said I am that I am he
[46:04] said there he was and it's the often he
[46:06] formed there and he said he was called
[46:08] the Son of God the I am the Jehovah
[46:11] Hallelujah God showed us he said here
[46:14] Thomas came up to him and he said he's
[46:16] Thomas they're walking with Jesus on
[46:19] Earth and he said Jesus said we would
[46:20] like to see the father
[46:26] wow I preached all those years and
[46:28] that's all you got out of it
[46:30] just thought
[46:32] he said you know I've been using that
[46:34] long
[46:35] how long 50 years
[46:38] he said if you've seen me you've seen
[46:40] the father
[46:42] this is in the Hebrew series the great
[46:44] great messages to watch it brother Brown
[46:46] talks a lot in the Hebrew series about
[46:48] your theophany talks about it thousands
[46:51] of times and then he comes in before he
[46:52] dies
[46:54] and choosing of a bride and who is this
[46:57] my cousinik and it's just loaded with
[47:00] who you really
[47:01] your theophany
[47:03] amen and here he says he says what
[47:06] happened
[47:07] do that five minutes before here Jesus
[47:09] was the logos now now when the Bible
[47:12] calls Jesus God making his logos brother
[47:15] branham's own words was he said we call
[47:17] that the theophany so when God sent
[47:19] Jesus out in his logos that was his
[47:22] theophany there was no you could have
[47:24] said God sent me out in his logos
[47:27] we just logos another word for Easter
[47:30] that's that's what the prophet said
[47:35] amen
[47:37] and
[47:39] how our bodies were made of six
[47:40] different 16 different elements
[47:43] and uh oh he talks about sorry just what
[47:45] I said there now here here he goes he
[47:47] said boy he said you can glory in this
[47:50] flesh
[47:51] you you boy you can glorify in this
[47:54] flesh but the spirit has a soul in there
[47:57] and my brother that's right he said but
[47:59] your flesh is just the dust of the earth
[48:01] like an animal your flesh is no more
[48:04] than an animal and he said if you just
[48:07] uh if you just lusted after the flesh or
[48:10] the things you see after women or the
[48:11] other things the difference he said it's
[48:13] still animal he said that's right he
[48:15] said that's right he said you shouldn't
[48:16] do that the spirit of God will lead you
[48:18] to higher places and not exactly right
[48:21] he said now there's the great theophany
[48:24] standing there he's talking about
[48:25] Jehovah God before he went to Abraham
[48:28] amen
[48:30] I'm just trying to find out
[48:38] and he said here he said you know the
[48:41] two angels they came and we know they
[48:42] drunk the Flesh and drunk Malek and ate
[48:44] the Flesh of the calf and all that he
[48:46] said he said
[48:48] now when they came to Abraham and when
[48:51] Jesus came
[48:52] God sent him out from him and it's
[48:55] theophany
[48:57] but the ones that ate flesh I wasn't
[48:58] their theophany
[49:01] because see often he can't eat meat he
[49:04] can't drink it's a spirit
[49:07] and so God literally when I remember I
[49:09] said when he brought the angels together
[49:11] and that they had to step out of their
[49:13] theophany and step into flesh and that
[49:16] was God in flesh and then he stepped
[49:19] right back out of the flesh laid the
[49:20] flesh down
[49:21] and went back to heaven in his theophany
[49:25] oh it's beautiful amen
[49:33] Hallelujah
[49:35] but what I wanted you to get was that
[49:37] are these bodies are no different than
[49:39] animals there was another one where he
[49:40] said we were the same as a horse or a
[49:42] cow or different things but this here
[49:44] all this was just flesh and you see
[49:47] people worshiping the Flesh of even
[49:49] Jesus Christ
[49:52] The Flash was just flash
[49:55] it was just it was just I mean yes
[49:59] Abraham fell down to worshiped him it
[50:00] was just flesh when the flesh was here
[50:03] and man it was just now all it was was a
[50:06] 9 16 trench for God to take a bolt off
[50:09] and as soon as he was done with it he
[50:11] put it back on the Shelf
[50:13] God so he would need to look at it
[50:17] that'll help us look at each other and
[50:19] every situation different we don't
[50:22] wrestle against flesh and blood but of
[50:23] both principalities
[50:26] powers in high places amen here here and
[50:29] pulling away the armor of God he said
[50:30] and you think of a mother's love and now
[50:35] there's a paragraph paragraph 220 he
[50:38] said in the whole armor of God he said
[50:40] no you think of a mother's love now but
[50:42] God said that a mother might forget her
[50:45] baby
[50:47] but I can't forget you see
[50:49] he said your name is engraved in the
[50:52] palms of my hands and he said he loves
[50:55] you he said don't worry about it he said
[50:57] he's taking you
[50:58] his word just to keep it on
[51:02] amen see we we you know you know you may
[51:05] love your your wife or your husband or
[51:07] your mom or your dad or all that but
[51:09] that there that love that you have for
[51:11] each other is a fallen love it's a
[51:13] filial love and it seems so real and so
[51:16] powerful and and amen in the right realm
[51:20] it is
[51:21] but the prophet said he said you know
[51:23] see if you had somebody mistreat your
[51:25] wife in The filial Love realm you would
[51:27] take him out
[51:29] but in the agape love you would go to
[51:31] prayer meeting and pray for his soul
[51:34] and so you know without even answering
[51:36] the question they said what realm are we
[51:38] dealing in
[51:39] most of the time on Earth
[51:42] you got help brother death
[51:45] because you know
[51:48] this seems so real
[51:51] but it's so not real
[51:54] Amen in Revelation 10 1-7 you know we
[51:56] talked about the mighty angel coming
[51:58] down and and he put his foot on the land
[52:00] of the sea and and you know we know that
[52:02] that in the end times that all the
[52:04] Mysteries would be revealed and I'm just
[52:05] going to read the last prophet but in
[52:07] the days of the voice of the Angel when
[52:09] he shall begin to sound all the
[52:12] mysteries of who is Jesus Christ
[52:15] the revelation of Jesus Christ all the
[52:18] mysteries of God shall be finned he says
[52:20] as he declared it to his servants
[52:22] the prophets
[52:24] amen before you go on a Rapture this
[52:27] morning you're going to have to know
[52:29] who Jesus Christ is you know this
[52:31] brother that came to the Bro the prophet
[52:33] told him about the the godhead had had
[52:35] three personalities brother Branham told
[52:37] him but he finished that story he said
[52:39] well you can only receive this
[52:42] by Revelation he said well oh no he said
[52:44] I wouldn't accept that by Rubble he
[52:45] would accept the priest from his church
[52:47] oh my goodness
[52:48] he would have preached his Bible School
[52:50] Doctrine over Revelation and brother
[52:52] Brown looked at him he said
[52:55] say that again
[52:57] I don't know if he did in that part he
[52:59] said the Bible says without faith no man
[53:02] conceived God and faith is revelation
[53:05] you say I won't accept the godhead by
[53:07] revelation
[53:09] like some some some so-called Christians
[53:12] they say the dumbest things out of their
[53:13] mouths it's just unbelievable oh no I
[53:16] won't because I got to have something
[53:18] physical to see that well really well
[53:20] you got to get converted then
[53:23] because faith is revelation and without
[53:26] Revelation without faith no man can
[53:29] please God so you're not even
[53:33] my goodness you want to prove God you
[53:36] say you know like the prophet said to
[53:38] the man he said you you have a wife he
[53:40] said but you love her he said we'll
[53:42] prove it he said I want to buy some of
[53:43] that love but how much is it in the
[53:45] store prove it
[53:48] you can't see
[53:50] some things are just by facing man
[53:53] Hallelujah in the natural we're in the
[53:55] flesh
[54:00] amen
[54:02] and you're in this you know we couldn't
[54:04] take on somebody else's body
[54:07] but here here here we got so many people
[54:09] professing to be Christians
[54:11] and they're taking on Antichrist spirit
[54:14] in almost everything they do
[54:17] he said it's it's physically
[54:21] scientifically impossible
[54:27] the Bible says
[54:28] that God said
[54:30] Esau
[54:32] have I hated
[54:34] Jacob
[54:37] I don't hate it God hate it
[54:41] he wasn't a part of that theopathy
[54:44] when God made in Genesis 8 1 28 amen God
[54:49] help us God help us
[54:52] amen Souls that are in prison he said
[54:53] the mysteries of the Seven Seals he said
[54:55] when the Seven Seals were open he said
[54:57] it opened the entire
[55:00] Bible
[55:01] he said the Seven Seals it was with the
[55:04] seven Mysteries and the Seven Seals held
[55:07] the entire mystery
[55:09] of it all
[55:12] and also the book of redemption
[55:14] for the New Testament
[55:17] amen
[55:18] God help us he said and we already said
[55:21] this if a person's Eternal you're always
[55:23] eternal
[55:24] amen and this Aztec here here you know
[55:27] you say well who was this Melchizedek
[55:30] that came down and looked like a it
[55:31] looked like a
[55:33] you know somebody say well you know
[55:35] Abraham called him
[55:37] uh recognized him as God because he paid
[55:40] them ties
[55:42] and in Hebrews 7 4 it talked about he
[55:45] was a person
[55:48] but then when he was done that Journey
[55:49] he just laid down that person
[55:52] amen God all the time Christ was the
[55:55] fullness of God revealed in our day
[55:59] Hallelujah First Timothy
[56:03] 6 15-16 he said which is in times past
[56:07] and his times past he showed who he
[56:10] would bless only
[56:12] uh
[56:15] the king of kings and Lord of lords he
[56:17] said who only hath Immortal dwellings in
[56:19] the light which no man can approach unto
[56:22] he said whom no man has seen nor can see
[56:25] and to whom be honor and Power
[56:29] Everlasting talking about who God is and
[56:32] yet you know in our in our day in our
[56:35] day we want to put a picture up of
[56:37] somebody and every religion in the world
[56:39] they got to hang a picture
[56:41] a picture
[56:42] but it's a picture of a fallen state
[56:47] watch this
[56:49] watch this
[56:51] and we're going to go into that next
[56:52] week even in Jesus Christ's name okay
[56:55] case it was a phone state
[56:59] our Prophet said that
[57:00] he said it just like this he said Jesus
[57:03] was flesh
[57:05] Christ was Jehovah God in it
[57:07] that's a direct quote the direct quote I
[57:10] have it in my death do I quote amen see
[57:13] see God had to pay because of God's law
[57:16] he had to pay the Redemption for sin and
[57:19] and watch this it was it was he was he
[57:23] he was redeeming you it wasn't even you
[57:25] that did it
[57:28] and we're going to get into that in
[57:30] Revelations because you were Justified
[57:31] and and you say well how's that
[57:33] explained he said well that was what G
[57:35] brother Brown told the story of the pawn
[57:36] shop
[57:39] the rightful owner didn't have the
[57:41] person in the pawn shop
[57:43] and Jesus came and Justified you or
[57:46] redeemed you out of the pawn shop and
[57:49] come back to the owner that you were all
[57:51] along see there's crud in a pawn shop
[57:54] that people pick up on the side of the
[57:56] road
[57:57] they mad
[58:02] the pawn shop didn't really own it
[58:05] and Satan definitely don't own you and
[58:07] so Satan's trying to take your flesh and
[58:10] use your flesh but he don't even have
[58:12] ownership
[58:15] oh my God help us in this day to stand
[58:18] up
[58:19] for Who We Are
[58:21] it's by revelation
[58:23] and you'll know by revelation
[58:26] by your appetite by your desires it
[58:29] won't be by your mistakes you'll still
[58:31] make mistakes because you're Tabernacle
[58:33] you're trapped in flesh
[58:36] trapped in flesh
[58:39] and you might make a hundred mistakes a
[58:41] day but your desire
[58:44] is better
[58:48] and only you and only you and God Alone
[58:50] know
[58:51] whether that's truly desired to change
[58:54] or be more perfect
[58:57] amen
[58:59] Hallelujah
[59:00] but a person that was made in the image
[59:03] of God here's here's God I just loved it
[59:05] I I mean it's the greatest the greatest
[59:08] phrase you could ever make but here's
[59:10] God in Genesis 1 28 he says he's talking
[59:13] to you and he says let us you're part of
[59:17] the US make you flesh
[59:21] but I'm going to make you in my image
[59:25] and when okay and when he finished that
[59:27] sent that that verse brother Mike
[59:30] where I wasn't made in this body
[59:35] and what God was saying is I'm going to
[59:37] take you from I'm going to take you from
[59:40] me and make a body but it can't be seen
[59:44] that's what he said you can't see us
[59:46] theophany
[59:48] it's invisible it's a spirit but it was
[59:51] a body and that's why and it was a male
[59:54] and female body is a masculine and
[59:56] feminine Parts we're both in this body
[59:58] that was invisible except to God
[1:00:04] and your theophany may be invisible to
[1:00:07] these good old eyes
[1:00:09] but if you have a connector inside which
[1:00:11] will pick up the the ways of the Holy
[1:00:14] Ghost It's Not Invisible to the
[1:00:16] spiritual eye amen because blood and
[1:00:19] water don't mix and when you just come
[1:00:20] together amen it's just it's just
[1:00:22] something it's just a glue it's an
[1:00:24] unseen positive magnet that is
[1:00:29] let's go
[1:00:33] there's nothing you can't see nothing
[1:00:36] oh man
[1:00:38] glory be to God Amen it's beautiful amen
[1:00:41] it's theophany who you are
[1:00:43] your theophany
[1:00:45] come from God Amen there's so little to
[1:00:48] do with this you know our our funeral
[1:00:50] services I mean
[1:00:53] we should be
[1:00:56] I know we're Tabernacle here
[1:00:59] but we should almost be wishing it was
[1:01:01] awesome
[1:01:03] instead of crying over our loved ones
[1:01:06] you can't comprehend the Bible says
[1:01:10] how amazing
[1:01:16] see that was the original that's the
[1:01:18] picture
[1:01:19] and this is really blurry
[1:01:23] wow
[1:01:26] Hallelujah the revelations the the whole
[1:01:29] Bible is a revelation of God and there's
[1:01:31] no other way
[1:01:32] to know God Only by Revelation to whom
[1:01:35] the son will reveal here here's here's
[1:01:38] here's the Bible breaking it all down
[1:01:40] and and the religious person just miss
[1:01:43] it completely whom the son will reveal
[1:01:46] him
[1:01:47] and it's hid from the wise and the
[1:01:49] prudent
[1:01:50] but by Revelation he'll reveal it unto
[1:01:54] the theophany the logos the low guys
[1:01:57] that God spoke out of himself was your
[1:01:59] theophany
[1:02:05] there don't have to be a lot of
[1:02:06] revealing there because it's the same
[1:02:08] ocean
[1:02:11] amen same water
[1:02:13] amen it's the amorph faith of God the
[1:02:17] Greek word the the word of God in morphe
[1:02:21] means change or to change the mask and
[1:02:25] the prophet tells the story of this he
[1:02:27] said my daughter was in a a play in the
[1:02:30] Victoria Playhouse would just say it
[1:02:31] like that or what he didn't obviously
[1:02:32] mention that name and he said he said
[1:02:34] there was a Felix in the playhouse and
[1:02:37] he played he was popular and really cool
[1:02:39] him and Iliad and they played multiple
[1:02:41] parts
[1:02:43] and so one time they would come out and
[1:02:44] they were the king
[1:02:46] next time they come out and they were
[1:02:47] the beggar
[1:02:51] something for me
[1:02:52] the king of kings
[1:02:56] came to be a bagger in a barn there
[1:02:59] wasn't even a room for him in the end
[1:03:02] but it was exactly an identically the
[1:03:05] exact same feeling to know you
[1:03:07] the exact same person
[1:03:09] he was saying in this place he said that
[1:03:11] person played three different parts in
[1:03:12] the play but it was exactly the same
[1:03:13] person and the Amore of God was just
[1:03:16] changing his mask
[1:03:18] or a change he said God the Father God
[1:03:20] the son was not three gods and we know
[1:03:22] this of course we know this but it was
[1:03:24] three acts of one God
[1:03:27] and there you have his God
[1:03:30] the Bible being revealed in the last day
[1:03:33] so here he he mentions this and who is
[1:03:36] this Melchizedek he said God in more
[1:03:38] faith was the pillar of Fire
[1:03:42] God and morphe was Jesus
[1:03:46] it's going to shock you but God in more
[1:03:48] faith
[1:03:50] is the bride today
[1:03:52] the bride of Christ
[1:03:55] it's God above us our Prophet said that
[1:03:58] by the way
[1:03:59] and who is this mycosidic paragraph 43
[1:04:02] he said it's God above us it's God in us
[1:04:05] and God With Us the all-consuming god
[1:04:09] spirit of God
[1:04:11] you know I I would I would you know like
[1:04:13] I've said you know if you get married
[1:04:15] and not you're going to take pictures of
[1:04:16] your wedding now but be careful with the
[1:04:18] picture thing
[1:04:20] spiritually speaking
[1:04:22] don't get too consumed with pictures
[1:04:25] I mean clouds are nice and fires are
[1:04:27] nice you want to see who God is put a
[1:04:29] fire picture up
[1:04:32] you want to see who God is put a picture
[1:04:34] of clouds up nice puffy clouds
[1:04:40] because people are putting God in a box
[1:04:44] says that my God don't come like this
[1:04:45] and he don't look like this and he don't
[1:04:47] act like this
[1:04:48] but then it can be my God
[1:04:51] and to that part they're right it's not
[1:04:54] their God
[1:04:57] because God is Elohim and God comes in
[1:05:00] many hundreds of thousands of different
[1:05:03] forms you say how's that possible Bible
[1:05:06] promised that in this day he would have
[1:05:07] a many-membered bride the second Eve I
[1:05:11] would not fall amen many membered bride
[1:05:16] and that's Elohim
[1:05:18] and he's oh how are you going to put
[1:05:19] them pictures up
[1:05:22] that's that's God that was that was a
[1:05:25] logos of God that he said in Genesis 1
[1:05:27] 28 that the prophet said we call our
[1:05:30] theophany
[1:05:33] Hallelujah
[1:05:37] amen thank you Jesus amen I gotta put on
[1:05:41] my glasses to read this quote
[1:05:43] and who's this Melchizedek
[1:05:46] paragraph 48 he said you'll notice here
[1:05:48] tonight that eternal life was with him
[1:05:50] in him and in his thinking
[1:05:54] it was all eternal life
[1:05:55] and before there was ever there was an
[1:05:58] angel or a star or a cherubim or
[1:06:01] anything else it was
[1:06:03] eternal
[1:06:04] amen and if you have eternal life
[1:06:07] tonight
[1:06:09] you always was not your being here not
[1:06:12] this flesh this wasn't
[1:06:15] but the shape and form
[1:06:18] of that infinite God
[1:06:21] me in you
[1:06:23] said if you were Eternal if you are
[1:06:25] Eternal you always was not this not this
[1:06:28] clay don't hang the picture up with
[1:06:30] brother Dale because you're not going to
[1:06:32] see the god
[1:06:37] because the prophet said that your
[1:06:40] theophany
[1:06:42] it's invisible
[1:06:47] you don't wonder why the twins can
[1:06:51] persecute
[1:06:52] the other twins
[1:06:55] because they can't see it
[1:06:58] you wonder why they can't recognize the
[1:07:00] revelation of Jesus Christ Revelations 1
[1:07:02] 1.
[1:07:03] and they see three Personalities in the
[1:07:06] same Jehovah God is because
[1:07:09] there were twins
[1:07:14] wow
[1:07:16] he says he's coming in already he said
[1:07:17] he isn't
[1:07:20] and if he isn't infinite God then he
[1:07:23] isn't God
[1:07:25] he said
[1:07:28] he was omnipotent and all these things
[1:07:31] he was and he said if he isn't then he
[1:07:34] can't be God he's all-knowing all the
[1:07:36] places because he's all these things
[1:07:38] amen and God
[1:07:41] he's like the wind he's he's a being
[1:07:43] he's he dwells in a house
[1:07:46] being
[1:07:48] omnipresent omnipotent knowing all
[1:07:51] things makes him omnipotent present
[1:07:53] because he knows everything
[1:07:56] that's going on he said he watches he
[1:07:58] goes into this I don't even say this
[1:08:00] like this is the kind of God you're
[1:08:02] serving he said he said if a fleet he
[1:08:04] says it's right in this paragraph he
[1:08:05] says if a flea bites his eyes so you
[1:08:07] you've got a dog or cat that house he
[1:08:09] knows a number of the hairs on that dog
[1:08:11] cat he knows how many if it's got fleas
[1:08:14] but he knows how many fleas is God and
[1:08:16] he knows how many eyes he's biting when
[1:08:17] the fleas are biting their eyes
[1:08:19] and he knew that before you got the pet
[1:08:23] because that's the kind of God we see
[1:08:26] and yet you have churches and churches
[1:08:29] and churches actually I don't know any
[1:08:30] churches other than Believers that
[1:08:33] actually even believe in predestination
[1:08:36] you tell me one you tell me one
[1:08:38] organization
[1:08:40] the teachers and preachers
[1:08:43] predestination and yet I can't read the
[1:08:46] Bible in a daytime in devotions and not
[1:08:49] see predestination election called
[1:08:52] chosen uh are you with me brother
[1:08:57] how can they read and there's a chosen
[1:08:59] elected called the the
[1:09:03] hello
[1:09:04] what Bible are they reading what version
[1:09:07] are they reading
[1:09:09] talk about Revelation they don't even
[1:09:12] have understanding of English
[1:09:19] to win
[1:09:25] wow
[1:09:27] and that's the infinite God that we
[1:09:30] can't comprehend this this is a quote
[1:09:33] this is the infant God that we can't
[1:09:35] comprehend in our minds
[1:09:38] and this part I'm adding
[1:09:40] and so we try to build a picture and put
[1:09:43] God in a box
[1:09:46] and hang them on the wall
[1:09:51] wow
[1:09:53] or we put them in a casket
[1:09:55] say what a great person that flesh was
[1:10:00] but it ain't even me
[1:10:03] I don't want people to come and look at
[1:10:04] the something that ain't me
[1:10:07] why does somebody want to look at a
[1:10:09] negative that's not even clearly me
[1:10:13] I know I know what you're thinking I had
[1:10:15] all those thoughts too
[1:10:21] you know what if we get where God wants
[1:10:23] us to get we won't be nowhere for the
[1:10:25] good brother man
[1:10:26] we won't be I think I walk around it's
[1:10:29] so different for me and I I can only
[1:10:31] preach about me or things I know but you
[1:10:34] know brother Bernard I used to dream
[1:10:35] about you know I'll have an Empire you
[1:10:37] know I'll do this and I'll lay this out
[1:10:40] and I I go in those same buildings down
[1:10:42] I'm just like
[1:10:48] and I come in the house and I'm like
[1:10:50] what happened
[1:10:52] I'm like
[1:10:58] because
[1:10:59] if we were in that
[1:11:01] plan
[1:11:03] if we were part of that Genesis 1 28.
[1:11:06] all this here stopped is getting farther
[1:11:09] away
[1:11:11] we're I'm still walking by it I still
[1:11:13] like your Pulpit brother Tim
[1:11:15] but it's getting farther away
[1:11:18] I think
[1:11:22] it just don't have the same thing to it
[1:11:26] because
[1:11:28] it it's not even
[1:11:31] real
[1:11:34] that's crazy
[1:11:36] I mean that's crazy I sit and think
[1:11:37] about that all week and I'm like looking
[1:11:40] in the scriptures and like I went into
[1:11:41] the softening and stuff and literally
[1:11:44] some of this some of the verses had like
[1:11:47] almost 100 quotes to I couldn't read
[1:11:49] them all brother Matt you know what I do
[1:11:50] I scroll to 65 and start backwards
[1:11:55] I fall asleep reading quotes from one
[1:11:58] verse
[1:12:01] and then I try to I try to I have like a
[1:12:04] wheelbarrow and I try to put that all
[1:12:05] together and go that's physically
[1:12:07] impossible
[1:12:09] nobody could make
[1:12:12] because that's a god
[1:12:14] that we serve
[1:12:15] and that's the thoughts that God had of
[1:12:17] you man it's it's it's amazing amen
[1:12:23] and if you wasn't in his thinking
[1:12:26] there's no way absolutely if you wasn't
[1:12:29] in Genesis 1 28
[1:12:32] . there's absolutely no way
[1:12:36] that you're going to be there
[1:12:41] remember how the scriptures read not him
[1:12:44] that willeth nor him that runeth but God
[1:12:49] we call Delaware
[1:12:52] and so we're living our life brother
[1:12:54] Matt
[1:12:55] around people
[1:13:02] by Revolution
[1:13:04] and discernment
[1:13:09] wow
[1:13:13] revelation
[1:13:16] I remember your dad talked about the
[1:13:18] sermon brother Matt
[1:13:21] sermon
[1:13:23] reckon that being able to see a
[1:13:25] theophany sister Patricia
[1:13:28] it's not with these eyes
[1:13:30] your sister Patty amen anyone
[1:13:34] okay
[1:13:35] it's like
[1:13:38] that was kind of
[1:13:39] you know you ever see somebody brother
[1:13:41] might say that was kind of weird
[1:13:44] but it was never ever the same
[1:13:47] logos
[1:13:48] you never walk up to God if you're if
[1:13:50] you're a child of God you're never going
[1:13:52] to walk up to God and say that was kind
[1:13:54] of weird
[1:13:56] are you kidding
[1:13:59] that's the same material
[1:14:01] and so we got Believers doing Believers
[1:14:04] Believers doing things that
[1:14:07] and going places that
[1:14:10] and wearing things at
[1:14:13] the logos couldn't wear
[1:14:24] or persecuting
[1:14:26] the logos that the logos would never
[1:14:29] persecute
[1:14:33] for
[1:14:34] you know the plans that I have for you
[1:14:37] these aren't just Earthly plans to
[1:14:39] prosper you for all of eternity
[1:14:42] How Could You persecute that
[1:14:45] huh
[1:14:46] twins
[1:14:52] literally 20.
[1:14:55] wow
[1:14:59] First Timothy one here and I'm this is a
[1:15:03] repeat brother Brown I'm quoting to some
[1:15:04] of the thing but first Timothy 1 to 3
[1:15:07] and 16 you can pull this up I don't
[1:15:08] believe I read this other than through
[1:15:10] the prophet said without controversy
[1:15:12] great is a mystery of godliness it's
[1:15:14] definitely a mystery most people have no
[1:15:16] even in the ranks of the message
[1:15:22] or was manifest God was manifested in
[1:15:24] the flesh handled to hands eaten the
[1:15:26] meat got eaten meat God drank God slept
[1:15:29] God cried and God Came Down In the Flesh
[1:15:31] and he died in Christ and so that he
[1:15:34] could redeem us back to the Flesh and
[1:15:36] that's why God had to be a man in the
[1:15:38] first place to fellowship and to be
[1:15:41] worshiped see God had to be a man
[1:15:44] for two reasons
[1:15:48] number one it had to be a Kinsmen
[1:15:51] Redeemer
[1:15:53] oh that's beautiful
[1:15:55] whoa it had to be one of us brother Matt
[1:15:58] to pay the price for one of us
[1:16:01] so God couldn't pay the price he didn't
[1:16:03] qualify
[1:16:05] but he's God
[1:16:07] and so he made the qualifications
[1:16:11] by just going
[1:16:13] there was Jesus
[1:16:14] thank you very much Mary thank you for
[1:16:17] your contribution to the
[1:16:21] that's unbelievable
[1:16:24] and then see God couldn't die and I've
[1:16:28] had message people attacked me on this
[1:16:29] it's all right
[1:16:31] it makes no difference to me at all
[1:16:34] they said well if if Jesus flesh wasn't
[1:16:38] God then
[1:16:39] then our sins aren't paid for
[1:16:43] but anybody with a hair brain would know
[1:16:46] that God can't die
[1:16:48] because then he wouldn't be God
[1:16:53] I love a prophet he says the only the
[1:16:57] second reason that Jesus had to come in
[1:16:59] a body
[1:17:00] God had to come in the body called Jesus
[1:17:04] was first to be our Kinsmen Redeemer and
[1:17:07] second is it's impossible for God to die
[1:17:15] it's also impossible for God
[1:17:19] to sin
[1:17:21] and Jesus Took the sins of the world
[1:17:24] and the prophet said that when Jesus
[1:17:26] gave up the goat
[1:17:28] that day
[1:17:30] Elohim the theophany of God
[1:17:35] you ready you believe the prophet it
[1:17:38] left him
[1:17:39] because God
[1:17:41] couldn't
[1:17:43] be sin
[1:17:49] so our God
[1:17:51] completely Hoodwinked Lucifer
[1:17:59] oh that's just crazy good
[1:18:06] Satan said you know Satan was trying to
[1:18:09] kill all the prophets and the apostles
[1:18:10] down Through the Ages because he knew
[1:18:12] Jesus was going to come he knew God was
[1:18:14] going to come and try to be a kinsman
[1:18:16] redeemer and pay the price for sin and
[1:18:18] see Jesus and Satan's a king and he
[1:18:20] don't really want to give up the throne
[1:18:21] you know he
[1:18:22] uh-huh
[1:18:24] but
[1:18:25] but he's gonna have to give it up but so
[1:18:28] rather so he was killing all these
[1:18:31] babies
[1:18:32] anybody that looked like God he just
[1:18:34] John any of those people just get the
[1:18:37] king to you know kill the babies under
[1:18:39] three or two or
[1:18:41] uh-huh you're getting the picture
[1:18:43] and he looked at Jesus and he looked at
[1:18:46] Jesus the
[1:18:50] Satan looked at that and he goes
[1:18:53] no no God wouldn't God wouldn't stand
[1:18:56] there I know God knows no way God has to
[1:18:59] take that
[1:19:00] and then he looked at Jesus when they
[1:19:03] spit in his face look you don't think
[1:19:06] Satan's looking at that brother man I
[1:19:07] guarantee he was looking at that he had
[1:19:09] his binoculars looking at that
[1:19:11] he was looking to see if his his
[1:19:13] countenance changed
[1:19:16] if if his damir change brother man he
[1:19:19] was just looking see
[1:19:24] Jesus because if Satan would include in
[1:19:28] that God was Jesus
[1:19:31] he wouldn't he would have just stopped
[1:19:34] but he would have top pilot in the floor
[1:19:35] and said buddy let him go give them
[1:19:38] Barabbas
[1:19:40] but he he looked today
[1:19:43] yes
[1:19:44] this is the Elohim
[1:19:47] the infinite
[1:19:50] in more faith no no no yeah there's no
[1:19:53] way he'd take that
[1:19:57] and then Jesus went to the cross
[1:20:00] to pay the price for brother Dale
[1:20:02] and all the theophanes the all the logos
[1:20:05] that he spoke in in Genesis 1 28 all the
[1:20:09] logos he spoke to him he went to the
[1:20:11] cross for that and when he was dying
[1:20:13] there Satan had no clue what was God
[1:20:16] and because he said well God can't be
[1:20:18] sin and then
[1:20:20] and then the Lo the theophanes the the
[1:20:23] logos of God right when Jesus is ready
[1:20:25] to take the sin and die he leaves them
[1:20:32] and then
[1:20:34] when he resurrected he went down to Hell
[1:20:38] he said hello Lucifer
[1:20:44] I'm here
[1:20:48] I said no
[1:20:50] no
[1:20:52] no I'm not answering that door
[1:20:54] there's no way I mean
[1:20:58] he said
[1:21:00] he's the death
[1:21:03] go ahead and tell you something brother
[1:21:04] Matt our Prophet said when I was
[1:21:06] studying this week
[1:21:07] he said
[1:21:08] God
[1:21:11] took all you know when a bee stings you
[1:21:13] and it blows out their back end and they
[1:21:14] can never sing again normally they die
[1:21:19] spiritually
[1:21:22] the devil
[1:21:24] Badness
[1:21:25] he just stung somebody he's a dead man
[1:21:28] he can just go over there and flutter
[1:21:30] because he's a dead man
[1:21:33] and God took that stinger
[1:21:36] tabernacled in the flesh
[1:21:39] and he can
[1:21:40] never
[1:21:42] ever
[1:21:44] watch this I know you don't you're not
[1:21:46] going to believe this I can just tell by
[1:21:47] your accent our prophecy brother Brown
[1:21:51] he can never
[1:21:53] touch
[1:21:54] your flesh again
[1:22:02] because this is your stinger
[1:22:06] it's gone
[1:22:08] it's gone it's gangan it's ganga you
[1:22:11] don't have two
[1:22:13] it's completely gone
[1:22:16] he said here and we're like
[1:22:28] wow
[1:22:33] guy 46 who is this monkey in the
[1:22:35] beginning God dwelt alone and his
[1:22:37] attributes and Assad teaching God was
[1:22:39] his thoughts amen and when he spoke his
[1:22:42] thoughts it became it became me and you
[1:22:45] to be king the word because see in
[1:22:47] Genesis 1 28 that had already been
[1:22:50] calculated in God's sights and now he
[1:22:52] speaks it
[1:22:53] but it wasn't about it yet
[1:22:55] it was just the Elohim of God the
[1:22:59] theophany it was a body but it was an
[1:23:01] invisible body
[1:23:03] oh I'm just crazy about that amen
[1:23:07] it took another whole chapter in Genesis
[1:23:09] 28. God had to finish the the the the
[1:23:12] the the the the the creation got to
[1:23:14] finish the creation before he said okay
[1:23:16] I'll throw these 16 things together and
[1:23:19] I'll make
[1:23:21] Adam
[1:23:27] wow
[1:23:30] amen just so many quotes are not we know
[1:23:34] the Bible said Adam was lonely and God
[1:23:37] made him help make you know what the
[1:23:38] prophet said about that
[1:23:40] he said Adam
[1:23:41] was
[1:23:42] a flesh being in Genesis 2
[1:23:45] about halfway down when God actually
[1:23:47] made the Flesh and Eve was still
[1:23:49] tabernacled in him and he said Eve's
[1:23:52] theophany
[1:23:53] was around Adam
[1:23:58] yep
[1:23:59] that's why he said
[1:24:01] when he fell
[1:24:03] Adam knew exactly what he was doing to
[1:24:05] redeem her
[1:24:06] it's just like Jehovah God knew exactly
[1:24:09] what he was doing when he had to be a
[1:24:12] Kingsman Redeemer
[1:24:14] to change his mask
[1:24:16] and go from the king of kings and Lord
[1:24:19] of lords where they have no elections in
[1:24:21] heaven the only King of Kings and the
[1:24:24] only Lord of lords there ever is ever
[1:24:26] will be and ever has been
[1:24:28] to become a beggar
[1:24:31] he knew exactly what he was doing
[1:24:35] and you know why he did that
[1:24:38] oh buddy
[1:24:40] because your theophany
[1:24:42] was around Adam
[1:24:45] it was around God and
[1:24:48] oh
[1:24:51] boyzone boyzone boys
[1:24:54] oh this is
[1:24:57] man you should try to study this kind of
[1:24:59] stuff and you're just like oh
[1:25:01] God
[1:25:04] amazing Jehovah
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:10] we never want to be and we always have
[1:25:12] been guilty of putting God
[1:25:15] in a box
[1:25:20] to all the people that have trouble with
[1:25:21] Pentecost
[1:25:23] they either want it or don't want it
[1:25:25] or you know what I mean or anything I
[1:25:28] always put God in a box
[1:25:32] God's gonna be for them God's going to
[1:25:34] be this way I got plans that God's Gonna
[1:25:41] and you can't even see the yellow end
[1:25:43] yeah yeah
[1:25:45] the
[1:25:47] oh wow
[1:25:52] that's expressed here and I'm sorry to
[1:25:54] rerun this in Genesis 1 26 he said God
[1:25:57] God said let us make man in our image
[1:25:59] and after our likeness and let them have
[1:26:02] dominion Dominion at that point
[1:26:06] and and the 27 we weren't even human
[1:26:09] being flesh then we weren't even human
[1:26:10] beings okay let me repeat that I don't
[1:26:13] think you got that God said let us make
[1:26:15] Man In His Image that's a god
[1:26:19] and we and the likeness of the god
[1:26:23] and let us be our God because we have
[1:26:29] Dominion
[1:26:30] who has Dominion of the world
[1:26:32] God
[1:26:33] but God said I had Dominion of the world
[1:26:38] what did God say to Moses he said why
[1:26:40] are you crying to me just speak it
[1:26:43] I gave you the commission
[1:26:46] what do you think he's saying to his
[1:26:48] bride right now
[1:26:53] my wife don't have to call me before she
[1:26:55] gets groceries we don't have a household
[1:26:58] like that
[1:27:00] praise God
[1:27:02] revelation's higher than that
[1:27:04] so you don't have to get me to sign a
[1:27:06] withdrawal form from the separate bank
[1:27:09] account
[1:27:10] a separate bank account
[1:27:12] it's a separate God
[1:27:14] anybody's got a separate bank account
[1:27:16] for the wife's got a trinitarian god
[1:27:23] it's all right if you do
[1:27:25] but
[1:27:26] you see what I mean
[1:27:30] and so this is Genesis 1 27 maybe you
[1:27:34] can pull this up Vicki and so God
[1:27:35] created man in the image and in his own
[1:27:38] image in the own image no we're not
[1:27:40] flesh yet
[1:27:43] and in the image of God he created he
[1:27:46] him
[1:27:48] male and female so let's put down all
[1:27:51] the sisters
[1:27:59] really
[1:28:01] that's disgusting
[1:28:04] you know my wife came to me privately
[1:28:05] when we were in Uganda and there was a
[1:28:07] person there
[1:28:09] always speak very much in disclaimer and
[1:28:12] uh and you know he would kind of like
[1:28:14] Get me get me
[1:28:17] I need water
[1:28:20] I need I need
[1:28:30] and here's the bride of Christ
[1:28:32] and she came to the Lord and she said I
[1:28:34] don't like that spirit
[1:28:37] like his wife wasn't president
[1:28:42] see
[1:28:45] in God's mind
[1:28:49] they work together
[1:28:51] they were not separated
[1:28:54] and for goodness sake they weren't lower
[1:29:02] and he created he him male and female
[1:29:06] created he god Jehovah God damn
[1:29:15] oh I understand we all have different
[1:29:17] positions I'm not Christ
[1:29:19] I'm not the prophet
[1:29:22] you know what I mean I wish there wasn't
[1:29:25] we're looking for a young pastor
[1:29:28] we just have different positions
[1:29:33] but not
[1:29:35] get me
[1:29:39] see the Bible says in James if we have
[1:29:42] respects for repersons
[1:29:44] that were guilty in this area
[1:29:47] that we're guilty of the whole law
[1:29:49] now watch us
[1:29:51] watch this I know you're not gonna like
[1:29:53] this and I'm I'm sorry ahead of time
[1:30:02] but when you put up a picture
[1:30:05] it's respects
[1:30:12] you know when you go to a big church
[1:30:13] meeting they take a picture of just the
[1:30:16] pastors
[1:30:18] but not the way
[1:30:26] but God created he them
[1:30:30] male and female
[1:30:32] I'm not saying it's sin I'm just
[1:30:36] twins
[1:30:37] you know what I mean
[1:30:39] yeah just watch that
[1:30:44] oh I know what the devil's telling you
[1:30:47] oh bless God the woman wasn't part of
[1:30:50] the original Creation in the flesh
[1:30:52] praise the Lord I'm above her
[1:30:56] that's a shadow
[1:31:02] that one Lucifer
[1:31:04] that ain't even the real
[1:31:07] Genesis 1 26-27 that's the real I'll
[1:31:10] take that one thank you very much
[1:31:12] uh
[1:31:15] -huh
[1:31:18] wait is that Bible
[1:31:20] the prophet said that that this flesh
[1:31:23] was a negative to the real and and when
[1:31:27] you are born as a baby didn't you just
[1:31:29] have any more babies when they're born
[1:31:30] they're dead
[1:31:33] I love holding dead babies
[1:31:36] except when they need a diaper change
[1:31:39] that's that
[1:31:41] but we're all excited
[1:31:44] and then watch watch out you had us this
[1:31:47] all wrong and I had it all wrong and I
[1:31:50] studied this ever since the funerals I'm
[1:31:52] sitting at the back and I'm looking at
[1:31:53] they had them high in the casket and you
[1:31:55] could see his whole body
[1:31:57] just almost from his toes to his
[1:32:00] I'm thinking
[1:32:04] we in our heads think
[1:32:06] babies born all that so I'll give them
[1:32:08] to brother Dale I love that
[1:32:11] you can't move and run away so I can hug
[1:32:14] him
[1:32:15] but then when I die
[1:32:17] we cry
[1:32:18] and when I die that's life that was the
[1:32:20] baby's born that's death
[1:32:26] wow
[1:32:33] how's this song go he said how sweet to
[1:32:35] hold a newborn baby
[1:32:37] but how much more
[1:32:39] that he'll face a world of sin
[1:32:42] uh-huh and heartache and death
[1:32:45] and pain
[1:32:47] a pain ain't part of God deathly amen
[1:32:52] this is completely the negative we're
[1:32:55] living in negative don't get uh
[1:33:01] if we have a funeral here before next
[1:33:03] Sunday and with me just go what
[1:33:06] where's on I was just born
[1:33:10] I went back to my original logos of God
[1:33:13] and I'll tell you what I'll be losing my
[1:33:16] mind that our Prophet said it'd be the
[1:33:17] noisiest place there so there'll be no
[1:33:19] Canadian Spirit there
[1:33:22] wow
[1:33:24] oh that's unbelievable
[1:33:27] but it's true
[1:33:29] questions and answers 57 and I got to
[1:33:32] stop sometime but questions answer 57
[1:33:35] paragraph 8 23. he said now when he the
[1:33:38] logos went out the watches just a quote
[1:33:41] and anybody can see this
[1:33:44] now when he's the logos one out of God
[1:33:47] it was God coming from one big Fountain
[1:33:51] into a body form of a man
[1:33:55] and it was the logos that we call
[1:34:00] our theophany
[1:34:03] so everything I'm telling you I gotta I
[1:34:05] definitely have a backup plan
[1:34:07] I've had people come to me and they say
[1:34:08] well you know I had people literally
[1:34:12] somebody I had people that didn't like
[1:34:14] what I preached and they went to other
[1:34:16] ministers as far away as Tennessee they
[1:34:18] said what do you think brother Dale got
[1:34:19] that from praise God that guy had some
[1:34:21] discernment he said did you ever think
[1:34:23] that brother Dale may be studied
[1:34:26] maybe it's maybe just possible brother
[1:34:29] Matt it's just possible so it would say
[1:34:31] hey say this and I said well what are
[1:34:34] you gonna do with this
[1:34:36] but he said well this I said what are
[1:34:37] you gonna do with this scripture and
[1:34:38] these quotes oh well brother Brown he
[1:34:41] was wrong in that area
[1:34:44] or the Bible he
[1:34:46] the Bible you know what he told me about
[1:34:48] the Bible
[1:34:51] this is true story
[1:34:52] brother Matt there's millions that have
[1:34:54] this feeling it was wrongfully
[1:34:56] interpreted
[1:34:58] from the Greek and Latin
[1:35:05] oh my oh my is right you know what
[1:35:10] twins
[1:35:14] Judas Iscariot

[1:35:18] when Jesus sent the disciples out he did
[1:35:20] the Miracles Judas Iscariot was with the
[1:35:23] disciples when they came back and they
[1:35:25] were rejoicing brother Matt rejoicing
[1:35:27] when the demons the Demons of the devil
[1:35:31] what this is this is crazy
[1:35:34] he was with the disciples when they were
[1:35:37] rejoicing when they come back to the
[1:35:39] Lord Jesus that the Devils were subject
[1:35:42] to him and he was a Devil Himself
[1:35:48] oh
[1:35:58] wow
[1:36:01] and those people
[1:36:03] sit in message churches
[1:36:09] or
[1:36:10] stay home

[1:36:32] God Jesus Christ the anointed one sent
[1:36:36] them out
[1:36:38] and they come back rejoicing to Jesus
[1:36:40] Christ
[1:36:42] Jehovah God and flesh
[1:36:44] that the Devils were subject to him
[1:36:48] and you know what he answered
[1:36:52] Rejoice rather that your name
[1:36:56] is in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:36:59] you know what
[1:37:01] he knew
[1:37:03] and he sure did know he sure did me no

[1:37:40] thank you you're read my mind a negative
[1:37:44] zero

[1:38:41] meaning for a part of another
[1:38:44] hymn it was a spirit
[1:38:48] with lots of different masks he had a
[1:38:51] stressor full of mouths my wife sent me
[1:38:52] upstairs she said yeah I said you know I
[1:38:55] got to look spiffy because she looks
[1:38:56] spiffy and I said what do I wear today
[1:38:58] and she said well maybe go to the second
[1:39:01] drawer in aisle three and get a vest and
[1:39:04] I pulled the drawer out and it could
[1:39:05] barely open because there were so many
[1:39:07] like so lack of clothes in there that it
[1:39:10] wouldn't even open and I came down with
[1:39:12] the wrong one and she said oh that was
[1:39:14] in drawer three down different you know

[1:39:54] a world that's gone completely insane
[1:39:56] that's what he said completely insane
[1:39:59] that you would actually still come to
[1:40:00] church on a Sunday morning and listen to
[1:40:02] the word of God
[1:40:04] with pleasure

[1:40:39] Union of Christ this is one month before
[1:40:41] the prophet died almost to the day 11
[1:40:44] 25. I'll read this quote and we'll shut
[1:40:47] her down you know I just brought
[1:40:49] just a couple papers
[1:40:54] I never read any of them
[1:40:57] they were out of the thousands
[1:41:01] you know
[1:41:02] in paragraph 122 he said you remember
[1:41:06] I mean I mean it'd be some reading and
[1:41:07] we'll stop in the highlights for a
[1:41:10] second but you remember when it went
[1:41:11] down
[1:41:13] the grain began to ripen you find that
[1:41:15] the grain can ripen and everything in
[1:41:17] the stock is has to die Hallelujah but
[1:41:20] you can see where we're standing life
[1:41:22] life is in the grain
[1:41:26] and this body
[1:41:27] is stock
[1:41:29] it's Jesus body
[1:41:33] was stock
[1:41:34] oh there's a thousand people that don't
[1:41:36] believe that
[1:41:38] but it's still a stock
[1:41:40] amen
[1:41:45] the life is in the grain just exactly
[1:41:47] like the same grain that went down on
[1:41:49] the ground the same Jesus in The Bride
[1:41:51] the same Jesus
[1:41:54] you don't believe that or you wouldn't
[1:41:56] even be in your seats the same Jesus in
[1:41:58] Bride form
[1:42:02] but Jesus was God
[1:42:05] and he just said and the same Jesus in
[1:42:07] brideport
[1:42:12] I'll let you finish that one
[1:42:16] the same power the same church the same
[1:42:19] thing the same word the same word sucked
[1:42:22] up through those and ages and came out
[1:42:26] here and came to a head here and all the
[1:42:29] life that went through here was picked
[1:42:30] up in his people the bride and now it's
[1:42:33] forming into the head for the Rapture
[1:42:35] speaking tomorrow night and he said
[1:42:39] he's I'm just going to skip a paragraph
[1:42:41] and go down he's just talking about
[1:42:43] now you're
[1:42:45] he said when you you when you got born
[1:42:47] again you were remarried again your
[1:42:48] spiritual union your your natural life
[1:42:50] in the world but eternal life is a germ
[1:42:55] that was given to you in the beginning
[1:42:57] none of this life body is just to prove
[1:43:00] to Satan that he'll have a bride in this
[1:43:02] age
[1:43:03] amen now your old book is gone and your
[1:43:06] your old Union meaning this book and now
[1:43:10] your name your names in the old uh has
[1:43:13] been transferred
[1:43:16] when he took you out of the pawn shop
[1:43:17] and God put it in the sea of his
[1:43:19] forgetfulness
[1:43:21] he's talking about you being redeemed
[1:43:22] here and he said and your name's in The
[1:43:24] Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life
[1:43:26] redeemed
[1:43:30] Hallelujah the the bride the new life is
[1:43:33] in the Lamb's Book of Life the marriage
[1:43:35] certificate it's the Eternal Gene the
[1:43:39] Eternal Gene from the beginning that
[1:43:41] takes hold when you were Justified
[1:43:44] Hallelujah Romans 5 1 you need to pull
[1:43:48] that out
[1:43:49] this isn't important this is a climax of
[1:43:52] the whole message Romans 5 1 yay Roman
[1:43:55] said they are being justified by faith
[1:43:58] what's Faith Revelation being justified
[1:44:01] by faith now if you look in the
[1:44:03] definition he's probably going to go
[1:44:04] into the but it's as if you he said I'd
[1:44:06] ever sinned brother Dale never sin this
[1:44:09] body say
[1:44:10] son sin
[1:44:14] but the the Me from Genesis 1 26 and 27
[1:44:18] it never did no send it now that was a
[1:44:20] little gossip Jehovah God it was a
[1:44:23] million miles from sentence
[1:44:25] and you look up the word here the word
[1:44:27] means it does doesn't mean forgiveness
[1:44:31] it means Justified that you didn't mean
[1:44:35] it doesn't mean you were forgiven for
[1:44:38] instance have you heard of me oh he
[1:44:39] talks about a story a drunk and he says
[1:44:43] if you've seen me and you thought I was
[1:44:45] drunk you say I forgive you he said now
[1:44:46] if I didn't do it
[1:44:48] if I did it I was guilty but you can't
[1:44:51] forgive me when I didn't do it
[1:44:55] but yet oh wow and the word justify is
[1:44:59] oh you never did it amen nobody has that
[1:45:02] Revelation but believers
[1:45:05] nobody
[1:45:06] it's not regarded at all how is it done
[1:45:10] in God's book
[1:45:13] the sea of forgetfulness your old book
[1:45:15] and marriage of divorcement and death
[1:45:19] is there and it's not even in the memory
[1:45:22] of God you're Justified therefore being
[1:45:25] justified it was accused
[1:45:28] you was accused and you never done it in
[1:45:31] the first place the old Union so look at
[1:45:34] this I want I want you to catch this and
[1:45:36] I promise I'm just finished it's Satan
[1:45:40] is the accuser of the brother
[1:45:42] but how come
[1:45:46] yeah
[1:45:47] that every one of us have had
[1:45:52] there's only one it wasn't God that
[1:45:54] accused you
[1:46:01] accused you've never done it in the
[1:46:03] first place the old Union's in the sea
[1:46:04] of forgot to forget unless he he wasn't
[1:46:06] married you wasn't married to it
[1:46:10] to begin with this this old flesh I was
[1:46:12] never married to this old flesh even
[1:46:13] though I'm I'm locked in this flesh it's
[1:46:15] not a part of me
[1:46:17] from the beginning he was the bridegroom
[1:46:19] born your shame he himself took your
[1:46:21] place
[1:46:23] and he predestinated you the bride the
[1:46:25] before the foundation of the world and
[1:46:27] the Bible says that you are
[1:46:28] predestinated seed how did how did you
[1:46:31] come to do this
[1:46:32] he said you just you were
[1:46:34] deceived into your first marriage you
[1:46:37] were deceived you had nothing to do with
[1:46:39] your first verse
[1:46:42] into adulterous parents like Eve it's no
[1:46:46] fault of your own it's no fault that I
[1:46:48] was born in the Earth
[1:46:50] there's no fault of your own but by the
[1:46:52] natural birth you came after Eve and who
[1:46:55] committed adultery and the reason you
[1:46:56] were born adulterous is you're a sinner
[1:46:58] to begin with
[1:47:00] this part of your body and you was
[1:47:03] deceived into it but it was no fault and
[1:47:06] it ain't your fault
[1:47:07] you never did it because the little germ
[1:47:10] that was in you was to be you before the
[1:47:13] foundation of the world and God put your
[1:47:14] name in the Lamb's Book of Life and like
[1:47:17] the little Eagle story
[1:47:19] uh I actually skipped this but he talks
[1:47:21] about the eagle and the farmer and you
[1:47:22] know the story about that he put an
[1:47:24] eagle egg under the chicken and and you
[1:47:26] know the ego just didn't feel at home he
[1:47:28] that's why he said like you got people
[1:47:31] going to message churches or doing
[1:47:33] things
[1:47:35] that that Eagles don't do in the chicken
[1:47:37] barnyard
[1:47:39] so if they're doing them
[1:47:42] they're chickens
[1:47:44] period

[1:50:16] and your accusers and you were accused
[1:50:19] of it by an accuser but really in the
[1:50:22] beginning you were predestinated
[1:50:25] I'm going to add this you were the logos
[1:50:27] the theophany
[1:50:29] you don't say that here
[1:50:31] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:50:34] of God and you're standing there

[1:51:16] these quotes just I'd say from memory
[1:51:17] you know he said God was not a slothful
[1:51:21] businessman
[1:51:22] he never left nothing to purchase
[1:51:27] well I perchance got a good church and
[1:51:30] perchance I got a good pastor per chance

[1:51:38] perchance
[1:51:41] no
[1:51:43] no
[1:51:45] no it was
[1:51:46] you are the logos
[1:51:49] of God
[1:51:51] which the prophet said we call our
[1:51:52] theophany
[1:51:54] but that's a key part I want to leave
[1:51:56] with you

[1:53:00] get the
[1:53:02] blessing
[1:53:04] but he gave it to Jacob

[1:53:11] education and Bible schools and by fancy
[1:53:14] big churches and gold platforms and and
[1:53:16] refined creatures
[1:53:19] that they're getting the blessing of God
