[3:41] Just the ones that might be still

[3:52] grandma right before her diraction.
[3:53] [clears throat]
[3:53] Her grandma waited till she got there.
[3:55] She died about 15 minutes after Julie

[4:06] for that of course. But uh they went
[4:09] down to the funeral. So they're actually
[4:10] driving home today.
[4:13] I told Jared, I said, "You know, it'd be
[4:14] no problem for you to be back in time
[4:16] for service." Cuz, you know, when they
[4:18] were dating, he used to be willing to
[4:19] leave at like 8:00 p.m. at night to
[4:21] drive to Quebec all through the night.
[4:23] And his eyes never even got tired when
[4:25] he was young. They just he just drove
[4:28] right straight through. And it was like
[4:29] he was already in the new body. But the
[4:32] new body, I think, got uh old.
[4:35] [laughter] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's pray.
[4:38] Lord Jesus, we love you and just count
[4:40] it a great privilege to be here, Lord.
[4:42] Lord, we thank you for all the ones that
[4:44] are here, Lord God. And Lord, just maybe
[4:47] be with the ones that are still uh
[4:49] coming in later on, Lord God, for
[4:51] whatever reason, Lord God. Just uh pray
[4:53] for them. And Lord, we thank you for
[4:55] Jared and Julie, safe travels, and even
[4:58] Julie being able to see her grandma
[4:59] before she died, Lord God. And Lord, we
[5:02] just thank you that they were able to go
[5:04] to the funeral and see uh so many of the
[5:07] family. Just a huge family. Jared said
[5:09] bigger family than our family. Couldn't
[5:11] believe how many aunts and uncles there
[5:14] was, Lord God. But we just thank you for
[5:16] her life, Lord God. And and Lord, we
[5:19] just pray for Sister Joanie, Lord God,
[5:21] just home really, really sick and
[5:23] feeling bad in the body, Lord God. We
[5:25] just we just put our faith with her,
[5:28] Lord God, and raise her up and and Lord,
[5:30] may you just take this this very bad
[5:33] feeling away, Lord God, and give her
[5:36] some rest and peace, Lord God. And Lord,
[5:38] be with our service, Lord God. And Lord,
[5:41] may your will be done and everything
[5:43] that's said and done here, may it be
[5:45] pleasing to you. In your name we pray.

[14:13] Let's just take our Bibles and
[14:17] turn to the scripture.
[14:24] Amen. Just maybe one announcement when
[14:27] we did it. Um Vicki helped me make a
[14:29] group text for the church. So it the
[14:33] text will be coming from Mayor Lannne or
[14:36] from my phone. Anyway, so if you get a
[14:39] text and you just send us thumbs up or a
[14:41] smiley face or something, we'll know
[14:43] that uh we're all still alive.
[14:47] Amen.
[14:49] Amen. Still got the messages. Amen.
[14:52] Amen.
[14:55] Let's go to Romans
[15:04] 18.
[15:08] Amen. Just so 18.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. Romans 11. I'm sorry.
[15:18] I know Vickiy's walking up my thing, but
[15:20] I'm just going to read one scripture.
[15:21] Vicki, I got more than that down here.
[15:23] But
[15:30] verse 18, boast not against the
[15:32] branches, but if thou boast, thou beest
[15:36] not the root,
[15:39] but the root
[15:42] of thee.
[15:45] Boast not against the branches.
[15:47] And if thou boast, thou boastst not
[15:50] against the root, but the root thee.
[15:55] Lord Jesus, I pray that you be with the
[15:57] ministering of the word, Lord God. And
[15:59] may you meet every shortcoming and every
[16:03] uh disappointment, Lord God, and every
[16:06] we take every spirit under our control
[16:08] in Jesus Christ's name. And Lord, may
[16:11] you just unfold yourself to us. we pray
[16:15] and the simplicity
[16:18] of preaching, Lord God. And we we pray
[16:20] that you'll be with all of us, Lord God.
[16:21] May I not say nothing that's outside of
[16:24] your will, Lord God. We pray to your
[16:27] people, your bride. They're not mine,
[16:28] Lord God. I'm Eleaser, Lord God,
[16:31] purchased by your blood, your life, Lord
[16:33] God, your bride, your wife to be, Lord
[16:36] God. We pray that you'll bless us in
[16:39] this small gathering today. In your name
[16:41] we pray. Amen. Amen. And you may have
[16:44] your seats.
[16:46] Amen.
[16:50] I want to
[16:52] God wants me, that's a better way to put
[16:54] it. God wants me to minister the next
[16:57] two or three Sundays
[16:59] on the seed of God
[17:01] brings the nature
[17:04] of God.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; The seed of God uh sorry,
[17:10] watch for a screen now.
[17:13] The seed of God brings the nature of
[17:16] God. And I am no way
[17:19] uh I you know you just have to trust me
[17:23] and if you can't trust me then you have
[17:25] to I don't know make another choice or
[17:28] something. But I I don't minister this
[17:31] because I got some kind of an eagle or
[17:34] or not at all. If I ministered anything
[17:37] outside of God's leadership, it would
[17:39] just be man's words. Amen. But you know,
[17:42] in the last couple months, God's dealt
[17:44] with me. I've had this in my iPad. I
[17:46] started this
[17:48] probably six weeks ago.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Probably six weeks ago. And you know,
[17:52] over this past summer after our camp, we
[17:55] went a few places and and uh and every
[17:58] church is sovereign and and we're we're
[18:00] not concerned about what other people
[18:02] do. Amen. But I heard visiting ministers
[18:05] say stuff that was blatantly off the
[18:09] word,
[18:11] like black and white, off the word. But
[18:14] I sat there, sometimes even on the
[18:16] platform and watched 200 people praise
[18:19] God
[18:21] because it was a visiting minister from
[18:23] another country.
[18:27] And so when I minister in the next
[18:28] couple weeks, I'm just going to let the
[18:31] Bible and the prophet
[18:35] tell you if I'm off.
[18:39] But I'll guarantee you that the seed of
[18:42] God that's going in the rapture will
[18:44] first have the nature of God.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; And it won't be a hotty spirit.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:56] Amen.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; It won't be a hotty spirit.
[19:03] It won't be I'm better than everybody
[19:05] else
[19:07] &gt;&gt; cuz those people are not going in the
[19:09] rapture.
[19:11] Maybe we should read verse 18 again.
[19:13] Boast not against the branches.
[19:17] But if ye boast, thou beest not the
[19:20] root. Who's the root? That's Christ.
[19:24] That's God.
[19:28] And I can't go to another message church
[19:30] or even have somebody hardly come here
[19:32] and preach without boasting. Well, bless
[19:34] God, we're the only ones. Bless God,
[19:36] we're
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Lord. I got one
[19:43] brother on my side.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; This is Romans.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; This is Paul. You know, I'm I'm going to
[19:51] say this, and this is this is a full
[19:53] sermon ahead of my plans on my notes,
[19:56] but if you know what we know and the
[19:58] revelation that's coming our day, and
[20:00] you've had the opportunity to to to
[20:03] listen to the message in your own
[20:05] language of brother Brandham, you should
[20:07] be loosening your mind with gratitude,
[20:13] &gt;&gt; but not boasting
[20:16] &gt;&gt; because I'm going to prove to you in the
[20:18] next 30 weeks
[20:20] or next three weeks, sorry, maybe the
[20:22] next 30. God dies. Uh that it will not
[20:26] just be message believers that know
[20:27] Brother Bram's name that are going in
[20:28] the rapture.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; I got Brother Brown said that.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Anybody's afraid to say amen.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; You don't even believe the message, let
[20:40] alone the Bible.
[20:42] Do you know that right now there's 52
[20:45] countries in the world that Christianity
[20:48] and the Bible is banned?
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Forget about what we call the message.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Do you know that a dozen countries in
[20:57] the world that you're shot on site
[21:00] executed firing squad
[21:02] &gt;&gt; if you're the Bible?
[21:05] &gt;&gt; And you think they're going to have to
[21:06] know brother Abraham's name to know
[21:08] Christ?
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Impossible. Amen.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Not because God's impossible and not
[21:16] because the message is not the truth.
[21:17] It's dad the truth. That's what should
[21:19] give us gratitude because we had the
[21:21] opportunity to know it. [music]
[21:23] You know the Bible that said this? The
[21:24] Bible said to whom much is given
[21:27] &gt;&gt; much will be required.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Let me rephrase that. To whom much is
[21:32] given in Wyoming church.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Forget your pastor. It don't have
[21:36] nothing to do with your pastor. You have
[21:38] the message on books. You have the
[21:40] message on CDs. You have the message on
[21:42] the internet. You have the to whom much
[21:44] is given
[21:48] &gt;&gt; and you make your own conclusion if
[21:50] you're worthy to what you've brother
[21:52] preached the things of thinking man
[21:54] filter. Are we worthy? Is your life
[21:56] worthy of this gospel? Are you is your
[21:58] life that's your own choice. Is your
[22:00] life worthy of what God's given you?
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:11] I'm I'm going to take my time because
[22:13] God wants us to get something
[22:16] &gt;&gt; and uh it's only for the ones that God
[22:18] wants them to get.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; If we'd read verse 20,
[22:34] maybe we'll go up to 17. I got 17 on.
[22:36] Sorry, Vicki. I'm sorry. I'm trying to
[22:39] hurry and I'm I'm getting spanked by
[22:42] God. And if some of the branches be
[22:44] broken off, and thou being a gentile,
[22:49] a wild olive tree, that's every one of
[22:51] us sitting here,
[22:54] &gt;&gt; were grafted in amongst them, and and
[22:57] with them be partaker of the root.
[22:59] That's being partaker of God's
[23:01] goodliness, and the fatness of the off
[23:03] the tree. Boast not
[23:07] against the ones that you were grafted
[23:08] into. Let's just jump to verse 20. Well,
[23:12] because of unbelief, they were broken
[23:14] off. And thou standest by faith.
[23:18] Be not highminded.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I preached what Paul
[23:29] preached."
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Paul laid the foundation. Brother Bram
[23:32] built on that. Be not high minded,
[23:41] &gt;&gt; but fear.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; You can't name me many message churches
[23:47] that practice that.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; I'll just say amen for you. Amen. I know
[23:55] it's the truth because God showed it to
[23:57] me.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; You will not believe how much ammunition
[24:00] that God gave me in my iPad.
[24:03] I could preach probably for 30 services,
[24:06] but I'll try to get it in three.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; You are saved by amazing grace.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; And not of yourself. It is a gift. It is
[24:20] a gift. It is a gift.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; It is a gift of God.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:31] I I I said something before
[24:34] and uh I want to clarify something. I
[24:37] don't believe that you can come to this
[24:40] glorious truth, this message that we've
[24:42] come to and turn it down. That's
[24:45] iniquity.
[24:46] Because see, this message is not just a
[24:49] message. This is a revelation of the
[24:53] Bible of This is a revelation of God.
[24:56] It's a revelation of the Bible, but it's
[24:57] a revelation of Christ. And so you can't
[25:00] come to this message and say, "Well,
[25:02] this is all hog." No, no, no, no, no,
[25:03] no. I'm not talking about that.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; You You can't turn down truth and think
[25:10] you're going in the rapture. But there's
[25:13] ones that will go in the rapture that
[25:15] will have received less
[25:18] than you have received.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; That's Bible.
[25:29] You see what I mean?
[25:31] &gt;&gt; So, you know, I'm not talking about
[25:33] people that turn down this truth. You
[25:35] can't turn down the Bible and turn down
[25:36] the revelation of the Bible and think
[25:38] you're converted.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; But you also can't believe the Bible and
[25:43] think you're the only one.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Because verse 21 says, "For if God spare
[25:52] not the natural branches,
[25:54] take heed, lest he spare not thee."
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, watch this. My title for
[26:02] those that just come in is the seed of
[26:04] God always brings the nature of God.
[26:09] Want to know what the nature of God was?
[26:11] His nature was I would that none would
[26:12] be lost.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:17] He never came to the cross saying,
[26:19] "Well, it's just going to be me make
[26:20] it."
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe we should read verse 20 again.
[26:29] Well, because of unbelief they were
[26:31] broken off, and thou standeth by faith,
[26:34] but be not
[26:38] &gt;&gt; high-minded.
[26:40] Amen.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; If you think you're the only one going
[26:43] in the rapture, you're high-minded.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; But fear,
[26:53] John, let's go to our next scripture.
[26:55] John 5 24. Amen. There's just a ton of
[26:59] ton of ton of just fantastic fruit here,
[27:03] you know. And so I want to just hit on
[27:05] some different things. Amen. here.
[27:10] Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he
[27:12] that heareth my word and believeth on
[27:14] him that sent me,
[27:18] &gt;&gt; that's Jehovah, hath everlasting life,
[27:21] and shall not come into condemnation,
[27:30] &gt;&gt; but pass from death onto life. Now,
[27:32] that's a promise given to anybody that
[27:36] believe on Christ
[27:38] &gt;&gt; that God the Father sent him to earth to
[27:41] redeem me
[27:44] &gt;&gt; shall have everlasting life and not come
[27:46] to condemnation.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:01] Ephesians 4:30 and 32. Grieve not the
[28:04] Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are
[28:07] sealed until the day of redemption.
[28:10] And let all this this is how you grieve
[28:13] God.
[28:15] This is exactly how you grieve God.
[28:19] Bible.
[28:21] Let all bitterness, wrath,
[28:24] anger,
[28:26] clamor, evil speaking.
[28:32] I'm the only one worthy.
[28:37] Be put away from you
[28:40] with all malice.
[28:43] And this now we're coming into the
[28:45] nature of God.
[28:47] And be ye kind
[28:51] one to another, tenderhearted,
[28:55] forgiving one another,
[28:59] even as God for Christ's sake has
[29:03] forgiven you.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; We We have to be so careful because of
[29:12] what we have not to get hotty and
[29:16] high-minded. I'm going to show you
[29:18] things that are going to make you fall
[29:20] right off your pew of what our prophet
[29:22] said.
[29:25] Amen. Truthful things.
[29:28] You know,
[29:30] there will be many surprises when we get
[29:33] over there.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Watch in the water baptism. Our first
[29:42] quote here, he said, "When the word
[29:44] that's written in parables and
[29:46] everything else that can only be
[29:47] revealed,
[29:49] only the truth will ever be known by
[29:52] spiritual
[29:54] revelation."
[29:56] Well, how do you get spiritual
[29:57] revelation? It ain't by believing this
[29:59] message.
[30:02] Because Christ said to Peter, "Blessed
[30:04] are you, Simon by Jonah, for flesh and
[30:07] blood never revealed this unto you, but
[30:11] my father [screaming]
[30:13] &gt;&gt; which is in heaven has revealed this
[30:14] unto you. And upon this rock,
[30:20] &gt;&gt; it was the revelation of God." There's
[30:22] billions of people that will read a
[30:24] message book and throw them in the
[30:25] garbage. Now, I feel sorry for those
[30:28] people because it is unveiling of God.
[30:31] It is the truth of God. But you can't
[30:34] find out about God. The prophet said
[30:36] this thousands of times. You cannot know
[30:39] who God is by education.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; So you can't read the message and get a
[30:45] revelation of God.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; It's by grace.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; It's by grace.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; You find out the revelation of this
[30:54] message because God opened your eyes so
[30:58] you could see it. What you understand
[31:01] about water baptism? Thousands of people
[31:04] could read and they're just like, "Well,
[31:05] I don't see it. I don't see
[31:09] &gt;&gt; what you know about serpent seed."
[31:11] Millions of people could read it and
[31:13] they just I don't see nothing different.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; And but because God anointed your eyes
[31:19] and because God anointed your eyes, you
[31:21] will be held accountable for more in
[31:25] more stuff.
[31:31] spiritual revelation. And if you watch
[31:33] this now, this is what I told you when I
[31:36] traveled
[31:37] &gt;&gt; and and I'm I'm just it's not because
[31:39] it's not because I'm brother Dale's very
[31:42] uneducated, but it's because it water
[31:45] and oil don't mix.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; And you when you drop water in a pale of
[31:49] oil, it just rides right up on top. And
[31:52] so when I'm swear someone else is in the
[31:54] pulpit and they say something that just
[31:56] flat out don't mix. It just rides right
[31:58] up on top and God says, "Well, I have a
[32:01] thousand scriptures that say contradict
[32:03] that."
[32:05] Here the prophet says, "If your
[32:06] revelation doesn't tie it together, then
[32:10] your revelation is wrong."
[32:13] See, it must blend.
[32:18] Like you're putting a jigsaw puzzle
[32:20] together. It don't have anything to do
[32:21] with the sides here. And look what he
[32:24] said. The sense is all mixed up. And you
[32:26] say, "Well, I believe it goes here and I
[32:29] believe it goes there." That's the human
[32:31] mind.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; People can do things with their human
[32:37] mind, but the first thing you know, your
[32:39] scene will be wrong and you'll be
[32:41] putting the cow on top of the tree.
[32:45] I heard a bunch of cows that were on top
[32:47] of trees in the last two or three months
[32:49] in churches around Ontario.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; And see if you don't work it. See, but
[32:55] if you will, if you got something here
[32:58] to go by, oh, now you say God revealed
[33:01] something to me. If it isn't according
[33:04] to the word and ties the word together,
[33:08] then your revelation is wrong.
[33:15] Right. The word.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; That means you do not have to know
[33:18] Brother Bram's name to go in the
[33:20] rapture.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Because John 5 said that if you believe
[33:27] on him that sent me.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; You shall have everlasting life and not
[33:33] come to the condemnation but shall pass
[33:35] from death unto life.
[33:43] Matthew shows it here.
[33:46] Matthew 16:17 and 18. And Jesus answered
[33:49] and said unto them, "Blessed art thou,
[33:50] Simon Barjonah." Sorry, I'll read this.
[33:53] I just quoted this. For for flesh and
[33:56] blood did not reveal this unto you, but
[33:59] my father which is in heaven. And I say
[34:01] also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and
[34:04] upon this rock shall I build my church,
[34:06] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[34:09] against it. That revelation is
[34:12] supernatural revelation. You can't get
[34:14] educated into the revelation of God.
[34:17] Here in a quote here of the prophet, he
[34:19] said, "If your revelation doesn't die,
[34:21] you say, well, God revealed it unto me
[34:23] and I should be baptized in the in the
[34:26] titles." He said if it doesn't tie with
[34:29] the word from Genesis to Revelations
[34:32] and it ties it all together then your
[34:34] revelation is wrong.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we we have to we have to be
[34:41] careful this whole this whole thought is
[34:47] God was never
[34:50] God was always the lamb of humility.
[34:54] always
[34:56] &gt;&gt; he was spit upon beard. You know when he
[34:59] was on the cross he said he saves other
[35:00] but himself he could not save. He said I
[35:03] could have called 10 legions of angels
[35:05] &gt;&gt; to destroy the world and set them free.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; You know when the prophet called out I'm
[35:14] going to just I'm showing you some some
[35:16] facts so you don't all get up and leave
[35:18] right away. But you know when the
[35:19] prophet came out and cursed those boys
[35:21] and the she bearer come out and ate all
[35:22] those boys. Brother Bram said that was
[35:24] not the spirit of God.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; It was an angry prophet.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; See, the seed of God will always bring
[35:33] the nature of God.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; And the nature of God is you'll never
[35:38] say we're the only ones.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; You'll never say that ever.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; You'll never say that. That is straight
[35:47] from hell.
[35:52] Proverbs 16:18 and 19. Pride goeth
[35:55] before destruction and a hotty spirit
[35:59] before a fall.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:15] Better better is it to be of a humble
[36:19] spirit and and with lowly than to divide
[36:23] the spools with the proud.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, well, I want to take this
[36:29] revelation and dovetail it from Genesis
[36:33] to Revelations and the same in the
[36:35] prophet. You know, I'm going to I'm
[36:37] going to quote you quotes that the
[36:38] prophet said in the seventh seal that
[36:41] contradicts
[36:43] things that we heard just in the last
[36:45] few months.
[36:47] Here
[36:50] our next quote here and this is just
[36:52] showing how the nature of God will be
[36:55] different. Now sometimes we refer to
[36:56] people and he and he says look at this.
[36:59] He said like myself going forth praying
[37:01] for the sick and having success. Now I
[37:04] just like maybe a show of hands. Did
[37:06] brother Brandon have successful meetings
[37:07] praying for the sick? I mean God working
[37:10] through the brother. Oh yeah for sure.
[37:13] Watch this. He says, "That don't mean
[37:14] I'll go to heaven."
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; That don't mean I'll go to heaven. That
[37:27] That sounds really hottie to me, don't
[37:29] it? I don't think so.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet that was the seed of
[37:36] God. And the prophet, Brother Brham, had
[37:40] the nature of God.
[37:44] You'd be surprised if the pro and he's
[37:46] not because he's his work is done. But
[37:48] if he came back, he would preach a
[37:50] completely different message than what
[37:52] many churches are healing around the
[37:54] country today.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Patty.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; A very different message.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz your prophet was humble,
[38:04] &gt;&gt; humble,
[38:05] &gt;&gt; humble,
[38:07] &gt;&gt; and more humble. Amen.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you something else. He was
[38:13] genuine.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; He was genuine and used of God
[38:19] &gt;&gt; like nobody since or before.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; See, the person that really gets to
[38:31] heaven, here's brother Bam still capital
[38:34] letters. The person that really gets to
[38:36] heaven will little be a little surprised
[38:38] you got there.
[38:41] You know what this is? Humility.
[38:45] This is humility.
[38:47] Land tells me it's nothing but grace. If
[38:50] I ever make it, it'll be amazing grace.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; It'll be more than amazing. It'll be
[38:57] actually unbelievable.
[39:01] It won't be, well, I'm the only one.
[39:05] God revealed it onto me.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Next pair got I don't know if I
[39:24] we we got we got time. We are we all
[39:26] right? We got a little bit time. I'll
[39:27] just quit when it's time to quit and
[39:29] start up next week. Many in that day
[39:31] will say, "When I when you were naked,
[39:34] Lord, we clothed thee."
[39:37] They they don't understand when when you
[39:38] were hungry, we fed thee. And when you
[39:41] were in prison, you visited me. And he
[39:43] said, "In so much as you did it onto
[39:44] these, my brethren, you did it onto me."
[39:47] And they didn't even think that they
[39:49] were worthy to get there.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; They didn't even think they were worthy
[39:54] to get there.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where I'm going, Vicki.
[39:59] right there and then think that we're
[40:01] some kind of a big shot.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; No. No. Okay.
[40:07] Am I in line with our prophet?
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[40:19] Wow.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Wow. I'm just going to say, wow.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; And when we think that we're some kind
[40:33] of a big shot,
[40:35] how are you ever going to get to have
[40:37] that spirit get there?
[40:41] The message is the only one going in the
[40:44] rapture.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Never.
[40:48] Never. 52 countries in the world can't
[40:51] have the rapture or the message.
[40:54] And the Bible says that there will be
[40:57] people from every country, tongue,
[40:58] nation, and language go on the rapture.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, maybe I I wasn't going to and I
[41:06] might retell it better, but I listened
[41:09] to a a testimony that moved me.
[41:12] Unbelievable.
[41:14] Like, I've never been moved
[41:17] from a regular person from North Korea.
[41:20] And I I will almost guarantee you, you
[41:22] haven't heard it.
[41:24] It was almost supernatural how I got it.
[41:28] And he was living his life to be an
[41:30] engineer in North Korea.
[41:34] And his grandma was about to die.
[41:37] And it was literally less than 3 days
[41:39] before she died. She got him there. Now
[41:42] to very speak anything but to worship of
[41:45] Kim and the leaders is death. It's
[41:48] called treason.
[41:51] firing squad.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture?
[41:55] &gt;&gt; When people come over here in our big
[41:57] country and they get highminded and
[42:00] bigheaded and and think that we got all
[42:04] the answers.
[42:06] Brother Bram said, "When you go to the
[42:08] mission field, you better know that he's
[42:09] on your side cuz those witch doctors
[42:12] will tie you up and spit you out."
[42:17] This grandma said told this young boy
[42:20] that had never heard of any gospel other
[42:24] than the government of the country.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; You don't think that's possible? They
[42:29] have no internet in that country. They
[42:32] have no media except the worship of the
[42:35] government.
[42:36] To own a Bible there is death almost on
[42:39] the spot.
[42:46] his grandma said, he said, "Your grandpa
[42:48] didn't die like you think he did. He
[42:51] believed in Jesus and he was sent away
[42:54] and died that way." And she said, "I
[42:56] have secretly served him my whole entire
[42:58] life. And now that I'm ready to die, I'm
[43:01] telling you that
[43:06] now." You have to picture this. This is
[43:07] a 30-year-old man ready to graduate from
[43:10] engineer school. He thinks I I know this
[43:14] is hard for you to believe.
[43:17] It was hard for me to believe. And you
[43:19] want me to tell you something else? If I
[43:20] could get a hold of that guy, I would
[43:22] invite him to this church to give his
[43:23] testimony.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; He's living in the States right now.
[43:32] He didn't know. Honestly, honestly, he
[43:36] didn't know with his whole heart that
[43:38] there was any other god other than the
[43:40] leaders of North Korea.
[43:46] That's hard to believe.
[43:51] Let me tell you something else hard to
[43:53] believe. My wife was born into a very
[43:57] rich, very big family in Indiana.
[44:01] And she had to meet me to hear about the
[44:03] prophet.
[44:06] And I didn't even know about him when I
[44:07] met her.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; But she grew up and walked around where
[44:13] the prophet walked.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; And never ever one time seen a quote, a
[44:19] picture, a nothing.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; A nothing.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; That's hard to believe. She had to go to
[44:27] Wallisburg Church to hear Lonnie Jenkins
[44:30] preach the first message that was truth.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; You know, God can't stand a hotty
[44:39] spirit.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; God can't stand a proud spirit.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; That's disgusting.
[44:48] And so this boy just maybe I I wasn't
[44:50] planning on telling this testimony, but
[44:52] long story short, you know, his grandma
[44:55] dies and he's like he's got this in his
[44:57] head. There's a real God.
[45:00] But he he knew. And for him to search to
[45:03] find something outside of the God of his
[45:05] government was death. Death.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; They don't mess around.
[45:12] Forget the trial. It's immediate.
[45:18] You want to see the power of God, you
[45:20] need to do a little traveling. You
[45:22] You'll feel something supernatural. And
[45:25] he was somewhere uptown and somebody
[45:28] caught his spirit.
[45:30] Literally caught his spirit. And he
[45:32] said, "We should go for a walk."
[45:35] He said, "Okay." Never seen the person
[45:36] before. Ever.
[45:38] Ever.
[45:41] See, God is still God.
[45:47] And the guy they were walking beside a
[45:49] creek
[45:50] and everything this you had never heard
[45:53] all the secrecy until you were in a
[45:54] communist country like that.
[45:58] And he said I noticed something about
[46:00] you.
[46:02] Everything is very secretive. Very
[46:04] secretive. They don't trust nobody in
[46:06] that country. If somebody's caught for
[46:10] treason,
[46:11] like if I was caught,
[46:13] all my grandparents older than me,
[46:15] everybody older than me, aunts and
[46:16] uncles and everybody would be killed.
[46:19] And everybody younger than me that had
[46:20] the same name as me that would really
[46:23] wean out the length staff jeans.
[46:27] It don't matter if you agreed or hated
[46:29] or anything. It's unbelievable. It's
[46:32] execution mass.
[46:35] Anyway, after this is I mean I'm telling
[46:38] you in three or four minutes, but this
[46:40] is after literally months and years.
[46:44] Uh they secretly figured out that they
[46:47] were and so the guy fellowshipped with
[46:50] them some that he was he'd heard the
[46:52] name Jesus. Like that was just like
[46:55] unbelievable to him.
[46:58] Think of how much more you've heard than
[47:00] just the name Jesus.
[47:06] Just let that sink in for a minute. Just
[47:09] think how much more you've hurt than
[47:11] just a simple name.
[47:14] Jesus,
[47:18] I'm not worthy. I'm not even close to
[47:21] worthy.
[47:28] And so the the guy taught him some
[47:32] motions that they could uh communicate
[47:35] secretly.
[47:38] And uh
[47:40] anyway, after about a year or two,
[47:43] they trusted him enough to uh
[47:54] take him to a gathering.
[47:57] And he said it was so
[48:02] serious when we went to the gathering
[48:04] that my
[48:06] only person I knew that served God in
[48:08] the world.
[48:10] That's just unbelievable.
[48:13] We never went into the gathering but 20
[48:15] minutes apart. We never rode together.
[48:17] We never went into the gathering
[48:19] together. And we went in a falling down
[48:21] building. He said there was just like
[48:23] one handful of people in a circle. And
[48:27] he said, "We come in 20 minutes later
[48:30] and that was an underground church like
[48:32] you've never seen before. And if they
[48:34] ever get caught, they would just been
[48:36] massacred right on the spot. Right.
[48:38] Right on the spot. Not maybe, not sort
[48:40] of." And so he went there for about 2 or
[48:42] 3 years. I mean, the trust is like
[48:45] through the roof. You talk about trust.
[48:48] We ain't got none of that here. And
[48:51] after like two years or something, they
[48:53] said, "Okay, you've been here for
[48:56] and everybody left and his friend stayed
[48:58] behind
[49:00] in this place and he moved some
[49:02] furniture and in the secret wall they
[49:04] had a New Testament only."
[49:07] And he said, "We have two of these in
[49:09] the group." And he said, "Nobody's
[49:11] allowed to have it more than two days."
[49:14] Nobody's allowed to have it more than
[49:16] two days. He said, "If this is caught on
[49:17] you, you're shot instantly.
[49:21] And he said, 'If you reveal who we are,
[49:23] we're shot instantly also.
[49:26] And he said, 'I got that Bible. And he
[49:29] said, I memorize books of the Bible.
[49:34] Not verses, books of the Bible,
[49:37] and I would play them through my
[49:39] thoughts when I never had the Bible.
[49:43] Anyway,
[49:45] I'm taking too long in this testimony,
[49:46] but I want I want you to get this.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[49:53] &gt;&gt; He was returning the Bible
[49:57] and he was used to going through the
[49:59] guards for his school in the engineering
[50:02] and they knew him and he had the Bible
[50:04] hidden in an inside liner in the
[50:06] suitcase. Has ever anybody ever been
[50:08] searched in Canada and the inside liners
[50:11] of your luggage for hidden things?
[50:16] Notice my hand still up.
[50:20] I have been.
[50:22] I had my suitcase completely almost
[50:25] destroyed in the Toronto airport.
[50:29] I must have been hiding something. Take
[50:32] a look.
[50:34] Certainly don't have an honest face.
[50:39] I was stunned.
[50:43] But I tell you something. There's going
[50:44] to be some more things you're going to
[50:45] be stunned at before the rapture
[50:48] happens.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; There's things happening right here.
[50:59] Anyway,
[51:02] he had it hid so well they never found
[51:03] it. But the guy was he never found it
[51:06] even when he took it apart, but he felt
[51:08] it
[51:10] and he lied. He said, "My my bag came
[51:14] apart and I put a board in there to
[51:15] support it." And that's what you're
[51:17] feeling is the hard part. And they
[51:18] ripped the cut his bag apart and the
[51:22] Bible fell out in the ground. They said,
[51:23] "Treason."
[51:24] Not maybe treason. It is treason. Cuz
[51:27] there's only one God there, and that's
[51:29] Kim.
[51:32] They threw him in a vehicle, put him in
[51:34] a room 3x3 by3 with the bucket. And the
[51:37] next morning, they brought him out to
[51:38] the firing squad. They blindfolded him,
[51:40] brought him out before the firing squad.
[51:42] in his building.
[51:44] When they got him up against the wall
[51:45] where the wall was banged with all kinds
[51:47] of bullets and all that, they took this
[51:50] blindfold off and I I forget did I tell
[51:52] you? I think there was six five or six
[51:55] young soldiers. He said many of them
[51:57] would have never executed anybody before
[51:59] because they it it shows you know when
[52:01] you're serving Satan they you want to
[52:03] pro you know when you go into different
[52:05] secret societies you have to do things
[52:07] to prove your faith.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're online. So, I mean, that's
[52:11] online, too. So, it's fine. If I
[52:14] disappear, I didn't kill myself. Amen.
[52:16] There's things that you do in secret
[52:18] societies that you have to prove
[52:21] that you're loyal to that society.
[52:23] Freemasons is a society. [snorts] You
[52:25] You can Google that. You don't have to
[52:27] believe anything I'm telling you.
[52:29] Anyway,
[52:31] and that's like to show these soldiers
[52:33] that they're loyal to Kim and he's the
[52:34] only God, everybody has to get a chance
[52:37] to execute people that are treasoned.
[52:40] And so they were there and they raised
[52:41] his trial. Bible caught on and that they
[52:44] all brought up the guns to shoot him and
[52:46] the guns wouldn't shoot.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; The guy beside him
[52:53] was losing his mind because it was his
[52:55] badge. He's under Kim, you know. So he
[52:59] grabbed the closest gun next to him and
[53:01] grabbed it. Checked it and shot him
[53:03] also. It wouldn't shoot.
[53:06] So he told him to reload, put new
[53:08] ammunition in, and all five or six of
[53:11] them what they were. I have this
[53:12] testimony. I'm This is not fiction,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; by the way.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; This is a living person.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Living person that lives in the States.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; And if I can get his name and I could
[53:25] get him to come here, I would.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; They reloaded
[53:30] and the guns wouldn't fire.
[53:33] And I actually, now this is where SK, I
[53:36] don't know if they went and got six more
[53:37] people, but they had a timeout. And he
[53:39] thought he actually believed, he
[53:41] honestly believed the young man, the
[53:43] Christian young man honestly believed
[53:44] that it was a type of a fear tactic to
[53:47] get him to break down and denounce
[53:48] Christ
[53:50] and they did time out. And I this is the
[53:52] part the only part I don't know from
[53:54] memory and I listened to it multiple
[53:55] times is or many and I would have
[53:57] listened I didn't plan on sharing it
[53:59] today or would listen again, but I'm not
[54:01] sure if they brought in six more or not.
[54:02] But anyway, the guns wouldn't shoot.
[54:05] Now I I now this is no. And now listen,
[54:09] if you're here to this Sunday, you got
[54:11] to be here next Sunday
[54:14] cuz I'm going to tell you what our
[54:15] prophet says about stuff like this. And
[54:18] I can't get to it all in one day.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; But this person never heard of Brother
[54:23] Brandham,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; but there's still a God. Now, yes, God
[54:28] used brother Brandham. Yes, he was the
[54:31] messenger, the star for this age. Yes.
[54:33] And yes, it unveiled the mysteries.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to know all the
[54:37] mysteries to make guns not work.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; And so they actually believed it was
[54:43] some kind of witchcraft spirit. And they
[54:44] talked about the heavens weren't in
[54:46] favor of the government and this that.
[54:48] He talks about them and he said they the
[54:50] two young soldiers went in and put them
[54:53] back in his cell and he said they don't
[54:55] know it but they heard I heard them
[54:57] talking. And he said they their bosses
[54:59] and that were so afraid of how that was
[55:01] going to de demoralize that jail cell
[55:05] and the people like the people that were
[55:06] over it and his boss and the people in
[55:08] charge of doing that executing they like
[55:10] they could get executed by him and like
[55:13] it was just crazy.
[55:16] Anyway, I got this ain't my whole
[55:18] message but long story short, the next
[55:20] day they sent him to a labor camp which
[55:22] was basically labor camp for death. uh
[55:25] totally death. And there was another
[55:27] guard in there that that over he the
[55:31] labor they mined stuff that wrecked
[55:33] their lungs. And so he was he said, "I
[55:35] seen people die every day and beat and
[55:38] he seen you name it, he seen it." And
[55:40] I'm trying to get on to my message.
[55:42] Anyway,
[55:45] another guard that had been put in there
[55:47] for treason also helped him escape. Now,
[55:50] I want to show you how his faith was. He
[55:52] he told the guard, he said, "How are we
[55:55] going to get out?" And you know what the
[55:56] guard asked him? He said, "You're
[55:59] serving a god that stopped the guns from
[56:01] shooting you."
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; And you're worrying how you're going to
[56:04] get out.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; What kind of a dummy are you? And then
[56:09] he said, "But what are we going to eat
[56:10] when we're out there?" And you know, and
[56:12] how we going to And he tells him the
[56:14] same thing again. He said, "Now, he just
[56:16] stopped like how many guns from
[56:17] literally shooting you, Dad. and you're
[56:20] worried about what you're going to eat
[56:21] tomorrow.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Anyway, long story short, they went
[56:27] through they they went after they'd been
[56:29] in the prison long enough, they were
[56:31] trust that they went out to to to clear
[56:33] trees and make logs. This is this is a
[56:35] true story. This is not no fairy tale.
[56:38] And when they were doing the logs, they
[56:40] they they studied like they have
[56:43] unbelievable amount of time. They
[56:44] studied everything. They studied the
[56:47] guards and they knew where the guards
[56:49] would meet, then turn around and walk
[56:51] back and they knew the time that the
[56:53] guards would change. And so any break in
[56:56] the they would have and he said we had
[56:58] about a two-minute break when the guards
[57:00] went back and they would change the
[57:02] guards. But one something happened the
[57:04] one day they were there and the phone rg
[57:06] and the one guard went to answer the
[57:07] phone and the guy looked at them and
[57:09] give them the sign, drop your things and
[57:12] they dropped their tools and they went
[57:13] through the bush. They went through the
[57:15] bush and of course immediately they let
[57:17] the dogs out for them and and the the
[57:19] bullets and of course and that and he
[57:21] said you know uh you know I imagine you
[57:24] could really move when you know you know
[57:26] this is really it.
[57:29] And they got past that and and and away
[57:32] from that. And so then they came to the
[57:34] line and he said, "Now this is another
[57:36] dangerous spot because the the the
[57:38] borders were guarded and they had to
[57:40] cross the creek and they tied their
[57:42] shoes around their neck cuz they wanted
[57:44] to put their shoes back on dry and they
[57:46] were waiting through." And he said the
[57:47] guards they they also studied them. and
[57:49] they'd watch them come right by and
[57:52] overlap and then right by and they they
[57:54] were close enough they could hide them
[57:56] and they were there in the night in the
[57:57] dark and the fog and and so he said when
[57:59] the guards went back he said we went in
[58:00] and we went into the river but he said
[58:02] we couldn't make any noise in the river
[58:03] and he said oh boy so he said it was
[58:05] just like ice freezing ice but he
[58:08] couldn't make sound he said the current
[58:09] was so deep that he said I got my foot
[58:11] he let go and he said I started floating
[58:12] downstream the guy actually grabbed onto
[58:14] me and hung me up and he said our heads
[58:16] were coming out or our nose were coming
[58:18] out of the water and he He said, "We
[58:19] heard the guards coming back by and they
[58:21] were talking about soccer and sports."
[58:24] And he said, "Our nose was out." And he
[58:25] said, "If there would have been one
[58:26] sound," he said, "we would have been we
[58:28] would have been sheared with gunfire
[58:31] in the water." They got to the other
[58:33] side. They went to a now they're in
[58:35] China, which is only slightly better.
[58:38] Um, and uh, they they went to a barn and
[58:41] and all this and and uh they they
[58:43] actually hid in the barn until their
[58:45] clothes got dressed and then they they
[58:46] tried to look like a Chinese and they
[58:49] would only go out at night. And they
[58:50] finally found a a a secret undercover
[58:56] and his buddy went to South Korea
[58:59] because he had family there. And this
[59:02] man is in the States right now. You know
[59:04] what he does for a living?
[59:07] He goes around to churches,
[59:10] tells them how blessed they are, tells
[59:13] them a real testimony.
[59:15] I stood and fired a firing squad.
[59:20] Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; We have so much so much. And that ain't
[59:27] to take away from, you know, uh if God
[59:30] wants this brother to know the message,
[59:31] he'll bring him to it.
[59:34] But there will be ones in those
[59:35] countries that will go to the rapture
[59:39] that will never been honored and blessed
[59:41] to know the revelation and the blessings
[59:45] that you know.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; And it's insulting to them and insulting
[59:49] to God
[59:50] &gt;&gt; to say different.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Let me get back on my quote. I'm sorry.
[1:00:05] [snorts]
[1:00:05] We're going to start there about the
[1:00:06] third line down. Fourth line.
[1:00:09] He said, "When you take that attitude
[1:00:12] that you're bigger than somebody else or
[1:00:14] bigger than somebody else, you're larger
[1:00:18] in number or your denomination is bigger
[1:00:20] or something like that, how are you ever
[1:00:23] going to make it over there like that?"
[1:00:26] He said, "When the robe was to make them
[1:00:30] all look alike in the sight of God,
[1:00:33] we're all alike."
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see this? Amen. We We because
[1:00:39] we're blessed with the truth and the
[1:00:41] revelation and and all that go with it.
[1:00:43] Yes, it's the truth. But I want to show
[1:00:45] you something. Spirits don't die. We're
[1:00:48] going back to the Bible. Spirits don't
[1:00:51] die and they don't change.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:56] Luke 9:46.
[1:01:01] Watch how the same spirit was back when
[1:01:03] Jesus was here is what it is right here
[1:01:06] in our midst.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And then arose reasoning among them
[1:01:10] which of them should be the greatest.
[1:01:16] Well, there you go.
[1:01:18] That was the message of the day.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Who's the greatest message person?
[1:01:25] And Jesus perceiving their thoughts of
[1:01:28] their hearts, took a little child, and
[1:01:29] he sat him by him. And he said unto
[1:01:31] them, "Whosoever shall receive this
[1:01:33] little child in the name receiveth me?
[1:01:36] And whosoever shall receive me receive
[1:01:38] him that sent me. For he that is the
[1:01:42] least among you all." Now, who would be
[1:01:46] the least among you all spiritually
[1:01:48] speaking? Somebody who wasn't blessed to
[1:01:50] hear this message yet because they live
[1:01:52] in one of the 52 countries in the world
[1:01:54] that haven't even been allowed to have a
[1:01:55] Bible.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Watch what Jesus said.
[1:02:01] The least among you all, the same shall
[1:02:04] be the greatest.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I I've been blessed to know this
[1:02:10] message, but I haven't stood in front of
[1:02:11] a firing squad and the gun's not
[1:02:12] working. Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; But somebody else wasn't blessed to hear
[1:02:16] the message and they stood in front of a
[1:02:18] firing squad and the guns didn't work
[1:02:19] multiple times.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; We have to be very very very careful.
[1:02:24] Now, is this Bible? Amen. We we we
[1:02:26] realize this is Luke now.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; And watch how this goes along. You can't
[1:02:33] make this stuff up. I I'm not even this
[1:02:36] smart to put it together. In verse 49,
[1:02:38] and John answered and said, Master
[1:02:41] God, Jesus, Jehovah, whatever you want
[1:02:44] to say, we saw someone casting out
[1:02:49] devils in thy name, and we forbade them
[1:02:52] because he didn't follow us.
[1:02:55] Followed not us.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; We forbade them.
[1:03:06] Does that sound familiar? Does anybody
[1:03:08] catching this?
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, "Forbay them
[1:03:16] not, for he that is not against us is
[1:03:20] for us."
[1:03:21] So because somebody ain't sitting in the
[1:03:24] church that you go to,
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; if they're serving God with all the
[1:03:29] revelation that God's given them and all
[1:03:32] the knowledge that God's given them and
[1:03:34] all the understanding that's got I don't
[1:03:36] mean turning it down. You can't turn it
[1:03:37] down. That's iniquity. But I mean, if if
[1:03:40] God's brought you truth and you've
[1:03:42] accepted it, and he brought you more
[1:03:44] truth and you accepted it, and he
[1:03:46] brought you more truth and you accepted
[1:03:47] it,
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; but you haven't reached the kind of
[1:03:51] truth that you're sitting in.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; You have no reason to kick him out.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't turn down truth. That's
[1:04:02] sin. That's iniquity.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I have a story to prove this
[1:04:09] that our prophet sold. Remember the
[1:04:11] story about the ranch owner
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; that brought his son to the town to find
[1:04:16] a wife for his son.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Now, I I have literally dozens and
[1:04:23] dozens of scriptures and quotes the next
[1:04:26] three weeks. I pray every one of you
[1:04:28] that are here cuz you're almost going to
[1:04:29] think I'm anti
[1:04:31] anti- something
[1:04:33] but I'm going to prove it by the prophet
[1:04:36] and you know the story of the the rich
[1:04:38] man and he was in and all the brides can
[1:04:41] we take the prophet did the prophet say
[1:04:43] that the natural types of spiritual
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; was he did he not say that he was a
[1:04:48] typology and all he could use was
[1:04:50] typology
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; okay so this rich young man was around
[1:04:53] all the message girls in the message
[1:04:57] and all they were were a bunch of flirt
[1:04:58] heads
[1:05:00] and his head was getting all foggy
[1:05:03] and brother Bram said he stepped outside
[1:05:06] because see they knew their value. Watch
[1:05:10] this. Watch this. Those girls that the
[1:05:12] rancher's dad brought her son to the
[1:05:15] girls that she first went to, they knew
[1:05:18] they were hot stuff.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; They knew their value.
[1:05:26] Yeah.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And the son stepped outside to clear his
[1:05:29] head. Now watch me. And there was a girl
[1:05:32] there that did not know her value.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And she was a watch girl. And she was
[1:05:38] throwing out the wash work. And she
[1:05:41] wasn't dressed up. She wasn't puffed up.
[1:05:44] She wasn't smelled up.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; She did not know her value. And the son
[1:05:52] said, "I want to talk to you. I want to
[1:05:55] talk to you." Remember, she did not know
[1:05:58] her value. And she's like, the prophet
[1:06:00] doesn't like, "Oh, [screaming] no. What
[1:06:02] did I do? What did I do? Did I get
[1:06:03] water?"
[1:06:04] And she's like, "No, no, no. Don't don't
[1:06:06] talk to me. You go talk to them."
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Remember, there was one daughter there
[1:06:13] that didn't know her value, and that was
[1:06:15] a wash daughter.
[1:06:21] Uh-huh.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; She was not the one that said, "I'm
[1:06:26] going to be the only one going in the
[1:06:27] rapture."
[1:06:29] She said, "I know I'm not worthy to go.
[1:06:31] I'm not even planning on going."
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; And that was the one the son picked.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference
[1:06:43] in the attitude?
[1:06:46] Amazing
[1:06:56] different attitude. Now that same story
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; is also told in Mark and I'm not going
[1:07:02] to read it. The same story we talked
[1:07:04] about who will be the greatest among us
[1:07:07] is told in Mark 9:33 to 41.
[1:07:12] It's also told in there that they seen
[1:07:15] somebody that didn't attend their
[1:07:17] church, didn't believe the same message,
[1:07:18] and didn't follow the same prophet.
[1:07:20] Watch this. Do you know those people
[1:07:23] that were casting out demons did not
[1:07:25] follow the same prophet as the disciples
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; because Jesus was a prophet. He was more
[1:07:30] than a prophet. He was Jehovah. But but
[1:07:32] but one of his names would have been
[1:07:34] prophet
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; and he didn't follow us.
[1:07:40] You see?
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Now, now listen, I'm not trying to de
[1:07:46] Jesus was more than a prophet, but one
[1:07:49] of his callings would have been a
[1:07:50] prophet. And they said, "Because he
[1:07:52] didn't follow us, we forbid them."
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Why would you do that?"
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one. Let's let's go
[1:08:00] let's see what the prophet says. And a
[1:08:02] few days later, when [clears throat]
[1:08:04] they found a man that was not in their
[1:08:06] uh
[1:08:08] You're going to have to pull that up
[1:08:09] there. I don't know what that big word
[1:08:10] is.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ecclesiastical Rome. What's that
[1:08:17] mean?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, he wasn't in their church.
[1:08:22] Now, this is the prophet by Is that all
[1:08:23] right if I show the prophet?
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; And and we heard Jesus pronounce these
[1:08:28] things and he was getting the job done
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and he was casting out devils. And Peter
[1:08:34] and John came to him and said,
[1:08:37] "We had belonged." He didn't belong to
[1:08:39] their group and he couldn't do it.
[1:08:44] Why is brother Brandon preaching on
[1:08:45] that?
[1:08:47] Cuz God told him to.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Why am I preaching on it? Because God
[1:08:51] told me to.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; You'll have to follow us and link up
[1:08:57] with us and you're going to and we're
[1:09:00] the church and you got nothing to do
[1:09:02] with it.
[1:09:05] Oh boys, I love the prophet. He said,
[1:09:08] "Stuff nobody reads."
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; You know, it's cold. I got all the
[1:09:12] farmwork done. I can spend whole days
[1:09:14] studying the prophet.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; I find stuff there that
[1:09:19] has never been taught before.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; He Jesus said, and he let them know to
[1:09:26] attend to their own business. And here
[1:09:28] Jesus, he said he was getting along
[1:09:31] pretty good. Well, without joining their
[1:09:34] organization.
[1:09:39] How would that fit into most ranks?
[1:09:46] That is what the prophet said, right?
[1:09:48] Did I misquote it? Was I even misleading
[1:09:51] what the prophet said
[1:09:55] here? Next one. He said a few days later
[1:09:57] from then they found man casting out
[1:09:59] devils who wasn't a disciple and the man
[1:10:03] were getting the job done and he
[1:10:04] actually was getting it done and he was
[1:10:06] casting out devils and they stood around
[1:10:08] here and Jesus said whosoever will
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; see whosoever will will serve Christ.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Now this this is brother Brandham's
[1:10:20] preaching by the way. So if you don't
[1:10:22] like this kind of a slander on the
[1:10:24] message, you're going to have to talk to
[1:10:25] the prophet.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's me." And away he
[1:10:30] went and he's getting the job done.
[1:10:32] That's right. He said, "And they were
[1:10:34] and watch this though. This Oh, you
[1:10:36] maybe got that on there." And they were
[1:10:38] jealous
[1:10:40] because they couldn't do it. And they
[1:10:43] told Jesus, "We forbided him."
[1:10:47] And Jesus said,"Forbid him not, for he
[1:10:51] that is not with us scatterth abroad,
[1:10:54] and no man can do miracles in my name
[1:10:56] and speak lightly of me." And today,
[1:10:59] watch this. Now, you need, we could
[1:11:01] probably close after this. It's only
[1:11:03] 11:14, but I can go a little further.
[1:11:06] And today,
[1:11:09] it's nothing but play. childlike
[1:11:12] juvenile delinquency, juvenile jealousy
[1:11:17] among the high churches that won't bring
[1:11:20] themselves down to receive the baptism
[1:11:23] of the Holy Ghost and practice divine
[1:11:25] healing powers in the Holy Ghost among
[1:11:27] the churches. Amen. That's exactly it's
[1:11:30] the truth.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] What we're preaching against is an
[1:11:37] arrogant spirit.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And it's not the nature of God.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; You know, you know, when you get an
[1:11:44] arrogant spirit, it's because you have
[1:11:46] low self-esteem.
[1:11:48] You know, anybody that's troubled with
[1:11:50] smoking or drinking or doing drugs or
[1:11:52] anything at school or anything off your
[1:11:55] own conviction,
[1:11:56] you you know what, parents, your young
[1:11:58] kids, and when they're teenagers, you
[1:12:01] need to teach them who they are in
[1:12:03] Christ.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And nobody can take it from them.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Nobody. I am God's child. Period.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; I don't need to smoke to be cool. I
[1:12:14] don't need to drink to be cool. I don't
[1:12:16] need to do drugs to be cool. I don't
[1:12:18] need to do all these sins to be cool.
[1:12:20] I'm already cool.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; God's cool.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; You need to know who you are.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Not I'm not in an arrogant standpoint,
[1:12:30] but but but when you get when you get
[1:12:33] arrogant, you got low self-esteem and
[1:12:35] you're trying to prove something that
[1:12:36] you don't have to prove. You watch this.
[1:12:39] You watch the richest people in the
[1:12:41] world
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; wear no jewelry.
[1:12:44] They never wear a tie.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; They wear a t-shirt. Maybe just plain
[1:12:50] cuz they don't have to prove that they
[1:12:52] got money.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; But you see a [screaming] poor little
[1:12:55] person like me and I'll put on a gold
[1:12:58] necklace and try to buy a $100 suit to
[1:13:01] show you that I'm really something.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe ain't got five cents in the bank.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; You see the difference? Yeah.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; If you got God in your bank account, you
[1:13:12] don't have to prove nothing to nobody.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; You're working out your salvation
[1:13:17] between you and Jehovah.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; You don't have to prove to this church
[1:13:21] that you're of Jehovah. If nobody else
[1:13:23] can see it, well, Jehovah can see it.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] That that was a quote by the way.
[1:13:47] Notice
[1:13:50] and now how pretty people can be. Next
[1:13:52] quote, Vicki. These disciples, they were
[1:13:55] just like other men.
[1:13:57] Two [clears throat] or three days later,
[1:13:58] they found a man casting out devils and
[1:14:00] he was getting the job done, doing a
[1:14:02] real job. And the disciples found him
[1:14:04] and just like the man of our day. And
[1:14:05] they said, "Come join our church. Come
[1:14:08] be a message believer. Come hook up with
[1:14:11] us cuz you can't do this unless you go
[1:14:14] with us."
[1:14:18] I I do believe this totally. This is the
[1:14:21] full truth. But sometimes it takes years
[1:14:24] for people to come to this
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; years.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; You got to trust God. This ain't
[1:14:30] drive-through McDonald's.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] We're witnessing to people that will
[1:14:36] they might not come here for you if if
[1:14:38] they're God's elect seed. They'll come
[1:14:40] to to to the fullness of the word if if
[1:14:43] if they're allowed to by by the
[1:14:45] governments and all this. But I'm just
[1:14:47] saying it it's not by Dale's schedule.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; They you know, Brother Bram said that
[1:14:53] grandma's prayers could be answered
[1:14:54] after she dies.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] because you don't see something. Don't
[1:15:00] don't be so radical to throw them out.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's of the devil.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Here he said down there in that quote,
[1:15:18] he said, "I heard Jesus say, whosoever
[1:15:20] will, let him come." They were jealous
[1:15:23] because that man that this man was
[1:15:26] getting the job done and they couldn't
[1:15:28] do it. That's greater in Solomon. Next
[1:15:30] one. He said, "You'll see that it was a
[1:15:33] little pretty jealousy in these
[1:15:34] disciples and they were in the men then
[1:15:37] and they were still men today." And it's
[1:15:39] still in the men today. That's right.
[1:15:42] Because the men are getting the job
[1:15:43] done. And many times you find people
[1:15:45] that are getting the job done and they
[1:15:47] don't belong to our ranks.
[1:15:51] Uh
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; oh.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And we want to to fly up about it,
[1:16:01] but it's just the same element if it was
[1:16:04] in the church of the 12 disciples that
[1:16:07] walked with Jesus. It abounds bound to
[1:16:10] be in this one and all the rest of them.
[1:16:14] Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; And so you brethren,
[1:16:17] we are here representing the Lord Jesus
[1:16:20] Christ in his resurrection. And we pray
[1:16:23] that we'll fellowship around the word
[1:16:25] with us. And we shall pray for just a
[1:16:28] moment.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Another just some quotes. I want to just
[1:16:33] and I'm trying to get to a a point if it
[1:16:36] if we're still all right. Just here. He
[1:16:38] says he said here when brother Brown
[1:16:41] went behind the curtain of the time he
[1:16:42] said then a voice spiked to me and he
[1:16:43] said it's what you preach the Holy Ghost
[1:16:46] is it's perfect love and nothing can
[1:16:49] enter in there without it.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Okay another one the same and it's just
[1:16:54] two on this. Thus sayaith the Lord. Now
[1:16:56] we know that's God. Thus sayaith the
[1:16:59] Lord. It'll take perfect love to put you
[1:17:01] in that place for that's all there was
[1:17:06] is perfect love. That's an adoption.
[1:17:07] Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; It's all there was.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; It won't take a perfect theology.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; It'll take perfect love.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Perfect love comes from Jehovah,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to just a we just go give
[1:17:30] me maybe 10 minutes or something. And he
[1:17:32] said that's the reason today that we're
[1:17:33] wondering and that's what's the matter.
[1:17:35] And I hate when he brother Brandham was
[1:17:37] in a different age. He said that's the
[1:17:39] matter with the message. Bick church he
[1:17:43] said Pentecostal church said
[1:17:48] it's because we've taken a different
[1:17:51] nature.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; It's a different nature.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; We've taken a different nature. We've
[1:17:58] taken on the nature that we want our
[1:18:01] rights and we're going to do that and we
[1:18:04] know that it's right to do it and we
[1:18:06] become arrogant.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; We become arrogant and we become hostile
[1:18:13] and we become indifferent. Let that
[1:18:17] little temper come in and let the
[1:18:19] selfishness come in. Amen. That's why
[1:18:22] message churches are not witnessing.
[1:18:25] They're not standing out in the streets.
[1:18:26] That's why they're not going to their
[1:18:28] neighbors and passing out saying, you
[1:18:29] know, Jesus is alive today and he's
[1:18:31] actually real and he did some great
[1:18:33] things for me today. Today.
[1:18:36] You know why I message people? Because
[1:18:38] you know why? Because they're arrogant.
[1:18:40] They're hostile and they're indifferent.
[1:18:42] And when you're arrogant and you're
[1:18:44] hostile and indifferent, you can't go to
[1:18:47] your neighbor's door and when they and
[1:18:49] they come out and they look different
[1:18:50] than what you expect them to look and
[1:18:51] you say, "Hey, God bless you today. I
[1:18:54] just brought you a package of bananas
[1:18:56] and I really hope you have a great day
[1:18:58] and it's not supposed to rain.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't think that was God? Well,
[1:19:07] we haven't got to the one where God
[1:19:09] comes down from heaven and he separates
[1:19:11] the sheep and the goats.
[1:19:16] We haven't got to that scripture yet
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; because most of the spirit around this
[1:19:24] is I got it. You don't got it. I'm
[1:19:27] better than you. I'm not worried about
[1:19:29] you.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; It's not the nature of God.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; There's people that are literally
[1:19:35] seriously deceived. You know, there's
[1:19:36] churches in this message believe that
[1:19:38] there's a zero grace outside of the
[1:19:41] message of the hour.
[1:19:44] Brother Brown never said that and the
[1:19:46] Bible definitely don't say it. So who
[1:19:48] are they following? They're not
[1:19:51] following Brother Brown and they're not
[1:19:53] following the Bible.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; This message is grace.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; But but but
[1:20:00] Jesus was grace when he hung on the
[1:20:01] cross.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now now listen, I know where I'm
[1:20:07] standing
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; because I've had six weeks to study this
[1:20:10] and I got the prophet and I I don't just
[1:20:12] got one. I didn't just cherry pick one.
[1:20:14] I probably have 20 or 30 more quotes to
[1:20:16] show you.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "And the lamb, when it comes
[1:20:21] time,
[1:20:23] he owns his own wool. That's his right.
[1:20:26] And his own
[1:20:28] he owns his wool, but he's taken the
[1:20:31] lamb and he throws them up on his
[1:20:32] buttocks and he ties his feet up and he
[1:20:35] never kicks and he never fusses. And you
[1:20:37] take the rights away from him because
[1:20:39] he's a lamb. He can't do nothing else
[1:20:42] because that's his nature.
[1:20:46] But one time, watch this. But one time,
[1:20:49] but one time, cross a Christian's path
[1:20:53] and you'll find out whether he's a lamb
[1:20:57] or a goat.
[1:21:00] Just tell them something that they don't
[1:21:02] like.
[1:21:05] You don't have to worry about what
[1:21:06] nature. It'll come out
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:21:10] mouth speaketh. And you'll find out that
[1:21:13] when you cross them up one time, that's
[1:21:15] the reason today that our churches are
[1:21:18] in the condition that they're in. Now,
[1:21:21] this is thus saith the prophet.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; If we want to change, we have to change
[1:21:28] what he's preaching against here. And
[1:21:30] you'll call ourselves the lamb of God.
[1:21:32] Women and men together has to begin to
[1:21:35] act everything but lambs of God.
[1:21:41] Wow. God help us.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; There there's literally I'm telling you
[1:21:44] something. There's people that are
[1:21:46] deceived. You know that you know brother
[1:21:48] Bam, let me just show you something that
[1:21:49] was said. You know, Brother Bram, if
[1:21:52] you're eternal, you always were.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Right? And and you can Google this.
[1:21:58] Eternity means you have no beginning and
[1:22:00] no end.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] Everybody is that that's
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I know that's that's that's science and
[1:22:07] that's the prophet.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And yet I just heard a message somebody
[1:22:12] preached a message and he said some
[1:22:14] people are eternal life and some people
[1:22:15] will get eternal life.
[1:22:21] How can you get eternal life?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; You can't get eternal life. You either
[1:22:29] are eternal or you not eternal. Brother
[1:22:32] Ram said that we're justified as if we
[1:22:34] never did it in the first place.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; So, how can we bring somebody a minister
[1:22:39] from another country to preach in a
[1:22:40] church of 300 people and everybody go,
[1:22:42] "Yeah, [screaming]
[1:22:43] let's give them a love offering of three
[1:22:44] or 4 thousand."
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And he said, "When I was there, some are
[1:22:52] eternal life and some will become
[1:22:54] eternal life."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's not nothing. That ain't science.
[1:22:58] That ain't message. That's just
[1:23:00] stupidity.
[1:23:08] Because you can't tell. There could be a
[1:23:10] prostitute at the well that has eternal
[1:23:12] life. Oh, she don't look like she's got
[1:23:14] eternal life. But she's got the seed of
[1:23:16] God that will change her nature. And
[1:23:19] before that, she's supposed to go. You
[1:23:21] say, "Huh?" Do you remember how the
[1:23:22] people that Jesus went to? Rahab in the
[1:23:24] wall, the woman at the well, the woman
[1:23:26] caught in the very act. The woman that
[1:23:28] washed his feet was a sinful woman.
[1:23:41] But they got justified as if they never
[1:23:43] done it
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; in the first place.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Now that's the truth.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; But where' that other stuff come from?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Where we at, Vicki?
[1:24:13] In other words, I think we're in another
[1:24:15] quote here, but in other words, the
[1:24:18] righteous in returning with Christ to
[1:24:21] the earth shall tread down the ashes.
[1:24:23] And when you see this, like the prophet
[1:24:26] said things that were just amazing. And
[1:24:29] when you see these people hotty,
[1:24:31] arrogant, and disle
[1:24:36] despiteable, snoody, and just claiming
[1:24:39] to be Christians, they ain't nothing but
[1:24:42] ashes.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Wow. I wonder if Brother Brown did come
[1:24:47] back and was ministering, how many big
[1:24:50] message churches would invite him to
[1:24:52] preach?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; I can tell you ahead of time.
[1:25:00] That's all. That's all they are. That
[1:25:03] attitude.
[1:25:04] That's what the scriptures say. See, now
[1:25:07] watch.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Now, see, it wasn't brother Brown. It
[1:25:12] ain't brother Dale preaching this. Your
[1:25:13] prophet preached this.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; You say you believe the prophet. That's
[1:25:16] what I believe, too.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; You know, people in this message, you
[1:25:20] know, it sister Margaret, this confuses
[1:25:22] me really. You know, there's a few
[1:25:23] things that confuse me is there's people
[1:25:26] that want to take every single word the
[1:25:28] prophet says and I say, "Okay, no
[1:25:29] problem. Let's take every word." And
[1:25:32] then when I bring up words like this,
[1:25:33] they go, "Well, we don't want to take
[1:25:34] that one." Well, wait a minute. Wait a
[1:25:36] minute. Like, we got to take the ones
[1:25:38] that were like anointed. And he said,
[1:25:39] "Thus say like just tell me what the
[1:25:41] rules are."
[1:25:43] Yeah.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; But the R but you're changing the rules
[1:25:48] when I find I had people that came and
[1:25:51] said everything the prophet said was
[1:25:52] anointed and divine to God. I and I just
[1:25:54] rattled off three or four quotes.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; They didn't stay around
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; because they didn't believe what the
[1:26:07] prophet said.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; They said they did. But then when I told
[1:26:11] him what he said, like this quote,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; they decided to find a church that they
[1:26:16] never read the quotes.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; But see, I'm not my own boss.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; I'm just following instructions.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what I think I got my Okay,
[1:26:50] here we go. Yeah. John 21.
[1:26:54] We're going to my 10 minutes. I think I
[1:26:56] got a minute left. We're going to close
[1:26:58] here. If I just read a few scriptures
[1:27:00] and then we'll close. John 21:20 and 22.
[1:27:03] When Peter turning about, seeing the
[1:27:05] disciples whom Jesus loved, which
[1:27:08] [clears throat] also leaned on the
[1:27:10] breast at supper time, saith unto the
[1:27:13] Lord, what which is he that betrayeth
[1:27:16] thee?
[1:27:18] And Peter seeing him saith unto Jesus,
[1:27:22] Lord,
[1:27:24] what shall this man do?
[1:27:32] That sounds like something I would say.
[1:27:34] I've definitely said that in the past.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; What should they do? Listen how Jesus
[1:27:40] answered me.
[1:27:44] And Jesus said unto me,
[1:27:46] "If I will tarry, if if I will that he
[1:27:50] tar till I come, what is that to thee?
[1:27:56] Follow thou me?
[1:27:58] Why are you worrying about the people
[1:27:59] that aren't going to make it
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; when you should just be worrying about
[1:28:02] if you're going to make it?
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; What is that to thee? Just shut up and
[1:28:09] follow me.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; You're worrying about other people's
[1:28:12] business and it ain't none of your
[1:28:14] business.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus is telling them, "This
[1:28:17] is none of your business.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; It just just leave it on." And it went
[1:28:21] around. The disciples said, "Oh, this
[1:28:22] person was going to tarry until Jesus
[1:28:24] returned 2,000 years later." No, Jesus
[1:28:26] never said that. He said, "You're
[1:28:28] worrying about something that you don't
[1:28:29] have nothing, no business to worry
[1:28:30] about."
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 13:12, I'm trying to
[1:28:34] hurry. And for now, we see through a
[1:28:36] glass darkly, but then face to face. Now
[1:28:39] we see in part, but then shall we be
[1:28:42] known
[1:28:44] as also I am known. Now, now, now that
[1:28:48] is a paradox because I believe that the
[1:28:51] message revealed the seals and took the
[1:28:54] mysteries out of the Bible and all of
[1:28:55] that, but we even have quotes that the
[1:28:58] prophet said. He said, "Even your
[1:28:59] understanding and revelation of the
[1:29:02] message when you get there could be
[1:29:04] slightly different
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; than what you believed."
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. What this scripture is really
[1:29:11] saying is you think you have everything
[1:29:13] figured out perfectly.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And yes, we do have the mysteries
[1:29:18] revealed, but I still don't have
[1:29:20] everything figured out perfectly.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; My my threeb brain or 4 pound brain or
[1:29:25] 10 pound brain or no brain at all
[1:29:27] couldn't comprehend God.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Just let it go. you we you know like you
[1:29:34] know there's message believers that they
[1:29:36] would be better to keep their mouth shut
[1:29:38] and and keep the doubt whether they were
[1:29:41] dumb or not but instead you open your
[1:29:43] mouth and you remove all doubt
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; you open your mouth and you just show
[1:29:50] where'd that come from
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; didn't come from God
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Romans 12
[1:29:59] I just got to get to Revelation so I
[1:30:01] Three scriptures here. Romans 12:3-5.
[1:30:03] For I say though, through the grace that
[1:30:05] was given unto me, that every man that
[1:30:08] is among you not to think of himself
[1:30:12] more highly
[1:30:15] than he ought to think.
[1:30:18] Wait a minute. But I'm a message
[1:30:21] believer.
[1:30:23] I'm a minister of a message believer.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; They didn't read this scripture.
[1:30:32] not to think more highly of himself than
[1:30:34] he ought to think, but to think soberly
[1:30:37] according as God hath dealt every man a
[1:30:42] measure of faith. Because somebody has
[1:30:44] more faith in you or less faith in you,
[1:30:48] let God just be Jehovah.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; You're definitely not the God.
[1:30:55] For as we have many members in one body,
[1:30:59] and all members have not the same
[1:31:02] office,
[1:31:04] so we being many are one body in Christ,
[1:31:07] and every member one of another.
[1:31:13] Luke [clears throat] 12:47
[1:31:15] Luke 12:47. And that servant which knew
[1:31:19] his lord's will prepared not himself,
[1:31:24] neither did according to his will shall
[1:31:26] be beaten
[1:31:28] with many stripes.
[1:31:31] But he that knew not, these are the
[1:31:34] people that live in the 52 countries
[1:31:36] that they're not allowed to have a
[1:31:38] Bible.
[1:31:40] But he that knew not did not commit
[1:31:43] things worthy of stripes. Poor saying,
[1:31:47] "Ah, they can't go. They can't go cuz
[1:31:49] they don't know what I know." Huh? I got
[1:31:53] Bible that tells you wrong.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Did not commit things worthy of stripes
[1:31:59] shall be beaten with very few stripes.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; For unto whomsoever much is given to him
[1:32:06] shall much be required, and to whom men
[1:32:08] have committed much, to him they will
[1:32:12] ask the more. Yeah.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; God help me for what we know and and and
[1:32:19] see. My last scripture and we'll we'll
[1:32:21] close on this. Amen. Revelation 7 9.
[1:32:30] Most I just just for next week I mean if
[1:32:32] any of you show up just by per chance
[1:32:35] anybody would show up. Most of my quotes
[1:32:38] of things that I stated and that of the
[1:32:41] prophet are still in my iPad. And if
[1:32:44] anybody wants any quotes or scriptures,
[1:32:45] I'll send them to you with flashing
[1:32:47] lights because there not one thing I've
[1:32:49] read here that isn't right in the
[1:32:52] message or the Bible. Revelations 7 and
[1:32:55] 9. And after this I beheld, and lo, a
[1:32:58] great multitude,
[1:33:01] which no man could number
[1:33:07] of all nations.
[1:33:13] and kindreds
[1:33:15] and people
[1:33:18] and tongue
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; stood before the throne and before the
[1:33:25] lamb clothed in white robes and their
[1:33:28] and psalms
[1:33:30] in their hands.
[1:33:33] There will be
[1:33:35] Christians [snorts]
[1:33:38] and people come out
[1:33:42] from every nation,
[1:33:44] every kindred
[1:33:46] and every tongue.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know
[1:33:53] that this message is not even
[1:33:56] interpreted in every
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; dialect
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; in the world? Yeah.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; So, how could a message believer that's
[1:34:03] born a minister in the States or Canada
[1:34:06] or Europe say, "Well, they can't go
[1:34:10] because they don't know his name,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; and it ain't even in every dialect of
[1:34:15] every language."
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that spirit's wrong.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you who's going to be there.
[1:34:23] I'm closing. You can come, honey. I'm
[1:34:26] closing. I'm not trying to take away
[1:34:28] from anything that we know is truth. Not
[1:34:32] at all.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; But the ones that'll be in heaven and
[1:34:37] the ones that'll go in the rapture will
[1:34:39] be the seed of God that have the nature
[1:34:43] of Christ. Yeah.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; And God has given us abundantly more
[1:34:49] than than I deserve to give us a
[1:34:53] beautiful message in my natural language
[1:34:57] tongue, English, and North America. And
[1:35:00] we will be held accountable.
[1:35:03] Oh,
[1:35:09] wow.
[1:35:17] And 52 countries can't carry a New
[1:35:21] Testament Bible.
[1:35:24] Have no outside internet. Most of those
[1:35:26] countries
[1:35:28] have no news broadcasts unless the
[1:35:31] government is the news.
[1:35:35] God tells you this morning. I believe
[1:35:38] God tells you this morning. We need to
[1:35:40] come off our high horse.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; We need to come down off our high horse
[1:35:45] and pray like never before people less
[1:35:49] less blessed
[1:35:51] than you and me.
[1:35:54] I don't know what God will do with all
[1:35:56] this stuff. I don't know.
[1:35:59] And yes, the message is true, but he's
[1:36:02] gave us an unbelievable amount of
[1:36:05] revelation and knowledge
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; that most of the world does not even
[1:36:10] have.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Doesn't even have. Brother Bram said
[1:36:14] things like this. He said, "When I go to
[1:36:16] those countries," he said, "they deserve
[1:36:19] to live the same as I do."
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; But they haven't got what you got.
[1:36:26] and the last person in the world's going
[1:36:28] to stand up and say, "Well, I'm better
[1:36:30] than them."
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be this person. So, if
[1:36:33] you don't like that kind of preaching,
[1:36:34] you're in the wrong church
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; because I deserve hell
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; if it wasn't for grace.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; I deserve to be lost. Amen. But God help
[1:36:49] us. Sometimes we we get this and then we
[1:36:51] get this spirit on us
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; that somehow we came to God on our own.
[1:36:57] Somehow we realized this message on our
[1:36:59] own. Somehow we figured it out on our
[1:37:02] own.
[1:37:05] Wrong seed, wrong nature.
[1:37:09] Amen. God help us. God help me. God help
[1:37:13] me. God help me. Amazing grace.
[1:37:18] Wow. Amen. I'm I'm sorry.
[1:37:23] Wow. I had other messages that are far
[1:37:28] sweeter to preach than that.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; But I got my orders.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Part two will be next Sunday. And
[1:37:35] hopefully we can change the subject soon
[1:37:38] as God will let us. Amen. God I you know
[1:37:40] we're at the end times church
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; and we need to check our nature.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to what I say. Brother Bram
[1:37:46] said all kinds of things. Don't live me
[1:37:48] a sermon. Like, don't preach me a
[1:37:49] sermon. Live me a sermon. Look at my
[1:37:52] nature. Look where I'm trying to do for
[1:37:54] the kingdom. He said things. Look at
[1:37:56] their spirit. What are they trying to
[1:37:58] achieve? Am I building a kingdom to
[1:38:01] myself? Well, run for your life.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; But are we trying to build the kingdom
[1:38:04] of God? Maybe you need to reconsider.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. God help us to build
[1:38:12] his. It's all about Jesus Christ. all
[1:38:15] about Jesus Christ. I'm I I will leave
[1:38:18] this with you. I will leave this with
[1:38:20] you.
[1:38:24] You're going to be surprised what your
[1:38:25] prophet says about this. I didn't I
[1:38:27] never touched the snow on the capstone
[1:38:30] of the iceberg of what the prophet said
[1:38:33] in your message. Even in the seventh
[1:38:35] seal and even in 64, what he talked
[1:38:39] about this spirit that's in the message
[1:38:46] It stinks.
[1:38:48] It stinks when you get so you can
[1:38:51] recognize the people in the street
[1:38:53] [music] as children of God and try to go
[1:38:56] share the love of God to them. You're
[1:38:59] getting on the right nature.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; You're getting on the right path.
[1:39:06] Amen. Let me maybe I just say this.
[1:39:09] Brother Bram said this is the nature of
[1:39:11] God. He said, "If I seen you riding in a
[1:39:13] boat going to Nagger Falls
[1:39:17] and I was losing my mind on shore, it's
[1:39:21] not because I don't like you, cuz I know
[1:39:23] you're going to die when you go over the
[1:39:25] falls [music] because your boat can't
[1:39:28] survive the fall."
[1:39:31] And so when you see message believers
[1:39:34] that do nothing for the kingdom of God,
[1:39:37] yeah, I'm going to repeat that again.
[1:39:38] [music] do nothing for the kingdom of
[1:39:40] God,
[1:39:42] including sharing the love of God,
[1:39:46] and you're letting people go over the
[1:39:47] false.
[1:39:52] It's a different nature.
[1:39:54] It's a different nature.
[1:39:57] It's a different nature.
[1:40:01] The nature will never lie.
[1:40:04] Every seed will bring forth the nature
[1:40:07] of its kind.
[1:40:10] I I got to stop.
[1:40:13] God help me.
[1:40:16] Let me be pleasing [music and singing]
[1:40:20] to you.
[1:40:28] Praise [music]
[1:40:38] [music]
[1:40:41] every
[1:40:47] [music]
[1:40:50] heart
[1:40:53] to [music] you.
[1:40:56] Heat.
[1:41:00] [music]
[1:41:03] Heat.
[1:41:08] [music]
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; you
[1:41:29] [music]
[1:41:37] Jesus
[1:41:40] one more Jesus.
[1:41:43] [music]
[1:41:48] [music]
[1:41:52] You
[1:41:55] [music]
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:42:14] [music]
[1:42:25] [music]
[1:42:27] Lord God, I believe that's a prayer that
[1:42:31] everyone represents here. [music] Lord,
[1:42:33] I pray that you'll take them all. I
[1:42:36] don't mean that this spirit is just in
[1:42:39] [music] our ranks here. And and I don't
[1:42:42] believe it is for the most part at all,
[1:42:45] but in the world fellowship that we
[1:42:47] fellowship around, Lord God, [music]
[1:42:52] help us Jesus to
[1:42:54] have the real nature of Christ.
[1:42:58] It's a sacrificial lamb.
[1:43:03] Lord God, I pray you'll bless a small
[1:43:06] gathering here this morning. [music] And
[1:43:08] Lord, may they not take it I wasn't
[1:43:11] preaching just to them, but it's just
[1:43:13] the atmosphere around us. Don't take it
[1:43:15] personal. If if if it's something God
[1:43:18] needs to deal with us, help me, Jesus.
[1:43:21] But this is this [music] spirit is
[1:43:24] everywhere.
[1:43:26] Help
[1:43:31] us Jesus.
[1:43:36] [music]
[1:43:36] Lord, we know that you promised in the
[1:43:38] Bible that all that the father had given
[1:43:41] you in your hand
[1:43:44] that none would be lost. [music]
[1:43:47] That's what we claim cling to, Lord God.
[1:43:50] We know that
[1:43:54] [music] he put us in your hand.
[1:43:57] It's impossible for you to lose us. Help
[1:44:00] me, Jesus. Bless your people in a
[1:44:03] special way in our fellowship after. In
[1:44:05] your name we pray. [music]
[1:44:06] Amen. God bless you.
