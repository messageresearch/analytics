amen just uh you know uh you just it's just the way it is amen you know you can look at that however you want you think of when they had the uh the freedom convoy how many people of us were interested in it and many went but when we have a freedom convey for jesus there's very little interest very few went now you could go for trudeau or you could go for christ amen and uh they're both fine but one's a lot more powerful than the other amen it's just really good also just a few announcements just uh matt and abigail were out just it's maybe her last weekend with her sister she's from germany and hadn't seen you know for many years two years because of the the the you know covet and stuff and so matt had called me last night i totally understand all these things many holidays probably many more are out and i just remember sister kim and the boys and brother jim and sister linda also brother john blackman got moved today to his home uh to an old age home to uh to a in said instead a retirement home not really a note h and he's kind of on his own but kind of they you know take care of everything in sedford so just remember him and we'll be going out to see some of them and different ones see man just uh just real awesome to be there you know when we were gone i just uh many many uh thoughts and you know had a lot of time to look in the word amen and i felt like i hadn't preached for a long time and i was really ready to explode amen just to unload some things that god had shared with us i know in the future this uh this month the 18th brother james will be with us from lewis nelson's church and the next sunday i think is the 23rd and brother june from the philippines the brother was at the convention and will be with us the the following sunday anyway i think it's the 23rd then also like farther ahead john dank was that same brother june is going to be preaching at john danquist meetings thanksgiving weekend and mississauga let's turn to luke 1 and we'll go to verse 30 and would just uh i just flagged me down or whatever when i'm supposed to stop because i get just many many many thoughts and sermons and just pray that god will catch our thoughts are we up vicky on the computer and camera and everything apologize for the any of those are online brother jim especially or sister kim that are watching patricia was sick this morning uh very sick remember her too sis patricia we apologize we're back on nine but we're going to get a new computer our computer's tired but we decided to wait until our lawyer stuff was done for the deed of the church we didn't really know what to expect in total for that and we want it to be uh wise surp you know wise in her so we're gonna wait and then we're gonna buy a new computer and and do some improvements that way so amen and an angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus now you can make this to the message i want to preach on the message and you have found favor with god and you have conceived and become a son in yourself let's just drop to verse 35 and the angel said unto her the holy ghost show over uh the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god this is exactly what's happening to each individual that's elect bride in our age amen with the baptism of the holy ghost here you know in verse 34 the verse above that then mary said unto the angel how shall it be and the world's asking how could christ bring a bride in this age how could he represent him exact identical self in our age how can it be it's because of god the holy ghost amen hallelujah and mary said those amazing words in verse 38 she said man mary said behold the handmaiden of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her now i want you to knows here that every single word in the scripture has a purpose and a meeting and and i want to show you something that's very hard in the next few weeks and if i don't finish before the brothers come i'm going to continue on but i i believe as christian believers message believers we're missing the mark in a few spots and we're going to look into that here in first corinthians three first corinthians three and verse 11. verse 11 then we're going to drop the 16th for theirs for up for others for other foundations can no man lay than that which is laid which is christ jesus everybody's trying to lay a lot of stuff down but nobody can lay anything down but christ jesus and and this just dropped to verse 18 for know ye not that ye are the temple of god and the spirit of god dwelleth in thee and then let's just drop down to verse 21. therefore let no man glory in man for all things are yours amen you may be seated god bless you god bless the reading of his word you know uh and i apologize we're going to show some quotes up here and and when i'm preaching doctrine i want to show you some quotes and i and so i have one up there i have the one of the last ones i sent to you vicky was a deity quote i don't don't have a title on it um it was one of the last three i sent later just forgive us we're kind of new at this where i am but you know there's some things that that you know the bride of christ i believe is you can uh can get right and and you know this this whole thought started and and god just compounded it when we had our vacation bible school here and the lady asked us about our denomination and how we were connected and what we believed and she had actually told me she said i had went online when i told her we never had a denomination she said i had one online and she said no no no no she said i went online and found out you know that you have a headquarters and your message believers and all that and all of that is true and all of that is false now let me repeat that she told me she went online she said now you're a message believer since she said i found out where your headquarters are and all that and you know you you know and all of that is true and all of that is false we have pushed men too much too much and we've pushed even minutes the five-fold ministry too much they have a purpose we have pushed even men too much over women we have pushed adults too much over children you know our prophet said it were exactly identically i'm going to prove this to you in nature exactly identically the same except a different position exactly the same you are exactly the elect purchase predestinated bride of christ identical so how could one elect bride identical part of christ look down their nose at another identical elect part of the bride of christ and i looked up you know studying the prophet and i'm going to have more for next week and different things definitely god used a prophet in this day a major prophet and uh and it brought a message but but never never never never witness we we for to til we go in the rapture we're going to say we're ma message when we're among ourselves but never ever witness or talk to your friends about a message talk to him about christ talk to him about christ jesus not a message talk to him about the word of god the holy bible and the christ jesus because you know in the bible you know in the prophet had a catholic person come to him and and just pray for me i'm i just scattered very much so but the prophet had a a catholic person come to him said god will judge the world by the catholic church that makes a lot of sense because there was the first church and you know john the baptist was in it and all these things and the first church and and you look at that and and you know what the prophet asked him god bless you brother fred the prophet asked them which one so now your message believers this morning let's just bring this up to 2022. you tell somebody you're witnessing and they're checking you out online and they say well which one are you the return ministry message believer or maybe you're the two souls message believers or maybe you're the perugia message believer or maybe you're just the tape only message believer or maybe you're only the voice of god which they patented the prophet's voice because they actually believed that the vocal cords of that man were actually the vocal cords maybe you're that message believer you see but see you can't divide christ if you're witnessing and you say i am a part of jesus christ he's undivided amen he's undivided you see what i'm saying everything that god's prophet brought was christ and you know we're going to look into that more than that but i want to show you something here and then i want to get into it and you know uh even when we pray you see so many things and let's can we can i have that one quote it's it don't have a title to it it's one of the last ones it's a it started paragraph 80. amen said all the functions you'll see just down just about four lines it'll say the deity of god is not in heaven y'all see that there it's in you and so when you get sick we come to the front and that's fine that's fine it's all fine and you get prayed for it but why do you know our prophet said i don't have this quote tomorrow i'll have it this week because i didn't put everything together coming back from ottawa yesterday late night do you know the prophet said that the greatest enemy that god had was hope he said nine he said if a thousand people come up to get prayer they would all say i have faith and he said 999 would hope that hope but faith is not hope it's actually a purchased possession amen he said all you need to do to get your healing is accepted it's mine period i don't have to pray about it i don't have to get god's will it's mine it's not maybe it's mine i hope it's my i think it's mine it might be mine i wonder if it's god's will i've done all those prayers we pray for god's will the deity of god is not in heaven it's in you it's yours you you you hope that your children will be saved it it's your it's yours it's yours see you have to understand it's the the prophet said this he said for every holy ghost believer all the promises apply for you and your household you don't have to pray about that it's done it's a finnish work it's all over all the devils in hell couldn't take that from you amen it's over you say well my god will supply all my knees according to his riches of gourds and we get gray hair worrying about it you know why we do that because we hope we hope and we're looking for something that we can see and that's why we lift up a ministry a prophet a man when when we're exactly the same now i'm not going to show these once today because i don't have them up but our prophet said multiple times he actually said it he actually said it this strong just take my word for it and i'll prove it next sunday he said the reason that you don't have faith in the church is because you have big men and big ministers and big ministry and big people as you're looking to and you're putting your faith in them that's the reason we don't see it that's the reason that's pretty he said there's no holy hill there's no holy church there's no holy man there's no holy priesthood but there's a holy christ and the reason you ain't got the faith is because you're looking at the holy church you're looking at the holy but the christ is invisible amen let's just look down further and when you recognize almighty god just the next word he said when you recognize in the blue when you recognize that the almighty god lives in you in mortal life the life that gives his zodi life it's god's own life in a human being it's a 100 jehovah god you know you know and it's fine the prophet did it in the agency it was progressive revelation you know if that if we believe that we could get rid of the oil we never pray for another person but we have hope so we come for prayer that's powerful it's powerful the beginning of verse 82 paragraph 82 he said our brother and sister he said that deity is in you and a little while the will cease to be no more and yet ye shall see me for i am in you and with you until the end of the age in a manger no christ in you hallelujah we're not right worshiping christ in a manger but we're worse but it's christ in you the holy ghost the hope of glory hallelujah the creator god dwelling in a human being it does not yet appear what we shall be for we shall see him as he is for we were made of him and the spirit in a human being that's that's amazing those are amazing words amen hallelujah i sent you another one vicky that had the title deity of jesus on it there you see right in the top paragraph 84 he said brother when the deity of god by the holy ghost comes into a human heart it calls everything out that that christ hasn't created and you know that's the truth that's the red there amen god christ the hope of glory in you not see how powerful that is wow thank you lord amen you pull up the next one it's a c that is in you it was one of the last ones also he said now if if christ was standing here right now he could do no more for you what he's already done he said your price has already been paid now he said he's the same he said what about your sickness he said the price it's already paid so you're asking for it and it's already done he said it's already paid he said every name that's already been healed every one of you is already healed period past tense you see that right there just down three to four lines healed of your sickness is that right for that every one of you are forgiven but you just have to accept it right there every one of you is healed you just have to accept it you're forgiven all you have to do is accept it amen see we live way below what god intended now he's proven that he's the same yesterday today and forever if he's standing here he couldn't heal you no more because of your unbelief amen he couldn't save you no more than if he isn't here because it's already done to him it's it's past god don't even you know i i do this sometimes and and you know because we're humans i tell my wife something i say pay a bill and then i forget about it because i told her to pay the bill and if she come back two weeks later and said i forgot to send that and i go you see i just completely forgot about it a guy said it and it's over but that's like god he said it and it's over and you come back to him asking him for something that he already did he's like oh my children are amen if you stand here he couldn't heal you at all with your unbelief he said you would have to believe it just the same as you believe it right now he said you'd have to the same because many mighty works he was unable to do because of their own belief when he was here wow amen let me show you example and a brother actually used some of this and uh uh i'm just gonna fish in his pond and use some of his stuff and use the kids and that let's just turn to john 12 for a second and we're just going to read a scripture and show it and and we'll we won't be long this morning and and i want to i want to vindicate something to you very very here here's a quote in the original seed he said here's the secret the word is in the bride they have and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does have his name and she has thus saith the lord amen it's it's already a finished work unbelievably that means we left internet connection oh okay it's all right we are going to replace your computer i'll go ahead and start you john 12. now let's just uh uh read a few scriptures here 21 and then i'm going to maybe you can come out and bring that out and just uh be careful he said here here the same before philip was uh from galilee and he desired him saying sirs we would see jesus we would see jesus and philip came and told andrew and andrew this was jesus disciples and philip and he told jesus oh stan you can stand out farther from the pulpit out farther so he can go behind it and jesus answered him and saying he said the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified now he's going to be glorified in us this morning and you you are she you are she right right now watch 24 and he said verily verily i say unto you no this is christ jesus talking he said except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if it will die it'll bring forth much fruit and he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life you know when our our our prophet brought many nuggets when he was ministering see see you already have deity i showed you that deity's already living in you you don't have to come and ask for your healing you already have the purchased possession our prophet showed us the thing he said if you were hungry and you needed a loaf of bread and he said well how much is the loaf of bread and back then it was 25 cents and he said i give you the 25 cents he said you'll have just as much revival and just as much happiness and just as much fulfillment with the 25 cents as you will with the loaf of bread because you have the purchase and power to go whenever you want and you can go into any store complete freedom and you can buy a loaf of bread and you know well very well that you have that power now that's exactly the same as you this morning you don't have to think i wonder if god will heal me you you'd have to have failure in believing the money that was paid the the the price that was paid which in this case it wasn't money it was calvary his blood amen you have the purchase power to believe your loved ones will be saved you have the purchase power to believe that you're going to make it he shows i'm going to show you later on the rapture is already completed you say well i'm praying i hope i can go in the rapture our prophet said it's already completely finished you know some places he said the rapture's inside you now he said sometimes one place he said it's ongoing now other places many places he said it's completely finished now but you'll hear ministers come up and say get ready for the rapture well yes you have to have the baptism of the holy ghost to go in the rapture that's for sure but if you have the baptism of the holy ghost listen to me church if you have the baptism of the holy ghost you are already ready for the rapture you don't have to get ready it's already happened you could no more be lost than god could be lost amen i want to show you something and a prophet preached about corn and wheat and showed you through the church ages you know but god was the grain of corn amen he was just one seed the church wasn't very big but this is deity jehovah god and god's saying when the people came to see him he said there's jehovah god but god created you because he was lonely right because he was lonely and he said now i'm going to stay lonely unless i'm willing to die on the cross and pay the price of redemption for the elect and the bride i'm going to stay lonely a long time but jehovah god was willing to send his son and pay the price of redemption for you and me so he wouldn't be lonely no more but he wants you his plan was that you would look exactly deity this is deity it hasn't died yet it has one's the cross that's exactly deity now let me ask you was that christ talking in the bible was that god that said he was a corn of wheat right so he's the corn of wheat and he got planted and he comes through seven church ages but he comes through some major messengers that let them out through the churches come you know there man and the first one that was coming back after all the dark ages was luther and luther was these leaves and you'll see the bottom ones are starting to dry up because around a long time and they're the farthest from the presence of god but luther was salvation now you'll see they still have life in them and when the when the power of god moves the wind blows them and then the next one that came up see we can't get rid of salvation you have to accept your salvation it's already before you just have to accept it amen and then came wesley and sanctification because god will never fill a dirty cop and wesley came and sanctification and he was a little higher up the the the the time the plant of history because see it was jehovah god that started in the bottom it was jehovah god that died in the bottom deity deity and so deity come up and he give you salvation through luther but luther still smoked the pipe had lots of issues in his life then wesley came up and he was set aside for purpose a holiness and a clean life and then we see that pentecost come up and it was the baptism it was pentecost come up and it was the restoration of the gifts and you know when pentecost came up it was the last move before the outpouring the baptism of the holy ghost it was the last move before the authority of holy ghost and you know when it first come up and even still now it looks like seed huh it looks like seed and somebody's well like i i'm speaking in tongues i i'm prophesying and that's it i'm the seed of god right there just look like seed but none of this is going in my combine bin it looked like seed it was all part of god's plan and so we don't get rid of salvation and we don't get rid of the sanctification and we don't get rid of speaking in tongues or prophesying or shouting or running the house but we're but but but have we reached deity yet is that deity it's not quite as big as deity but now something happened from pentecost to deity and can you see it you can't see it a prophet preached the invisible union of god talked about the invisible god but we in the flesh we want to look to a holy hill a holy priesthood a holy bishop a holy five-fold ministry a holy husband and we want to look down on but how do we get from speaking in tongues and prophecy that when it first come out it actually look when it was coming up we said oh that's it we've arrived that's it but we're building a house we turn corners and we realize that when we check the seed the seed wasn't as big up here so we want to get exactly to deity right because the deity started there right and so when the deity died it said what did it say in the scripture maybe we could pull it up he said let's go back when he said unless he barely say unless the corner weak fall in the ground and die it abides alone now if you look in this ground here you're not going to find the seed no more now i i didn't have time this morning to undo that ground and find the seed but i'll promise you by next sunday if you want to wash that off that you ain't going to find nothing that looks like deity but that all started from deity and you're all in this plant but but but i want to ask you again i said now that looked like like pentecost looked like the seed but we realized with a closer look it wasn't the seed and something happened from pentecost something has to happen from pentecost to bring us back to the seed you know our prophet taught do you know who our prophet had to go to before his ministry started do you know who god judged him for when his when he listened to his wife and his mother-in-law because he talked bad about those people our prophet had to go and get the baton from pentecost to carry on the movement of god and that's why he was sent to the he wasn't pentecost but he had to and pentecost was going into denomination and they said the pentecost was saying we've arrived we're seed and god had to send a messenger and go to pentecost and pick up the baton and carry on but do you see the baton do you see the message do you even see jehovah god yet do you see what made jehovah god it's a mystery it was a mystery and it was on veil to those that would hear it and accept it it was better yet it was unveiled to those that were in his plan it was unveiled to those who were predestinated there's no more condemnation to those that are in christ jesus amen now maybe somewhere on this stock see jesus said i'll abide alone so when he died he knew he wouldn't be alone but we ain't found them yet is it over of course it's not over but what got god back to god there was a mystery but in the natural i can tell you what it was it was called poland there was invisible polar that came from pentecost the germinated seeds it's like predestination can you see pre-the nation where is it can you see the call that they're called and chosen justified and already glorified see you are living we're preaching a wrong message i don't mean let me like i mean the people in many cases i don't mean the message is wrong don't misunderstand me you are already glorified we're still praying for glorification the bible says we're already going fresh romans 8 says those that you chose called justified glorified it's history and god's saying i did everything for you history now felix maybe you can come up and help us find jehovah again i know you don't know where to look but just give it a good idea and pull her back so we can see jehovah yeah go ahead you can pull them open pull the right oh right to the right to the meat of the thing so a little deeper a little deeper a little deeper right to the cup there we go just go right in there okay oh okay that's good yeah that's good that's good look at that pull that side down you all see that there's deity again how did that get there invisible union of christ deity now i want to point out one other thing a couple other things do you see any difference in any of the kernels of car they all look identical all in nice rows it's not a big you know kingdom here with a a palace and a pulpit on it or there's no like king chair they're all all the kids that died in birth or infancy they're all there they look identical to all the fat preachers and the prophets they're all identical deity all the same with jesus and the visible union the world will never see her they'll never figure it out because it was invisible because you were in the mind of god god through predestination made it happen and nobody can figure this out doctors and scientists and everybody say how in the world can this rot and bring that now look at how many more of that is on that i want to show you something else and this is for us all you know we live in a rural area and you say well you know there's not as many people here and so there won't be as many in charge let me show you something i got this stock on a thinner part of the field where the guy driving the planter went a little wide on the headlamp and there was just a little bit bigger space for my shovel to go in so the stock was maybe four inches apart from the next stock and all the stocks that were living in a rural area and were thinner produced two cops because they had more deity and they had more fruit because see when the deity fell on the ground they were able to get more water and they brought forth and so if you were living in toronto in a crowded area you just had one cob maybe not as big because the other competition was eaten for the same water huh so it's no excuses why we don't witness and bring people to christ because see you have a bigger drink of water and so you can push out more deity huh any difference all the same i feel like maybe you can go get the fan status you can go to your seat for a minute you can go to your seat think it's felix just turn the fan on the corn here just turn the fan on the corner you'll see how in other church ages see turn it on high push the back button see they're still alive they still they have lots of life but it ain't deity thank you and then in time just like the bottom cubs already fell on its own them all fallen humility they become hard just like the deity did in the beginning you can put this back in the office amen so how how the world could we make a difference from deity and deity you see delight is already in you the power of god is already in you there ain't no big eyes and no little use sisters aren't below brothers and kids aren't below dads not in deity different position different position but even as parents watch how you treat your kids husbands and wives watch how you treat each other brothers and sisters deity what you do is deity see you have the purchase price so it's not like it's going to happen it's already happened i'm not going to get saved i already am saved i'm not going in the rapture i'm already in the rapture it's already happened i'm not going to be healed i've already been healed it's regardless of what your body feels like he said you're just waiting if you're waiting for healing this morning you are just waiting for that stiff body to come back together it has nothing to do with it being there if your hands stiff or your back stiff you're just waiting for the manifestation but it's already happened if you're waiting for your loved ones to get saved amen you've cut all you got to do is claim it accept it you you said well i can't see it it's just waiting for the manifestation the manifestation's going to catch up see see watch this this deity this deity hadn't manifested the whole stock yet and it took a process for that to come back into deity and but when this deity died it was already paid that was already paid in that stock but it hadn't come out in evidence yet all you had to do is be patient but don't doubt don't go dig this seat up don't hurt the plan you say what but i i seen the leaves come up and so i dug it up because i didn't see deity i didn't see my loved ones get saved so i threw them in the garbage because i didn't see see it was a process it was happening you said to wait the rapture it's happening it's already happened you don't have to man it's already happened it's already yours it's already done oh that's beautiful thank you lord jesus it's so so amazing the all these things i'm saying there's in the scriptures let me let's just look at some scriptures that are here amen so your family is already saved is acts 16 31 maybe we can pull that out acts 16 through 6 he said it's already done he said if you can believe for you and your household praise god that's acts 16 38 rapture the rapture has already happened revelations 8 1. revelations 8 1 there's therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus you're praying to go in the rapture it's already happened it's already history see see how the different style is all you're doing is just waiting for the manifestations you say but i still see i'm i'm too heavy to go in the rapture no i'm just waiting for my glorified body to pick me up it's history amen if you're in christ you know you must be born again to be in this state amen look at this uh uh let's go to 14 and revelation romans 8. romans 8. for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and he foreknew he also did predestinate and conform to the image the exact image of his son hallelujah to them he's also glorified so we jump from 14 to 29 and 30 in romans 8. deuteronomy 31 6 be strong and courageous and fear not for nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he is both with thee he is he is it that is both to go with thee and he will not fail thee nor for safety and of course hebrews 13 5 he said he has said i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee see it's already happened and you know many times as believers because we have our eyes on a holy hill or a holy church or a holy priesthood we lack faith we lack faith and so we operate our christian walk all in fear god never ever intended that god never ever intended that when moses came to god when the children of everest were leaving he said why why are you coming to me he said just speak just speak it's time that we start recognizing the deity of christ in our lives start speaking amen god help us god help us let's look at some of those other quotes that i sent you ricky just in closing here calling jesus on the scene i believe i sent that to you now the invisible god here he's calling jesus on the scene at 63 he said now the invisible god identifies himself in you and you are the temple and you are his body the temple of the holy spirit and in that in that paragraph he's got invisible mention like six times maybe i didn't send that to you okay i just want you to see this you see you know i'm not making this up man i believe it's good we got another one uh 63 awakening jesus here in in 203 says and you might be able to open your eyes and see him well here let's start again he said certainly he lives it's he said that's the thing that you bump into from time to time he said that's the thing that condemns you when you do wrong he said that's the thing that makes you believe he said that's him he said you might be able to open your eyes and see him because he's in the spirit form that's the invisible god might not be able to open your eyes and see him he said that's the visible god but he dwells with among the visible people making himself invis visible by his promises in the word to the people do you understand can you not get up oh love to buy you a new phone amen i'm just going to read some of these quotes here and we'll close the rapture he said and hiding himself in simplicity he said how do you do how do you know the rapture is not going on all the time he said first thing you know it'll come to pass and one will disappear here and one will disappear there hallelujah he said here and that that he that is within you he said about your sickness he said the price is already paid everything has already been healed and your sickness says that he said that's right and every one of you is forgiven but you just have to accept it he said everyone is healed but you just have to accept it now to prove it he's the same yesterday today and forever if he's standing here to heal you he said at all with your unbelief he said he would have you would have to believe it just the same as you do now amen the rapture even the rapture is already completed this is surged when you see jesus the work of redemption for your soul and your body is complete and even the rapture is already completed but jesus rose from the day god justified by your faith believing that god rose we are waiting for the rapture but it's already complete just waiting for the manifestation hallelujah lord show us the father in 86 he said don't resent that he said that's the truth well here let me go up farther he said what are we he said that's the way christians is today we are planted together in christ jesus who is the exhaust exhaustible inexhaustible foundation of life we are planted in christ jesus and you just drink up and that receives the baptism of the holy ghost you're planted in christ hallelujah the holy ghost the baptism yes sir everything you have need of in your life journey even the rapture is already in you then he said don't resent it he said that's the truth the rapture is in us now and we'll prove it by the gospel for them whom he justified he has glorified then in heaven today we are as glorified in the presence of god right now and i'm pushing out to it amen glor god in his word do you believe it and many look away to immortal clay here here we're just going to close with a couple of these talking about how all the cobb looked exactly the same he said many look away to mortal clay of a servant and maybe they look to him and may they look to him the omnipotent who is we know the lord that we are finite no matter who we are we are still mortal but not but not the messenger but the message god granted lord that's where we point to jesus christ the son of god grant that he will be so real to every one of us today the absolute to the entire congregation we must do in our lives when we see him that we we see only him and not some bishop and not some great man or something that we take a pattern of but we look to jesus christ not some organization or not some pope or not some archbishop or clergy clergy or some divine man that we call on earth but we must look to jesus christ for he alone is our word amen let's stand god help us god help us this day remember the serpent that moses raised up in the i believe it was moses raised up in the wilderness the very thing that god created for the people to be healed and saved the prophet had to tear down because they worshiped the very same thing amen see we're always looking for a vis a visible god if you want to look for a visible god look to each other amen but god is the spirit and says he's invisible and so that's the reason our faith is shaken because we're looking and i'm sure that thing next sunday lord willing amen god help us to see how god brought us and so see how we would change we would get sick and say and and i mean i understand when we pray for him we're praying to that god will raise our faith and accept our healing but see how when we come into maturity we can change we just say i'm sick it's lying vanity look at look at when he was in the whale was all lying vanity i'm a son of god i can no more be sick than man all you had to do was just accept it you're sick you don't have to pray and ask god for your healing say god i accept my healing it's already done you got unsaved loved ones say god i've accepted them into the fold they're part of my household it's already done lord i'm praying i go on the rapture i accept the rapture it's already done it's inside me man is that a different way of thinking deity deities not in heaven it's in you hallelujah hallelujah amen i don't care what you came to do but i can't i don't know what you came to do i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise [Music] [Laughter] yes i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord [Music] i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord [Music] one more time i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord i don't know what you came to do but i came to phrase a love i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord i lived [Music] lord jesus we love you this morning just thank you for the opportunity to be here lord and all the saints that are here we bless them and lord help us to recognize that you're not a god in a faraway place or you're not a god that's only in somebody else but not in us but if we've received the baptism of the holy ghost and a new birth lord jesus deity is tabernacled right in our bodies lord jesus god just raise our faith and help us to recognize the day and the hour we're living in we give you the glory and honor for it in your name we pray amen god bless you
