and uh we certainly love that you all and just have a real appreciation I'm just getting some bounce back here girls amen we had an amazing wonderful trip and just praise God for his safety and and all these things I'm just going to read a scripture and then we'll um I uh got notes to preach but we have a lot of pictures I'd like to show you the pictures I believe it's part of the ministry and part of the many were not able to come today different reasons I mean Jordan Vanessa are gone and Max was planning on being here and and neighbor had a barn fall down on a bunch of cattle and from the snow load and so he's uh putting cattle to sleep this morning and different things but uh God knows amen and so we might actually talk about this not just today but next Sunday also Max was telling Jared he said oh I hope dad don't get done everything this Sunday but God knows it man amen so God knows everything I mean let's turn to Matthew 25 and we're just going to read a few scriptures there and just take our texts amen and of course you know that the commission that we have is to go into all the world and preach the gospel amen God gave that to us also with the baptism and and communion and foot washing and but I want to read this scripture and if I'm when I'm talking this morning this is in no way to I just want to clarify even before I read the scripture about your 25 31 Amy this is in no way to put a burden on anybody financially at all this is that's not the purpose of God at all and but it just it you know uh Pastor Jose said something when we were gone that was very true he said we are we in North America are living in how did he say that we're living in deceit we're living we're living at we're living a dream that's not reality we're we're not we're not uh we're not connected amen and and my message this morning was see we know that we're part of God and we came from God and God said that no man ever hated its own body but we're one body and so if your little toe hurts you this morning or your ear your whole body will concentrate on that pain but we don't do that spiritually but we flat out do not do that we fly down we say well God didn't Place me there we justify ourselves bitterly amen God didn't Place me there I'm not in that situation I can't help the world you know God didn't call me for these things man and God didn't but God called you to change your world your environment the people you touch remember I clarified I'm not out for your money this morning I'm not out at all for that but if the body hurts you know the Bible says in these scriptures he said when one weeps we all weep when one rejoices we all Rejoice but we don't do those things because we're in our own focused world amen and so the body of Christ lives very differently than us we went to Pastor's houses that were 100 percent mud we went to churches his church was 100 percent mud except the tin on the roof and I'll show you in the video it's mud floor and they took their shoes off when they come into church not to get the mud dirty now that's that's like Supernatural amen but that's part of the body amen and how are we going to get all I would express to you is how are we going to get to heaven as the bride of Christ and some people get there and maybe die of starvation literally and brother Dale get their fat and we're all going to be one beautiful body wow I've never affected so much by traveling as there was this time possibly because the wind was with me but let me read this scripture and and we'll just show the video and or the pictures and video and we'll never finish we'll probably finish next week and then sometime I'll preach whether it's a week or two from now amen but let's read uh Matthew uh here and we're going to read to uh wherever my iPad ghostly man and when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with them then so he sit down upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all the nations and shelters and he shall separate them one from another as the Sheep as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left and then shall the king say unto them on his right hand cometh ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world Hallelujah next verse some counting on yemi for I was hungry and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink and I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me and I was sick and you visited me and I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord wind saw we thee hungry and fed thee or when thirsty and I gave thee drink now this is Christ himself talking and when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked or clothed thee God himself talking next verse below or whence all we the sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you that in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren that's the body ye have done it unto me personally because see we came from him and we're a part of him amen amen let's see how far it went here let's a couple more verses here Amy so we're going to go to 45 I believe it is then Joey say unto them on the left hand depart from me you curse it into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungry and you gave me no meat and I was thirsty and you gave me no drink and I was a stranger and you took me not in I was naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they say an answer unto him saying Lord when saw we thee hungry see God has to God can't judge somebody without them understanding the judgment and when saw we hungry and thirst and or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and we didn't misery taunt you see these people believed that they would have did it for Jesus and then shall he answer and say unto them verily verily I say unto you that in as much as ye did it not to the one of the least of these you never did it to me Lord Jesus we ask you Jesus said your blessing to this word and may you just be with us as we Minister your word this morning in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats I just want to read a couple more scriptures just to lay a foundation we're just going to go right into the scriptures and I want to just tell you a little thought here you know I was you know studying and putting these notes together and stuff and you know there's a saying that says you know the entire water of the ocean or sea cannot sink a ship unless you let the water in the ship and the entire influence of evil and sin of this world cannot sink the body of Christ unless you let that in your Shepherd amen don't matter you can't justify and say well you know this or that the world's changed that so you can't justify it unless you let it in you and then you sink you can get prepared it all you know John 3 13 I'm just going to read two verses two scriptures here John 3 13 says no man Ascend us up to heaven but that first he came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven now and you know that's a great mystery but that's here's Jesus talking about you're not going to live eternally unless you were already eternal unless you're not going to be with God for in heaven unless you came from God and you can even ask Google that because nothing lives eternal has no beginning and the only thing that never had a beginning was God himself amen last scripture here is Ephesians 5 32 and here's Jesus here's uh Paul talking about a marriage between a husband and wife and he's going into all the detail how the wife and the husband and and all this and Christ the head of the church and all this and then if and then in 32 and this is a great mystery marriage is a great mystery if you look down it straight in the natural that's not really much of a mystery that's just a man and wife fallen in love but he told all that to say but I speak concerning Christ and his church that was Christ Falling in Love with this church amen amen well we apologize for maybe being hardly on time and uh I I thought Vicki could just plug the phone into the hundreds of pictures we have but she had to send them through Facebook to be able to share them and Vicki if we put the pictures on the screen we I want you to catch the screen so turn the camera for brother Jim and brother Jim was unable to be here because of sister Linda and he tried to get somebody and he could not that wasn't an option even the church just offered to help him if he gets somebody and so brother Jim will share when he is able to be here like I don't know if you can catch a screen and me both okay um and uh I have a new respects for uh brother Bernard and sister Ruth because it it is uh I never had it affect me the same is it's it's different coming from a place like let me give you an example I woke up at 3 30 this morning four o'clock this morning was noon time Leo was finishing his message and you know like since I've come home every day I'm just totally thinking well they're here and this person's here and they're in the market and they're and it really messes with your thoughts and your pattern just tremendously unbelievably but uh because we love those people brother Bernard has family there churches friends bride of Christ and it's it's very different very very different I come home and I was like oh if I was there man it's very very different it you can't explain it you have to experience it it's just not so this is us when we left and uh brother Jim and and Pastor Jose went with us and uh I will I will I will share things these brothers we had a wonderful time together and they you know it's it's just uh you just have to take my word for this it's just different when you actually see it this trip was totally different for me because the wind was there and when you see it as a couple it's just very very different amen I didn't have to explain to Luanne why I got rid of as much money as I did because she's seen it amen This Is Us Just Landing we landed in Uganda and the people that were helping get our bags off the thing were already begging us for money I said I haven't got no Uganda Shillings yet and he said well you can go exchange your U.S money right there but there was people that would help you in the airport that they were already selling you they were hungry it was just overwhelming man this is a poor picture because it's midnight but their sister Oliver beside Luanne and brother Jose of course and this was the very worst part of the trip when we got picked up at the airport I was the most stressed on this part of course we were very tired we'd been in the air for 17 18 hours in the air we'd been in a plane for 20 hours and we'd been traveling for 30 30 hours and over there it's not safe to drive after night amen totally not and we probably almost got killed a hundred times from the airport to the to the brother leels the first night and I'd already told Leo Pastor Leo that we would not travel after dark and that was the only time we traveled after dark we made all our planes around literally half the vehicles on the road have no lights or reduce lights and and they drive very very aggressively especially overtaking they call it overtaking but it's called passing so they will pull out at night with no lights and overtake a vehicle and you're expected to disappear or have a head-on collision that's just that's just standard opportunity for them amen so we got there uh late late on the Friday very late like like I went to sleep at four o'clock in the morning the 4 30. very late if you call that sleep I woke up very early we wake up to the different noises and stuff and brother Jim was preaching I think about nine o'clock and so when me and sister Luanne walked to church like go back to the other picture Amy um that's a minute that's part of the ministers that's just the ministers that they could fit on beside the platform that would have been like sitting right there um Pastor Leo's actually going to give me the list but there was over 70 pastors president 70. that's like mind-blowing and of course that's not all the first rows are pastors so we can go on um the church is very very beautiful very very full so me and sister Luanne we walked to church I believe the first or Leo picked us up we walked back after but they had uh you're going to see pitchers after they had literally two tents beside the church and two in front of the church and they had speakers literally as high as my head sitting on the ground massive speakers so everybody in Michiana heard the messages including the the all the denominational churches around we would walk from from an enroll and as soon as you left enroll you'd say well that's who's preaching you could already hear him uh when we went home to shower you'd have to go home and shower because very hot so when you were done preaching you just were soaked like so um there we just go okay we can go through them uh quicker um I I went through these pictures multiple times to delete okay this is I'm singing a special sister Oliver and some of the local sisters saying one special right before I preached uh of course the the ministers are in the front there this is actually after the service the anointing ministering is like just unbelievable Amy just wait back up let me see what was before okay that's us okay this is at the end of the church and so we're under a tent brother Jim's under a tent with that's an evangelist Isaac there and uh the ministers all ate together so the ministers had their own food line and their own tent which was packed that little building in the back with a little vent on it is their washrooms for the church um what they call washrooms um and uh then we'll show you where the other people ate of course we went and miggled with everybody uh after we ate um this is that's a poor picture but that's showing a big bucket this was amazing they cooked all the food for hundreds and hundreds of people and Not only was there a lot of food but it was some of the best rice I've ever tasted in my life and I'm going to show you pictures that'll blow you away they were they were cooking the rice with logs as big as my leg and they just said a kettle see how the brick are there they just set a kettle over that and they would cook for five to seven hundred people amazing and of course it's 100 degrees over there and so when you're sitting on a blazing fire you're going to see the fire it's like it's 200 degrees and then many many people these are showing out by the kitchen area we can go through them a little okay this shows you an idea of the kettles like the one Kettle there would have been close to the top the ring line would have been brown beans knockout brown beans like we're not just talking about quantity of food we're talking about the best food you've ever ate in your life uh we actually hoarded the brown beans to take them to Pastor Leo's so we could eat them after so this wasn't stuff that you didn't want to eat this was stuff that you were plotting to eat like Pilates to eat this is I'm serving the the Brethren and you can see here the line and the tent this is the side door of the church this is the side door of the church and the tents are on the side where people would sit and listen mainly uh older people or mothers and kids and that but you can see the lines way back to the front of the church it'll disappear and they're going through the line there um this is a short video I think of them painting it's not very clear oh it's clear to you um you can just let it go it's very short I think that's actually uh them just working also I show you the expectation it's just a different world and I'm just I'm rambling but I'm trying to get you to experience what we experience okay that's a different one we shut that off that's Junior's house so you can stop that video um the the the pastor with the clay house and church um they had they had fasted for four days fasted and prayed for four days for the meeting and uh Pastor Leo told me the meeting started on on Saturday morning brother Jim was first speaker and they were still painting the church on Thursday night and people were showing up to for meeting on Thursday night so they had somebody actually preach on Friday not expected but people would show up like two days early just because in expectations amen Pastor Leo or Pastor Jose said you know I preached Saturday morning and Sunday morning and Pastor Jose said something to me after I preached he said brother Dale he said it's something about an evangelist he said you were an evangelist he said I said I don't think you looked at your notes one time it's just that's just the way it is that you just come up you read a verse and it just was boom it's just it was just a wonderful wonderful experience are we back on schedule um is there South this is [Music] this is very early so people are still showing up there's uh the church is not packed when it was prime time it was when one person moved everybody moved this would have been right before I ministered the uh the brother that I actually interpreted for me used to live in Michiana with Leo he now is at uh uh your church brother Bernard Speckled Bird church he moved for work in that but he is an amazing interpreter best interpreter I ever seen in my life he was just a machine gun very very awesome interpreter we can move on uh different pictures okay here's here's it shows you the amount of kettles and these barrels they actually washed our food in I'm sorry I'm not a professional video camera that'll be our cow there they would cook all day Friday Saturday and Sunday all day this was multiple there was probably 30 plus people that were involved in cooking or washing dishes alone it was a major ordeal to war six or seven hundred plates or hundreds and hundreds of plates literally they uh these bananas they use the banana leaves as kind of like Lids to go over the food we can go to the next one that's just a video of the people going through the line [Music] it's actually uh there was two sisters there one had a one sister had a short leg and one sister had a big wound on her and I sent Luanne to investigate with the sisters the one sister had been born that way the other sister actually we found out after was had was diagnosed with cancer but she had a she had an open wound probably about that size rate between her knee and her calf right there uh that just of course her whole leg is swelled up in North America they would never came to church but she would come for the whole services and get prayed for and that this is where they fed the ministers this was just a different food line so there's actually uh was at least two food lines that was one of the main Cooks the brother from the church that's his mom beside him it's the moment you're going to go back in there you see that's the kettle that that that that that kettle's like two and a half three feet across and it's a good foot deep or longer that's right full of rice that was the best brown rice you've ever eaten so there's a couple houses that are are beside the church this is they're right beside just the pictures didn't go through fairly this was a house that had been for sale it's rape it faces the church the Sunday School rooms are very very close there but the the Neighbors in those houses are very very friendly very hugely friendly it's a good thing because we almost overtook them when we were gone um these are you're going to see this is a Sunday school room this building is what they call the Sunday School rooms and this little boy is a special boy but just go back one picture there no there okay see the doorway there in every place in Africa they hang they leave the doors open and hang a curtain uh but one of Leo's deacons that's homeless lives in the Sunday School room and if you go to the next pitcher that's his boy and I had a picture of him on my camera from when we were there three years ago amen we were able to change their situation a little bit and uh we actually I'll tell you a story you can keep going through the pictures and I'll tell you a story about this family that's a family of six I believe it was they have no house they live in the Sunday School room and her husband is older you can just keep going through them it's them are all short videos I'm sure and so the the the the part about the story is uh Satan came along uh tabernacled in a woman and was telling these people uh what are you doing uh living caretaking for the church for free now they were living in the Sunday School rooms for free because they're actually homeless this is right out in front of the Sunday School rooms that's a makeshift that's the roughest shed you've ever seen in your life but to the the okay that's their front door that's their front door which is supposed to be a Sunday school room and a family of six live in it now they have they have less than zero money and the the mother of that family sister had a daughter and she put her out so they just claimed the daughter as their own and so now they have a bigger family with less money because they didn't have enough money to take care of their own kids but the bride never takes they never had nothing for their own kids but they still take in more amen anyway so this devil came along and the sister and was telling these brother that interpreted for me the first time I went seven years ago um told these people said what are you doing caretaking for uh that the brother that's Pastor Vincent the brother on the far right or the farthest away from me is the brother that has a mud Huts Mud House and a mud Church um anyway in the process of building Pastor Leo's church and the construction this family that lived in the Sunday School room did all the cooking and housing and and stuff for all the workers and they actually watched all the construction stuff and steel and they were like the caretakers guards and Cooks all for free and so Satan had came into this person and told them they said what are you doing doing all this work and cooking and that for free and you're not getting nothing from the church and we were able to change your situation greatly when we were there and after we did that Pastor Leo told us on the way to the airport that God had passed their debts like when the children of Israel left Egypt then they took all the wealth of Egypt because they were slaves amen they had worked for a year or two with no money but when we were there there was actually a house by the church and Pastor Jose actually rented the house for the family and I was able to give we were able to give them a million and a half to start up a business and the the man needed a ruptree surgery and just put them on their feet and so they would be self sufficient also then that picture you'll see farther ahead these are all ministers a lot of the minister pitchers um you can just click through the pictures uh when we went when I actually the little boy that was in that picture when we were done eating I knew them and we were he was warming up to us and I asked him to show me his house I knew where they lived and I went in their house and there was a little boy uh boat like Lee or Curtis laying right on the cement floor just under a towel just like it was just a non-believable it looked worse than most of my barns like it was just just unbelievable situation I went and got Pastor Jose and I said hey I got something to show you and uh that was when we were able to change their situation so this is the sisters washing the dishes it was a major occurrence it don't look clean but it actually is clean the wash the dishes rinse them a couple times and then actually stack them on a rack so you can see the churches in the background then the bathrooms and they have the shed and the Sunday School rooms is on the side there how come we keep losing it's being ignorant yep more but you can see just Stacks and stacks of plates these are the the tents this is brother another one of Pastor Leo's Deacons actually his uh this Deacon uh Leo's daughter married his son um so this is a picture another angles of the church when we when you're there for the whole day sisters would go out and just lay on the grass away from the church just to lay with their baby and fall asleep you know with their baby in where this was my interpreter uh he was just amazing an amazing interpreter The Interpreter is really really important especially if you're under the anointing and it's going fast and it just really is an important thing when Pastor Leo or Pastor Jose preached for brother James that that was just amazing the last Sunday we were there uh they actually had two interpreters it's just really really really difficult yeah we got a video on this one this is the main toy of kids there they uh was

family that was staying in the Sunday School room Pastor Leo or Pastor Jose sorry paid their six months rent on that house and we are now uh they want to sell that property comes up against the church and we're just waiting for them to tell us what they want there's actually another house behind this one it looks like a chicken coop I'd call it a chicken coop and there's back bathrooms but uh I'm sorry these are scrambles but um so that's that's yeah that's good that's Leo or Jose paying the rent for the house This Is Us taking a picture in the house with the family of course this is like the first house they've had in years and years and years so uh they'll be quite this is their three of the younger kids and me and brother Jose are having a time of our life this is their main toys kids

very very fresh after I videoed them the older owner there wanted to see the video the guy wiping the fish you wanted to see how we did it so this is the market this this is good turn our volume on Leo took me in the market to buy things we needed and I went back and said we should get brother Jim and sister Luanne and show them what grocery shopping looks like there's volume to this hello it's Leo talking to his friend I'm asking Leo to buy red onions no buy an onion oh okay okay I was showing one of the sisters that we helped and her son how to make a BLT they didn't they most of those people never seen a toaster in their life they would look in the toaster and see the fire in the toaster we bought Leo atosa the last time we were there and see tomatoes are readily available they have everything for a BLT except the bacon nobody has bacon because nobody goes to a grocery store that sells bacon because you'd have to go to the Capitol but we showed them a BLT oh yeah yeah there's pictures yep you're going missing so it's the kids by the church playing making the church yard their home that's that Deacon that was in the Sunday School room okay now we're at the orphanage are we we're not missing any are we girls okay this is that your orphanage this is the water tank from the well the building in the back to where the kids used to sleep that's the last school room that we helped them build um Jose's work actually sent money with Jose to uh to put floors down in the orphanage or put Windows in so you're going to see Jose that's their school desk mud floor and uh this is the one they just built since we were there the foundation was it that was the first Schoolhouse we built for them when we went the first time and the one on the left was the second one we built and their house is Straight Ahead where the owners and the workers work live I mean they have six kids themselves now we're out in front and they're showing them the well the water well that's a focus point that water well we put in when we were there six years ago after we came home and that's the water well that the government seen all the people from The Jungle came and got water from and they said because you're letting people from the jungle Countryside get water we'll put electricity into your house for free so you can pump the water in the well so they got the wires to their house for free now they only have to pay for what they use Pastor Leo's hydro bill electricity bill for his house he was really complaining was three dollars and forty cents Canadian per month three dollars and forty cents per month uh I told them things were a little different here don't miss any if you can help it if we don't get done we'll do it later this is a pigs out front of the orphanage and the next picture I think Pastor Leo's going or Pastor Jose is going closer to investigate there's Pastor Jose and now he's teaching the kids they're very good education system uh there they were the kids were just finished and eating of course the main food is rice and Maize corn field corn or cassava oh they were eating beans there today well that was a blessing all mud floors if it looks like concrete it's not it might be concrete soon the different ones were filling out a visitor's book you know that's the kids at the church that's right this is still in the the market the food market we've got volume very important to have volume voice missed the whole video most of those people in that market would make less than a dollar Canadian all day if you had a regular job you make two dollars one dollar thank you ah wait thank you Pastor Leo showed me his receipt we might get to that or might not no he didn't work this much in February he actually showed me three pay stubs there's this brother Jim's sister and I want them to experience it uh going through the market too but for the month of February Oscar Leo made 100 and sixty seven dollars Canadian for the month and he's paid four times as high as the regular work like he's fourth in command I think at the T fact there's this sort the watches video that you'll see them sewn you played again I didn't see his feet move watch his feet move this is right out from Leo's house yeah that's amazing you see his feet move we went and bought uh clothes and linen in another town and there was just dozens of these sewing machines all pumped 100 Pump no electricity I said man we throw these out and they said man if you can get them to us they would just love us yep sound sounds important this is just going down the road to show you that the country is mountainous very mountainous mountains everywhere yeah I mean you just go through them fast these are the orphanage we won't listen to any videos in the orphanage the videos were just Jose given the money Jose had to have a video hey these people here these these kids in the orphaning just go back there they come up to give me that candy they would give you everything they have like those kids probably don't even have parents let alone money or candy this is right in front of Dale's Dale's and his wife there every between Luanne and Jose they'll run the school and the orphanage that's their house right behind it yeah he's he's like a trustee or something for brother Leo's church this is just the yard the kids were getting ready to leave this was Wednesday night in Leo's church and it looks empty and there's a reason why they had a torrential flood literally the hour before church I mean torrential flood there was Rivers running across the road it we almost had to snorkel to get out of the we were at the orphanage and there was water running across the road two feet wide and of course everybody comes to church on motorbike or walk so they would have had wet everything I think we've seen this one or it's a scene so Wednesday was a small service you're missing a video or not oh okay okay yeah that's uh this is Lumber and the Chinese are going to Uganda and cutting down taking a lot of the lumber and Leo wasn't happy about this this is Pastor Vincent go back to there the picture Pastor Vincent we just arrived at his church we're walking right up to the front door of his church to 100 clay the only thing that's not clay in that church is the tin on the roof there's brother Jim this is the way into this well other than the wooden door and what's holding the tin that's a house right beside the church Pastor Lee Jose going in the church this is the pastor in front of his pulpit if there's a video there's a video for this that's the sisters this is where they took off their shoes and so we all greeted them we weren't able to stay here and Minister because we were on the way to pastor sandes and I preached there on Thursday this was us leaving there will be a video here we're just right in front of the church there's a video I need sound need sound now sorry it just mixed up that's all sorry these pictures are scrambled a bit but that's just what we had so this is still back to the church there is videos here of the church we'll listen to that's Pastor Vincent at his house uh there's a path there up to his house yeah and well actually if you go back to there it's cassava and banana trees he lives he lives off the land his income is whatever ties he gets in that little church and whatever grows in that field and the rest he don't eat it's a different experience when we left that's his house when we left he sent us food with us we still have beans at our place from his house now you'll notice I when I was going through I literally erased as many pictures as what we're showing you that's his wife coming out of the house and you go back to that picture I wanted to show you something Keith they're as happy as can be they're happier than happy but they don't have one penny to their name and they're living in a mud hut that's their children two bedroom two room total two-room house probably 10 by 20. uh 100 percent mud yeah 100 percent much yep this is okay so we left there we left there this is on Thursday we we drove a long ways and we're at Pastor Sandy's and the the two pastors that were close to Leo and US was Pastor Vincent and Pastor Sande were both with us when we had the accident three years ago and both are poor that's Pastor Sandy's church but they had these are other pastors that were there local close pastors and there's many many many many many people there and so there's a story behind this they're just it's it's a just completely different experience and I I I'd have to apologize to Leo and then I would be hard on them and then I'd have to apologize on them but when we're going to this place we arrived four hours late and like I just I just laid the line up I said Leo I don't arrive no place four hours late but you get here to these people and they're just like praising it's a four-hour worship service they're just thrilled you show up I preach for two hours boom like you were four hours late your point to the chalkboard brother Jose we don't have to watch this at the orphanage we don't have to watch this uh I asked Pastor Jose I said you know if you invited me to preach and I showed up four hours late for service I said how would it go and he said well maybe I would still be here Dale but there there's 200 people sitting under a tarp in the sun 100 degrees you show up four hours late because you're the roads are bad traffic's bad and we stopped at the other Pastor's house we probably had drove this is Pastor Sandy's mom oh yeah yeah that's his mom and he's an old man already so oh yeah yeah okay this is going by his house it's just it's just unbelievable I mean it's it's uh this is actually standing this is Vincent but we're at Pastor Sandy's house and that was his first house which was mud we're out front um you didn't show me many pictures of the when we got to his house there were sisters there that he came over from the church to sing um yeah we're from the community they're singing I mean really singing and this is uh them just giving us some drinks everybody wants okay this is a chicken that's a chicken in the house hatching eggs you don't chase it away or the neighbor might take your egg and this is Pastor Sandy Vincent is down in the white striper shirt we're in his house tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny now they have a cement house but their mud house is right beside the it's my house this was when we left there there was a public school and uh I rolled down the window and when they seen a fat white person they had a stampede to the fence literally a stampede to the fence back in the orphanage you can go through this one we're kind of done the orphanage okay this brother here actually just leave that there you just give me this here you see his eyes it's because he's never seen himself in the camera before ever in his life taking a selfie of them one of Pastor Sandy's congregation that Pastor right there I would love to bring here just a fantastic brother wonderful brother this was a the motel we stayed uh on the way to on Thursday we're halfway to James's house we're four or four or five hours from leels and so we went and preached on Thursday at Sundays and we went to Vincent's church and we come back and we stayed in this motel and so we're eating at night and it's very different but so when you order fish you get the whole fish head and eyes and tail and brother Bernard knows what that's like but it's very different for us there was tons and tons and tons of food I don't remember what these rooms were but they weren't very much that's right you're doing good girls this is a gym drinking a Coke out of a glass jar oh now we've seen that one already that's the orphanage we don't need to go there right there yeah we'll go there yep so it's at the restaurant or the motel there was a sad thing this well I took this picture to see you can't really see but this is a very fancy motel but they just have a really botchy roof on the top of that square thing it's just tin and boards and it looks like something on a barn that's just about ready to fall down on a brand new Motel okay this year it was a sad part of the trip I mean for me it was this was the World Health Organization there there's a bunch of robbers and they're spending all the world tax money driving around Uganda to needle people so they'll die and this was all their brand new trucks that they drive I'll show you a lot more yeah these are all the trucks and there's their emblem for the devil they're not there to help the people they're there to kill the people this was a food buffet in the line and just more driving okay on the way to James's we're getting close to the national park and so the bamboo and the monkeys are right on the road there bamboo we're actually passing um okay okay the one there that's out to the king in that region they still have Regional Kings they really have no National Power but they are respected hugely this is we're going to James where Jose preached there the last Sunday we're there and and we're close to the national park and this was a prison that Leo actually had worked in before he he was pastor and started the church so these uh prisoners are on the side and I took a picture and Leo thought one of the guards had seen me and they weighed me over they're very private with any yeah they're very private with stuff like that you're going to see more coming yeah that we don't need to see that Amy move on um like these prisoner ones they don't want you to take videos and show them internationally cases you know they think you're mistreating them or anything like that okay you can go um so Leo had actually thought they'd waved them over but if they did we just went on and that so uh it's a river there even by when we come out of the park there was a bridge there's a bridge this is a motel by Pastor James where we preached the last Sunday there was a bridge outside the park and it's actually guarded with soldiers and they'll take your camera if you take a picture of it and they by this just sounds ridiculous to me but they think because I take a picture that I'm going to send it to Putin and Putin's going to go over and bomb the bridge so they don't want nobody to take a picture of it to do the location and I mean it was just a bridge that would be on a back Gravel Road it was it was like nothing it's nothing this was somebody in the thing gave Luana toothbrush and a toothpaste new these uh girls actually gave us their what's up it shows you affect the thatched roofs are for the for the water and now we're at the park we're gonna go through the park fast Amy if you buy Treasures in the park we'll watch a video of the elephants that's when we'll watch really sorry the pictures got scrambled when we went to the in this tree the Lions had just did a kill and there was two lions up in this tree and so we could actually see them better than you can see them in the picture but you can see them move their feet and wagged their tail and moved their head and the the turkey buzzards were eating what was left over from their Kilt they normally eat uh Pig wild pig because it's sweet planes bamboo monkeys are everywhere three oxy are just headed to the park to see we're going to the park we're going to see uh baboons in the water yeah do we have skipped this part that's just the orphanage man it really scrambled the pictures terrible it's unbelievable sorry yeah it was just Majestic to see the elephants they're waiting to cross the road yeah and they passed just 10 15 feet from us just was just Majestic I mean we're just like I'm as close to me and Matt to those elephants are just yeah these are those trees are cactuses they grow like a white oak when they fall down they look like a tree but they're 100 cactus they're really bushy that's a lake by the park there's the Lions that we can't see we'll keep going that video is the orphanage will skip it this was a bamboo the first bamboo before we went in the boat and it was raped that's the toilets to go so you'd go to the toilets you'd have to shake hands with the bamboo before you the hip or yeah sorry and he was all cut up because he had been in a war with other hipples we're paying for our boat here but right yeah we can just go through these fasts right before we get in the boat this is the lake we're going on this these uh Them Holes them holes in the the beach where birds nests see Pastor Leo and and the sister Oliver there they're my holes there's birds that would tunnel in the mud and live there you know greatness yeah we can skip this video okay we're having technical difficulties now water bottle flowing hippos live together and they're by the hundreds or thousands believe it or not I erased hundreds yeah yeah we've seen hundreds of pictures so we're on the boat so we can go very close to these animals matter of fact uh one hit the boat under like that came up underneath of it you were on we'll skip that video that's a bamboo baboons the monkeys hundreds hundreds of them on the shore in the park there there's a because I don't know why not now they're actually letting people move in the park to live and those were a fishing Community with all those boats there and that just showed the lake out there okay we don't need to see this video some money yep that's a women at the motel they give us their what's up numbers this is a motel where we got steak and sausage and you name it and bananas for breakfast you never had a meal without bananas this was it was like a courtyard Motel this was the dearest ones we stayed in 51 dollars for breakfast and air conditioning this was Pastor James's Church brother Jose preached there that's the last Sunday we were there and of course they had tents outside too we don't need to see this video you're back at the top I'm sorry this is so scrambled that's disappointing brother James's Church brother James has been here to Canada he's actually coming here this summer he's right we've heard him preach at John dankwas and so when we were at this church they were we went there I guess it wasn't that early but we had to leave there by around 12 because we were seven hours almost to the dot to get to Pastor leels um and we had to get there before dark because it's just not safe to drive oh my goodness these pictures are so scrambled unbelievable that's disappointing uh right there we'll play that video that's at brother Vincent's church [Music] you turn it up some [Music] okay [Music] is there a video up above that one no sorry oh I'm sorry yeah okay yeah so that's a family we were able to assist that's actually the money I give them this is a house we're looking at the house before we leave uh you're just going that's Pastor that's their water at the church and he's washing his hands right outside the bathroom just showing the country is very mountainous very rolly oh this was our doctor that was a wonderful experience so when I went you know I had to be tested negative to go to Uganda the hilarious part is the only two countries in the world that care about it was Uganda I had to have a negative test because we're not vaccinated in America the only reason I had to get tested to come home was we landed in New York uh wait you're I'm missing the doctor part uh go back to the doctor that's that's the doctor the dirt test and he wants to at least visit here if he can't we're gonna try to help him some but uh the only reason we had to get a test to come home was because we landed in New York the states is was so ignorant the most ignorant place we were in the whole trip was New York and all the flight attendants that were stationed in New York if you talk to Lauren yeah we're just ignorant just disgusting and it was just unbelievable and of course Luanne didn't have to be tested because she's an American so really out of everybody it was only me they had to get it tested but Canada don't care now and of course but anyway this doctor when they did the test here they do it up your nose they don't they don't go far or nothing now sometimes they'll let you do it yourself but there they just had a Q-tip and they just touched either side of your tongue and they just started to think here they needed 24 hours to get the results there he did that test we went to the motel and we had it or the mall we had the results in two hours it was unbelievable like like we're Advanced then they're like light years ahead of us you know it was like that doctor was just a what we wanted to hug him when we left he was really nice but now going there was a complete nightmare we if you ever go on a roundabout in Uganda in the capital city and around the boat the motorcycles drove so close to Leo's van that the engine of the motorcycle actually scrapped his van scraped his van like they just they just yeah it's just it's just you just have no hair left you either want to kill somebody or get killed yourself yeah this was just a sign of the thing this was we'll just go through that this is Leo's pay stubby actually showed me three months pay stuff we've seen this video there's other videos where maybe show the wonderful Jose if we get to it uh well yeah she'll show the oh we can listen to these um of the people uh [Music] you're gonna see my my name is Jim LeBlanc I'm French so it's good to be here take their shoes off the Lord was good to us okay there's another one of Pastor Jose if is that Jose going to get together with no time I'm gonna show you their shoes there's their shoes yourself I come from El Salvador in Central America it's just a little country in Central America yes [Music] to celebrate the dedication of the church [Music] when I found that out I gave Leo the money to give them all their money [Music] two orphanages and actually sent a computer with us to the orphanage and brother Dale said brother way it worked wonderful was fantastic they were using it before we left this is actually Pastor Vincent's house Pastor Vincent's house amen this little girl [Music] so yeah we'll just show a few of these pictures and then we'll shut it down here actually some of these Leo just sent me this morning just a few of these I haven't been sorted through but so on Sunday after we preached Sunday they had a baptism they actually had planned they had two people ahead of time tell them they were going to be baptized when they asked after we preached I think seven total I think seven came up after um and I baptized them and Leo has a tank there and I was just about to get in the band and they come out and they said we have a bunch more come up and I believe I counted in the pictures we won't probably get that far today but I believe we baptized 15 total on Sunday so they just there was going to be two done and then seven came and then when the seven got done there was like another nine or ten team we're showing some of these double actually there's a I want to see that yeah these two they're right tear them three bottom ones okay this is a sister actually uh uh brother James was here uh the last Sunday he never took a love gift and he told me to take some of the money to feed the people and some of the money half the money to give to whittles brother Leo's shown me here that he gave this to one of the widows here and this other one the next picture is uh that one there yep Leo actually walked up to her house we were going to go up to her house you can see the money in her hand there she was one of the very first Believers that was with Leo even when they started the church they actually started in her house and uh she's she's old geez lady is is over a hundred yeah over a hundred years old in church anyway that was love offerings from pastor um I don't think we need to watch that we can watch that if you want yeah or just we need sound just sounds we're just leaving here now good including that we can probably stop that video there girls I don't know if there's some other videos was there another video up above no up above up right what's that one that at the church well this yeah we'll watch this one [Music] they love you to come in their house and pray for their house bless their house and they all no matter if they they'll give you anything they'll never leave you it's not possible to leave a house without eating you have to eat okay we can move on you just you can't imagine how much um [Music] this is where Jose preached and Pastor James he's actually coming here in September um he's a full seven hours from Leo which he thinks very hard to travel the roads are just a nightmare but it was a wonderful experience I'm sorry the pictures were scrambled that was because I had to put them on Facebook but I hope you'll believe me that the pictures don't do it justice the difference between being there and actually seeing it is huge but we were able to different situations help them out and try to improve their example hey man that will just close with that Vicky uh just for just for a report for you guys um Vicky maybe we'll close the video um
