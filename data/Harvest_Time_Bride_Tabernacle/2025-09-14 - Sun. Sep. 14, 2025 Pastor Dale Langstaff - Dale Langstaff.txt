Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Wow. We serve an amazing Lord. You have an amazing husband. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Thank you, musicians. Thank you. Maybe you can have your seats for a moment. Just a few announcements. Um, we have a a retirement and graduation both for brother John Garrett. I should have printed this off weeks ago. Please forgive me. Um, I'll put that on the table, but if you need any information, that is Saturday. this Saturday. John Garrett's our friend, a brother in Christ, and and uh he's actually retiring from 28 years in the military, and he's actually got a degree, a master's degree in nursing and children behavior. Um like it's more than just it's sick sick children's behavior. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we just uh we we will be going to that and but the church is all invited. Um and we just want to make our brother uh just enjoy life with them. Amen. And celebrate life with them and this time. Amen. And we just uh love the Lord. Also, just another far away announcement. In November 1st and 2nd, Ben Norrod will be with the church. Um, November uh 1st and 2nd. Just before I read my scripture, um I I sent out a a video from uh from Ohio from Ched Lamb's church and and it really spoke to me and it I believe it spoke to the condition of the church. I believe it spoke on what we're preaching on and I believe it spoke on our world where the situation of our world is and uh um um I don't ever want to I've been there and I I I hope your testimony wouldn't be recently that I've been there recently, But you know, brother Chad was saying if anybody wants that video that didn't I sent it to everybody I could think of. But uh &gt;&gt; he was saying our world has got to a place that for us to be right, we must make you wrong. &gt;&gt; And I don't ever want to be that kind of a person. &gt;&gt; To make me right don't have to make you wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. on anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh &gt;&gt; wow, it it was it was powerful. You know, when we trust God, Brother Chad finished that video like this. He said, "If we believe God and you believe I'm wrong, then you can trust God that he's duty bound &gt;&gt; to change me &gt;&gt; and make me right. It's his responsibility &gt;&gt; ultimately or God would fail &gt;&gt; or I'm not a part of God. We know God can't fail &gt;&gt; and that goes for the ministry &gt;&gt; and the people. &gt;&gt; If I think you're wrong, it's not my job to change you &gt;&gt; cuz no man comes to the father &gt;&gt; but the father &gt;&gt; do the drawn. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, you know, I I I pray to God that we don't preach down. You know, you know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; That's of the devil. &gt;&gt; You don't talk down to your kids. They're a human being. &gt;&gt; But pastors, ministers, you don't talk down to people. &gt;&gt; You're just equally the bride. I'm just equally your brother. &gt;&gt; I'm just a brother. &gt;&gt; I'm not a minister. You You see what I mean? We forget that elevation that's that's of the devil. &gt;&gt; God is no respector &gt;&gt; of elevation person. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we are living in a world of that. So we want to remember Charlie Kirk's wife &gt;&gt; and his family. &gt;&gt; He was brutally murdered &gt;&gt; because of his testimony for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you watch some of his videos, his testimonies, &gt;&gt; they he made no bones about it that he loved Jesus &gt;&gt; and he was his savior &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; there's a lot more we could say about that. &gt;&gt; But you know, we can that's a spirit. Everything we deal with is a spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. Amen. It's a spirit just we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but about principalities and spirits &gt;&gt; and wickedness in high places. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to say the wrong but I I can say this. I I want to say this. If you let Satan anoint you, you will surprise you how far he will take you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this young man that did the shooting, &gt;&gt; it was his dad that called the youth pastor. &gt;&gt; Let that sink in. And the youth pastor called the police &gt;&gt; because of enough hatred &gt;&gt; to murder. I have quotes here. Brother Bam said, "You know, we murder people every day, &gt;&gt; but it's not with a knife or a bullet." &gt;&gt; And I Oh, buddy. &gt;&gt; I'd have to beg God for forgiveness. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're talking about somebody and they're not present, unless it's positive, you're murdering them. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; I don't want to. It's exactly the same spirit. If you leave a company of anybody and you're talking negative and down about them, you are guilty of firstdegree murder in God's eyes. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that would make somebody dysfellowshipped or walk away angry and not even communicate at all is murder. It's a identical spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said things like this that you might as well pull out a gun and shoot them in cold blood &gt;&gt; is walk away and not try to reconcile even come to an agreement that we just disagree. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. And and now I I want to share this with you is that's predestinated to be. That's prophecy. &gt;&gt; It's going to get worse before we get out of here. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says all kinds of things about that that the world won't be they won't have ears to hear. They'll they desire itchy ears and and and you know, sons will be against dads and moms against daughters and Amen. It's just it's prophecy. We can't we can't fight it. But you can change your world &gt;&gt; and I can change my world. And then when our two worlds are together, we've changed the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. Let's just remember his family and his wife and and let's just remember each other. Remember remember me. I I fail. My goodness. I I hope that when you know I'm wrong, I hope you'll give me enough murder mercy that you won't murder me. &gt;&gt; Enough mercy that you won't murder me. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Well, you know, it's just it's just that dummy up there. Just give me a little bit of mercy." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and read our scripture. Amen. God bless you. We love you and it's just awesome to be together again. &gt;&gt; John 8:10 and 11. We're going to continue our our topic on what must I do to have eternal life? And I and I believe that's the question of forever. We could just preach on that and then we'll just go in rapture because if I have eternal life, I'm not worried about nothing else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just just give me eternal life and you can have all the other stuff. Amen. John 8 and 10 and 11. And when Jesus lifted up himself, he saw none but the woman. And he said unto her,"Woman, where are these thine accusers? &gt;&gt; Hath no man condemned thee?" And she said, "No man, Lord?" And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll make the scripture be me. &gt;&gt; I pray you'll make it be me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I pray that you'll just somehow it won't be me, but somehow supernaturally you can portray the love of God to these people and and your your amazing compassion &gt;&gt; for us. In your name we pray. Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. We serve an amazing God. And he he's a lot different God than what he was that I served when I was young because I was one of these accusers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I Oh, buddy. I was I was all of them. Amen. God. Wow. I'm embarrassed of my youth. Amen. And God has spanked me multiple times. Amen. And you know it we don't want religion &gt;&gt; and we don't we don't want denominational spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said our prophet said that a denominational spirit is just putting up walls. &gt;&gt; It can be anywhere. &gt;&gt; If you put up a wall and put me out of the wall, you have a denominational spirit. &gt;&gt; And if I do the same to you, I have a denominational spirit. I'm better than you. You're better than me. &gt;&gt; We have to be in different pens cuz we'll fight. We're like animals. You know, animals you put in different cages &gt;&gt; because if you put them together, they'll fight. &gt;&gt; We have to get past that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come back to the Garden of Eden. You know, last Sunday, I just want to read our scripture, Luke 10, just to lay the foundation. And then I'm going to go completely off on a different way here in Luke 10:25. And he said, "Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Jesus. Said, Master, what must I do to have eternal life?" And he said unto him, "It is written in the law, how readest thou?" And the lawyer answered and said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor, exactly as yourself." And the lawyer said unto Jesus or Jesus said unto him, sorry, thou hast answered right, do this and thou shalt &gt;&gt; shalt live. Now this is our Lord talking and when he was saying to the lawyer about live is thou shalt have eternal life because to live was you will never die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's amazing. &gt;&gt; That's so amazing. &gt;&gt; And then we just drop to verse 33. And a certain Samaritan here Jesus is telling the parable. He journeying by and he came where your neighbor was. And when he looked upon him, he had compassion. I I want to stop there in this scripture. You know, we were went to see Lann's uh went to Lann's family reunion yesterday and and I mentioned this to her brother and her sister and sister-in-law and the one spoke up and they were thinking of compassion by enabling people like I can't give all my money away like to lazy people. You know, compassion can be zero dollars. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you might be in a f you you know what I'm saying? It don't have compassion is not identified by give me all your money. &gt;&gt; You can have compassion on me and not give me no money. &gt;&gt; And vice versa. &gt;&gt; So this ain't rated on money. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we need to lay that down. So I mean in this case he did give two pence and but but it's the definition of love and compassion. I can still feel your situation and and if I could help you, I would. And and you know, stuff like this. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't do something you can't do. &gt;&gt; But you can still have a feeling. You can still put their shoes on and feel the situation of where they're at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And verse 37, and Jesus asked the lawyer, he said, "Now, who was your neighbor? Who was the one that was the neighbor?" And he said, "Who was right?" And he said, "He that showeth mercy, compassion on him." And then Jesus said unto him, "Go thou and do likewise." You know, the world will be a better place and we will be living a Christian life if we have compassion one for the other and even ones we don't know. How much more should we in our family and the family of God, brothers and sisters, have love and compassion? But God was taking us right outside of even his family. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And showing us compassion. And I want to show you, you know, that the scriptures have multiple examples in Jesus. And so I want to carry on at different times. Three, I have three examples where Jesus broke his own law to show compassion and love. &gt;&gt; Broke the scenario of religious traditions to show love and compassion. Three examples and then I want to close on what I was like when I was young. And it's vastly different. Here in John 8 1-11, we see the story of the woman caught in the very act of adultery. And Jesus came to the Mount of Olives and early in the morning again he was at the temple and the people came unto him and sat down and he taught them. And there were certain scribes and and Pharisees that brought unto him a woman caught in adultery. Now, I'll just tell you what, if you would have seen Brother Dale about 30 years ago, oh boy, I would I would have told you exactly what the Bible said about that. See, I was that Pharisee. I was the Pharisee and the scribe. And then they had set her in his midst. And they said unto him,"Lord, this woman was taken in adultery, and your Bible says, "We have the right to stone her." &gt;&gt; See, we can justify ourselves. I'm standing on the word of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery. There will be no liars, no adulteress in heaven, but God forgive all of them." Amen. &gt;&gt; Said in verse five, "Now Moses and the law command us, not tell us, it orders us." &gt;&gt; That if we're message believers, we're going to stone people. The command that's that's a that's that's not a suggestion. That's an order. That said should be stoned. But what saith you? Now Jesus is the word. But he gave a little different answer than what brother Dale thought he would. And this they were tempting him. They might have choose him. And Jesus stooped down with his finger and wrote on the ground as though he didn't hear them. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's good not to hear people. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might open your mouth and let out something bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where was I? &gt;&gt; And and then sorry. And so when they continually asked Jesus, he lifted up himself and he said unto them, I I want you to remember the Bible order. Moses broke the law. That was God's plan to stone him. But God was changing dispensations. Jesus lifted up himself and he said unto them, "He that without sin, &gt;&gt; let him cast the first stone to her." Now, I want to just give you a news flash. If you're alive today, you were born in sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how holy your parents were, how pure they were, and how long they were married before you came along, and and how they dedicated you to God and dumped you in water and baptized you and stood you on your head and said prayers three times. And &gt;&gt; and again he stood down and he wrote on the ground and he said, "And they which heard it were convicted in their own conscience, and went one by one, beginning at the eldest, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone." And then Jesus lifted up himself. He saw that none was there but the woman. Would that woman be accepted here this morning? This morning? &gt;&gt; Would that woman be allowed to sing a special &gt;&gt; this morning? This morning? Would she be allowed to sing a special? Would she be allowed to worship Jehovah &gt;&gt; this morning in this condition? &gt;&gt; In this church? &gt;&gt; Come on. Where are these thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? And she said, no man, no man, Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord. And Jesus said, neither do I condemn thee. How how could God do that? How could how could I have been so wrong when I was young? &gt;&gt; Oh, some of you older ones, you know, Brother Dale. Oh, buddy. I was on the front page of legalistic. &gt;&gt; I I know where I was. &gt;&gt; I'm embarrassed. But see, to know to correct the error is to recognize your &gt;&gt; error. to recognize that I was I was I was I was sinfully wrong &gt;&gt; and that spirit's very healthy &gt;&gt; when we would condemn one another each other when God never even condemned us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here we're condemning each other and our Lord don't even condemn us. And he's like, "I never I said you were free, but nobody else did." Wow. You know, Brother Bam told the story of a little girl that went to go see the king and it was at the school and and I'm just paraphrasing. I'm going to come into it. you can. But uh the the school had put out the king and they they give all the kids flags and and it really goes beautifully right here. And so the kids were all lined up and they were waving their flade like, "Hi, king. I want you to see me. Can you see me?" Little short ones. They were all trying to get in the front row. And one little girl after the king left, she she went away by a hydropole and she was just sobbing her eyes open. And the teacher came and said,"What are you crying about? Like, didn't you see the king? Didn't we have the short people on the front and the, you know, the taller and the taller and the bigger?" And everybody was waving their flag. Didn't you see the king? She said, "Oh, yeah. I saw the king." Said, "Well, what in the world? Didn't you wave your flag to the king when he passed?" She said, "Yeah." He said, "And you saw him?" She said, "Yeah, I saw him." Then she said, "But why are you crying?" And she said, "But teacher, the king, he knows me." &gt;&gt; And that isn't the way Jesus is &gt;&gt; to a prostitute. &gt;&gt; No matter how little you are, he knows everything that you do. &gt;&gt; It's recorded in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as much. And it's not the big things. Sometimes we do. Sometimes the little things that we leave undone. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus had no respects. I want you to watch that last line. Is that up there? The last 44. Now Jesus had no respects of groups. Jesus met all kinds of uhoh &gt;&gt; groups. All sizes. and all walks of life. Well, we we just fellowship with them because, you know, we don't go to the well when they're there because because we know &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, in Luke 23, Jesus is being crucified and he's in torture and agony for me. And then starting in verse 33, and when they had come to the place which was called Calvary, there they crucified Jesus and the male factors which are the thieves, one on the right and one on the left. And Jesus said, "Father, I could have you done this? I I'm trying to. Father, forgive them for they don't know what they do. Now, Jesus was comp. He was more than 100% innocent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There has never been a person killed that was more innocent than Christ. &gt;&gt; And they parted his raignments. They mocked him. Mocked him. Have you ever heard believers mock somebody? They &gt;&gt; mocked him. Well, they ain't they're always they that's a mock them. People stood beholding him and the rulers also them deridded him, degraded him, saying, "You save others and let him save himself." What a loser. If you be the Christ, the chosen of God, and the soldiers also mocked him, mocked him. I can think of sometimes that I mock believers. It's disgusting. I I &gt;&gt; But I I imagine if I did it this maybe coming and offering him vinegar and saying, "If thou be the king of the Jews, save yourself." And one of the thieves, the male factors which were hanging ra beside him, he started mocking them also. Now he's dying, &gt;&gt; but he starts mocking God. He's saying, "If thou be the Christ, save thyself and save me, too." &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to watch this verse 39. He actually asked Jesus that if you're the Christ, save me. &gt;&gt; Save yourself, but save me with you. &gt;&gt; But he did it in the wrong attitude. He actually asked to be saved. &gt;&gt; But Jesus didn't take it. &gt;&gt; Because it was the delivery. It was done in mockery and blaspheme. Verse 40. And the other answered him and rebuked him. Now why would he rebuke him for asking to be saved? It was because of his delivery. &gt;&gt; His delivery was, "Well, if I went, you you can't do nothing for me. I've been going serving God twice as long as you. I understand that. I never could have done more for you than anybody else." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like how if a believer is serving God for 60 years and somebody comes in and they're only serving them for 20 years, they still can't help the guy in 20. &gt;&gt; It's God that helps us. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God that does everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We think, well, well, bless God. I've been serving God longer than you, so I know everything. &gt;&gt; I don't know nothing. &gt;&gt; And the other one answer, rebuked him, saying, "Dust thou not fear God? You dummy?" I I always wondered when God seen me when I was young and he said, "Oh boy, you're going to have to relive this so many times." Don't you fear God, seeing that thou art in the same condemnation, and that indeed we justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds. But this man hath done nothing. I miss. Wow. &gt;&gt; And he said unto Jesus, "Lord, now I I want to show you something. The person that got saved never asked for salvation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I The one that got not saved, he asked God to save him. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; remember me. I want to stop there for a second. He never said, "Forgive me." He never said, "I'm sorry." He never said, "Help me, Lord." &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. He just said, "Remember me." &gt;&gt; How do people get saved without repenting? &gt;&gt; Well, here's an example right here. &gt;&gt; He got saved and he never even repented. Some of you, you you parents that got old kids. They might not have to repent. &gt;&gt; No. Job's kids never. You thought I was &gt;&gt; It was Job's sacrifice over his kids that saved his kids. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's crazy. I mean, I love it. It's just amazing. &gt;&gt; But we we put sometimes we change what God is. And God, we can't do that. I'm showing you a God's showing me a different God. I'm like, "Oh, boy." &gt;&gt; God's showing Brother Dale a different God. &gt;&gt; Brother Dale don't have to be right. And I don't need to make anybody wrong just to make me feel better cuz I'm right. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of the devil. &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "Remember me when thou comest to your kingdom." He he never said like after you die when you get to heaven or it was just really peculiar. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say unto you that today thou shalt be with me in paradise." That guy, you know that brother was a no good scoundrel. He said himself they were getting justly due &gt;&gt; what their reward was. &gt;&gt; They they they were getting killed because they were robbers and thieves. &gt;&gt; Do you know he had never attended church? &gt;&gt; He had never heard the seven seals preached. He had never taken communion. &gt;&gt; He had not been baptized. Probably wasn't even dedicated. Probably hated God his whole life. &gt;&gt; Never paid tithe and offerings. probably sold from the church if he could have. Well, he he obviously sold. He was robbed. And he never asked for forgiveness. He never even came to an altar and wept. And they never had an evangelist like that was really uh good at he just said, "I'm getting justly what I deserve. Lord, just think about me. just think about me when you get there. &gt;&gt; And God said, "You'll be there with me." &gt;&gt; I I wonder I wonder if that robber came in that broke into took advantage of you, broke something of yours, took a whole bunch of money, robbed you blind, &gt;&gt; was all dirty and not respectful and and never done nothing good in his whole life. I wonder if he'd be welcome here. I wonder if we'd let him go first in the food line because he never brought nothing. Never would, never did. And he ate a lot. See how we think. &gt;&gt; He's taking advantage of us. &gt;&gt; He never did nothing right. &gt;&gt; Heaven's going to be filled with a lot of rotten people. that God loved. &gt;&gt; That's amazing. &gt;&gt; And then we come to the story in John 4. And this is kind of a long story, but I need to go through it just to break it down. This the Saraphene woman, the woman at the well. And and I just kind of highlighted different verses. I don't got it all but this this John chapter John is an amazing book by the way. &gt;&gt; John is just you know those that hear my words my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow. I love the book of John here Jesus is on a journey and he departed to Galilee and he said I must needs go by Samaria. Now, you know, I read all the quotes. You know, there was hundreds of quotes. There was 130ome quotes on this verse. The woman at the well, I I I think I read every single one of them. But, uh, you know, Jesus, Brother Brown was talking about to go to this spot. It was way out of the way and way up a mountain. The disciples did not want to go there. It was a no good for nothing place. It wasn't on the way to the mall. It wasn't on the way to Walmart or even the hunting store. It was just on the way to nowhere. It was on a dirt road, so it bypassed all the highways and it was uphill. And there cameth a woman out to draw water. Now, I must have skipped that important verse. I'm sorry, but Jesus sent his disciples away. Brother Bram said it was because they had a religious denominational spirit. &gt;&gt; But the woman came and he said, "Give me a drink." In verse eight, and it Oh, here he goes. Sorry. I thought I'd take that. I that was my favorite one. And the disciples for the his disciples Jesus were gone away in the city to buy meat cuz he knew that they couldn't handle what was going to happen at church this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's going to be somebody from the city come in. They're going to have a swimsuit on. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? You know your your prophet preached to women in India that he said that they had as many clothes on as what they were born with. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's not a lot. &gt;&gt; And he didn't pass out coats or house coats. He just preached the word &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost come down and went &gt;&gt; back the next day and they were covered &gt;&gt; and he never preached on holiness. &gt;&gt; So I wonder if they would be welcome here. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't have a closet here where we pass out house coats to people that aren't dressed properly. Because see, if we give them the house coat, they can take it off. &gt;&gt; Like if you go to the grocery store and you see somebody not dressed right, do you give them your coat? &gt;&gt; But you're there. If you don't give them your coat in the grocery store and you don't leave because they offend you, then why would you do it different here? &gt;&gt; Are you not a big person? And then the woman here, he said, "How art thou being a Jew? Why we don't we don't go to the same church at camp meeting? Why we are divided? I'm a Samaritan. And for the Jews have no dealing with us because we are unclean people. We're mixed." And Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinkkeeth the water that or this water thirsteth again, but whosoever drinkketh my water will never thirst." And and she said, "Sir, give me this water that I may thirst not." See the approach? She never said, "What are you talking about?" She never said, "How are you qualified?" She never said, "How long did you go to university?" She never said, "How big is your church?" That'll prove if you're a good pastor. If you have a big church, well, you got to be good. Hitler had a big church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was preaching Lucifer. He was preaching to kills. &gt;&gt; He had millions in his church. &gt;&gt; If you ever hear a speech of Hitler, it's just like a preaching sermon. &gt;&gt; You'd think Ben Norrod was here, except the words are different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Literally. That's great. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was preaching Germany and down with the Jews. They said amen to his speeches. Worship God. Put their hands up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here they go into a discussion and we're just going to skip down to 22. He's talking about real worship. Matter of fact, maybe I better grab that. Sorry. And the woman answered and said here Jesus said he said bring me your husband. Sorry I I got to I we need this and thou hast and she said but I don't have a husband. He said thou well said. You know, brother Bram talked about this when when when the disciples come back and seen him. I might have a quote here, but talked about when they seen him come back, brother Bram literally said, maybe even the scripture said that the the the disciples hid in the bushes. And when they heard Jesus say, "Go get your husband," they said, "Uhoh, he just prophesied wrong. We know this woman. She's got loads of men." &gt;&gt; Jesus knew that, too. He said, "Thou has five, and whom thou are with, think your husband, thou said truly." And the woman said unto her, "Sir, I perceive thou a prophet, and our fathers," Watch this now. Now, now she's going to preach to Jesus about a physical Jesus, &gt;&gt; a physical God. Watch this. She said, "Now our fathers worshiped in a certain place in this mountain. And ye say that Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship. See, God don't care about where you worship. It's in your heart where you worship. God don't care about buildings and cities and countries and mountains and hills and valleys. It's your soul. &gt;&gt; He's got a chosen place of worship. And Jesus said unto her,"Woman,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh and and when ye shall neither worship in the mountain or at church or in Jerusalem, but you'll worship my father, and you shall worship. You know not what, for salvation is to the Jews. And the hour cometh now, that the true worshipper will worship the Father in Uhoh. I think we mentioned that before. spirit and truth. God's not concerned a lot about flesh. &gt;&gt; Not not the beings and bodies and who's this and who's big and who's little and and and Jesus and all this and flesh and prophets and he not even concerned about all those things. He uses them. &gt;&gt; But he said you'll worship in spirit and truth &gt;&gt; anywhere. &gt;&gt; You can't pinpoint God for the father. That's what the father seeketh worship for God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. And the woman said unto him, I know that the Messiah Oh, see she was going back to a physical being, &gt;&gt; but I know there's going to be a man come by and we'll just follow that flesh around and everything will be in that man. Well, he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily, but God was a lot bigger than that body. &gt;&gt; That's right. I know when the Messiah cometh, which is called the Christ, when he cometh, that he will tell us all these things. And Jesus said, &gt;&gt; I that speak to thee &gt;&gt; am he. &gt;&gt; And upon this came his disciples. Oh, watch this. I wish you were posting mine, Vicki, but it's all right. I put mine in capital letters. And I remember I told you about the disciples. I didn't know if it was in the quote or in the Bible. That's what we do. And upon this came his disciples and they marveled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That we let the woman at the well sing a special. And they marveled that Jesus, this is the Lord, &gt;&gt; talked with a dirty person. &gt;&gt; They marveled. Well, our church wouldn't have fellowship with them because we're we're separate. They're dirty. They're not they're not sanctified yet. &gt;&gt; They they they're not sanctified and they ain't put away all these treasures of the world, you know? They're still drinking and smoking and cutting their hair and and they're they're they they got a whole bunch of husbands and wives and they go to those places that they have all kinds of crazy lights and and the disciples marveled and they're like, "I thought this was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; I thought this was the real God. And yet none of them said, "Why seekest thou?" Or none of the disciples were big enough to say, "Lord, why talkest thou to her?" But they couldn't. The disciples could not figure out their Lord. See, we try to put Jesus in a box. We try to say, we try to put them in church order and doctrine. We try to put them in dress code. We try to put them in whatever you want to put them in. They're all good things. &gt;&gt; But they're not God. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is proof right here. You don't need no more proof than that. These people were completely losing their mind. &gt;&gt; God wasn't going to a church order where everything was perfect. You know, church, I tell you something is there's there's a problem in the environment &gt;&gt; that we're living in. &gt;&gt; That when people disagree, they divide. &gt;&gt; And God disagreed with being adulterous. He disagreed with everything this woman is. God disagreed with her, &gt;&gt; but he didn't divide. He didn't divide. I I'm just saying and and I believe me in my past is but I'm just showing you that God is different. &gt;&gt; God is different than you think. I'm not I'm not saying don't come here if this ain't the word of God. But this this is like the same Bible. &gt;&gt; Is this in your Bible? &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm I'm preaching a God that I didn't know when I was converted. I would have told you. Watch this. I when I would have told you when my kids I would have told you I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I had I was saved, sanctified, had a family, beautiful wife, and going to a spiritfilled message church. And I was backslid. &gt;&gt; I had all that, but I was still backslid. &gt;&gt; Cuz I was like marveled &gt;&gt; when God did something I didn't agree with. Said, "Wait a minute, God. We don't do that in church. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute, God. I &gt;&gt; I want you to get this this morning. The disciples, they walked with Jesus. &gt;&gt; They slept with him &gt;&gt; and they ate with him &gt;&gt; and they could not figure him out. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And you've walked with him &gt;&gt; and I've walked with him and we've talked to him &gt;&gt; and I I'm still learning a whole bunch. I'm still just like, &gt;&gt; "What's going on here? &gt;&gt; What are you showing me, God?" &gt;&gt; I thought I was to preach against sin. &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with this scripture? &gt;&gt; Jesus ain't preaching to her. &gt;&gt; He never preached to her. He never said any of the wrong sinful things. Wow. And the disciples had, watch this. I put this in brackets in mind. The disciples had a bad self-righteous spirit. We're better than her. That's a denominational spirit of putting up walls. And we don't like it that our savior, we thought was our savior, is breaking down the walls that we built up so perfectly. Wow. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be like the disciples. I want to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want to be like Jesus. I want to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; I I might I I might not understand it all. I won't understand it all. And and I'm I maybe can't even live it all, &gt;&gt; but I just I'd rather be aired at just being like Jesus when the woman ca was accused. He just he never responded. I'd rather people sometimes people come they say well this is wrong that's wrong that's wrong that's wrong that's wrong that's wrong what am I supposed to say &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; I'm going to pretend like Jesus &gt;&gt; I can't fix it &gt;&gt; even if I agreed I couldn't fix it &gt;&gt; if I could you could worship me because then I'd be God and I'm not God &gt;&gt; a million trillion miles from gillion miles from that. &gt;&gt; You see how we get, sorry. And the woman then left the water pot, and she went into the city, and she said unto the man, "Come see a man that told me all the things. Is this not the Christ?" And I'm going to uh And they and the city came out. And Jesus just preached a short message. She said, "You say not, there is yet four months. Then cometh the harvest. Behold, I say unto you." This is what God's saying to you right now. &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes &gt;&gt; and look in your community. &gt;&gt; Look at the fields, for they are white and ready to be harvested. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gatherth the fruit unto life eternal, and both are brought, and both he that sweth, and he that reapeth may rejoice &gt;&gt; together. Now I I want I this this really amazed me. And when you watch this, is is that preaching against sin? These people were all sinners in the city. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that. And the woman at the well had six husbands, six men. Like, why didn't Jesus use the opportunity to preach against adultery? Why didn't he use the opportunity to preach on holiness? &gt;&gt; He said, "Go harvest more souls." &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. Like, these souls haven't even give their life to you yet. &gt;&gt; Well, the Well, the Well, watch this. I know what you're thinking. But the woman at the well left her pot and went to witness. Did it say she had given her life to God yet? I tell you what the Bible says. Let's go to 39. And many of the Samaritans of the city believed on him for the saying which the woman testified. It don't even say she's converted yet. Amen. You know what? It's better when Satan says that you're a real believer. &gt;&gt; When the devil and the newsmen and the government say, "Now there's something I can't understand those people." Now, I tell you what, then you got the goods. When the outside world starts saying, "Now there's go some people. I've been watching them and just everything just Ha. See, the devil looked at Jesus and he trembled. And the religious people, they said, "Well, he's the devil." &gt;&gt; Wow. Saying, "The woman testified, and he told me all these things that I did." So verse 40. And so when the Samaritan came unto him, they besought him that he would tarry. Jesus wasn't even to say around to do a campaign or camp meeting. And he stayed a couple days and many more believe. And many, watch this. Verse 41. And many more believed because of Jesus' own word. But the other ones had already believed before Jesus started talking &gt;&gt; to a woman that hadn't even said that she was converted yet. and said unto the woman, "Now we believe because of Jesus, saying, for we have heard him ourselves, and know that indeed the Christ, the Savior &gt;&gt; of the world." Wow. Now, there's three examples plus the Good Samaritan. That's four examples of God going outside what we would think of the law by well I'm not going to that church they don't have holiness I'm not going to that church they don't have church order they don't they do everything different the prophet teached so &gt;&gt; so Jesus just broke what all the prophets taught the whole Bible &gt;&gt; right there in four examples I know you don't like that. And if you don't, it's because you have a denominational spirit. &gt;&gt; I never used to like it either because I like to see that Jesus is just inside this little box and if I step outside of it, well, that's the devil. But then when God stepped outside of it, I was like, wait a minute. Now I want to show you the spirit that I had when I was 25 and converted and in a message church. Acts six. Now Paul wrote Acts. You notice I'm using a lot of Bible. Pretty hard to dispute the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Pretty hard to dispute the word of God. &gt;&gt; I never read the word of God like this before in my life. I'll tell you what, I'm going to let a lot more things slide and just let God take care of all the issues. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to try to fix any issues. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz I'll make a mess of them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'll be sticky. I'll have dirty fingers. Just stand back. Just say, &gt;&gt; everybody will say, "But why aren't you answering?" Same reason Jesus never &gt;&gt; Everybody's talking. Lots of voices. Wow. This was me. 100% me. This is going to take a moment because we got two chapters, but we're doing really good. And in these days, the number the number of the disciples multiplied. The Christians grew. Now, now I want to tell you that the book of Acts is a true church of God. &gt;&gt; Now, we're now in the New Testament grace age. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is here. &gt;&gt; All right, everybody. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Beautiful. Okay. Watch this. And so the church grew and it was hard. And so the 12 the disciples and that they could hardly control it all. And they were so busy dealing with all the little issues. And verse three, and so therefore he said, "Brethren, ye are out among us to se pick out seven honest men of full report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over our business." And verse four, and and we give ourselves continually to prayer. The disciples were going to give them continually to prayer and ministry. But that don't mean that somebody else couldn't come and minister. &gt;&gt; And the same pleased the church. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith &gt;&gt; and full of the Holy Ghost. Now, &gt;&gt; I just want to clarify something here. It was them that chose him, &gt;&gt; not himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. that that's going to be important and and some other people and all that. And they set these apostles and they prayed uh and a great company of the priests. Let's go to sorry verse 7. And the word of the Lord increased and the number of the disciples multiplied and Jerusalem greatly. Now there was 3,000 people being added to the church a day. I mean like we could hardly keep up with the building program. I mean like it was like expanding like crazy. And the trees weren't growing fast enough to put shade over all the people. And we were running out of tarps. It increased greatly in Jerusalem. The company of the priests were obedient to the faith. And verse 8, and Stephen full of faith, power did great wonders and miracles among the people. Now that sounds like a believer. And then there arose jealousy. You know, Wednesday night we I tried to do something for the kids. And so I asked the kids, I wanted them to preach to me Wednesday night. I said, "Why did Daniel get thrown in the land then?" And and Leah said he said, "Well, cuz Daniel prayed." Well, in a way, but there was something that happened before that, &gt;&gt; and it was jealousy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he got through him because of prayer, but it was the jealousy. Now let's read verse eight again. And Steven was full of faith and power and did great wonders and miracles among the people. We're okay with that. That's the Bible. He's full-fledged and a fantastic brother. And then there arose a certain synagogue. Uh-oh. They called the all these other people that fake names. You can see them there. And they disputed with Steven. Uh-oh. Problem number one. They didn't like the ministry that God that God had given to Stephen. And Stephen had the manifestation of the works of God's anointing on his life. &gt;&gt; They didn't like that. They were jealous. Verse 10. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which Stephen spake. &gt;&gt; Now, let's just jump back for a second. Now, remember, the church was growing so fast, they had to have more ministers. &gt;&gt; They chose Stephen for one of the ministers. &gt;&gt; He was number one. &gt;&gt; And he says he was a godly person. And it showed in the manifestations of things that he could not do in the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So bottom line, God was with that man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; And God's people killed him. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. What did I just say? God was with that man &gt;&gt; in supernatural ways that no man could have manufactured those signs &gt;&gt; and God's people &gt;&gt; killed them. &gt;&gt; No, no. I I must I I misquote the scripture. &gt;&gt; No, you mean you mean wait. You mean no. God was with that man. And it wasn't just that he said he was with them, but it showed in God's manifestation in his life &gt;&gt; that like he he prayed for people and they they they got healed. They had arms and eyes and mist and the people that had it happened to wait a minute. And the people it happened to in the church allowed them to murder. &gt;&gt; Murder. &gt;&gt; I don't get that. Verse 11. 10. They were not able. Okay. Yeah. Verse 11. They verse verse 10. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit which he spake and they killed him. Verse 11. And they were stubborn men which we have heard and speak blasphemy words against Moses. See there it goes. See, watch this. Watch. I want you to catch this verse right here. Please catch this. If you try to hold me to church order, that's what they did to Stephen. &gt;&gt; He stepped out of sight of Moses law. &gt;&gt; Mo was Moses a prophet. Somebody say amen. Help me preach. Moses was the greatest prophet in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; And so I'm off the word. I stepped outside of Moses law. All right, let's let's get the stones since they're killing them. That's exactly what they did to Stephen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They had a spirit of murder. &gt;&gt; He blast speak blaspheming was against Moses and against God. And they stirred up the people. Uhoh. and the elders and the scribes. And it came unto them and they caught them and they brought them to the council. That's why when somebody leaves the church, it's normally just not one person that leaves. &gt;&gt; They normally take a bunch of people with them &gt;&gt; cuz they have connections. &gt;&gt; And it set up false witness which said, "This man erase and speaks blaspheme against the holy place in the law. And for if we have heard him say it, that Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs of Moses that he delivered. And all that sat in the council, I looked steadfastly upon Steven and the face. And it was as a angel. Now I I just want to just give you step in your news. If I was gonna attack somebody and I and God came down and made them look like an angel of light in front of me, even when I was stupid, &gt;&gt; I think I would have caught on. Like even at 25, if the people I was attacking would have changed to an angel of light before my eyes, maybe, just maybe, that spirit, you know, that spirit is really, really strong &gt;&gt; because I probably wouldn't have because they never Why would have I? I'm right. You're wrong. See, Moses was right. He's off Moses. So, we kill. See, now we, you know what the prophet said? He said, "We can't physically kill today because the government law kind of discourages that." So, we go after the person. We talk about them. We don't like where they live. They live too far, too close. We don't like how they live. Verse seven. Now, this this chapter's only got 60 verses in it. So, my but I I I priest said, "Are these things?" So, now how's Stephen supposed to answer that? Like, I want to know how is Stephen supposed to answer that? He's filled with the Holy Ghost and power and wisdom and there was miracles and signs and wonders in his midst. How is he supposed to answer that? And he said unto him, "Men and brethren, Father," and and I I want to just jump in this. I'm only going to read the highlights that I have, Vicki. But Stephen goes and he gives them the history of the whole church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he starts at Abraham. He said, "God appeared unto her father Abraham and said, "Go to a country and get thee out of a kindred into a land that I'll show thee." And and I'm just jumping verse six. And he said, "God spake on this wise that thy seed shall show in a strange land. Thou shalt bring them into bondage that was Egypt and retreat them of evil 400 years." And then they killed the people. And so Abraham the end of 17 or the end of eight. And so Abraham begott Isaac, and he circumcised them the eighth day. And Isaac begot Jacob. of Jacob. He got the 12 patriots in verse 9. And the patriots and and moved it with with envy and sold Joseph. &gt;&gt; Oh, that sounds what sold them out as they betrayed him. &gt;&gt; To Egypt, but God was still with him. &gt;&gt; Why didn't God forget about him? Well, all these other Christians sold him out, so he had to be wrong. And he delivered them up to the afflictions. And he gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh the king in Egypt. And he made him govern over all of Egypt in his house. And his substance was amazing. The king in verse 12. And when Jacob heard they went into a famine, and Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent his brothers sons. Verse 13. And the second Joseph, the second time the kids come, Joseph revealed himself unto his brothers and he couldn't contain himself. He cried so loud that all of Egypt heard him and Pharaoh and then sent Joseph to call his dad to come to Egypt. So here's let's just sum up. Here's Stephen telling the church, Holy Ghostfilled message church, we're in Acts. The Holy Ghost is given he's given them the history of the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They should have already known that. But he called his his his whole family in verse 17. And the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had swore by Abraham, that the people grew in multitudes. There were 2 million by then. And another king arose that knew not &gt;&gt; Joseph. And and he he uh punished the people and killed the young people and the children that they would not live. And in which time Moses was born. and God was with them. And let's just jump to 24. You can, this chapter tells the whole story, but we're just trying to and and seeing that one of them. So, here's Moses. He thought, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We got to go back here." Moses was Pharaoh and he was cast out of Pharaoh's his Pharaoh's daughter took him and Moses learned in wisdom and deed. And he was fully 40 years old when he came to the heart to visit his own brethren in Egypt that were slaves. 40 years old. Now watch what Moses mistake was. He thought the people would believe that God was with them &gt;&gt; and they didn't. The Bible says that and seeing one of them suffer wrongfully, Moses defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smoked the Egyptian for he he supported his brethren. Now that like that sounds positive and he supposed that his brethren would understand how God was by his hand and would deliver him. That was where he was wronged. He supposed that the church thought that if the minister was preaching the word of God, the Bible, the vindicated word, the message for the day, that nobody would leave that. Come on. &gt;&gt; Moses supposed that the brethren would understand how God how God by his hand would deliver them. But they misunderstood. They said, "Well, that's not how I would do it. I wouldn't have killed the guy. I would have just hit him. I would have covered him up with a blanket and threw him in the river." Well, that that's what it sounds like. &gt;&gt; It always would have been a different way. I'll handle this situation. They did not understand. Verse 26. And the next day he Moses showed himself unto them as they strove, as they labored. And he and there was two of them that were disagreeing. And he says, "Sers, you are brothers. Why do you do wrong one to another? You're friends. Like, why can't you just just get along?" &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; But he that did his neighbor wrong thrusted him away, saying, "Who made thou a ruler or judge or a big person over us? Wilt thou kill me like you did the Egyptian?" Now, these were the people that were sitting in Moses church. &gt;&gt; They were the Jews. I mean, not literally in his church. These were the people that Moses was promised to deliver. And they hated him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They would have been slaves till today if it hadn't been for Moses. &gt;&gt; That's That's unbelievable. He said, "Wilt thou kill me like thou did the Egyptian yesterday?" And Moses fled. You know why Moses fled? He fled from the very people he was ordained to deliver. He fled from the very people that should have gave their life to love and support him. He fled from the very people he was showing the truth to. and he fled because they hated they didn't understand him saying, "Was this a stranger?" And so he went and he found his wife in the wilderness and had a couple kids. And the angel of the Lord came to him in the burning bush. And the Lord said unto him, "I am God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob." And Moses trembled and dust not. And and he he just didn't know what to do. When the Lord said unto him, "Put off thy shoes of thy feet, for the place I'll stand is holy ground." Now, let let's just jump out of this. Now, this is Stephen preaching to the church. Let me give you an example. What did Stephen say wrong so far? Is everything Stephen saying like in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Like it it actually was history. It was like a history lesson, but it was Bible how God had worked through the people. Like, was Stephen off is what I'm trying to say. No. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. He wasn't off yet. And this Moses whom they refused, saying, Whom made thee ruler or judge over, the same did God send to be ruler and deliver by the hand of the angel and appeared unto him by the bush. Now, I'm just going to jump to 48. You're going to have to read that in between cuz we got And how be it that the most here here. So, Stephven's still preaching to the church. He said, "How be it? The Most High dwelleth not in clay and buildings and traditions and creeds and temples made of hands. Don't get too caught up in the the messenger. Get caught up in the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up in the preacher. Get caught up in the spirit that he's delivering. Don't get too caught up in the prophet. Get caught up in the spirit of Jehovah that's delivering that's coming out of his mouth." He said that God dwell in temples made hands as saeth the prophets. Heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. And what house will you build me sayeth the Lord or the place of my rest? Hath not my hands made all these things? Ye stiff necked and uncircumcised of ears heart and ears. &gt;&gt; Ye do always resist God. &gt;&gt; As your fathers do, so do ye. &gt;&gt; That's right. which the prophets and your fathers you persecuted. Let's just jump to 54. And when they heard these things, oh buddy, he had really ticked them off. Now they were cut in their heart and they gassed him with their teeth. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait there. This was a Holy Ghostfilled message church. And the preacher had just get done preaching the life history of God's movement in the church from Father Abraham. And Stephen had the Holy Ghost and wisdom and power and did great signs and wonders that was impossible for him to do. &gt;&gt; And they are teeth 55. And he being filled of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfast to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus stand at the right hand of God. That's power. And saith, behold, I see the heavens open and the son of man standing at the right hand of God. And 57 And then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and stopped their ears. That's about 50 or more% of most message so-called believers. And they stopped their ears. And they stopped their ears and said, "I'm gonna stay home and listen to press play and or I ain't gonna stay home at all. I ain't gonna do this and I ain't gonna" and they stopped their ears and they ran upon him in one accord and they cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses and 59 and they stoned Stephen and called upon God stoning him. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And calling upon God and saying, and here Steven's talking now, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." And he knelt down and cried aloud with a loud voice. And Jesus, lay not this sin against their charge. You want to talk about the spirit of Christ and compassion? &gt;&gt; Look at Stephen. &gt;&gt; I can't think I like I know crucifixion is probably the most torturable death, but stoning's got to be second. I can't imagine being someplace and being killed by people hurling stones at me. &gt;&gt; I want to know where Steven went wrong. Where did Stephen leave the word? Any of Acts seven must be off because that's what he told him he believed. Acts seven, he was vindicated by God by signs and wonders and miracles and power. They couldn't fight him because of the wonders. You know what it was? Jealousy. Jealousy. Jealousy. I'll get you for that. That's the same spirit that that boy left his home and drove three hours in the states, took preparation for it, went to a strange college, walked through the whole college, went on a roof and lined up an innocent person, that he was raised in a church, and his youth leader turned him in. You know what they now accompanied to it? He was living with a transgender person. And Charles was very opposed to that lifestyle. His lover &gt;&gt; was the guy that was becoming a woman. &gt;&gt; And rather than just go ahead and live your life, said I'll kill you for that. And that's the identical spirit of murder in churches today. You want to hear what the prophet says? And you people that got a buzzaw temper and that's spilling out of the mouth of somebody and you can't put the things like that. Be careful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you're guilty if you speak one word against your brother. &gt;&gt; That's not right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not just go around and you can go around tear me down. Makes no difference. You can go around tear down anybody. Fill your boots. But don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him. You can break his character and kill him. Kill his influence. Speak against your pastor here and say something bad about him and you might as well have shot him. Told him something that wasn't right about him. You'll kill his influence and the people and things and you're guilty. Uh &gt;&gt; that ain't the one I wanted. Well, I missed the quote. Well, I have to preach part three. That's all there is to that. &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go. No, I I had another multiple places, brother. Maybe that was You don't have to kill him. You can kill them. You're guilty of murder. Multiple places. Brother Bram said you would be guilty of murder, &gt;&gt; but you never killed the person. He said he he said places like this. He said the law would hinder you from killing them because you don't want to go to prison. So you will do it another way to keep you out of prison. That's the exact same devil. Exact same devil. You see the same devil. You see, God don't rate devils and sin. Unbelief &gt;&gt; is sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Let's just I'm just winding down here. I have some other scriptures. Luke 6:27-37, but I'm going to let's just read Luke uh 6:35. I I have more than that down, but it says, "Love your enemies, do good to them, lend, hoping for nothing in return, and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the highest. For his kind, and onto unthankful, and to the evil, for ye be therefore merciful, as your father also is merciful." That's eternal life. That's Luke 6:27-37 if you want to read that. Here in Matthew 7, it says, "Therefore, the things whichsoever you would that a man would do to you, even so do them, do ye unto them." Amen. I want to close with this. Uh the one quote I think I missed, but I I multiple multiple none of these quotes were cherrypicked. multiple murder and killing each other was the same issues. He said the gospel Paul said go into all the world and preach the gospel manifest and demonstrate demonstration of the Holy Spirit is a live reaction to God moving among the members of the body. He said, "Now, if it's a pumpkin vine, it'll bear a pumpkin. And if it's a watermelon vine, it'll be bear a watermelon. And if it's a grape vine, it'll have grapes. And if it's a Christian vine, then Christ will be in the church. And he will enhance his branches that's in him to bear the fruits that he did when he was here on earth." Now, I want to ask you, this Christ that we've talked about the last two Sundays is a lot different than the Christ I was serving when I was 25, when I was 30, when I was 35. It's a lot different than the Christ that most of us sometimes maybe would think. We love the letter, but we don't like the life. We love being able to pinpoint the message. Well, bless God. I got a quote for that. Well, what are we going to do with these quotes? &gt;&gt; Anytime anybody tells me that they got a quote for something? I said, well, what do you want me to do with these quotes? &gt;&gt; You got a scripture. Well, what do you want me to do with these four scriptures? I know what to do. Let's not read them. &gt;&gt; Let's Let's not Let's just not talk about them. Let's just maybe we won't like take them out of the Bible, but we won't never mention them. Really? My last quote. I put this in this morning. I wasn't going to read this and I used, you know, there's I'm not just cherrypicking this. Daniel, they did the same thing. It was jealousy that put Daniel in the lion's den because Daniel was chosen number one most trusted servant to the king. &gt;&gt; Number one Daniel and their desire was to kill him. &gt;&gt; That spirit is very healthy. &gt;&gt; Very healthy. We don't have lion's den anymore, but we have that same spirit. God help us. God help me. just just I don't have to I don't have to make you wrong to make me right and feel bigger. But let's just trust God that if you're wrong or I'm wrong and we're God's, he'll bring us to the right in his own good time. &gt;&gt; And nothing else matter. Like is eternal life all that matters? &gt;&gt; I'd rather have not church order and doctrine and have eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'd rather not have holiness and have church order and doctrine. &gt;&gt; I'd rather not be right and still have eternal life &gt;&gt; because all these situations, four of them, five of them if you call Daniel are so in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Let me read you something. Our prophet said, "Your prophet." Now, this is this is really outside the thing. You know, I've had message pastors in Ontario disagree with this. It's okay. I love him dearly. This might really But this is what the prophet said. If we, you know, you got the wrong pastor to not read everything &gt;&gt; if it's in the Bible, I'm going to apply it. &gt;&gt; I'm not cherry-picking it when I can find five or four different scriptures history. A baby's a baby when it's formed. The very first germ in a mother's womb, it's a baby. And I'm firmly against birth control. &gt;&gt; See? Yes, sir. For where it is just as much harm to take a life of a little baby that ain't months old than to put a pistol and shoot a man down in cool blood. &gt;&gt; Murder. Yes, sir. I'm against birth control. What God sends you, &gt;&gt; God will take care of. &gt;&gt; That's notice that is wrong to do that. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the babies right there. &gt;&gt; It's a life &gt;&gt; from the very first germ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've had multiple message churches. I had my kids come and tell me that people from other message churches believed it was all right to do an abortion if it you know just happened take the pill the next day pill or do something like that cuz you know it wasn't some that wasn't you know wasn't &gt;&gt; it wasn't like you know make I don't care if it's rape or anything it's a life makes no difference mistake rape &gt;&gt; molested beating upside down, non-planned. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there's message pastors that teach against this. They told me, &gt;&gt; they say, "Well, that sister could never find a husband if she has an illegitimate child." How's that justify the word? &gt;&gt; And I I just sit there and I'm like, &gt;&gt; "Wow, &gt;&gt; am I old? Amen. &gt;&gt; Murder. We're talking about what must we have to have eternal life. And let I'm going to close with this. Matter of fact, you can come. Let's stand. The opposite of what must we have to have eternal life is murder. &gt;&gt; It's one word. If you're not in the spirit of giving eternal life, you're a murderer. &gt;&gt; You You know what? You know what? I I I'm going to read tell you some things from memory. I read believe me I read all these quotes really nice. Brother Brandham compared that to that in in our day God said if you look upon a woman and had a thought it was the same as doing the act. That's exact same as the murder we're talking about. If you think about me in an evil way, you've already committed the murder &gt;&gt; because it went through your mind. &gt;&gt; I hate that man. I hate that man. &gt;&gt; That's what your prophet &gt;&gt; said. He said, "I'm going to bring you a new law." You know, the old law was if you touch a woman, if you lay with a woman, you've commit adultery. He said if you look upon her, &gt;&gt; you've already done it. &gt;&gt; The old law was if you shoot him, that's wrong. But if you can get by with just hating him, &gt;&gt; you've skinned through. No. No. But this is a new law &gt;&gt; that if you look upon a brother or sister, a human being and desire, watch this. If you look upon a germ the next morning say, "Oh, what did I do? &gt;&gt; That's murder. You're a murderer. You had the thought that's a spirit of murder. &gt;&gt; Pass through your mind. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. &gt;&gt; God, I want to be a I want to be a God man of grace and mercy &gt;&gt; and compassion. I won't have no answers. Why do you allow that? I don't know why God allowed it. I like changing that. See, you thought, why do you allow this in your church? I don't know why God allowed that in the church. &gt;&gt; You thought you were like sometimes you think a man or a church is going to have like a perfect, you know, there's not a man alive or a woman alive. It's got a perfect family. Why didn't you fix your family? &gt;&gt; If you could fix them, you would be more than a human. So why do you think a minister can fix? &gt;&gt; I don't know why God allows his people to sin and he still forgives them. But there's a word for it. It's called grace. &gt;&gt; It's called compassion and mercy. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Wow. I it just it just this just unfolded like so much. I made so many mistakes. I I I told you about my some of my little not little, forgive me, God, huge mistakes so you don't have to repeat them. That's what elders are supposed to do. That's why the older women talk to the younger women. And I'm not an older brother, but I'm telling you, Brother Dale dropped the ball hugely when I was a so-called perfect holy roller. &gt;&gt; I read a thing when we were gone on a door yesterday. I want to close with this that said Christians are not perfect, but they're forgiven. &gt;&gt; This church is not perfect, &gt;&gt; but I still love you and I don't even care. You're forgiven. So, if you're looking for perfection, probably won't see you again cuz we'll be in two different camps cuz there's no perfection around brother Dale. &gt;&gt; There's no perfection, but his perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to invite it all over me, &gt;&gt; inside me and everything. Amen. Oh, he's amazing. It just he's an amazing Lord. Amen. Let's Wow. We have come into his house. We have come into his house. We're gathered in to worship him. We have come into his house. We're gather in his name to worship him. We have come to his house. We're g to worship Christ the Lord. Worship him. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. Oh just forget about yourself. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
