amen amen praise the name of the Lord God richly bless you I pray that God would bless you for the sacrifice Amen to wake up on a Sunday morning amen prepare yourself go to the house of God in an age like this amen it's uh it's I think it's a bit of a miracle in itself that there's people that still love the Lord and they still put their trust in him amen praise be to God Amen I myself am not much of a Preacher I would say but I just yield myself to God and asked that you may use me to speak his word amen we're not here to try and show what we know or how much we know but we're just trying to be in service of God and I just pray that you keep your eyes on him amen if you find fault with me just ask God to help me because I have plenty of faults praise the name of the Lord amen God richly bless you listen to our Bibles to the Book of Matthew chapter 24. amen Matthew 24 amen this morning I just want to speak on a subject taking heed in perilous times amen taking heed in perilous times Matthew chapter 24 and we'll read verse 4 and then we'll read verse 24 as well Matthew 24 4. and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you praise the name of the Lord verse 24. for there shall rise there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect amen I'll read verse 25 as well behold I have told you before praise the name of the Lord you may have your seeds amen and amen amen the scripture we've just read is uh it's a familiar scripture to each one of us I believe and Christ was speaking after that they had told him the Bible says that the disciples were showing him the temple and how great the structure was and Jesus began by saying uh there'll come a time when there won't be one stone left upon another praise the name of the Lord and that part of his words that was already been fulfilled in Jerusalem the temple was destroyed by Titus I believe in 1870 according to prophecy that Jesus made amen and Jesus spoke about many many things throughout this chapter but we just want to take a few things because we can't talk about everything but I want to focus on taking heed amen Jesus said take heed that no man deceive you amen because the Bible also says that uh Satan presents himself like an angel of Light and he also has ministers praise the name of the Lord he has Ministers of his own false Apostles amen that also present themselves like they are the messengers of the truth of God praise the name of the Lord so God has been warning us telling us take heed that no man deceive you amen because we know that when the the serpent came in the Garden of Eden to deceive amen it wasn't Satan directly himself but he used a vessel called a serpent amen the Bible says that he was more subtle than all the the the beasts of the field amen he was an upright creature he could speak he could reason praise the name of the Lord amen and his seed is still among us today praise the name of the Lord you see not by uh not by physical traits you see but the spiritual traits is still in the Earth today present name of the Lord amen so every man and woman every child is is listening to something to someone praise the name of the Lord because there's something in you that yearns for something you see there's people who yearn for knowledge so they go after their quest in life is to gain more knowledge there's people who the thing in them is is is a quest after wealth you see some want fame praise the name of the Lord others want to be one thing or another amen it's all what's in your heart the Bible says that he says where your treasure is praise the name of the Lord you see or rather is it where your heart is there is your treasure amen I might not I may not have quoted that correctly but you understand what I'm trying to say whatever is inside of you amen is what will guide you it's what will pull you towards something praise the name of the Lord is a deep calling to the deep inside of you amen and the voice that resonates best with you has to do with the spiritual condition of your heart amen that's why Jesus said when they question him they say how come your disciples eat with unwashing hands you see and Jesus answered and he said that uh the things which defile a man is not what goes in you see it's not because your hands are soiled and you eat something without washing your hands that is going to defile you but Jesus says that the things which defile a man is what comes out of the heart praise the name of the Lord and he listed several things he says adultery is fornication murders envies all those things and Paul comes in the book of Galatians and he says the works of the flesh amen hatred witchcraft all those different things he listed them he says those are the works of the flesh praise the name of the Lord and the purpose of the Gospel was to come and cleanse us from all those things making us fit for the kingdom of God praise the name of the Lord may I stop here just a moment and say that in all that is written in the scriptures all that has been said and prophesied on the great miracles signs and wonders you see there's one thing that God is trying to achieve in man one thing the Bible says amen the spirits of just men made perfect praise the name of the Lord God is trying to perfect the human being back to what he was amen when they asked him about Elias he says the disciple says um isn't it written that Elias must first come and Jesus says yeah it is true he says Elias must first come but he's come already you see then he says and Elias truly shall come and restore all things praise the name of the Lord what was he speaking about you and I have to be restored to the perfect state of Adam and Eve stood in the Garden of Eden praise the name of the Lord and the purpose of the Gospel is to deal first and foremost with your soul you see we live in this world and your flesh is going to fall it's going to get sick it's weak it's affected by by weather and germs and all these things you see but the first thing that God wants to deal with is that Soul inside of you praise the name of the Lord that's the thing that was corrupted in the beginning when God told Adam and Eve he says that there you eat thereof that day you die he was speaking about the soul you see the soul of man died and what is what is that state of death you see he fell from his position of of fellowship with God you see man and God were on the same plane God could come and talk to man just any time he felt like it you see but man because of sin he fell from that position and Satan has been working to keep man from getting back to that position you see and the gospel came to restore us back to that place of Fellowship that is why we need a process of sanctification God wants to clean up that Soul he wants to take out the malice he wants to take out the bitterness he wants to take out the hatred all the things that Satan planted amen every every plant that my father has not planted will be what uprooted praise the name of the Lord because God planted a seed in the earth amen and he looked at or he looked at man after he had put all things together he said it was very good Hallelujah but then Satan came along and planted something like the parable Jesus spoke he said see Wild men slept an enemy came and planted different seed in that Parable Jesus says that the the good seed are the children of God Hallelujah and the bad seed are the children of the enemy amen and amen you see so God is walking is calling out to you he wants you to take heed recognize what God is trying to do in your life praise the name of the Lord God did not call us in this age just to be good church members to park message books under our armpits and say I believe the message I believe God sent a prophet see there is a greater purpose than that praise the name of the Lord he is working on the condition of your nature that's why the prophet said he said you are a Triune being your body spirit and soul amen he said then the the soul is the deepest part of you amen and he said that is the nature of your spirit see and the nature is what controls everything praise the name of the Lord if God can deal with your nature it will determine what your spirit is like and what your spirit is like determines what you do in this flesh praise the name of the Lord amen your desires have to do with the nature inside of you and that's why it is either the nature of God or the nature of Satan praise the name of the Lord excuse me That's what Satan planted in the Garden of Eden a seed of death his nature he put it in man as soon as he had planted it in man see by bringing unbelief to God's word that opened the door for that nature to come in and as soon as that was planted when God came on the scene and said Adam Adam where are you he says oh you know um I was hiding because I was afraid he says why oh because he says did you eat of the tree which I told you to not eat praise the name of the Lord Prophet come and told us he says it's not a fruit tree like many people think you see Satan said here listen to me this is what God meant but his goal was to get you to do something contrary to the word of God as soon as he got mankind to do that that evil nature entered because when God came and he said Adam what is this you have done first thing he says the woman you gave me his nature had already fallen right then and there praise the name of the Lord he said oh lord it's not my fault you see the woman you gave me she's the one who caused this see and the prophet like Prophet said he said the passing the buck already the nature of man which was perfect now was saying it's not my fault lord it's not actually the woman you you gave me her she's there's a problem there you actually you are the one who gave me that problem praise the name of the Lord you see the day you eat thereof that day you die man already fell right then and there see but God said you know what I will restore praise the name of the Lord hallelujah see so we're living in a time where the bride is is almost ready for that Perfection amen you'll notice in creation I'll just drop this in right now you notice in creation God created everything and he made even man see and male and female was in Adam and God looked and he said it's not good for man to dwell alone he says I'll make him and help meet and the last thing that was created was taken out of Adam was a bride for Adam praise be the name of the Lord the last thing is no wonder that in the Book of Revelations Hallelujah you see you read the book of Revelations yes he's talking about Christ but the focus is on two women mystery Babylon and the bride of Christ you see Christ has already done his work he's already perfect praise the name of the Lord but the work is on the bride she is the last thing that God is working on even up to the 19th Chapter it says his bride has made herself ready for it was granted unto her praise the name of the Lord that she should be arraigned in refining and clean and white praise the name of the Lord the focus on the end is on her Hallelujah so it behooves us to take heed my brother and my sister hallelujah amen praise be to God when the word of God was made flesh you see he came down in a form that he was a human being walking on this Earth amen and the prophet says that he was the type of Christ was in Adam God put him in a deep sleep then he took a bride out of him he says Christ fulfilled that Calvary you see and then from there he took out the bride of Christ was being formed through the seven Church ages and at the end she's coming to maturity amen until Christ himself will testify of his own bride and say now this is Flesh of My Flesh and bone on my bone praise be the name of the Lord you see the perfect one has to testify of you when he looks at you and he sees that you have re you you are a representation you are taken right from his side he is willing to identify himself with you he says this is Flesh of My Flesh born on my bone praise be the name of the Lord when Christ is satisfied with your nature the molding of your character that you have come to a place where like God said about Christ and mantrasfiguration this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased listen to him praise be the name of the Lord you see and the bride is coming after the same form amen hallelujah amen the spirit the scriptures rather consistently say he that Hatha near let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches see praise be the name of the Lord if you have an ear to hear amen listen what the holy spirit is saying you see the spirits in the world that people are listening to and I think for Generations people could have just said oh you you you know uh you just believe in a fable you believe this Christian thing is just a tale that's been passed through generations amen they could have said that up until now praise be the name of the Lord but what's happening now amen people who we thought were just maybe the regular unbelievers just a common person doesn't believe in God but he's living his life anyhow but now people are beginning to listen to a voice amen you see what's the voices telling them it's telling boys you know what maybe you're not a boy anymore you see there's a voice speaking what has happened that human beings cannot be what God made them to be they cannot be natural and continue through life there's another voice there's a power that is that is moving over people and it is causing them to go to a point where they're even willing to go for surgery and change themselves because a voice is speaking a power is anointing people you see go and change yourself praise the name of the Lord for Generations it might have been okay but now now you can stand and tell them okay you know what you thought I was crazy amen you thought I was crazy you see you thought I was crazy to live by the word of God to do the thing which is right to be honorable praise the name of the Lord he said to live truthfully and and as an honorable citizen praise the name of the Lord and live true to the word of God you see but now The Voice which has been pushing man to the brink and pushing man to the brink now it is showing its real face praise the name of the Lord you see Hallelujah you see now you amen you can tell people you think I'm nuts amen you think I'm crazy praise the name of the Lord when I want to raise my kids in the fear and admonition of the Lord my I want to raise my children to be respectful you see I want to live right when wives want to live faithful to their husbands husbands faithful to their wives when you want to live honest and True Praise the name of the Lord they say oh you're just religious amen but what about them now see the Bible says that because they did not want to retain the knowledge of God God gave them up and Satan gladly received them praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah now they get into a place of what now they don't know what to do a man was fellowshipping with brother Dale and sister one last night what the the school boards in different places across Canada United States they're having these meetings where parents are coming the parents are they don't know what to do why because of the content of the books which they are publishing for kids and all the garbage in it and they cannot believe that this is what a teacher will stand in front of the class and read to the students kids see longer than 10 years old praise be the name of the Lord and they're reading all this garbage to them and even in those meetings amen they recorded the videos they posted them online and when they posted them online they had to blank out the words that the the parent was reading from the book so that we can hear it in the video but in the classroom they'll read it to the kids praise be the name of the Lord what happens amen it's going home time my friends there is only one hope amen even so Lord Jesus come quickly praise be in the name of the Lord we have got to come to the place where our eyes are lifted up he says when these things come to pass lift up your heads for your Redemption draws nigh we only have one place to look but I'm I'm grateful for that place to look at because those who don't have the hope of Christ where they're looking to politicians where they look into a different plan a different place move from one country to another all this place is liberal I need to go to a more conservative Place amen the whole world is taken by that spirit praise be the name of the Lord as it was in the days of Lord so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen and amen amen hallelujah when you hear the your pastor preach on the different preachers what do you hear amen what are you listening for my brother my sister you see why are we still contending for the faith that just once delivered to the Saints why are we still why do you still come to church why are we still uh constraining you amen praise be the name alone there is something that is drawing you you see and there's coming a point in time where there's going to be a separation amen you see light and darkness cannot coexist there has to be a separation amen we're living in a time where Darkness the Bible says that gross darkness is upon the people Darkness covers the earth and grows Darkness the people praise be the name of the Lord you see the darkness on the people is worse than the darkness on the Earth Hallelujah see but the same scripture says arise and shine for your light has come you see and the glory of God is risen upon thee Hallelujah you see so the light of God has been given to us what did Jesus say when he in in Matthew sorry when you're speaking to um Nicodemus he said this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world but men love Darkness they loved it so they stuck with it but light has come amen and we're required to take heed and do something about it praise the name of the Lord amen we must come to a place where our faith is so lifted up that we are expecting at any moment that the spirit of God is going to change us out of this world the Bible says we shall be caught up amen will be changed in the twinkling of an eye taken from this Corruption of this world praise be the name of the Lord you see when we are taken up amen that these vile bodies are chains and quickened and taken to the dimension of God praise me in the name of the Lord because God has to pour His wrath upon this world I'm telling you my brother and sister this world is fit for the fire it is absolutely fit for the fire amen I'm not looking for a new politician to make a better economic plan I'm not looking for anybody to come and improve something you see down in the United States people are placing their hopes on uh Mr Trump see when when President Obama was elected it's like oh a savior has come yes we can and it's like a new thing outcome praise be the name of the Lord to those who believe in his policies they thought oh finally we have somebody and what did he do he came and he did his lot when he was finished somebody else came and did their lots and people are placing their hopes that there is a messiah who is going to come and take us back make America great again see make it great again they are hoping that they'll return to some form of Glory which they had in the past but they failed to see they did not take heed When sin was conquering every corner of the nation every facet of Life Of The Nation they did not take heed praise the name of the Lord you see and where they ended up now they are just ready the country is ready to implode praise the name of the Lord there's not a hope left in this world Hallelujah it took only about 2 000 years from the time man was made to the time man was utterly corrupted the days of Noah only two thousand years and God said I'm finished he says my spirit will not always strive with man amen he says I'm done the end of All Flesh has come up before me the Bible says but Noah found Grace in the sight of God why he lived faithful and true he took heed and he applied God's word in his life the Bible says he found Grace in the sight of God in his time praise the name of the Lord you see and even at that time the Bible says that man began to multiply it was a population boom and only eight Souls were saved only eight and Jesus says As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be that should make us release sober down and ask yourself Lord am I ready to live in that Kingdom see the question is it's not about do do you believe the message or are you a Christian this or not are you ready to live in a kingdom turn with me a moment to Revelations chapter I believe the last the last chapter of Revelation amen praise me the name of the Lord amen amen Hallelujah amen I'm just looking for a scripture maybe I can't find it but it says this he says nothing which defiles will enter that place amen nothing which defiles Jesus says the things which defile a man come from his heart that's why Jesus says You must be born again my brother and sister listened to me today you cannot justify Yourself by quotes don't try and prove that you have the Holy Ghost by finding quotes which the prophet said such and such and such and such the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing the word for your day that is true but what is believing he preached a message hearing recognizing acting on the word of God when the Holy Spirit has actually done the work in you then you can say I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I have the new birth when the spirit has done the work brother he dramatized another way he said um when a baby is born into the world you say they come from the mother's womb out into this world he said if Little Johnny was not born into the world Little Johnny does not exist you see it's a birth Hallelujah he put it rather plain if Little Johnny was not born into the world Little Johnny does not exist and if you haven't been birthed by the spirit of God from the old man made into a new creature in Christ spiritually you are not there praise be the name of the Lord if you have never come to the place and say Lord my my parents from from uh from the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve the Bible says in Adam all die because of Adam we all became sinners if you've never come to a place to recognize that that's where you come from and all that come from Adam are born into this world spiritually dead you see but the spirit of God came to Quicken you to life that's why Paul says see you who are dead in sin and trespasses has he now what quickened the Holy Spirit has to come in you and bring you to life and the prophet says when you come to life then you feed on the word of God you feed on the things of God your nature is changed from the love of the things of the world to the love of the things of God praise be the name of the Lord you see and there's so much argument in the message of oh is it with Sensations or without Sensations those things have no place you see praise be the name of the Lord amen there's women giving birth every other day every day amen every woman's experience is different I'll tell you a story one time I believe God just gave me the opportunity to be there at the time I was in Africa my dad had fallen sick it was uh rather late in the evening maybe around 10 pm so we drove him to a nearby Clinic to you know get checked out by the doctor so we're sitting there in the waiting room and this young lady came in and um she she um she was actually uh I believe like a cleaning maid in somebody's house and while she was there she began to complain of his stomach aches right he says oh you know my tummy is really hurting me blasto and so forth now she was pregnant and the agreement was like when she reaches eight months she says okay just when you reach eight months you can stop working go take care of yourself until you deliver and so on and so forth right so here she comes in it's around 10 P.M she walks into the clinic oh yeah my stomach's really hurting me and so forth and the doctor said okay so he put everybody he was dealing with he just said okay you wait we have a kind of an emergency I want to check out see what's going on so I was sitting there with my dad were waiting um and then because it was a small Clinic it wasn't like a big hospital just a small Clinic and we were sitting there and okay 30 minutes the doctor walks out and at the time they called her I believe her sister said please come you know come to the clinic your sister is here and so she came and she brought no just a minute before they called the sister the lady went in young lady and then 30 minutes later the doctor said okay we got to call your family and and they said oh yeah we have a healthy baby boy just like that right come in 30 minutes I didn't hear no crying I didn't hear no screaming I didn't hear no wailing no fight nothing because this Clinic was small we would have heard something we heard nothing next thing we see our sisters walking in the door with bags and you know baby stuff and all this stuff in 30 minutes now that was the experience of that woman she had a baby she had those her birth took place and she had the life to prove it that it was there but another woman's experience may have been three days long struggling on suffering and not a hospital until and then a baby comes full but they would both have babies you see what's my point the life that you carry is the proof that you had a birth president name of the Lord the Bible says that if any man be in Christ he is a new creation praise the name of the Lord all things are passed away behold All Things become new amen and amen hallelujah praise be the name of the Lord amen amen the voice of God called Abraham you see Abraham two kid when God spoke he listened oh God bless you brother thank you amen you see Abraham listened because God spoke now men have not always listened but Abraham listened amen now here's a problem with many of us when Abraham was told Abraham leave your Kindred leave your father's house and go to a place I will show you the call was for Abraham the Bible says Abraham packed his daddy along with him and he packed his nephew lot praise be in the name of the Lord he took him along but the call was for Abraham amen Lord did not have that call but Lord decided okay I'll go along that's like many church members today oh well I'm a Christian called my parents I was raised in a Christian home and you know praise the name of the Lord oh you know I I just it's just something I've been doing for years praise the name of the Lord but did God ever speak to your heart and tell you see this world is perishing you're a sinner you need salvation you see and I gave my son for the purpose that you might be saved from this Dying World you see did God call you or are you just following the crowd remember you will enter Heaven as an individual see mommy may go and daddy may go and that doesn't does not guarantee that you're going to go in praise be the name of the Lord you see even even being a church member here you see don't depend on your church membership find out for yourself Hallelujah you see oh I was born in the message this is all I've ever known Satan will get you somewhere and I've seen it over the years people grow up in the message they they come to church they they follow the dues on the doors they live a very legalistic life they just know do this don't do that stay away from this stay away from that but there comes a place where Satan begins to work on that mind amen he begins to work on that mind Hallelujah you see praise be the name of the Lord by the grace of God I can say by the grace of God I was born in the message too my parents over but when I was born my parents were already believers you see but I went through school I went through the pressures the peer pressure all you are trying to fit in the crowd you're trying to do this you see and the nature in you was drawing you to those things but you knew because Mommy and Daddy have taught me I shouldn't do this so you see but the desire is in you you see you're still a sinner oh yeah I've been through it praise the name of the Lord but by the grace of God God brought me to a place where I began to ask myself and I pray to God I said Lord what is this message all about what is the gospel all about what is this what's it all about oh I've heard it all my life things I've heard this I heard the prophet's messages but I had to come to a place where I had to ask the question myself you see it's the same thing a lot should have done where am I going why am I picking up my family and my goods and and I'm following Abraham you see he should have asked himself that question but he did not have the call praise the name of the Lord that's why the prophet said you must come to a personal experience with God for yourself amen praise be to God if you've just been following somebody maybe you're following a brother sister mommy daddy you need to come to a place where you go to God and ask God for yourself Lord what about me see what do you have for me what's what's this all about praise the name of the Lord you see he he he just followed Abraham lot did and there came a time where the rubber began to meet the road Strife came between the two of them and Abraham he just said he said Lord you pick if you go this way I'll go the other way praise the name of the Lord you see now what was in his heart began to show the Bible says he picks the more well how did he put it see the well-watered plains praise the name of the Lord and he pitched his tent toward Sodom where was his heart that way Sodom and the Bible says Abraham remains whatever law didn't pick he chose and he stayed there but he had the call of God so he knew what he was doing but what was in in Lord's heart Drew him to the place where he went praise the name of the Lord you've got to hear the voice of God for yourself or you'll end up like lot and his wife even in the hour of judgment when the angels of God said Lots he says take your family get out of this place because it's going to be burned and don't look back but because of what was in our hearts even when the Angels were grabbing them and pulling them out of the city you see because her heart was still there she turned around and she looked and she turned to a pill of salt what did Jesus say remember Lord's wife you see if the wrong thing is in your heart even God himself can come and grab you but because your heart is still there you perish God himself came to Cain he says Cain he says if you'll do like your brother you'll be accepted not a prophet it wasn't Moses or Elijah standing there before Cain it was God himself lip to ear it still couldn't change Cain praise be the name of the Lord you see may God help us Hallelujah the Bible says watch your heart because out of it are the issues of life amen praise be the name of the Lord remember Lord's wife Hallelujah Lord went along for the journey he had no call of God it showed up in a Time Or the critical moment amen hallelujah amen why would a man make his dwelling among such a people why would Lots be drawn to the sodomites you see why was his heart drawn towards them you see the world was in his heart what was in Sodom was in his heart oh he may not have been uh uh lived there kind of Lifestyle but he had to be in that environment you see oh you know I like I like the the popular way of the day you see I like to be where the action is praise the name of the Lord amen where the popular thing is going on praise the name of the Lord hallelujah but Abraham he chose to walk with God amen why he heedth to the voice of God Amen and amen Abraham had the promise and the faith for him see rapturing Faith he said rapturing Faith yes he did amen God called Abraham he says Abraham leave your father's house and your Kindred he says go to a land that will show you Abraham began walking that's what God Said go he started going praise the name of the Lord you see and then along the way Abraham said God said to Abraham he says uh uh I will make you a father of living in Nations he says love look at me he says I don't have a child only person I have is the servant of mine God said I will give you a son God planted the seed for rapturing Faith what a body change Hallelujah and in the in due time when all the scripture goes God came and he transformed Abraham and Sarah change them amen and they had that son the same thing that God will do to the bride in the last day our body change let me stop your money the prophet said that death does not change you just remember this the state in which you are right now or if the Lord should call you say your time is up the prophet said death doesn't change you one bit it changes your dwelling place but not your condition not your nature nothing if you're hateful now you will go hateful if you're bitter now you'll go bitter if you are full of malice and all kinds of evil things the state in which you die is the state in which you go that's the state in which you stand before God amen remember I said that's why salvation has to do with the nature of man amen even may I say this the Rapture will not change you praise be the name of the Lord the Rapture will change this body the Bible says so this vile bodies will be changed Hallelujah by the nature of your soul God is working on that right now this is the time for the change of the Soul that is why you should be on your knees crying before God and say Lord transform me you see the Bible says in first John summer it says everyone who has this hope purifies himself even as Christ is pure everyone who has that hope of a body change purifies himself what did Jesus say If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me what does that mean die to stop every day go on you and you say Lord I had a temper tantrum the other day I need that gone you stay on your knees you pray to God until you see that thing dry up oh Lord I lost it after this man a laughter Allah said after that woman when I uh Lord I I failed you that's where God wants you to be see your thoughts and confess it praise the name of the Lord when he came to Jacob and he was wrestling with God that day what was the question God asked Jacob what's your name what was he asking for Jacob I need you to confess what you are what does Jacob mean sir planter cheat that's what God was looking for Jacob was busy doing this and doing that scheme but when he met God God said what's your name what was he asking for confession when the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it's not just saying all repent God is saying look at yourself and recognize that you're a sinner and you need Deliverance that's what repent means you cannot properly repent until you recognize you cannot apologize to somebody and truly mean that you're sorry until you see what your fault is then you come to somebody say you know what I I really messed up I Did You Wrong please forgive me you see that is a true apology when you come to God and say Lord I ain't no good please help me then God says voila praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen I'll give you another example Isaiah chapter 6 The Bible says amen he says um I saw the Lord high and lifted and his train filled the Temple and so forth you see you know the vision that he saw he says the the cherubim says with two Wings they they they they with two Wings they flew with two they covered their feet and so on and so forth see and they were crying holy holy day and night and Isaiah said when he saw that he said woe is me for I am an unclean man and I have unclean lips and I dwell among people also who are unclean in the presence of God he saw his his his filth he said woe is me and he began to confess he says Lord I'm a man of unclean lips when he made that confession the Bible says what one of the Angels he says he took the tongues took a call from the fire of the of the Altar and he came and he touched his lips then he said now who shall I send now Isaiah was willing to say Lord here I am send me he says your lips are now cleansed your iniquity is taken away only after confession praise the name of the Lord he heard you see he heard the voice of God and he knew what he had to do my brother my sister what Peter spoke in Acts 2 38 was what the same principle confession to God based on seeing your weakness how weak how terrible how download you are when you come to that place you say Lord kill this one off give me the new one that's when God will begin working praise the name of the Lord that is the bride that's going in the Rapture amen you know what the difference between a foolish virgin and the wise virgin that very thing death to self recognizing that you're a sinner and dying to that thing the prophet preached the message you must be born again he said you must die until there's only just an empty shell left go listen to it when you get a chance he says you die to suffer until there's nothing but an empty shell praise the name of the Lord the fire of God so consumes everything that you are then now God comes and puts his Spirit In You you see what did Jesus say what did Paul's a rather John say Christ will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire he must destroy that old nature completely Hallelujah when Jesus was about to be crucified he said the prince of this world cometh and he has nothing in me what was Jesus saying Satan has no claim whatsoever in this one he says he's got nothing at all amen what did Jesus say who can accuse me of sin did not have a place where he could hold in Christ he tried everything he found nothing praise be the name of the Lord but when he comes to you he finds all kinds of faults that's why he can try tripping you up here you see some people suffer with lust and some with temper and others with this and different things oh we're not Angels my brother and sister oh not at all we come to church and oh praise the Lord God bless you we are sinners saved by grace picked up by the grace of God you see and when we come to the place where we recognize that you see then we place ourselves on the altar of God and say Lord kill it the prophet said we need a killing spiritually speaking are dying to self this Lord destroyed destroy everything that is sinful in me destroy anything that will defile your kingdom destroy anything that is against your nature your will and your word Lord destroy it wrestle with god with that thing praise the name of the Lord you see and then you come up Anew that's what Jesus says accept a cone of a grain of corn unless it falls in the ground and die it abides alone that's just a regular church member they come to church in go home in out you abide alone the moment you die to self brother you begin to see things happening what would Jesus say out of his belly shall flow you begin to see things happen you say Lord how did that happen why you die to self the seed was planted how can that grain of corn that single explain what happens when you put it in the ground next thing you know a shoot comes up then a stock then the carbs begin to form and they multiply if that seed could speak amen he said I don't know how it happens but what happened he says I got planted in the ground I died I rotten you see and then the law of God took effects and this is what happened out of his belly shall flow praise the name of the Lord things that you cannot explain but because of the law of God it takes effect Hallelujah you see that's why Paul says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me see it's not you anymore but it's Christ bringing this out bringing Grace bringing Mercy see Hallelujah when they Smite you on the cheek you turn the other cheek you couldn't do that on your own but Christ in you can do that you see Hallelujah like they say don't try that at home if you have never given yourself to Christ to bring you to that place don't go try and manifest that amen somebody will hit you one time too hard amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and even then you die every day daily amen Paul was born again he received the Holy Ghost one time he was taken before the magistrates and the Sanhedrin and the the high priest told their servant he says hit him an events multiple part and Paul he's he said you widered wall amen praise the name of the Lord he responded you see so you have to Die daily every day because I'm telling you the devil's right beside you waiting trying to set something for you to fall praise the name of the Lord so you die every day the prophet said you sin every day not willfully but this flesh is with you you must bring it under subjection every day praise the name of the Lord this is the struggle of the believer praise the name of the Lord oh God I'm not going to even finish the sermon amen praise the name of the Lord taking heed in perilous times hallelujah amen you notice Abraham there's a time when God now came judgment was about to fall amen praise the name of the Lord judgment was about to fall amen God was going to do something and he came and he visited Abraham The Three Angels came down to his house amen and we know the story how it goes I'm not going to go through it all amen but he had the call lot had already separated himself and he had gone down to Sodom amen God came now to his Chosen One amen Hallelujah see he took he took heed so God now began to reveal his secrets to him he said I'll not hide what I'm going to do from Abraham Amen Let me just read it Genesis chapter 18. Hallelujah Genesis 18. after he discerned what Sarah Hadid she had laughed verse 17 he says and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which has spoken of him praise the name of the Lord God because Abraham was faithful and he took him he said you know what I'm going to now I I'm going to reveal what's in my heart to him and the prophet said that God does not reveal his secrets to those unbelievers amen he Reveals His secrets to his chosen praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah you see we are in an hour of judgment now now is not an hour of building uh great big churches and reputations and this and that and trying to be this do all these things it's an hour of judgment it's a time for the bride of Christ to be taken up brother and sister we have to be expecting a rapture I don't know how you can live in this time and not be saying Lord help me we need to get out of this world there's nothing which is going to come and suddenly change it another way it's not coming we're living in an hour of judgment and we must be prepared to leave this world that is our faith that is the Bible that's our promise praise the name of the Lord we can't be looking for anything else praise the name of the Lord amen Hallelujah you see we're in a time of judgment time of church politics is finished it's dead it's run it's course it's finished brother and sister amen time of affiliations oh I should be affiliated with this one and affiliate with that those days are dead it means nothing you're either going in the Rapture or you're not and you're not going because of affiliation people feel like I'm a brother so and so you know then we'll be ready for the Rapture there's no then we will be ready for the Rapture there's no such a thing are you ready as an individual Hallelujah amen you see amen that is the only future that there is hallelujah this thing is absolutely finished it's done it's over with praise the name of the Lord sin has conquered the whole thing Satan has got mankind so under his grip people cannot think for themselves anymore they are thinking the thoughts of Satan the Bible says there came a time where the imaginations of men were continually evil every time you think amen some of you know you're in your workplace with unbelievers you got to watch what comes out of your mouth because somebody will take it and twist it to and to be something filthy I knew you were just having a innocent clean conversation but they find a way to twist your words the imaginations of man are continually evil praise the name of the Lord God help us Mercy has been spurned and only judgment is left the Bible says make your calling a new election sure make your calling amen praise the name of the Lord you as an individual amen we can help one another we can encourage one another the Bible says provoke one another unto good works amen Hallelujah we must help one another as brothers and sisters what towards the kingdom of God don't ever be guilty of putting a stumbling block the Bible says that don't be guilty of putting a stumbling block before your brother or your sister to stumble them you see hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen and amen glory be to God Hallelujah now the voice of the spirit now is saying get ready it's time to get out when they came to to Lots they say lots get out four he says I cannot do what I want to do until you come hither I can't do what I want to do until you get out you see and God is now the judgments are ready they're talking nuclear war already you see we'll just take a crazy month one time to say you know what let the whole thing go just one crazy man amen you know what the prophet has said he says it will take somebody a little bit too much vodka and he'll say you know what what difference does it make now and the whole thing will go up and smoke now we know that there's a tribulation and all that stuff to go then they'll bomb themselves after praise the name of the Lord but we want to be hidden in Christ the prophet preached the message the rapture he read it the scripture from Psalms where he says amen he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty we need to get in that secret place of Christ that is the faith of the believer in this hour hidden away in Christ he was faithful to Abraham he was faithful to Israel he says I'll deliver you with a mighty hand he was faithful he was faithful to to Elijah he was faithful to every single one of them God never left his own David says I was young now I'm all he says I've never seen the righteous forsaken praise the name of the Lord God has been faithful in every generation today he has been faithful to give us a way out when denominations are deceiving people you see all belong to us believe it this way a prophet comes and says none of them get back to the word of God Amen in the word of God is our safety that is our faith praise the name of the Lord get ready it's time to get out by the rupture anything left behind will not be spared amen the prophet said that you don't want to be here during tribulation time he says it were better they cut your stomach open and poured sulfuric acid go read it you'll find it better they cut your stomach open and pour something acid inside now I don't want to imagine I don't want to know what that feels like but he said you don't want to be here why why is a tribulation such a terrible time some people are Banking and say well if I don't make it uh you know I'll stand for Christ in the tribulation don't take that chance why Jesus Christ suffered he suffered so that you don't have to suffer remember sin has to be paid for even though God forgives sin has to be paid for somebody something somewhere has to pay for sin because he said the soul that sinneth it shall die the day you eat thereof that day you die so sin has the penalty has to be paid if Jesus had not paid it for us we would have to pay for it you see how important the sacrifice of Christ is now Jesus Paid for sin the Bible says the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world but then the same Bible also says that see he died for the sins of many because not all accept him so the ones that accept him the Bible says he gave them power to be called the sons of God because they received him they received the sacrifice and the sacrifice of Christ is not just saying Lord I believe I thank you for dying for my sins but it is going through and letting the Holy Spirit divorce Sin from you entirely amen because the Bible says that um the worshiper wants pursed has no more conscience of sin God is working on perfecting individuals I mean brother sister literally perfecting you and I that we can stand as perfect human beings the prophet preach the message the statue of a perfect man what was he preaching about the nature of man from Faith virtue knowledge Temperance he says and when these things are in you you see what did they call that the Bible call it but take us of the divine nature sinless that's what this is all about to become sinless and spotless now we know justification is what God sees and does for us he says you know what you didn't you didn't choose to be a sinner your parents did it in the Garden of Eden they saw the whole human race so God Justified he says it wasn't your doing but still you come out of Sinner anyhow now God says now here's a way for you to get back but you have to take it praise the name of the Lord so you have to let the Holy Spirit the same way the the transgender and sodomites and whatever they are and letting a spirit get on them and then they become what that spirit says do so you must also let the Holy Spirit come upon you and make you what the holy spirit says do and that is only according to the word of God praise the name of the Lord it makes you live out the word it brings the life of God into human flesh again Hallelujah that's what the Bible says amen he says God has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers evangelists he says what for the edification for the perfecting of the Saints until we come pray the name of the Lord to the Statue to the measure of the Statue of Christ there's a measure God is looking for he'll look and say brother Mount I'm looking for a measure here's your portion brother man here when you reach this that's what I'm expecting of you praise the name of the Lord every brother every sister God has a measure that he's expecting of you so press like Paul says he says I don't claim to have reached but I press towards the mark of the the calling the High Calling which is in Christ I'm pressing towards it he says I'm not saying I'm there but I'm still pressing Lord help me let me press on press the name of the Lord Hallelujah I'm pressing on the upward way pressing day by day Satan would try and set trust before you discouragements but brother sister keep that goal in front of you that's the prize amen when people are running a race there's a prize they're looking for if there's eight of them they're all looking at the same price so Paul says run that you might obtain praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah so why tribulation is such a bad thing Christ suffered it amen let's read it in the Bible Isaiah 61 let me go quickly then I'll close here amen praise the name of the Lord Isaiah chapter 61. amen Bible says here when Jesus this is the scripture Jesus read when he picked up the Scrolls in the temple amen I just want to jump to I'll read verse one and two the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek that he or he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the Bible says in the New Testament he closed the book after that middle section he didn't finish verse two he says to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord the prophet came and said that is the day of redemption you see buying the Brokenhearted set the captives free Proclaim Liberty to those who are captive are captives why Jesus came to set free see he took the price of sin upon himself Isaiah 53 he suffered for us and amen praise the name of the Lord and He took that upon himself so we don't have to so he paid the price the penalty so we can go free that is what the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book set it down amen jump to chapter 63. verse 1 who is this that Cometh From Edom with died garments from bosra this that is glorious in his apparel traveling in the greatness of his strength I that speak in righteousness mighty to save wherefore are thou read in thine Apparel in other words why are you Red why are your garments red and your garments like him that shredeth in the wine fund then he answered I have trodden The Wine Press alone and of the people there was none with me for I will tread them in my anger and trample them in my Fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and I will stain all my arraignment for the day of vengeance is in my heart and the year of my redeemed is come that's the other part of verse 2 of Isaiah 61. see if you continue verse 2 chapter 61 and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that Moon just think of it from the beginning of verse 2 to the middle is over 2000 years you see how God's word is written sometimes we just read through the whole thing and oh when will this happen see the first part to proclaim the acceptability of the Lord he did it seven churches go by praise the name of the Lord at the end of that the day of vengeance and now he comes to what to manifest the day of Vengeance he says why because I trod the winepress of the wrath of God Alone praise the name of the Lord so to reject that what he has done to reject it you pay for it in the tribulation that's what the prophet said he said the what the foolish Virgin Goes to the tribulation for what purification they pay for it themselves why because Christ has already done it and you reject it so what else is God going to do he says well I don't know what else to give you go pay for it yourself God help us take heed in perilous times my brother my sister Hallelujah see amen and amen only a new creation is what will go in that is the difference like I said between the wise and this foolish virgin amen you are wise because you took what Christ has done and you let God manifest apply it in your life you have to be changed my brother and sister you have to Die daily you have to the Bible says work out your own salvation don't say oh Lord I accept you as my savior and then I'll be going to church every Sunday and I'll be nice I'll be a good neighbor that's not how it works get on your knees and die say Lord like David says Lord search me o God and know my heart today see if there be any wicked way in me continually Lord is there anything that will defile because the Bible says nothing with the files will enter therein so you must be perfected here we must every one of us be perfected here and you can't do that in your own strength how can I perfect myself I have to cry out to God and say Lord I'm struggling with this thing Lord I'm struggling with that thing help me see I have a funny feeling towards this Brother people do things they rub you the wrong way oh yeah we're still here in this flesh We're Not Angels we're not above those things things rub us the wrong way you see and we must come to God and say Lord help me overcome help me overcome and what does the Bible say in your weakness the strength of God is made perfect that's why Paul says I will glory in my infirmities because I know when I am weak Hallelujah then I am strong Hallelujah we sang that song earlier today they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength if you read that scripture it says even these young men shall fail amen those who depend on themselves on whatever they are you will fail my brother my sister but when you get weak before God then God renews your strength Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen how much time do we have brother I think I've exhausted my time here I've lost track of time amen just let me bring this to a close amen amen just a few minutes just bear with me Hallelujah amen now we're dealing with two spirits in the world you're influenced by one or the other you see every day that you live you're influenced by one or the other amen the Antichrist calls the fallen in the in the beginning but Christ has given you a way out by regenerating your soul you see amen the Bible says that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world if you have received him in you I don't believe in standing on the puppet and saying oh you praise the Lord you have the Holy Ghost because you believe the message I don't believe in that stuff Paul even says he says if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you if Hallelujah if it does then you're okay but not for a preacher to say oh yeah you find this you're good no no no no find out for yourself sweat it out like Jacob did praise the name of the Lord wrestle with God amen Hallelujah only you that's between you and God amen Hallelujah two Spirits amen you cannot overcome Satan on your own strength that's why the world is going through what they're going through the Bible says the holy they cannot receive the Holy Spirit that's what Jesus said the spirit of God they can't receive it why because they are not of the seed of God they can't receive the Holy Ghost so what happens Satan just takes them and is playing with them Hallelujah like a cat playing over the mouse he's just tossing them any way he wants it's the grace of God that we can receive the word of God just think of it it's the grace of God that you can even still in this hour here come to hear God's word and listen and receive it and Obey it and believe it it's the grace of God the Bible says the goodness of God leads you to repentance the goodness is not he that Wills or he that runs but God who shows Mercy don't spurn your day of Mercy my brother and sister Hallelujah amen and amen let me just read the quote here amen this is what we are today this is what the prophet said amen he said now this is the hour in which we live notice God promised that he would bring his bride out what he would do there would be a seed there would be a light in the evening time how he would do these things just exactly by the way he originally planned it in the Old Testament and the New Testament it isn't through denomination and may I say this we have denomination in the message circles we certainly do just because you say message message this brother Brandon doesn't mean the denominational spirit is also working in a message people have set up clicks and Clans and you belong and that one is out and this one is in you see they are there denominational spirits praise the name of the Lord they know better than to set up a headquarters and Bishops and archbishops but they practice it or they surely do there's the big fish in the pond and he's over the rest of them and that all that kind of stuff exists praise the name of the Lord you see Hallelujah the way he would plan to do it and it isn't through denomination it isn't through our system we're using today we're just causing death that people put their hands on it and die from it this is from the message trying to do God a service without being his will see the word the evening message must carry evening results we have to be expecting something we go into something with expectation Amen brother Dale is a farmer he goes and he plants at a certain time of the year with expectation if he plans something and something else comes up in Harvest time something has gone wrong you see somebody deceived or an enemy has done this praise the name of the Lord so you saw with expectation the evening message must carry evening results the evening message must now must rather sow evening seed not morning seed evening seed is that right the midday scene it seeds back there was denomination it died it perished but evening time message will show evening time light will show evening time results the evening time message Jesus time midday message just listen carefully it showed midday results what was the what was the the midday message the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world that was the time for Christ to come and manifest that the word was made flesh the Messiah came in human flesh see the beginning message showed beginning results he made creation Genesis so Genesis time of Christ and then now evening results see then he says he made his son in his own image in the midday in the evening time he makes a bride for it remember what I said at the beginning in the Book of Revelation at the end what is it it's two women it's bright time it was Eve's time after Adam was made and created and formed and God said it's not good that man was alone the last thing he formed was what a bride for Adam so the last thing that God is working on also is a bride for Christ the evening message is the bride to be made manifest that's the results we're looking for see how did he how did he how did he form the Earth how did he speak into existence by his word who was his son the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us how will he take his bride by the word not by a new card not by some theologians that they are but according to his word he'll identify or not though when you say the word that's a general statement but when you break it down see he'll identify her don't put one thing to it or take one thing from it now leave it the way it is see now what's he doing he's calling out a bride and when he calls the bride he himself has to come and identify her just like Adam when God brought the bride to Adam Adam looked and says now this is Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone see and how will Christ identify the bride those that go in the rapture the chosen ones the faithful ones the undefiled the perfect ones the ones that have grown in the Statue of Christ what's the statue of Christ the divine nature and Christ comes to identify and says yeah that one is mine she's Spirit of my friend she's my spirit she's nature of my nature she's born on my bone fly everything that she is he identifies and he says that's the one and he takes her that's how the bride is identified and the prophet said she will be the word word upon word upon word line upon line here little there little so we must work out our own salvation with fear and trembling read the word listen to it what does it tell you to do he that has this hope this whole brother purifies himself even as he is pure so what is she doing she is only taking what he gives her Eve didn't say no you know what I'll be like this and I'll be like that and I'll form myself like no it's just what God made and he presented and he says this is bone of my bone flesh in my flesh another type Esther amen the Bible says she did not ask for anything but she took only what was given to her for purification praise the name of the Lord in Revelations 19 the brides the Bible says the bride has made herself ready and it was granted to her amen one last scripture oh just something coming to mind amen Isaiah chapter 4. Isaiah chapter 4. verse 1. he says this is the contrary and in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel the branch of the Lord the bride will escape these things but the the ungodly women now here are saying women but that's a type of what churches they're ungodly they say you know what we provide our own things I dress the way I want to dress I eat my own bread I do my own thing I just want to be identified with you because my name is not so good my reputation is not so good you see but I just want to be identified with you so that my Approach is taken away because I'm identified with so and so you see the difference praise the name of the Lord but the bride only takes that which is granted to her given to her you see and the Bible says that Esther found favor above all the rest in the sight of the king president she was that Chosen One my brother and sister take heed in this hour because Satan is going deceiving people Jesus says let no man deceive you praise be the name of the Lord God help us amen glory be to God just like the word was made flesh in Genesis in John 1. the word also has to be made flesh in the bride Hallelujah he is the perfect one take heed be careful what you're listening to be careful what you're taking in it must be the word of God because it will build on that and that alone when God claims his own he'll be claiming that which came from the word that is it amen and amen oh God help us amen so we are expecting a rapture and that is what we're pressing for my brother sister press for that and that alone live your life do your responsibility is what you must do you know and by the grace of God you see God has taken care of every one of us he feeds us he clothes us he gives us shelter amen oh we may not have it in store for you know the Next Generation and build wealth and all those kind of things but that's not what we're looking for if God blesses you in this life praise God thank God for it but remember when you leave you're leaving every bit of it you're leaving every little bit of it behind amen but God says he says Don't Fear I will never leave you nor forsake you so we may say that God is our helper praise the name of the Lord you see so keep your eyes on the prize be careful what is going into your ear because Satan is going around seeking whom he made before like he's going like a lion he wants to shake you this way discourage you that way this is a new there's a lot of stuff going around people who claim to believe the message some of them overseas and then the enemy came and because they were not rooted and grounded now it is starting to twist the message teaching things which are they shouldn't be even saying why destroying the faith of many in this last day message the message is meant to prepare a bride by the word but what are they doing they're destroying confidence in the messenger of God they're destroying confidence in what he has taught us what are they doing he's Satan again it's like that Beetle that insect he just doesn't come in one big Fell Swoop but he starts a little bit sowing seeds of doubt but remember build your hopes on Christ and I'm telling you if you have come to contact with Christ if the Holy Spirit and you have met together and you deal with you deal with him he deals with you amen you will not fall he will keep you in the hour of Temptation when enemy comes in lights the Bible says the spirit of God will raise up a standard amen the prophet said things will be flying around isms years ago amen there's a group from western Canada I'm not going to mention names but they started something they shook the faith of many preachers fell pastors who have been pastors for 40 years they gave up the message altogether they said you know what oh this that and the other see that was one round don't think the devil is done don't think he's finished he's coming for another round he is going to come again and again why he knows his time is short so he wants to shake the faith of many if you're not grounded like I said in the word don't follow Man follow Christ and Christ is the holy spirit now he's in the form of the Holy Ghost now that's how he deals with you and I you know many times that seems to be far-fetched to people I'm closing Five fish people say oh the Holy Spirit you know yeah we know that God dealt with brother Branham and God dealt with so and so but how about me oh me you know I no God wants to deal with you he has a measure for you praise the name of the Lord you may not be speaking squirrels into existence and stopping storms and all of that but brother Branham says that the same power is in you he says no he doesn't have to do it with everybody that's what he said see God Called Moses to call the Flies and all those things Same Spirit but he didn't have to get every single man to do it the rest of them had to believe when they asked Jesus they said what can we do that we work the works of God he said believe on he whom God has sent so where what are we believing for our souls but while we walk this walk we get sick we call on the Lord he is still the Healer of all our diseases the Bible says don't forget his benefits so let us not just become saying the soul the soul the soul the soul the soul and forget all the other benefits of God I am the Lord that heals all your diseases so don't let your faith waver don't say that God cannot do this today God cannot do that have faith in God how does God given you to act he says is any sick among you let him call the Elders of the church Anointed with oil see pray he says the prayer of faith shall save the sick and if he has committed any sins he'll be forgiven we have a course of action they that believe shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that is our part to do it's God's part to keep the other end of the bargain so do your part anyhow praise the name of the Lord have faith in God Amen and one of these days I Believe by the grace of God will take us out of this place amen so encourage one another now's a time where we need to encourage one another so much more so much more my brother and sister there's so much going on see so much things are tearing people apart oh I've seen the enemy come in and just ravage relationships destroy things destroy that and then by cling together by the spirit of God you see and the prophet said that if the enemy are sent is using somebody to cause problems Division and so forth he says they will either line up see with their truth with the spirit of God or they will get out you see but let's fan the Flames of the Holy Spirit the love of God the truth the word of God that which is good the Bible says hold fast that which is good prove all things amen Hallelujah when we do that then the enemy can't shake us amen and the vessels the vessels of the enemy when they come in if they're agents of the devil they say ah those ones are too bound together by the love of God they're tight amen can't shake them so what do they do you move on praise be the name of the Lord may God give us more grace amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen I'm pressing on the upward Way New Heights I'm gaining every day Hallelujah mm-hmm I'm pressing on the upward way New Heights I'm gay [Music] every day still praying us I'm one word about Lord plant my feet your ground Lord Lift Me Up and let me stand by faith on him then Stables a higher place foreign [Music] [Music] those some
