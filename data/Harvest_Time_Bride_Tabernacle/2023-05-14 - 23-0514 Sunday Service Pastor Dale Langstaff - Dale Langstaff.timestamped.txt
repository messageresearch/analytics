[29:08] amen
[29:10] Hallelujah let's just uh we just greet
[29:14] the mothers
[29:15] a special way
[29:18] maybe maybe before I I read our
[29:22] scriptures
[29:27] I'll read a quote that a prophet said
[29:33] man
[29:36] he said I would like my mother
[29:40] come and sit on the platform
[29:42] with me now
[29:48] he said I know she's real boxer
[29:51] just like I was
[29:53] used to be
[29:56] nice
[29:58] you'd think if a minister asked all the
[30:00] mothers to come sit in the platform
[30:01] you'd think he'd maybe went cuckoo
[30:06] but that was what the prophets are
[30:13] amen he said I think mothers are the
[30:16] Fifth Gospel
[30:18] he said she came before Matthew Mark
[30:20] Luke and John
[30:22] because mother got him first
[30:24] and they're the ones that bring them up
[30:27] first
[30:29] his mother
[30:31] Hallelujah
[30:33] let's turn to
[30:36] or scriptures
[30:39] waiting on God events let's go to Psalms
[30:42] on 127.
[30:45] and three when twenty seven and three
[30:47] just greet you all and wish you all
[30:50] happy Mother's Day in and the church has
[30:53] something for the mothers after
[30:55] amen

[31:01] see
[31:04] oh man just a good day of fellowshipping
[31:06] man thank God for the beautiful weather
[31:07] and
[31:08] springtime
[31:10] also just in a way of testimony we went
[31:13] over to uh Dan right left right left
[31:19] Church which was Sam Johnson's old
[31:22] church I believe it's a new building now
[31:25] beautiful beautiful building and and we
[31:29] we had a wonderful
[31:32] day
[31:33] they treated us like for loyalty it was
[31:36] just beautiful I had never actually met
[31:39] Dan in the flesh
[31:41] but he treated us
[31:44] amazing
[31:46] it would have been impossible to treat
[31:47] us any nicer and he desires to have
[31:50] long-term friendship with us and and the
[31:53] church's code Mingo and all that their
[31:56] church is about the same as ours size
[31:58] wise and Manning and it was just
[32:01] beautiful from the beginning to end the
[32:03] message that uh Pastor Abraham brought
[32:06] from Uganda I'm going to steal I'm in a
[32:09] I put my fishing rod in his pond already
[32:12] and I got enough of his inspiration to
[32:15] uh make add to and and it was just
[32:19] really a wonderful wonderful message and
[32:23] it was a you know wheat Church started
[32:24] that quarter after seven on Wednesday
[32:26] and we got back to our room about 11 30.
[32:29] and we're not that far from church it
[32:31] was a good two and a half hours of solid
[32:33] preaching and altar call after
[32:35] a little prayer line on a Wednesday
[32:37] night and believe me
[32:39] it was worth the state
[32:41] it was really nice and we are honored to
[32:43] have our grandkids with us
[32:46] brother Bernard's kids and so I was
[32:49] Grandma and Grandpa and that was a great
[32:51] privilege and sister Ruth went with us
[32:53] and it was just fantastic from the
[32:55] beginning to end
[32:57] and so uh also in that same line You'll
[33:00] see I put out another poster and man I
[33:03] encourage you to you know you know I'm
[33:05] going to read a quote today that God
[33:06] Made You for Fellowship
[33:09] that that was that was God was lonely
[33:12] that's what the Bible says and God
[33:14] redeemed you so you would come back into
[33:17] fellowship with him and our Prophet said
[33:19] that when you if if you backslid
[33:22] and you really came from God you're
[33:25] you're just out of Fellowship
[33:27] but when you get redeemed back
[33:29] you know he don't lose see you know I
[33:32] said there you know when I he asked you
[33:34] know we had a good time and he asked us
[33:35] to pray and I I mentioned it here and it
[33:38] must have came out different because
[33:39] sister Ruth even said uh you know it was
[33:42] just a blessing to her but you know when
[33:45] the in the Bible in Genesis 1 27 and 28
[33:48] when God made you ask you to make you
[33:52] the prophet said you were God's logos
[33:55] we normally call it theophany
[33:59] but you're going to find out that if we
[34:01] really come into maturity and we're
[34:03] living on the word of God
[34:05] we're going to take a lot you know the
[34:06] you know people came to the prophet I'm
[34:08] sorry I'm preaching but and they said
[34:10] well I don't believe in this
[34:12] he said well of course you don't because
[34:13] you're not a believer
[34:15] but if we actually become believers
[34:19] if we actually come to the to Statue of
[34:22] a perfect man and we actually are mature
[34:24] believers
[34:26] you know when I was studying like like I
[34:29] was so stunned in some of the things
[34:30] that the prophet said that I I was
[34:33] almost cautious to even mention them
[34:35] this morning
[34:36] because it was coming to the fullness of
[34:38] if we take the word of God you know the
[34:40] Bible says that all all
[34:43] that's a Double L scripture is given for
[34:46] inspiration
[34:49] Doctrine
[34:51] that's pretty solid
[34:56] wow
[35:00] wow
[35:01] Psalms one let's read this amen
[35:04] low children are a Heritage of the Lord
[35:06] and the fruit of the room is his reward
[35:09] as arrows in the hand of a mighty man so
[35:11] are children
[35:13] of the youth happy is a man whose quiver
[35:17] is full of them and they shall not be
[35:20] ashamed but they shall speak
[35:23] with the enemies
[35:25] in the gate
[35:27] amen
[35:29] we just ask God to add the blessing to
[35:31] his word amen is used to be seated
[35:33] tonight amen
[35:39] let's turn to First Corinthians 10 and
[35:41] 13. and we're going to lay a foundation
[35:43] and we're going to talk about coming
[35:44] into this into this statue of a perfect
[35:47] man in the fullness in Christianity and
[35:50] and you're going to be able to take God
[35:52] at his word and we live in in adult
[35:54] States way too long you know like you're
[35:57] doubting your healing but you're God's
[35:59] logos
[36:01] but you're the logos of God in the
[36:03] spirit man but you doubt whether God
[36:05] could save you heal you or save your
[36:07] kids but you're actually God
[36:09] you are actually when when God made you
[36:13] in the logos the prophet said the
[36:15] brother Brown said that that was exactly
[36:18] how he made the son Jesus Christ
[36:23] now you wonder when Jesus Christ came to
[36:25] the world and he could just speak
[36:26] Miracles and stop the storm and and heal
[36:29] the person that where God he was in the
[36:31] mind of God so when he went to the pool
[36:33] amen he only healed one person he didn't
[36:36] go to the graveyard but in the mind of
[36:38] God and and the Bible says that the
[36:40] bride will have the word and the mind of
[36:42] Christ and know what he wants done with
[36:44] it
[36:45] amen
[36:47] and if we were living in the scriptures
[36:49] amen God said Jehovah God said to Moses
[36:52] he said what are you crying about
[36:55] just speak it
[36:56] just speak it and go far away
[36:59] now watch this what the prophet said if
[37:03] if this
[37:05] if if something comes forward believe me
[37:08] I struggled with it before you amen But
[37:10] First Corinthians 10 13 says that that
[37:14] there has no temptation taking thee but
[37:17] such as is common to men but this is
[37:19] where we want to start out but God is
[37:22] faithful
[37:23] I don't think we heard that
[37:25] but God is faithful who will not
[37:30] suffer you
[37:31] to be tempted above that which you are
[37:34] able
[37:36] by God
[37:38] but the god that you came out of
[37:42] that the god that cares about you that
[37:44] the god that you're a part of
[37:46] he's faithful
[37:48] don't matter it does but if you're not
[37:51] faithful but he is
[37:52] amen and he will give you more than you
[37:54] can bear but will with the temptation
[37:57] but will with the Temptation also make
[38:02] but also make you want something in your
[38:05] life you need you need something in your
[38:07] life but he also with the Temptation the
[38:10] temptation of sickness the temptation of
[38:13] not having to pay your bills the
[38:14] temptation of not being able to go to
[38:16] God all the time or the dentation or
[38:19] whatever's in your life not being
[38:20] married or being married to a
[38:22] knucklehead or the to Jason he will make
[38:26] this is God's word by the way amen but
[38:29] he God that's faithful will make a way
[38:32] of Escape
[38:34] but we don't believe that
[38:36] we don't live like that we don't live
[38:38] like a conquering life we say well we're
[38:40] going to help God
[38:42] help God how are you going to help God
[38:45] you you think God needs your help God
[38:47] wants one thing from you worship worship
[38:51] worship worship worship and obedience
[38:55] amen obedience is better than sacrifice
[38:58] but worship and obedience actually you
[39:02] can't even worship God properly unless
[39:04] first you're obedient
[39:06] but if you're obedient you're one of
[39:08] Christ then you can worship God but this
[39:11] same God that's faithful will make a way
[39:14] of Escape so we're like
[39:21] really
[39:24] you know when we I'm already fishing in
[39:26] brother Abraham's Pond you know he said
[39:28] something he said if Jesus Christ in the
[39:30] flesh Jehovah God
[39:32] in the flesh
[39:35] and that and literally the pillar fire
[39:38] and the cloud were both walking with
[39:39] them in the Elohim and and you could cut
[39:42] the air with a knife because The
[39:43] Presence of Jehovah God was in this
[39:45] place
[39:48] he couldn't do once back more for you
[39:52] not once back you don't believe that I
[39:54] know you don't he couldn't do one Speck
[39:57] for you more
[39:59] than he is already done
[40:01] he's already done you're gonna do one
[40:03] more space he said well you want to be
[40:05] saved well I already saved you I already
[40:08] paid Daytona you want the baptism my
[40:10] Lord God but I already paid the
[40:12] atonement for that you want your healing
[40:13] by your stripes you're healed that
[40:14] that's that's a past tense I've already
[40:17] glorified you that's the pie I said but
[40:19] I'm waiting for my husband he already
[40:21] gave you their husband amen if you ain't
[40:23] got a husband in the flesh you've got
[40:24] the Holy Ghost who's your husband amen
[40:26] but I'm waiting for my my uh my husband
[40:29] Dale to to line up well he's already
[40:32] done that but it's
[40:36] there's not one more thing he could do
[40:37] not one more thing actually if you want
[40:40] and I'm jumping way ahead the prophet
[40:41] said if you wanted him to do something
[40:43] for you there's one thing he could do
[40:46] just one thing Jesus Christ Jehovah God
[40:49] there's just one thing he can do for you
[40:51] today
[40:53] and that's preach the word
[40:55] well
[40:56] he can preach the word
[40:59] you preach the word and you'd look like
[41:01] a meal looking at a new gate like
[41:05] who you brings away but he couldn't he
[41:08] couldn't fulfill your word because it's
[41:10] already fulfilled
[41:11] your family is already saved if you've
[41:15] claimed them they're the heritage of
[41:16] your family they're already saved you
[41:18] said but I don't see it God
[41:21] say brother Dale's already Perfection he
[41:23] said I definitely don't see that but he
[41:24] does because in Romans 8 he says already
[41:26] already glorified
[41:28] but he's enough I know but in God's eyes
[41:34] but God who's faithful
[41:37] but the god who's faithful will make a
[41:39] way of Escape that you may be able to
[41:42] Bear it now here comes the bombshell
[41:46] and I said bombshell
[41:50] believe me I got it this week
[41:54] you take that scripture right there
[41:56] and you take birth control
[42:03] Prophet said it
[42:05] zillions of times do you want to tell
[42:08] you something in Google it had the 10
[42:10] weirdest families in North America I
[42:12] shared this I think with brother Matt
[42:15] um the 10 weirdest families in North
[42:17] America what was the ninth weirdest
[42:19] Family in North America
[42:21] I love it
[42:23] I mean that really blessed my heart
[42:26] you know they have I don't even know
[42:27] about Watson all but you know there was
[42:29] some weird things you know but the ninth
[42:31] weirdest see the Bible says that where
[42:33] you'll be peculiar if you're not
[42:35] peculiar you're in Dangerous Ground
[42:37] if you don't look a bit weird if when
[42:39] your wife stands up and you walk out of
[42:41] the restaurant and all the heads don't
[42:42] turn well then you're you're in
[42:44] Dangerous Grounds
[42:47] right
[42:48] because you're supposed to be a light
[42:50] you're supposed to be peculiar and
[42:52] they're supposed to go
[42:57] what's that
[43:01] hey man so the ninth we're just like
[43:04] this was for Google well it's a family
[43:06] that never used birth control
[43:08] they believe that God wouldn't give them
[43:10] more than they could bear
[43:11] they had 19 children
[43:14] you know use I know what you're thinking
[43:15] right now and you can just bypass that
[43:17] thought you know I remember zillions of
[43:20] people I could name them by name my wife
[43:22] definitely does that when we had Vicky
[43:24] they said you got a Millionaire's family
[43:25] to stop right there boy and a girl
[43:28] which one of you kids would like to go
[43:29] back
[43:34] you know John dank well Benjamin was a
[43:36] complete opposite he was a mistake
[43:38] that's disgusting my wife was a mistake
[43:41] can you imagine god making a mistake my
[43:44] rib wasn't here yet
[43:48] oh well I think a lot of you kids would
[43:52] have trouble coming if your wife if your
[43:54] mom hadn't been a mistake
[43:57] you see
[43:58] sometimes God makes mistakes
[44:02] in our eyes
[44:03] oh they weren't his mistakes
[44:06] and our eyes they were our mistakes
[44:08] because nowadays the prophet said he
[44:10] said now people and kids and families
[44:13] are a embarrassment disgrace disgusting
[44:18] because you want to live a Hollywood
[44:21] lifestyle
[44:22] I wonder if all these things that we do
[44:25] in the church and I'm preaching to
[44:26] brother Dale too are you
[44:29] we
[44:30] found in a movie or something somewhere
[44:36] see they don't have too many kids in
[44:37] Hollywood because then they couldn't be
[44:38] in the Showbiz yeah
[44:41] showbiz
[44:43] well that sound good
[44:45] you know I have a hard time being a
[44:47] sister lawyer and have 19 kids
[44:52] yep and you know I know three sisters in
[44:56] churches in Ontario that are all lawyers
[45:00] I wonder if we're watching too much
[45:01] Hollywood
[45:05] you can fill in that blank it's yes
[45:08] in case you were wondered yeah the right
[45:11] answer is yes
[45:12] let's go to Psalms 37 23 and 24.
[45:15] because see now now now like the only
[45:18] thing you got to clarify here is if
[45:20] you're a believer
[45:21] and if this is the Bible
[45:24] that's all you got to clarify
[45:27] because you know I studied a little bit
[45:29] I didn't go to school along I was
[45:31] basically in school but I
[45:33] learned a lot more preaching God's word
[45:35] than I learned in 12 years of school
[45:37] and I have never found birth control in
[45:39] the Bible
[45:41] not nope I mean you can your family is
[45:45] stubborn but I'm just telling you what
[45:47] the Bible says
[45:48] what the prophet said
[45:52] 23 first
[45:54] and the steps of a good man are ordered
[45:57] of the Lord and he delighteth in his
[45:59] ways
[46:01] but now if you're helping God
[46:04] to get your Delight
[46:08] maybe it's you ordering your steps
[46:15] or 24 though he would fall he shall not
[46:21] utterly be cast down for God will
[46:24] withhold him with his hand
[46:27] amen
[46:29] amen see and what this is on just just
[46:32] jump ahead you know because
[46:35] we're human
[46:37] it's the only excuse we can come up with
[46:39] we're Believers but we're human
[46:43] and we struggle to believe
[46:46] that's why we don't believe our healing
[46:49] like we believe God could save us
[46:51] brother Matt but no he couldn't hurt my
[46:53] he couldn't save my my knee because
[46:55] that's harder
[47:00] that's harder
[47:02] like he could save your soul and that's
[47:04] Supernatural but your knee I'll live
[47:06] with it live with it
[47:09] that's not God's desire I know the
[47:12] thoughts I had for you before I made
[47:14] Elohim and there were thoughts of
[47:16] prosper and good health and a family in
[47:19] heaven and
[47:21] and all that were numbered in his hand
[47:23] do you realize that and I don't know
[47:26] where this is coming from do you realize
[47:28] what you think you're doing in your
[47:30] union as marriage and helping God or
[47:33] hindering God God's trying to bring you
[47:35] a baby and maybe it's in his hand and
[47:37] you're trying to withhold it
[47:40] and God's like
[47:42] they don't stop doing that pretty soon
[47:46] we can't lose them
[47:55] anyway back to the
[47:57] number one they were the weirdest
[48:00] night's weirdest family because they
[48:01] didn't use birth control in the head 19.
[48:04] you hanging on to your seats
[48:06] number two
[48:08] when their children were in a
[48:10] relationship
[48:11] they didn't date
[48:13] like random dating
[48:16] they did this thing they called like
[48:18] Google because see they're not used to
[48:19] like the Bible and stuff Google it's not
[48:21] really up to date on all the god stuff
[48:23] you know it used this thing called
[48:25] courting
[48:28] courting not dating because dating you
[48:31] just you know you know what you do but
[48:33] but they use this thing called corking
[48:35] and it's weird
[48:37] because you're never together alone
[48:40] and they said you have virtually no
[48:43] physical contact until the vows
[48:46] now that is extremely weird
[48:51] I mean hey wait a minute this made the
[48:53] ninth weirdest Family in the United
[48:55] States in Google
[48:58] now I'm going to tell you something else
[49:00] there was some final stuff on it
[49:03] but we're living in a world
[49:06] that the word of God
[49:08] is considered so far
[49:15] it shouldn't be that way
[49:17] I'm trying to think of whatever else
[49:19] that was the main thing
[49:21] yeah
[49:23] the Corky
[49:25] and they actually had
[49:27] minimal to no
[49:30] physical contact
[49:33] until marriage
[49:35] in the world's like
[49:36] that's weird
[49:39] song with God's Bible says
[49:41] God help us you know see we got to be we
[49:44] got to get comfortable living in a weird
[49:46] place
[49:47] because you know Sister Ruth said some
[49:49] powerful things from where God said it's
[49:51] going to get weirder
[49:53] it's going to get weirder you know I
[49:56] cited a message Church
[49:58] with Brothers
[50:01] and me and Danny Funk went over inside
[50:03] his house later
[50:06] and that church now has a warehouse door
[50:08] in the end
[50:10] and they sold the message pews over
[50:12] there
[50:12] I sat in that church with the presence
[50:14] of God there the pulpit's been burned or
[50:17] whatever and the bathroom's knocked out
[50:20] and they're parked in wagons
[50:30] when I heard that
[50:32] I had trouble sleeping the next night
[50:36] I literally had trouble sleep
[50:43] be careful how far Satan will take you
[50:47] he might take you farther
[50:50] than what you desire
[50:53] because when you leave the word of God
[50:56] you're a dangerous slow
[50:58] now when the snowball starts going down
[51:00] the slope it's really tiny that Satan
[51:02] starts rolling but when it picks up
[51:05] speeding gets bigger
[51:08] it would take an atomic miracle
[51:11] to slow it down
[51:20] wow
[51:25] you know motherhood
[51:27] and our Prophet said this and it made me
[51:30] feel really a lot better after that
[51:34] is a perfect type
[51:36] of Christian matter of fact Let Me Maybe
[51:38] I should tell you my table motherhood
[51:40] is our spiritual life
[51:47] motherhood
[51:50] is our spiritual life it's almost
[51:53] you know when the prophet gave types
[51:55] like Joseph Joseph in the Bible and all
[51:58] that they're almost a perfect type of
[52:01] Jesus but not quite
[52:02] see he asked his dad to lie
[52:05] like just barely said you know be a
[52:08] farmer instead of a Shepherd because it
[52:10] was an insult to be a shepherding
[52:13] Egypt
[52:16] well I didn't lie
[52:24] but motherhood
[52:27] other than maybe one little tiny thing
[52:31] is a perfect type of your spiritual life
[52:35] I'll tell you which part is not the
[52:38] perfect type
[52:39] mothers get blamed for everything
[52:42] that's the only part that's not a part
[52:44] of your spiritual life
[52:46] it is I know Brothers this is not your
[52:49] day
[52:50] I understand perfectly
[52:52] but if you're a mother this morning
[52:56] let's
[52:58] brother Maggie you're a lot better than
[53:00] the slang staffs but
[53:02] generally speaking you've been blamed
[53:05] because there's no money in the bank
[53:07] you've been blamed because cooked
[53:10] and the clothes aren't washed and she
[53:12] didn't iron the right shirt
[53:14] and she knew what you were thinking
[53:15] ahead of time
[53:17] your shoes aren't shined you can't find
[53:20] your checkbook
[53:21] or you know what I mean that's the only
[53:25] comparison the same as your spiritual
[53:27] walk
[53:28] because Jehovah God never one time
[53:32] not one time now we can do better
[53:34] Brothers not one dying is Jehovah God
[53:37] accused his bride not one day
[53:41] not one time
[53:44] but let's go into all the things that
[53:46] she types and if I get to the quote this
[53:48] morning which I pray I do well two and a
[53:51] half hours I'm sure to get a lot covered
[53:52] I mean that's a Wednesday night so I get
[53:54] three and a half today like
[53:57] amen they
[53:58] but everything else in motherhood
[54:01] is your spiritual walk in life
[54:04] to a T
[54:06] you're not a mother this morning
[54:08] unless you surrendered your will
[54:12] you're not a Christian this morning and
[54:13] a Believer unless you surrender your
[54:15] will you're not a mother this morning
[54:18] unless you put everything ahead of your
[54:20] own life
[54:21] flash included you're not a Believer
[54:24] this morning unless you put your flesh
[54:26] it's night
[54:28] and put everything ahead of this flesh
[54:31] but I was like what
[54:38] and when you're a mother you brought
[54:40] forth new life and if you're a Believer
[54:42] you brought forth New Life
[54:44] there is nothing
[54:47] other than being wrongfully accused
[54:51] that ain't a perfect type
[54:53] to your spiritual walk and life in
[54:56] Christ
[54:57] and God showed us the parallel perfectly
[55:01] in motherhood
[55:05] he's an awesome God
[55:07] and we can look at mothers I mean look
[55:10] at look at when the angel came to John
[55:12] the Baptist mother and father
[55:15] and the father was a knucklehead
[55:18] I mean let's just say it the way it was
[55:20] he didn't believe him
[55:22] and we ain't moved far from that state
[55:24] Brothers
[55:27] but
[55:30] don't you need my help God
[55:34] but I was gonna
[55:36] hey
[55:37] Sarah thought Hagar
[55:41] I'll help you
[55:43] maybe there's a doctor or a pill I can
[55:45] buy
[55:48] maybe I'll get counseling
[55:52] maybe I'll go to theology
[56:01] you know what God
[56:02] the angel
[56:04] God through the angel told John the
[56:06] Baptist Daddy
[56:08] he said you're going to be spiritually
[56:09] blind
[56:12] until you start listening to me
[56:16] that's about where brother Dale's been
[56:17] most of his life
[56:23] brother Dale's starting to get sick of
[56:24] being there
[56:27] you know I I did something weeks and
[56:30] weeks ago
[56:31] and this is the only mistake my wife
[56:33] ever made
[56:34] in 40 years I said honey
[56:36] do this
[56:38] and buy it
[56:41] and she acted like the men that time she
[56:43] said but
[56:44] uh but uh
[56:49] and then she had to go to Michigan
[56:51] and listen to brother Abraham American
[56:53] uh
[56:54] Uganda pastor and the first thing she
[56:56] said when she got in the vehicle she
[56:58] said I should have listened to you
[57:01] did what you said
[57:04] you know when Joshua took the people who
[57:07] and the Cross Jordan it was in the
[57:08] springtime brother Matt and it was flood
[57:11] and God said go ahead and cross God
[57:12] don't make things simple
[57:14] meh
[57:16] and that water was slipping right on
[57:17] their toes and it says
[57:19] and the deacons were really scared
[57:20] because they hadn't prayed through like
[57:22] the pastor Joshua had
[57:24] and it was the deacons that stepped in
[57:26] first
[57:28] and the water would have been right at
[57:30] their knee the first step
[57:32] and it just went
[57:35] how's the river go whoop
[57:39] if that's a beaver
[57:41] God made the Beavers
[57:48] but we say well we'll wait till the
[57:50] drought comes
[57:52] oh oh you waited long enough it's a
[57:54] drought
[57:55] just go to Michigan if you don't think
[57:57] so and go in the store
[57:58] and we went somewhere and our weight
[58:00] just came up and the tree was very nice
[58:03] I know very good she had things in her
[58:06] skin that
[58:07] would have hurt my skin I mean they were
[58:12] and and
[58:14] like I mean when you when I when you
[58:16] know if I if I've got horns on the cow
[58:18] and I'd burn the horn so it won't bleed
[58:19] I mean that would hurt me but like it
[58:21] don't hurt people in Michigan
[58:23] I mean that's special flesh because like
[58:26] when when you have I'm serious Brother
[58:29] Matt when you like when you friend
[58:31] yourself I mean all the kind of I did
[58:33] they jumped
[58:36] I mean
[58:37] yeah
[58:40] I'm not going to that shop
[58:42] I'm not going to the shop to get a
[58:44] tattoo
[58:45] no I'm fine just like I am I never did
[58:48] like needles
[58:49] I actually passed out when they me
[58:52] and you're gonna go
[58:54] no no no no no no no
[58:59] you know
[59:01] the problem I couldn't find one of the
[59:02] quotes that said but you know God's
[59:04] getting fed up with us not taking him
[59:06] out his word
[59:08] you know he's getting that's just flat
[59:10] up the way it is
[59:11] you know watch this Brothers you know if
[59:14] you told your wife to go buy groceries
[59:16] number one you probably wouldn't have to
[59:17] tell her but if you did
[59:19] and and you come home there was nothing
[59:21] in the house this is spiritually and
[59:23] there was nothing in the house she said
[59:24] well I didn't go buy groceries she said
[59:25] I was afraid there was no money
[59:28] but you said but I told you to buy it
[59:31] yeah but I was a feared
[59:34] I was a theater
[59:37] I just flipped that right over to God
[59:40] God said
[59:42] God told Moses Moses was God to pharaoh
[59:46] and Pharaoh ran into some rough road it
[59:49] was a Uganda road and it was getting
[59:51] kind of rough and the people were going
[59:52] to Stone him
[59:54] no no no I tell you what if you were
[59:57] throwing stones at me that's one thing
[59:58] but eggs is bad enough
[1:00:02] and most oh my God oh God
[1:00:06] he said just
[1:00:10] are you afraid you're going to speak the
[1:00:11] wrong thing I don't believe you are
[1:00:14] but you don't believe enough to believe
[1:00:16] God will back it up
[1:00:21] you think it's got to be a prophet or
[1:00:23] something and there ain't nothing wrong
[1:00:24] with Prophets
[1:00:26] but they just believed
[1:00:28] and I believe in my heart that there
[1:00:31] will be more in this age than just Brown
[1:00:33] that makes it
[1:00:35] that means there's got to be another
[1:00:36] some people that are actually believing
[1:00:40] and if you're believing then you better
[1:00:42] start speaking it
[1:00:47] hello
[1:00:48] why what's how this you know what
[1:00:51] motherhood surrenders to God's seed you
[1:00:53] know and she denies all her rights and
[1:00:55] her desires you know a mother could be
[1:00:57] sleeping in bed and everybody's the
[1:00:58] middle of the night three o'clock and
[1:01:00] the babies in three rooms down
[1:01:03] and like it's like a supernatural
[1:01:07] ability the baby
[1:01:09] like you would need radar Quality Air
[1:01:12] complaints and something that baby just
[1:01:15] oh
[1:01:21] they're like oh
[1:01:28] how'd you still get us for a spiritual
[1:01:30] watch if God just you know
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:39] should denies all her right and her
[1:01:41] purpose for Father God
[1:01:48] and everything comes ahead of mother
[1:01:52] mother sleeps less mother eats less
[1:01:57] mother does everything last
[1:02:01] she gets nice things last everything is
[1:02:04] less
[1:02:05] you have a nicer Barn then you have a
[1:02:07] house you have a nicer tractor then you
[1:02:10] have a car
[1:02:11] you have a nicer suit than your wife has
[1:02:13] a dress
[1:02:14] everything's last for mother
[1:02:23] and God showed us that's how it should
[1:02:25] be
[1:02:26] for our flesh
[1:02:28] to serve him
[1:02:32] but we're not willing to go there in
[1:02:34] Matthew 16 24 said then Jesus said unto
[1:02:37] his disciples If any man will come after
[1:02:39] me and will deny himself and take up his
[1:02:42] cross and follow me
[1:02:44] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:02:47] lose it
[1:02:48] and whosoever shall lose his for my sake
[1:02:53] we'll find it
[1:02:55] that same scripture is also recorded in
[1:02:57] Luke 9 23-24
[1:03:01] we're doing a lot of saving of our flesh
[1:03:04] but not too much
[1:03:06] a following
[1:03:11] because
[1:03:13] it's it's just like this it's just it's
[1:03:15] very very very very simple if you
[1:03:17] believe
[1:03:19] then you're not afraid
[1:03:21] and if you believe
[1:03:22] you will step out
[1:03:25] so we actually in Reverse math you know
[1:03:28] I was really good at math if you checked
[1:03:30] your answer then that actually means if
[1:03:32] you don't step out
[1:03:33] just say I'm Healed
[1:03:36] I have that family I have my husband
[1:03:38] period
[1:03:40] I I he's he's just right here I I tug
[1:03:44] him every night before I go to bed
[1:03:47] I know you think I'm nuts but what about
[1:03:50] the people that were getting their uh
[1:03:52] saying they were blind and the prophet
[1:03:54] prayed for him
[1:03:55] in fact and they were sitting in the
[1:03:56] barber chair
[1:03:58] and the barber was making fun of them oh
[1:04:00] oh that's what it is you don't want to
[1:04:02] be made fun of
[1:04:07] so you know the minister and and I'm
[1:04:09] jumping way all over the place but he
[1:04:11] said you know your flash is going to die
[1:04:16] no matter what
[1:04:18] whether you're going to Rapture or
[1:04:20] whether you just die
[1:04:22] but you're gonna die
[1:04:24] and God through free moral agent gave
[1:04:27] you a choice and and I'm definitely not
[1:04:30] going to preach that message because but
[1:04:31] but this part's good
[1:04:33] so you're gonna die
[1:04:35] so you have the right to die listen to
[1:04:37] this ladies this is good this is really
[1:04:39] good you have the right to die fighting
[1:04:44] or you have the right to die because
[1:04:46] you're afraid to die
[1:04:52] I'm afraid to take God at his word and
[1:04:55] I'm afraid to be called the fool and I'm
[1:04:57] afraid to die so I'm going to die
[1:05:05] and that brother went through the Bible
[1:05:06] and he just showed like a dozen things
[1:05:08] in Bible
[1:05:09] a fools
[1:05:11] people that took God at his work just
[1:05:14] I just
[1:05:19] wow
[1:05:20] you know the prophet said that Abraham
[1:05:22] bought baby clothes
[1:05:24] for waiting 25 years and said his face
[1:05:27] never wavered a bit
[1:05:29] he kept asking Sarah on a regular basis
[1:05:31] you feeling anything different
[1:05:35] because he didn't just believe it he
[1:05:37] just was he talked about it he claimed
[1:05:39] it I'm Healed I don't if feelings have
[1:05:42] nothing to do with this
[1:05:43] Bill's had nothing to do with it it's
[1:05:45] fine to feel nice I like feeling nice
[1:05:47] but just when you believe you just like
[1:05:49] it's here
[1:05:50] your babies are here
[1:05:53] all the babies are here
[1:05:54] even even watch this even when you're
[1:05:57] praying for healing you say Lord I'm
[1:05:59] Healed if if if I enter which I don't
[1:06:01] but if I had something wrong with me and
[1:06:03] I said Lord Heal me and I just I Lord I
[1:06:05] claim a healing and I died in five
[1:06:07] seconds God healed me
[1:06:09] and you're down here crying and I'm up
[1:06:12] there jumping and doing head stamps and
[1:06:14] jumping off of golden trampolines and
[1:06:18] you guys
[1:06:21] because I was the low Goss of God before
[1:06:23] I ever was
[1:06:25] flesh
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:28] Hallelujah is it all right to read some
[1:06:31] quotes behold greater than all of them
[1:06:33] is here a 62 quote mold us and we're
[1:06:36] coming down to the from The Potter's
[1:06:39] House and break us up Lord and mold us
[1:06:41] and make us real Christians and give us
[1:06:43] a new birth and the spirit of God in us
[1:06:46] like the spirit
[1:06:51] of motherhood
[1:06:55] you thought I was coming up with that on
[1:06:58] my own
[1:07:00] here's the prophet saying the spirit of
[1:07:02] motherhood
[1:07:06] and the spirit of God
[1:07:15] make us like the spirit of motherhood
[1:07:17] just like that deer was that was willing
[1:07:19] to die
[1:07:21] because she was a mother now she told
[1:07:23] that story and I'll just tell it fast
[1:07:25] and thing but brother Branham was
[1:07:27] hunting with the meanest man he ever
[1:07:29] knew
[1:07:30] and he he bragged about killing fawns
[1:07:32] and and does and and all this thing and
[1:07:35] and brother Branham they went hunting
[1:07:36] and and he called brother Brown the
[1:07:39] chicken-hearted preacher
[1:07:41] see see people will make fun of you but
[1:07:44] if you have problems with that then they
[1:07:46] call that
[1:07:48] they call that like you you're inferior
[1:07:50] to peer pressure
[1:07:54] you know that's a big thing like in high
[1:07:56] school
[1:07:57] I'll tell you honestly I was never
[1:07:59] affected by you
[1:08:00] not a little bit
[1:08:02] somebody was a very mean in high school
[1:08:03] they got a punch in the nose
[1:08:05] it's just straightforward it was just
[1:08:07] black and white
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:10] but everybody wants to fit you're not
[1:08:13] going to fit in in this world
[1:08:15] you can move to straight Mennonite
[1:08:16] country or where only bears live Jared
[1:08:19] and you ain't gonna fit in
[1:08:22] because this world ain't our home and if
[1:08:24] it is your home
[1:08:25] you're really in trouble
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:32] and brother Brown never prayed for this
[1:08:34] brother he never preached to this
[1:08:35] brother and I got another question why
[1:08:37] would brother Branham even take the
[1:08:39] meanest manhunting
[1:08:42] he never took all the brothers that
[1:08:43] loved them all the ministers all the
[1:08:45] deacons not no he took up he took it
[1:08:54] and they stopped and brother Brown
[1:08:55] thought they were having a lunch and he
[1:08:56] pulled out a fond whistle
[1:08:58] and they were in a Mallow and as soon as
[1:09:01] they blew the whistle a fond deer a doe
[1:09:04] deer jumped up
[1:09:06] and was looking right just just as close
[1:09:09] as just a few yards away because she had
[1:09:14] an instinct of her Bay day
[1:09:17] it was just my baby my baby my baby
[1:09:21] my baby it didn't matter if there was a
[1:09:23] tank coming a atomic bomb it didn't
[1:09:25] matter if it was my body my baby she had
[1:09:28] no brains between her and her it was
[1:09:31] just my baby my baby her brains went to
[1:09:34] Mush poo my baby my baby and she stood
[1:09:37] right up front with her saying don't do
[1:09:39] it there's two Hunters here they got
[1:09:41] guns I can smell them everything she
[1:09:43] knew what was complete Insanity
[1:09:46] my body my baby
[1:09:49] and she said just shoot me do anything
[1:09:51] you want but my baby my baby my baby
[1:09:53] needs me
[1:09:56] but you won't serve Christ like that
[1:10:01] I don't normally
[1:10:04] well if it's dangerous
[1:10:07] look the government said we should
[1:10:12] don't get on that subject
[1:10:15] you know in the Bible the government
[1:10:17] told the disciples not to preach in
[1:10:19] Jesus name and got beat do you know
[1:10:21] Moses against the law Moses wife against
[1:10:24] the law hid Moses hid Moses mom goes mom
[1:10:28] there's the mom again hid Moses against
[1:10:30] the law against Allah she broke the law
[1:10:33] because he was actually born a boy
[1:10:35] believe it or not
[1:10:36] and like you know we can just go on and
[1:10:39] go on and go on like Daniel broke the
[1:10:42] law broke the law and Daniel didn't even
[1:10:46] have to break the law
[1:10:47] because Daniel could have still lived
[1:10:49] but he wouldn't even curb the law
[1:10:52] because even the prophet said that that
[1:10:56] Samuel the prophet Samuel's mom when she
[1:10:58] cried and cried for a baby she probably
[1:11:00] she prayed in her heart and her lips
[1:11:04] never moved
[1:11:08] now that's that's that's in the actual
[1:11:11] the Bible
[1:11:12] so how come Daniel when the government
[1:11:13] changed the law I said well I can pray
[1:11:15] and I want
[1:11:19] Believers that will never come to a
[1:11:21] prayer meeting they would just stay at
[1:11:22] home because well I can pray on the
[1:11:25] couch and I won't move my lips
[1:11:29] better yet this would fit more Believers
[1:11:31] forget that I won't even pray at all
[1:11:35] I'll turn
[1:11:41] uh-huh Prophet said that prayer was
[1:11:44] powerful than any atomic bomb ever you
[1:11:46] just say God you said in your word here
[1:11:48] this is mine I take it I accept it over
[1:11:51] you don't have to be really big
[1:11:55] you can think of the the woman where
[1:11:56] where they're brought the plane down in
[1:11:58] the States you know and she was praying
[1:12:00] and and you know she was converted by
[1:12:03] the way
[1:12:04] yep she was she was actually a believer
[1:12:07] because she prayed for her baby that had
[1:12:10] a disease from sexual living
[1:12:13] like AIDS
[1:12:15] yeah
[1:12:16] now that's pretty bad brother Matt
[1:12:18] yep and he was dying dying was crying to
[1:12:22] his mom he said Mommy it's getting
[1:12:24] darker and darker and darker and darker
[1:12:27] in here and she said to God she said God
[1:12:31] you gave me this baby and I'm like the
[1:12:34] cinema woman and you didn't give me this
[1:12:38] baby to die when it's getting darker and
[1:12:41] darker and darker and I will not I will
[1:12:45] not I refuse God now she's preaching to
[1:12:48] God hallelujah see you forgot she was
[1:12:52] the logos of God and she said God I'm a
[1:12:55] part of the logos and I'm going to tell
[1:12:57] you a couple things I will not I refuse
[1:13:00] to saith the Lord and she was the logos
[1:13:04] of a woman she said I will not back up
[1:13:08] and God talked to a Jet Airlines through
[1:13:12] all the media and those controlled
[1:13:14] traffickers and said there's a storm up
[1:13:17] and there's there's oil leaking in your
[1:13:19] engine and brought down a chat with 300
[1:13:21] people in it
[1:13:27] and the prophet said well it's a Monday
[1:13:29] night sunny day out today
[1:13:30] I think I'll go check out the trees
[1:13:35] if he was checking out the trees
[1:13:37] God said keep on going
[1:13:41] he said something that we should never
[1:13:43] we should take it out of our language
[1:13:45] he said
[1:13:48] but
[1:13:52] but
[1:13:54] God hates Bob
[1:13:56] the devil loves bud
[1:13:59] the devil and butt are in the same sense
[1:14:03] but
[1:14:06] the prophet just for a split second had
[1:14:09] spiritual amnesia
[1:14:13] and then he said okay
[1:14:16] that's about how long it lasts with
[1:14:18] brother Dale it lasts about 35 years
[1:14:21] God help me
[1:14:23] I'm gonna have to live old
[1:14:25] tell you what
[1:14:27] he's okay
[1:14:28] and he's walking along
[1:14:30] and this is a mother
[1:14:33] a mother that raised a no-good son
[1:14:40] the world it was her fault
[1:14:43] and she's standing out there
[1:14:47] and brother Brown looked a million miles
[1:14:49] from a preacher
[1:14:50] he had bib overhauls on and probably a
[1:14:53] raccoon hat and I'm making this up but
[1:14:56] he wasn't dressed for preaching brother
[1:14:58] not
[1:14:59] and he's just thrown along checking up
[1:15:01] trees
[1:15:04] and he said come on Amanda good morning
[1:15:07] and she said good morning parser and she
[1:15:11] said hey excuse me
[1:15:15] he didn't wear his name tag on the
[1:15:18] poster of William
[1:15:20] he didn't wear a name take on the
[1:15:22] prophet to leave receiving Church each
[1:15:24] and I want everybody in the tune to know
[1:15:28] he said excuse me
[1:15:31] he said how'd you know I was a pastor
[1:15:33] that means he didn't look like a pastor
[1:15:34] brother Mike
[1:15:36] he said how'd you know I was person
[1:15:39] woman
[1:15:42] and she said you know I was praying the
[1:15:44] other night
[1:15:45] that's something us Believers don't do
[1:15:47] very much so I was praying the other
[1:15:50] night that's something the guy said from
[1:15:52] Uganda Abraham he said you know if we'd
[1:15:53] pray once in a while maybe God would
[1:15:55] answer so I was praying the other night
[1:15:57] I was praying and I was telling God God
[1:16:01] I ain't giving you my son when he's
[1:16:03] getting darker
[1:16:05] you don't have a choice
[1:16:08] I know you were shocked I said that
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:11] God didn't
[1:16:14] oh you said Dale how could you say
[1:16:18] he said it's called something called we
[1:16:20] called the Bible
[1:16:22] it's actually called the word of God
[1:16:24] brother Matt and in first John 1 it says
[1:16:27] and the Word was with God and the word
[1:16:31] oh and the word
[1:16:35] and the Word was God
[1:16:37] and she was a logos of God and she said
[1:16:41] God you gotta line up to your word
[1:16:47] and God pulled out his Bible in heaven
[1:16:53] and said John 1.
[1:16:58] he didn't have to pull it out
[1:17:00] he just went in his computer
[1:17:04] and he said thank you madam
[1:17:07] thank you mother
[1:17:09] he said
[1:17:10] so
[1:17:12] madam
[1:17:14] the prophet said that she had a dream
[1:17:17] so she was praying that she fell asleep
[1:17:19] she prayed so long
[1:17:22] we definitely don't do that
[1:17:24] because we'd go to bed
[1:17:26] praying and he fell asleep
[1:17:29] and he gave her a dream and he said you
[1:17:30] know
[1:17:31] I'll send you by a pastor tomorrow
[1:17:34] papyrus
[1:17:38] and I want to tell you something this
[1:17:39] morning
[1:17:40] it was just a dream brother night
[1:17:43] she physically seen what brother Brown
[1:17:45] looked like
[1:17:48] now if you don't think that's an awesome
[1:17:50] God I'd say that's a pretty good dream
[1:17:57] and the kind of closing the shirt he was
[1:18:02] it wasn't just some random like fly and
[1:18:04] then I garbage
[1:18:06] no God was identified perfectly that's
[1:18:09] exactly what he'll look like sister
[1:18:11] Patty
[1:18:13] oh that that's the kind of God I'm I'm
[1:18:17] interested
[1:18:19] wow
[1:18:22] and he walked in her house he said she
[1:18:25] told him he said I have a son
[1:18:27] and he's died
[1:18:32] she didn't hide
[1:18:34] told him what it was
[1:18:37] come in and pray for him
[1:18:40] and the prophet said he said I've
[1:18:42] stepped in 20 million dollar houses
[1:18:46] he said I had no idea when I stepped in
[1:18:48] that house
[1:18:49] the token was on the door
[1:18:52] the president's got he said the first
[1:18:54] thing I've seen is is uh for me and my
[1:18:57] house to serve the Lord
[1:18:59] right here there was testimonies
[1:19:01] everywhere
[1:19:02] where he went and he said so she wanted
[1:19:05] him to pray and she said madam
[1:19:08] Mama madam
[1:19:10] why don't you pray first
[1:19:16] anybody read that lately
[1:19:18] that's a good story to read on Mother's
[1:19:20] Day
[1:19:23] and our prophet
[1:19:24] was a man of Prayer
[1:19:30] he said when she started praying
[1:19:33] he didn't say she had great words
[1:19:38] he didn't say that he didn't say she was
[1:19:40] educated
[1:19:42] he didn't say she knew all the right
[1:19:44] message lingle brother Matt
[1:19:46] he said but I knew it instantly
[1:19:49] that she knew the boss
[1:19:53] I knew instantly he said
[1:19:56] God
[1:19:58] my son's here
[1:20:01] and you're going to save them
[1:20:03] period
[1:20:05] and I'm expecting it today
[1:20:10] today
[1:20:12] not tomorrow not maybe not if you feel
[1:20:15] like it no she started giving God orders
[1:20:23] and then the prophet prayed
[1:20:27] and he said Mama
[1:20:29] it's getting a lot lighter in here
[1:20:32] it's getting a lot lot lighter in here I
[1:20:35] can see a lot better in here it's
[1:20:37] getting a lot lot lighter you know years
[1:20:39] later the prophet went somewhere and was
[1:20:41] into the area or something and the man
[1:20:43] came up to him he said you know person
[1:20:45] he said remember you came in that little
[1:20:46] old house
[1:20:50] see she was a believer
[1:20:53] she was a Believer and so God actually
[1:20:55] showed her
[1:20:58] I said God
[1:20:59] I want to be a part of that
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:06] and the message 63 and this is the sign
[1:21:09] of this he said the reason
[1:21:11] that the deer could display the
[1:21:13] motherhood that gallantly is because she
[1:21:16] was
[1:21:18] just a mother
[1:21:20] she didn't have to think about it
[1:21:23] she didn't have to premeditate it she
[1:21:24] didn't have to go to cemetery or
[1:21:26] university
[1:21:27] she was just a mother
[1:21:29] and her nature I wonder if this site was
[1:21:33] a mother
[1:21:34] now if you happen to be a believer
[1:21:37] you won't have to think about being a
[1:21:38] Believer and your nature
[1:21:41] will just be I believe
[1:21:44] there's no man I just I believe it's
[1:21:46] just really straightforward
[1:21:51] God make that's what the prophet said
[1:21:53] and in the message it put it all capital
[1:21:55] letters he said God make us Christians
[1:21:59] our nature
[1:22:02] Christians God make our God make Dale's
[1:22:05] nature a believer a Christian Lord and
[1:22:10] just something put it in there but make
[1:22:12] me a Christian at heart
[1:22:15] and that and represent
[1:22:19] that has respects to the the
[1:22:22] and sorry
[1:22:25] that's represented to the world to
[1:22:27] display Christianity and The Godly love
[1:22:30] like that old deer
[1:22:32] dead in motherhood
[1:22:36] you know what if you're a Believer
[1:22:38] you'll just walk right up you just you
[1:22:39] just walk right in front of semis
[1:22:40] brother Matt because if you're a
[1:22:42] believer
[1:22:44] I don't mean
[1:22:47] if God's
[1:22:48] I'm not saying be Reckless
[1:22:50] when you come to stop sign you still
[1:22:52] look both ways
[1:22:54] but you see what I mean
[1:22:57] I don't have to tell you to look both
[1:22:59] ways
[1:23:04] because we're too over cautious
[1:23:07] our nature
[1:23:08] is not belief
[1:23:11] hey man I'm trying to push you the other
[1:23:14] way
[1:23:15] God's trying to push you the other way
[1:23:18] this world is falling apart in 63 he
[1:23:21] said the backbone of a Nation
[1:23:27] is motherhood
[1:23:29] and you and you break motherhood and
[1:23:32] you've broken the nation right there now
[1:23:34] lots of religious theologians would say
[1:23:37] the backbone of the nation's God
[1:23:42] see it's a perfect time
[1:23:46] man it is God but God's in motherhood
[1:23:49] amen
[1:23:51] and that's the one thing that holds
[1:23:53] everything together is God in motherhood
[1:23:56] real genuine
[1:23:58] motherhood
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] Hallelujah
[1:24:04] amen are you scared to read some quotes
[1:24:05] here and I got to find a pair of glasses
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:11] 64.
[1:24:13] and he was to pass this way he said in
[1:24:16] genuine loyal loyal mother standing here
[1:24:18] he said she wasn't hypocritical and she
[1:24:21] was she she wasn't just putting that on
[1:24:25] a sideshow she was a mother
[1:24:28] and why is she doing it death didn't
[1:24:30] mean nothing to her her baby was in
[1:24:33] trouble and she thought that her baby
[1:24:37] she thought more of her baby than she
[1:24:38] did her own life let the hunters come
[1:24:41] and take that Royal loyal heart of the
[1:24:43] motherhood it was motherhood in her was
[1:24:46] calling out her baby was crying
[1:24:50] this man that went with the prophet
[1:24:53] the prophet was standing there expecting
[1:24:55] him to kill that little fawn
[1:24:57] I'm sure you know the story
[1:24:59] and and the prophet was praying the Lord
[1:25:02] how can you let him do that and he
[1:25:04] opened his eyes and the gun was
[1:25:06] loading up like that and he threw the
[1:25:08] gun down
[1:25:10] and he said I've had enough of this he
[1:25:12] said show me this Jesus
[1:25:19] man he hadn't preached him a sermon
[1:25:22] he lived in the sermon
[1:25:25] an invisible Union of the Bride he said
[1:25:27] what was that sacred trust what what a
[1:25:30] sacred trust what now think of
[1:25:31] Christianity what does sacred trust
[1:25:34] God's give to the bride of Christ look
[1:25:36] at the Revelation and the the the the
[1:25:39] the revealed word and everything a brand
[1:25:42] new book The Seal's open that God's
[1:25:44] given to you a sacred Trust
[1:25:47] and what a responsibility it is
[1:25:50] to the woman
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:57] and now you see why she's a type
[1:25:59] of the church which was the same
[1:26:02] responsibility as a woman had a sacred
[1:26:05] responsibility to her motherhood
[1:26:10] motherhood has been lost in this day
[1:26:15] the sacred responsibility of motherhood
[1:26:17] to her
[1:26:20] virtues and to her husband the church
[1:26:23] has a sacred responsibility to prayer
[1:26:28] to the word
[1:26:31] and to Christ just the same
[1:26:33] as the woman has
[1:26:36] to her husband
[1:26:39] wow
[1:26:42] God help us amen
[1:26:46] the prophet tells this story
[1:26:48] and I'm just going to do it from
[1:26:50] paraphrase it tells a story about the
[1:26:53] possum
[1:26:55] man you all know the story it was about
[1:26:57] 10 o'clock at night and the possum come
[1:26:59] in dragging its leg come up this thing
[1:27:01] and come up saying they're normally
[1:27:03] scared of humans and it was it was it
[1:27:05] must have been 10 in the morning because
[1:27:06] he said they don't normally travel at
[1:27:08] the daylight
[1:27:10] and I don't know I could read it here
[1:27:12] but it would take me but the possum sat
[1:27:14] there for days and days and people come
[1:27:17] by and said why don't you just take your
[1:27:18] gun and take her and put her up her
[1:27:19] Ministry and see the pouch like a
[1:27:22] kangaroo and all her babies six or seven
[1:27:24] of her babies were in there and her
[1:27:26] power of instinct
[1:27:28] was to live at any cost
[1:27:34] because what was in that poach
[1:27:36] at any cost
[1:27:38] I'm taking care of that pouch she's
[1:27:40] dragging her leg
[1:27:42] she's dragging her leg blokes on the
[1:27:44] sidewalk and he said there was maggots
[1:27:45] now you could physically see maggots and
[1:27:48] he's the prophet was a human being by
[1:27:49] the way and he said I took a rake and
[1:27:52] scraped her off the sidewalk
[1:27:58] maggots
[1:28:00] he really didn't want that at the front
[1:28:01] door
[1:28:05] and he kept thinking she would die and
[1:28:07] they wanted them to kill her and he said
[1:28:08] he said you know you hunt go get one of
[1:28:10] those revolvers and shoot he said he
[1:28:12] said I'm a Hunter but I'm not a murderer
[1:28:14] am I going just laying the gun between
[1:28:16] her
[1:28:18] hey man
[1:28:23] and this is just exactly where you are
[1:28:27] because we haven't came up the profit
[1:28:29] hadn't come up to the fullness
[1:28:32] God had to hit him over the head with
[1:28:33] the
[1:28:37] and he was talking the one morning he
[1:28:39] went out to check her and she was still
[1:28:40] there
[1:28:42] and he was actually hoping she was gone
[1:28:44] or dead
[1:28:47] gone or dead
[1:28:50] some of the people you're praying for
[1:28:52] you hope they die so you can quit for
[1:28:54] him
[1:28:55] because we're not Believers yet
[1:29:02] now God can deliver people by I've
[1:29:04] prayed that if God if you don't see fit
[1:29:06] to heal them then take them home let
[1:29:08] them because I don't want to live here
[1:29:10] like that don't never let me live in a
[1:29:13] state
[1:29:14] we have an agreement with my wife when I
[1:29:16] get like that there's two by four
[1:29:18] and you right there
[1:29:20] yep
[1:29:21] okay
[1:29:24] and God said
[1:29:26] God said to the prophet just like this
[1:29:29] don't don't think God's expecting you
[1:29:33] to be there
[1:29:35] God said
[1:29:38] boy send her to your front door
[1:29:43] you all got something on your front door
[1:29:46] and you wish God would get rid of it for
[1:29:48] you
[1:29:50] he said I sent it to you
[1:29:53] and all you got to do with what's on
[1:29:55] your front door
[1:29:57] did you spend a little time in
[1:29:59] prayer
[1:30:02] just just even a little bit
[1:30:05] the prophet apologizes to God
[1:30:07] and he said God forgive me for being a
[1:30:12] stupid
[1:30:13] prophet
[1:30:15] stupid or he uses a very strong word
[1:30:21] and not recognizing
[1:30:24] what you were doing
[1:30:26] and he don't pray for three hours and
[1:30:28] three days he might preach for three
[1:30:29] hours but he don't pray for three hours
[1:30:30] he said little apostles
[1:30:33] you're a mama
[1:30:34] and you're trying to save your babies
[1:30:37] and he said I give you your life
[1:30:39] and he said just like that she just
[1:30:42] walked down the street yes sir
[1:30:45] and she got to the gate
[1:30:47] she turned around and did a big old
[1:30:50] thank you sir
[1:30:52] to God
[1:31:03] wow
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:09] in 60 and 53 the ministry of Christ he
[1:31:12] said sometimes it awful it happens in a
[1:31:14] something awful had happened in their
[1:31:17] family and they wanted a baby
[1:31:22] John the Baptist
[1:31:24] and he was prophesied
[1:31:26] his mom and dad
[1:31:28] and then them those days it was a
[1:31:30] disgrace not to have a baby
[1:31:33] but nowadays I mean how are you going to
[1:31:35] put on this Jezebel clothing if you are
[1:31:38] have a baby I mean you're just going to
[1:31:40] be disfigured
[1:31:44] but God never ever made
[1:31:46] motherhood
[1:31:47] or Believers or Christians to put on
[1:31:51] that garbage
[1:31:53] amen
[1:31:56] and them days it was a scratch that
[1:31:58] babies now it wasn't
[1:32:03] she wanted a baby let's look at some of
[1:32:06] my quotes here so I don't take them all
[1:32:08] back home
[1:32:09] he said uh
[1:32:13] multiple times he said you're the Fifth
[1:32:15] Gospel
[1:32:16] he said let me
[1:32:18] talked about Moses mom
[1:32:21] Fifth Gospel amen
[1:32:23] so much my goodness
[1:32:27] God is good enough
[1:32:29] anyway just to preach forever
[1:32:32] he said
[1:32:33] he said and it isn't Communists that's
[1:32:36] hurting America he said it's our own
[1:32:39] rottenness among ourselves
[1:32:41] amen you know I want to throw this out
[1:32:43] here just come to me this is fresh he
[1:32:45] said you know
[1:32:46] Samson was called of God
[1:32:50] I got a question for you who killed
[1:32:52] Samson
[1:32:56] thank you sister Patty Samson killed
[1:32:58] them
[1:33:01] he played him long enough
[1:33:04] that Samson killed himself
[1:33:07] and he was a fool
[1:33:09] by the way
[1:33:10] he could have died a fighter
[1:33:13] but he died a fool
[1:33:16] that's what Abraham preached on although
[1:33:18] he didn't use Samson but that's another
[1:33:19] one
[1:33:20] it was Samson
[1:33:22] but we don't want to be sentencing
[1:33:25] amen even though Samson was saved I'm
[1:33:28] not interested in having a dire a life
[1:33:31] history like Samson
[1:33:33] no sir he said it's a rottenness and he
[1:33:35] said to the morals and it's bacon
[1:33:37] breaking the back immorals and all these
[1:33:40] things it's breaking the back of our
[1:33:42] nation he said motherhood is marred
[1:33:46] amen and he was watch this he said
[1:33:49] I'm just reading what I got highlighted
[1:33:51] he said motherhood and the great
[1:33:53] principles like that is broken when
[1:33:56] mothers no
[1:33:58] just listen to what he said I'm just
[1:34:00] going to read this paragraph that's all
[1:34:01] right
[1:34:02] he's a motherhood in the great
[1:34:03] principles like that are broken when
[1:34:05] mothers will pay a hundred dollars for a
[1:34:08] little snotty-nosed dog excuse the
[1:34:10] expression and take it in their house
[1:34:12] with them and give it Mother's Love
[1:34:15] and right around in the automobile and
[1:34:17] practice birth control
[1:34:21] any nation that will sink a stuff is
[1:34:25] that
[1:34:29] and our police force will allow her to
[1:34:31] strip naked in the street and walk down
[1:34:33] and the things and they censor the TV
[1:34:35] cast he said oh bonger
[1:34:38] four or five times
[1:34:40] married women
[1:34:46] education is at the end
[1:34:51] help me out delinquency is at the end
[1:34:55] yeah thank you thank you that's a
[1:34:58] twister
[1:34:59] children there ain't no hope for the
[1:35:01] children they're gone
[1:35:03] insane
[1:35:07] you know I said the other day and I
[1:35:09] praise God we had a wonderful time with
[1:35:11] sister Ruth
[1:35:12] he said if you're a believer
[1:35:15] well I well you homeschool your kids
[1:35:18] that's scriptural
[1:35:20] period
[1:35:21] and that's with an exclamation mark
[1:35:24] you can't have no education
[1:35:28] he said you can't go down to this that
[1:35:30] school and have a kid get with education
[1:35:34] now that is word for word
[1:35:38] because he will be too full more of how
[1:35:42] when he comes out than he will when he
[1:35:45] went in
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:52] and let the teacher say something to him
[1:35:55] just watch this look at that brother
[1:35:57] so you can't have no education you go
[1:35:59] down there to that school and have good
[1:36:01] kid
[1:36:02] be insane oh right here with education
[1:36:05] he'll be two for the children of Hal
[1:36:07] when he comes out
[1:36:12] oh bless God we got message people that
[1:36:14] are lawyers and doctors and praise the
[1:36:16] Lord hallelujah
[1:36:23] practice and birth control
[1:36:27] oh I know that's crazy
[1:36:29] I agree with you I'm right I'm sick
[1:36:31] right beside you
[1:36:34] but this was a believer that spoke yet
[1:36:39] and they do these insane things and
[1:36:41] would would kill you or poison you do
[1:36:43] anything the next your children are
[1:36:46] bearing
[1:36:48] is that the children bearing is at the
[1:36:51] end and motherhood and mother motherhood
[1:36:54] Womanhood and motherhood
[1:36:56] why birth control practice everywhere
[1:36:59] and little doggies have taken their
[1:37:02] place
[1:37:09] now obviously he's talking there about
[1:37:12] women in the child bearing age
[1:37:15] if you have a little doggie in your past
[1:37:17] a child bearing age you've already had
[1:37:19] your children
[1:37:21] but he's talking about having a little
[1:37:22] doggy
[1:37:23] and nothing there changing the diapers
[1:37:25] of the dog you know I never was a big
[1:37:27] fan of changing diapers and I did it
[1:37:30] every time it was absolutely needed but
[1:37:32] it just I just arranged it that it
[1:37:34] wasn't necessary very many times brother
[1:37:36] Matt
[1:37:37] but I get amazed when I drive down the
[1:37:39] road and men and women and old women
[1:37:42] that are too old to come to church
[1:37:43] praise God because they're arthritis and
[1:37:46] Mr Arthur and all that but they'll Bend
[1:37:49] out and scoop up
[1:37:52] well little Rover does
[1:37:54] on the neighbor's lawn
[1:37:57] and I'm like
[1:38:00] foreign
[1:38:06] God
[1:38:07] I'm not going to drown in the diaper
[1:38:09] pail
[1:38:12] do I remember my sister singing that
[1:38:15] when I was eight
[1:38:17] and she was disgusted because she had
[1:38:19] babies
[1:38:23] and that stuck with me
[1:38:25] until my fat gray-haired man
[1:38:29] there's some things that shouldn't come
[1:38:30] out of your mind
[1:38:32] like oh you were a mistake
[1:38:36] we were planning on three and by golly
[1:38:38] we got four
[1:38:44] well I was supposed to be a girl
[1:38:46] I mean the last five were supposed to be
[1:38:48] girls
[1:38:49] sake's alive you don't have seven in a
[1:38:51] row and you're hoping for another
[1:38:54] I mean we all know that go to school for
[1:38:56] that one
[1:39:00] you see
[1:39:02] too much said brother Dale in that
[1:39:05] and too much of you in that see we had a
[1:39:07] plan
[1:39:09] my mom and dad had a plan that I would
[1:39:10] be a girl but God knew a girl couldn't
[1:39:13] preach
[1:39:15] and
[1:39:17] and if if I hadn't they would have knew
[1:39:19] I wasn't a girl I wouldn't have been
[1:39:20] here anyway just like all the ones past
[1:39:22] Vicky wouldn't have been here because
[1:39:24] see as soon as we went past the Vicki we
[1:39:26] became poppers
[1:39:29] because the millionaire family was over
[1:39:33] righteous day
[1:39:36] ain't that crazy some of the things
[1:39:37] people say
[1:39:40] man God help us
[1:39:43] man
[1:39:47] God help us
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:56] motherhood
[1:39:57] perfect type
[1:39:59] of our walk with Christ
[1:40:01] I wonder how much you're surrendering to
[1:40:04] him
[1:40:05] I wonder how much times your mother gets
[1:40:08] up and fixes a baby in the middle of the
[1:40:10] night I wonder how many times God would
[1:40:11] like you to get up in the middle of the
[1:40:13] night fix your spiritual watch
[1:40:16] I just I just wondered
[1:40:19] I just wonder if you ain't got what you
[1:40:21] think you should have spiritually
[1:40:23] if you've been changing many diapers
[1:40:25] spiritually in prayer
[1:40:28] like motherhood
[1:40:38] and man we know what Sam or the
[1:40:41] Prophet said in Proverbs about a
[1:40:43] virtuous woman
[1:40:47] amen it says that this I'm thinking
[1:40:50] completely spiritual here
[1:40:52] it said that she looketh
[1:40:55] she looketh well on her ways of her
[1:40:57] household and she eateth not the bread
[1:41:01] of items
[1:41:04] spiritually
[1:41:06] what have you done for Christ
[1:41:09] is the only thing you will last
[1:41:12] nothing you're doing
[1:41:14] her children rise up and call her
[1:41:16] blessed and her husband also ask her
[1:41:20] where the money is
[1:41:23] That was supposed to be there I know it
[1:41:25] was in there
[1:41:26] oh I just know it was
[1:41:31] and he Praises her
[1:41:33] for spending the money
[1:41:36] amen
[1:41:42] the fruit of her hands let her own work
[1:41:45] praise her
[1:41:46] indicates
[1:41:49] and your spiritual walk the fruit of
[1:41:50] your own hats
[1:41:52] will praise you
[1:41:53] when you get to the gates
[1:41:56] God will never forget
[1:41:59] God help us
[1:42:02] God help us
[1:42:05] I wonder if you could be like God and
[1:42:07] say that you safely trust God could
[1:42:10] safely Trust
[1:42:12] in you
[1:42:13] that you wouldn't do nothing outside of
[1:42:15] his word
[1:42:18] like the heart of her husband safely
[1:42:20] trusts the sinner
[1:42:22] because he knows he she would never step
[1:42:25] out
[1:42:27] of the Covenant
[1:42:30] their Covenant what about God's covenant
[1:42:47] let's close with this Hagar In the Bible
[1:42:50] in first Samuel
[1:42:53] and we'll just go through this fast I
[1:42:54] mean just for uh
[1:42:57] preacher was
[1:43:02] Hager was in the Bible
[1:43:05] am I saying that right hey Hannah I'm
[1:43:08] sorry
[1:43:08] I'm sorry yeah
[1:43:10] had no children
[1:43:12] hey man
[1:43:14] and her husband loved her
[1:43:18] abundantly he had two wives Old
[1:43:20] Testament we don't do that now
[1:43:23] amen
[1:43:28] and he went Year to you know the
[1:43:30] Tabernacle to pray
[1:43:32] and Hannah wept earnestly ate and
[1:43:37] grieved in her heart
[1:43:40] man
[1:43:44] she went to the Tabernacle
[1:43:48] and if there's something in your life
[1:43:49] that you need
[1:43:51] like a little bit more bread in your
[1:43:53] pocketbook
[1:43:54] or a little bit of husband to come and
[1:43:56] work and pay your bills
[1:43:58] as long as he's a believer
[1:44:01] make really good insure
[1:44:04] he believes everything
[1:44:07] it says that she prayed bitterly in her
[1:44:09] soul this is Samuel 1 1 10.
[1:44:13] you prayed unto the Lord and wept saw
[1:44:15] her and she vowed with God
[1:44:18] she said God
[1:44:20] if you answer my prayer I'll serve you
[1:44:23] but not just me
[1:44:26] now she's speaking for the family
[1:44:30] but the child you give me
[1:44:34] to you all the days
[1:44:37] of his life
[1:44:39] how she how could she do that she
[1:44:40] couldn't be sure the child would be like
[1:44:42] that
[1:44:46] amen
[1:44:48] said I will
[1:44:50] if you and she was specific she she
[1:44:53] asked for a man child so I'll give them
[1:44:55] all the days of his life
[1:44:58] you know the story
[1:45:00] she conceived God gave it to her
[1:45:04] and when she
[1:45:05] had that child Samuel
[1:45:09] she took him
[1:45:11] most of you women have a hard time your
[1:45:13] mothers are all out there but you listen
[1:45:14] out there mothers as soon as a child was
[1:45:17] weaned
[1:45:23] that'd be every child in our church
[1:45:26] she took them to the priests
[1:45:29] the Tabernacle
[1:45:31] and she never took him home
[1:45:37] she came to church regular
[1:45:40] she wanted to see her son she had to
[1:45:42] come to church
[1:45:48] wow
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:53] it's like something oh God
[1:45:57] man
[1:45:59] she took him
[1:46:01] and kept her Covenant her vow
[1:46:04] she's reading she brought him back to
[1:46:05] the house of God
[1:46:07] and left them there and you know how
[1:46:09] powerful of a testimony Samuel was
[1:46:13] and it was because of a mother
[1:46:17] a hundred percent
[1:46:19] I'll just fast forward on that testimony
[1:46:21] Samuel was there and the Tabernacle was
[1:46:24] falling apart and the priesthood was
[1:46:26] falling apart and God was moving the
[1:46:28] pull
[1:46:29] unto Samuel's heart
[1:46:32] and God would answer this is just and
[1:46:34] I'm going to close with this I promise
[1:46:36] and God would say
[1:46:38] Samuel
[1:46:42] and he would jump out and run out and
[1:46:44] talk to the priest he said you called me
[1:46:46] the guy's like
[1:46:51] no I never thought
[1:46:53] so just go it's the middle of the night
[1:46:55] for crying out loud would you shut the
[1:46:57] radio off
[1:46:59] quit playing that message when you're
[1:47:00] sleeping
[1:47:02] you're hearing things
[1:47:04] coming back
[1:47:05] the three times
[1:47:08] I believe it was on the fourth time
[1:47:10] then God had to tell the whole priest he
[1:47:12] said
[1:47:15] it's actually me calling
[1:47:23] God's talking to us today
[1:47:25] he's been talking to you for a long time
[1:47:30] but are we hearing
[1:47:31] man listen to him
[1:47:35] God help me
[1:47:36] you know it's time
[1:47:39] that we were believers
[1:47:42] we're believers can I can I read just I
[1:47:46] I I just pulled this out of my Pulpit
[1:47:48] you know
[1:47:49] this is just beautiful it's talking
[1:47:51] about God and Jehovah and he says he was
[1:47:54] God was the all-existent one created and
[1:47:57] he created us off of him
[1:48:00] and he said so you are a temp you are an
[1:48:04] amateur
[1:48:05] of God
[1:48:08] and he said
[1:48:10] he gave men to be an amateur God because
[1:48:13] he was God the father and he man main
[1:48:16] man God small G and this was what he so
[1:48:20] he isn't the self-existing one anymore
[1:48:26] but he exists with his family
[1:48:31] wow
[1:48:35] God exists with his family God loves
[1:48:37] fellowship and that's what he made man
[1:48:39] for in the first place was the
[1:48:40] fellowship and he came down and renamed
[1:48:43] them back to himself because man
[1:48:45] wouldn't listen and fell
[1:48:47] because God loves Fellowship that much
[1:48:50] an object
[1:48:53] of worship was God
[1:48:55] but he won
[1:48:59] God help us amen just beautiful
