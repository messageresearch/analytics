[12:04] it becomes dangerous but you are still
[12:07] in control father so we praying for your

[12:42] mighty name of Jesus Christ. Father, we
[12:45] are rejuing ourselves here. We are

[29:43] worthy, isn't he?
[29:45] Amen. And what a privilege it is to be
[29:48] back home.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Nice to be back here. You could be
[29:54] seated for a little bit. May the Lord
[29:55] bless you. We're just grateful to the
[29:57] Lord for his mercy, for his grace, and
[30:01] um so nice to see everybody in the house
[30:03] of God today.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice to have this beautiful
[30:07] afternoon. And I open the door and it's
[30:10] warmer here than it is back at home. So
[30:12] I I thank thank the Lord for that. You
[30:14] talk about a miracle.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Warmer in Canada than it is in the
[30:17] southern Tennessee. Amen. It's pretty
[30:19] pretty good. It's pretty good. So, we um
[30:22] uh just literally coming right in. Got
[30:25] to the border down there and they were
[30:26] just one thing after another after
[30:28] another and I was looking and looking at
[30:30] my watch and things and I thought, "Now,
[30:32] Lord, you open the Red Sea for Moses.
[30:35] You're going to have to open these
[30:36] trucks up and things for me." And just a
[30:38] little bit after praying, all of a
[30:39] sudden just jammed all these lanes. All
[30:41] of a sudden, they started moving right
[30:43] on. And so I said, "Well, thank the
[30:45] Lord. He knows how to handle things,
[30:47] don't he?"
[30:49] Amen. And so, it's a real privilege to
[30:51] be here as always. I want to say thank
[30:52] you to Brother Dale and the church body
[30:54] for receiving us. It's always a
[30:56] privilege to be back in the house of
[30:57] God. So many nice, familiar faces all
[30:59] around. Just God bless each of you.
[31:01] Certainly salute all of the ministry
[31:03] here, Brother Norbar and Brother Jose
[31:05] and the different brothers. We
[31:06] appreciate all of you. And and um Amen.
[31:09] As always, the Lane Staff family, you
[31:11] know, they're like my family, you know,
[31:12] and so it's that's one reason it's home.
[31:16] Amen. And I I'm pretty sure some of
[31:19] y'all might debate that. Hey, brother
[31:21] Ben, wait a minute. You know, uh we're
[31:23] family, too. I know you might think
[31:25] that. Well, I feel the same way about
[31:27] you that you're thinking about me.
[31:28] That's for sure. And so, it's nice to be
[31:31] here. So, I thought before I preach a
[31:33] little bit, it be all right. I'm going
[31:35] to sing a song if you don't mind. All
[31:36] right. Yeah. I don't have Samantha with
[31:39] me. School time is in and so she's
[31:41] locked in. But uh you know, you'll have
[31:43] to put up with me for just a little bit.
[31:45] I guess be all right. So we thank the
[31:47] Lord. All right. God bless you.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Sing a little bit and then get right
[31:51] into the preaching of the word of the
[31:52] Lord.
[32:02] Somewhere beyond
[32:05] the grave,
[32:09] there is a land.
[32:14] A place Jesus went to
[32:18] prepare
[32:21] by his own hand.
[32:28] But for the save by grace
[32:34] there is our resting
[32:37] place.
[32:39] And in a few
[32:42] more days
[32:45] [Music]
[32:47] I'll be going
[32:51] home.
[32:56] Some call it
[33:00] heaven.
[33:05] I call it home.
[33:11] Some call it dreaming.
[33:17] Oh, let me dream.
[33:25] Some call it paradise.
[33:30] Somewhere beyond
[33:33] the sky.
[33:37] I call it heaven.
[33:43] I call it.
[33:50] Someone said you can go
[33:55] back home
[33:57] again.
[34:02] Things will never never be
[34:07] as good as
[34:10] they
[34:14] got
[34:16] good news for you.
[34:19] When heaven
[34:22] comes into view,
[34:26] one glimpse and you'll know the best
[34:32] is yet to
[34:35] come.
[34:38] Some call it
[34:42] heaven.
[34:44] [Music]
[34:46] I call it home.
[34:52] Some call it dreaming.
[34:56] [Music]
[34:59] Let me dream on.
[35:05] Some call it paradise.
[35:09] [Music]
[35:12] Somewhere
[35:13] beyond
[35:15] the sky,
[35:18] some call it heaven,
[35:23] but I call it home.
[35:27] I'm going to sing that second verse
[35:29] again.
[35:30] Some said you can't go
[35:34] back
[35:36] again. I want you to listen to this.
[35:40] Things will never never be
[35:46] as good as
[35:49] they
[35:53] have got good news for you. Yes, sir.
[35:59] Comes
[36:02] to you.
[36:06] I know
[36:08] the best is yet to come.
[36:15] Some call it heaven.
[36:20] Sing it if you know it.
[36:22] I call it home.
[36:28] Some call it dreaming.
[36:33] Just let me dream on
[36:40] some call it paradise.
[36:44] Yes, sir.
[36:46] Somewhere beyond the sky.
[36:52] Some call it heaven,
[36:56] but I call it home.
[37:01] Oh,
[37:04] some call it paradise.
[37:10] Somewhere beyond
[37:12] the sky,
[37:16] some call it.
[37:23] It's my future.
[37:27] I
[37:36] [Music]
[37:38] praise.
[37:39] [Music]
[37:44] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[37:48] Oh, bless his holy name.
[37:52] [Music]
[37:57] I faced a mountain
[38:02] like I'd never faced before.
[38:07] That's why I'm calling on you, Lord.
[38:13] I know it's been a while,
[38:17] but Lord, please hear my prayer.
[38:23] I need you, Lord, and I'm not ashamed to
[38:27] say.
[38:31] I hope I can get through it. This song
[38:33] blesses me. Sometimes it takes
[38:38] a mountain,
[38:42] [Music]
[38:44] a trouble sea.
[38:50] Sometimes it takes a desert
[38:57] to get a hold of me.
[39:04] Your love is so much stronger
[39:11] than whatever
[39:14] troubles me.
[39:18] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[39:25] to trust you and believe.
[39:31] [Music]
[39:34] Forgive me, Jesus.
[39:37] I thought I could control
[39:42] whatever life
[39:44] would throw my way.
[39:48] All that this I will admit
[39:51] has brought me to my knees.
[39:55] I need you Lord. I'm not ashamed
[39:59] to say
[40:02] to say
[40:04] sometimes it takes a mountain.
[40:10] Sometimes the trail will see.
[40:18] Sometimes it takes a desert
[40:24] to get a hold of me.
[40:30] Oh, your love is so much stronger.
[40:39] ever troubles me.
[40:43] Oh, yes it is. Sometimes it takes a
[40:48] mountain.
[40:50] I just say amen. I trust you and
[40:54] believe.
[40:59] Your love is so much stronger.
[41:09] troubles me.
[41:12] Oh,
[41:14] sometimes
[41:16] a mountain
[41:20] to trust you and believe.
[41:27] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[41:33] You say, "But what about faith? What
[41:36] about the word? What about all these
[41:38] things we've got confidence in? All of
[41:40] that is true. But you listen to me,
[41:41] human beings,
[41:43] sometimes human beings need
[41:45] encouragement and handfuls on purpose.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; We need the Holy Ghost sometimes to drop
[41:50] things into our pathway to let us know
[41:52] we're still saved, still loved. So our
[41:55] name is on the book of life, the Lamb's
[41:57] book of life, to know that we're still
[41:59] Christian. That he still wants to fool
[42:01] with us, still wants to use us, still
[42:04] wants to bless us.
[42:05] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[42:11] to trust you and believe.
[42:16] And the church said, "Amen."
[42:19] Oh, to trust you and
[42:23] believe.
[42:25] [Applause]
[42:30] Praise the Lord.
[42:34] Amen. Amen and amen. Let's stand
[42:36] together. Get right into the preaching
[42:39] of the word of the Lord.
[42:41] Ain't Jesus good?
[42:44] &gt;&gt; I love him with all of my heart.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Not only has he been good to me, but
[42:49] he's stood by me every step of the way.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; I'm so grateful for his mercy.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; You know, the fact that he just keeps on
[42:59] fooling with us. Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; I know that may not bless some people,
[43:03] but it blesses me.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; God absolutely, I can promise you
[43:08] friends, God absolutely loves the
[43:10] children of God. He loves the people of
[43:12] God. No matter what's going on in our
[43:14] lives or how far it looks like things
[43:16] are going, you know, off the beaten
[43:18] path,
[43:19] &gt;&gt; human beings still need encouragement
[43:21] from the Lord.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And I'm grateful to be one of those
[43:24] humans that is encouraged of the Lord.
[43:28] Amen. If you have your Bibles this
[43:30] evening, we're going to go to a couple
[43:31] places. We'll start in St. John chapter
[43:33] 3 verse 16. Very familiar
[43:37] little Bible scripture for us that we
[43:40] learned. Perhaps one of the first ones
[43:41] we ever learned. It might be just this
[43:44] one right here. And so want to look at a
[43:47] couple things that
[43:49] Brother Ram said here in just a moment.
[43:51] But I I want to speak to you this
[43:52] evening, the Lord helping us upon the
[43:55] world is dying for love. The world is
[43:58] dying for love. St. John 3:1 16, for God
[44:01] so loved the world that he gave his only
[44:04] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[44:08] him should not perish but have
[44:11] everlasting
[44:14] life. Then I want to go to one more
[44:16] scripture if we can uh get into the
[44:19] Bible in the book of Corinthians.
[44:22] We're going to look at just one more
[44:24] verse of scripture. We're going to pray
[44:25] and I'll let you be seated. Amen. And
[44:28] we're going to get settled in to hear
[44:29] what the Lord's going to speak to us.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 13.
[44:35] And I want to pick up verse um 8.
[44:41] 1 Corinthians 13:8.
[44:45] Charity never faileth.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; But where there be prophecies, they
[44:50] shall fail. Whether there be tongues,
[44:52] they shall cease. Whether there be
[44:55] knowledge, it shall vanish away. Let's
[44:57] pray together for the word. Lord Jesus,
[45:00] we thank you so much for the opportunity
[45:02] to be able to come into your house
[45:03] tonight.
[45:05] It's just a wonderful feeling, Lord, to
[45:07] walk into the building full of the
[45:09] saints of God, to feel that great
[45:12] expectation of your spirit hanging in
[45:15] every heart.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, my heart's expecting, too. So many
[45:19] things, Lord Jesus, that we want to know
[45:22] from your presence. So many things we
[45:23] want to learn from you. May we sit as it
[45:26] were at your feet tonight to be able to
[45:29] learn from the great teacher, the great
[45:32] rabbi. Father, we love you and thank you
[45:36] for this opportunity to read the word.
[45:39] And Father, the Bible said that any man
[45:41] or woman that would read it, blessed are
[45:43] they that read and hear the words of
[45:46] these prophecies. And father, we thank
[45:48] you for even being able to read it to
[45:50] have understanding, common understanding
[45:52] that we can hear your truth. We thank
[45:54] you for all of the safe journey of every
[45:58] wayward pilgrim traveling in this great
[46:00] life to come into this joint fellowship
[46:02] tonight. Thank you for every leader and
[46:04] for every son and daughter of God
[46:06] gathered here tonight. Lord Jesus, if
[46:09] there be one amongst us in any way,
[46:12] Lord, that possibly might be fighting a
[46:14] great battle greater than they've ever
[46:16] expected in their life, may tonight you
[46:18] come to their pew and visit them with
[46:21] your great delivering power. If there be
[46:23] those that are discouraged, may they be
[46:24] encouraged. Those that are sick, may
[46:26] they be healed. May your power, your
[46:29] grace, and your mercy move and wash over
[46:32] us tonight and through thy word that we
[46:34] might be recipients of everything you
[46:37] want to say to us as we open our heart
[46:40] both speaker and listener and commit it
[46:43] and dedicate it to you, Lord, in the
[46:45] name of Jesus Christ. And the saints
[46:48] said, "Amen." God bless you. May be
[46:50] seated. Amen. So good to see everybody.
[46:53] Amen. The house of the Lord. Did you
[46:54] leave this for me? Amen. All right.
[46:56] Praise the Lord. Thank you. You know me
[46:58] well. I didn't bring one with me. It's
[47:00] sitting back here on her in the car
[47:01] somewhere. Amen. And uh and see this is
[47:04] why I call them family right here. They
[47:05] know me already. Amen. And I Amen. I
[47:08] appreciate that. Amen. So very much. And
[47:12] and so um so many things that I think
[47:15] when I get up here, I'm going to say
[47:16] this and comment on that and whatever
[47:18] more. And you know, just time gets away
[47:20] before you even know what you're
[47:22] thinking about saying. And uh I just got
[47:25] to looking at some things, you know,
[47:27] coming up the road. I was just
[47:29] meditating and I still had about two or
[47:31] three directions that I wanted to go.
[47:33] And uh I thought, well, now if I start
[47:35] that, they start at 3, we'll be done at
[47:38] 8.
[47:39] And then I thought another one. I
[47:41] thought, will that be a good text? I
[47:42] thought, no, if I start that one, 5:30,
[47:45] we'll be in the middle of a great altar
[47:46] call, more than likely. Amen. So, you
[47:48] know, you just kindly trust the Lord in
[47:50] these matters. You don't always know
[47:52] exactly which way the Lord's going to
[47:54] send you, but I studied and I've applied
[47:57] myself for this meeting this weekend,
[47:59] and I'm looking for the great Holy
[48:01] Spirit to speak to us by his word.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I believe he can sure do it.
[48:06] Don't you think so?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Now, we're living in a time that is we
[48:10] know the world in the condition as is, I
[48:13] mean, you and I both can agree
[48:15] wholeheartedly that the world is indeed
[48:18] dying for love. But uh I I I don't want
[48:21] to just leave it just in that form. But
[48:24] I I want to show how that we as the
[48:27] people of God can get to that place of
[48:29] the love of God and declaring it not
[48:32] only to those around us and those that
[48:34] need to hear it, but also how to receive
[48:37] it within oursel. And uh there's many
[48:40] many things that I'd like to share with
[48:42] you. But I'm going to quote some of this
[48:44] instead of reading some of this. And so
[48:46] if you got your uh your tablet or your
[48:48] pencil or your paper, your phone,
[48:49] wherever how you keep a note, I'm going
[48:51] to give you as many scriptures as I can
[48:52] throw your direction and you you get
[48:53] them ready and uh study them. And uh I
[48:56] want to start you out on uh Matthew 24
[49:00] and verse 12. Now again, I'm going to
[49:01] try to quote some of this rather than
[49:03] spend a lot of time reading because uh
[49:05] you know uh you you know uh you know how
[49:08] I am. You all know what kind of preacher
[49:09] I am. And if I do too much reading,
[49:11] we'll be here two and a half hours. And
[49:12] Amen. It's not that it's a problem. We
[49:14] enjoy the long service if the Lord's in
[49:16] it. I told somebody one time, I said, "A
[49:18] guy preaching under the inspiration for
[49:20] two hours," Amen. He didn't preach long
[49:22] enough. Anybody that preaches out from
[49:24] under the inspiration, 20 minutes is too
[49:26] long. Amen. That's right. It needs to be
[49:28] inspired. Ain't that right?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want the Holy Spirit to be
[49:31] on it. And so we we want to look at this
[49:34] great subject. Amen. And I just want to
[49:36] call your attention to this scripture in
[49:38] Matthew 24 because iniquity, Jesus said,
[49:41] shall abound. The what? The love of many
[49:46] shall wax cold. Now, I I want to call
[49:48] your attention to something right
[49:49] quickly. And I want you to realize this
[49:51] kind of love that he's referring to.
[49:54] He's not referring to agape love per se.
[49:56] He's talking about the ailio love or the
[49:59] human love or the compassion that
[50:01] someone would have, amen, for another
[50:04] human being. And the prophet described
[50:05] it like this. He said many many years
[50:07] ago and this is back in his many many
[50:09] years ago. He said that when uh someone
[50:12] died in the community, said everybody
[50:13] knew about it, they'd rush to help and
[50:15] benefit and support and and and prop up
[50:18] and things. He said, "But now," he said,
[50:20] "In this day," and he's talking in the
[50:21] 60s here. Amen. He said, "You don't even
[50:24] know that your neighbor has died until
[50:26] you read it in the newspaper somewhere."
[50:28] He said, "What is it?" He said that the
[50:30] love amongst people has gone down, down,
[50:34] down, down until Jesus said the reason
[50:37] for it being that way is because
[50:39] iniquity has abounded amongst humanity.
[50:43] Now I want you to think in your mind
[50:44] about what iniquity is. The prophet
[50:46] tells us it is to know to do something
[50:49] uh according to the word, according to
[50:51] scripture, not just according to your
[50:52] thought of it now, but according to the
[50:54] word and fail to do it. And yet we
[50:57] realize that a person that has been
[50:59] baptized with the Holy Ghost, amen, that
[51:01] has the agape love of God in their
[51:03] heart, can even in that form of it,
[51:06] humanistically speaking now, can get
[51:08] colder and colder on the Lord. He told
[51:11] them in that first church age because
[51:13] you left your first love. Now notice the
[51:16] love itself was still there. The love
[51:18] itself was still accessible and you was
[51:21] able to access that a genuine agape love
[51:24] of God. But they were the ones that fell
[51:27] away from the fire, from the heat, and
[51:30] from the passion of serving Jesus Christ
[51:33] when he fell on the day of Pentecost.
[51:34] Stay with me a little while. Amen. Now,
[51:36] remember, the Holy Spirit then is
[51:38] calling a bride in the last day to do
[51:40] what? To demonstrate love in the
[51:43] greatest age of hatred that has ever
[51:46] been on the face of this earth. I
[51:49] thought about this coming up the road,
[51:50] Brother Jim. How evil man can become.
[51:53] How hateful they become. How that
[51:55] everything about them just gets worse
[51:58] every year. Every year. Every year.
[52:00] Amen. And if you've been watching any of
[52:02] the politics in the United States, which
[52:04] I'm sure you have, Amen. you can see on
[52:07] display almost weekly or daily. Amen.
[52:10] the depravity and the absolute depths of
[52:13] degrt that humankind has got, especially
[52:16] down there in that cursed place, amen,
[52:18] called the United States of America.
[52:20] Amen. Trump might be a lot of people's
[52:22] savior. He's not mine. I've already give
[52:23] my heart to my savior. Amen. I'm not
[52:26] looking for politics to rescue me. Come
[52:28] on, don't get quiet.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible didn't say that politics
[52:31] would come in the last day and turn our
[52:33] hearts back. Amen. It said that Malachi
[52:35] 4 would. Amen. Christ would come, Amen.
[52:38] to return our heart back to the original
[52:41] faith of the fathers. Amen. The same
[52:44] faith that produced for them the agape
[52:47] love of God. I heard brother say it just
[52:48] this week. He said they didn't go out
[52:50] and build a bunch of schools and and
[52:52] build up a bunch of money and a great
[52:54] big old tithing account and millions of
[52:56] dollars and buildings and things. You
[52:57] know what he said? They divided among
[52:59] themselves severally as they would that
[53:01] they could have all things in common.
[53:03] Amen. I'm not suggesting we become the
[53:05] Amish or something. Amen. and go out and
[53:07] go live in some cave somewhere or
[53:09] another. Amen. But the love of God
[53:11] constrain them people. Amen. Don't put
[53:13] nothing first but Jesus Christ and body
[53:17] of Christ.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if we do that and we
[53:21] keep that focus, you could be a multi
[53:23] multi-rillionaire. If your heart is on
[53:25] God, you'll always do the right thing. I
[53:28] feel that if God can trust you with your
[53:30] soul, he can Amen. ent and trust you
[53:32] with your walk and trust you with the
[53:33] word and things that he'll trust you
[53:35] with money. But let's be honest, it's
[53:37] become an Achilles heel for many of our
[53:39] church people.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; I was listening this week to a message
[53:44] called Presuming 11762.
[53:46] Everybody had him say something that
[53:48] really stuck with me in a way that I
[53:50] never thought of it just this way
[53:52] before. But he was talking about how
[53:54] that the Pentecostal people have become
[53:56] so fashionable. He said, "But I wouldn't
[53:59] care if a man come and preach in
[54:00] overhauls to me."
[54:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "As long as he brings the power
[54:04] of God and the word of God.
[54:06] He said, "But then some little
[54:07] curly-headed fellow he called it,
[54:09] comes." He said, "He dips that head and
[54:10] poses for the camera so they can put
[54:12] those curls out there and show, amen,
[54:14] the advertisement of it." And he said,
[54:16] "Pentecost, you backslid from what you
[54:19] originally had." In other words, the
[54:22] love of praise, the love of attention,
[54:25] the love of a building or a big society
[54:28] had replaced the genuine love of Jesus
[54:31] Christ.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; All right, message people. Now I'm
[54:34] coming home. Amen. If that was that way
[54:36] 60 years ago, what about some of our
[54:39] people around the ranks? Amen. We have
[54:41] been just to say it just in a very very
[54:44] plain way. We've had the revealed word
[54:46] thrown in our lap. Forgive me for that,
[54:49] but it's the truth. Amen. We've had the
[54:51] word thrown in our lap. And what are we
[54:53] doing with it today? The same exact
[54:55] thing they done with it 60 years ago.
[54:57] Amen. Trying to build better and get
[54:59] better preachers, more educated this and
[55:01] more money that. Amen. And we've left
[55:03] the main thing which was the love of
[55:06] God.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; The love of Jesus Christ inside the
[55:13] human heart that brought a man to his
[55:15] knees in repentance every time. Brought
[55:18] a woman to her knees in repentance.
[55:21] Brought families back to the family
[55:22] altar, reading the Bible and doing
[55:24] devotions, giving their heart to Jesus
[55:27] Christ. Amen. And if we had more of
[55:29] that, you'd see a whole lot more in the
[55:31] churches that were walking where they
[55:33] should walk. But the reason we have so
[55:35] much discouragement is because we've
[55:37] allowed the love for everything else to
[55:40] take place of the love of God.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Well, not so many amens now, but I'm
[55:45] still in it.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm still telling you the truth, and
[55:49] it's right.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; And if you if you know what's good for
[55:52] you, shake your head this way. Don't
[55:54] dare shake it that way,
[55:56] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm telling you the truth, brother.
[55:58] And it's not just Canada. It's not just
[55:59] the United States, but all around the
[56:01] world, this lady seeing thing is
[56:04] swallowing people up
[56:05] &gt;&gt; quicker than we can keep count of who's
[56:07] going out.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; God help us. As Jesus said, because
[56:12] iniquity shall abound, the love of many
[56:15] shall wax cold. This word, Amen, waxing
[56:18] cold simply means to cool by blowing.
[56:23] You see, friends, we're living in the
[56:24] most connected age that we've ever lived
[56:27] in. You can get on your your cell phone,
[56:30] your tablet. They're doing it tonight.
[56:32] You can stream online. People from all
[56:34] around the world sitting in their bark
[56:36] lounger. They're lazy boys. Is that all
[56:39] right if they got one? Amen. Can sit
[56:41] right here and enjoy service with us.
[56:44] And yet people can sit right families
[56:46] and individuals alike can sit right
[56:49] across from one another at a kitchen
[56:51] table and be so disconnected they don't
[56:54] even know what's going on in each
[56:55] other's lives.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you a story. It's a
[56:59] little rude in a way, but I I feel led
[57:01] to tell it. Some years ago, there was a
[57:03] young woman that got on one of these uh
[57:05] dating websites and she had decided she
[57:08] wasn't going to serve the Lord no more.
[57:09] And and uh she was just kind of toying
[57:12] around with her husband a little bit.
[57:13] wasn't being really faithful. And he
[57:15] told a story how that she told him later
[57:18] that she'd be sitting right in the bed
[57:20] next to him and they'd be sitting there,
[57:21] maybe their head up against the
[57:22] headboard, maybe reading or talking or
[57:25] whatever they're doing. She had her
[57:26] phone out and said she was sitting there
[57:28] making fun. My husband don't even know
[57:30] that you and I are talking. I'll see you
[57:31] tomorrow, sweetie. And this, that, and
[57:33] the other. Sitting right in the bed next
[57:35] to her husband and flirting with her
[57:37] little side thing she had going on.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; We're living in the most connected age
[57:41] we've ever been. But we're more
[57:43] disconnected now than we've ever been in
[57:45] human history.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen to brother Ben, young
[57:48] people. This thing is not something I'm
[57:50] going to tell you is of the devil. I'm
[57:52] going to tell you it's not good. It's
[57:53] not bad. It's off the tree of knowledge
[57:55] of good and evil. And I'm going to tell
[57:57] you, if you don't have the Holy Ghost,
[57:58] you'll never know how to manage it
[58:00] right.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; It'll get you every single time. And
[58:03] except a man be born again, he'll get in
[58:05] trouble. Except a woman be born again,
[58:08] the devil will get them through some
[58:09] kind of divisibility. We got to pay
[58:11] attention to these things. Preachers are
[58:14] running around still preaching against
[58:15] television. Let Let me tell you
[58:16] something right now. You can preach on
[58:18] the TV all day long. This thing I got
[58:20] laying up here way worse than a
[58:21] television ever thought about being.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will take you into every
[58:25] library. It'll take you into every smut
[58:27] thing. It'll take you into everything
[58:28] you want.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Kids walking around with ear pods
[58:32] and and ear ear things in their ear.
[58:34] Amen. Listening to all kinds of ungodly
[58:36] filth. And mom and dad walking around
[58:37] their head in a cloud. Don't even know
[58:38] what's happening.
[58:40] Amen. Don't just preach to me about
[58:42] television. Amen. Don't just preach to
[58:44] me about devices, but preach to me in
[58:46] love. Hallelujah. That'll take my heart
[58:49] away from all of that. And put it back
[58:50] in the word of God where it belongs.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. For he that loves the
[58:55] world or the things that are in the
[58:56] world, the love of God is not even in
[58:58] that person.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; But if God's love was there, Amen. And
[59:02] you wouldn't have to worry about kids
[59:03] reaching for the wrong thing, adults
[59:05] reaching for the wrong thing, middle-ag
[59:07] and whoever more, families reaching for
[59:09] the wrong thing. The love of God would
[59:11] burn so deeply and so brightly that they
[59:14] would want nothing more but more of
[59:16] Jesus.
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I I know how we feel about it. Preach
[59:23] against it. We did that on the tele on
[59:25] the telephones many, many years ago.
[59:28] Where'd they go? I bet every one of
[59:30] you's got a telephone in your house.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even in the church.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Jose. Amen. And
[59:38] what I'm trying to tell you is that we
[59:40] tried for years to shove this stuff out
[59:42] of the church. Just like Christmas, the
[59:44] prophet said, is here to stay. So is
[59:46] this stuff here to stay.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of whether or not we
[59:50] get out there with picket signs and down
[59:52] with technology and down with the
[59:53] rudeness of the world and down. They'll
[59:55] never listen to you know.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The main thing is to go back into
[59:59] that human heart. Are you listening to
[1:00:02] me tonight? Say, "Amen."
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody help me preach a
[1:00:05] little bit. The main thing is go back
[1:00:07] into that human heart and let the love
[1:00:09] of God change them forever until
[1:00:12] something in them don't even want to
[1:00:14] look at it no more. That's right.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; We preached it and preached it and had
[1:00:18] one prayer line after another and one
[1:00:20] altar call after another and the best in
[1:00:22] the message and the best on the face of
[1:00:23] this earth have preached it to the
[1:00:25] people that need to hear it. And yet it
[1:00:27] still goes on.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; What's missing? The love of God
[1:00:32] that takes away the sins of the world.
[1:00:34] The love of God that takes away the
[1:00:36] burdens and the guilt. The love of God
[1:00:38] that takes away all of the devices and
[1:00:41] Satan's traps in this last day. Kids go
[1:00:44] to school, they're going to need
[1:00:44] electronics.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Sure. People are gathered in a church
[1:00:48] like this, we're going to have
[1:00:49] electronics all over the place. Amen. I
[1:00:52] need a microphone to preach. I need one.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. because my mouth is so little. You
[1:00:57] know, you can't hear me unless I have
[1:00:58] one.
[1:01:01] Praise the Lord, somebody.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Man, we have these things a part of our
[1:01:05] life. They're part of your job. They're
[1:01:06] part of everything. But what have they
[1:01:08] served to do? Disconnect people one from
[1:01:11] another.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Phones that can reach to the other side
[1:01:14] of the world, as I said, and hearts that
[1:01:16] can't even reach across the table.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; That's the age we're living in.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a hard thing. We got churches
[1:01:24] on every corner, streaming services full
[1:01:27] of sermons, and enough teaching to fill
[1:01:30] the internet 10 times over of the
[1:01:32] preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Sure. And yet here we sit around hearing
[1:01:38] all of that, knowing all of that, having
[1:01:41] the Bible in every form, and having the
[1:01:42] message in every form we can have it.
[1:01:44] And yet we still come to the house of
[1:01:47] God and sit in a pew and feel like
[1:01:50] somehow Jesus don't love me.
[1:01:53] That's right.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But you say, "Brother Ben, I I I I know
[1:02:00] what the profit." It's the more there's
[1:02:01] a difference between knowing what
[1:02:02] Brother Brandon said about it,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And having the revelation of it deep in
[1:02:07] your heart yourself.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Sure. Oh, you say now preacher, you're
[1:02:12] going to fool around and you're going to
[1:02:13] get beside yourself. Well, I'm happy.
[1:02:15] Leave me alone.
[1:02:17] Don't bother me if I get next to myself.
[1:02:19] Just let me go on.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know no better know how. So, you
[1:02:22] might as well just let me go on. Now,
[1:02:25] watch this. In the resurrection of
[1:02:26] Lazarus, brother said, "We've got plenty
[1:02:28] of teaching, plenty of churches, but we
[1:02:30] need more of my messages,
[1:02:33] more in my books, more of my sermons,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; more gifts.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; We need more of the most anointed
[1:02:41] evangelists in the world. We need more
[1:02:44] of the love of God." Can you imagine
[1:02:48] this prophet saying to us that these
[1:02:50] things are more important than gifts or
[1:02:53] anything else? More important than
[1:02:54] prophecy, tongue or anything else? Where
[1:02:57] they are there, they will fail.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Like you take for example the great
[1:03:02] controversies over some of the things
[1:03:03] that didn't come to pass in brother
[1:03:05] Brennham's visions. And people have have
[1:03:07] lost their mind and quit God and quit
[1:03:10] church over the thing with the brown
[1:03:11] bear.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, a vision is a thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:03:15] That's right. As God is concerned, when
[1:03:18] God tells you something's going to
[1:03:20] happen, it's going to happen. But the
[1:03:22] human element
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; can cause it to fail.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And just because Brother Brandham was
[1:03:33] supposed to shoot a brown bear doesn't
[1:03:35] mean that he was going to actually be
[1:03:37] there to shoot the brown bear if he
[1:03:39] wasn't there to shoot the brown bear.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I'm just giving you a little example.
[1:03:45] Now, brother Bam told us, he said,
[1:03:46] "God's part happened."
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Bisll just told us a story some
[1:03:50] years ago how that brotherham had told
[1:03:52] him what happened. He said, "Only the
[1:03:54] second time I ever failed the Lord like
[1:03:55] this was when I listen to that bunch of
[1:03:57] preachers in Africa down there.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; God's part, God brought the vision
[1:04:02] exactly where it needed to be. But where
[1:04:04] there is prophecy, it can fail.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that can't fail.
[1:04:09] That's the love of God."
[1:04:13] I'm going to go on record and say
[1:04:15] something else to you. Do you know what
[1:04:16] held brother Brandham when he realized
[1:04:18] he messed up? You know what held the
[1:04:20] prophet when he took that amoeba and
[1:04:22] like to die over listen that bunch of
[1:04:24] preachers? How many times did he stand
[1:04:25] on the platform and tell the people, "I
[1:04:28] can't do nothing. I'm waiting on the
[1:04:29] angel of the Lord to come and if he'll
[1:04:31] come, I know he'll do the work." How
[1:04:33] many times did brother Brandham see
[1:04:35] failure after failure at that platform
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; and still want off preaching?
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; You don't imagine in your mind that
[1:04:44] every person that come through the
[1:04:45] prayer line got healed, do you?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You're silly if you think that.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; You're living in a delusion.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet told us himself that many of
[1:04:53] them come through the prayer line never
[1:04:55] even got nothing from God. Many of them
[1:04:57] didn't have the kind of faith they
[1:04:58] needed to get what they needed from God.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they what you done. An angel
[1:05:03] of the Lord stood there and told him,
[1:05:04] "You'll pray for kings and everything
[1:05:06] else." And here this prophet stands in
[1:05:08] Minneapolis and made a challenge that
[1:05:11] some blind girl was going to see and he
[1:05:13] failed.
[1:05:15] And brother stood right there on the
[1:05:17] platform, prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:05:18] and she was stone blind. You know what
[1:05:21] the Lord told him? He said, "You made a
[1:05:23] challenge that not even I made when I
[1:05:25] was here in my human body. I never said
[1:05:28] that it's going to be certain certain
[1:05:29] way if you pray for people." He said,
[1:05:31] "If you can get them to believe,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; you don't demand God. You don't command
[1:05:37] God.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; You believe God.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; And if it's his will, it happens the way
[1:05:41] he says it's going to happen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; But there is a human element.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; I told a little group of people here
[1:05:47] just the other weekend, back in the
[1:05:49] summer, I should say, that some of the
[1:05:50] most precious things that I've ever
[1:05:53] learned in this message was from Brett
[1:05:54] Brennham's humanities and his mistakes.
[1:05:57] I come to respect him deeper, respect
[1:06:00] him more and love the message even more.
[1:06:02] When I could hear a prophet stand up and
[1:06:04] say, "I got under a bunch of pressure
[1:06:06] and told a lie."
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; That helps me.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe it don't help you, but that helps
[1:06:11] me.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to hear brother Brandham go
[1:06:14] through all of these ups and downs of
[1:06:17] Christianity and yet right to the end,
[1:06:20] he stood faithful. What done that?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Not the messianic sign. Not the sign in
[1:06:26] his hand. Not that he was Malachi 4. Not
[1:06:29] that he was Revelation 10. Come on,
[1:06:31] somebody help me.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That's not the thing that held him. But
[1:06:34] what held him was the love of Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; To know God loved
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; that he loved God.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the main thing. Amen. If a
[1:06:45] man lives long enough and old enough,
[1:06:47] and if he gets down in his age,
[1:06:49] something like that, he's going to have
[1:06:51] to quit preaching.
[1:06:53] let me get a little age on me or
[1:06:54] something like that. I may not be able
[1:06:56] to sing anymore. My hands might be so
[1:06:59] arthritic ridden or something like that.
[1:07:00] I might never be able to play the piano
[1:07:02] at some point in my life. That doesn't
[1:07:04] take God out of me.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; That doesn't take me away from loving
[1:07:08] him.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; His love is what holds us
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; more than anything. The prophet said, he
[1:07:14] said, "That's right." He said, "You
[1:07:15] can't borrow $5 without $10 worth of
[1:07:17] security on it this day." He said,
[1:07:20] "That's right. no love because iniquity
[1:07:22] shall abound. That's what's the matter
[1:07:24] with the world. They're dying for love.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at a couple little
[1:07:32] things here. Now, they shall wax cold.
[1:07:34] Again, Matthew 24:12.
[1:07:37] Trill or grow cold by blowing. Chill by
[1:07:42] blowing. Grow cold by blowing. In other
[1:07:44] words, love does not die instantly,
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; but it freezes gradually
[1:07:52] under the cold winds of sin and
[1:07:54] iniquity.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You take a church, brother, sister, and
[1:07:58] I've seen this in my many years of
[1:08:00] traveling. You take a group of people
[1:08:03] that's on love in love with God and on
[1:08:05] fire for God. Bring them into the church
[1:08:07] and let that group start criticizing,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; start nitpicking everything that moves.
[1:08:15] You take that individual or that church
[1:08:16] or that people or that family,
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; you'll watch what they used to have by
[1:08:21] the love of God starts dwindling away.
[1:08:23] Looks like
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; they don't raise their hands no more.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; They don't amen no more.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; They don't have a commitment to want to
[1:08:32] be clear about the things of God. They
[1:08:34] just want to debate something all the
[1:08:36] time.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; And I want to be very clear, a debating
[1:08:40] spirit is an antichrist spirit.
[1:08:44] Just take me for example since I'm
[1:08:46] standing here. You got something wrong
[1:08:47] with something I preach and you
[1:08:49] instantly the first thing you can think
[1:08:50] of is how you want to straighten me out
[1:08:52] or correct me. You need to get first the
[1:08:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost and or you
[1:08:56] need to get that old devil off you
[1:08:58] that's got you in that kind of mindset.
[1:09:00] The love of God would never put a man in
[1:09:03] such a condition or a woman in such a
[1:09:05] condition. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; The love of God would make you say,
[1:09:08] "Maybe I don't understand what the
[1:09:10] brother's saying, but Lord, if I'm
[1:09:11] wrong, help me understand what's true."
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; But you don't see that in our churches.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; You know what? You see a bunch of
[1:09:22] professional debaters.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And if you say 1962, my God, heaven help
[1:09:27] you, it was 1961, you have committed the
[1:09:29] unpardonable sin. All right.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; They know it right down to the uh uh uh
[1:09:34] and the dthe and but but they will hold
[1:09:37] your feet to the fire over something
[1:09:40] that doesn't even mean eternal life.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; The elected cannot be deceived.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; I don't sit around worrying about
[1:09:49] everything preached and oh somebody
[1:09:51] preached something wrong. Everybody
[1:09:53] preaches something wrong at some point
[1:09:54] in their life.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what holds me is not my
[1:09:58] theology, but the love of almighty God.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a whole lot more neology
[1:10:09] anyways than theology.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Forgive me. That wasn't even
[1:10:15] fair. But that's true.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, plenty of teaching, plenty
[1:10:20] of churches, but we need the love of
[1:10:23] God. Now, what happens when the love of
[1:10:26] God starts cooling down in people? All
[1:10:28] right. Now, I want you to think about
[1:10:30] what we've seen over the last many years
[1:10:32] of being in the message. When you get
[1:10:35] somebody that they have so cooled down
[1:10:38] in their love for Jesus Christ,
[1:10:41] doctrine or their point of doctrine
[1:10:44] becomes a weapon. Right.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; People that do not have the love of God,
[1:10:49] now listen close, will weaponize the
[1:10:52] word,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; You take somebody, you know, their kids
[1:10:59] aren't saved and that father in that
[1:11:02] home, we'll use for example, has got
[1:11:04] this idea that, boy, I better lay down
[1:11:07] the law. I'm gonna lose my children.
[1:11:10] If you don't love them right,
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; no matter what he says will never
[1:11:15] prosper him or benefit him,
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; it'll actually drag him down even
[1:11:19] further.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And the weapon will become a word
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; of of of ammunition, of of debating, of
[1:11:27] of downgrading, devaluing, of of shoving
[1:11:31] in the mud and kicking in the face and
[1:11:33] throwing sand in the eyes and the whole
[1:11:35] thing.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; They become bullies. Spiritual bullies.
[1:11:39] Yeah,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; we wonder times why families in this
[1:11:42] message, the second these kids get old
[1:11:45] enough to do something, they run 40 ways
[1:11:46] to Sunday.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. Maybe it's because
[1:11:49] every time you told them that uh when
[1:11:51] somebody said Merry Christmas one to
[1:11:53] another, you put them in the in the
[1:11:54] middle of hell for saying Merry
[1:11:55] Christmas.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; I wish people believe the message like
[1:11:59] they're supposed to believe it because
[1:12:00] the prophet said Merry Christmas.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a tree. He gave
[1:12:04] gifts. He wasn't a pagan. I heard him
[1:12:06] say it just the other day. He said
[1:12:08] Christmas should be a day of worship,
[1:12:09] not celebration.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; That's your prophet saying that.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But many of our kids run out the back
[1:12:15] door and quit the message over simple
[1:12:17] things like being so dogmatic and so
[1:12:20] legalistic.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm coming anyhow, devil. You
[1:12:24] might as well buckle up here. I'm
[1:12:26] coming.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Every little thing. Well, glory
[1:12:31] to God. Your dress better be right to
[1:12:33] the floor.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; And yet, Brother Brandham's own
[1:12:36] daughters Yes, sir.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; You can see photos where media and every
[1:12:39] one of them have their dress right below
[1:12:40] their knee. The prophet said the rule is
[1:12:42] standing or sitting cover up that knee.
[1:12:45] Why? Cuz the Bible said this part is the
[1:12:47] nakedness of a person.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; That's a truth.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And if a man's got so many problems he's
[1:12:52] lusting after somebody's calf, he needs
[1:12:54] a Holy Ghost.
[1:12:56] [Applause]
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Right? But the point I'm making is this
[1:13:00] is what happens when the love leaves the
[1:13:02] home. When love leaves the church, the
[1:13:05] pastor goes on the attack. He picks out
[1:13:07] every little thing that he don't like
[1:13:08] and and the evangelist will pick out
[1:13:10] everything and they just hammer hammer
[1:13:11] hammer. You can do it if you've got the
[1:13:13] love of God in your heart doing it.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; But if the love isn't there, it becomes
[1:13:18] a weapon.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; And instead of encouraging people to
[1:13:21] come to Christ,
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; it shoves them right out the back door.
[1:13:25] It encourages them to leave.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz the world doesn't want to hear a
[1:13:30] weaponized message.
[1:13:36] They can tell. You can't bluff humanity.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; When a preacher gets up if he's got the
[1:13:41] love of God, you can feel he loves you.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; He might be ripping the hide right off
[1:13:45] your bones, but you know he's loving
[1:13:47] you.
[1:13:48] But if it becomes a weapon, you can tell
[1:13:51] by the lack of the output of the spirit
[1:13:54] of God that the thing is more just
[1:13:56] trying to get people put in a position
[1:13:59] to where that whoever it is that's got
[1:14:01] that agenda feels comfortable that now
[1:14:04] they've accomplished what they wanted to
[1:14:06] accomplish in their heart.
[1:14:08] There's many, many, many of our families
[1:14:11] that are sitting right now at a home
[1:14:13] somewhere or somewhere else with a
[1:14:15] broken heart over the way that the truth
[1:14:17] was handled in their lives.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; And you know what they need? They need
[1:14:21] somebody from the inside to go to the
[1:14:23] outside and show them the love of God.
[1:14:26] That it may have been preached, it may
[1:14:28] have been taught, it may have been
[1:14:30] believed, but God, this is a brand new
[1:14:32] morning and yesterday ended last night.
[1:14:36] We can go on in Jesus Christ.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; We can go on in Christ.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not a debater. If anybody knows
[1:14:45] anything about me at all, I'm a
[1:14:46] peacemaker. But mercy, Lord Jesus, when
[1:14:49] this anointing comes on me, it is just
[1:14:51] as rough and hard and rude as it can
[1:14:53] possibly. Why? Because the love of God
[1:14:55] constrains you to set before the people
[1:14:58] only that which will help them instead
[1:15:00] of hurting them.
[1:15:03] And if we don't have this love in our
[1:15:04] heart,
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; the message will become a weapon for us.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Sure. And we don't want to weaponize the
[1:15:11] message. We don't want to make the
[1:15:13] message a weapon to prove our own
[1:15:17] points.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Listen to me carefully. The message in
[1:15:21] the Bible isn't here to prove my point.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; My point needs to be proved by the
[1:15:25] message in the Bible.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the the the truth of God
[1:15:33] not mixed with the love of God
[1:15:36] can be a a killer.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; You say now, brother Ben, now wait a
[1:15:43] minute. Paul said
[1:15:46] that the letter killth.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; But the spirit gives life.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; So if the word is not mixed with love,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; it'll kill you. Yeah.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; It'll lay you into a place to where you
[1:16:00] yourself don't even know
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; how to feel about Christ,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; about yourself.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; It'll leave you in a state of confusion.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Words. Amen. In case you forgot it.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of us that are so, you
[1:16:19] know, our whole attitude and our whole
[1:16:20] way of life is glory to God. If I can
[1:16:23] just read it, if I can just hear the
[1:16:24] prophet say, "That's all I need, it'll
[1:16:26] kill you." Right.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; It'll kill you dead if you don't have
[1:16:30] the love of God in there.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; To know how to place that word and put
[1:16:33] it in its right position.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's a reason why we
[1:16:37] got so many dead churches.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; They care more about programs and
[1:16:45] everything else. The love of God is not
[1:16:47] there. Tell me, how in the world can
[1:16:49] message churches become so polluted with
[1:16:53] their own ways
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; until to them the only time somebody
[1:16:57] dances as if they're a wedding
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; or a birthday party
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; or some kind of a thing like that
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; or we get at a volleyball game and
[1:17:08] people will dance around. Woo! Look at
[1:17:09] you see that point I made and then come
[1:17:11] in church and set like a bunch of bumps
[1:17:12] on a pickle.
[1:17:15] [Music]
[1:17:16] The Bible said, "If the love of God is
[1:17:18] in you, you'll love not the things of
[1:17:20] the world." But if you love the world
[1:17:21] and the things that are in it, the love
[1:17:23] of God is not even in you. You can't
[1:17:24] have it both ways. It's one or the
[1:17:27] other.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, if their grandson kicked a soccer
[1:17:32] goal, they would run around the benches
[1:17:34] and slap somebody off their head and
[1:17:36] whoop bigger Yahoo and everything else
[1:17:38] in the world. But then you can come and
[1:17:40] preach the word of God under inspired
[1:17:42] preaching and not even claw their mouth
[1:17:44] open to get a pry their mouth open to
[1:17:46] even get an amen, hallelujah, and praise
[1:17:48] the Lord.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I won't say the love of God ain't there,
[1:17:52] but it's cooled off so cool it has no
[1:17:54] control over you anymore.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; You've allowed the world to blow and
[1:18:00] project this thing to you. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:02] Until you no longer have that real
[1:18:05] feeling.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I in this tonight I'm
[1:18:09] bringing these five points. The first
[1:18:11] one I'm working on now is this love
[1:18:13] lost. But now I want to talk for a
[1:18:15] little bit about love revealed. Now 1
[1:18:17] John chapter 4 verse 7 and 8. Amen. If
[1:18:21] you like to turn in your book, you can.
[1:18:22] But I'm going to put it right here for
[1:18:23] you. 1 John 4 and then 7 and 8. Now
[1:18:27] watch how John puts this. This is a
[1:18:30] beautiful way to express exactly what we
[1:18:33] should be right here in 2025.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Beloved, let us love one another.
[1:18:43] For love is of God.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; That's an easy thing to say amen to,
[1:18:52] isn't it? Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; But it's an entirely different thing
[1:18:56] alto together when brother or sister has
[1:19:01] offended you.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Woo! Praise the Lord.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Did you get that amen tape made up yet?
[1:19:10] I may need it.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Now, think about it. John commands us to
[1:19:17] love one another.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Not make excuses for one another,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; but love one another.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want us to overlook sin. He
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; doesn't want us to overlook wrong. If
[1:19:32] you see a brother overtaken in a fault,
[1:19:35] you who are spiritual, go to him.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; That's just scripture. I can't help it.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. But then when you've been
[1:19:45] hurt,
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; somebody done you wrong.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; You know the first instinct, don't you?
[1:19:53] Glory to God. I'm not going to that
[1:19:54] church no more. But they'll go to
[1:19:56] Walmart.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I've had plenty of those mean people say
[1:20:02] things to me at Walmart and hurt my
[1:20:03] feelings and I didn't do nothing to
[1:20:05] them.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; But I still go to Wally World whenever I
[1:20:09] need something.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Hello. Yes.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I went to that church and
[1:20:16] somebody offended me so deeply. And so
[1:20:19] we think to oursel, "Well, I want to get
[1:20:21] my kids out of that mess." We do them a
[1:20:24] great disservice
[1:20:26] by taking them from the very place where
[1:20:28] they could best learn to discern between
[1:20:31] right and wrong, good and evil.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; You're going to get offended in church.
[1:20:36] You're going to get your feelings hurt
[1:20:37] by people in church. There are going to
[1:20:39] be hypocrites, devils, liars, losers,
[1:20:41] and everything else in the world. You
[1:20:43] are going to cross paths with some of
[1:20:45] the worst of the worst. But you're also
[1:20:47] going to cross paths with some of the
[1:20:49] best of the best.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And for all categories of life, you've
[1:20:55] got to have enough love in your heart
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; to be able to overlook many of these
[1:21:00] things.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know how it goes. If people
[1:21:06] don't dance our tune,
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We don't want to dance with them
[1:21:09] no more.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Y'all come for revival.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; That's what we having.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to have good oldfashioned
[1:21:21] revival. Get this stuff out of our
[1:21:23] hearts.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Now, watch what John says. Everyone that
[1:21:27] loveth is
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; my goodness. So if I've got the Holy
[1:21:36] Ghost, this is an automatic part of my
[1:21:39] nature.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; My nature, if God is in there, my nature
[1:21:47] is to love.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; I don't have to work for it. I don't
[1:21:53] have to fight for it. I don't have to
[1:21:55] work it up and try to figure out how to
[1:21:56] get there. It's automatically a part of
[1:21:59] my nature.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; So if God is in there, I will
[1:22:07] automatically express love to you.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Then tell me where does all this
[1:22:14] foolishness come from? People sitting in
[1:22:16] pews next to each other that have
[1:22:17] absolutely had grudges against one
[1:22:19] another for 40 years.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; They wronged me in 1962. They wronged me
[1:22:26] in 1948.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; They need the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:33] They need to be born again.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz the love of God would give them a
[1:22:39] feeling. Well, maybe brother didn't mean
[1:22:41] it that way exactly. Or you might say,
[1:22:45] "That man absolutely meant that, but I'm
[1:22:48] going to forgive him."
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to have mercy on him.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Because I'm sure at some time in my
[1:22:54] life, I've done the same thing to Jesus.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Now, folks, if we want to go out of here
[1:23:05] in the rapture, the resurrection,
[1:23:08] there's only one pathway that takes us
[1:23:10] there. Perfect love.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; You don't think so? Go back and listen.
[1:23:15] Adoption. Listen at your prophet. When
[1:23:16] he said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, it'll
[1:23:19] take perfect love to put you in that
[1:23:21] place."
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't have it, you ain't
[1:23:25] never going to have it.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; It takes God to put you in a spot. Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; To where you can show this selfless
[1:23:33] sacrificial love. Amen. Not just a love
[1:23:38] that I agree with you when you agree,
[1:23:40] but a love that even when things are not
[1:23:42] so agreeable,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; I can continue believing and having
[1:23:47] faith and prayer, holding out hope.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Just go back and read the first couple
[1:23:53] chapters of Genesis.
[1:23:56] Do you are you aware or do you realize
[1:23:58] that God talked to Cain more than he
[1:24:01] ever did Adam or Abel in the first four
[1:24:03] chapters of Genesis?
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Had more conversations with Cain.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; You know why? All he had to do was tell
[1:24:10] Adam what he done wrong and set the law
[1:24:12] and the word out there. The day you eat,
[1:24:14] there's the day you die. He told Abel,
[1:24:17] revealed to Abel what the revelation
[1:24:18] was. We don't even know if that came by
[1:24:20] voice or just revelation.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; But the moment that he comes to Cain, do
[1:24:24] like your brother. Even after he messes
[1:24:26] up and God's going to put a mark on him,
[1:24:28] send him out. God's talking to him all
[1:24:29] over again. Don't you see why? That's
[1:24:32] what love does.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; It reaches out to those that are
[1:24:36] unreachable.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; It tries to touch those that are
[1:24:40] untouchable.
[1:24:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; It tries to go to the depths of the
[1:24:49] places that no one else wants to go.
[1:24:56] My goodness. He that loveth not knoweth
[1:25:01] not God,
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; for God is love.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:09] Now, let's look at uh a little statement
[1:25:12] here in divine love in 1957. He said,
[1:25:14] "Do you remember my sermon Sunday? The
[1:25:16] little mainspring in the middle of the
[1:25:19] watch times that watch to everything."
[1:25:22] He said, "When God is love and love, now
[1:25:25] watch this now. When God is love and
[1:25:28] love moves into our heart, it times
[1:25:32] every emotion,
[1:25:34] every right with God's Bible."
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; So the main spring of that watch places
[1:25:43] every synchrony in its proper order.
[1:25:49] The minute hand, the hour hand, the
[1:25:51] second hand,
[1:25:53] a device that sets off the alarm,
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; one that controls the dates and the
[1:25:58] calendars and the beeping and whatever
[1:26:00] else it can do.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; The mainspring is what controls and
[1:26:05] listen, not just controls it, but
[1:26:07] synchronizes all of it.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; So if we go to a church, Brother Jim,
[1:26:18] and the gifts are out of order,
[1:26:20] people's emotions are out of order,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; things are not operating in a in a in a
[1:26:27] in a a synchronization of the spirit.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; When the song leader leads singing, half
[1:26:32] the people aren't singing and
[1:26:34] threequarters of them are sleeping. And
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Then the pastor gets up and preach and
[1:26:39] he has to apologize 37 times cuz I don't
[1:26:41] know what's going on. Something's wrong.
[1:26:42] I
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; something seems to be so out of order.
[1:26:50] Wonder what that could be.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Wonder if the reason other things are
[1:26:56] not in sync, it's because the mainspring
[1:27:01] isn't operating like it needs to. Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; So the love of God controls everything
[1:27:11] else.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Y'all ready for this quote?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "If you had perfect love,
[1:27:17] you'd have perfect gifts."
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because love would control anything
[1:27:27] that gets in error.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't be deceived. If we ever
[1:27:32] try to move into the spirit of God to
[1:27:34] the place to where we start moving into
[1:27:35] gifts and supernatural things, you're
[1:27:38] going to have problems. You're going to
[1:27:39] have errors. You're going to miss the
[1:27:41] mark. You're going to say things that
[1:27:42] aren't that way and should be this way
[1:27:44] instead of that. You're going to have
[1:27:46] every bit of that.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. But if the love of God is
[1:27:50] present
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; in the church, in the leaders, and the
[1:27:54] person themsself,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; when the word tells them that they
[1:27:58] missed it,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; they're going to have something in them
[1:28:00] to say, "Oh, Jesus, Lord,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; please Lord, don't don't let me get in
[1:28:04] that shape. Don't let me get in that
[1:28:06] mile. Lord, I just want to be right.
[1:28:07] Lord, I just want to do. I want to be a
[1:28:09] blessing to the body. I want to be." But
[1:28:11] not this attitude of glory to God. I'm
[1:28:13] gifted. So is the devil.
[1:28:17] That's right.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Gifts don't make you saved. Gifts don't
[1:28:22] make you born again.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; I've met too many preachers in my
[1:28:25] lifetime that spend the majority of
[1:28:27] their life running around bragging about
[1:28:28] how gifted they are.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; In the eyes of God, a preacher ain't no
[1:28:33] more than a drunk that got saved 10
[1:28:34] minutes ago.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I'll help you. Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but you say they're preachers.
[1:28:48] I They are servants to the body of
[1:28:50] Christ.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And I'll agree. Those that rule well
[1:28:54] should be worth kind of worthy of double
[1:28:55] honor. That's true. But never should we
[1:28:57] ever look at a gift and that gift be
[1:29:00] equated or be equaled up to that man has
[1:29:03] the Holy Ghost. Just cuz he's gifted
[1:29:05] doesn't mean he's got the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of them standing behind the
[1:29:10] platform that's not even born again,
[1:29:11] much less how are they going to get you
[1:29:13] to born again when they ain't
[1:29:14] themselves.
[1:29:16] That's right.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; The little mainspring controls
[1:29:22] everything. Then says these words, "The
[1:29:25] world is sick and tired of looking at
[1:29:27] great big spires, fine dressed people,
[1:29:31] and a bunch of isms."
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; What they want to see is the genuine
[1:29:36] love of God
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; projected in the hearts of his people.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; That's what the world is looking for.
[1:29:43] The world is dying.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, let's go back to
[1:29:49] the uh 13th chapter of Corinthians
[1:29:51] again, but let's pick up the first three
[1:29:52] verses. Now, I want to move on to my
[1:29:55] next point tonight, which is love
[1:29:56] tested. Now, we've seen love. Amen. Uh
[1:30:01] lost. We're looking at love revealed to
[1:30:03] the human heart. Now, love tested. I'm
[1:30:06] kind of segmenting some of these things
[1:30:08] off into like a little point so you can
[1:30:10] keep it running in your mind. big big
[1:30:12] subject and I just want to kind of
[1:30:15] partition off if you will or section off
[1:30:17] these five main points. Now working on
[1:30:21] this third one here. 1 Corinthians 13
[1:30:24] 1-3. Love tested. Now though I speak
[1:30:27] with the tongues of men and angels and
[1:30:30] have not charity,
[1:30:33] I am become a sounding brass or a
[1:30:35] tinkling symbol.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And if I have not charity, Paul said, I
[1:30:40] have nothing.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the man that is saying
[1:30:46] this?
[1:30:51] This is the same man that said, "I speak
[1:30:53] in tongues more than y'all."
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Same man that wrote the Bible.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Many, many prophecies in those books.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Think about it now. Oh, but you he was
[1:31:19] Paul didn't say if I don't know that I'm
[1:31:23] a church age messenger, I have nothing.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; He even put his own gift in with this
[1:31:31] sir
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; cuz he said where there be knowledge
[1:31:35] it'll fail.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Tongues will cease. Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "I had to forget everything I
[1:31:42] ever knew and learned
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; to know Jesus Christ as my savior."
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; He put every gift, even his own.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; He put every calling, even his own.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; That if he didn't have charity, every
[1:31:58] bit of this would fail. Why? This is the
[1:32:00] main spring. This is the main spring
[1:32:02] that controls everything else. If Paul
[1:32:05] wouldn't have had this, he would have
[1:32:07] never been the Paul that we know.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on, somebody.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, we'll never
[1:32:15] be the bride that Jesus wants to show.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; My So he uses this love, this Greek word
[1:32:25] Philadelphia, which is brotherly love,
[1:32:26] affectionate love. And then again the
[1:32:29] fellowship love or the sharing or
[1:32:32] participation love. The gifts that
[1:32:35] operate are operated for the sake of
[1:32:38] participation.
[1:32:40] Remember that church is not a spectator
[1:32:44] sport.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; I I know I've told you this a 100 times,
[1:32:49] but I'm going to say it again. God
[1:32:50] didn't expect you to come to church and
[1:32:52] just sit and spectate.
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:56] He wants you to participate,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; which means everyone has a role to play.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Right? God's not just the God of the
[1:33:05] pullpit up here. He's the God of the
[1:33:06] audience out there as well.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; The pastor or the evangelist or teacher,
[1:33:11] apostle, prophet is not the only one
[1:33:13] that can go out and pray for the sick.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; That's just the only one many people
[1:33:18] accept.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; You know why they do that? Not because
[1:33:22] they have real love, they have respect
[1:33:24] of persons.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; But if I'm sick and you're born again, I
[1:33:35] don't care if you're just a housewife. I
[1:33:37] want you praying for me.
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; If you're a child and God has moved on
[1:33:46] your faith and you've got faith, I want
[1:33:48] you praying for me. That's right. Yeah.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; I don't need just some preacher to come
[1:33:51] lay his hands on me. I don't need just
[1:33:53] some great man of God. That's respect of
[1:33:57] persons.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "But if brother Brandham
[1:34:03] was here,
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; well, let's just see if that check will
[1:34:06] cash, can we?"
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said many, many times,
[1:34:10] I'll give you one and you can go do the
[1:34:12] homework yourself. But he said, "Brother
[1:34:15] Bram, is it true that only you should be
[1:34:17] preaching and nobody else should
[1:34:18] preach?"
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Mercy, brother, no mercy. Where did you
[1:34:23] hear that?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; I never said that. Why? I'm just a
[1:34:29] little pebble on the beach.
[1:34:35] You see, cuz brother Bradom wasn't
[1:34:37] overwhelmed and and and and and so
[1:34:40] plumbed to the bone with this respect to
[1:34:42] person stuff like we see today,
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; you know, cuz the way some people are,
[1:34:46] brother Joseph Ran, I'm believe he was
[1:34:48] still here, Rebecca or Smith, George or
[1:34:50] somebody come walking through here,
[1:34:52] people would sit in the pew go, "Oh, oh
[1:34:54] my, oh my, the prophet's family. Oh my,
[1:34:57] so anointed." No more anointed than I am
[1:34:59] in a pull pit tonight. Amen.
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; If some great visible preacher in the
[1:35:06] message come walking in here and sat on
[1:35:08] the back pew, many of you could barely
[1:35:09] even follow a half of what I'm saying.
[1:35:11] For one, wonder what that brother's
[1:35:13] doing.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And many will listen to see what he's
[1:35:16] amening to see whether they can amen or
[1:35:18] not.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; I've seen it many times, brother D. Some
[1:35:24] pastor sitting on the platform like this
[1:35:26] and I start preaching something he don't
[1:35:28] exactly agree with. Man, I'm in
[1:35:29] territory I don't even know I'm in, but
[1:35:32] I'm there. And the people know it, too.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz all of a sudden, he gets that look
[1:35:36] on his face.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And somehow another the amen start dying
[1:35:42] down.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Respect of persons.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; When you don't have the love of God,
[1:35:48] this is what starts infiltrating our
[1:35:50] churches.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; My my my. So we have to test this love
[1:35:56] to make sure that it lines up with the
[1:35:59] word. Now listen to this. Brother said
[1:36:00] why some people can't keep the victory.
[1:36:02] He said the love of God, God is love.
[1:36:04] And unless each one of these gifts is
[1:36:07] put right in the center of love,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; it becomes selfish and indifferent.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Now listen what happens when love is
[1:36:18] missing. It pulls itself off,
[1:36:22] isolates itself
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; and fuss and stew.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; I hesitate to say what I'm getting ready
[1:36:35] to say
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; because I'm getting ready to talk about
[1:36:39] a man we all know and loved.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; He's gone now.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; But at the end of this man's ministry,
[1:36:45] this is what started happening right
[1:36:47] here.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Before he went on, I was the only
[1:36:52] approved evangelist in the country.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And there was only one other pastor that
[1:36:56] had thus sayeth the Lord. All the rest
[1:36:58] of them were wrong.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; I don't put people in hell for things
[1:37:02] like that. But this is what brother
[1:37:04] Brandham said. When the love of God
[1:37:06] starts leaving you,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; when love cools down, this is what
[1:37:10] happens.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Watch that amongst people in the
[1:37:12] churches. When that love starts dying
[1:37:14] down for truth and for fellowship and
[1:37:16] brotherhood, they start getting nitpicky
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; and then the sisters are watching to see
[1:37:22] what kind of dress that girl walked to
[1:37:23] the church with. And oh my god, I can't
[1:37:25] believe. And tell everybody on the way
[1:37:26] home, I can't believe that sister wore
[1:37:28] that dress. Well, mercy, what in the
[1:37:30] world does it matter? That thing's so
[1:37:31] tight she can't move without sinning.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; What was worse, the dress or your
[1:37:36] stinking rotten loveless attitude?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. words. Amen. In case you
[1:37:43] forgot,
[1:37:45] I don't mean to keep reminding you, but
[1:37:47] it keep seem like you keep forgetting it
[1:37:48] somehow.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; The attitude changes in a person like
[1:37:52] that. They go from being loving and
[1:37:54] accepting, opening their arms and
[1:37:56] opening up the borders and skirts of
[1:37:58] mercy
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; to start becoming nitpicky as hard as
[1:38:02] they can nitpick everything they
[1:38:03] nitpick. I don't like this and I don't
[1:38:04] like that. The Bible said don't sit in
[1:38:06] the seat of the scornful. But if the
[1:38:09] love of God is missing out of that
[1:38:10] heart, that's exactly what you'll end up
[1:38:12] doing. Sitting in the seat of the
[1:38:14] scornful
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; cuz we don't always get things like we
[1:38:19] wanted.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Like take for example sitting in a
[1:38:21] little local church. It's hard for some
[1:38:24] people to uh to to open their heart to a
[1:38:27] revival in a local church. But but make
[1:38:29] no mistake, the best revival we can ever
[1:38:32] have is a local revival. Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; The church still holds the power of
[1:38:37] having a local revival.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; But if we get cold indifference,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; somebody says, "Well, you know what? If
[1:38:45] I was to say to you, let's call a prayer
[1:38:46] meeting tonight and stay all night long
[1:38:48] and pray,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Already your minds go to a place.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got this thing and that thing
[1:38:56] and this is arranged and we got to be
[1:38:57] back to do this and
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that it's always
[1:39:01] expedient. I'm not saying that it's
[1:39:03] always the right way to do things, but
[1:39:06] with the love of God in our hearts,
[1:39:08] something should be inside us to say,
[1:39:12] "Perhaps maybe I could put that off and
[1:39:15] maybe make that prayer meeting if the
[1:39:17] Lord wants me there."
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not saying that we'll instantly
[1:39:20] be agreeable, but there'll be an
[1:39:22] agreeable spirit within us.
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; God help me this right. That's the
[1:39:31] reason why when you go to the desert,
[1:39:34] you see that old sticker on the side of
[1:39:36] the cactus. There's no there's no water
[1:39:37] in it.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason people get so
[1:39:41] sticky in church.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; There's no love in them.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:49] You take some person coming to church,
[1:39:50] some girl standing there, she got
[1:39:52] toenail paint on or uh you know, her
[1:39:54] hair is trimmed on the bottom or some
[1:39:56] little thing, dressed shorter than it
[1:39:58] should be, you know, and tape message
[1:40:01] people how they behave when they see
[1:40:03] things like that.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Instantly the word becomes a weapon.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; But you see, you don't know that
[1:40:12] person's backstory.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. And you don't know how
[1:40:16] many devils laid how many traps and
[1:40:19] they're succeeding in taking that
[1:40:21] precious soul and binding it up full of
[1:40:23] complexes and fears and anger and
[1:40:26] bitterness and everything else in the
[1:40:28] world. And if we as the people of God
[1:40:31] continue to weaponize the word,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; they'll never get saved
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; nor delivered. That's right.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; And the minute they take a look at your
[1:40:41] attitude toward them,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; they're going to walk right straight out
[1:40:44] the church.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; And yet the statement is still true. The
[1:40:49] world is dying for love.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; They need it.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; And they need to see it out of us.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Instead of pulling out a list of quotes,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; how about just good oldfashioned
[1:41:05] friendship?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That's good preaching,
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen to it again.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Let me make sure I refresh your mind on
[1:41:15] this. He said, "That's right. Without
[1:41:17] these gifts in the center of love, it'll
[1:41:19] become selfish and indifferent."
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; "Pull itself off, isolate itself, fue.
[1:41:32] But when it's anchored in the middle of
[1:41:34] love,
[1:41:35] it'll be fellowship everywhere.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's exactly what we
[1:41:43] need. The church is dying for love,
[1:41:46] brother.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on to my fourth point.
[1:41:48] Love working. Now, Romans chapter 5:E 5.
[1:41:52] If you got your Bible, I want you to
[1:41:53] look at this with me. Romans 5 and5. Now
[1:41:57] the Bible said, "And hope maketh not
[1:42:00] ashamed because
[1:42:02] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[1:42:06] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:42:09] to us." Now this word he uses here is
[1:42:11] deep compassion.
[1:42:14] You see true love moves from the heart
[1:42:17] but compassion is doing the will of God.
[1:42:21] So some people think that love and
[1:42:23] compassion is just making excuses for
[1:42:25] everything.
[1:42:26] But love is corrective
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; and true love wants to correct
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; correctly
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; not so they get up there and say why
[1:42:40] prophet said and one thing and the Bible
[1:42:42] said and I mean it
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; but true love of God wants to approach
[1:42:47] the people with such a spirit such a
[1:42:49] feeling do yourself a favor if you think
[1:42:52] that I'm being hard on you tonight which
[1:42:53] I can tell some of you think I am when
[1:42:56] You go home tonight or tomorrow,
[1:42:57] whenever you get a chance to, go listen
[1:42:59] at it. 11762.
[1:43:01] Presuming Brother Brham has tore the
[1:43:04] hide off these people for 1 hour and 35
[1:43:06] minutes. The hardest preaching you've
[1:43:08] ever heard in your life. And he is
[1:43:10] slamming the women for their hair and
[1:43:11] slamming the men for their attitude and
[1:43:13] slamming the church for getting cold. He
[1:43:15] is nailing them to the wall.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; He gets so hard it almost grieve you.
[1:43:25] But then at the very end of the service,
[1:43:26] he's praying and I know how he feels cuz
[1:43:29] I've been there many times. He said,
[1:43:31] "Father, it's so hard to cut and slay
[1:43:34] and whip and beat and things." He said,
[1:43:35] "You don't want to do that to the
[1:43:37] people." He said, "But they've got to
[1:43:39] see what's right."
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And the prophet knew that little church
[1:43:42] was beginning to backslide.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; He went in there with the love of God.
[1:43:46] And if you go listen at the end of it,
[1:43:48] person after person's up there praying,
[1:43:49] you can hear men crying out to God and
[1:43:51] different things like that.
[1:43:54] You see, the love of God corrects
[1:43:56] correctly.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; It don't just come in and just slap
[1:43:59] everybody in the head and say,
[1:44:00] "Straighten up." The love of God brings
[1:44:02] instruction.
[1:44:04] It brings a conviction. The compassion
[1:44:07] of doing the will of God brings that
[1:44:09] feeling where the Bible said like this
[1:44:10] that the godly sorrow in the heart works
[1:44:14] repentance.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:21] It is this kind of love that touches the
[1:44:23] untouchable
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; and heals the unhealable
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; and it'll go farther than any gift.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz some people got that attitude in
[1:44:35] their mind. Glory to God. All they got
[1:44:37] to do is get in church and be preached,
[1:44:38] too.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; But when they go to church and hear
[1:44:42] preaching, what do they see after the
[1:44:45] preaching? Come on.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Many times bunch of arrogant people
[1:44:50] walking around. Glory to God. We're in
[1:44:51] the message. Hallelujah.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; They're so holy with their nose in the
[1:44:56] air. If it if it rained, it'd drown
[1:44:57] them.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Yet they claim they've got the love of
[1:45:03] God.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Great commission. The leper passed by
[1:45:11] with no arm and he said I took him in my
[1:45:14] arms and began to love him. He said the
[1:45:17] people said now brother Brandham don't
[1:45:18] you do that.
[1:45:22] He said but the world is dying for love
[1:45:24] brothers.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; He said he just wept when he saw
[1:45:28] somebody that cared.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; He said now you take your brother in
[1:45:35] your arms. Yeah.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; If doesn't make things a little
[1:45:39] different, he said the love that worked
[1:45:41] on that leper will also work on your
[1:45:43] brother that you think
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; is wrong.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; We talk about divine healing as
[1:45:51] believers.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; But we talk about it from the aspect of
[1:45:55] someone, some great preacher again
[1:45:57] laying hands on somebody and somebody
[1:45:58] with great faith believing, "Oh my," and
[1:46:00] we testify, "Brother so and so prayed
[1:46:02] and glory to God." But do you realize
[1:46:04] the prophet of God said that God can
[1:46:07] heal an old grudge
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; with just a little bit of love?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; You see Jesus,
[1:46:16] my flesh brother, my brother, called me
[1:46:18] today and he was telling me something
[1:46:19] the Lord had laid on his heart.
[1:46:22] Isaiah 53, he was wounded for our
[1:46:24] transgression. So forth and so on. He
[1:46:26] said, did you notice this? He said, he
[1:46:29] said, he was wounded.
[1:46:31] The chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:46:33] him for grief and sorrows.
[1:46:37] He said, "Did you notice those have
[1:46:39] nothing to do with eternal life?"
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; I thought that was pretty good.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's right. That's temporary
[1:46:47] in this day."
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; But someone with eternal life can become
[1:46:51] wounded,
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; can grieve and have sorrows,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; and they want healing from almighty God.
[1:46:57] Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; And so they might have a little thing in
[1:47:00] their heart and they hold on to
[1:47:01] something. Hold on to something. Then
[1:47:02] all of a sudden they come to the prayer
[1:47:03] line and they pray out, "Oh God, oh God,
[1:47:06] I need deliverance." And then God will
[1:47:07] move and they'll scream and they'll run
[1:47:09] and they'll jump and they'll do all
[1:47:10] kinds of things.
[1:47:12] But really what they need is healing.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And sometimes just a little old bit of
[1:47:18] love.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Will heal a broken heart.
[1:47:26] Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all thought I was going to
[1:47:30] preach this way tonight. You wouldn't
[1:47:31] have come, would you?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Holy cow. There's a whole lot I could
[1:47:38] have streamed somebody better than this.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't hide it. I can tell by
[1:47:44] seeing the looks on some of y'all's
[1:47:45] faces. This is burning some of you up.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Really good.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; But it's good. Good.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; You know why it's good? Because God
[1:47:55] wants us to be right with him.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Tell me I don't have I'm telling you
[1:48:02] what the Lord said in his word.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Now, if it fits you, it fits you. If it
[1:48:06] don't, it don't. That's up to you.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; The world. Now, think brother sees this
[1:48:15] leper come along
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; and he hugs him.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. I heard a brother saying
[1:48:20] just the other day, he was in uh Africa,
[1:48:22] I think it was, or one of those places,
[1:48:24] and said, "Somebody had this real awful
[1:48:26] disease." And they'd warned him. Now,
[1:48:28] brother, you stay away from this woman
[1:48:29] now. She's real sick, and don't you get
[1:48:31] around her. She's real sick and on like
[1:48:33] that. And so, he said, the Holy Ghost
[1:48:35] had talked to him said the Lord was
[1:48:37] going to heal her. He said, I just
[1:48:38] pushed past the whole crowd and went up
[1:48:40] there and he said, I just put my arm
[1:48:42] around her like that and said, "Now,
[1:48:43] sister, God wants to heal you in the
[1:48:45] name of Jesus Christ." And prayed for
[1:48:46] her.
[1:48:48] them brothers were almost falling in the
[1:48:50] floor. Oh God, he's got that disease.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; God turned around and healed that woman.
[1:48:55] Why? Just a little bit of love.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I I don't mean like he put his arm
[1:49:04] around her ungodly like he reached
[1:49:06] around like this to pray for cuz she's
[1:49:07] sitting in a wheelchair.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the very fact that he wasn't
[1:49:11] tainted or or or you know or marred or
[1:49:15] scarred by her being there,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; just a little love
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; cause her to reach out and get a hold of
[1:49:20] divine healing.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; I'm about to say something to you. I
[1:49:29] hope you're ready.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; How many spiritual lepers
[1:49:34] have we turned a blind eye to and walked
[1:49:36] beyond?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. world
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; because they were missing certain
[1:49:42] things.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe they missed the right attitude.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; You know, dealing with family can be
[1:49:48] like that sometimes. You get amongst
[1:49:49] your own people and they got a rotten
[1:49:52] attitude and we almost want to cast them
[1:49:54] over to the devil. I rebuke you in the
[1:49:55] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet of God said
[1:49:59] about a man woman that's in a fuss and a
[1:50:01] woman gets a little bad spirit on her?
[1:50:03] You know what brother said? Do go get
[1:50:05] her flowers and candy. Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Not me, brother. I'm going to put my
[1:50:14] foot down and you'll do it for your last
[1:50:16] time one day.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz any woman worth her weight and salt
[1:50:20] ain't going to put up with no Hitler
[1:50:21] like that.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good preacher.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; There's many of our sisters gone and
[1:50:28] their bodies are still there.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Their marriage is over, but they're
[1:50:33] still in the house.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Why? the lack of love amongst the
[1:50:38] people.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Some of our big herculean men, some of
[1:50:43] our big strong men, some of you men
[1:50:45] wouldn't cry or you wouldn't tell
[1:50:46] somebody you loved him or you cared for
[1:50:48] them because that would make you less
[1:50:50] than a man. What makes you less than a
[1:50:52] man in the eyes of God is that you will
[1:50:54] not express love to those he gave to you
[1:50:58] expressively to love.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Can y'all hand a little bit more?
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; First John chapter 4 verse 18 and 19. I
[1:51:16] didn't realize this was going to get so
[1:51:17] tough tonight, but here we are.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; I was convinced this is going to be one
[1:51:21] of them sugar sticks and candy canes and
[1:51:23] lollipop messages, but holy smokes, here
[1:51:26] we are.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Woo! Preach Jesus. I'll say amen.
[1:51:32] 1 John 4 18 and 19. Now watch what John
[1:51:35] says. There is no fear in love.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Why do we fear?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Because somewhere along the way we just
[1:51:52] don't have the kind of confidence in God
[1:51:55] that we need. or somewhere our
[1:51:58] revelation of how he loves us is missing
[1:52:01] somewhere.
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Now, think of a time that you thought
[1:52:08] God should have blessed you,
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; but he held it from you.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; How did you react to that?
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; What was your attitude whenever you
[1:52:19] thought God should give you this certain
[1:52:21] job promotion, but then pulled your
[1:52:23] candlestick?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:26] or wouldn't allow you to go up in
[1:52:27] management or wouldn't allow you to make
[1:52:29] that extra so much dollars.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; How did you react when you felt like the
[1:52:35] Lord took it from you?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Or maybe some of you dealing and
[1:52:41] battling with a long time sickness
[1:52:45] and deep in your heart you start
[1:52:47] wondering, "Does God even care if I'm
[1:52:48] well?"
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:52:54] So, you know what happens, don't you?
[1:52:56] All of these things begin to cycle in
[1:52:58] our minds.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; And because
[1:53:02] we're just not sure what the will of God
[1:53:04] is about certain matters cuz he don't
[1:53:06] always tell us, you know.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Then we start questioning and those
[1:53:13] questions and doubts bring fear.
[1:53:18] will
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I just went through something here
[1:53:20] myself just earlier this week where I
[1:53:22] had a a situation some years ago that
[1:53:25] was just a very traumatic it was awful
[1:53:28] awful awful awful it's almost like a uh
[1:53:30] there was a a repeat scenario this week
[1:53:32] of a certain thing and it was almost
[1:53:34] like PTSD
[1:53:35] you know like the the soldiers that get
[1:53:37] that what brother used to call shell
[1:53:39] shocked
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; and I was hyperventilating oh God
[1:53:44] the Lord just said to me settle down.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; It's not the same.
[1:53:49] [Laughter]
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; But fear
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; because there's a a gap in our
[1:53:56] understanding
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; where we don't know between what
[1:54:00] happened and what's going to happen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; That little empty place in between. Oh,
[1:54:06] and that's where the devil likes to work
[1:54:08] on you the most.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Yay. Hath God said?
[1:54:14] Yeah.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And before you know it, he's planted a
[1:54:17] bunch of doubts and fears and everything
[1:54:19] else in your heart, and you're wondering
[1:54:21] if God can even hear your prayer.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; But you know what fixes that? Love.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Staying in love with Jesus.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Staying in love with him to the point of
[1:54:38] saying, "God, I don't care what you put
[1:54:39] in my pathway. I don't care what
[1:54:41] hardship comes my way. I don't care if
[1:54:43] I'm sick every day of my life. I don't
[1:54:45] care if I struggle and I ain't got
[1:54:46] enough loonies to rub together for a
[1:54:48] hamburger.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; I know he loves me.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; I love him and I know he will take care
[1:54:57] of me.
[1:54:58] [Applause]
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; If we keep that kind of spirit in our
[1:55:04] heart, what does it do? What does it do?
[1:55:08] Cast out fear.
[1:55:13] [Applause]
[1:55:17] Hallelujah.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Because you see he that because fear he
[1:55:23] says hath torment. He that fearth is not
[1:55:27] made perfect in love. That word perfect
[1:55:29] is mature, complete, mature.
[1:55:32] We love him because he first loved us.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; So a love that has reached full maturity
[1:55:39] will drive out all fear. Right?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Because when the agape love of God
[1:55:46] moves into the bride of Christ, the fear
[1:55:48] of death,
[1:55:50] the fear of retribution, ah, that's a
[1:55:52] big one,
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I I'll say it like this. There's many of
[1:55:58] us, okay, me too,
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; that have got a laundry list of things
[1:56:02] in our past that we knew were stupid
[1:56:04] when we did them.
[1:56:08] Amen.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; We remember them.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; We know they're there.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Can still see the same hands that done
[1:56:16] it, the same mouth that said it, the
[1:56:18] same eyes that looked at it, the same
[1:56:19] ears that heard it, and the same feet
[1:56:21] that went to it.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; And then you come to church and you're
[1:56:25] going, "I'm so glad Jesus set me free.
[1:56:31] I'm so And the devil says, are you?"
[1:56:37] It could be something as simple as
[1:56:38] remember that scar on your arm,
[1:56:41] that little remember all them years you
[1:56:43] smoked,
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; that little pain in your hip, remember
[1:56:47] when you was drunk and done such and
[1:56:49] such.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; And while you're sitting in the house of
[1:56:53] God, Satan is working right here,
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Trying to bring every accusation, trying
[1:56:58] to point your mind into that direction.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Of what if?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; You know the reason that God ain't
[1:57:05] healed you, the reason that God ain't
[1:57:06] touched you, you know the reason you
[1:57:08] ain't no better. God is getting even
[1:57:10] with you.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; But the love of God
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; takes that liar and says that is not the
[1:57:21] way my Lord treats me. Amen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; If he corrects me, he's not correcting
[1:57:27] me because I'm some unruly thing that he
[1:57:29] likes taking pleasure and beating on and
[1:57:32] and making playing some trick on me or
[1:57:34] or some kind of a stunt on me. If if he
[1:57:37] corrects me, it's because I need it.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Not because I deserve it.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; There's a difference.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] God puts upon us what we need,
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; not what we deserve.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; If I got what I deserved,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; if you got what you deserve, you
[1:58:09] wouldn't even be sitting here tonight.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; But the grace and the love of Almighty
[1:58:15] God doesn't give me what I deserve.
[1:58:18] Brother Dell, he gives me what I need.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:25] [Applause]
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; If I got what I deserved every time I
[1:58:29] deserved it, I would be a little greasy
[1:58:31] spot right down here.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Not what I deserve,
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; but what I need.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; You see, the love of God frames it.
[1:58:42] Brother Derson said, he puts it in my
[1:58:43] heart in the right way. I know
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; that he's dealing with me as God dealeth
[1:58:48] with sons.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz God knows if I had to reap out every
[1:58:56] crop I ever sowed,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; but for the grace of God, it would send
[1:59:01] me away from the Lord, not to him.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Let me go just a little bit further.
[1:59:09] Okay. Amen.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; 1960. It wasn't so from the beginning.
[1:59:14] Love casts out fear, doesn't it,
[1:59:16] friends?
[1:59:18] The whole world is dying for love.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; That's one of the great things that we
[1:59:25] leave out of our Pentecostal blessing.
[1:59:28] Too much of it is love that mixes it
[1:59:33] together. Listen to this statement. The
[1:59:35] mortar that makes gifts and all the
[1:59:38] things operate of God perfectly in is
[1:59:41] love one for another.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; So it' be like if I walked out here and
[1:59:46] some of you that frame and do
[1:59:47] construction things, I put a bunch of
[1:59:48] blocks together and a bunch of wood and
[1:59:50] stuck them together, but I had no
[1:59:51] adhesive.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; I had no fasteners.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; I had no way to tie it together.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; First wind or storm or whatever,
[1:59:58] somebody bumped into it, over it would
[2:00:00] go.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; We've done that for 60 years now. We've
[2:00:04] built up our quotes. We built up our
[2:00:06] scriptures. We put our doctrinal points.
[2:00:08] We put our revelations, our
[2:00:09] understanding, and we framed it all
[2:00:11] together until it's this big, beautiful
[2:00:13] building.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden, here comes the big
[2:00:16] bad devil.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; And the first trial he brings through
[2:00:21] the church, he huffs and he puffs and
[2:00:23] blows our house down.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Why? We've got all the right material,
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; but the love of God is the one that ties
[2:00:34] all of that.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Think about this a minute.
[2:00:50] of all the things
[2:00:52] that we've been taught in this message,
[2:00:55] everything that we know in the Bible,
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; we could sit for days and discuss things
[2:01:04] that we've learned since we've been
[2:01:06] Christians.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; So, what are most churches focused on?
[2:01:19] Yeah.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Church order,
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; seals,
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; the thunders,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; the revelations of God,
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; all of that is wonderful.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; But if there's no love there,
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to hold it together.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; So, you have God saying certain things
[2:01:44] that will leave you completely without
[2:01:46] understanding. Right. Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; For example, take this day. I just went
[2:01:51] through the Parkview Junior High School
[2:01:53] series where Bram starts at the
[2:01:54] tabernacle with man running from the
[2:01:55] presence. And then uh he goes into um um
[2:02:01] the bonds woman can't be uh heir. The
[2:02:03] seed not with the shuck I think was the
[2:02:05] name of it. He goes on to Melzdc later
[2:02:08] after marriage and divorce. And as he's
[2:02:09] building up, you can tell from man
[2:02:11] running from the presence of the Lord
[2:02:12] that brother Rama is trying to build the
[2:02:13] confidence to go do what God's telling
[2:02:15] him to do.
[2:02:17] go back into the 50s and read the book
[2:02:20] where he said in the conduct, order and
[2:02:22] doctrine, he said, "If I was to take
[2:02:24] this Bible and preach marriage and
[2:02:26] divorce, it split up every church
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; in the country."
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Could he have taken the book and thrown
[2:02:34] the book at these people for the way
[2:02:35] they were living
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; and the way they were doing and how they
[2:02:38] were married? You better believe he
[2:02:40] could have.
[2:02:44] Yeah.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; But for 15 years,
[2:02:49] something, Listen close,
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; don't miss this. Don't fail this.
[2:02:53] for 15 years. Something constrained him
[2:02:56] and held him
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; until one day he was out in Arizona, a
[2:03:00] little place called Fanger Rock, and the
[2:03:01] Holy Ghost came down and told him
[2:03:03] because of misinterpreted theology,
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; but go back and tell him, "Go in as you
[2:03:11] are,
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; and teach your children not to do that
[2:03:14] thing again."
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; What was it that held him
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; from weaponizing the word?
[2:03:24] God in his love saw that many of his
[2:03:27] children had been told wrong.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; And their honest hearts and their true
[2:03:32] genuine faith was latching on to what
[2:03:35] was preached to them by people they
[2:03:37] thought were God's servants and God's
[2:03:39] children.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; And instead of brother Brand weaponizing
[2:03:44] the word,
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; you see what a difference it makes when
[2:03:48] love's there.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a quotation. That's
[2:03:51] what's the matter with the churches
[2:03:52] today. These rickies and
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; ricketettas.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; It only took brother Brandham somewhere
[2:03:57] around the period of a year before he
[2:04:00] started saying how the Lord spoke to him
[2:04:02] and said some of those are God's
[2:04:04] children.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Well, why didn't brother just go on with
[2:04:10] his attitude? Glory to God. I'm the
[2:04:12] prophet of God. They're wrong. The Bible
[2:04:15] said they're wrong.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell them about it.
[2:04:20] What changed him?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; God's love.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; God's love in him. Because you can't
[2:04:26] give them a right, proper chance if
[2:04:29] you've already taken their final
[2:04:31] outworking into your hands.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Calling them Ricky and Ricada made many
[2:04:35] of those people feel like there was no
[2:04:36] chance for them.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; That's why God dealt with him
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; so that he could spread the skirts of
[2:04:42] mercy.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; To give him a chance.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:49] Love is what done that.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; You go home with me and I go home with
[2:04:58] you. By the end of the day, you can pull
[2:05:00] the book on me and I can pull the book
[2:05:01] on you.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; But what keeps us from harboring
[2:05:05] feelings and things against one another?
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; God's love. Amen.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; God's love to say mercy of God will not
[2:05:14] allow me
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; to hold a sin against my brother
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; and if he's overtaken in it. See the
[2:05:21] Bible didn't say if you see sin go tell
[2:05:23] him about it. The Bible said if he's
[2:05:24] overtaken in it
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; cuz all of us are going to have sin in
[2:05:29] some point.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Three eye blings, two head nods, one
[2:05:34] grunt. I heard somebody clear the throat
[2:05:36] a minute ago.
[2:05:38] Let's try it again. I'm I'm hoping
[2:05:40] you'll do a little bit better this time,
[2:05:41] but all of us are going to have sin at
[2:05:44] some point.
[2:05:49] [Music]
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Bible said, "He that's born
[2:05:53] again does not commit sin." Same man
[2:05:55] turned right around and said, "And he
[2:05:56] that says he has no sin's a liar."
[2:06:00] [Applause]
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:04] So, sure,
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; we could throw the book at one another
[2:06:08] right now,
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; but the love of God in my heart for you
[2:06:12] and the love of God in your heart for me
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; will not allow you to see wrong in me.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you won't see the mistakes,
[2:06:23] the errors. Maybe brother Ben needs to
[2:06:25] do something better. I get that. I get
[2:06:26] that.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; But love will cause you to reserve and
[2:06:30] hold your opinion.
[2:06:34] and pray for me
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; and hold me up before the Lord and then
[2:06:38] if you see me overtaken in something
[2:06:40] love will cause you to say brother Ben
[2:06:42] can I please talk to you just a minute I
[2:06:44] I think I can help you with something
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; right
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; I I I always love the guys for me it's
[2:06:50] the guys believe me when I tell you
[2:06:51] women try it too but I'm glad it's the
[2:06:53] men
[2:06:56] I love it when they come up to me and
[2:06:57] say I want to correct you on something
[2:07:02] I know already right there. Uh-uh. No,
[2:07:04] sir. Uh-uh. We ain't talking. No. Forget
[2:07:07] it. Forget it. Forget it.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; When you see arrogance,
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; you ain't going to help me when you're
[2:07:15] arrogant.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; But when you come to me and you've got
[2:07:19] love in your heart,
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; brother, I want to share something with
[2:07:22] you. The Lord let me see something that
[2:07:25] I I hope maybe I might be wrong
[2:07:27] possibly, but I I want to talk to you
[2:07:29] about it in case maybe Satan's trying to
[2:07:31] do. I just want to be a friend to you.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; That's when you know
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; that the love of God is moving in
[2:07:38] somebody's heart.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; We should correct our children that way,
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; our grandchildren that way.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; We should correct the big kids that way.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; The little kids that way. Yeah.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; If we had more of that, this is what
[2:07:54] Jesus said. I'm closing right here. By
[2:07:57] this shall all men know that you are my
[2:08:00] disciples.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Is that you have love one?
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Stand with me.
[2:08:17] This is what I call the true mark of the
[2:08:19] bride.
[2:08:21] Not perfection and knowledge, not
[2:08:23] eloquence, not gifts, but love.
[2:08:27] Love is the very nature of Christ in his
[2:08:30] people.
[2:08:32] And I've got a little note down here
[2:08:34] like this.
[2:08:35] When divine love returns to the church,
[2:08:37] not emotionalism, not just tolerance,
[2:08:41] but when God's holy love is born of the
[2:08:43] Holy Spirit in their hearts, the world
[2:08:46] will know that Jesus Christ is still
[2:08:48] alive in his bride.
[2:08:52] And if the world is dying for love,
[2:08:57] let that love be found in you tonight.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Let it be found in your home.
[2:09:06] Let it be felt in every handshake.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Let it be seen in your forgiveness and
[2:09:11] your compassion. Because as brother Ram
[2:09:13] said here, the main spring of love
[2:09:16] operates everything else.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; This is not just a theory we live by.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; This is the life of God inside the heart
[2:09:24] of the elect.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; You see, friends, you may not understand
[2:09:29] maybe some of this hard preaching, and
[2:09:30] you don't understand me kind of knocking
[2:09:32] at it. There's a majority of you here
[2:09:34] that are 100% on board with me, but you
[2:09:36] think I can't feel that thing kicking
[2:09:38] against me while I'm up here under this
[2:09:39] anointing.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Why do you think I'm I'm dealing with
[2:09:43] you the way I'm dealing with you? Why
[2:09:44] you think I'm preaching the way I'm
[2:09:45] preaching? Not to be hateful, but
[2:09:47] because the devil hates this.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; He knows that if the true church ever
[2:09:53] gets a true revelation and how he works
[2:09:55] in the framework of the church, that
[2:09:57] she'll be an invincible army. That's
[2:09:59] right.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; And one of the first things that Satan
[2:10:04] tries to take from the people
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; is fellowship.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Go back and listen to a little message
[2:10:13] called restoration of the bride tree.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; He said that when that palmer worm, that
[2:10:18] was the first one, I think, wasn't it?
[2:10:19] The palmer worm comes and started eating
[2:10:21] at the tree, you know, he said first
[2:10:22] thing he hit the leaves.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; He said what those leaves represent?
[2:10:26] Fellowship among the brethren. Yeah.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Isolate. Pull them off to the side.
[2:10:32] We're the only ones that's they're not
[2:10:34] right. We're right.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; How is it, friends, that brother
[2:10:40] Brandham to the very end of his life
[2:10:43] when people would draw him out,
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; would take his gospel pencil and draw
[2:10:47] them back in.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; And yet we get all the way here 60 years
[2:10:51] later when we're supposed to be mature
[2:10:53] with this word
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; and pencil. We've done thrown it in the
[2:10:57] in the pencil case and stuck it under
[2:10:59] the
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; school desk many years ago. We don't
[2:11:01] draw no more. We don't pencil no more.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; We've decided we've got our own little
[2:11:06] circles and that's what we're going to
[2:11:08] run in.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; A pastor uh had left a certain church
[2:11:14] here some time ago and I was meeting
[2:11:16] with some of the officers and they were
[2:11:18] asking me questions and one brother
[2:11:19] said, "All I want to see is the clicks
[2:11:21] and things busted up amongst the
[2:11:23] churches." That's right.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Real fellowship. I said it has to start
[2:11:27] at the top.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; How in the world could we even have the
[2:11:33] good fellowship that we've had in here
[2:11:35] tonight? I've enjoyed the service
[2:11:36] tonight.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; I thought it's been wonderful.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:45] I agree with that. Not because I'm
[2:11:48] preaching it, because how the spirit of
[2:11:49] the Lord has just been so wonderful in
[2:11:51] here tonight.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But how could we have ever had
[2:11:54] this kind of feeling if brother Dale and
[2:11:56] Brother Jose and these brethren hadn't
[2:11:58] felt in their heart, let's come together
[2:12:00] as brothers?
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; You remember many years ago, Jose, this
[2:12:04] area of Canada was one of the worst in
[2:12:06] the world for fellowship. Remember at
[2:12:07] the little old church there?
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; And I called these brothers up on the
[2:12:11] platform and I said, "We have to
[2:12:13] separate these boundaries. We have to
[2:12:15] get away from these divisions and
[2:12:16] things." And all of us men stood on the
[2:12:19] platform and locked arms and promised
[2:12:21] before the people of God that we would
[2:12:23] link together. You know, that's been
[2:12:25] going on 15 years or so, and we're still
[2:12:27] doing it. Yes, sir.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; And there were men in that meeting that
[2:12:32] called me on the phone afterwards. I'm
[2:12:34] not linking arms with them bunch of
[2:12:36] devils.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I said, "Then evidently, you don't want
[2:12:38] to go to heaven.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; We're all going and you're just going to
[2:12:42] have to accept we're going to be there
[2:12:43] if you plan on going, too.
[2:12:48] Amen.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; I had another fellow call me from that
[2:12:53] same meeting.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, I'm ashamed of you. I said,
[2:12:56] why? You should stand for what's right.
[2:13:00] Some of these guys had problems with
[2:13:01] interracial marriages and and and uh
[2:13:04] certain ways of how women dress, whether
[2:13:06] they had little fake nails on and just
[2:13:09] you just name it. That stuff was thrown
[2:13:12] in my face every time I even sat down.
[2:13:14] And I couldn't even hardly eat an ice
[2:13:15] cream cone without hearing something
[2:13:16] about some about mixed marriage or some
[2:13:18] other kind of stupid thing that they
[2:13:19] could not get off of.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; I got so sick to my stomach of it. I
[2:13:23] asked a man one time. I said, "Do you
[2:13:25] know anything about St. John 3:16?"
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "What do you mean?" I said,
[2:13:30] "God so loved the world, he gave his
[2:13:32] only begotten son."
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "If we miss that, we've missed
[2:13:36] the whole message."
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. But I learned these many
[2:13:42] years later, I have learned when we lose
[2:13:45] the love of God,
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; we weaponize the word,
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; it becomes a gun that we turn on
[2:13:52] everybody that don't agree with us.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; And it's evidence that God's love has
[2:13:59] seeped out of our heart. It's cooled
[2:14:01] down the blowing of all of the, you
[2:14:04] know, people talk and they blow.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we call them blow hearts.
[2:14:09] [Laughter]
[2:14:11] That was all right. Write that down. I
[2:14:12] don't want to forget that one. I'm
[2:14:14] getting closer to 50. That happens more
[2:14:16] now than I remember it happening.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this is what it will do. God's
[2:14:22] love, listen closely. I'm closing. God's
[2:14:24] love will restore the warmth of divine
[2:14:27] love to the people of God.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; His His love, his real love will restore
[2:14:34] that warmth of divine love. You You may
[2:14:37] have it in you. You may have it, but if
[2:14:40] it's been cooled down by circumstances,
[2:14:42] cooled down by a bunch of things,
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; you're not lost if it's still laying in
[2:14:47] there.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; And there's still time while God is here
[2:14:50] dealing with souls
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; to get in the presence of the sen
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; and let him warm up that old cold love
[2:14:57] that you've let wax cold for everybody.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Bow your heads with me just a moment.
[2:15:02] And I want you to continue listening
[2:15:04] just a moment on the music if y'all
[2:15:05] don't mind. Just a moment. I I want you
[2:15:08] to think now. Every head bowed, please.
[2:15:10] Every eye closed. Now,
[2:15:13] I want you to think now
[2:15:16] all this that I preached to you tonight.
[2:15:19] If you're standing there this evening
[2:15:21] and this afternoon, I guess it would be,
[2:15:23] and you got some little thing in your
[2:15:26] heart, some old critical spirit, some
[2:15:28] old nitpicking thing, and you
[2:15:31] maybe you've been hurt and offended, and
[2:15:33] you've just gotten angry at the whole
[2:15:35] mess.
[2:15:37] I hope the reason you're here today is
[2:15:39] because someone like me gives you hope.
[2:15:42] I hope that's what I represent to this
[2:15:44] little portion of Canada. I hope that's
[2:15:46] the reason you saints come together and
[2:15:48] drive these distances to come hear me
[2:15:50] preach to you. I hope I represent a
[2:15:54] warmth
[2:15:56] and a love. I hope that I've been a a
[2:15:58] representative to you all these years as
[2:16:00] an evangelist. I hope I've represented
[2:16:03] before you a a a victory and a life and
[2:16:06] a gospel that can be attainable and that
[2:16:10] if you go past what you think is the
[2:16:12] point of no return, that doesn't mean
[2:16:14] God's done with you. I hope that's why
[2:16:15] you're sitting here this afternoon
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; is because I trust I found favor with
[2:16:21] all of you.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Well, if it be so, then you trust me as
[2:16:25] a servant of God tonight. I've preached
[2:16:27] this to you because the Lord told me to.
[2:16:30] Not because I have an axe to grind or
[2:16:32] because I'm trying to be mean or
[2:16:33] hateful, but because I feel like we're
[2:16:36] in a spirit in a time
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; where the bride is getting ready to come
[2:16:40] into that capstone of love like she's
[2:16:42] never been seen or understood before in
[2:16:45] her whole life.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; And it is time, friends, to lay aside
[2:16:51] all of the foolishness, all of the
[2:16:52] silliness.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. all of the nonsense and the
[2:16:56] legalism and the overg grace, the too
[2:16:58] much grace people that just let
[2:17:00] everything go. It's time for us to get
[2:17:03] balanced back up in our heart. And the
[2:17:05] only way we're going to balance all the
[2:17:07] things moving around the little watch of
[2:17:09] life is if that main spring is moving
[2:17:12] properly.
[2:17:14] So, while you stand here before the
[2:17:16] Lord,
[2:17:18] would you just be willing to say,
[2:17:19] "Brother Ben, in my heart,
[2:17:23] I know that I've let these things cool
[2:17:25] me off. And the love I used to feel, it
[2:17:28] just isn't there anymore like it used to
[2:17:30] be. I'm colder than I've ever been. But
[2:17:33] I want to lay in the presence of the
[2:17:34] sun. I want to lay in his presence and
[2:17:37] be warmed up."
[2:17:40] Who feels like that in here? Would you
[2:17:42] raise your hand to the Lord and say,
[2:17:43] "Father,
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; oh my, look at these hands going up
[2:17:48] everywhere.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my." Of course, I know the arrogant,
[2:17:54] the proud,
[2:17:57] the ones that feel like they've already
[2:17:58] arrived. Of course, they're going to
[2:18:00] feel like a message like this is just
[2:18:02] not, "Yeah, this isn't their speed."
[2:18:06] People will hear it on the internet or
[2:18:08] they'll come sitting a service like that
[2:18:10] and preaching like this don't even
[2:18:12] affect them anymore. Why? The love of
[2:18:15] God has gotten so cold until it's just
[2:18:17] dead or it was never there in the first
[2:18:19] place. One or the other.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; So friends tonight, if you can feel that
[2:18:25] little tugging of the Holy Spirit in
[2:18:27] your heart,
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; that little something moving inside of
[2:18:30] you that says, "Get that criticism out
[2:18:32] of your heart. Quit being skeptical.
[2:18:34] Quit weaponizing my word. Quit turning
[2:18:36] that word against everybody that don't
[2:18:38] agree with you. Quit having that
[2:18:39] separation isolation type spirit,
[2:18:43] fussing and stewing. If you hear the
[2:18:45] Holy Spirit dealing with you like that,
[2:18:47] I wonder if you'd just step out of your
[2:18:49] seat and walk up here to the front. Just
[2:18:50] step out in this aisle and come and
[2:18:53] stand here and rededicate your life to
[2:18:54] the Lord Jesus Christ and say, "As of
[2:18:57] tonight, Lord, I'm going to be a brand
[2:18:59] new person starting right here tonight.
[2:19:02] Hallelujah.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Who among us would like to be the first
[2:19:05] brave one to show in their testimony?
[2:19:07] I'm coming. I'm going to stand right up
[2:19:09] here in this front. I'm rededicating my
[2:19:11] life to the Lord. I'm done with this
[2:19:12] lifestyle. I'm done with this attitude.
[2:19:15] I'm done with this spirit like this. I
[2:19:17] want God I want Jesus to change me
[2:19:19] completely.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; God bless these folks.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Who else wants to step out here on this
[2:19:27] aisle and come up and say, "I want to be
[2:19:28] a testimony.
[2:19:32] Now, it makes me wonder when you raised
[2:19:33] your hand, did you really mean it? Or
[2:19:35] were you just doing that to be nice?
[2:19:38] I mean, do you really want to get right
[2:19:40] with God? Why don't you come stand in
[2:19:42] this aisle and say, "Jesus, change me."
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; There you go. That's That's the way.
[2:19:50] Who else would like to join these up
[2:19:51] here? There's a lot more hands that went
[2:19:53] up.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Won't you put some footsteps on your
[2:19:57] testimony?
[2:19:59] Say, "God, I'm going to stand here
[2:20:00] tonight and rededicate myself to you."
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; God bless each one of these coming. Be
[2:20:07] brave, friends. God don't want you to be
[2:20:09] a coward or be laidback with some kind
[2:20:12] of fear or something like that.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ben, if I go up here,
[2:20:15] everybody will see me. Fine. Fine. Let
[2:20:17] them see you.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; It just puts that much more pressure on
[2:20:20] you to be that much more sincere.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; if you mean business with God, God's
[2:20:25] going to mean business with you.
[2:20:28] Praise be to God.
[2:20:30] Somebody else that would just like to
[2:20:32] say, "I'm I'm done with this. I got to
[2:20:33] get this stuff out of my heart. It's
[2:20:36] been laying there too long and things
[2:20:38] are so out of sync in my life." Well,
[2:20:40] it's because that main spring ain't
[2:20:42] turning like it used to. Oh, praise the
[2:20:45] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Anybody else would like to join this
[2:20:49] little group up here in the front?
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Let me linger just another minute or two
[2:20:53] in case the Lord's dealing with
[2:20:54] somebody's heart.
[2:20:57] God bless you.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together all of us.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Fatherless
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Lord for this little group that's
[2:21:06] gathered up here tonight Lord Jesus.
[2:21:09] Father, they don't come up here just for
[2:21:11] show. This is not just for a public
[2:21:13] demonstration of something, but Lord,
[2:21:16] your word sharp and cutting and right
[2:21:20] down between the soul and the spirit,
[2:21:23] between the marrows of the bone. Father,
[2:21:26] you've went right down into the very
[2:21:28] precious part of our heart and you've
[2:21:30] dealt with us expressingly.
[2:21:32] Now, Lord, these souls come before your
[2:21:35] presence,
[2:21:37] wanting, Lord Jesus, a great change in
[2:21:40] where they've been, that old critical
[2:21:43] thing or that skeptical thing or that
[2:21:45] weaponizing the word or isolation or
[2:21:49] whatever thing may be working on them.
[2:21:51] Lord, they've let hurts and pains and
[2:21:53] ills and betrayals and all those kind of
[2:21:56] things and disloyalty and what more?
[2:21:58] They've let it scar them and hurt them
[2:22:00] and blow upon their life until they
[2:22:03] become cold and wounded and scarred away
[2:22:06] from fellowship and religious actions
[2:22:09] that are necessary for a Christian such
[2:22:12] as brotherly love and fellowship. those
[2:22:15] religious, godly, true religious
[2:22:17] behaviors. They're not things, Lord, we
[2:22:19] put on because we're taught to do it. It
[2:22:21] should be the very nature of us. But
[2:22:23] Lord, the devil has tried to ransack
[2:22:26] these children of God's life. But Lord,
[2:22:29] we pray tonight the Holy Ghost will
[2:22:31] drive away every one of these evil
[2:22:33] things. And may the heat and the light
[2:22:36] of the Holy Spirit, may it come fall
[2:22:38] upon every heart, every life, every
[2:22:41] soul, every mind, every spirit. and may
[2:22:44] it drive away the coldness of this hour
[2:22:47] and may you warm their heart again in
[2:22:50] the love of God. If there be sin there,
[2:22:53] may you forgive them of it, Lord. If
[2:22:55] there be sickness, may you heal them of
[2:22:57] it. If there be a wound or a sore in
[2:22:59] their spirit, may you send the balm of
[2:23:01] Gilead to heal their spirit. Whatever it
[2:23:04] may be tonight, Lord Jesus, may the
[2:23:07] spirit of God move expressingly to every
[2:23:10] heart and every life. visit them right
[2:23:12] there where they're standing. Lord, we
[2:23:13] pray, Father, in the name of Jesus, I
[2:23:16] pray you'd bless every life. Father,
[2:23:19] there's ministers standing here, Lord,
[2:23:20] how they've been so betrayed and lied on
[2:23:23] and rebuked and everything else. But
[2:23:25] Lord, hear these brethren stand here as
[2:23:27] a testimony tonight. They're not going
[2:23:29] to allow this lady of seeing coldness to
[2:23:31] take the love of God out of their
[2:23:33] hearts.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. If that happens with
[2:23:36] the leaders, may it happen with the very
[2:23:38] smallest one among us here tonight.
[2:23:41] For every Zakius in his tree, for every
[2:23:44] Sarapheneician woman, for every rich
[2:23:47] young ruler, God, may your Holy Spirit
[2:23:50] come upon the scene and work in that
[2:23:53] heart, Lord, a work that only you can
[2:23:55] do.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Grant it, my father, we pray and ask in
[2:24:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:24:04] Hallelujah.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Would you just raise your hands up to
[2:24:13] the Lord with me and say, "Father, thank
[2:24:14] you.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for speaking to me.
[2:24:18] Thank you, Lord, for dealing with me.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for having mercy on me.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you for letting me know you're not
[2:24:26] done with me.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for letting me know I
[2:24:29] haven't gone too far,
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; but your hand is still on me. Your grace
[2:24:33] is still on me. Your mercy is still with
[2:24:35] me. You're still leading and guiding.
[2:24:37] You've done everything you promised. You
[2:24:39] have not left me. You have not forsaken
[2:24:40] me. You're right by my side. I thank you
[2:24:43] tonight, Lord, for being an
[2:24:45] allsufficient God. I thank you tonight,
[2:24:47] Lord, for blessing the people of Canada.
[2:24:50] I thank you, Lord, for these repented
[2:24:51] hearts, for these tender spirits and
[2:24:53] souls that want to be blessed by the
[2:24:55] moving of the presence of God. May the
[2:24:58] Holy Ghost come into this place tonight,
[2:25:00] Lord, and drive away every evil thing.
[2:25:02] We thank you Lord for warming our hearts
[2:25:05] by the presence and the light of the sen
[2:25:08] of God. And may the Holy Ghost we pray
[2:25:10] continue to take our footsteps from here
[2:25:13] Lord. May we not fall into error. May we
[2:25:16] not fall into gross sin. Keep us Lord by
[2:25:19] your hand.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Undergard us by your strength. May your
[2:25:24] mercy and your love support us and hold
[2:25:27] us up Lord. May the tenderness that we
[2:25:30] used to have as young Christians, may
[2:25:32] that sweetness that we used to have as
[2:25:34] believers when we first come to your
[2:25:36] truth when you first moved on our
[2:25:38] hearts, Lord, may that just enter back
[2:25:40] into our hearts now, Lord God. May all
[2:25:42] that old crusty thing, may that old
[2:25:45] attitude, that old nature, that old
[2:25:47] spirit, that old gotcha thing and get
[2:25:49] you thing and show you thing and make a
[2:25:51] point thing, may all of that be drove
[2:25:54] from us, Lord, tonight.
[2:25:56] May we come back to being like little
[2:25:58] children,
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; tender and sweet,
[2:26:02] flexible and forgiving.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my Lord. Thank you, my Lord.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; How we bless your holy name.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; How we bless your holy name. Just help
[2:26:20] me love him now everybody. Just help me
[2:26:22] praise him.
[2:26:24] Hallelujah.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; We love you so much, Jesus.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; We love you so much, Lord.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, this is the condition them
[2:26:37] old Pharisees and Sadducees got in
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; when you showed up in human flesh. They
[2:26:42] were so critical. They were so crusty.
[2:26:44] They were so set in their ways. They
[2:26:46] couldn't see the very Lord of Life
[2:26:48] standing in human flesh. Oh, God. And
[2:26:51] our people are drawn to that very same
[2:26:53] thing. The hour has repeated itself to
[2:26:56] where modern-day Pharisees, Sadducees
[2:26:59] are standing in our churches with the
[2:27:00] same old attitude, the same old spirit.
[2:27:03] Oh, but God don't let that affect or
[2:27:06] overcome the little bride of Christ. May
[2:27:08] the spirit of the living God that
[2:27:10] purchased her for her his possession.
[2:27:14] Lord Jesus, may you open our eyes and
[2:27:17] illuminate our hearts to see the evils
[2:27:19] around us and not to be affected by it.
[2:27:23] Help us, Lord, to always keep your love
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; first and center in our life and
[2:27:28] foremost.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; As your Bible tells us, people are going
[2:27:34] to get wicer. They'll get more evil.
[2:27:37] They'll get seducing spirits will be on
[2:27:40] the rise.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; Sin on every hand. But oh God,
[2:27:45] may the little bride be hid in your
[2:27:48] pavilion,
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; covered over in the love of Jesus
[2:27:52] Christ.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:27:57] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, love of God.
[2:28:07] How rich and pure,
[2:28:11] [Music]
[2:28:13] how menless
[2:28:20] and strong.
[2:28:24] It shall forever

[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:35] the saint. and angels
[2:28:42] song.
[2:28:46] All love of God,
[2:28:52] how rich and pure,
[2:28:58] how measureless
[2:29:05] and strong.
[2:29:10] It shall fall.
[2:29:17] [Music]
[2:29:30] song.
[2:29:32] I'll sing it one more time. Oh
[2:29:35] God,
[2:29:39] how rich
[2:29:42] you
[2:29:44] [Music]
[2:29:58] fall.
[2:30:03] more into
[2:30:08] the saint

[2:30:14] shraise.
[2:30:15] [Music]
[2:30:21] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:30:25] Just to show you this isn't just show
[2:30:27] for me
[2:30:29] here. About a month ago,
[2:30:32] I was at a certain event. It's a goth
[2:30:35] and
[2:30:38] there's a man that I'd known since I've
[2:30:40] been a boy
[2:30:42] several years ago
[2:30:44] betrayed me as a friend deeply. Hurt me
[2:30:48] very deeply.
[2:30:50] Literally just turned his back on me.
[2:30:53] And
[2:30:55] I forgive the man for what he done, of
[2:30:57] course, and how he did it. And I even
[2:31:00] understood why he was doing it on his
[2:31:03] part of it. Anyways,
[2:31:05] but somehow I just was so hurt and
[2:31:08] broken over that. I forgave him, but I
[2:31:11] just didn't seem I couldn't seem to get
[2:31:13] over it.
[2:31:16] I was going up the aisle and I looked
[2:31:17] down that way.
[2:31:19] mind. I can see the back of his head
[2:31:22] and I thought I ain't getting into that.
[2:31:24] I walked out the building, went all the
[2:31:25] way around the other side to avoid him.
[2:31:29] And I got in the car and went back to
[2:31:32] the house and seemed like the Lord was
[2:31:34] dealing with me half the night.
[2:31:37] I could hear brother Brown when he came
[2:31:39] that message while we're in our
[2:31:40] denomination. He said some of them
[2:31:42] Christians said they passed the other
[2:31:44] side of the street and went up wouldn't
[2:31:45] even look them that way.
[2:31:47] And I thought, yeah,
[2:31:50] even though I could stand with every
[2:31:53] right,
[2:31:54] justify everything that I felt,
[2:31:58] God dealt with me. You think I'd have
[2:32:00] done it that way?
[2:32:02] How do you think I would have acted if I
[2:32:04] saw that same man?
[2:32:06] Next day went back to this thing and I
[2:32:09] was walking up been several hours and I
[2:32:11] was walking up a certain place and my
[2:32:14] daughter was standing there next to me.
[2:32:18] She said, "Oh, daddy, there's that man."
[2:32:21] I could hear Brother Bram talking about
[2:32:23] when he told that lie. When they called
[2:32:25] the next day, Joseph said, "Daddy, you
[2:32:28] want me to tell him you're gone?" or
[2:32:29] something like he said, "See how sin
[2:32:30] corrupts?"
[2:32:33] My middle daughter said to me, "There's
[2:32:35] that man again." And I said, "Not this
[2:32:39] time." I went straight up to him and I
[2:32:41] got him around the neck and I hugged
[2:32:43] him.
[2:32:45] He looked at me. He said, "I've missed
[2:32:46] you." So, I missed you, too.
[2:32:49] You know, the minute I did that, that
[2:32:52] thing went
[2:32:55] carried it a long time now.
[2:32:58] But this is what I'm talking about. the
[2:33:01] purest among us,
[2:33:03] the most just among us. You can have the
[2:33:06] purest of motives, the purest of ideas,
[2:33:10] but the love of God will take you
[2:33:12] farther
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; than even what you yourself want to go.
[2:33:19] And this is what brother Bram said,
[2:33:22] live for the man that would kill you. He
[2:33:26] said, that's real love.
[2:33:28] He said, ' Because if you can live for
[2:33:30] that guy, listen to these words. He
[2:33:32] said, you're staring heaven right in the
[2:33:34] face.
[2:33:36] [Music]
[2:33:38] So if we don't have this in our heart,
[2:33:41] when Jesus comes to take us out of here
[2:33:43] and the rapture, resurrection takes
[2:33:46] place, if we don't have it, we'll be
[2:33:48] left sitting right here
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; with all of our excuses, with all of our
[2:33:52] justifications,
[2:33:54] with all of our reasons why we're right.
[2:34:00] the last year and this year especially,
[2:34:02] the Lord's really been dealing with me
[2:34:05] because I realize
[2:34:07] age-wise, I'm kind of at a spot now. I
[2:34:11] said to a young man the other day, I
[2:34:12] said, I can't I told him, I cannot
[2:34:14] believe I'm getting ready to say this to
[2:34:15] you, but I am old enough to be your
[2:34:17] daddy.
[2:34:19] I never thought I'd ever reach a place
[2:34:21] in my life in words that ever come out
[2:34:22] of my mouth,
[2:34:24] but God's been dealing with me. I looked
[2:34:27] at it the other day. I'm 14 years from
[2:34:31] my s first social security check. Okay?
[2:34:37] If I go another 20 years, I'll be 68.
[2:34:40] That's just 20 short years.
[2:34:43] The prophet said like a little buzzer
[2:34:45] goes off in you. And I thought, I'm at
[2:34:47] that point in my life where I'm going to
[2:34:49] have to be more serious about anything
[2:34:51] I've ever said or preached or done
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; than I've ever been in my life because
[2:34:56] you'll blink your eyes and you'll be
[2:34:58] standing there nearing 70 and knocking
[2:35:00] on 75 and 80. My mother turned 89 this
[2:35:02] year.
[2:35:05] Time don't stop for nobody,
[2:35:07] but the hour is drawing close, friends.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've got to have this in our
[2:35:13] heart
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; or we won't go when Jesus comes to kid
[2:35:19] us.
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do,
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; don't let it stop here tonight.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Feed it.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Feed it the word. And when that old
[2:35:30] thing comes back to you, that old memory
[2:35:32] or that old feeling, something comes
[2:35:34] back to you and says, "I remember when
[2:35:36] that guy done that." Just kick it out of
[2:35:37] your mind and say,
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; "I might remember it, but the love of
[2:35:40] God will not."
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; And just throw your hands up and say,
[2:35:46] "Lord, fill me so much with your love
[2:35:48] until I can heal the unhealable, save
[2:35:51] the unsavable, and reach the
[2:35:54] unreachable."
[2:35:56] Because God only has one pair of hands
[2:35:57] in this day, and that's yours.
[2:36:01] And we're the only ones that can reach a
[2:36:03] dying world.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; And the world is dying for love.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Where are they going to see it?
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; In us.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; How rich and pure,
[2:36:21] how meless.
[2:36:28] and strong.
[2:36:32] It shall
[2:36:36] [Music]
[2:36:40] endure
[2:36:43] the saint and
[2:36:50] just
[2:36:53] one more time with all your hearts. Oh
[2:36:57] god.
[2:36:59] [Music]
[2:37:07] Yes.
[2:37:08] [Music]
[2:37:18] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:37:20] [Music]
[2:37:28] Saint
[2:37:31] [Music]
[2:37:38] Amen.
[2:37:40] Amen. Just uh
[2:37:45] ask brother Ben
[2:37:50] just to see
[2:37:52] God
[2:37:54] in our midst.
[2:37:57] [Music]
[2:37:59] Now, the home church knows where I'm
[2:38:01] going. Brother Brandon, did I tell you
[2:38:04] what I was preaching on?
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Did I send you any quotes?
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; Did I send you any verses?
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; None.
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; In the last 6 months?
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; Probably 10?
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; No. Nothing.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; I preached five services ago on
[2:38:15] compassion.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; Was eternal life by a pagan believer
[2:38:20] that by religion was pagan. And because
[2:38:23] of compassion and the good Samaritan got
[2:38:26] eternal life.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; I never preached seriousness. I preached
[2:38:31] four messages in a row on love.
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; I read every scripture, every quote.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Everything that I could find in four
[2:38:42] scriptures. And this last Sunday,
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; I said, "If God will give me enough
[2:38:46] grace, I'm going to change the topic."
[2:38:48] And God had a sense of humor and came
[2:38:50] and preached on it again.
[2:38:56] Hallelujah.
[2:39:01] Love. Amen. You know, brother Bam said
[2:39:03] the evidence of the Holy Spirit the
[2:39:05] first time he said it was love.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; And then he said God his revelation grew
[2:39:10] and he said it was the revelation of the
[2:39:12] word for your day which is still love.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; And the definition of God, God was the
[2:39:17] word and it was love. This message is
[2:39:20] love. And you know when the woman came
[2:39:22] and washed Jesus' feet in the cinnamon's
[2:39:25] house and she had much sin and cinnamon
[2:39:28] thought Jesus shouldn't have been
[2:39:29] letting her wash her feet. He said,
[2:39:31] "Because those that are much forgiven
[2:39:33] are able to love much
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; much much love."
[2:39:40] Amazing
[2:39:42] love. You know, you know, and we're just
[2:39:45] clo I what an amazing God we serve.
[2:39:48] Amen. You know, I just, you know, we
[2:39:50] should never ever ever judge anybody.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; I have no right to judge anybody. 64
[2:39:58] quote. God said that all the people were
[2:40:00] were money in God's pocket. And he said
[2:40:04] all the he said don't kick them out. He
[2:40:06] said even if they can't believe the
[2:40:07] truth, God uses pennies and nickels and
[2:40:10] dimes and quarters and silver dollars.
[2:40:12] He said Lot was a penny and Abraham was
[2:40:14] a silver dollar. He also said in drawing
[2:40:17] the circle of the message, and I know
[2:40:18] this is rerun for the home church, but
[2:40:20] it was about a man that was on the
[2:40:21] pulpit that had a trinitarian baptism.
[2:40:23] And brother Bam said he had the baptism
[2:40:25] of the Holy Ghost and they were going to
[2:40:26] exclude Brother Bam from the things. And
[2:40:28] he said, "If you think you're right and
[2:40:31] all the denominations and all the other
[2:40:32] people are wrong,"
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; this is how he said it. He said, "That's
[2:40:36] the poison breath of Satan."
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; Because, and he finished it because how
[2:40:43] do you know you message believers that
[2:40:45] when you get there, you might have been
[2:40:47] believing it just a little bit different
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; than what God intended you to see it?
[2:40:54] And that'll make you just bow your head
[2:40:56] and say, "Oh, Lord God,
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; oh Lord God.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just pointing all the fingers at
[2:41:03] me."
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; You don't have to point them at anybody.
[2:41:07] Just point them at me.
[2:41:10] Amen.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God uses lots of people. Lots of
[2:41:15] people that I've judged in the past.
[2:41:16] God's used
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; lots of people. Just leave it alone.
[2:41:20] God's got a whole family, a whole flower
[2:41:23] garden. You just love them. Love, love,
[2:41:26] love. Love covers a multitude
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; of sin.
[2:41:33] It was love that held them on the cross
[2:41:35] that paid for my sins. Don't worry about
[2:41:37] your kids' sins. Just love them.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; Love them.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; Love will take care of their sins.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; Remember Job? Job's kids were saved
[2:41:47] because of Job's sacrifice for his kids
[2:41:51] as per chance.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; Love,
[2:41:56] love covers them all to just look the
[2:41:59] other way in love.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; It's a lot I I I it hurts me, Lord, but
[2:42:03] love. I don't agree with it, but love.
[2:42:08] Hallelujah.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's amazing.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:14] Amen. Let's sing.
[2:42:16] song. More than ever before, Lord, I
[2:42:18] love you. Amen. With some fellowship
[2:42:20] after. More than ever
[2:42:24] before,
[2:42:26] Lord, I love you.
[2:42:30] More than ever
[2:42:33] before,
[2:42:35] Lord, I need you.
[2:42:40] And more than ever
[2:42:43] before,
[2:42:44] I want you to tell you
[2:42:49] I love you now.
[2:42:52] More than ever
[2:42:55] before,
[2:42:59] more than ever
[2:43:02] before.
[2:43:04] Lord, I love you. Hallelujah. I love
[2:43:08] you, Jesus.
[2:43:12] before
[2:43:14] I
[2:43:17] [Music]
[2:43:19] ever
[2:43:21] before.
[2:43:23] I want to tell you
[2:43:28] I love you now
[2:43:31] more than ever
[2:43:34] before. God bless you all.
