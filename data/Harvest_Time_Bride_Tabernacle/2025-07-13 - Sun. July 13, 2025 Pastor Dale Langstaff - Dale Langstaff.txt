Lord, I pray you'll be with every soul that's represented here today. Lord, meet every need that's represented. Lord, you're the great provider. Whatever the need is in the body of Christ, Lord God, you've already provided it. And Lord, we welcome you in this place. And Lord, we pray that you'll speak through your word to your bride today and bless them, Lord Jesus. Help us recognize your plan for us, Lord God. We pray your beautiful name. We pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Maybe you can be seated just for a moment. Thank you, musicians. Man, just uh couple of announcements. Um just uh next weekend uh John Dana uh in Missaga has special meetings. It's a brother preaching from South Africa. So there's two services on Saturday. There's a Saturday at 10:30, there's Saturday at 700 p.m. And then Sunday morning, it's at 11:30. It's quite a bit later than our service, but I would highly encourage anyone that could go to go. I actually strongly considered cancelling our service here, but I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that because of the visitors. We've had different visitors. See, we were out this week and we were at a bread bakery and I was talking to the the owner, the man that bakes the bread and and he was talking about church and I give him a card and uh you know this week when I was meditating on what to do with service, I felt like God just said like this. He said, "What if they showed up and you weren't here?" Amen. And we've also had Steve and uh the other brother from Jamaica come and different ones. But uh so we are going to be here. But if any of you are missing next Sunday because you're at John Denquas, you sure got our support and condolence and and different ones. We we're actually encouraging to go and me and Lan will be there Saturday morning. And uh so we just believe that that's Scott's will for this time. Amen. Also, after that, camp's coming up very quickly. We just can we coveret your prayers. It's uh well prepared, but just uh that God would help us have a wonderful time in his presence. Amen. At that time, Amen. Amen. So, next Sunday, and man, if you want any information, talk to us, look at the flyer. You can look online or contact us. There might be different ones going. If if one or two wanted to go together and go as a ride or something, it would be a real blessing. It shows our support and friendship to them. They're a bunch of them are going to be at our camp also. And and it's just a beautiful relationship. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just stand and we read the word. I'm going to turn to Joel 3 and read 14. And I want to preach on I want to preach on right in the fence. I want to preach on riding defense. And I really believe God has something for us today. You know, this is God's word right here. And that's powerful. The only thing that'll never pass away is God's word. and multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision. For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. Lord Jesus, I pray that you can use this vessel to show your people what you revealed and just showed unto me, Lord God, from your word. and all will be blessed. And we praise your name for it. In your name. Amen. You may have your seats. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision. Jeff, will you turn the lights on there? Bottom switch right there. And the day of the Lord is near. And we know the day of the Lord is near. And there's multitudes of us in the valley of decision. And you know in our in our message and in the Bible, you know, we know Ephesians, the first chapter of Ephesians, we know Romans 8 talk about predestination and and we believe in predestination and being elected and called and all those things. But our prophet taught us that if you push predestination or election in the wrong way, you will bring disgrace on God's word. And you can be 100% predestinated and elected this morning. And I believe you are, but you still have to make a decision. You can't ride the fence. You can't just say, "Well, I'll be just wherever God wants me to be, and I'll just, you know, I can't change my decision." That's that's completely a lie from God's word. God's actually changed his mind. His own word. God told Prophet, you'll die. and and he prayed and God changed his mind. Give him 15 more years and multiple decisions like that. The very first character we're going to look at in the Bible was God would have gave him grace. And you know, God is not looking for a bride that's right in the fence. He's not looking for a bride for him to make all the decisions. You know, God said to Moses, he said, "What do you say?" He said to our prophet, there was times where he said to our prophet, he said, "I'm waiting to see what do you say." You know what the prophet when the young couple in the service when when they told him before that they have a trap set for you. Amen. It was people it was his decision to pass on grace. I wonder what we would pass on today to somebody that was misbehaving in the church of God. Would we pass on grace or we pass on judgment just to fill our religious esteem or our our our position what we think. Amen. Multitudes. Multitudes in the valley of decision. The day of the Lord is near. In the valley of decision. Let's look over just to lay a foundation. And we're going to look at multiple characters in the Bible that had to make decision. in Joshua 24 and we see here multip uh Joshua 24:15 15 actually let's read 14 for therefore the fear of the Lord and he served them with in sincerity and truth and he put away the gods which were the fathers and served the other side of the floods in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and here verse 15 verse 15 If it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, then choose you this day. Who you going to serve? Amen. Even though we have predestination, God still expects you to choose. God still gave you free moral agency. Who you going to serve? You can't ride the fence no longer. You know, brother Baron preached messages on decision. You have a decision. Everything in your life is a decision. And sadly, most decisions are made out of fear. You won't take a risk. Most decisions are made out of fear. First Kings 18 and 21. And Elijah came to all the people and said, "How long will you halt between two opinions?" God's saying that today. We've halted a long time between two opinions. If the Lord be God, let's give him all we got. But if Balum, then follow him. And the people answered him. Not a word. See, the people that Elijah was coming to, they were right in the fence. Oh, wow. They were right in the fence. They didn't want to decide between Balum and God. They wanted both. But this God that we serve, he was either number one or he ain't even in the picture. Amen. That's great. Help us, Lord. You know, your silence is a loud no. Your silence is a loud decision against God. You can't ride the fence. Amen. I don't mean to be arrogant or rude, but what did the prophet Isaiah say? He said, "For me in my house, this boy's going down serving the Lord." Amen. In the valley of decision here, Brother Bram said, "While you're making decisions, you decide. Why halt you between two opinions?" Here's a prophet that believed in predestination. But he taught every service that you need to decide. That's right. You know, you'll decide in your life. You'll decide whether well you know you might not make many decisions when you're young but you'll decide when you're growing up maybe will I go to school or not go to school secondary school why I get a job or be lazy will I marry or not marry will I have a family or not married where will I live will I move a million miles away from my parents where will I work I serve God and how will I serve God you know the whole world is serving Not. Well, just go out to the grocery store and ask anybody, "Are you a Christian?" I'll bet you nine out of 10 people would say, "Yes." But will you serve God with your whole heart? Will you serve him in everything you can do? You know, the Bible talked about giving to God until there just wasn't nothing to give. I don't mean money. That means your talents, your life, your strength. You know when you are weak, God is strong. You say, "Well, I I just don't have the strength to do that." But God can do it through you. You just stand up and God will make you strong. You say, "Well, I don't have no ability." God gave you're insulting God cuz God gave you your talents. Amen. all these things where you choose you know when you come to and and I don't I I want this to be positive but you know you can tell somebody's choice by how they value something you know when when you're coming to a marriage of your wife I'm just going to say because I'm a or you know your your your fiance or your wife you know you spend a lot of time with her buy her a lot of flowers and go to a lot of restaurants but when your love grows cold that all goes away you don't buy or nothing. You never go to the restaurant and you work like a maniac and you never spend time with her. Why did you marry her? Why did you make a commitment to God to not spend no time with him? You know, do you go to work more early than you go to church? Brother Bam said that you would never miss church for work, but you can miss work all the time for church. There's none of us believe that. We say we believe the prophet. But see, your dollar that you're working for is depreciated like millions of times. And now, you know, I was I was watching a I read a thing uh you know, on the internet. They said in in ' 65, I believe it was. You could buy a house for a bar of gold. They said you can still buy a house for a bar of gold today. The bar of gold ain't changed any. It's still just a bar of gold. But your number ain't worth nothing. So go ahead, work hard. Their doors open, Tim. Go ahead and work as hard as you want because it ain't worth anything. The house that cost 70,64 costs a million3 today, but you're making lots of money. But in Venezuela, they don't bend over to pick it up. They use the the sweep the street sweepers to pick up the paper. Yeah. Street sweepers to pick up the paper. Amen. In this message, we've pushed predestination and election so much that people think they can just do nothing. I believe I can sit home. I don't have to go to church. I don't have to support a church. I can come whenever it's convenient. I don't have to give. I don't have to sing a special. I don't have to. I don't pray for anybody. I never prayed for the service ever in my life. Never put forth anything. Never never done anything. Never shovel the snow. Never clean because because I'm elected. I'm predestinated. Genesis 4 3-7. Here we see here that in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought a sacrifice of the fruit of the ground and Abel brought a sacrifice of the first thing of his flock and the Lord had respects to Abel offering but to Cain's offering he had not respects and Cain was very wise and his countenance fell. And then in verse six and this is what I want you to catch. And the Lord said to Cain, I believe, let's just rephrase that. And the Lord said to us this morning, why art thou wroth? And why does thy countenance fall? If thou doest well, thou shalt not be should thou not be accepted. God gave Cain a space to repent. Cain was right in the fence. Cain made a decision to not serve God. Cain could have been safe 100%. This is God talking to him. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? Of course you would be. But if thou doest not well, sin lith at the door. Amen. Sin. Let's go to Acts five. And we see here Acts 5 and and uh we're going to read 19. Maybe we'll start at 17. Vicki, Acts 5:17. But here we see the twel apostles and they had been out and they were preaching in Jesus' name. And it was a new doctrine because many were still under the law and didn't believe in the grace of Jesus and salvation. And here the high priest rose up and they seen that they were in the synagogue and they were furious. The religious people were furious because the apostles had made a decision to serve Jesus and they took them and they threw them in prison. Verse 18, they threw them in prison and the angel of the Lord came to him and opened the prison doors and brought them out and said, "Go speak." Oh wow. I thought I didn't have to say nothing for God. Verse 20 says, "Go and speak in the temple to the people the words of life." See that the apostles couldn't ride the fence. But I I'm not gifted. I'm not called. I don't I don't even have a church building. I don't have a place. Nobody's supporting me. I just left prison. Let me let me ask you something. If you had been put in prison for disobeying the government of the land doing something, would you went right back out as soon as you get out and did the same thing again? Just think of CO and any of the CO laws. If you had got your bank account frozen and they let you out and not froze your bank account, would you go right back out and do the exact same thing again? They did. They did. But we wouldn't cuz we're educated. And you know what they said there? You know, you can read this all in this chapter. I don't have it. Maybe we'll drop to verse 40. Actually verse 28. Sorry. And here here when they they went right back out to the temple, they started preaching in Jesus' name. Now that was an order of God and they were rearrested and they said, "Didn't we not tell you to not do this and preach in God's name? Didn't we like what are you not getting? But see, God was looking for a decision. He was looking you're in the valley of decision. Choose you this day who you'll serve. They couldn't ride the fence. You know, if you jump down to verse 41 and they departed from the presence of the counter rejoicing because they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus. They went right back out. But if you see this in here, they Oh, actually verse 29, Peter answered and the other apostles answered and said, "Ought we not obey God rather than men?" But see, God was looking for a decision. God wasn't looking for somebody that's right in the fence. If it if you're just right at the fence and you go whatever the decision is of least resistance, you're not going in the rapture because there'll be hard times before the end and you'll go the way of least resistance. So you'll surrender. Amen. 1st Samuel 17, we see here David and verse 32. 1st Samuel 17:32. And David said unto Saul, "Let no man's heart fail them because of Sam, because of Goliath, cuz thy servant will go and fight the Philistine." See, David had nothing to do with Goliath. He was a squirt. He was a little kid. He wasn't even to the age of accountability yet. But his mom and dad had raised him well. And he knew the promises of God. And that uncircumcised Philistine was blaspheing his God. And David refused to be silent. And let me just tell you what, it was all uphill for David because his own brothers attacked him. His own brothers said, "You're just showing off. if you're just putting on a big show and why don't you go back and just smell like the sheep and go watch the sheep in the pasture you little squirt. But there was enough people around that they went and rehearsed the words to the king. And David said, "I'll fight him because God delivered me from the lion and the bear and he'll deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." And so Saul said to David, "You go and the Lord be with you." But I'll tell you what, if you were your children today, just think of your children, would you support them to fight Goliath? No. God's got an army. He's got the Israelite army. Why? God's supporting the Israelite army. Why does he want my little kid? God was looking for a decision. He's looking for people with a backbone that'll make a stand. Amen. Rebecca, let's go to Genesis 24. And we see here in verse 55 here his brother and mother which were a type of the preacher in the church. They said let let Rebecca stay with us just a few days. It's no big deal if we we don't really serve God with all of our heart all the time. Like let's take a holiday for 10 days. Like I mean she's going to be gone forever. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. And Eleazar, Abraham's servant, said, "Hinder me not, seeing the Lord has prospered my way, that I may go to my master." Like, you know, that would have been a hard decision. You're saying goodbye to your daughter. They never had like uh video calls then or, you know, all these things. It wasn't like they were going to see him very often. Probably about once a year in the camel. Probably never again. And they said, they said, "Well, we'll call Rebecca and we'll require of her." And they called Rebecca and said unto her, "Wilt thou go with this man?" And she said, "I will go. I will go." You know, Isaac and Rebecca was a perfect type of Christ in the church. Christ and the bride, but Christ has got a lot of bride represent saying their bride. But they're not saying, "I'll go." because she left all her comfort, all her wealth to go through a desert of robbers and pirates on an air conditioned Campbell with no water and the ice supply would run out and the water of leather jugs. Can you imagine what that tasted like? It would have just been just like drinking out of a copper jug. Not hardly. She was with her mom and her dad. She was on easy street. Yeah. Yeah. And she never It wasn't even her fault that she had to make the decision. But God had moved her to a place and a position. And God's moved every one of us to a place and a position where you can't sit on the fence no more. You got to say, "I'll go." And if you don't answer, it's no well things happen. Genesis 6, we see here Noah, God was so distressed because of the earth, Noah 13, that the end he was going to judge the world and send a flood on the world. And God asked Noah to do something completely ridiculous. And if you don't think so, you need to take a trip down to see the ark and you'll see how big it was. They never had cordless tools by Well, they were cordless, but they were powered by hand. Yeah. Hand tools. And to think that God would ask one man to build an ark and it had never rained before. He He needed counseling. He needed a lot of counseling. No. And if you drop down to verse 22 of Genesis 6 and it says, "Thus Noah did according to all God had commanded him. So did he." See, Noah didn't ride the fence. Amen. Multitudes, multitudes are in the valley of decision, and the day of the Lord is near. In the valley of decision, you know, and and and we're going to go into more characters, but Kadesh Barnea was a time when Israel came to Kadar Bernnea and they had to decide if they were going to serve God or go into the promised land. And you know, they never served God. They wandered in the promised land for 40 years. That was after Kadar Bernia. I believe it was just shy of 40 years because of their decision at Kadar Bernia. See God God require even though you're predestinated, God still requires an answer. Far too much in the message church, we've preached election, election, election. You're okay. You're elected. You'll be there cuz God will be there. That's true. If you make the right decision, you still have to make the decision. He said, "All that believeth on me shall be saved." And all that don't are already condemned. Amen. Daniel, Daniel 6, I love this. I love Daniel. He was He was amazing. But here, let's just We got time and let's just go through this. Daniel 6:4 it said, "And the the president and the priests sought to find accusations against Daniel concerning the kingdom." You see, they were jealous of Daniel because Daniel was watch this. His king was an evil man. He was a pagan, wicked beast. But Daniel was such an upright and honest man. An evil beast recognized the qualities of judgment and Daniel. And all the the acquaintance around the king were jealous of Daniel and they said, "We got to find an error or fault and not mad." Watch what it says. Though they could but they could find no accusation nor fault in so much that he was faithful, neither was there any air or fault in him. And so the only way they could do in there was to find out how he served his God. And all the priests of the kingdoms, they decided, they made the king to make an accusation, which the king would have never done except he had a big head. And he wanted everybody to serve him. And they said, "Well, write an accusation for 30 days." Just 30 days. I want to break that down really carefully. That's in verse uh you got that up, Vicki? That's in verse seven. They made a petition that any any god or man for 30 days save the king. It's the end of the verse. 30 days. Just 30 days. It's like if you just miss prayer meeting four times, one month. You can start right back up again, but just miss for one month. He said, "That's not too bad. I can pray at home. Well, Daniel could have prayed at home. Let's drop just drop to verse 10. Don't we love Daniel? But there ain't very many Daniels today. Now, when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, see, Daniel wasn't an uneducated man. He went to his house and he closed all the windows and pulled the curtains. He went to his house and his windows being open and his chambers towards Jerusalem, he knelt down his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he had always did. a four time. A four time. And let's just go back to the beginning of 10. And when Daniel knew that the writing had been signed, Daniel disobeyed the government. You can't like Daniel. That's not possible for you to like him. He disobeyed the government. You think he's a hero. He's a hero because he disobeyed the government. You know, Daniel could have pray. God never even told Daniel he had to pray like that. There's not one place in the scripture, matter of fact, matter of fact, the scripture says the opposite. The matter of fact, the scripture says when you pray in your house, enter into your closet and what you do in secret, God will reward you openly. So he actually had Bible to protect his own skin. But watch the end of verse 10. And Daniel did as he had a forang. He never changed his religion to follow the law. And he had Bible to justify it. Multitudes. Multitudes in the valley of decision. The day of the Lord is near and the valley. You know why the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision? If you make the wrong decision, you're lost. Luke 1 28 talking about Mary. And the angel came unto Mary and said unto her, "Hail thou, thou are highly highly favored. The Lord is with thee, and blessed art thou among women." And drop to verse 38. And you know the story that you know Mary was going to be God was going to bless her to bring forth Jesus. And Mary said, "Be it unto me. Behold," and Mary said, "Behold the handmmaiden of the Lord. be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from Mary. I want to tell you something. If Mary hadn't said those words, she would not have been the mother. She would not have been the body that God would have used to bring Jesus. She had to surrender and answer the angel before he left. She had said, "Okay, I'm on board. I'll do that." That's right. Wow. Genesis 12, let's go start at verse one. Abraham, Abram, before he was Abraham. And now the Lord said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I'll show thee." In verse 5, "And Abram took Sarah, his wife, and took Lot his brother, and all their substance, and gathered all the souls that they had begotten, and went forth to the land of Cain." If you drop to verse 7, and the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him, thy seed will I give this land, and there shall built an he an altar before the Lord who appeared unto him. In verse 9, Abraham journeyied, going on still farther towards the south. See, God was looking for our father Abraham to make a decision. If you would have been riding the fence, you'd say, "Well, can I serve you, God, in my family's country?" Like, I have to leave my family that brought me up in the church. What would be the purpose of that, God? Abraham, Moses, Hebrews 11, Hebrews 11:24. We see here by faith Moses when he come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter valley of decision choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season a seeing the reproach of Christ greater than the riches and treasures of Egypt for he had respects unto the recoccupants of the reward. Moses, oh, Moses had a hard decision. I mean, he had a he had a Leoan decision. He would have been in more than a million-doll house. He would have been in the palace and he would have hit pick of a queen to rule Egypt. Yeah. He had a hard a hard decision. Moses Moses decision was you never miss work for church. And so he chose the church and let Egypt go by. Amen. Does that make sense today? No. It didn't make sense back then either. Did it make sense that Moses would flee for his life because of something that he thought God told him when he could have been riding in the king's palace giving out orders? No. Made no sense at all. But multitudes, multitudes are in the valley of decision. And no decision means you're not going to be there. First Kings 17. Amen. First Kings 17:8. And we go to 15. We'll just bounce around here on these scriptures. And the word of the Lord came to Elijah telling him, saying, "Arise and get thee up and go down, for I've commanded a widow woman there to substain thee." And he went down and he came to the widow woman. Verse 11. And here the widow woman. She was going to fetch. And he called unto her and he said, "Bring me, I pray you a moral of bread in thy hand." And she said unto him, "As the Lord thy God." See, you know what? This wasn't the widow woman's fault. God Elijah had held up the rain. Elijah had held up the rain. And so people were starving to death and the water and the creeks were drying up. And she said, "As the Lord thy God liveth." She was a believer. She said, "I have not one cake. I have nothing to give you, but a handful of meal in the barrel and a small oil. Behold, I am gathering two sticks which type the cross which is crucifixion that I may dress it and me and my son shall die. Amen. What's the Bible say? If you if you try to save your life, you shall lose it. And those that lose their life shall save it. She was going to lose her life. And watch what the prophet said unto her. Verse 13. And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not, but go do as I have said, but make me a cake first." Now, that's that's a little bit ridiculous. Where was Elijah's compassion on the widow woman? Feed me first, you can die. And bring it on to me. and after make thee and thy son for thus saith the Lord the barrel meal. Amen. And watch if you go to verse 15. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah to the point of starvation. She obeyed. Wow. The widow woman had to make a decision. Now, have I showed you a lot of people that had to make decisions in the Bible? Now, in what world would we think that we're predestinated so we can ride the fence? If you're riding the fence, it just proves you're not predestinated. If you're not making a strong decision for Christ, even to the point of your own life, it proves you're not predestinated. It proves you're not elected. If you would do anything but serve God and God is second place in everything in your life, you don't have to get up and testify for me. I can clearly see where your God is. It's very clear. If serving God don't hurt you, it's very clear what your decision is. Because in every one of those people in the Bible, it was ridiculous. They were beaten, threw in prison, starvation, through to the lions. They didn't have to do it. They did They did not have to do it. Amen. We have another story and we're coming here doing good. Amen. In First Kings 18, this is ahead of the one I just shared where God had Elijah stop up the rain. And and it hadn't rained for many years. And so God told him to go see a Ahab. And Ahab seen Elijah. And he said, you know, you're the one that's causing all the problems. and Israel. And Elijah said, "No, no." He said, "I'm not the one." He said, "You are." And Jezebel, the woman you married, you brought the pagan kings in and all this stuff. I'm not the one that's troubling Israel. It's your lack of commitment. It's your lack of commitment to get rid of all the foreign gods in the country that's causing all the troubles in Egypt. He said, you know, this is a prophet talking about in and a quote here. He said Elijah was sitting there for three years under the anointing and he said that they the crows kept feeding him at the river and he said eventually these pagan people and Ahab they said I wonder where that holy roller is. Why? You know, maybe he was right after all. Maybe we should have got rid of all of our gods. And so they started to hunt for Elijah. And Elijah told him, the Lord came to Elijah and said, "You better go show yourself to those people. They're starting to have second thoughts." Amen. And if we go to first kings 18 verse 18 and Elijah answered and he said I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house in that thou has forsaken the commandments of the Lord and thou has followed Balum. 19 And now therefore I send gather all of Israel unto the mount Carmel and all the prophets all you makeeliever backbone wishy people o bail them. 450 false prophets to the grove to the grove that eat at Jezebel's table. See those false prophets? You know why they were false prophets? Cuz they were getting a free paycheck from the king's wife, Jezebel's table. They were more worried about what they had in their belly than what they had in their soul. Amen. That's what the Bible says. They were eating it just and verse 20. So Ahab sent and all the children of Israel gathered and gathered all the prophets on Mount Carmel. And then here we see in verse 21, and Elijah came onto all the people and said, "How long are you going to halt between two opinions?" You know, I I want to I want to just and this is this is not brother Dale. I I struggle with the same things you struggle with, but I wonder if we compromise as much on our religious faith as much as we have in our life. If our kids do that, will they will there be anybody serve God? We won't need churches in 50 years. We won't have to worry about the government closing them. We'll close them cuz you know when the prophet was here, they went to church almost every day. I know you don't get saved to go to church, but they sacrificed every day. Yeah. You know, we talked about how, you know, how it was in the any of you that were around in the 50s and 60s when brother Brown was here in the revival times, the church way back in the Wesley church. We used to have 10-day revivals. You go to church every day for 10 days and twice on Sunday both times. I was on Google. I was on YouTube and I seen I seen one of the churches in Toronto had a prayer service on Friday. You know that pastor came to me when I went to Africa with him about 8 years ago and he told me, "Dale, I'm considering closing Friday night prayer meeting because nobody shows up." And he still had it on and he still was publishing it on YouTube. And it was one of the first times I'd seen I said, "Wow, I didn't even know he still had it." If we compromise that much on our importance to serve God publicly, publicly. You can confess all you want in your house publicly. Publicly. We will not need no baptisms cuz we won't. That's only publicly. That don't save you. We'll have no child dedication cuz that's only publicly that you're giving your child back to God. You'll never come to church and for sure not for prayer meeting. That's exactly what happened in Israel. You want you know what you say that's just brother Dale. You're going off on a limb. The Bible says that if God never shortened the days in Revelation that none, not even you would be saved. And you know what that goes for brother Dale too. You know I can remember this kid. I never thought twice about going to church on Sunday night, Wednesday, Friday, whatever. That was just it was just what you did. I know I know the devil goes to church, too. And I know I know you don't have to go to church to be a Christian. If that's how you feel, I don't know what you do with the scripture that forsake not assembling of yourself together. And all the more as you see the day approaching. But that's not my confession. If that's how you feel, that's how you're teaching your children, you won't have to worry about them being in a church. No, you won't. You want to you're you're training them very well. They will look at the parents and what's important to you and and what will be least important to the kids. What you do in moderation, the kids will do in excess. What did brother Bam say? He said it used to be wrong to go to the movie shows. He said Satan pulled a fast one in and moved the TV right in on the house. So he brought TV in the movie house. Well, you do in moderation. Your kids are doing access. Now we know the prophet loved gunm smoke and bonanza and he said the only problem with TV was the filth that was on it. So, I mean, there's not no filth on that screen. It's the word of God. There's nothing wrong with the screen. But if you compromise and you just start watching a little bit of filth while they, you know, just a little bit of nudity, then your kids will be nude. If you see Hollywood stars swabbing all over each other on the TV screen and you watch that with your children, then your children will actually act that out because you were okay with it. You were okay with it on the screen, but they'll do it in the flesh. 21 Elijah said to all the people, "How long will you halt between two opinions? If God be God, then let's follow him. And if he's not, let's build a kingdom. Let's get two jobs. Let's buy a new house. But if Baalum, then follow him. And the people answered him, not a word. You know, spirits don't die. Temptations don't change. And then Elijah said to all to all the people, he said, "I even only have remained a prophet to the Lord, the Balum's prophets." And let's just jump down. And he said, "Let them therefore give us two bulocks, and they can choose the bulocks themselves, and cut it to pieces, and lay the wood in the fire, and I will dress the other bulock." See, Elijah didn't even have to pick which bulock he had. He let them have the preference. And he said that let's just decide that the god that answers with fire that he's the real god. In verse 24 and and you call on the name of your gods and I'll call on the name of the Lord and the god that answers with fire let him be the god. And all the people answered and said it is well spoken. Now this is the first time that the children of Israel had answered Elijah. He said what a great hear the prophets talking. He said what this is a message of a verse connected right to this verse said what a great man Elijah was. How he went out there led by the spirit of God and challenged Ahab say bring up all your priests and let's see who God is. And he walked around and he said, 'Well, you know, when when Ahab's God never answered, he said, 'Well, maybe he's gone fishing. Maybe maybe you should holler louder. Maybe he fell asleep. Maybe you maybe he can't hear you. Maybe you need to cut yourself and show your sincerity. And Elijah was mocking them. And when it came to about the evening time is where we're living right now. If we get about one more country going to war, there won't be many places to hide about the evening time and Elijah cleaned the altar and he brought his sacrifice and he just said, "Lord, I've done all that you commanded me." And you know what happened? God answered. He answered with fire. And he here's what the prophet says here. He says, "If you say you're a believer, God will vindicate it." And he said, "You don't you don't have to presume nothing. It's God that will consume you. You don't have to have any pre presume. You don't have to presume anything." thing. He said, "God will consume you." Just like he consumed the sacrifice, God will consume your body because your body is the sacrifice for God. Amen. Wow. Here in choosing the bride, the prophet says, "Many times men and women, they hear God's truth. They see a vindicated and proven truth, but yet they won't want to hear it. And for some other reason, some other choosing that they have the valley of decision. Then face to face with the truth, their ears are closed up to the gospel and they'll never hear it again. Eli, watch this. Elijah gave them a choice which they shall choose you this day who you'll serve. And if God be God, serve him. And if your world is that great, then just serve your world. Amen. here in spiritual and we're closing here in spiritual and neesa he talks about he said you forget who you are and then the days of Elijah and Ahab he said when they had to make a choice who they would serve they actually and and the prophet said in spiritual amnesia he said you forgot that you're a believer that's when you get to that state that's why you don't act like a believer because you forgot your identity. Kar Mia, prophet preached the message, why halt you between two opinions. If God be God, serve him. And if he's not God, then don't serve him at all. And if a real experience of God is what it takes to get sin out of a man's heart, there's only one savior of the world and it's the blood of Jesus Christ who freely poured out from Calvary for the remission of all sin that man has committed. And he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities by the chastisement of our peace is upon him. And by his stripes we are all healed. I want to close with our opening scripture. I just want to read a few extra after that. Joel 3:14-17. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision. For the day of the Lord is near and the valley of decision. I and I want to clarify that the reason the day of the Lord is near is when you make your decision, it will affect your eternal destination. Watch verse 15. And the sun and moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw to shine, and the Lord shall roar up out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and earth shall be shaken. Well, that's happening. Lots of earthquakes, lots of floods. But the Lord will bring hope to his people and strengthen the children of Israel. So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelleth in Zion, my holy mountain. Then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall be no strangers pass through her anymore. Amen. God help us. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision. Amen. I I believe many of us I I I believe myself it's the valley of decision. You know, you know, we sing the song, you know, it hasn't the the the bride, it hasn't worked out exactly like we thought. We thought the rapture would have already taken place. We thought it would happen in the 60s or 70s. But we're still here and there's still grace. That's right. But because of of the way Satan is working, Satan is putting the bride of Christ to sleep. That's right. He's just He is He just turned the heat up like the frog really, really, really slow. And you're going from alive to cooked and you don't even know it. Amen. God help us. Let's stand. I believe and I believe the Bible clearly shows this and teaches this that not only God wants to know where you stand, but God wants the public around you to know it also. You weren't you weren't God didn't just send you to earth to save yourself. But does your family know your your testimonies? Do your family know? You know, I I and I can only use my own personal ones. You can fill in your own personal ones. You know, before my dad died, it didn't matter who came over to his house. Didn't matter if it was the queen or me. If there was church at the church, he went. Okay. You know, this week coming, I have friends that we've known for 30 years and I we invited them to supper and they said we can come on Wednesday night. I said that won't work. Come any day by Wednesday. And it's not about Wednesday, but I just told that visitor that I have a conviction on Wednesday. That's going to church. I don't party on Wednesday. That's right. Amen. And that's what God expects for all of us in in our own way, in our own decisions. Amen. Do you like You know, you know, Sister Dama was telling us when Margaret was over, they went and see the farm and the the neighbor Jeff and Damas went and showed them the farm. Margaret couldn't contain herself to ask the guy. He said, "Are you a Christian?" Do you know that's what God expects? God expects you to speak it. Speak it. We can't ride the fence no longer. There's some things I don't do. Period. Because I believe in God. Amen. God help us. God help us. Cuz it it's just getting, you know, religion is getting less radical all the time. Yeah. less radical. You know, the Bible says that God called us a peculiar. That's right, people. Peculiar. That means you don't do things that the world does around you. That's right. Do you know you can give an example? That anointing is powerful this morning. You know, in the Bible when it talked about wearing jewelry and the braided hair because in the Bible times, if you braided your hair with stuff in your hair, you were a prostitute. Now, that's not the case at all today. But you see how the Bible teaches us that what they what you what the what is accepted in the world of Hollywood, believers don't do because you're peculiar. But the church has got so much that we can just fit right in. That's not who God's servant. That's not who God's calling. Anything God valued, he hid from the world. Anything he covered up in nature was valuable. Diamonds, gold, and his bride. If he wanted some cheap jezebel, they're a dime a dozen. But he wanted a peculiar real lady. That's right. That wasn't afraid of keeping her decency. for him. Amen. God help us. God help us. Man, I I pray to God the rapture takes place. Where will I be in 20 years if the rapture don't take place? It'll be nothing but grace. It'll be only grace. If if I'm still here, it'll be one word, grace. Grace and mercy. Cuz brother Dale, I couldn't do her. I could not do her. And I'm afraid you couldn't either. God needs to come and take us out of this place. Amen. Multitudes. Multitudes. Multitudes. And the valley of decision. The day of the Lord is near. And the valley of decision. God. Jesus help us. Amen. Have thine own way. [Music] Have thine own way, Lord. Heaven way. [Applause] Thou art the Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey. [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I see [Music] Christ. [Music]
