just continue our message from from last Sunday and and uh I I did bring up uh we're gonna show some videos because uh some of this is actually uh uh just hard to believe amen and it's good to see what our Prophet said and and just uh and just uh worship God Amen I believe with all of my heart a hundred percent of my heart so we're going home soon and I believe this is a wrap up of the Capstone and I believe God's changing all of us tremendously and there's some just some just some just some just some morning things that you do before the wedding just some fine-tuned man you get your hair done that's what's happening right now amen and God how uh go sorry God help us Amen to and all I I just uh before just before we read our scripture amen we're going to read Revelations 1 1. man you know brother Pastor Faye preached and and uh if you were gonna watch a video from the convention watch brother Faye first you know I was I was very fad and and convicted and and talked to and everything he he he covered them all you know brother Faye was in a Pentecostal evangelist when he heard the truth the the the Vindication of Christ and he was preaching this message two years before I was born it took me the whole convention to get over that he started preaching this truth two years before I came to the Earth I thought I was getting to be an old man wow and it was just beautiful and and I'll tell you if you do listen to this message it's good until the last drop it's a long message but he said some things in the last paragraph some of the last things he spoke for powerful amen and it's a spirit of Christ it's it's going home time it's not about brother Dale it's not about Pastor Faye it's not about our Prophet it's not even about Jesus in the flesh but it's about Christ it's about Christ amen it's god Jehovah God now we know that Jesus Christ was Jehovah God a hundred percent the fullness of Christ amen but this bad your skin it's just about your skin you know every time God you know well let's we better read our scripture I'm gonna sorry you could stand with me Revelations 1 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ that which God gave up to him to show to his servants which must shortly come to pass and he sent it and signified it by these angels to the servant John let's turn over to Colossians 1 . amen just pray for me I was had all my notes but they were very scrambled amen I don't want to re-preach last Sunday and I'm trying to just go from there on and man first Colossians 1 26 and 27 even the mystery which has been hid from the age from ages and from Generations that's what we want to talk about but is now made manifested to you to whom God would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery oh he's getting more personal among the Gentiles which Christ in you oh buddy somebody showed the hope of glory Hallelujah Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless your word and and Lord bless your bride and just may you just complete and complete and total control Lord Jesus and we just worship and bathe in your presence and we give you the glory for it and your name we pray amen you may have your seat amen and we just uh you know you know we you know and I'm just uh like I said if you listen to brother face you might hear this voice you know you know when you go into a marriage normally at least here in North America uh you know I'm not saying it's like this around the world but lots of times somebody will be buying things for you and most of the time in a marriage in our in our area and much of the world half the world at least normally the dad of the Bride will pay or help pay for the wedding but you still have to be willing to be in the wedding Christ paid for everything for you everything but you still have to get dressed he can buy your wedding gown but you have to wear it amen and you know brother Faith said something that was just it he said many things but it really shook me he said you know in Europe and here we do the same thing you know at a wedding we'll put you know just married and we'll put rhythms on it and maybe soap the windows or do something ridiculous and then everybody Behind The wedding will go and toot their horns and signify there's just been a marriage and there goes the bride and he said I've never ever been a partaker of one of those things where the bride said it's me he said I've never yet seen the bride in the car with the speaker saying I'm the bride I'm the bride he said if you're part of the Bride this morning you don't have to tell the world you're part of the Bride you'll have the same spirit that the world in Christ in you and you won't have to make no announcements man because the everything in your garment but your character your spirit your atmosphere well now it's I'm seek amen I'm she Hallelujah oh it's just amazing amen you know this beautiful truth that we have about god Jehovah amen when the truth is open our Prophet said in the unveiling of God he said you know the gospel does two things he said when the gospel is revealed it shuts the eyes of some we don't want that to happen we're not a part of that and the Very exact same gospel opens the other eyes of the believer wide open amen God help us he said it's done in every age and he said it's deity veiled and flesh amen and you know you know the the the the the the the the humanity from the beginning of time have always wanted to worship the creation brother Dale still guilty of that and if you're breathing this morning you are too but before we go home God wants us to worship the creator of creation you see what I mean we always like to look at something our Prophet said that he said every country is looking for a savior a hero a prophet a leader a uh you know somebody's going to blow the Trump but the Trump's already sounded amen I'm not waiting for the election in the states and Trump to get voted in and it be a new Trump the Trump was sounded before the foundation of the world and I was there some people would say well you know you know uh I'm gonna leave somebody well it'd be good if you're leaving the person but you can't leave what you are amen you could leave a person in the flesh but you can't leave I was in him when he announced this message I was in God in Genesis when he said let's send out a message to the laosian church age I was there I can't leave that I was that's part of me it's not just my Badger skin it was in my DNA I can change my last name all I want but if you DNA me I'm carrying my daddy's father's DNA amen you can leave my daddy but you can't leave the DNA hallelujah amen and God's bringing that you know God has all these people are tools amen tools and I'm telling you I this shook me into the core and I've studied this in past and years past and then you know but every every servant of God is a tool Jesus himself in the flesh was a tool because our Prophet said that God can't die and God had to Tabernacle a body and become humanity and the worship me to show these I'm jumping ahead but he said we know that Jesus Christ was god Jehovah and our Prophet breaks it down he said the Jesus was the flesh but the anointed one was the fullness of the bot God had bodily Tabernacle did not flesh and you know everything their dad never taught them to do that either you know but God put that tool back and he came to Joshua and he said as I was with the 9 16th wrench so will I be with a half inch wrench amen amen that was just a two I used that tool and it's Jehovah but what I've done with that Jewish will put away in the chest amen the message isn't not the spirit is it hallelujah amen and that's how it was with every Prophet every evangelist every fivefold Ministry amen which is to a gift to the people just a tool and you put me if I died Tambora or today one of your brothers would get up here and preach the Same Spirit of Christ and it would be exactly the same Jehovah with a different wrench amen it's beautiful so you know and we do things and it's all right but you know because we're Tabernacle in flesh we we recognize Tabernacles we recognize wrenches but God wants you to recognize Jehovah himself amen and you can't put him in your little box he don't just dwell in our church alone amen you know just the well and your little family alone he knows just the well in this country or Ontario this town he's Jehovah he's a man he's everywhere and we we just think you know you know Pastor Faye mentioned he said and and I I thought of this this morning and is just Reviving he mentioned about how many people he's baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they've stayed in their Church even denominational churches and the people it's only church no he said he said well shouldn't you get them to come to your church he said I'm not getting people to my church alone so I'm getting people to Christ and what he does with Christ is up to him right amen you know when we came back from from Africa to Not tooting my own horn but we had the preacher on the street and Sarnia and and a homeless person lived in a trailer uh four years ago we met him at the the wherever we met him swimming pool and baptized them amen no no George has been here a few times but I don't believe they came in this church once since they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that don't just man it's not about it's a man we think well you know God is God and God will have gifts and Tools around the world and he'll use them through their potential some were given 10 talents some were given three or one man don't judge God oh God help me God help me to let God be God and maybe it's half inch wrench amen you know there's a story told it just just laying a foundation and this helps us to a point but you know there was a huge ship I have it on my iPad and I kept it I got it probably over a year ago and sometimes I will keep something and and then God will say you know and I was in the shower when God's brought this to my mind this morning and you know this huge ship that had trouble with it and it's huge they they show a picture of the the man that's the the we're going to call him the Savior or the the the uh the uh invent of the ship and he just looks like an ant beside the windmill of this ship you know and they had multiple people come to fix it they couldn't fix the ship and so they called the Creator I love it they called The Creator you know I I just leaving this story for a second you know I heard a I heard an atheist questioning a guy on on on God and Christianity and that and he said he compared it like this he said you know the guy that created the computer ain't living in the computer but he knows everything about that computer you just ask him what's wrong with the computer right there am I and this guy didn't live in the ship but he knew everything about the ship he was the creator of the ship and so he went around and listened to him and scanned it he was just there for a bit and went to Head to Toes he hadn't done nothing but my kids will love this part because you know when we hire a mechanic come out to the Tractor it's a lot of money before they take the toolbox out hey man and he went around the ship and then he went over and he got his hammer and a little wrench he went to a certain spot in the ship he put his little wrench on he went Christ never did this to you he never sent you the bill man he sent them the bill it was 500 000. and the ship owner got the bill and he was like me when I get a bill from Delta wow they called up the Creator and they said wow oh we got your Biddle I said yes is there a problem well no the ship works perfectly there's not a problem but he said could you break down your bill you know because you know we've just seen you take like you know we just seen you take this and just unveil it like it was just like I hope you get this from God pictures from God and he said well for the ranch and the hammer it's ten dollars but for the know-how to where to put the wrench and to top with the hammer 400 uh thousand nine hundred and whatever that number is amen brother Dale don't know how to show you God but God knows how to show you guys Christ knows how to show you who he is amen and all I'm saying this morning God's saying is don't get caught up in the tool now now listen when God's using that tool Moses was God don't challenge God that was God period the people that challenged Moses god swallowed them up I'm not understanding the door but when God was done with that tool God went to a new tool and now Joshua head to toe and nobody conquered the world like Joshua because he's God see you know and we could say well this is my favorite careful favorite God you know the denominational Spirit of the age this guy got three he's got him in two he's got them sitting by the father you know but God is a spirit and them that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and the truth and people are seeing the tool as the god and as long as the God is in him like Christ it was the fullness of the godhead bodily that was God but Jesus flesh body is not in heaven amen thus saith the Bible Flesh and Blood don't inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and our prophet's going to break you down a lot more I'm not afraid to go here because I had the prophets message to show you amen and so what God's trying to show you this morning it's not it's just himself but when he can't show you himself without showing him you and Satan has told you a lie that you're not worthy and you're not you're not who you are and you're smaller than you are and you don't deserve it and all this that's a lie because we've seen last Sunday and I don't want to go back and re-preach it but we've seen that last Sunday in Revelations about what was it 13 or something when John seen the son of man in the candlesticks the Bible says it looked like it looked like John said he said it looks like the son of man and we read the quotes last Sunday where it was the Bride In Christ John seen the Bride In Christ in Revelations amen and you're still in Christ if you were in them in the first place amen let's turn to Galatians 2 20 and 21 he said I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and he said the life which I now live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me 21. and watch this this is where we want to go this is exactly my context here this morning I do not frustrate I want to preach on flesh rate God frustrate means to prevent defeat from being fulfilled I do not frustrate the grace of God for which righteousness come by the law then Christ died in vain you aren't part of Christ because you were born in this message you ain't part of Christ because you're a Godly person you ain't part of Christ because you're sitting here today you're part of Christ because God had been this foreknowledge made you part of Christ and in his thoughts before before Jesus even went to the cross it was finished and the crucifixion where he redeemed you back to his rightful owner oh hallelujah it's beautiful let's not frustrate God amen Hallelujah now he said here in Believers positions in Christ he said now if we can and we're going to get so we show him he said now if you can find your position and know God's word that has the promise in it he said that's the reason Joshua and Caleb had no fear man what have we even preaching on Amen speak the word and go forward amen amen you won't speak you don't have to worry you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning and you know that and God knows that you don't have to be afraid of speaking outside of God's word it won't happen amen he said that's why they had no fear he said you can look at this you can you can't look watch this this is beautiful you you Believers that are sitting here and you you want something from God he said you can't look at the sense of reasonings he said you look at the promise God said every seed will bring Earth of its kind period period promise number two amen you don't have to pray about that that's a saith the word of God amen Hallelujah thank you Jesus I read this last Sunday this is one quote I'm going to read again sorry the greatest revelation of all elujah in the prime minister's Vision the greatest revelation of all is a deity the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ you can't get the first base until you believe that I'd say which we're spending a few Sundays on amen Hallelujah the first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ the deity of Christ what's the what's the what's Christ the anointed one the anointed one hallelujah it's beautiful hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Amen in the seventh Church ages he talks about the candle sex and I I was unsure if I don't think I had read this one because I put next Sunday on it amen he said what one like him this is talking about John the prophet's talking about John reading it he said who was this it was his bride one like him watch how it was Holiness of Jesus covering her man we mentioned that about the gospel preaching of the Gospel amen hallelujah one like him thank you Jesus Christ in his church as bride and Christ being one like a husband and wife is one Christ the church in Christ being molded together with one person the same holy spirit it's the things that Christ did his bride will do also you know our Prophet said this he said you know if I had the spirit of an artist I would paint I'd paint that beautiful painting we have in the hall if I had the spirit of Dillinger I'd carry guns man if I had a spirit of I would do that but we have the spirit of Christ we have the spirit of Christ and the spirit of Christ through what Christ did and you don't have to think about it you don't have to fear about it speak it because it's Christ I know I know you're trying to you're trying to but God help a point amen God help us Romans 8 9. but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit and if so be that spirit of God dwelt in you now if any man had the spirit of Christ he is none of his man you are Christ if you're got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen God help us to see what God has you know in second Corinthians 11 I uh maybe we'll pull this last scripture up and then we'll go to our our slide some second Corinthians 11 and I've read this before and and uh but I just I'm going to touch on this here's Paul talking he says but I am jealous over you with The Godly Godly jealousy for I have exposed you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase version to Christ look at how Paul talks there's no coincidence in this scripture Christ but I fear less by any means the serpent the devil will beguile as he beguiled Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted by the Simplicity that is in watch how he says it Christ God is a spirit those that worship Him in spirit in Christ see Paul is bypassing all the tools and he's going right to the Head Hallelujah amen every scripture he says he don't want don't like us and Satan wants us to get your eye on the pastor or the Evangelist or the prophet or or or anybody or your church or your organization or your own Clique or your crowd or even the message you know and I'm sorry for stealing Pastor face I know he'll forgive me but he said and this is just I don't mean to hurt you but he said there's never been the spirit of denomination on the face of the Earth since this message wow now he was preaching this message in 66. last time you seen your dad brother Matt was in Jerusalem in Egypt and he was there with uh uh oh the brother uh no it left me he was there with another brother from Edmonton amen Eugene Browns amen Hallelujah he said watch the spirit we go around and say well you know it it really spoke to me you talk to Catholic Mr warm Catholic to talk to you Baptist I'm Baptist what are Prophet talk about that he was in the hospital said are you a Christian well I'm about just I'll let you know I burn a candle every night I'll let you know I'm I'm a message believer and I go to that message Church but are you a Christian are you a Christian he said this is no I'm you can listen tape this is Pastor facing he said there's more clicks in this message then there is an enemy domination in the world he said when you identify if you're in the message you have to say now who's King you go to who's convention oh oh they're connected with oh oh okay yeah they believe that they lean no yeah I said ouch I said ouch you know the one time you give an example he said he said uh there was somebody out there with the trinitarian baptism in the congregation brother Branham invited him to the front sit with the ministers the things and they came to brother Branham after it he said you uh you uh you you sinned you sinned brother bam said I sinned he said yeah he said he said you invited something on buddy on the platform that don't even have the same God as us he said I did he said yeah yep you did he said he's got a trinity baptism brother your Prophet said that's my brother what God does with him is between him and God you saw it ouch well I'm not suggesting you leave the truth but but let's just let God be God and you just stay being your half inch wrench if God wants to use the 9 16 wrench that's all right with me praise the Lord amen he might even have an adjustable wrench that fix all the different sizes but Jehovah's Jehovah amen back to our scripture verse 4 and he said for if he come and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached or if he receive another spirit which we have not received or another gospel which we have not accepted you might well bear with him amen here's their scriptures saying be careful be careful Christ is telling us be careful there will be many surprises in that day many surprises God knows just let God be God amen now God uses tools the only hands and mouth he can use this morning are yours if you'll get dressed help me Jesus in that spoken word I think it's our first slide Amy and we'll go through some of these fast by God's grace we will amen but I I just uh Christ was Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil Hallelujah and you all believe that and that's why that's why that's was he God God's word which destroyed the hybrid of the devil and he said now the body now his body is to do the same thing because the body is the body is the head and the body is together so if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning you're a part of Christ the anointed one that's right and that's why John in Revelation seeing Christ and he and he couldn't he was trying to see a man but the bride was in him and if Christ the head was the word the body has to be the same thing as the head that's right Hallelujah the way the body operates is by the head that's right let's drop to the bottom there to the bottom paragraph and I love it brother and I tell you that I preach on the same some of this a wow the way the body operates is by the head and the head is the word amen hallelujah God must be the head of Our Lives he must be the head of the church he must be the the head of the fivefold ministry and this beautiful message that we believe it's it's it's it's Christ you you can't just amen you may leave a person but you can't leave what's DNA in you amen hallelujah I'm every bit this message I was there when it was announced amen I was in him Hallelujah watch here he said look Christ is the head of the body is that right well whatever the head is the body is with glory and where the head goes it takes the body with it and where Jesus is the church is with them and he won't get out of his word he stays with the word watches over it and it manifests his church is with them amen God help us to recognize who we are and not be afraid of being Christians not be afraid of being Christ in our day Hallelujah he said here's this one that we we mentioned he said now the Holy Spirit Well it does the work of Jesus Christ The Same Spirit that was on him and he said uh he said then you can rest assured that if you believe in God and believe that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the same Holy Ghost because it's doing the same thing that it did was The Real Son of God and when it comes upon the Sons and Daughters of adoption that's what we're doing that's what we've been doing adoption it does the same thing as it did there amen the world will recognize Christ and you won't have to announce it amen if I told you that I had the spirit of John Dillinger then I would carry two big guns and if I had the spirit of an artist he said I would paint a picture that's the beauty of it if I had the spirit of a mechanic I could listen to your car but he said I'll tell you if you got the spirit of Christ then the works that Christ did you can't believe me why you can't believe the works Hallelujah God help us to see Christ you know so many people you know if it taught it so beautifully and they said we're going to get into this you know uh pull up my tell me when the scripture comes up I have a scripture here I mean I'm not sure when it will come up the next slide taking sides with Jesus here he says not what I've done or I am but what I will be but what he is you see it's all about Christ he said it's all predestination he said I am in him and whatsoever he is I'm a part of him amen I'm saved because I'm a part of him and he he is God and I'm a part of him being his son that's right so it ain't what I've done it's what I or what I'll what I'll do it's what he's done that I might trust right there Hallelujah pull our next slide up Amy I believe it will be our scripture in Mark 14 we have a I believe I put it in there in Mark 14 yeah amen 34. I just put this up on the slides because it's hard for the the on the sound to switch back and forth but watch here you know we can see here right in the scripture and this is also in the other gospels where where the Flesh and we're going to go into this but where the Flesh of Jesus was flesh and our Prophet said that so don't don't run out yet don't don't Wing we'll vindicate it with the with our Prophet amen but here here in Mark 14 and 34 and he saith unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death Terry ye hear and watch now here's here's Jesus before he's crucified and he went a little while and fell on the ground and prayed and he said if it be possible the hour may pass from him and he said Abba Father all things are possible with thee take this cup from me nevertheless not thy will but my will not my will but thy will be done see there's the Christ he oh he had the fullness of the godhead bodily our Prophet said hundreds of times thousands of times that was Jehovah God completely but his flesh let's just just I'm going to show you what's the prophet said but when God was done with his flesh he was done with it the prophet said things like this and we're going to show you coming up he said God couldn't die and pay the price for our sins had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer so it had to be one of us to pay that price but none of us were why are they and so God you know brother brother Ben NORAD preached that beautiful message last time he was here how God came down and and co-mingled with Humanity and so God made a body in Jesus Christ and he tabernacled in it completely in the fullness and that body was Jehovah God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us hello that was God but that word became flesh and dwelt Among Us is still here he was a fullness we have a portion he was the fullness of God but when God went back to Glory he laid down that ranch because the prophet said it like this he said in in Gethsemane he said the spirit of God left the body because the spirit couldn't sin and the spirit couldn't die he said in another place he said Jesus body was a tabernacle that God used to pay the price for sin that's why our Prophet said that you can't you can't make God three like most denominations do but he said you can't make them one like your finger either even though he's one God but not like your finger he's one God in many Tabernacles he's one God in many wrenches because God is a spirit those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth so now we here believe you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're struggling with you believe God is omnipotent and all capable and all-knowing and you're struggling with not only are you connected with God but you're a part of him hello and you had a struggle that's why the word of God said I know the thoughts that I have for you and they weren't thoughts to struggle God never planned on his bride being beat up persecuted suffering taken high blood pressure pills and low blood pressure pills and and downers and uppers and and I'm depressed how can God be depressed Hallelujah that's why in the scripture when Moses came crying to God because the people were always crying to him he said why don't you bothering me for this is just speak the word just speak the word and go forward Hallelujah amen you'll see this let's continue in this scripture and then in 37 so here here the flash the prophet said it clearly like this the flesh didn't want to die of Jesus but his whole purpose on Earth was to die for our sins amen and he came and find the the disciples sleep and Simon's sleeping he said couldn't not wait with me an hour and and watch ye and pray lest you enter into temptation and the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak and in verse 39 and again Jesus went away and prayed and spake exactly the same words that should give you hope and rest this morning there's Jesus the son of God the fullness of the godhead body Jehovah God but in his flesh was wheat in this hour of Temptation and he went to Jehovah God twice it's recorded in two gospels twice and ask God to change his mind amen believe me that was heavy on me too it took me about a year to get over that amen but our Prophet explains it beautifully here here's an example and we're gonna we've got to go faster in this we'll pull up our next quote he said Adam and Eve had the same Spirit he said in Genesis 1 27 one of my favorite scriptures and in the image of God God created us in the end and God is a spirit and in the image God created he him male and female created he them and the spirit form was God and Adam was to take care of the land man let's just jump to the next one and yet man was not flesh he was both masculine and he was also feminine see there's where John could look at the son of man in the Candlestick in Revelation and say but it's well I think it's Jesus but you were in him you were you you think you were you were born and Lael to see in church age but before the church ages even started you were in Christ you could no more be lost than Christ could be lost amen Hallelujah so you know yeah I had somebody mentioned to me a while back they said you know God don't have a feminine spirit and also was the feminine because it was the same spirit I guess you wouldn't have to you'd have to not believe in a prophet's message I believe he mentioned the feminine spirit being in Christ about seven times the man here in the church ages imagines he said thus the bride is eternal is sorry thus the bride is literally the spoken word see Bride and though she is feminine in in destination she is also called the body of Christ it was a very it was a very uh it was very apparent that she ought to and be called that she was predestinated in him the same source and and if you go to the next quote there on this he says uh I just want to read the the a minute drop and he said even so are we Eternal thoughts of him that turn because the many members spoken word seed was manifested in flesh and thus the Eternal thoughts thou manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so-called and watch this this is this is good the capital letters are really good he said you did not become seed by the rebirth he said we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because you were seed is the reason that you could be quickened in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken he's and he goes just to drop the highlights he said God by his death shed the blood and brought back to his own he brought back the spoken word seed the bride Hallelujah and he said you were always sheep you can never be you never were a pig or a dog and turned into a sheep Hallelujah as we were in the thoughts of God and God expressed Us in flesh and so Satan for all these years has been beaten down the bride of Christ in every Church age saying you're not worthy you're not worthy you're not it's just like watch Spirits don't die watch what he did with Jesus Christ himself when he went something if Thou Art Christ our Christ just throw yourself down here and God will raise you up if if you are Christ just speak the word and you'll have bread turn the stones and spread if and that same devil is very alive and well in message churches and he's going to to Born Again baptism of the Holy Ghost Believers for years believe in the full Vindicated word and the Bible is a brand new book and he's saying if you can and it's time that you punch him in the nose Hallelujah show us the father and it'll suffice us and the woman said this this is powerful he said who did he pray to he's talking about Jesus you need to know this who do you pray to you pray to God where is he that's what the prophet says who did he pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane and on the street the one time I he said I want to ask you something when you testify that you had the Holy Ghost where is it at the holy ghost that you got is it just in heaven what do you pray to he said this is a direct quote it's on the inside of you of course I pray to myself oh that's disrespectful brother Dale you're not God no I'm not God In the Flesh but Christ is tabernacled inside me so who do I pray to I pray to the god that's inside of me because he's because my flesh is dead and it's not me no more that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and so when I pray I don't have to get a good phone connection through you know whatever high-speed connection because I'm praying to the Christ in brother now amen I swear we're not building a holy priesthood any one of you sisters brothers children anybody with the baptism Holy Ghost it's fine if you want to call a minister your pastor or whoever and that lots of times will build your faith but it's in you it's in you the our very own Prophet said it's not me that does it hey man it's not even crazy does it it's your faith it's your faith in the finished work amen so who did Jesus pray to Jesus was praying asking God to change his mind because he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was packing God when you go to the grocery store you're packing God help me to be a testimony that everybody will see me that I don't have to tell them where I go to church but they'll just know when they see me maybe they won't see me maybe they'll just hear me and they'll know by my language that I don't curse and I don't talk rough and I treat my wife Sweden and I I treat my kids with respect who do you pray to you Hallelujah he said well we have the spirit with measure and he had it without measure and he said your sons and daughters of God by measure like taking a spoonful of water out of the ocean and he was the whole ocean but the same chemicals Hallelujah I could just about lose my mind he's about the same chemicals that was in that Spoonful is in the whole ocean he said it's quantity but the same quantity Quality quality it's quality but the same quality therefore Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we have to believe that before we can go in a rapture God's God's not coming back for your man we're going to have a glorified body he's coming back for himself himself he's not coming back for this ugly fat guy he's coming back for himself that's Tabernacle inside of him Hallelujah adoption but one day when the lamb came he said the man and Satan man even Satan was fooled he looked around him and said if thou be the Son of God hallelujah and I tied these Rags around his eyes and he said if you be a prophet when I hit you Satan don't you know what God don't put on a show for nobody Hallelujah God never even opened his mouth oh did he ever pull the wool over their eyes sent it 89 in the middle of this and highlight he said if thou be if thou be and that's exactly the same death that comes to church at this place said well if you be the son of God you know you know what you could tell him next time he says if say Satan just hang around find out just hang around a while he can't do it he can't do it he said if thou be oh he said ain't ain't that ain't him he said why look at him he's bleeding he's he's talking about Jesus he's bleeding and some of those soldiers come over and spit in his face he said Satan's watching all this and he said there's no way that's God he said I'll anchor my Stinger of death in him and he said that'll finish it for good he anchored it really good and deep but he could never sting again Paul said there's beautiful scriptures in the Bible death where is thy sting grave wears thy victory Hallelujah it wasn't Paul it was God and when he the last Christ said Elohim Elohim my God my God that this is the prophet is up there he said that was right at the bottom he said that was a man why has Thou forsaken me he said that was the man In The Garden of Gethsemane Gethsemane the anointing left him and you know that he died as a sinner he died a sinner you know that not his sins but yours and mine Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah God God wants you to know not just who he is remember what our title was the revelation of Christ and you who are you Hallelujah and the rising of the sun he said I'm trying to show you that you when you rise when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised you up also it was we were in him the spirit man was in him I was there I was there when he died on the cross I was there when God spoke it I was there when God created us I was there when God asked us Hallelujah this here we got this up this is the rising of the sun he said the spirit left them in the Garden of Gethsemane and he died a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh and he didn't if he went up there as God he had never died that kind of death because you can't kill God I had a message believer tell me that if the Flesh of Jesus wasn't Jehovah God then our sins ain't paid for her but he needs to read a Vindicated message that the prophet brought a tool and when the brother Branham came he brought his old Flashlight and God was shining his flashlight and all the different scriptures so the prophet could read them and bring them to us Matt Hallelujah we read that quote last Sunday where brother Brown said every minister points of light to Jesus Hallelujah in the middle there in 2 42 but remember he went up there with you in him you got it come up to your adoption amen stop being beat up said this and remember he went up there with you in him see God never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon his body of Christ he saw both male and female and it was redeemed in that one body and they were the same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride that's beautiful amen there's no way that Satan could defeat you with that kind of a victory amen with that kind of power no you're gonna he couldn't defeat Jesus when he tempted him he can't defeat us either amen hallelujah God always finds their places gifts always find God's gifts always find their places and what deity was in service for god for death Jesus was deity in service for death to redeem the world now watch this I mentioned this I know you you've you you almost the flesh was a ranch it was a ranch he said they say he couldn't be deity and die the man was the body was not deity but the deity was in the body this body has to perish the very Christ that's in you is the only thing that can raise you up he said it's deity it's God in you it's the exactly the same thing everybody's wanting to worship a person or or a gift or an office or something but Christ is in you who do you pray to the Christ in you amen it's fight you know look at the gift of the Gentiles you know the Jews they lay their hands and and for the gift to come forth but you know in the in the New Testament the Gentiles said just speak the word a prophet said just in the ministering of the word you're healed it's the spirit of Christ amen we gotta we you know you know God wants us to get rid of this religion garbage of this world and and come into him the fullness of the body amen it's Jehovah amen hallelujah he said now notice now the same now that they were they were they rejected they they rejected identified the deity do you get that he said but when it comes to accepting deity and expressing back the same kind of a gift like they did here here you go let me just drop down here he said he said when you identify yourself with deity by giving all that you are and what you are through deity itself Hallelujah he said he's still deity because he is the word and when when we see the word living itself when we know that man can't do that it's deity the word being manifested in man it's Jesus himself the son of man can do nothing in himself I can do nothing for I am a man Jesus said but the father that dwelleth in me soweth me all these things that he doeth and there you are that's it it's not it's not you or me and the flesh but it's Christ in us it's the god that we've died out to and man of course you have to have the new birth amen it's a God that we came from we've reconciled back to getting back to hallelujah it's deity being identified in a man Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus let's go quick here God help us amen hearing the testimony on the sea he said he said the man he can do the son of man can do nothing in himself until he sees the father do it and we'll just drop down he said I belong with you and you don't know me because here here they came and said you know Jesus show us the father and he said if you've seen me you've seen the father he said it's not me that doeth the works it's a father that dwelleth in Me God is a spirit now here we go this is you got this up here I can't I got my paper over my screen he said Jesus was the man he was the tabernacle that God dwelted now he was a spirit without measure he had the spirit without measure and like all the water out there in the sea it was it was in him but in us it's a spoonful out of the we got it by measure but it's the same chemicals Hallelujah amen this is important to know who you are who Christ is and so we're not worshiping some some lie of the devil Hallelujah he said now this is in uh sirs we would see Jesus he said Jesus was born for one purpose and that was for God to make manifest himself through the body and God was Christ reconciling the world to himself and he was a body that had made physical that man and woman can see what he thought Hallelujah Christ seemed to be a durable dual personality here we see this in the middle starting in the red highlight Christ seemed to be a durable personality he would speak something and they would scratch their heads and they didn't understand him he didn't speak he would speak one thing one time look like and something else another time you know that was for to stumble the ones that weren't his you can't stumble yourself you know I can misspeak in something and even my wife can come home and say you know you called somebody by the wrong name or that but I knew what I was saying but I said it wrong but I I was I and the people watching Christ he said they looked at it they couldn't understand it said one thing one time look like and something else another time you know that same devil watches that same devil will say that about this message in our prophet watch that devil recognize the spirit amen he's trying to tear down who you are that's not possible what is it it was Christ speaking and then it was Jesus speaking and then it was Christ speaking Jesus was the man and Christ was the god that was in him it's not me that doeth the work but the Father the dwelleth in me he does the work see well see God will not share his glory with no one God will not share his glory with no one God don't want his bride worshiping a wrench amen those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth see God will not share his glory with us so it all comes by the spirit but Jesus was virgin born and ordered in order to Tabernacle the holy spirit of God hallelujah before the foundation of the world and if it isn't Grace Hallelujah ain't that amazing amen it's good to see what the prophet said amen it just you know teaching puts down deep roots and so you're not shook when somebody comes up you can just say you just you'll just feel something you know that don't sound right and I God is one in a many-membered bride you know the prophet you know all these things you know the prophet said many of the manifestations of Christ wasn't changing his mask amen Christ is sitting here this morning in a many different masses but we need to recognize that and we need to not not in a not in an arrogant way or in a in a and look at the Same Spirit you can never have that spirit and be arrogant and God said oh well bless God I'm God no no no no God never did that himself Jesus Christ he never even opened his mouth here here's pilate he was amazed amen that's how the spirit will be always come to Humble me here here's the king of glory the prophet just in studying this this week and and the the master quotes that I would read by The Hundreds the king of glory come into a manger and a manure pile humility all the time humility what's the bible say that Common People accepted him gladly amen but the the events and the the rich and the colored and the scholarly and the religious they want to Stone them when he said before Abraham was I am en that's beautiful God help us God help us now here calling Jesus on the scene this one tonight in your slide and calling Jesus on the sling he says now you say how could he be God and be a man he said see there is the mystery see in the body he was man in the spirit he was God and now you can see that and all these mysteries in our you should be so rejoice and happy and we need to do we need to live in these these Mysteries that are revealed to us in Revelations 10 7 you know when the seventh angel begins to sound the mystery of God will be finished past tense finish the godhead who he is amen look at Luke 8 10 and Matthew 13 11. well it's the disciples came to and said why do you speak in Parables he said because it's given unto you to know the mystery of God but to them it is it's not given oh beautiful thank you Lord Jesus amen Hallelujah just a couple quotes here and we're going to close amen isn't God wonderful amen the revelation of Jesus Christ to us in this day Hallelujah it just thrilled my soul to think that when John scene the son of man and the candlesticks and Revelations when he's on the island of Patmos that I was there he had a hard time identifying me but he knew it wasn't clearly just the son oh Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus the rise I don't believe this in the overhead I believe we're finished with them in the rising oh actually we maybe have one more yeah we do sorry I'll read it calling Jesus on the scene he said now you say how could he be God oh I read that one already and be man thank you sorry that's it for the overhead Amy amen you know the son he said you'll notice that he made Eve from Adam and he took not another piece of clay but he took the same piece of clay the same word that Adam spoke the word he said he was masculine this is the direct quote from the prophet he was masculine and feminine spirit and he took the feminine spirit away from Adam and placed it in Eve so it's still part of Adam's spirit it's Adam's flesh so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone Hallelujah Hallelujah an adoption the 60s he said the first thing that come up and in the image of God was a man nothing was even nothing has ever been never was never will be created anymore anything higher than a man because man was the image of God and then the man when he was the first man now when he was made he made him and his Arcane his Archangel beings he created man and he was male and female masculine and feminine the same unit they were both man and woman feminine and masculine spirit together God in his mind when he spoke you Hallelujah you know the prophet said when the same time he was speaking let us make man in our image was the same time when he was speaking that he would send the son to pay the price to redeem us back he knew this flesh would fall but he knew the spirit would never fall Justified as if you've never done it in the first place the real you never done it the body did the flesh body but not the real body you would not believe brothers and sisters you would not believe this morning how many message people would come to me and had the godhead completely opposite to what I just showed you what our Prophet said completely a million miles from it a million miles and what they're doing is Satan has tricked them to worship the wrench it's exactly what's happened message believers in the last month I've had people come to me and they're looking at a wrench amen and it's Rapture time and you're not going to go in a rapture with the wrenches your God they're all tools every single one of you sitting here tomorrow this morning is a tool in God's hand and that's the only way God can express his spirit is through you and and how he operates in you but we're the small G he's he's the Jehovah Hallelujah it's a beauty just so beautiful you could just go and go and go the scriptures that are are in the word of God infinitely explain it Christ a spirit amen and we need to come positioned to our place that not not arrogant The Same Spirit is Christ but you won't have to announce to Satan that you're the bride when we come into the the how we should live in Christ when you wake up demons are trembling oh fire to God's you can live to a place where rather than Satan tormenting you that you torment Satan and he vibrates when you're alive when you're awake our Prophet said stuff like that he said when the smallest and weakest believer among you fall on his knees demons can you imagine if you were in a scene and here's Lucifer and he wants to send out those thousands of demons and he's in and he's doing his army organization now you're going to attack here and here and here can you imagine when he gets to his best generals and he wants to send them to your house and those generals come back to Lucifer following saying oh loose please don't send me that plea we bang him you don't send us there you don't think that happened it's happening right now this morning you don't see it it's happening our Prophet said it like this he said when the spirit felt like they were going to get delivered the other spirits in the audience would all go and pile up to try to help me he woke up I need reinforcement wasn't brother damn but there was something inside of me Hallelujah who do you pray to who did Jesus pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane and he said and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost who do you pray to Hallelujah let's stand Christ the exact same Christ that you worship tabernacled in you how that's powerful that's powerful do you no wonder the scriptures say you know the scriptures are so beautifully it's no wonder the scriptures say touch not my anointed and do my prophets no no anointed anointed Christ the anointed oh Hallelujah isn't he wonderful Hallelujah listen
