[24:48] we pray
[24:49] amen amen god bless you
[24:52] thank you
[24:54] musicians and
[24:56] song leaders and
[24:58] everybody man just a few announcements
[25:01] just before we start
[25:03] and
[25:04] we'll have to spread the word because
[25:06] many are not out
[25:08] i made a mistake
[25:11] uh an honest mistake for some reason it
[25:15] started out that it was supposed to be
[25:17] that way
[25:19] but for some reason i thought jose's
[25:21] dedication was this weekend
[25:24] i was convinced of that and it started
[25:26] out that way because it originally said
[25:29] it would be the end of july or the first
[25:31] weekend of august
[25:33] but it was not this weekend
[25:36] and we did not go down saturday to host
[25:38] place
[25:40] because uh
[25:42] it wasn't this weekend it's this weekend
[25:44] coming
[25:45] so it will actually be the 13th on uh 5
[25:48] o'clock
[25:50] and then the 14th so john dank was
[25:52] preaching saturday night at 5
[25:54] and then juniors preaching sunday at
[25:57] uh you know their time at 11 which is
[26:00] the 14th
[26:01] and then i do have confirmation
[26:04] uh later this month emmanuel tombi is
[26:06] here on the 21st
[26:09] 21st which is the weekend after two
[26:12] weeks from today
[26:13] it's emmanuel tombi he's was here before
[26:16] and then
[26:17] moving just forward to september the
[26:19] 18th his brother james is here from
[26:22] lewis nelson's church and then the next
[26:24] sunday the 25th is a filipino pastor
[26:28] from the philippines that's coming from
[26:31] the convention
[26:32] we'll be here on the 25th
[26:35] amen
[26:37] to look forward to that
[26:38] also the
[26:40] convention in ottawa is
[26:43] the last weekend of august
[26:45] to the first weekend of september
[26:48] it is sunday to sunday
[26:51] i believe each sunday there's
[26:53] two services
[26:55] during the week there's just a service
[26:57] on the night so me and mom are planning
[26:59] on going
[27:00] tuesday to friday
[27:03] we will be here for sunday's
[27:06] most week
[27:08] but if anybody can go we know it's a
[27:10] long ways and on all these things but
[27:13] it'll be a blessing
[27:15] let's turn to uh
[27:17] second corinthians 4 and 14 just thank
[27:20] you for coming and just remember those
[27:22] that are out and
[27:24] we may talk behind the scenes
[27:26] about next weekend what we will do
[27:30] because
[27:31] our kids are going to be gone camping
[27:34] and so uh many of them
[27:37] will be out
[27:38] and so uh
[27:40] we're gonna be light again next sunday
[27:43] uh it'll be the other half of the church
[27:45] that's gone
[27:46] and so uh we pray that it's hot and i
[27:49] don't enjoy them
[27:52] sorry
[27:53] i wouldn't want to be in a tent on this
[27:55] morning
[27:56] it would be toasty god bless you sister
[27:58] patricia amen
[28:00] amen
[28:02] we want to preach today or god wants to
[28:04] preach today on
[28:06] uh just loved the songs the girls picked
[28:09] and
[28:10] and
[28:11] the lily song
[28:13] it's just a beautiful song
[28:15] kind of on our scene but i want to
[28:18] title my message
[28:20] what
[28:22] would jesus
[28:24] do
[28:27] what
[28:29] would jesus do and sadly
[28:32] sadly i believe many times
[28:35] jesus would do something different
[28:40] than sometimes even message believers
[28:44] do
[28:46] because we have a religious approach
[28:50] and we're in flesh
[28:53] and
[28:56] and so we want to look at jesus life in
[28:59] the bible now that's a great life to
[29:00] look at
[29:02] and even joseph life you could and i
[29:04] don't know if we'll finish today we
[29:05] might
[29:06] preach this again you know i depend on
[29:08] what
[29:09] the lord leads but i want to show you
[29:11] something so second corinthians
[29:14] 4 and 18 just one scripture there
[29:20] and then we're going to go to matthew
[29:26] while we look not at things which are
[29:28] seen
[29:30] now try to look at this
[29:32] spiritually realm or in the
[29:34] truth that we believe or even in the
[29:36] church setting
[29:38] but at the things which are not seen
[29:42] for things which are seen
[29:45] are temporal
[29:48] but things which are not seen
[29:51] are eternal
[29:53] those are powerful words
[29:56] uh matthew 5 and 14
[29:59] the very very common scripture
[30:02] ye are the salt you are no for uh
[30:06] oh sorry let's go up one
[30:10] ye are the salt of the earth but if the
[30:13] salt has lost its savior
[30:15] wherewith shall it be salty
[30:19] it has sends forth good uh henceforth
[30:22] good for nothing
[30:24] and to be cast out for it is trotted
[30:28] under foot of men lord jesus we ask you
[30:30] to bless your word
[30:32] may you come and minister your thoughts
[30:34] this morning as we look into you
[30:37] your life here on earth lord jesus
[30:40] we ask you bless us all your bride of
[30:43] christ
[30:44] be with your bride around the world lord
[30:46] jesus in your beautiful name we pray
[30:49] amen
[30:50] amen you may have your seats this
[30:52] this morning just uh
[30:54] just an update because of the last song
[30:57] the girls saying
[30:58] uh
[31:00] you know we're few in number
[31:02] i don't know if you've seen this
[31:05] but uh
[31:06] you see the signs of the times are
[31:08] everywhere
[31:10] man aren't you glad we're not religious
[31:13] i'd probably get voted out of the church
[31:14] if i did this
[31:18] that's uh iran turkey
[31:21] russia
[31:24] iran that's who bombs israel how's
[31:27] terrace turkey russia
[31:30] you can't get much more lights
[31:38] ezekiel 38 39 gog and magog
[31:42] the prophet said that when they come
[31:44] down we won't be here
[31:46] now i'm not i'm not contradicting the
[31:48] prophet but just to show you how close
[31:49] it is they've already come down
[31:52] because russia's ships
[31:54] airplanes are already
[31:56] in uh
[31:57] saudi arabia
[31:58] by uh or syria i might have those mixed
[32:02] up that are right beside israel
[32:05] i told you a few months ago
[32:07] how uh
[32:08] russia had actually shot it so
[32:11] just to move forward just and i'm not
[32:12] preaching on that forgive me
[32:15] amy let's go back to our first scripture
[32:17] second corinthians
[32:18] 4 and 18.
[32:22] this week israel has been bombing
[32:24] terrorists over there they were bombed
[32:26] at and literally
[32:29] multiple people dead and they figure
[32:30] they'll be
[32:31] attacking all week so tensions are very
[32:34] very high
[32:36] very very high
[32:38] in israel
[32:39] of course we know
[32:40] what's going on with russia and and the
[32:42] war there in ukraine and and
[32:46] uh by all appearances russia will
[32:48] continue to take over ukraine and
[32:51] ukraine will be no more
[32:52] and
[32:54] but even to move ahead to this i was
[32:56] studying this week and i
[32:58] things are not attractive to the world
[33:01] and this is what our prophet said
[33:03] it's because we're competing with the
[33:05] world to be like them and accepted by
[33:08] them
[33:10] so they look at us and they go well
[33:12] you're no different than us
[33:14] you got to have a big education
[33:16] you got to been around for 35 years
[33:19] you got to be uh the brother of the
[33:21] sister of the fifth the in-laws
[33:24] or
[33:29] i see
[33:31] amen
[33:33] wow
[33:36] so we find out why looking into jesus
[33:38] life here here the first the very first
[33:40] thing that jesus recorded that jesus did
[33:43] in his life was his parents took him
[33:46] to
[33:47] mary and joseph
[33:48] uh
[33:50] took him his earthly parts
[33:53] his adopted parents
[33:55] took him to jerusalem for the passover
[33:58] and jesus stayed behind
[34:00] and he was 12 years old
[34:03] now at the age of 12 jesus
[34:07] jesus
[34:09] emphasis
[34:11] was on god
[34:13] at the age of 12. now that won't
[34:15] surprise you knowing that he was god the
[34:17] son of god amen but then the next time
[34:20] that jesus comes up you know right after
[34:23] he's uh uh you know coming into the
[34:25] ministry he goes out into the wilderness
[34:28] and he's tempted by satan
[34:30] now many people have used this
[34:33] but see
[34:34] here
[34:36] unlike message churches
[34:38] i'm going to attack message churches if
[34:40] that's all right
[34:42] or even ourselves sometimes
[34:44] god god help us oh god help me
[34:47] is we we let me just say it like this we
[34:50] have nothing to prove
[34:54] i i'm gonna i'm gonna even say something
[34:56] else
[34:56] i don't like the song that says i one in
[34:59] a million i gotta prove i'm one in a
[35:01] million i hate that song
[35:04] i don't get to prove nothing
[35:06] jesus didn't have to prove nothing
[35:10] you see if you're one in a million you
[35:12] won't have to prove it it'll be obvious
[35:14] see you'll be salty
[35:16] and see and that's the whole reason why
[35:18] people haven't been attracted to this uh
[35:20] you say well there's not more
[35:21] predestination if we were salty people
[35:23] would want it
[35:25] salt makes you there there's no other
[35:29] draw
[35:31] there's no other draw
[35:32] than a human body no other draw
[35:35] even
[35:36] no other draw
[35:38] stronger
[35:41] than thirst
[35:47] then flat thirst
[35:54] man
[35:55] and so jesus was here the tabern the
[35:57] wilderness and he's tempted
[36:00] of satan and satan is very much alive
[36:02] and well
[36:04] today
[36:05] and i want to show you that satan asked
[36:07] jesus three things
[36:09] and the first two things he did exactly
[36:14] the same answer and that devil is very
[36:16] healthy today
[36:19] if thou
[36:21] art the son of god
[36:24] what if we're going to have a big
[36:26] convention
[36:28] we better invite
[36:30] if we're going to have a couple's
[36:31] meeting we better invite
[36:34] if we're going to be a part of this
[36:36] group we better
[36:38] if
[36:40] if
[36:42] because we have to prove something
[36:45] so satan was coming at jesus saying
[36:48] i don't believe you are
[36:50] so prove it
[36:53] and not one time did jesus prove it
[36:57] see jesus was not somebody with low
[36:59] self-esteem
[37:07] amen hallelujah
[37:10] this is how he said
[37:13] he said
[37:16] that if thou be the son of god turn
[37:19] these stones into bread do me a miracle
[37:24] and prove it i'm going to read you some
[37:26] quotes after
[37:28] where where the prophet says
[37:30] that those are straight from satan
[37:35] straight from satan they're going to
[37:36] read you a quote at the end later on
[37:38] not now we know god can do that
[37:41] but god don't show off for nobody
[37:44] and jesus answered him
[37:46] like see he never had low self-esteem
[37:50] so he didn't have to like hire a really
[37:53] fancy piano player to pound on the music
[37:56] to bring up the emotion of the people
[37:58] to try to do something
[38:00] a certain date you know our prophet said
[38:02] that when god does something he's
[38:05] jehovah
[38:06] and that makes him the ability to choose
[38:09] when he does it
[38:10] because he's sovereign
[38:14] if god wants to give you bread of the
[38:16] stones he gets to choose
[38:19] when if and how
[38:22] because he's god
[38:24] amen so we know it's wrote
[38:26] jesus said man shall not live by bread
[38:28] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[38:31] out of the mouth of god
[38:33] and satan didn't like that answer so he
[38:35] came back to him with the very next
[38:36] question was was exactly identical as he
[38:39] started he said well if thou art the son
[38:42] of god
[38:46] he said jump off this cliff
[38:49] and the bible says now he starts quoting
[38:51] the bible like satan is a good preacher
[38:53] he says and the bible says that his
[38:56] angels will guard thee up and skirt thee
[38:58] up now that's a good preacher we could
[39:01] invite him
[39:04] you know the bible calls satan an angel
[39:07] of light
[39:11] i wonder how many
[39:12] pulpits have angels of light
[39:17] that have the spirit of satan on them
[39:23] jesus answered and said it is written
[39:24] again that thou shalt not tempt
[39:28] the lord thy god
[39:31] and then satan goes and he changes his
[39:33] phrase a little bit because that wasn't
[39:35] working for jesus
[39:37] and he said well i'll give you all the
[39:39] world
[39:41] because see it's his
[39:44] until the millennium it's his
[39:47] he said i'll give you all the world and
[39:49] i'll give you all the glory that they
[39:51] give you
[39:53] that they give me
[39:57] if you'll just fall down
[39:59] and worship me
[40:05] the bible says that we're supposed to
[40:07] worship god in spirit
[40:10] and the truth
[40:12] hallelujah
[40:15] and he said here
[40:19] jesus answered them
[40:21] and he said get thee hence satan
[40:24] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[40:27] lord thy god
[40:29] and him only
[40:31] shalt thou serve you know i've been
[40:33] studying some thinking meditating some
[40:35] on worship
[40:37] and we might preach on that sometime but
[40:39] worship
[40:41] comes from love
[40:45] worship comes from love
[40:47] and the bible says don't love the world
[40:49] or things of the world
[40:51] or the love of christ seen in you comes
[40:53] from love
[40:55] now watch this
[40:57] if you love something you worship it
[41:04] now you can have respects for it
[41:08] see how easy it is to fall into love
[41:11] you know
[41:14] i worship
[41:16] but god wants to be the only one
[41:18] worshipped
[41:20] everybody else is after god
[41:24] amen
[41:27] and here
[41:28] next you know along jesus life jesus is
[41:31] calling his disciples and surprisingly
[41:34] enough it's amazing that jesus
[41:37] you know
[41:38] jesus had been in the tabernacle and
[41:41] jesus had done different great things
[41:42] and he's going to be in the tabernacle
[41:45] here
[41:47] he'd already been in the tabernacle he'd
[41:48] been about his father's business
[41:50] jesus knew the lay of the land
[41:55] for sure god did he said i don't do
[41:57] nothing except the father show me
[41:59] now why did jesus not go and pick his
[42:02] people from the tabernacle
[42:04] well they're the ones that were invited
[42:06] to every convention
[42:09] and every camp means
[42:12] jesus was already there
[42:14] he was building a reputation with them
[42:16] and they were stunned that he knew so
[42:17] much at the age of 12.
[42:23] uh-huh
[42:24] in matthew 4 18-22 jesus called peter
[42:28] and aaron
[42:30] andrew sorry
[42:31] and he said come follow me and i'll make
[42:33] you fisher man fisher
[42:36] amend
[42:37] he picked men
[42:39] iran educated unlearned
[42:42] going to write their name weren't
[42:43] associated to the church
[42:47] had no
[42:48] influence no background
[42:51] did he do that intentionally
[42:54] or did he do it by mistake
[42:58] wow
[42:58] jesus comes and he preaches
[43:01] the sermon on the mount he preaches the
[43:03] beatitudes and tells us how blessed
[43:05] we'll be to be humble and and hungry and
[43:09] all these things and then he preaches
[43:11] when he finishes that sermon he preaches
[43:13] a new law i give unto you
[43:15] that new law was if you kill your
[43:17] brother
[43:19] you'd be charged for murder but he said
[43:21] now if you hate your brother you're
[43:22] charged for murder
[43:23] you know he said the old law was if you
[43:26] had an affair with the woman you're
[43:27] charged for adultery so now if you look
[43:29] on her you charge for adultery
[43:31] he brought he was bringing in a new law
[43:34] into the country
[43:36] when jesus came because see things were
[43:38] changing to grace
[43:41] amen
[43:42] from the law and the law was brand new
[43:45] but it was
[43:46] it was a it was real now
[43:49] because lots of people could hate you
[43:51] but they wouldn't actually go so far as
[43:52] to kill you but the effects
[43:55] were identical
[43:57] amen
[43:59] hallelujah
[44:01] and then we see
[44:03] the the
[44:04] the the pharisee that was popular what
[44:08] just this is i'm not making these things
[44:10] up but i'm going to read some quotes and
[44:12] establish this after simon the pharisee
[44:14] was a big hot shot and he wanted to
[44:17] invite jesus but he really didn't he
[44:19] just
[44:20] he just wanted him there but he didn't
[44:22] really want him to be
[44:24] front and center
[44:26] and so he never gave him a garment he
[44:28] never washed his feet and he never gave
[44:30] him a kiss when he came in he never
[44:31] really claimed them but he did send him
[44:33] an invitation
[44:36] amen
[44:43] jesus asked him a question
[44:46] and you know
[44:48] this is you know we're talking about
[44:49] what would jesus do oh you know the
[44:52] story of a harlot came
[44:54] and with her long hair she washed jesus
[44:56] feet
[44:58] and
[44:59] because jesus became
[45:02] because there was a bit of a commotion
[45:03] around jesus then simon the pharisee had
[45:06] to recognize that well he actually is in
[45:08] my house
[45:10] because all the other people were
[45:11] getting drunk and bumping into the ditch
[45:13] and the lady was out in her feet and you
[45:15] know like the big party was in the
[45:17] center of the house you know
[45:19] but there was kind of this commotion
[45:21] with this woman kneeling down before
[45:23] jesus
[45:24] and it was taking the it was watch this
[45:27] it was taken
[45:30] it was taken the emphasis off assignment
[45:34] because before jesus feet were getting
[45:36] washed he was the center
[45:39] of attention
[45:47] and he made up some excuse that she had
[45:49] wasted this cologne on his feet and
[45:52] jesus told her that you'll always have
[45:54] the poor you can take care of the poor
[45:56] tomorrow
[45:58] but she's
[45:59] doing
[46:01] this for me
[46:02] and then jesus asked him a question a
[46:05] huge question and it's in luke 7 36 to
[46:08] 49 and
[46:10] and 40 and 43.
[46:12] but he actually said
[46:14] if there was somebody
[46:16] that was had done some wrong
[46:20] and the one person had committed a
[46:21] greater wrong
[46:23] it's like somebody stole 100 bucks and
[46:25] the bank forgave him
[46:27] the other person had just stole two
[46:29] bucks
[46:30] the bank all
[46:31] forgave him
[46:32] he said which person
[46:34] would be the most gratitude
[46:38] this is jesus himself
[46:40] asking simon our prophet preached this
[46:42] from the standpoint of the unwanted
[46:45] christ
[46:47] he had him there but he didn't really
[46:49] want him there
[46:50] he had him there but he certainly did
[46:53] not want him the center of attention
[46:56] oh no no no i was going to mess up his
[46:58] program because he wanted to be the
[46:59] center of attention
[47:01] and simon answered this question that
[47:02] jesus asked him and he said well of
[47:04] course the person that god forgave a
[47:06] hundred dollars
[47:07] the one that got forgave the most
[47:10] and jesus said now now let's just back
[47:13] up we said that
[47:15] worship
[47:16] came from love
[47:20] we said that
[47:23] whatever you love
[47:25] you worship
[47:26] so the bible says if you love the world
[47:29] or the things of the world
[47:31] the love of christ ain't in you
[47:34] so you can't love and worship the world
[47:36] and love and worship christ
[47:39] okay now watch this and simon and jesus
[47:41] goes to simon the the phyllis or the
[47:45] uh
[47:46] and the pharisee and he says
[47:48] you answered
[47:50] well that's why she
[47:55] has more love for me
[47:57] and worship
[48:00] than you do
[48:06] see
[48:09] now
[48:10] if you wanted to have somebody as your
[48:17] visiting
[48:18] minister wouldn't you want to have
[48:20] somebody
[48:23] that had a great testimony
[48:26] of deliverance
[48:28] because the greater the testimony by
[48:31] jesus own example
[48:33] this is jesus own example because the
[48:35] greater the testimony the greater the
[48:38] love the person would have for christ
[48:40] which was worship
[48:45] but you know what we do in the church we
[48:47] send those people
[48:48] oh bless god i i never had three wives
[48:53] bless god i was raised in the message i
[48:55] was pure
[48:58] oh we shun them of course we do
[49:01] uh bless god his ministry's questionable
[49:03] i don't think we'll invite him
[49:06] now you know that's the truth
[49:10] uh
[49:11] bless god you know they they've a really
[49:13] rough family and
[49:16] oh
[49:21] and that's who washed jesus feet
[49:25] and that's who
[49:26] jesus said
[49:28] had the greater love
[49:31] for him
[49:34] we don't follow that in the message
[49:39] not in general
[49:41] nope
[49:45] god help us
[49:49] amen
[49:56] see jesus never judged the woman
[50:00] he knew that the woman
[50:02] had been forgiven and loved him the most
[50:06] you know our prophet said when jesus had
[50:08] he had an appointment to meet the woman
[50:12] at the well
[50:13] the prophet said that he had to send the
[50:15] disciples away because they had a
[50:16] religious spirit on them and they judged
[50:19] him that he even tells the story about
[50:21] when he preaches he said when they come
[50:22] back and see them talking to the
[50:24] prostitute they questioned whether he
[50:26] was the messiah because he should have
[50:27] knew
[50:28] her lifestyle
[50:31] but because he knew she was
[50:32] predestinated and she had been forgiven
[50:34] more
[50:36] she would love
[50:37] more
[50:41] wow
[50:45] amen
[50:46] here here's something that i found
[50:48] amazing here in matthew 8
[50:50] 2 and 4 jesus heals two lepers heals a
[50:52] leper
[50:53] maybe it's one leper first and then it's
[50:55] two after
[50:56] and jesus said unto them
[51:00] after they're completely healed
[51:04] he said
[51:06] put it on facebook and youtube
[51:10] and share it with all the churches
[51:17] no
[51:19] he said well go to the church and we'll
[51:22] book a spot for you to testify sunday
[51:31] no
[51:34] i don't know why he did it
[51:36] i flat out don't know why he did it
[51:39] you want to know what he said
[51:41] he said see
[51:43] that thou tell
[51:45] nobody
[51:48] no man
[51:57] that
[52:00] but jesus was here
[52:02] to shine the light and what better way
[52:04] to tell them
[52:09] than a man that had been transformed
[52:12] you think that's the only time he did it
[52:14] in matthew 9 27 here we go jesus heals
[52:16] two blind men
[52:19] and jesus straightly straightway charges
[52:21] them put it on youtube
[52:26] and share it to all the message
[52:30] believers no jesus straightway charged
[52:33] them saying see that no man
[52:40] know of it
[52:42] direct quote
[52:51] that's
[52:54] does that puzzle any abuse
[52:56] it still puzzles me and i studied on it
[53:01] matthew 14
[53:03] and a lot of these are
[53:04] published in uh you luke here it shows
[53:07] the care that jesus had not just for
[53:09] their spiritual
[53:11] diet
[53:12] but their bodies
[53:15] matthew 14 15 to 21 here jesus comes and
[53:19] he feeds the five thousand now he had
[53:21] been preaching to them
[53:22] and the disciples were gonna send them
[53:24] away
[53:26] and he said well you can't send them
[53:28] away because they'll faint
[53:32] the disciples wanted to send them to
[53:33] town that they could buy
[53:35] and
[53:36] jesus feeds the five thousand he said
[53:39] they need to depart he said give them to
[53:41] eat
[53:42] and all jesus did was bless that little
[53:45] food the three
[53:46] three uh three loaves and the two fishes
[53:51] and they had twelve baskets left which
[53:53] these two you know what these twelve
[53:54] baskets show the 12 was the the
[53:57] hierarchies of the apostles
[54:00] in the temple but it shows
[54:03] that all the 5 000
[54:06] had all their filth
[54:08] it was smorgasbord
[54:11] it wasn't like one toast per person
[54:14] because we might run out no no it was
[54:17] self-serve all you can eat
[54:20] do all baskets left over
[54:28] and it was five thousand men
[54:31] plus
[54:32] women and children and then just down
[54:34] here jesus goes and the disciples go on
[54:37] the ship and jesus goes up in the
[54:39] mountain to uh to pray
[54:42] and you know with the story where the
[54:44] sea the storm comes in and the sea and
[54:47] jesus is walking out on the sea
[54:50] and he asks uh that you know of course
[54:52] they're afraid of him and he said not to
[54:54] fear not that it was him
[54:56] and peter said you know those
[54:58] very great words he said god lord if
[55:00] it's you bid me to come to you on the
[55:02] water and of course we know he did he
[55:05] told him to come
[55:08] and peter doubted that it could be
[55:11] possible
[55:14] he just he just couldn't get a grip
[55:16] that he was walking on water
[55:18] and he said lord save me and immediately
[55:21] the bible says immediately
[55:23] jesus stretched out his hand
[55:26] immediately
[55:28] see he cared
[55:30] for the people
[55:31] he cared for peter even though peter
[55:34] for peter to doubt he was in a
[55:36] backslidden state
[55:39] he said why did you doubt
[55:42] immediately he stretched forth his hands
[55:43] so i'm trying to show you the compassion
[55:46] that jesus had he didn't say well you
[55:48] deserve it peter you can
[55:51] we'll throw you the light no
[55:53] no immediately
[55:56] immediately
[55:58] same with the people he said well they
[55:59] deserve to be hungry it's not my fault
[56:02] i'm not responsible for faith in five
[56:03] thousand
[56:04] we can answer like this when somebody
[56:06] says well it's not my duty to feed the
[56:08] world
[56:09] was it jesus duty to feed ten thousand
[56:13] ten thousand
[56:15] fifteen thousand
[56:16] if all the men and women had one child
[56:18] it's fifteen thousand people
[56:20] imagine if i told the land we were going
[56:22] to throw a party and feed all the
[56:23] wyoming and sarnia too she said well
[56:25] that's not our duty
[56:27] but jesus did it
[56:31] amen
[56:32] but he's no different
[56:34] see he had compassion
[56:36] great compassion
[56:39] here in mark 15 32-38 here jesus is
[56:43] preaching again
[56:45] and the people had stayed with them
[56:46] three days so that must have been an
[56:48] awesome message i'd like to have a copy
[56:50] of that message
[56:51] and jesus had great compassion with the
[56:53] people
[56:55] and here the disciples were going to
[56:56] send them away before they were going to
[56:58] send them away to the town to buy and
[57:00] jesus said they've been here three days
[57:03] and had nothing to eat and if you send
[57:05] them away fasting they will faint
[57:11] see jesus had common sense
[57:15] amen
[57:17] and there they asked what he had and
[57:19] they had
[57:20] some a few loaves and and some fishes i
[57:23] think seven loaves
[57:24] and fishes and when jesus blessed that
[57:27] they had seven baskets left over and it
[57:30] was four thousand men
[57:32] plus women
[57:34] and children
[57:35] now he was on a daily feeding basis
[57:40] their church had a big fellowship hall
[57:44] there's 15 000 people in it
[57:48] man
[57:53] here
[57:54] jesus took
[57:57] peter and uh
[57:59] i'm not even sure i don't even have who
[58:01] it was but jesus went up here in the
[58:03] mountain and was transfigured before a
[58:05] couple of the disciples
[58:07] and he appeared with moses and elijah
[58:10] talking to jesus
[58:14] amen
[58:15] it was supernatural
[58:17] and the disciples seen that right before
[58:20] their eyes
[58:22] right before their eyes
[58:24] now watch us they'll watch i'm going
[58:26] someplace with this
[58:27] there was two disciples that went with
[58:29] jesus and peter was one of them
[58:31] and peter jesus leaves them and he goes
[58:34] a little further up the mountain he's
[58:36] transfigured into his glorified body and
[58:38] moses and elijah comes and talks to him
[58:41] and they see him talking to him
[58:45] now i want to tell you something
[58:47] i'm inviting peter and the other
[58:50] disciple to come preach for us
[58:55] right
[58:58] you can't get no closer to
[59:03] and watch what jesus taught him
[59:05] in verse 9 jesus charged them said tell
[59:10] the vision to no man
[59:13] until i'm gone
[59:15] and the son of man is revealed
[59:26] amazing amazing how many people would
[59:28] have came in and got saved
[59:30] with a message like that
[59:32] and jesus said don't tell them
[59:36] i hardly understand it
[59:42] well this shows you totally
[59:44] jesus wasn't in popularity
[59:47] he wasn't in popularity
[59:49] and he never did popularity for the
[59:51] devil
[59:52] he never did popularity for his
[59:54] disciples
[59:56] he never even did popularity for the
[59:57] people he healed
[1:00:01] but i wonder
[1:00:04] if we're doing what jesus would do
[1:00:11] i wonder
[1:00:13] i wonder
[1:00:19] here in matthew 18 22 and 21
[1:00:23] peter asked the lord he's you know you
[1:00:25] can see peter's thinking from the flesh
[1:00:28] he said how many times do i gotta
[1:00:30] forgive my brother
[1:00:34] you all know the story of that
[1:00:36] but jesus said forever
[1:00:39] i just want to forgive him seven times
[1:00:44] and jesus said you should forgive them
[1:00:46] seventy times seven
[1:00:48] which really means forever
[1:00:52] peter was getting weary
[1:00:55] forgiving
[1:00:57] jesus never ever got weary
[1:01:00] forgiving
[1:01:02] man what would jesus do
[1:01:04] what would jesus do
[1:01:07] are we doing what jesus would do
[1:01:14] here in matthew 19
[1:01:16] and it's also recorded in luke
[1:01:18] here the people brought their children
[1:01:21] to jesus
[1:01:22] and the disciples rebuked them
[1:01:26] said
[1:01:27] you know
[1:01:29] you watch
[1:01:30] you watch don't just think of this no
[1:01:32] jesus was the head man
[1:01:34] he's the son of god
[1:01:38] do you watch
[1:01:40] no no i'm being very truthful
[1:01:42] you're watching big churches how they
[1:01:44] keep the pastor removed from the people
[1:01:48] they have 12 deacons and you never talk
[1:01:50] to the preacher
[1:01:52] and it was guaranteed that jerrod's kids
[1:01:54] or matt's kids would never
[1:01:56] ever
[1:01:57] see that man
[1:02:04] well they're bigger and more popular
[1:02:05] than jesus
[1:02:07] but jesus said
[1:02:10] rebuked them and said suffer the little
[1:02:13] children and forbid them not
[1:02:15] for such is the very kingdom of heaven
[1:02:20] but we don't do that
[1:02:22] our pastors don't
[1:02:25] don't
[1:02:25] associate and mingle and even teach
[1:02:29] the children
[1:02:33] they're revelations too big for that
[1:02:37] but jesus revelation was not too big for
[1:02:39] the kids
[1:02:44] oh
[1:02:44] i see
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:48] is is that the truth
[1:02:51] is that the truth have you ever seen a a
[1:02:53] a message church of 300 people or 400
[1:02:56] people in the preacher doing the the
[1:02:58] toddler's class
[1:03:05] or they wouldn't understand his
[1:03:06] revelation
[1:03:08] but they would understand jesus
[1:03:10] revelation
[1:03:11] so you're insinuating that his is
[1:03:13] greater than jesus
[1:03:16] but jesus said that the servant is not
[1:03:18] greater than the master
[1:03:25] see the master never had nothing to
[1:03:27] prove because he knew he was the master
[1:03:32] jesus when he went before pilate in
[1:03:33] matthew 27
[1:03:35] 12-14 and he had multiple accusers which
[1:03:38] were his own people from his own church
[1:03:41] the jewish people
[1:03:43] and he answered them not a word and and
[1:03:44] i wanna i i you know this was brand new
[1:03:46] i should have seen this but you know in
[1:03:48] luke 23 13 and 16 you know pilate and
[1:03:52] herod both say
[1:03:55] pilate says i sent him to herod and he
[1:03:57] found no fault in them and he sent them
[1:03:59] back to me and he found no fault and the
[1:04:01] bible literally says in luke 23 he said
[1:04:05] pilate and herod found no fault with
[1:04:07] jesus
[1:04:11] he said i've examined him before you and
[1:04:13] i found no fault in this man touching
[1:04:15] the things
[1:04:16] whereas
[1:04:17] you accuse him of but jesus
[1:04:22] held his peace
[1:04:25] i couldn't have done that
[1:04:30] not in the past like for sure not in the
[1:04:32] past
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:36] you think of how somebody's blatantly
[1:04:39] telling lies
[1:04:42] in public
[1:04:46] but what would jesus do
[1:04:49] he held his peace so much that the kings
[1:04:53] marveled
[1:04:55] pilot
[1:04:56] marveled
[1:04:58] marveled
[1:05:02] he could have
[1:05:05] said hey
[1:05:10] what would jesus do
[1:05:13] you know i have a minister send me a
[1:05:15] message said somebody said so and so and
[1:05:17] you did so and so and i sent them right
[1:05:19] back no no
[1:05:23] but jesus
[1:05:26] huh
[1:05:27] i failed that test
[1:05:30] many me you sue me
[1:05:32] wow
[1:05:34] what would jesus do
[1:05:37] let's look at some scriptures before we
[1:05:39] go john 14
[1:05:41] 17 to 20
[1:05:43] and even the spirit of truth that the
[1:05:44] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:05:47] him not neither knoweth him not
[1:05:50] but ye know him for he dwelleth in you
[1:05:54] and ye shall be
[1:05:57] in you
[1:05:58] and i will not leave the you comfortest
[1:06:01] and i will come unto you yet a little
[1:06:03] while and the world sees me no more but
[1:06:05] you see me
[1:06:06] because i live
[1:06:09] ye shall live
[1:06:11] also
[1:06:13] hallelujah
[1:06:14] and that day shall
[1:06:16] know
[1:06:18] and at that day you shall know that i am
[1:06:21] in the father
[1:06:23] we are christ is in the father
[1:06:25] and ye are in me
[1:06:28] we are in christ and christ is in you
[1:06:34] now if all those things are happening
[1:06:37] at that day you shall know that i am in
[1:06:40] the father that's christ talking as
[1:06:42] jesus is talking
[1:06:43] and ye are in me
[1:06:46] and i am in you
[1:06:51] then you don't have to don't listen to
[1:06:53] one thing that somebody says just watch
[1:06:55] your life
[1:07:01] that's how they operate
[1:07:03] you know if you girls ever want to get
[1:07:06] married watch how they operate around
[1:07:07] the kids
[1:07:09] and their grandma
[1:07:12] their old grandma
[1:07:18] that's how they'll operate around you
[1:07:21] behind the scenes
[1:07:23] see if this scripture is true verse 20
[1:07:26] then we have to be exactly
[1:07:28] what would jesus do
[1:07:40] romans 8 1-11 and then verse 14.
[1:07:44] i'll start with one romans 8. and there
[1:07:47] is therefore no condemnation to them
[1:07:48] which are in christ now we're in christ
[1:07:52] so see they're no condemnation you don't
[1:07:54] have nothing to prove
[1:07:56] you don't have to prove to me you don't
[1:07:58] have to prove to your brother and sister
[1:08:00] that's why i hate that song would never
[1:08:02] sing that song here
[1:08:04] if it i have anything to say with it and
[1:08:07] but you don't have nothing to prove to
[1:08:08] the world
[1:08:10] you're
[1:08:12] you're just christ
[1:08:15] i'm going to show you where that's all
[1:08:17] you need to attract the world by what
[1:08:19] our prophet said
[1:08:24] to them which are in christ jesus who
[1:08:26] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:08:28] spirit see it's this flesh that gets in
[1:08:30] the way
[1:08:31] it's his flesh that wants popularity
[1:08:33] it's his flesh that things are
[1:08:34] revelations too great for the kids it's
[1:08:37] our flesh that thinks if we hire the
[1:08:38] fake name preachers that will have a
[1:08:40] more god-led spirit
[1:08:44] but we don't know that the same holy
[1:08:45] ghost is in every man and every woman
[1:08:49] not that you're going to have woman
[1:08:50] preachers of course not that's but
[1:08:53] you could have the smallest preacher so
[1:08:56] even let you say well
[1:08:58] like what would jesus do now our prophet
[1:09:01] tells the story about when he went to
[1:09:03] pentecost and he was so sport midnight
[1:09:07] poor oh
[1:09:08] nobody knows what midnight for us
[1:09:10] he never had and he slept in the
[1:09:13] cornfield
[1:09:15] and he talks about how he did his
[1:09:16] clothes so he wasn't wrinkled and and
[1:09:18] all these things i'm talking i'm saying
[1:09:21] you have no change in your ashtray
[1:09:23] you're poor
[1:09:24] like nothing
[1:09:29] and he was like 20.
[1:09:33] you go back and check this story
[1:09:36] he was unknown
[1:09:39] he stunk
[1:09:41] our prophet he stopped in a cornfield no
[1:09:44] it was hot and humid just like today
[1:09:46] he had b.o
[1:09:49] he had mud on his clothes
[1:09:52] and his shirt and trousers never matched
[1:10:02] and god let pentecost
[1:10:05] to say there's a william branham here
[1:10:08] and we want him to come forth and
[1:10:11] minister
[1:10:12] and the prophet slid down on his seat
[1:10:15] and he slid down more
[1:10:17] and he slid down more and the guy said
[1:10:19] what did the guy send me finish
[1:10:21] so you got leprosy what's the matter
[1:10:23] with you
[1:10:25] he said well don't tell them they said
[1:10:27] they're asking for me to come forward
[1:10:29] and take a look at my clothes like
[1:10:32] they go hey see here
[1:10:35] he's right here he's
[1:10:37] he's
[1:10:41] and now we're message believers
[1:10:44] and we have the anointing of god the
[1:10:46] revealed work the seals are open now
[1:10:49] they weren't open then which made this a
[1:10:51] brand new book
[1:10:53] to all
[1:10:55] the fivefold ministries that had the
[1:10:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:59] two let me read to all
[1:11:02] the fivefold ministry that have the
[1:11:04] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:07] but we would never ask
[1:11:09] a 19 or 20 year old boy that had b.o mud
[1:11:13] on his pants and his shirt and trousers
[1:11:15] never matched and we'd never heard him
[1:11:17] preach before
[1:11:21] to come and preach at the camp meeting
[1:11:26] we'd never do it we would never
[1:11:28] just admit it
[1:11:30] it would never
[1:11:31] happen
[1:11:38] why did god have that recorded in the
[1:11:40] message
[1:11:46] because we don't believe that
[1:11:49] flat out don't believe that
[1:11:52] not by our actions maybe i hope we
[1:11:54] believe that
[1:11:55] but in the whole
[1:11:58] no
[1:11:58] not even close
[1:12:03] wow
[1:12:05] yep
[1:12:06] wow
[1:12:08] and
[1:12:10] the prophet talks about how he preached
[1:12:14] it wasn't a perfect message
[1:12:17] that's by his own testimony they don't
[1:12:20] throw rocks at me at eggs he says how it
[1:12:23] was
[1:12:24] because in great detail right anybody
[1:12:26] that's heard it
[1:12:28] go back and look it up
[1:12:30] and god sent multiple people to invite
[1:12:33] them to multiple people
[1:12:35] multiple people passers
[1:12:38] that never had the revelation of the
[1:12:41] seals were opened and the bible was a
[1:12:42] new book went to this hillbilly
[1:12:46] that was 19 or 20
[1:12:48] that had b.o unmatching trousers and mud
[1:12:51] on his fence
[1:12:54] and said come and preach for him and
[1:12:56] when he did it because of his
[1:12:57] mother-in-law god almost killed him
[1:12:59] well jay he killed his wife
[1:13:01] and his daughter
[1:13:07] i wonder what god thinks about some of
[1:13:08] these ministers that wouldn't do the
[1:13:10] same thing today
[1:13:12] if god don't
[1:13:14] comfort me
[1:13:17] they think about that
[1:13:20] see they're not depending
[1:13:22] on this the spirit man they're not
[1:13:24] dependent on the holy ghost they're
[1:13:26] depending on the strong arm of flesh
[1:13:31] he knows how to do it
[1:13:34] you don't have to know how to do it god
[1:13:35] knows how to do it
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:40] for the law of the spirit
[1:13:42] of life in christ jesus has made us free
[1:13:46] to the law of sin and death and that the
[1:13:48] law could not do
[1:13:49] that was weak through the flesh weak
[1:13:51] through the flesh but we believe the
[1:13:53] flesh is strong
[1:13:54] i mean the strong ones of us
[1:13:57] god sending his own son in the likeness
[1:14:00] of sinful flesh and sin condemned
[1:14:03] sin in the flesh the righteousness of
[1:14:05] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[1:14:07] walk after the who walk not after the
[1:14:09] flesh but after the spirit
[1:14:11] verse verse five for they that are up
[1:14:14] after the flesh
[1:14:15] do mine the things of the flesh that's
[1:14:18] about where most of the people are
[1:14:21] but they that are after the spirit mind
[1:14:23] the things that are after the spirit
[1:14:25] you can tell by how salty people are
[1:14:27] attracted to it see like if you already
[1:14:29] got hollywood in your house
[1:14:31] and you're gonna come and watch
[1:14:32] hollywood at church well like
[1:14:34] you can just be hollywood
[1:14:42] for be not carnally minded is death
[1:14:46] death
[1:14:48] in the church
[1:14:51] but be spiritually minded
[1:14:53] is life and peace because the carnal
[1:14:56] minor is enmity against god for it is
[1:14:59] not subject to the law of god neither
[1:15:01] indeed can be so when they that are in
[1:15:04] the flesh cannot please god but ye
[1:15:07] are not in the flesh but in the spirit
[1:15:09] and if so
[1:15:10] that spirit of god that dwells in you
[1:15:12] now if any man hath not the spirit of
[1:15:14] christ
[1:15:16] he ain't his
[1:15:18] you can tell that by his life
[1:15:22] and if christ being you
[1:15:24] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:15:27] spirit of
[1:15:28] but the spirit is life because of
[1:15:30] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[1:15:33] is raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[1:15:35] in you he that raised up christ
[1:15:38] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:15:41] mortal bodies by the spirit that
[1:15:42] dwelleth
[1:15:43] in you
[1:15:45] and then verse 14.
[1:15:48] he's going to skip to 14.
[1:15:52] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:15:55] god
[1:15:57] there you are
[1:16:01] you're the sons of god
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:07] wow god help us let's just close with
[1:16:09] some
[1:16:10] read some uh just some short quotes here
[1:16:13] and and god keeping his word
[1:16:19] amen he's talking about uh false uh
[1:16:23] he was talking about people reading
[1:16:25] church literature and not the bible
[1:16:27] magazines and he said it's just it's as
[1:16:30] false as reading bad magazines
[1:16:33] and then he said i traveled to the
[1:16:34] jungles and i've seen which doctors and
[1:16:37] them challenge me out there
[1:16:38] and do all this kind of things
[1:16:41] the devil do all these kind of signs the
[1:16:43] devil
[1:16:44] no this is where i showed you watching
[1:16:46] how he would do it watch him take a
[1:16:49] stick and hold it in the air and lay it
[1:16:51] down and make it walk away
[1:16:53] like a snake crawling or turn back
[1:16:55] around and look at glass
[1:16:58] glass of wine
[1:17:01] of water turned it into purple looking
[1:17:04] colored like wine and wanted me to drink
[1:17:07] it and then the same group said
[1:17:11] watch this satan knows the bible really
[1:17:13] well they said drag quote you can get it
[1:17:15] off my ipad
[1:17:17] the lord told them
[1:17:19] of all them
[1:17:20] sensations
[1:17:22] and it finally comes to this
[1:17:25] said
[1:17:26] now watch how
[1:17:28] ridiculous this is
[1:17:31] take your mother and lay her down there
[1:17:33] and kill her
[1:17:35] and put her up
[1:17:36] on the body
[1:17:38] upon the altar
[1:17:40] and i'll raise her up
[1:17:42] on the third day
[1:17:44] because see the bible says that the dead
[1:17:46] will rise
[1:17:48] he said it is written
[1:17:50] praise see now here's satan no remember
[1:17:54] the prophet said this was the devil he
[1:17:55] said for it is written
[1:17:57] we got bible for this present your
[1:17:59] bodies a living sacrifice
[1:18:03] so you can go kill your mom and god will
[1:18:05] make her a living sacrifice
[1:18:08] and put your mother there
[1:18:10] and the authorities had to come
[1:18:12] and take him
[1:18:14] for killing his mother certainly the man
[1:18:17] came to himself in one of these
[1:18:19] uh
[1:18:20] situations pouring wine into water and
[1:18:24] stuff like that and the cornstarch
[1:18:26] walking away and all this kind of stuff
[1:18:29] is
[1:18:30] of
[1:18:33] the devil
[1:18:42] certainly it is
[1:18:43] god don't need
[1:18:45] nothing
[1:18:51] god don't need nothing he don't need you
[1:18:54] nothing to prove
[1:18:56] but the bible and the holy ghost and
[1:18:59] there
[1:19:01] and that's here to vindicate the
[1:19:03] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:19:06] but we won't have a convention
[1:19:12] unless we invite the most popular
[1:19:14] 10 preachers in the world and post it on
[1:19:17] youtube
[1:19:21] but a prophet said god don't need it
[1:19:24] now that is
[1:19:26] 57036 god keeping his word number one
[1:19:29] sermon
[1:19:30] it's here
[1:19:31] totally available for anybody i can
[1:19:34] print it off
[1:19:36] our printer wouldn't work today so i'm
[1:19:38] reading off the ipad
[1:19:42] but you see the world
[1:19:44] is
[1:19:46] you see
[1:19:47] when i studied it but you see as it is
[1:19:50] in the world
[1:19:51] so is it in
[1:19:54] the church
[1:19:56] now if that prophet was preaching today
[1:19:58] he would say the message
[1:20:00] churches
[1:20:01] so as it is in the world so is it is in
[1:20:05] the church they are trying to build
[1:20:07] something but god don't need your help
[1:20:11] to build his kingdom
[1:20:13] now you can't get much plainer than that
[1:20:16] god don't need your help to build his
[1:20:18] kingdom god just wants you to preach the
[1:20:20] word he'll do the building he's the
[1:20:23] architect
[1:20:25] you got the plants laid out here
[1:20:29] and that's oneness of unity 58
[1:20:36] and here's my last quotes i i got a few
[1:20:38] of them and this was in uh 60 162
[1:20:42] message let your lights will shine and
[1:20:44] i'm just going to read some one-liners
[1:20:46] what he said in here about how we are
[1:20:49] you just think about
[1:20:52] our churches
[1:20:53] and how we help god
[1:20:55] get god on the scene
[1:20:58] and our prophet said we don't need to do
[1:20:59] none of that
[1:21:03] but we do it
[1:21:06] and so by doing so we're not doing what
[1:21:08] jesus would do
[1:21:10] man
[1:21:11] so
[1:21:12] he's talking about advertisement so he
[1:21:14] said i thought about advertisement how
[1:21:16] advertisement pays off and here's
[1:21:18] paragraph 97 so he says if it pays off
[1:21:21] for that i'll begin to think on that and
[1:21:24] why don't christians
[1:21:26] christianity pay off to advertise
[1:21:30] and he says so you believe
[1:21:32] that christians
[1:21:33] so i believe that christians are god's
[1:21:35] billboard and i believe that every one
[1:21:37] of us are his billboard and we don't
[1:21:39] have to do so much carrying on
[1:21:42] about this as we do
[1:21:45] just simply live such a life
[1:21:49] that will make the people hungry
[1:21:53] to be like you
[1:21:55] see if you're acting like hollywood and
[1:21:57] you got to have the best speaker and the
[1:21:59] best piano player and the best song
[1:22:01] leader and you're just well like we
[1:22:03] might as well just hire rock stars
[1:22:05] so they're practiced up
[1:22:07] well of course they would sing gospel
[1:22:09] songs
[1:22:10] but they wouldn't miss any notes
[1:22:14] no like believe me there's nothing wrong
[1:22:16] with being perfect
[1:22:18] but that's not
[1:22:19] that don't get god on the scene
[1:22:22] now the only way the world will ever see
[1:22:25] christ is when he sees they see him
[1:22:28] in you
[1:22:30] and in me
[1:22:31] and remember each of you from here
[1:22:33] tonight remember that you are god's
[1:22:35] billboard and you're you're the
[1:22:37] advertising agent you are the work the
[1:22:40] now the world will look at you
[1:22:44] and will they see
[1:22:46] and will they see
[1:22:47] christ
[1:22:49] so they can't see where they got no more
[1:22:54] here let me just read a bit of this
[1:23:00] but there are so many that the father
[1:23:02] has drawn that are hungry and thirsting
[1:23:04] for god to find god and yet they don't
[1:23:07] know where to find god
[1:23:09] because those who are supposed to be
[1:23:11] billboards have so much smut
[1:23:15] with the life of the world
[1:23:17] till they can't see
[1:23:19] where they got any more than what
[1:23:21] they've already got themselves
[1:23:24] they live like the world they talk like
[1:23:26] the world they sing like the world
[1:23:29] and they dress like the world
[1:23:34] he said we ought to today we should be
[1:23:36] in the church
[1:23:37] we should be the church
[1:23:39] church be today we should be so
[1:23:42] such a condition that it would cause the
[1:23:44] whole world
[1:23:46] can you imagine
[1:23:47] we should be in such a condition
[1:23:49] that we would cause the whole world
[1:23:55] to want to come here
[1:23:58] we haven't got that problem
[1:24:02] reason we ever got that problem
[1:24:05] what would jesus do
[1:24:08] jesus always was simple
[1:24:10] not popular
[1:24:12] showed compassion always went to the
[1:24:15] old humble children
[1:24:22] wow
[1:24:24] he said oh what kind of person should we
[1:24:26] be if we were the billboards and we were
[1:24:28] sponsored by christ and in christ
[1:24:30] is the one where we get our life
[1:24:33] and we get our strength be careful what
[1:24:35] you do and what we say i i mention that
[1:24:38] with preaching on facebook be careful
[1:24:41] what you do and what you say and what we
[1:24:43] are in our daily life because we are
[1:24:45] sponsored
[1:24:46] by christ and how are we to walk if
[1:24:49] we're sponsored by christ what are we to
[1:24:51] say if we're sponsored by christ if
[1:24:53] someone says evil against you what must
[1:24:55] we say if we're sponsored by christ we
[1:24:59] must be
[1:25:00] like christ isn't that right
[1:25:06] hallelujah
[1:25:08] now you can appeal to the hungry of the
[1:25:10] world that's wanting to see where they
[1:25:13] come from who are they and where they're
[1:25:15] going
[1:25:16] unless you preach the gospel that rises
[1:25:18] christ to a living a living atmosphere
[1:25:22] right here around us now
[1:25:25] if it's just the letter it's just dead
[1:25:28] we don't have to preach
[1:25:32] he said we ought to be today no matter
[1:25:34] we don't have to have a big audience we
[1:25:36] don't have to preach to ten thousand we
[1:25:39] don't have to even preach
[1:25:42] we can be god's advertisement board
[1:25:47] and would win thousands of souls to
[1:25:49] christ
[1:25:50] because they saw christ
[1:25:53] in you
[1:25:55] ye are the salt of the earth and if the
[1:25:57] salt has lost its savior then where in
[1:26:01] is it salty
[1:26:04] hallelujah why don't the world want what
[1:26:07] we got
[1:26:11] wow
[1:26:13] are they thirsty
[1:26:16] a simple clean billboard of christ
[1:26:19] wrote across your life
[1:26:26] he said the people are looking for a
[1:26:27] class
[1:26:28] this is so true i'm closing here just
[1:26:31] momentarily people are looking for a
[1:26:33] class do you want
[1:26:35] do you know that the devil lives in a
[1:26:37] class do you know what caused the first
[1:26:40] fight in heaven
[1:26:42] was lucifer was set on a greater class
[1:26:45] of people get a better class of angels
[1:26:49] and he thought and he had a bigger
[1:26:51] kingdom and a more brighter kingdom and
[1:26:53] a shinier kingdom than michael had
[1:26:58] and he was kicked out of heaven see
[1:27:00] where the class comes from
[1:27:03] see where the classy big operations come
[1:27:06] from
[1:27:07] see where the big classy
[1:27:10] three thousand people and
[1:27:12] three of the same ministers for thirty
[1:27:14] years come from
[1:27:17] all the anointing of satan
[1:27:19] he said see where the class comes from
[1:27:22] stay away watch us stay away
[1:27:26] from class
[1:27:28] he said the hungry don't want class the
[1:27:31] hungry wants food yes sir
[1:27:34] the cold wants fire but uh not a picture
[1:27:38] of fire and the hungry is thirsting for
[1:27:40] god it wants the gospel and the power of
[1:27:43] christ amen no matter how simple it is
[1:27:46] or how unpopular it is the world they
[1:27:49] want
[1:27:50] they want reality
[1:27:53] they already have hollywood
[1:27:56] and a man that's dying and a man that
[1:27:59] knows he's got to meet god
[1:28:02] don't care
[1:28:03] don't care
[1:28:05] about class
[1:28:09] my last
[1:28:10] uh screen here
[1:28:12] now remember in closing keep this up but
[1:28:14] in closing i want to say this that we're
[1:28:17] not god's salesmen
[1:28:21] so if we hire people
[1:28:24] to put on a bigger show for our church
[1:28:28] it's not that we're working for god's
[1:28:30] kingdom we're working for our own
[1:28:33] kingdom
[1:28:34] we're working for our own self-esteem
[1:28:37] our own local
[1:28:39] he said
[1:28:41] we're not his salesman we're his
[1:28:43] billboards see
[1:28:45] don't think you're his salesman he
[1:28:49] don't need any salesmanship
[1:28:52] just
[1:28:53] your life billboards
[1:28:57] let's stand
[1:29:01] what
[1:29:03] would jesus do
[1:29:11] hallelujah god help us
[1:29:15] god help us to be real amen and
[1:29:18] and
[1:29:19] you know we should always be in being
[1:29:21] real we should always be
[1:29:22] respectful i'm not talking about
[1:29:25] uh
[1:29:27] you know i'm not talking about
[1:29:29] being unrespectful even the house of god
[1:29:31] or things like this
[1:29:34] but
[1:29:36] i just wonder
[1:29:39] you think of this just think of your
[1:29:40] whole life
[1:29:42] and you know where you've been
[1:29:44] spiritually your spiritual wife
[1:29:46] just say would jesus have handled that
[1:29:49] the same way with jesus would jesus
[1:29:51] operate our churches the same way we're
[1:29:54] operating our big places
[1:29:56] i wonder
[1:29:58] i really wonder
[1:30:00] when he says don't tell nobody
[1:30:02] what i did for you
[1:30:04] and when he goes to the
[1:30:06] the less fortunate
[1:30:10] and the kids and different things i just
[1:30:12] wonder
[1:30:14] god help us
[1:30:17] you know if we're in the flesh
[1:30:19] we'll look to these things
[1:30:22] you know
[1:30:23] you can you can tell it hugely
[1:30:27] you know when i know
[1:30:29] and it's factual
[1:30:31] you should never ask who's preaching
[1:30:34] it's actually god preaching
[1:30:37] as long as you have confidence that the
[1:30:39] person preaching has the holy ghost he
[1:30:41] does have to have the baptism of the
[1:30:44] holy ghost
[1:30:46] but besides that
[1:30:48] are you looking for signs and wonders
[1:30:50] where the prophet called them the devil
[1:30:53] are you look at the devil you know he
[1:30:55] said when you know uh
[1:30:57] you know lord we would like to see a
[1:30:59] sign he said the same satan
[1:31:01] that asked jesus for signs when he
[1:31:03] tempted him in the wilderness
[1:31:05] of course we believe god does signs
[1:31:08] but that's not the jesus we're chasing
[1:31:10] after
[1:31:11] you know we can chase after a hollywood
[1:31:13] jesus a show off jesus a popular jesus
[1:31:16] an educated jesus that's that's a pretty
[1:31:19] good one
[1:31:20] an educated jesus
[1:31:22] we know we memorize jesus
[1:31:25] a well speaking a well-dressed jesus
[1:31:29] when our very own prophet
[1:31:34] never dressed like most would today
[1:31:37] people churches have special meetings
[1:31:39] they would go out and rent a suit or
[1:31:41] tuxedo
[1:31:42] because it was
[1:31:46] and our prophet's day his coat never
[1:31:48] matched his pants
[1:31:50] when our prophet first got saved he had
[1:31:53] a coat
[1:31:54] you should go back and read the
[1:31:55] beginning of his life story he had a
[1:31:57] coat that had a big burn hole in it and
[1:31:59] he would carry his arm the wrong way and
[1:32:00] shake hands with the wrong hat
[1:32:03] because he was covering a cold
[1:32:06] i wonder if this message has just got
[1:32:08] rich
[1:32:10] we're just rich we don't want that poor
[1:32:12] stuff
[1:32:13] would would we hire a preacher that's
[1:32:15] got a hole in his coat that he's got
[1:32:17] like when he walks out from the pope and
[1:32:18] he's got to do this because
[1:32:20] he said no we wouldn't hide
[1:32:25] but then we say we
[1:32:27] what would jesus do
[1:32:30] god help us amen
[1:32:32] god help us
