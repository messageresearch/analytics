true amen a greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world amen amen we're just going to ask you to have your seats and brother Carson's got a little something for us this morning amen Lord bless you all happy Father's Day I have something here that well it sometimes excuse me sometimes we read stories sometimes we hear people tell you things but this is something that I experienced myself I didn't read it it happened and it's a testimony to me that I would like to share because there is a such thing called ripple effect as little kids may not want no RI effect mom or dad to take you and you get a big pond of water you throw a rock and the ripple effect goes both ways there you go goes everywhere so the riple effect means when the truth and life of Jesus Christ we're talking spiritual because we are believers right so we want to have Believers riple effect from H as a Believer as a as a Christian and it says when the truth and life of Jesus Christ are experienced by the one person and has transformed their life to such extent that the ripple effect touches others and that could go on for a long time yes sir so what really happened was and when I read this until it come out and I said this is a good time to speak about this is Father's day because us fathers will do something and a ripple will effect many years later maybe not to our kids but to our friends so when we were young we've always had family prayer and we had friends that did not go to church but there was one friend that I had he came to church he came to our house we would have supper and my dad would say kirson your friend is welcome to stay we're going to have family devotions where he's welcome to go outside and wait for you that was pretty fair he didn't push him out he didn't stay stay so that was fine he stayed many times so we're going to say I want to say about 45 years later from that time I had a phone call a couple years ago maybe two years ago from a brother who went and worked in a small town and he met the supervisor and he said to the supervisor he said so did you grow up here he no he said I grew up in a town called grandfalls Windsor Newan Windsor and the brother said so you must know Carson Samson he said I certainly do and he said really he said yeah he said is Dad as he was as the world would portray it his dad was a religious man right and in other words he was a Christian man his dad was a very Christian man he said I do not forget it 45 46 years later it was Ste that young man Earth of what was said he said his dad always said family prayer and he said he would include me or else he would ask me if I wanted to leave and that man grew up without family prayer with a bad life but 45 to 4 6 I'm not quite sure I was when that happened and he he still remembered what went on Amen so the riple effect from my dad was still going in that man and I would say there's other people because it was eight of us siblings kids we've all had friends over and they all and when when I got married we had children and we did the same thing to our children's friends when they come over they would we could stay or walk and some would stay some wouldn't but my point is is the ripple effect how we behave so I thought as fathers uh we would do things with our children that they will not forget in a long time it would impress something on their art and if our children gets wandered away there's still something that's right in their Earths that would bring them back to the Lord so I thought I would share that this morning the riple effect it anybody you meet and I want to just say something about brother Dale I met some people since I've been here and one guy I said do you know Dale langstaff yeah he said he's a different person and I walked away and I said to I said to my wife I said I met this guy and he said that but day was a different person and I thought about it and I said yeah a different person we all have different ways different things about us but he's seen something different in that man and it didn't forget him so as I was looking at this a lot of things come to me about different people and so you how some little thing you might have said to that man I know that he used to go he used to come around Petrolia church sometimes so maybe it at that time I don't know I never got into to it but the ripple effect and I thought it would be great because even in our normal lives as yesterday we experienced yesterday there was people there yesterday to the to the celebration for me yesterday that I did not expect to be there right true but they sat with Believers sister Joanie and your mom they sat there and other sisters they sat there together and what was said I don't know but they were together mingling something could be said there the ripple effect that they will not forget so i i u I thought it was a good thing the ripple effect I mean even better Jarett you got a business you people that you talk to brother bar travels on the road you meet different people brother gar there is a security guard meet so many people coming in on the jobs I know cuz I see them they come in and these people come on jobs and they're all up they got lot so many issues but if they see brother gar with his Bible or you see brother G me mention something to him they'll walk away but they will not forget that security guard the little things they do not forget I know on jobs and some people come to me don't forget what you said I remember that way back so in our lives we we got to be very careful how we talk and how we treat people we I'm saying we I'm not saying you or I I said we as a group of Believers a Christian display our Christian Life Christian Life is uh I've been looking at that too and there's a lot of things in a Christian Life it's not just going to church there's more to going to church there's a lot of things to cover there and your your life is displayed but ranam said you do not have to preach he said you live a life and he said people will see how you live sister Patricia taking care of people working in the schools you you don't know they see people with a a sister with a dress on but there's some I've seen many people with dresses on but soon as you turn around you knew right away the earrings and makeup but when sister Patricia turned around there no earrings and makeup they see something different and my wife when we worked on the construction and doing jobs and same thing you so your rip will affect even you our parents so I thought for the today as a father it was uh where I'd seen it with my own dad and right to this day I hasn't had a chance to tell my dad that yet so I'm hoping when I go home I will tell him how what happened when we were young right up to now and still affected him so thank you for your time and the care wonderful it's so so true I mean sometimes you cross paths with people and you know I've had different people work for me and you know they might be come and gone and you just sometimes you ask the Lord like why might have only been a month it might have been a couple weeks you know sometimes you never you never know but you know he

it's a privilege to fellowship with you and when you go back home you greet everybody for us we love them there and we were just there for Pastor John's uh uh retire well change in life and and and and it was wonderful and just the people are amazing and you know it's great to have friends you know you know our society I mentioned this last night at brother Carson that was a beautiful sistership Shar beautiful and you know we have a problem in our society today is we celebrate people when they die it was we went to a wedding last Saturday a week ago somebody from MIchigan they said it's sure nice to see you not at a funeral you know but we have a lot of things to celebrate besides funerals but because our society is selfish and we think about I well it's not me then we don't celebrate other people we should celebrate other people when they get a great job or get a great bank account or build a new house or buy a new car or just just be happy be happy for somebody else it wasn't you but be happy for them amen your day will come around don't worry about your day amen just be happy you know and you know our whole relationship here God made us for fellowship and our Prophet said that you know when he spoke Elohim he he existed alone but when he had us in his thoughts he was no more alone he was no longer the self-existing one he dwelt with his family and what the family was was celebration he celebrated a new birth he celebrated a birthday he celebrated an anniversary amen that's called life that's called life and that's what Christ is is all about is celebrations celebrations of life and brother Carson God bless you and God bless you just to change it's not retirement just a change it's more uh uh relax uh you know I quit wearing a watch when I quit working by the hour CU I didn't have to it was just I mean it just I didn't be wherever I wanted to be amen whenever I wanted to be but God bless you and thank you for your the father's thinging man that's a so true what brother the Carson said you know I shudder as a father you know when I was young I was young immature stupid made mistakes and then I see my kids do the same thing and I L like oh that was me 30 years ago and they they catch all the bad I hope they catch a few of the good but I can see the bad from a mile away and they had a good teacher it was me amen the ripple effect that's powerful that's very powerful but we're supposed to have a lot more good than the bad and that's called growing up it's maturity amen and that's who he's coming for is a mature wife a mature wife amen and so uh just great to be here amen just feel so privileged amen and and also we uh kind of you know we make mistakes I mean I make mistakes I make mistakes we casually mentioned a few weeks ago about going to the park and it kind of crep up on me but we're planning on going to the park for lunch so you know we can just buy some cooked ham or cooked turkey or potato chips on the way and it's just straight up this road and if we do something different it'll be out of our comfort zone and we'll take the chairs from church and there'll be chairs there and and so look forward to Fellowship after I'm going to have the boys come up uh Silas and ilot and Felix for a moment just before we preach amen everything's under control amen we have a bunch of fathers that aren't here we have a visiting father that I'm sorry that we didn't know you'd be visiting before the foundation of the world but uh amen it's just we want to recognize it's okay to do something not of the ordinary you know you don't know what we're going to do I don't know what I'm going to do five minutes ago so don't worry amen just God is good amen it's just there's nothing like on life to have friends and family amen so we want to recognize there's one brother here that gives me gifts on a regular basis and I stupidly made mistake number and uh his is going to come later but oh oh there it is back you can go brother Bernard you're dead you're dead brother CS this one you got it write this amen God bless you God bless you and and man with three more in there that weren't able to be here today junior Man by God's grace will Minister next week he was just unable to come this morning and amen we love him and brother Jim and all the ones Max called and talked to him and he was just unable to be here let's stand and we'll just get right into our scripture amen just uh just a real privilege to be here thank you again brother Carson that's just it's beautiful when Brothers have uh a thought and anointing and are willing to share it and just like a special or something like that amen that's that's part of a church and it's a family and it's a body and it's it's not a oneman show or operation that's why we have fivefold and Gifts in the body amen 1 Peter 1 uh 6 and 7 1 Peter 1 6 and 7 I'm going to minister on fathers this morning and I have a confession to make I have a unfair advantage of most of you because I had a real father real godly man and example in my life amen I don't have no Bible up here first Peter 1 and uh 6 and 7 wherein are ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations verse 7 that your trials of your faith being more precious than gold more of gold that are precious sorry through though it be tried up by fire might be found onto praise and honor and Glory by the appearing of Jesus Christ let's turn over to Hebrews just before you're seated Hebrews 5 uh and we're going to read just 8 and n9ine Hebrews 58-9 and here it's talking about Jesus though he Christ were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto them that obeyed him Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless your word this morning bless all your bride here represented and Lord help us fathers to be what you had planned for us in your name we pray amen you may have your seats amen you know there's a difference between a father the characteristics of a father and somebody that can just have children a huge difference and you know uh we have uh different spirits and different things that that are around our age and we we have different terminology but we the the actions and the way we live our life is exactly the things that we do not like now we know that somebody that comes into great riches young we call them silver spoon or Young Rich and yet most of us are guilty of living our complete life on our family to create what we hate amen the very you know if you've seen a kid up town and they were just a brat but the way you raise your family you raise brats you you see somebody that's a silver spoon and they just come into enormous amount of wealth they don't have a clue how to handle it and yet we live our life because we have this really bad saying that we say well I don't want our children to go through the hardships that I went through we don't want our children to suffer like me and your mom suffered and that's why you raise exactly what you don't like because without s there will be no character you have to go through trials and tribulations and Christ G that's the Son of God had to do that and he was the only born the only person born without sin born of a virgin perfect and yet the B and we're a long ways from born perfect we we here we came come to the world speaking lies and born in sin and we'll run from anything that's suffering we're looking at a world that has no character if anything's difficult we change jobs we change marriage not in the hopefully not in the church but we just run run for our life you know I seen somebody you know and and you know the the prophet said this he said I would give anything to have a home but he said I'm I'm I I don't know the exact word he used but he said I'm just a Wanderer and he said I looked at an airplane and I never knew what he said until recently but you know I looked at an airplane I wished I was on it but he said I have no place to call home I just and he said I would give anything I believe he said actually a million dollars then but that was a lot more than today but he said I would give anything to have someplace that I could just go down hang my hat sit on the front porch because he was real he was called to a different Ministry amen but we we find in our world that people are running from everything I've seen something just randomly and it don't matter who it was but they you know they they were moving again and it's all right to move by the way it's totally all right to move and people would move for jobs and and praise God brother cars and sister Sharon move because because I mean there there's good things to that but you know but people move for the wrong reasons you know they live here 10 years and they run away oh well nothing's perfect here and when they get there they're they also amen and somebody they they'd Liv one place one Province 15 years they went to another Province through so many years and they were moving to another Province I'm just like wow how could I pull up everything that I consider deer here and disappear you ain't going to be happy when you get there unless it's glory because Abraham said I'm looking for a city and Builder who maker is God and you know we always you know we go away and we say well we could you know I'm guilty of this I every country I visit I said well I could live here but when I get there I would be there and it would still be just like here amen but we we we always are looking over the fence and we find it hard to be satisfied in our trial suffling we think well if we jump the fence and we're in the next pasture next door there will be less thistles there'll still be thistles in there too cuz the wind blew them over there and the birds took them over you know in our yard we have we never planted wild raspberries but the birds seated them for us and they're beautiful the S Esther will make me smoothies that oh just slap your grandma good just tiny tiny little raspberries and the birds huge Bush as big as a piano we never pled them the birds planted them but God planned on you know us to have character you know and so we see all these things but if we're not careful we'll give our kids too much we'll spoil them you'll destroy them you give ministers too much you'll destroy them amen nothing wrong with money but it can ruin people it can you amen so sufferings amen is different you know character is something that's achieved it just don't come when you're borned amen and so we look at the idea of character and I I want to consider this as our lord Jesus and our heavenly father and think of the character that he had and compare that in a in a as best we can to our Heavenly or Earthly fathers but fathers the definition of father is if somebody's going to be hurt I'd rather it be me right I mean he's supposed to be the protector in every way but you know in the society that we live in it's far from that it's far from that you know I said I have an unfair Advantage because my daddy came from heaven and he lived like that I remember devotions I remember my daddy sacrificing money to go to Every Church camp that you could think of in the world because that's what he wanted the environment for his kids to be in it was sacrifice I can remember my dad staying home and doing things he shouldn't have did like Square bound emptying alone so all his family could be at Camp amen that was sacrifice was character and we see that character if you looked up in Google it's compassionate it's sensitive and it's kind and I already shared it that if somebody else was going to be hurt or have pain you would step forward and say I'll take that amen and the Very opposite of character is what this world is self-centered and immature brats disrespectful to parents and elders and you know even brother Brown the used to kids would call their dad the old man or the old woman or that that's disgusting and any kid that comes to their parents parents even though it's Father's Day we you say and you say something disgusting you need a kick in the knee period amen that's just disgusting and it's also disgusting to our Heavenly Father amen God help us here's some quotes just to lay his foundation said it's strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character and it comes through suffering but you know even in our spiritual walk now you just think about and I I'm I'm preaching to myself this morning but you think back if it gets too rough we're going to be looking over the fence spiritually and yet God has to put you through that you know if you're his child you know if you run away from chastisement you know what the Bible says you didn't come from him and yet every one of us when it gets to fck we run but God's doing that to build exactly what he wants Christ on Earth amen that's crazy you know I thought Christ loved us enough to just give us roses and bed of ease but he wants you to be like Christ and so he has to give you this other oh it's coming the better roses and flowers is coming but that's after you've achieved what Christ had to go through amen and if Christ had to go through it you ain't going to arrive there without doing the same thing amen and we all try watch this he said no sir he said we all have trials and we all try to to uh to get away from them but no one can amen he said it's exactly the organizations of the church in the last day he said come out of her my people he said the Rapture has not yet taken place watch this he's he's saying about what's going to happen before the Rapture now now our Prophet clearly said we're not going to be uh like abused but we're going to be having character so we're going to be under pressure he said the Rapture hasn't taken place yet and the bride is not yet gone when these terrible conditions in this rich and false Church exist we're living in those this state that he said he's not going to take us out of here before before he feel before we feel some pressure but there is the gold of God he said it's Tried by your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes he said the gold of God is Christlike character produced and the fiery furnaces of Affliction now if you were honest with yourself there's not one of us that stand up and enjoy the furnace there's not one way you might pretend like you do but you don't and your private time you're you're you're squirming like a because the heat is on and he said that is the right kind of gold this is our Prophet talking he said that's the right kind of gold because it's God's gold and it's from the Heat and he said watch this he said the same quote here just further down he said and you'd better come to it before it's too late sayith the Lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and when you'll be truly rich and and we are we getting it listen to me he said n naged physically and we come into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave he's saying you come into the world with nothing physically but you're not going to leave with nothing there's something you're going to take and it's either a briat or the character amen oh no he said you're going to take something with us and that something is all we that's all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we' better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right not before men but before God so when so when what will we take with us he said you will take your character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his character who whose character was molded by his suffering in the fiery furnaces of Affliction or will it be the softness watch this watch this I know we're not leot Dean people but we're rubbing with Leo deia will it be the softness of the character less this is the prophet still talking character less leot toan people you don't have to go really far to see that it is up to each of you for in that day a man will bear his own burden amen so you see what I'm saying so when we raise our family as parents and fathers the very thing that you're trying to save your kids from God ordained to make them the men and women that they must become who I hope my kids don't have to work hard I'm going to to try and Supply them a house I don't want them to have to ride a bike to work why amen I don't want them to have to really suffer to keep the church going why did you do you feel bad for it I mean I you see some people and my family don't know but sometimes even in our family people are in a marriage and then they raise and they will say they're like oh praise God I'm happily married I'm just wonderful and then they teach other kids never get married well if it was wonderful wouldn't you want him to get married by your very actions you're proving that you hate what you did you made a stupid decision you think and you're going to correct it with your kids oh bless God I never want my kids to get married like that but I'm happy amen God help us amen here the prophet said he says sometimes we think that our burdens I might inject this rate here he said that we think our burdens are he so heavy sometimes that there's nothing like it in the world do you know that all those things are good for you I'm still reading the prophet and they are all to mold you and make you the prophets was molded on the backside of the desert in the blazing hot sun and through tribulation and trials and persecutions and all those things that we have today there's nothing that happened to us that wasn't happened to the other Christians before us but so often we don't well we don't we don't want to do that to be like we respect them and we want to be like that but we don't want to go through what they did to go through that amen other Christians has had to stand in the hour of Darkness like this and even were fed to lions and you know all the stories through in furnaces and all this and our life is so soft and that that The Curse Of Us in North America we're getting softer by the day and what happens in the natural happens in the spiritual amen wow God help us God help us do we have enough backbone to you you know you like they say does the church have to be air conditioned and padded or you know I seen pictures in another country where they had a flood in in the Philippines they get the the monsoon rain and and the water was a foot deep and the church was packed like 200 people in it it didn't stop them a bit we would cancel church I would cancel church amen it was just normal occasion to them it rained what can we do about the rain just enjoy the rain amen God wants to see how you your reaction to an action that he gives you is say oh they didn't treat me very nice but God did that intentionally you're blaming the person but God intentionally had the situation arranged to see if you had what you pretend you have man wow but I thought they just didn't they don't even have a clue what you're talking about cuz God made the the whole situation just to see to us to see amen I can tell my wife all I want but when I'm in a take situation then it's very obvious and that's the same way with God we think wow she burnt the food intentionally no God Made It Burn to see how you God help us amen 1 Peter 3 13- 14 and I want to emphasize on 18 but I'm just going to read this he said and whom he and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good in verse 14 but if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye praise the Lord there wasn't many out to church on Wednesday doesn't matter to me that was up to God you know I I you know that this is us you know one of the best Wednesday night services one of the best brother Carson and sister Sharon were here me and Len I'm not POS I don't think Esther was here but she might have been and we never hit Main Street and I told my wife I said that was a powerful sweet anointing in that place you know who was supposed to be here exactly who was here amen and and that's not the norm by the way we do have more than that but but you see what I mean we we think we think oh oh well like well that was so hard let's just not do it anymore and the hardest time was the best amen Verse 18 let's drop to verse 18 for Christ also once had just four people in church suffered for sins now why in the world would Christ now that's the anointed one okay so that's Jehovah why did he have to suffer I mean he's the boss and we're his children and we have other plans for Christ also I want you to get that Christ is the anointed one that is nothing less than Jehovah he didn't have to S he was already perfect once suffered for sin the just for the unjust now there's where character comes in well bless God I'm not going to get them A coffee they don't deserve it bless God I'm not making that much food he's just a fat person the just for the unjust do you think CRA said to come and die for me no but when we were ugly when we were disgusting when we were talking back to our parents when we needed a backhander front and back God just stood there and because in the fit a rage he just took it in and dealt with it later the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit now you know the only mercy and by God's grace there's lots of Mercy on Earth today the only Mercy that's on Earth today is sitting right here the purple the people in your mind that say are going to hell be really careful with that be very very careful there was the prostitute in the wall there was the woman at the well we would have put them all in jail you know we do I need to go on the grace that you our the prophet said this he said in road rage he said the way you react in driving could affect somebody's Eternal destination oh you off I'm going to whip in and hit my brakes and that person's going to come to a builing point and you just ruined your testimony might as well skip church the next Sunday just go to prayer meeting amen it don't matter what it don't matter just say oh that don't matter you know you know you see a you see a tiller and she's all flustered because you pay with cash and she's only knows how to use a card and and say oh don't worry I don't care that you don't have $300 in the till you can go get it for me I'm in no hurry I just use that for an example but you see when you respond like that the the old pressure goes or or like the tiller it's the first time I said oh don't worry I said it was my first time yesterday and you just see the pressure go man why do we got to build up this amen Christ suffered God suffered and but we run from it we move we move change avoid we do everything we can to avoid I have this saying that's very popular in our house I said honey I was working for your kids but you see you see to me we we say well I don't have to do that let's God that's not my field you know my dad for probably close to 45 years would plant many of the kids Fields first for free before he would plant his own land that was the money that he was going to give to his kids combine when it was wheat season and there's thunderstorms and you could lose the crop because of hail he would combine the kids Wheat first and his would Sprout and he' put it in the one room Schoolhouse and feed it to the cattle next winter and get the money a year from now because he was trying to make something easier for somebody else but brother Dale says bless God the combine's mine I'm headed to my field huh you do the same thing you do it in a different way cuz that's the natural flesh that's the Flesh and that would have never saved you and me if Christ would have had that Spirit oh bless God I'm up here where it's cushy we got air condition in heaven we walk on gold he came to a barnyard amen character Hebrews 5 6 and 10 6 to 10 oh well we already read this sorry let's just jump that let's go to Matthew 10:34 to 39 and I really want to emphasize on 38 think it not that I am come to sent peace on the earth now God's peace didn't he come to make things smoother think not that I came to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but the sword wait a minute everything I was learning for I am come to send men that what's that word honey sorry variance well I got the definition of the word because I was kind of born and that word variance means difference disagreement a squirrel a squirrel or discrepancy against your father different than your heavenly father you know do we have the characteristic you know brother Brown said he said I'm afraid that we're getting the characteristic of the church the characteristic of the pastor and CH is like who's that guy I don't even recognize nothing you know what I shock you it's not a boat brother Dale and it ain't a boat Wyoming either that's why we put post out there and say go travel as much as you can as much as you can I'll be thrilled when you come back testify party that's not to say that we're not connected in a home church we love you but they're part of the connection amen this is not an individual Kingdom this is a huge big worldwide do it I want to take every one of you where I go this winter make all your plans for win Let's Escape this place it's all right God's there too amen sir and if you can't go we'll leave you in charge to hold down the fort so when we come back in the spring amen against his father a daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be there of his own household now let's just look into that for a minute the ones that we suffer with are the ones that we're closest with we mentioned that last Sunday the people that you last owed at are the ones you love the most so it's either your mom and dad or your wife or husband or maybe your kids God feels sorry for those kids amen why do we do that you wouldn't talk like that at the grocery store the person would punch you in the face if you went to the bank tiller and you talk to her like you did your wife they wouldn't give you no money they'd say get lost oh you you think I'm going somewhere that's why they put up signs uhuh uhuh they put up a sign I was at the New Holland dealership in Delta and can you imagine how hyper the farmers are right now like it's a new kind of hyper if you want the definition talk to me after but it's serious hyper you know a farmer's income is normally between 1,000 and 1500 an acre so 100 Acre Farm he's losing between 100 to 150,000 so now you just you can times that as big as you want hyper and they had a sign on the parts department they have four parts me because when Farmers come in I seen a guy come in he said don't talk to me right now you know when your planner breaks and you should have been planning a month ago that's called hyper but the character and that's what my dad I seen my daddy in tight situations just somehow well I I know how he couldn't have kept it together but God you know I remember I I I can only preach what I grew up in I can remember my daddy having a 100 acres of treeful seed and he went in there with a little uh I believe it was an Amorous SE which is about a 20 horsepower tractor and an 8ft sickle motor to cut that hay and he said if I would have knew how much money was in that field when I went in I would have went I would have lost my mind but he just he just ate foot now I don't know if you know but I me to tell you something a 100 Acre field is 2200 feet wide so he had to go back and forth A lot of times for 8 ft and you have to leave a little space so you don't miss any so he was only cutting seven half ft divided by 22 if anybody's got a phone you can let me know how many that is but that's a lot of times across the field I mean it's more than enough times for me to fall asleep but that's character CU he just held it together and the reason he didn't know how much was in that field was because when they built the church and he left the Free Methodist Church when they cut the women cut their hair off and started wearing pants to church and started piercing their ears my dad left and started his church with one couple and none of them were preachers my oldest brother Paul tells me he said see you the Apple never fell far from the tree when you went and bought your church said cuz your daddy did the same thing except he didn't preach and that was before I was born and my daddy gave the first 30,000 to that church I'm pushing 60 so that was a while ago and you know the very next year my God gave my daddy 30,000 on one field that was the poorest field that he ever owned you can't outgive God if you got character that's not even possible that's why I can be the youngest of eight kids and because of what God's brought us to you could give more away but I would put my bank account with any one of my siblings and that's got cuz I'm smart I failed grade one it's because God's smart it's a principle it's God's principle in his word it has nothing to do with flesh if you're thinking it's because of Flesh you've missed everything but God does things because of suffering God asked you for just like God asking you for his money who in their right mind is going to give money away in the economy like this to anybody are you kidding but God knew what it would God knew what it would take to get him perfect that now that's a mystery right there how's God torture himself to become perfect now that was Christ and that's the anointed one that's Jehovah wow unbelievable here God knew this plan that it was to come to the Earth with a sword and he said he that loveth his father and mother more than loveth me is not worthy and he that loveth his son or daughter is not worthy of me and vers verse 38 and 30 uh is the one we want and he that taketh not his cross is burdened you know we need some fathers that aren't just men we need some people that hold up their end and a whole bunch of other people's end and they don't have to put it on Facebook oh I'm really helping out bless God well you got your reward here don't line up in heaven for it that's what the Bible says he that taketh not his cross here and followeth after me isn't even worthy to be in the family wow amen amen and he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it that that's against everything that society's teaching you we know that now we're not we're not we're just living by this Society we're not involved in this Society I know that you're not the part of that you know the prophet said that that everything in nature take spiritual and God shows everything in nature you know everything God valued he buried that's why we believe in Holiness by the way I don't want to see your body cuz I see mine every day I mean I shower I'm not trying to be funny I'm just saying our world's got some stupid things God buried the gold buried the silver buried the diamonds buried the coal buried all the minerals hid the oil I mean like bless God if you didn't hide the oil I'm going to go find some become rich no he hid it all and he also hid you and he proved that by Nature you say how's he yeah he did that by ostriches ostriches or sorry how the pearls are made OST I can't speak English I took speech therapy in great too ostrich they had to be hurt to make a pearl but I don't want to be hurt bless God yeah don't worry you won't go in the Rapture then you know there's only going to be lame and hurt people going the Rapture Oh They'll be healed before they're lame oh yeah oh for sure you'll get a new body you see what I mean but oh bless God they really hurt me but think of how valuable you are and the longer and the Begger the heart uhhuh you know we were in the Philippines and that was a long time ago nine years ago me and lamia were in the Philippines and I went to an SM Mall and we've seen a pearl necklace and they their exchange on their money I think it's about $57 to one and they had a necklace there it was like 6,000 Canadian I think it was around 5,000 us but bless God we don't want to be hurt that's because the world has no value to it amen the only value is in the people of God and it's because of the character and the tribe that God put you through amen he said God never allowed this pain for without without a purpose he said your greatest ministry will come out by your greatest hurt the greater your hurt and how you take the pain and you just walk away with keeping the prophet said it like this he said if you give a cow enough rope she'll hang herself all she has to do is just stand quiet she'll be just fine amen hallelujah he said the things that you're going through now are really nothing to be compared let's turn to Romans 8:14 And1 17 and many that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption wherein we cry ABA father and the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that's how you that's your character that's how you control yourself your character beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs and Heirs of God and join HS with Christ and if so that we oh there we go again suffer with him why why do we got to do that if so that we suffer with him that we may also Glory together with him for I reckon that the present suffering of this time and you've went through some Real Deals I know you have I've went through some of them too and they weren't pretty I had to take a few days time up maybe in your own individual family amen or in your church family your walk with Christ but God made you a better person man for what you went through you're better now than you were before you would have sidestepped that but it was all God's plan am man for the compared to the glory that'll be revealed in us oh my imagine what will look like in the in the eyes of Christ a pearl of amazing price God help us God help us here in First Peter and just laying some scriptures to to show you how much the Bible talks about 1 Peter 28-23 servants be subject unto your master with all fear not only to the good and the gentle but also to the forward and be thankworthy if a man of conscience towards God endure grief suffering wrongfully he's saying be thankful if you're treated wrongfully now well I I've not so sure about that one for what glory is it if when ye are buffeted that your faults that you shall take it shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God that's amazing is this amazing to anybody else it was all part of God's plan he don't want something that don't have a great baked Perl in it he wants one of those great baked ones at the center of the necklace Hallelujah for even here unto were ye called called I mean we love when we pray oh praise God if I was preaching about Sons and Daughters of God you'd be all like woo woo woo woo but you're called to suffer oh well no human like where unto ye are called because Christ also suffered amen so when we go to the mission field we we we preach on predestination called an election everybody's like wow but you get to suffer too hello no thanks because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example there you go remember I said I was an unfair Advantage because I have an example of a real father an example that we should follow our Heavenly Father's Footsteps and our heavenly father is Christ the anointing one who did no sin neither was G found in his mouth whom when he was reviled and his children spoke back to him in disrespect and disgust he reviled not again and when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judges righteously wow are we his children do we have the character that Christ had are we the fathers that our heavenly father seen before the foundation of the world that planned that we would raise he would put us over over uh with his with his family and and and give us little charges over the sections of God's family or are we Silver Spoon Young Rich brats uhuh 1 Peter 3:4 but let it be hidden the hidden man of the heart this is this is always preached towards wives but you know I just like the gospel where it applies to the men and the women it just kind of flows really nice with me we expect our wives to be just little like passive little but God expects you to be the same way to him and let also the hidden men of the heart in which there is not corruptible even the origins of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a real man great price oh bless God that's just for the women no it's not no it's not and on top of all that we're all women to God so there you go with that religion amen here's one of the trials that Christ went through Luke 22: 41-44 Luke 22 he said he was he here's the the disciples are praying with them of course they fall asleep because they don't have a like it's not me that sick bless God I don't have to pray it's not me that's being crucified so why do I care and he withdrew himself from him a Stones cast and kneel down and prayed and he said father if it be willing and you'd remove this cup from me nevertheless I'll take the suffering not us we're moving they never treated me white I'm not going to that party I'm not hanging with those people I'm moving out of Ontario I think I'll pick El Salvador guess what when you get to Salvador I'll be there if I move there that's what brother Brown said about a perfect church if it was truly a perfect Church in the world when you arrive it won't be perfect no more cuz you're moving amen now that don't mean you can't move from churches because I've done that too but but for the right reasons amen nevertheless not here he's surrendering and there appeared unto him an angel from heaven strengthening him you know God will never give you more than you can take in your character he's just there he'll just feed just just keep it together you're almost through this TR you know I got great comfort for you if you fail in your trial to get character God will give it to you again I've went through some of them a lot of times after a few dozen times I'm like man that's sure familiar God's like oh you dummy you huh I'm sure he done it to more than just me uhhuh and being in agony agony's character suffering and being in agony he prayed the more earnestly as it were sweat was as great drops of blood that fell down to the ground he you know he had the right to choose amen and you know what else so do you you have the right to choose I want to show you something and natural natural types of spiritualness story do you know that sheep blood is the only or one of the only uh antibiotics that they use to fight stin snag Venom some familiar now what are we compared as sheep now there's one catch to that picture you have to survive you can't give up or move so sheep in the natural that get bit by a poisonous snake go through Agony that's what Google says and torture and it's a very unpleasant experience but if they survive which is just holding it together then that blood is used to fight poisonous snake bites in people amen and God Made You his sheep and Satan is a Venom and when you survive your grace to your family to the world to the church to your brothers and sisters to the people you'd like to go whoop but you just go you know why because you survived amen it was Christ that took the bite of sin of the world for us and you say yes he survived and rose again on the third day and his whole life was to change me and you from the death of the bite that was sure to come in amen hallelujah and God declared it in his creation and took it and nailed himself on the cross character now anybody that wants to read that that's a lot more detailed about snake venom but brother Dale's not making that up they go through great torture and suffering just like when an eagle whatever when they what do they call me mol yeah and they go in and the other eagles feed them and their feathers all fall off in that amen God help us let's just close with some quotes and we're going to mention about Job here's the same example he said this is a positive the authority of a policeman he said it's not the policeman that stops a big 18wheeler brother Bart of that but it's the authority behind him and we we have not got that like we should the authority that we have he said never will here's our Prophet talking he said never will you ever make a Believer a Christian as long as you're afraid of expressing The Authority that was given to you by Christ amen oh bless God I'm a message believer but I'm afraid I'm a message believer but I don't have no testimony I'm a message believer but I never seen God oh you're not a message believer you're just religious amen for we have the victory The Authority given to us in Christ we have the victory it's not that we we don't have anything he said it's not that we have to fight for the victory he said you already have the victory he said for he's made you a mighty conqueror in Christ amen I tell you that God gave the church an assignment one day and when Jesus was lifted up from Calvary Between Heaven and Earth and not other than God Emanuel bleeding out his blood upon the ground there was an sign lifted up to the people that we have conquered and we are more than conquerors because Christ conquered us we see job here and we're going to finish with job here he's and let's maybe you can turn to it job 19:23 to 27 and he said oh my here's job he's talking about he went through this trial job was perfect because of what he suffered he proved his Perfection because of what he suffered now God seen it in him beforehand but have you ever considered my servant job wow you know I I just wouldn't that be powerful to have God so much confidence in your character that God could say that each one of us I believe he will his pride I believe he does Amen there's amazing things we got to God's moving and different things you know when we went Pastor John's uh change in life retirement thing you know he was talking about when he was young and praying and come outside the Tabernacle and and this this blew my mind that the firefighter showed up because they thought the building was on fire and it was a pillar of fire there was no fire there they CR where's the fire fire this fire don't burn I come home for that me I said oh God if you do that oh would to God that we would see that but God there's all kinds of things and we look right out we go oh I can't see I can't see my eyes are wide open I can't see oh amen we had to be grateful and celebrate the little things that God do and God will bring more and more and more and man it's all there Hallelujah here's job talking about he say oh that my words would now be written and all that they would be printed in a book and he said that they would be graved in the iron pen and Led Led in the stone forever job's trying to share his experience that the whole world will never lose it for I know that my redeemer liveth and he shall stand in the latter day upon the Earth and though the SK worms eat this body yet in my exact flesh I shall see God whom I shall see not just through the bride but myself and my eyes Shall Behold Him and not another though my renss are consumed within me God help us to recognize the amazing things that God's done here in another quote here he said here's our prophet and I I'm I'm winding down he said unless you suffer with him you cannot reign with him we have to suffer to rain and the reason that the character simply is never made without suffering amen how come just think about that spiritually just think about your spiritually your relationship with Christ and other people in your life it was for your good it was totally for your good amen if we become mature we'll actually get along because we're going to always be different and we're always going to be unique and what's important to one won't be but we can come together amen and it's to careful he said character is a victory not a gift he said man without character can't reain because the power apart from character is satanic but the power of character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share on his throne remember remember who's going to judge the world uh-huh you and I want you to judge my friends just perfect I don't want you to vote me out when you hear Brother Dale stop out and say whoa that person was kind to me take it easy you better not uhhuh he set down on the father's throne and when we have overcome we can sit with him our little temp temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared he said let's just jump down he said think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that you go through wow bless God if we went to a good church they wouldn't be no problems if there wasn't no problems you wouldn't even be a believer you wouldn't even be converted it's not strange God wants us to develop the Christ I'm reading this what the proph Christlike character that comes through suffering a real Godly father can shut up and put up amen and we H have trials and amen let's just jump through Hebrews 12 uh 6 and 8 for whom the Lord loveth he chastises and scornest every son whom he receiveth but if you are without chastisement therefore you are therefore all are partakers then ye are bastards and not Sons amen God help us there's no True Believer oh bless God we have always had a wonderful pastor and the church has never had any problems you'll never go in the Rapture there is not any True Believers that are free from it I praise God that you get a bad I mean not really but but it's for our trials are for a perfecting every not One True Believer is free from it this is of God bless God I don't like the ministry I don't like my sisters this is the will of God and it's and I'm reading okay is that all right and it's needful I don't like that part I'm not going to preach on this no more we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it love suffereth long in His Kind Matthew 51 and 12 blessed Whom The man shall re revile you and persecute you and shall do all manner of evil against you and you'll just go rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven and so p persecuted you the prophets you know 6 months ago back or so I just have one quote and a scripture six months ago or maybe longer maybe it was a year ago we had some people come by unexpectedly and they were asking us about things that have happened happen in this area and we were sitting in my house you know and there's things you say oh bless God well there were things that happened and they were true and they were really pushing really pushing were they really pushing somehow somehow by God's amazing gra I said that's not my de business somehow that wasn't the Dale that wasn't the Dale that that was one time that the Dale never spoke up I had a right to I mean the Dale thought I had a right to that's a better way to say it and I answered them and I said that's not my department to disperse that to You' and you know they left our house and the next week me and the way were there I was probably listening to my Bible oh man am I happy God help me do that it was just like who how did I do it sometimes even the truth don't need to be spoken because Satan will hear it do you know why some people believe the seventh seal is still a mystery it's because it's not by the way and the prophet said that Christ revealed it but it couldn't be spoken because Satan would hear it and so it's a non-spoken Like Love Letter like huh that the bride would catch and that you watch the prophet he' go around the bush and around the bush and around the bush right in the seventh seal he said it's not a mystery Christ revealed it he revealed it mean him but if you listen to it like what did he say amen God help us job's life when the trials and temptations came God job took took God's provided way the sacrifice of the blood and burning the offerings and he stood on it and when the trials and tests came and that you know what came in job's life they said oh you're a secret Sinner and you're a loser and you know you've all heard those probably things you're not you you got a past life and a hidden oh who cares when the trials and testing came well if that had it just been a denomination or a religion religion he'd have fell a long time ago if it had just been proven by science he would also fell a long time ago but because everything that he was taken everything was taken from him his children was taken his riches his health and everything even his wife turned against him and his boyo job said why his wife told him to even Curse God and guy and he said you speaketh like a foolish person he didn't say that she was foolish but people speak like a foolish person he said the lord gave and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord see job never had a kingdom didn't matter to him he was a Believer he was a Christian and made no difference to him what happened because he was still a Christian so it didn't matter if the pastor shook his hand didn't matter if the pastor didn't show up didn't matter if the pastor preach long didn't matter if you preach short didn't matter if you had didn't matter if you made no difference didn't matter if his kids died his wealth died didn't matter if we planned a crop or not you know my brother I was talking to my brother and sometimes he you know God uses donkey sometimes not that my brother's a donkey he's my best friend in the flesh and I was telling my brother I said oh man I got field of beans not planting said D don't worry about it said you can't take it with you he's like you'll probably still live in the same Farm if you don't plant that field the be well guess what he's probably actually right but we're [Laughter] like God just God just giving you the old fishing rod and see that's how God taught brother Bram how to fish brother Bram listened to the other brothers that made him excited and he jerked too soon God said I never told you that I never told you and he just got a little tiny mle but it was the character of just waiting for the good stuff amen hallelujah let's finish this quote here and when he come down to his comforters and the church members and they come down and they accuse him you've all had this happen to you job and he knowed that he was righteous because he wasn't trusting in their own mer in his own merits but he met God's requirement because he stood on the blood sacrifice he said yes sir I knoweth I know that he was righteous because he met God's requirement let's turn to First Timothy and we just got two scriptures and we'll close here 1 Timothy 3 1 and 4 10 and 12 and 14 this I know also that in the last days the perilous time shall come and Men shall be lovers of their own self Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy without natural affections truth speakers false accusers incompetent F despisers of those that do good verse four traitors and heady and high-m minded and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god let's verse jump to verse 10 but whom hast thou Hast fully known my Doctrine now this is Paul talking to the church but whom has fully known my Doctrine the manner of life and the purpose and Faith Longs suffering we could throw character in there longsuffering charity which is love and patient now watch here Paul's telling the church the state of the world but he said this is our Doctrine you're to have character longsuffering and patient and love it the character was the purpose of Faith Hallelujah verse 11 he's talking about his persecution and if you go through that but out of them all the Lord deliver me verse verse 12 yay all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus oh I don't like that part bless God I think we should move you know sometimes I'm a whiner we went through a whole week and the kids never come by at night and we were waiting for the sunshine to come out we're just sitting in the house all night I said honey we used to go see my mom and dad all the time if we never had nothing to do I said we should move away if we move to another country then they'd have something to cry about we're right no nobody cares we're next door yeah 5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00 9:00 10:00 11:00 should we go to bed honey I guess it's going to rain tomorrow huh yay we are all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution every one of us have tried and have run from suffering that was given by God and we actually accused somebody else of what God was doing and I'm guilty I have that t-shirt too and God's like it was Meen but continue thou verse 14 but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned and Hast been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them that's a sound Doctrine the character of Christ our last verse Genesis 18 and 19 and this is what God has put in charge of you fathers and mothers and families and the family of God remember that God was a self-existing one until he spoke you in his thoughts and the prophet said then he was a family man is and he wasn't self-existing anymore cuz he dwelt with his family Genesis 18 and 19 for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord and do just and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him I pray that God would trust me enough that in time he trust me a little bit because of time and character amen God help us let's stand I trust as fathers you know that were not like I said sometimes whiners and that we'll be mature and and deal with uh things that we need to deal with and and uh and have the character of Christ you know and I'm closing with this I promise that's still a mystery to me how God had to put himself through suffering I that if if you got it all figured out you can talk to me I I'll I'll gladly listen how God that was perfect chose by choice to suffer like but he was already perfect there was character and there's no way that we were perfect like him and we got to have a lot more suffering him but our the whole society that we live in and the whole
