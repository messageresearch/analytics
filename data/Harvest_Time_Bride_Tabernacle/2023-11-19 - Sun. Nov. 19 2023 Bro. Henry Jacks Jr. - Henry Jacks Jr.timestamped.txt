[38:10] seated oh praise God
[38:15] hallelujah you
[38:16] know this
[38:19] conversation that Jesus had with the
[38:24] disciples it shows that
[38:27] it took
[38:28] place 25
[38:32] miles north of the Sea of
[38:36] Galilee in the district of cesaria
[38:40] Philippi they have been walking with
[38:43] Jesus for three years
[38:47] Hallelujah Jesus did many
[38:51] miracles in it signs and
[38:54] wonders Hallelujah
[38:57] they heard about the
[38:59] law they heard the prophecy concerning
[39:02] the law of
[39:04] Moses they heard the prophecy concerning
[39:07] all the
[39:08] prophets speaking of this Messiah they
[39:12] heard about
[39:14] it did they believe it yes they believe
[39:18] it but you must go more than just
[39:24] believe I don't believe in the statement
[39:27] that people always rehearse that the
[39:30] prophet said if if you don't understand
[39:33] just
[39:35] believe I don't agree with
[39:39] that why I say I don't
[39:41] agree understanding is
[39:46] important the topic
[39:48] is revelation brings
[39:52] Authority but we must understand that
[39:56] there three steps of
[39:59] Revelation three steps of
[40:01] Revelation
[40:03] Hallelujah and the first steps the first
[40:07] step of Revelation is
[40:10] knowledge the duty of the minister is to
[40:13] bring the people to the knowledge of the
[40:17] Son of God knowledge is important but it
[40:22] works it works together with
[40:26] understanding
[40:27] and
[40:30] wisdom what is
[40:32] knowledge knowledge is facts or
[40:38] information information is important but
[40:42] if you don't understand the information
[40:45] what good is it to
[40:47] you you may believe the information but
[40:50] it's important to understand it and when
[40:54] you understand that information
[40:56] then you must apply it wisdom is
[41:01] application you must apply what you
[41:05] understand do you believe
[41:09] that oh praise God we're going to go
[41:13] into the
[41:15] Bible we heard we read about the story
[41:18] The Parables that Jesus spoke about
[41:22] about the the mysteries of the Kingdom
[41:25] of Heaven
[41:26] in the Book of Matthew
[41:29] 13 and when you go through that
[41:32] Hallelujah when he started to speak to
[41:34] the multitude there's a difference
[41:37] between multitude and
[41:40] disciples multitude they came to be
[41:46] entertained they came to be entertained
[41:49] but thank God that we are not of the
[41:52] multitude because when we come to the
[41:55] house of God we do not come to be
[41:58] entertained we come to gain wisdom we
[42:02] come to gain knowledge we come to gain
[42:06] understanding hallelujah praise God so
[42:11] the disciples are consider
[42:15] students that's what that's the meaning
[42:17] for disciples student or pupils which
[42:20] also means
[42:22] student
[42:24] Hallelujah and here
[42:26] Jesus he would speak to the multitude in
[42:31] Parables and Parables Hallelujah is an
[42:35] Heavenly story with a Earthly meaning
[42:41] Jesus would take things in the natural
[42:43] and relate it but it is but is a
[42:47] Heavenly
[42:49] story Hallelujah it it contains
[42:53] secret so in the parable
[42:56] there are secrets that has been
[43:00] hidden oh praise God it's been hidden
[43:05] but it is truth hallelujah it is truth
[43:09] but he kept the truth hidden from them
[43:12] that's why I speak to them in Parables
[43:15] then the disciples said Master how do
[43:18] you speak to us plainly and you speak to
[43:21] the multitude in Parable he said the
[43:25] mistress of the Kingdom of Heaven is not
[43:28] given to them to
[43:30] know but the mistress is given to you to
[43:34] know Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah thank
[43:39] God Hallelujah I am one of
[43:42] them
[43:44] Hallelujah we are we are we are not of
[43:47] the multitude we are
[43:52] important
[43:54] Hallelujah revelation brings a
[44:00] charity
[44:02] Hallelujah
[44:05] Revelation praise the Lord you know I'm
[44:08] going to do something on the chalkboard
[44:11] here I love to
[44:14] write one the first step is
[44:21] knowledge and we say that knowledge is
[44:25] information
[44:27] it also
[44:29] means
[44:32] Fox is it not
[44:36] right oh praise God and the second one
[44:42] is
[44:44] understanding you remember that the
[44:49] Daniel when the angel came to
[44:53] Daniel the angel revealed
[44:56] it came to give him
[45:00] understanding isn't that
[45:02] right what is understanding it means
[45:07] comprehension comprehend the ability to
[45:11] comprehend and when you comprehend
[45:13] you're not doing it with your natural
[45:15] mind but also in your spirit because the
[45:19] spirit is the Mind Hallelujah the spirit
[45:24] becomes the mind
[45:26] Hallelujah
[45:31] comprehend and the other step is
[45:36] wisdom wisdom is
[45:40] important all of these works
[45:45] together you have when you have
[45:47] knowledge you must understand the
[45:49] knowledge and when you understand it you
[45:52] must apply it because wisdom is the
[45:58] application you apply what you
[46:02] understand that's why even
[46:06] today praise the Lord so many persons
[46:10] today there's so much
[46:13] confusion because they have no
[46:16] understanding they hear the word preach
[46:20] they hear it over and over but they do
[46:23] not understand Jesus told them in the
[46:26] Book of Matthew 13 that has been
[46:29] fulfilled in the prophet Isaiah here
[46:32] they have and they
[46:33] he highs they have and they see but they
[46:37] do not
[46:39] understand so they can hear the word and
[46:43] not understand
[46:44] it oh praise God hallelujah so when

[1:09:43] believer well then now there is
[1:09:46] power of the revelation of the
[1:09:51] word power and the word is not the
[1:09:56] letter the word is not the letter Christ
[1:10:00] is the
[1:10:02] word we used to believe I used to
[1:10:06] believe
[1:10:08] that Matthew Mark Luke John go straight
[1:10:12] up to Revelation is the New Testament I
[1:10:15] used to believe
[1:10:18] that is the New Testament but then the
[1:10:21] Lord began to show me something
[1:10:25] that the New Testament is when you
[1:10:28] receive the spirit of
[1:10:30] Christ that's the New
[1:10:33] Testament in The Book of Leviticus
[1:10:37] 17:1 in the law it said the Life is In
[1:10:40] the Flesh of the blood the life is in
[1:10:43] the blood of the
[1:10:45] flesh Jesus said except you take up the
[1:10:49] Flesh of the son of man and drink of his
[1:10:51] blood you have no life in you
[1:10:54] in Luke 22 verse 20 he said my
[1:10:59] blood is my
[1:11:01] Testament is my new
[1:11:07] testament in the book of second
[1:11:09] Corinthians 3 from verse 6 to9 brother
[1:11:13] Paul said we are
[1:11:14] ministers of the New
[1:11:18] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:11:22] spirit of Christ
[1:11:24] so when you receive the spirit of Christ
[1:11:26] you are the New
[1:11:31] Testament
[1:11:33] hallelujah oh praise God because you
[1:11:36] possess his
[1:11:38] Spirit you're not of the letter he said
