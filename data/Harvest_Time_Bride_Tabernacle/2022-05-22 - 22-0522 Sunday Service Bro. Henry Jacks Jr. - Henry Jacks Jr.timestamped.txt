[33:22] what god's doing there amen and if god
[33:25] tarries this will be a you know pastor
[33:27] leo on a regular monthly basis

[33:31] time but it's not unusual for him to
[33:33] baptize 20 souls a month
[33:36] a month a month we go to the next
[33:38] picture
[33:41] another picture
[33:44] next one this is oh this is a baptismal
[33:46] tank
[33:47] um

[33:56] foundation
[33:58] of his church paid for those steps and
[34:01] the baptismal tank
[34:04] amen it's very beautiful that is this
[34:07] kind of steel

[34:27] of finishing the roof on that building
[34:30] right there that's god's grace amen an
[34:32] amazing way now you know a few months
[34:34] back and not i don't
[34:36] change this but
[34:37] this just it was dealing with this this
[34:39] morning you know a few months back we
[34:41] preached on false prophets
[34:44] amen and brother tim anders was here you
[34:46] know that was about a month or so ago
[34:48] six weeks ago and a minister brought tim
[34:50] anders by his church
[34:52] and he was so jealous of leo's church
[34:54] that he wouldn't get out of the vehicle
[34:55] or see the church
[34:58] that's in this bride
[35:02] false prophets
[35:04] the bridegread full of them
[35:07] grateful you don't take my word for it
[35:09] you listen to moses abraham from uganda
[35:13] when he gave his testimony in ohio he
[35:15] wouldn't name the ministers because he
[35:16] said you have all kinds of ministers
[35:18] coming from africa here
[35:20] the only reason they're in the message
[35:25] he knew him by name and he had a hugely
[35:29] vindicated ministry
[35:31] if you ever listen to his message or his
[35:33] testimony
[35:34] it'll be the closest testimony you've
[35:35] ever heard to the prophet's life
[35:38] he had his own mom and dad tried to kill
[35:40] him multiple times
[35:42] amen ain't that sad
[35:44] it's sad and glad at the same time
[35:47] just
[35:48] said glad man you can't stop what god's
[35:51] doing
[35:52] you cannot stop what god's doing
[35:55] even though some would try to
[35:57] not sing that song it will be worth it
[35:59] all just as our brother henry comes man
[36:02] just looking forward to him you know he
[36:04] messaged me yesterday and said that he
[36:05] had lost his ride and
[36:07] and man you know we haven't had him
[36:09] preach this year and he's preached for
[36:11] us three to multiple
[36:13] times three different past years and
[36:15] i said oh brother man you you need a
[36:18] ride you need a ride

[44:24] i just want to take a simple thought
[44:26] today
[44:28] and the thought is hallelujah the unity
[44:32] unity of the fate
[44:35] hallelujah
[44:37] you know that taught me not so much but
[44:40] it's a sympathetic unity of the fate
[44:43] hallelujah and i believe that the holy
[44:46] ghost
[44:47] in this season is moving in that realm
[44:51] in that dimension is dealing with faith
[44:53] with faith the word of god said without
[44:56] faith in the book of hebrews chapter 11
[44:59] verse 6 without faith it is impossible
[45:03] to please god
[45:05] hallelujah jesus said in
[45:08] luke 18 verse 8 when the son of man come
[45:11] again will he find fate on the hurt
[45:15] hallelujah
[45:17] praise god
[45:19] ephesians chapter 4
[45:22] from verse 11
[45:25] and he gave listen e
[45:28] christ

[45:48] verse 12 for

[46:00] look at it now

[46:05] for the work of the ministry for the
[46:07] edifying of the body of christ

[46:18] hallelujah till we all come

[49:24] we're in
[49:26] they have
[49:27] missed
[49:28] the visitation of the lord
[49:31] they have missed
[49:36] glory to god they have misappearing
[49:40] and here brother paul
[49:44] hallelujah
[49:46] in the book of ephesians chapter 4
[49:50] as he wrote this letter to the
[49:53] ephesian church
[49:57] as he said
[49:59] you know
[50:00] he gave some
[50:02] christ
[50:03] some
[50:04] hallelujah apostles some prophets
[50:06] teachers
[50:09] but he called in verse
[50:11] in verse seven in verse eight if you you
[50:15] if you can back up to verse eight he
[50:17] said wherefore he said
[50:20] when he
[50:21] hallelujah when he ascended up and i let
[50:24] captivity kept him
[50:27] and gave gifts
[50:29] unto men
[50:32] so we noticed that these hallelujah that
[50:35] the bible said pastors
[50:37] prophets
[50:39] cheers
[50:40] evangelist these are considered gifts
[50:43] it is called gifts
[50:45] hallelujah
[50:47] so the pastor is a gift
[50:50] the teacher is a gift
[50:52] the prophet is a gift the evangelist is
[50:55] a gift
[50:56] hallelujah
[50:58] and these are
[50:59] given hallelujah to the body of christ
[51:04] because
[51:05] god upset these gifts in the body
[51:09] hallelujah to perfect the saints
[51:13] and the word perfect means to complete
[51:16] hallelujah you must be completed
[51:19] and he giving and he gave the gifts to
[51:21] the body to complete
[51:23] hallelujah
[51:25] oh god the bible said for the perfecting
[51:28] of the saints who are the saints those
[51:30] that are the sanctified ones by christ
[51:35] jesus said is saying john 17 verse 17
[51:38] father
[51:39] sanctify them through thy word because
[51:42] that word is truth
[51:45] hallelujah amen
[51:47] glory to god and the word sanctified
[51:50] means to set aside
[51:53] hallelujah to set aside
[51:55] because he wants to come hallelujah and
[51:59] use you for his purpose
[52:02] oh praise the lord the bible said
[52:05] hallelujah in genesis chapter 2 verse 1
[52:09] and all sanctify the seventh day for in
[52:14] hit he had rested
[52:16] hallelujah
[52:18] in it
[52:20] many people believe the seventh day
[52:22] today hallelujah is a sunday
[52:26] can you go in a sunday
[52:28] listen what the word said in it
[52:31] in heat he had rested
[52:34] you don't go hallelujah you don't go to
[52:36] a church in a sunday
[52:38] you go on a sunday or during a sunday
[52:43] but the word of god said for in it in
[52:46] what
[52:47] in the image
[52:50] hallelujah in the image he rested he
[52:54] stepped in that image
[52:56] hallelujah and he rested in that image
[53:00] oh hallelujah
[53:02] oh glory no wonder why hallelujah no
[53:06] wonder why the bible says when jesus
[53:09] came he said i must finish the work of
[53:13] the father
[53:14] i must finish the work
[53:16] hallelujah god eternal being the elohim
[53:21] hallelujah he started a work in the
[53:23] beginning
[53:25] and that work was creation work
[53:30] that's what the bible said he made
[53:32] heaven and hurt in the six days and he
[53:36] rested he hindered his work but that
[53:39] work was creation work
[53:42] oh praise god it was creation work but
[53:46] there's another work hallelujah to
[53:49] complete
[53:50] this other work to do
[53:52] that's why when gossip in that image
[53:55] called adam hallelujah adam was supposed
[53:58] to continue the work
[54:00] hallelujah no wonder why when the bible
[54:03] said god brought the animals to adam to
[54:06] see what adam would name them that was a
[54:09] work
[54:10] hallelujah and whatever had them named
[54:12] them it was saul
[54:17] john chapter 4
[54:19] verse 34 jesus said my meat
[54:23] my need is to do the will
[54:26] of my father that has sent me
[54:29] and
[54:30] and to finish his work
[54:35] oh
[54:36] praise god
[54:38] i told her the work was finished
[54:41] what work
[54:42] the creation work is finished
[54:45] [Laughter]
[54:47] but there's a work of god
[54:49] hallelujah that has to continue
[54:53] oh praise god he said to finish his work
[54:57] my meat is to do the will of him that
[55:01] sent me and to finish his work
[55:04] we see today many people get so
[55:06] complacent
[55:09] they said oh i want to go into the
[55:11] rapture
[55:13] i want to go home i'm tired of this
[55:15] world
[55:17] can i say this to you
[55:20] once you're predestinated for the
[55:22] rupture
[55:24] you cannot leave the scene until you
[55:27] finish the work
[55:32] hallelujah
[55:36] can i continue
[55:40] you better put on your seatbelt
[55:44] oh praise god in order for you to leave
[55:47] the scene you have to finish the work
[55:50] jesus couldn't leave the scene until he
[55:52] finished the work
[55:54] hallelujah
[55:55] in saint john 17 verse 5 he said my hour
[56:00] is come
[56:01] hallelujah
[56:03] and i have finished the work
[56:06] that's why jesus could leave before
[56:09] hallelujah before the work was finished
[56:12] he could not leave the scene
[56:14] even when hallelujah peter said master
[56:17] if you're going to jerusalem they're
[56:19] going to kill you they could not kill
[56:21] him
[56:23] because the work wasn't finished
[56:27] what is the work
[56:29] the work is the revealing the character
[56:33] of god
[56:35] the work is to reveal the attribute of
[56:39] god
[56:41] all that was in god was in christ jesus
[56:45] hallelujah
[56:47] oh praise god
[56:48] and god wanted to reveal himself to the
[56:52] world
[56:53] god wants to express himself to the
[56:56] world hallelujah that's why he stepped
[56:59] him he stepped into a body called jesus
[57:03] to express himself and jesus was the
[57:07] fullness of the godhead bodily
[57:11] hallelujah
[57:13] oh praise god it was the fullness of the
[57:16] godhead bodily
[57:18] no wonder why hallelujah when the
[57:21] prophet isaiah said and his name shall
[57:24] be called emmanuel
[57:26] meaning god with us
[57:30] hallelujah god with us
[57:32] hallelujah when jesus was walking he was
[57:35] not just a literal man he was god with
[57:39] his people
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:43] his name was called emmanuel mean god
[57:46] with us
[57:49] and the word of god said hallelujah he
[57:52] gave gifts unto men
[57:55] for the perfecting of the saints
[57:58] for the work of the ministries to work
[58:01] again
[58:02] for the work of the ministry because the
[58:04] work has to finish
[58:07] the work has to continue because god the
[58:11] bible said god was in christ reconciling
[58:15] the world unto himself
[58:18] and the word reconciled means to restore
[58:23] hallelujah because hallelujah man had
[58:27] fallen
[58:28] hallelujah from the grace of god
[58:31] no matter what brother paul said all
[58:34] that i've seen and come short of the
[58:37] glory of god
[58:39] hallelujah so when christ came on the
[58:42] scene great was god bringing back men
[58:45] back to himself
[58:47] hallelujah reconciling the world unto
[58:51] himself
[58:53] oh praise god but when jesus leave the
[58:56] sea now hallelujah that was jesus work
[59:00] hallelujah
[59:02] and now the bible said in section 14
[59:05] either believe it in me
[59:08] and believe in the works that i do
[59:11] even greater works than these you shall
[59:14] do
[59:19] amen
[59:21] the paul said we have
[59:24] we have the word
[59:26] we have the word of reconciliation we
[59:29] have the ministry of reconciliation
[59:33] oh jesus
[59:35] hallelujah
[59:36] look at this woman
[59:38] jesus said i must have needs
[59:42] pass through samaria
[59:44] i must have needs
[59:46] hallelujah he has to re he has to
[59:49] reconcile
[59:51] because he has that ministry
[59:54] but there was something inside of him
[59:57] that was pulling him
[59:58] hallelujah
[1:00:00] oh glory to god
[1:00:03] hallelujah
[1:00:04] in those days the jews and the samaritan
[1:00:07] has no dealing
[1:00:10] hallelujah
[1:00:11] but the work of god
[1:00:13] must continue the work of god must
[1:00:16] accomplish hallelujah accomplish to give
[1:00:20] god the glory
[1:00:22] hallelujah and jesus said i must have
[1:00:24] needs to go to
[1:00:26] samaria oh praise god
[1:00:31] the disciples could not understand
[1:00:34] they didn't understand the plan of god
[1:00:37] they didn't understand the work of god
[1:00:39] hallelujah
[1:00:41] they thought that the work was just only
[1:00:44] given to the jews
[1:00:47] hallelujah
[1:00:48] but jesus said i must have needs
[1:00:52] and he said you know what
[1:00:54] go to the village go buy meat
[1:00:58] oh praise god
[1:01:00] and the bible said when he went to the
[1:01:02] well there was this woman hallelujah at
[1:01:06] the world that come to draw water
[1:01:09] you know what she was a doctor of
[1:01:11] abraham
[1:01:15] hallelujah
[1:01:16] oh praise god
[1:01:19] jesus saw her
[1:01:21] in the beginning hallelujah he saw that
[1:01:24] predestinated seed from the beginning
[1:01:27] that's why i said i must have needs to
[1:01:30] go to summer here hallelujah he said the
[1:01:33] son cannot do nothing of himself but
[1:01:36] while they see the father do it the son
[1:01:38] do it likewise
[1:01:41] so he was being led
[1:01:43] it was the father that was showing him
[1:01:46] all those that belong to him
[1:01:52] hallelujah
[1:01:54] i tell you when you belong to god
[1:01:56] god shall come on the scene for you
[1:01:59] and he's come personal
[1:02:05] oh my mama
[1:02:07] you may not experience he may not
[1:02:10] whether he expect him to come hallelujah
[1:02:12] but he come
[1:02:14] when adam was falling when adam fell
[1:02:18] the bible said the voice of god
[1:02:21] he walketh in the cool of the garden
[1:02:25] hallelujah so is it today in this eden
[1:02:29] it's the voice of god that is walking
[1:02:32] again
[1:02:33] hallelujah
[1:02:34] but this time he's walking in our body
[1:02:39] hallelujah
[1:02:41] he's working on our body
[1:02:43] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:02:46] fate
[1:02:48] wow
[1:02:50] the faith
[1:02:52] the faith is christ
[1:02:55] hallelujah is speaking of christ
[1:02:59] this the faith is different from first
[1:03:02] corinthians 12
[1:03:06] when the word of god said when paul said
[1:03:08] con first corinthians 12 verse 1
[1:03:11] concerning spiritual gifts
[1:03:16] hallelujah
[1:03:18] oh praise god
[1:03:20] and brother paul started to list out the
[1:03:22] nine spiritual gifts
[1:03:24] and he said
[1:03:26] faith
[1:03:27] hallelujah
[1:03:29] faith he never said the faith
[1:03:32] let's just let us read it
[1:03:34] hallelujah
[1:03:36] first corinthians 12
[1:03:39] verse 1 now
[1:03:41] it's a now concerning spiritual kiss
[1:03:43] bridging
[1:03:45] i would not have you ignorant
[1:03:50] oh god look at first
[1:03:52] look at verse four
[1:03:55] now they are diversities
[1:03:59] and diversities mean different
[1:04:02] they are different
[1:04:04] [Laughter]
[1:04:06] glory to god
[1:04:08] diversities of gifts
[1:04:10] but the same
[1:04:12] spirit
[1:04:14] hallelujah
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:17] praise god
[1:04:21] and there are diversities of operations
[1:04:25] but it is the same god which worketh all
[1:04:28] in all
[1:04:30] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[1:04:33] given to every man
[1:04:35] to profit with all
[1:04:37] for one it is given by the spirit the
[1:04:40] word of wisdom
[1:04:43] to another
[1:04:44] the word of knowledge
[1:04:46] by the same spirit
[1:04:48] to another fate
[1:04:52] you never see you never see the fate
[1:04:54] here
[1:04:55] he said to another fate
[1:04:59] but when brother paul said when brother
[1:05:01] paul used
[1:05:03] use faith instead in the unity of
[1:05:06] the
[1:05:08] he used the word the meaning specific
[1:05:15] he was specific
[1:05:19] he was speaking about christ
[1:05:22] hallelujah because faith is a revelation
[1:05:27] when jesus said to peter hallelujah
[1:05:31] flesh and blood did not reveal this to
[1:05:34] you
[1:05:35] but my father which is in heaven
[1:05:38] hallelujah he said this is a divine
[1:05:41] revelation
[1:05:44] faith is a revelation
[1:05:47] it's a divine revelation it has to be
[1:05:50] revealed to you
[1:05:53] oh my god
[1:05:55] it's not written
[1:05:57] it's not written it has been revealed
[1:06:02] when something is written
[1:06:05] you read it
[1:06:06] right
[1:06:07] but it has to be revealed
[1:06:13] romans 1 verse 17.
[1:06:17] oh praise god

[1:12:07] what a place
[1:12:08] that's a place we want to be found in
[1:12:10] him
[1:12:12] not in a church
[1:12:15] but in christ
[1:12:18] this is not right
[1:12:20] oh my god and be found in him
[1:12:25] you know
[1:12:25] i don't know if they
[1:12:27] if you heard us they used to sing the

[1:12:30] that you know
[1:12:32] when people die don't come search
[1:12:35] because i will be around the troll
[1:12:39] but you know what we don't sing that
[1:12:41] song

[1:12:45] when you're in christ you're in your
[1:12:47] position
[1:12:51] oh praise god
[1:12:55] and be found in him not having my own
[1:13:00] righteousness
[1:13:02] rich is your own righteousness is a
[1:13:04] flock
[1:13:07] what do you think
[1:13:08] isaiah said
[1:13:10] holiday our righteousness is us filthy
[1:13:13] rugs
[1:13:15] our righteousness is as filthy runs
[1:13:20] brother paul is saying my right my whole
[1:13:22] righteousness is of the law
[1:13:26] that righteousness is contrary
[1:13:30] it's contrary to the word it's contrary
[1:13:33] to the spirit
[1:13:35] hallelujah
[1:13:36] look at it
[1:13:39] but that is true
[1:13:41] the faith of christ
[1:13:44] the righteousness riches of god by faith
[1:13:49] that's what brother paul wanted to
[1:13:51] establish
[1:13:54] hallelujah you have two righteousness
[1:13:56] one of the law
[1:13:58] and one that is of god
[1:14:00] and this that is of god it comes through

[1:14:04] that's what god that's what please god
[1:14:08] your own righteousness cannot please god
[1:14:12] although the righteousness of god can
[1:14:14] please him

[1:14:42] being revealed from faith to faith
[1:14:46] hallelujah
[1:14:48] so when he revealed to you look at what
[1:14:50] brother paul said in verse 10
[1:14:52] that i
[1:14:54] may know him
[1:14:57] peter said thou art the christ how could
[1:14:59] peter know that
[1:15:01] it was divine revelation
[1:15:05] so the righteousness of god revealed to
[1:15:08] you crisis
[1:15:13] hallelujah he revealed who christ and
[1:15:16] once he revealed who christ is to you
[1:15:18] he's going to reveal who you are

[1:15:28] may know him
[1:15:30] and the power of his resurrection
[1:15:34] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:15:37] be made conformable unto his death
[1:15:42] if by means
[1:15:44] i might attain unto the resurrection of
[1:15:46] death
[1:15:49] brother person i want to know him
[1:15:52] i want to know him and the power of his
[1:15:55] resurrection
[1:15:56] you see because brother is it because
[1:15:58] brother paul know him he said to the
[1:16:01] galatians
[1:16:02] i could not leave galatia yet
[1:16:05] hallelujah until he said i travail with
[1:16:08] you until christ be forming you
[1:16:14] oh amen because he know christ
[1:16:18] that's why he travailed with them until
[1:16:22] he saw christ form in them
[1:16:25] hallelujah
[1:16:27] glory to god the purpose of god
[1:16:30] hallelujah is for his sons to understand
[1:16:33] who they are
[1:16:34] to take your position upon the hurt as
[1:16:38] sons of god
[1:16:40] hallelujah because he has given you the
[1:16:43] authority to do it
[1:16:47] the world cannot know the world will not
[1:16:50] know god by this
[1:16:56] as a matter of fact they've been reading
[1:16:57] this for about thousand and half years
[1:17:02] and yet even today they still do not
[1:17:05] know him
[1:17:10] this same book
[1:17:11] they have been reading it
[1:17:13] and they still don't know him
[1:17:17] in order for them to know god they have
[1:17:20] to know you
[1:17:24] oh jesus
[1:17:27] hallelujah
[1:17:32] look at it
[1:17:34] when jesus came they were reading the
[1:17:36] scroll
[1:17:38] but they still didn't know
[1:17:40] they didn't know jesus
[1:17:46] the woman of the world he said sir i
[1:17:49] perceive that the water profit
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:55] i perceive that the water profit
[1:17:58] she never she never read a scroll
[1:18:01] she saw the vindication
[1:18:04] of a prophet
[1:18:05] she saw the sign of a prophet
[1:18:10] those pharisees and hierarchy hallelujah
[1:18:13] they were really in the schools
[1:18:15] and they could not know him they did not
[1:18:17] know him
[1:18:20] hallelujah
[1:18:21] and then
[1:18:23] jesus said jesus said to her you know
[1:18:25] what
[1:18:26] the messiah is going to come
[1:18:30] she said we know we know that the
[1:18:32] messiah is going to come
[1:18:34] and when he come he shall tell us tell
[1:18:36] us all these things jesus said
[1:18:38] human i am he that speaketh unto you is
[1:18:42] the messiah
[1:18:45] he revealed himself to her
[1:18:50] hallelujah
[1:18:51] glory to god
[1:18:53] so the world cannot know god by reading
[1:18:56] this
[1:18:59] as a matter of fact the more they read
[1:19:01] this is the more evil they do
[1:19:05] there has to know god by knowing you
[1:19:10] by seeing god in you
[1:19:16] hallelujah
[1:19:17] what about the people
[1:19:19] we cannot read
[1:19:22] who cannot read
[1:19:25] or can you bring god to them
[1:19:28] by bringing yourself to them
[1:19:34] those that cannot read by seeing you
[1:19:37] you know there's something different
[1:19:39] about you
[1:19:42] i see god in you
[1:19:44] jesus
[1:19:46] you have a different spirit
[1:19:48] there's a different anointing about you
[1:19:51] you don't have the anointing of that
[1:19:53] church over there
[1:19:55] there's something about your anointing
[1:20:00] hallelujah
[1:20:02] you see i can see the grace of god in
[1:20:04] your life
[1:20:06] hallelujah
[1:20:08] all glory to god because they see the
[1:20:10] expression of christ
[1:20:13] they see god expressed to them
[1:20:16] and by god being expressed to them they

[1:20:25] hallelujah i want to go where you go
[1:20:30] hallelujah i want to live where you live
[1:20:35] where i live i live in the presence

[1:21:01] jesus
[1:21:03] the word of god said
[1:21:06] holy for the edifying
[1:21:09] of the body of christ
[1:21:11] oh my god look at it
[1:21:14] the word edifying means to construct
[1:21:18] it means to build
[1:21:21] this body of christ is not talking about
[1:21:24] jesus natural
[1:21:27] first corinthians 12 verse 27 now
[1:21:32] you can underline that word now
[1:21:35] he never said you will or you are going
[1:21:38] to be
[1:21:39] he said
[1:21:40] now now are you
[1:21:45] present tense
[1:21:47] why
[1:21:48] because you receive the spirit of god
[1:21:51] he's not speaking about a different age
[1:21:55] oh in a different dispensation he's
[1:21:57] speaking about now
[1:21:59] now are you
[1:22:01] the body of christ
[1:22:03] hallelujah
[1:22:07] praise god
[1:22:09] now are you the body of christ
[1:22:13] when a revelation struck you
[1:22:15] you're not looking for tomorrow to be
[1:22:17] the body of christ
[1:22:20] you're not looking for next year to be
[1:22:22] the body of christ now hallelujah that
[1:22:25] transforms you right now and you step
[1:22:28] into that position
[1:22:31] hallelujah
[1:22:32] and when you are the body of christ you
[1:22:34] get to work
[1:22:38] a work to be done
[1:22:39] hallelujah
[1:22:41] oh hallelujah
[1:22:43] praise god
[1:22:46] now are you the body of christ
[1:22:49] it's for the edifying of the body of
[1:22:51] christ
[1:22:53] jesus said
[1:22:54] peter
[1:22:57] peter
[1:22:59] the devil is after you to sift you like
[1:23:02] weed
[1:23:04] but
[1:23:05] i have prayed for you
[1:23:08] i have already prayed for you
[1:23:10] and when you are converted i like the
[1:23:13] word converting
[1:23:16] you know if jesus never used that word
[1:23:18] converted people would say peter they
[1:23:20] converted long time
[1:23:25] oh god
[1:23:27] people would say that peter was
[1:23:28] converted
[1:23:30] when god called peter and anointed him
[1:23:33] call him send him out
[1:23:35] the bible said even the devils were
[1:23:38] afraid of them even the devils were
[1:23:41] subjected but that was just an anointing
[1:23:45] hallelujah
[1:23:46] that was just an anointing
[1:23:48] the anointing can come upon anybody
[1:23:52] but the conversion
[1:23:54] only come upon the son of god
[1:23:59] hallelujah
[1:24:01] glory to god
[1:24:03] anybody can be anointed
[1:24:06] you know
[1:24:07] the bible said
[1:24:09] jesus god hallelujah
[1:24:12] he anointed the donkey the mule to speak
[1:24:15] to a prophet
[1:24:17] how could the meal speak to a prophet
[1:24:19] because he was anointed
[1:24:22] the raven bring meat to a prophet
[1:24:25] because he the raven was anointed
[1:24:29] so anybody can be anointed
[1:24:34] but only a son of god can get the
[1:24:42] conversion when they were converted
[1:24:48] oh my god
[1:24:50] when noah converted strengthen your
[1:24:53] bridges
[1:24:56] and when you
[1:24:57] when you're converted hallelujah this is
[1:25:00] we're talking about the body of christ

[1:25:05] know what is my purpose but a deal
[1:25:07] i've been in church for years and years
[1:25:09] i don't know what is my purpose
[1:25:12] why why call me

[1:25:21] bridging
[1:25:23] and that word strengthen that doesn't
[1:25:25] mean say you can take the bible and go

[1:26:37] is losing faith in god

[1:28:09] 12 persons in his church
