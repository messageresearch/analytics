[26:36] may we have you have a seat please
[26:45] I'm thrilled to be around the Bride of
[26:48] Jesus Christ
[26:52] one of the great things
[26:55] in the message is that wherever you go
[26:59] the Bride of Jesus Christ is the same
[27:02] thing everywhere
[27:05] in Africa in Europe
[27:08] in Canada in United States
[27:11] in Asia
[27:13] we
[27:16] use when we come together
[27:20] we know that we
[27:22] are in the presence of our father
[27:26] I want to thank brother Dale and his
[27:30] wife yesterday when we came and they
[27:33] really gave us a good hospitality and
[27:37] we we feel at home I I feel at home I
[27:43] just want to thank our sister and
[27:45] brother
[27:46] and also I came with my family my wife
[27:50] and my my four children and my
[27:55] granddaughter
[27:56] and my my brother in the scene who came
[28:00] from he came from Nigeria to visit and
[28:04] when I told you that I I was coming here
[28:08] and he said he he would like to come
[28:10] with us and we we thank God for bringing
[28:14] us here yeah just for
[28:17] identification's sake I just want my
[28:19] family to stand so that they can yeah
[28:25] thank you
[28:27] and that's my brother from Nigeria I saw
[28:30] an old is an old veterans
[28:35] well before I when I came here it says
[28:40] yesterday I've been
[28:42] asking God what direction he want me to
[28:46] to speak on because
[28:49] there's no human being have ability
[28:52] to give any human being something
[28:55] there is no way I can know what you're
[28:58] going through even if I know what you're
[28:59] going through I can help you
[29:02] therefore the only way is God coming
[29:05] down
[29:06] and design what is in your heart and
[29:09] what you'll need are and because
[29:11] whatever God does he does it by the
[29:14] means of his word
[29:16] if you are sick God will heal you by
[29:19] means of his word
[29:20] but the Bible said I signed his word and
[29:23] the world heal it therefore when you
[29:26] whatever you need to not eat this money
[29:29] just rest assured that God will meet
[29:32] that need
[29:35] well before I go on to speak I think my
[29:40] brother and my daughter I have a song to
[29:43] sing and I want to give them the
[29:46] opportunity for them to come and

[34:57] [Music]
[35:05] [Music]
[35:12] [Music]
[35:14] foreign
[35:16] [Music]
[35:33] [Applause]
[35:37] God bless you
[35:39] that was a wonderful song and
[35:42] uh also before I go on I want to bring
[35:46] greetings from my pastor Pastor Samuel
[35:50] Gerard from the Scarborough spoken World
[35:54] Church
[35:55] I I am not a pastor I am I'm just just a
[36:01] brother
[36:02] and I love the Lord
[36:04] I
[36:06] I'm I'm a kind of my my gift is just to
[36:11] share the world and
[36:14] Mission missionary by calling I I love
[36:17] to win souls
[36:19] and uh the you see when God has
[36:24] varieties that's why we have five food
[36:27] Minister we have pastors we have uh for
[36:30] me uh God is not coming to be a pastor
[36:34] uh the weight that the pastor carrier I
[36:38] don't think I'm designed to carry such a
[36:41] weight therefore God give me another way
[36:44] to be able to minister to the Bride of
[36:47] Jesus Christ I just went to Africa about
[36:52] a few few months ago I was in Africa for
[36:56] six weeks
[36:57] from Mauritius I was in Mauritius from
[37:00] Mauritius I went to Madagascar from
[37:04] Madagascar I went to Ghana and spreading
[37:07] the Gospel of Jesus Christ and we thank
[37:10] God we see we say when you go out on the
[37:14] feed you see the part of God in in
[37:16] display because
[37:19] God said this sign shall follow them
[37:22] that believe
[37:23] therefore when you go on the prophet
[37:26] said when God sent you
[37:28] he doesn't send you go goes with you
[37:31] therefore whenever we go on the mission
[37:34] feed uh we are not afraid what we are
[37:37] going to meet because it is it is not us
[37:40] it's Jesus Christ looking for his bride
[37:43] wherever they are
[37:45] and this after this morning I know that
[37:50] uh we are living in a very terrible time
[37:54] people don't know what to do many uh in
[37:57] drugs because they think drugs can help
[38:00] them many uh become alcoholic because
[38:04] they think that's only way to to Fat off
[38:07] the the problem they are going through
[38:09] but this there's a little bride on Earth
[38:12] today
[38:13] Now find a place of Refuge and which is
[38:17] the blood the blood of Jesus Christ and
[38:20] that is why I love that song that they
[38:22] just sung about Grace
[38:25] is it for us to receive this message it
[38:29] has to be pure grace
[38:31] it has it has nothing to do with the
[38:34] ability he has nothing to do with the
[38:37] family you came from whether you are
[38:39] rich or poor no it has to be God coming
[38:42] down to meet you where you are
[38:47] uh uh that is why I'm happy every time I
[38:52] stand in the front of the Bride of Jesus
[38:54] Christ I don't take that lightly
[38:57] because the Bride of Jesus Christ this
[38:59] is the wife of Jesus Christ therefore we
[39:02] have to be very careful how we we talk
[39:04] to them we don't want to beat the Bride
[39:07] of Jesus Christ down I am here and not
[39:09] to beat and the bride I'm here to lift
[39:12] the bread of Jesus Christ up
[39:14] and that is I believe that's what God
[39:17] has called me
[39:19] giving us the fight for the ministry of
[39:22] reconciliation
[39:23] to know that whatever you are going
[39:26] through here is temporary basis
[39:29] you are here for a purpose the reason
[39:31] why God came into this this town every
[39:35] look at Connor Jesus Christ have his
[39:37] pride and I'm thankful that I am
[39:41] identifying with the bride of Jesus
[39:43] Christ here

[43:37] God we thank you your praise in Jesus
[43:41] precious name amen
[43:43] amen
[43:47] as we read from Genesis John chapter
[43:51] one starting from verse one he said in
[43:54] the beginning
[43:55] was the one and the world was with God
[43:58] and the world was God
[44:00] the same in the beginning was God all
[44:05] things were made by him and without him
[44:07] was not was anything made that was made
[44:11] in him was life and the life was the
[44:15] light of men and the light shattered in
[44:18] the darkness and the Darkness
[44:19] comprehended not there was a man sent
[44:22] from God whose name was John the same
[44:25] came for a witness to Bear witness of
[44:29] the light that all men threw him my
[44:32] belief he was not that light but he was
[44:35] sent to Bear the witness of that light
[44:38] that
[44:39] that was a True Light which lighted
[44:42] every man that commented into the world
[44:45] he was in the world and the world was
[44:48] made by him and and the one knew him not
[44:52] and he came to his own and his old
[44:54] receiving not but as many as receive him
[44:58] to them he gave him power to become the
[45:01] sons of God even to them that believe on
[45:04] his name which were born not of blood or
[45:08] not the will of Flesh none of the will
[45:10] of man but of God and the Word was made
[45:13] flesh and dwell among us and we behead
[45:16] his glory the glory as of only begotten
[45:20] of the father full of grace and truth
[45:23] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[45:26] word you may have your seat
[45:31] the
[45:34] when I was coming here I was just
[45:36] deliberating asking God praying said
[45:39] Lord
[45:41] what will you have me to say
[45:46] to
[45:49] because we are living in a time where a
[45:53] lot of people
[45:55] from different churches around the world
[45:58] they don't know who God is
[46:01] and it is only the pride of Jesus Christ
[46:04] who can serve a fatically that they know
[46:08] who God is
[46:10] there are people that told us when we
[46:12] were in the denomination they told us
[46:14] that God is three
[46:16] some said God is too
[46:19] some people don't even know they have
[46:22] that this kind of imaginary God in their
[46:25] head they don't know that God is a man
[46:28] God is a big they are confused
[46:31] but there is a bride on the Earth today
[46:33] they are not confused of who God is they
[46:37] are not confused of their identity
[46:39] because this bride know where they came
[46:42] from we are not here we are not Earthly
[46:45] Bank creatures we are in town
[46:48] Eternal being and we are here for a
[46:51] specific purpose therefore our coming to
[46:54] our gathering here this morning is not
[46:57] for for me to for you to see this the
[47:00] the clothes that I wear on the clothes
[47:02] that you put on that is not the reason
[47:04] why we are here we are here because God
[47:07] brought us here we are here for a
[47:09] specific purpose
[47:13] I as I was thinking about that
[47:16] I felt because there's a line of thought
[47:20] that have been going on that God has
[47:23] been allowed me to to preach on in our
[47:25] church and I felt uh I was because I I
[47:29] felt in my spirit that I should continue
[47:31] that because the Bride of Jesus Christ
[47:34] is one and when the Holy Spirit is
[47:37] preaching in Africa you can see the same
[47:40] holy spirit is preaching the same thing
[47:42] here and that is what God is doing
[47:44] because God is not just localizing one
[47:47] place God is God of all the whole world
[47:52] therefore my
[47:56] what I wanted to talk about is
[47:59] God
[48:01] becoming tangible in you
[48:05] God
[48:07] who created heaven and earth
[48:09] becoming tangible
[48:11] in me in you therefore
[48:14] make that that title
[48:18] give us a clue that you are not just a
[48:21] flesh being
[48:24] therefore you are not just
[48:27] 60 elements
[48:29] you are more than that therefore there's
[48:33] something God put in you that money
[48:36] can't buy
[48:37] there's something God put in you that
[48:40] the prophet saw Adam's
[48:42] what is you is able to speak word and
[48:47] you go and live in it therefore there's
[48:50] something that is controlling that
[48:51] therefore when we go through our our
[48:55] trial day by day
[48:57] we have the tendency because we are
[49:00] living in this flesh we have the
[49:02] tendency to believe that oh we are such
[49:05] a a miserable sinner we are here just to
[49:09] make money go have a good life and die
[49:11] and that's it no that our purpose why we
[49:16] are here is more than that
[49:19] therefore
[49:21] this God who created heaven and earth
[49:23] right from the beginning has a plan
[49:27] and that plan was he wanted to come into
[49:30] this Earth and share his eternal life
[49:33] with you and with me
[49:36] therefore in doing that you see God
[49:41] everything that you see today that is
[49:44] happening bad or good is revealing God
[49:49] your mistake and your failure
[49:52] your trials
[49:54] everything that you go through every day
[49:57] if you if you can just sit quietly
[50:02] you will find out that one there is a
[50:05] purpose behind it
[50:07] and that purpose is God trying to reveal
[50:10] himself
[50:12] and most of the time we allow our Triad
[50:16] we get overwhelmed
[50:19] because of certain things and if you
[50:22] just keep seeing
[50:25] if you just wait if you just give God
[50:28] time if you just be patient with God you
[50:32] will find out that for a child of God
[50:34] there is nothing that is advocated
[50:37] for a child of God there is nothing that
[50:39] he told there is nothing that is out of
[50:42] place
[50:42] you might be thinking oh why you go
[50:45] through this why you go through that yes
[50:47] the reason why you go through that is
[50:49] there's a plan and purpose behind it
[50:52] which you have not fully understand that
[50:55] that if you give time
[50:58] God will be able to show it to you he
[51:00] said this is the reason why this was
[51:02] this
[51:03] and when you and as this time goes on
[51:06] you when God begin to unveil to you you
[51:10] love God the more
[51:12] you you you said God I thank you but we
[51:15] are the time you were going through it
[51:17] it was not easy
[51:19] but when you come out of it you can look
[51:21] back and begin to trace where you came
[51:24] from
[51:25] and you begin to stress what you have
[51:27] been through the ups and down the
[51:29] difficult times you have been through
[51:31] you see that God everything time you go
[51:35] through trying some problems God was
[51:38] always there
[51:44] in the beginning
[51:46] in the unveiling of God the prophet told
[51:49] her and said
[51:51] paragraph
[51:53] 84 he said
[51:54] God the almighty God
[51:58] The God Who created heaven and earth
[52:01] he said he was Elohim the internal
[52:04] he said but in him
[52:06] was
[52:07] thoughts
[52:10] that anytime read that
[52:13] because I know what thought is well
[52:15] sometimes when I sit down by myself I
[52:17] start thinking
[52:19] let's say for example I'm here I said I
[52:21] want to travel to to uh to Toronto
[52:24] before I set up the journey I have to
[52:26] think about it
[52:28] therefore might the way I think and
[52:31] God's thought is quite different
[52:33] therefore when God thought of anything
[52:35] the minute God thinks about it what God
[52:39] think is real and it's internal
[52:42] nothing can change it therefore God has
[52:46] thought is that but in him what thoughts
[52:49] he wanted to become material
[52:52] therefore God wanted to be material God
[52:56] wanted to to be touched God wanted to be
[53:00] fed God wants to come and walk on the
[53:02] street unless somebody touch him
[53:04] that is what God wanted he said but what
[53:08] did he do after he thought of done being
[53:11] material
[53:12] what did he do next
[53:14] God the prophet said God then he spoke
[53:18] the word
[53:20] materialize
[53:23] therefore if if what God spoke
[53:26] naturalized
[53:28] whether the people whether they thought
[53:31] that man to realize yeah it was you are
[53:34] the one that God thought of and when God
[53:37] spoke it it might have taken billions of
[53:40] years
[53:42] God was in transit in many different
[53:45] ways
[53:46] and you were with in transit when God
[53:49] led the internal spirit
[53:52] when God who was internal Spirit he
[53:55] thought he conceived God was the first
[53:57] thing the first
[54:00] well now we call it the the first idea
[54:03] about conceiving
[54:05] I conceive God conceived a thought
[54:08] and maybe that thought God conceived
[54:10] might have been billions of years
[54:13] billions of years to become material and
[54:17] he holds that
[54:18] he carried out from billions and
[54:21] billions of years that he want to become
[54:24] material he wants to be in flesh he
[54:27] wants to be a carpenter he wants to be a
[54:30] pastor he wants to be an evangelist he
[54:32] want to be a housewife he want to be a
[54:35] piano that was conceived in the mind of
[54:38] God for billions of years
[54:43] but that thought could not materialize
[54:47] in that internal
[54:50] space
[54:52] therefore God now had to take another
[54:54] first step
[54:56] God had to create time to move others
[54:59] thoughts
[55:00] that was him
[55:02] into time
[55:04] and when he come out the prophet said
[55:06] that eternity was like it's like a
[55:08] circle
[55:10] therefore he create a hickey
[55:13] than to bring all the thoughts out into
[55:16] the internal eternity into another stage
[55:20] of his condescension
[55:25] now listen to what the prophet said
[55:28] is that he spoke the word and the one
[55:30] naturalized that is the whole picture
[55:33] from Genesis to Revolution
[55:36] listen
[55:38] the Bible we are holding that this that
[55:41] is the life the revelation of Jesus
[55:43] Christ from Genesis to revelation
[55:46] therefore the prophet is telling us that
[55:49] when he spoke the word
[55:52] the one naturalized that is the whole
[55:56] picture
[55:57] from Genesis to Revelation therefore
[56:01] when God moved out from eternity into
[56:03] the logos
[56:05] where he begins to speak so let there be
[56:07] this let there be that let there be this
[56:11] me and you we are in him
[56:15] therefore when God spoke
[56:17] when God spoke
[56:19] you spoke with him
[56:23] when God said let them be at you were in
[56:26] him who spoke that
[56:30] therefore when God said let there be
[56:32] light let there be this we were in him
[56:35] because Christ is male and female
[56:40] Devon what am I doing this morning I'm
[56:43] trying to let you know that we are not
[56:46] just early born creature
[56:50] we came from God
[56:52] we are going back to God
[56:55] and we and the transition we me and you
[56:59] is what God is depending on to finish
[57:01] the program of redemption
[57:04] therefore don't let the devil put you in
[57:06] a corner to tell you you are not
[57:08] important I'm here to tell you you are
[57:11] important in the plan of God
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:17] he said
[57:18] this is that's the whole picture
[57:22] from Genesis to revelation
[57:24] it's not the wrong it's Elohim
[57:26] naturalizing
[57:28] so he can be touched
[57:32] and feel
[57:35] that is what God wanted
[57:38] therefore anytime you read any time
[57:41] somebody received the Holy Ghost what
[57:43] happened
[57:45] every brothers and sisters who have the
[57:48] Holy Ghost here is the Mighty God coming
[57:51] to dwell in Tabernacle of Flesh
[57:55] therefore the prophet told us that deity
[57:58] is not in heaven
[58:00] there it is is here in this church right
[58:04] now
[58:05] therefore God come to worship God came
[58:08] down God Drive God is standing up
[58:11] pooping God he said amen to his word
[58:15] that is what God's plan was at the
[58:18] beginning
[58:20] is God becoming materialized is God is
[58:24] becoming he wants to be fed he wants to
[58:27] be touched he want to do what everybody
[58:30] see everybody doing today God wanted the
[58:34] highway and drive
[58:36] God wants to cook in the kitchen
[58:38] God wants to God wants to live his life
[58:41] through you through me that is what he
[58:44] thought he said and in the millennium
[58:49] there is Elohim sitting on the throne
[58:55] that's right
[58:56] with all his subjects around him
[59:00] or
[59:02] his children in the Millennium God will
[59:04] be sitting with all his subjects because
[59:08] that is what he wanted
[59:11] although when he speak that God allow
[59:15] you see God is God of variety
[59:19] God
[59:21] is God who want to
[59:24] bring his plan and purpose
[59:27] and in this picture I call it
[59:31] the movie of redemption
[59:35] is it God who plan out everything
[59:39] before God start this movie he already
[59:42] finished it before he started
[59:45] therefore when God started this in his
[59:48] mind everything that he wanted to
[59:50] accomplish on Earth God finish it now he
[59:54] saw that and let the movie begin to play
[59:58] and why he was that movie was essential
[1:00:03] God is sitting there and saying you know
[1:00:05] I thought of my brother coming from
[1:00:07] Nigeria to be here
[1:00:10] to sit on the front row that was in the
[1:00:12] movie
[1:00:14] when you are sitting down today it was
[1:00:17] in the movie where God said you will be
[1:00:19] in the church today and that is what God
[1:00:22] saw
[1:00:23] and anything come to a child of God
[1:00:26] saying listen he said oh
[1:00:28] of his subject with around him
[1:00:31] that he that he predestinated before the
[1:00:35] foundation of the world
[1:00:39] now in a message
[1:00:41] what
[1:00:43] we shall see Jesus paragraph 60 69 the
[1:00:46] prophet said now what is a word
[1:00:49] a word is taught expressed
[1:00:53] you take it before you express it
[1:00:57] therefore God talked about you
[1:01:00] God thought about you
[1:01:03] to the vision in this time God thought
[1:01:06] about you that and at the time when the
[1:01:09] whole world is come in complete darkness
[1:01:12] when the whole world don't know what to
[1:01:14] do when the church are so confused and
[1:01:17] the devil are taking the church like a
[1:01:20] plate like a toy is that there will be a
[1:01:23] people on the Earth that they will be
[1:01:25] able to receive the work when the world
[1:01:27] comes to them
[1:01:28] and that is why you are here because God
[1:01:31] thought about you and when you talked
[1:01:33] about you I've been a son he spoke it
[1:01:37] and when they spoke it it might have
[1:01:39] taken billions of years
[1:01:41] but because when God speak God can take
[1:01:44] it back
[1:01:46] God can't change it
[1:01:48] your sin can change the plan the thought
[1:01:50] of God that God is concerning you it
[1:01:54] doesn't matter
[1:01:55] whatever your your situation he is here
[1:01:58] does not change what God talked about
[1:02:01] you if God talked about you as a bride
[1:02:04] there is no power there is no demon
[1:02:06] there is no condition that can change
[1:02:09] that because when God speaks
[1:02:11] that is forever settled
[1:02:15] therefore you are an Express thought of
[1:02:19] God May manifest in this day
[1:02:22] you know
[1:02:24] I like to play soccer
[1:02:28] when you are playing a league
[1:02:31] or you are playing for a World Cup
[1:02:34] you don't choose mediocre
[1:02:38] to play
[1:02:39] that you you sell it
[1:02:42] The Best of the Best
[1:02:44] it's only in part of Africa that the
[1:02:47] light they allow polities
[1:02:50] to get into their way they they choose
[1:02:53] bad and good they mix it up but if you
[1:02:56] are you irresistible a coach
[1:03:01] what do we do
[1:03:02] is to look for the best
[1:03:05] of the best
[1:03:07] not to let the best you look for the
[1:03:09] best Striker
[1:03:11] and the best record is not somebody who
[1:03:13] takes soccer and he wants to show up
[1:03:16] no it's somebody to take a sucker and
[1:03:20] his mindset is to is to score
[1:03:24] therefore they don't they put somebody
[1:03:27] who is really really want to score they
[1:03:31] put them on the center field
[1:03:33] not anything about God get to him he
[1:03:36] doesn't play
[1:03:37] it doesn't play around it's to zero
[1:03:40] inner measure is called
[1:03:42] that is what God did in this age
[1:03:45] God when God look Beyond this in the
[1:03:48] scream on time
[1:03:50] in this last age there will be gross
[1:03:53] Darkness
[1:03:54] therefore God did not choose job
[1:03:58] God did not choose Abraham to be here
[1:04:01] God did not choose Moses the great Moses
[1:04:05] because Moses could not cannot stand
[1:04:08] here
[1:04:09] therefore God
[1:04:11] has to look Beyond saying you know what
[1:04:13] I have to call myself
[1:04:17] therefore God look his son in this gross
[1:04:20] Darkness there is no human being can
[1:04:23] survive this
[1:04:25] there is no human being that can live in
[1:04:28] the edge of Southern mind
[1:04:31] in this age there is no human being
[1:04:33] where School are corrupt the devil take
[1:04:37] up the school the devil take up the
[1:04:39] church the devil take over the politics
[1:04:42] the devil take over every horse
[1:04:45] therefore human being cannot devil said
[1:04:49] God looked down said I will come down
[1:04:51] myself
[1:04:55] not only coming down he said the people
[1:04:57] I am going to need
[1:04:59] in this age is the people who are the
[1:05:03] worst of the worst
[1:05:07] people who they don't even know their
[1:05:11] life from the left that is why Grace is
[1:05:14] very important
[1:05:16] God looked down and saying you know what
[1:05:18] I am going to choose those who are drug
[1:05:22] addict
[1:05:23] I'm going to call those who are who can
[1:05:26] help themselves who have been written up
[1:05:29] by Society I'm going to choose people
[1:05:32] who cannot defend themselves they know
[1:05:34] they are failures
[1:05:36] and God said I will come down and when I
[1:05:39] come I will take over them to be able to
[1:05:42] survive in this age
[1:05:48] I don't
[1:05:50] that's what God was thinking
[1:05:52] God taught
[1:05:53] that the people that I'm going to bring
[1:05:55] here and people who when the word of God
[1:05:58] comes to them they will be able to tell
[1:06:00] the word of God and send I I take the
[1:06:03] word of God I believe it I stand by it I
[1:06:07] can't move away from it because it is
[1:06:09] not you for you to believe God it has to
[1:06:12] be God that believes God
[1:06:19] for you to believe God in this age for
[1:06:23] you to believe the prophet if God has to
[1:06:25] put something inside of you you have to
[1:06:28] have an a receiver that when the word of
[1:06:31] God comes to you there's something in
[1:06:33] you that magnetize the word of God
[1:06:38] that
[1:06:39] is that was the plan of God
[1:06:42] that is the movie God was acting out
[1:06:45] and God's saying okay
[1:06:47] I finished that I see the people
[1:06:50] but how am I of this thing to happen
[1:06:54] there are attributes and a lot in me
[1:06:57] I want to be a savior
[1:07:00] I want to be a Healer
[1:07:03] I want to be all this attribute how am I
[1:07:05] going to do it
[1:07:07] oh thought of Lucifer
[1:07:10] he said I would need Lucifer
[1:07:14] to be in this picture
[1:07:17] I will need the Lucifer to be in this
[1:07:19] drama because he has a part to play
[1:07:23] listen my brothers and sister
[1:07:25] you might have Santa on your life you
[1:07:29] ask yourself a question
[1:07:31] why it is going wrong in my life
[1:07:35] why did I go through all this
[1:07:38] God has a purpose
[1:07:42] therefore when God look at Lucifer he
[1:07:45] said yes I'm going to choose Lucifer but
[1:07:48] in that Lucifer
[1:07:49] he was created perfect
[1:07:53] but there was something that God put him
[1:07:57] called the free moral agency
[1:08:00] ability to choose right or wrong and God
[1:08:04] knew that Lucifer would choose the wrong
[1:08:06] thing
[1:08:08] and when it and God said praise God
[1:08:11] that's what I wanted
[1:08:14] and gone along Lucifer to come into the
[1:08:17] future and when he came into the picture
[1:08:20] Lucifer
[1:08:22] was
[1:08:24] the prophet said he come to the stage
[1:08:26] now after God moved from the eternal
[1:08:28] spirit into the logos from that point in
[1:08:31] time move it downward they were co-equal
[1:08:34] he was co-equal with Christ
[1:08:37] he was co-equal the only thing that he
[1:08:40] could not do is to give life
[1:08:43] therefore God give him access God give
[1:08:46] me the ability to do anything but
[1:08:49] he can't give life
[1:08:52] therefore when the Lucifer come to that
[1:08:54] stage of being called equal with God
[1:08:56] Pride certain
[1:09:00] that's what God saw God knew that
[1:09:03] God knew that Lucifer would do that and
[1:09:06] when he when Pride came in oh he became
[1:09:09] very important
[1:09:12] in the Church of God
[1:09:13] he become the choir Master he becomes
[1:09:16] the person who is he the position of
[1:09:19] authority
[1:09:21] now he begin to have influence when he
[1:09:23] talks some angelic
[1:09:27] they listen to him what the prophet said
[1:09:30] when he sees himself in that position
[1:09:33] the only thing he does he begins to go
[1:09:36] from one once Angel to another
[1:09:40] they're going to convince them
[1:09:42] probably they he had that God said
[1:09:48] let us make man in our own image
[1:09:51] and when he heard that say listen
[1:09:53] my friends my core angels I just heard
[1:09:57] the news
[1:09:58] that there's some God is one to create
[1:10:00] somebody in his own image therefore when
[1:10:03] that man come into preacher we will be
[1:10:06] relegated to nothing
[1:10:08] then he began to move from one one Angel
[1:10:12] to another
[1:10:13] to convince them
[1:10:15] said this God who who did he think he is
[1:10:19] let us read back let us I want to take
[1:10:23] the position and he convinced some of
[1:10:26] the Angels
[1:10:28] and some of them fall for his day
[1:10:31] if they fight for all the nonsense he
[1:10:34] was he was bringing out and the prophet
[1:10:37] said
[1:10:38] you see whatever you you went up there
[1:10:42] that is why you are manifesting here
[1:10:44] therefore if you were one of those to
[1:10:48] turn up the angel represented it doesn't
[1:10:50] matter no matter how much the pastor
[1:10:53] preach no matter the the super
[1:10:56] Supernatural experiencing you my hand no
[1:10:59] matter if the if the Fire come on the
[1:11:01] pulpit you will only be unbelievable
[1:11:06] you will never believe God because what
[1:11:09] you wear in the beginning that's what
[1:11:11] you are manifesting
[1:11:12] but let's bring it to another if you
[1:11:15] were a believer
[1:11:17] when the Devil Comes Lucifer come to you
[1:11:20] and start telling you I said no no no
[1:11:21] Satan no no I don't listen to that that
[1:11:24] garbage
[1:11:25] no no no God Is God When you you resist
[1:11:29] Satan's lie there
[1:11:32] I'm telling you when you come here in
[1:11:35] the manifestation of the of your or of
[1:11:38] your eye God the attribute God put in
[1:11:40] you let me tell you when the word of God
[1:11:42] comes to you you will believe the word
[1:11:44] of God you don't need to convince the
[1:11:46] pastor your pastor don't need to
[1:11:48] convince you you don't need to go to
[1:11:50] your brother and your sister because
[1:11:52] your the word of God he may manifest to
[1:11:55] you and you see it
[1:11:57] does it
[1:12:01] when whether somebody tell you the
[1:12:04] prophet made a mistake
[1:12:06] you know that's there are a lot of
[1:12:08] people today who goes out looking for
[1:12:11] the message to show us that the prophet
[1:12:14] made a mistake
[1:12:16] listen
[1:12:19] have you not the Bible where God told
[1:12:22] Abram my children with Sir John in the
[1:12:25] 49 for 400 years
[1:12:32] then you want to take that out from the
[1:12:34] Bible
[1:12:35] no the prophet whatever God allowed the
[1:12:39] prophets to speak
[1:12:41] the prophet said God does this away
[1:12:44] something sometimes to to put some
[1:12:47] people out
[1:12:49] and he speaking such a way to bring
[1:12:51] people in if you speak to life some
[1:12:53] people Ponder and that is the way God
[1:12:56] does this ever though when the word of
[1:12:59] God comes whether Abraham he made a
[1:13:01] mistake here he made a mistake there God
[1:13:04] did not give me the ministry to start
[1:13:06] dissecting
[1:13:08] whether we are the prophet made a
[1:13:10] mistake
[1:13:12] you know
[1:13:15] that's a minister he was a good friend
[1:13:18] of mine
[1:13:19] we separated because of this
[1:13:22] anytime go to his house he want to show
[1:13:25] me where blah blah made a mistake
[1:13:28] one day
[1:13:30] I wanted I wanted to be gentle I wanted
[1:13:32] to be a gentleman I just well I said
[1:13:35] maybe he would grow out of it
[1:13:37] but the more I go
[1:13:40] the man is trying to show me
[1:13:42] you know the prophet said uh
[1:13:45] Fellowship is two fellow in one ship
[1:13:48] therefore
[1:13:50] I I think we were in a different
[1:13:52] different shape then I designed one day
[1:13:56] I told him I said brother I have a
[1:13:58] question for you I said have you ever
[1:14:01] had a dream
[1:14:02] and that dream comes to pass 100 percent
[1:14:06] well
[1:14:08] I don't really think
[1:14:10] it was struggling
[1:14:13] I said okay
[1:14:15] I said the reason why I asked you a
[1:14:17] question
[1:14:19] do you know what a prophet is
[1:14:24] that a prophet
[1:14:26] can stand on the pulpit
[1:14:29] in the Garden of Eden
[1:14:34] and that's how he preached the serpent
[1:14:37] seed
[1:14:40] a prophet
[1:14:42] is a prophet it's a man who stand on the
[1:14:46] on the pulpit
[1:14:48] and sees your house address
[1:14:51] that you just moved three two days ago
[1:14:55] and somebody else will tell oh it's a
[1:14:57] false prophet
[1:15:00] a prophet is somebody who will be
[1:15:02] standing on the pulpit and sick doctor
[1:15:04] with operating knife
[1:15:07] on you
[1:15:09] that what a prophet is therefore if you
[1:15:12] if you've never seen a dream and your
[1:15:15] dream has never come to pass who are you
[1:15:18] to correct the prophet
[1:15:21] who are you to come up and say you know
[1:15:24] what you want to cover the prophet
[1:15:25] therefore you don't know what a prophet
[1:15:27] is a prophet is God in human flesh
[1:15:32] God in human flesh whether you
[1:15:35] understand it or not don't touch it
[1:15:38] leave it
[1:15:40] you know I receive the message Amen
[1:15:43] brother I receive this message in Europe
[1:15:47] and
[1:15:48] the father we can receive the message I
[1:15:51] will read it the same with your changes
[1:15:53] I was rejoicing both night and day
[1:15:57] one day
[1:15:58] as our reading I hit
[1:16:01] when the prophet said
[1:16:04] that the world is going to end in 1977.
[1:16:10] you know when I come there I did not
[1:16:12] stagger because everything that I've
[1:16:15] been reading I did not hit anybody
[1:16:19] and this I said this is not a bone maybe
[1:16:23] I did not understand it you know what I
[1:16:25] did I put it on the Shelf
[1:16:30] I said I'm going to live that but that
[1:16:33] will not make me
[1:16:35] to stop
[1:16:37] I want to let the enemy take my mind say
[1:16:40] oh oh this is a proper I said no no no
[1:16:42] no no
[1:16:43] every time I read
[1:16:45] is
[1:16:46] only in the rock
[1:16:48] every time I read I see myself anytime I
[1:16:52] read I said this man is like he was
[1:16:55] there when God was doing everything
[1:16:58] it is now we begin to understand that a
[1:17:00] prophet can stand here and not even that
[1:17:03] this prophet
[1:17:05] there is no Prophet like him this
[1:17:08] Prophet did not go to Genesis 1. he went
[1:17:10] straight to the back of God's mind
[1:17:12] and bring out what God was thinking
[1:17:15] then you want to come to me you want to
[1:17:18] come to me and tell me William made a
[1:17:20] mistake it's too late for you
[1:17:24] it's too late to tell me there is an
[1:17:27] error in this message yeah if there's an
[1:17:29] error God left it for the unbeliever not
[1:17:32] for the believer
[1:17:34] therefore when you come to that stage
[1:17:36] you see something and the devil tried to
[1:17:39] magnify it
[1:17:41] probably
[1:17:44] you are a part of those two third angels
[1:17:47] who listen to Satan's life
[1:17:50] but if you did not listen to Satan's
[1:17:52] life
[1:17:53] you represent that one third
[1:17:56] who came who said no we don't listen to
[1:17:59] you
[1:18:00] no no no no Our Father tell us we we
[1:18:03] stay with what her father said
[1:18:05] and you went there
[1:18:08] is that
[1:18:10] in adoption message
[1:18:12] a word a word is a taught Express
[1:18:16] God taught how he could be God
[1:18:19] you see let's look now this is a prophet
[1:18:21] who went straight to God's what God was
[1:18:23] thinking
[1:18:25] Nana he's bring it now that is why if
[1:18:28] you believe in Prophet you are blessed
[1:18:31] because God sent us a prophet and Lord
[1:18:33] Prophet to take you to the mind of God
[1:18:36] now we are taking a trip now part
[1:18:39] Genesis 1 we are going straight to the
[1:18:42] mind of God where what God was thinking
[1:18:45] where God was being conceiving his
[1:18:48] thoughts
[1:18:49] and now he said he said God taught how
[1:18:53] he could be God
[1:18:54] how he could be worshiped how he could
[1:18:57] be a Healer how he could be a savior and
[1:19:00] as as he speak the one it was finished
[1:19:04] forever
[1:19:06] therefore if God taught a Brother Joseph
[1:19:09] being a believer
[1:19:11] in his mind
[1:19:14] in eternity
[1:19:16] he said
[1:19:17] Joseph will be a believer
[1:19:21] and he spoke it
[1:19:23] and
[1:19:24] from the logos
[1:19:26] all the way
[1:19:29] all the way we thrown my children we
[1:19:32] were Israel all of a sudden Christ now
[1:19:35] become materialized that Lord God was in
[1:19:38] flesh and he was as he was in flesh and
[1:19:41] Joseph was in there
[1:19:44] and said oh we want to crucify him and
[1:19:48] the devil all of them were running
[1:19:49] around and they know him and Calvary and
[1:19:52] the piercing and when they piercing the
[1:19:54] water and blood came out and the devil
[1:19:57] said I got him but the devil didn't know
[1:19:59] that they were making a great mistake
[1:20:02] and when he did that the Bride of Jesus
[1:20:05] Christ came out Hallelujah
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:12] and we came out
[1:20:14] now
[1:20:16] for two thousand years God has been
[1:20:19] building up right and here is Brother
[1:20:21] Joseph
[1:20:23] born in the jungle of Africa
[1:20:26] I did not receive the message there for
[1:20:29] some reason I told my dad I'm going to
[1:20:31] travel to Europe
[1:20:34] but I didn't know that my decision
[1:20:39] that decision you might be thinking
[1:20:41] brother there are decisions you made
[1:20:43] that you may not understand but that
[1:20:45] decision you are making is the God
[1:20:47] moving you to a good direction
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:20:53] I moved to Europe
[1:20:55] went through trials and difficulties and
[1:20:58] one day oh
[1:21:01] I was preaching the church
[1:21:03] one brother came and sit in the front
[1:21:05] row
[1:21:08] foreign see how God this brother was in
[1:21:13] Europe in Germany he flew to Greece and
[1:21:17] when he Fleet of Greece he was going
[1:21:19] from churches to churches and he
[1:21:21] happened to come to my church
[1:21:23] and he sat down on the front door like
[1:21:25] just that this brother sit down there
[1:21:26] and he listened to me we finished
[1:21:28] preaching
[1:21:30] because I was born and raised up
[1:21:33] Pentecostal
[1:21:35] and I was there and jumped upon them
[1:21:37] thinking I know about God this God and
[1:21:40] this brother allowed me to finish
[1:21:44] God bless you brother that was a good
[1:21:46] message
[1:21:48] that was a good message brother he said
[1:21:50] please can I follow you home I have
[1:21:52] something to share with you
[1:21:56] you see how God lead
[1:21:59] God saw me
[1:22:02] before the foundation of the war
[1:22:04] that I was going to receive the message
[1:22:07] he sent somebody
[1:22:08] because some I am a kind of person that
[1:22:12] is difficult for me to trust my fellow
[1:22:14] human being
[1:22:16] but this brother came as I just said
[1:22:18] okay let's go and put them inside the
[1:22:20] car
[1:22:21] and drop him home
[1:22:23] and we sit down my wife gave him food
[1:22:25] and everything I said brother I have
[1:22:28] some question to ask
[1:22:30] so when you were preaching it was nice
[1:22:32] but I have the question for me
[1:22:34] I would have said who are you to ask me
[1:22:36] I'm a pastor you just don't have any
[1:22:38] rights to ask me a question
[1:22:40] I said one question
[1:22:43] said brother
[1:22:45] in Genesis chapter 3 verse 15.
[1:22:48] what happened there
[1:22:50] wow
[1:22:53] I look at I said Genesis 3 15.
[1:22:57] and few weeks prior to that
[1:23:00] that is the subject caution in the bible
[1:23:03] school where I was going
[1:23:07] and how they Round Table nobody could
[1:23:10] answer that
[1:23:12] they told me that it was not revealed
[1:23:15] nobody should be quiet where God is
[1:23:18] quiet
[1:23:19] and this brother now came he came to me
[1:23:21] said brother Genesis 3 15. can you can
[1:23:25] you elaborate on me I said well like
[1:23:26] nothing I can say anything I don't know
[1:23:29] anything but I said the Bible they said
[1:23:31] we should keep it it's not ready the
[1:23:33] brother take out they said okay
[1:23:36] he said
[1:23:39] is God three or one
[1:23:43] well I try to defend what I believe by
[1:23:46] telling yes I'm trying to give a number
[1:23:48] on G if all kind of supreme ideas the
[1:23:52] guy the brother was just quiet
[1:23:55] he took me to a series of scriptures
[1:23:59] and nothing
[1:24:01] after that I said brother
[1:24:03] that is wonderful
[1:24:05] the brother did not come to me as if he
[1:24:07] know that he highly evaluated no he came
[1:24:11] to me simple because that is the only
[1:24:13] way I could have seen it
[1:24:15] because God designed me he's not the
[1:24:18] kind of person I am you can come to me
[1:24:20] with Flappy no this brown was so humble
[1:24:22] now he said he told me said Brian wait
[1:24:24] can I take five minutes to explain
[1:24:26] something to you I said brother take 10
[1:24:28] minutes
[1:24:29] brother when this brother started from
[1:24:31] Genesis 3 15 at the time he end up in
[1:24:34] Book of Revelation something struck my
[1:24:36] soul
[1:24:40] I told you I said wait I said brother
[1:24:42] which Bible school did you guide this
[1:24:45] he said you can't find this in the bible
[1:24:46] school there is nothing you can find in
[1:24:49] the Bible school I said please where did
[1:24:52] you get this from
[1:24:53] something my heart was burning my hand
[1:24:56] went to know more then all of a sudden
[1:24:58] he bring out several churches and gave
[1:25:01] it to me and when he gave me the subway
[1:25:04] for seven good days
[1:25:07] I was on fire
[1:25:11] I took the cell that inspiration
[1:25:14] thinking the church I was they will see
[1:25:16] it
[1:25:19] or for me it was like I was seeing
[1:25:22] things I want everybody to see it
[1:25:31] this could be a false prophet I said
[1:25:33] this is not a false prophet this is
[1:25:36] truth
[1:25:39] brother
[1:25:41] since that time till now
[1:25:44] for 26 years
[1:25:48] I am a reviver
[1:25:52] Revival is not jumping from poopy to
[1:25:54] poopy no Revival is gone unveiling
[1:25:57] himself God is showing you God is
[1:26:01] revealing inside God is showing you your
[1:26:03] portion of the word of God that has come
[1:26:05] to you and when you see that
[1:26:08] you can both sing Amazing Grace
[1:26:13] that is amazing grace
[1:26:15] coming to you Grace is not it's not
[1:26:19] something you explain to somebody Grace
[1:26:22] is a person and when that Grace visits
[1:26:24] you when that Grace when God guarded
[1:26:27] meets you brothers and sisters I'm
[1:26:29] telling you
[1:26:33] it is not just it's not just west
[1:26:36] anymore
[1:26:38] you experience it
[1:26:40] you are living out Grace
[1:26:47] he said
[1:26:51] my gospel the word is finished
[1:26:54] therefore God spoke thought of me he
[1:26:57] spoke me in
[1:27:00] in my life I went ups and down
[1:27:03] though don't change God's what God
[1:27:05] thought of me never
[1:27:12] the reason why
[1:27:13] I speak like this is the prophet said if
[1:27:17] you don't know who you are
[1:27:20] the devil will take you and take you
[1:27:22] like this like handkerchief and bring
[1:27:24] you out shift up and down but if you
[1:27:27] know who you are
[1:27:31] when you know who you are
[1:27:35] when you know who you are
[1:27:38] the Bible says
[1:27:40] the guest of her
[1:27:43] there we come
[1:27:45] I guess the Revelation the acceleration
[1:27:47] who
[1:27:48] not only Jesus Jesus
[1:27:50] Christ is male and female
[1:27:53] it's good you know it by William Brown
[1:27:55] is a prophet that is good
[1:27:58] it's good to know that your pastor is
[1:28:01] you know is in the bride it's good to
[1:28:03] know that your fellow pronouns is in the
[1:28:06] body
[1:28:07] but that is not a voodoo the devil
[1:28:09] doesn't find that
[1:28:11] what the devil find is when you make it
[1:28:13] personal
[1:28:14] when you take it from the scripture you
[1:28:17] take it from the message you say I'm the
[1:28:19] one the prophet say all her hate that
[1:28:26] why
[1:28:27] because the day you know who you are you
[1:28:30] become an invisible Army
[1:28:34] when I when I when I read that the first
[1:28:37] time I said let me go and look what
[1:28:39] Invincible me
[1:28:41] you know what it means you are
[1:28:43] unconquered
[1:28:45] you are unbeatable
[1:28:47] when you when you when you know who you
[1:28:50] are
[1:28:51] the devil will come from right left
[1:28:54] and you will be standing no matter the
[1:28:57] trial you go through you are too
[1:28:59] flat-footed
[1:29:01] because
[1:29:02] you see yourself
[1:29:05] in that picture because that picture
[1:29:08] is the bride and the bridegroom when you
[1:29:11] see Jesus
[1:29:12] don't stop there
[1:29:15] begin to eat
[1:29:17] begin to feel the mess he eat all of a
[1:29:20] sudden you see inside our picture one
[1:29:23] hand another hand comes out don't stop
[1:29:25] there
[1:29:26] begin to feed all of a sudden you see
[1:29:29] another hand comes up don't stop all of
[1:29:32] a sudden you see the head comes out and
[1:29:35] it's a female and that female is not
[1:29:38] brother brother a brother B it's not
[1:29:41] William Abraham it's not brother it's
[1:29:44] not Brother Joseph it's you
[1:29:46] in that picture
[1:29:50] it's you in that picture
[1:29:52] see that
[1:29:54] oh brother
[1:29:58] you can go as long as slow you can be
[1:30:01] but anytime the word of God comes to you
[1:30:03] you will always say Amen
[1:30:06] you will never argue the word of God you
[1:30:08] will never no matter the situation
[1:30:10] because you are the one may flesh
[1:30:13] how can you deny yourself
[1:30:17] how can you deny that you're a human
[1:30:19] being
[1:30:20] how can you deny
[1:30:22] when this this message is repeated to
[1:30:25] you I'm not talking about somebody
[1:30:27] handing it or trying to explain this man
[1:30:30] say no When God comes to you this is the
[1:30:33] age of redemption claim
[1:30:36] God is claiming his children
[1:30:39] in obvious lives
[1:30:41] and why because he know where he plant
[1:30:44] his seed
[1:30:46] God
[1:30:48] just like a farmer my brother told me
[1:30:50] yesterday it was a farm
[1:30:53] you plant anything
[1:30:55] you have to prepare the Quran
[1:30:58] therefore we were prepared
[1:31:00] I was prepared you were prepared your
[1:31:04] soil will prepare before the foundation
[1:31:06] of the world therefore when the word of
[1:31:08] God when God begin to solve the Earth in
[1:31:11] this age
[1:31:12] your soul was it was recertive
[1:31:16] not just recentive
[1:31:19] you know there are places you plant some
[1:31:21] kind of things
[1:31:22] they will not grow very fast
[1:31:27] they will grow out and they become
[1:31:29] yellow
[1:31:31] but there are some they ground you
[1:31:33] playing the middle you plant me on the
[1:31:34] Sun what they just need is water
[1:31:37] and as you put the water under they are
[1:31:39] drinkers they are drinking the water
[1:31:42] they shoot out
[1:31:44] they drink
[1:31:45] they come out they drink that is what we
[1:31:48] are doing when the word of God comes to
[1:31:50] you because God predestinated you to
[1:31:54] this hour when the message of the hour
[1:31:56] comes to you and he that see that was
[1:31:59] there brother a Son of God is born and
[1:32:02] when that Son of God is born you are
[1:32:04] still baby don't worry
[1:32:06] when are you far just like my
[1:32:08] granddaughter my granddaughter can't
[1:32:10] work
[1:32:11] devil why should I force her to walk
[1:32:13] what she needs or what you need is given
[1:32:17] meek
[1:32:18] and she grow up make make after some
[1:32:22] time he told the mom I don't need milk
[1:32:24] anymore
[1:32:25] give me hard meat give me hard food why
[1:32:28] because his design now he's getting
[1:32:30] strength he's drinking he's growing all
[1:32:33] he's born everything that is what is
[1:32:35] happening in the spiritual realm when
[1:32:37] you receive them and say whether you
[1:32:39] fall or not don't worry continue to eat
[1:32:42] don't let the enemy tell you oh you have
[1:32:45] been a message for years
[1:32:47] you're far you do this you do that let
[1:32:50] me tell you Satan
[1:32:52] you were not there when God thought of
[1:32:55] me
[1:32:58] when you told them they said you said oh
[1:33:01] this guy know what is you know what he's
[1:33:03] talking about because me and you
[1:33:07] who were in the mind of God who were the
[1:33:11] attribute of God and become the logos
[1:33:14] I and me and you were the one who spoke
[1:33:18] Lucifer into existence
[1:33:21] therefore
[1:33:23] devil who who
[1:33:25] is the devil to tell me who I am
[1:33:28] no the devil can't give you identity
[1:33:32] the devil can't give me identity
[1:33:34] our identity has been displayed on the
[1:33:37] on the sky in 1963 the mighty angel came
[1:33:41] down and when the mighty angel came down
[1:33:43] he said that is you here that is me here
[1:33:47] therefore if you were not in the mind of
[1:33:49] God you will laugh at that
[1:33:53] if you were not in the mind of God
[1:33:55] you will make fun of the pillar of Fire
[1:34:00] if you were not in the mind of God you
[1:34:02] would think that we are crazy
[1:34:05] if we are not in the mind of God you
[1:34:08] will come up with this serious Minister
[1:34:10] that have been dismissed for 40 years
[1:34:13] all of a sudden they turn against God
[1:34:15] what they they went and swallowed what
[1:34:18] they have vomited
[1:34:19] could imagine that
[1:34:24] you know
[1:34:26] we still don't we don't let us count
[1:34:29] them out
[1:34:32] listen
[1:34:33] because it is not the will of God for
[1:34:37] any man to perish
[1:34:39] when that disrupt me I change the way I
[1:34:42] think about those people you know why
[1:34:46] God cannot judge you
[1:34:48] if he has never revealed anything to you
[1:34:53] there are people who receive this
[1:34:55] message in her knowledge
[1:34:58] they're being a message for years but
[1:35:01] they haven't have a single revelation of
[1:35:04] this message therefore that put them in
[1:35:06] a different category because God is not
[1:35:09] going to judge what did he refer to you
[1:35:11] therefore when it's revealed to you
[1:35:13] brother Revelation is where God in
[1:35:16] parties said to you when God is revealed
[1:35:19] to you brother you own this
[1:35:23] God is going to hold you to that
[1:35:27] therefore if God did not reveal it to
[1:35:29] you
[1:35:30] you might be in the message
[1:35:33] you may be coming to a child because
[1:35:34] your dad is coming
[1:35:36] you might be coming to the church
[1:35:37] because your husband is a pastor you
[1:35:39] might be coming to the child because
[1:35:40] your father is a dick
[1:35:43] but
[1:35:46] until God
[1:35:48] show you who you are
[1:35:51] in the Plan of Redemption
[1:35:54] if God if God in the beginning did not
[1:35:57] choose you to be the pride of Jesus
[1:35:59] Christ
[1:36:00] you can't make it therefore you can come
[1:36:03] and lie down here
[1:36:05] for 24 7.
[1:36:07] you can stop yourself to death
[1:36:09] thinking that you are going you're going
[1:36:11] to pray yourself into it it's not going
[1:36:13] to happen therefore what God in the plan
[1:36:16] of God there are people who are the
[1:36:20] bride
[1:36:21] there are people who are the foolish
[1:36:23] virgin there are people who are
[1:36:25] wondering 144 000 there are people who
[1:36:28] has never anybody gospel
[1:36:31] that God is going to give eternal life
[1:36:33] talk
[1:36:34] devil that is where we the bride very
[1:36:37] important because if Christ come to you
[1:36:40] you have to see the way Christ see
[1:36:43] because it is not the will of God for
[1:36:46] enema it doesn't matter what that person
[1:36:49] have done unto godson I'm finished with
[1:36:52] that person that's it brother
[1:36:54] but
[1:36:56] if God didn't say that
[1:36:58] who are you
[1:37:01] I
[1:37:06] let me change another thing
[1:37:08] when God came to
[1:37:10] he said let us make mine in our own
[1:37:12] image
[1:37:13] in the god in the Garden of Eden
[1:37:17] Adam and Eve they were living
[1:37:21] nothing they were living a paradise
[1:37:23] everything was okay there was nothing
[1:37:26] wrong there was no sickness
[1:37:29] then Adam and he would go and throw
[1:37:32] another
[1:37:34] you know honey see that tree there
[1:37:38] can we move it from there to there is
[1:37:40] that tree he speak him unto that corner
[1:37:45] when the Praises blowing maybe they are
[1:37:48] walking and
[1:37:50] the prince is blowing
[1:37:53] Eve had to cover his faith say honey
[1:37:55] this bridge
[1:37:58] is too much say okay wait so please be
[1:38:01] still is put was spoke
[1:38:04] and everything will be peaceful
[1:38:07] but God was looking
[1:38:11] was looking
[1:38:13] there was an attribute in God
[1:38:15] God said this cannot go on like that
[1:38:20] he said
[1:38:21] the attribute in God as a savior was
[1:38:24] calling out
[1:38:26] the attribute as a savior came to the
[1:38:29] Eden and he projected
[1:38:31] he was moving
[1:38:33] he was moving all of a sudden
[1:38:36] the attribute called for a sinner
[1:38:40] and sin came into the Garden of Eden my
[1:38:44] question is if the attribute of God
[1:38:47] projected to Eve to fall who are you
[1:38:51] to stop that
[1:38:56] there is no way you can stop it
[1:38:58] because sometimes we try to cast get if
[1:39:02] or if they did if they die everything he
[1:39:05] did was in the plan of God
[1:39:09] everything because for God to be a
[1:39:12] savior sin had to come into the picture
[1:39:15] therefore the attribute of a savior was
[1:39:18] projecting was calling as he was calling
[1:39:23] the devil came into the into the into
[1:39:25] the palace
[1:39:26] he's walking around
[1:39:28] he was walking around all of a sudden
[1:39:31] I believe I could be wrong I believe
[1:39:34] that serpent was there in the Garden of
[1:39:36] Eden maybe for days months
[1:39:40] watching Eve
[1:39:42] starting Eve
[1:39:44] looking at Eve to see when the husband
[1:39:47] will be awake
[1:39:49] and all of a sudden he found the husband
[1:39:51] was maybe he gonna take a nap
[1:39:54] oh whatever
[1:39:56] and that attribute of a savior
[1:39:59] was calling
[1:40:01] and that attribute now was bringing
[1:40:03] Serpent and he closer
[1:40:06] closer closer closer and all of a sudden
[1:40:10] the attribution yes this is the time and
[1:40:14] serve the serpent
[1:40:16] proposed a word
[1:40:19] and Eve who came straight from the hand
[1:40:22] of God
[1:40:23] why did they accept
[1:40:27] he has said because the attribute was
[1:40:29] calling and before the foundation of the
[1:40:31] world he was projected that that is
[1:40:33] what's going to happen
[1:40:35] because when God thought of anything and
[1:40:37] when he speak it you can't stop it
[1:40:40] and all of a sudden Eve
[1:40:43] saw him and saw her said
[1:40:46] and when you find that another came and
[1:40:49] find out that he she did what don't
[1:40:52] supposed to do
[1:40:54] and I was not surprised
[1:40:57] Adam sorry well let me look
[1:41:00] Adam look when one seal open to Adam
[1:41:06] when the sin open to other
[1:41:08] I don't say you know what I am a son of
[1:41:10] God
[1:41:12] I know what to do to save my wife
[1:41:16] it doesn't matter if I go away with the
[1:41:19] word of God my father will not leave me
[1:41:21] where I am
[1:41:22] he went he put the same seed and put him
[1:41:26] to eat and when God kept them full of
[1:41:29] the evening
[1:41:30] the hand of God was high because
[1:41:34] with him his offspring his lock up in
[1:41:37] the womb of of Eve God could not destroy
[1:41:41] him if he destroyed her he would destroy
[1:41:43] himself
[1:41:50] I see the love of God that for God so
[1:41:53] loved the world
[1:41:58] away from the word of God God will send
[1:42:00] me a savior
[1:42:04] and that's what God Adam did
[1:42:07] Adam
[1:42:09] you see
[1:42:10] to save his wife
[1:42:13] before the foundation of the world
[1:42:15] God
[1:42:17] look at me and you
[1:42:19] you know where we came from you know the
[1:42:20] family some of us were born out of
[1:42:23] wedlock some of us was born in a broken
[1:42:26] heart some God said you know what I
[1:42:29] thought of these people the only way for
[1:42:31] me to say that is to put my seat there
[1:42:35] God before the foundation of the world
[1:42:38] he put the seed of representation
[1:42:40] instead of you than when the word of God
[1:42:43] come in this age you cannot but receive
[1:42:45] it
[1:42:46] because you are saved by the seed of God
[1:42:49] you are saved by God coming to you and
[1:42:52] live inside of you
[1:42:59] listen
[1:43:02] question and answer
[1:43:04] the prophet said the first creation was
[1:43:07] God himself couldn't imagine that
[1:43:10] God came back to himself
[1:43:13] and that is so surprising because God
[1:43:16] gave back to goat
[1:43:18] Pig
[1:43:19] we get back to a peak
[1:43:21] I have never seen where Pig get better
[1:43:24] to talk it's not possible therefore God
[1:43:26] when God is giving birth God is going to
[1:43:30] give birth to himself
[1:43:31] therefore when God comes to you
[1:43:34] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is
[1:43:37] reciting inside of you it's not human
[1:43:39] element that is God's DNA
[1:43:43] that is God's dear in you therefore you
[1:43:47] are God in human flesh you are God
[1:43:50] standing you are God working you are God
[1:43:52] driving you are God God is living in you
[1:43:56] because that is what he have in the bad
[1:43:59] part of his mind
[1:44:01] is that the first question what's God
[1:44:03] himself
[1:44:04] out of God came the logos which was the
[1:44:07] son of God then out of the logos which
[1:44:10] was the one in the big one and the world
[1:44:13] was with God and the world was God and
[1:44:15] the was made flesh and dwelled Among Us
[1:44:19] you know that scripture
[1:44:21] we used to refer that scripture to Jesus
[1:44:24] Christ alone but let me tell you that is
[1:44:28] me and you in the beginning what's the
[1:44:30] word the word was with God the word has
[1:44:33] become flesh
[1:44:36] that is the word of God don't limit that
[1:44:39] to Jesus Christ Alone
[1:44:40] don't leave me that no it is you
[1:44:45] listen
[1:44:47] the prophet son in a message
[1:44:50] excuse me let me
[1:44:54] is that
[1:44:57] in a message we'll see Jesus I said a
[1:44:59] really true born again Christian is the
[1:45:03] word expressed
[1:45:07] a real true don't again Christian is
[1:45:11] word express again because you are
[1:45:15] written a piece of God right of me
[1:45:18] listen there are people who cannot read
[1:45:21] the Bible anymore
[1:45:23] let me tell you
[1:45:25] the the progression of the word of God
[1:45:27] is this
[1:45:29] the word internal
[1:45:32] move into the logos
[1:45:35] and when they move from the logos
[1:45:38] it comes down it does not stop
[1:45:41] here
[1:45:43] this Bible
[1:45:45] has to be flesh
[1:45:47] it has to be flesh out therefore they
[1:45:50] thought of God moved from the written
[1:45:53] word
[1:45:53] into the manifested word of God and the
[1:45:57] manifested word of God is you it's me
[1:46:00] that's what God has in the mind
[1:46:02] and when God saw that in this age he
[1:46:05] came down he said this is my victory
[1:46:09] God becoming flesh
[1:46:11] you know some people they don't know you
[1:46:13] got to the same job they don't know who
[1:46:15] you are some of them mock at you some
[1:46:18] some of them talk bad of you but they
[1:46:20] don't really have idea
[1:46:23] they don't who they don't know who you
[1:46:25] are
[1:46:27] we are the written a piece of
[1:46:30] blood of all men say what what type of
[1:46:32] person should we be
[1:46:34] if we know our Our Lives is open Living
[1:46:38] Bible
[1:46:40] my life
[1:46:42] you see you might say fat in me you
[1:46:44] might say fault in your brother
[1:46:46] but let me tell you see the way God see
[1:46:48] forth is different from our old spot
[1:46:51] when God put Abraham he taught Abraham
[1:46:54] he said you stay here
[1:46:57] don't move from here
[1:47:00] and God the same God
[1:47:02] the same God
[1:47:04] allow femi to happen
[1:47:07] because the reason why they love you to
[1:47:09] go to ages because of family God would
[1:47:12] not be able to supply their needs God
[1:47:14] will be able to provide for them all
[1:47:16] they need God told them stay right there
[1:47:21] and they travel going to
[1:47:24] to Egypt where they were going
[1:47:28] Abraham told his wife he said listen you
[1:47:31] know that guy in that guy that's in a
[1:47:33] newspaper that guy is looking for he's
[1:47:35] looking for a new wife to God money
[1:47:39] and looking at you you are just like 25
[1:47:41] or 26. and this man because you are the
[1:47:45] most beautiful woman on the end this man
[1:47:47] don't mind because they don't fear God
[1:47:49] they will kill me and take you
[1:47:53] you said about what we're going to do
[1:47:55] let us lie he said tell them that you
[1:47:57] are my sister
[1:48:00] I'm not a leader the wife caught the
[1:48:03] revelation
[1:48:06] you know there are some people when the
[1:48:08] husband tell them something they want to
[1:48:09] feel that they are more revelated than
[1:48:11] their husband they say oh no no no no no
[1:48:12] no no no no no when you when you tell
[1:48:14] them this they want to use another quote
[1:48:16] to characterize it
[1:48:20] but this one this woman caught in
[1:48:22] Revelation he said okay my dear
[1:48:25] they're gone
[1:48:27] they ask them who's this they say oh
[1:48:28] it's my wife in the first place
[1:48:33] the professor
[1:48:35] the second one he best leaded
[1:48:39] never
[1:48:41] those two
[1:48:43] for me and you
[1:48:45] disqualify him
[1:48:47] of being the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:49] looking it from the human human way of
[1:48:52] looking at this or he lie or he do this
[1:48:54] or he do that he does not fit well it's
[1:48:57] not that
[1:48:58] God was just anywhere
[1:49:00] that's that's a projection there's an
[1:49:03] attribute
[1:49:04] in God that God wanted to display
[1:49:08] and attribute was moving
[1:49:10] and they bring Adam he bring Abraham and
[1:49:15] his wife they consult they conjure lies
[1:49:20] attribute of God bring them together
[1:49:21] they see that God was watching God said
[1:49:24] yes that is what I want that's one more
[1:49:27] step
[1:49:29] just tell you now this is my sister and
[1:49:30] they did that
[1:49:32] and the prophet in this age we have read
[1:49:34] that scripture over and over and over
[1:49:36] but the prophet of the age came to tell
[1:49:39] us that if if that is not happen
[1:49:43] we don't know what Grace is therefore
[1:49:46] the attribute of Grace was projected and
[1:49:49] Adam
[1:49:50] Abraham and could not help it they have
[1:49:53] to lie
[1:49:55] they had to align to bring that to pass
[1:49:58] and when they bring that to pass God
[1:50:00] said amen
[1:50:02] and not only that
[1:50:04] in the book of Hebrews
[1:50:08] God
[1:50:10] Christ in a different Tabernacle
[1:50:13] Christ the same God that allowed them to
[1:50:17] lie
[1:50:18] that give concept
[1:50:20] that come to say you know what that
[1:50:23] happened because of Grace
[1:50:25] came to Paul
[1:50:27] and Paul wanted to write
[1:50:31] the autobiography
[1:50:34] write the life
[1:50:36] of Abraham what did he say Abraham it
[1:50:40] was a Divine commentary
[1:50:42] who it was Christ in Abraham
[1:50:46] it was Christ in Paul that was right
[1:50:49] inside you know towards this guy might
[1:50:52] have stagger here might have lied he
[1:50:55] might have 10 lies might have done this
[1:50:57] and I've done that but from the Divine
[1:50:59] commentary when I look Beyond The
[1:51:01] Cutting of Time When I Look to what God
[1:51:04] was writing
[1:51:06] this man did not lie he did not disobey
[1:51:10] God everything was perfect
[1:51:14] that
[1:51:15] is what makes me and you
[1:51:18] different from God
[1:51:20] for me and you
[1:51:22] we can write them off right from here
[1:51:27] listen
[1:51:30] is
[1:51:31] the prophet said he know only as
[1:51:34] internal Spirit the bride was already
[1:51:37] existed in him
[1:51:38] when God was in the spirit being God
[1:51:41] myself I like to put myself there
[1:51:45] I don't know about you if you have that
[1:51:47] Revelation you can put yourself there
[1:51:49] is that we were already assisting in him
[1:51:53] in his mind yes she is she's existing in
[1:51:57] his thoughts before there was anything
[1:51:59] when God said oh
[1:52:02] I want to go to the Earth
[1:52:06] to express myself in flesh
[1:52:10] there were attribute that was a hint
[1:52:12] that were Consulting with him
[1:52:15] they were taught that he was
[1:52:17] fellowshipping with
[1:52:20] that thought is me and you
[1:52:25] let me ask you let me qualify what I'm
[1:52:27] saying
[1:52:28] the prophet said
[1:52:29] if God would have asked him
[1:52:32] which age
[1:52:34] he would like to preach
[1:52:37] he said it would be I would choose this
[1:52:39] age
[1:52:39] in other words when God was sitting down
[1:52:42] saying okay
[1:52:45] in this in the age of disciple Church
[1:52:47] ages
[1:52:49] who will go on to the Earth to preach
[1:52:51] brother Brown was there as a thought
[1:52:54] he said I will go there
[1:52:57] you were there brother you said I will
[1:52:59] be here as a preacher as a pastor you
[1:53:01] will raise up your hands and I will go
[1:53:03] there and say wife you or you came up
[1:53:06] and you were fellowshiping in God in his
[1:53:09] attribute in his mind
[1:53:11] you will agree with the word of God
[1:53:13] because you were a part of God don't
[1:53:15] separate Jesus Christ from his bride
[1:53:17] never you do that
[1:53:23] he said she was she was existing
[1:53:27] what about those thought of God
[1:53:30] are they etana I did not
[1:53:33] the internal thought of God
[1:53:36] let us and then and he thought of God in
[1:53:39] Tana yes therefore
[1:53:42] if you ask me Brother Joseph
[1:53:45] who am I speaking to this morning
[1:53:48] I am speaking to the internal thought of
[1:53:50] God
[1:53:53] the internal thought of God that live in
[1:53:57] 16 elements
[1:53:58] therefore this is not who you are
[1:54:01] this is a piece of that
[1:54:03] that in time if God follows all of us
[1:54:07] will go back today but what is inside of
[1:54:10] you is internal nothing can take that
[1:54:13] therefore if you come here you are here
[1:54:16] because God transported you here
[1:54:19] you are an ambassador you are a
[1:54:22] representative of God you are here to
[1:54:25] display to the world that Jesus Christ
[1:54:27] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:54:31] how will people know that
[1:54:34] how will people know that is it by
[1:54:36] speaking tongue or is it by no is it the
[1:54:39] Bible said that they they the children
[1:54:42] of God the whole world
[1:54:44] the Hindu the Buddhist unbeliever they
[1:54:48] are waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:54:51] sons of God what is the manifestation
[1:54:53] it's the one people who are able to take
[1:54:56] God at this world
[1:54:58] when God speak the word you stand there
[1:55:01] you say praise God I believe it
[1:55:04] you don't know how to explain it you
[1:55:06] can't even explain God God is a
[1:55:09] supernatural God therefore the ability
[1:55:12] the ability to believe God
[1:55:14] it does not come because you pray too
[1:55:16] much it was given to You by The
[1:55:18] Sovereign Grace of God therefore when
[1:55:21] you receive that God give you ability to
[1:55:24] receive the word of God for your age let
[1:55:26] me tell you
[1:55:27] you are the most richest person on the
[1:55:30] face of the Earth
[1:55:32] Hallelujah
[1:55:36] Hallelujah
[1:55:39] listen
[1:55:40] I want to read my close
[1:55:47] you see
[1:55:49] I just want to what I said I got project
[1:55:52] I want to read that to qualify so that
[1:55:54] you see who is this
[1:55:57] paragraph one three one one three the
[1:56:01] prophet said God Is A Healer
[1:56:03] and he cannot heal unless there is a
[1:56:06] sick
[1:56:06] somebody sick
[1:56:08] to heal you see if there has never been
[1:56:12] a sickness
[1:56:13] there will never been a Healer God being
[1:56:18] a Healer his attribute projected
[1:56:21] money
[1:56:23] devil if you are is it the one thing you
[1:56:26] have to know first
[1:56:28] if you are a child of God
[1:56:30] settle down when that is settled in your
[1:56:33] mind anything that comes along
[1:56:36] UPS down failure mistake whatever
[1:56:40] God will take care of it because the
[1:56:43] Bible said all peace
[1:56:46] all things your failure
[1:56:49] all things your sickness energy put it
[1:56:52] there our thing we work together
[1:56:56] you may not understand it but as the
[1:56:59] message begin to you begin to grow in
[1:57:01] the message you begin to find out that
[1:57:04] the mistake you made
[1:57:07] the path you took in your life Johnny
[1:57:10] God was watching over that
[1:57:13] and God sometimes are nothing to happen
[1:57:16] because he is the only one who knows the
[1:57:19] next step
[1:57:20] you don't know therefore you might cry
[1:57:23] let me give you an example
[1:57:25] yeah why God
[1:57:29] and a woman a woman in the world
[1:57:32] that woman
[1:57:34] first husband second husband third
[1:57:36] husband fourth fifth
[1:57:39] I believe
[1:57:41] that that woman would have cried and
[1:57:43] cried because we later find that this
[1:57:45] woman was the seed of God
[1:57:48] there was something in that woman that
[1:57:51] was crying out she don't want to do this
[1:57:54] the first husband left second husband
[1:57:56] and she cried and cried and cried and
[1:57:59] God was watching
[1:58:02] and the reason why God was watching I
[1:58:03] can show you I have a quote here the
[1:58:06] prophet said God demand God wants
[1:58:09] Worship in the life of that sister
[1:58:13] therefore we come to the time he was
[1:58:15] there deceased husband and the whole
[1:58:18] country or the whole city saying you
[1:58:21] know see that sister
[1:58:22] nobody should associate with that sister
[1:58:25] that sister is smart
[1:58:27] is gone
[1:58:28] and when it come to that when everybody
[1:58:31] decided this woman when everybody
[1:58:33] started she's not good
[1:58:36] then
[1:58:38] the attributes
[1:58:40] of God begin to look down
[1:58:42] begin to go inside I need to pass that
[1:58:45] where that woman was
[1:58:48] that what happened to you God needed to
[1:58:51] pass through where you were walking
[1:58:52] whether you were going to denomination
[1:58:54] God needed to pass through there and
[1:58:58] when he passed there all of a sudden
[1:59:01] all of a sudden
[1:59:03] gosh your
[1:59:05] and where God show up the seventh sea
[1:59:07] was displayed
[1:59:08] and when there's someone see display
[1:59:10] brother
[1:59:12] everything about her life
[1:59:14] that woman I see that oh what I I
[1:59:18] thought it was bad
[1:59:21] was for my advantage
[1:59:23] when I stand and it was what people used
[1:59:26] to mock me
[1:59:28] God uses to bring me closer to God to
[1:59:32] herself and when that is struck her what
[1:59:35] did he do she ran straight to the street
[1:59:37] he said come and see who has told me all
[1:59:40] my life
[1:59:41] God Jesus did not tell her or her life
[1:59:44] but when that sea open that woman could
[1:59:47] know there's a reason that reason was
[1:59:51] becoming clear and he went into this he
[1:59:54] went to the street and he called the
[1:59:56] Bible said
[1:59:58] because of that woman infant woman the
[2:00:02] whole street
[2:00:03] were saved
[2:00:05] let me again let me look for this quote
[2:00:07] you see what God wanted worship
[2:00:12] God wants a worship but he allowed this
[2:00:14] woman first husband second husband third
[2:00:17] husband
[2:00:18] but for her life
[2:00:19] on the first it was messed up
[2:00:22] but God has a purpose for her
[2:00:26] do you know why brother
[2:00:28] if you have never experienced
[2:00:31] humiliation
[2:00:33] if you have never experienced people
[2:00:35] mock at you
[2:00:37] if you have never experienced you were
[2:00:39] in the valley
[2:00:41] one time
[2:00:43] with a lot of sin on your back
[2:00:46] that you cannot erase by by any eraser
[2:00:51] you cannot because it's always there and
[2:00:54] all of a sudden
[2:00:56] the seven sea come to your your path
[2:00:59] you know what happened
[2:01:01] you will know what true worship is
[2:01:04] because it happened to you because his
[2:01:07] worship is not playing worship is not
[2:01:09] only play music worship is seeing
[2:01:12] yourself you look where God brought you
[2:01:13] and you can identify
[2:01:17] that is what worship is all about and
[2:01:20] that's what that woman God needed that
[2:01:23] let me tell you who can tell that woman
[2:01:27] after he had met with the with the
[2:01:29] seventh seal standing there designing
[2:01:32] what is in heart telling her lives like
[2:01:35] her life who can tell that woman
[2:01:37] that there is no God nobody
[2:01:41] nobody
[2:01:42] nobody can tell her oh God doesn't exist
[2:01:45] is this when you are sick
[2:01:48] and God they told you oh there's nothing
[2:01:50] I can do for you and God comes around
[2:01:53] and heal you
[2:01:56] can somebody tell you God doesn't heal
[2:01:59] nobody can tell you
[2:02:01] you know why because you experience it
[2:02:06] you know it
[2:02:08] that's what Grace is
[2:02:10] when you experience Grace my brother
[2:02:13] you know what you can see yourself
[2:02:16] that you were once a sinner
[2:02:19] all of us here
[2:02:20] I don't know where you came I know where
[2:02:22] I came from I know my background
[2:02:26] to see
[2:02:28] that in this end time
[2:02:30] the judge of Heaven and Earth
[2:02:33] in 1963
[2:02:35] he came down
[2:02:37] and he put his face he said I am the
[2:02:40] judge of Heaven and Earth
[2:02:42] and when he came what did he come to do
[2:02:44] he came to tell us that our DNA
[2:02:50] have acquitted us because we never did
[2:02:52] it
[2:02:55] there was DNA test
[2:02:58] that would trust me and you
[2:03:00] to the mind of God
[2:03:02] and when he trace it down
[2:03:04] he saw me the way he saw me in the
[2:03:08] beginning
[2:03:09] he trusts you he said you have never
[2:03:12] seen the first place
[2:03:13] he said you are not a sinner
[2:03:16] you are a son of God you are a daughter
[2:03:19] of a God and from there he said who can
[2:03:22] let charge
[2:03:24] I guess in God's elect
[2:03:26] who who Who's pastor who brought you in
[2:03:30] and who will take you out is God who
[2:03:32] brought you in you are a son of God you
[2:03:35] are a daughter of God the DNA test there
[2:03:38] was a paternity test that you came from
[2:03:41] God that you are a son of God and that
[2:03:45] is what the bride
[2:03:47] is reliner

[2:08:27] in Jesus precious name we pray
[2:08:30] amen
[2:08:31] amen
[2:08:33] listen before I give to my brother
[2:08:37] I read the last quote then we the
[2:08:40] prophet said God Is A Healer
[2:08:42] he cannot hear unless somebody be sick
[2:08:44] to he still if they have never been
[2:08:47] sickness there have never been a Healer
[2:08:49] God Is A Healer his own attribute
[2:08:53] projected those things
[2:08:55] there has to be something to respond to
[2:08:58] that attribute that was in God now is
[2:09:01] that God the word of God means an object
[2:09:04] of worship God wanted God wanted to be
[2:09:07] worshiped so he has to project something
[2:09:11] that we're worship Him Jesus said to the
[2:09:14] woman at the world God is a spirit
[2:09:17] and then I worship Him must worship Him
[2:09:20] in spirit and the truth
[2:09:22] as I saw when the spirit of God is near
[2:09:26] what will take place salvation will be
[2:09:28] introduced
[2:09:30] salvation that will bring spiritual
[2:09:32] worship
[2:09:34] not singing of Dreams
[2:09:37] not a singing of him altogether
[2:09:40] but a worship in the spirit
[2:09:44] may God bless you
[2:09:47] thank you my brother for
[2:09:49] for giving me opportunity to come and
[2:09:52] we we love you
[2:09:54] we love the church and we love the Bride
[2:09:57] of Jesus Christ
[2:09:58] God bless you my brother
[2:10:14] wow
[2:10:17] hallelujah what a blessed people we are
[2:10:20] amen we just seen the love of God
[2:10:24] unbelievable this morning because the
[2:10:28] you know many many things when the
[2:10:30] brothers started preaching I was crying
[2:10:33] some of the exact same things he said
[2:10:36] almost word for word we preached three
[2:10:38] weeks ago here the second last sermon
[2:10:41] said you believe in that Jesus said in
[2:10:44] the Bible you believe in the father
[2:10:45] believe also in me believe also
[2:10:49] amen and people always get caught in the
[2:10:51] father in Christ then they couldn't
[2:10:54] believe in the prophet and now they
[2:10:56] can't believe in the bride of Christ
[2:10:58] Christ in his bride it's just amazing
[2:11:01] and the thoughts of God the prophet said
[2:11:02] he said when when God had those thoughts
[2:11:05] you you became and he spoke them you
[2:11:07] were the spoken word you are the spoken
[2:11:11] word book
[2:11:13] ing around
[2:11:15] God's spoken word theophany is just
[2:11:17] beautiful oh wow amen and you know you
[2:11:21] know when you look at the The Prophet's
[2:11:23] message and the last three or four
[2:11:25] messages he preached he mentioned the
[2:11:28] gene the gene of God multiple times
[2:11:31] about 23 times but he'd only mentioned
[2:11:34] it one or two times all the other years
[2:11:37] of his ministry but God knew he was
[2:11:40] taking the prophet off the scene and he
[2:11:41] wanted you know you're his Gene and he
[2:11:44] mentioned it there's over and over and
[2:11:45] over and over again in the last four
[2:11:47] messages this is the gene of God the
[2:11:49] gene of God
[2:11:50] God's doing the same thing today
[2:11:53] Antonia you're in my thoughts you're my
[2:11:56] theophany you're my theophany you're my
[2:11:59] spoken word you're my spoken word
[2:12:02] and very very soon
[2:12:05] I'm gonna take us home
[2:12:06] God knows when he's taking his home God
[2:12:08] knew when he was taking the prophet home
[2:12:10] and he's trying to tell you
[2:12:12] you were of me you came for me you were
[2:12:15] me you were there you were there you
