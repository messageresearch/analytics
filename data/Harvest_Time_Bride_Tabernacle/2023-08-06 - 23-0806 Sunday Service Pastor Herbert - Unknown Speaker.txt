very welcome welcome you all I would encourage you many who are out for different you know reasons responsibilities last night but if you could watch the video it was really a master piece you know if I could just take one minute tell you in short all God's people he called them to dirty business he sent Elijah to a woman at the river and he fed her fed him with dirty Ravens Ravens eat on dead animals but he chose Ravens to feed his prophet and when the prophet will be the widow woman obeyed the blessings were unbelievable her food never ran out and then you look in the ma help me out the man that had the leprosy and he sent him to a dirty River when there was all kinds of clean rivers but when they obeyed Blessings Now amen just think about God and sometimes you know he he even mentioned he said when he sent Elijah he never even provided for him he never provided him a home a bad and he chose to feed him in a dirty way but obedience and it just it was just beautiful

thank you we are having good time with brother Dell Flagstaff his wife Garcia brother from Sister Sister Myra yeah and the brother yeah we are having good time at the pastor's place and we really enjoy thank you thank you very much [Music] we shall continue with uh our subject we shall continue yeah okay we can start up so while we are standing like that uh uh we shall read from the book of Saint John chapter 15. Saint John chapter 15 verse 13. and the verse 15 verse 13 to verse 15. greater love has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends you are my friends if you do whatever I command you uh henceforth I call you not servants for this servant no it's not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you father once again we ask that you escort the reading of the words with your blessings father may you expound your word again to our Hearts to our lives that this word may edify us father that we may be more more nearer to you and the more look like you O Father and a more spiritual father make us everything more and more and more as we are approaching the nearing of you are coming bless us this morning Lord take me out of the way and your word is yours not mine so that you do what you want as you can talk to us in Jesus name Lord we pray amen we may be seated all right now let me try to go back to the foundation yesterday uh try to look at the foundation then see how what we are going to build on top today so yesterday we we saw how our Lord Jesus Christ he was fulfilling a scripture somewhere in the book of Deuteronomy I think it was Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse somewhere there is is the verse 15 or what it was fulfilling because uh Moses told the children of Israel that the Lord God shall raise you a prophet like me under him you should listen to right if you don't listen you become disobedient if you listen then you are obedient and then the Lord can start to build good things on the top of the foundation of obedience so now when our Lord was there with the disciples and the Pharisees then those people were not listening to him they were doubting him they were starting to fast with him so it prompted him to court for them about the only woman who was the woman of very fast of zidon the Widow and then he quoted it to them about Norman the Reaper there he finished his courting and then it was our job to see let's go through the Bible and find out why did he quote that and why did he say something in the book of Matthew chapter 10. that's when verse 41 42. he who will receive a prophet in a prophetess name will receive a reward that's right so we got another things put them together who said it was the Lord Jesus Christ who commanded and he commissioned that whoever whether you will be in 2023 whether you are in what age as long as if I can send a prophet remember that behind the prophet there is a sender and that sender is the Lord himself because somewhere in the Book of Romans chapter 10 he said but how can they call on him of whom they have never heard of and how can they hear about him if there is no a saint person a preacher someone who has been sent so there we discovered that God prepares the three things he prepares himself with what to do and then he prepares a right person to send that's the prophet and then he prepares the true receiver because down there in the book of Isaiah where we did not really talk about or maybe we did not read it says but who has received our report who so there must be some people who are prepared to receive a prophet as they receive him they have received God so if they listen to him then we shall we find that the three things must be in line God who is Ever righteous omnipotent omniscientity never changes he's always holy for him he is intact he is always there so the only people who have to amend themselves and listen and be obedient must be a prophet and a receiver so that's why God starts with a prophet he starts with him so he starts with him then we saw a good example that was Elijah in the Bible God called Elijah and the commissioned him to go under dwell by the river kill it whereby if you see the circumstances of the river the river always consists of so many things too much mosquitoes there snakes there all kind of things animals they stay by the river there not a human being but he was sent there God was laying what we call a good foundation in a prophet so that he can be of great use to help others in otherwise God Was preparing him to be a good conduit is a transition that things can reach somewhere crossed through him a good person an obedient person so there we discovered all those things in Elijah and so on but we want to see there is a question there is a question that they asked brother Branham if you read c-o-d if you read a message this big book the red ones page one thousand and 42 there was a question that they asked brother Branham okay let me read the question brother Branham if you have time please explain in Matthew chapter 10 verse 41. I would like to know what is a prophet's reward now he answers well now Jesus said who's ever receive a prophet in the name of our Prophet receiver Prophet is a reward a prophet his reward is to be a friend with the prophet whosoever receives a righteous man in the name of a richest man receive a righteous man his reward is that right and if they want to know what a prophet is reward is is to be a friend to the prophet see that is a reward he is your friend like a mighty woman it might become in handy sometimes see it did with her see what God is servants Holy Spirit if we will manifest every promise that is uh okay let me end there Watch God's servants so this is a question that they asked brother Branham then he gives us a small crew that like a mighty woman so then when we go in the Bible we find this the mighty woman who is being a prophet in our home and even she proposed that we should make here a small extension whereby when this man comes and is tired he gets some food here and maybe something he had to drink and he lays down and he goes she received him in other times she received him and she made him like a real good friend because a prophet is God Is A Friend how do they start to be God his friend when they are obedient God when when when God chooses a prophet and he becomes obedient to his command or to his directives then God raises that Prophet to a level that he now calls him my friend so when he becomes a friend of God then he also as he goes on proclaiming the word of God to the Believers they also believe the word of God through the prophet and the time will come that those Believers also they elevate to a level of also becoming friends they also become friends of the Prophet as a prophet is also a friend of God so any times all were all of us then we become friends of God [Applause] praise the Lord yeah that's why I have gone with you in the Book of John chapter 14 15 where we have read that uh he he revealed to them he revealed to them that this is what we call Great not great only but greater Greater Love praise the Lord so he revealed to them he revealed to this uh to to his disciples that are greater love has no money than it is that a man lay down his life for his friends in other times he said if you go somewhere he said for their sake I sanctify myself Jesus say this all for their sake I sanctify myself and then time came that he died so some people did not realize why but now he's revering to them that the real ones that I'm gonna die for so by that time he was not yet but he was he was forward revealing to them he was giving them a crew that when I will be crucified when I will die on the cross that kind of love is called greater but it is a proper City for the friends praise the Lord yeah okay now let us explain a little bit about something friend the Bible tells me that Abram was lifted to a level of becoming God's friend but after some trials he underwent so many trials and so on and he was proved and he was qualified to be called a friend of God for example in the book of second Chronicles chapter 20 verse 7 says like this art not thou our God who did this to drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and I gave a state to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever you see so Abram became God is a friend and also in somewhere in the book of Isaiah chapter 41 verse 8 it says like this but thou Israel at my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend so good himself is testifying that Abraham my friend also in the New Testament there's another um witness here James chapter 2 verse 23 he says like this under the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abram believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and that he was called the friend of God that is right so you find out that uh brother Branham has answered the question has answered in the Book of Matthew which we read yesterday and now we see how things goes how things goes that okay for you to achieve and get a reward you must totally be obedient and you must totally stand in the line and you make the three things line up so perfect so that when a promise comes it comes through when everybody comes it goes through very clear and good to you that's how we receive our Rewards that's how we become the friends of God that's how we can stand trials praise the Lord so you you will find that uh when brother Branham is saying like that about the sunamite woman then he also has a story that we all of us know that one day brother Branham was on his Service as a post office down there in Memphis his plane was grounded that he stayed there and I did not go under the Holy Spirit lead him to go to a certain woman whose son was dying and a god could listen to the prayer under God listened to the prayers of this woman the woman prayed all the night she was a real faithful woman with faith I was looking at this morning to to in this message book expectation and I want to read again uh uh what brother Brahman was doing um so he went down there and I said he met this woman and the woman said the person those people down there they would call a preacher person and then he said how do you know me brother says how did you know me she said in the Bible in the Bible and uh she had prayed yesterday or the night and the god listen to our prayers but God could not do anything but God wanted like like a widow woman in the Bible and with the woman who in the Bible she was a good woman she couldn't pray and the God can listen but God did not do any Miracle until he lined the heart in a straight line according to his own program so God wanted brother I mean Prophet Elijah after going through the tests and so on to go down there and line up put a woman with a woman in a line uh when whether she's trying to um kind of like fussing kind of like maybe doubting or maybe trying to make some reasoning capacity but the little food that I have is only for me and my son so when we eat and we die but the prophet said no no no no no you do this okay do it first do this bring for me first stand in the line listen to my voice do according to my voice because it is mine there's someone also behind me praise the Lord so when she lined up in the line the Miracles starting to happen so God is not God of shortcuts and whatever when he wants to do his things in his own program what you do just line up and be obedient so this is shunamite I mean this woman down there in Memphis she already prayed her only son was dying that's true her only son was dying but the Lord God revealed to her that I will send a prophet to you I will send someone to you and there will be some kind of some question is and you will answer and soon you line up and the things will go well amen then when he came down to that a woman and there she was patting him and okay uh I tell you I tell you about her the prophet and I said person he took the road that's wrong when he's about okay now she is explaining to a prophet about how her son took a wrong away and I got a group and she contracted a disease [Music] let me start from here she said and I said do you know my name she said no sir I said how do you know I was a person she said the person said did you ever hear about the shunamite woman that had a baby by the Lord promised her the baby and the baby died and I said yes she said I was a woman that way and I promised the Lord that I would raise my baby for him and I said the Lord give me husband and I am love and I I I lovely boy and I said person he took the road that's wrong when he's about a few years ago and I said he got a dangerous disease then real disease and I said uh it went so long on him we didn't suspect it and I said and now he's laying in the room dying say the doctor has given him all kinds of shots and said he can't get well and I said he's been unconscious since yesterday the doctor was back here and I said look for the worst at any time there was no hopes for him his blood was four plus and nothing could help him at all and I said he is dying and said I got down on my knees and I said I prayed and said I prayed oh lord said is a woman like this where where is Eurasia so this woman is telling the stories to a prophet said I got down on my knees and I prayed and I prayed and asked God where is Elijah praise the Lord the same story in the Bible was repeating and they just begin to praying said I prayed and I prayed and I said this morning just before daylight saved the Lord told stand at this gate so this woman said that the Lord told her stand out to the gate and they wait to line up in a true line so that I can perform things purely and so smoothly so under there was her back I was wait where she had been standing she was entertaining me anything wrong she said and look oh my begin to I walked into the house there was a great big Husky looking boy and she parted him he was laying there with with a blanket in his hand going like that and he was saying mommy it's so dark I don't know where it's going mommy like that she said honey child do you know Mommy child he was of course no matter how old you are You Are Mother's child just the same no matter what you've done you will still mother's boy and there she was patting him and loving him she said do you know Mommy saying you know your mommy he didn't seem like he recognized her he's hollering mommy going on he was unconscious like in that condition and that's all she said okay you know very well the story you know very well the story I will continue running maybe reading money you will find that brother brother must say I obeyed to the leadership of the spirit praise the Lord so it became obedient regardless of their situation at the airport whether the plane will deliver what God was in control of everything you see how God is great you see so therefore this woman here she lined up she she's also she has a face she prayed God listens but in other times God wanted to make a very good example put here in the life to make the three things go perfectly so that everybody comes there her boy was revived to life and the boy did not die that's right there's another story about sister Hattie amen when brother brother was telling a testimony about hunting the squirrels that you may not find squirrels in his kamora trees sometimes but God did provide them in his commercial he was narrating the story some people were there listening listening but maybe in their hearts they were saying wow what is this but this lady here she jumped in the line showing obedience and the breathing said oh no matter whatever what God does he does it when she said a very good word it really made God you're happy God is so hard jumping in the line straight lining up with a prophet and the God is said ask her to ask anything and I do it because now I have elevated her I have lived here to a friend level she is your friend as you are my friend therefore things are going smoothly asking her to ask anything praise the Lord so therefore let me go back to about the what Jesus said so when Jesus said you I no longer call you servants but now I call you friends because all things that I have had I have revealed them to you so becoming a friend is another great level you become a friend after undergoing so many trials after being tested under tried and have been proven to be a true Royal servant then God takes away that title of servant and puts you into being a friend Hallelujah after being proven for example uh in somewhere in the book of world even if Jesus did not mention this in the Book of John 15 he mentioned this in the Book of Luke uh I won't read that verse on him he mentioned this thing in the Book of Luke chapter 22 chapter 22 uh let me see chapter 22 verse 28 . he said like this you are they which have continued with me in my Temptations and verse 29 and I appoint unto you a kingdom is my father has appointed unto me you see now it is the same thing that the disciples and all the Believers who are with Jesus most of them they back seed most of them they drew back and they never continued with him but some will continue them some of them were just hypocrites they were not genuine because someone will also find some doubted him some worshiped him now he's saying you are they you are those who have continued with me in my temptation is and at this particular level now I appoint you a kingdom That You Will Rule under you will judge how do you become a judge the Bible says we shall judge but how do you become a judge you become a judge because you are safe is not judged that's right in other times he said how can you take out a beam of on your friends on yes and you are said if you have it so that means you have to be undergoing so many trials so many temptations that you stand and overcome and then you are qualified to be a judge because what you say you know it that's right so when he said I appoint your kingdom that means they have withstand they have stood a lot and they are believed and that they have tolerated all kind of problems all kind of trials they have never forsaken me Jesus they have continued with him in All The Temptations until they reached a level that he elevated them to call them friends and as well to appoint them that you will be judges yes how it's because there are some situations whereby so many backseat for example when he started to preach about eating my fresh and drinking my blood many people became offended they did not do understand and they did not even ask but what they did is to go back and Jesus did not go and he just said to Peter do you also want to go like others Jesus behaving as if that's not the job that brought him the job that brought him is to gather the Sheep to give the anointed to sakata but now there's scattering as if he is again supporting because he's telling Peter do you also want to go it is a Peter who defended himself and said it to whom another shall we go in other times Jesus was looking as if he's not caring because he was putting them on a test to see if they will stand with him also he did not send them away so that he can hide and and start fasting with the Pharisees he allowed them to listen he allowed them he allowed them to see how the composition or whatever goes on okay he said you are Father Abraham rejoiced when he saw my day the Pharisees are listening the disciples are listening here Jesus is starting a spiritual war and things are not going to be right it's a real spiritual World fighting with words he's entering a Battle Ground your father a Brown when he saw me on my bed he rejoiced ah therefore as he said started so the war started how come that you are not even not fatty and you have seen Abraham then he also said here don't think that you have life do you have anything in the Bible you you you you look into the scriptures thinking that you have life and I refuse to come to me then they said oh until they send you a Bill's the book the disciples are listening and they also said okay if a house is divided it cannot stand if a kingdom is divided it cannot stand so therefore I am not I bet you see a stronger man it takes a stronger man to bind a stronger man in the house then he can read his things so you so he was oh it was a real of Great War and then all of a sudden said you you are over your father the devil and they said okay started binding teeth looking for mistakes trying to see I it was a great War but out of that that great to war all things that happen plus the doctrine that he said his what is fresh was meat indeed and whatever it made so many people not to trust it and follow him no longer until Remain the real ones remember the the story of Gideon when he called everyone let's go let's go on the fight let's go on the fight let's go and the God said there are too many for nothing reduce them reduce them amen and when he introduce them here again he said there are still many let's give them a test take them to the river to go on a drink water you know some people you can't give them something when they are not in need in that time by telling people to go out and drink water I know many of them question themselves wow I'm just going to pretend why should I drink water for what they didn't understand you know sometimes when God tells you something he does not go through explaining it to you because it is your test it remains there and then they went down to the river and God told Gideon that whoever will put down his mouth into a river part them decide whoever will put a hand and lick like a dog this like this and then here like this like a dog Pat them this way so no one told one what to do but some of them they just blended into a will of God and I did what God wanted that's why Paul said you need to be patient until you do the will of God cast not your reward which has a great recompense so cast not your faith Keep On Believing keep on going back because he said God is not happy for anyone to draw back as he said in the book of Hebrews 10 35 there so therefore that's how God tried his people he reduced them to a good quality you cannot go under dig diamonds and then carry a full load of a track and say I've got Diamond no you must take that diamond to a test and tests you will do until you get the small refined one which has the weaker the best quality needed so no wonder you see people are backsliding you don't know did the pews were meant to be seated on people fill up until they make more Appeals but now you see people have gone away what are they doing some people are just positioning themselves to the positions they want to be but I want to add the jail I want to cheer you I want to tell you that please you are in the right track Never draw back [Music] keep on breathing see a good example in the Bible how Jesus is saying you are they that have continued with me during my temptation is so the word of God this message also has been undergoing many many trials the message but now you don't say oh this message is a disgrace this man said you look it's it remains very pure and good but it's people who want to make it look disgrace it's people who want to support it with this kind of stains and whatever it's people it's people's weaknesses the message is still good and the pure it's the people who are disobedient to line up you know when God is a true God and they send it to prophet and are you your disbelieve it then you already aside you are not in a straight line so when you wait for things are not going through don't blame the message don't blame God don't blame the prophet blame yourself because you have stood outside you are not in the line that's true and when you listen to a false of prophet then you remove away a real Prophet you put there someone else like in those times people remove their way Moses and they put balam in the middle things did not go well things did not go well in the Bible you find that some people used to take away a right prophet and put in the middle a wrong person and they got wrong results they got bad results they did not get real words but instead they got opposite instead of Life Death instead of Freedom captivity they went into captivities in the Babylon and so on because of their own mistakes we need not to do Mystic sex that we need to remain Royal understand in the line so that God's work can go so good on the small praise the Lord so therefore you find that then gives us safe you are now free you can ask anything whatever you're asking my name I will do it it's because you have been elevated to a friendship level I don't want to doubt you you are my friend I want to tell you that a friendship level you may have a brother but even being only brother is not enough there must be another level above that a friend you may have your husband and your husband is not enough he is your husband that's right but you must uplift him to a level of him becoming your friend because reaching a level of a friend that they never wear by there is nothing hidden all of mysteries are revealed all misties are revealed you may have your wife your wife and don't end there as that's all she's my wife she's my wife you have said with her that's good she has endure the test with you that's good she has passed so many tests that's good why can't you elevate her bring her to a level of being a friend too not on my wife which is also a friend not only a husband but he is also a friend not only a pastor but is also a friend not only believer but they are also friends you'll see we uplift that level because when Abraham became a friend of God he's saved can I hide anything from Abraham my friend Hallelujah Hallelujah I cannot hide anything from Abraham my friend I must tell him all the secrets I must reveal I must provide special Grace for him Hallelujah so that's why we need to impress this word as something very important yes to whom shall we go again who has life once of life we must select Peter so other people went and Jesus did not explain he did not bother to explain to them all you know I didn't mean this real fresh but but he left them to go sure the word he has his own so we must be very very determined especially in this end time we must be very determined because the world is changing so swiftly things are changing things are changing that these things are drawing our mind to think about our God when are you coming because there is no more peace in the world everywhere there is evil everywhere there's evil things are not going well people are promoting evil you remember in the time of uh Esther when she was promoted to be a queen as well also Carmen was promoted to be an enemy so in our time when God has promoted us we are not only a church but we are a bride then Senior has been also promoted and what's the work of the sin the Walk of the scene is to fight the bride what was the work of common was to fight tomorrow kind and fight the Jews who asked the true God and they killed them that's what happened but how did monologue how did the Esther overcome they concentrated themselves to pray too fast to seek God is Grace God is sufficient to Grace that's true and they overcame and when they did that what happened the same Signet the same Stomp those kings used to have a Signet on their hand it used to be something like also as well as a stump when something is stamped it is already recommended so the same King who signed for the death of the Jews King who signed for their life things changed that's right yeah things can change things can change if you pray if you trust God and I pray I tell you things can change your enemy can change and become your friend yes that's true so we have to continue we have to go forward we have to know that oh now we were elevated to us to a level of becoming God's friends so he does not sing that a friend of Jesus or what Bliss that one so far as Ash we sing knowing that oh we are real friends of God who have student trials so many things are going on so many things are testing the message so many things are testing the message believers who claim they have believed the message of the hour they must be tested under their message too must be tested so when Jesus called Peter he called him Matthew he called in Nathaniel he called all those disciples they followed him they even said Lord we have left all things and we have fallen to you and I promised them okay Whoever has left his people under his home under whatever has fooled me no no anyway but we will be he will be rewarded in this coming and in this world too he promised them but things are now going by Zach things are going astray things are going contrary so what did they do they endured those who endures were appointed to a kingdom and they were told in the day we shall judge the fellow tribes being a judge that means you went so many tests so many examinations and you passed under so on so you cannot become a judge for nothing so these people who are in the wars in the in the walls of judgment whatever courts in the world when they put on their goal and their widget or whatever and the people say you are worship you are whatever oh they don't call them for nothing those people underwent so many many trials they did so many examinations in school in research in everything they did not get their PHD for nothing so we may have our spirit too and we don't have them for nothing we undergo so many trials and so many things comes but please remember in the Bible God builds good things on an obedient Foundation that's why whoever comes to the Lord will never go intact without undergoing through tests and so on but when they come ask God for his sufficient Grace Lord help me Lord give me wisdom Lord give me perfumes Lord let me stand Lord bring me out of this wilderness and then you overcome praise the Lord that's right okay our Prophet said something like this I'm going to he says in this message in this message Souls that are in prison he says like this he uses a man that is it true he does nothing outside of what he does by man we realize that that his that that is his agent that what he chose why I don't know he could have made the son to preach the gospel he could make the wind to preach the gospel he could make the wind to do things but he chose man that was his idea that human that human would speak back to Human not himself but the word of the Lord came to the prophets the prophesires and a prophesire that denies the original word how can he be a true prophet the truth of the word and then if it doesn't then this uh word itself as is preached by the trueness of the word and by trueness of the Holy Spirit it will manifest everything promised that it promised praise the Lord yeah that's what the prophet is trying to explain to us that God has so many creation that he would have used either a sun s-u-n or wind or anything but it was not in his idea he just chose a man so that he can stand and then a man then a man put things in line he chose that he would speak to a man and a man speak to a man that's right that's how he does brother Dell lag stuff has caused there some of them maybe are his good ones that he really loves he would choose one to stand here and start preaching but it does not work it does not work he allows the preacher to stand here and speak backer to human beings too that's what God has done praise the Lord that's why let us never make a mistake and we sit there and then we put here cassette or a tip and then after hearing then we go home and I will say that is the service no him man man the one which we can hear here is poke that's true but he is no longer he's fresh he's no longer doing anything because Jesus commissioned and said these signs shall follow those who believe they shall lay their hands which has blood and afresh real low blood which is still warm and lay on the sick and they will be healed because Jesus stopped to preach his sermon on the side who touched me because I saw the vacuum from me doing the work from me to a woman who had the issue of the blood 12 years she got here because she touched a human being that's right so therefore this gospel shall continue likewise we shall need to come here and listen a living man breaking lay hands on the sick and they get healed a living man should take someone and take the baptism we pull and baptize any man should go and preach the gospel praise the Lord praise the Lord that's why Elisha did not come out he said you listen to a voice around you there's younger people there are corny people who will touch you and they put you and take you to do what the God wants he did not come out of the Grave or Elijah did not come out of his house as we saw yesterday he did not come out it's some people who are near number they are the ones who touched them and said sir you come let me hold your hand let's go and there they went so he was moving with those people around him and the work of God was done so in our time we just listened to the voice which spoke to us but the activities must be done by the living people the living preachers who are around but I've had some people don't want to go to churches they don't want to listen to a preacher they only listen to their voice and then go back home it's not good at all we can listen to it but we also still have the preachers to do the work of God praise the Lord so as I'm ending we have been elevated to a level of becoming God's friends because a prophet yielded himself to become a friend of God and we have also become friends and by that level remember you have now a possibility of asking God for your reward anything that you want believe it's your reward it's because you are the conduit is smooth it's good it's not it's not straight it's not zigzag it is straight it's it's good so what again because our Prophet promised us something like this you see it like this I am finishing with this quote uh-huh uh have I have have not I sent thee in that message he says like this and I remember always or immediately after that prophetism message God goes to work after the prophet gives the word then God goes to work on the word fast it is God to come forth fast the word is going to be preached first faith comes by hearing hearing of the word of God their true Prophet starts with the true word of God and it does not compromise on it anyway but it tells the people that you must be born again the promise is unto you and your children to them that is for far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call if he is a true prophet so a prophet brought a message and he went and now it's going to work after that word had been proclaimed it's now for us to see the results and God bless you this morning [Applause] Hallelujah friendship wave G Is Us divine [Music] ah what blessed sweet communion oh Jesus is

we're telling me we both have been elevated to the level of friends not just brothers you know but elevated to the level of friends isn't that a lovely thought undeserving as we are to be called
