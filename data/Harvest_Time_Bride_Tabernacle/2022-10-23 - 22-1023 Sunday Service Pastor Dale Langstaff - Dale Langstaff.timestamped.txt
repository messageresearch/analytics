[21:13] service the man just
[21:15] a very wonderful songs and
[21:19] and that's just awesome to be here just
[21:22] apologize again for my voice last Sunday
[21:27] was
[21:28] huh
[21:29] parts of it was terrible
[21:31] for my voice and I'm doing I feel
[21:34] perfectly fine but my voice
[21:37] is deceiving amen
[21:40] just for the girls maybe don't shut the
[21:42] mic off because last Sunday when we shut
[21:44] the mic off
[21:46] the video squealed
[21:49] for the people listening online it kind
[21:52] of messed up the video
[21:54] and so uh
[21:56] I'll either try and shut mine off or
[21:59] do whatever we do amen
[22:01] just good to be here just to announce
[22:03] our special meetings uh the second
[22:06] weekend of November we put a poster up
[22:08] there and just thank Abigail for doing
[22:10] the nice poster and and there's extra
[22:13] there if you want to take some home with
[22:15] you or put them up somewhere at your
[22:17] place to work or anything like that we
[22:19] have in there the second speaker is to
[22:23] be announced because we we're planning
[22:25] on uh junior brother Henry preaching but
[22:29] he couldn't come on his work visa
[22:32] and so he has reapplied him and his wife
[22:35] both for a just a regular Visa now his
[22:39] pastor
[22:40] also had applied and was supposed to be
[22:42] here in August for a Visa
[22:45] so it's kind of a race of whose Visa
[22:48] comes through first
[22:49] it could be could be Henry preaching it
[22:52] could be Henry's pastor preaching
[22:55] and if those two don't work out we're
[22:57] going to have somebody locally preaching
[22:59] for Friday night and then brother Ben
[23:01] will be here
[23:02] I believe Samantha is coming with them
[23:05] so brother Ben and Samantha will both be
[23:07] here
[23:09] Saturday and Sunday amen also I asked
[23:12] you just to pray with me
[23:13] and even Luanne were just uh myself for
[23:17] sure
[23:18] considering our trip to Uganda
[23:21] for February
[23:25] of course they're very anxious for me to
[23:27] give them dates
[23:29] and I've kind of been dragging my feet
[23:31] because I've been waiting for the world
[23:33] to come back to normal
[23:35] and uh
[23:37] we don't know if that'll ever happen
[23:39] completely but uh
[23:40] it's it's a
[23:43] I just uh
[23:45] looking for
[23:48] clearance from God and I just just have
[23:51] a
[23:52] it's it's perfectly like we're able to
[23:54] go non-vaccinated you just have to have
[23:57] a test before you go to the airport you
[23:59] have to have a test when you leave the
[24:01] airport
[24:02] but those things kind of weigh on your
[24:05] mind because when I get ready to come
[24:07] home if I get a test and it's positive I
[24:11] miss my Airlines
[24:13] and so those things are kind of
[24:16] they're kind of like unknown headaches
[24:19] amen and maybe I just need more faith or
[24:22] maybe I need a and also there's many
[24:25] brother Jim is planning on going
[24:28] and and uh because of the
[24:31] uh
[24:32] uh um and how to say it because of the
[24:36] excitement around the trip brother Jose
[24:39] Pastor Jose from Kitchener and Pastor
[24:42] John dankwell have both said they would
[24:43] go with me
[24:45] um to Uganda so
[24:47] I'm not sure
[24:49] I would like to take my wife with me so
[24:52] we would need a real miracle for God to
[24:54] lay that on her heart
[24:56] and then we would know God was here
[24:58] if she agreed to go
[25:01] amen
[25:02] but that would be just the real blessing
[25:05] so just I don't know what I'm saying
[25:08] there but
[25:09] I haven't just I haven't bought my
[25:11] ticket yet
[25:13] and uh
[25:17] of course
[25:19] when you go there
[25:21] they want you to say a long time
[25:24] there's just a
[25:26] but I
[25:28] when I'm gone I think of the church here
[25:30] and
[25:31] and you see her and so the longer I'm
[25:34] gone
[25:35] I feel like I've left you and I really
[25:37] haven't but I haven't
[25:39] and so just just praying for God's
[25:41] leadership and
[25:43] and all these things maybe we'll stand
[25:45] and just read the word and just pray
[25:48] this that this will be a blessing
[25:50] to us this morning Amanda just
[25:53] remember my throat if
[25:56] it goes wrong we'll just
[25:58] press over here
[25:59] Hebrews 11 we're going to start at six
[26:06] Hebrews 11 we're going to start at 6 and
[26:08] then we're going to drop to 13 and read
[26:11] a few scriptures there and I want to
[26:12] preach this morning on
[26:14] your or our confession
[26:18] your or our confession
[26:21] and I want to show you this morning
[26:24] and maybe that's why God hasn't been
[26:26] able to do as much
[26:28] as what we thought he would
[26:30] is because without your confession or
[26:33] our confession a proper confession God
[26:35] can do nothing at all
[26:37] the Bible said that Jesus could do very
[26:39] few Miracles because of their unbelief
[26:41] but I'm going to show you in the word of
[26:43] God where it was your confession
[26:45] of who he is
[26:47] is when he can operate
[26:50] like he is supposed to amen but without
[26:54] faith it is impossible to please him for
[26:57] he that cometh to God must believe that
[27:00] he is
[27:02] and that he's the rewarder of those that
[27:04] diligently
[27:06] and that word diligently seek Him is
[27:09] confess him
[27:10] that means those that confess that he is
[27:14] let's go to 13.
[27:17] verse 13.
[27:20] for all those all died in the faith not
[27:22] having received the promise but having
[27:25] seen afar off and we're persuaded of
[27:28] them and embrace them and there you go
[27:32] and confessed
[27:36] they were saved by their confession
[27:39] they never even had the Holy Ghost said
[27:41] but it was their confession and their
[27:44] confession that they were strangers and
[27:46] pilgrims
[27:47] on the earth for they that say such
[27:50] things declared plainly
[27:52] that they seek the country
[27:55] and truly if they had been mindful of
[27:57] the country from hence they came they
[27:59] might have had opportunity to return and
[28:02] now not first there when you look that
[28:03] up in the message the prophet talked
[28:05] about Enoch
[28:06] and Enoch was raptured
[28:09] because he was seeking a country
[28:11] amen we know Abraham said he was seeking
[28:14] a country whose Builder and maker was
[28:16] God in 16 but now they desired a better
[28:20] country
[28:21] that is a heavenly
[28:24] where of God is not ashamed to be called
[28:28] their God for he hath prepared
[28:32] a city
[28:34] for them
[28:35] Lord Jesus we decide you to bless your
[28:38] word
[28:39] as it goes forth and bless us this
[28:41] morning in your name we pray amen Let's
[28:44] uh you can have your seats we're going
[28:46] to turn to Romans 8 34.
[28:50] amen and just uh just looking forward to
[28:53] what God has for us amen and just Romans
[28:57] 8 34. who is he that condemneth it is
[29:02] Christ that died yea rather that is
[29:05] raised again and who even is at the
[29:08] right hand of God who also maketh
[29:12] intercession
[29:13] for us and there in this verse and the
[29:16] message and the message Hub the prophet
[29:19] mentioned this verse hundreds of times
[29:22] and I read hundreds of quotes in this
[29:24] verse and they always came back to he
[29:27] made intercession it wasn't openly
[29:30] they made intercession for those that
[29:34] confessed him
[29:36] it was because of your confession
[29:39] that he made intercession now let's turn
[29:41] one more scripture to lay our foundation
[29:43] we'll build it up here Hebrews 3 1.
[29:46] Hebrews 3 1 is he is therefore holy
[29:51] Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[29:52] calling consider the apostles and the
[29:55] high priests of your profession
[29:58] of Jesus Christ and that word profession
[30:02] and we're going to read it in quotes
[30:03] that we're going to post up later
[30:05] is confessions
[30:07] if you come if you switch that to the
[30:09] dictionary the prophet said the prophet
[30:12] translation
[30:13] for that word profession of Jesus Christ
[30:17] this confession of Jesus Christ and this
[30:21] morning I want to tell you that there's
[30:23] only one word One Reason
[30:26] why we don't make a confession
[30:29] one main reason
[30:31] and we'll find that main reason over in
[30:33] Mark eight
[30:34] 38.
[30:36] God help us God help me
[30:39] I could give you life examples you know
[30:42] just I can remember even in business and
[30:46] and not that we're in church but total
[30:50] complete strangers and they would talk
[30:52] about you know when my business that I
[30:54] was young and different things and I
[30:56] would tell them I said
[30:58] it's because of God
[31:00] it's God's blessing on the business I
[31:04] didn't for years and years there was no
[31:06] advertisements never ever lost money
[31:09] just never signed a contract but never
[31:12] lost money
[31:14] for years and years maybe one time lost
[31:16] a small amount but it was God
[31:19] it was confession but God wants you to
[31:22] confess it in your highways and byways
[31:24] and in your life and in your kingdom and
[31:26] where you work and in your household
[31:28] it's your confession but why don't we do
[31:30] it
[31:31] and this verse explains it here and it's
[31:34] also in Luke 9 26 and we're I just like
[31:37] the wording here he said whosoever
[31:40] therefore shall be ashamed of me
[31:44] that's why you don't confess
[31:46] and my words in this adulterous
[31:51] and sinful generation
[31:53] now that is definitely
[31:55] today
[31:57] of him also
[31:59] the son of man be ashamed oh
[32:06] when he cometh in the glory of his
[32:08] father
[32:09] with the Holy Angels
[32:12] you know
[32:14] too many times
[32:16] and God help us God I'm not I'm not even
[32:18] preaching to you here but just in
[32:20] general too many times
[32:23] and and I know I like I said this ain't
[32:25] there's nobody here I'm preaching to
[32:27] myself but too many times we almost run
[32:31] a dual lifestyle
[32:33] you know you go to work and you're just
[32:36] in your work mode and that's fine
[32:39] and then you come to church and you're a
[32:42] Holy Roller
[32:43] yeah and
[32:45] and I'm I'm not saying you should
[32:49] but
[32:50] we should be the same no matter where we
[32:52] went
[32:53] amen uh our confession should be the
[32:56] same you know
[33:00] we went to Kitchener this week with my
[33:03] brother
[33:04] and we were in Elmira and we went to uh
[33:08] shop there grocery store
[33:11] and Luanne actually it must have been
[33:13] Monday because she wasn't with us and
[33:16] and it was a beautiful atmosphere
[33:20] there's people
[33:22] that don't have the Revelation that you
[33:24] don't have
[33:25] they don't have the Mysteries revealed
[33:27] on the word of God
[33:29] the Bible has not become a new book it's
[33:31] completely an old letter of laws and
[33:33] do's and don'ts
[33:37] and I'm telling you
[33:40] it's your pastor I felt as much of the
[33:42] Holy Ghost there
[33:43] as I do in many message churches
[33:47] and a lot of it
[33:49] are all of it
[33:50] is their confession
[33:52] no they don't have what you have
[33:54] and they may not be a part of the bride
[33:56] of Christ but their confession is Jesus
[33:59] Christ it's the Jesus Christ of all they
[34:02] know
[34:03] it might be of the Jesus Christ of all
[34:05] the Old Testament
[34:07] but it's still Jesus Christ
[34:10] uh-huh and they're on Main Street
[34:15] and they're not afraid
[34:16] to clearly confess
[34:19] their confession
[34:21] we the same as the story in in uh
[34:25] I mentioned this before we went to uh
[34:27] where we were yesterday uh
[34:30] Kent Bridge
[34:32] and me and Jared stopped there to get a
[34:33] sub
[34:34] and beautiful Christian people
[34:37] and we walked out she said God bless you
[34:40] bless your day
[34:42] see
[34:44] it's just a way of life
[34:47] see if if God's on your mind you know
[34:49] the Bible talks about when you raise up
[34:50] when you go to sleep with your kids you
[34:53] know talk about them when you wake up
[34:54] talk about them when you walk all along
[34:55] the way talk about them when you're
[34:56] ready to lay down and see if Jesus
[34:59] Christ is on your mind
[35:00] he'll just roll right off your tongue
[35:03] you're just huh
[35:06] and the Bible says that he's in Heaven
[35:09] Beside the father make an intercession
[35:14] a prophet said for the ones that are
[35:16] confessing
[35:18] to testimony
[35:20] and I want to show you a perfect example
[35:22] of this
[35:24] in the Bible
[35:27] and we would think that she's a
[35:29] fantastic great person
[35:31] which she is
[35:33] but it was the most unpeculiar person
[35:36] that you would ever believe matter of
[35:39] fact our Prophet said that this person
[35:41] came from the linings of incest from lot
[35:46] and his two daughters
[35:54] wow
[35:55] but because of the power of confession
[36:02] God completely changed her life
[36:04] for eternity
[36:07] amen
[36:08] confession
[36:09] Ruth
[36:14] you look at her in-laws family they when
[36:17] you know Jews when they left the
[36:19] Homeland the country they were God
[36:22] always deals with them in their Homeland
[36:23] and God deals with them as a nation it's
[36:26] not like that for us Gentiles you work
[36:29] out your own salvation with fear and
[36:30] trembling but they left their land and
[36:33] so many times us Gentiles do this for
[36:35] money
[36:37] they left their land for a Better Living
[36:39] because the family came in the Jewish
[36:41] land
[36:42] and they were more concerned about
[36:44] growing corn than they were about
[36:46] growing God
[36:48] the Bible says that there was no thorn
[36:50] in their land
[36:52] and you watch how God dealt with that
[36:55] and God help us brothers because God
[36:59] killed the heads of every one of those
[37:00] families
[37:03] I'll tell you this morning God's in
[37:04] control whether you think he is or not
[37:06] God will take people out of the way
[37:10] God's kingdom will not be hindered our
[37:13] Prophet said Satan will not hinder God's
[37:16] Kingdom
[37:16] and you can think there's somebody
[37:18] trying to block God's kingdom they're
[37:20] either working for God or God will
[37:22] remove them
[37:24] period
[37:25] oh that's a great hope bless praise God
[37:28] and even for you sisters of God forbid
[37:32] that you would marry a loser
[37:34] non-believer amen
[37:39] but if your confession is right
[37:41] in this case God took their
[37:43] unbelieving husbands right out of the
[37:46] way but those two sons because they were
[37:48] in the country of Moab
[37:51] the prophet and we're going to put up
[37:53] quotes here after maybe you can put the
[37:55] first one up Vicky and just leave it up
[37:57] he said that that country was made those
[38:00] people were from the
[38:03] incest
[38:04] of lot and his two daughters
[38:08] amen and so those Sons married girls
[38:11] from that country
[38:13] and you know the story how you know uh
[38:17] Naomi's husband died and
[38:20] and her two sons died and so she
[38:23] was coming back to the country it was
[38:25] barley season
[38:27] and she was going to come back
[38:29] to Jerusalem and she came to her
[38:31] daughters
[38:33] and she said now listen
[38:37] you now we got a quote up here so I'll
[38:39] just read it
[38:42] but in Ruth
[38:44] one and eight Naomi went to her
[38:46] daughter-in-law since she said return
[38:47] each of you to your mother's house and
[38:50] may the Lord deal kindly with you as you
[38:53] have dealt kindly with the Dead
[38:56] and with me
[38:58] now I want to bring you to your
[39:00] attention sometimes us as Christian
[39:02] Believers we have a hard time and we
[39:04] should God help us and God forgive us
[39:07] making our confession
[39:09] the Bible says to make your calling an
[39:11] election sure
[39:13] don't be ashamed of telling you people
[39:15] telling the world whose side you're on
[39:18] if they can't see it then let them know
[39:20] verbally
[39:23] amen
[39:28] here
[39:34] most of the time when we make our con we
[39:36] don't make our confession for Christ
[39:39] it's all because we're ashamed but I
[39:42] want to show you here with Ruth
[39:44] she was she was almost forced or
[39:48] pressured pressured at the very least
[39:50] pressured by the closest person on Earth
[39:53] to her
[39:57] two backslide
[40:00] two returns
[40:02] the closest person on her because she
[40:04] was living in the household of her
[40:06] in-laws and with their son and they're
[40:08] just going through fairness and three
[40:10] times her son mother-in-law comes to her
[40:13] says don't come with me
[40:18] uh-huh
[40:20] three times you know we need to make a
[40:22] stand for Christ
[40:24] and we need to make a clear-cut stand
[40:26] and Christ if you do that will make a
[40:29] stand for you you God ain't safe you
[40:32] know we're living in the the I know
[40:34] we're in the bright age us but the
[40:36] spirit that we're in is a lukewarm age
[40:40] the Bible says that he will that's
[40:42] disgusting to him he'll spew you out of
[40:45] his mouth and what that means is where
[40:47] wishy-washy and there ain't no Believers
[40:50] with the backbone
[40:52] they're politicians whoever they're
[40:54] talking to that's how they talk
[40:57] amen now I don't mean that we as
[41:00] believers
[41:01] need to work out the salvation of
[41:03] somebody else if somebody else disagrees
[41:06] with you on the word of God or on the
[41:08] you know on your personal belief
[41:12] we can still have Fellowship
[41:14] you still go to the grocery store that
[41:16] people that are heathens and you know
[41:20] you can sew a fellowship
[41:22] but for you yourself your confession
[41:25] you don't need to be ashamed of it
[41:28] I'm a Believer and I'm proud of it
[41:31] I don't mean in a wrong way
[41:34] amen
[41:35] but because we're in a generation where
[41:37] we're wishy-washy and we go to work and
[41:40] we look like the world we come to church
[41:42] and we the prophet talked about people
[41:44] like that they sang in the bar on
[41:47] Saturday night and then came and sang in
[41:48] the choir on Sunday morning God don't
[41:50] have a confession for you
[41:53] amen
[41:55] God help us
[41:57] to make our confession
[41:59] stronger
[42:00] than that
[42:02] amen
[42:04] he said let's let's look at the quote
[42:06] here
[42:07] he said
[42:09] he's a high priest
[42:11] he's making he's a high priest and he's
[42:12] sitting there making intercession upon
[42:15] your confession he's not just openly
[42:18] making intercession it's because you're
[42:20] confessing that he's my Lord he's my
[42:24] savior he's my everything
[42:28] and we have to confess it
[42:30] before he can be our high priest
[42:35] so if you wonder why God's not doing
[42:37] what you think in your life
[42:39] maybe you better get a mirror and look
[42:41] and see how much you're confessing
[42:45] amen
[42:46] because he can only intercede look at
[42:48] there the top red line he can only
[42:50] intercede
[42:53] to your confession
[42:56] only to your confession
[42:59] now if you want to be healed this
[43:01] morning or you want your children saved
[43:02] or you want Deliverance or you
[43:05] how much are you confessing God's
[43:07] already done it for you
[43:10] amen
[43:11] Hallelujah see he only intercedes Upon
[43:15] Our confession that's in the blue up
[43:16] there what we confess that he is and
[43:20] he's already has done it for us
[43:23] not that he will do it but that he's
[43:25] already done it we have to confess it
[43:28] that he's done it
[43:31] see we literally put handcuffs on God
[43:35] because
[43:38] it's not because you're being played
[43:42] it's because
[43:43] you're ashamed or you don't believe
[43:47] I can tell you every one of you no
[43:49] matter how polite your plate or shy or
[43:51] backward you are if you really believe
[43:53] in something
[43:54] you'll tell people about it
[43:57] uh-huh
[44:01] but if you're kind of not sure yet
[44:05] or you're ashamed
[44:09] see when you believe in something
[44:12] you don't you're not ashamed number one
[44:14] but you don't care if you're like that
[44:17] amen
[44:19] and that's what God's looking at
[44:21] the world is life that Christ and
[44:23] everything to do with Christians and
[44:25] believers
[44:26] but God's coming back for somebody
[44:28] that's not a shame to call him Lord
[44:32] Hallelujah
[44:35] and here we go back to our scriptures in
[44:37] verse 9 he said the Lord grant that you
[44:39] may rest each in the house of your
[44:41] husbands and she kissed them and they
[44:43] lifted up their voices and they wept
[44:45] and they and they said unto her surely
[44:48] we will return
[44:50] uh with the unto thy people but Naomi's
[44:54] said
[44:56] turn again my daughters
[44:58] see Naomi is pressured him
[45:03] you're not welcome to come with me
[45:07] I know you're not going to be happy with
[45:09] me
[45:10] and she tells them why
[45:16] she says
[45:17] I don't have no more husbands in my room
[45:19] for you
[45:21] and even if I did
[45:25] would you wait for them
[45:28] don't come with me
[45:33] amen
[45:36] pressured
[45:38] by a world of laod sin a world that
[45:42] wants our sisters to look you know if
[45:44] you can't tell which side you're on
[45:46] you need to recalculate your confession
[45:50] if your hairstyle is so much that you
[45:52] could be a
[45:53] Satan worshiper or Jesus worshiper you
[45:57] need to re-change your hairstyle
[46:00] I'm serious
[46:08] I could spell it out planer
[46:11] come on
[46:13] if everything we do you could be in the
[46:17] bar or a concert or you could be in
[46:20] church there's something wrong
[46:23] because the Bible says you're peculiar
[46:26] and that ain't just on what you wear and
[46:28] what you look even your character and
[46:30] the way you carry yourself you won't
[46:33] flaunt yourself no matter how modest you
[46:35] are
[46:37] you're dignified and
[46:39] amen those people that do that have low
[46:43] self-esteem they don't even know who
[46:45] they are
[46:48] amen they're 11 year old or 12 year old
[46:51] and they're trying to find themselves
[46:55] but we found ourselves in Christ
[46:58] amen we don't need to oh come on
[47:06] you know those places I said where we
[47:08] went
[47:09] Beautiful People Mennonite people they
[47:12] haven't got what you got
[47:20] not what the Revelation in the word
[47:24] but I tell you what what they got they
[47:26] sure confess it
[47:31] amen
[47:33] if I was a young single brother and I
[47:35] say this with all due respects
[47:37] I'll tell you what there's hundreds of
[47:39] Mennonite girls that would be more
[47:41] message daughters than daughters in
[47:43] message churches
[47:45] playing with Hollywood and flirting with
[47:47] the world and dressing borderline
[47:50] Believers and
[47:51] I don't want to see your body
[47:54] I don't want to see your
[47:56] that's garbage
[48:00] that's that that's like kindergarten
[48:04] you don't know who you are yet
[48:07] get over it
[48:09] amen
[48:12] and here here Naomi's telling the
[48:15] daughters don't come with me she's she's
[48:17] right on the edge of saying you're not
[48:19] welcome
[48:23] Matt
[48:25] just my daughters will you not go with
[48:27] me he said there's yet no more sons in
[48:29] my wombs
[48:31] and if they would be your husbands would
[48:33] you wait
[48:35] I want to tell you here if you jump down
[48:38] to verse 14 after they uh had Naomi had
[48:44] discouraged them to come and even said
[48:46] don't come
[48:48] this is unbelievable but Naomi is
[48:51] supposed to be a believer
[48:53] and she's telling them there's nothing
[48:55] with me to come after
[48:58] she needed conversion
[49:02] but God's putting this here to show you
[49:05] her confession Ruth's confession
[49:07] straight Heathen straight pagan not a
[49:11] believer
[49:12] straight from the world even a dirty
[49:16] world
[49:17] okay
[49:20] not even close
[49:23] and I want to show you her sister Opie
[49:26] when they lifted up their voices and
[49:27] wept again and Opie kissed her
[49:29] mother-in-law
[49:30] but Ruth played to her mother-in-law do
[49:33] you want me to tell you something this
[49:34] is well be
[49:36] for those people that are
[49:38] have no confession
[49:40] is Opie
[49:42] stayed with Satan
[49:45] and the world
[49:48] and her name
[49:50] is never mentioned
[49:53] again
[49:58] God forgive me for saying this but
[50:00] there's people that are cannon fodder
[50:03] and the kingdom of God
[50:06] that
[50:08] they're they're not in they're not a
[50:10] part of the gene of God
[50:13] man
[50:14] that never can be
[50:17] but here's somebody that that that you
[50:20] would say is not a part of the gene of
[50:22] God that's where it's so beautiful to
[50:24] see that even in their even in their
[50:27] Earthly lineage and they're dirty pass
[50:32] God's blood paid the price for All sin
[50:37] hey man
[50:39] Hallelujah you you didn't ask to come to
[50:42] this world if you came to this world and
[50:45] and I don't believe anybody did here but
[50:47] if you came to this world from rape
[50:49] incest
[50:51] any evil sin
[50:54] I want to show you a new doctrine
[50:57] you know in the Old Testament you
[50:59] couldn't come into the Tabernacle
[51:02] for I believe it was 40 Generations
[51:06] it was it was like
[51:09] indefinite
[51:11] I think it was 40 Generations
[51:14] but that is under the law
[51:18] we are not under the law to say that a
[51:21] person couldn't be saved under well
[51:23] number one you you'd have to take Ruth
[51:25] out number one and number two it's to
[51:28] say well Jesus Christ's blood paid the
[51:31] price for all the sin except the people
[51:33] born in adultery
[51:36] or he paid the price for all the sin
[51:38] except and I'm not justifying it my
[51:41] goodness
[51:43] but Jesus Christ's blood was perfect
[51:45] enough and powerful enough to save
[51:47] everybody except those born in incest
[51:52] no his blood covered all sin
[51:56] it wasn't those kids faults
[51:59] amen
[52:04] they could be a part of the Bride the
[52:06] same as that amen let's go to what the
[52:10] word of God says we're not saved on our
[52:12] merits
[52:14] we're saved on Amazing Grace
[52:19] oh Hallelujah
[52:21] so Opie
[52:23] left her mother kissed her mother-in-law
[52:25] and said I am happy living in laodicea
[52:29] I agree that there's nothing that you
[52:31] can give me and I'll go back to my
[52:34] family and I'll keep dressing the way I
[52:36] dress
[52:37] and I'll keep there was nothing there
[52:40] for Opie to come forward but we see in
[52:44] verse 14 at the end of that the Ruth
[52:46] clave
[52:48] to her and she said behold thy so here's
[52:51] Naomi she says Behold thy sister-in-law
[52:53] is gone unto her people and on to her
[52:57] Gods small G
[53:00] return now after thy sister-in-law now
[53:04] there's the second time at least that
[53:06] Naomi's pressured strongly pressured
[53:10] Ruth don't come with me
[53:20] and here's a powerful confession Ruth
[53:23] made we as Believers need to
[53:27] broaden our shoulders now I don't mean
[53:30] in an arrogant way
[53:32] not at all God God's coming for humble
[53:34] believers
[53:35] but this is what Ruth said she said
[53:38] Retreat me not
[53:42] don't even talk to me about this
[53:45] my decision is final
[53:50] she said in verse 16 Ruth said retrieve
[53:53] me not
[53:55] to leave thee nor return to follow after
[53:58] thee for whether thou goest I'm going
[54:02] we don't need to talk about this no more
[54:07] and where thou lodges I'm lodging
[54:10] and where thy people shall be
[54:14] I shall be
[54:15] I was a clear-cut
[54:18] decision
[54:20] and thy God
[54:24] here's a
[54:27] illegitimate
[54:28] sinner
[54:32] but she saved on her confession
[54:35] and she said undy God
[54:37] will be my God and don't talk to me no
[54:39] more about it
[54:42] amen
[54:44] you know too many of us Believers
[54:46] especially if you haven't got the Holy
[54:48] Ghost
[54:49] you you can have two husbands
[54:52] you cannot be flirting with the world
[54:55] you can't be married engaged to one in
[54:58] court in another
[55:01] it won't it won't fly
[55:03] and the only person will be unhappy is
[55:06] you
[55:08] amen
[55:11] Ruth continued to go on not she didn't
[55:14] stop at where thou goest and where thou
[55:16] lodges and where thy people are you know
[55:18] I believe with all my heart that Naomi
[55:20] thought
[55:21] watch this
[55:23] and to some degree they did
[55:25] Naomi thought that they would reject
[55:27] Ruth because of
[55:30] she wasn't Jew
[55:32] and it says when they come back to the
[55:33] country they all circled around and
[55:35] wanted to know all about them and and
[55:37] you know we know that BOA is redeemed
[55:40] Ruth but you know the kinsman redeemer
[55:42] he refused to redeem her
[55:44] uh-huh
[55:47] oh it's beautiful
[55:49] amen but Ruth continues in verse 17 she
[55:52] says where thou dias
[55:54] I'm gonna die
[55:56] and there will I will be buried and the
[55:59] Lord do so unto me and even more
[56:03] if at Death part thee in me
[56:07] here's Ruth saying she said God if I
[56:10] change my confession
[56:13] if I change my confession and my
[56:16] confession changes before I die
[56:19] God you're free to take
[56:22] whoa
[56:25] you know all those people that left the
[56:27] trace
[56:29] they never had this confession
[56:34] because they were in message churches
[56:36] for some 10 some 20 some 30 some 40
[56:39] years
[56:40] and they just walked right out
[56:46] because of confession
[56:49] was not sound
[56:52] amen
[56:55] God help us and when Naomi's seen
[57:01] that Ruth was steadfastly minded to go
[57:03] with her this is 18. when she finally
[57:06] realizes
[57:08] that nothing she could say
[57:10] would make her backslife
[57:16] you know the world would be the same way
[57:20] even the people
[57:22] that will not be converted when they
[57:24] realize
[57:25] that you're confession you don't think
[57:27] so I went to high school with with
[57:29] Holiness girls that they had long hair
[57:32] and they put their hair up in a bun and
[57:33] the whole high school called them the
[57:34] bun heads
[57:37] there were a beautiful full dress and
[57:39] had the bun head they were known by the
[57:40] Bunheads that wasn't a slam at all
[57:43] it's because they're confession
[57:45] was solid
[57:47] you can teach me all you want I'm
[57:49] wearing a dress and I have abundant hair
[57:54] and I don't have a problem with you call
[57:56] me a bunhead
[57:59] because it ain't going to change my
[58:00] confession
[58:02] amen
[58:04] that's where you need to be
[58:06] with Christ Christ ain't marrying some
[58:08] wishy-washy
[58:11] amen this this marriage is For Better or
[58:15] Worse
[58:17] but with Christ it's always better
[58:19] but it's in there to see what your
[58:21] decision will be what's your confession
[58:24] if you have a hard time
[58:26] are you going to flee The Coop and go
[58:28] where the corn is better
[58:30] are you going to be like lot and you're
[58:32] going to pick where you're just
[58:33] concerned you're only concerned about
[58:35] your bank account
[58:38] I'm going to pick the best planes you
[58:40] know you know the one Minister mentioned
[58:42] this in the convention but said you know
[58:44] a lot never ever planned on going this
[58:46] Auto was never ever Lots planned
[58:49] and every make-believer that walks out
[58:52] of this truth the message
[58:54] they never planned on doing that
[58:56] never not not for one minute
[59:01] you watch how slow lot's progress was to
[59:05] sin
[59:07] what he just picked the grassier plane
[59:10] now that's not sin
[59:12] and he just lived in a tent
[59:15] that you could see Sodom well he wasn't
[59:17] in it
[59:19] but then he realized that he could get a
[59:22] nicer house inside
[59:24] and the tent floor was damped
[59:27] well well that's not sin
[59:31] but then he realized when he had a nice
[59:33] house he was popular so he could become
[59:35] the mayor
[59:37] oh
[59:40] and now you're
[59:43] huh
[59:45] and then but becomes when you're the
[59:46] mayor and then God said hey you got to
[59:48] leave this place because I'm going to
[59:49] destroy but he said but God I can't
[59:51] leave the place because I'm the mayor
[59:54] uh-huh
[59:56] it's a lot never ever planned on getting
[59:58] to that situation
[59:59] it was a very slow and that's what's
[1:00:02] happened in a lot of the young people in
[1:00:04] our church and our confession
[1:00:07] that's why you'll see
[1:00:09] things that you do your grandparents
[1:00:11] would never have done
[1:00:14] it's because you didn't plan on going to
[1:00:18] Sodom
[1:00:19] but you just picked the green grass
[1:00:21] and then it went from the tent to the
[1:00:23] house and then I went from the house to
[1:00:25] the
[1:00:27] politics
[1:00:29] and then when God came to save you it's
[1:00:31] like man
[1:00:33] I don't think yeah does it work
[1:00:37] the Bible says that the angels
[1:00:40] physically restrained his arm
[1:00:43] to remove now now I would say lot didn't
[1:00:46] have a very strong confession
[1:00:49] um
[1:00:53] and his wife's still in a pillar assault
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:59] God help us amen
[1:01:01] here Naomi said he said when I seeing
[1:01:03] that ruse was steadfastly minded
[1:01:07] and she was going with her then she said
[1:01:09] then and only then die Naomi
[1:01:13] let off
[1:01:15] and left
[1:01:16] her speaking
[1:01:19] God help us
[1:01:21] God help us to have a confession
[1:01:24] that God's proud of let's go to our
[1:01:26] second picture
[1:01:27] Amy
[1:01:32] here's here's our or one scripture we
[1:01:35] read here we have to confess he was
[1:01:38] wounded for our transgressions by his
[1:01:39] stripes we're yield he said Jesus of
[1:01:41] Hebrews 3 1 is he's the high priest of
[1:01:45] our confession
[1:01:48] so if you don't have a confession then
[1:01:50] he's not even your high priest
[1:01:54] amen and now any of you Scholars will
[1:01:56] know that the Bible says profession
[1:02:00] and here's the prophet breaking this
[1:02:01] down so you can understand
[1:02:04] he said any of you Scholars know the
[1:02:05] profession is translated the same as
[1:02:08] confession
[1:02:10] so God is the high priest of our
[1:02:13] confession
[1:02:14] you have not because you asked not
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:21] all you have to do if you're sick
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:25] let's just say hey God I know you've
[1:02:26] already healed me
[1:02:28] take care of it
[1:02:30] like the brother said it was so
[1:02:33] beautiful like it was actually brother
[1:02:35] Andre said when he was over there doing
[1:02:36] the print press and the people came and
[1:02:38] got him a bill and brother Andre he
[1:02:40] wasn't it was it was just beautiful
[1:02:42] blessed my heart he said
[1:02:45] he just prayed and said God you have a
[1:02:48] problem you have a bill to pay
[1:02:50] it wasn't brother Andre's problem
[1:02:52] brother Andre didn't need to print stuff
[1:02:55] amen if God didn't want to print it then
[1:02:57] he wouldn't pay the bill
[1:02:59] amen see if you get in that that vein so
[1:03:02] much God will take care of everything
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] you're not you're not living for
[1:03:07] yourself you're living for Christ the
[1:03:08] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:03:10] of the Lord all your confessions
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:16] you notice just the Highlight at the
[1:03:18] bottom you dropped there he said now
[1:03:19] notice he's the high priest of your
[1:03:21] confession
[1:03:22] and he says you get it you get what I
[1:03:25] mean he said what you confess you are
[1:03:27] that's what you are any man will never
[1:03:30] live any farther or any higher
[1:03:33] than he believes
[1:03:36] God help us
[1:03:41] let's go to the second uh
[1:03:44] one here
[1:03:50] he said if you go in there paragraph 35
[1:03:54] he said when the inspiration of the holy
[1:03:56] spirit will inspire you he said remember
[1:03:58] God will make your body come to your
[1:04:01] confession
[1:04:02] God I'm Healed God I'm saved God my kids
[1:04:08] are saved
[1:04:10] bury it
[1:04:12] you said my kids are my heritage
[1:04:15] if you have faith for yourself and your
[1:04:17] household
[1:04:20] confess that
[1:04:22] it'll be taken care of
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:28] he said if you say that you're a drunker
[1:04:30] and you want to drink he said don't
[1:04:32] worry
[1:04:33] he said you soon will be drinking
[1:04:37] if you confess that you want a new
[1:04:39] vehicle
[1:04:41] and you go looking at new vehicles don't
[1:04:43] worry
[1:04:45] you'll soon only
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:52] but that's the same spiritually
[1:04:55] if you confess it say I'm going to be in
[1:04:58] church on Sunday period
[1:05:00] don't worry you'll be there
[1:05:04] believe you say
[1:05:09] all in your confession
[1:05:12] God help us
[1:05:14] you drop to the bottom highlight there
[1:05:16] he said confess it and God will make
[1:05:18] your body obey your confession
[1:05:22] that's powerful
[1:05:25] it's powerful say God my bills are taken
[1:05:28] care of
[1:05:30] now he'll know if you're in his will
[1:05:33] there's a few other things you have to
[1:05:35] do
[1:05:38] amen it's so simple
[1:05:43] but we don't confess it because we're
[1:05:45] not sure he's God
[1:05:47] well like this I think you know how big
[1:05:49] is your god
[1:05:54] God help us
[1:05:55] for he's a high priest of your
[1:05:56] confession sitting at the right hand of
[1:05:58] the father now in his own blood make an
[1:06:01] intercession for any confession upon
[1:06:04] anything that he died for
[1:06:07] oh Hallelujah
[1:06:10] let's go to the last quote here
[1:06:13] is this is is that beautiful
[1:06:16] God Amen I'm just just like spiritually
[1:06:20] I'm married Christ is my husband he's
[1:06:24] taking care of all my needs you know in
[1:06:26] the family of God you don't have to have
[1:06:28] a double income
[1:06:30] he just takes care of everything
[1:06:34] serious I'm not I'm saying I'm not
[1:06:36] saying double income is wrong I'm just
[1:06:38] saying just picture it spiritually
[1:06:40] you don't have to worry
[1:06:42] ain't for believers
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:48] I'm preaching to myself that'll be the
[1:06:50] case with going to Uganda you know the
[1:06:52] prophet said he said anytime you go to
[1:06:55] do a work for God or go to the mission
[1:06:56] field I don't really consider you've
[1:06:58] gone to the mission field it could be
[1:06:59] Ontario be the mission field
[1:07:01] he said you're always in the will of God
[1:07:04] I had a non-believer tell me he said
[1:07:07] just watch how you can fetch this
[1:07:11] he says what if you get to Uganda
[1:07:13] the world goes to war and you can't come
[1:07:15] home
[1:07:21] look
[1:07:23] would that be a problem
[1:07:25] it'd be a problem for youth here
[1:07:28] but you see
[1:07:30] you see how doubt comes in
[1:07:32] amen if you're in the will of God does
[1:07:34] it matter if you're in Uganda when the
[1:07:36] bomb's hit or in Ontario when the Bob
[1:07:38] said you'd probably be safer there
[1:07:42] but he said oh oh well maybe I better do
[1:07:44] something myself
[1:07:46] well the Bible didn't say you had to do
[1:07:48] nothing of yourself except confess them
[1:07:50] amen remember here look at right at the
[1:07:52] top here he said remember he can never
[1:07:55] do nothing for you now that's pretty
[1:07:58] straightforward
[1:08:00] until first you say he's already done it
[1:08:07] you say
[1:08:08] some people would come in they say well
[1:08:11] I unfriend those people
[1:08:13] I've seen it something connected in the
[1:08:16] message they said well all the message
[1:08:17] churches are dead and there's no power
[1:08:19] of the Holy Spirit now I just blocked
[1:08:21] them
[1:08:23] number one it's on true
[1:08:25] number two it's negative
[1:08:28] amen
[1:08:34] start confession
[1:08:35] believe in him and accept it
[1:08:38] and testify of it
[1:08:41] amen he's a high priest of our what our
[1:08:44] confession Hebrews 3 1. he's sitting at
[1:08:47] the right hand of the father make an
[1:08:49] intercession for our confession
[1:08:51] Jesus said whatsoever things ye desire
[1:08:55] you just oh my
[1:08:57] could you think of anything that you
[1:08:59] would desire I can think of a few
[1:09:05] even spiritually
[1:09:08] When you pray believe you receive them
[1:09:11] and it shall be given to you is that
[1:09:13] right
[1:09:15] oh wow
[1:09:16] but believing that those things that you
[1:09:19] say shall come to pass and you'll have
[1:09:22] it
[1:09:24] oh that's beautiful
[1:09:27] that's where Ruth you know back to Ruth
[1:09:30] we'll see and we're going to close here
[1:09:32] in a moment Ruth had three parks
[1:09:35] to her serving God
[1:09:39] and I like the first one most of all
[1:09:42] was your decision
[1:09:45] we're living in a world with no
[1:09:47] commitment
[1:09:49] no no no I might work here maybe I won't
[1:09:52] work here I don't think I will and or
[1:09:55] you know maybe I'll get married well
[1:09:56] maybe I don't think I will
[1:09:59] that's why people just shack up the only
[1:10:01] difference between sacked up and married
[1:10:03] besides sin is commitment
[1:10:07] it's commitment there's no different
[1:10:09] other than it's sin but it's a
[1:10:11] commitment there's a world is spineless
[1:10:14] you know well maybe I'll be a Christian
[1:10:16] today but well I don't think we're going
[1:10:17] to get bombed so I don't think I'll
[1:10:18] serve God because I got more time
[1:10:22] so you're no commitment
[1:10:24] no commitment
[1:10:28] amen first part of Roost this uh stage
[1:10:32] here the prophet said in Revelations the
[1:10:34] message Revelations he said she had
[1:10:36] three stages what's Ruth was deciding
[1:10:39] serving and resting
[1:10:43] and we're to the stage right now
[1:10:46] where we should be resting on what God's
[1:10:48] doing for us
[1:10:49] amen once you decide once you're married
[1:10:52] to Christ
[1:10:53] and you've done served
[1:10:55] and you're in the the you're the queen
[1:10:58] of the house
[1:11:00] it it's what's left is up to Christ amen
[1:11:03] we're done with the quotes Amy
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:07] we're in a wrestling party you don't
[1:11:08] have to be you don't have to be stirred
[1:11:11] up here the prophet said just just some
[1:11:13] information here he said you know Naomi
[1:11:16] type
[1:11:18] the Orthodox Church
[1:11:21] and Opie take the lukewarm Gentile
[1:11:24] Church
[1:11:25] but Ruth
[1:11:27] taped the bright Church
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:31] and all those other churches are going
[1:11:33] to try to get you to make a decision
[1:11:36] Naomi and Opie both tried to get Ruth to
[1:11:40] make a different decision you mean
[1:11:42] you're not going to come with me your
[1:11:44] sister-in-law
[1:11:47] I thought we were friends
[1:11:51] our husbands were brothers
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:56] we've all heard families say stuff like
[1:11:58] that you mean you're going to miss
[1:12:00] turkey dinner
[1:12:01] don't you know that you could miss
[1:12:04] church just this one time for
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:11] God help us
[1:12:16] remember she was excommunicated never
[1:12:18] mentioned again
[1:12:20] because of her decision
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:28] help us Jesus
[1:12:33] you know the prophet says here he says I
[1:12:36] like Ruth's decision
[1:12:38] of how she said and she said you know
[1:12:40] every one of you
[1:12:42] are going to be affected by the decision
[1:12:45] you make
[1:12:46] this morning when you hear this message
[1:12:48] you will not leave the same
[1:12:51] you will leave better
[1:12:53] or worse
[1:12:54] you will leave a changed person one way
[1:12:57] or the other you will be closer to God
[1:12:59] or you will be farther from God even
[1:13:02] though you think you make a decision
[1:13:04] that is not
[1:13:07] committed
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:11] your decision of non-commitment is to
[1:13:14] move away from God
[1:13:16] he said well I'm right in the fence
[1:13:17] there's no such thing as riding the
[1:13:19] fence if you're right in the fence
[1:13:20] you're already on the other side
[1:13:23] amen nobody rides a fence and falls on
[1:13:26] the side of Christ
[1:13:29] man
[1:13:31] if you're riding the fence
[1:13:36] it was in the message what has the Holy
[1:13:39] Ghost given for
[1:13:40] that the prophet said that the moabites
[1:13:44] came from the daughters and lot
[1:13:48] unbelievers
[1:13:50] in incest
[1:13:52] but God could still bring out bride
[1:13:55] God help us let's read that last
[1:13:57] scripture that we had
[1:13:59] uh oh maybe it is up there Mark 38 or
[1:14:03] yep that's it 8 38. I love this
[1:14:06] scripture this is so much your
[1:14:08] confession if you're going to make a
[1:14:10] confession out in the world
[1:14:13] you will be pushed you will it will be
[1:14:16] just like Ruth you'll be pushed until
[1:14:19] they realize
[1:14:21] they can't push you off
[1:14:23] and you'll be left alone
[1:14:26] you know I remember when my this is
[1:14:28] years back when I was 10 or 12 just a
[1:14:31] young teenager and my brother's older
[1:14:33] brothers and you know of course we know
[1:14:36] that that the Sabbath is our Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] I know we know that our Prophet told us
[1:14:43] that it's not a day we know that
[1:14:46] our Prophet did tell us though to
[1:14:49] respect the day of Resurrection
[1:14:51] amen it's not law
[1:14:54] but he said he said to miss church to go
[1:14:57] fishing or go driving in the country was
[1:14:58] a sin
[1:15:00] now if you come to church and then you
[1:15:01] go fishing after it's not a sin
[1:15:04] he said show respects
[1:15:06] to the resurrection thing but you know
[1:15:09] I'm talking about how far people will
[1:15:11] push and you see how far Naomi pushed I
[1:15:14] remember in the when uh
[1:15:16] Trudeau's dad was in the country and
[1:15:19] inflation come in just like it did then
[1:15:21] there's nothing new Under the heavens
[1:15:22] what's happening right now to the world
[1:15:24] it happened before when I was 10. it was
[1:15:27] just Trudeau's dad
[1:15:29] interest went to 24 22 percent
[1:15:32] inflation was at 10 or 12 percent and
[1:15:35] people never had enough money to go
[1:15:36] around
[1:15:37] and my brother's got a job working shift
[1:15:40] work in Wallaceburg in the factory and
[1:15:42] you think this is a little thing but it
[1:15:45] showed how God will stand behind your
[1:15:48] confession and so you're not you're not
[1:15:50] in the union or you're not locked in
[1:15:52] until you have your three months of
[1:15:54] probation
[1:15:55] and for them to go to work on the
[1:15:57] midnight shift they had to go in at 11
[1:15:59] 30 on Sunday night
[1:16:01] but they didn't believe on working on
[1:16:03] Sunday
[1:16:04] is that was their confession I
[1:16:06] understand that confession was under the
[1:16:07] law
[1:16:08] and we're not under the law but that's
[1:16:11] what they knew
[1:16:14] see if you know to do right
[1:16:19] it's iniquity
[1:16:21] there's no forgiveness for that
[1:16:23] so message Believers you know the truth
[1:16:30] you know what the Revelation is you know
[1:16:33] what the Mysteries are revealed and to
[1:16:36] to not do that there's no forgiveness
[1:16:38] for it
[1:16:39] because you know to do right and you're
[1:16:41] intentionally premeditated first degree
[1:16:44] murder
[1:16:45] to Christ
[1:16:47] and they told their boss no what I I
[1:16:50] told you that story because they
[1:16:52] desperately needed the job
[1:16:55] they're paying like 22 percent interest
[1:16:57] on their farms and
[1:16:59] I mean they were people left and right
[1:17:02] lost their farms in that time
[1:17:05] houses whatever I mean
[1:17:08] you weren't born yet or you were awful
[1:17:11] Young
[1:17:12] sister Patty will remember
[1:17:14] I I just Patricia I certainly remember I
[1:17:17] remember stories that happened to my dad
[1:17:20] wow
[1:17:23] and they went to their boss
[1:17:27] they told them
[1:17:28] we don't believe unworking on the
[1:17:30] Sabbath
[1:17:31] we desperately want the job
[1:17:34] we'll be into work at 12 o'clock
[1:17:37] and he would ask them after that if they
[1:17:39] would work the midnight shift and my
[1:17:41] brothers would always say no
[1:17:43] and he said don't worry about it
[1:17:45] he said I know why you're saying no
[1:17:47] you're saying no because you don't want
[1:17:49] to come in a half an hour late
[1:17:51] he said I got you covered don't worry
[1:17:53] about it
[1:17:56] you see it was your confession
[1:17:59] the world's dying for a people
[1:18:02] that'll have a belief and stick to it
[1:18:05] regardless
[1:18:07] no greater love than any man
[1:18:10] then he'll lay down his life
[1:18:13] for his confession
[1:18:15] his brother
[1:18:16] his confession
[1:18:18] the world's got lots of cheap imitation
[1:18:20] wishy-washy
[1:18:23] you can get them anywhere
[1:18:27] they're called harlots or prostitutes
[1:18:31] if you want somebody with character
[1:18:33] says I won't go that far
[1:18:36] because I have a confession in Jesus
[1:18:39] Christ
[1:18:40] the world will never push you off
[1:18:43] they'll go wow
[1:18:45] now there's a real daughter
[1:18:47] or a man
[1:18:49] even if they're wrong
[1:18:51] even though we know that we're not under
[1:18:53] the law of the Sabbath day
[1:18:56] to them
[1:18:58] it was wrong
[1:19:00] and their confession was
[1:19:03] I won't go that far
[1:19:05] even if I lose my job but you'll mean I
[1:19:07] lose my house or am I fine
[1:19:10] and God see God
[1:19:13] will change the heart of a king
[1:19:15] and he'll stand because he's he's
[1:19:17] already making intercession for what he
[1:19:20] knows your confession will be

[1:26:15] that scripture means that our confession
[1:26:18] can't change
[1:26:20] from what your Bible says
[1:26:23] because of our confession changes
[1:26:26] and you never changed our confession is
[1:26:28] none and void
[1:26:30] like our Prophet said Lord Jesus and
[1:26:32] many times if you had a confession and
[1:26:35] denominational Creeds or
[1:26:37] or false things science
[1:26:41] that confession
[1:26:43] was worthless
[1:26:46] but because you're the same yesterday
[1:26:48] today and forever
[1:26:51] our confession will be the same as when
[1:26:53] you were here on Earth
[1:26:55] our confession will be the same when our
[1:26:57] Prophet was here
[1:27:00] there will be no wavering
[1:27:03] and no lessening of our confession
[1:27:06] because
[1:27:08] of the age when Satan has come in so
[1:27:12] strongly because of the age the only age
[1:27:15] from Christ where you were on the
[1:27:17] outside of your church
[1:27:19] and you were asking to come back in
[1:27:22] but nobody was answering the door
