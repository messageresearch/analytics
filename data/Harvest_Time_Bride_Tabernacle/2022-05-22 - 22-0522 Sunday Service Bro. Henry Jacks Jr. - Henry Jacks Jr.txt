don't know if anybody of these know this this week if you're following history i i can't keep my uh i just can't keep away from it because it you know we live in the most exciting time ever our prophet told us that all the other prophets of the other age would have picked today even when jesus was here present russia was shooting missiles at israel plains friday friday from syria now our prophet said that when russia came down for the oil that we wouldn't be here they've been in syria but friday was the first day that they shot russian missiles at israelite plains friday wow just wow amen and we just got a rapture to look forward to it's just it's just unbelievable we're just walking right off the pages of the bible literally it's bright it's just it's just it's like it's like jesus the lord toward paul in the road like last sunday you're jesus i'm jesus who you persecute and it was it was you jesus wasn't on the earth it was his bride and the lord called you jesus today it's jesus ministry on the earth you wow amen did anybody know that russia shot mr sister patty amanda amen it's just beautiful shot missiles at israel plains friday amen we're very close we won't be here long we will not be here long right this is pastor leo's church and we are on the wrap-up stage so we've had uh we've actually had a a couple brothers that have have sent designated money to the church um and we've also been able to take some church money and send you know to support leo's church and so we are in the wrap-up wrap-up stage of of uh what god's doing there amen and if god tarries this will be a you know pastor leo on a regular monthly basis you know i mean it's different every time but it's not unusual for him to baptize 20 souls a month a month a month we go to the next picture another picture next one this is oh this is a baptismal tank um there was a brother in uh i'm not sure where the same brother that actually paid for the foundation bought the property and paid for the foundation of his church paid for those steps and the baptismal tank amen it's very beautiful that is this kind of steel that is going on the roof and i believe there's a you can just leave that picture up now is that not beautiful amen god that's god amen that's god's work so the steel will be delivered and i believe we're within a thousand bucks or something like that canadian of finishing the roof on that building right there that's god's grace amen an amazing way now you know a few months back and not i don't change this but this just it was dealing with this this morning you know a few months back we preached on false prophets amen and brother tim anders was here you know that was about a month or so ago six weeks ago and a minister brought tim anders by his church and he was so jealous of leo's church that he wouldn't get out of the vehicle or see the church that's in this bride false prophets the bridegread full of them grateful you don't take my word for it you listen to moses abraham from uganda when he gave his testimony in ohio he wouldn't name the ministers because he said you have all kinds of ministers coming from africa here the only reason they're in the message he knew him by name and he had a hugely vindicated ministry if you ever listen to his message or his testimony it'll be the closest testimony you've ever heard to the prophet's life he had his own mom and dad tried to kill him multiple times amen ain't that sad it's sad and glad at the same time just said glad man you can't stop what god's doing you cannot stop what god's doing even though some would try to not sing that song it will be worth it all just as our brother henry comes man just looking forward to him you know he messaged me yesterday and said that he had lost his ride and and man you know we haven't had him preach this year and he's preached for us three to multiple times three different past years and i said oh brother man you you need a ride you need a ride you need a ride just looking forward to him it'll be a wonderful amen just that god will use our brother amen amen [Music] can you go a little bit lower you're in the treetops [Music] it will be worth when we see jesus life's tribes will seem so small when we see christ one glance of his face us are a really race slow bravely run the race [Music] when we [Music] boys [Music]

conquerors let me tell you you know when jesus said to peter upon this rock will i build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against us hallelujah hold glory to god it cannot prevail

with him hallelujah one day one day soon we're going to leave this place but for the time being for the time being let us keep fighting on as the words that fight the good fight of fate all right let us turn our bibles to the book of ephesians chapter four we're going to read a scripture and you then you can be seated the ephesians chapter 4 we're going to read from verse 11 to 13. i just want to take a simple thought today and the thought is hallelujah the unity unity of the fate hallelujah you know that taught me not so much but it's a sympathetic unity of the fate hallelujah and i believe that the holy ghost in this season is moving in that realm in that dimension is dealing with faith with faith the word of god said without faith in the book of hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 without faith it is impossible to please god hallelujah jesus said in luke 18 verse 8 when the son of man come again will he find fate on the hurt hallelujah praise god ephesians chapter 4 from verse 11 and he gave listen e christ hallelujah and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers verse 12 no this is a purpose why he gave them verse 12 for for the perfecting for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry look at it now streams for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till till we all come so there is a place that we must come to hallelujah till we all come in the unity of the faith notice he never said until you come in a faith no he said in the unity of the fate are we going to look are we going to look what is defeated this morning hallelujah and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man and to the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ you can be seated hallelujah you can be seated let us you know as your bowel heads let's approach the the hotter and finish of our faith divine father lord we thank you this morning lord for joining mercy as we come this morning father lord god we thank you for your presence lord father your spirit is here in this place lord and father as we come lord we pray father that your holy spirit father may litter a soul and fire this morning lord in the name of jesus and father may you bless the words this morning father may you open up the word to our heart this morning in the name of jesus lord and father i pray lord god hallelujah that your words may become alive to us father let us see our self-father in the word father in the name of jesus lord may you take control of the service lord god may you lean and they wreck us father may you lead us into the realm that you want us to go farther in the direction that you want us to go this morning father as i stand before your people this morning may you hide me behind your word father in the name of jesus lord god and father let your people hear your voice lord and not a man voice but your voice father because your voice makes the difference father in the name of jesus lord we ask all these things lord may you come and grant it lord in the name of jesus hallelujah and all those that are listening father hallelujah lord may extend lord god your visitation to them in the name of jesus oh glory thank you jesus yes lord hallelujah thank you jesus glory to god in jesus name we pray amen what a day we're in hallelujah you see that the lord many people today this age and time that we're in they have missed the visitation of the lord they have missed glory to god they have misappearing and here brother paul hallelujah in the book of ephesians chapter 4 as he wrote this letter to the ephesian church as he said you know he gave some christ some hallelujah apostles some prophets teachers but he called in verse in verse seven in verse eight if you you if you can back up to verse eight he said wherefore he said when he hallelujah when he ascended up and i let captivity kept him and gave gifts unto men so we noticed that these hallelujah that the bible said pastors prophets cheers evangelist these are considered gifts it is called gifts hallelujah so the pastor is a gift the teacher is a gift the prophet is a gift the evangelist is a gift hallelujah and these are given hallelujah to the body of christ because god upset these gifts in the body hallelujah to perfect the saints and the word perfect means to complete hallelujah you must be completed and he giving and he gave the gifts to the body to complete hallelujah oh god the bible said for the perfecting of the saints who are the saints those that are the sanctified ones by christ jesus said is saying john 17 verse 17 father sanctify them through thy word because that word is truth hallelujah amen glory to god and the word sanctified means to set aside hallelujah to set aside because he wants to come hallelujah and use you for his purpose oh praise the lord the bible said hallelujah in genesis chapter 2 verse 1 and all sanctify the seventh day for in hit he had rested hallelujah in it many people believe the seventh day today hallelujah is a sunday can you go in a sunday listen what the word said in it in heat he had rested you don't go hallelujah you don't go to a church in a sunday you go on a sunday or during a sunday but the word of god said for in it in what in the image hallelujah in the image he rested he stepped in that image hallelujah and he rested in that image oh hallelujah oh glory no wonder why hallelujah no wonder why the bible says when jesus came he said i must finish the work of the father i must finish the work hallelujah god eternal being the elohim hallelujah he started a work in the beginning and that work was creation work that's what the bible said he made heaven and hurt in the six days and he rested he hindered his work but that work was creation work oh praise god it was creation work but there's another work hallelujah to complete this other work to do that's why when gossip in that image called adam hallelujah adam was supposed to continue the work hallelujah no wonder why when the bible said god brought the animals to adam to see what adam would name them that was a work hallelujah and whatever had them named them it was saul john chapter 4 verse 34 jesus said my meat my need is to do the will of my father that has sent me and and to finish his work oh praise god i told her the work was finished what work the creation work is finished [Laughter] but there's a work of god hallelujah that has to continue oh praise god he said to finish his work my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work we see today many people get so complacent they said oh i want to go into the rapture i want to go home i'm tired of this world can i say this to you once you're predestinated for the rupture you cannot leave the scene until you finish the work hallelujah can i continue you better put on your seatbelt oh praise god in order for you to leave the scene you have to finish the work jesus couldn't leave the scene until he finished the work hallelujah in saint john 17 verse 5 he said my hour is come hallelujah and i have finished the work that's why jesus could leave before hallelujah before the work was finished he could not leave the scene even when hallelujah peter said master if you're going to jerusalem they're going to kill you they could not kill him because the work wasn't finished what is the work the work is the revealing the character of god the work is to reveal the attribute of god all that was in god was in christ jesus hallelujah oh praise god and god wanted to reveal himself to the world god wants to express himself to the world hallelujah that's why he stepped him he stepped into a body called jesus to express himself and jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily hallelujah oh praise god it was the fullness of the godhead bodily no wonder why hallelujah when the prophet isaiah said and his name shall be called emmanuel meaning god with us hallelujah god with us hallelujah when jesus was walking he was not just a literal man he was god with his people hallelujah his name was called emmanuel mean god with us and the word of god said hallelujah he gave gifts unto men for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministries to work again for the work of the ministry because the work has to finish the work has to continue because god the bible said god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself and the word reconciled means to restore hallelujah because hallelujah man had fallen hallelujah from the grace of god no matter what brother paul said all that i've seen and come short of the glory of god hallelujah so when christ came on the scene great was god bringing back men back to himself hallelujah reconciling the world unto himself oh praise god but when jesus leave the sea now hallelujah that was jesus work hallelujah and now the bible said in section 14 either believe it in me and believe in the works that i do even greater works than these you shall do amen the paul said we have we have the word we have the word of reconciliation we have the ministry of reconciliation oh jesus hallelujah look at this woman jesus said i must have needs pass through samaria i must have needs hallelujah he has to re he has to reconcile because he has that ministry but there was something inside of him that was pulling him hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah in those days the jews and the samaritan has no dealing hallelujah but the work of god must continue the work of god must accomplish hallelujah accomplish to give god the glory hallelujah and jesus said i must have needs to go to samaria oh praise god the disciples could not understand they didn't understand the plan of god they didn't understand the work of god hallelujah they thought that the work was just only given to the jews hallelujah but jesus said i must have needs and he said you know what go to the village go buy meat oh praise god and the bible said when he went to the well there was this woman hallelujah at the world that come to draw water you know what she was a doctor of abraham hallelujah oh praise god jesus saw her in the beginning hallelujah he saw that predestinated seed from the beginning that's why i said i must have needs to go to summer here hallelujah he said the son cannot do nothing of himself but while they see the father do it the son do it likewise so he was being led it was the father that was showing him all those that belong to him hallelujah i tell you when you belong to god god shall come on the scene for you and he's come personal oh my mama you may not experience he may not whether he expect him to come hallelujah but he come when adam was falling when adam fell the bible said the voice of god he walketh in the cool of the garden hallelujah so is it today in this eden it's the voice of god that is walking again hallelujah but this time he's walking in our body hallelujah he's working on our body till we all come in the unity of the fate wow the faith the faith is christ hallelujah is speaking of christ this the faith is different from first corinthians 12 when the word of god said when paul said con first corinthians 12 verse 1 concerning spiritual gifts hallelujah oh praise god and brother paul started to list out the nine spiritual gifts and he said faith hallelujah faith he never said the faith let's just let us read it hallelujah first corinthians 12 verse 1 now it's a now concerning spiritual kiss bridging i would not have you ignorant oh god look at first look at verse four now they are diversities and diversities mean different they are different [Laughter] glory to god diversities of gifts but the same spirit hallelujah amen praise god and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for one it is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another fate you never see you never see the fate here he said to another fate but when brother paul said when brother paul used use faith instead in the unity of the he used the word the meaning specific he was specific he was speaking about christ hallelujah because faith is a revelation when jesus said to peter hallelujah flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father which is in heaven hallelujah he said this is a divine revelation faith is a revelation it's a divine revelation it has to be revealed to you oh my god it's not written it's not written it has been revealed when something is written you read it right but it has to be revealed romans 1 verse 17. oh praise god hallelujah talking about the fate romans 1 verse 17. brother paul said for therein is the righteousness of god reveal reveal it from faith to faith you know that the jews the the pharisees they were reading the scroll they were reading it they were reading it but never have they heard this before when where the came on the scene he said for therein is the righteousness of god there's two righteousness you have the righteousness of the law are the righteousness of god the righteousness of the law is written the righteousness of the law is written but the righteousness of god is to be revealed waiting jesus said the letter kill it the letter kill it but the spirit give it life oh praise god this is revealed from faith to faith oh my god from faith to faith if you want to know the righteousness of god it has to be revealed but the righteousness of the law hallelujah it is written oh my god holy no wonder why they said they said to jesus thou shalt not break the sabbath it is written thou shalt not do this it is written no shall not do that it is written but jesus said believe that i am he believe that i am he hallelujah i am the faith i am righteousness of god you're holding on to the righteousness of the law but i am the righteousness of god in order for you to get the revelation of god you have to accept me hallelujah you have to you have to accept me to get this revelation hallelujah if you don't accept me you're still in your sins you're still in your religions you're still blinded by your traditions hallelujah you're still blinded by men doctrines but when you see the righteousness of god hallelujah it brings you further away from religions it brings you into the dimension whereby hallelujah god wants to express himself to you hallelujah oh praise god no wonder why hallelujah romans chapter 10 oh praise god romans 10 verse 1 where the paul said bridging you still call them virgin okay i love them virgin my heart's desire and prior to god for israel is that they might be safe oh my god for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god oh my god they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they're being ignorant of god's righteousness you see god's righteousness wow this righteousness is faith god's righteousness his faith without faith it is impossible to please god the bible says he that committed god must first believe that is a reward of them that diligently seek after him look here they have been ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own selves and have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god look at verse six now same scripture verse six but the righteousness riches of faith speak it and this wise that's righteousness riches of faith hallelujah praise god philippians philippians 3 glory to god hallelujah move in the scriptures philippians 3 verse 9 where paul said and be found in him what a place that's a place we want to be found in him not in a church but in christ this is not right oh my god and be found in him you know i don't know if they if you heard us they used to sing the song that you know when people die don't come search because i will be around the troll but you know what we don't sing that song i want to be found in christ when you're in christ you're in your position oh praise god and be found in him not having my own righteousness rich is your own righteousness is a flock what do you think isaiah said holiday our righteousness is us filthy rugs our righteousness is as filthy runs brother paul is saying my right my whole righteousness is of the law that righteousness is contrary it's contrary to the word it's contrary to the spirit hallelujah look at it but that is true the faith of christ the righteousness riches of god by faith that's what brother paul wanted to establish hallelujah you have two righteousness one of the law and one that is of god and this that is of god it comes through faith that's what god that's what please god your own righteousness cannot please god although the righteousness of god can please him so if you want to please god know the righteousness of god get in the righteousness of god and this righteousness of god is going to bring you into a realm whereby hallelujah is revealed himself to you hallelujah because romans 1 said dearing is the righteousness of god being revealed from faith to faith hallelujah so when he revealed to you look at what brother paul said in verse 10 that i may know him peter said thou art the christ how could peter know that it was divine revelation so the righteousness of god revealed to you crisis hallelujah he revealed who christ and once he revealed who christ is to you he's going to reveal who you are hallelujah reveal who you are he said that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings be made conformable unto his death if by means i might attain unto the resurrection of death brother person i want to know him i want to know him and the power of his resurrection you see because brother is it because brother paul know him he said to the galatians i could not leave galatia yet hallelujah until he said i travail with you until christ be forming you oh amen because he know christ that's why he travailed with them until he saw christ form in them hallelujah glory to god the purpose of god hallelujah is for his sons to understand who they are to take your position upon the hurt as sons of god hallelujah because he has given you the authority to do it the world cannot know the world will not know god by this as a matter of fact they've been reading this for about thousand and half years and yet even today they still do not know him this same book they have been reading it and they still don't know him in order for them to know god they have to know you oh jesus hallelujah look at it when jesus came they were reading the scroll but they still didn't know they didn't know jesus the woman of the world he said sir i perceive that the water profit amen i perceive that the water profit she never she never read a scroll she saw the vindication of a prophet she saw the sign of a prophet those pharisees and hierarchy hallelujah they were really in the schools and they could not know him they did not know him hallelujah and then jesus said jesus said to her you know what the messiah is going to come she said we know we know that the messiah is going to come and when he come he shall tell us tell us all these things jesus said human i am he that speaketh unto you is the messiah he revealed himself to her hallelujah glory to god so the world cannot know god by reading this as a matter of fact the more they read this is the more evil they do there has to know god by knowing you by seeing god in you hallelujah what about the people we cannot read who cannot read or can you bring god to them by bringing yourself to them those that cannot read by seeing you you know there's something different about you i see god in you jesus you have a different spirit there's a different anointing about you you don't have the anointing of that church over there there's something about your anointing hallelujah you see i can see the grace of god in your life hallelujah all glory to god because they see the expression of christ they see god expressed to them and by god being expressed to them they said man i want to have what you have hallelujah i want to go where you go hallelujah i want to live where you live where i live i live in the presence i live in the presence of the esohn hallelujah oh glory hallelujah where am i going hallelujah oh praise god i'm going hallelujah in the dimension of god jesus the word of god said holy for the edifying of the body of christ oh my god look at it the word edifying means to construct it means to build this body of christ is not talking about jesus natural first corinthians 12 verse 27 now you can underline that word now he never said you will or you are going to be he said now now are you present tense why because you receive the spirit of god he's not speaking about a different age oh in a different dispensation he's speaking about now now are you the body of christ hallelujah praise god now are you the body of christ when a revelation struck you you're not looking for tomorrow to be the body of christ you're not looking for next year to be the body of christ now hallelujah that transforms you right now and you step into that position hallelujah and when you are the body of christ you get to work a work to be done hallelujah oh hallelujah praise god now are you the body of christ it's for the edifying of the body of christ jesus said peter peter the devil is after you to sift you like weed but i have prayed for you i have already prayed for you and when you are converted i like the word converting you know if jesus never used that word converted people would say peter they converted long time oh god people would say that peter was converted when god called peter and anointed him call him send him out the bible said even the devils were afraid of them even the devils were subjected but that was just an anointing hallelujah that was just an anointing the anointing can come upon anybody but the conversion only come upon the son of god hallelujah glory to god anybody can be anointed you know the bible said jesus god hallelujah he anointed the donkey the mule to speak to a prophet how could the meal speak to a prophet because he was anointed the raven bring meat to a prophet because he the raven was anointed
