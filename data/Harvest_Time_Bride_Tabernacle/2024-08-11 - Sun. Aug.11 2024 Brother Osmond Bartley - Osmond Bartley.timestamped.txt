[22:21] happen he said I'm here to pay the price
[22:24] of

[30:06] a chart but I'm getting to be God want
[30:10] me to
[30:11] be amen and so I tell you what I ask God
[30:16] this turn your Bibles in the same time
[30:17] in the book of mar uh is it Mark 11 good
[30:22] read from verse just a few verses there
[30:24] in saints of God Amen
[30:29] we we uh we're going to take a little
[30:31] topic here and you know last night the
[30:34] Lord just blessed us with his word and I
[30:36] tell you the the camp meeting was
[30:39] great great man and the Saints R it back
[30:42] out because this as this morning I got a
[30:44] text message oh I enjoy that message but
[30:47] it was there I said wow that's good so
[30:49] much for technology yes
[30:53] good all right Luke chap 11 and uh
[30:58] we're going to look
[31:00] at let's start from verse 12 and I tell
[31:03] you the verses as
[31:07] down and on the tomorrow when they were
[31:11] come from Bethany he was
[31:13] hungry Jesus was hungry oh yes he
[31:17] was he was 100% man 100% God but he was
[31:22] hungry yes H so seeing a fig tree of far
[31:27] all
[31:29] having leaves she came if apply perhaps
[31:33] he might find anything there on the
[31:37] Fig not a mango not a orange but a
[31:41] fig because the Fig in those days had a
[31:44] lot lot sugar right and so they used to
[31:47] use it to make
[31:48] sugar so when you're hungry what
[31:51] normally happens is like your blood
[31:52] sugar
[31:54] drops so Jesus needed the sugar
[31:58] right good and so that he might find
[32:01] anything there and when he came to it he
[32:03] found nothing but
[32:07] leaves for the time of figs was not
[32:12] yet
[32:14] wow and Jesus answered and said unto it
[32:18] the Fig Tree no man eat of thee there
[32:21] after
[32:23] forever unless disciples heard it let's
[32:27] jump down what's happened later on verse
[32:30] uh
[32:31] 20 and in the morning as they passed by
[32:35] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[32:38] roots and Peter calling to Rememberance
[32:42] said unto him amen Master behold the Fig
[32:47] Tree which though curse is withered
[32:52] away amen and Jesus answering said unto
[32:56] them have Faith sounds simple isn't

[34:54] normal and uh as I tell you
[34:59] it's very interesting sometime you're
[35:01] studying the word and you're in the
[35:04] meditation of the word and things jump
[35:06] out to you and I remember a time a young
[35:09] man and you know was saying to me
[35:13] that that you know Pastor I've been
[35:15] praying for things and it's just not
[35:17] happening and you know you know real
[35:20] good pay the tithing and offering and
[35:22] all of that real faithful to to to to
[35:26] church yeah and uh you know I prayed
[35:29] about it and you know you want to give
[35:31] an answer because you know people if you
[35:35] understand a pastor sometime he has to
[35:37] be a doctor he has to be a
[35:40] psychiatrist he has to be a
[35:42] psychologist he has to be a mechanic I
[35:46] was telling brother Dale this morning a
[35:48] brother from church texting me he want
[35:50] to buy a car and he send me the call
[35:53] what what you think about
[35:56] this so he need an answer sometime a
[35:59] pastor is a is an architect you know I'm
[36:02] going to build a house you like this
[36:04] design so you got to have you may not
[36:07] have answer for everything but it's
[36:09] surprised to
[36:11] know what people think about a
[36:14] leader and so you know many have thought
[36:17] about it then I then I say Tri real
[36:20] wonderful have family and I say brother
[36:23] I I I hope that you're treating your
[36:26] wife well now what do you mean it says
[36:29] do you know the Bible says in 1 Peter
[36:31] chapter 3:7 you must honor your
[36:35] wife honor your wife as the weaker
[36:39] vessel so that your PR and the way you
[36:42] treat her your prayers can be
[36:44] [Applause]
[36:46] hindered
[36:47] wow your prayers can be hindered the way
[36:51] you treat your wife and he said I never
[36:54] thought of that but be I said brother I
[36:56] tell you when that scripture jump out me
[36:58] I I all me personally brothers and
[37:01] sisters I said I try to do everything in
[37:04] the word of God Amen to treat that of
[37:07] the sweetheart of mine
[37:10] right oh God because I don't want when I
[37:14] pray for something doesn't
[37:17] happen amen thank you Jesus and he said
[37:19] thank you brother I will look into the
[37:22] word and I said but that's what the word
[37:24] says but s of God has we look at even
[37:29] the nothing is wrong with the word of
[37:34] God don't you debate the word of God
[37:37] don't do it no I do not sayage on the
[37:40] word that means
[37:42] personal the message and the word I put
[37:45] them together and I call the word of
[37:49] God listen me I call the word of God and
[37:52] I understand it that way true the
[37:54] leading of the holy spirit amen now
[37:59] notice even the parable that Jesus
[38:01] Christ spoke about you remember the
[38:03] parables in Matthew Chapter 13 when you
[38:06] talk about the SE that went to seow seed
[38:09] nothing was wrong with the
[38:11] seed nothing is wrong with the
[38:14] word nothing is wrong with the message
[38:16] of
[38:17] God but notice the places that the seed
[38:23] fell oh my God that's why the way side
[38:27] amen the stone the ground among thorns
[38:30] and the good
[38:32] ground it was the place that the seed
[38:36] fell that was the problem nothing is
[38:40] wrong with the word but who get is where
[38:43] the word
[38:45] reaches oh
[38:47] Hallelujah glory to God Amen brother
[38:51] Luke's account of it Luke 8:1 15 he says
[38:56] amen but that on the good ground are
[39:00] they which receive in an honest
[39:05] art and having heard the
[39:08] word keep it you bring forth
[39:13] fruit honest
[39:15] art you keep
[39:18] it so you must be honest your heart must
[39:22] be pure your heart must be right and
[39:26] when the word of God hit that heart oh
[39:29] my you will bring forth fruit and much
[39:33] fruit with
[39:35] patience many times God will do things
[39:40] against the normal and we will miss it
[39:44] right because we're not seeing or
[39:46] hearing the message beyond that or the
[39:51] bigger message beyond what God is doing
[39:55] because sometime we can just structure
[39:57] her life in such a pattern that we are
[40:00] not seeing the bigger picture beyond
[40:03] what God is
[40:04] doing there
[40:06] you yes we
[40:10] can but look at the Saints against a
[40:13] normal against the usual
[40:17] way when Joshua looked and said Son
[40:22] stand still that wasn't
[40:25] normal glory to God
[40:28] you heard that that's not
[40:30] normal amen Moses never did that glory
[40:34] to God Moses speak to the Rock that's
[40:38] not normal because God told him before
[40:42] strike the rock with your
[40:46] Rod oh
[40:48] my I
[40:51] remember 7: 26- 27 God told Israel as he
[40:57] laid out
[40:59] the the laws of
[41:02] offering he said it's Abomination to eat
[41:06] anything with
[41:09] blood whether birds or beasts any person
[41:14] that do that you will be cut off from
[41:17] the people from among my people and yet
[41:20] Jesus who said those words God
[41:23] himself glory to God yet Jesus
[41:27] God in flesh stood there in
[41:32] Jerusalem in John 6 for when Jesus
[41:36] preaching
[41:37] publicly and said except you drink my
[41:40] blood and eat my flesh you have no life
[41:44] in you that's against what he already
[41:49] said who can take it's a heart saying
[41:52] who can take it when God do things
[41:57] against the normal many times it
[42:00] stumbles people but there is a message
[42:04] beyond that read between the lines he
[42:08] that haven't hear to hear will hear what
[42:11] the spirit of God is saying unto the
[42:16] churches glory to God but because it's
[42:19] against my pattern because it's against
[42:22] my structure I'm not able to see it oh
[42:26] Hallelujah ujah glory to God Amen
[42:30] remember Amen Brother John laid it out
[42:34] in John 23 St John chap
[42:38] 21:3 amen show that the disciples
[42:42] usually uh fish at night and they toil
[42:46] all night in Luke
[42:49] 5:4 they toil all night and catch no
[42:53] fish because these guys were experienced
[42:56] fish
[42:57] man amen and when Jesus said to them
[43:01] cast your net in the Deep because it's
[43:04] not day this a master but we to all
[43:08] night and catch nothing we are
[43:11] fishermen I'm a fisherman from a from I

[47:31] fashion Hallelujah creation work in
[47:35] harmony with its creator glory glory to

[47:53] we're going to pull up Hallelujah not
[47:56] the season that for according to the
[47:59] original creation but now the Creator is
[48:04] hungry glory to God thank you Lord the
[48:07] Creator is hungry what's your
[48:10] response the Bible says and he
[48:15] answered Christ was in
[48:19] communication with the fig tree right he
[48:23] was speaking with the fig tree right
[48:27] and the Fig Tree amen was communicating
[48:31] with
[48:32] Jesus that's why the word says and when
[48:35] he came nothing was there Jesus
[48:40] answered and said Oh
[48:44] Glory
[48:45] Hallelujah Jesus
[48:48] answered and said unto the tree oh God
[48:52] the tree of
[48:53] hears the mountains of hears all of
[48:57] God's creation were created with the
[49:01] faculty to hear from you to speak with
[49:04] you to respond to the command of God but
[49:08] now that God reach and standing here
[49:12] don't you tell him that you are not
[49:14] ready to produce you got to produce amen
[49:18] you have to
[49:21] produce
[49:24] Hallelujah no man shall eat of this
[49:28] thereafter it dried from The
[49:31] Roots Jesus said it's just Faith it's
[49:35] Faith have faith but you know what works
[49:39] with faith
[49:40] anonine
[49:43] love you can stand up and pray a two
[49:46] hours of magnificent prayers reeling out
[49:50] words from your from your dictionary to
[49:53] God and it just bouncing back why you
[49:57] got to learn to forgive Jesus Hallelujah
[50:01] you don't like that how could Jesus
[50:03] talking about faith amen laying the
[50:05] foundation this is what happened Jesus
[50:08] said it's just faith I spoke it the
[50:11] spoken word operates by faith he that
[50:15] come to God must believe that he is
[50:18] because without faith it is impossible
[50:20] to please God but Jesus jumped from
[50:23] faith and said guys when you are praying
[50:27] make sure that you
[50:30] forgive wow forgiveness comes from
[50:35] love glory to God hallelujah forgiveness
[50:39] comes out of love and love comes out of
[50:43] a pure heart love is of God and Jesus
[50:47] said yes you want this Faith you got to
[50:50] love first hallelujah oh my glory to God
[50:56] lord
[50:57] may I start loving first before I start
[51:01] preaching Lord may I start loving first
[51:05] before I start amen teach him the
[51:09] word we talk about faith faith faith
[51:12] start to love
[51:16] first oh
[51:20] God so Jesus said I Faith now what
[51:24] brought this
[51:25] faith what brought about this faith that
[51:27] Jesus manifested
[51:32] desperation he was
[51:35] hungry he was
[51:40] hungry now the holy spirit says tell the
[51:46] people desperation bring Christ on the
[51:49] scene desperation produced this fate not
[51:54] frustration
[51:57] sometimes we go to God in frustration
[52:01] not
[52:03] desperation don't go to God and tell him
[52:05] you're tired of the
[52:07] economy
[52:09] no don't go to God and tell him you're
[52:11] tired of the
[52:12] government all things were created by
[52:16] Him and for
[52:19] him amen Glory Hallelujah you know I
[52:23] look up the word frustration is a Fe
[52:26] feeling of being
[52:30] upset annoyed or deep chronic sense in a
[52:35] state of insecurity and
[52:39] dissatisfaction arising from
[52:42] unsolved problems or unfulfilled
[52:48] needs that don't bring
[52:54] Fai oh can I read something where the
[52:57] prophet of God
[52:58] says I believe the reason we don't have
[53:02] desperation is because the church lack
[53:05] the love of
[53:09] God the love of God Amen causes
[53:14] desperation not
[53:18] frustration oh God Lord I'm tired of
[53:21] wearing this one shoes Lord my shoes is
[53:24] broken I can't wear anymore I'm not
[53:27] going to church that's
[53:29] frustration desperation is Lord no
[53:32] matter how broken it is I'm going to
[53:34] worship you
[53:35] anyhow Lord I'm going to worship you
[53:38] anyhow glory to God hallelujah put him
[53:42] the hours and your reward is
[53:46] sure desperation will bring Christ on
[53:48] the scene
[53:50] desperation is what brings out the true
[53:53] you glory to God hallelujah
[53:57] amen the prophet said usually it's
[54:02] human it's
[54:04] human human are slothful in their minds
[54:08] it takes an emergency has to rise and
[54:11] when that do it throws them in
[54:14] desperation oh Hallelujah but you know
[54:18] desperation usually brings out the real
[54:21] thing that you
[54:24] are it shows what you are made of thank
[54:28] you
[54:29] Jesus thank you Lord so did Jesus just
[54:33] curs the Fig Tree because he God that
[54:36] Jesus was uh was being unjust to the Fig
[54:40] Tree he was sh them something here
[54:44] hallelujah the anger brings out a level
[54:47] of faith and that levels of Faith amen
[54:51] comes from
[54:53] desperation as a son and daughter of God
[54:56] God uh we are built uh in the image and
[55:00] likeness of God uh something lies uh
[55:04] beneath this flesh and that's God
[55:10] himself the true you how will that come
[55:13] out
[55:15] desperation
[55:17] pressure
[55:18] pressure glory to God it usually pulls
[55:22] out the good things that's are in that
[55:25] is in you Jesus I'm reading that it
[55:28] usually brings out the good thing now no
[55:31] this
[55:32] things and I look up this and I
[55:35] says by
[55:37] faith
[55:39] Enoch was
[55:41] translated all right that he should the
[55:45] Bible said that he should not see there
[55:48] something in heo we talk about it the
[55:51] other day the heo had to train his
[55:54] senses something and remember he had
[55:57] families all around hadam was there
[56:00] hadam had the Original Seed like how
[56:02] brother BR put it he said hadam never
[56:04] had a belly button because he never cut
[56:06] from a
[56:08] mama so I can't imagine the Curiosity
[56:11] that build around Adam's life because at
[56:13] the worlden when his study hadam was 752
[56:17] years when hoch was born hoch uh 65
[56:21] years later you know uh unto him was
[56:23] born Methuselah so all the these men
[56:27] were around hadam and oh my 300 years
[56:32] later hoch was
[56:35] translated the Apostle the Bible
[56:38] says Enoch walked with
[56:42] God two times that statement is used in
[56:45] the Bible never use again he said Noah
[56:48] walked with God that he said Enoch walk
[56:51] with God the statement walk with God
[56:54] doesn't mean that you physically walk it
[56:56] mean that you live in the presence of
[56:59] the
[57:00] supernatural oh
[57:01] Hallelujah you constantly dwell in the
[57:05] presence of the supernatural Hallelujah
[57:09] you constantly meditating on the word of
[57:11] God you constantly live under
[57:16] expectation Hallelujah and you know what
[57:18] happened the prophet said what you
[57:21] expect is what you shall get amen glory
[57:25] to God I expect daily in your life uh
[57:29] you got to live on
[57:31] expectation that you shall have a body
[57:34] change Hallelujah any day now you shall
[57:38] have a body change any day now you shall
[57:42] have a
[57:47] change no wonder this world is in
[57:50] confusion when you tell them about the
[57:51] Rapture because it's against the norm
[57:54] right yeah how will that happen
[57:57] and gravity pulls everything that goes
[57:58] up right it's against the
[58:02] nor GL God hallelujah now 69 years after
[58:08] the translation Noah was born now no
[58:11] this says when Noah came on the scene
[58:15] what was the talk of the
[58:19] day your great-grandfather has
[58:21] disappeared we don't know where he is
[58:24] because God never explained to anybody
[58:27] you know why I took him and he's with me
[58:30] God don't explain
[58:33] it glory to God she watch message of the
[58:36] day yeah oh your grandpa disappeared we
[58:39] don't know where he's at he mean your
[58:40] great grandpa disappeared where is he
[58:43] nobody ever seen in him do you know he
[58:45] he was the only one that lived such a
[58:47] short years
[58:49] 365 because God had a patter over he's
[58:52] life types one oh Hallelujah glory to
[58:55] God
[58:56] amen don't you realize amen that Noah
[59:01] kept his eyes on the words of
[59:05] Enoch and he was desperate Amen to
[59:09] revisit what happened and through the
[59:12] desperation God brought the FI to Noah
[59:16] why because Noah realized that Enoch saw
[59:21] something in Adam he saw something from
[59:25] the original seed hallelujah oh glory to
[59:28] God and there it brought that Faith the
[59:32] prophet says desperation produced that
[59:36] faith and that faith comes from love
[59:44] right I like how we put
[59:50] it we got to walk with God the same way
[59:54] to produce his faith we sing all the
[59:57] times in the message because we can read
[59:59] it oh we Enoch the seventh of Adam oh we
[1:00:04] are the in the seventh age right this is
[1:00:07] not stepping off into nowhere no just
[1:00:10] like that we're going to come on the
[1:00:14] squeeze the squeeze produce

[1:01:51] faith of Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] that's the
[1:02:00] thing read the Bible that's in there
[1:02:03] Apostle Paul talk about you got faith in
[1:02:05] Jesus right you read right through the
[1:02:07] scriptures many had faith in
[1:02:09] Jesus but they never had the faith of
[1:02:14] Jesus Oh
[1:02:16] Hallelujah when you had the faith of
[1:02:19] when Jesus have faith in God he was the
[1:02:22] son of God Jesus said the father work
[1:02:25] and work yeah why do you think he prayed
[1:02:29] the prayor when he's the father in John

[1:02:34] consecutively Jesus said father I want
[1:02:36] them to be one as we are father let them
[1:02:39] to be one as we are what would that
[1:02:42] mean Jesus said I am the father one the

[1:03:26] God may I produce attributes as the Son
[1:03:30] of God that's who the world creation has
[1:03:33] been waiting for creation has never been
[1:03:37] waiting for the Baptist the Methodist
[1:03:40] the Church of God Pastor Dave Pastor
[1:03:43] Bartley always waiting for the message
[1:03:45] Believers the world creation has been
[1:03:49] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:03:52] what sons of God glory to God sons of
[1:03:57] God that are being created by the word
[1:04:00] of
[1:04:05] Truth the Faith of Christ Jesus brought
[1:04:08] us about the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:04:11] the faith of Jesus produced the
[1:04:13] revelation of redemption the faith of
[1:04:16] Jesus brings a revelation of our
[1:04:19] identity the faith of Jesus glory to God
[1:04:23] reveals the true purpose of the son of
[1:04:26] God in this last
[1:04:28] day desperation calls for a subject I'm
[1:04:34] reading and he said notice when when the
[1:04:39] subject no matter how faint that subject
[1:04:42] is it received this it received
[1:04:45] desperation right
[1:04:47] there right because Faith
[1:04:52] catches when desperation pushes
[1:04:57] oh I love that have faith in God notice
[1:05:02] can I say that again Faith catches it
[1:05:06] when desperation push
[1:05:08] it love in there mix with
[1:05:16] that you got to mix love with
[1:05:19] that to God mix love with that
[1:05:26] glory to God Amen you see that so faith
[1:05:30] will catch what desperation
[1:05:34] pushes but
[1:05:36] desperation is an anointing that sege
[1:05:40] for
[1:05:41] subjects but that predestinated subject
[1:05:45] oh amen the desperation will come on you
[1:05:49] brother Dale and when desperation HS you
[1:05:53] God knows he's not destroying you you
[1:05:56] it's putting you under pressure why to
[1:05:59] produce that
[1:06:01] Faith glory to God but if that love is
[1:06:05] not in you sometimes what the pressure
[1:06:09] produce is anger and miserableness and
[1:06:13] hatefulness oh Hallelujah can I preach
[1:06:16] this but when the love is inside there
[1:06:19] you are forgiving you are kind you are
[1:06:22] Meek you are gentle put them together it
[1:06:25] brings the faith of God
[1:06:35] hallelujah you know the problem with
[1:06:37] some of us sometimes we sign a contract
[1:06:40] to work 40 hours for the week but you
[1:06:43] only work
[1:06:44] 20 and at the end of the week you won 40
[1:06:47] hour
[1:06:49] pay that's
[1:06:52] unreasonable oh God help some of us how
[1:06:55] do you do that and then when you don't
[1:06:58] get the 40 hour pay and you're not able
[1:07:00] to match up your bills and you get
[1:07:02] miserable you're hungry put in the 40
[1:07:10] hours come on Saints put in the 40
[1:07:17] hours oh
[1:07:18] hallelujah oh oh I I feel like reading
[1:07:22] again desperation is always calling for
[1:07:26] a subject right and when he find the
[1:07:28] subject no matter how faint that subject
[1:07:31] is the subject will receive that
[1:07:34] anointing but then what happen because
[1:07:38] desperation is pushing pushing oh faith
[1:07:42] will catch that but you got to mix that
[1:07:45] with love and then it produce what God
[1:07:49] want
[1:07:51] Glory oh my God thank you Jesus
[1:07:56] whoa
[1:07:57] Hallelujah the prophet said I believe go
[1:08:00] let me go further on just one more right
[1:08:02] one more quote he said and when notice
[1:08:05] Elijah the prophet on the dead
[1:08:09] baby right on the dead
[1:08:15] baby he
[1:08:16] said he laid on him over the bed baby
[1:08:20] the baby sneezed seven times what did he
[1:08:23] laid over he laid over
[1:08:30] desperation the baby come to life why
[1:08:33] because that desperation drove the woman
[1:08:37] to the
[1:08:38] prophet and Desperation drove the
[1:08:41] prophet to the
[1:08:44] baby so desperation in both of them
[1:08:48] drove to God and bring God on the
[1:08:52] sea but that has to come with love
[1:08:56] love for his
[1:08:58] people hallelujah glory god that has to
[1:09:02] come through
[1:09:03] love when you love God and love his
[1:09:08] people that's what brought the love of
[1:09:11] God down and he throw faith into the
[1:09:15] Battlefront and what will produce the
[1:09:18] work will take
[1:09:21] place oh God hallelujah amen all right
[1:09:27] hallah you got to learn to love God's
[1:09:30] people right we have all differences
[1:09:33] yeah but what you do love cast all of
[1:09:35] that way we going to see all men clearly
[1:09:39] from a pure
[1:09:47] mind Revelation chapter 10 the Bible
[1:09:50] says and Christ appeared in the form of
[1:09:53] a mighty Angel the rainbow the Covenant
[1:09:56] of Life The Covenant of Love that God
[1:09:59] has came down upon him he was the angel
[1:10:03] as he cried with a loud voice not a
[1:10:05] shout but a voice because that's where
[1:10:08] his sheep will hear because he said my
[1:10:10] sheep hear my voice as the king echoed a
[1:10:15] as a lion roared seven Thunders utter
[1:10:18] their voices glory to God their Li is a
[1:10:21] Rapture in faith that's why you said

[1:11:06] Spirit brought something to us so
[1:11:08] clearly I never even see it that
[1:11:12] way but the Bible said for as many as
[1:11:15] receive him John chapter 1:12 to them
[1:11:18] gave he power to become the sons of God
[1:11:21] oh you are already Son of God but the
[1:11:24] statement to become means you come up to
[1:11:26] maturity you come up to the adoption to
[1:11:29] receive him how do you receive Christ
[1:11:31] how do you receive Christ by confessing
[1:11:33] that Jesus is Lord how do you receive
[1:11:36] Christ by baptizing in the name of the
[1:11:38] Lord Jesus Christ no Jesus said if you
[1:11:41] receive him that I said you receive me
[1:11:49] Hallelujah woo God you see you see that
[1:11:52] Jesus said if you receive if that I said

[1:17:51] simple isn't it I thought God because I
[1:17:54] don't know this even
[1:17:55] God because I don't read off the church
[1:17:57] age book God because I don't no God
[1:17:59] never said that he said the reason why
[1:18:02] we cannot produce that faith is because

[1:18:07] because why there is no desperation he
[1:18:09] said we lack the love of
