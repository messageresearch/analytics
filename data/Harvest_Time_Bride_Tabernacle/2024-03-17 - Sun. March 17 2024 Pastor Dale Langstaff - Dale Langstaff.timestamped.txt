[23:36] you love you dearly and you know
[23:40] everything is about him everything it's
[23:43] not
[23:44] about individual us we love each other
[23:47] but it's about Christ amen Christ
[23:51] Jesus he's the one that's worthy of all
[23:53] of our praise
[23:55] amen amen amen it's fine with me if that
[23:58] door I'm going to die up here Vicki the
[24:02] heat it's a little hotter in here today
[24:03] because our thermostat was behind the
[24:05] plastic and it was freezing behind there
[24:08] when we came and so it was roasting the
[24:10] rest of the church but Jared just
[24:12] mentioned a few updates they're coming
[24:14] to do the spray foam on Thursday and our
[24:17] neighbors are are are literally painting
[24:19] and staining the boards now that we'll
[24:21] go in there it'll be whitewashed Pine
[24:24] and uh everything just fell together
[24:27] amazing
[24:32] um normally we would have to do the pine
[24:34] painting and the fellowship hall because
[24:36] it's too cold to do it outside and the
[24:37] neighbor said oh no bring that to my
[24:39] dad's shop and we'll just bring it when
[24:41] you put it up and it won't be in your
[24:42] way and so by next Sunday this it should
[24:46] be started some of the ceiling by two
[24:48] weeks from today it should be done the
[24:50] pine so the slowest thing that will be
[24:52] coming will be the window it'll probably
[24:55] be about four weeks we hope it's only
[24:57] that but the pine and that'll be all
[24:59] done the lights will be all done it'll
[25:00] just be it'll just be silver where the
[25:02] window goes till we put it in but it
[25:05] really did come together beautifully and
[25:08] and it was uh needful the the center
[25:11] stained glass that would move
[25:13] about an inch back and forth it sounded
[25:16] like a creakily sounded like me when I
[25:19] get up in the morning all my joints snap
[25:21] it would move back and forth about an
[25:22] inch and the plexiglass that was behind
[25:24] it was broken so a big one could have
[25:28] literally blew it out um but uh so we
[25:31] just praise God to be able to do
[25:33] that also we just I think we have an
[25:36] announcement um that uh we might I my
[25:41] desire would be if we could take a a
[25:42] church picture afterwards before
[25:45] everybody pulls their ties off and that
[25:48] in the fellowship hall because I
[25:50] believe uh sadly that this will be the
[25:53] last Sunday that Brother Joseph and
[25:55] sister Myra will be with us unless God
[25:57] does miracle in our favor amen and we
[26:02] love them we want what we don't want
[26:05] what we want we want what God wants and
[26:07] we wish them the they're part of us and
[26:11] always will be and and uh we uh just
[26:16] been a real blessing just uh to have
[26:18] Believers that enjoy the word of God and
[26:20] are very kind and
[26:27] appreciative
[26:29] amen It's just sad to see friends leave
[26:32] amen but it's it's all part of God's
[26:34] plan we're going to find that out today
[26:37] and amen just I cover your prayers I
[26:39] thank you brother Bart for praying for a
[26:41] couple weeks I've just felt like I was
[26:44] coming down with something but it never
[26:45] came down so uh we keep pushing him back
[26:48] and
[26:49] enjoying uh enjoying God's fellowship
[26:52] and that so amen amen let's stand and
[26:56] we'll read uh our scripture
[27:01] you know I got this thought from Brother
[27:03] Brown preached this right before he died
[27:04] the white dove it was about 10 messages
[27:07] before he died and he preached about
[27:09] four messages and one there and and I
[27:12] got this thought out of the beginning of
[27:15] his message and and it's just really
[27:17] beautiful and it's about Grace it's a
[27:19] covenant of
[27:20] Abraham and God did to Abram before he
[27:23] was
[27:24] Abraham and it really touched my heart
[27:27] and I believe it was will touch all of
[27:28] our hearts amen Genesis 15 1
[27:33] to 1 to to 9 or
[27:37] 10
[27:40] amen after these things the word of the
[27:42] Lord came to unto Abram in a vision
[27:45] saying fear not Abram now that that fear
[27:47] not is good for us today when the
[27:49] world's falling apart I am your shield
[27:53] and thou ex and thou exceeding great
[27:56] reward and Abraham said Lord God what
[28:00] will thou give me seeing I go
[28:03] childless and the steward of my house is
[28:07] this elzer the damsel and Abram said
[28:10] behold to me thou Hast given me no seed
[28:13] and low no one born in my house is my
[28:17] Heir and behold the word of the Lord
[28:18] came to him saying this shall not be
[28:21] thine Heir but he shall come forth out
[28:24] of thine own bowels now that's a type of
[28:26] Christ and us his bride and shall be
[28:30] thine
[28:32] Heir excuse me and he brought him forth
[28:35] abroad and said look now toward heaven
[28:38] and tell me the
[28:43] stars and if Thou Art able to number
[28:46] them and he said unto him so shalt thou
[28:49] seed be and he believed in the Lord and
[28:52] it was counted unto him for
[28:53] righteousness and he said unto him I am
[28:56] the Lord God that brought the out of
[28:59] Earth of the Chans to give Thee the land
[29:03] to inherit it let's just think of that
[29:07] spiritually in the baptism of the Holy
[29:09] Ghost and Abraham said on said to him he
[29:12] said Lord God whereby shall I
[29:16] know that I shall inherit the Holy Ghost
[29:19] and God said unto him he said take a red
[29:22] haer of three years old and and a sheo
[29:27] of three years old and a ram a three
[29:29] years old and a turtle dove and a young
[29:34] pigeon and he took unto him all these
[29:37] and he divided them in its midst and he
[29:39] laid them each one piece against the
[29:43] other but the birds this is a key part
[29:47] but the
[29:48] birds he divided not Lord Jesus we pray
[29:51] that you'll add your blessing to the
[29:53] word God and we pray that God that in
[29:57] our honorability that you will portray
[30:00] this to the people like you gave it to
[30:02] me Lord Jesus and we give you the glory
[30:04] and honor for it in your name amen you
[30:07] may have your
[30:08] seats Hallelujah let's just uh pull up
[30:12] another scripture here I'm just looking
[30:13] for it
[30:16] here actually maybe we'll just uh
[30:26] uh Genesis 1 11 and 12 there we go just
[30:31] finding what I wanted
[30:36] here Genesis 1: 11- 12 and God said let
[30:39] the Earth bring forth its grass and Herb
[30:41] yielding of its seed and the fruit tree
[30:43] yielding F fruit after its kind and the
[30:47] seed is in itself unto the Earth and it
[30:51] shall be so and the Earth brought forth
[30:53] grass and herbs yielding seed after his
[30:56] kind and the tree tree yielding fruit
[30:59] after its kind and the seed was in
[31:02] itself after its kind and God saw it and
[31:06] it was good man we when we look into
[31:08] this scripture I just want to read a
[31:09] quote here talking about in the the
[31:13] breach between the seven seal and the
[31:14] Seven Church ages here here our Prophet
[31:17] talked about you know we're going to
[31:19] talk about God's covenant to Abram and
[31:22] it was it was an unconditional Covenant
[31:24] and it was amazing grace to us and it
[31:27] was all through ction and we're going to
[31:28] touch on that and uh you know if you
[31:31] look at a seed you can't it's the power
[31:34] of the seed is in the germ of life and
[31:36] and no matter what science can do they
[31:38] can never science itself can't even
[31:40] produce a germ of life because they can
[31:43] change the the attributes of the seed
[31:45] around it we we see that in the fing
[31:47] industry but they can't change the life
[31:50] they can they can make soybeans Round Up
[31:52] ready and corn Round Up ready and even
[31:53] wheat Round Up ready but the life is in
[31:56] the germ and where whever that germ was
[31:59] predestinated
[32:01] from that's what it will produce amen
[32:04] it's all based on predestination and
[32:07] germs from from the foundation of the
[32:09] world and so when God made a seed after
[32:12] its kind that's what we are this morning
[32:16] we are God's seed after the very
[32:19] Jehovah that he is amen and we see this
[32:23] and and see so when we look at Grace it
[32:25] says it's unmar favor of God it's it's
[32:29] it's
[32:30] uh it's not you're not acquitted you
[32:33] didn't earn it or you didn't observe it
[32:35] it it's nothing and when we when we get
[32:37] into this and we'll we'll see further
[32:40] down the the scripture and this is
[32:42] amazing but the the the the the concern
[32:45] that we have here is there's seeds on
[32:48] both
[32:49] sides and even your own and I'm going to
[32:53] show you something this morning this was
[32:54] amazing as you study the message even
[32:57] your own Free Will Choice can't change
[33:00] God's
[33:02] predestination Hallelujah even your
[33:04] mistakes can't change God's pre- will
[33:07] destination you know brother Bram said
[33:08] that and I don't have it in front of me
[33:10] in questions and answers after they
[33:11] preached the Hebrew series and I've been
[33:13] listening to that in my uh at night and
[33:16] and he said even the Free Will desire of
[33:19] the people God would change for his
[33:22] predestinated plan that that's beautiful
[33:25] amen when you look at that on the
[33:28] unmerited favor of God and it's
[33:31] something that we did nothing to deserve
[33:33] but it was God's plan
[33:35] amen let's look in the just a a a quote
[33:39] here to lay down the breach because we
[33:41] want to lay down some just a little bit
[33:43] of good Doctrine here the seals were
[33:46] broke why in the last Church age the
[33:49] last Church age ago to reveal the truce
[33:53] why the lamb broke the seals and he
[33:56] revealed them to his bride
[33:58] in order to collect the subjects that's
[34:01] what we are his subjects for his kingdom
[34:05] amen his bride see see Oh my he said he
[34:09] wants to bring you his subjects to
[34:13] himself amen now that was paragraph 266
[34:16] and I'm just jumping some paragraphs and
[34:18] he said when he claims his
[34:20] inheritance that's the church the bride
[34:24] he'll claim you that's paragraph 179 and
[34:27] then we jump another paragraph and he
[34:29] said what what does he do then he
[34:32] disposes his contest to Satan and he
[34:35] throws him into the lake of fire with
[34:38] all those that were inspired by Satan to
[34:40] reject the word of redemption and he now
[34:43] we dro the next paragraph and he said
[34:45] now he's the king
[34:48] now watch this
[34:52] now but Mercy is still on the throne
[34:59] the breach between the seven Church ages
[35:02] he's the king now in other spots the
[35:06] prophet said that when he was King Mercy
[35:08] left but not here because of one
[35:13] word
[35:15] election he's the king now that's a
[35:18] direct paragraph 1 2 281 and mercy is
[35:21] still on the throne don't you reject his
[35:25] offer see he he's the riter and he knows
[35:30] just where you
[35:33] are Hallelujah you know if God's tugging
[35:37] on your heart this morning you should be
[35:38] the happiest person in your life amen to
[35:41] to to to know the very the very sign of
[35:44] election to God's family it's God's tug
[35:47] on your heart it's hard to believe that
[35:50] there's people in the world that have
[35:52] never and never will feel that
[35:56] desire be because they're elected to
[35:59] Eternal damnation and and I know you
[36:01] want to say where is it in the Bible
[36:04] that there's people elected to be lost
[36:06] and that's uh I'm glad you asked because
[36:08] that's in Jude 1 1-6 and we'll read that
[36:12] and and I just you know when you're
[36:14] turning there I want you to see that in
[36:16] the sacrifice here that God gave to
[36:19] Abram and I might say Abraham but it was
[36:22] before he got his new name he never
[36:24] divided the Dove and the pigeon because
[36:27] represented your healing and the prophet
[36:31] said that healing was always based even
[36:34] in the Old Testament this is powerful it
[36:36] was always based on your faith period it
[36:40] didn't even need the even under the the
[36:43] imperfection sacrifice healing was
[36:46] always based on your faith and so he
[36:48] never divided the pigeon and the dove
[36:51] because he never broke the healing that
[36:53] was for his people amen and he killed
[36:56] the one the Dove and a pig are exactly
[36:58] the same family and he would put the
[37:01] blood on the one and it and and the
[37:03] other one would fly and it would
[37:04] sprinkle the atonement for your healing
[37:07] today for your healing every day and and
[37:11] we're going to read some quotes in
[37:12] Jehovah Gyra he said we need to get rid
[37:15] of our fear and the church and recognize
[37:18] our position in
[37:20] Christ oh hallelujah it's beautiful it
[37:23] if if if you get even a part of what God
[37:26] has has delivered and and you know what
[37:28] our Prophet I would encourage you to go
[37:29] listen to the White Dove message it's
[37:32] it's beautiful amen very long but very
[37:34] beautiful amen and Jude here the Ser
[37:36] Jude the servant of Jesus Christ the
[37:38] brother of James to them that are
[37:40] Sanctified in God the
[37:42] father
[37:45] and uh preserved to Jesus Christ and
[37:48] called Mercy unto you and peace and love
[37:50] be multiplied beloved now I give you all
[37:53] diligent and write unto you the common
[37:55] salvation and it is Need for for me to
[37:58] write unto you and to exhort you that
[38:00] you should earnestly contend for the Fai
[38:02] which was delivered to the Saints verse
[38:04] four for there are certain men crept in
[38:10] unawares that's
[38:13] in
[38:15] the well you can put your own definition
[38:18] in that but in and these some of these
[38:20] quotes and these verses and the message
[38:21] of the Prophet had about 50 uh quotes to
[38:25] these and there is certain men crept in
[38:29] unawares who were before of old or
[38:33] before of old
[38:36] ordained to
[38:39] condemnation that's why you you will see
[38:42] that there will be religious people you
[38:44] you have to you have to watch this you
[38:47] have you have three different sects of
[38:49] people in the Bible but then you have
[38:51] two different situations see we have the
[38:54] Jews we have the bride and we have the
[38:56] foolish virgin that'll go through the
[38:58] tribulation but then we have those that
[39:01] are of the Father the devil Satan and
[39:04] but you will have Believers that make
[39:07] mistakes and your Holy Ghost that's in
[39:09] you not in your pastor the Holy Ghost
[39:11] that's in you have to discern the
[39:13] difference between a believer that made
[39:16] a mistake and the devil and the mistake
[39:19] will look exactly the
[39:24] same
[39:26] wow
[39:30] wow because in many cases it could be a
[39:33] believer that just fell down now see a
[39:36] Believer the the difference is a
[39:38] Believer it's a mistake something caught
[39:39] on a Wares or or something that they
[39:42] didn't realize or or iniquity but if you
[39:45] intentionally premeditate see there's a
[39:47] difference between killing somebody and
[39:50] meditating and planning it it's called
[39:52] first degree or second
[39:54] degree and when you when you when you
[39:57] pre-plan that you have no desire to
[39:59] serve
[40:01] God Amen that's a really good sign that
[40:05] you're you know
[40:08] Amen pre-ordained to condemnation
[40:11] ungodly men sitting in the family of God
[40:13] or in the church because see they've
[40:15] crept in unawares ungodly men turning
[40:18] the grace of our God into
[40:20] lasciviousness and if you look into that
[40:23] word lasciviousness you can hardly
[40:24] mention the definition in a mixed
[40:26] audience but uh you can look that up but
[40:29] it's a a very lustful desire denying the
[40:33] only Lord God you see you don't watch
[40:35] this in the in the in the church world
[40:39] you have Satan dressed like a minister
[40:41] and a priest in and in the
[40:43] denominational world and and you know
[40:45] I'm not saying don't don't we need to
[40:47] have fellowship with those people
[40:49] because that's the only way that the the
[40:51] last seed will come in and and brother
[40:52] Dale wants to go into a Rapture so we
[40:54] got to find the last person in this town
[40:58] but if you birds with the prophet said
[41:01] this birds with feathers flock together
[41:04] and there will be people that are in the
[41:06] religious movement that are of the
[41:09] father of the
[41:11] devil and they've crept in on a Wares
[41:13] and their wolf and sheep clothing and if
[41:16] you hang with them you're it it'll cost
[41:18] you your life because you'll get eight
[41:21] amen so that's why that's why in
[41:24] Revelations 8 I believe it is
[41:26] Revelations 8 talked about the the great
[41:28] Babylon the has fallen and in
[41:31] verse I believe it's verse I think it's
[41:33] verse eight maybe 8 too verse 10 it said
[41:36] come out of her my people and be not
[41:39] partakers of her place now that don't
[41:41] mean you can't go to somebody's house
[41:42] and have lunch and you're not going to
[41:44] work with denominational people and and
[41:46] that don't mean you might go and have
[41:47] fellowship with them but when you start
[41:50] accepting their
[41:52] Doctrine you got a different God and
[41:55] there's not a church in town that's got
[41:57] to say same Doctrine or same
[41:59] God Amen because they have three
[42:02] gods and many other things amen so we
[42:06] have to be careful with these things
[42:08] amen and even even on that same line you
[42:10] watch this you know when and and I I
[42:12] know I I I kill this one but you know
[42:14] even in in Genesis when God made us in
[42:17] His image and there was a male and
[42:19] female part um feminine part in the man
[42:22] and God blessed them both I want I want
[42:24] to tell you something this morning and
[42:26] this might shock you and I can back this
[42:28] up by the Bible and the message and I'm
[42:31] going to give you a message example and
[42:32] this is not in my notes but this is free
[42:34] but your wife can hear from
[42:37] God and your wife can be more right than
[42:41] the head of the house you want an
[42:43] example brother bram's wife brother
[42:45] braham's wife told Brother Bram to go
[42:48] preach to the Pentecostal
[42:51] people she said honey go and I'll
[42:53] support
[42:55] you and brother brandom listen to his
[43:01] mother-in-law now the difference is the
[43:04] head of the house you'll see that you
[43:05] know you'll make the final decision but
[43:07] don't you can never treat your wife like
[43:09] she don't got connected with God because
[43:12] she has the same exact same Holy Ghost
[43:14] as you have it took exactly the same
[43:16] Calvary as it took for you and she got
[43:18] exactly the same yes God will deal
[43:20] through the
[43:22] head but sometimes the head is
[43:26] hard
[43:28] and sometimes God will deal through a
[43:30] softer
[43:32] vessel
[43:34] heyen I don't like that either
[43:39] oucho I'd hurt all the way
[43:42] down amen so you brothers that think oh
[43:46] bless God I'm the head of my house bless
[43:47] God God speaks to me and bless God you
[43:50] know there's some pastors like that
[43:51] around the country bless God I know
[43:53] everything the people don't know nothing
[43:55] well guess
[43:56] what
[44:00] uh-huh same Holy Ghost gifts and
[44:03] callings are without repentance so your
[44:10] headship if it's
[44:14] hard amen will save a lot of problems
[44:17] amen never make a major decision in your
[44:20] life for your spiritual now of course
[44:22] you know the the wife's a weaker vessel
[44:24] like so okay but that don't mean God
[44:26] don't speak to
[44:28] her there it's different
[44:30] positions but if your wife's on the word
[44:33] of God and she's coming to you in your
[44:34] private home and she's saying honey we
[44:36] shouldn't do this because of this and
[44:37] this and this and this and God show me
[44:39] this and this this and she's doing it
[44:40] reverent and respectful and you step on
[44:43] her God you're going to get the beating
[44:44] of your
[44:46] life you're going to get the beating of
[44:48] your life I wouldn't dare goote and do
[44:51] something major I wouldn't go out and
[44:54] spend too much money on a farm let told
[44:57] to Heaven my
[45:00] wife completely on
[45:03] board I'm not moving to
[45:06] Paris without my wife coming with
[45:09] me now just think of that
[45:12] spiritually I mean it's her family too
[45:15] it's her grandkids
[45:20] too she came from
[45:22] God
[45:23] do God blessed her
[45:29] too amen oh wow that hurt help us God
[45:34] Amen we need to recognize what are we to
[45:39] God does God think to you what are you
[45:42] to him the feminine sight did he listen
[45:43] to
[45:44] you does he listen to you when you pray
[45:47] and say help me God I I don't know what
[45:50] I'm doing God but you don't listen to
[45:52] your wife a perfect thing cuz you don't
[45:55] think oh my goodness
[45:58] the Bible said that if you mistreated
[45:59] her your prayers would be hindered I
[46:01] believe that's in James or somewhere RA
[46:03] in there in the New Testament your
[46:04] prayers would be
[46:05] hindered it's because God will protect
[46:08] her amen God help us to to know this
[46:11] right amen and so we see these these
[46:15] things let me just finish this scripture
[46:18] in
[46:20] Jude and I will therefore bring you to
[46:23] remembrance though once was knew this
[46:26] how that the Lord having saved the
[46:27] people out of the land of Egypt
[46:29] afterwards destroyed them that believe
[46:31] not that's what it's saying you see see
[46:34] we we can't play once you're I me once
[46:38] you're once you realize the the the
[46:40] truth and the the message and the hour
[46:43] you can't play around with with G it the
[46:46] very thought that you would have an
[46:47] appetite for
[46:49] garbage would hinder your inheritance
[46:52] the Bible says that if you love the
[46:53] world or the things of the world the
[46:55] love of God's Not In You you know there
[46:57] was people like watch this brother Brown
[46:59] said that Elvis
[47:02] Presley sold his
[47:05] Birthright cuz he like
[47:08] Cadillacs what's your
[47:11] love are you selling your
[47:14] Birthright because you want to have
[47:16] fellowship with these other people amen
[47:19] you will never be accepted in Fellowship
[47:22] of those other people they're they're
[47:24] only open to have fellowship with you
[47:27] because they want to win you to them
[47:30] amen and see God God's looking for men
[47:34] that divide not to
[47:36] compromise amen God help us
[47:39] amen see here and we we just uh just
[47:42] laying more of a foundation God the in
[47:45] Hebrews 16:4 and and I want to read some
[47:48] quotes on this but we see this this this
[47:51] actual Covenant to Abram that that God
[47:53] showed him was actually ripping the
[47:56] animals of apart and he and and he
[47:58] compared that to covenants and and and
[48:00] we'll read that but in Japan you know if
[48:02] they made a covenant they would throw
[48:04] salt on one another and it used to be
[48:06] when the Chinese families came to the
[48:08] states and they had laundry mats they
[48:10] they never knew English and so they
[48:12] would tear paper and when you came back
[48:14] you brought the piece of paper to the
[48:16] laundry mat the Covenant but in the
[48:18] Bible in in Abram's time they actually
[48:20] ripped sheep skin and goat skin and you
[48:23] would actually blend them back together
[48:25] and show that that's exactly where you
[48:27] come from and this is all talking about
[48:29] a covenant with Christ and the and the
[48:32] bride his wife that we were ripped from
[48:35] his side tore from his side and you go
[48:37] back to his side and no Minister man or
[48:41] or Creeds or dogmas or everything could
[48:44] ever contradict that you're going to fit
[48:46] together
[48:47] perfectly before the F oh it's beautiful
[48:51] Hallelujah here here in Proverbs 16:4
[48:54] the Lord hasth made all things for
[48:55] himself
[48:57] yay even the wicked for the day of
[49:01] evil God help
[49:04] us God help us here here we we really
[49:08] want to preach on election and seed and
[49:10] and every seed will bring forth of its
[49:12] kind so you know the prophet said this
[49:15] he said you know if you if you came from
[49:17] God you're going to bring forth God but
[49:20] there's ones that are born that came
[49:22] from Satan and they're going to bring
[49:24] forth Satan and we see this here in in
[49:26] Genesis 3:15 and I will put enmity
[49:28] between thee and the woman and between
[49:31] thy seed and her seed and I will bruise
[49:34] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[49:38] seeing that God is separating the Beast
[49:40] here now here we just just forgive me
[49:43] for slowing down but I just want to
[49:45] catch some quotes here here in the mark
[49:47] of the beast the Seal of God he said the
[49:49] dove did you know that the dove will
[49:53] never you'll never see a dove taking a
[49:55] bath see you'll never see watch the
[49:58] typee here you'll never see a Christian
[50:00] bathing in worldly Traditions they might
[50:03] fall and make a mistake but they'll
[50:04] never be lavishing in the garbage amen
[50:08] you'll never see a dove caught taking a
[50:10] bath why because he don't have to he
[50:12] said he's clean from the inside through
[50:15] his feathers he has oil in his inside
[50:17] and it cleanses him from the inside the
[50:19] Holy
[50:20] Ghost cleanses him he said that's the
[50:23] way the real churches he said they don't
[50:24] have to be bed up and go back about this
[50:28] or another he said they got the oil the
[50:30] Holy Ghost Inside every believer and it
[50:33] keeps them clean from the world Amen you
[50:36] should be concerned if if the world has
[50:39] any attraction at all to you it should
[50:42] it should drive you to your altar in
[50:44] your closet and search out with God
[50:48] what's going on Amen oh if we could just
[50:51] preach the lamb and the dove sometime he
[50:55] said the Holy Ghost Inside the believer
[50:58] keeping him clean amen see the dove has
[51:01] no G and he said he could never eat
[51:03] anything on clean he said it could never
[51:05] taste of the world just like a real
[51:07] Christian he said blessed is The Man
[51:09] David said in the Bible blessed is the
[51:11] man who
[51:13] God will not impute
[51:16] sin Hallelujah whose name is in the
[51:19] Lamb's Book of Life amen and we just see
[51:22] these things and so if we we move Jump
[51:25] Ahead here
[51:29] uh let me just read this scripture
[51:31] before we do in Matthew 3:16 and 17 here
[51:35] here Jesus is coming to to John in the
[51:38] water and the water is the type of the
[51:40] Holy Ghost and here we have the prophet
[51:43] himself and the word of God walking and
[51:45] here they're looking eye to eye in the
[51:47] water and the thing and Jesus comes to
[51:49] be
[51:50] baptized and and up straight way out of
[51:53] the water and lo the heavens opened
[51:55] before him and he saw the the spirit of
[51:57] God
[51:58] descending like a dove and it was
[52:01] lightning on him and the voice came out
[52:02] of Heaven saying this is my beloved
[52:05] Son in whom I'm well pleased see a dove
[52:08] was always a gentle spirit and that you
[52:11] know our Prophet said this he said as
[52:12] you as a Believer if you go in a place
[52:16] that a believer's not
[52:20] welcome he said the dove won't go with
[52:23] you he said the dove will wait
[52:25] outside
[52:30] amen that's a very strong
[52:34] terminology let me let me just show you
[52:36] something and I I I I this is this is
[52:39] kind of heavy so just you forgive me for
[52:42] this part but I just have to be truthful
[52:44] that's why I believe so strongly about
[52:45] homeschooling or Christian
[52:49] schools because I don't care how much
[52:50] your token is over that child you know
[52:53] the holy spirit's not welcome there I
[52:56] don't like that
[52:58] either uh and your Prophet said he will
[53:02] wait
[53:03] outside if your holy spirit will wait
[53:06] outside then what do you think that your
[53:08] Holy Spirit over your children's token
[53:10] will
[53:11] do
[53:14] amen you know we we're coming into an
[53:17] evil age and God's left us here for a
[53:19] reason and our light's got to shine I
[53:21] know I know everything's a progress and
[53:22] I know you know I'm not saying everybody
[53:25] can homeschool but if you can homeschool
[53:27] look for a Christian school or or we
[53:30] need to do radical things to stay clean
[53:33] radical things because we're A peculiar
[53:35] people and no different than you can't
[53:38] go to the same school with those with
[53:40] the devil you can't go to the devil's
[53:42] Church would you go to the Satan's
[53:45] Tabernacle there's no
[53:48] difference well I can show that by the
[53:50] Bible because the prophet said that
[53:52] every government of the country is
[53:53] controlled by
[53:54] Satan amen
[53:58] amen here we see in a uh in uh oh I
[54:02] can't even say this word where it's
[54:03] Grace preached from honey the book and
[54:06] uh
[54:07] Zachariah here Zachariah came to the
[54:10] prophet here in a vision and and he was
[54:11] talking about how Grace was see this was
[54:14] Abraham's Grace was come down here and
[54:17] and I'm going to read a quote from that
[54:18] but I just want to jump ahead to
[54:20] Zechariah and here in the
[54:24] uh Zechariah 2 5 and 8 here he said for
[54:28] for I saith for I saith the Lord will be
[54:33] be her wall be your wall of fire around
[54:36] about you and will be the glory in the
[54:38] midst of you and and verse eight for
[54:42] thus sayith the Lord of hosts after the
[54:44] glory hath I sent unto after the glory
[54:48] hath he sent me unto the Nations which
[54:51] spoil thee for he that touches uh the
[54:57] is the apple of my eye I'm getting an EO
[55:00] up here Amy I don't know what
[55:02] happened amen here here God was showing
[55:05] the grace to Abram and here he's showing
[55:07] it in Zachariah he's shown the same
[55:09] Grace and if we just jump to uh uh down
[55:13] farther in uh and let's read Zechariah 3
[55:17] and we're going to read a few verses one
[55:18] and two there and he said and he
[55:21] said he showed me Joshua the high priest
[55:24] standing before the angel of the Lord
[55:25] and Satan standing right on his right
[55:28] hand resisting him and the Lord said
[55:31] unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee Oh Satan
[55:35] even the Lord which has chosen Jerusalem
[55:37] this is spiritual Jerusalem rebuke thee
[55:41] is not this the band plucked out of the
[55:45] fire and verse eight he said he now oh
[55:48] Joshua the high priest thou art thy
[55:51] fellows that sit before thee for they
[55:54] are men that wandered out
[55:58] for behold I will bring forth my servant
[56:01] the branch now praise God for the
[56:04] message up because here our Prophet
[56:05] breaks us down and this branch that the
[56:08] God's telling Joshua that he's going to
[56:10] bring forth is Christ amen and that was
[56:14] all the type of the Covenant to Abraham
[56:16] was was the the great token that Christ
[56:19] was going to do on calary for his
[56:21] believer so this branch is Christ now we
[56:23] read verse 9 and behold the stone that's
[56:26] in engraved with the gravings thereof
[56:28] thus sayith the Lord of hosts I will
[56:30] remove the iniquities out of the land
[56:32] one day we we see this this great Stone
[56:37] and and this stone is Grace Grace here
[56:40] in in in the same chapter and or or
[56:44] chapter 4 sorry verse 7 and who art thou
[56:46] old great Mountain before zerubabel Thou
[56:49] shalt become a plane he's knocking down
[56:52] the evil ways and thou shalt bring forth
[56:54] The Headstone Christ shouting Grace
[56:58] Grace Grace now I want to look into the
[57:01] breach
[57:04] here the breach of the seven Church
[57:07] ages and let's look at this scripture
[57:10] here that brother Brown says he's
[57:12] talking about Zechariah
[57:14] here chapter 3 and 8 and
[57:17] n and he said the stones that have seven
[57:20] eyes on them behold I will engrave them
[57:24] and watch what he says these are
[57:27] in the paragraph he said this the eyes
[57:29] are meanings of the prophet and his
[57:33] bride it's a proph he says that in
[57:35] paragraph 237 in the breach and and this
[57:38] is a 63 message he said what is it he
[57:41] said it's Christ and his bride in the
[57:44] seven Church ages he said it's out there
[57:46] and the Seven prophets that went forth
[57:48] are the seers and the eyes of the last
[57:51] time he said now notice it's see it's
[57:54] wrote in the Bible in symbols that you
[57:56] won't understand and so here the prophet
[57:58] says he said you notice it's not an
[58:00] amnel at all he said he took the book
[58:03] and the right hand and sat on the throne
[58:05] he said who is it he said it's the owner
[58:07] the original owner of the book of
[58:10] redemption oh hallelujah amen it's an
[58:13] amazing story here in predestination and
[58:17] you'll see this when
[58:19] uh when if you went back to Abram and
[58:23] here this is this is a just an amazing
[58:26] part here in our first scripture that we
[58:28] read we stopped at verse 10 but let's
[58:30] just carry on I'm going to read a quote
[58:32] here in uh Genesis uh 15 and verse 11
[58:36] and here Abram when when when they tore
[58:39] the carcasses apart God had told them
[58:41] what to do for the Covenant and he tore
[58:43] the carcasses apart and and this is so
[58:46] much like us in our flesh trying to
[58:48] serve God and Abram went out and he
[58:50] tried to chase the birds off in verse 11
[58:53] to chase the doves off the the the bird
[58:56] words like he was going to do something
[58:58] for being saved and God brought the sun
[59:01] down and a and a great deep sleep fell
[59:04] on Abram in verse
[59:07] 12 and darkness fell over him and he
[59:11] said to Abram he said know assuredly
[59:13] that the seed thy seed watch this
[59:15] predestination election thy seed shall
[59:18] be a stranger in a land that's not
[59:20] theirs this was Israel in Egypt and they
[59:23] shall serve them and they shall afflict
[59:26] them around 400 years and and also that
[59:30] Nation whom Thou shalt serve I will
[59:33] judge and afterwards I will bring them
[59:36] out with the great substance this is God
[59:39] talking about the children of Israel
[59:41] where they were in Egypt and he's and
[59:43] he's and he's showing Abram how they
[59:45] were going to be there for 400 years but
[59:48] God through Amazing Grace was going to
[59:50] bring them out and and do a mighty work
[59:52] and bring them out with a great
[59:55] substance and take him to the promised
[59:57] land let me show you what that means in
[59:59] today's standard he said we're living in
[1:00:03] leoan and the world's gone completely
[1:00:05] insane but you're not going to barely
[1:00:08] make
[1:00:09] it you see what I mean spiritually
[1:00:11] you're going to go in thriving you're
[1:00:14] going to go you're not going to go in
[1:00:15] like oh bless God I'm barely oh I can
[1:00:17] barely pray no you're going to go in
[1:00:19] like a soier with your head up you're
[1:00:21] going to be great substance with great
[1:00:24] royalty and because it's it's all
[1:00:26] spiritual it's Christ doing it has
[1:00:28] nothing to do with us cuz see Abraham is
[1:00:32] asleep he said watch this he and and
[1:00:34] when the prophet we're going to look in
[1:00:35] this quote right now he said God put
[1:00:37] Abraham to sleep to show him one thing
[1:00:39] and he's showing us the same thing you
[1:00:41] got nothing to do with it just surrender
[1:00:44] to God Amen go to sleep God's got
[1:00:47] everything in control so that's the same
[1:00:49] thing today when you're looking at the
[1:00:51] news it's completely Insanity it's
[1:00:54] straight from the ped hell but you can
[1:00:57] go to sleep and rest in complete peace
[1:01:00] that he's not going to just save
[1:01:02] you not going to just say you're not
[1:01:04] going to just barely make it you're
[1:01:06] going in with a great heritance and the
[1:01:10] substance of your the world is yours in
[1:01:13] Christ's name amen it's thought that
[1:01:15] were looking for Rich I'm just saying
[1:01:17] your pride your life your dignity your
[1:01:19] your your your Purity your Holiness amen
[1:01:23] no man will see God without Holiness
[1:01:25] you're not not going to be a you're not
[1:01:27] going to be slobbered with garbage of
[1:01:29] this world on you you're not going to
[1:01:31] sell your birth
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:35] Hallelujah th this is a this is a great
[1:01:37] quote and and and I I I I ask for your
[1:01:40] forgiveness ahead of time but we have to
[1:01:42] slow down and read this because the
[1:01:44] prophet explains it
[1:01:47] amazingly he said here's Abram and he
[1:01:49] said Lord How will I know that it's your
[1:01:54] will this is in jeh a dry message and he
[1:01:58] said God said unto him he said your seed
[1:02:01] will be as the dust of the
[1:02:05] earth and he said but I don't have any
[1:02:08] seed at all see you you don't think that
[1:02:11] you you man your children are your
[1:02:14] heritage your children are your
[1:02:17] seed Abra God's God's God s to Abram he
[1:02:21] said I'm going to bless you with seed
[1:02:23] you don't even have you don't have to
[1:02:25] fear the seed that God's already give
[1:02:28] you amen oh it's beautiful here and he
[1:02:32] said now look up to heaven in another
[1:02:33] place and he said look at the stars and
[1:02:35] he said try to number them and he said
[1:02:38] and the dust of the stars and he
[1:02:40] said this Bible is perfect and brother
[1:02:43] Bram being a prophet Jesus broke down he
[1:02:46] said when God looked had Abram look at
[1:02:48] the dust and the Stars you know what the
[1:02:51] prophet said that spoke of redemption
[1:02:53] Amazing Grace from Earth to to Heaven
[1:02:56] Earth to Heaven it speaks of Amazing
[1:02:58] Grace he said you see it his spiritual
[1:03:00] mind ought to be able to pick that up
[1:03:01] quickly he said from the dust to the
[1:03:03] Stars he said he's the he's I can hardly
[1:03:06] read he said he's a chief Morning Star
[1:03:09] he's the the lily of the valley he's the
[1:03:11] feris of 10,000 he's all these things
[1:03:14] he's my kids and Redeemer and he's going
[1:03:16] to bring you out in a great
[1:03:19] hand and he said on to Abram he said
[1:03:21] come here and I'll show you and he and
[1:03:23] he and he told him what to do to to
[1:03:25] bring the halfer tear the halfer apart
[1:03:27] tear the goat apart this all speaks of
[1:03:29] Calvary tear the ram apart and he said
[1:03:31] he he never separated the dove cuz that
[1:03:33] spoke of
[1:03:35] healing and he said watch this and he
[1:03:37] said now we have to get to this sometime
[1:03:40] he said I'll show you something he said
[1:03:41] I'm kind of a typologist and he said I
[1:03:44] like types and shadows and he said now
[1:03:46] if you look at the name of Jesus and the
[1:03:49] five species Jesus name has five in it
[1:03:53] it speaks of Grace it speaks of many
[1:03:55] many things but he said what it was
[1:03:58] speaking of was the sacrifice to come
[1:04:02] the the very the very God that told
[1:04:04] Abraham to take these animals and rip
[1:04:06] them apart was talking of Christ to come
[1:04:09] the perfect sacrifice that would be
[1:04:11] ripped apart for him now think of the a
[1:04:13] the promise that God gave Abram under a
[1:04:17] under a imperfect
[1:04:19] sacrifice amen that you'll find that in
[1:04:22] Hebrews what is it 12 or 13 said look
[1:04:24] all the great Apostles and look at all
[1:04:26] the people what they did the Miracles
[1:04:27] they did the Holy Ghost wasn't even
[1:04:29] given
[1:04:31] wow unbelievable but true he said you
[1:04:35] look at the five different species it's
[1:04:36] Jesus speaking of the sacrifice scum and
[1:04:38] he said the three of them were chopped
[1:04:40] up in pieces J
[1:04:43] Jes and the other now he has this a
[1:04:46] capital letter this is right from our
[1:04:47] prophet and he said the other was us
[1:04:53] us Jesus and you
[1:04:57] he said was not separated it couldn't be
[1:05:00] separated it was part of the
[1:05:05] remember and Jehovah Gyra elect elected
[1:05:09] ones I'm this is a direct quote I'm
[1:05:11] reading directed on elected ones
[1:05:13] salvation saving
[1:05:16] us uh
[1:05:20] Inseparable and the entire Bride of the
[1:05:23] Living God was Inseparable regardless he
[1:05:25] said regardless of what denominational
[1:05:28] barriers may may try to separate there
[1:05:31] was one the bride was of one heart and
[1:05:34] he said I don't care what they are he
[1:05:36] said there wasn't he wasn't any
[1:05:38] separated it was Jesus Jehovah's elect
[1:05:42] salvation saves us because us is in
[1:05:47] Jesus that's what our prophet's saying
[1:05:48] he said now he said do you get it he
[1:05:50] said it's his elected ones following
[1:05:53] through Isaac coming out of the great
[1:05:56] one Christ and he said then you'll
[1:05:58] notice here and he's talking about uh
[1:06:01] Believers I can't even say it was an Old
[1:06:02] Church Believers in the past that they
[1:06:04] believed they were saved by works and he
[1:06:06] said Brethren I don't mean to rub this
[1:06:08] in now but he said you can just watch
[1:06:10] this real close and he said I'll show
[1:06:12] you it's not by
[1:06:17] works but your germ this is a paradox
[1:06:21] you got you got to bring this really
[1:06:23] close because even though ain't by works
[1:06:27] your germ will dictate what you
[1:06:29] are when I plant corn in the spring I
[1:06:32] don't expect a wheat field and when I
[1:06:35] splant Christ I don't expect the
[1:06:41] devil see the B it's really close can
[1:06:45] you say well I can just do any then it's
[1:06:47] a disgrace it's Grace to a disgrace well
[1:06:50] I can sin and God bless God you know he
[1:06:53] knows I'm his and no
[1:06:56] what God planted will come forth amen
[1:07:00] amen and he said so I can show you it's
[1:07:03] not by works it's by Grace by election
[1:07:05] by for knowledge it's God that does the
[1:07:07] saving and this is and he Compares this
[1:07:10] back to Abram when he went to sleep he
[1:07:12] said you have nothing to do with it now
[1:07:15] I want to reize this because we we need
[1:07:17] this for all of us myself included this
[1:07:19] don't give you a bill to
[1:07:22] sin this don't give you a bill to sin if
[1:07:25] if you feel like it gives you a build of
[1:07:26] sin it just proves that you never were
[1:07:29] in the first place see you know once in
[1:07:31] a while you know for me I in the farm
[1:07:34] and and and I'm just coming off here for
[1:07:36] a minute to show you something I grow
[1:07:38] whiteye beans and they're IP beans and
[1:07:41] they go to Japan and
[1:07:43] China and they make tofu with it and
[1:07:46] it's high in protein and it's
[1:07:48] disgusting don't stop eating beef
[1:07:51] because woo you will not like it near as
[1:07:54] much I promise you I seen it all and it
[1:07:58] looks like butterscotch puding but
[1:07:59] tastes a lot worse a lot worse and if
[1:08:03] You' seen how they ferment that in
[1:08:05] barrels and and water and whatever oh
[1:08:09] wow you know when I worked at the
[1:08:12] elevator nobody wanted to clean out the
[1:08:15] bean pits because rotten
[1:08:19] soybeans whoa it makes pigs smell smell
[1:08:22] like flowers it's the most powerful poon
[1:08:26] than you ever did see rotten beans are
[1:08:29] powerful soybeans but watch this but
[1:08:33] we're always concerned because one black
[1:08:37] eye one black eye in my seed will
[1:08:42] produce One stock of black ice and when
[1:08:46] I take a semi to the elevator and I'm
[1:08:48] getting $4 a bushel premium because I'm
[1:08:51] part of the bride and they find one
[1:08:54] black eye it's condemned
[1:08:59] you see what I mean so you can't hang
[1:09:02] around the world you ain't going to be a
[1:09:04] part of the world you're going to want
[1:09:06] pure seed you're going to want to hang
[1:09:07] around Pure White bride of Christ you
[1:09:09] see what I'm saying because see that
[1:09:11] other black eye can be a Roundup Ready
[1:09:13] it's genetically modified and they won't
[1:09:16] accept it in their
[1:09:19] country and it'll cost you eternal
[1:09:22] life amen and you know but our job when
[1:09:26] you look at this and you look at it
[1:09:27] natural and now our Prophet said right
[1:09:29] in here he loved typology so I'm in good
[1:09:31] hands here he said watch this you know
[1:09:33] when we plant in the
[1:09:34] spring too much Holy Ghost will drown
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:39] plant too much water will kill it
[1:09:43] dead is it good oh yeah it's good you
[1:09:45] can eat it you're mature you can eat
[1:09:48] steak but a babe can't they'll choke to
[1:09:51] death they'll drowned they'll drowned in
[1:09:54] their own throat here because their
[1:09:57] ticker ain't made yet to kick it down
[1:10:01] but our job this is our job in this day
[1:10:05] and our Prophet said we would be
[1:10:06] actually held accountable for it and and
[1:10:09] the best way I can explain this is
[1:10:10] naturally and especially in corn he said
[1:10:13] when you got to have the soil Your
[1:10:16] Atmosphere you if you don't think this
[1:10:18] town's watching you you're you're
[1:10:19] greatly deceived but the even the the
[1:10:22] your workplace and different ones have
[1:10:24] told me about your workplace but your
[1:10:26] ground has to be so perfect see if it's
[1:10:30] lumpy the the atmosphere won't be around
[1:10:32] the the predestinated seed that ain't
[1:10:34] shown yet but it has to be nice and fine
[1:10:38] and you got to have just the right
[1:10:40] amount of Holy Ghost moisture in that
[1:10:41] moisture and there's a special word that
[1:10:43] science calls it for the seeds to all
[1:10:45] germinate at the same
[1:10:47] time and see they need to all germinate
[1:10:50] they they call it you know what they
[1:10:52] call it in the natural they call it seed
[1:10:54] to soil conver
[1:10:56] conversion in the spiritual they call it
[1:10:58] Christ
[1:10:59] conversion it's called The Bride to
[1:11:01] Christ conversion and what we have to do
[1:11:05] and that's why our worship should be
[1:11:07] just lose your mind drunk but you have
[1:11:11] to create an atmosphere so when when a
[1:11:14] predestinated seed walking by the
[1:11:16] sidewalk and they feel the power of the
[1:11:18] Holy Ghost by exactly the right amount
[1:11:21] of water and exactly the right amount of
[1:11:23] clay and the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:11:25] Ghost comes out they couldn't help but
[1:11:27] bring forth life they would just
[1:11:30] explode because it happens it's just
[1:11:33] it's just it's predestination it's just
[1:11:35] God's thing and our job to find the last
[1:11:39] seed is create an atmosphere our job
[1:11:41] ain't to decide who it is and who it Ain
[1:11:44] but if we create the atmosphere see so
[1:11:46] when you have the atmosphere around you
[1:11:49] you you'll have people come out oh I
[1:11:50] didn't mean to say that I I I didn't
[1:11:52] realize you were here when they swear or
[1:11:55] something at work or there's something
[1:11:56] or you know what
[1:11:58] amen because they know there's a
[1:12:01] different atmosphere there and so watch
[1:12:03] this so when they're going to ready tell
[1:12:05] a dirty joke and they oh oh well you
[1:12:06] know I can't tell that because soeno was
[1:12:10] here see if if that atmosphere don't
[1:12:13] affect them then they don't have a germ
[1:12:15] of
[1:12:16] life but if it does that's the only
[1:12:19] thing that God will hold us requir for
[1:12:22] uh eligible was for creating an
[1:12:24] atmosphere but we need to be taught and
[1:12:26] to learn the right way we can't just
[1:12:28] drown them normally most of us because
[1:12:30] of our first love and because how much
[1:12:32] we love Christ we just smother people to
[1:12:35] death and they're
[1:12:36] like he said I'll hold you down a little
[1:12:39] longer you'll learn to swim no you'll
[1:12:42] drown man so when I go I'm sorry to tell
[1:12:46] you this but like when I go to the
[1:12:48] cornfield I don't plant when it's too
[1:12:50] wet I don't plant when there's too much
[1:12:52] Holy
[1:12:54] Ghost my old daddy you know he had great
[1:12:57] eight but he died a multi-millionaire
[1:12:59] because he'd go out to the ground he'd
[1:13:00] just kick it with his foot and he said
[1:13:01] give me a hunk of that dirt be when he
[1:13:03] was so old he couldn't bend down he just
[1:13:05] crumbled
[1:13:06] that I was like Christ he's crumbling
[1:13:10] the curs in his hand and our Prophet
[1:13:12] said in questions and answers in 50 57
[1:13:16] he said God would that none would perish
[1:13:18] but he knew because he was omnipotent he
[1:13:20] knew that not all would follow him and
[1:13:22] he was creting an atmosphere in his head
[1:13:24] he said oh he said I think you better go
[1:13:26] get the cator he says I'm all ready to
[1:13:33] plant but they're Jehovah God and that's
[1:13:36] the only thing he'll he'll hold us you
[1:13:38] know what it's not our job to decide
[1:13:40] who's bride and who ain't bride it's our
[1:13:43] job to make an atmosphere for the ones
[1:13:45] that get thirsty that they'll they'll
[1:13:47] they'll need to quench their thirst and
[1:13:49] the ones that will be so salty and our
[1:13:51] light will be so bright that they'll
[1:13:53] like they'll take their sunglasses off
[1:13:54] and they'll say I want what that Hunter
[1:13:56] said the meanest man why the prophet
[1:13:58] hunted with the meanest man there ever
[1:14:00] was he said give me I said I'm losing my
[1:14:03] I said give he throw his gun
[1:14:06] down he said give me this Jesus that
[1:14:09] you're you're shown me before now the
[1:14:11] now watch this the prophet never
[1:14:12] preached to
[1:14:14] him I'll even I'll even clarify
[1:14:18] that the prophet only went with him
[1:14:20] because he was a good guide and he
[1:14:21] didn't get lost in the
[1:14:24] mountains
[1:14:27] but he created an
[1:14:29] atmosphere that if there was any germ
[1:14:32] any
[1:14:33] germ it I see a germ in an
[1:14:37] atmosphere cannot stop it's it's
[1:14:40] physical imposs when I I keep my seed
[1:14:42] over for a year I take it out of the
[1:14:44] atmosphere so it won't grow
[1:14:47] prematurely but when it hits the
[1:14:49] atmosphere of the temperature and the
[1:14:50] moisture and the and the
[1:14:54] ground
[1:14:57] quality I couldn't stop that from
[1:14:59] growing the prophet talked about he said
[1:15:01] you can pour a sidewalk over the grass
[1:15:02] and that grass that's all under the
[1:15:04] sidewalk come up and there'll be the W
[1:15:05] ther because you can't stop
[1:15:09] life but are we making an
[1:15:11] atmosphere for the life to
[1:15:14] grow
[1:15:16] amen help me help me God man watch this
[1:15:20] how he said he
[1:15:23] said he said
[1:15:25] uh he said you don't have nothing to do
[1:15:28] with it it's not him that willth here
[1:15:30] this is in Romans 9:16 if you want to
[1:15:33] know the scripture he said it's not him
[1:15:34] that willth or him that runneth but God
[1:15:37] that showeth mercy and Abram came down
[1:15:40] here on the side of the hill and he and
[1:15:41] he W and he was chasing the birds off
[1:15:43] I'm still reading this quote and they
[1:15:44] were piled up together and he he kept
[1:15:47] the birds off of his sacrifice he was he
[1:15:49] was keeping the bird he was keeping
[1:15:51] Satan off his life he was doing it all
[1:15:53] by works and God made a deep that's what
[1:15:56] the prophet says he said he made a deep
[1:15:58] sleep fallowing
[1:16:00] Abraham and now you haven't got nothing
[1:16:02] to do with it like Abraham he said I'm
[1:16:04] just going to shut you out here's God
[1:16:06] talking to Abraham he said I'm just
[1:16:08] going to shut you out and show you it's
[1:16:10] nothing to do with you at all or what
[1:16:13] you even want he's that's where you can
[1:16:15] see and brother Brown says this in
[1:16:17] question is answer because somebody
[1:16:18] directly ask him he said would your free
[1:16:20] moral agency will override God's
[1:16:23] predestinated plan he said
[1:16:25] never oh praise God for that cuz even
[1:16:29] when you make a mistake even a big
[1:16:33] mistake that's amazing grace hallelujah
[1:16:40] hallelujah he said I'm just going to
[1:16:42] shut you oh here he said it's here here
[1:16:45] he said I'm just going to shut you out
[1:16:46] and show you it's nothing what you do
[1:16:48] what you can do or what you want to do
[1:16:50] he said it's me Christ doing it I'm
[1:16:53] doing the saving you know we see that
[1:16:56] scripture we read a couple weeks ago
[1:16:57] where it's only God that has the right
[1:16:59] to judge it's only God that has the
[1:17:01] right to give life or take life oh
[1:17:04] that's beautiful save him when he
[1:17:06] started and he told him that he would
[1:17:08] come in his old age the seed would come
[1:17:10] in his old
[1:17:11] age and he saved his seed after him and
[1:17:14] God Did It by Sovereign Grace and so
[1:17:17] watch I mentioned this before this quote
[1:17:19] i' in studying I say it ahead of time he
[1:17:21] said so what are you scared
[1:17:23] about and and I'm preaching to myself
[1:17:26] this morning because when you the the
[1:17:28] the I I would advise you and man the
[1:17:33] world's you know don't watch too much
[1:17:36] news watch just enough to know that
[1:17:38] we're going in Rapture soon but
[1:17:41] wo you know I remember Jared saying
[1:17:44] during Co that there was so much going
[1:17:46] on it was hard to
[1:17:48] focus it it's actually a war going on in
[1:17:51] our mind see like we have to plant our
[1:17:54] potatoes but I don't think I'll be here
[1:17:55] to harvest them and and we're going home
[1:17:58] soon because we can see the season on
[1:18:00] does it matter that we're sighting the
[1:18:01] church and we're going to try to keep
[1:18:02] the heat bill in but but we're still
[1:18:06] here and and so like every day you wake
[1:18:08] up it's just
[1:18:10] like should I it's more for an
[1:18:13] entrepreneur because you you plan your
[1:18:15] life way ahead should I be buying a farm
[1:18:17] or selling a farm or does it even
[1:18:22] matter you know the prophet preach and
[1:18:25] you go back and look at that he said no
[1:18:26] continuing City he said we can't build
[1:18:28] Our Hope on this Earth nothing will last
[1:18:32] on this Earth You know when I see things
[1:18:33] all the time that change in the the farm
[1:18:35] world it's just unbelievable you know
[1:18:37] some of the country companies that were
[1:18:39] multi-trillion look at Sears who would
[1:18:41] have believed Sears would go
[1:18:43] broke there's no continuing City I think
[1:18:46] in the farming industry quality swine
[1:18:48] they used to buy all the weener pigs
[1:18:49] across Canada billion doll
[1:18:52] company chapter 11 bankruptcy
[1:18:55] the farmer Sid stepped them went
[1:18:56] directly into Partnerships and no
[1:18:59] continuing City you can go by the school
[1:19:02] you went to school it's probably closed
[1:19:03] and and just on and on the prophet
[1:19:05] preached about that he said you know
[1:19:06] we're looking for a city and Builder
[1:19:08] whose maker is God and and you know I I
[1:19:11] I keep thinking oh man there's so many
[1:19:14] and I I'm off my topic completely but I
[1:19:16] want to show you something I've talked
[1:19:17] to the neighboring and they're they're
[1:19:19] just full of kindness and and I I really

[1:19:24] mean God's doing amazing things and
[1:19:27] they're the backbone of this uh you know
[1:19:30] the interior stuff

[1:20:03] we can't survive here I I'm sorry for
[1:20:06] you if you don't believe the Rapture is
[1:20:07] happening but there's things happening

[1:20:11] Earth hello
[1:20:16] hello you know that they passed January
[1:20:18] 9th that it's against the federal law to
[1:20:20] read the the scriptures in public in
[1:20:23] Canada against the law it's against the
[1:20:26] law for a pastor parent to counsel
[1:20:28] somebody for things that are very
[1:20:30] Premier in Canada right now it's 5 years
[1:20:32] prison
[1:20:34] sentence that's including in
[1:20:37] church if somebody came to me and asked
[1:20:39] counsel and then they went and reported
[1:20:41] me you could see me behind bars next
[1:20:45] Sunday we can't stay here we cannot
[1:20:49] survive in this atmosphere but at the
[1:20:51] same time God chose to protect us here
[1:20:55] and it's supernaturally so it's a battle
[1:20:58] in our head and we just have to we still
[1:21:00] have to go on and have families and
[1:21:02] plant our potatoes and and that's what
[1:21:03] our Prophet told us and because I mean
[1:21:06] maybe maybe we will be here 20 years
[1:21:08] from now I don't see how we could but we
[1:21:11] have but God will we know this that
[1:21:14] we're going to go out with great
[1:21:16] substance amen we know that we're going
[1:21:19] out with great substance we're not just
[1:21:21] going to barely survive the Rapture
[1:21:23] there will be a Supernatural protection
[1:21:26] on those you know the prophet said that
[1:21:27] the plagues and the things that would
[1:21:29] come on the word the world at the end
[1:21:31] times would never touch them with the
[1:21:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost God has a
[1:21:36] supernatural thing and so then he comes
[1:21:38] here he says what are you scared
[1:21:40] about that's a battle brother Dale deals
[1:21:43] with what are we worrying about well
[1:21:46] just about everything God in the
[1:21:51] world just about
[1:21:53] everything he said 'what are you scared
[1:21:56] about he said 'what's the matter with
[1:21:57] the church today he said you're afraid
[1:21:59] he said ' don't be afraid he said ' if
[1:22:02] God be for you then who can be against
[1:22:04] you that's Romans 8:31 Romans 8:31 he
[1:22:07] said
[1:22:08] stop being
[1:22:11] afraid well I think he was preaching
[1:22:13] right to me that was whenever how many
[1:22:14] years ago he said take his word and let
[1:22:16] the Holy Spirit come into your life so
[1:22:19] so and it and so it you won't be feeble
[1:22:22] anymore and let it wake up the
[1:22:25] realization that the very hour you're
[1:22:27] living in and the time that you're
[1:22:29] living in he said watch Christ he said
[1:22:33] Abraham God put him
[1:22:36] asleep to move him right out of the
[1:22:38] picture now watch this it's just like
[1:22:39] God saying now now watch this this is
[1:22:41] Abram he put to sleep because he was
[1:22:43] keeping the birds off the carcass the
[1:22:44] sacrifice it's just like he's saying
[1:22:46] don't watch the news just don't worry
[1:22:48] about nothing because I got everything
[1:22:50] in control and he does and he does but
[1:22:54] we we have a battle
[1:22:56] on in our head he said now you ain't got
[1:22:59] nothing to do with it Abram he said I'm
[1:23:01] just going to shut you out I'm going to
[1:23:03] read this quote and and stop amen he
[1:23:05] said I'm just going to shut you out he
[1:23:06] said it's not what you can do oh sorry
[1:23:09] com went up above
[1:23:13] sorry he said he put Abram to sleep he
[1:23:16] said you're out of the picture now and
[1:23:17] he said then as soon as he did that
[1:23:19] Abram fell asleep and he said it came
[1:23:21] the great Darkness think of the evil of
[1:23:22] the age he said the Great Dark which
[1:23:24] means death and every Mortal must come
[1:23:26] to this place is death he said it came
[1:23:29] to the smoking furnace that's what he
[1:23:30] talks about in the in the and the
[1:23:32] scriptures the Smokey thermos and it was
[1:23:34] hell where the Sinners would go I'm just
[1:23:37] going to finish this quote and we'll
[1:23:38] we'll close on this he said now today he
[1:23:42] said when you and me make a covenant and
[1:23:43] he talks about that I'm just going to
[1:23:45] jump through that we already mentioned
[1:23:47] that he talked about how our covenant
[1:23:48] like we would we would buy when I bought
[1:23:50] the girl's house you know uh we didn't
[1:23:53] have nothing on paper paper the guy come
[1:23:55] up and and we we agreed on the phone to
[1:23:57] a price and and uh he said you got the
[1:24:00] money and I'll take this much and six
[1:24:03] months later and there was people in and
[1:24:04] mooving the house and they were having a
[1:24:05] heart attack and I
[1:24:07] said what's the problem they said but
[1:24:09] you ain't got nothing signed I said well
[1:24:10] we agreed he said but but it ain't on
[1:24:13] paper and I said I've known this guy
[1:24:14] since I was
[1:24:16] birthed man we're not living in that
[1:24:19] kind of a world now but it used to be
[1:24:20] like that people's word did you know the
[1:24:23] prophet said he said you're only as good
[1:24:24] as your word you shake somebody's hand
[1:24:27] you say I'll be there I'll do this I you
[1:24:28] know I agree and you know it's all set
[1:24:30] down because it was like a covenant
[1:24:33] amen God help us and he said if they
[1:24:36] would break the Covenant it was is the
[1:24:39] one that would break it would be the
[1:24:40] death would be as the death of the Beast
[1:24:44] he said that's what a oath is it's only
[1:24:46] the Covenant can manifest that both men
[1:24:49] would bring both pieces of the flesh he
[1:24:52] said now what's God doing he said he was
[1:24:54] show Abraham and and I'm I'm trying to
[1:24:56] hurry here he said he was showing
[1:24:58] Abraham how he was going to Father the
[1:25:01] Nations and through Isaac would bring
[1:25:04] would come Christ and that was Calvary
[1:25:08] god Jehovah the father would take his
[1:25:10] own son to Calvary and lay him upon the
[1:25:13] sins of the world and would tear him
[1:25:16] apart that would tear us apart from
[1:25:19] Christ oh I I pray you get part of this
[1:25:22] amen he would tear us from Christ and
[1:25:24] the and and he took his body to glory
[1:25:27] and he would set the Holy Ghost back on
[1:25:29] us and it would and then comes
[1:25:32] Redemption and the same spirit that was
[1:25:34] in Jesus would be on you and you could
[1:25:36] take the other piece of the Covenant
[1:25:38] that was actually ripped from Christ
[1:25:40] side on the calvary which was you and me
[1:25:43] there's nobody can take that from you
[1:25:46] Hallelujah and you just PST that right
[1:25:48] back together and he said he's doing the
[1:25:50] same thing that Jesus
[1:25:52] did was a covenant the signs and
[1:25:57] Jesus will have this body of Christ make
[1:26:00] his bride and there's God's covenant it
[1:26:03] was the life of Jesus that we tore out
[1:26:05] of him and he sent it back on his bride
[1:26:08] I'm going to just finish this last
[1:26:10] paragraph and he said I'm so glad to
[1:26:11] know that Jesus said if ye abide in me
[1:26:16] and my words abide in you then you can
[1:26:19] ask what you will and I'll give it unto
[1:26:21] you that's John uh 15:7
[1:26:24] that's right and he said and he that
[1:26:26] abideth in me though he is
[1:26:29] dead yet shall we live and whosoever
[1:26:33] liveth and believeth on
[1:26:35] me shall never
[1:26:38] die Hallelujah that's amazing grace
[1:26:41] she'll never die and he said that's the
[1:26:43] Eternal promise that he gave to his
[1:26:46] church the bride and the works that I do
[1:26:49] that you'll do also and Greater Works
[1:26:52] because I go to my father
[1:26:55] what a wonderful promise that is amazing
[1:26:58] grace and the and the Blackness of Leo
[1:27:01] to sin and the Blackness of politics and
[1:27:03] the Blackness of sin like like it was in
[1:27:06] in Genesis there when he's talking to
[1:27:07] Abraham he he you can rest with the Holy
[1:27:10] Ghost and go to sleep in Christ and say
[1:27:13] I don't have nothing to do with it I
[1:27:15] don't have to get gray hair from worry
[1:27:17] we're the bride of Christ should all go
[1:27:19] home this is in Paradox with your with
[1:27:22] your your original hair
[1:27:24] because you would
[1:27:27] never you see what I mean we can just
[1:27:29] surrender to Christ and he said so what
[1:27:31] do we scared
[1:27:33] about because it was all
[1:27:37] Christ and I I love that part I want to
[1:27:39] just close that part I'm going to close
[1:27:41] this I'm nowhere near the end but he
[1:27:43] said we're going to not only will he
[1:27:45] save us and not only is he not depending
[1:27:49] on our
[1:27:51] works but you're going to go out with a
[1:27:54] great substance amen that that's an
[1:27:57] amazing promise to think that we're not
[1:27:59] just going to barely slip out of here
[1:28:02] with the skin of our teeth amen I don't
[1:28:06] mean a great substance in the way of
[1:28:08] wealth I mean in the great substance
[1:28:10] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:12] the anointing of God and building an
[1:28:14] environment around I could care less
[1:28:16] about money the environment around us
[1:28:18] and our dignity and our and our Holiness
[1:28:20] and our and we can ride our head up and
[1:28:22] you can walk in town not not in an
[1:28:24] arrogant way but in a in a in a humility
[1:28:27] respectful way and say I am
[1:28:30] she the Lamb's wife amen and and some
[1:28:33] will love it and some will hate it and
[1:28:36] we need to recognize what that is it's
[1:28:39] just amazing you know there was many in
[1:28:41] the Bible that were ordained to death I
[1:28:43] just want to I'm closing really but
[1:28:46] elaser was one Pharaoh was
[1:28:50] one amen and many more
[1:28:55] that were just predestinated to death
[1:28:59] Judas a scariot was other ones that
[1:29:02] their seed was the seed of Satan brother
[1:29:05] Brown talks about that scripture both of
[1:29:08] those scriptures about 40 times in the
[1:29:10] message Hub multiple quotes you you just
[1:29:13] read it and read it and and study it and
[1:29:15] just cross reference it in but he's got
[1:29:18] everything in his hand he's got
[1:29:21] everything under control man your worry
[1:29:24] ain't going to change the world
[1:29:25] environment it's not going to change
[1:29:27] politics we don't know who's going to
[1:29:29] war with who we don't know who's winning
[1:29:31] the next election in either of our major
[1:29:33] countries and it really don't matter
[1:29:34] I'll tell you ahead of
[1:29:36] time amen it just matters that we build
[1:29:39] the atmosphere that the last
[1:29:42] predestinated seed remember
[1:29:45] this if you have the right atmosphere
[1:29:49] they can't help but grow they cannot
[1:29:52] help but grow remember the Bible says
[1:29:55] that you would be salty thirsty that
[1:29:58] make them thirsty but you would also be
[1:30:00] the light which is the the light of the
[1:30:02] Holy Ghost see when the light hit you
[1:30:03] know the prophet talking about when the
[1:30:04] light hit the seed where will that light
[1:30:06] come from
[1:30:09] you it's beautiful it's beautiful he's
[1:30:12] got it all in control let's sing that
[1:30:15] song Let's stand Hallelujah he's got it
[1:30:18] all in
[1:30:19] control when everything's Fallen apart
[1:30:22] amen the Covenant
