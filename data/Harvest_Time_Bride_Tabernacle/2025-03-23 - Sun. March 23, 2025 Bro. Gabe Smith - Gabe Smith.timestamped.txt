[29:55] sick feelings had to car stick today
[29:58] Tred to cut his hand

[30:04] clearly it's just so obvious Satan's
[30:07] trying to distract take away trying to
[30:11] amen and everything but we know he's
[30:14] defeated amen completely defeated amen
[30:18] and we just look forward to what God has
[30:20] for us all is well when the world's
[30:22] falling apart around you it's still well
[30:25] God knows exactly what he's doing it's a
[30:28] tool in his hand listening to the
[30:29] message last night in the seals he says
[30:32] those all a tool in God's hand he's just
[30:35] communist as a tool in his hand don't
[30:38] mistake in the Antichrist these other
[30:40] things are just tools he's bringing her
[30:43] all together in a big Capstone really
[30:45] soon amen hallelujah we just invite our
[30:48] brother to come and he's actually can
[30:50] come and start setting up even before we

[34:28] pastor brother Chad Lamb wanted to uh to
[34:32] greet you and um trust that um something
[34:38] will be said today to be a help to you
[34:41] on your Christian
[34:43] Journey um we uh um I know it's our
[34:48] first time uh maybe uh meeting most of
[34:52] you you know uh brother Carson and uh
[34:57] and um I I got something on my heart and
[35:01] um you know um I I kind of uh I don't
[35:06] want to say I I I I struggle with a
[35:09] little bit I I just I kept uh I kept
[35:12] asking the Lord I said like Lord you
[35:15] sure are you are you
[35:18] sure uh cuz uh you know I was thinking
[35:22] Lord that that may pinch you a little
[35:24] bit right and uh you know you you think
[35:28] well Lord I want to preach something
[35:29] good they they make them so they like me
[35:32] first before and I'll pinch them later
[35:35] you
[35:36] know but but um I I just want to I just
[35:40] want to be obedient to what the Lord uh
[35:43] has has put on my heart you know um this
[35:47] is uh this is called the house of
[35:51] correction and and and the prophet of
[35:53] God said that if we come here for any
[35:55] other reason
[35:57] yes yeah then to be corrected he said
[36:01] you why he said you coming from the
[36:03] wrong
[36:04] reason and and um and so um me as a man
[36:09] I I am certainly not here to correct you
[36:12] but I I know God's word is is sent to us
[36:17] to bring
[36:18] correction and and so I I know what what
[36:21] God has placed on my heart um has been
[36:26] uh such a um
[36:28] a um a blessing to me and uh if you uh
[36:35] if I can give it to you the way the Lord
[36:37] give it to me I know it'll be a help to
[36:40] you and so um I just want to
[36:46] um I I I do I do have PowerPoint and I
[36:50] just um I pray that it'll be a help to
[36:53] you I'm a I'm a I'm a visual kind of
[36:56] person and so
[36:58] um you know if uh if you're super
[37:00] revelated you don't need and you don't
[37:03] need uh uh images you just close your
[37:06] eyes but uh you know you know as a
[37:09] minister you I've seen a lot of times
[37:11] not not to maybe to be critical but you
[37:14] know I've seen preachers come and
[37:16] they'll they they spend most of the
[37:17] service preaching to the
[37:19] pastor right and uh and uh trying to
[37:24] show how much they know but but when
[37:27] when I when I stand behind the sacred
[37:29] desk I I'm not worried about brother
[37:32] Dale so much yeah but but but who I who
[37:37] I who I aim for is them little ones
[37:40] where their eyes is just barely over the
[37:44] pews I uh those are the ones cuz if if I
[37:48] know if I can if I can get them then I
[37:51] know you'll get something
[37:53] too because to me I believe the day is
[37:56] dark and and in in the in the hour it's
[37:59] far
[38:00] spent but but I I do believe that you
[38:03] know brother brandom he actually makes a
[38:05] statement he said maybe there's a little
[38:07] one over in Seattle Washington and and
[38:10] he says and he says the church WIll slug
[38:13] right along he said because that last
[38:15] one has to accept it and so and so um I
[38:21] I I just may be that last one is here in
[38:24] Wyoming so praise the Lord where
[38:27] whatever that last one is we just want
[38:29] to be faithful to the charge that God
[38:32] has given us and ask him that he would
[38:35] just uh help us to say something that
[38:38] would be a help so that we could all uh
[38:41] leave this world today you know brother
[38:44] Bram said we'll leave these doors either
[38:47] one of two ways that there's you
[38:50] unfortunately you pass the point of no
[38:52] return When when you made the decision
[38:55] to setep foot in this house of God this
[38:57] morning whether conscious or unconscious
[39:01] there's only one of two ways that you're
[39:03] going to leave this building sir you're
[39:05] either going to leave closer to the Lord
[39:06] or farther away from him there is there
[39:09] is no there is no middle ground you you
[39:13] you done pass the point of no return and
[39:16] so I I trust that you'll make the right
[39:18] decision and you'll surrender to what
[39:20] God has for you and you'll leave this
[39:22] building closer to the Lord and farther
[39:25] away from this world so I I just want to
[39:29] speak uh out of the Book of Luke uh if
[39:32] we could um just a very uh simple
[39:36] thought um Luke 6 uh verse
[39:41] 36 and um uh the Lord Jesus speaking
[39:46] here um and
[39:51] um maybe maybe uh maybe if we could just
[39:55] uh uh take a time and go to the 27th
[39:59] verse Luke 6:
[40:02] 27 but I say unto you which he love your
[40:06] enemies do good to them which hate you
[40:10] bless them that curse you and pray for
[40:12] them which despitefully use you and unto
[40:15] him that smiteth thee on the One Cheek
[40:17] offer also the other and him that taketh
[40:20] away thy cloak forbid not to take thy
[40:24] coat also give to every man man that
[40:28] askthe and of him that asketh uh uh ask
[40:32] and and of him that taketh away uh thy
[40:36] th thy Goods ask them not again and as
[40:41] ye would that men should do to you do
[40:43] also to them likewise for if you love
[40:47] them which love you what than have you
[40:51] for the Sinners also love those that
[40:53] love
[40:54] them if ye do good to them which do good
[40:57] to you what thank have ye for for
[41:00] Sinners also do even the
[41:02] same and if you lend to them of whom you
[41:06] hope to receive what thank have ye for
[41:10] Sinners also lend to Sinners and to
[41:12] receive as much
[41:14] again but love ye your
[41:18] enemies and do good and lend hoping for
[41:22] nothing again and your reward shall be
[41:26] great and ye shall be the children of
[41:28] the highest for he is kind unto the
[41:32] unthankful and to the
[41:34] evil be ye therefore merciful as your
[41:38] father also is merciful yes Jesus judge
[41:41] not yes and ye shall not be
[41:44] judged condemn not and ye shall not be
[41:48] condemned
[41:50] forgive and ye shall be
[41:54] forgiven and and I'd like to speak to
[41:56] you this morning morning by the help of
[41:58] the Lord on the release the release of
[42:02] forgiveness let's let's bow our
[42:06] heads heavenly

[42:13] and Humble Hearts Lord wanting Lord to
[42:17] be Children of the
[42:20] highest for you are high and lifted
[42:23] up Lord we just want to yield to you
[42:27] this
[42:28] morning and you've seen Lord the enemy
[42:32] that's tried to hinder right but you was
[42:36] faithful Lord and Lord and we're so
[42:39] thankful to be called by your great holy
[42:43] name and as we gather around your
[42:46] Eternal Word this morning please Lord
[42:51] bind bind my mouth Lord if I would say
[42:55] anything contrary to your word
[42:57] Lord you know that's my desire is to
[43:00] just to speak your word and your word
[43:03] alone but I am just a mere
[43:07] man but we want to look to you Lord and
[43:10] um I believe you've placed a gift in my
[43:13] life and Lord I want to use it this
[43:17] morning for your glory and just get out
[43:19] of the way that you could deal with your
[43:22] children's heart this morning Lord I
[43:25] I'll say whatever you want said Lord if
[43:30] it would just be a help Lord if I I will
[43:35] be a fool for you this morning Lord oh
[43:37] bless them Lord and I will count it
[43:39] thank you Jesus I will I will count it a
[43:42] privilege Lord to be a fool for you this
[43:44] morning so we yield to you and ask that
[43:47] you would have your way in this service
[43:50] and we ask these thingss to be so in the
[43:53] mighty all sufficient name of our Lord
[43:56] and savor Savior Jesus Christ
[43:59] amen God bless you you could be seated
[44:03] this
[44:07] morning the um the release of
[44:10] forgiveness and and so you know Jesus
[44:14] tells us that we were to
[44:19] forgive and if we would forgive then we
[44:22] would know that we are
[44:24] forgiven so if you sometimes I think we
[44:28] all do have a question in our heart Lord
[44:31] am I
[44:32] forgiven you know we want to make sure
[44:35] everything's under the blood yes sir we
[44:37] want to make sure everything's confessed
[44:39] and you know we talk a lot about what we
[44:42] got to confess but you know really it's
[44:46] pretty simple if you want to know that
[44:49] you're forgiven it's can you forgive
[44:53] right oh yes forgive and ye shall be
[44:58] forgiven and it it may seem like a
[45:01] simple subject but it's really so
[45:06] profound um because a lot of times in
[45:09] life um you know as as Christians we all
[45:13] come from different walks of life and we
[45:16] all maybe some of us generationally have
[45:21] brought up been brought up uh in this uh
[45:24] gospel way and maybe uh some here this
[45:28] morning has never stepped foot in a
[45:31] barroom and the only uh alcohol that's
[45:35] ever touched your lips is the communion
[45:37] wine and that may be a quite a testimony
[45:41] to have I I wished I had it you know I I
[45:45] I I came up uh a little bit uh uh on the
[45:49] other side of the tracks and so I got a
[45:52] lot of scars to prove where I've been
[45:55] unfortunately and that's all to my shame
[45:58] but God was faithful in it
[46:01] all but but we're not going to focus
[46:04] maybe so much on overcoming alcohol and
[46:07] drugs and that's that's all part of it
[46:10] but the thing that that we all as uh uh
[46:13] Christians having a Christian profession
[46:15] this morning we could be cleaned up
[46:17] living a good life and paying tithes and
[46:21] you know no no uh no filth of the world
[46:27] and maybe have a a home that looks very
[46:31] uh modest and Holiness and we could have
[46:34] the dresses the right length and all
[46:37] free flowing and no slits in the home
[46:40] and you know we can all be
[46:43] uh you know living that model of of of
[46:47] of modesty and an example of Holiness
[46:51] but if we but if
[46:53] we sit here and even myself in include
[46:57] stand here this morning with
[46:59] unforgiveness in our life we are in
[47:02] Jeopardy of Hell
[47:04] Fire um you know Jesus now and I'm not I
[47:09] want you to think a lot of times we as
[47:11] Christians we all know if we've been in
[47:14] any uh uh um any length of time been
[47:19] serving the Christian way you know we
[47:21] all know we have to forgive and and we
[47:24] can many times say well I forgive you
[47:26] but uh I want us to be honest with
[47:28] ourselves how many times and if we've
[47:31] all been in this any length of time a
[47:34] lot of times it was lip
[47:35] service well we might have said it but
[47:38] we didn't mean it from the heart and and
[47:41] you know Jesus Takes uh the parable of
[47:44] of the man that owed 10,000 talents and
[47:48] and the man forgave him but then he came
[47:51] across a man that owed him a 100 Pence
[47:54] and Jesus gives us such an extreme
[47:57] uh uh Dynamic of of value uh of those
[48:01] 10,000 talents if you would take those
[48:04] 10,000 talents and add them up today it
[48:07] would be into the billions of dollars
[48:09] that that man was
[48:11] forgiven and but then the extreme of it
[48:14] was is that when that man would have
[48:16] such a burden lifted off of his
[48:18] shoulders of being in debt eight over
[48:21] $86
[48:23] billion in debt I didn't say Millions I
[48:27] said billions but for for for somebody
[48:31] to look at that man and said I forgive
[48:33] you but but then that man would come
[48:37] across the man that owed him
[48:40] $15
[48:43] wow and when the man owed him
[48:46] $15 he wanted to all of a sudden uh uh
[48:50] uh you know grab him bought a collar and
[48:52] try to force him to pay and and Jesus
[48:56] Takes that that and as we see there in
[48:58] the 18th chapter he says this he said he
[49:03] says then his Lord after he had called
[49:06] him said unto him oh thy Wicked servant
[49:09] I forgave thee all that debt that
[49:12] because thou desirest me should us not
[49:15] there also that I have compassion on thy
[49:18] fellow servant even as I have pity on
[49:21] thee and his Lord was WTH with him and
[49:24] delivered him to the tormentors that he
[49:27] should pay all that was due unto him so
[49:30] likewise shall my heavenly father do
[49:34] also unto you if ye from your
[49:42] hearts amen if ye from your
[49:47] hearts forgive not
[49:49] everyone his brother's
[49:52] trespasses amen so it's more than just
[49:55] saying I'm sorry
[49:57] but it's actually meaning it and being
[50:00] sorry from the
[50:02] heart and I want to just help you
[50:06] remember you know sometimes God and life
[50:09] makes things so tight that there's no
[50:12] way we can do it humanly possible in our
[50:14] own selves
[50:16] yes because a lot of times things cut so
[50:21] deep that the only way that we can
[50:23] forgive from the heart is if the holy
[50:27] spirit is in the heart to give you that
[50:31] forgiveness to give to somebody
[50:34] else now brother now Jesus said forgive
[50:39] not everyone his brother but I want you
[50:41] to see what the Prophet The Prophet
[50:44] takes it a step closer he says if you've
[50:47] been indifferent if you had little sces
[50:51] and little things what difference does
[50:52] it make you're going to die one of these
[50:55] days
[50:57] what day maybe
[51:01] today you don't know an hour from now
[51:04] you may be in
[51:06] Hell or you may be in heaven
[51:13] right an hour for
[51:17] now many of many of 10 and 12 year old
[51:22] yeah will be in one of those two
[51:25] places true
[51:28] worldwide but many times we put it way
[51:31] off Yonder and we and we push it off and
[51:33] we push it off but one day we'll push it
[51:37] off for the last time and every one of
[51:40] us will one day have a last
[51:43] breath I want that last breath Amen to
[51:47] be filled with the Holy Spirit
[51:49] hallelujah hallelujah brother Ram said
[51:52] but you got to choose
[51:53] now if there's anything in your life
[51:56] that isn't right you choose Now by faith
[51:58] you say well if I can just get even with
[52:01] her if I can get even with him no matter
[52:04] what you've done choose
[52:07] life choose life for Jesus said if ye
[52:11] from your heart do not forgive every
[52:15] person their transgressions neither does
[52:18] your heavenly father forgive
[52:20] you so just get that close if there's
[52:25] one art
[52:28] right you know just that little funny
[52:31] feeling
[52:32] yeah you know just that brother that
[52:35] rubs you the wrong way that when you see
[52:38] him you run the other way
[52:49] wow no alcohol involved right ain't a
[52:53] pack of marbels yeah
[52:57] right I I you know when we when we got
[53:00] into Michigan and and all saw all the
[53:02] Billboards of the buds and marijas and
[53:05] right we even went through a town and it
[53:07] smell oh you can smell it in the
[53:10] vehicle right they they ain't they ain't
[53:13] a Philly blunt with your name on it this
[53:19] morning but if you got one art in your
[53:22] heart against any
[53:25] person then the prophet makes it so
[53:27] tight wow he says
[53:30] sinner or Saint y
[53:34] yeah you're in danger of
[53:37] Hellfire we all this
[53:41] morning and you know you think brother
[53:44] Gabe how well
[53:46] how you know I'm predestinated brother
[53:50] okay yeah I believe it yes but I'm elect
[53:56] of God God I believe it but you know
[53:58] only the predestined elected is going to
[54:01] be able to live this yes sir
[54:04] amen it this world is so dark and so
[54:09] black that that there's only going to be
[54:13] a faithful Little Flock right yes sir
[54:16] that really has surrendered amen not
[54:22] churchgoers not not just because we got
[54:25] the eagle belt Buckle right right not
[54:28] not because we got the pillar of fire
[54:30] hanging on the wall we need to have the
[54:32] pillar of fire on hanging on this
[54:35] wall right and and and and that takes
[54:40] real consecration to God Amen I and and
[54:46] so we we have to be honest this is why I
[54:50] say um I I I want you I hope that you
[54:55] you listen to what I'm bringing and
[54:59] weigh it in your heart right because we
[55:04] don't want to just think we got what we
[55:07] got if we don't have it
[55:10] right and and and we're not talking
[55:13] about well I listen there's no uh
[55:17] seniority no way right no way like like
[55:20] you know a lot of times we get on a job
[55:22] and we think well I'm not getting laid
[55:24] off I've got 25 years is here right I
[55:28] got
[55:29] seniority well seniority ain't going to
[55:32] get you there no seniority in God right
[55:36] I mean I mean that's good that we was
[55:39] faithful and and that's true to a
[55:41] degree but but I've seen youngsters that
[55:45] was more seasoned than somebody that's
[55:48] been in the 30 40 Years sir right so so
[55:53] it's how close we can get to the Cross
[55:55] of Christ
[55:57] I I don't want to just CRP by be barely
[56:01] in right and and so I I want you to
[56:05] think about this brother brandham tells
[56:07] us something I love so much brother Bram
[56:09] says as soon as you're sorry let me just
[56:12] what balance this out a little bit as
[56:14] soon as you're sorry you're already
[56:17] forgiven right this so beautiful as I
[56:21] was speaking to a brother yesterday kind
[56:23] of got a little mixed up on it said look
[56:25] brother if you said something to hurt
[56:28] your wife's feelings immediately you'd
[56:31] feel sorry for her you're sorry you did
[56:34] it you're already
[56:36] repented in your heart ain't that
[56:39] beautiful right how God makes it so
[56:42] perfect the moment we're sorry right
[56:46] before we get anything
[56:48] out
[56:50] right that's how God
[56:53] works because God is not worried about
[56:56] what what we say he's worried about
[56:59] what's in
[57:01] here and the moment we from our heart
[57:04] are
[57:05] sorry we're already forgiven he said
[57:08] that's right but you got to go tell her
[57:11] about it right
[57:14] woooo little humble
[57:17] pie the man of the
[57:22] house made a mistake yes sir
[57:27] oh my better a couple Brothers want
[57:32] to right you know you know here the
[57:34] thing a lot of times dad cuz he's the
[57:37] man of the house he thinks he ain't got

[57:48] can't look in you can't look in your
[57:49] timeline and see where you repented to
[57:51] your children something's wrong yes sir
[57:54] brother you got some pride in your life
[57:57] you better be able to go back and go
[57:59] yeah man a couple days last week two
[58:01] weeks last month they got a little
[58:10] he good and dad had to go make that
[58:13] right Dad had to go apologize to them
[58:16] little
[58:19] ones

[58:50] children Hooligans no if you want
[58:53] Hooligans call them Hooligans
[58:56] yeah yeah I I I see I see Mage Believers

[59:01] about them boys and they say they'll
[59:03] talk call them uh you know R rats and
[59:06] Hooligans and

[59:17] could hold them in my hand that they
[59:20] didn't have a choice they was bride of
[59:24] Christ they say how many people said how
[59:26] many kids you got I said I don't have
[59:27] any I got three
[59:30] children yeah that's right

[59:38] right well call them goats if you want
[59:39] to oh no
[59:42] way I'm
[59:44] sorry I believe it's important how we
[59:47] refer to our children and when we look
[59:50] at them as God's children then we treat
[59:51] them differently you think about the
[59:54] fathers that's going to have to answer
[59:57] at the white
[59:58] throne for the way they acted not to the
[1:00:02] not to the
[1:00:03] pastor yeah but how they treated their
[1:00:06] little ones in their own home yeah or
[1:00:11] you may think nobody's
[1:00:17] watching but there's an angel a
[1:00:20] recording
[1:00:21] Angel that's following you
[1:00:24] around right
[1:00:27] amen that's not a grainy video but
[1:00:31] AK yes
[1:00:34] sir
[1:00:37] so when we think about
[1:00:42] forgiveness you know
[1:00:45] uh I've been I've
[1:00:47] been thinking about Calvary a
[1:00:52] lot and
[1:00:56] you
[1:00:57] know when we when we think about Calvary
[1:01:01] the Bible tells
[1:01:02] us
[1:01:04] that when the Lord God Almighty forgien
[1:01:08] us forgiving Us in
[1:01:11] Colossians it says and you being dead in
[1:01:15] your sins and uncircumcision of your
[1:01:17] flesh hath he quickened together with
[1:01:20] him having forgiven you all all amen all
[1:01:24] trespasses Jesus
[1:01:27] blotting out the handwriting of an
[1:01:29] ordinance against the what was against
[1:01:31] us which was contrary to us took it out
[1:01:34] of the way nailing it to his
[1:01:37] cross so the Lord Jesus when he
[1:01:41] died he died for your past sins right
[1:01:45] yeah thank you Lord your present
[1:01:48] sins thank you Jesus and your future
[1:01:52] sins Glory right he died for every
[1:01:57] aspect of
[1:01:59] your what what we did yesterday what we
[1:02:03] will do yet today that we need to repent
[1:02:05] for and the sins that we will do
[1:02:09] tomorrow if there is a
[1:02:11] tomorrow cuz we all come short of the
[1:02:14] glory of God and if we say we don't sin
[1:02:17] we make God a
[1:02:19] liar so we all
[1:02:22] sin but but if he forgive us of all our
[1:02:27] sins nailing it to his
[1:02:31] cross but then he would tell
[1:02:37] us if any man will come after me let him
[1:02:41] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[1:02:46] and follow me amen so if he already took
[1:02:52] our sins and now that to his his
[1:02:56] cross but then he commands
[1:03:01] us to follow him with our own
[1:03:07] cross so I want to ask
[1:03:10] you what does that cross
[1:03:18] entail you know what as I started
[1:03:21] thinking about it
[1:03:26] Paul tells us that we die daily right
[1:03:30] right
[1:03:32] right every day we die out to
[1:03:35] self but you know I I got to thinking
[1:03:40] about the cross that I thought I was to
[1:03:43] carry and for so many years I would
[1:03:46] lived a so self-centered life when it
[1:03:51] came to my cross and my cross alone
[1:04:01] cuz if you really think about
[1:04:05] it he carried all of our sins past
[1:04:09] future and present right right but then
[1:04:12] he tells us to take up our cross and
[1:04:15] follow
[1:04:17] him so it's not just taking up your
[1:04:19] cross but then it's following his exact
[1:04:24] blueprint and footstep
[1:04:26] yeah right so let's
[1:04:30] look at what he done on his road to
[1:04:34] Calvary
[1:04:37] right now he was Perfection of
[1:04:41] perfection the sinless
[1:04:44] one the Spotless
[1:04:47] one the man did nothing a
[1:04:51] miss his whole life right from the
[1:04:55] Cradle to the Grave spotless
[1:05:00] yeah so perfect even when he was a
[1:05:04] Youngster my my one of my old pastors
[1:05:08] when he was a little boy he asked his
[1:05:10] daddy one time he said Daddy did Jesus
[1:05:13] ever get a
[1:05:19] whooping and and what his dad told him I
[1:05:22] thought was so profound he looked at his
[1:05:25] son and he said
[1:05:29] honey even dads make
[1:05:32] mistakes
[1:05:42] right see Jesus suffered for things that
[1:05:45] he didn't do right
[1:05:49] wrong and this is what to my shame I
[1:05:54] realized
[1:05:58] that the cross that I was carrying was
[1:06:00] the wrong
[1:06:04] cross because it's when we do
[1:06:07] good and we suffer for
[1:06:10] it that's thankworthy
[1:06:21] it's when somebody wrongs you and you
[1:06:24] didn't do anything
[1:06:27] wrong and you suffer for
[1:06:32] it that's
[1:06:40] good the Bible tells
[1:06:44] us to suffer
[1:06:48] ourselves to be
[1:06:52] robbed that's what defrauded means
[1:06:57] and lady oia yeah Rich right increased
[1:07:02] with Goods yeah brother Carson do you
[1:07:05] realize how much overtime I work
[1:07:09] brother what listen brother when I leave
[1:07:13] here I'm driving 4 hours home and I'm
[1:07:15] getting up at 1:00 in the morning to go
[1:07:17] punch a clock right and I got to go put
[1:07:20] in 12 hours I worked hard right for my
[1:07:25] pay yes sir yes
[1:07:27] sir yes sir I got the
[1:07:30] what oh oh you ain't no no you ain't

[1:07:43] going to pinch see Co cuz it's it's when

[1:07:54] fast but turn you ain't no take
[1:07:55] something from me hold F no we just read
[1:07:58] Jesus said if they take your
[1:08:03] cloak you're supposed to offer up so
[1:08:07] when a when when somebody step breaks
[1:08:09] into your house and takes your coat
[1:08:11] you're supposed to go sir sir hold on
[1:08:12] hold on sir
[1:08:15] sir no here here's
[1:08:27] see it's
[1:08:29] easy for us to give one to
[1:08:35] another that's right but even the
[1:08:38] Sinners do that right see and we can get
[1:08:42] our little click of message Believers
[1:08:45] and we we can do good to the household
[1:08:47] of faith and that's what we're supposed
[1:08:49] to do we're supposed to do good to those
[1:08:51] especially of the household of faith but
[1:08:54] what about
[1:08:56] what about that that that person at
[1:08:58] Walmart that's got the big skar tattooed
[1:09:01] on his neck that you know that's all
[1:09:04] sleeved out you know and you know when
[1:09:07] you get close to him he smells like he
[1:09:09] just got done firing up a joint
[1:09:15] yeah see you know you know no matter how
[1:09:18] thin you slice it you know a lot of
[1:09:20] times we look we want to sit in the seat
[1:09:21] of the scornful right you know
[1:09:24] especially especially if if it's a
[1:09:27] message believer that never did bit out
[1:09:28] in the Sin and out in the world and you
[1:09:31] know came from a mom and dad as mom and
[1:09:33] dad was good they don't know no divorce
[1:09:36] oh I heard about that must be pretty
[1:09:40] tough right then you can look down and
[1:09:43] you can see that person all sleeved out
[1:09:46] and tattooed
[1:09:47] up but but the problem of it
[1:09:50] is you got to enter into that person's
[1:09:54] suffering right
[1:09:57] amen amen oh I'm talking about I'm
[1:09:59] talking about the coworker that rubs you
[1:10:01] the wrong way matter of fact it's going
[1:10:04] to rub you the wrong way first thing
[1:10:06] tomorrow morning yeah because of this
[1:10:08] sermon that brother Gabe's preaching to
[1:10:10] you yes you going to be tried first
[1:10:13] thing in the morning brother Gabe was
[1:10:16] tried all night right hey woke up about
[1:10:21] four or five
[1:10:23] times I I move the bed
[1:10:25] I thought I wake up my wife looked up I
[1:10:27] looked at it was still 2:00 in the
[1:10:28] morning I thought oh
[1:10:32] man my baby's sick she ain't feeling
[1:10:35] good right uh oh my did everything that
[1:10:39] could go wrong went wrong get out to the
[1:10:42] car I even open up the trunk just fine
[1:10:45] get in there get everything loaded
[1:10:50] up I
[1:10:52] believe I believe
[1:10:56] oh my
[1:10:58] see that's okay
[1:11:01] yeah because you know it's easy for us
[1:11:06] to be message Believers when everything
[1:11:08] goes
[1:11:09] good right it's okay for I can stand up
[1:11:13] here be Preacher Man and you know right
[1:11:17] but but be Preacher Man when you
[1:11:21] go try to be spiritual on that one
[1:11:25] yeah yeah
[1:11:27] yeah right yeah so so the Bible tells
[1:11:35] us that we're supposed to love our
[1:11:39] enemies and we're supposed to bless them
[1:11:42] that yeah curse
[1:11:47] you when's the last time you blessed
[1:11:51] your coworker that curses you
[1:11:55] I'm talking about the coworker that when
[1:11:57] you see him across the hall or down the
[1:12:00] alleway from the machineries and you
[1:12:02] just see him in the corner cuz you you
[1:12:04] saw what he wore and cuz you mark him
[1:12:08] remember right yeah and and he had that
[1:12:11] red you wear that red shirt on so as
[1:12:13] soon as you see that red shirt you bail
[1:12:15] before he
[1:12:18] come am I preaching to anybody this
[1:12:22] morning and you go the other way
[1:12:25] amen so you wanted to
[1:12:34] avoid bless them that curse you and pray
[1:12:40] for them
[1:12:42] which
[1:12:44] what despitefully use
[1:12:47] you see that that's not so easy you know
[1:12:53] you know why it's not so easy
[1:12:56] because we as as Believers we as human
[1:13:01] beings we love Justice
[1:13:06] right and especially message
[1:13:10] Believers
[1:13:13] because Elijah represented God's justice
[1:13:17] right
[1:13:19] yeah and we can take that Elijah
[1:13:23] anointing and be just like James and
[1:13:25] John and the moment that they won't let
[1:13:28] our savior get anything to eat we want
[1:13:32] to call fire down out of heaven like
[1:13:34] Elijah
[1:13:38] did because we are under that eal
[1:13:41] anointing right and brother bam said on
[1:13:45] Mount Transfiguration when Jesus was
[1:13:48] transfigured Moses represented the law
[1:13:51] and Elijah represented Justice right
[1:13:55] and we from birth when somebody wrongs
[1:13:59] Us justice is to be
[1:14:08] served see we can take that aij your
[1:14:12] anointing and we can take our complexes
[1:14:14] and our wounds of life and we can
[1:14:17] justify our rage yes sir oh yeah yes sir
[1:14:22] you you you you you ever you ever see a
[1:14:24] message believer and and when brother
[1:14:26] Brandon's talking about that Roman
[1:14:28] Catholic church and that
[1:14:31] mother right
[1:14:35] brother you know you know what or
[1:14:38] brother man talking that domineering
[1:14:39] woman that right brother them women of
[1:14:43] them lady see sister you know what that
[1:14:46] is if that brother would be honest with
[1:14:49] himself he got hurt as a little boy by a
[1:14:51] domineering mother right or a
[1:14:54] domineering step mother yeah yes
[1:14:57] sir and because he was
[1:15:00] wounded as a little boy he can take that
[1:15:05] message and that is not the Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost that's a wounded little
[1:15:14] boy that's never
[1:15:17] dealt with that trauma in his childhood
[1:15:21] right true it's true it's true
[1:15:25] that's right you you know you know you
[1:15:28] know whenever I go to the unfortunately
[1:15:31] look
[1:15:33] I you know I I got well a matter of fact
[1:15:37] when I came across the border I didn't
[1:15:38] know if they was going to let me you
[1:15:40] know cuz I got a couple felonies
[1:15:43] right and so and so uh uh you know I've
[1:15:48] been locked up and
[1:15:50] so I I don't I don't really you know
[1:15:53] tattoos don't win fights
[1:15:55] no no no no no right I mean okay you you
[1:16:01] can have many skulls on your neck you
[1:16:03] want to but that don't and okay so you
[1:16:07] can take a needle getting I mean but
[1:16:09] that don't make you a man no no right
[1:16:12] like like so so so the person that barks
[1:16:16] the most is not the person I worry about
[1:16:19] so when you see somebody all muscle
[1:16:22] bound and sleeved out in tattoos you
[1:16:24] know what when I look at somebody like
[1:16:26] that you know what I see now not always
[1:16:28] but you know who I see I see a scared
[1:16:30] little boy yeah yeah yeah sir yes sir
[1:16:33] and that scared little boy got hurt as a
[1:16:35] little boy and so he said it'll never
[1:16:37] happen again sir that's sir right and so
[1:16:40] that's why he puts all this on his
[1:16:41] sleeve cuz he's trying to growl at you
[1:16:44] trying to show you how tough he is but
[1:16:46] really it's a scared little boy on the
[1:16:48] inside you get somebody look I'm not
[1:16:50] worried about somebody trying to pick
[1:16:52] bleed tough right I'm worried about the
[1:16:54] quiet one in the corner The Quiet One in
[1:16:57] the corner he knows who he is that's the
[1:16:59] one I'm looking at I'm not worried about
[1:17:01] the man over
[1:17:03] here y d amen okay see so so all that
[1:17:09] all that tough guy stuff don't mean
[1:17:11] nothing when you look at somebody you
[1:17:14] got to be able to look deeper and see
[1:17:15] that that that person that's that's
[1:17:18] trying to be tough is really just
[1:17:20] wounded right because no matter how
[1:17:25] perfect a home you come from you come to
[1:17:28] this world broken yes sir yes
[1:17:31] sir I don't care how good mom and dad if
[1:17:34] you you could be third generation
[1:17:36] message that don't make you could be
[1:17:38] seed of God elect of God you got a seed
[1:17:40] in your soul I get all that that's fine
[1:17:42] you still come to the world
[1:17:44] broken look you say no no brother Gabe I
[1:17:47] never heard that yell dad never raised
[1:17:49] his
[1:17:50] voice but what about great Grandad right
[1:17:56] because the iniquity goes into the third
[1:17:58] and fourth generation and what you're
[1:18:00] laboring under may not it be your fault
[1:18:02] nor your dad's fault right nor your
[1:18:05] great grand your granddad's fault but it
[1:18:07] was your great great
[1:18:08] granddaddy wow hello somebody that's
[1:18:12] scripture that's Bible right and so
[1:18:15] things go deeper in life and a lot of
[1:18:17] times we like to pick and choose and go
[1:18:19] and just blast somebody because the way
[1:18:21] that they are but you got to understand
[1:18:24] you go why is God letting that person
[1:18:26] get away with that you know why because
[1:18:28] God knows what that person is laboring
[1:18:30] under is not his fault it's not her
[1:18:33] fault the why the way that she is the
[1:18:35] way that she is is because of something
[1:18:37] Grandma did and she's laboring under
[1:18:40] that
[1:18:43] thing that is
[1:18:46] life and so that is why we have to
[1:18:49] handle not just us as Believers we have
[1:18:52] to handle everybody
[1:18:55] really differently yes because the you
[1:18:59] know we as message Believers we love
[1:19:01] that artificial
[1:19:04] discernment
[1:19:07] good and I know I look I you you
[1:19:10] preaching back brother BR said you can
[1:19:11] be in there you 30 seconds and two
[1:19:13] minutes and you can tell whether they
[1:19:15] got the holy ghost or not I I I believe
[1:19:17] that as long as that's not your complex
[1:19:20] showing
[1:19:22] through amen do do you know do you do
[1:19:26] you know do you know we as human beings
[1:19:29] psychology you could have had trauma
[1:19:32] when you was a 8-year-old boy yeah and
[1:19:34] you know the person that was that hurt
[1:19:37] you as an 8-year-old boy he looks like
[1:19:40] me and because he looks like me he's got
[1:19:43] he's got he's got deep set eyes he's got
[1:19:46] big ears right and you know he he got a
[1:19:48] Furrow just like me and he had a loud
[1:19:51] voice and I ain't did n thing to you
[1:19:54] yeah but because I
[1:19:56] resemble the person that traumatized you
[1:20:00] you automatically you got a funny
[1:20:02] feeling about brother gab and now now
[1:20:06] you want to use that quote to justify
[1:20:09] now of a sudden you
[1:20:13] spiritual and you look look I'm not dis
[1:20:17] discrediting what brother Benham said
[1:20:19] but what I'm trying to show you is you
[1:20:20] got to be careful because you can
[1:20:22] deceive yourself you caning believe a
[1:20:25] lie you have to try that Spirit now God
[1:20:29] May and please I'm not trying to
[1:20:30] discredit S especially you sisters funny
[1:20:32] little feelings you in the parking lot
[1:20:34] Walmart parking lot some of a little
[1:20:35] creepo I'm not don't please don't use
[1:20:38] what brother Gabe said and then you know
[1:20:41] you understand what I'm saying but what
[1:20:42] I'm trying to say is a lot of times we
[1:20:44] as mess Believers we always try to walk
[1:20:46] with oh
[1:20:47] spiritual I got the anointing you you
[1:20:51] know message me and listen brother
[1:20:53] Brandon was the most spiritual person
[1:20:54] I've ever seen in my life outside of
[1:20:56] Jesus Christ he never walked around like
[1:20:58] that he never walked around you know in
[1:21:00] this uh oh you know he didn't do he do
[1:21:03] you he spent most of his life in another
[1:21:06] world right Supernatural world but he
[1:21:09] but but but when you see message people
[1:21:12] and they always got to be everything's
[1:21:15] spiritual right you and then they want
[1:21:17] you to be Spirit then they try to get
[1:21:19] you to buy in Brother G you know brother
[1:21:22] brother you know this brother and I need
[1:21:24] you to do see because
[1:21:27] God then all of a sudden they you're
[1:21:29] like
[1:21:34] what
[1:21:36] right so if it was spiritual God's got
[1:21:38] to work on my I'm not denying that but
[1:21:40] let me pray about it maybe I'm being
[1:21:43] Carn but let me get in that you know
[1:21:46] right so so you got to be honest you got
[1:21:49] wait and go wait a minute Lord don't let
[1:21:51] me just because a lot of times we love
[1:21:54] to pick and choose who's you know who's
[1:21:56] bride and who's not cuz but I got the
[1:21:58] Holy Ghost you
[1:22:03] know and and hey not not that you don't
[1:22:06] have Holy Ghost discernment but what I'm
[1:22:08] saying is you have to have being tuned
[1:22:10] enough with God to where you're not just
[1:22:12] using your past traumas to pick and
[1:22:16] choose who is bride and who's not you
[1:22:19] understand what I'm saying that's where
[1:22:20] you had to you had to be honest enough
[1:22:22] with yourself and pray over these things
[1:22:26] because you listen if it's always
[1:22:34] Justice you you you okay it's justice
[1:22:38] but I don't know about you see we can
[1:22:41] have we want Justice for
[1:22:44] us
[1:22:45] but really it needs to be Grace it needs
[1:22:49] to be loved right amen because when when
[1:22:55] John when John was there John could
[1:22:59] identify with Christ right cuz John was
[1:23:02] the reflection of
[1:23:04] love we don't want God's justice no oh
[1:23:09] my
[1:23:11] wow there's no
[1:23:14] way we would be able to make it in God's
[1:23:17] justice we want God's grace and love is
[1:23:22] that right I'm already at 50 minutes
[1:23:25] you're good oh my you're fine no brother
[1:23:30] how you so you know think about that
[1:23:33] when we're talking about
[1:23:34] forgiveness see brother brandham tells
[1:23:37] us he says can you go the Second
[1:23:39] Mile can you turn the cheek the other
[1:23:42] side that's the way to test Christianity
[1:23:45] see how far you can go in love
[1:23:49] fellowship and Brotherhood that's the
[1:23:51] way you test Christianity amen see you
[1:23:56] know when Jesus when the disciples come
[1:23:58] to Jesus and ask for him to teach him
[1:24:00] the prayer to pray Jesus tells them in
[1:24:05] in one fast and it's a beautiful you can
[1:24:07] preach a whole message just on Jesus's
[1:24:09] prayer because Jesus gives you the
[1:24:12] principles of prayer first he says after
[1:24:14] this man therefore you pray Our Father
[1:24:16] which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:24:19] what Jesus is telling us is when you go
[1:24:22] to prayer you little ones yes you don't
[1:24:24] just say uh Jesus bless mommy bless
[1:24:26] daddy and you know and I want to I want
[1:24:29] to that Jesus please can I get a quad
[1:24:32] right
[1:24:34] right please Lord put it on Daddy's
[1:24:36] heart to buy me a quad
[1:24:39] please okay no no that's not how you
[1:24:42] start off cuz you know what you're doing
[1:24:44] you giving God Almighty a honeydew list
[1:24:47] yes and you too young for a honeydew
[1:24:49] list right you know what a honeydew list
[1:24:52] is yeah look you look at that like yeah
[1:24:54] I know
[1:24:54] mom don't mom got to yeah all right she
[1:24:58] probably ties you into the honeydew list

[1:28:34] and if you would be honest with yourself
[1:28:36] you don't want you don't want them to
[1:28:38] repent what you want them to do you want
[1:28:40] them to fall down before
[1:28:43] you you don't care a lick about their
[1:28:45] soul getting right before God you want
[1:28:48] Justice right right yeah yeah wow oh
[1:28:53] Hallelujah
[1:28:54] am hey I I I'll say amen and raise my
[1:28:59] hand I don't been there oh yeah I don't
[1:29:02] been
[1:29:03] there I I had to I listen I had to be
[1:29:06] honest with
[1:29:07] myself I'm we all done set a SE of the
[1:29:10] scor
[1:29:13] F so so when we want that's what we're
[1:29:17] wanting we want in
[1:29:22] justice but is that let me ask you when
[1:29:26] Christ remember he said take up your
[1:29:29] cross when Christ resurrected from the
[1:29:32] grave show me where he went back and
[1:29:35] found the Roman soldier that pierced him
[1:29:36] in his
[1:29:40] side show show me show me where he went
[1:29:43] and found the guy that had the cat of
[1:29:45] nine tails that beat him well they they
[1:29:49] they don't know how many times they beat
[1:29:50] him because the Jewish law was 40
[1:29:53] stripes yeah but Roman law they there
[1:29:56] was no limit yeah right the Bible says
[1:29:58] his Bon stared at
[1:30:01] him the Bible said that his vicing was
[1:30:04] marred more than any other man he looked
[1:30:06] like a monster yes
[1:30:09] amen amen for me so so when when he took
[1:30:14] that
[1:30:15] punishment who did he go
[1:30:19] to did he go say you owe me
[1:30:24] I told you I was the son of
[1:30:27] God no no no he said father forgive him
[1:30:32] am they don't know what you're
[1:30:34] doing right am now now thank you
[1:30:40] Lord
[1:30:42] you you take up your cross see this is
[1:30:47] the cross that I was
[1:30:49] missing it's the cross when we are
[1:30:52] innocent right yeah yeah
[1:30:55] yeah yeah it's when we've done nothing
[1:30:58] wrong right there you go and we are
[1:31:01] innocent cuz he said follow me take up
[1:31:04] your cross and follow
[1:31:07] me so the cross that we're talking is
[1:31:09] not you dying out to your own individual
[1:31:13] sins that's not what we're talking about
[1:31:15] we're not talking about oh God forgive
[1:31:17] me for this cuz he already carried your
[1:31:19] sins I'm not talking that we don't
[1:31:21] repent but what I'm saying when he's to
[1:31:23] me me Calvary has taken a new uh facet
[1:31:28] to me because it's when we suffer and
[1:31:31] we've done nothing
[1:31:34] wrong and we are
[1:31:37] innocent and we deserve
[1:31:41] justice but we don't take
[1:31:45] justice we give them love and grace and
[1:31:50] mercy that's when we are facing heaven
[1:31:54] that's the cross see you say brother
[1:31:57] Gabe how do you do that you don't know
[1:31:58] what I've been through I know you don't
[1:32:00] I know I don't know what you've been
[1:32:01] through listen as many people as here
[1:32:03] there is so much trauma in here if if we
[1:32:06] could if we could you know uh uh pull
[1:32:09] back all of our childhood you know we
[1:32:12] would see we would see things that was
[1:32:14] absolutely atrocious right right I I
[1:32:18] look I when I was a little boy my
[1:32:20] parents was divorced when when I when I
[1:32:22] should have been shelter Ed and
[1:32:24] protected I was I was uh I was the first
[1:32:28] first drink alcohol I ever had was like
[1:32:30] first to second grade right by a man
[1:32:33] that should have protected me right
[1:32:36] right I'm drinking Captain Morgan and
[1:32:38] Coke watching Friday Night Fights right
[1:32:41] with my
[1:32:43] stepdad
[1:32:46] right before the age of
[1:32:48] accountability pornography within Arms
[1:32:51] Reach my whole childhood life life right
[1:32:55] till I was a grown
[1:32:57] man so you say that's not fair I know
[1:32:59] it's not fair no it's not fair no I look
[1:33:03] at these young people and they're
[1:33:04] innocent and they don't have no scars
[1:33:06] and I think I think God why that's not
[1:33:09] right why did I have to do why why Lord
[1:33:13] why just like some of you have got the
[1:33:15] same kind of trauma in your life and you
[1:33:17] think why in the world Lord did that
[1:33:19] have to happen to me why me
[1:33:23] it's not
[1:33:29] fair life isn't fair that's right
[1:33:35] right life's not fair
[1:33:40] no but he still was gracious
[1:33:43] enough Mercy Amen to give you ears to
[1:33:47] hear the gospel amen thank you Lord amen
[1:33:52] amen to give you a to receive
[1:33:57] yes praise
[1:34:01] God thank you Lord Jesus amen
[1:34:06] see a lot of times when you when you
[1:34:09] when
[1:34:11] you when you look at the the the Good
[1:34:16] Samaritan and the man that that had got
[1:34:19] wounded when you look at that that word
[1:34:22] wounds it means the word that we're all
[1:34:25] familiar with the
[1:34:26] trauma but I want you to see that it's
[1:34:29] actually made up of three Greek
[1:34:31] words and those three Greek words shows
[1:34:35] the complexity of
[1:34:36] trauma because it also it trauma is the
[1:34:39] three words means to break in pieces
[1:34:42] shatter Smite A Worn Path and to Nash or
[1:34:47] to grind one's
[1:34:50] teeth which I think it's so fitting that
[1:34:52] God would have this Greek word have so
[1:34:56] many facets right yes because trauma is
[1:34:59] multi-layered right when we have trauma
[1:35:03] in our lives sometimes what you're
[1:35:05] dealing with you ever have somebody
[1:35:07] brother sister person at work and you
[1:35:09] just say something little wrong to them
[1:35:11] and they just blow up on
[1:35:13] you and you're like what in the world
[1:35:16] just
[1:35:17] happened you know what it was it wasn't
[1:35:20] what you did no no it's what you touched
[1:35:23] yes when they were 8 years
[1:35:26] old it was the fact that they were
[1:35:29] picked on as a little itty bitty boy or
[1:35:31] a little itty bitty girl or maybe they
[1:35:34] had a mom and all you did is say
[1:35:36] something and the way that you looked
[1:35:39] that just that little they call it micro
[1:35:42] Expressions that micro expression that
[1:35:44] you did and the word that you said
[1:35:46] triggered something in them yes sir yes
[1:35:49] sir yes sir it's
[1:35:52] true amen see you you can look at this
[1:35:55] little itty bitty boy right
[1:36:00] there and all you see is a smile right a
[1:36:05] lot I a pretty pretty cute little kid I
[1:36:09] know I
[1:36:12] know but see what you fail to
[1:36:17] see is the pain behind that smile
[1:36:24] amen what you fail to see is all the
[1:36:27] trauma in that little boy's
[1:36:29] life
[1:36:32] amen see it was all that trauma in that
[1:36:34] little boy's life that was sent him down
[1:36:36] a path that he really didn't want to
[1:36:39] go
[1:36:41] right right and you know sometimes we
[1:36:44] can look at people's life and we can
[1:36:46] judge people yes sir and we can think we
[1:36:48] think what's the big deal Shake It Off
[1:36:53] and you know when you say shake it off
[1:36:55] you ought to be ashamed of yourself yes
[1:37:01] sir cuz what may be trauma to them may
[1:37:06] not be trauma to
[1:37:10] you this is what I love about the
[1:37:12] prophet watch what brother brandham says
[1:37:15] and and he's and he's Discerning this
[1:37:16] man's life and he's tell him he has
[1:37:18] inward troubles and he says you could
[1:37:20] read all of it but just for time's sake
[1:37:22] he said when you was a child a little
[1:37:24] boy with knee pants on you've got
[1:37:26] problems with something he says I
[1:37:28] believe it's a dog that chased you or
[1:37:30] something isn't that right a big dog and
[1:37:32] you run to a porch is that right and I
[1:37:34] see it as a little boy is that uh the
[1:37:37] truth sir all right who would know that
[1:37:39] but God alone isn't that but right yeah
[1:37:43] now we would look at that and
[1:37:45] go brother dad was just a dog yeah come
[1:37:49] on brother right it was a little boy get
[1:37:52] over it yes
[1:37:56] but that's not what the angel of the
[1:37:57] Lord
[1:38:01] said now you think about this man's life
[1:38:04] the angel of the Lord is there and he
[1:38:07] could go through any aspect of that
[1:38:09] boy's life that man's life and he could
[1:38:12] identify and if we had the same insight
[1:38:15] and could look through that we'd say no
[1:38:17] no it was right here when he was 20
[1:38:18] years old or no it's when he was 18 and
[1:38:20] he had this this is way more traumatic
[1:38:23] than
[1:38:27] that but that's not what the angel of
[1:38:29] the Lord called out the angel of the
[1:38:32] Lord went to the heart of the problem
[1:38:38] right see where we would say shake it
[1:38:41] off get over it right yes
[1:38:44] sir see how we do one another amen good
[1:38:48] see this is what I love about the messag
[1:38:51] right here right sir because it gives us
[1:38:54] Insight because we are all look what
[1:38:57] what if this what if this man 6'4 and
[1:38:59] you know yeah got a flannel on and you
[1:39:03] know got an ax in the back of the truck
[1:39:06] and right came to the church with with
[1:39:09] boots on you know steel toes and right
[1:39:14] what what did he look like and we' look
[1:39:15] at him and
[1:39:17] go
[1:39:20] what but see how we do yeah it's so easy
[1:39:25] for us to misjudge a situation and you
[1:39:29] don't really understand why that person
[1:39:32] ticks the way that they tick and it may
[1:39:35] be something as simple as that I I I'll
[1:39:38] show you another one watch this brother
[1:39:41] bandam when he's getting ready change
[1:39:42] from his first pool to his second this
[1:39:45] sister he says there back there he said
[1:39:48] I seen a young lady about 16 years old
[1:39:50] and she was just running this as hard as
[1:39:51] she could she had a big ribbon tied to
[1:39:54] her hair a double plat hanging back she
[1:39:56] had a chucker dress on and she was
[1:39:58] running real fast I looked there was a a
[1:40:00] big yellow dog chasing her and she said
[1:40:02] I see a young lady with a checker dress
[1:40:04] begin to tell uh what I was seeing
[1:40:07] looking in front of me this is the first
[1:40:09] time brother brandom discerns the heart
[1:40:11] right here if if this sounds familiar to
[1:40:13] you he says she goes up on the porch I
[1:40:15] see the lady take her in and she starts
[1:40:17] screaming she said and then this girl
[1:40:20] and when when she's doing it she goes
[1:40:22] that was me
[1:40:24] when I was in school she said this is
[1:40:27] what I want you to see I never thought
[1:40:29] of it before in my
[1:40:32] life so this
[1:40:34] girl has this trauma that's so
[1:40:38] suppressed she never she forgot about it
[1:40:41] and never thought about it but when the
[1:40:45] angel of the Lord discerned
[1:40:51] her so that tell tells us we can have
[1:40:55] traumatic things in our life that are so
[1:41:02] suppressed so
[1:41:06] suppressed that that because we were
[1:41:09] hurt by a preacher we'll hold that man
[1:41:14] accountable and it's his fault
[1:41:23] and then brother Dale will will say
[1:41:25] something a certain way and then you'll
[1:41:27] you'll all a sudden
[1:41:29] see he's as inocent as the day is
[1:41:35] long listen friends we are a mess as
[1:41:38] human beings and there is there is no
[1:41:42] hope for us outside of surrendering Our
[1:41:45] Lives to the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[1:41:48] Spirit stepping in and giving us true
[1:41:51] Holy Ghost discernment not to discern
[1:41:54] one another I'm not worried about you I
[1:41:56] want the Holy Ghost to discern my life
[1:42:00] because I'm worried about that something
[1:42:03] that I never thought before in my life
[1:42:06] but because it is so buried yes sir so
[1:42:11] buried I want that angel of the Lord to
[1:42:14] come by my way maybe through my wife and
[1:42:18] say something or maybe through brother
[1:42:20] Dale when we're talking after service or
[1:42:22] brother Carson or whoever it may be
[1:42:25] maybe my pastor Wednesday I don't care
[1:42:27] who it is just let the Holy Spirit
[1:42:30] discern my life in such a way to I can
[1:42:33] realize I never thought about that
[1:42:36] before in my
[1:42:38] life and it just unlocks something to me
[1:42:43] and then I realized oh that's why I am
[1:42:47] the way that I am look you know you know
[1:42:50] I would encourage you
[1:42:53] um I would encourage you after this
[1:42:56] service at some point in time to sit
[1:42:59] down some of you got so much trauma you
[1:43:01] would never counsel with your
[1:43:05] pastor because you got so much
[1:43:09] pride you know because we in this
[1:43:11] message we have a complex of following
[1:43:13] our a
[1:43:18] man we have a complex in this message of
[1:43:22] being a manf
[1:43:23] and because we have that and then us
[1:43:25] Brothers can become independent because
[1:43:27] we have the message we don't need him oh
[1:43:30] he can preach to us on Sundays and
[1:43:31] Wednesdays but I got it covered I'm the
[1:43:34] high priest I'm the high priest of my
[1:43:40] home woo see how we use quotes see how
[1:43:44] we use it we use all that to cover
[1:43:46] everything but really in reality we just
[1:43:49] don't want to share because we don't
[1:43:50] want to be embarrassed we got Pride what
[1:43:53] it is but we try to justify
[1:43:56] ourselves I know what I'm talking
[1:43:58] about right so we'll hide those things
[1:44:02] we we got so much
[1:44:04] pride but we got to be able to Humble
[1:44:07] ourselves look when when when when we if
[1:44:11] we ain't careful we can let these things
[1:44:14] become
[1:44:16] so because of that complex that's in
[1:44:20] this message we we we become so
[1:44:24] uh on
[1:44:25] defense that we won't go to our past
[1:44:28] remember when he when God ascended up on
[1:44:30] high he gave gifts under man and that
[1:44:33] man right there is a gift to
[1:44:38] you you say oh no he's my dad he's still
[1:44:41] a gift to you you're looking at him
[1:44:46] wrong yeah you're looking at it wrong
[1:44:50] you you think oh no brother Gabe I look
[1:44:52] he listen the thing of it is is you got
[1:44:56] to realize you got to have enough
[1:44:58] confidence look I had I'll say this my
[1:45:01] wife and I was having some problems at
[1:45:02] home right and uh uh and and I and I and
[1:45:07] I you know I tried to F you we Brothers

[1:46:04] yeah come on brother and you know as and
[1:46:07] I'm going to show you something here in
[1:46:08] a minute but but the thing of it is is I
[1:46:12] had
[1:46:14] to I had to humble
[1:46:17] myself preacher or no preacher
[1:46:23] look you could have you you Brothers
[1:46:24] could have be in this message longer
[1:46:26] than brother Dale that does not give you
[1:46:28] senority over him CU he's he's the angel
[1:46:33] to this
[1:46:37] church that's what that's what brother
[1:46:39] Brenham called him brother Brenham said
[1:46:41] is the pastor is the Angel to the
[1:46:45] church but but the thing of it is is we
[1:46:48] have to receive it as
[1:46:51] such and and thing of it is is is when I
[1:46:54] when when wifey and I went to when wifey
[1:46:57] and I went to our pastor and and Pastor
[1:47:01] you know what as he started talking to
[1:47:03] us he pulled out a little pen in a piece
[1:47:04] of paper I'm going to show you what he
[1:47:06] drew to me to us but the thing of it is
[1:47:09] is he didn't he didn't show us five
[1:47:11] steps to a better
[1:47:13] marriage he didn't pull out Dr
[1:47:16] dos but that be see because I told my
[1:47:19] wife I said listen babe we are not going
[1:47:22] to Chad
[1:47:25] L
[1:47:26] right
[1:47:29] right now you say brother gab there's so
[1:47:31] many people following men I
[1:47:35] know I know there is and there's so many
[1:47:38] pastors taking advantage of it yeah and
[1:47:40] you was one of them that's why you're
[1:47:46] defensive but just because people abuse
[1:47:50] the office does not take away God's
[1:47:54] word you have to find a pastor that you
[1:47:57] can submit to that he understands his
[1:48:01] position that's
[1:48:03] ke and he knows that he's going to be
[1:48:05] accountable he's going to handle it
[1:48:07] reverently with a Godly
[1:48:09] fear right see that's how God designed
[1:48:13] it and so we have to realize that Pastor
[1:48:16] the prophet is just not the the end all
[1:48:19] be all right that's right am true it's
[1:48:25] true yes but then the thing of it is is
[1:48:27] then we get we get caught up and and and
[1:48:30] we got four or five of our favorite
[1:48:34] pastors that's a problem
[1:48:39] too and we have so many voices well
[1:48:43] brother so and so preaches and brother
[1:48:44] Dell Don't Preach brother so L stop you
[1:48:48] got way too many voices you're p p too
[1:48:50] many dread
[1:48:51] directions right
[1:48:55] that's why I say lady oia is the most
[1:48:57] complex age of trauma cuz things are
[1:49:00] coming from so many ways that's why I
[1:49:02] say listen what I did and what I
[1:49:05] encourage you to do if you don't take
[1:49:07] anything from this take this from me
[1:49:10] what I want I hope that you do is you
[1:49:13] need to set across
[1:49:15] yourself and counsel
[1:49:21] yourself because was what's your name
[1:49:24] young man Elliott all right so me and my
[1:49:28] buddy
[1:49:29] Elliott if Elliott comes to me after
[1:49:31] service he said brother Gabe I'm like
[1:49:34] yeah what's up what's going on brother
[1:49:36] he said brother Gabe I got this and uh
[1:49:39] you know and he he starts telling me
[1:49:43] when when Elliott tells me what he's
[1:49:46] going through I'm going to look at that
[1:49:49] boy and I'm going to do everything I can
[1:49:52] to find Grace to help in his time of
[1:49:58] need but the but the what I
[1:50:01] realized is I would have all kinds of
[1:50:04] Grace for everybody
[1:50:06] else but I held only myself to a
[1:50:09] different
[1:50:10] standard because of the trauma in my
[1:50:13] life see I had to counsel myself as a
[1:50:16] eight-year-old boy that's taking drinks
[1:50:19] of alcohol in the first and second grade
[1:50:23] that set me on a road P wrong
[1:50:25] path that that before I was at the age
[1:50:28] of accountability I would had
[1:50:30] pornography within Arm's
[1:50:34] Reach my whole
[1:50:37] life but see I was holding myself to
[1:50:41] this message
[1:50:46] standard but what I did is I set
[1:50:49] across that eight-year-old little boy
[1:50:52] that I showed you
[1:50:54] earlier I set across
[1:50:57] him and you know what brother
[1:50:59] Dale when I started talking to
[1:51:03] him I looked at him in a different way
[1:51:06] right amen cuz I realized look
[1:51:11] Gabe it wasn't your fault buddy
[1:51:16] yeah it wasn't your
[1:51:19] fault brother Carson the hardest person
[1:51:21] to forgive
[1:51:23] is yourself
[1:51:25] yeah because we can we can have all kind
[1:51:28] of Grace for our favorite
[1:51:31] people right our favorite people in the
[1:51:33] church when we we have all but when we
[1:51:36] look at ourselves we can look at
[1:51:38] ourselves with such
[1:51:40] criticism but you have to set AC that's
[1:51:43] why I say and when I set across from
[1:51:45] myself and I looked at myself honestly
[1:51:49] something unlocked in me
[1:51:53] yes amen amen
[1:51:57] see when when when you set across
[1:52:02] yourself
[1:52:07] yeah you have to set across yourself you
[1:52:10] say brother Gabe I don't want to relieve
[1:52:13] the
[1:52:16] pain nobody
[1:52:19] does nobody wants to relive it right
[1:52:23] some of the trauma we've had we've
[1:52:25] stuffed it just like that girl we put it
[1:52:27] I I never even thought about that
[1:52:28] because it's so
[1:52:30] suppressed but the thing of it is
[1:52:33] friends if you never deal with it if you
[1:52:36] never deal with that trauma you you will
[1:52:39] eventually deal with that trauma through
[1:52:41] your
[1:52:43] children cuz you will pass it on to the
[1:52:45] next
[1:52:48] Generation
[1:52:50] true if you never deal with the pain
[1:52:54] unconsciously you will pass it on to
[1:52:57] them that's why generationally we see it
[1:53:00] go from generation to generation and we
[1:53:03] see that family and they all act
[1:53:09] alike see we can all come to church
[1:53:13] friends but if we come to church and
[1:53:15] there's no
[1:53:17] change I I I didn't come here just to
[1:53:19] wow you with with my imagery of a power
[1:53:22] point I I didn't I I could care less I I
[1:53:26] I I just know that I can't I I want to
[1:53:29] live I want to give every aspect to try
[1:53:31] to show you every facet so that
[1:53:34] something can unlock in you that's what
[1:53:36] I want that's what I want to happen that
[1:53:39] you really go in those dark places in
[1:53:43] your life and ask yourself God why do I
[1:53:47] tick the way that I
[1:53:51] tick why am I Lord so
[1:53:55] defensive because if you're somebody
[1:53:57] that's so defensive and you're really
[1:53:59] defensive what you have is you have
[1:54:01] trauma in your past you've never dealt
[1:54:06] with and so you've got all these
[1:54:09] mechanisms where you're trying to
[1:54:11] protect yourself all the
[1:54:15] time it's true I mean it just it it it
[1:54:19] it's just the way that it is but you
[1:54:21] know the the thing of it is brother
[1:54:23] Brandon preached doors and doors I'm not
[1:54:25] going to look at the time is that okay
[1:54:27] is that okay everybody okay yeah brother
[1:54:31] Brandon preached doors and doors right
[1:54:34] and so and so the thing of it is is he
[1:54:36] talks about letting them in the door of
[1:54:37] your heart and he just stand you can let
[1:54:39] God in just enough and let him stand at
[1:54:41] the threshold but you have to go through
[1:54:44] all these corridors I'm not I'm talking
[1:54:46] about the one way at the end of the hall
[1:54:48] that nobody goes
[1:54:50] to there's where you need to go because
[1:54:53] this is this is what happened this is
[1:54:55] what my pastor showed me my pastor drew
[1:54:58] a little box I put a heart
[1:55:00] there and he sat us down and he drew a
[1:55:03] little stick figure and he put a line
[1:55:05] going to that box and he says things
[1:55:08] happened in our
[1:55:17] past and you know what we get hurt
[1:55:24] we get
[1:55:26] hurt think you know if if Satan you know
[1:55:29] why Try Satan tries so hard to injure
[1:55:31] little ones whenever they're 8 nine 10
[1:55:33] years old cuz if he can if he can break
[1:55:36] them when they're young he'll probably
[1:55:39] have a good chance of having them the
[1:55:40] rest of their
[1:55:42] life that's right that's why it's so
[1:55:45] important for us to shelter our children
[1:55:47] I'm not talking about smothering them
[1:55:49] but I'm talking about being watchful
[1:55:51] right I I told I told I told my children
[1:55:54] while back uh I was was talking about
[1:55:56] sleepovers I said listen I said I said
[1:55:59] you know what when you get older and the
[1:56:01] only counseling you have to have with
[1:56:03] brother Chad is that you never got to go
[1:56:05] have a sleepover praise the
[1:56:09] Lord praise the
[1:56:11] Lord hey that's fine okay brother Chad
[1:56:15] counsel all you want do brother that's
[1:56:18] right yeah right yes sir cuz there's so
[1:56:21] many horror stories brother listen
[1:56:24] listen them three little ones ain't been
[1:56:26] away from my wife but but a few hours
[1:56:27] their whole lives right unless unless
[1:56:31] there was a room full of just sisters
[1:56:33] and girls and yeah no testosterone in
[1:56:37] the home man I hope you understand what
[1:56:40] I'm saying right listen CU I tell you
[1:56:44] what brother one thing for certain I
[1:56:46] know you know I know the pain that
[1:56:49] happened in my childhood and I am
[1:56:51] certainly not going to pass it on to my
[1:56:53] my next Generation ain't no way no sir
[1:56:58] so so problems happen wounds happen we
[1:57:01] get hurt right and the problem of it is
[1:57:04] the Bible says this the spirit of man
[1:57:08] will sustain his infirmity but a wounded
[1:57:11] Spirit who can
[1:57:15] bear and so when we go through
[1:57:18] life brother bandham told us we have bod
[1:57:22] spirit and and soul and and so in that
[1:57:26] Spirit realm he said conscience memory
[1:57:29] reason imagination and
[1:57:31] affection
[1:57:32] right so we can get wounded in our
[1:57:36] spirit we can get wounded in our
[1:57:40] affection let a let a brother you ever
[1:57:43] hug a brother it's like hugging a wall
[1:57:45] yeah if that brother would be honest and
[1:57:48] he Chase it back you know what happened
[1:57:50] he probably didn't have a daddy that
[1:57:51] loved him you didn't have a daddy that
[1:57:53] hugged him and a daddy that was
[1:57:55] affectionate my daddy when I was little
[1:57:58] my daddy would sleep back to back when I
[1:58:00] was little I go to his house on the
[1:58:01] weekends I love that man right but I'll
[1:58:04] tell you this when when I was little
[1:58:06] Mama never did I ever remember my mom
[1:58:08] loving me and hugging me and kissing me
[1:58:10] it was only my daddy it wasn't until I
[1:58:13] was like Teenage that she started and
[1:58:15] when she did it was
[1:58:17] like
[1:58:19] yeah right
[1:58:22] right but but see I had to go back I had
[1:58:26] to look why why do I resist her as a
[1:58:28] grown man I don't but I but I had to go
[1:58:31] back and I had to
[1:58:33] oh but Dad Dad me and him right I mean
[1:58:39] yeah right closest 19 is to 20 yeah but
[1:58:43] but but so so but because of that and
[1:58:47] brother bam tells us that that if you
[1:58:50] don't show him love somebody they will
[1:58:52] yes sir am so them little ones them them
[1:58:56] three they ain't too little they you
[1:58:57] know hey brother look they daddy always
[1:59:01] poured on that love yes sir hey they
[1:59:04] know they you know I tell you something
[1:59:06] else you ask them now they know Daddy
[1:59:09] will die for me yes sir amen that's good
[1:59:13] preach I told them when they was little
[1:59:14] listen cuz you know somebody say I'll
[1:59:16] kill your daddy you know what they look
[1:59:18] at him daddy will die for me yeah yeah
[1:59:22] yeah yeah no rep yeah yeah that you say
[1:59:27] oh they they know that do they have you
[1:59:29] ever told them

[1:59:34] know that yeah I wanted my children to
[1:59:37] know yes daddy will die for
[1:59:42] you and you know the thing of it is is
[1:59:44] it gives them a
[1:59:45] confidence cuz they know
[1:59:48] oh see they they it grain something in
[1:59:53] them and it puts something deep down in
[1:59:56] their
[1:59:57] subconscious that they know since a
[2:00:00] birth they know Daddy will die for me it
[2:00:04] wasn't just once or
[2:00:06] twice because children need that's what
[2:00:10] I needed as a little boy I needed that
[2:00:13] Assurance I needed that safety I needed
[2:00:16] that protection that whenever I would go
[2:00:19] to sleep and have a nightmare I didn't
[2:00:21] have some somebody that I could hug I
[2:00:23] got pushed
[2:00:25] away even now there's six 16 and I tell
[2:00:29] them I told him last night listen if
[2:00:31] come get me if you need
[2:00:35] me you know why cuz I always wanted
[2:00:38] somebody to tell me that when I was a
[2:00:41] little boy
[2:00:44] right see you can break the cycle you
[2:00:47] say oh I had a bad life so did I brother
[2:00:50] Gabriel had a listen afterwards we'll
[2:00:52] meet outside and we can compare who had
[2:00:54] the worst life yeah let put it on me
[2:00:57] let's go but but but what does that
[2:01:00] matter what does that matter we had a
[2:01:02] rough life we got a great
[2:01:06] Gody
[2:01:08] God but the thing of it is do we want to
[2:01:12] be healed you ever notied some people
[2:01:15] don't want to be healed they like being
[2:01:19] hurt you ever you ever meet somebody
[2:01:21] when your sick they're
[2:01:27] sick you can't nobody one person be sick
[2:01:31] somebody sick then this person got to be
[2:01:32] sick that person loves to be injured
[2:01:36] right they want to be wounded all the
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:41] time and it's the same way in the house
[2:01:43] of God people want yeah to be hurt they
[2:01:48] don't want to be healed or they never
[2:01:50] tell you right but there is a b and
[2:01:53] Gilead don't tell me there ain't I know
[2:01:56] what I've been through this this gospel
[2:01:59] is more than just quotes on a page these
[2:02:02] are the unfailing realities of a living
[2:02:07] God the truth
[2:02:10] amen this message is real yes amen this
[2:02:13] ain't just you know some some some man
[2:02:16] that passed away in the 60s and we're
[2:02:17] following this man in these you know ego
[2:02:20] belt Buck teachings come on friends
[2:02:24] yeah this is this is
[2:02:27] life we're talking about somebody just
[2:02:30] like Moses what would you do if you had
[2:02:32] a TW 1,200 Scrolls of Moses word for
[2:02:36] word for btim
[2:02:44] rightow the Bible tells us oh
[2:02:48] Jerusalem wash thine heart from
[2:02:50] wickedness
[2:02:52] that thou mayest be
[2:02:55] saved how long shall vain thoughts Lodge
[2:03:00] within
[2:03:04] thee how
[2:03:12] long in your
[2:03:15] memory that Spirit
[2:03:18] realm conscience memory reasoning
[2:03:21] reasoning every time somebody does
[2:03:24] something your reasoning was wounded and
[2:03:27] because your reasoning was wounded every
[2:03:30] time you you are
[2:03:36] just so you got to look in the
[2:03:39] mirror and you got to counsel that
[2:03:42] little girl yeah
[2:03:46] Brothers you got to counsel that little
[2:03:49] boy
[2:03:52] see cuz in life I know this is kind of
[2:03:55] childish but trauma happens yeah at all
[2:04:00] stages of Life yes sir yes sir and
[2:04:04] sometimes it's
[2:04:06] compounded right wound after wound after
[2:04:10] wound after wound and if we ain't
[2:04:14] careful we create a
[2:04:16] filter yes
[2:04:20] sir right
[2:04:23] right that was made for
[2:04:28] coffee but that's a man-made
[2:04:31] filter and that's exactly what we
[2:04:34] create and when we get wounded
[2:04:36] everything in life goes through that
[2:04:39] filter and that's why we see everything
[2:04:42] wrong every and right that mother Harlot
[2:04:45] church and these denominational people
[2:04:48] and then we get then we get a conspiracy
[2:04:51] theory Spirit on us and we spend more
[2:04:54] time on X and uh you know whatever than
[2:04:58] the gospel yeah and it's just feeding
[2:05:01] all of those
[2:05:03] complexes yeah the well brother listen
[2:05:06] we know listen to the message we know
[2:05:08] that that there's a conspiracy we know
[2:05:11] we know it's the Catholic
[2:05:13] church but brother gavee the post
[2:05:15] getting ready to die yeah I I just want
[2:05:17] to die today I don't not really too much
[2:05:20] worried about him the man I'm worried
[2:05:22] about dying I'm worried about this man
[2:05:24] dying
[2:05:25] today you know I I'm sorry I I'm not
[2:05:29] worri I'm not worried about the next
[2:05:30] Pope right
[2:05:32] right but if but but if you're feed
[2:05:34] those conspiracies and that I'm not
[2:05:36] going to be here when that
[2:05:40] Antichrist right so so the thing of it
[2:05:43] is but we have to be mindful it's what
[2:05:45] is our
[2:05:47] filter see because we know it's got to
[2:05:49] be a thinking man's filter and if and if
[2:05:51] if somebody could be pouring into the
[2:05:53] oil and the wine
[2:05:57] right but is it really going to get to
[2:05:59] you if it's going through that filter
[2:06:02] right right see it has brother BR said a
[2:06:05] thinking man's filter and I'm I'm I'm
[2:06:08] trying to bring it to a
[2:06:09] close but but here's here's the thing
[2:06:12] what happens is and and I know maybe
[2:06:15] some of you like oh man please brother
[2:06:17] Gabe that guy's wearing me out
[2:06:23] that guy I you know what I hope he is
[2:06:26] you know I wanted you know when I was
[2:06:28] building this I thought man he is
[2:06:30] annoying
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:36] me and you know what I hope he's
[2:06:39] annoying
[2:06:40] you you know why because of the
[2:06:44] unforgiveness that we've left in our
[2:06:45] heart way longer than what this little
[2:06:47] stick figure has been on the screen
[2:06:52] he's only been on this screen a few 20
[2:06:54] minutes 10 minutes whatever but some of
[2:06:57] us have been packing things for
[2:07:03] years
[2:07:06] years and instead of dealing with
[2:07:10] it we build walls yes sir yeah amen but
[2:07:15] here's what I want to bring you
[2:07:17] to
[2:07:19] is remember whatever trauma you had in
[2:07:23] life if you have
[2:07:25] unforgiveness that person could have
[2:07:27] moved away passed away they could be six
[2:07:31] feet deep but do you know that you're
[2:07:33] chained to them if you have not forgiven
[2:07:39] them but this is what our pastor did for
[2:07:42] us he did
[2:07:49] this he said see cuz
[2:07:52] when wifey and I was having problems we
[2:07:55] realized he told us he said there's
[2:07:57] nothing wrong with you two right you
[2:08:00] know where the problem was there was a
[2:08:03] 8-year-old little
[2:08:04] boy and there was a 8-year-old little
[2:08:09] girl and those were the two that had the
[2:08:17] problems and so when you forgive
[2:08:20] somebody
[2:08:22] when you forgive you are actually
[2:08:25] breaking that chain and you are re what
[2:08:27] am I preaching on the release of
[2:08:30] forgiveness when you forgive it releases
[2:08:33] you now watch remember remember wait a
[2:08:37] minute brother gab justice has to be
[2:08:39] served and that's exactly right but
[2:08:44] watch when
[2:08:46] Jesus died he died for my
[2:08:50] sins so he was the innocent
[2:08:53] one Justice had to be served and so he
[2:08:58] paid the
[2:09:01] price so
[2:09:03] he paid the price he said put it on my
[2:09:09] account
[2:09:11] yes God he didn't ask nobody to you look
[2:09:15] no strings attached brother Carson you
[2:09:17] don't owe me
[2:09:19] nothing I frankly forgive you is what
[2:09:23] Jesus did he said father forgive them
[2:09:26] right don't let it be laid to their
[2:09:29] charge watch so so what what are we
[2:09:33] supposed to
[2:09:40] do see this is true
[2:09:44] Christianity when we release them yes
[2:09:47] and we say I'm forgiving I don't have to
[2:09:50] go back and find them I don't have to
[2:09:52] track them I don't have to Facebook
[2:09:54] stalk them to find out where they
[2:09:57] are it has nothing to do with them it
[2:10:01] has everything to do with God and
[2:10:04] you and so what you do is you frankly
[2:10:09] forgive them and what you do this is
[2:10:11] what's so beautiful if you want we say
[2:10:13] we want to be like
[2:10:15] Jesus Oh to be like oh
[2:10:21] yeah oh no we got to be like
[2:10:25] Jesus so what do we do see this is true
[2:10:30] forgiveness not you have to fall before
[2:10:33] me not Justice they they owe me an
[2:10:36] apology because they're a
[2:10:39] preacher
[2:10:41] right true no no no no true
[2:10:46] forgiveness is you're saying I forgive
[2:10:50] them and and they owe me a
[2:10:53] debt but I'm going to pay the
[2:11:00] price put it on my
[2:11:03] account and that what Stephen said Lord
[2:11:06] let it not be laid to their
[2:11:10] charge right Lord I will pay the
[2:11:16] price what they've done to me they
[2:11:19] deserve punishment amen they are guilty
[2:11:22] as the day is
[2:11:25] long but you know
[2:11:29] what I'm going to
[2:11:33] release I'm going to
[2:11:35] release my
[2:11:39] barabus praise
[2:11:42] God Amen somebody has to go
[2:11:47] free and what we
[2:11:50] do is we
[2:11:52] say let them go
[2:11:58] free you say brother
[2:12:00] Gabe whoa whoa whoa
[2:12:03] whoa I don't know about
[2:12:08] that well that that's okay for the easy
[2:12:11] things brother Gabe but there's some
[2:12:12] really really bad
[2:12:15] things and and and I want I want you to
[2:12:19] understand I am not discre riting
[2:12:23] anything any trauma that's happened in
[2:12:25] your
[2:12:27] life because sometimes things happen
[2:12:30] that are so deep it takes a long time to
[2:12:33] get
[2:12:36] over it's not going to happen in just
[2:12:38] one
[2:12:42] setting
[2:12:43] right but don't tell me that there can't
[2:12:47] be healing
[2:12:52] you you you know you know oh man we
[2:12:58] got Jesus see don't make your situation
[2:13:04] different right I know I'm going long
[2:13:07] but please just please just please just
[2:13:09] bear with me please I know I'm sorry the
[2:13:12] little ones they they but but I just
[2:13:16] want you to understand I know it's not
[2:13:19] easy I know if it was everyone would do
[2:13:26] it you say brother Gabe how do I get
[2:13:31] over how do I how do I actually
[2:13:36] forgive from my
[2:13:39] heart cuz brother Gabe I've said it but
[2:13:42] there's still something
[2:13:43] there and I've said it over and over and
[2:13:46] over and I can't get rid of it it
[2:13:48] takes time yeah
[2:13:51] brother bandom tells us this he says if
[2:13:54] I have found Grace in your sight through
[2:13:56] God you take my word for this you take
[2:13:59] my word for this Brethren if you want to
[2:14:00] get a bless want a blessing and get a
[2:14:02] blessing when a man has done you wrong
[2:14:04] and has absolutely justly mean he's done
[2:14:06] you wrong and you know he's done you
[2:14:08] wrong he's done you evil don't mention
[2:14:10] that you take him to prayer before God
[2:14:13] and don't take it in the way of just a
[2:14:14] sinful I'm supposed to do this but stand
[2:14:16] with your shoulder to his
[2:14:18] shoulder and stand in the presence of
[2:14:20] God father where we prayer should be in
[2:14:23] the presence of God say father he's my
[2:14:25] brother and he's justly he deserve
[2:14:27] punishment because he done me evil I
[2:14:29] don't know see why I did it and then let
[2:14:32] God go to talking to you and you'll see
[2:14:35] maybe what that's man been through the
[2:14:39] devil has Twisted him up somewhere
[2:14:42] caused him and do that though he's
[2:14:44] absolutely
[2:14:47] wrong here's the key
[2:14:51] we have to go to the throne of
[2:14:55] God and he says before you leave the
[2:14:58] Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry
[2:15:01] for that man yes sir you'll be
[2:15:03] sympathizing with that brother and when
[2:15:06] you get back down to Earth again you'll
[2:15:07] go over to that brother shake his hand
[2:15:09] cuz you know what he's been through you
[2:15:12] can stand you can't stand it with the
[2:15:14] Mortal in the presence of God and
[2:15:15] condemn anybody I don't believe no sir
[2:15:18] not if he's even a rank sinner what
[2:15:20] about a brother that's made a mistake
[2:15:22] though he's done wrong sometimes accus
[2:15:24] when he when he's when he's not
[2:15:27] wrong but if he but if he's wrong well
[2:15:30] if we'll take him to the throne of God
[2:15:32] and stand there shoulder to- shoulder
[2:15:34] with our brother knowing he's IM mortal
[2:15:37] and maybe his destination rest upon our
[2:15:40] attitude towards him when we come back
[2:15:43] from the Throne of God we'll realize
[2:15:46] that we're everyone guilty and we'll all
[2:15:48] need help one with the other and the
[2:15:51] best way to do is
[2:15:55] pray so how brother this is this is
[2:15:59] Brother bram's
[2:16:03] formula this is the formula for True
[2:16:08] forgiveness cuz things happen in life
[2:16:12] that we can't handle on our
[2:16:15] own but if we can get serious enough
[2:16:22] amen
[2:16:24] amen and get into the presence of God
[2:16:28] there's the
[2:16:30] key first give him a little worship amen
[2:16:34] yeah Hallelujah right thank you Lord
[2:16:37] Jesus and when we get into that
[2:16:40] presence listen this quote is a reality
[2:16:44] to
[2:16:47] me because I I I know the pain that I've
[2:16:50] had had in my life but I know the
[2:16:53] healing that's come from
[2:16:56] it and and when you when you take
[2:17:00] whatever that person is that's done you
[2:17:02] wrong and you in the sincerity of your
[2:17:06] heart go in your prayer closet and put
[2:17:10] your arm you said I don't want to put
[2:17:11] put your arm around them anyways yeah
[2:17:13] right and put your arm around them in
[2:17:16] your prayer closet you alone and you say
[2:17:20] God this person has hurt
[2:17:23] me and when you pray with that
[2:17:27] sincerity God I'm telling you I I I I
[2:17:30] stand as a witness God will show you
[2:17:33] things about that person of why they
[2:17:36] tick the way that they
[2:17:38] tick cuz you know when I come back from
[2:17:40] the presence of God I
[2:17:42] realized wait a
[2:17:44] minute my stepdad's dad was an alcoholic
[2:17:55] right see then it goes beyond Jim
[2:18:00] Naylor it it goes to the enemy that's
[2:18:03] got them all twisted up through the
[2:18:10] lineage and then we don't look at flesh
[2:18:12] and blood and we realize that it's a
[2:18:16] whole different Dynamic right that it's
[2:18:20] the devil
[2:18:22] right and you know what you will come
[2:18:26] back from the Throne of God feeling
[2:18:27] sorry for that
[2:18:29] person and you know what you cannot do
[2:18:32] that in your own
[2:18:35] ability that's why we need
[2:18:38] God that's what that's the unfailing
[2:18:40] realities of God that he can step in and
[2:18:43] bring healing in our lives and some of
[2:18:46] the deepest wounds
[2:18:51] that man cannot touch that listen Pastor
[2:18:55] can't touch Pastor can enter into a
[2:18:58] channel and he can unlock something and
[2:19:00] get you to see it but then you have to
[2:19:03] step
[2:19:05] in you have to go say yes Lord I am
[2:19:10] wrong Lord I am standing in the need of
[2:19:13] prayer I am the one Lord it is
[2:19:19] me you know
[2:19:21] if if if we don't if if we
[2:19:26] don't look we all have to come to this
[2:19:33] spot cuz we all want
[2:19:36] forgiveness but can we
[2:19:43] forgive can you from the sincerity of
[2:19:47] your
[2:19:48] heart some of the deepest wounds
[2:19:52] your darkest of
[2:19:54] darks things you haven't thought about
[2:19:57] for years maybe maybe come back to the
[2:19:59] surface as we can maybe have the
[2:20:01] musicians
[2:20:03] come you know if if there's
[2:20:07] something
[2:20:10] that strikes you and you say Lord you
[2:20:15] know it's not easy to say well I've been
[2:20:18] a Christian 20 years I've been this 30
[2:20:20] years
[2:20:21] and then you go back to 1975 and you go
[2:20:24] [Music]
[2:20:25] ooh oh yeah I
[2:20:29] forgot or that person that person that
[2:20:34] that person that hurt
[2:20:37] you and every time you see him or maybe
[2:20:40] you
[2:20:41] avoid that family
[2:20:46] function right
[2:20:54] maybe maybe it's a
[2:21:00] sibling family
[2:21:02] member
[2:21:04] friend whatever hurt listen we all got
[2:21:08] them and unfortunately to varying
[2:21:13] degrees
[2:21:15] but I
[2:21:19] believe that we we have a
[2:21:22] God that heals every one of our
[2:21:26] diseases even the sin sick
[2:21:30] disease if we can
[2:21:33] just get quiet enough get still enough
[2:21:37] it says you play something soft maybe
[2:21:42] listen can you take a minute you say
[2:21:44] brother gab you going long
[2:21:46] listen what if today is our last day
[2:21:50] true what if what if could be you know I
[2:21:54] mean who knows what Trump's going to say
[2:21:59] today
[2:22:01] right
[2:22:02] but what what if today is the day do do
[2:22:07] you
[2:22:08] really want to kick the can down the
[2:22:10] road and roll the dice and hope you get
[2:22:13] another
[2:22:18] day or do you want to sit ACR
[2:22:21] crossed you
[2:22:23] say I I do may maybe if we could stand
[2:22:27] and bow our
[2:22:29] heads could we could we take a minute
[2:22:33] yes
[2:22:34] amen could we could we take a minute
[2:22:37] look seven seven seals seven Thunders
[2:22:40] and we can all have all the knowledge
[2:22:42] and we can have all the quotes and have
[2:22:44] all the scriptures lined out and all
[2:22:46] those things that's all fine and dandy
[2:22:49] but if you got unbelief in your heart
[2:22:51] what good is it doing
[2:22:53] you what good is it doing
[2:22:57] you if if if we're cold and indifferent
[2:23:01] and
[2:23:02] struggling what what good is our is our
[2:23:06] understanding of this message if we if
[2:23:09] we sit here or stand this morning with
[2:23:11] unforgiveness in our
[2:23:17] heart could we could we bow our heads
[2:23:20] and close our
[2:23:21] eyes and
[2:23:24] counsel with our little adolescent
[2:23:31] self every head bowed every eye
[2:23:35] closed could you just let's just take a
[2:23:38] moment and if there's something in your
[2:23:40] heart if there's something in your
[2:23:43] mind let let today be the
[2:23:47] day that healing becomes complete
[2:23:53] don't don't leave your
[2:23:58] seat with that unforgiveness still in
[2:24:00] your
[2:24:03] heart I I don't think the Lord would put
[2:24:06] this on my heart if there ain't at least
[2:24:08] one here that's battling with it maybe
[2:24:14] more but I ask you
[2:24:20] is
[2:24:22] there something that needs to come to
[2:24:25] that
[2:24:28] Throne can you let go of it this morning
[2:24:31] brother and
[2:24:34] sister could
[2:24:37] you could you maybe just talk it over
[2:24:41] with the Lord and say Lord I've carried
[2:24:43] this long enough
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:24:53] we'd be happy to pray with you you want
[2:24:57] to come to the alt whatever you
[2:25:00] feel would take for you to have that
[2:25:05] freedom but listen don't worry about
[2:25:07] who's looking or who's watching or who
[2:25:10] may see you may not have
[2:25:13] tomorrow don't let Pride keep you in
[2:25:16] your
[2:25:17] seat don't don't let worrying about what
[2:25:20] what somebody's going to think or but if
[2:25:24] there's something that's coming up God's
[2:25:28] it's not brother Gabe that's bringing it
[2:25:30] up that's the Holy Spirit bringing it up
[2:25:33] in your heart so that you can get rid of
[2:25:35] it this
[2:25:38] morning could you let it
[2:25:42] go will you let it
[2:25:47] go can you be the one

[2:26:15] pray in Jesus name
[2:26:18] that you would be there
[2:26:22] helper Lord that they
[2:26:28] would have grace and mercy in their
[2:26:30] heart
[2:26:31] enough to draw that
[2:26:34] line and
[2:26:37] let that thing go that's held him for so
[2:26:43] long Lord that they would Brick by Brick
[2:26:47] Tear Down the Walls
[2:26:51] that your great Holy Spirit would begin
[2:26:52] to minister to their
[2:26:55] needs Lord I just a
[2:26:59] man but you are the god in which we
[2:27:03] serve and I
[2:27:08] pray that your voice would go beyond
[2:27:12] mine and touch their
[2:27:16] hearts Lord that they would be able to
[2:27:18] leave
[2:27:20] this hollowed
[2:27:23] Sanctuary with a lighter
[2:27:26] load the burden of life would be
[2:27:29] lifted and that your great Holy Spirit
[2:27:33] would take its place of that burden that
[2:27:37] they've
[2:27:38] carried God you see the needs
[2:27:41] represented
[2:27:43] here I just pray in jesus' name that you
[2:27:47] would soften hearts Lord
[2:27:51] help them
[2:27:52] to surrender and yield to you that you
[2:27:57] would be able to minister to their
[2:28:00] hearts Lord that they would be able to
[2:28:03] let whatever is holding them that they
[2:28:05] would release Lord that they would let
[2:28:07] it go that they would see that it's not
[2:28:10] that thing holding them but it's them
[2:28:12] that's holding that
[2:28:14] thing I pray in Jesus name that you
[2:28:16] would be their
[2:28:18] portion commit them into your your
[2:28:20] hands and ask these things to be
[2:28:24] so in the all sufficient name of our
