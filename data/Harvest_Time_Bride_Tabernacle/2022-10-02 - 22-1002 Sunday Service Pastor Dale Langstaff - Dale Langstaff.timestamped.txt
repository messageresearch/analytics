[31:18] the song service thank you musicians
[31:19] let's turn to Matthew 24 and and uh I
[31:23] want to preach on Election this morning
[31:26] and I believe
[31:28] is just uh just a fantastic
[31:32] uh privilege to be elected
[31:35] and there's a way and you know I want to
[31:37] even before we read our scripture I say
[31:39] you know only the elected
[31:42] are in a battle
[31:46] only the elected are in a battle
[31:49] so those that were born
[31:51] you know what Jesus said to the ones he
[31:53] said you are of your fathers the devil
[31:55] they're not in a battle
[31:57] because they're already where they're
[32:00] going
[32:00] there's there's not no battle
[32:02] but because we were bypassed our
[32:05] theophany
[32:06] and we're a Triune being we have this
[32:10] Badger skin
[32:12] and it's fighting against our theophany
[32:15] and as soon as we lay down our Badger
[32:17] skin you know when I was a kid we used
[32:19] to hunt skins and when they dried out
[32:21] when they really dry out
[32:23] they're easy to store
[32:27] we just get this dried out
[32:30] all right see often he'll come
[32:33] oh praise God Amen Matthew 24 let's just
[32:36] start at uh verse 37 or maybe read to 39
[32:40] now you know well we read our scriptures
[32:43] we'll start Matthew 24. but as in the
[32:47] days of Noah were so shall it be in the
[32:50] Sun the coming of the son of man be
[32:53] whereas many in the days
[32:55] that were before the flood they were
[32:58] eating and drinking marrying and giving
[32:59] in marriage until the day that Noah
[33:02] entered the Ark
[33:05] and knew not until the flood came and
[33:08] took them all away
[33:09] so shall it be
[33:13] in the also in the coming of the son of
[33:16] man be Lord Jesus we ask you to bless
[33:19] your word this morning to us and bless
[33:22] your bride and may you come and minister
[33:24] to us all this morning we pray in your
[33:27] beautiful name amen you may have your
[33:30] seats this morning let's just turn over
[33:32] to Genesis 6 6.
[33:34] Genesis 6 6 and you know most people
[33:36] when they read this scripture we think
[33:38] of the evil side of the age
[33:42] we think of you know when when we think
[33:44] of as in the days of Noah we think well
[33:46] it was wicked and so it's wicked today
[33:49] but we don't want to preach on that
[33:52] amen you know in everything the Bible
[33:55] says when Satan comes in like a flood
[33:58] God will raise up a standard against him
[34:01] and you know Satan has a program and
[34:04] Satan's doing things in the world
[34:07] by Jehovah God
[34:10] is also doing something God has a plan
[34:13] and you know when Satan's family is
[34:16] doing things and there's manifestations
[34:18] in Satan's kingdom
[34:20] there's greater manifestations
[34:22] and the family of God
[34:24] so when we think about Noah today as in
[34:26] the days of Noah we're not going to
[34:29] think about
[34:30] the wickedness of the world
[34:33] because we want to look at another side
[34:34] and here I want to show you that we'll
[34:36] read this scripture we're going to go to
[34:38] eight Amy and it repented the Lord that
[34:40] he had made man on the earth and he
[34:43] grieved him at his heart
[34:46] wow and the Lord said I will destroy the
[34:49] man whom I have created on the face of
[34:51] the Earth both man and Beast and every
[34:54] creeping thing in the fowls of the air
[34:56] and it repented God
[34:59] that I have even made them
[35:01] now that's getting Wicked
[35:05] one more verse
[35:06] but Noah
[35:09] thound Grace and the eyes of the Lord
[35:12] hallelujah you know I want to lay this
[35:16] Foundation down just before we get into
[35:18] it more into the topic of election here
[35:20] we see that
[35:22] this is after the Garden of Eden
[35:27] and see in the Garden of Eden the Lions
[35:29] children the Lions laid down with the
[35:31] lamb and they there was no turmoil among
[35:35] the the animals
[35:37] okay
[35:38] until sin came in
[35:41] and upset
[35:43] the economy that God had planned now
[35:46] we're going back to that Garden
[35:49] but it'll be in the millennium
[35:51] and it'll be beautiful you can have a
[35:53] pat line for your kitty and it'll never
[35:56] eat you
[35:57] but here in Noah's day
[36:01] this is clearly after
[36:04] the sin and the guarded
[36:06] because we see here that God himself
[36:09] repented that he had even made man
[36:12] so I'm showing this here's here in
[36:14] Noah's day
[36:16] the lamb
[36:17] was not laying down
[36:19] with the Lions
[36:21] and the bunny rabbit when it ran out
[36:23] from the hay it was afraid of Disguise
[36:26] the eagle
[36:28] you know we're combining our harvesting
[36:30] now and the rabbits don't want to run
[36:32] out from the thing because you can see
[36:34] the Hawks just come down and just
[36:36] pick them up
[36:38] because it takes your cover
[36:40] and that this is how it was
[36:44] and Noah's day
[36:45] and sin yes had come up to a great part
[36:48] that God repented
[36:50] by God then
[36:53] had something
[36:55] to fight against Satan's economy
[36:58] and God has something today
[37:01] to fight against Satan's economy
[37:05] and it's called
[37:09] it's beautiful let me read you a quote
[37:12] that our Prophet said and it is
[37:14] beautiful
[37:15] just find it here he said
[37:18] this is talking about election now this
[37:19] watch how this is just was just
[37:24] Supernatural
[37:25] he said but in Christ you come
[37:28] by-election
[37:31] huh now watch this
[37:33] but he won't force you
[37:38] no that's a gentleman
[37:41] but the prophet don't stop there
[37:44] but he'll pull
[37:46] your heart to him
[37:49] no he won't force you
[37:51] but I feel the pull
[37:53] that's God Almighty before the
[37:55] foundation of the world he just he'll
[37:57] let you make your own choices serve and
[38:00] say but he'll have something on your
[38:01] heart
[38:02] and he'll be pulling you in
[38:06] pulling you in and you say well how in
[38:08] the world could that be
[38:10] well you know we we mentioned already
[38:12] about the animals
[38:16] now we know that right now on the day
[38:18] we're living in the whole earth growneth
[38:21] for the manifestations
[38:23] of the sons of man the whole earth is
[38:26] waiting for you to put on your theophany
[38:29] let's you know we read a scripture we'll
[38:31] maybe turn to Romans 9 Romans 9 16 so it
[38:35] says so then it is not him that willeth
[38:39] and not him that runeth but it's God
[38:43] it's God
[38:46] that pulls on your heartstrings it's God
[38:49] that shows Mercy
[38:51] amen you never woke up this morning he
[38:54] said well I believe I'll come to church
[38:55] this morning
[38:57] even though you did
[38:58] but it was God
[39:00] that it planted that and was pulling you
[39:03] yesterday your whole week
[39:06] you couldn't wait to get back in
[39:08] Fellowship
[39:09] with the body
[39:11] and the Supernatural Part here is this
[39:16] God does that
[39:17] even in animals
[39:19] and nature
[39:21] you look at this and the day of Noah
[39:25] when the animals were the prey of the
[39:27] Lions and the eagle and all these things
[39:29] just think of this case
[39:33] and Noah had preached for 120 years and
[39:36] the the community around them had deemed
[39:39] him
[39:40] Beyond
[39:42] mentally
[39:44] saying
[39:46] amen
[39:48] it never rained before
[39:51] there was no scientific evidence of it
[39:54] ever
[39:56] amen
[39:58] but hear the animals
[40:00] you know our Prophet let me let me jump
[40:02] ahead and talk about this the prophet he
[40:04] he went to India the one time and they
[40:07] were going to have a storm in India they
[40:08] have a lot of rock Cliffs and and stone
[40:10] fences and the birds make a lot of their
[40:13] their nests in the fences and the cliffs
[40:15] and the animals will take the shade in
[40:17] the afternoon Sun by The Cliffs and he
[40:20] said it was literally on the radio they
[40:22] said we don't understand why the animals
[40:25] have left the rocks
[40:29] but God understood
[40:31] because God had placed the election
[40:35] an instinct in those animals
[40:38] and before mankind could even know
[40:41] that the Earth was going to have a quake
[40:45] God's creation
[40:48] by elections
[40:49] new the something was going on you know
[40:52] look at today our scientists in the
[40:54] world and politics in the world they
[40:56] don't they can't understand why the
[40:58] world's upside down
[41:00] but if you just look at God's word it'll
[41:03] tell you why it's upside down
[41:05] it was because of the garden and the sin
[41:08] and everything's groaning for it to go
[41:10] back to the millennium
[41:12] amen which it's going to very soon I
[41:14] believe with all my heart
[41:16] but can you imagine the Uproar
[41:21] when Noah's getting ready and God by
[41:24] election calls the animals
[41:27] to come into the ark
[41:30] can you imagine the Buddy rabbit going
[41:32] in ahead of a coyote
[41:35] can you imagine a squirrel going in
[41:38] behind of a wolf
[41:40] can you imagine an eagle flying over and
[41:43] the field mice going in the ark
[41:47] now I want to tell you something
[41:48] brothers and sisters
[41:51] how in the world
[41:54] could the people that Noah had preached
[41:56] to
[41:57] for a hundred and twenty years and they
[42:00] see a lion not chasing the lamb
[42:06] go in single file
[42:08] into an ark
[42:13] whoa do you know our Prophet said
[42:18] and the Bible clearly says
[42:20] that if they would have seen the truth
[42:22] at that time
[42:24] they could have still went in
[42:30] how could they not have seen it you know
[42:34] the Bible says they have eyes
[42:36] but they cannot see
[42:38] they have ears and I'm telling you it's
[42:41] coming
[42:42] and their ears they cannot hear
[42:48] what greater sign would you want to see
[42:50] in Noah's day when you've seen that the
[42:52] animals lay down their Natural Instincts
[42:55] of eating one another
[42:58] and walk in
[43:00] single five
[43:03] amazing
[43:05] amazing
[43:07] that's election
[43:09] that was God
[43:11] pulling their hearts that's what our
[43:14] Prophet said he said he said it like
[43:16] this he said can you imagine that can
[43:19] the D or the cantaloupe or something
[43:21] eating grass
[43:22] and the first strike of lightning
[43:25] looking over
[43:26] saying honey
[43:28] it's time to get in
[43:35] it's time to get in
[43:37] and I want to tell you this morning like
[43:39] a deer or a cantaloupe honey it's time
[43:42] to get in
[43:43] because as in the days of Noah
[43:46] so shall it be in the Sun the coming of
[43:49] the son of man
[43:50] and we have arrived
[43:53] because we are in the season of the son
[43:55] of man coming
[43:57] you know our Prophet said the Rapture is
[43:59] in process right now it's it's going on
[44:03] right now you're waiting the the animals
[44:06] are going in the ark the Rapture is
[44:08] going to Glory
[44:12] and you can't see it
[44:16] you can't see it
[44:18] the world can't see it
[44:22] amazing
[44:24] amazing you think of the world can't you
[44:27] think of how many deer were in the field
[44:30] but only two went in
[44:32] you think how many lions were chasing
[44:37] but only two only two
[44:41] this way
[44:46] only two
[44:48] that's amazing
[44:50] that's why you know in every age it was
[44:54] such a small amount
[44:57] in many ages in Noah's day eight Souls
[45:01] were saved many ages just a small
[45:04] portion of the Bride elected
[45:06] predestinated now it'll be from every
[45:09] part of the earth I'm going to show you
[45:11] a video when we close just bless my
[45:14] heart I can't really watch it without
[45:17] literally
[45:19] affected me
[45:21] the bride around the world
[45:23] it's just powerful
[45:26] you you I know you believe it but you
[45:28] can't comprehend it the Bible says you
[45:31] can
[45:33] comprehend it and here our Prophet said
[45:36] that here these animals come in and all
[45:39] the world seeing these animals this
[45:42] Supernatural thing
[45:43] these animals going in
[45:48] I would have been asking some questions
[45:52] I would have been saying
[45:55] Noah we need to talk
[46:01] but because they were not in the
[46:03] election
[46:07] they had eyes
[46:09] but they couldn't see
[46:10] and you know this morning when you feel
[46:13] the tug and pull of God on your heart
[46:16] you should just lose your mind
[46:19] praising God you should just
[46:23] because the one sitting raped me said
[46:25] there was two in the bad and one was
[46:27] taken and the other was left
[46:30] there was two in the field
[46:32] and one was taken
[46:35] and the other was that
[46:39] oh
[46:41] if that ain't Amazing Grace
[46:45] amazing Mercy
[46:48] that God almighty
[46:51] saw me and you
[46:53] worthy not we weren't worthy in
[46:56] ourselves but because of him
[46:58] Paul praise God to think of the
[47:01] supernatural thing that happened even in
[47:04] the animal life
[47:07] and I got another part to talk to you
[47:09] about this you know kids you will know
[47:12] you say well how do I know if I'm
[47:14] elected
[47:15] you know the Bible and our Prophet
[47:17] clearly talked that you're under the
[47:19] umbrella of your parents
[47:21] and your parents have the baptism of the
[47:23] Holy Ghost if they're elected
[47:25] and so you're protected until you come
[47:27] to the age of accountability
[47:29] but you can tell when you get to the
[47:31] edge of the umbrella
[47:34] when you start doing things that elected
[47:36] people don't do
[47:38] see when you get to the edge of the
[47:39] umbrella the rain will fall on you if
[47:41] the umbrella won't do you no good
[47:43] and when you come out from underneath
[47:44] the umbrella of your parents protection
[47:48] it won't do you no good
[47:50] I want to show you another example not
[47:52] only did the world see the animals that
[47:54] would have ate each other normally
[47:56] walking in the ark
[48:00] these are wild beasts these aren't
[48:03] modified educated refined
[48:07] human beings
[48:09] you understand
[48:10] you know like an animal until you know
[48:13] even our kittens in the barn until we
[48:15] get them pet trained
[48:17] uh-huh
[48:18] they'll claw and bite you
[48:21] so that's called refined
[48:25] man
[48:27] but these animals that were not refined
[48:30] in any way
[48:32] through election
[48:34] could Tabernacle inside of an ark
[48:40] and not fight
[48:42] or eat each other
[48:46] for months
[48:48] and months
[48:51] you know bride don't eat bride
[48:53] you won't have an appetite for bride
[48:56] if you're a bride of Christ you won't
[48:59] have a teeth you know the children of
[49:01] Israel when they left Egypt some had a
[49:04] taste for the leeks and garlic more than
[49:06] the manna from almighty God
[49:08] God in heaven made man a Heavenly food
[49:11] can you imagine your digestive system
[49:13] how we took that I'll tell you what it
[49:16] would have been the healthiest food in
[49:17] the world
[49:19] and some said you know I'll I have a
[49:21] taste for
[49:23] and some are saying I have a taste for
[49:25] the world
[49:27] summer I have a taste for bride
[49:31] eating bride
[49:33] hear the animal Beast
[49:35] could Tabernacle in the Ark of Safety
[49:37] because that Ark meant that they were
[49:40] going to cross over
[49:42] and that they were actually it was a
[49:45] type of the tribulation the flood you
[49:47] know and Enoch taped us the bride but in
[49:49] in Noah's day that that was God's
[49:52] provided place of worship for Noah to
[49:55] cross over the tribulation the rough
[49:57] period and today kids
[50:01] Almighty the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:04] is your door
[50:06] to cross over
[50:08] the flood
[50:09] that's soon coming
[50:12] it'll be only the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:15] that'll put you in the Ark of Safety you
[50:17] know the one place the prophet said that
[50:19] actually the bride is the ark and Christ
[50:21] is the door because he said we are all
[50:23] baptized into one baptism the baptism of
[50:27] the Holy Ghost and everybody in that Ark
[50:30] we're in unison
[50:32] there was no dissension in that art
[50:36] oh it's blue
[50:42] it's beautiful think of how powerful
[50:44] election is
[50:46] powerful elections
[50:49] how in the world
[50:52] couldn't the denominations
[50:55] and the worldly people see it you know
[50:58] our Prophet said it he said to hear
[50:59] multiple places and and I know I'm I'm
[51:02] preaching to people that know this and
[51:03] believe this election he said you you
[51:06] didn't become a Christian
[51:11] nah here he said he said it's election
[51:14] he said we he said uh I wanted to get
[51:17] election strong because it's the truth
[51:19] he said now you didn't become a
[51:20] Christian just by convenience
[51:23] it don't matter how good the Evangelist
[51:25] preached which it could have been
[51:27] fantastic you didn't come to the Altar
[51:29] and just received Christ's end
[51:31] because the Bible says that no man come
[51:34] to the father
[51:35] except he
[51:36] pulled them draw them
[51:39] amen
[51:40] Hallelujah he likes it he won't take you
[51:43] against your will but he'll pull on that
[51:45] heart
[51:46] and he'll change your Earthly will you
[51:49] say look at our prophet he said I want
[51:51] to be a dropper
[51:53] period
[51:55] he said I don't want to be around people
[51:57] I want to be in the wilderness by God
[52:00] through election
[52:02] said I have a plan for your life
[52:04] and he pulled out his heart and even
[52:07] though in the mind he wanted to go that
[52:09] way his heart pulled them that way
[52:12] because of election
[52:14] oh it's beautiful
[52:17] Hallelujah the Bible says the footsteps
[52:19] of the righteous
[52:20] are ordered of the Lord
[52:23] it's beautiful that even the wildlife in
[52:25] the animals
[52:28] like when Jesus was on the boat the
[52:30] disciples even the disciples that are
[52:32] following he said even the waves and the
[52:34] wind
[52:36] obey him
[52:37] that's powerful
[52:40] that's powerful you think no no this
[52:42] listen this happened when there was
[52:44] great sin so much sin that God repented
[52:48] that he even made man
[52:50] not lying still had a taste
[52:53] for bunny rabbit
[52:55] it didn't take it away
[52:57] because we're not in the millennium
[53:03] wow
[53:06] now if you can see that in the Bible
[53:09] and you can see people around the
[53:12] fringes
[53:14] of what we believe and they have a taste
[53:18] for bunny rabbit
[53:21] then they're not in the ark
[53:25] they're not you getting me
[53:27] see you couldn't be in the Arts and have
[53:30] a taste for
[53:32] somebody else that was in the ark
[53:37] no
[53:39] oh you weren't in the art
[53:41] you were still the one that was still in
[53:42] the field
[53:43] but the other one was taken
[53:46] oh my this is so amazing thank you Lord
[53:51] he said you
[53:53] because you were a Christian before you
[53:56] came into the world you young boys you
[53:58] got to realize
[53:59] through election you were a Christian
[54:02] before you were born
[54:07] oh it's beautiful
[54:10] before the foundation of the world
[54:11] before I was born before your parents
[54:14] were born God through Mercy
[54:17] Grace
[54:19] and yes we were born in sin and we all
[54:21] went the wrong way but God had a string
[54:26] and he pulled you in
[54:29] man you weren't here by coincidence
[54:32] you are born in a message family by
[54:34] coincidence your families are teaching
[54:37] you the truth by coincidence
[54:40] it's predestination
[54:43] of almighty God
[54:45] he couldn't lose you
[54:47] because you were a part of him
[54:50] you might have been the tiniest part but
[54:53] he ain't complete
[54:55] without you oh it's beautiful you say
[54:59] well bless God I decide you to then
[55:01] decide nothing
[55:04] God decided
[55:06] Hallelujah
[55:08] and you know what
[55:10] even how our prophets that ye might
[55:12] decide contrary and God will literally
[55:15] change
[55:16] your thought pattern
[55:20] uh-huh
[55:22] most ministers will tell you that
[55:25] most ministers say oh
[55:32] but God
[55:35] some it takes more sleepless nights than
[55:37] others
[55:38] some it maybe takes more Visions or
[55:40] dreams than others
[55:41] but God
[55:44] knows how to convert and change those
[55:48] that are his
[55:49] Hallelujah he said because you you were
[55:52] a Christian before you committed the
[55:54] world before you were born God ordained
[55:56] you a Christian
[55:57] from the Garden of Eden from before the
[56:00] from before the Garden of Eden from
[56:02] before the foundation of the world it's
[56:05] beautiful
[56:07] it's beautiful even the animals
[56:11] and Noah's day
[56:13] were elected
[56:16] oh that's I that just blessed my heart
[56:19] when I seen that and you see how they
[56:22] come into the ark you know the prophet
[56:24] said that in the ark everything in the
[56:26] Bible shows a trinity but in proper
[56:28] placing
[56:29] amen said the ark had a trinity they had
[56:33] three floors
[56:35] he said the baked beasts and the Chrome
[56:36] beasts were on the bottom floor
[56:39] the birds and the fowls were in the
[56:41] middle floor
[56:42] and he said Noah and his family were in
[56:43] the top floor
[56:45] Amen in different offices
[56:48] like your dad is still yet like your
[56:50] dad's a son and a father and he'll soon
[56:53] be a grandfather
[56:54] but it's exactly the same Jared
[56:57] man exactly the being
[57:00] oh it's beautiful
[57:02] not like the world teaches that in three
[57:04] people sitting on a throne that always
[57:07] agree on the oh that's ridiculous nobody
[57:09] ever always agrees on the same thing
[57:12] amen can you imagine three people
[57:14] sitting on the throne in heaven and they
[57:16] had to throw a quarter to decide which
[57:18] one was going to come and die
[57:20] that's that's you know the prophet said
[57:23] that even the the the the the truth is
[57:26] easier to believe
[57:28] that I lie
[57:29] and the world's accepted a lie
[57:32] Matt
[57:35] you say where the Prophet say the
[57:37] prophet said I can believe the Virgin
[57:38] birth of Jesus and marry easier than
[57:41] natural birth
[57:43] he said that's easier for me to believe
[57:46] that how God can bring two people
[57:48] together
[57:51] when God can just speak it
[57:54] oh it's beautiful oh it's beautiful he
[57:58] likes Sun
[58:00] no no no merit of Our Own
[58:05] you didn't choose to serve God you
[58:07] didn't choose to decide to serve God
[58:10] but it was God who chose Mercy
[58:14] for you oh I thank you Lord Jesus
[58:18] Hallelujah he said therefore Jeff you
[58:21] just dropped down there in verse 18 He
[58:23] said therefore hath he had mercy on whom
[58:25] he will have mercy and whom he will
[58:29] he will heartedness
[58:32] amen you know you can understand
[58:34] election by by your fruits you shall
[58:38] know them
[58:41] God help us
[58:44] and here here right now in our day the
[58:48] last Christ maybe you know we don't of
[58:50] course we don't know the exact day but
[58:52] we're definitely in the season and the
[58:54] last Christ going out to the world to
[58:56] say get in the ark get in the ark
[59:00] and at the same time the Bible
[59:03] prophesies a great Falling Away
[59:06] oh how can it be
[59:08] prophesied that's how it can be how
[59:12] could the people see the animals just
[59:14] come out randomly from the field and
[59:16] start lighting up supernaturally just
[59:18] dovetail you know and just however they
[59:21] went in the ark and the birds flying
[59:22] over top and the people stood there and
[59:24] looked at them
[59:28] I don't think I'll go today
[59:37] exactly the prophets the exact same
[59:40] thing is happening right before your
[59:43] eyes
[59:44] and my eyes today
[59:50] if you talk to somebody outside
[59:52] which we all rub shoulders with
[59:54] different people that other ones will
[59:56] never meet
[59:57] and you could talk about the signs of
[59:59] the time and the
[1:00:02] well
[1:00:04] maybe we'll get a new government
[1:00:10] well we've had thousands of new
[1:00:13] governments
[1:00:16] see it's prophesied
[1:00:19] prophesy
[1:00:21] it's election
[1:00:23] it's God's plan
[1:00:25] and God knew it from the beginning
[1:00:28] and he's not surprised
[1:00:30] Hallelujah let's just read the story in
[1:00:33] Genesis 7. maybe we can and just I mean
[1:00:36] I know we've already mentioned it but
[1:00:37] Genesis 7 9 and then I'm going to drop
[1:00:39] to 13. and he said there went into and
[1:00:43] two unto Noah into the ark and male a
[1:00:45] female as God had commanded Noah now God
[1:00:49] just didn't I mean yes he commanded Noah
[1:00:52] but God was the one
[1:00:54] no I didn't go out with the last two and
[1:00:56] bring those animals in he had he had
[1:00:59] he had as much to do with that as you
[1:01:02] have to do with getting saved this
[1:01:03] morning
[1:01:04] nothing
[1:01:09] it was election
[1:01:13] and 13 and in the same self day
[1:01:16] enter Noah and chairman ham and his sons
[1:01:19] into the ark and his their wives
[1:01:22] and 14 and every Beast after his kind in
[1:01:24] the count after the kind and every
[1:01:26] creepy thing after the kind unto the
[1:01:28] Earth after it's kind and every fowl
[1:01:30] and every bird after his kind fifteen
[1:01:33] and they went into the no end to the ark
[1:01:36] two and two of All Flesh wherein as
[1:01:40] his breath of life
[1:01:43] and they went in
[1:01:45] all the flesh says God had commanded him
[1:01:49] and God
[1:01:52] and God shut the door
[1:01:54] here our Prophet said you know in the
[1:01:56] message he said when Noah went in
[1:01:59] he said Noah turn this this is what our
[1:02:02] Prophet said he said Noah would have
[1:02:04] turned around to those exact same people
[1:02:06] just try to try to go there with me in a
[1:02:09] picture in your mind kids you try to
[1:02:11] Picture This the animals supernaturally
[1:02:12] walking in the ark

[1:02:16] massive

[1:02:33] By Word of Mouth
[1:02:35] by merchants
[1:02:36] by travel
[1:02:38] everybody had heard about Noah's message
[1:02:41] you know why
[1:02:43] you know why it had to be that way
[1:02:46] because God had to have all hear it for
[1:02:49] them to be able to be rejected
[1:02:52] it had to be same as in our day there's
[1:02:54] nobody getting to the judgment and say
[1:02:56] well I never heard the truth that ain't
[1:02:58] going to happen
[1:02:59] because our God's a just God
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:03] and here they see that just picture that
[1:03:05] man you just picture all those what they
[1:03:08] seen the animals going in and then Noah
[1:03:10] turns around the door
[1:03:12] because what a prophet said no turn
[1:03:13] around the door and he said no
[1:03:15] folks
[1:03:17] this is Alaska
[1:03:22] see our God is Rich very rich
[1:03:27] very very very rich
[1:03:31] very very rich in Mercy
[1:03:34] he's not like brother Dale
[1:03:36] he'd be like Peter he said Lord how many
[1:03:39] times am I going to forgive my brother
[1:03:41] oh just a couple that's burning me up
[1:03:44] God
[1:03:46] says forever 70 times 7 meaning forever
[1:03:52] can you imagine the mercy of almighty
[1:03:55] God
[1:03:56] when he allowed Noah to turn around at
[1:03:58] the door
[1:04:00] say no this is your last call
[1:04:03] the very last time
[1:04:09] can you imagine the power
[1:04:11] and the anointing on that altar call
[1:04:20] and then he turned around
[1:04:23] and God shut the door
[1:04:26] and our Prophet said this he said
[1:04:30] he said this it never rained I believe
[1:04:32] it was for seven days
[1:04:37] now follow me with this church
[1:04:39] the people that had rejected the altar
[1:04:42] call
[1:04:45] for seven days believed they were right
[1:04:53] 24 they came the next day said yep I
[1:04:56] knew that man was cuckoo
[1:05:00] became the next Church age and they said
[1:05:02] 732 I knew that message was cuckoo
[1:05:06] they came the next church I knew that
[1:05:08] Prophet was
[1:05:10] cuckoo
[1:05:13] when they came on the seventh
[1:05:17] and they came on the seventh
[1:05:21] they did not know he was Cooper
[1:05:25] and our Prophet said this he said when
[1:05:28] it started to rain
[1:05:31] and
[1:05:32] they were Beyond safety
[1:05:34] he said this he said God never give them
[1:05:38] another way of Escape
[1:05:42] he never give them a log or a smaller
[1:05:45] boat he never give them a sailboat you
[1:05:48] never give them a speedboat he never
[1:05:51] give them a denominational Creed
[1:05:53] you give them one way one place of
[1:05:56] worship
[1:05:58] and that day was the ark in our day it's
[1:06:02] a lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:05] and that one way of Escape you're not
[1:06:08] going to get there and say well my
[1:06:09] preacher said
[1:06:16] huh
[1:06:20] and he said this he said
[1:06:22] and this will be also true
[1:06:24] for us
[1:06:26] he said so when that Ark
[1:06:29] lifted
[1:06:33] and the people
[1:06:35] had changed their mind
[1:06:37] and they were
[1:06:41] knocking on the door that's
[1:06:44] he said God Noah
[1:06:48] could not open
[1:06:50] what God
[1:06:52] headshot
[1:06:57] wow
[1:07:00] Noah could not
[1:07:03] imagine the feeling
[1:07:05] because see we're at we have the
[1:07:08] character of Christ
[1:07:10] so you look at somebody
[1:07:16] and you feel what Christ felt
[1:07:18] he would that all would be saved but he
[1:07:21] knew that couldn't be he knew there
[1:07:22] wouldn't be
[1:07:25] and I
[1:07:27] God
[1:07:29] have mercy on them
[1:07:31] but think of how blessed you are
[1:07:35] so election if you feel
[1:07:39] the Pope
[1:07:40] if you have a battle in your mind
[1:07:45] we've all had them and we don't I I
[1:07:48] don't I haven't talked to one person
[1:07:49] that had a battle that liked it
[1:07:52] but when your battle starts you should
[1:07:54] just start praising God and like losing
[1:07:57] Paul did it Paul did it in jail
[1:08:01] in the stocks
[1:08:06] I don't think he felt like it I just
[1:08:09] strongly I just have a strong feeling
[1:08:11] that impulsive less after he had been
[1:08:14] whipped and unjustly arrested because
[1:08:17] see he was one of them from their
[1:08:19] country
[1:08:20] he had been put in jail without a trial
[1:08:23] I have a feeling that his flesh
[1:08:26] didn't desire but he reached real deep
[1:08:31] past the flesh
[1:08:33] to his theophany to
[1:08:35] to his predestination to his election
[1:08:39] and it changed everything
[1:08:42] oh my
[1:08:44] my when we're going through our trials
[1:08:47] we could just see
[1:08:49] how much God loves you
[1:08:52] and he could never lose you
[1:08:54] oh it's it's it's amazing
[1:08:58] it's amazing Mercy election
[1:09:01] to be elected
[1:09:03] wow
[1:09:05] I know there'll be ones that are elected
[1:09:09] and there still may be going the wrong
[1:09:11] way
[1:09:12] but you can watch their life and it'll
[1:09:15] be bumpy
[1:09:16] God's putting up a roadblock and they'll
[1:09:18] bump it you know but
[1:09:22] God God won't lose those that are his
[1:09:25] it won't happen
[1:09:27] hallelujah it's so amazing
[1:09:31] just another quote here
[1:09:34] he said
[1:09:35] and provided away he said
[1:09:38] but God's provided away today of Escape
[1:09:41] we already said that was Jesus Christ
[1:09:43] and the spirit of God is moving in US
[1:09:47] and it it'll be moving in the bride
[1:09:50] because watch let me ask you a question
[1:09:53] the prophet said the Rapture is in
[1:09:56] process
[1:09:58] just let that sink in
[1:10:00] you're already in person
[1:10:03] wow
[1:10:05] how could it not just
[1:10:09] I told my wife I said the age we're
[1:10:12] living in I said
[1:10:14] it's so
[1:10:16] we can see everything coming and it's
[1:10:18] just so hard to function here
[1:10:21] I can't plan more than three days out
[1:10:26] you know a farmer I'm thinking years
[1:10:28] ahead
[1:10:30] years
[1:10:32] I know for a fact
[1:10:34] I don't believe in my heart that I'll be
[1:10:36] here years though
[1:10:39] how would you
[1:10:40] you know the Bible says
[1:10:42] election to put your kingdom
[1:10:46] where thieves don't come in and steal
[1:10:48] rust don't come in amen and you're you
[1:10:52] know you're saying well I'm provided for
[1:10:54] my family
[1:10:57] it was like the prophet he looked out
[1:10:59] and said I can't see past
[1:11:02] and I look out
[1:11:04] and I said well I can't see past
[1:11:07] I want to make something but I can't see
[1:11:09] past there
[1:11:13] our Prophet says here he said that's the
[1:11:15] spirit of God moving you
[1:11:17] to be in the ark
[1:11:19] and that's our art is a rapture
[1:11:22] that's how we're
[1:11:24] bypassing the tripods
[1:11:26] oh
[1:11:29] praise God
[1:11:31] amen
[1:11:33] God's not leaving his bride here to be
[1:11:35] tortured oh it's beautiful here he talks
[1:11:38] about the animals come together
[1:11:42] wow
[1:11:44] he said I believe every man or woman
[1:11:46] that's ordained of God I'll hear the
[1:11:48] voice
[1:11:49] and they'll hear the tug
[1:11:51] on their heart
[1:11:54] and they'll shoved to get into the ark
[1:11:56] as fast as they can go get into safety
[1:11:59] God's provided way of Escape
[1:12:02] for us is bright and that's it he said
[1:12:05] it's God's warning to his people
[1:12:08] prepare for me God you know you know the
[1:12:11] prophet said different
[1:12:13] you know really amazing things that I
[1:12:16] just love he said you know God's done
[1:12:18] everything he can do
[1:12:20] he said if you have the baptism of the
[1:12:22] Holy Ghost
[1:12:24] you have everything you need for the
[1:12:25] rapture
[1:12:27] if you've been born again you have
[1:12:28] everything for the rapture
[1:12:31] man you don't need to see you've already
[1:12:33] sold out to God you're already
[1:12:35] spiritually pregnant you don't need to
[1:12:38] see a mountain move to say oh no that's
[1:12:40] my God you already know it's your God
[1:12:43] hey man but here in this quote he says
[1:12:46] it's so beautiful he said you know when
[1:12:48] you're going to a wedding
[1:12:50] this is beautiful now now watch this if
[1:12:52] you're going to a wedding especially if
[1:12:53] you're in the wedding you're already the
[1:12:55] bride your groom now you're already you
[1:12:57] already got the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:58] Ghost

[1:13:15] going in the Rapture he said you got the
[1:13:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost you already
[1:13:20] are elected you already have the new
[1:13:23] birth but you come we're coming together
[1:13:25] to prepare

[1:13:29] it's called the reception of the wedding
[1:13:32] and I'll be there
[1:13:33] and I believe we'll be there
[1:13:37] but we're preparing
[1:13:40] can you imagine
[1:13:42] for the wedding supper of the Lamb you
[1:13:44] know I seen a picture you know which was
[1:13:46] just nothing you know
[1:13:48] it was just nothing to imagine you know
[1:13:51] like wearing flush bodies and we try to
[1:13:52] comprehend what that'll be like
[1:13:54] and you know when the queen died I seen
[1:13:56] a picture of the table and the whatever
[1:13:59] it was the powers I showed my wife
[1:14:01] I said don't you just times that by like
[1:14:03] 100 million
[1:14:05] that maybe it'll be close
[1:14:08] what the table be like
[1:14:12] and the wedding supper of the lab
[1:14:15] can you imagine you can't imagine the
[1:14:18] Bible says you can't comprehend
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:21] oh praise God
[1:14:24] thank you Lord Jesus amen it's so so
[1:14:27] amazing
[1:14:29] God Christ Jesus is our door you know I
[1:14:32] want to close with this
[1:14:34] regarding Mercy
[1:14:37] for once that haven't
[1:14:41] for once that haven't manifested that
[1:14:44] they're elected
[1:14:47] the ones that haven't manifested are
[1:14:49] elect they're still elect
[1:14:51] but they maybe haven't completely
[1:14:54] the the tug on their heart hasn't made
[1:14:57] them completely turn all the way around
[1:15:01] Mercy
[1:15:03] is always and always has been
[1:15:07] where God is
[1:15:09] it's where truth is
[1:15:11] it's where the message of the day is
[1:15:13] that's where the word of God is
[1:15:15] God's electus
[1:15:17] are all Mercy
[1:15:19] we're God's electives there's Mercy
[1:15:22] where God's word is there's Mercy where
[1:15:24] God's a message of the hour for the day
[1:15:26] is is Mercy it's truth it's a mercy to
[1:15:30] the people where God's truth is his
[1:15:33] Mercy
[1:15:34] and there's still Mercy on the scene
[1:15:37] when there's still truth in the bride
[1:15:39] elect and the message is still here
[1:15:43] for the turning
[1:15:45] of the pulling of the hearts
[1:15:47] amen
[1:15:49] and I believe right to the last of the
[1:15:51] door there'll be once God knows
[1:15:55] God knows and none that's in his hand
[1:15:59] really loose
[1:16:01] oh praise God

[1:16:13] things you know there's multiple
[1:16:15] multiple hundreds of scriptures talk
[1:16:18] about election predestination called
[1:16:21] hundreds of scriptures and as I studied

[1:16:59] and God before he ever shows judgment he
[1:17:03] will always you know the Old Testament
[1:17:04] is a shadow to the new and God was sat
[1:17:08] on it and shadowing and Shadow on the
[1:17:11] real
[1:17:12] and that's why all the unbelievers from
[1:17:15] the ages they'll never get and say well
