of God want to say God bless you and certainly an honor to be with you again and uh spent a couple years the last time I I don't remember what year was exactly I know it was covid times and and uh trying to get home a bunch of crazy Canadians on their tractors had the bridge blocked so I had to go down to uh cross over at Detroit and it sure was an adventure so uh this time it was a little smoother sailing and my it's just wonderful we can be more free to get together and fellowship amen appreciate brother Dale inviting us and and uh the just the fellowship with the langstaff family you amen we say God bless you bring you warm greetings from home from True Word Tabernacle Brother Ray Erikson uh just had his 85th birthday yesterday he's uh uh his Caleb birthday Four score and five and this year he's uh he's kind of retired or moved to like a senior pastor position brother Wayne Lawson we vote him in as the pastor for the future we're just thankful For What the Lord Has Done and what he has in store also greetings for from your friend brother Mike Allen amen your good buddy who comes up here quite often to minister amen uh we just bring love and greetings from the Saints I won't keep you too long standing let's just go right to the word of God Amen in uh 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and just trust in the Lord for his grace today 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we'll start at Verse 18 amen and we'll read down to the 25th verse the Bible says but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member then where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body now of course he's saying now being members of the body of Christ if we were all the same part in the body it wouldn't be much of a body right but he says so the eye can't say to the hand I have no need of thee uh nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you n he says much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble they are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable uh upon these we bestore more abundant honor my and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness so the way that God values things we find out right away is not the way that it's not according to our own evaluation amen uh so he says for our comely Parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part to that part which lacked that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another amen don't you love him don't you want love one another let's before we pray let's turn to Ephesians chapter 3 and just take my text today Ephesians chapter 3: 8 and 9 now Paul will will begin to speak of this great mystery amen which is hidden in the word of God to be revealed in the end time amen a great Revelation which will make the Bible a new book Paul says unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ Now That Word Fellowship is sometimes translated as economy it's an interchange it's a it's an it's it's an economy it's it's sort of a group thing and so uh and that's where we get that phrase that we've heard uh you know over the years people speak of God's economy in God's economy that's what I'd like to minister on today by the help of the Lord on God's economy shall we just have a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord I just thank you for the welcome spirit I feel in the house of God today Lord and I thank you for your Holy Spirit Lord that's come amongst us Lord and we just believe father upon you Lord that Lord You're the you're you're good father Lord and you're here to feed your children Lord and when we look at our own Humanity Lord it only gets in the way father we have no we lay no claim Lord to human ability father but Lord we want to master that thing as your Prophet instructed us Lord and and be fully surrendered Lord and fully dependent upon your leadership today Lord I pray Lord that you would just anoint these lips Lord to speak the word father just the way that you ordained it Lord and anoint the ears of every hearer father to receive it may you be the speaker this morning Father may you also be The Interpreter of your word father for we are dependent on you Lord we're asking you to come minister to us father with the words of Life Lord and break the bread of life to us Lord that we could be strengthened and edified father and Lord may you address every need Lord that's gathered in this building and listening in father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're seated this morning go ahead and start my timer so I don't keep you long today amen so we're just preaching a little bit uh this morning on God's economy God's economy and Paul has said that uh that it it fell to him in his ministry as one of the as one of the messengers of the church and the one that would set the pattern for all of the messengers down through the seven Church ages that that uh that he would he would preach these UNC searchable Riches of Christ so that all men would be able to see The Fellowship of the mystery The Fellowship of the mystery now now that that word Fellowship there as I've said is sometimes in uh it's translated to mean an economy an economy and so so there's an economy of this mystery and uh and and so when we think about the revelation of the mystery we don't think of it as a singular thing we don't just think of it as something that happens in one man or one person or one Ministry or one church amen but it is there's an economy to this mystery in other words everybody is a participant that it's a it's group participation everybody has a part to play in the economy of God to to to reveal this mystery and I've been I've been ministering around different places a lot on God and morphe how many know brother brandom teaches that about God and morphe in this age now God it means that God in a mass God in a different form uh uh when the Bible says uh that Jesus Christ thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he was in the form of God Amen it was God in the form of a man right God and morphe changing his mask and so we find out everything that the that the message is teaching us and just to just to not to go too deep into these things but but just to lay a little Foundation this morning we find that we're living in a very crucial hour there's a there the you may not think so but and it may not appear from the outside but it's a very very important time for the people of God Amen because God has has changed his mask once again Amen in this great drama that's been playing out ever since God said let there be light he set the stage and he has changed his mask from Prophet unto prophet and from messenger unto messenger he has changed his mask and played different parts uh all in a progressive revelation of himself there's a there's a mystery that's in God there are things about God that are mysterious one day but then after he manifested they become revealed one day it was a mystery amen that God was a A Healer nobody knew that God had had the power and the and the will to heal human beings until he came and he manifested that he was a Healer amen and then they found out that god Jehovah was not just a God but he's a god healer he's Jehovah Rafa amen amen there was a time when we did not know that God was a provider amen but but uh uh we knew that he was Jehovah but we didn't know that he was a provider until it came time that Abraham needed a ram amen he needed a a sacrifice there was something that was required that that man did not have the ability to produce and so God comes down and he provides Abraham a ram and we find out he's not just Jehovah he's Jehovah Gyra he's my provider and so see God is in the business of revealing himself God is in the business of taking things that are a mystery within himself and then and what he wants to do is not have it remain a mystery but he wants to manifest it so that people on the Earth could receive the revelation of it and they could understand him in a way that they didn't understand him yesterday amen amen and see that's happening right now today God has sent a prophet Amen to reveal amen The Mystery of the word in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery God is supposed to be finished it's so it's supposed to be fully revealed until the Bible would become a new book to us and and the things that were hidden down through ages all the Loose Ends would be tied up and we would have a perfect revelation of the word is that right amen and how many believe that we've had a prophet that that that revealed the mystery of God amen but see but see God Amen has not stopped revealing things since 1965 God has not stopped his self-revelation he's never ceased to reveal himself amen but we find out that that there was more mystery in the in the heart of God than Doctrine amen there was more of there was more to the mystery than the right kind of water baptism amen amen we're building towards something now there was more in the mystery of God's mind amen than than the right uh revelation of the godhead there was more in the mystery of God's mind amen than than uh than you know serpent seed and these things amen but there were there were people whose names amen were recorded in his mind before the foundation of the world and that's you my brother that's you my sister you were in him the Bible says chosen in him before the foundation of the world Amen but see back then you were a mystery amen but now God has changed his mask amen and he has mased himself not just in church Messengers not just in the ministry of a prophet not just in the five-fold ministry but he has masked his spirit in the bride body of Jesus Christ and you in your own life amen are revealing something amen that was hidden in God before the foundation of the world you might think that your Christian walk doesn't matter you might think that it's insignificant the world might not see it your church your fellow church members may not acknowledge it amen but what is happening spiritually in you as a son or daughter of God is the Revelation amen of a of a thought amen it's a it's the speaking of something that God thought before the foundation of the world Amen there is nobody in God in the body of Christ there's nobody in the bride of Christ whose life doesn't matter or whose work doesn't matter or whose Ministry doesn't matter why because it's God's economy Amen to reveal the mystery that was in him before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen you are a ask for the word of God in this hour this message wasn't just meant to be talked about it wasn't just a church that we would join it wasn't just a lifestyle to raise our children under amen but it was a revelation it was a quickening of a sea that was on the inside of you amen that the word that this message amen would not only exist in the ministry of a prophet but it would be masked Amen in the life and in the body and in the vessels of human beings amen before the amen just before the the coming of the Lord You're a mask for this word and you're giving life to a mysterious purpose that he had in his mind be way back before the foundation of the world brother Bram said you being a part of God's Gene how many believe you're a gene seed then he said you're a part of the word and other men are a part of the word God's word and seated together it manifests the entire body of Christ you say brother Nathan I'm looking for the coming of the Lord and I'm looking for a 7 foot Jesus in the sky with a Robee and sandals brother sister don't miss don't miss now we don't do away with the of course the physical coming of the Lord and the Rapture amen but there but there's an appearing before the coming amen amen there's prophesied that God and his bride would be so one until it would be Christ himself manifested in a bride body amen you're manifesting the entire body of Christ so it makes you as an individual very very special very very important the part that you play is very very crucial because the Mi the mystery is an economy I hope it's clear where I'm where I'm going with this today it's an economy amen and you know the thing about a an economy is participation is not an option participation is not an option let's just think naturally speaking now we all know what it is to live in a in in a in a modern day economy right and and and and you find out that this economy that we live in of worldly finances and production and goods and and trade and all those things it takes everybody or it doesn't work everybody's required or it doesn't work you see somebody has got to you know design the airplane and somebody's got to design the car and somebody's got to put gas in it and somebody's got to turn the nuts to put it together and somebody's got to somebody's got to you know uh somebody's got to clean it and somebody you somebody's got to you you you say well you know what I'm going to do brother Nathan I'm going to go off grid and I'm going to be a homesteader and I'm going to get I'm going to get off grid I'm going to get out of this economy I'm going to I'm not going to be dependent on anything and you know like brother Jared you got a nice Farm going there you got your own animals that you can eat and you're planting your own crops that you can eat and you could feed your animals and everything but but you got to have some electricity you got to have it you got to you know you you got to have a vehicle amen and that vehicle you couldn't you know you couldn't go in your Backwoods and build a vehicle even if the iron was laying there it's got to be fined and it's got to be smelted and it's got to be formed and it's got to be for so everybody's got to participate to make the economy work is that right you can't just not be a part of it you've got to be you'll starve to death you've got to work and you've got to play your part amen so to be part of the economy so that you can eat so that you can enjoy good things and all those kind of things and that's the way it is naturally but spiritually brother sister it's the same way amen if God Amen had in his mind that there would be an economy of the revealing of the mystery in the end time amen then it wouldn't be for you and I to just sit on our hands and let the preacher do all the preaching and let the singer do all the singing amen and and let the let somebody else say amen and just live a comfortable Christian churchgoing Life brother sister participation is not an option amen but it is required that we would all catch the revelation of this mystery and realize that you and I each have a very vital part to play in the revelation of the very heart of God in this hour Hallelujah say brother Nathan but I'm not you know I'm not I'm not important I don't have an office in the church and I don't have a great gift but I'll tell you what you are brother brah said you were a son or daughter of God before there was a moon before there were stars before there was a molecule you say oh I'm not important how could you be unimportant when you're Sons and Daughters of God for you're only the physical manifestation of the attributes that were in God at the beginning brother Bram said there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before I just love that that was you before the only form of eternal life in the image of God you are made and you are manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God and as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth he said your spiritual Gene had to be in God Amen because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world and I like what he says now no way around it No Way Around It Hallelujah if you were in his mind and you're a genan seed of the father you've got to be expressed you've got to reach your potential you've got to come to life in this age and do what you were called to do and fulfill the purpose that you were created for amen there's no way around it brother sister the economy participation is not an option amen it's the economy of God if you are in the mind of God you've got to be part of the unveiling cuz if he thought you back there if he doesn't speak you now and you don't and you don't exist now and you don't manifest yourself now then the mystery is not revealed amen it's not revealed without a brother Jared it's not revealed without a brother Julie a sister Julie amen it's a it's not fully revealed until every one of us amen has has manifested what was in God's thinking before the foundation of the world Amen because the seventh Angel's message was to reveal the entire Min mystery as I said not just mysteries of Doctrine not just mysteries of belief amen or or Bible teaching not just mysteries of prophets and pastors and preachers amen but to everyone that sits in a Pew Amen to everybody that feeds on the message of the hour to everyone who's a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ this mystery is unto you and you're a part of the mystery amen and if God s you before the foundation of the world then when he speaks you now you're nothing less than the spoken word of God manifested that's where we're living right now we're living in the big reveal brother Bram said this is the time when he takes the mask off the whole thing Hallelujah he's unmasked himself where in The Bride of Jesus Christ and so it's manifesting time every single attribute has got to be revealed whatever seed is in you it's got to bear fruit it's got to bear fruit watch this this now in the first deal brother Braham talks about the lamb you know after Jesus died how many know he went to the throne and he and he's began a work of intercession and in in a time of intercessory there brother Bram said he knew there were names there that were put there from the foundation of the world a question I've asked myself many times I say you know if Jesus came 2,000 years ago and died to forgive our sins to pay the price to cover all all sins For All Mankind that whosoever whoever will could believe un salvation on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago he did that doesn't it make you wonder what we're still doing here sometimes don't shouldn't it make shouldn't it make the Believers shouldn't it make religious people shouldn't make you know Christian Christianity Marvel to say then why are we still here 2,000 years later why are we still here and why are we still going on and why do we still come to church and why do we read our B and why do we do all this thing why didn't Jesus take us all back home 2,000 years ago amen why why why why is he laid there before the throne doing a work of inter why so long what's going on what's been happening all this time watch this now but brother Bram said he knew that there were names amen that were put on his book before the foundation of the world and as long as those names had never been manifested on Earth as yet he had to stay there as an intercessor as long as there was one name that had not been declared in Earth Christ had to stay as an intercessor to take care of that name oh brother sister amen God thought you he knew your name before the foundation of the world Amen he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life amen and as long as that name has not been manifested yet amen then all of the Judgment of God is held back the Rapture can't come brother sister nothing can happen until every member of this bride is manifested in this day until each of us are quickened to that seed comes to life and bears fruit and we reach the potential God called us to walk in then brother sister you see how vital you are to the economy of God this thing doesn't run without you this thing doesn't run it doesn't it doesn't function it won't reach the goal you see without a bride brother Braham said when the bride recognizes her position when she recognizes who she is that's the when the Rapture will go he didn't say it would come he said but when you recognize who you are it'll go amen and brother sister you see you see how crucial it is then that we understand who we are and that we understand how how important amen uh our part in this economy is because without a bride manifestation there is no Rapture without a bride manifestation there is no Millennial Reign without a bride manifestation there's no thousand years of Peace amen there's no there's no Gog and Magog there's no new heavens and no new Earth without you brother sister the Bride of Jesus Christ revealing man esting the mystery that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world how could we feel insignificant today amen when God has called us he has called us he has elected us he has predestinated us to be the final voice to the final age living out the final Revelation amen revealing the final mystery and he said so he stays there as an intercessor to take care of that name Hallelujah so many times I feel like maybe maybe if it was up to me I couldn't make it just like you feel many times you say oh brother Nathan I just I don't feel like I could make it I don't feel like I have the strength I doubt myself I doubt my position I doubt all all we have many doubts about ourselves amen but we know this that he's going to take care of that name he'll do the taking care he'll do the holding on he'll do the leading amen he'll do the guiding he'll do the delivering amen he'll he'll bring the power you just bring the name amen you just bring yourself and and lay under this message and let it reveal to you who you are and what you are put on this Earth to be and what you are put on this Earth to do and realize that your part in this amen is just as important as any Prophet uh amen or any Ministry or anybody in the economy of God and you say well but I'm feeble amen I I I'm less comely but that but in God's economy you're more Val valuable you are more you're given more honor Amen to live that simple Christian life amen and fulfill what you were called to fulfill the Bride of Jesus Christ is this okay today amen hallelujah no way around it so you can't be halfway in this message and halfway out you can't just be riding the fence you've got to manifest what you are this is not the message is not a church that you join the message is not a lifestyle it's not a Creed it's not a SL better church with slightly better Doctrine right uh to be a message believer doesn't mean that that you're like a Baptist but you're a little bit Freer in the spirit it doesn't mean that you're a Pentecostal but you got a little bit better Church order that's not what it means brother sister but it means that amen God before the foundation of the world had a person in his mind amen he they had a certain color hair they had a certain stature oh I'm getting ahead of myself amen he designed them a very specific way amen so so that oh and he thought about it amen but today he's not thinking about it he has spoken it Hallelujah and our existence on this Earth is the Revelation and the manifestation of the mystery of his thinking before the beginning of the world hallelujah amen oh and he's taking care of your name Hallelujah see a word is a thought expressed and we talk a lot about around the message about well we have the word the word the word you know we got the word brother Nathan we don't need a you know we don't need any of that spiritual stuff we don't need the Holy Ghost and we don't need the moving of the spirit all that now we have the word brother sister amen you got to realize you are the word you are the word amen and you've been expressed Amen to manifest something to be something you say we got the word I say Mark 16 is in the word acts 238 is in the word amen these signs shall follow them that believe the word word amen the spirit leads them that are in the word hallelujah we've got the word and it means something brother sister it means that you are the word hallelujah and that means all that the potential of the spoken word is in you brother Bram said it was enough power to create a world and go live on it amen we'll Circle back to that quote in a bit but see now notice brother Bram said the word had to be manifested and when the word is manifested that's what God sends a prophet for talks about Moses was called to his job and he said and nobody else could do it there's nobody can take your place with your peculiarity now how many have some peculiarities we're all A peculiar people right some of us more than others amen but watch brother brandom he says now how often you think well if there should be anybody secure in their position it ought to be the messenger but brother Bram said often I wondered he said I how I would like to take oral Robert's place he said I would like to take Billy Graham's place somebody like that you see brother brandom had other people that he would look at he'd say now if I was a little more like that then I'd be somebody now if I was a little bit more like brother Dale if I was a little more like sister Julie or this one or that one well then I'd really be somebody then I'd really you know uh uh uh uh see but but brother Bram says but I can't be Billy Graham but neither can Billy Graham be me I can't be Oral Roberts but Oral Roberts can't be me and brother Bram said you are each one set in God's economy just for its place oh my like a little sister came to brother brandom and she said brother brandom I fasted and prayed and fasted and prayed and I'm still never cast out a devil he said well sister yeah that's not how it works you're supposed to fast and pray so that I can cast out a devil brother B said one fasts all the time and communes with God and another one casts out Devils cuz this one is is fasting but it's the whole body of Christ working together that's the unity brother sister it's so beautiful that you are you and I are an authentic we are a one-of-a-kind uh creation of God's expression and God doesn't do anything halfway I don't care how you value it in God's economy amen it's valued it's important it's vital amen it's Irreplaceable your part in the economy of God no notice now brother talks about we'll just uh we'll just paraphrase these quotes how that your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he said and the color of hair that you have the color eyes that you have the stature that you're in now some of you would like to be two inches taller amen but see the stature that you're in God saw before the foundation of the world Amen and he seen you a human being like you are isn't that beautiful brother sister when God chose you he didn't just before the foundation of the world spin the wheel and let it click and it pulled up your number it wasn't a lottery of chance it was not a blind selection you have been designed brother sister you have been shaped you have been molded in the mind of God he knew what color hair he wanted you to have he knew what he wanted you to look like he knew how he wanted you made how you would stand how tall or short you would be Hallelujah he knew all of those things amen and and and he saw that image before the foundational world he said put that one on my book that one will fit perfectly in my economy that one will do the job just right hallelujah oh my amen he talked about the Bell maker is that right how the Bell maker he would mix brass and iron and and copper and all these things and mix these metals and every Bell gets a different mixture amen but he mixes it differently so it'll have just the right sound when he strikes it and makes just the right sound amen there are things that you've got more of than I do but then there's other things I've got more of a mixture than you do amen and it's all different ratios but it's built to be in harmony it's built to be a symphony amen and nobody's unimportant in the Symphony of God Amen because he's a master musician he's a master composer he knows how to make things beautiful if we would just play our part you know and when it comes to a great Symphony Orchestra you know somebody's got to be the lead violin and they play that solo and it just fills the house with music you know and everybody's crying and and it and and it's powerful and the spotlights on him and then there's one guy in the back who sits there for two hours never makes a sound until just the right time and he pulls out that triangle he goes Bing but see without that Ting amen then the symphon is not complete and the art form is not expressed and what was in the mind of the composer is not perfect perfect if somebody doesn't play the triangle Hallelujah and in the eyes of the composer amen it's just as beautiful as the lead violin it's just as valuable it's not perfect without it that's why brother Bram said if God would lose you he would no longer be God if he lost one of his thoughts he would not be perfect amen because the thoughts of an eternal God are Eternal and they are attributes of him how beautiful how beautiful amen see there's a lot of times we look in the mirror I I do anyway I look in the mirror and I see some stuff I don't want I see a lot of extra you know I see a lot of things I'd like to rearrange when I look in the mirror but see God is getting what he wanted now now what's more important to a believer that we would see what we want or that God would get what he wants amen that God would get what he wants wo oh my you know brother BR talked about your eyes your stature everything was in his thinking at the beginning and he said the only thing you are you are an expression you are a word after he thought it he said he spoke it and here you are and here you are oh my after he thought it can you imagine God before the foundation of the world describing to the angels what you would look like oh and what you would do and the church that you would go to and the situations in your life and the things that you would overcome and telling them all the story and just going down chapter after chapter of your life saying Gabriel he's going to go through you know there's going to be a time he's going to go through a hardship he's going to hit a real struggle and and the road's going to get bumpy he's going to wonder he's going to wonder a little bit whether I whether whether I've forsaken him but I'll never forsake Him Gabriel because he somewhere I'm trying to there's something I'm trying to mold into him to bring him to a certain place to do something nobody else can do I want to put him in the right time in the right place to play my part and Gabriel says oh my what a wonderful thought Lord amen that you'd have somebody at the right time at the right place to say the right word and be there when it's really needed you'd have brother Dale there when somebody really needed him amen he might have laid oh my just going with inspiration now he might have laid dormant for many years amen just just just belonging to a church and living a good Christian life but there was a time appointed amen when he would be at the right time at the right place to take the pulpit amen and be a light Amen in the in the in a little town called Wyoming see God's thinking is perfect and I can see him describing it to the angels and all the angels will say oh my what a thought the brother Dale how beautiful what a wonderful thought he says but you think that's wonderful wait till I speak it just wait till I speak it wait till the year 2023 when that which was a thought has become expressed and it all unfolds just the way I had it in my mind what a beautiful reality brother sister that's where I want to be I just want God's Sovereign will to be done in my life so that my life would have eternal value meaning purpose oh my see brother Bram said God is Sovereign in his choosing God is Sovereign who was back there he said to tell him a better way to run the world who would dare to tell him that he was running his business wrong now some of us would have tried you you know that's true some of us would have tried cuz we do that every day God why' you make me this way God why do I have to deal with that God why am I create why why do I look like this why do I sound like that why don't why am I not more like this one my why am I not more like that one God why' you make me like this oh my see we're arguing with the sovereignty of God Amen why is it that we put what we think over what God thought if God in his eternal mind thought of you and I before the foundation of the world shouldn't that mean something to us shouldn't it have a value if you're is thought brother sister you are Eternal you are special and you are powerful brother Bram now we come to it brother Braham said the power that's in you now what power is that it's the spoken word the voice that said let there be light is the voice speaking in your life amen by the manifestation of the spirit that's in you the power in you and that power in you brother Bram said could make a new world could make a new world you say well brother Nathan how come it don't happen because we don't need a new world Amen but he thought us and spoke us to live in this one Amen to be part of the economy of the mystery but see it's enough power could make even a new world if it was needed see God doesn't have little weak spots now here we have to retrain our thinking God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots that's powerful now of course brother brandom that's a big heavy spot right that's a big heavy powerful spot in the mind of God and Me me and you we're just little weak spots uh-huh well you know the pastor or the Deacon or this one or that one they're the big heavy they they they're the powerful one I'm just a little weak spot brother BR said God doesn't have a little weak spots he said the least little touch of God you know the quote is omnipotent is omnipotent that means all powerful that means all powerful all the way powerful you say well brother Nathan if I'm part of that light if I'm part of that word if I'm part of that Eternal logos in the beginning then I'm the littlest bitti little spark that spun off of the logos I'm the littlest if I'm in the body of Christ I'm the I'm just the skin on the bottom of the little toe I mean I'm the most insignificant one in the body well that just puts you right down where the action is you're the closest one to the neck of the enemy brother and sister if you're the little toe in the body of Christ every devil of hell is under your feet every Power of the enemy is Beneath You amen if just just be in him amen doesn't matter if you think it's an important spot or not amen it's part of the body of Christ and so it amounts to Perfection it amounts to completion it adds up to Value brother sister no matter how you think about it oh my the least little touch of God is omnipotent brother Bram said he's seen something in me and he's seen something in you he said he had a reason to save you he said look at the people that's unsaved today look at the Millions he could have took beside you I read a quote like that this morning and it just stopped me in my tracks brother BR said when he saved me a million were lost but he saved me oh my look at the millions he said he could have took beside you but he took you no one can take your place you're in God's economy no one else can do it that's his love to you see we got to learn to think in terms of of God's economy I might slow down for a minute and just teach on this a little bit and just these are just some of some of my thoughts you just take it for what it's worth but I studied just a little bit of Economics you know in school and things and uh and and and and and the thing about our economy our society this world that we live in the way that it's built the way that it's all arranged it it's all built on the idea of relative value that one object is more valuable than another and maybe one person is more valuable than another and one gift is more valuable than another and one position is more valuable than another and everything is relative and everything has a value and it's all compared and it's all traded you see and it you know it all has to do with money and all those things I was I was reading one time I thought it was quite amazing you know if you go to school and you take an economics class the first thing that they teach you they teach you about barter is that right and they talk about barter about well you know now we have money and money represents value but there was a time they say when they didn't have any money and they didn't have the idea of money and so they just had a barter economy and that meant well you know uh I I really need some milk so I'll trade my 10 chickens for your cow and then you know we'll work something out we'll just barter and we'll trade kind for kind and like that and then and then they say that went on and eventually somebody came up with the idea of money and money replaced all that and gave everything a value well you know it's quite interesting and like I say you could take this for what it's worth but in all of history and all of anthropology and AR and archaeology and all the studies of men they don't know of a single society that ever existed as far back as they can go without money there's no Society or civilization that they know of that didn't have the concept of value and relative value and one thing being measured against another you know what that tells me brother sister is just that is just this that the idea of value is something that's so so deep in the human heart it's B it's it's it's it's buried it's it's formed so deep in a human being it goes all the way back to the beginning goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden when man had value and it was value was lost and man had something of great worth but it was lost friends and there's something whether he's religious or not there's something in the heart of every human being amen way down deep they know that they are need to be redeemed they know that they are lacking in value amen they know that they're lacking in worth and brother sister from the time that we're born we're aware of this and we're taught this and the world teaches it to us from the beginning you know how it is every day of your life you will be compared to somebody when our children in in school you know they they might be a good student they might have friends but somebody's going to be more popular somebody's going to be more talented somebody's going to be more this or more that or or or smarter or whatever you know wherever you get into your life you're going to be compared quite it's quite it's quite harsh you know it's quite a hard thing to think that you and I could never be enough in our own Humanity to be something that's valuable when we're always compared to somebody else you know how it is you might decide I'm going to learn to be a great piano player and I'm going to practice the piano every day for the next 30 years and I'm going to I'm going to reach my full potential to be the greatest piano player I could be and some six-year-old kid from CH on YouTube is going to blow you out of the water cuz that's the world that we live in somebody's always going to be smarter somebody's always going to be better looking somebody's always going to be richer somebody's going to have a nicer house somebody's going to be more famous somebody's going to be more amen and so in the economy of this world you're always compared and you always come up lacking but God's economy does not look at relative value God's economy only looks at Eternal value and brother and sister we got to Humble ourselves to that we have to throw away our way of thinking cuz this human mind can only think in terms of the worldly economy amen but in God's economy oh Hallelujah you're not measured by what people think of you but you're only measured by your connection to eternal life and so your value is eternal value it's deity value it's God value because you're a part of him and a part of his word you know that today we have inflation we have all kinds of quirks and things in our economy we have inflation you know when uh uh sometimes the market just goes haywire and you got to go down to go down to the store and you got to pay you know $12 for a dozen eggs well the eggs aren't worth $12 but because of inflation because of relative value because of this worldly economy that's what you got to pay the price does isn't the value but you got to pay the price but in God's economy there's no Market manipulation there's no inflation in God's economy the value is the price if a price has been paid then that's the value and if God would shed his blood amen if God would give his very life which is eternal Amen to redeem you and to call you out of the Dust of this Earth and to fill you with purpose and meaning and and and and be the expression of his desire amen then that is your value you that is your worth it's not inflated amen God didn't get ripped off amen when he when he purchased you but he knew what he was getting and he willingly shed his blood and paid the price of his only begotten son that's what you're worth that's what all of us are worth in God's economy oh if we could just be Washed by the Water of the word and have all the stinking ideas of this worldly economy and our human way of thinking and our human evaluation washed from our mind that we could see the worth the value the value oh oh how dare we speak against the blood how dare we devalue what God has valued how dare we talk bad about one another how dare we talk bad about ourselves when God has given his evaluation you're worth what he said you were worth you think he shed his blood because of obligation to you because he had to because he was trapped into it God shed his blood for you because of desire you see you see what I'm talking about value now there's churches there's preachers all over this world probably on this Sunday morning preaching to their Church on similar lines of this but see this is not some water down uh a seminary some kind of a Veggie Tales Theology of just you know God made you special and he loves you very much you see I'm not preaching this to you now you're valuable to me as brothers and sisters of the Lord but but see it's not my evaluation that we're that we're dealing with now you're sure you're valuable to me but see but but but but it's not that I assign you value because we're friends and because we both belong to message churches and because brother Dale invited me to pre and just because because in some human way of thinking I assign you value and I treat you like you're valuable whether you are or not that's not it in God's economy you are value you are value can you see the difference can you see the difference amen you are value you are worthy you are righteous you are redeemed you are bride you are royal you are seed you are genan you are him bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh that's what you are are Hallelujah you are value I might assign you all the value that I can and I certainly do but it's not my evaluation that will matter but what matters is his evaluation of you and I Hallelujah we've got to be retrained in our way of thinking brother Bram said sometimes great guys get together oh and you hear them say oh great so and so and great so and so you know this great brother and that great one he said don't ever do that there's no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God yes sir that's right he said we are brothers sisters he said I don't care if you're pastoring a church it's got five people in it that don't make you little it makes you a brother see God's evaluation what God is looking at God doesn't have little children and big children he just has children he said they're all the same and God himself came down from the ivory palaces of Glory to become one of us now who's the big one he didn't come down here to take the form of a priest he took the form of a servant amen being found in the fashion of a man he humbled himself he washed the very clay that he created the feet of his Apostles and others now who's great brother sister forget what you think and I think of who's important and who's a big great big so and so and and and and and and what matters in our human way of thinking there's only one rank in the economy of God that's footwash flun footwash flunky if you're a bishop if you're a pope if you're a whatever you are if you're the if you're the foremost evangelist on the field or whatever you are whatever you're doing for the kingdom of God do what you're supposed to do amen and it's just and it's the same he just has children now of course it doesn't mean we're all going to look the same it doesn't mean we're all going to have the same Min Ministry like brother jar and I were fellowshipping somebody's you know there somebody's going to be out preaching around the world and then somebody's going to be somebody's going to keep it stable at home and and somebody's not going to preach at all but they're just going to send a friendly text or check in on somebody or bring somebody a hot meal or whatever you're doing in your ministry brother sister amen it's not all going to look the same and some are going to look important and some are not amen even brother Brandon would use words like our great brother so and so and things like that amen see don't expect it to all look the same it's not that they're the same but they're value the same and anyone with the Holy Ghost and a genuine revelation will value you the same if you're in God's economy right if you're in God's economy Hallelujah my in God's economy we're all different but we're all valued the same now that's of course adoption that's the revelation of adoption brother Bram said your adoption would it be your maturity it'd be Reaching Your Potential it'd be fulfilling your calling your ministry your adoption is a positional placing so when you come in your position it doesn't really you know it'd be like if we're trying to build a church a big great big Stone Cathedral and then you just you you get your stone and that represents your life and you just shape that up just perfect you got it all every every corner is perfectly square and all the geometry is just right and your life is so perfect then throw that out in the field and say look at that church well it doesn't mean anything till you put your stone against my stone put another Stone on top of that then put the pasture up here and build it up until we all come together you can't all you can't all stack it up in the same position everybody's got a different place but when you put it together it's a great house of worship and the presence of the Lord can fill that vessel Hallelujah that's that's what our adoption means it doesn't mean and that's why nobody could preach adoption like brother brandom I'm telling you let if God had come down in the 1960s to any other charismatic leader to any of the great Oneness Pentecostals or any of those men and and and and those great generals and great men as we would call them imagine if God had come down to one of them and he said now I've chosen you brother so and so I I've chosen you great leader and you're going to be the one that's going to preach the message of adoption in this day and bring the bride to her maturity you're going to loose the Revelation you know what adoption would have been the manifestation of sons Power Authority your her name on the check being as good as his you know what they would have made it they would have turned it in it would have been a worldwide Ministry they'd have been on television everywhere they'd be emptying out hospitals and walking on the water and there'd be no place for you and I we wouldn't even be in the picture it'd be some great leader it'd be something but brother brandom a god-called prophet a man with a true Revelation preaches the message of adoption he said if you're a farmer he said if you're a factory worker he said if you're a housewife and at whatever you are you get in your position and that's your adoption oh my Hallelujah a prophet a man with a man who made an altar call amen and 30,000 people came to the Lord in one night but there was enough room in adoption for me there was enough room in adoption for you there is enough room in God's economy for all of us hallelujah hallelujah oh brother brandom talked about talked about David and how you wouldn't have you wouldn't have picked him out of the bunch he didn't look like the strong one or the great one he was a stripping boy he was the run to the litter well he said now you could say well brother brandom I wasn't called to be a preacher he said you might be called to be a housewife he said but you got your position in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost you're just as much David as the rest of them brother sister don't devalue what God has valued he said you're just as much David as the preacher as the prophet amen if you're a housewife and you're raising those children in the fear and admonition of the Lord and you're that Fifth Gospel I know people will make you feel unvalued but in God's economy Hallelujah you're dripping with the oil of anointing you're a ro as Royal as David was Royal you have your place in the adoption of the body in the manifestation of sons see every joint supplies nobody in this body is without P purpose like we said participation is not an option so if every joint is supposed to be a supplier then you can't just sit around and be a consumer come on somebody because that's the way a lot of us we you know we'll go to church on Sunday we'll sing a few songs and say amen and all those kind of things but see there's a difference in being a church member amen and being the church amen the called out the elect amen the the the to being a part of the body where you show up and you're not you don't show up saying boy I hope we got a good preacher today and man I hope the singing is in tune and man I hope they sing my favorite song and oh you know I Hope Church doesn't go too long and I I I I hope uh I hope that that the the sister brought the right thing in the crock pot you know that my favorite dish no and just consume and consume and consume who wants that kind of Life brother sister but I want to supply something I want to have a purpose I want to be a part of this thing now whether I'm going to stand in the Pulpit or whether I'm going to sweep the floor or whether I'm going to greet somebody at the door or whatever my place is brother sister I'm happy to do it amen just give me a part just let me be a part Hallelujah my this is going off but something I've shared before and maybe you didn't maybe just enjoy it but in my heart you know in my heart there we know that there's Great Men great Min we would call them great men and great Ministries around the message people that we look up to people that we enjoy you know we look at we look at the five-fold ministry we look at pastors we look at those things oh my it looks great to us and we appreciate that now some people get jealous you know and Petty about those things I don't I appreciate what God has given because because of this revelation of God's economy amen because of realizing I have a part in this thing nobody can take away from me and it's of no less value then that what that means to me if you say brother Nathan well you're not much of a Preacher that's all right or you know maybe your ministry is not going to go far that would be all right as long as it would go where God wanted it to go because see be this what I'm preaching you means so much to me that if you took away my Ministry and you said and and the Lord came and he said Nathan you can't preach anymore you can't you you can't have a position in the church anymore you can't work with young people anymore you can't be anything in the church you can't hold a mop you can't you can't answer the door you you you just I'm taking you down until you're just whatever this means a regular member of the bride just a regular just a plain basic entrylevel bride of Jesus Christ member oh my and you say and you're never going to be like that great brother and that great ministry and that man with that big church and his and and that one that's well known and you'll never be that oh my you know what that would mean to me that God thought so much of me that he would raise up that man he would raise up that Ministry he raised up Ray Ericson he raised up Wayne Lawson he raised up brother d he raised up men of God Amen for my benefit cuz he was thinking about me you see we got to turn it around and see the way God thinks about it he said I send you Elijah the prophet I'm the reason God sent a prophet You're the Reason God sent a prophet if he was great it's cuz you were great in the mind of God you were valued you were important you were worthy of receiving this ministry you don't think that's true brother Bram said that widow woman that Elijah went to he he said God would have never sent his Prophet to a house that was unworthy he said so she must have been of the same caliber as Elijah brother sister if you're in the Bride of Jesus Christ you're not undervalue you're the same caliber amen as this Kentucky hillbilly amen who died out to all his flesh and ran this message around the world to gather up the Bride of Jesus Christ You're the Reason God sent a prophet you say but he's the best man yes but you're the bride Hallelujah Hallelujah see the mystery is an economy the mystery is an economy oh what is this great mystery to the Gentiles it's Christ and you it's a hope of glory you and I could live a life of glory amen it won't be according to this thinking it'll be according to his thinking yes sir a hope of glory Christ and you that's the mystery so the mystery of the message is not what's being revealed just to your life not God sent you a prophet and he taught you how to baptize and he taught you that God was one and he taught you about serpent seed and he preached the seventh seal and the third pole and all those kind of things it's deeper than that brother sister not just what's revealed to you but what is being revealed through you God didn't fill you with his spirit you know to turn you into a pastor overnight or turn you into if you're a young man or young woman these little boys and girls God wants to fill them with the Holy Ghost not so that they'll immediately become a 30-year-old God wants to show the world what the Holy Ghost looks like what God looks like what deity looks like in a 13year old in a 14y old in a farmer in a factory worker in an engineer in a preacher in a singer in a in an Amen Corner in a prayer Warrior Hallelujah that's the mystery but it's an economy brother sister amen how many how many as I just feel to bring it down now maybe we'll just stand amen you love him today amen has this meant something to youj brother sister if we would bow our heads now and begin to just Ponder on the things that we've heard now I'm guilty many times in my life of being a consumer I'm guilty and maybe because I didn't value myself what I could bring maybe many times because I didn't value my own gift or I didn't value my own position in the body or whatever it would be somewhere this human thinking got in the way and when I could have supplied I sat by and consumed oh brother sister is there somebody here today would lift a hand to him and say Lord forgive me for being a consumer let me Supply Lord let me throw my all to the cause Lord let me fill my place in God's economy I see that participation is not an option Lord I want you to have my whole life whether I would value it whether somebody else would value what I bring Lord as long as you're pleased as long as I'm revealing the mystery of what was in your mind for me pertaining to my life Lord I'll be content but father I just want to serve you live a life that's worthy of this great message Lord you thought I was so valuable that you pay the ultimate price and that's where you set my worth Lord then I I Surrender my doubts I Surrender my complexes I Surrender my misgivings Lord and I accept your evaluation Lord by Faith Lord I I want to take hold of it Lord and I I I want to truly believe by your spirit Lord revealing it to me that I'm your bride and that I'm of value to you and I'm living a life of Eternal purpose Lord something that will matter on the other side Lord if we if we were rich on this side if we were great if we were famous if we were important and we were Mighty Lord we might achieve great things through human efforts father but then on the other side Lord Lord when this Mortal goes to the Earth father back to the dust and it all fades away into the void Lord then let there be something that lasts Let There be something that's Eternal Father only what's done for you will matter over there Lord I Thank you for Lord these honest hearts that have responded to your word Lord let them see father how important they are to you Lord speak to every heart let us go from this place Lord with a new way of thinking not in our thoughts of relative value but Lord may we be aware of our Eternal value today I pray bless each one meet every need Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen hallelujah oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ the lord we'll give him the glory we'll give him
