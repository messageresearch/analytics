quite so undecided on what I'm preaching today amen amen just had different messages prepared and and uh sometimes you think that you feel bad on they're out will miss it I know there's many online but amen let's just uh let's turn to Psalms 13 3 1 to three just uh was studying all day yesterday and I had a message prepared and God give me something else and I was kind of like I don't know which one I'll Preach Today and but we'll waiting and just uh kind of Amen kind of a year- end message and just uh how God's kept us and prepared us and amen we God's kept us safe another year we're still here still together still on Christ's side amen and yes let's just read the first three verses here behold how good and how pleasant it is for bre Brethren to dwell in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went to the skirt of His Garment that include the whole congregation the whole body and as the DW of Herman and and as the DW that descendeth upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessings even life everm more and the Lord commanded the blessings even life everm more Lord Jesus we pray that you'll add the blessing to your word Lord God and we pray that you'll bless your bride this morning and as the word Goes Forth may it it build us up in your faith Lord Jesus and and uh make us more like you Lord Jesus we pray in jesus' name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning Lord willing next week we're going to look at part of the Statue of the perfect man and and look at virtue was the main thing but we see here you know as long as we're on Earth the Bible says that you'll know them are we'll know that they're Christ disciples by how they love one another amen and we we need to get you know we need to you you get what you expect amen and and I I've actually been looking at that brother Brandon preached that and and that's very true and you know when you look even and I'm I'm I'm veering off here a minute but even when you look at the Statue of the perfect man you know the bottom of the the perfect man is is Faith and faith is to believe in God but you know there's many people that believe and never go farther than that you know Satan believes and trembles and there's so much more that God has for us up the statue of the perfect man I better get off that or I have to change my notes but we see here that you know God God did God planned his family to be in unity and even as he Compares this to the Prophet here when when he was anointed and it went down over the whole body of the the congregation the whole body of his right to the bottom of his skirt you know and and I want to bring this thought to you this morning you know the Bible says that every seed will bring forth of its kind and that's a really basic seed and that was in the Genesis in the garden but we see you know that cattle bring forth cattle and dog and all these things everything brings forth exactly of its kind the seed won't mix yeah amen but now let's think spiritual you believe you came from God you believe he's your heavenly father and every seed brings forth of its kind that means you're a part of God's family and you'll be a peculiar people you will act different you will have you will have the characteristics of your father which number one will be love God is love he'll have understand understanding and patience he'll understand his his situation but he'll have Unity that will dwell and and we preached that before in the family but the for a father to see the family in unity but to see his Heavenly family in unity and you know this thought was in my my uh me when I was thinking of the end of the year and thinking of all that's went past and the years we've been here and many of you's been in the faith longer than me and and older than me but God's kept us and there's a reason for it is is because we're part of his family and and and we bringing forth the seed that we are it's a seed that he predestinated you too he predestinated you to Unity amen God help us look at the the end of this scripture in verse three and he said there the Lord commanded it wasn't it wasn't a casual thing God commanded blessings on you it it was an order yeah says I know the thoughts that I have towards my family that wasn't in general to the world that was to you I know the thoughts that I have towards you amen and we as individuals in our body Tabernacle of Flesh you know this is this is just a a a blind or a veil amen but we need to we need to look past that Veil and recognize God in our brothers and sisters and respect them equally respect him as God because you brought forth the seed of your kind if you came from God you are God the only Christ that's on this Earth the only anointed ones that are on this Earth is the bride of Christ or the family of God are the only ones that are here you know that the the coming of Christ is in two different stages you know you know we we know he's coming back in an actual Rapture and body and take us with him but he's already come amen and spirit form and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's equally powerful the only difference in the comings is he's actually going to take us away in the other coming he's going to change our bodies but our bodies are in a process of changing so when our new body comes it'll be accepted that's right you know if let's look over in Ephesians 5 and uh 15 and then we're going to skip a verse and go to 172 21 and and just just looking at Unity this morning and looking at our year end message and where God took us to and and where God will bring us amen and and and how God commanded blessings even life ever more that's eternal life that that's not just this Earthly life this Earthly life is but a but a fainting flame it'll fade away like a plant that comes up and it's dead now it's already this life is already passed for the season of the past summer but your life is forever ever more eternal life is only for those that came from God are only for those that brought forth their seed of their kind and see here in Ephesians 5:15 says see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise now I want to look at that word circumspectly now if you're a lot smarter than me you might know the meaning of that but I never and that word means carefully watching every step avoiding unnecessary risk so let's let's reread that you see that you walk carefully not as fools but as wise and then we drop to verse 17 here here these are God's Commandments to us here Paul's writing this here he said therefore be not unwise but he just said that but he really wants us to get the meaning of this be not unwise but have understanding what is the will of the lord well the will of the Lord number one is for you to have perfect love agape love and and and I was reading and studying brother Bram gave a quote and and I I just I don't even think I put it down CU I read so many of them and this was amazing but he was talking to his second wife and she was asking him a question about who his wife would be in heaven because he had was hopeing media and she said media was saying she said I don't believe I would be jealous of hope you know she loves you too they're compare he she's trying to figure out what eternal life will be like and we know that uh we'll be together in heaven but it'll be like brothers and sisters and there'll be no sex glans there and it'll be much different almost beyond our comprehension but here brother Bram said he said you know media if I went up town I I don't I didn't even have this share I don't know why I'm sharing this but he said if I went up town and there was a prostitute and I hugged her and said I love you would that hurt you she said oh yeah I think that actually would that would affect me and she said he said this is your prophet he said now what if Jesus was here and he walked down the same street of our town and he hugged that prostitute and he said I love you she said oh I would really like that and he said now sister that's the difference of agapy love and F Your Love you're so caught up in your Earthly fleshly love that we can't have Unity because I like a gray car and I'm driving a white car and I hate it cuz it gets dirty you know you know what I mean that's that fio stuff but if we get to the agape love where we can look at our brothers and sisters and say hey you're my brother you're my sister because I see the attributes of your F my father in [Music] you real agape love I'm not talking about Sin amen I'm talking about God's love amen so verse 17 he said therefore be not ye unwise but understanding to know the will of the Lord is and there in verse 18 and be not drunken with wine where there's access but be filled with the spirit now we're going to read some quotes where the Prophet talked about this wine we should be drunk we should be Stone drunk with the Holy Spirit we should be so drunk with the holy spirit that they think we're drunk in the world that's how the new church was and they walked out and Peter said those amazing words he said this is but the third hour of the day he said this ain't new wine but this is that what Joel talked about that the spirit of God would come down on his family on his children and they would be so peculiar they would look so different outside of the veil that they would they would literally be drunk I I would never want to miss a service where anybody got drunk in the spirit ever and I would welcome it without out stretch arms and legs it is the most it's it's something that we don't deserve but it's worth all the golden 10 million worlds amen you know the world says that you'll get to a point that they're not worthy of your presence that's not in an arrogant way but it's just showing how this how God's expecting us to come up in our agape love and and our our unity and understanding and and take all that he has amen amen and just just just one more time mentioning the statue no God don't expect you to stay on the bottom of that statue we must climb it we must climb it amen I got to I got to leave that alone or I'm going to have a double sermon amen God help us here in verse 20 it says or 19 seeking yourselves speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual Psalms and singing and making Melodies in your heart to the Lord that's the only way that we can worship and pay back to God and show it's actually one way that you'll show who you are it's one way to show whose family you're a part of it's one way to show that you're drunk Amen in the spirit giving thanks always to God for all things and God and the father in our name the Lord Jesus Christ and submitting yourself this is what I wanted this is actually the thought that came to me was this verse submitting yourselves one to the other in the fear of God you know we always like like if you know I mean this goes on it talks about marriage and it talks about wife submitting to your husbands but before God even puts that down we all submit it it's not about wives and Men we're not on an ego trip here let's let's let's deal with the first ego first we're submitting to each other that's right and if we submit to each other in the fear of God we'll help each other and we'll be in unity that's why you'll have specials in the church that's why you'll have musicians in the church that's why you'll have people playing the tambourine and clapping their hands CU you're submitting you're submitting to each other but when you do that you're actually submitting to the Jehovah it's not about me you're not you're not coming here about me it's about Jehovah you submit yourself to one another amen you you you do this All In Worship that's why it's not about one Minister it's now never be a oneman minister ministry again that's why when we were gone brother Mt and brother Carson and the brother that came and visited we're submitting ourselves to for God to use us it don't matter if we're vacuuming the church or cooking a great meal or that somebody's going to cook me pumpkin pie someday that's submitting ourselves to the desires that came from the creation of the family of God if we do that verse we'll have all our problems taken care of when you submit yourself to each other in the fear of the Lord you know I I this comes to me in a funny way and and this is hilarious but you know when I was young and foolish and I was doing a lot and and this actually came to me when I was studying this and that was the verse that I started this whole message from submitting ourselves together in the fear of God excuse me you know I was in the fast lane when I was small and and you know like the 401 the vehicle that goes flying by you and that's the way I was living my life and and uh God has a purpose for everything but you know sometimes I would ask my wife to do something now you think of this and it wouldn't get done and I would go back to her and I think what happened and she said well you never even made the provisions like go to town but I don't have a vehicle to leave you know pay this bill and she said well I would gladly pay it but there ain't nothing in the bank but this is not a problem that we have in the the spiritual Realm God will never tell you to reach out for more of him and accept everything that he has for us and there not be nothing there to reach for that's right we want the fruits of the spirit we want everything in our midst and that's all a part of God you're not going to reach out for healing and not be there that's impossible you're not going to reach out for him to provide your needs and then not be there I I wish I could tell you I I read an amazing quote I sent it to a pastor in yuganda or uh in El Salvador this week but it was another promise talking about you know and and I mentioned this and one of the parents was ecstatic how job got his own children back and here and and it's on my phone I don't even have it here this is just fresh but it was an amazing scripture where God said when the Holy Spirit comes on you and he saves you he says it three or four times he said he saves your whole household amen than saves your whole household your whole brother or it's it's mentioned two or three different ways and I and I I just stumbled on the quote and I said I've never seen it that way because every seed will bring force of its kind amen and of course we're not preaching on that but that's part of submitting yourselves one to another see job he submitted himself under God when he gave a sacrifice for his kids their salvation wasn't even his it was his prayer and sacrifice that per se the kids could do something wrong but we can do the same thing in the family of God in this church you can put a sacrifice over your brothers and sisters and even your pastor if you would be so blessed to do that that if something a mistake come up that God couldn't see it because of the blood of the sacrifice that's called in yourselves together to each other amen God help us here brother Brown talks about this you know in the message Hub you can take the exact verse there and he said submitting yourself in the fear of God he said submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor but he don't stop there he said pastor submit yourself to the congregation he said and if there's little uh clicks or raise up don't take either side but you're submit yourself to the whole congregation it's not about a congregation it's about a family submit yourself to each other you don't have to be afraid that God won't have nothing in the bank for you to hold you you see like the song We sang the new song it's God that's holding you see no man comes to the father but first he draws them that makes your faith actually given by God cuz Faith is the Bel no man can please God except to have faith that's belief but you couldn't even believe unless God first gave it to you to draw you to you sometimes we think oh well you know I'm just amen God help us see you submit each other to your yourself we submit to each other in the fear of God because we're equally created by God that's right do you know we're not different ages in God's thoughts we came in different Church ages but in God's thought you were all created at the same moment let us make you in our image M and female period we all got the exact same birthday imagine when January 26 comes we're going to throw a real party cuz that's when well you were all oh that's the see that's the veil see the difference and so in our Veil we all have likes and dislikes and differences but to God we're exactly the same exactly the same it was either he drew you to himself or you never came from him period that's none of our business now we see the same scripture we carry on in James 5:116 and this is a beautiful thought and i' I've actually preached on this way back in the house and though this is we don't want to confuse this this is not sins we don't have no mediator between us and the father you confess your sins directly to the Throne don't tell me your sins because I'm cursed with a memory and so are you you so we understand that so we're not a Catholic Church where we go to a pope but watch this confess your faults one to another that's submitting yourself in unity that's saying you know I eat too much I drive too fast I like to party every day I like to I have a lot of people around me those aren't sins those are just things that you're working through but that very scripture goes perfectly with submitting yourself one to another or confessing your faults one to another do you know those were different people that wrote that in the Bible Paul wrote Ephesians James write in his own book but see how it's exactly the same no not in words but in spirit the spirit is exactly the same because it was God that anointed them men of old confess your faults one to another and pray one to the other that ye may be healed I wonder if we see less healings because we're too proud yeah to say I I struggle with spending too much money I struggle with uh-huh pray one for another that ye may be healed and we've seen you know we mention healings you know and I I say this just just comes to me fresh you know I mentioned about a bunch of healings from Brother Carson and sister Sharon sister dma had a a beautiful scripture or healing and she' sent it brother Lauren and me were talking about it you know she went into they wanted to induce her so she wouldn't give birth during the holidays and we need to remember them in prayer her due date was Christmas I believe Christmas so she's overrun some anyway you went in you know how doctors they they can only study what they've learned in science and they said oh you know but they operate out of fear amen praise God we this is one thing this message don't operate out of it that's fear if if you ever feel fear in this place it's not of God cuz it's CU God has nothing there's no love in fear perfect love cast on all fear you know what fear is it it fear is the the substance that shows up when you when there's something lacking and you know what the lacking is God so you know I can get on any you know God Satan could never take you or me until God's completely done with you God knew it already exactly your plan when you're going to go either in the Rapture or by the way of the Grave to wake up and come and tell me that it's time for me to get a new body and we all go in the Rapture together cuz those that sleep or we that are alive will not hinder those that sleep so watch this he said if you say well I don't I'm afraid I'm a fearful I don't I don't think I'll go to Uganda CU I'm afraid to it's because something's lacking yeah basically you know what I they okay I'm I'm going to stretch out there but basically you could cross the street without looking if you were that so do to God if you were in a different dimension not no that's just you know serving God is just borderline it's just right on the defensive the world will look at you as Insanity so you know brother Bram said things he said anytime you were going to spread the gospel you're in the perfect will of God you couldn't be no safer anywhere in the world in the perfect will of God you could be in Machine Gun Territory if you're in the perfect will of God so watch this fear if fear is portrayed in a church or in a people it's because the absence of one thing aren't you glad you aren't sitting in a denominational church if you leave this church you're going to go to hell if you quit being a Baptist and you become a Catholic bless God we have the only oh don't ever listen to Fear Church don't ever don't ever listen to a fear sermon If You Preach you we we're not going to heaven because we fear hell brother Brown said if God sent me to hell I would deserve hell and I would still love him in hell cuz he's still God yes sir God help us you know this is kind of the end of the year and you reflect on things but confess your faults one to another hey if we all have a behind her s Israel were God's chosen people balam would have had no problem cursing them except God wouldn't allow it he'd start talking he would start saying oh you know that brother and God would just say he's a wonderful person B that's not what I was going to say you remember that preacher you know and God would just that's what he did to the prophet but Israel God help us Ephesians 5 and 26 27 that's a little further down than what we read that he might sanctify us and cleanse Us by the washing of the water of the word you know you know what the prophet said that is he said that's the preaching of the word he said that's you digging into the word that's you feeding on the word even yourself it's a word that washes us clean that he might present you a to himself a glorious church that's actually a glorious family yes he didn't come to save the church he came to save the bright or his family he came to save the ones that came out of him not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy and without blames I believe we're coming to the part where we can forget all these little differences a little different fleshly things and and childly they're childless things brother Brown said that so most of the time it's just very childish things and we'll be members of his body verse 30 for we are members of his body and flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone remember how I said that every seed brings forth of its kind amen if you want to know if you came from God you'll have the attributes of God we're going to go into that next Sunday Lord willing and look at how powerful it is it's not just good enough I I want you this I had to stretch this one a bit and I had to study it but it's not good enough just to believe that's there's many people that will never be in heaven they say well I believe in the Lord I believe in Jesus many many many many many people but if we have his characteristics and his attributes we'll amen show them amen I I'm going to step out bounce here I'm struggling with this whole message but you know virtue the definition of virtue in the English language I have it in the Greek too but it's character and power so you will have God's character and God's power so if you don't have God's power and you don't have God's character well I'm happy you believe in them but that's not enough cuz Satan believes trembles so we look at here we we looked at our scripture about being uh drunk in the spirit and and uh here in Ephesians be not unwise and be not drunken with wine and and I I should have brought that verse down closer to my quotes but I I took some quotes off that here and I'd like to read some of these quotes here he said you know God's the bride the groom and the bride has come forth cuz it's a part of him and the only manifestation that will fulfill the revelation of the spoken bride is if it will manifest the same thing so see we'll manifest character and power amen and if the bride manifest something different than the groom then they didn't come from the groom then it isn't the bride cuz she's flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and life of his life and power of his power and she is him oh I love this man as a man and woman are one the woman is taken from the his side and she's taken the feminine Spirit from him now we know that from Genesis 1:27 was they were created one person masculine and feminine spirit and when he took Eve he only took the feminine Spirit but they were one first one it was not so from the beginning there were one body oh I want to show you something and and I'm flirting with by the message but I want to show you something you know there's three different manifestations where where Christ came as a man amen Genesis 1:27 he made us in the image man amen uh I just forgot the third one the there the third one uh oh boys forgive me Jesus the third one is the bride and he's the head the third one is he's the head of the body but we're the body oh the third one when John seing him thank you Jesus in Revelation 13 Revelations 1:13 I just had a brain priest when John looked at Christ he said it was like one like the son of man and the head was Jesus and the body had breast hello that was one body three times three times one body so Genesis 1:27 is he created the man male and female in a man Revelations 1:13 John looked at a man that was like a man and it was the man was a head but the but he had but the body had BR was a female and the Christ the bride church today if Christ ain't the head of this church we're dad's door Nails amen he's the boss he's the Holy Spirit and he's dirting I don't even know what I'm preaching but he's the one that's leading he's the brains he's the everything but the body three in one the trinity in one amen glory amen yes sir amen oh Hallelujah and the man and woman are one and the woman is taken theide the spirit the feminine Spirit of him and the flesh was from him and this was both mechanics and Dynamics the wife see when you become wife you can write checks that's right when somebody comes to your house and they're selling uh frozen shrimp at the garage and and salmon your wife knows that you don't want salmon but you want frozen shrimp she's not the head but she knows what the head wants she's in the same body I don't know if you're getting it and the spirit that's in him the spirit of him and the Flesh of him was put and put it together and it made the mechanics and Dynamics that's what we have you can't be you can't be you can't come from him you can't be bride and you can't be wife without having both and if you don't have both then you're just at the believing stage and Satan believes but he don't have nothing amen until the church comes to both Dynamics and mechanics it'll uh that'll move him to do the things that he did and if he hit if here he's talking about God he said the the prophet is saying this uniquely he said when God hit on all 16 cylinders that must have been a honking truck when God hit on all 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he is in John 14:11 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do do also and I give him charge of my D mechanics and Dynamics my I give him charge of my Dynamics and in his mechanics that the world will not be able to not be able to withstand it and I'll raise them up again in the last day he said he closes this quote out by saying he said that's the Easter message Dynamics and mechanics are together God don't separate them so if you got one you got if you came from God you got both CU God didn't separate them amen Matthew 2739 and 43 and it came to pass that they reviled him now I want to show you something I'm I'm showing you a mystery God's showing you a mystery it's not me I ain't showing you nothing I'm God shown you a mystery that if you're his bride and the groom had mechanics and Dynamics I started to tell you a story of sister dla did I finish that she went to the doctor and she had too much fluid around the baby and they the doctor said oh the umbilical CT it's going to move and we better induce you you better have the baby tomorrow tom being a very wonderful person and the bride of Christ she said let's just wait oh I love people like that and she went home and prayed she sent me a prayer request she went back the next week and the doctor that was inv was what do they call those baby doctors they uh whatever they are yeah you be G doctor something she whatever she did she see uh you know whatever they do to the women you know they read the baby and she said oh oh you're perfect you have exactly the Perfection she was above high she was too high she said you have the Perfection actually if it was anything it was at the lower level the perfect fluid and sister dma she was looking for a testimony she said have you ever seen this before doctor and she said no not in my 20 years being a doctor I've never seen the move of God never seen the move of God but I did today and she ain't had that baby yet cuz she was perfect amen oh Hallelujah see if the groom did the mechanics and Dynamics so will the bride cuz they're a part of them where was I so in this mystery we see this that people misjudge no so we we believe in miracles I just told you two last Sunday and one this Sunday already amen those are miracles amen those are dynamics and I mean those are just the ones off the top of my head and the ones I know about but watch this in Matthew 39 Matthew 27 sorry 39 here they passed by Jesus and they reviled Jesus waging their heads they oh he don't have no Miracles he don't have no no character he don't have no power that's Matthew 2739 we need that up there Matthew 27:39 and saying unto Jesus that thou could destroy the that thou destroyest the temple and rebuild it in three days he said watch watch how they're tempting God save yourself if thou be if I I love that word if Satan's such a liar if thou be the Son of God then come down off the cross what they didn't realize was it took more Dynamics to keep them on the cross than it did to take them off the cross that's right they had a misunderstanding in their head of Dynamics because Jesus said in the scriptures he said I could call 10 Legions of angels to destroy the world and set me free can you imagine that's like having that would be like try to comprehend that character that you have the power complete power complete decision to destroy the world and take those complete like that would be like my son going to a cattle sale with 5 million in his account and not buying cattle that's not possible actually even if it was 10,000 in his account that's probably not possible oh see he took more power for him to refuse what he had it took more power for brother Brown to say I forgive you the young people that were making love on the front Pew took more power for him to forgive them when he really wanted to throw them out in the flesh hello that's right you want to see dynamics that was Dynamics you want to see Dynamics Christ staying on the cross for me a loser when I was ugly he still loved me that's that's Dynamics thank you jesuses and you're having trouble with somebody on the Pew with you oh my goodness watch this and that that's not all verse 41 same chapter and likewise also the chief priests mocking Jesus now now I just got one question for you did Jesus have the mechanics and the Dynamics did he do Dynamics did he do them repeatedly were they at the stop of his finger if he wanted them yeah nobody changed him to that cross but love mocking him with the scribes and elders and said he saves everybody else but himself he cannot save that was exactly the truth he did save me he saved all of us and in so doing he saved himself because unless a corn of week falls into the ground Abid Al loone but if it dies it'll bring forth much amen they they they just said that reverse they didn't even realize that they were quoting what God was doing he saved others but himself and saving the others he saves himself you know what that's the same for your brothers and sisters when you you don't think so you parents when you hold the token over your family you're actually saving them that's what job did well the Jailer when he said you believe for you and your household huh what are you doing he saved but himself you were extending out the yeah the token brother B said this he said if you believe that you have if you have enough Faith to believe that God give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have enough Faith to claim it for your family amen wow I like those quotes they here they're mocking them saying he saved others but himself he could not save in Saving the others he saved himself cuz we are him but they didn't know that and if he be king of the Israel let him come down off the cross and we'll believe him see there was the lie if you do something for me I'll believe believe you yeah that's like a false prophet or a false preacher if you give me a lot of money I'll I'll really liar you can be bought amen hallelujah let's move on to another example of the Dynamics first Corinthians 2 7 8 10 and 12 and 14 or I'm skipping around on some verses I'll tell you when we get to them but 1 Corinthians 2:7 but we speak the mystery of God the or sorry we speak of the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom see not everybody has it which God ordained before the foundation of the world on to our Glory not the world's Glory but to your glory verse eight of 1 Corinthians 2 which none of the princes of the world knew for had they they would have not have crucified the Lord you see not everybody had the knowledge and wisdom of Christ that's how they could say well he saved everybody else but couldn't save himself they had no clue that when he saved everybody else he was saving himself that's right because we are sheep now the Bible says that we're bone of his bone flesh of his flesh that's pretty much remember the one body if he didn't save me then how could have he looked like in Ro Revelations 1:13 like a man what would have happened to the body the head wouldn't have been a lot of good without a body under it so in Saving you he saved himself he would have been like a beheaded chicken Hallelujah see but they didn't understand is is that the Dynamics The Mystery of the Hidden wisdom that God ordained before the foundation of Lord be For Your Glory for our Glory which is PR princes of this world knew not not none of them knew had they known it they would have not had crucified him verse 10 for God has revealed them unto us by his holy spirit that's to those that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the only ones that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost are those that came out of him that Holy Spirit is Christ spirit and for the spirit that searches all things yay the Deep things of God verse 12 and we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god now the bi the verse right prior that said those were the Deep things but we have received the spirit which is of god that we might know the things what wait a minute that but they said right just a couple verses over they said it was hidden but it wasn't hidden it see it's hidden but it it but two verses down lower it says we'll know but it is hidden but we'll know but it's not hidden from you that you might know the things that are freely given to us of God verse 13 which also which things also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches see I can't give you Revelation nobody can give you Revelation but what the the Holy Spirit teaches compare comparing the spiritual things with the spiritual see the mystery and all the people that nailed Jesus on the cross they never understood they never understood the Dynamics of his plan or they would have never done it but it was hid from them because they weren't part of him Hallelujah and but and verse 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God brother baham said this multiple times and I know the Bible says that study to show yourself appr proof he said you can't study yourself into the spirit of God you can't educate yourself into the spirit of God Peter could not have been educated he could have went to all the cemeteries in the world and he would have never knew that he was the Christ because the Sadducees and Pharisees they had went to all the cemeteries in the world and they could push the needle through the Scribe tell you ever lited hit but when Christ came in his deity they didn't even know who he was they were as blind as bats amen what verse was I on but the natural man canot receive these things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto them neither can he know them because they are spiritually watch this you need to see this verse 14 the end of spirit the end of 14 for they are spiritually you see that last two words discerned spiritually discern I can just show you the scripture and I can point you in the right point you to Christ but it's Christ that will spiritually and all that came from him will spiritually discern and those that won't they'll say well why didn't he come down off the cross he could have built up his kingdom here and Peter could have been on one side and James on the other he would have delivered the children of Israel under the the the the the reign of Rome wouldn't have that been great maybe we wouldn't be under a Roman Dominion now but he said this world is not my kingdom or I'd fight for it but the kingdom that was his he fought for that's why he stayed on the cross cuz in Saving you he saved himself because you were in the same body the same body oh I love that I that's just crazy good you were in the same body as him Hallelujah John 6 moving on another scripture here John 639- 44 and this is the Father's will which has sent me that all which he has given me I shall lose nothing but I shall raise them up in the last days now that's also in our Ephesian scriptures the first one we raised and I got to get to my quotes here we're coming we're coming to my quotes and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him have everlasting life and I will raise them up in the last days and the Jews murmured at him because he said I am the bread of life that come down out of heaven and they said is this not oh there you go see they're having trouble with that Badger skin they're having trouble with that Veil they're having trouble with the person that like pumpkin pie they said is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know oh that's why a prophet's not well received in his own land because you know his history how is it then that he saith I came down from heaven see they didn't understand the supernatural the spiritually discerned they never understood none of that at all and no man can come unto me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last there's the faith that God it's your faith when you get it but God gave it to you or you'd never believe on him amen now I got a couple a couple uh couple quotes and we'll close I do have another scripture but I think we'll say goodbye to that here this is an early quote of the prophet he said on the day of Pentecost they were on one Accord in one place and suddenly a sound from heaven and and man had nothing to do with it like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and the power of God struck upon them and they went out into the street acting like a bunch of Maniacs like they they did down there when they came out through the Red Sea right they were screaming and carrying on and staming and stammering with their lips and they were beating on the tambourines said such a carrying on till the people identified them and stood back and said these people are drunk remember our first of scriptures Ephesians said be not drunk with strong drink but be in the spirit watch this it was spiritually drunk he said Hallelujah I'm going to call me you're going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well start now all right he said look they were full of new wine he said that oh and I I just love that presence I mean but you know how he started that out he said man had nothing to do with it let me see man had nothing to do with it the power the the they were all on one Accord and suddenly a sound from Heaven come down and man had nothing to do with it not this man if it if this man had anything to do with it it was just praying and surrendering getting out of the way not I I I'm not my own self I'm not the boss you're the boss whatever Grace wants to do we want it we want more healings in our midst we want everything that he's got but we have to get out of the way for him to do it it's not us that decides brother Braham said himself he said if I could hear you I'd hear you right now but it I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the head he said look they were full of new wine that's right the wine that comes from God out of heaven and did you ever see a drunk man now there's a reason I'm reading this scripture he said he is just in love with everyone uhoh see now I know if you got the Holy Spirit you'll be drunk and then you'll be in love he said they're just drunk he said they're just in love with everybody you see he don't care he said that's the way a man is when he gets drunk on the spirit uh-oh the Bible says be careful not to drink or a strong drink with access but be drunk in the spirit he said the spirit of God makes you so drunk you forget who's your enemy you forget who you don't like you forget everything and everybody's in love with you he don't care about who's standing around you you're the biggest man in the country right then because you're drunk he says I don't care if your neighbor is sitting next to you and you want to and and he went to some uh fancy Church dignified sorry and and your name I couldn't read the word he went to some fancy dignified church he said just let the Holy Ghost get on you one time and see what takes place he said get right real good drunk he actually says sou drunk and and that word s means very or thoroughly drunk he said you might go to a dignified church but you just get thoroughly drunk and you'll see what takes place you'll say sister or brother you're in love with everyone I got just my last quote I promise see how he said if we're drunk in the spirit but if we have the spirit we should be drunk now he says something a little bit different and he said so when you're drunk you just love every you could care less you could care less if they like you or don't like you you still love them and and you act kind of foolish you ever see a drunk man not act foolish but if you're drunk spiritually you kind of act foolishly here's my last quote it's kind of a long one but he he hit something in a different way here he said when they cross over the Red Sea they had a great baked Pentecostal Jubilee a camp meeting why if it wasn't a Pentecostal meeting he said I've never seen one he said Moses sang in the spirit and miam they all beat it on tambourines danc in the spirit and if that ain't Pentecostal I've never seen one that's right he said God promised to supply all their needs for the journey and he promised us to supply all our needs for our journey so how could you not just be drunk and be happy and the same God the same God by the same promises the same God made the promises now next Sunday we're going to look into how do we get God's promises that's part of the satue of the perfect man and we find out that when they got out there little ways they didn't have no bread now God had already promised it to them and they had already been drunk in the spirit they didn't get out there and they didn't have bread and God rained bread down from heaven for them and they called it mana and when he went out and tasted it they said it was sweet and it was very beautiful type of the Holy Spirit our life it is a natural bread of men on their Journey but we got the spiritual bread watch this we got the spiritual bread for the spiritual man Journey here and now if you look and you never cease this long journey he said Moses told Aaron this is beautiful here he said now after this journey he said go and take some of that Heavenly Mana which is the type of the Holy Spirit and put it in the holies of holies for all the generations that's us typed us for all the generations to come that we could get some of the original one body it wasn't so from the beginning the original Mana was the first food the first holy spirit that ever fell we could taste some of that save it the holies are holies and they could get a mouthful of the original Mana that fell the first time the power of the Holy Ghost he said that's a beautiful type of the holy spirit that fell in the day of Pentecost when Peter said unto them this is that that Joel spoke of and often I've thought of this he said you'll notice that when they were eating the Mana they got drunk just as drunk as they could be and was stering around like a drunk man he said listen he said my C friend he said even Mary Virgin Mary that had Jesus had to be on the day of Pentecost to receive the Holy Spirit and he said you know the trouble today is the reason is we're so allergic to so many things we don't get watch this this is he goes a completely different way he said the reason we're so allergic to so many things the reason we don't have unity in our body in our groups the reason that we don't confess our faults one to another is because you don't get drunk enough you believe that he said now here he talks about now I'm going to paraphrase he talks about a man that was from the Salvation armies in England time and he missed his plane and he went for a walk and he walked with a cop and it was raining and there was an old drunk laying in the street and he was just as Stone drunk as could be I told you this quote was a little different this is all tied into the our first quote that we read scriptures Ephesians 5 and he said the cop and him called the the puddle wagon and they were going to put the drunk on the puddle wagon and brother brandham asked him he said what will you do with them and the cop said why will take him down and throw them throw him in the The Jug and he said well well that ain't going to take care of him and he said he don't need help I said well why the man will catch he said the man will catch amonia and he said I guess if you took them down to the Salvation Army and you put them on a little pad warmed them up give them some hot coffee and hot bath and all these things and here here's how brother Brown asked or this guy from England sorry it wasn't brother Brown he's telling the story this guy from The Salvation Army he says sir you can do that take him to the Salvation Army warm him up give him coffee give him a hot bath and all these things that sounds nice and he said you'll kill him and I said huh that sounded nice to me so far here's what the man said he said because you don't have the wisdom is hidden and it's not given to everyone but it's given to you he said you people don't understand he said that man is so drunk that every pore of his skin is filled with whiskey and they said he could never freeze to death he couldn't get cold he was Frozen to the curb his clothes were frozen to the curb but he said he was so drunk and he said the Bible says not to be drunk with strong drinks as access but be drunk in the spirit he said that's the matter today he said if you got so drunk till our own carcass would be so full of the Holy Spirit until nothing else could penetrate or Purge in any way our troubles would be over the trouble is that we don't get the good oldfashioned drunk Pentecostal Holy Ghost drunk you want to pamper them take them to the Salvation Army put them under a book of Creeds show them some kind of filal love give them some some coffee and you kill him but if he ever comes into the presence of Jehova and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he acts like a radical drunk there nothing could come in there he'll have the mechanics and the Dynamics because he is he got so much of God that his outer body watch this like a drunk is not in control things that your body would control and you wouldn't drive into a tree and you will like this and you would walk up to your enemies and shake their hand give them a big hug you'll do if you're drunk and you'll do if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's stand how pleasant and how beautiful it was when brethren dwell together in unity the only way you can dwell together in unity is if you get good and drunk from the Holy Spirit you're not you're not going to enjoy hanging around me in the flesh and many of us will enjoy hanging around each other in the flesh but if we all get drunk in the Holy Spirit we'll love each other's company because we'll be in the family in a different realm and it'll show show who's in control you know I me close with this sentence a drunk has no fear they driveing walls trees kill them they don't even know their dad the trucks roll over their head I know people from high school they have no fear because they're in a different realm but spiritually speaking when you get in when you get in Christ's realm you have no fear you're not fearful who's going to take over nobody can take over your kingdom your Kingdom's Christ Kingdom like if if you think if you think some person going to take over your body they'd have to take over God's body you have no fear and so you're not worried about well I don't care what they say they do this or that other that's and this body's completely out of control and you do things and say things that you don't even know you're saying brother Brown said that he said I have to relisten to the tape to know what I said when I said it cuz he was drunk amen God bless you this morning God bless you and happy New Year and we love you and we want all that Christ says for us to get us out of here and a body change and and enjoy our life while we're here together amen God bless you all he became me so that I might become him by [Laughter] [Applause] Grace he became me so that I might become him byre oh
