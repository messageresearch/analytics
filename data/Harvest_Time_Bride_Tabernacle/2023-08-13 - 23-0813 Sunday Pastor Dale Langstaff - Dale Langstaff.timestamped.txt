[27:49] of an evil thing and many times visitors
[27:52] will come they won't recognize it or

[32:47] amen
[32:49] amen
[32:51] Hallelujah
[32:54] amen well I want to preach this morning
[32:55] or God wants to preach this morning on
[32:58] amateur creators
[33:03] and I want to my subtitle
[33:10] or my thought is
[33:12] if your world
[33:14] gets Jesus in the right place
[33:17] it'll be all right
[33:20] if your world
[33:23] gets Jesus
[33:25] in his right place
[33:27] then everything will be okay
[33:29] amen let's read Isaiah 66
[33:32] thus saith the Lord the heavens is my
[33:36] throne and the Earth is my footstool and
[33:39] where is the house that you ye
[33:43] build unto me
[33:46] and where is the place of my rest for
[33:49] all these things hath my handmaid and
[33:53] all these things have been saith the
[33:55] Lord
[33:56] but to this man I will look even to him
[34:02] this will help us get Jesus in the right
[34:04] place
[34:05] that's poor
[34:08] and I'm a contrite spirit
[34:11] and trembless respect us
[34:16] at my word
[34:18] amen Lord Jesus we had asked you had the
[34:21] blessing to your word and we give you
[34:23] the glory and the honor for it in your
[34:26] name we pray amen amen you may have your
[34:28] seeds let's turn over to Matthew 21
[34:32] amen Matthew 21
[34:35] and 21 and Jesus answered onto them and
[34:38] said verily verily I say unto you
[34:40] that if you have faith
[34:43] and doubt not
[34:45] ye shall not only do this which is done
[34:49] to the fig tree but also if ye shall say
[34:52] unto this mountain
[34:54] be thou
[34:56] God
[34:57] removed
[34:58] and be thou cast into the sea
[35:01] it shall be done
[35:04] and all things whatsoever ye shall ask
[35:06] in prayer
[35:08] believing
[35:12] you receive it
[35:14] amen God help us
[35:16] to actually believe
[35:18] God
[35:19] help us to believe
[35:21] what he said you know our Prophet showed
[35:24] us in the message he said and the
[35:26] Lexicon in the original Greek it said
[35:29] where the scripture is talking about
[35:31] this mountain be removed
[35:34] it literally means interpreted properly
[35:37] it means that you would be lifted up and
[35:40] thrown
[35:42] into the sea
[35:44] amen
[35:46] now that's radical
[35:49] that's extreme
[35:51] and we struggle with these things
[35:54] because we have fear
[35:56] we have fear that God still ain't God
[36:00] we do I do
[36:02] amen we have fear to speak things
[36:07] into existence
[36:09] the Bible says that he's a the high
[36:12] priest of your confection confession
[36:16] amen it's all right to say that next
[36:18] year
[36:21] amen God will give me this
[36:24] if you have the token
[36:26] amen God's speaking through your lips
[36:29] amen the prophet said that that with the
[36:31] messages in us and we will have not say
[36:34] it the Lord
[36:35] we put amen we put everything on the
[36:38] prophet you know I heard a Minister
[36:39] preach and it was it was just beautiful
[36:41] you know we're not raising amen now we
[36:44] need ministers we believe in faithful
[36:47] we believe in the prophets we believe in
[36:49] brother Brown
[36:52] but what about you
[36:55] but what about you do you believe in
[36:56] yourself do you believe in the bride
[36:59] it's easy for you to believe in the
[37:01] five-fold ministry it's even easy for
[37:03] you to believe in brother Branham it's
[37:05] easy for you to believe that God sent a
[37:06] prophet and he revealed the mysteries of
[37:08] the belief but you don't believe the
[37:09] bride
[37:13] but that was the message
[37:17] it was it was Christ sending a prophet
[37:20] to draw a wife to himself
[37:22] amen watch what the prophet says here
[37:25] and this is beautiful and praise God for
[37:27] the people that made the message of it's
[37:29] amazing it is the most amazing thing on
[37:32] earth
[37:33] here's a comment a mess uh that the
[37:37] prophet made regarding the scripture
[37:40] that we read
[37:42] in Isaiah 66 and 1 that heaven
[37:46] is my throne and Earth is my footstool
[37:49] he said now heaven couldn't hold them
[37:53] do you know this morning that heaven
[37:55] couldn't hold you
[37:58] did you ever think of that
[38:00] that's why you're here today
[38:02] heaven couldn't hold them and the Earth
[38:05] Is His footstool and heaven was his
[38:07] throne and yet it could bring the
[38:09] fullness of the godhead bodily
[38:12] and embodied it into
[38:22] no
[38:24] everything that was in Christ is in his
[38:27] pride
[38:28] if if heaven couldn't hold Christ he
[38:31] couldn't hold his pride
[38:33] amen if if the Earth is Christ's
[38:36] footstool it's the bride's footstool
[38:39] amen
[38:41] and the the whole godhead bodily
[38:44] was enthroned
[38:46] and God
[38:47] put it into you
[38:49] it's in the Paradox message
[38:51] in that
[38:53] that's powerful amen this morning
[38:56] amen
[38:57] help us Jesus you know there's a I want
[39:00] to just read a story before we look into
[39:03] some some quotes and that but maybe
[39:06] we'll we'll read a quote here he said
[39:08] the gospel always does this it always
[39:12] opens the eyes of some and reveals the
[39:15] truth to some while it blinds others
[39:19] it has a two-fold meaning
[39:21] some take the Son of God and look
[39:24] straight at it
[39:25] and go completely blind
[39:28] and others look take the son of God look
[39:31] at it and walk out a completely changed
[39:35] past
[39:37] he said it's always done this in every
[39:39] age deity
[39:40] veiled in fleshed notice that the notice
[39:45] the veil was behind the old Badger skin
[39:48] the old Temple and you know this morning
[39:51] when you look into this the reason that
[39:54] we're not where we should be the reason
[39:56] that brother Dale ain't where he should
[39:57] be
[39:59] it's because we haven't come in fully
[40:01] to Christ
[40:04] president
[40:06] come in fully to Christ
[40:10] because we would be able to speak Christ
[40:12] out by our words more often
[40:16] amen and not tremble when we say
[40:21] amen God will withhold his word it's God
[40:24] that amen I just was read listening to
[40:27] something this morning man Exodus 12 12
[40:29] I think it is that God will fight for
[40:31] you
[40:32] the Bible's the lord it's not mine it's
[40:36] God's reason you know I heard it like
[40:37] this I said a minister said well I'm
[40:39] afraid to pray for healing because I'm
[40:42] going to have a healing light and you're
[40:43] going to come up and healed and you're
[40:44] not going to get healed so what will I
[40:46] tell the people
[40:48] either I'm false or are God's faults
[40:51] and you know what the minister answer
[40:53] Mike he said it ain't your
[40:54] responsibility to hold up God's word
[40:59] my responsibility to show you and preach
[41:01] it God's word
[41:03] amen God will take care of his hands you
[41:06] don't need to worry about that
[41:08] amen
[41:09] God help us amen but the reason that
[41:12] we're not where we should be this
[41:14] morning is because we fully commend to
[41:17] Christ and it's it showed perfectly in
[41:20] the Tabernacle in the wilderness in the
[41:22] Old Testament
[41:23] you know he had in the Tabernacle you
[41:25] had the outer carts and you had the
[41:27] inner courts that was really good
[41:30] I mean it had a beautiful building it
[41:32] had pot lights like this and
[41:37] that
[41:39] they were oil controlled
[41:43] amen
[41:45] and so here in the outer cards
[41:47] is where brother Dale lives too often
[41:49] when I listen to the news
[41:54] it might rain
[41:56] oh Lord we don't need no more rain it
[41:58] might hail they're going to be Looney
[42:00] size oh God we don't need help protect
[42:03] your crop
[42:05] Russia's
[42:11] you know God never said one place in the
[42:13] Bible to listen to the news
[42:15] mm-hmm
[42:26] the digital money's coming out in a
[42:28] couple years
[42:30] hmm
[42:33] outer courts
[42:35] outer courts
[42:37] amen
[42:38] it's because
[42:39] we care about this world that's our
[42:42] problem
[42:43] we didn't care about this world brother
[42:45] don't have no problems at all
[42:48] prepare that the digital money might
[42:49] come out and it might mess up our money
[42:51] system
[42:56] we care about this world
[43:00] so that person's in the outer cars
[43:03] and they're affected by the rain and the
[43:05] Sunshine and the clouds
[43:07] and their Christian life is just like
[43:09] whoa up and down up and down it's sunny
[43:13] day oh it rains three days
[43:17] and then a lot of message believers they
[43:19] move into the inner carts
[43:22] and that's a lot better
[43:25] because they have really cool oil lights
[43:29] and they put them on when it's raining
[43:33] and that
[43:35] and you know they have they have Windows
[43:38] that they close when it's windy
[43:40] and fans that they turn on when it's hot
[43:43] and it's climate control but their
[43:46] government has a problem with the
[43:47] electricity grid and it goes down and it
[43:50] messes everything up
[43:52] and you oh
[43:55] I hope I can pay my electricity bill
[44:03] and you know if you look at the message
[44:04] here today you'd say well there's
[44:07] probably about 40 percent in the outer
[44:09] cars
[44:11] and there's probably about
[44:13] 59.9 percent
[44:15] in the intercourse
[44:21] I hope I'm wrong
[44:23] and then there's a spot
[44:27] when you get to the holy police
[44:29] and the prophet said it like this I had
[44:32] the quote in front of me but I can say
[44:34] it by memory better he says a bond can
[44:37] go off right beside you and you're just
[44:39] like
[44:43] the Hydra can go off and nothing changes
[44:46] in the holy of holus
[44:48] and all your people can stay home from
[44:50] church and they don't change nothing
[44:52] because you didn't see any of them
[44:56] and nobody can
[44:59] the music player can miss a tune in the
[45:03] computer can shut down and
[45:06] the Bell can fall off the church
[45:09] and the steeple cannot be painted
[45:12] and you're just like whoa
[45:17] and you're zoned in with Christ
[45:20] in the holy of holies
[45:23] and it's just you
[45:25] and him
[45:26] that's all you recognize is him now
[45:29] there's other people there but you don't
[45:30] recognize them
[45:32] because
[45:33] you're just zoned in on him
[45:36] and that's called
[45:39] building a world
[45:41] and living on it
[45:44] he's saying now what is this world
[45:47] it's very clear what this world is
[45:50] it's called The Tokens or the baptism of
[45:53] the Holy Ghost
[45:56] uh-huh see a man cannot have two masters
[46:00] he will either cleats are the one and
[46:02] and reject the other or he will hate the
[46:05] one and love the other
[46:06] but when you get one master
[46:11] amen
[46:13] tell our Prophet told us he called it
[46:15] the hidden place
[46:17] a place that God made that you can be in
[46:20] and it don't matter if your bills are
[46:22] paid that affects me don't matter if it
[46:25] rains that affects me too
[46:27] it don't matter
[46:28] it don't matter
[46:34] it don't matter
[46:36] that's hardly a reality to brother Dale
[46:41] because I I have Badger skin
[46:44] so we have to get behind the badger skin
[46:48] amen
[46:49] amen the story is told
[46:51] of a minister
[46:53] that was trying to do his message
[46:57] and my God give me this message probably
[46:59] over a month ago I I was studying with
[47:01] it yesterday and putting some last
[47:03] things and written some quotes off
[47:06] and he was the minister was struggling
[47:10] with his little five-year-old girl
[47:13] because he was having a hard time
[47:15] studying and concentrating with his
[47:18] little girl
[47:19] and so he was in his study and in a map
[47:23] I want you to picture this and this is
[47:25] my title
[47:27] and he said the minister just got this
[47:30] idea he said you know I'm going to take
[47:31] the map off the wall it's been there too
[47:33] long
[47:34] and he said I'm going to tear it up in
[47:36] pieces I'm going to give it to my little
[47:38] girl
[47:39] and I'm going to tell her to go out to
[47:40] the table and put the world together
[47:45] and that'll keep her busy I can do my
[47:47] message
[47:50] and so he did that and he gave it to his
[47:52] little girl and then literally it just
[47:55] in a few moments
[47:57] the little girl come back in his office
[47:59] and said Daddy here you go
[48:01] I'm done
[48:03] and the minister was just stunned
[48:06] stunning
[48:09] said honey you don't know nothing about
[48:11] the world
[48:13] we don't know nothing about the world
[48:14] you know what's going on we don't have a
[48:16] clue our government hid it from us
[48:20] you know what's behind the scene
[48:25] she said you don't know nothing about
[48:26] geography how in the world did you put
[48:29] you together so quickly
[48:33] so perfectly
[48:35] she said what Daddy
[48:38] on the back of the map was a picture of
[48:40] Jesus
[48:44] now I realize
[48:45] that if I got Jesus in the right place
[48:48] my whole world
[48:50] will come in line
[48:56] that's where the minister got his title
[48:58] from putting Jesus in the right place
[49:03] if you get Jesus fixed in the right
[49:05] place
[49:06] your whole world
[49:07] will come together
[49:12] amen you don't need to tell us where
[49:14] you're living in the inner courts or the
[49:16] outer courts
[49:18] our actions
[49:20] and our fruits tell us
[49:23] very clearly
[49:26] and I know mine do to you too
[49:28] amen
[49:33] here in the hidden life the prophet said
[49:35] he said if we ever come to the place
[49:37] that we get our life
[49:39] in Christ and it means more to us
[49:42] than anything
[49:44] completely anything
[49:46] you need to sell something you sell it
[49:50] you need to not do something you don't
[49:51] do it
[49:56] uh-huh
[50:01] you get hit away and your whole motive
[50:03] and your whole agenda and everything you
[50:06] do in this life
[50:07] is to serve Jesus Christ
[50:11] you enter into a world into a place
[50:15] that God put you away
[50:16] amen
[50:18] God help us
[50:20] said in Romans 8 11 it said but this
[50:22] spirit in him that raised up Jesus from
[50:26] the dead dwell in you
[50:29] if you ever get that spear that was in
[50:32] Christ
[50:36] it'll also Quicken your mortal body
[50:40] amen
[50:42] but his Spirit must dwell in you now the
[50:45] prophet said some things about that
[50:47] let's just read some examples here of
[50:50] what he said in in thy house in a 61
[50:53] quote paragraph 84 he said
[50:56] as I said the other day he said when
[50:58] we're born
[50:59] again of the spirit of God
[51:02] he said God isn't weak in one place and
[51:06] strong in another
[51:07] he said if you got a shadow of God
[51:11] just a little speck of God
[51:15] I'm reading
[51:17] then you got all the power
[51:21] there is
[51:25] amen
[51:27] you got enough power to make a world
[51:33] and go out and live in it
[51:36] but of course thy power is controlled
[51:42] by your doubt
[51:44] by your faith
[51:48] and it see this faith is like this this
[51:51] is how you control it he said I'll never
[51:54] leave thee nor forsake thee
[51:57] all about well yeah I know he never did
[52:00] in the Bible but you know we're living
[52:03] you know
[52:07] the footsteps of the righteous man are
[52:10] ordered of the Lord oh yeah I know that
[52:12] but you know
[52:14] I thought this was
[52:16] so I went ahead
[52:19] uh-huh you know me and Mom were making
[52:21] some decisions this week and you know it
[52:24] don't have to be like super religious or
[52:26] some kind of like format you know
[52:29] you don't have to have a format on how
[52:31] you serve God
[52:33] you just gotta die
[52:35] and we were doing some business and me
[52:38] and the way I just sat there I said
[52:39] honey let's just say God
[52:42] just whatever we do just guide
[52:43] everything we do we don't know what
[52:45] we're doing we don't we don't know what
[52:46] our decision is but God we're gonna
[52:48] we're gonna call some people and
[52:50] whatever is supposed to fall together
[52:52] whatever it is
[52:54] we don't know who maybe what we don't
[52:56] know these people
[52:57] might be yes or no
[53:03] that was just that day
[53:06] but we should be like that every moment
[53:08] amen
[53:09] just whatever God
[53:12] your faith has to be like
[53:14] the same yesterday he's the same
[53:16] yesterday
[53:17] today
[53:18] and forever
[53:20] right
[53:22] it'd be like the prophet when he said
[53:23] one year from now to the widow woman
[53:26] you'll have a child
[53:28] that's why I can't say this morning that
[53:30] one year from now approximately
[53:32] one year give me Vicki we'll have babies
[53:35] in the rain
[53:37] amen it's no different God
[53:41] I'm not fearful to say that
[53:43] why would it be purple to say that
[53:45] you say whoa did God tell you that God
[53:49] promised me that Charles's kids are your
[53:51] heritage
[53:52] amen a happy is a man who's quiver is
[53:55] full of that Where'd I get that from the
[53:56] Bible
[53:59] maybe maybe this one will please you I
[54:02] know the thoughts that I have towards
[54:04] not to have kids oh no that's not in
[54:07] there
[54:10] I know that now by the way this is God
[54:12] talking in the Bible That's fairly good
[54:14] quote I know the thoughts that I have to
[54:16] you to prosper you
[54:20] and in health
[54:23] uh-huh
[54:24] right
[54:26] we say well yeah but you know I'm not
[54:28] going to prophesy because I'm not a
[54:29] prophet are you a part of the Bride
[54:33] are you part of the Bride
[54:36] the Bible says that you'll prophesy
[54:43] but because of our little faith
[54:46] and our fearing God
[54:49] or because we're not sold out to Christ
[54:51] then we're not in the holy of holies
[54:54] and we actually care if we lose this
[54:58] or this
[55:02] huh
[55:05] see we have an agenda
[55:08] Even in our own personal well God I
[55:10] don't want to really move now because
[55:11] you know
[55:12] pretty comfortable here
[55:17] but maybe God that was beautiful what
[55:19] the brother brought last Sunday you know
[55:20] he said he Elijah to the creek
[55:22] and he never said there will be a house
[55:23] a roof the Bible said I'll supply all
[55:26] your needs but he and he said I'll feed
[55:28] you with birds that eat on dead
[55:29] carcasses I win the win
[55:32] and you want me to tell you what you
[55:34] wouldn't have either
[55:36] you wouldn't either
[55:39] by where we're at
[55:41] now I'm sorry if I'm wrong but
[55:43] you know really
[55:45] like you would move out of your house
[55:47] to no house
[55:50] and you'd eat off the dead carcasses
[55:55] I'd have trouble with that
[55:58] but it was so beautiful other brother
[56:00] said just just take that out of this
[56:02] word
[56:03] so I know the thoughts that I have
[56:04] towards you do you think God thinks that
[56:07] the the the the the bride of Christ in a
[56:10] beautiful couple home that it's God's
[56:12] will that they would not be able to have
[56:14] children never
[56:15] that's a lie of the devil
[56:18] and the devil will give lots of
[56:20] evil homes and single mothers
[56:23] too many babies to raise them for the
[56:25] devil
[56:26] in control here
[56:30] you know you know who's making the most
[56:32] noise
[56:34] you know you're afraid to offend the
[56:36] construction worker on the job site to
[56:38] put on Amazing Grace or like you know
[56:40] some kind of beautiful song like Ben and
[56:43] Samantha singing
[56:45] but the you know when when Satan shows
[56:48] up on the job site and they're the
[56:49] drywallers and they put
[56:52] pornography rock and roll on they're not
[56:55] afraid of offending you
[56:57] how's that work
[57:01] now I'm not saying to just go around
[57:04] trying to offend people
[57:06] but you're afraid
[57:09] you're playing ashamed
[57:15] that's what the prophet said
[57:18] he said in one of these quotes I have in
[57:20] my iPad
[57:22] we back up
[57:24] man
[57:27] why can't we just we got something in
[57:29] our life it's a mountain we just say God
[57:31] remove it
[57:33] it's hindering My Worship to you get
[57:36] ready back
[57:39] because we don't
[57:40] it's controlled by your faith
[57:43] and that's an easy way to say that it's
[57:46] just your God is smaller than my God
[57:49] or than the actual God
[57:54] amen
[57:56] God help us
[57:58] and if it I'm finishing this it says the
[58:03] power is controlled by faith
[58:05] is God the same that's that's the
[58:07] Clincher right there and if it wasn't
[58:11] then we would if if this if creating a
[58:14] world wasn't controlled by your faith
[58:17] if it wasn't that's what the prophet
[58:19] saying then every one of us
[58:21] would have a world
[58:23] to go live on
[58:28] maybe that's why not everybody has the
[58:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:33] because the Bible says that no man came
[58:36] to the father
[58:40] they must first believe that he is
[58:45] Hallelujah we must first believe before
[58:49] I say Tim and Vicki will have children I
[58:51] must first believe that God is God
[58:55] period and that's where the trouble is
[59:01] with me
[59:03] and maybe others
[59:07] we must first believe that he is
[59:10] and without that we can't even please
[59:12] them
[59:16] wow
[59:18] he said if it wasn't for Faith every one
[59:19] of us would have a world and we would go
[59:21] live in it but
[59:24] this is our Prophet singing But if
[59:26] you're a son of God
[59:28] or a daughter of God I'm glad he put
[59:31] that in there you've got the power of
[59:35] God in you do you see
[59:39] now that's a direct quote
[59:43] do I really believe that and why if I
[59:46] believe it if brother Dale believes that
[59:47] then I got to walk out on this ice
[59:50] when the ice is melted
[59:58] put your faith in action
[1:00:01] that's what God's asking us to do
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] so then you got the law of Faith pulls
[1:00:09] everything
[1:00:12] amen here's the secret in it
[1:00:16] amen this is beautiful
[1:00:20] um I just find them here oh here we go
[1:00:23] ah there we go ah Hallelujah I'm gonna
[1:00:26] get to the secret and say brother Dale
[1:00:28] how can you do this
[1:00:31] next quote after this he said see we're
[1:00:34] here receiving the spirit of God
[1:00:38] the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost we're receiving the spirit of God
[1:00:42] and God made the world out of nothing
[1:00:47] remember the prophet said that a spoon
[1:00:48] of the ocean was the same as the ocean
[1:00:50] it was just more of it but the exact
[1:00:52] same ingredients
[1:00:53] he said now we comma after receiving the
[1:00:58] spirit of the god after receiving the
[1:00:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:01] about the spirit of God he said now God
[1:01:04] made the world out of nothing it's just
[1:01:06] his word
[1:01:08] but you're afraid for your word
[1:01:10] and you're probably afraid for my word
[1:01:12] but why
[1:01:17] he just created his world
[1:01:20] his word
[1:01:22] is creation
[1:01:24] so he just spoke it and the world was
[1:01:27] created because it was the object in
[1:01:31] God's mind
[1:01:32] in his heart
[1:01:34] he just spoke it and it come into
[1:01:37] existence he was
[1:01:39] creator
[1:01:40] and I said then if we we
[1:01:45] are you with me if we have Zoe
[1:01:50] God's life in US
[1:01:52] then we become Sons and Daughters of God
[1:01:56] and we're amateur creators
[1:02:02] and I said because he said
[1:02:05] whatsoever you thought I was off the
[1:02:07] word right
[1:02:08] but the prophet said whatsoever you say
[1:02:11] and believe
[1:02:15] that what you say
[1:02:20] period
[1:02:24] period that don't matter if it comes out
[1:02:26] of a sister's mouth or a child's mouth
[1:02:29] or a Brother's mouth if they have the
[1:02:32] spirit of God Zoe the God's own life
[1:02:35] dwelling in them then they have a
[1:02:37] spoonful of God
[1:02:43] so you hear this quote he said the
[1:02:46] secret is having God's spirit
[1:02:49] the secret is the token the secret is
[1:02:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:02:56] living below your privileges
[1:03:00] it's about time we start talking
[1:03:04] we're gonna have to go to the doctor or
[1:03:06] a doctor and my kids eight years old he
[1:03:09] don't even see Daddy yet
[1:03:15] how many years you got to got to leave
[1:03:17] us on Earth for the bride to start doing
[1:03:19] some talking
[1:03:22] well I am afraid
[1:03:24] I'll be a false prophet
[1:03:32] you don't have faith
[1:03:35] do you have a problem with faith
[1:03:38] so you actually have a problem with God
[1:03:42] because to have faith you must first
[1:03:45] love it
[1:03:47] ouch
[1:03:49] you must first believe that he is
[1:03:54] so our problem ain't with speaking our
[1:03:56] problem is with doubting
[1:04:02] to apply and create that atmosphere
[1:04:04] around you that they'll just drop right
[1:04:07] into it see he said oh you are if you
[1:04:10] now this exact quote he said if you got
[1:04:14] the token
[1:04:15] then you create a spirit
[1:04:21] a world
[1:04:24] around you
[1:04:27] now a spirit in an atmosphere is the
[1:04:30] same as the world
[1:04:32] and if you don't think so there's some
[1:04:35] people you don't want to be on their
[1:04:36] world
[1:04:38] because their atmosphere is toxic
[1:04:40] chemicals
[1:04:44] the prophet also give us one of those
[1:04:46] quotes
[1:04:48] and I like it I just put it on the
[1:04:50] bottom
[1:04:53] the token you create a spirit around you
[1:04:56] and a power that when you walk out
[1:04:59] people know that you're a Christian
[1:05:03] I don't know if it's all America
[1:05:15] he said they love you to say something
[1:05:17] to them
[1:05:19] the world would love you to say
[1:05:20] something
[1:05:23] amen and they believe your word
[1:05:27] the world to believe the world believed
[1:05:29] Jesus word before the church
[1:05:31] they believe your word and what you say
[1:05:33] and they'll hold on to it
[1:05:35] amen the secret is
[1:05:38] that seek it for this Authority
[1:05:40] is the token or the spirit of Christ or
[1:05:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or God's
[1:05:46] spirit or whatever you want
[1:05:49] amen
[1:05:51] how to create a world in Christ
[1:05:56] and go live it
[1:06:04] see Jesus said to the father in The
[1:06:07] Bible he said father I thank thee that
[1:06:09] you didn't remove them from the world
[1:06:13] but you let the evils of the world
[1:06:16] not touching
[1:06:19] the evil of the world
[1:06:25] I wonder if we're affected by the Eagles
[1:06:32] you know brother Brown said this 29
[1:06:34] times in the results of creating an
[1:06:36] atmosphere
[1:06:37] in a world he mentioned world and
[1:06:39] creating an atmosphere
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:42] changed your world around you he said
[1:06:45] you realize that if you're a son or
[1:06:46] daughter of God that you're an amateur
[1:06:49] creator
[1:06:54] you know
[1:06:55] I I tell you that's really I don't know
[1:06:58] if I did here's this comes to me it's a
[1:07:00] good story there was a brother in the
[1:07:03] states
[1:07:05] they get charged for murder did they
[1:07:06] tell you this
[1:07:08] how do you know you got to give me this
[1:07:10] message a long time
[1:07:11] there's a brother in the Saints I could
[1:07:14] charge for rape and murder
[1:07:15] and because of politics and it don't
[1:07:18] matter if the Republicans are the
[1:07:19] Democrats or anything
[1:07:21] for the conservatives are the liberal
[1:07:23] because of politics
[1:07:25] the outrage in the community were so
[1:07:28] great
[1:07:29] that the only thing the police wanted to
[1:07:31] do
[1:07:32] I mean the police were doing their fast
[1:07:33] I don't mean that wrong
[1:07:35] but they needed to find somebody
[1:07:37] to the public down we draw them
[1:07:41] he's behind Birds
[1:07:44] so they went and grabbed this black
[1:07:45] brother
[1:07:48] and grab them
[1:07:50] the church food
[1:07:54] he wasn't part of the Bride that I know
[1:07:58] I don't even know that he was a
[1:08:00] professing Christian
[1:08:05] and his government
[1:08:07] put them behind bars
[1:08:09] for
[1:08:10] 39 years
[1:08:15] you know how long that is
[1:08:17] that's longer than most in these cities
[1:08:21] 39 years ago
[1:08:24] and he was 100.
[1:08:27] seconds
[1:08:31] and he got out
[1:08:32] I'm a DNA
[1:08:35] and it released him
[1:08:39] and when that Story come out
[1:08:41] the news people asking
[1:08:44] how in the word
[1:08:48] did you keep this together
[1:08:52] for 39.
[1:09:02] just
[1:09:03] okay
[1:09:04] wrongfully
[1:09:09] a hundred percent
[1:09:12] nothing
[1:09:16] like absolutely he wasn't even ahead
[1:09:24] and he said they could lock up my
[1:09:28] a non-believer
[1:09:29] you know look at all the great things
[1:09:31] that the apostles did in the Old
[1:09:33] Testament and they never even had to
[1:09:34] overdose
[1:09:36] I worked right uh we're afraid to say ah
[1:09:40] they went into they went into the fiery
[1:09:43] furnace and then everyone smelt like
[1:09:44] smoke not only did that not get burned
[1:09:46] they didn't even smell like I tell you
[1:09:48] what me and mom went to the steam
[1:09:49] Thrashers yesterday
[1:09:51] it was really cool we went to a lot of
[1:09:53] antique stores where things I'd never
[1:09:55] seen like
[1:09:57] but the beans they were cooking on the
[1:09:59] thing
[1:10:00] they weren't in the fire
[1:10:02] they smelled like snow
[1:10:04] man you just put this one
[1:10:07] it's like wow
[1:10:09] and it was so strong this moment it felt
[1:10:12] like they literally put these in the
[1:10:15] baked beans
[1:10:16] I mean I like baked beans
[1:10:19] but like
[1:10:21] I don't smoke
[1:10:23] and they were flavored
[1:10:30] but he said they can lock up the spot
[1:10:33] that they can never
[1:10:40] you know you might you might live in
[1:10:42] Canada and you might you know you might
[1:10:43] whatever you might be working and you
[1:10:46] might deal with your world you could be
[1:10:48] losing money or making money or whatever
[1:10:51] it is
[1:10:53] you know we went through a ridiculous
[1:10:55] part of you know the world and
[1:11:00] they might lock us up
[1:11:02] they can't lock up
[1:11:05] does this ain't me
[1:11:07] if a if a straight
[1:11:10] non-believer can say that
[1:11:13] uh-huh a straight like like not even a
[1:11:16] denominational Christian
[1:11:19] he said they locked up my body
[1:11:21] but in my mind I
[1:11:27] I was powerful
[1:11:32] could you be locked up 39 years
[1:11:35] and come out
[1:11:44] can you even come out and have it
[1:11:45] together
[1:11:53] it shows
[1:11:55] that we have to get into a different
[1:11:56] life
[1:11:58] we have to create a world to God that
[1:12:00] this world is not my home
[1:12:03] I'm a gist of visiting here and the
[1:12:06] holiday has been too long
[1:12:10] you can shorten this holiday any day the
[1:12:12] motel bills are out of the world
[1:12:15] you get the picture
[1:12:21] well we're pretty comfortable
[1:12:24] we're not excited for God for shorten
[1:12:26] your beef
[1:12:28] why because you know I read I read what
[1:12:31] the
[1:12:32] quote in the prophet when he called his
[1:12:34] wife back when she was done
[1:12:39] and it would it you know I I've read
[1:12:41] that just
[1:12:43] many many many
[1:12:46] but I read it
[1:12:48] you know differently or something
[1:12:51] and she said
[1:12:53] you know see you like life
[1:13:00] and here she was a young mother
[1:13:02] even her little tiny Sunday
[1:13:06] and Bill called her back
[1:13:10] she said oh
[1:13:16] wow
[1:13:18] let me just tell you what she said she
[1:13:20] said I was crossing
[1:13:23] and there was somebody in a white guy
[1:13:26] and they were walking me down and there
[1:13:28] was beautiful trees and the wind was
[1:13:29] blowing
[1:13:31] and the birds were singing
[1:13:34] she was walking
[1:13:38] and she's looking right at the love of
[1:13:40] her life for him
[1:13:42] in her 20s
[1:13:50] what are you doing and she told the pop
[1:13:54] I know you know this but I'm going to
[1:13:55] tell you again
[1:13:57] she said you preached it
[1:14:00] you don't
[1:14:03] or you preach it you don't understand
[1:14:06] I don't I or you preaching and you don't
[1:14:08] realize it
[1:14:10] it was all the same like I'm I'm not
[1:14:13] reading it
[1:14:15] basically the prophet was preaching how
[1:14:17] great Heaven is but he didn't believe it
[1:14:21] and we say with our mouth really cheap
[1:14:23] things like how great our God is and we
[1:14:25] have the best thing in the world
[1:14:26] but we don't speak nothing
[1:14:28] because we don't believe
[1:14:35] we don't speak those problems nobody
[1:14:38] if we don't say you know this
[1:14:41] we think God's
[1:14:44] it's God's will that we're in this fact
[1:14:51] I know the thoughts that I have to put
[1:14:53] you
[1:14:54] it wasn't right
[1:14:57] what are you gonna do that's good well I
[1:14:59] don't want to read that scripture
[1:15:01] I just believe in Trump
[1:15:09] Billy's wife said this
[1:15:12] she said honey
[1:15:15] I'm sorry to leave you
[1:15:21] she said
[1:15:23] and just doing it from memory I'm just
[1:15:25] but she said please let me go it was the
[1:15:28] most wonderful
[1:15:36] just married
[1:15:38] with the first little man
[1:15:40] in her 20s madly in love
[1:15:46] see we don't believe
[1:15:50] if I die and I am here next Sunday
[1:15:51] you'll cry maybe maybe some of you'll
[1:15:53] Rejoice but most of us you know
[1:15:56] if one of our children something I'd try
[1:16:00] but
[1:16:03] please let me go
[1:16:08] you preaching
[1:16:10] but you know
[1:16:16] here's another one in 63.
[1:16:18] oh six he said you know did you know
[1:16:21] that you're a little Creator yourself
[1:16:23] did you know that certainly you are
[1:16:26] and he said and you've seen people that
[1:16:28] are just loved to be around
[1:16:31] creating a world and go live on it
[1:16:34] but let me just jump down he said
[1:16:36] and they and he said but you've seen the
[1:16:39] kind
[1:16:40] that you don't like to be around
[1:16:44] now this is our Prophet saying this we
[1:16:47] didn't think we had permission to save
[1:16:49] us
[1:16:49] but sister Patty there's people that me
[1:16:52] and you don't like to be around
[1:16:54] I mean and everybody else well we didn't
[1:16:56] know we had
[1:16:58] the prophet says it
[1:17:00] it's for you
[1:17:03] he said that's because they create an
[1:17:05] atmosphere but the life they lived and
[1:17:07] the way they talk and their conversation
[1:17:11] amen he says in here in some of the
[1:17:13] quotes
[1:17:18] these birds with feathers blocked
[1:17:19] together have you seen ministers hang
[1:17:22] around people and all they talk about is
[1:17:25] Million Dollar bank accounts
[1:17:27] a million dollar cars and they'll give
[1:17:29] nothing to Africa or the Philippines or
[1:17:32] missions or
[1:17:33] and the ministers come by you know let
[1:17:35] me I tell you something
[1:17:42] I had somebody call me from Africa
[1:17:45] and they asked me to buy his plane
[1:17:46] ticket to go preach in another church
[1:17:53] I'm like hello
[1:17:55] we said that Minister on it
[1:17:57] he said but that Minister I'm preaching
[1:17:59] for he only offered me five hundred
[1:18:00] dollars
[1:18:04] I'm like
[1:18:06] what do you think
[1:18:07] like
[1:18:10] I said well if you preach for us we'll
[1:18:12] certainly give you a love gift or if I
[1:18:14] invited you I would take care of your
[1:18:15] costs
[1:18:17] did you know there was Ministries or
[1:18:19] something that don't do that
[1:18:24] in Canada
[1:18:28] would you like me to tell you how much
[1:18:29] he asked me for 1 000 U.S
[1:18:33] he said I got 1500 so far would you just
[1:18:35] give me a like
[1:18:38] like my tree's dying I've been picking
[1:18:40] it so off
[1:18:46] I'm like
[1:18:48] or if you see a minute you see what I
[1:18:50] mean birds with feathers fly together
[1:18:53] if you throw parties all the time
[1:18:55] and you don't want nothing to do with
[1:18:57] God or party or you don't want no
[1:18:59] man you know when we took the minister
[1:19:02] back last Sunday
[1:19:04] we didn't know how it was all falling
[1:19:06] together we we operate about an hour
[1:19:08] behind time and and I needed to
[1:19:12] it was just the way it worked out I
[1:19:13] needed to sell cattle on Tuesday so
[1:19:17] how we got we took the minister to the
[1:19:20] next place
[1:19:21] on Monday
[1:19:23] and we went somewhere and they were
[1:19:24] having a picnic
[1:19:28] just Believers and Believers that
[1:19:30] invited lots of people there was lots of
[1:19:33] girls that were invited
[1:19:35] you know that you could tell weren't
[1:19:37] believed
[1:19:39] it was like 200 some people there
[1:19:42] I'm like
[1:19:43] oh
[1:19:45] man if I threw a picnic
[1:19:50] would you come
[1:19:52] don't answer that but it's like do you
[1:19:55] like being together
[1:19:57] or are you like just brother Bernard's
[1:20:00] children you know the man went up there
[1:20:02] and I had a couple I had the mechanic
[1:20:04] working on my tractors and thought and a
[1:20:06] little man
[1:20:08] see that their reasons
[1:20:12] and they were looking around my wife for
[1:20:14] brother Dale are you like that
[1:20:20] do you look around to see if the whole
[1:20:22] family comes
[1:20:27] maybe it's because you're not in the
[1:20:30] maybe you're in the other courts
[1:20:34] because see those worldly friends
[1:20:36] they'll never be in the holy holies
[1:20:38] unless God Guru
[1:20:44] Maybe
[1:20:46] the atmosphere is what he says he says
[1:20:48] now you've seen those people not this by
[1:20:51] the way this is the prophet talk
[1:20:55] he said you've seen those people that
[1:20:57] every time
[1:20:58] you send them
[1:21:00] we're not are we supposed to something
[1:21:03] well may the Bible Well the Bible says
[1:21:05] that some Mark does that
[1:21:07] cause problems
[1:21:10] he says all the time
[1:21:12] they want to talk about something
[1:21:16] evil
[1:21:18] oh
[1:21:19] it's okay to send them people
[1:21:21] and they talk about
[1:21:24] somebody
[1:21:26] brother there
[1:21:28] somebody say oh my there they come
[1:21:33] and they're such a Critic
[1:21:36] critical critical of somebody there
[1:21:39] and he's in here now and he's going to
[1:21:42] talk about this brother
[1:21:47] and he said you just hate to get around
[1:21:49] them see
[1:21:51] because they create seemingly
[1:21:54] they're seemingly pretty nice people
[1:21:57] but they create an evil
[1:22:14] and the things that you think on and the
[1:22:16] things that you do and the actions and
[1:22:19] the things you talk about
[1:22:21] creates
[1:22:25] and the things that you think on
[1:22:28] and the things that you do
[1:22:33] and the actions and the things that you
[1:22:36] talk about
[1:22:38] creates
[1:22:42] your word
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:51] God help us
[1:22:54] man
[1:23:04] here he says when your sons and
[1:23:06] daughters of God the atmosphere and even
[1:23:08] the air that you live in is created a
[1:23:12] situation around you that either draws
[1:23:14] in
[1:23:15] or pushes
[1:23:17] away
[1:23:22] Hallelujah
[1:23:27] 29 times
[1:23:29] the atmosphere
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:38] John 17 9 and we're going to close with
[1:23:41] this
[1:23:43] 17-9 and then we're gonna jump to 14. he
[1:23:45] said I pray for them I pray not for the
[1:23:48] world
[1:23:50] but for them which has given me
[1:23:53] for they are mine
[1:23:54] and let's jump to verse 14.
[1:23:57] for I have given them
[1:23:59] Thy word he's talking about God
[1:24:02] and the world hated them because they
[1:24:05] are not of the world even as I am not of
[1:24:08] the world
[1:24:10] here's Jesus
[1:24:13] making you
[1:24:14] is co-equal
[1:24:17] now watch this watch this
[1:24:19] but do you see all ministers do that
[1:24:22] you don't have to answer that
[1:24:26] here's the king of glory
[1:24:29] making you co-equal
[1:24:43] and the world hated them because they
[1:24:45] are not of the world even as I am not of
[1:24:47] the world and I pray not for that thou
[1:24:50] shalt take them out of the world we're
[1:24:53] we're born to live
[1:24:55] right here
[1:24:57] in Wyoming
[1:24:58] but how are we doing
[1:25:03] How We Do let me tell you some stories
[1:25:05] not food
[1:25:07] you know the people on this road
[1:25:10] are watching me
[1:25:14] you know when me and Luanne came to one
[1:25:15] Wednesday night
[1:25:16] they were out here in the thing and the
[1:25:18] guy literally almost run and got a rate
[1:25:21] and leveled the gravel and put it up by
[1:25:24] the cement and pulled the mud down and
[1:25:25] that stuff up I was mowing the grass on
[1:25:28] it on a day I think it was a Wednesday
[1:25:30] they said and I can buy and I'd mowed
[1:25:34] the back grass and I'm coming up the
[1:25:35] side and there was a guy sitting on
[1:25:37] Dozer right here and there was a guy
[1:25:38] talking to him now they're plain working
[1:25:42] they're not bothering me I had the mower
[1:25:44] set like like blades off
[1:25:46] I'm driving by and I could tell the guys
[1:25:49] like
[1:25:53] that's why I shut the mower off
[1:25:55] he says
[1:25:57] I see you have a service
[1:26:04] they was inside
[1:26:07] that they would disturb us
[1:26:10] on a Wednesday night
[1:26:16] are you concerned
[1:26:19] they're not believing
[1:26:27] I told them I said listen
[1:26:30] I said many of our people drive far
[1:26:34] many of them worked in construction or
[1:26:35] afternoon
[1:26:37] I said it would be a very light crowd to
[1:26:39] me
[1:26:40] but I said you know this next Sunday
[1:26:42] which was last Sunday I said we're going
[1:26:44] to have joint fellowship and there'll be
[1:26:45] a lot of people here because there'll be
[1:26:47] people here
[1:26:48] and he said we'll have it tied you down
[1:26:57] nothing
[1:26:58] around
[1:27:01] they can
[1:27:05] do we
[1:27:07] do you care about them
[1:27:12] you know what the Bible says this is
[1:27:14] Christianity
[1:27:17] to build visit the widows
[1:27:20] and Europeans
[1:27:23] somebody's one visited John Black
[1:27:26] I'm gonna go see Stephen
[1:27:30] was the last time you weren't seeing
[1:27:31] system
[1:27:36] s
[1:27:43] I pray that thou shall not take them out
[1:27:45] of the world
[1:27:48] but that thou shall keep them
[1:27:50] from the evil
[1:27:52] and the day or night of this world
[1:27:55] I love when Jesus makes
[1:27:59] they're not of the world
[1:28:01] even as I
[1:28:03] am the same as him
[1:28:09] if we fix Jesus
[1:28:13] in the right place
[1:28:16] our whole world
[1:28:18] we come together
[1:28:32] there's many things that we do
[1:28:34] that are not wrong
[1:28:36] not even
[1:28:38] but if they hinder us
[1:28:43] between our walking cross then that
[1:28:46] makes them even
[1:28:47] amen like like for example
[1:28:51] just for example
[1:28:53] it's not evil
[1:28:54] and I actually believe in it
[1:28:56] if it's possible
[1:28:58] it's not evil for parents to leave
[1:29:00] something for their kids
[1:29:02] 50 cents or a dollar when they're you
[1:29:05] know after the funeral Bill's paid so
[1:29:07] they could go and buy a Pepsi or
[1:29:09] something
[1:29:10] but if that hinders you
[1:29:12] from showing them Christ
[1:29:15] and that's evil
[1:29:18] there's many things in our life that
[1:29:20] aren't evil working ain't neither
[1:29:22] or living life or having fun it's not
[1:29:25] evil it's all partner
[1:29:30] but if it hinders us
[1:29:32] in Christ if Christ wouldn't be welcomed
[1:29:35] there
[1:29:37] you
[1:29:41] remember
[1:29:42] if you're a believer
[1:29:44] Christ goes everywhere you go
[1:29:48] unless he's not welcome
[1:29:52] our Prophet clearly said
[1:29:54] he said if you were to go into some
[1:29:55] places
[1:29:57] the dove
[1:29:59] but wait okay
[1:30:04] I wonder if we say well you know
[1:30:07] just this
[1:30:09] man I mean
[1:30:11] the Holy Spirit loves
[1:30:13] family time and like I've seen pictures
[1:30:16] Jared and Julie were canoeing and it was
[1:30:19] amazing
[1:30:21] that's amazing that's life
[1:30:23] God's a family he's a family man you're
[1:30:26] part of this family that's amazing that
[1:30:29] that's done we're not talking that you
[1:30:31] just got to be in church seven days a
[1:30:32] week no no no
[1:30:34] no but would Christ be welcome
[1:30:38] it's Christ welcome in the community
[1:30:40] he can be
[1:30:41] for that he loves canoeman
[1:30:44] he made it
[1:30:48] amen God help me
[1:30:50] we get Jesus in the right place
[1:30:53] let's sing that song we're saying to
[1:30:55] begin Lord my heart can grow sometimes
[1:30:57] we can just forget about Christ
[1:30:59] sometimes brother Dale
[1:31:02] is living in the outer carts
[1:31:04] it's rained a lot this July
[1:31:09] or sometimes we're in the inner cogs
[1:31:13] I woke up the other night and the Hydra
[1:31:15] was out
[1:31:22] but how often do we get into
[1:31:25] just you and him
[1:31:28] just you and him
[1:31:30] there'll be other people there
[1:31:32] but your only focus is just
[1:31:34] me in Christ
[1:31:36] you won't be worried about what Putin's
[1:31:38] doing you won't be worried about Kim's
[1:31:40] doing in North Korea
[1:31:41] you won't be worried about the hilarious
[1:31:44] joke of politics
[1:31:47] you won't be worried about the next
[1:31:48] plague or the next
[1:31:50] dollar or the next digital or
[1:31:52] you won't be worried about none of that
[1:32:00] I think brother Dale worries more about
[1:32:02] this world
[1:32:05] than the world I say is better
[1:32:09] I think there's a lot of company where
[1:32:10] I'm living
[1:32:13] God wants us to change amen God wants us
[1:32:16] to you know
[1:32:18] we can we can be farmers and mechanics
[1:32:21] and whatever we are
[1:32:24] but we need to just keep him
[1:32:28] okay
[1:32:30] we need to keep them our code
[1:32:32] Jesus
[1:32:34] it's amazing you know when the prophet
[1:32:37] said when you get that
[1:32:39] they won't be
[1:32:41] the people that you think Were Heroes
[1:32:43] will look at you and they'll say how in
[1:32:46] the world the three Hebrew children
[1:32:48] they'll look at you and they'll go wow
[1:32:51] you survived
[1:32:53] the age of advertisements
[1:32:56] and internet
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:14] and yet for me
[1:33:27] when I make my name is
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:34:00] thank you
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:40] see our life
[1:34:48] many years ago
[1:34:50] me and Mom work we went were in a big
[1:34:55] grocery store inside
[1:34:57] and one of us got out
[1:35:01] and the wind kind of caught our door one
[1:35:03] of our doors
[1:35:05] and we smashed the car
[1:35:08] race I mean we one of us they really
[1:35:15] now we're fairly old
[1:35:21] and we looked the situation over
[1:35:24] there
[1:35:29] I said well
[1:35:32] and the other one was just taking a
[1:35:35] slice off the airplane
[1:35:37] how can you ever do this
[1:35:43] I said well we must go buy our hot dogs
[1:35:49] hot dogs
[1:35:51] we can back up
[1:35:54] boy
[1:35:57] to say that they weren't enough
[1:36:01] one hundreds
[1:36:09] so now listen
[1:36:12] we
[1:36:13] did something very bad
[1:36:16] here's our business card here's our
[1:36:19] phone number
[1:36:21] here's some places we work for Bodywork
[1:36:24] you can take down wherever you want
[1:36:29] we will pay 100 of them
[1:36:32] thank you
[1:36:40] now they were very heated up
[1:36:44] when we come up
[1:36:48] I would any of us
[1:36:52] but when they got my business card and
[1:36:55] you know they kind of knew where we
[1:36:57] lived and the muscle picture that I
[1:37:01] would truly you know they had our
[1:37:03] license plate they
[1:37:05] idea
[1:37:12] you know they never ever
[1:37:16] called us
[1:37:23] what have I done
[1:37:27] never ever helped I left in my car I
[1:37:29] didn't know their number they had my
[1:37:31] license plate they had the downloaded
[1:37:34] they had my business
[1:37:38] I was willing to pay and I was guilty or
[1:37:41] we were guilty
[1:37:44] what am I super guilty and oh man it was
[1:37:48] good real
[1:37:54] but now we're the bride
[1:37:59] and that card's Our God
[1:38:02] maybe
[1:38:04] see how we live
[1:38:07] you're gonna pay
[1:38:12] and here's non-believers
[1:38:16] they had the right
[1:38:24] sometimes our kids do things or
[1:38:27] neighbors or different things I mean
[1:38:29] things happen people ride a bike by your
[1:38:32] car and you just
[1:38:47] but in 10 years
[1:38:54] I've seen a Cadillac the other day
[1:39:01] just to
[1:39:02] just
[1:39:05] God has a way of checking where you're
[1:39:08] living
[1:39:10] what what God's doing is he's trying
[1:39:12] your test
[1:39:14] and he's seeing who's you got
[1:39:20] and sometimes the people working on the
[1:39:22] road show us
[1:39:25] or the people in the big grocery store
[1:39:29] you know the Bible says that uh
[1:39:40] listen we're guilty
