[34:43] jesus christ and of all the things
[34:46] that he saw
[34:49] blessed is he that readeth and he that
[34:51] heareth the words of these prophecies

[35:25] and not only this but when
[35:27] rebecca also had conceived by one even
[35:31] by our father isaac
[35:34] this is what we've this is our kind of
[35:36] our text for the children not even being
[35:40] born yet
[35:41] neither having done any good or evil
[35:44] that the purpose of god according to
[35:46] election
[35:48] might stand
[35:50] not of works
[35:52] but of him that calleth
[35:54] hallelujah
[35:56] and it is said unto her that the elder
[35:58] shall serve the younger
[36:01] and it is written jacob have i loved
[36:06] but esau have i hated lord we ask you to
[36:09] bless this
[36:10] word and may you anoint your word and
[36:12] bless your people this morning as we
[36:14] fellowship around you this morning lord
[36:16] jesus in your name
[36:18] amen you may have your seats please
[36:20] leave that up vicky for a second and
[36:22] just on a side note just uh not we're
[36:24] not preaching about this at all but i
[36:26] haven't changed my opinion of how close
[36:28] the rapture is
[36:29] i seen uh i actually shared back to
[36:31] myself
[36:32] i've seen a video on uh
[36:36] foreign news
[36:38] that they expect a world collapse of the
[36:41] economy
[36:42] they were talking about how
[36:45] broke the world is
[36:47] i believe they said that there was 73
[36:50] countries
[36:51] that are second-class countries that
[36:54] won't be able to make their debt
[36:55] payments
[36:56] this year
[36:58] some of them have already completely
[37:01] shut down
[37:03] and if you'll notice yesterday
[37:06] the stock markets on four of the biggest
[37:10] stocks in the world
[37:13] fell about one-third
[37:15] amazon
[37:17] fell 31
[37:19] in one day
[37:21] that ought to be worth a few billion
[37:23] dollars
[37:26] tesla
[37:27] fell 28
[37:29] in one day
[37:32] amen there was four other ones i don't
[37:34] remember them all so
[37:38] amen
[37:40] amen i want to show you something here
[37:41] and and talking about you are living in
[37:44] god's vision and i want to make it
[37:47] personal to you and i want to really
[37:49] make it personal i want to just show you
[37:51] see here it says here
[37:53] that god this is god himself talk and he
[37:56] said jacob have i love
[37:58] but esau have i hated and i want to show
[38:00] you a paraphrase because satan works
[38:03] through
[38:06] people
[38:10] isaac was a prophet
[38:14] and isaac loved esau
[38:19] so if you've got a brother or sister or
[38:21] even a minister or even the top 10
[38:24] they think there's a problem with you
[38:28] isaac loved esau and god hated him
[38:32] before he was even born
[38:36] uh-huh
[38:38] i just knocked my socks off
[38:41] here's god's prophet and he never even
[38:43] had it right
[38:46] right wow
[38:48] amen and here we see that it had nothing
[38:50] to do with us and i want to
[38:52] show you that in the vision of god see
[38:54] god seen us
[38:56] before the foundation of the world and
[38:57] what made here what made jacob the god
[39:01] love jacob i want to tell you this
[39:02] morning that you're in

[39:27] so how can you be that clear i have two
[39:30] bible backups to back that up
[39:34] why did god say i love jacob
[39:38] and esau have i hated well if you turned
[39:40] over to genesis 25 and maybe we'll go
[39:43] there genesis uh 25 29 we will see and
[39:47] i'll just paraphrase it before you you
[39:49] can go there genesis 25 29-34
[39:53] esa
[39:54] never had respects
[39:57] for the birthright
[40:00] you wouldn't be here this morning
[40:02] if you didn't have respects
[40:04] for the birthright
[40:06] see how i said you're in god's vision
[40:09] you are totally in god's vision i can
[40:12] see that you're in god's vision because
[40:14] you have respects to god's vision and i
[40:18] want to show you something else and this
[40:19] just you know when god gives me
[40:21] something you know it's not because it
[40:22] just came like a flood you know my
[40:24] planter broke on friday i went in the
[40:26] house for one hour and had enough
[40:28] messages for a month
[40:30] it was just like
[40:32] god spilled the milk
[40:34] literally
[40:35] watch this you say how could i be in
[40:37] god's vision when paul was on the road
[40:40] to damascus
[40:42] and god struck him down with the bright
[40:43] light
[40:45] watch this now and god and
[40:47] and paul said lord who are you
[40:52] now before we go any farther with the
[40:54] scripture i want to say
[40:55] was jesus on the earth at that time
[41:00] i'll answer that for you he was not
[41:03] [Music]
[41:04] paul was called after jesus
[41:07] had been raptured back to glory
[41:10] and paul asked the lord he said lord who
[41:14] are you
[41:20] and he said i am jesus
[41:23] whom you
[41:25] persecute and if you read two or three
[41:28] verses ahead of that
[41:30] he was persecuting the disciples and the
[41:33] believers
[41:34] and he had actually went to the chief
[41:36] governors
[41:37] to get permission to do that
[41:41] so
[41:41] are you in god's vision
[41:45] you are
[41:47] she
[41:50] i don't think you're fully getting it
[41:53] god
[41:54] god almighty you know the bible says
[41:56] that god is a spirit
[42:00] let me i i better rephrase god is a
[42:03] spirit
[42:04] and those that worship him must worship
[42:07] him in spirit
[42:10] and truth
[42:18] god himself said
[42:22] in the word of god
[42:24] that you this morning
[42:27] are just as much jesus as jesus was
[42:31] jesus
[42:35] hello
[42:39] it wasn't a preacher that said i am
[42:42] jesus whom you persecute jesus was not
[42:45] on the earth
[42:46] for all the jesus only people or the
[42:48] people that want to love his flesh maybe
[42:50] you better start loving me
[42:54] and you
[42:56] and the believers and the disciples
[42:58] because god said i am jesus that's a
[43:01] pretty open door
[43:05] whom you persecute
[43:11] that came straight from god
[43:15] now let me just
[43:16] the bible says
[43:18] that jesus was born
[43:20] for a purpose
[43:22] for a vision for a purpose that god was
[43:24] going to do now but you're jesus
[43:29] god said you were jesus
[43:34] man
[43:35] living in the vision
[43:37] totally born
[43:39] totally born for a purpose
[43:41] let me show you something the prophet
[43:43] said the greatest thing
[43:45] that the devil is against today the
[43:47] greatest thing just one thing he's not
[43:49] against you and he's not against me not
[43:51] the greatest
[43:52] the greatest
[43:54] the greatest thing that satan's against
[43:56] please get this the greatest thing
[44:00] is your belief
[44:02] that you're jesus
[44:05] whoa
[44:07] the greatest thing the only he's not
[44:09] against this church he's not against us
[44:11] gathering he's not against us having
[44:13] hamburgers on the fire
[44:15] he's against you believing
[44:18] this is how the prophet said your
[44:20] revelation
[44:21] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[44:24] but he is today
[44:25] and jesus had came to earth and was gone
[44:29] was gone was gone and god said jesus is
[44:33] here
[44:40] wow
[44:42] when i saw that i just about did a
[44:49] he said cain did an offering at the
[44:50] altar
[44:51] and he belonged to the church
[44:53] denomination kneeled the altar he paid
[44:55] worship god pays his tithing and all
[44:57] that and he said if god required it if
[44:59] that's all god required
[45:02] god would be duty bound to accept king's
[45:04] sacrifice but you see the whole secret
[45:06] is a revelation and revelation is your
[45:09] belief
[45:11] revelation is belief
[45:12] you can't have faith without revelation
[45:15] you can't believe god's god you've got
[45:17] to start believing in yourself boys and
[45:19] girls like brothers and sisters it's
[45:21] just straightforward when you study this
[45:24] out man if you realize that you could
[45:26] say to this mountain mountain i don't
[45:28] like you there
[45:29] step aside
[45:37] he said if god required uh sorry he said
[45:40] the whole secret was revelation and he
[45:42] said this is there's where the trouble
[45:44] is the people don't understand the whole
[45:46] church of the living god is built upon
[45:48] spiritual revelation of jesus christ
[45:54] who did god say christ jesus was
[45:58] but you say well you know i know who my
[46:00] daddy is and prophet's poorly received
[46:03] in your own land you don't even believe
[46:04] in yourself
[46:06] well you know i went to work yesterday
[46:09] you know david david when he was
[46:12] watching his dad's sheet
[46:15] david was living in god's vision when
[46:18] david was killing the lions god was
[46:21] practicing them up
[46:23] to kill a goliath
[46:25] the prophet said that we're in we're in
[46:27] child training he was physically living
[46:30] in god's vision every single day go to
[46:34] the bar to feed the cattle boys
[46:37] it's totally living in the vision
[46:39] totally because when when his dad said
[46:42] back at lunch i packed a lunch a month
[46:45] back to lunch and take it to your
[46:46] brothers
[46:48] you say well i was just a little boy
[46:50] packing lunch god don't care about
[46:51] little boys oh you're so naive and
[46:55] that packed lunch
[46:57] was the deliverance for israel in that
[47:00] time
[47:01] they couldn't have got delivered without
[47:03] a packed lunch
[47:04] because everybody else never had a spine
[47:07] they never actually had revelation and
[47:10] they were scared to death of life
[47:11] because see they didn't think they were
[47:13] jesus and if they don't believe they
[47:15] were jesus well then they're not jesus
[47:17] because faith without belief i mean
[47:20] you're saved by faith it's revelation
[47:23] and so the pack lunch the packed lunch
[47:27] was living in god's vision
[47:31] he just parked the lines of pocket
[47:34] lights and you're just parking lunches
[47:36] going to school work you're just packing
[47:38] a lunch and you're not you're not
[47:39] looking to the right nor the left and
[47:41] you've got and god's just walking you
[47:43] right into almighty glory
[47:45] and he's just packing a lunch he's like
[47:47] his brother's accused of him having a
[47:49] big agenda and all that
[47:51] david was just packing a lunch
[47:55] but he heard the enemy
[47:58] and he had something that nobody else in
[48:01] israel had at that time he had something
[48:05] that no other man in israel had
[48:08] and it wasn't muscle and it wasn't
[48:10] intelligence and it wasn't because he
[48:13] growed up and matured
[48:16] he just simply had revelation that who
[48:20] is this uncircumcised
[48:23] fake
[48:26] philistine
[48:30] and all the fightful
[48:32] ministry and all the believers in the
[48:35] church
[48:36] never had that revelation
[48:43] church it just blew my mind
[48:47] our prophet said the prophets are born
[48:49] prophets you know people will say i want
[48:51] to pray to the guys of abraham isaac and
[48:54] jacob
[48:56] abraham isaac and jacob and isaac
[48:59] believed exact opposite of god
[49:02] think about that
[49:05] when you want to go do something for god
[49:08] and find preachers tell you you're off
[49:09] the word
[49:11] just think of isaac
[49:14] just think of jacob he was a rotten kid
[49:17] he was i mean he needed um
[49:22] the five hands of grace praise the lord
[49:25] my dad's big hand
[49:28] he was a snot-nosed sniveling
[49:31] sissified lazy
[49:33] lion
[49:34] cheating deceitful
[49:37] rotten
[49:38] rotten rotten kid
[49:44] careful
[49:47] you might have had somebody tell you
[49:48] that you're a deceit lion
[49:51] done terrible terrible and god said
[49:56] i love jacob i just love jacob
[50:02] let that sink in for a minute
[50:04] he he he didn't just lie he premeditated
[50:07] lies
[50:08] i mean he he thought about him i'm lying
[50:11] intentionally tomorrow
[50:16] i mean serious prenet
[50:23] and god loved
[50:25] and the honest upright
[50:28] blessed
[50:30] turned around caller with a nice hairdo
[50:32] preacher
[50:34] isaac
[50:37] that just was a
[50:38] man and did his
[50:41] hunting and worked hard with his hands
[50:44] and provided for the family and did all
[50:47] these wonderful things
[50:50] and isaac loved him
[50:53] god said before he was born i hated that
[50:55] kid
[51:02] wow
[51:06] let me tell you something i'm going to
[51:07] shock you
[51:09] if god shows you something
[51:12] don't lean too heavy
[51:14] on the minister
[51:16] that tells you the opposite
[51:25] isaac
[51:26] you want an example isaac
[51:30] isaac
[51:35] before they were born
[51:38] god loved jacob
[51:40] election
[51:41] before you were born
[51:44] god loved every one of you here today
[51:48] and many are the ones that would be here
[51:50] that are out
[51:52] and the reason being
[51:54] is you show respect
[51:57] to his holy spirit
[52:01] respects
[52:03] i never even said you had it which i
[52:06] believe you do
[52:07] but in this case it wasn't given yet it
[52:09] just showed respects
[52:17] living
[52:19] living god's a paradox
[52:22] and you might think you've went too far
[52:24] your kids are something that they could
[52:27] be packing the lunch
[52:30] they could be packing the lunch that
[52:32] will deliver all of ontario
[52:34] it could be packing the lunch that could
[52:36] deliver all your family
[52:38] it could be packing a lunch it could
[52:40] deliver all the church
[52:43] it could be packing a lunch that takes
[52:44] us in a rapture pack in a lunch
[52:51] packing lunch
[52:53] i want to show you something there
[52:54] wasn't one spec
[52:56] a premeditated
[52:58] agenda in david
[53:01] packing a lunch
[53:03] he just was woke up
[53:05] and he was just doing what he did every
[53:08] day
[53:10] listening to his dad watching some sheep
[53:12] killing a few lions once in a while
[53:14] just for sport
[53:15] and packing the lunch
[53:24] it ain't one speck different watches
[53:27] the greatest
[53:29] tactic i've seen
[53:31] maybe i didn't finish this
[53:33] was the the the revelation
[53:36] of jesus christ
[53:38] jesus said in matthew blessed are you
[53:39] simon barjona for flesh and blood did
[53:41] not reveal this unto you spiritual
[53:44] revelation of jesus christ
[53:47] and god said you were jesus
[53:51] that's what he said
[53:54] the word in the beginning was the word
[53:56] and the word was with god and the word
[53:58] is flesh today
[54:01] jesus
[54:03] that that's that's just unbelievable
[54:08] and when we realize that you'll be like
[54:11] walking on the back of the pews and
[54:13] swirling and just
[54:15] you'll be stone drunk stone drunk
[54:21] he said when the word comes to you
[54:23] oh
[54:24] amber great glamour and they're riches
[54:27] and they don't need nothing and their
[54:28] money and all their things that they
[54:30] have
[54:31] and they don't know it but they're
[54:32] miserable
[54:34] blind wretched
[54:35] and naked
[54:36] and they're powdering this
[54:39] and they're patting you on the shoulders
[54:41] and want you to compromise
[54:43] with them
[54:45] all the churches
[54:47] churches that'll want you to compromise
[54:49] you see this even in the day we lived
[54:51] with this that's going around and
[54:54] behind us the last two years
[54:59] and here's the prophet saying about
[55:00] himself he said i was born for a purpose
[55:04] and that was to condemn it
[55:07] and call it out
[55:09] and this is what i'm doing
[55:12] whoa
[55:16] wasn't always flowery for him
[55:20] because there near the end
[55:22] he almost had no place to preach
[55:28] see
[55:34] like the quote we read there earlier
[55:36] jeffersonville
[55:38] he said it's got a he he gave a great
[55:40] big hallelujah and he said
[55:42] here's the secret
[55:44] the words in you
[55:47] you're jesus
[55:49] paul says
[55:50] who am i
[55:52] lord
[55:53] who am i
[55:55] he said i'm jesus who you're persecuted
[56:03] some people would show all kinds of
[56:05] respects to god
[56:07] and we'd eat up god's people
[56:10] and spit them out
[56:11] say none of them were qualified
[56:13] none of them had a life
[56:15] none of them this none of them that
[56:19] i am jesus
[56:22] who you're persecuting
[56:24] they're so so very deceived
[56:28] you say you love me and you hate all my
[56:31] jesuses
[56:36] the bible says you're a liar
[56:39] you see
[56:40] they're putting jesus they're putting
[56:42] god in a body and they want to watch it
[56:45] just we'll just worship this body but
[56:47] we'll kill everybody else around
[56:50] because it's just like
[56:51] we love that body
[56:53] and ourselves
[56:58] oh well no maybe we love our that body
[57:01] and the prophet and then herself
[57:03] and so we'll stay home sit on our couch
[57:06] because like we already have the answers
[57:08] but we'll listen to the prophet
[57:10] and
[57:11] we'll worship that body
[57:16] and jesus will say
[57:19] it's this what he'll say
[57:21] it's very hard to kick against the
[57:23] prince
[57:27] it's very hard to kick against the
[57:28] pricks when the bible says forsake not
[57:30] the assembling of yourself together and
[57:32] all the more
[57:34] like some have but all the more
[57:38] as you see the world economy collapsing
[57:40] in one-third
[57:42] on friday
[57:47] those billion and trillionaires they're
[57:49] going to soon be down to about my wealth
[57:52] they just need a couple 31 days
[57:54] we'll be pretty well equal
[57:58] just let that sink in for a minute
[58:03] 31 percent
[58:11] whoa
[58:13] genesis 25
[58:17] what
[58:20] ain't god's word just it's just it's
[58:23] just amazing
[58:25] see it's not a religion
[58:27] it's it's just
[58:28] it's genesis 25 29-34 it's just it's
[58:32] just unbelievable
[58:36] and jacob
[58:39] sod potty and esau came from the field
[58:43] for he was faint now he watches jacob
[58:46] was the soft boy
[58:48] esau was the one that was actually out
[58:51] holding down the job
[58:53] that's the one we'd want our daughters
[58:54] to marry
[59:00] be careful
[59:03] it's a paradox man
[59:06] and esau said to jacob feed me i pray
[59:08] thee the same this red body for i'm
[59:11] faint wherefore
[59:13] was his name
[59:17] called even
[59:19] adam he said
[59:22] jacob said sell me this day your course
[59:25] his birthright
[59:27] was exactly your holy ghost today
[59:31] it was like it was like they told job
[59:34] curse god and die
[59:37] he said you speak
[59:40] like a woman
[59:44] a foolish one
[59:47] sell me the birthright see
[59:50] back in the old testament days and you
[59:51] could google this so google will tell
[59:53] you
[59:54] it was everything to be born first
[59:59] if you were me in the old testament oh
[1:00:03] me and
[1:00:04] me and curtis would be in the same boat
[1:00:06] we didn't have a fighting chance
[1:00:08] we were we were like we were just like
[1:00:11] cannon fodder
[1:00:20] sell me this day your birthday that was
[1:00:22] everything
[1:00:24] just pitch a bowl of soup
[1:00:26] for a couple million dollars
[1:00:30] that's almost what it costs to go to the
[1:00:31] restaurant now
[1:00:32] here next verse
[1:00:37] and esau said
[1:00:39] i wanted you to catch this
[1:00:40] how how how carefree he was on whether
[1:00:44] he had the holy ghost esau said behold i
[1:00:47] am at the point of death
[1:00:49] and what prophet would it do me if i had
[1:00:52] the baptism of the holy ghost anyway
[1:00:59] whoa
[1:01:01] and jacob said swear unto me this day
[1:01:03] and he sweared onto him and sold him his
[1:01:05] birthright
[1:01:07] onto jacob
[1:01:13] jacob gave esau the bread and the
[1:01:15] potting
[1:01:16] for the lentils and he did eat and drink
[1:01:18] and rose up and went out his way
[1:01:21] and thus esau
[1:01:23] dispersed
[1:01:25] his birthright
[1:01:29] wow
[1:01:31] ain't that an exact picture
[1:01:34] of this morning
[1:01:36] it's all right you can turn around look
[1:01:40] well it doesn't matter if we went to
[1:01:42] church
[1:01:43] uh
[1:01:46] i can get everything i need at home
[1:01:48] anyway
[1:01:49] the prophet brought the original seed
[1:01:54] oh man
[1:01:57] are they ever deceived
[1:01:59] the very words that they say they
[1:02:01] believe
[1:02:02] will condemn them to death
[1:02:05] the very words
[1:02:07] the very words the prophet brought
[1:02:11] condemn them
[1:02:13] to death
[1:02:16] wow
[1:02:17] god help us
[1:02:19] you know just
[1:02:20] this week
[1:02:22] we were
[1:02:23] mostly unless you're really close we
[1:02:26] were talking to people that believe this
[1:02:28] message
[1:02:30] and i was stunned
[1:02:32] and it just show you is show you what
[1:02:34] this is
[1:02:37] they had get up early on sunday morning
[1:02:40] you know what our prophets say about
[1:02:42] going to church even if there wasn't a
[1:02:43] church
[1:02:44] that you believe the
[1:02:46] same he said i would go to that church
[1:02:49] and i would keep if they just believe
[1:02:51] jesus is your savior
[1:02:54] or something about jesus so i would just
[1:02:56] take that part but i would show the
[1:02:58] whole rest of the world
[1:03:00] which side i was thought
[1:03:02] oh we don't believe that part
[1:03:04] if you think we do just take a look
[1:03:06] around the pews
[1:03:11] we don't believe that part
[1:03:13] this family get up early because they
[1:03:17] both have jobs

[1:04:07] ministry for people that say they
[1:04:09] believe in the god not to come and hear
[1:04:11] the fivefold
[1:04:14] and do you think god anointed david like
[1:04:17] the the god of the anointing went on the
[1:04:19] men of old to write the holy scriptures
[1:04:22] as they were inspired of
[1:04:24] god

[1:05:07] sunday morning
[1:05:12] wow amen
[1:05:15] see before before we go it'll be
[1:05:18] great and you know what you read you've
[1:05:20] seen that quote i read and the prophet
[1:05:23] said he said they'll try to get you to
[1:05:24] compromise with their
[1:05:27] doctrine or dogma and they'll pat you on
[1:05:29] the back and say well you know like like
[1:05:31] well we we're where why
[1:05:33] the prophet is my pastor
[1:05:37] i believe in spiritualism
[1:05:40] talking to the dead
[1:05:42] it's witchcraft
[1:05:44] an abomination
[1:05:46] see
[1:05:48] because they're they're thinking with
[1:05:51] they're not thinking with their heart
[1:05:53] they're not saying it was god's word
[1:05:56] and these are the ones that are supposed
[1:05:58] to be on our side
[1:06:00] they're supposed to be on god's side
[1:06:04] like the other ones they're just like
[1:06:06] way over there
[1:06:10] wow
[1:06:12] see that's why god said
[1:06:15] before they were even born
[1:06:17] esau
[1:06:18] i hate
[1:06:22] because he didn't like to go to church
[1:06:23] to worship
[1:06:26] but jacob
[1:06:28] he loved worship
[1:06:30] he loved cooking meals and having a
[1:06:32] fellowship
[1:06:35] that's where it's at man
[1:06:37] that's part of it
[1:06:40] wow
[1:06:41] let's just look for here quick let's go
[1:06:43] to acts
[1:06:45] nine
[1:06:46] uh nine four and five and then thirteen
[1:06:48] and sixteen just to see this just to
[1:06:50] nail this down and we'll shut her down
[1:06:53] ain't ain't just some you are
[1:06:55] packing a lunch for jesus today
[1:06:59] you're sweeping the fellas it's like
[1:07:02] god has
[1:07:04] it's not just
[1:07:05] the broom it's not just the lunch it's
[1:07:07] what god has in the plan of where you're
[1:07:09] going
[1:07:10] you're going to get groceries but
[1:07:12] somebody's going to see you and they're
[1:07:14] going to i should ask god and like them
[1:07:16] and
[1:07:18] everybody you talk to you it's not about
[1:07:20] a preacher it's you you go to the home
[1:07:22] schooling group or hear that and people
[1:07:24] walk the neighbors and that that's why
[1:07:25] our light shines don't hide your light
[1:07:27] under the bushes
[1:07:31] and don't let the world blow it out
[1:07:34] it carries to the world
[1:07:36] here here we just read this scripture
[1:07:38] and i know i already recorded it by
[1:07:40] thing but here's examples of
[1:07:42] you are totally
[1:07:45] living in god's vision
[1:07:47] for two
[1:07:48] scriptural facts
[1:07:50] you have respects
[1:07:52] to the promise
[1:07:54] i mean you say more you have the promise
[1:07:57] you have the promise and
[1:08:00] god himself called you jesus
[1:08:04] here's paul he's talking about paul and
[1:08:05] paul and paul fell to the earth and
[1:08:08] heard the voice saying unto him saw saul
[1:08:10] why persecute let's go back one because
[1:08:12] it might talk about the light
[1:08:14] and as he journeyed this is paul now he
[1:08:16] had already been to the governors
[1:08:17] actually let's go to the first because
[1:08:19] it shows us who he's persecuting sorry
[1:08:21] vicky
[1:08:22] i've read this and i got it but i just
[1:08:24] want you to see that i'm not making this
[1:08:26] up and saul yet uh uh
[1:08:29] breathing out uh bla
[1:08:31] threatenings and slaughter against the
[1:08:33] disciples
[1:08:36] of the lord
[1:08:38] like would that be all right to say that
[1:08:40] was believers
[1:08:42] it sounds fairly fair to me
[1:08:44] and i went up to the high priest
[1:08:48] so when i said that about ministers he
[1:08:50] went to the religious people to get
[1:08:51] permission to kill god's people
[1:08:54] sometimes the ministers do that
[1:08:57] the false ones
[1:08:59] and and desired of him letters
[1:09:03] to damascus and to the synagogues that
[1:09:06] if he found any of the way
[1:09:09] whether they were man
[1:09:11] man okay or women we okay but there's
[1:09:15] not women preachers so see this is
[1:09:17] really
[1:09:18] group in the church
[1:09:21] see this was paul trying to kill
[1:09:25] believers
[1:09:27] okay
[1:09:28] we definitely established because
[1:09:30] because there's no way that there would
[1:09:32] so it wasn't just paul killed ministers
[1:09:34] you see it was just standard believers
[1:09:38] you might as well say whether it be men
[1:09:40] women or children
[1:09:41] i was just thought really
[1:09:43] that he might bring him bound to
[1:09:45] jerusalem oh oh yeah because they're
[1:09:48] really backslid and as he journeyed he
[1:09:51] came near damascus and suddenly there
[1:09:53] shineth around him a big light what was
[1:09:55] that like
[1:09:58] the same light that led the children of
[1:10:01] israel out of egypt it was the same
[1:10:02] light that was over brother abraham's
[1:10:04] head
[1:10:04] it was the same it was a pillar of fire
[1:10:06] the same pillar of fire that moses seen
[1:10:08] in the burning bush
[1:10:09] it was the same one that it was
[1:10:12] oh man
[1:10:13] hello it was god it was the spirit god
[1:10:16] is the spirit what do you want to put
[1:10:17] god in you could put god in anything god
[1:10:19] was in the wind god was in the fire that
[1:10:22] stopped the egyptians when it was night
[1:10:23] and it came right up the chariots of
[1:10:25] fire before they crossed the sea before
[1:10:26] the sea opened
[1:10:28] god was in the twig that moses put
[1:10:30] across the sea and said open the waters
[1:10:33] man god was in the rod that he took back
[1:10:35] to egypt when he put in the holy their
[1:10:37] air put in the holy holies and butted
[1:10:39] after it been cut out for days
[1:10:45] but god's in you
[1:10:48] the same god that made that old dad rod
[1:10:50] bud the same god that made the the
[1:10:52] prophet's bones when they threw the
[1:10:54] soldier in and made him come back to
[1:10:55] life
[1:10:59] okay this is what
[1:11:01] this is
[1:11:02] we are going to close this this is what
[1:11:04] satan's against
[1:11:05] you believe in it's the same today
[1:11:09] that's what he's against you say oh
[1:11:10] bless god those are all really nice
[1:11:12] stories and i believe they all happen
[1:11:14] and i believe all that but not today
[1:11:17] oh yeah yep
[1:11:18] yep hell will have to get a little bit
[1:11:20] bigger for those people
[1:11:23] oh yeah oh yeah it was all good with
[1:11:25] jesus and those prophets i believe they
[1:11:27] threw them on the bones and i believe
[1:11:29] the fire and i believe the twig opened
[1:11:30] the red sea and i believe god fed the
[1:11:32] ravens to the prophet and oh yeah he did
[1:11:35] all that kind of stuff then but now in
[1:11:36] inflation no no well it's different
[1:11:38] because we got like we got like credit
[1:11:40] cards
[1:11:42] oh well we better make hell a little bit
[1:11:44] bigger
[1:11:46] see it's on belief
[1:11:48] it's just it's just flat on belief
[1:11:51] and there's no revelation with unbelief
[1:11:54] belief and revelation are buddies
[1:11:57] they're one in the same
[1:11:59] faith revelation
[1:12:01] amen faith revelation and believing are
[1:12:04] all one in the same you can't have one
[1:12:06] without the other
[1:12:09] there was god that came down it just in
[1:12:12] that time it was god in a light
[1:12:14] this morning it's god in
[1:12:16] bodies
[1:12:18] amen next one sorry
[1:12:20] john all right now now now here's paul
[1:12:23] killing the christians but he recognizes
[1:12:25] the light is god
[1:12:27] that's unbelievable he didn't recognize
[1:12:29] the christians as being god but he
[1:12:31] recognizes a bright that's like oh how
[1:12:33] you doing god is that light
[1:12:37] but there's some people that would do
[1:12:39] that they'd worship that light but then
[1:12:40] they would eat up their brothers and
[1:12:41] sisters behind their back and tell them
[1:12:44] how and i remember and
[1:12:49] huh be careful
[1:12:51] and he found the earth and said heard
[1:12:52] was a loud voice said saul saul why
[1:12:55] persecute thou me
[1:12:57] the bright light
[1:12:59] can god still speak out of lights
[1:13:02] if he did then he can still do it again
[1:13:04] today and he said why
[1:13:06] now this is this is god and he said why
[1:13:09] art doubt lord who out our lord this is
[1:13:11] paul sorry i said who is the lord and
[1:13:13] the lord said here's the lord saying he
[1:13:15] said i am jesus
[1:13:18] whom thou persecuted
[1:13:20] now we just read literally four verses
[1:13:22] back where he was persecuting women and
[1:13:25] children of the disciples of the lord
[1:13:28] i'm jesus and it's hard to kick against
[1:13:31] the pricks
[1:13:32] it's very hard
[1:13:34] to go against god's word and say you're
[1:13:36] a believer
[1:13:39] let's go to 13 and 16.
[1:13:44] we're close with this we'll just
[1:13:48] accident the same yep
[1:13:49] and emmaus here here's so paul's getting
[1:13:52] converted now
[1:13:54] and paul had a reputation of of like
[1:13:58] shortening people's necks
[1:14:00] like cutting their throats
[1:14:02] the bible says that killing people
[1:14:05] and god talked to emmaus which was a
[1:14:06] good believer in the day
[1:14:08] and he said emmaus i want you to go and
[1:14:11] talk to paul and they made he said whoa
[1:14:12] whoa lord we understand and
[1:14:15] totally
[1:14:16] this is the back scriptures i want to
[1:14:18] close today
[1:14:19] but he may like he may watch this we do
[1:14:22] this to god you know say but but god do
[1:14:24] you remember like this person do you
[1:14:26] know his past
[1:14:28] ain't that cute
[1:14:31] we're like little ants to god
[1:14:34] and we think he forgot
[1:14:38] he made paul
[1:14:41] we're little ants now i want to prove to
[1:14:43] you
[1:14:44] real hard that you're in the vision and
[1:14:46] if god tells me again to preach it next
[1:14:48] sunday i'm just going to put a 3 behind
[1:14:49] it
[1:14:51] and amos answered and said lord but i've
[1:14:53] heard many things of this man and how he
[1:14:55] did evil and hath done to thy servants
[1:14:58] in jerusalem now was paul killing
[1:15:00] he was killing the servant the saints
[1:15:02] sorry the saints i said servants he was
[1:15:04] killing the saints and god said they
[1:15:06] were jesus
[1:15:08] we got that now is that fair to say then
[1:15:12] we're jesus today we're saints
[1:15:15] so we're jesus
[1:15:16] is that that's fair that's fair okay and
[1:15:19] here he has authority from the chief
[1:15:21] priests the binding call of the all by
[1:15:24] thy name
[1:15:28] and the lord said unto him
[1:15:31] go thy way
[1:15:33] for he's living in the vision
[1:15:36] no no just wait a minute he paul's
[1:15:38] living in the vision killing christians
[1:15:45] wow
[1:15:46] so the next time somebody tells you i
[1:15:48] remember when you did something
[1:15:50] and i won't associate with you because
[1:15:53] i'm higher than you
[1:15:56] that's so sweet
[1:15:58] because the bible says not to put
[1:16:00] respecters of persons because it's sin
[1:16:02] it makes you guilty of the whole law
[1:16:05] means that you'll be in hell too
[1:16:08] if you ever showed respects to persons
[1:16:10] you know the bible mentions that
[1:16:11] multiple repeated different times
[1:16:14] respects the persons
[1:16:17] and god told ame amos
[1:16:20] and all right sorry thank you god told
[1:16:22] him he said
[1:16:23] he is a chosen
[1:16:26] vessel
[1:16:29] whoa
[1:16:31] i i'm pretty confident here there was
[1:16:34] none of us took our life agenda to
[1:16:36] killing saints
[1:16:40] so is it hard to believe that you're a
[1:16:41] chosen vessel
[1:16:43] you just did a little boo-boo
[1:16:46] paul was like
[1:16:48] premeditated
[1:16:50] i want to kill him
[1:16:53] god said he is a chosen vessel unto me
[1:16:55] to bear the name before the gentiles and
[1:16:58] kings and children of israel
[1:17:03] wow
[1:17:06] and i will show him how great things he
[1:17:08] must suffer for my name's sake
[1:17:11] see
[1:17:13] ain't that a paradox
[1:17:18] what it looks like
[1:17:20] to the outside man
[1:17:22] god's eyes
[1:17:24] you can come honey
[1:17:27] paul was living the vision joseph was
[1:17:31] living the vision in prison
[1:17:33] david was living the vision
[1:17:35] packing a sandwich
[1:17:37] and i didn't get half my notes because i
[1:17:39] was going to go into some of the visions
[1:17:41] that the prophet
[1:17:42] showed i want you to remember this if
[1:17:45] i'm not even preaching next sunday i
[1:17:46] don't think but
[1:17:48] if we come back to this
[1:17:50] no one
[1:17:51] in the vision
[1:17:53] no one
[1:17:54] can take your place
[1:17:56] i i want to just give you one short
[1:17:58] paraphrase if we minister on this again
[1:18:00] i want to show you visions that the
[1:18:02] prophet had
[1:18:04] and mistakes he made in the vision
[1:18:08] because he didn't give enough time for
[1:18:10] the vision to come a pass by other
[1:18:12] people doing it
[1:18:14] and he says in the visions he said there
[1:18:16] was no way
[1:18:18] i could tell those people to do what
[1:18:21] they had to do
[1:18:23] so when you put on a checkered shirt in
[1:18:25] the morning
[1:18:26] or you go move a pail of feed
[1:18:29] or you move a rake that's in the yard
[1:18:34] you're living in god's vision
[1:18:37] prophet said different ones where he's
[1:18:38] seen a visionary go into a house and
[1:18:40] there was a rake laying on the yard
[1:18:42] there was a bible on the stool inside
[1:18:44] and a lady had to come to the door in a
[1:18:46] red sweater
[1:18:52] he said i couldn't say thus saith the
[1:18:53] lord until all three of those things
[1:18:54] fell into place and he said neither
[1:18:56] could i go tell them
[1:18:58] to move the rake
[1:19:00] oh buddy i would have wanted to move the
[1:19:02] rage
[1:19:03] like just move that right just move
[1:19:08] maybe it was just
[1:19:10] a little boy
[1:19:11] or a little girl
[1:19:13] that was going to move the rape
[1:19:17] and they were just as much a part of
[1:19:19] that vision
[1:19:21] as the prophet saying you're healed
[1:19:24] because
[1:19:25] i'll show you later
[1:19:27] where he got ahead of it
[1:19:29] and it didn't work
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:33] ain't that powerful
[1:19:36] we're living we're today
[1:19:39] we always heard it said but we're living
[1:19:42] we can stand
[1:19:44] you're living right out of god's visions
[1:19:47] and you you just thought you were going
[1:19:49] to work
[1:19:50] you just woke up you know and you just
[1:19:52] thought that you know i'm going to plant
[1:19:53] corn today if the planter don't break
[1:19:56] the third time
[1:19:58] but god heads break planter
[1:20:02] to have me sit down for one hour
[1:20:04] to give me a month of messages
[1:20:08] about
[1:20:09] moving a rake
[1:20:11] and how even the prophets
[1:20:14] thought different than god
[1:20:17] because they they didn't see the vision
[1:20:19] the same way as god did
[1:20:22] oh that just makes me go
[1:20:26] that
[1:20:28] when all hell comes against you
[1:20:31] god's got a vision
[1:20:33] and you're right in that vision
[1:20:35] it's so
[1:20:36] you don't have to
[1:20:37] it it'll it'll just happen
[1:20:40] you know it's like this is like god you
[1:20:42] know
[1:20:43] he's seen the video already
[1:20:46] and if you're like me i want to tell
[1:20:48] what's going to happen in the book or
[1:20:49] the video
[1:20:51] but he's just sitting there he's
[1:20:55] you know we used to read a book and i
[1:20:57] tell them when your kids say don't tell
[1:20:59] me i won't read the book if you tell me
[1:21:01] i said god
[1:21:03] he already read the book
[1:21:05] and he's waiting for a little girl to
[1:21:06] move the rake
[1:21:09] or a little boy to pack a
