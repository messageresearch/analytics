[26:56] we're made to fellowship
[26:59] we're not made to agree on everything i
[27:02] don't agree with my wife on lots of
[27:03] things
[27:05] but we're still mates fellowship
[27:07] and you know people ask the prophet are
[27:09] we supposed to go to other churches that
[27:10] you're not preaching or they're not
[27:12] preaching exactly what you preach and he
[27:14] said oh my goodness
[27:16] of course
[27:18] amen if they say something that's off

[27:38] man so i might talk to the deacons or
[27:40] some of the brothers some of you we
[27:42] could even consider closing sunday

[27:45] that's hard to do but if we got a really
[27:48] good commitment to go
[27:50] there um
[27:51] um we would do that and
[27:53] and and i say this with
[27:55] the most sincerity if somebody here says

[29:37] this is a brother that we met this is
[29:39] not just a brother this is a pastor
[29:43] that me and brother jim meant just
[29:45] remember uh brother jim says she lended
[29:47] me and brother james went seeing him
[29:49] last night seeing brother jim last night
[29:50] took him out for his birthday and
[29:52] they're doing really well
[29:54] also remember john blackman
[29:57] and that and this brothers uh
[30:00] has a tremendous ministry has a couple
[30:02] of churches
[30:04] or a church and an outreach
[30:06] and we've we've helped them do little
[30:08] things maybe a roof on the building or
[30:10] stuff just think this is not a beggar
[30:13] this guy is not a beggar
[30:15] and we were supposed to preach for him
[30:17] and we had the car accident so he came
[30:18] and met and ate dinner with me and
[30:20] brother jim and you know pastor leo or
[30:23] whoever
[30:25] anyway there's actually a brother in
[30:27] sarnia that gives money to orphanages
[30:29] through our church
[30:31] i believe this brother has 120 kids he
[30:34] feeds every day
[30:35] 120
[30:37] okay
[30:39] so
[30:40] this is a common occurrence i could show
[30:42] you hundreds of pictures of him
[30:43] baptizing in the lake this is the the
[30:46] only lake fresh water that's right next
[30:48] to the capitol by the airport you drive
[30:50] by it when we go to the airport it's
[30:52] right beside it
[30:53] be like our great lakes but it's a lot
[30:55] dirtier than our great lakes but let's
[30:57] go to the next pictures
[30:59] um this is just some examples let's blow
[31:02] that up a whole bunch if we can um i
[31:04] think but this brother's wife
[31:09] uh
[31:11] appendix
[31:13] bursted
[31:15] saturday
[31:17] saturday so it would almost been our
[31:19] friday or bursted or
[31:22] is inflamed and has to come out now my
[31:24] wife's appendix had come out and it was
[31:26] emergency surgery i mean she was the
[31:28] hospital and one hour later they were
[31:29] doing it my dad they had to do that too
[31:33] this is patricia my dad they were he was
[31:35] sick and sarnia i remember this clearly
[31:37] my dad they couldn't figure out what it
[31:38] was
[31:40] and they almost sent him home and they
[31:42] said well you know
[31:43] maybe we better not send you home maybe
[31:45] we better send you to london when he got
[31:46] to london they did a surgery within an
[31:48] hour they said if they would have sent
[31:49] you home they would have took you from
[31:51] your home in a box
[31:54] and this guy
[32:00] needs 970 000 uganda shillings
[32:05] which is 340 dollars canadian
[32:08] and he said i hope i get the money
[32:10] before my wife dies
[32:13] which one of you brothers would value
[32:14] your wife at 340
[32:18] if i don't have it
[32:20] he said i hope the doctor would do this
[32:21] i said brother i can't even send it to
[32:22] you till monday because moneygram is
[32:24] closed you can turn the pictures
[32:28] and so the last messages he has sent me
[32:32] he has not even answered
[32:34] um i sent him a message i said tell the
[32:37] doctor to read my message
[32:38] do the surgery save your wife and i'll
[32:40] send the money monday morning you'll get
[32:42] it tuesday morning
[32:43] man but this is
[32:45] a regular occurrence but it's
[32:47] unbelievable how they live
[32:50] that
[32:51] for 340 bucks the doctor wasn't even
[32:53] working so it didn't matter if her
[32:55] appendix had bursted he said i'm not in
[32:56] the hospital sunday that's not an option
[32:58] i'll be there by noon on monday
[33:01] if you have the money
[33:03] if she's dead by then we'll he'll bury
[33:04] you
[33:07] unbelievable
[33:09] this is somebody i sat across the table
[33:12] and ate with
[33:13] fellowship
[33:16] just amazing amen
[33:18] so amen just i don't know we might i
[33:21] think we have one more
[33:22] just blow that out but so
[33:24] at the very least remember the brother

[37:56] experience

[38:24] thank you
[38:34] david said he was glad when they say to
[38:37] him let us go into the house of the lord
[38:40] and
[38:43] i'm also glad to be in the house of the
[38:45] lord today
[38:47] amen
[38:49] you know among my welcoming people
[38:52] and i
[38:53] definitely appreciate um but adele
[38:56] sister luann
[38:58] you know being here
[39:00] you know the last time not the last time
[39:03] but
[39:04] uh the first time
[39:06] that dale ever met my wife
[39:09] was when he was baptizing her
[39:14] and um
[39:17] at that time we didn't have no children
[39:21] four children later
[39:23] and the oldest one is ten years
[39:26] that's how much time has gone on
[39:30] and um
[39:31] so just definitely appreciate brother
[39:34] dale
[39:35] since then
[39:36] i've known him to be
[39:38] a humble servant of the lord
[39:41] i don't think that has changed about him
[39:44] with time at all
[39:46] you know
[39:47] i think
[39:48] maybe
[39:48] becoming a grandpa
[39:51] has made him more mellow
[39:54] you know it's uh
[39:56] i think somebody one time jogged and say
[39:59] life would be good if there was no
[40:02] moms and dads only grandpa's and
[40:04] grandmas
[40:06] but uh we we definitely i definitely
[40:11] appreciate being here
[40:14] i i bring you uh greetings from pada
[40:17] nelson that's that's my pastor
[40:20] uh he's on the missionary field so we
[40:22] talked a little bit when we were coming
[40:25] here i remember the last time
[40:27] that i was here preaching
[40:30] you know time of moves there was a
[40:32] pandemic in between
[40:34] and i remember i was coming here for the
[40:36] first time
[40:37] to preach
[40:39] and uh
[40:40] i i used brother nelson's vehicle
[40:43] because he lent me his vehicle
[40:45] just just he decided to
[40:47] and
[40:49] then uh i was playing i i just started
[40:52] driving and then he started playing at
[40:54] 8.
[40:55] i just knew i was coming here i didn't
[40:57] know exactly
[40:58] the name of the church or nothing
[41:01] and to my surprise it played the tape on
[41:04] half this time
[41:06] it wasn't even my
[41:08] i'm like god in a very simple way
[41:11] he has a very simple way to confirm
[41:14] his word
[41:15] so i would encourage you to not to look
[41:18] out for big outstanding things
[41:21] but the bottom before you preach
[41:24] the the seals you preach to god
[41:28] in simplicity
[41:30] you know
[41:31] because god is so great you know we look
[41:34] for great things and he does great
[41:35] things
[41:36] but he always works in a simple way
[41:40] in a simple way i think there's one of
[41:42] the songs that was saying says
[41:44] all heavens declare
[41:47] and all nature declared the glory of god
[41:50] you know
[41:52] i think it's david who said even if i
[41:54] lay my bed in hell
[41:56] thou art there
[41:59] you know that's that's that's how our
[42:01] god works
[42:02] and uh so
[42:04] look beyond me
[42:06] i am just uh
[42:08] a mortal man
[42:10] you know
[42:11] i i i i am nothing
[42:15] but you know
[42:17] um
[42:19] god bless you i think i believe brother
[42:21] jim is streaming we had a chance to see
[42:23] him
[42:24] it was good connecting
[42:27] god bless everybody but uh gerard thank
[42:30] you for for the song service sister
[42:32] julie
[42:34] and my kids had
[42:36] some good time with them and they played
[42:38] around
[42:39] but matt thank you good to see you
[42:42] you know the problem is once you start
[42:44] uh mentioning names
[42:46] sometimes you forget one and you get
[42:48] yourself into trouble
[42:50] and then sometimes you mention everybody
[42:52] then you realize oh i forgot my wife
[42:56] and then maybe she may be nice enough to
[42:58] remind you when you're driving oh i'm
[43:00] sorry
[43:02] but at the br back there i think i see
[43:04] is that brother
[43:06] god bless you
[43:08] yes yes yes i know uh sister ruth you
[43:12] know i don't know if your wife ever told
[43:14] you one of the times
[43:16] we can connected is
[43:18] sister ruth and i
[43:20] different is we were born but we were
[43:22] born exactly on the same day
[43:24] so before she got married
[43:27] we used to do a little thing and there's
[43:29] another sister by us was born on
[43:31] february 10 and would go
[43:33] and eat out on that day
[43:36] so go a long time
[43:38] so look beyond me everybody else have
[43:41] his time bright tabernacle
[43:44] you know i haven't mentioned by name god
[43:46] bless you
[43:47] and uh and uh and um
[43:50] just look to god
[43:52] to the people who are streaming
[43:54] look to god
[43:56] you know i've had instances
[43:58] i won't go into
[44:00] the details of
[44:02] exactly what and who but
[44:05] where i've been listening to online
[44:09] and i had prayed
[44:10] to god
[44:12] really sincerely and deeply
[44:16] and then it was a live streaming with
[44:18] somebody not not our local church or
[44:20] nothing
[44:21] but uh you know a message minister was
[44:23] preaching there and um
[44:26] then
[44:27] after i finished praying i'm like okay
[44:29] i'm gonna listen it was a sad that i'm
[44:31] gonna listen and then i sat down i took
[44:33] a shower and said i'm gonna just sit
[44:34] down like i'm in church that was way
[44:36] before
[44:37] my wife was was here
[44:40] and um
[44:41] i remember that that minister
[44:44] put his knots on the side he says i feel
[44:45] a pull to change my salmon
[44:49] and then uh then he put his notes aside
[44:52] then he started preaching like he'd been
[44:54] listening to my prayer
[44:58] and one by one i just don't go into
[45:00] names because sometimes
[45:02] this is this is it's not a bad thing but
[45:04] sometimes
[45:06] you trouble when you start naming names
[45:09] but sometimes people think you are then
[45:11] endorsing that minister or you are
[45:12] saying something no you are just saying
[45:14] how god moves
[45:16] you know god can use anybody
[45:19] you know actually brother bonham
[45:22] let's not see brother let's go in the
[45:24] bible god use the raven
[45:28] ravens to bring food to your prophet
[45:30] now you could uh you could just go into
[45:34] your illegality say you know the ravens
[45:37] is supposed to be an unclean bird you
[45:39] know how he's gonna bring food you know
[45:42] you miss the blessing so
[45:44] you know if you feel within your heart
[45:47] not that i say anybody feels that but if
[45:50] you think in your heart because you know
[45:52] we are living in an age way
[45:53] people say a lot of things about people
[45:58] oh friends you don't judge people that
[46:00] way
[46:01] i thank god
[46:03] i i i
[46:05] i i don't think about brother there if i
[46:08] want to know about something about
[46:10] brother dale i'll tell you what i do
[46:13] and i would encourage you to do the same
[46:15] thing i go to god
[46:18] because he gives me an answer
[46:20] that is good god still speaks
[46:24] he still speaks
[46:27] you don't go now to the person maybe we
[46:29] don't like him for whatever reason
[46:32] they won't have nothing too positive to
[46:34] say
[46:36] unfortunately you know
[46:39] but the bottom speaks about you know
[46:40] every country having a national spirit
[46:43] in my observation
[46:45] one of the things i've met you know and
[46:48] he talks about the american spirit and
[46:50] he talks about the german spirit and
[46:52] stuff like national spirit that is
[46:54] and uh frankly he said you know in his
[46:57] opinion at that time he said the
[46:58] american spirit was the worst that's
[47:00] what he said
[47:01] now that's nothing against our american
[47:03] brothers that that's not what i'm saying
[47:05] at all actually our prophet came from
[47:08] there so
[47:09] so so so that's not what we are talking
[47:12] about but you come into canada people
[47:14] generally they are polite but after a
[47:17] while you realize a lot are polite on
[47:18] the surface
[47:20] because just down the road just down the
[47:22] corner you see them
[47:27] the best friends
[47:29] and you're saying why are you doing that
[47:30] to your best friend
[47:32] no you know and people get so
[47:36] but it's an evil spirit
[47:39] that's not good
[47:41] you know if you can't talk
[47:43] directly to sister luan and stuff like
[47:45] that maybe you should keep quiet
[47:48] don't go behind the back and stuff like
[47:50] that and begin to sass and throw down
[47:53] some things no that's not a good spirit
[47:55] at all
[47:57] friends i'm just talking is i feel led
[48:00] you know but they'll never give me a sem
[48:02] and say
[48:04] you know so you know these things they
[48:07] they we have to get rid of these things
[48:09] if we want to see god
[48:11] move in a greater way
[48:13] you know we have to overcome that now
[48:15] we're just saying that you you go you go
[48:18] i come from a country called zimbabwe
[48:20] that's that's in southern africa and
[48:22] stuff like that you go there i see
[48:24] from my experiences
[48:26] i haven't lived there for the when since
[48:29] i came here but i visited once at least
[48:32] and uh
[48:33] people they have this thing they just
[48:34] want to be like somebody else if they're
[48:37] around jamaicans they're speaking like
[48:38] jamaicans if they're around americans
[48:41] americans
[48:42] it's disgusting to me you know that's
[48:45] the national spirit there if they're
[48:46] around south africans they are just like
[48:49] south africans
[48:50] and and and that's the kind of spirit
[48:52] that's
[48:53] well
[48:55] we have to overcome national spirits
[48:58] we have to overcome you know we have to
[49:01] overcome the bible talks about god
[49:03] giving us power over the nations that's
[49:06] power over national spirits
[49:08] you know and the way we do that we get
[49:10] into christ by the baptism the whole
[49:15] to that of course these aspects about
[49:18] your identity your thing that you
[49:20] maintain whatever is good you're good
[49:23] you're not gonna change your canadian
[49:25] accent because
[49:26] what there's nothing wrong with that but
[49:29] when we start talking about things that
[49:31] are sinful those things we need to
[49:33] overcome
[49:34] that's why the gospel is preached
[49:37] so i just see that to lay down the
[49:38] background so that you can prove you see
[49:41] going to
[49:42] going back to the story i was saying the
[49:43] minister says i feel it pulled then he
[49:46] preached like he'd been listening to my
[49:48] sermon the whole sermon
[49:50] then he finished
[49:52] and when he finished there was one thing
[49:54] that was still pending so i saw him this
[49:57] is live streaming i saw him take his
[49:59] knots like this
[50:01] and then he starts walking away
[50:03] and as he's walking away in my heart i'm
[50:05] just
[50:05] still one more
[50:08] like right here i i see he comes back to
[50:11] the pulpit here they ended over the song
[50:14] the service to the song later and and
[50:16] then he comes down and he says exactly
[50:19] the last one thing that i needed to hear
[50:22] you know
[50:23] if you want to know who it is later i'll
[50:25] tell you but not not now you know we can
[50:28] do that after the service done after
[50:30] after he done that he even said to
[50:32] yourself he says lord i don't know what
[50:34] was this all about but i just follow
[50:36] your leading and that was
[50:38] it you know
[50:42] you know god always speaks then one time
[50:45] i had gone you see that's why i was
[50:47] talking about church many testimonies i
[50:50] can give you with that but
[50:52] let us go
[50:54] into into in into the word
[50:56] but i just appreciate everybody
[50:58] appreciate my wife
[51:00] biggest daughter patience
[51:02] faith
[51:03] daniel and charity that's the the
[51:06] the children that uh that god god gave
[51:09] us
[51:10] so i appreciate my wife coming with me
[51:12] initially i was gonna come by myself
[51:14] because you know children have started
[51:16] school and you're thinking you know okay
[51:18] you know we have prayer meeting friday
[51:20] and then you know saturday and then come
[51:23] monday i'm like no
[51:25] no you know you i like what brother dale
[51:27] was saying about fellowship
[51:29] you know we have to press on to have
[51:31] fellowship
[51:32] satan doesn't want us to have fellowship
[51:35] human beings are made to fellowship
[51:39] you know we are made to fellowship and
[51:41] and i appreciate about that about
[51:45] brother brother dale
[51:46] that uh not only does he talk about it
[51:50] you know
[51:50] let me put this way i got something kind
[51:53] of to make right you know brother dale
[51:54] for a long time he asked me to to come
[51:58] and uh it didn't it didn't work out the
[52:00] last time i answered in a week that
[52:02] afterwards i'm like no the answer didn't
[52:04] sound right i'm like ah we'll see you
[52:06] know they were beginning to open up uh
[52:09] like i will see the pandemic has been on
[52:11] and stuff like that honestly i i don't
[52:13] move we continued working because they
[52:16] didn't close the company because it's
[52:17] security they say essential business so
[52:20] i said oh well i got to work for my
[52:21] money even though others are getting
[52:23] some for free i got to work for mine so
[52:25] we continued working
[52:27] well
[52:29] the rules essentially to me they are
[52:31] bitter they were more arbitrary side
[52:33] it's like
[52:34] i'm working am i less risk now
[52:37] others what are you it's like it was all
[52:40] over the map
[52:41] so when i answered him like that i'm
[52:43] like that didn't sound right it's it's
[52:45] not like i'm afraid of covet
[52:47] i'm not
[52:48] because the bible said though i walk
[52:50] through the valley of the shadow of
[52:52] death
[52:53] i will fear no evil
[52:54] for thou art with me thy road i stuff
[52:57] they comfort me
[52:59] this is the promises of god now you're
[53:01] not gonna go around then dear god and
[53:04] tempt god you don't do that you're going
[53:06] up in my view you're going with your
[53:08] personal life in an everyday manner and
[53:11] and the rest you commit to god you know
[53:14] i try to find the the the the balance
[53:17] there at the workplace and then they
[53:19] foster they say are you oh you got to
[53:21] stop pushing everybody you got to be
[53:22] fascinated oh you
[53:24] got to go to clients and stuff like that
[53:26] i i initially i'm thinking like okay
[53:29] what i want is
[53:31] well maybe i don't know i ain't no
[53:33] scientist
[53:34] uh something's just not making sense to
[53:36] me
[53:37] one time they were saying don't put math
[53:39] and after a while they say put math and
[53:42] uh so i ain't no expecting those things
[53:45] i'm like you know sometimes you know at
[53:47] the end of the day to me
[53:49] people make fun of things that are small
[53:55] let me let me put it this way
[53:57] paul put it this way he was talking
[53:59] about eating meat
[54:04] he says it's okay if a person and then
[54:07] let's use a different example he was
[54:09] talking about observing this he says one
[54:11] person observed days it's fine don't
[54:14] face it
[54:15] he says to the lord he doesn't observe
[54:17] it another one observe it to the lord he
[54:19] does it
[54:20] so in other words
[54:22] to me
[54:23] paul actually said this he said i became
[54:25] all things to all men that i may win sir
[54:29] paul went among the jews and shaved
[54:31] himself
[54:33] and cleansed himself ceremoniously to be
[54:35] among the jews and took timothy and
[54:38] circumcised them
[54:40] hid poor prisons a circumcision is
[54:42] nothing
[54:45] you see
[54:46] but the banana preached in india and he
[54:48] put on a caller because they thought
[54:50] that the minister has to put on a caller
[54:54] it's not like you want to put on a call
[54:56] you know what if if i'm gonna put on a
[54:58] caller to win souls i would do it
[55:02] as long as it's not sinful
[55:05] as long as it's not sinful that's the
[55:07] key
[55:08] that that to me that's the balance we
[55:10] need
[55:12] you know we we we we can't jump on onto
[55:14] something that says okay you know what
[55:16] yeah okay fine that's what they say i'm
[55:18] gonna that's another fight if i go going
[55:20] into daddy if
[55:23] i put that on i says lord you said if
[55:25] you drink any deadly thing he shall not
[55:27] harm you
[55:29] but i can't go evangelizing about a a
[55:32] vaccine i don't know how would i do that
[55:35] i can't be upset about somebody who
[55:37] didn't maybe that would have been my
[55:39] inclination from the start so these
[55:41] things we ought to make them the smaller
[55:43] things in my view
[55:45] the bigger picture in the church is
[55:48] souls
[55:50] that's the bigger picture worshiping god
[55:53] getting close to god
[55:55] getting out of here preparing ourselves
[55:57] to get out of here to me that's the
[55:59] bigger picture
[56:01] everything else is
[56:02] small
[56:04] everything else is is small and and and
[56:07] and when we are that oh
[56:10] man friends the first conspiracy in the
[56:12] world started with lucifer
[56:15] so don't get sidetracked there's so many
[56:17] conspiracies some real some not real i
[56:20] don't know i don't have enough
[56:22] intelligence to follow them all
[56:23] sometimes i reason and i'm like this
[56:25] doesn't make sense you know but they all
[56:27] show me something i'm like yeah when you
[56:30] reason like wow it doesn't make sense
[56:32] but if i follow that friends from the
[56:34] beginning satan the first conspiracy
[56:36] started not on earth it started in
[56:38] heaven
[56:40] you know so
[56:41] we won't be surprised if people are
[56:43] doing things clandestinely behind the
[56:46] back you can perceive that and forget
[56:48] that the focus is for you to get close
[56:51] to god
[56:53] that's the main thing to look at your
[56:55] life and say is my life approved of god
[56:58] am i ready
[57:01] you know and and to me those are the the
[57:03] most important questions
[57:06] and that's what we want to get get into
[57:08] by by by the grace of god but for a
[57:11] scripture reading
[57:13] we're going to read this scripture that
[57:14] will lay down the background of
[57:17] what we want to preach
[57:18] but before that let me read this i saw
[57:21] this um
[57:22] on
[57:24] but
[57:25] dale's uh
[57:26] this there
[57:28] and i thought i liked that because
[57:30] that's a thought
[57:31] that that had been in my mind he says
[57:35] it's a print out of a quotation from dan
[57:37] pardon it was sin
[57:38] it says there's no great people
[57:42] and big people in the kingdom
[57:46] i want that to sink in
[57:53] not even brother banner
[57:55] because he's the one saying
[57:59] look friends you look into the heavens
[58:01] in the skies you see stars
[58:04] you see some very small stars that you
[58:06] might have to actually maybe get a
[58:08] telescope they're just right there
[58:10] you see a big star the morning star or
[58:13] whatever and it's shining
[58:15] it's almost like whoa when you look
[58:17] everything is attracting you to that
[58:20] each one of those stars
[58:22] was given that glory by god
[58:26] the bigger one can't say i i'm bigger
[58:28] than you
[58:29] because i'm better because everything is
[58:31] freely given
[58:33] so there is no big me and small you in
[58:36] the kingdom
[58:37] you have to change that mindset all
[58:39] together now there's different roles
[58:42] there's different roles there's a
[58:43] prophet there's pastors there's all
[58:45] these different things you you you know
[58:47] but it's it's it's almost as if
[58:50] sometimes the connotation you get around
[58:52] message people
[58:54] of which i am one and without saying it
[58:57] it's almost the same it's okay
[58:59] to respect brother branham but it's okay
[59:02] to disrespect the children of god
[59:06] that's the atmosphere that they're
[59:07] carrying sometimes
[59:09] it's okay to respect that but
[59:11] disrespect pastors
[59:16] they they they say it
[59:18] that's why they want to take the
[59:20] pastor's role off
[59:24] it's almost like when they read
[59:26] ephesians they want to read and and he
[59:28] gave some prophets and prophets and
[59:30] prophets and prophets and prophets
[59:33] that's their kind of fivefold ministry
[59:38] friends it's not so
[59:41] brother branham believed in the fivefold
[59:43] ministry
[59:46] hallelujah we better hit that spirit
[59:50] it's wrong
[59:53] the fivefold ministry is to bring you to
[59:55] maturity perfection
[59:58] so that those things we are looking at
[1:00:00] there the statue of a perfect man they
[1:00:02] are established
[1:00:04] that's what the fivefold minister say
[1:00:06] that's what ephesians say he gave that
[1:00:08] in the church for the perfecting of the
[1:00:09] church
[1:00:12] well
[1:00:14] so you see sitting
[1:00:16] tactic
[1:00:17] if you listen to prophets and prophets
[1:00:20] and prophets and prophets you're not
[1:00:22] gonna mature
[1:00:24] you've got to believe in the fivefold
[1:00:27] ministry
[1:00:29] then there's another spirit that say
[1:00:31] brother branham fulfilled the five-fold
[1:00:33] where you get her from
[1:00:36] which quotation will he look oh oh
[1:00:38] because he said do the work of the
[1:00:40] evangelist even himself he says he say
[1:00:42] do the work of the evangelist i am not
[1:00:44] an evangelisticity
[1:00:49] he says i i passed it but i couldn't
[1:00:52] stand the fastings of the people
[1:00:56] oh these are quotations i didn't come
[1:00:58] prepared for that to read that but you
[1:01:00] can call you can choose you can you can
[1:01:02] look for these things
[1:01:03] just get keywords well we are living in
[1:01:05] an age electronic age let's use it for
[1:01:08] good
[1:01:09] let's use it to search these things
[1:01:12] let us be like the bearings that when
[1:01:14] you hear something
[1:01:16] if it's coming from the bible if it's
[1:01:18] coming from the message at least jot it
[1:01:20] down
[1:01:21] and listen
[1:01:23] don't shut down your mind right away and
[1:01:25] say i ain't gonna listen that was like
[1:01:26] the jews at thessalonians the bible says
[1:01:29] the jews said bearing they were more
[1:01:31] noble because they had paul saying new
[1:01:33] things that are different from what they
[1:01:35] had heard
[1:01:36] and they say well let us write it down
[1:01:39] let us go back let us search the things
[1:01:43] jesus christ actually encouraged people
[1:01:45] to say search the scriptures for in them
[1:01:48] you think you have eternal life sage the
[1:01:51] message because in them you think you're
[1:01:53] a message believer and they are the ones
[1:01:55] that testify these things brother
[1:01:56] branham says he believed in the
[1:01:58] five-fold ministry
[1:02:00] so you see we are at the age now where
[1:02:03] while the messenger came the messenger
[1:02:06] fulfilled his his part
[1:02:08] there is no more mysteries to be
[1:02:10] revealed i am looking for an eighth
[1:02:12] messenger maybe you are friends but i'm
[1:02:14] not
[1:02:15] i'm looking for the coming of the lord
[1:02:17] that's to me that's the next major thing
[1:02:20] on the calendar of god
[1:02:22] wow but what he said he said people who
[1:02:25] come rise up young men take and put
[1:02:27] sense to this message
[1:02:29] how are they putting sense or not by
[1:02:31] injecting their own idea because
[1:02:34] sometimes i hit highlights
[1:02:37] but the word of god comes precept upon
[1:02:40] precept
[1:02:41] line upon line
[1:02:43] hallelujah word upon word line upon line
[1:02:47] actually the way it's written it says
[1:02:48] precept upon precept precept upon prison
[1:02:51] line upon line and line upon line the
[1:02:54] word of god is not repeating things just
[1:02:56] for the sake of repeating
[1:02:58] but the bible says in the mouth of two
[1:03:00] or three witnesses let every word be
[1:03:02] established
[1:03:03] so if you're establishing yourself in a
[1:03:05] doctrine in a way of thinking you have
[1:03:08] to have the ability to have run it from
[1:03:10] genesis to revelation
[1:03:15] not just one scripture
[1:03:17] and say yeah that's it
[1:03:20] let me give you an example
[1:03:22] somebody you know you know because when
[1:03:24] i came here
[1:03:26] some of the people that i knew the
[1:03:28] message took a hold of me when i was
[1:03:30] here in canada
[1:03:31] you know
[1:03:32] some of the people that i knew there
[1:03:33] were seventh-day adventists some of my
[1:03:36] good friend my good friend who helped me
[1:03:38] come here seven day adventists from
[1:03:39] zimbabwe good guy good fella you know
[1:03:43] and uh and he lives in australia now and
[1:03:45] we connected
[1:03:46] so my only connection was in toronto was
[1:03:49] a friend of a friend and they were there
[1:03:50] seven day adventists he come he took me
[1:03:52] he said i didn't know i didn't have no
[1:03:54] connection i didn't have no family i
[1:03:55] didn't have nobody so when i came and it
[1:03:58] took me so good people
[1:04:00] nice people
[1:04:02] i can't say nothing against that god
[1:04:04] used him
[1:04:05] actually the the the the name of the the
[1:04:07] young man it's a show name but it means
[1:04:09] grace
[1:04:11] in in in african language means grace
[1:04:13] i'm like oh that was the grace of god to
[1:04:15] me
[1:04:16] you know but you know good good people
[1:04:19] but some of them you know they they of
[1:04:21] course then they they believe in the
[1:04:22] seventh-day adventists
[1:04:24] and uh and they will say but uh why is
[1:04:27] it you all don't want to
[1:04:29] honor the sabbath
[1:04:32] not directly some of them i was talking
[1:04:34] about but
[1:04:36] just the sentiment around it says you
[1:04:37] all don't honor the sabbath okay
[1:04:41] then this here goes the argument in the
[1:04:43] way of thinking they say do you believe
[1:04:45] in the rest of the ten commandments you
[1:04:47] can't say no because the bible says thou
[1:04:49] shalt not steal right
[1:04:51] you believe that yeah thou shalt not
[1:04:53] commit adultery
[1:04:54] there shall not be a false witness yeah
[1:04:56] honor your father and mother yeah you
[1:04:58] see when it comes to the sabbath why
[1:05:00] didn't you start
[1:05:02] sounds reasonable to them
[1:05:06] so the way the word of god is believed
[1:05:09] and you build on a doctrine it's not
[1:05:11] just take just a scripture and say well
[1:05:13] it is written
[1:05:15] because the devil came to jesus by it is
[1:05:17] written
[1:05:19] so there was around the message come to
[1:05:22] people with quotes
[1:05:24] so you got to la line it and make it run
[1:05:28] through all the way from the start to
[1:05:30] the finish
[1:05:33] that's why people who are reading the
[1:05:35] old testament
[1:05:36] prophet
[1:05:39] and moses
[1:05:40] would actually look at jesus and crucify
[1:05:43] him
[1:05:45] reading the scriptures that say they
[1:05:47] would crucify
[1:05:49] stand at the cross and say he
[1:05:51] saved others himself we can say not
[1:05:53] knowing that they're actually repeating
[1:05:55] a sound
[1:05:59] oh moses still
[1:06:00] told us to do this so that's not how you
[1:06:03] run
[1:06:06] you got to run it through
[1:06:08] even if you think you have come to a
[1:06:10] nugget with brother branham
[1:06:12] you got to run it through
[1:06:14] you got to see
[1:06:16] it running from 1948
[1:06:19] to 1965.
[1:06:22] you got to see sometimes the progression
[1:06:24] of the thought
[1:06:26] because sometimes he grew in
[1:06:28] understanding
[1:06:30] he said diddy yes he did
[1:06:32] he said it himself let me just give you
[1:06:34] an example
[1:06:36] one time brother branham he used to
[1:06:38] speak about
[1:06:40] body
[1:06:41] soul and spirit
[1:06:44] say you got a body and then it is soul
[1:06:47] and then you got the spirit
[1:06:49] actually when you go into the message
[1:06:52] the greatest battle ever for that's how
[1:06:54] you use it you're going to demonology
[1:06:56] that's how you go
[1:06:57] down the road somewhere he changes no
[1:07:00] it's not that
[1:07:01] it's body spirit and soul
[1:07:06] so you can run now with and say oh
[1:07:08] friends this is what brother brothers
[1:07:10] say it's body
[1:07:12] soul and spirit
[1:07:15] you can't do that
[1:07:17] he actually said himself when he started
[1:07:20] preaching way back that's not recorded
[1:07:23] in any messages but he spoke spoke it in
[1:07:26] the in the seals he says when i started
[1:07:28] preaching on the seals
[1:07:31] he says way back i said oh wow you know
[1:07:33] the first was rider white maybe that was
[1:07:36] christ
[1:07:37] he preached it says i feel like those
[1:07:39] seals in one service says 20 minutes
[1:07:41] each or something like that in 20
[1:07:42] minutes
[1:07:44] you see when god now reveals it at the
[1:07:46] opening of the seals
[1:07:48] he says it was night and day so he grew
[1:07:51] in understanding
[1:07:52] if you were sitting in the tub an
[1:07:54] alcohol when he say well the first laws
[1:07:56] writer was christ and you write that and
[1:07:58] you hold on to that
[1:08:00] well you're off
[1:08:02] i think part of it comes down from
[1:08:04] people not wanting to understand and
[1:08:07] accept that brother burnham was a man
[1:08:10] this is part of the problem in the great
[1:08:12] falling away in the message today
[1:08:15] because you see a deity spirit goes
[1:08:18] forth and tells people brother burnham
[1:08:20] is infallible brother adam don't make
[1:08:22] mistakes which is not correct because he
[1:08:25] says i've made many mistakes
[1:08:27] just type mistakes in the info base
[1:08:29] you'll see him say it
[1:08:31] oh you think he's lying
[1:08:33] you think
[1:08:35] some people say it's being humble you
[1:08:36] think that being humble
[1:08:38] he says i have made mistakes
[1:08:41] actually as long as he live on the earth
[1:08:44] he'll make mistakes he went to south
[1:08:46] africa the people pulled him and and
[1:08:48] after that he got sick with amoeba in
[1:08:50] the stomach because he didn't listen to
[1:08:53] god
[1:08:54] mistakes human beings make mistakes
[1:08:58] you have to separate the men from the
[1:09:00] office you say how do you do it well god
[1:09:03] will help you
[1:09:05] god will help you
[1:09:07] just like but better than you have to
[1:09:09] separate the office the pastor
[1:09:11] and and and the man
[1:09:15] part of the the thing especially for
[1:09:17] family is sometimes to separate the
[1:09:19] father and the pastor
[1:09:22] so you got to say god help me
[1:09:24] to do it because your first relationship
[1:09:26] with him is not as a pastor as a father
[1:09:29] one time brother branham speaking to
[1:09:31] sister nader when he was uh
[1:09:34] talking about you know his daughter
[1:09:36] rebecca and stuff like that and she was
[1:09:38] a teenager and so on and she began to
[1:09:39] miss bf and brother branham says you
[1:09:42] know what this is what we do honey and
[1:09:44] and and systematically since what my
[1:09:46] daughter going on like like that he says
[1:09:48] no no no no no no no no
[1:09:51] after a while brother brandon says
[1:09:52] listen honey
[1:09:54] he is nothing he says listen honey
[1:09:56] people come from all over the world to
[1:09:58] hear this gift
[1:10:00] in other words
[1:10:01] essentially to me what he was saying to
[1:10:03] her is like
[1:10:04] now i'm speaking to you as a prophet
[1:10:07] now there's your husband
[1:10:09] she come down she listened thank god
[1:10:12] he says next time she does that instead
[1:10:14] of you getting upset and stuff like that
[1:10:16] just say it's okay and stuff like that
[1:10:19] he she done exactly that and the result
[1:10:21] came
[1:10:22] so you got to have that understanding of
[1:10:25] the ability to separate
[1:10:28] it wasn't god that told moses to smite
[1:10:31] the rock
[1:10:33] it was moses mistake that actually kept
[1:10:36] him from his land
[1:10:38] you're gonna follow that and say moses
[1:10:40] smote the rock when god told him to
[1:10:42] speak it so i'm going to smite the rock
[1:10:43] that's not how you do it
[1:10:45] you say well he made a mistake that
[1:10:47] doesn't take him away from being a
[1:10:49] servant of god
[1:10:51] but that
[1:10:52] the bible put it this way that no flesh
[1:10:54] should glory in the sight of god
[1:10:58] when the proclamation went through
[1:11:00] heaven he says no man was found
[1:11:03] in the book
[1:11:05] you know when that proclamation was
[1:11:07] going enoch had been raptured
[1:11:09] moses said god
[1:11:11] elijah had been raptured
[1:11:13] all those people were already in the
[1:11:15] past tense they had already lived great
[1:11:17] lives abraham had actually been
[1:11:20] resurrected you know all the old
[1:11:22] testament saints they were resurrected
[1:11:23] when jesus christ rose from the dead and
[1:11:26] even the resurrected saints no man was
[1:11:29] found worthy to open the book
[1:11:32] so brother branham is not jesus christ
[1:11:37] brother branham is the servant of christ
[1:11:41] so the day the spirit comes in the
[1:11:43] message and get upset when you say
[1:11:45] brother branham was a man
[1:11:47] if your spirit is upset with that it
[1:11:50] needs to be upset
[1:11:55] we better lay down
[1:11:58] it needs to be upset because you are in
[1:12:02] danger of idolatry
[1:12:06] one time you know in the days of
[1:12:08] hezekiah
[1:12:10] oh praise god i'm gonna put that down in
[1:12:13] the days of hezekiah you know what they
[1:12:15] did in the e
[1:12:17] there was the present second
[1:12:20] the present second that that moses had
[1:12:24] laid everybody knows the president
[1:12:25] happened when everybody was beaten
[1:12:28] they would go and look serpent and they
[1:12:30] they would be made whole
[1:12:32] in the days of hezekiah he came down
[1:12:36] because people begin to idolize it
[1:12:39] go and read it
[1:12:41] hezekiah's reforms he tells you to tone
[1:12:44] it down
[1:12:45] we need to tear down this idolatrous
[1:12:49] picture of brother branham build a round
[1:12:51] message because it's not producing
[1:12:53] better christians it's not producing
[1:12:55] people with victory it's not doing
[1:12:58] nothing it is calling cause the great
[1:13:00] falling away in the message
[1:13:02] because soon people are smart enough we
[1:13:05] live in the age of internet where people
[1:13:07] can search for things after a while they
[1:13:09] realize that oh yeah brother branham
[1:13:11] that statement is not factually correct
[1:13:13] because this is the fact so some people
[1:13:15] going on into a completely upset thing
[1:13:18] and say
[1:13:19] oh wow
[1:13:20] it's both correct
[1:13:22] hear this story it's not a joke because
[1:13:24] a minister told me because it happened
[1:13:27] he dealt with a man who said brother
[1:13:28] param don't make mistakes
[1:13:31] so he says okay fine all right i've
[1:13:33] dealt with those kind of people before
[1:13:35] so it's not the first time
[1:13:37] i found it strange like are you gonna
[1:13:40] say that the man say he made mistakes
[1:13:42] are you gonna say that
[1:13:44] but anyway
[1:13:47] hindi actually at that time when the
[1:13:48] person said that to me i'm like let me
[1:13:50] go and say put mistakes
[1:13:53] and i'm like you know what
[1:13:55] some people when they set their mind
[1:13:57] you just have to leave them you know
[1:14:00] what the people said one time he said
[1:14:01] ibrahim is joined to his idols leave it
[1:14:04] alone
[1:14:06] god speaks to you and speaks to you if
[1:14:09] you continue resisting and fighting well
[1:14:11] the spirit of god
[1:14:12] moves and you remain tied to your idol
[1:14:17] you no more can hear the word of god
[1:14:19] after jesus died rose and crucified you
[1:14:23] know they continued with the worship in
[1:14:24] the temple you know they continued with
[1:14:26] sacrifices
[1:14:28] they continued until titans raised it
[1:14:30] down
[1:14:31] so for the next 40 years they were
[1:14:33] saying yahweh yahweh yahweh and thinking
[1:14:36] they are praising god not knowing that
[1:14:38] the spirit of god had moved on
[1:14:42] that's what happened to samson he
[1:14:44] continued tempting god the bible said he
[1:14:46] knew not he was not that the spirit had
[1:14:48] departed from it
[1:14:51] so we are speaking to spirits it's not
[1:14:54] people
[1:14:55] so now people go on and search and say
[1:14:58] wow but there's this mistakes there's
[1:15:00] these facts that's mixed with this
[1:15:02] there's this and that and stuff so put
[1:15:05] it together and make it sense
[1:15:08] make it make sense oh it's okay it's all
[1:15:11] correct the person saying i'm not
[1:15:12] talking to neighbor people
[1:15:15] after a while
[1:15:16] then because they probably never
[1:15:18] converted next thing they offended in
[1:15:20] the message
[1:15:23] the problem wasn't the message
[1:15:25] the problem is that they were given a
[1:15:27] false picture of who black means
[1:15:34] so the man came to to to to to to the
[1:15:37] brother he says well because but the
[1:15:39] branham said
[1:15:40] oh and moses built an ark
[1:15:43] he says okay what you gonna say about
[1:15:44] that then
[1:15:48] see what you're gonna say about that
[1:15:49] then he thought well you got him maybe
[1:15:51] he'll help him to change
[1:15:56] he said the man
[1:15:58] say to him
[1:16:01] well
[1:16:02] maybe noah's middle name was moses
[1:16:10] it's almost like a hopless situation
[1:16:13] but the spirit of god will not always
[1:16:14] strive with man
[1:16:21] upon that i like to lay a background
[1:16:23] because
[1:16:24] my subject
[1:16:25] is make your calling and election show
[1:16:28] make your calling and the election sure
[1:16:31] and for that we're gonna read second
[1:16:32] peter two
[1:16:34] no second peter one sorry
[1:16:37] it's 9 11 because that's why we are
[1:16:39] drawing our text i got a few scriptures
[1:16:41] we're gonna just move and see how the
[1:16:42] spirit leads and then we stop wherever
[1:16:44] we stop so pull for yourself what you
[1:16:47] have need of but my my encouragement to
[1:16:49] you is that go and study these things
[1:16:52] for yourself
[1:16:54] go and search the message
[1:16:56] go and search the scriptures
[1:16:58] for in them you think you have a certain
[1:17:00] understanding but they are the ones that
[1:17:02] testify of these things
[1:17:05] he says
[1:17:07] but he that liked these things is blind
[1:17:10] it's these things that they are talking
[1:17:11] about
[1:17:12] you know
[1:17:13] faith future knowledge and so on
[1:17:15] and cannot see affair off
[1:17:18] and had forgotten that he was purged
[1:17:20] from his old sins
[1:17:22] first
[1:17:23] wherefore
[1:17:25] the radha brethren
[1:17:28] give diligence
[1:17:30] to make your calling and election sure
[1:17:35] god wants us to make our calling and the
[1:17:37] election show
[1:17:39] for if you do these things you shall
[1:17:42] never fall for so an entrance shall be
[1:17:45] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:17:48] everlasting kingdom of our lord and
[1:17:50] savior jesus christ thank you jesus for
[1:17:52] the god as we just go into this
[1:17:54] scripture and lay down it background
[1:17:56] pray lord for the god that he stopped my
[1:17:59] mouth to the things that you don't want
[1:18:00] spoken and let it speak the things that
[1:18:03] you want spoken in jesus christ's name
[1:18:05] amen
[1:18:06] you may take your seed some of the
[1:18:07] scriptures we may go into
[1:18:10] when when when we are seated let's go to
[1:18:12] galatians i hadn't printed that so i'm
[1:18:15] going to rely on the screen galatians 5
[1:18:18] 19-23
[1:18:20] we want to put it together
[1:18:23] colossians 5 19-23
[1:18:32] it says
[1:18:34] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[1:18:36] which are these
[1:18:39] adultery
[1:18:42] fornication
[1:18:45] uncleanness
[1:18:46] lasciviousness just stay there for now
[1:18:51] this is why the gospel is preached
[1:18:56] because each one of us that comes into
[1:18:58] this world we are born in sin
[1:19:01] we are shaped iniquity
[1:19:03] we come to the world speaking lies
[1:19:05] it doesn't even matter that we were born
[1:19:07] in the message
[1:19:10] we as individuals have to come to our
[1:19:13] own personal transaction with god
[1:19:16] no nothing wrong being born in the
[1:19:18] message it's actually an advantage
[1:19:20] you see that means god you know was
[1:19:23] gracious to you
[1:19:24] you know you were born under a certain
[1:19:26] atmosphere and stuff like that but still
[1:19:28] that doesn't take away that
[1:19:30] well as a person you're born
[1:19:33] a sinner by nature
[1:19:36] the nature of sin we are not talking
[1:19:38] about as a child you don't commit to
[1:19:40] anything children die and go into the
[1:19:42] presence of the lord that's what brother
[1:19:44] branham teaches us
[1:19:45] but the thing about it the nature of sin
[1:19:48] is inside of us by birth
[1:19:51] and it is that nature of sin that if
[1:19:53] it's not changed by the time we become
[1:19:56] adults it becomes
[1:19:59] adultery
[1:20:01] married people
[1:20:03] you know going into relationships
[1:20:05] oh it's like it's normal
[1:20:10] it's almost like it's nothing
[1:20:16] fornication it's so it's almost like oh
[1:20:19] yeah yeah yeah by the time people get
[1:20:21] married they've slept with dozens of
[1:20:23] people
[1:20:24] it's like it's nothing
[1:20:27] well whilst that has been expected kind
[1:20:30] of in the world because they are sinners
[1:20:33] or in denominations well because they
[1:20:35] got watered down
[1:20:37] the sad thing when you begin to see that
[1:20:39] around message circles
[1:20:44] and the people are set aside by saying
[1:20:46] brother banham said
[1:20:49] yet their life is full of adultery
[1:20:52] wickedness
[1:20:57] fornications young people i'm talking to
[1:21:00] the young people
[1:21:01] oh adultery is for all the people who
[1:21:03] are married
[1:21:07] god is holy
[1:21:11] i still believe in an older
[1:21:14] holy gospel
[1:21:16] holiness gospel
[1:21:20] the message did not come to take
[1:21:22] holiness out of the church
[1:21:27] just like you can't take sanctification
[1:21:29] justification out of the church you
[1:21:31] can't take sanctification
[1:21:34] but well with the coming of the message
[1:21:36] it was plus
[1:21:38] because the message the falling away
[1:21:41] from the day of pentecost but the banham
[1:21:43] talks about you know those those those
[1:21:46] those creatures eating out i think but
[1:21:47] the jim was talking about that yesterday
[1:21:49] or something and those creatures eating
[1:21:51] out
[1:21:52] and eating out
[1:21:53] and
[1:21:54] by the time of the dark ages the church
[1:21:57] was a shadow of itself
[1:21:59] that's why in the time of look that god
[1:22:02] began to restore
[1:22:04] but he didn't do it in one blast
[1:22:08] he started with luther the fifth
[1:22:09] messenger and dropped down the truth of
[1:22:12] justification but there was still a lot
[1:22:14] of error that he didn't understand
[1:22:16] it didn't make him a bad person he was
[1:22:19] living in the revelation that was given
[1:22:20] to him
[1:22:21] then say yeah it's okay
[1:22:24] wesley we say he breathes sanctification
[1:22:26] but let me correct you a little bit
[1:22:28] leslie preach justification and
[1:22:29] sanctification
[1:22:31] he put away justification
[1:22:33] he says well you need to give your life
[1:22:35] to the lord
[1:22:36] but after that you need god to clean you
[1:22:39] out of bad habits
[1:22:40] because luther smoked the pipe you say
[1:22:42] well you need to be clean from all those
[1:22:44] unclean habits so you begin to pump away
[1:22:47] with sanctification pump away with
[1:22:49] sanctification well when he was gone by
[1:22:51] the venom you can go through that
[1:22:53] restoration of the bride tree when he
[1:22:55] was god you know
[1:22:57] well people organized and say he's a
[1:22:59] methodical man they build a denomination
[1:23:01] around it
[1:23:02] just like they build a denomination
[1:23:04] around luther
[1:23:05] oh god is not working in denominations
[1:23:07] god is working with individuals so the
[1:23:09] spirit of god moved on
[1:23:12] then you come to azusa street
[1:23:16] i'll tell you why i called it azusa
[1:23:17] street
[1:23:19] enter into another confusion again in
[1:23:21] the message
[1:23:23] because azusa street called themselves
[1:23:25] pentecostal
[1:23:27] that's what they called themselves
[1:23:29] but if you read in the church ages but
[1:23:31] the banham put it this way it says well
[1:23:33] that wasn't the true restoration of
[1:23:35] pentecost
[1:23:36] that was the restoration of the gates
[1:23:38] because in order to restore the fullness
[1:23:41] of pentecost you must need a word
[1:23:43] restoration
[1:23:45] the original pentecost was the full word
[1:23:48] because the church started with the full
[1:23:50] word on the day of pentecost and then
[1:23:52] after a while era creeped into the
[1:23:54] church and started eating away eating
[1:23:56] away then it went into the dark ages
[1:23:59] when god was now restoring when azusa
[1:24:02] street come with the restoration of the
[1:24:04] gifts which was the leaves
[1:24:07] the leaves right
[1:24:09] people know that that was the least so
[1:24:11] there was a lot of shouting there was a
[1:24:12] lot of clapping and stuff like that
[1:24:15] well they call it pentecost because they
[1:24:17] thought the original pentecost was gone
[1:24:19] but when we come now with the revelation
[1:24:22] of the message understanding no it
[1:24:24] wasn't the fullness of pentecost as they
[1:24:27] thought it was just the restoration of
[1:24:29] the gifts so the true original people of
[1:24:32] azusa street believed justification
[1:24:35] sanctification and the restoration of
[1:24:37] the gift
[1:24:39] but they called it pentecost which
[1:24:42] creates a confusion
[1:24:45] that became their denominational name
[1:24:48] after a while
[1:24:51] why are you saying that we are laying
[1:24:53] down a background
[1:24:55] because
[1:24:57] you got to understand somebody the way
[1:24:59] they use words
[1:25:02] you don't think people
[1:25:03] for
[1:25:05] what you think you take people for what
[1:25:07] they mean
[1:25:09] because words are used differently
[1:25:12] let me just give you an example
[1:25:15] when i one of the first things that one
[1:25:17] of the things that happened when i came
[1:25:18] here
[1:25:19] i found this
[1:25:22] somebody was about to bump me i'm
[1:25:24] looking this way let's say and they are
[1:25:25] walking behind me they're about to bump
[1:25:27] me
[1:25:28] they watch out
[1:25:30] i didn't say nothing i said to myself
[1:25:32] what rudeness is that
[1:25:34] you watch me yeah
[1:25:36] i'm the one standing here and you're the
[1:25:37] one almost bumping me in they're telling
[1:25:39] me to watch out
[1:25:40] but after a while i realized no it's not
[1:25:42] a rude thing
[1:25:46] but in my way of thinking like how
[1:25:49] you almost bumped me and you say
[1:25:53] no i can't go on and say that person was
[1:25:55] being rude to me
[1:25:57] i got to take them for what they mean
[1:26:03] brother but i'm here to use words to
[1:26:05] convey me
[1:26:08] that's why sometimes by the bottom you
[1:26:11] hear him say and say away
[1:26:13] with a pentecostal these come
[1:26:15] pentecostal bowsers and stuff like that
[1:26:17] well he's talking to people who have
[1:26:19] organized himself become a denomination
[1:26:21] called pentecost then you'll hear him
[1:26:24] flip around his pentecostal from the top
[1:26:26] of my head to the crowd to the soul of
[1:26:28] my feet
[1:26:30] well you can't just run and say wow wow
[1:26:33] yeah and i see that a lot in the message
[1:26:35] ah yeah the pentecostals the pentecostal
[1:26:38] well he can't speak against the day of
[1:26:40] pentacles because he'll be speaking
[1:26:42] against the word
[1:26:44] but he can speak against the dino that
[1:26:47] calls himself pentecost so when you are
[1:26:49] reading now in the message you got to
[1:26:51] put your mind from me and say oh when
[1:26:53] he's speaking like this is he referring
[1:26:56] to pentecostal denomination or is he
[1:26:58] referring to
[1:27:00] a d-33
[1:27:03] well if we are wrong then we might as
[1:27:05] well stop uh the song we were singing it
[1:27:08] says here it says greta is he that is in
[1:27:11] me he says on the day of pentecost
[1:27:14] we might as well if pentecost is wrong
[1:27:15] might as well stop singing that
[1:27:17] we know that's not him
[1:27:19] so everything in the world has to be
[1:27:22] rightly divided
[1:27:25] the devil is a religious man
[1:27:29] the devil came to jesus and say it is
[1:27:31] written
[1:27:37] so don't run off with a court
[1:27:39] follow the thought
[1:27:43] then if you find quotes that sounds like
[1:27:46] wow it's a bit contradictory
[1:27:48] it may not be as you think
[1:27:51] then stop
[1:27:53] pray
[1:27:54] and say god caused this to make sense to
[1:27:57] me
[1:27:58] because if you run off like that you
[1:28:00] don't understand it good enough you may
[1:28:02] run off a tangent
[1:28:04] you end up with a car eating grass on
[1:28:07] top of a tree that's brother branham's
[1:28:09] example you got to put he said the bible
[1:28:11] is like a jigsaw puzzle
[1:28:13] he says he says forgive me sounds
[1:28:15] secretly just he says you got to put
[1:28:17] that peace you got to put that piece
[1:28:19] together you got to put that piece
[1:28:20] together then you have the full picture
[1:28:23] and he says if you read
[1:28:25] every scripture in the bible and don't
[1:28:27] see jesus christ read it again
[1:28:31] he said that i'm quoting these things
[1:28:33] you can reference you can go back he can
[1:28:35] search
[1:28:36] thank god we know you know i i think you
[1:28:38] know
[1:28:39] but they'll say he was talking about how
[1:28:41] you know you came in the in the to to
[1:28:43] the message in the 80s is it
[1:28:45] right and and and as i'm talking here
[1:28:47] brother there i'm thinking like well
[1:28:49] back then man
[1:28:50] if you say brother ban says you hit
[1:28:54] and then you got to read it
[1:28:56] because then someone can ask you and say
[1:28:58] where is it and if you forgot the book
[1:29:00] you sound like you're lying
[1:29:04] the good thing what i say you can
[1:29:07] search in the
[1:29:08] app friends as much as we celebrate that
[1:29:11] the bible say to whom more is given more
[1:29:14] is required
[1:29:15] so you must make the diligence
[1:29:18] search the quotes for yourself
[1:29:20] make your calling and election sure and
[1:29:23] they verify whether these things be fall
[1:29:25] because once you hate you're accountable
[1:29:28] to god
[1:29:29] that's how god works
[1:29:32] hallelujah
[1:29:36] brother banham he put it this way
[1:29:41] you know what let's let's let's let's
[1:29:43] let's
[1:29:44] fornication
[1:29:46] uncleanliness lasciviousness let's go on
[1:29:49] to the next one i just want to lay that
[1:29:51] that that that that out of the way then
[1:29:53] we can go idolatry
[1:29:55] witchcraft
[1:29:58] today people say oh yeah yeah well we
[1:30:00] don't have witchcraft here well the
[1:30:02] bible says rebellion is the scene of
[1:30:04] witchcraft so if you cause rebellion and
[1:30:07] confusion in this church you got a
[1:30:08] witchcraft spirit
[1:30:10] if you cause
[1:30:12] separation it's a witchcraft spirit
[1:30:14] you may not actually take a thing and do
[1:30:16] enchantments or whatever which is do but
[1:30:19] that that that would be that i'm not
[1:30:20] saying it doesn't happen it happens
[1:30:21] people do those things too definitely
[1:30:24] they do well you just have to to come go
[1:30:26] to some of these places
[1:30:31] even here i met people with witchcraft
[1:30:37] i feel like going there
[1:30:39] i did in canada
[1:30:42] and god showed me
[1:30:44] not only god who showed me it was
[1:30:46] confirmed the person confirmed it
[1:30:50] when i asked him afterwards i'm like
[1:30:51] what's the funny spirit around this
[1:30:53] person they were supposed to supervise
[1:30:54] me for some pro something that i was
[1:30:56] doing
[1:30:58] and and
[1:30:59] and after i went there in the in the
[1:31:00] hospital was just
[1:31:02] crashing
[1:31:04] and do you know what i had done but the
[1:31:05] bernard i'll tell you what they've done
[1:31:08] i had been dealing with these government
[1:31:09] people
[1:31:10] and and and and and they they sent me
[1:31:14] to to
[1:31:15] to it was uh something to do with the
[1:31:17] employment ontario because because
[1:31:18] because i was transitioning before
[1:31:20] between jobs and they were training and
[1:31:22] stuff like that so they have all these
[1:31:24] centers that are supposed to help you so
[1:31:26] i went to the first center and i was
[1:31:28] dealing first with this indian lady
[1:31:30] sorry you know i there's nothing against
[1:31:32] indian people nothing like that i'm just
[1:31:34] saying the way it is i gotta just say
[1:31:36] the way it happened and the end and the
[1:31:39] and uh whilst i was doing that i feel
[1:31:41] like irish spirit
[1:31:43] and and god is just working with inside
[1:31:46] of me i'm like oh okay that's an eerie
[1:31:48] spirit that's a witchcraft spirit and i
[1:31:50] could descend i'm like you know what i
[1:31:52] got the option to go to another center i
[1:31:53] can't do that so i walked away
[1:31:57] i walked away
[1:32:00] and then when i walked away i started
[1:32:01] the program the way that i wanted
[1:32:03] everything is going fine when the
[1:32:05] program is about to wind down
[1:32:08] they say wow when it winds down we're
[1:32:10] gonna because they were giving us
[1:32:12] support so well you got to be
[1:32:13] accountable so i'm talking financial
[1:32:15] support
[1:32:16] you know because we i was working
[1:32:18] establishing a small business and stuff
[1:32:20] like that so the structures of support
[1:32:22] so you got to be accountable because
[1:32:23] you're getting their money so they they
[1:32:25] say okay so you're gonna have a
[1:32:27] supervisor to supervise you after a gun
[1:32:29] this woman who had just started
[1:32:32] helping us with the the program in my
[1:32:34] spirit i just like yuri and sometimes
[1:32:37] he'll come with these rings and stuff
[1:32:38] like i'm done
[1:32:39] fully dressed in it she was a white lady
[1:32:42] again i don't mean nothing
[1:32:44] so that you know that these things are
[1:32:46] everywhere
[1:32:47] so and she'll come drink just like
[1:32:50] better than what i've seen sisters do
[1:32:53] and the but they hear you spirit
[1:32:56] and i'm like wow
[1:32:58] i'm like man this is in here it's great
[1:33:00] what's going on i'm like i'm going to
[1:33:02] the program courtney this is me talking
[1:33:04] to myself and i'm telling him take off
[1:33:06] this person i'm i want a different
[1:33:09] supervisor
[1:33:11] then when i was about to do that
[1:33:14] i felt the spirit of god check me
[1:33:17] you are repeating the same cycle that's
[1:33:19] what you just did
[1:33:21] so i stopped i'm like lord what is it
[1:33:23] you want me to learn out of this
[1:33:24] experience
[1:33:28] so
[1:33:29] stupid me i'm and you know look because
[1:33:31] you can't just start saying oh i feel in
[1:33:33] my spirit that's a witch and you run off
[1:33:35] with that it got to be prophet
[1:33:38] because the devil isn't accused of the
[1:33:40] brethren
[1:33:42] so don't yeah i feel this i feel led how
[1:33:44] many times we feel led and then after a
[1:33:46] while we find that no it wasn't a good
[1:33:48] leading
[1:33:51] i went to to that woman's office after
[1:33:54] the so bottom line i i didn't walk away
[1:33:56] i'm like god i'm just gonna go through
[1:33:58] that because if i walk away again i'm
[1:34:00] gonna come back to the same lesson
[1:34:02] so uh when i come
[1:34:04] down to that dealing
[1:34:07] we we we we we with that we we
[1:34:09] that woman i started talking and she
[1:34:10] said it was christmas time he said do
[1:34:12] you celebrate christmas
[1:34:14] i didn't know exactly how to answer i
[1:34:16] think i said kind of not really because
[1:34:18] you know you're trying to find who
[1:34:19] you're talking to because people when
[1:34:21] they celebrate christmas you know when
[1:34:24] they are sinners if i'm talking to a
[1:34:26] message person maybe i could answer
[1:34:28] easily
[1:34:29] you know so i say i say kind of but not
[1:34:31] exactly she says yeah i don't i don't
[1:34:34] celebrate christmas it says oh really
[1:34:36] what do you do or something they should
[1:34:38] give me a name i can't remember it off
[1:34:39] my head now
[1:34:41] i said what's that
[1:34:42] then she explained a little thing after
[1:34:44] i was gone i'm like that's strange i saw
[1:34:46] i went
[1:34:48] i i wrote the word i think i'd ask for
[1:34:50] the spelling i wear that and i googled
[1:34:52] it
[1:34:53] after i was gone
[1:34:55] and this
[1:34:56] man witchcraft stuff
[1:34:59] i'm like wow so he's true lord
[1:35:02] that's what i'm dealing with
[1:35:05] but what god wanted me to do
[1:35:09] but then that he wanted me to separate
[1:35:13] the person from the spirit
[1:35:18] i was looking at it wrong i was praying
[1:35:21] wrong
[1:35:23] when i was able to separate the person
[1:35:26] from the spirit then i started praying
[1:35:28] sincerely my heart for your salvation
[1:35:30] because before i just was
[1:35:33] disgusted both with person spirit i
[1:35:35] don't care i just don't want nothing to
[1:35:37] do
[1:35:39] and god said oh
[1:35:40] i prayed for it sincerely from my heart
[1:35:44] do you know what happened as soon as i
[1:35:46] had had that victory immediately
[1:35:50] he changes she became the newest person
[1:35:51] too
[1:35:56] see
[1:36:02] sometimes that's what it is friends
[1:36:05] you look at people they're giving so
[1:36:07] much trouble in the church and stuff
[1:36:09] like that or we get disgusted we think
[1:36:11] like ah this person is trouble sometimes
[1:36:13] they think that they just need god wants
[1:36:15] us to come in our heart with such a love
[1:36:18] towards that person
[1:36:20] and god will change them
[1:36:23] when finally we've done that god i don't
[1:36:25] know whether she got saved or what but
[1:36:26] at least she changed her behavior
[1:36:28] towards me
[1:36:29] and god was preparing me with that
[1:36:32] experience to deal with some
[1:36:36] and may i just put enough to this that
[1:36:39] something greater was hooked on to the
[1:36:41] salvation of my wife so i am taught
[1:36:43] nancy stories
[1:36:48] we speak spiritual things we fight
[1:36:51] spiritual battles
[1:36:54] oh friends when it comes to this time
[1:36:58] i ain't coming just to to feel good
[1:37:02] i i'm coming for souls even if it's one
[1:37:05] soul
[1:37:06] it's okay jesus christ preached to one
[1:37:09] person like he's preaching to multitudes
[1:37:12] you say did he yes he sent all the
[1:37:15] preachers in the city to buy bread and
[1:37:17] he preached to a woman that was living
[1:37:19] on husband number six
[1:37:21] and he didn't diminish his preaching he
[1:37:24] didn't make it smaller he didn't preach
[1:37:26] less
[1:37:27] he preached exactly like his preaching
[1:37:30] one time oh my but the man he he went
[1:37:34] into the tombs he takes he took with him
[1:37:36] 12 riches and if you ask jesus christ
[1:37:39] that they say where are we having church
[1:37:41] pastor jesus he said we are having it in
[1:37:43] the tombs because there's a man called
[1:37:45] legion hallelujah it wasn't about forms
[1:37:48] and ceremonies he was about the
[1:37:50] deliverance of souls
[1:37:52] so when we come to church the focus is
[1:37:55] to be souls if there is one soul that's
[1:37:57] still bound hallelujah we ain't living
[1:38:00] hoof we end leaving nothing behind we
[1:38:03] must all join together with your pastor
[1:38:06] with raised brethren of precious faith
[1:38:09] so the souls are saved
[1:38:13] so these things sometimes mean the
[1:38:16] deliverance of your loved ones
[1:38:21] yes
[1:38:23] years before my wife got saved you know
[1:38:27] she was in england i was here dealing
[1:38:29] with immigration things then finally she
[1:38:30] joined we were separate in that respect
[1:38:33] wow
[1:38:34] the message took a hold of me he i heard
[1:38:37] the message when i was about but he took
[1:38:38] a hold of me here
[1:38:40] you know anyway long story short when
[1:38:43] god had come into my life
[1:38:45] and finally
[1:38:47] converted me by a supernatural
[1:38:48] experience and things started happening
[1:38:51] behind around me now all of a sudden
[1:38:53] talking to my wife about jesus and stuff
[1:38:55] like things that i never really used to
[1:38:57] speak but therefore here to see me so
[1:38:59] you could imagine like what are you
[1:39:01] saying
[1:39:02] what are you saying oh you don't want to
[1:39:04] be with me anymore what no no no no
[1:39:07] those things and whilst that's all going
[1:39:10] finally i pressed on
[1:39:12] god said to me pray for her to enter
[1:39:15] into the kingdom before christmas she
[1:39:17] wasn't
[1:39:23] glory to god
[1:39:24] and i started praying
[1:39:26] she's she was she was still in england i
[1:39:28] pray i says okay you know when god tells
[1:39:31] you these things and you are new you
[1:39:32] think like oh come christmas day or come
[1:39:34] before christmas said you say praise the
[1:39:36] lord and give my life to the lord
[1:39:39] that's what i was looking for i prayed
[1:39:43] finally long story short i had a
[1:39:44] breakthrough in the spirit
[1:39:46] i knew something had happened i'm
[1:39:48] looking i'm like lord what's
[1:39:50] what's happening
[1:39:52] i ain't seeing the changes he says no
[1:39:54] we have had the victory in the spirit
[1:39:56] now watch for the manifestation
[1:40:03] and one time i was walking in the in
[1:40:05] toronto and i'm walking led by the
[1:40:07] spirit and as i was walking my thoughts
[1:40:10] and my prayers way upon my wife and
[1:40:13] stuff like that about her salvation and
[1:40:15] stuff like that whilst that's all
[1:40:17] ongoing what's that all unfolding and
[1:40:20] stuff like that
[1:40:22] i begin to walk by a creek it was
[1:40:24] actually in the evening time because
[1:40:26] that's how it unfolded and i'm walking
[1:40:28] by a little creek in the park and stuff
[1:40:30] like that and i stop and the spirit of
[1:40:33] god says
[1:40:34] the water you're looking at right now
[1:40:37] signifies a baptism
[1:40:40] this is before she ever set
[1:40:42] foot in canada
[1:40:44] this is when she's still wearing pants
[1:40:49] no i'm not shaming my wife
[1:40:51] she knows that
[1:40:53] you know i'm just giving a reference the
[1:40:55] word is sent forth to deliver us
[1:41:00] when all that had happened and i stopped
[1:41:02] in my mind i'm like i can't understand
[1:41:04] this lord do you mean i'm going to come
[1:41:06] to this creek and baptize there
[1:41:08] you know i i linked up there for a while
[1:41:10] i linger linga then i walked on i
[1:41:13] realized the spirit of god says you got
[1:41:15] to move on i begin to move on and as i
[1:41:18] begin to move on i'm seeing things in
[1:41:20] the city and stuff like that i've been
[1:41:21] listening to
[1:41:23] to to to the bible as i was walking but
[1:41:24] i was walking in the spirit
[1:41:27] as i'm walking in the spirit i see a
[1:41:29] billboard i see that he says oh that's
[1:41:32] the last thing for her to be delivered
[1:41:33] from spirit of tv
[1:41:36] television
[1:41:37] i'm like okay i'm gonna see that
[1:41:40] as i see that i'm tired now because i've
[1:41:42] been walking for a little while
[1:41:44] and believe it or not friends i came to
[1:41:46] a street
[1:41:47] in toronto
[1:41:49] it's it's expelled i'll give the
[1:41:50] spelling to you w-a-k-u-n-d-a
[1:41:54] street wakunder street
[1:41:58] i kid you not
[1:42:00] that word in my language means you have
[1:42:04] the victory
[1:42:07] i stopped i'm like what
[1:42:09] what am i saying here i stopped i'm like
[1:42:13] is this a sign or something
[1:42:16] this is before nothing has ever happened
[1:42:19] as i stop there and i'm contemplating
[1:42:22] and i'm tired and i'm saying okay i'm
[1:42:24] gonna go on to the next street and then
[1:42:26] i'll take the bus home because i'm tired
[1:42:28] now you know i've been walking while
[1:42:29] i've been in space and stuff like that
[1:42:31] god has been speaking to me for the
[1:42:33] salvation of us all right
[1:42:39] as i reach there and i'm thinking
[1:42:41] wakunda
[1:42:44] means
[1:42:45] here's the victory god says
[1:42:48] look look at since
[1:42:50] he says what what's what's that
[1:42:52] another street sunrise i'm like that's
[1:42:54] strange just around the
[1:42:56] i'm not getting my meaning that
[1:42:58] whilst i'm thinking imagine that the
[1:43:00] street i'm supposed
[1:43:02] to get into to go home it's called
[1:43:03] victoria street
[1:43:07] hallelujah
[1:43:09] this is before she ever set a foot in
[1:43:11] canada
[1:43:14] bottom line i saw the story unfold so
[1:43:18] when she came to be baptized here then
[1:43:20] god began to show that oh no it simply
[1:43:22] means i was showing you signs there's
[1:43:24] signs and wonders around you all the
[1:43:26] time
[1:43:28] she walked and there was such a fight
[1:43:29] she could tell you the day she got
[1:43:31] baptized it's such a fight like it
[1:43:33] wasn't gonna happen and stuff like i
[1:43:35] never pushed her she could tell you when
[1:43:37] she come came and says here honey i go
[1:43:39] to church you know i become a christian
[1:43:41] i go mondays i go you know sometimes
[1:43:43] fridays prayer meetings and i go sundays
[1:43:45] not mondays wednesdays sunday wednesdays
[1:43:47] and fridays you know i said that's what
[1:43:49] they do i say if you want you come to
[1:43:51] with me if you want to stay home
[1:43:54] and that's what i said that's what i
[1:43:56] said not that i didn't want you to come
[1:43:58] to church but you can't force this thing
[1:43:59] or nobody
[1:44:01] the gospel is a convention of conviction
[1:44:05] and i seen him walk up and get baptized
[1:44:09] you know i guess but
[1:44:10] god bless but the dale god gave me a
[1:44:12] little bit of connection there you know
[1:44:14] so these things are dear to my heart you
[1:44:16] know she got baptized
[1:44:18] and down the road she can testify we're
[1:44:20] not going to get into that
[1:44:22] but but but but she got converted she
[1:44:25] got filled with the holy spirit she gave
[1:44:27] he gave a life to the lord all those
[1:44:29] things unfolded
[1:44:32] so to me when i'm preaching these things
[1:44:35] i'm preaching personally i might not
[1:44:37] give that testimony word for word i hate
[1:44:39] it the last time i came but that's not
[1:44:41] how the spirit of god led you know so
[1:44:43] you are targeting souls
[1:44:47] way before that after my conversion
[1:44:50] after god filled me with the holy spirit
[1:44:53] he came forth the spirit of god was
[1:44:56] dealing with me you know yeah in the
[1:44:57] hallelujahs you know you know sometimes
[1:45:00] we get a little cold you know
[1:45:02] in the end the holidays i'm so glad i
[1:45:04] can say i'm one of them i'm singing i'm
[1:45:07] going to work it's all singing and all
[1:45:09] the spirit of god overweight i begin to
[1:45:11] talk to somebody i'm prophesying to them
[1:45:13] i don't even know they say how do you
[1:45:15] know those things i'm like wow what's
[1:45:17] happening to me i'm selling the
[1:45:18] hallelujahs
[1:45:20] right and you feel like men are gonna
[1:45:22] tear everything up
[1:45:25] that's how you feel
[1:45:26] but uh of course then god will teach you
[1:45:28] patience will teach you patients way
[1:45:31] before she ever came
[1:45:33] into canada god spoke to me and said you
[1:45:36] shall have a daughter and call your name
[1:45:38] patience
[1:45:41] and i wrote it down
[1:45:45] somebody also because he wasn't a
[1:45:47] christian somebody now prophesies
[1:45:50] falsely to her and say wow you have a
[1:45:52] son first i said honey
[1:45:54] we'll see
[1:45:56] who god was speaking to if it's a son
[1:45:58] then i was wrong
[1:46:00] if it's a it's a daughter who comes
[1:46:02] first well then of course you see soft
[1:46:05] your daughter came
[1:46:10] so it's normal i'm not saying this to
[1:46:13] make myself anything but i believe in a
[1:46:16] present tense god
[1:46:20] god is working even here when you look
[1:46:23] at it in the bigger picture a place
[1:46:26] where people are just loving each other
[1:46:30] you know brother barnum let me put it
[1:46:31] this way but the bottom part is i'll
[1:46:33] rather have a church that's united in
[1:46:35] love than a gifted church
[1:46:38] so i'm not glorifying gifts as a matter
[1:46:40] of fact to show you that's not what i'm
[1:46:42] glorifying one time i was now walking
[1:46:46] towards church
[1:46:48] anybody was familiar
[1:46:49] with with the toronto area i was walking
[1:46:51] from scarborough town center because the
[1:46:53] church our church is not too far from
[1:46:55] that and as i was walking there i wasn't
[1:46:58] driving at the time so i would use the
[1:46:59] bus so it stopped this scab return
[1:47:01] center i decided to walk it was a sunday
[1:47:04] i believe and i'm walking towards church
[1:47:07] and there's this footbridge that is
[1:47:09] glass around
[1:47:11] and man i feel the hallelujahs inside of
[1:47:13] them and and i'm walking and i'm walking
[1:47:15] as i'm walking a little bird the flu bam
[1:47:19] in front of me and hit itself and drop
[1:47:22] down
[1:47:23] and died in front of me i'm like okay
[1:47:26] so you know you're feeling that you feel
[1:47:27] like okay i want to exercise my faith
[1:47:31] so so i stopped there because god had
[1:47:33] been dealing with me with something
[1:47:35] about saul
[1:47:36] and i and and and i stopped there
[1:47:39] and as i stopped there i'm thinking
[1:47:41] what's the point of this it just
[1:47:43] happened right in front of me
[1:47:45] i picked up the bird
[1:47:46] i held it in my hand
[1:47:49] i started walking i walked maybe towed
[1:47:52] just
[1:47:52] as long as maybe towards the the front
[1:47:54] door there
[1:47:56] and i came to a bin that was right there
[1:48:00] and i i stopped there i said lord
[1:48:03] this bird
[1:48:05] just flew
[1:48:06] and he died in front of me
[1:48:09] if you want to raise it it's fine
[1:48:11] if you don't want to raise it i feel
[1:48:13] compelled to pick it but if you don't
[1:48:15] want to raise it i'm throwing it now in
[1:48:16] the bin
[1:48:18] that's what i say to god
[1:48:21] and as soon as i say that i feel the
[1:48:24] power arise out of me
[1:48:26] and i say little bird i give you your
[1:48:27] life
[1:48:28] then it went away
[1:48:30] i'm like whoa what's happening here
[1:48:32] so
[1:48:35] i wasn't overly excited it's almost like
[1:48:38] okay what happened
[1:48:40] then i walked
[1:48:42] another distance almost maybe the same
[1:48:44] thing
[1:48:45] and i feel the spirit of god and says
[1:48:46] stop
[1:48:48] i'm walking i stop
[1:48:50] now this wasn't no audible voice
[1:48:52] i stopped as soon as i stopped
[1:48:56] i hear now what
[1:49:00] now you're gonna have a testimony that
[1:49:02] you prayed for a bird and i raised it up
[1:49:05] then what
[1:49:08] was the rebuke
[1:49:11] i stopped
[1:49:12] i'm like yeah
[1:49:15] this little bird
[1:49:17] shall die one day
[1:49:19] again
[1:49:21] so what
[1:49:24] he said from now onwards let your
[1:49:25] passion be solved
[1:49:30] this is before the salvation
[1:49:34] so i come for souls friends
[1:49:36] that's what i come for i don't come to
[1:49:38] make myself anything you know we have
[1:49:40] read so much of that in the message
[1:49:43] you know big means and small small use
[1:49:46] you know that's the quotation that we're
[1:49:47] just reading there there but they'll
[1:49:48] head on to this there's no big me and
[1:49:50] small use
[1:49:52] there's no top ten in the message
[1:49:59] when it's the top ten everybody's
[1:50:01] excited
[1:50:02] and they erect themselves in atmosphere
[1:50:05] and it's a big
[1:50:11] and meanwhile maybe no one ever gets
[1:50:14] saved no one ever get delivered people
[1:50:16] go back and go into fornication people
[1:50:18] go back and go into adultery people go
[1:50:21] back and go into life people go back and
[1:50:23] go into pornography
[1:50:27] because that's the spirit tormenting a
[1:50:28] lot of the young people that i met
[1:50:30] pornography
[1:50:32] friends
[1:50:34] that's weak if you die in that state
[1:50:37] pretty much without deliverance you go
[1:50:39] to hell
[1:50:42] you better be delivered from that you
[1:50:44] better go to your past and say i got a
[1:50:46] problem because the bible say confess
[1:50:47] your fourth one to another i need to be
[1:50:49] delivered
[1:50:50] i come to understand that even mary
[1:50:53] don't help people from stopping
[1:50:54] pornography
[1:50:57] when i was a sinner i was caught up in
[1:50:59] that spirit so i ain't talking down to
[1:51:01] anybody
[1:51:02] but you need deliverance
[1:51:06] hallelujah you need the deliverance you
[1:51:08] need to die out to those things
[1:51:11] hallelujah you are not supposed to be in
[1:51:14] the maritime and watch pornography
[1:51:16] and try to find a
[1:51:19] in relations with your wife that's of
[1:51:21] the devil
[1:51:23] you've got to come clean the holy spirit
[1:51:26] is a clean spirit
[1:51:30] pornography is like a national
[1:51:32] international epidemic in messages
[1:51:36] i have testimonies of people with
[1:51:38] demonic manifesting come to think about
[1:51:40] it it's caught up in a pornographic
[1:51:42] spirit
[1:51:45] you've got to be delivered i believe in
[1:51:48] the old
[1:51:49] sanctification gospel
[1:51:51] where you are cleansed from these things
[1:51:54] because they that do these things
[1:51:58] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:52:05] there's no use and
[1:52:08] you can argue about
[1:52:10] traditions
[1:52:12] you can argue about message doctrine
[1:52:14] this is not messy doctrine this is clean
[1:52:17] living
[1:52:20] you find people in message pulpit
[1:52:23] calling themselves
[1:52:25] filled and committing adultery
[1:52:29] you're not even sanctified must alone
[1:52:31] filled with the holy ghost
[1:52:34] you find ministers caught up in
[1:52:35] pornography oh man they can preach like
[1:52:38] lightning hallelujah they can take you
[1:52:40] to the heavens but when it comes to
[1:52:44] simple clean living when it comes to bed
[1:52:46] biting other ministers
[1:52:48] apparently i won't go into certain
[1:52:50] things when it comes to the i've
[1:52:51] experienced that
[1:52:53] with ministers some of the biggest
[1:52:55] gospels is ministers
[1:53:07] i don't need no minister's permission to
[1:53:09] breathe for brother dale
[1:53:11] i need to hear the voice of god
[1:53:14] well he tried doesn't mean that with
[1:53:15] disrespect
[1:53:16] ministries no you don't do that
[1:53:19] because the man is in charge
[1:53:22] you don't go to a man's home and just
[1:53:23] start talking to his wife can you cook
[1:53:24] food for me well
[1:53:26] it's the husband
[1:53:28] so so i'm not saying that the pastor is
[1:53:30] the husband now i'm just using an
[1:53:32] illustration here
[1:53:33] you know
[1:53:36] but people need to be set free it's
[1:53:40] simple friends
[1:53:42] if you got hatred in your heart you
[1:53:44] don't have love
[1:53:46] if you got hatred in your heart
[1:53:49] you have things to deal with
[1:53:51] if you got wrath in your heart you got
[1:53:53] the spirit of canaan
[1:53:56] if you got strife strife people strive
[1:54:00] marriage over anything over where to put
[1:54:03] a chair way to do that
[1:54:06] my goodness
[1:54:08] over what pots and pans husband what are
[1:54:10] you doing asking about puts and pants
[1:54:21] heresies i like to put that because
[1:54:25] in denominations harris is in the
[1:54:27] message
[1:54:29] some of them brother branham will come
[1:54:30] and preach again
[1:54:34] friends better just leave it or not
[1:54:42] some of them there's no blood
[1:54:45] so are you preaching divine salvation
[1:54:47] then
[1:54:48] if there is no more blood there is not
[1:54:50] even divine healing
[1:54:53] because his blood was shed for healing
[1:54:57] what kind of funny stuff is that
[1:55:00] and then cry that your children be saved
[1:55:03] if there's no blood that they can't be
[1:55:04] saved then
[1:55:06] what kind of understanding is that
[1:55:08] heresies
[1:55:12] got to be said friends
[1:55:19] hallelujah
[1:55:28] wow
[1:55:33] the bible says this
[1:55:38] we must make our calling
[1:55:40] and the election show
[1:55:45] the bible also talk about strive to
[1:55:47] enter into the straight gate
[1:55:50] for many i say unto you
[1:55:53] will seek to enter indians shall not be
[1:55:54] able
[1:55:57] people like to put this in the
[1:55:58] denomination i don't
[1:56:01] oh of course that's part of that
[1:56:04] you see why don't you put in the
[1:56:05] denomination by the james
[1:56:08] well the sad thing if you look in multi
[1:56:10] 25 when brother branham is talking about
[1:56:12] the 10 virgins
[1:56:13] and five were wise and five were foolish
[1:56:17] they were all virgins
[1:56:20] so they were all living sanctified life
[1:56:24] they were actually above these things
[1:56:25] that we are looking at i don't idolatry
[1:56:27] witchcraft
[1:56:28] they were above those things
[1:56:32] if people who were above those things
[1:56:34] could become the foolish virgins how
[1:56:36] much more when they are caught in those
[1:56:37] things
[1:56:39] they were living holy christian
[1:56:42] sanctified
[1:56:44] you say why message because you go into
[1:56:46] the pentecostal denominations holy see
[1:56:51] maybe
[1:56:53] to them they don't penis they don't
[1:56:55] leave holiness in the methodist churches
[1:56:57] anymore and stuff like that they got
[1:56:58] their creeds and dogmas women with
[1:57:01] shorts and all kind of stuff you really
[1:57:03] think that's what the bible is saying
[1:57:04] but
[1:57:05] these virgins were good sanctified
[1:57:09] message people in my view i know brother
[1:57:12] means they talk of pentecostal those
[1:57:14] were the
[1:57:18] we are the people today closest to the
[1:57:21] truth
[1:57:22] so these were good message sanctified
[1:57:25] people they didn't make their calling
[1:57:27] and the election sure they assumed
[1:57:29] because we are in the message we got the
[1:57:31] holy ghost
[1:57:33] they assumed perhaps that because we are
[1:57:36] born in the message we got the holy
[1:57:37] ghost
[1:57:39] and when the showdown came they were
[1:57:41] left behind
[1:57:44] we were supposed to be in the rapture
[1:57:48] and say it's going on you don't even
[1:57:50] know
[1:57:51] you were not wise so they had now to die
[1:57:53] in the tribulation they were not lost
[1:57:54] now but they had to die in the
[1:57:56] tribulation that's how brother brother
[1:57:57] puts it
[1:57:59] because he says he said verily i say
[1:58:01] unto you i know you not
[1:58:04] in other words i never put my life
[1:58:06] inside of you i never had a relationship
[1:58:09] with you
[1:58:14] he said they shall be whipping and
[1:58:16] gnashing of teeth when you shall see
[1:58:17] abraham
[1:58:19] isaac
[1:58:21] and jacob and all the prophets in the
[1:58:23] kingdom of god and you yourself trust
[1:58:25] out
[1:58:27] let this not be us friends
[1:58:32] let that not be you
[1:58:37] the bible says study to show yourself
[1:58:39] approved before god
[1:58:43] is my life pleasing unto god
[1:58:47] am i meeting
[1:58:49] you know i'll wind down with the quotes
[1:58:52] that's all i'll close up with
[1:58:57] but the branham
[1:58:58] especially to those who think he never
[1:59:00] made mistakes this is brother branham
[1:59:04] before being baptized with the holy
[1:59:05] ghost
[1:59:07] remember he had already given his life
[1:59:08] to the lord now
[1:59:10] remember he already knew that he had a
[1:59:12] gift
[1:59:13] because ever since he was young he used
[1:59:15] to see visions
[1:59:16] remember all at this time when he's
[1:59:18] saying these things he has all those
[1:59:20] things in the background
[1:59:23] he started with this one in my life
[1:59:24] story in 1950 it says an old colored man
[1:59:27] a little bit of rim here around
[1:59:29] like that walking out like this you know
[1:59:31] and then this old man come out i thought
[1:59:32] look like they have some of the young
[1:59:34] men preaching instead of that old man
[1:59:36] about that he's being he's being nigh
[1:59:39] he's come where they bringing a dead
[1:59:40] person almost dying
[1:59:42] he said now the preacher has been
[1:59:44] preaching about the baptism of the holy
[1:59:45] spirit this is in mishawaka when he
[1:59:47] started his first interaction with the
[1:59:50] pentecostal denominational people
[1:59:52] he says about time he got preaching
[1:59:54] there about five minutes that all
[1:59:56] stopped of men let out the yelp and
[1:59:58] screamed and jumped up in the air and
[2:00:00] clicked these hills together throw these
[2:00:02] chests back and say well he ain't got
[2:00:03] enough room
[2:00:05] up here for me to preach i looked at
[2:00:07] that
[2:00:08] and i said ma
[2:00:11] that is what i want
[2:00:13] this is your prophet
[2:00:16] if it will make an old man act like that
[2:00:19] what would he do to me
[2:00:22] he was a young man at that time why i
[2:00:24] thought that's what i want and i said i
[2:00:26] ain't going home till i found more about
[2:00:28] this
[2:00:30] he was making his election and calling
[2:00:32] sure
[2:00:34] then he goes on to hear
[2:00:39] he gone to pray to god he says i knelt
[2:00:41] down and said oh god then people got
[2:00:43] something that i want
[2:00:46] i said let me hear some of that
[2:00:49] he goes on i jump i'm jumping parts of
[2:00:51] it now it goes into when hope is dying
[2:00:54] she said one thing promised me too
[2:00:57] that you never let loose
[2:00:59] but you preached the gospel that you had
[2:01:02] up there in mishiwaka i said i promise
[2:01:09] the message never took that away
[2:01:11] the message never took away
[2:01:15] the baptism of the holy ghost by an
[2:01:17] experience
[2:01:18] hallelujah and about that time or he
[2:01:21] goes into that he can check that in my
[2:01:23] life story i'm gonna jump them he says
[2:01:24] it because he spoke about my life story
[2:01:27] many different times you know that
[2:01:29] he said that
[2:01:32] but there's something that that i want
[2:01:34] to say wait wait wait wait wait he says
[2:01:38] let me jump some of all these quotes his
[2:01:39] quotes that i have
[2:01:44] then
[2:01:45] he went through a searching then he gave
[2:01:47] people speaking in tongues as you know
[2:01:49] and then he says see one was living in
[2:01:51] adultery he got confused he pulled back
[2:01:53] if you remember and then he listened to
[2:01:55] his mother-in-law he got into trouble
[2:01:58] but now when he's giving an account
[2:02:00] of his conversion
[2:02:02] this is not an account of giving his
[2:02:04] life to the lord because he did that in
[2:02:05] the shed he was already a person giving
[2:02:08] his life to the lord in the missionary
[2:02:10] baptist church living his christian life
[2:02:13] clean as he could be
[2:02:16] remember even when he was a sinner i
[2:02:18] live clean because the voice told him
[2:02:20] don't drink don't smoke don't do all
[2:02:21] these things
[2:02:25] and this is why i can call him my
[2:02:28] prophet
[2:02:29] i want you to hear this
[2:02:31] he says in a little old saloon
[2:02:34] from that time 1960 0302
[2:02:38] that had been used as a church
[2:02:41] where some colored people was preaching
[2:02:44] the gospel this is no more in mishawaka
[2:02:47] now this is a different old converted
[2:02:48] salon
[2:02:50] i was a southerner i want to hear it i
[2:02:53] know we are a mixed audience here a few
[2:02:55] mixed audiences i was a southerner and
[2:02:57] didn't like colored people this is your
[2:03:00] prophet saying this
[2:03:04] that man i can listen to
[2:03:08] that man who can say i used to hate
[2:03:10] colored people
[2:03:12] but can be converted to preach the
[2:03:14] gospel of god until i see the
[2:03:16] resurrected christ i can listen to that
[2:03:18] man that's an honest man
[2:03:22] hallelujah
[2:03:24] but god humbled him
[2:03:26] the prophet of the age to get the holy
[2:03:28] ghost he had to go to people he didn't
[2:03:31] like
[2:03:34] let me read that again
[2:03:36] i was a south and it looks like we got a
[2:03:38] lot of southerners sometimes and didn't
[2:03:41] like the colored people didn't like the
[2:03:43] colored people
[2:03:48] so he is a man who in his heart doesn't
[2:03:50] like colored people
[2:03:52] even while he's still not liking people
[2:03:54] colored people and their vision came
[2:03:59] and told me where to go find it
[2:04:04] he moved back by vision because by his
[2:04:06] own natural position he wouldn't have
[2:04:08] done that
[2:04:11] because he didn't like them
[2:04:16] and all the white girls and i'd went
[2:04:19] with not all of them four or five
[2:04:21] standing they said billy
[2:04:23] you are not going in there
[2:04:26] remember also this is way back in the
[2:04:29] in the 30s so things were really
[2:04:31] really hot
[2:04:34] so friends so don't think i'm throwing
[2:04:35] anything to any any one of you folks i
[2:04:38] hope that's not anybody thinks
[2:04:40] we're just saying something here i'm
[2:04:42] reading a court and then we'll wind down
[2:04:43] with that
[2:04:46] he said billy you're not going in there
[2:04:48] i said yes i've got to
[2:04:52] i guess this time he wasn't married or
[2:04:54] maybe his wife would hope or he died i
[2:04:56] don't know he said said don't never ask
[2:04:59] me for another date
[2:05:03] so they all didn't like other people
[2:05:07] so today in today's language they'll say
[2:05:09] you're the prejudice racist or whatever
[2:05:12] that's what they'll say
[2:05:14] he said it didn't make any difference
[2:05:17] i met
[2:05:18] god and from that time i've been changed
[2:05:22] can point back to that time i was
[2:05:24] changed
[2:05:27] then he puts these friends he said no
[2:05:29] man has a right in the pulpit until he's
[2:05:32] got an experience no matter what the
[2:05:34] intellectuals can say you know when you
[2:05:36] met god
[2:05:38] hallelujah
[2:05:42] he gives an account of the same thing
[2:05:46] without man without price in 1959 but
[2:05:49] from a different angle he said in a
[2:05:50] bunch of little so-called holy rollers
[2:05:53] one night i found what i wanted
[2:05:56] that money could not buy in a bunch of
[2:05:59] illiterate uneducated poorly dressed
[2:06:02] people negroes to begin with
[2:06:06] out yonder in an old converted salon on
[2:06:09] the floor i found a prize a jewel when
[2:06:14] that old ducky looked in my face and
[2:06:16] said have you received the holy ghost
[2:06:18] since you believe
[2:06:20] oh it was something that i wanted i
[2:06:23] didn't expect it to find it amongst
[2:06:25] those people but they had what i needed
[2:06:36] i ain't trying to put up the colored
[2:06:38] people
[2:06:40] some of them colored people in africa
[2:06:41] they sold their own bread to slavery
[2:06:45] so don't just say white white white this
[2:06:47] you think the white people had
[2:06:48] connections in africa to know where to
[2:06:50] go they did their own fellow villagers
[2:06:53] and sold them
[2:06:55] i ain't no politician i know he said i'm
[2:06:58] preaching the gospel
[2:07:02] way with that spirit
[2:07:05] every little problem the black guy has
[2:07:07] it's the white man's fault even if he
[2:07:09] opens the school and you don't want to
[2:07:11] go it's the white person's fault even if
[2:07:14] he worked hard to get his money ah it's
[2:07:16] his fault well work don't sit down do
[2:07:20] something
[2:07:22] we want to balance things
[2:07:31] i love brother bonham
[2:07:35] so
[2:07:36] he would rely
[2:07:38] on his church
[2:07:41] he wouldn't rely on his pastor at that
[2:07:43] time i think maybe roy davis whoever he
[2:07:45] was
[2:07:46] he says i got to
[2:07:49] learn god for myself
[2:07:51] i got to get an experience for myself i
[2:07:54] got to make my calling
[2:07:56] in the election show
[2:07:59] i said be your holy name
[2:08:03] for the god
[2:08:06] i didn't know how things would go
[2:08:10] lord forgive me lord we have mumbled and
[2:08:13] stumbled on my words
[2:08:15] what has been said in error or in
[2:08:17] mistake
[2:08:19] that's not my objective law
[2:08:22] my objective is
[2:08:24] to catch somebody so
[2:08:27] that someone falls in love with you
[2:08:31] that somebody
[2:08:36] get delivered
[2:08:38] oh god
[2:08:40] sister leon if you want to play
[2:08:42] something softly
[2:08:44] you just feel like winding down this way
[2:08:48] oh i surrender all or something like
[2:08:50] that
[2:08:53] god is present
[2:08:58] god is
[2:08:59] he uses each one of us according to all
[2:09:02] makeup
[2:09:03] according to on temperance
[2:09:07] but i don't believe that god brings
[2:09:08] forth a message for the sake of doing it
[2:09:13] don't be satisfied
[2:09:17] just because you've been a message
[2:09:19] member
[2:09:21] you've been born in the message
[2:09:23] or even just because you've been living
[2:09:26] a clean sanctified life
[2:09:29] that's all good but you must have a
[2:09:32] direct personal experience with your god
[2:09:36] i don't know how he don't do it
[2:09:38] he might not do it like brother brahm
[2:09:40] where you found it in the floor
[2:09:42] you could be on the road
[2:09:44] you could be on the phone talking to
[2:09:46] somebody maybe a pastor
[2:09:51] sometimes it's
[2:09:52] you have to recognize that god sends a
[2:09:54] pastor as a gift to help you
[2:09:57] but a gift is not going to help you
[2:09:59] until you receive it
[2:10:01] it's not a gift until you receive it
[2:10:04] completely it's not a gift
[2:10:07] hallelujah
[2:10:09] thank you jesus
[2:10:11] oh father i pray for this church
[2:10:17] church
[2:10:20] your god is shaking coming speak in the
[2:10:22] name of the lord
[2:10:24] your god is shaking coming
[2:10:28] don't entertain that spirit of gossip
[2:10:31] but the banham in the christ the mystery
[2:10:33] of god revealed thy soul
[2:10:36] that put
[2:10:37] on a picture for him in the pastor's
[2:10:39] office there
[2:10:41] see the devil will use somebody he won't
[2:10:44] let you
[2:10:45] continue as one big bunch
[2:10:48] to try
[2:10:49] any spirit that tried to undercut the
[2:10:51] influence of your pastor to you that's
[2:10:53] not of
[2:10:54] god even if
[2:10:57] bastard dale would make a mistake
[2:11:00] if you allow that spirit that's not of
[2:11:01] god
[2:11:04] you got to realize that god sent him as
[2:11:06] a gift to you to help
[2:11:08] you you pray for him you pray for his
[2:11:12] family
[2:11:13] you pray for his labor he's just a man
[2:11:15] like you but god put him in charge
[2:11:18] that's what that quotation say
[2:11:22] if i'll read it it puts it this way says
[2:11:25] stay with your pastor he's your shepherd
[2:11:27] and you give him respect
[2:11:29] of course that doesn't mean
[2:11:31] you give him the respects due to god you
[2:11:33] respect him in the office that he holds
[2:11:37] in the message respect but
[2:11:39] brother balaam speak about that
[2:11:43] they have seen congregations ask their
[2:11:46] past and so on and whatnot this is how
[2:11:48] is he ever going to help you
[2:11:52] so when that shaking time that is soon
[2:11:54] come i don't know when
[2:11:57] when that happens friends remember
[2:12:01] remember
[2:12:03] so that you can stand with your pastor
[2:12:06] satan is an accused of the brethren
[2:12:11] you don't know about your pastor through
[2:12:13] gossip
[2:12:15] if you have a question go to god that's
[2:12:17] what i did when i wanted to know
[2:12:18] something about my pastor because they
[2:12:20] would think that i could look even
[2:12:21] myself as a man
[2:12:24] as a matter of fact before god ever
[2:12:26] filled me with the holy spirit because
[2:12:27] he filled me whilst i was on my knees in
[2:12:29] my own room praying with my hands
[2:12:32] the spirit of god says this one thing
[2:12:34] you must needs make right and say what
[2:12:36] is it lord say i want you to change your
[2:12:38] attitude about your pastor i gave him as
[2:12:41] a gift to you that you may receive the
[2:12:43] holy ghost
[2:12:45] it was what i wanted
[2:12:47] believing the message is all good but
[2:12:49] that's just a start
[2:12:51] you got to have your own personal
[2:12:53] connection
[2:12:54] and he led captivity coveted and he gave
[2:12:56] gifts unto men
[2:12:59] oh
[2:13:00] father thank you father for your people
[2:13:04] thank you father for your word having
[2:13:06] effect of somebody
[2:13:09] i want you to examine your heart
[2:13:10] whatsoever is upon your heart
[2:13:13] if it's a besetting sin
[2:13:16] if it's something you need to be
[2:13:17] delivered from
[2:13:19] if the spirit of pornography
[2:13:22] well your pastor will pray for you
[2:13:25] you need to speak to him
[2:13:29] hallelujah thank you jesus
[2:13:31] you need to speak to him
[2:13:33] then god will deliver you
[2:13:35] don't be ashamed the bible says if you
[2:13:38] are shamed
[2:13:39] hallelujah of him he will also be
[2:13:42] ashamed of you before the holy angels
[2:13:46] so you know i got to know that you're
[2:13:47] exposing the devil when you do that
[2:13:51] a spirit
[2:13:53] has been exposed you don't have to go
[2:13:54] bound
[2:13:57] if you've become a little cold
[2:13:59] with god you just need a renewal
[2:14:01] sometime
[2:14:02] sometimes it's just you to shout out
[2:14:05] sing out a little louder
[2:14:07] and that's all you need
[2:14:09] because human beings we get a little bit
[2:14:11] starchy when we get into routine
[2:14:15] sometimes you may find that you become
[2:14:17] irritable with your husband or with your
[2:14:20] wife it's just human
[2:14:22] being maybe you just need
[2:14:24] to go out for a day or two
[2:14:26] away from home
[2:14:29] you know away from the routine
[2:14:31] and you can renew
[2:14:33] your relationship
[2:14:35] not everything is spiritual
[2:14:40] whatsoever place you are
[2:14:44] let god speak to your heart
[2:14:48] i want you to hold that request
[2:14:50] in your heart
[2:14:52] i don't know what that request did
[2:14:54] you know it it could be
[2:14:56] your loved one it could be anything
[2:15:00] it could be that you need that holy
[2:15:01] spirit of promise a supernatural
[2:15:03] experience that only god can give you
[2:15:06] you don't have it because you've
[2:15:07] believed the message
[2:15:09] in the book of acts it says have you
[2:15:11] received the holy ghost since you
[2:15:13] believed not when you believed
[2:15:16] oh father
[2:15:19] i haven't come to be different
[2:15:21] i've come just to be a help
[2:15:23] to you
