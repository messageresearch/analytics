[28:56] think it's a bit of a miracle in itself
[29:00] that there's people that still love the
[29:02] Lord and they still put their trust in
[29:05] him amen
[29:06] praise be to God Amen I myself am not
[29:10] much of a Preacher I would say but I
[29:14] just yield myself to God and asked that
[29:17] you may use me to speak his word amen
[29:20] we're not here to try and show what we

[29:26] of God and I just pray that you keep

[29:33] with me just ask God to help me because
[29:36] I have plenty of faults praise the name
[29:39] of the Lord amen God richly bless you
[29:42] listen to our Bibles to the Book of
[29:44] Matthew chapter 24.
[29:47] amen Matthew 24
[29:49] amen this morning I just want to speak
[29:52] on a subject taking heed in perilous
[29:55] times
[29:57] amen taking heed in perilous times
[30:01] Matthew chapter 24
[30:05] and we'll read verse 4 and then we'll
[30:07] read verse 24 as well
[30:10] Matthew 24 4.
[30:14] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[30:17] take heed that no man deceive you praise
[30:22] the name of the Lord verse 24.
[30:24] for there shall rise there shall arise
[30:28] false christs and false prophets and
[30:31] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[30:34] much that if it were possible they shall
[30:37] deceive the very elect
[30:41] amen I'll read verse 25 as well behold I
[30:45] have told you before praise the name of
[30:47] the Lord you may have your seeds
[30:51] amen and amen
[30:53] amen the scripture we've just read is uh
[30:57] it's a familiar scripture
[30:59] to each one of us I believe and Christ
[31:02] was
[31:03] speaking after that they had told him
[31:06] the Bible says that the disciples were
[31:09] showing him the temple and how great the
[31:12] structure was and Jesus began by saying
[31:15] uh there'll come a time when there won't
[31:17] be one stone left upon another
[31:19] praise the name of the Lord
[31:21] and that part of his words that was
[31:24] already been fulfilled in Jerusalem the
[31:27] temple was destroyed by Titus I believe
[31:30] in 1870 according to prophecy that Jesus
[31:34] made amen and Jesus spoke about many
[31:36] many things throughout this chapter but
[31:39] we just want to take a few things
[31:41] because we can't talk about everything
[31:43] but I want to focus on taking heed amen
[31:46] Jesus said take heed that no man deceive
[31:50] you amen because the Bible also says
[31:53] that uh Satan presents himself like an
[31:56] angel of Light and he also has ministers
[32:01] praise the name of the Lord he has
[32:03] Ministers of his own false Apostles amen
[32:06] that also present themselves like they
[32:09] are the messengers of the truth of God
[32:11] praise the name of the Lord so God has
[32:14] been warning us telling us take heed
[32:17] that no man deceive you amen because we
[32:20] know that when the the serpent came in
[32:22] the Garden of Eden to deceive amen it
[32:25] wasn't Satan directly himself but he
[32:28] used a vessel called a serpent amen the
[32:31] Bible says that he was more subtle than
[32:33] all the the the beasts of the field amen
[32:36] he was an upright creature he could
[32:38] speak he could reason praise the name of
[32:40] the Lord amen and his seed is still
[32:43] among us today praise the name of the
[32:45] Lord you see not by uh not by physical
[32:49] traits you see but the spiritual traits
[32:53] is still in the Earth today present name
[32:56] of the Lord amen so every man and woman
[32:59] every child is is listening to something
[33:02] to someone praise the name of the Lord
[33:04] because there's something in you that
[33:07] yearns for something you see there's
[33:09] people who yearn for knowledge so they
[33:11] go after their quest in life is to gain
[33:13] more knowledge there's people who the
[33:16] thing in them is is is a quest after
[33:18] wealth you see some want fame praise the
[33:22] name of the Lord others want to be one
[33:24] thing or another amen it's all what's in
[33:27] your heart the Bible says that he says
[33:29] where your treasure is
[33:31] praise the name of the Lord you see or
[33:34] rather is it where your heart is there
[33:36] is your treasure amen I might not I may
[33:39] not have quoted that correctly but you
[33:40] understand what I'm trying to say
[33:41] whatever is inside of you amen is what
[33:45] will guide you it's what will pull you
[33:48] towards something praise the name of the
[33:50] Lord is a deep calling to the deep
[33:51] inside of you
[33:53] amen and the voice that resonates best
[33:56] with you has to do with the spiritual
[33:59] condition of your heart amen that's why
[34:01] Jesus said when they question him they
[34:03] say how come your disciples eat with
[34:05] unwashing hands you see and Jesus
[34:07] answered and he said that uh the things
[34:11] which defile a man is not what goes in
[34:13] you see it's not because your hands are
[34:16] soiled and you eat something without
[34:17] washing your hands that is going to
[34:19] defile you but Jesus says that the
[34:20] things which defile a man is what comes
[34:23] out of the heart praise the name of the
[34:25] Lord and he listed several things he
[34:27] says adultery is fornication murders
[34:29] envies all those things and Paul comes
[34:32] in the book of Galatians and he says the
[34:33] works of the flesh amen hatred
[34:36] witchcraft all those different things he
[34:39] listed them he says those are the works
[34:41] of the flesh praise the name of the Lord
[34:43] and the purpose of the Gospel was to
[34:46] come and cleanse us from all those
[34:48] things making us fit for the kingdom of
[34:51] God
[34:52] praise the name of the Lord may I stop
[34:54] here just a moment and say that in all
[34:57] that is written in the scriptures all
[34:59] that has been said and prophesied on the
[35:02] great miracles signs and wonders you see
[35:04] there's one thing that God is trying to
[35:06] achieve in man one thing
[35:09] the Bible says amen the spirits of just
[35:13] men made perfect
[35:15] praise the name of the Lord God is
[35:18] trying to perfect the human being back
[35:20] to what he was amen when they asked him
[35:23] about Elias he says the disciple says
[35:27] um isn't it written that Elias must
[35:29] first come and Jesus says yeah it is
[35:31] true he says Elias must first come but
[35:33] he's come already you see then he says
[35:36] and Elias truly shall come and restore
[35:39] all things praise the name of the Lord
[35:42] what was he speaking about you and I
[35:44] have to be restored to the perfect state
[35:47] of Adam and Eve stood in the Garden of
[35:49] Eden praise the name of the Lord and the
[35:52] purpose of the Gospel is to deal first
[35:55] and foremost with your soul
[35:57] you see we live in this world and your
[36:00] flesh is going to fall it's going to get
[36:01] sick it's weak it's affected by by
[36:04] weather and germs and all these things
[36:06] you see but the first thing that God
[36:09] wants to deal with is that Soul inside
[36:11] of you praise the name of the Lord
[36:13] that's the thing that was corrupted in
[36:15] the beginning when God told Adam and Eve
[36:18] he says that there you eat thereof that
[36:20] day you die he was speaking about the
[36:23] soul you see the soul of man died
[36:28] and what is what is that state of death
[36:31] you see he fell from his position of of
[36:34] fellowship with God you see man and God
[36:38] were on the same plane God could come
[36:40] and talk to man just any time he felt
[36:43] like it you see but man because of sin
[36:45] he fell from that position and Satan has
[36:48] been working to keep man from getting
[36:50] back to that position you see and the
[36:53] gospel came to restore us back to that
[36:55] place of Fellowship that is why we need
[36:58] a process of sanctification God wants to
[37:01] clean up that Soul he wants to take out
[37:03] the malice he wants to take out the
[37:05] bitterness he wants to take out the
[37:07] hatred all the things that Satan planted
[37:10] amen every every plant that my father
[37:14] has not planted will be what uprooted
[37:17] praise the name of the Lord because God
[37:19] planted a seed in the earth amen and he
[37:23] looked at or he looked at man after he
[37:25] had put all things together he said it
[37:26] was very good
[37:28] Hallelujah but then Satan came along and
[37:31] planted something
[37:33] like the parable Jesus spoke he said see
[37:36] Wild men slept an enemy came and planted
[37:38] different seed in that Parable Jesus
[37:40] says that the the good seed are the
[37:43] children of God
[37:44] Hallelujah and the bad seed are the
[37:47] children of the enemy amen and amen you
[37:50] see so God is walking is calling out to
[37:53] you he wants you to take heed
[37:55] recognize what God is trying to do in
[37:58] your life praise the name of the Lord
[38:00] God did not call us in this age just to
[38:02] be good church members to park message
[38:04] books under our armpits and say I
[38:06] believe the message I believe God sent a
[38:08] prophet see there is a greater purpose
[38:11] than that praise the name of the Lord he
[38:14] is working on the condition of your
[38:16] nature
[38:17] that's why the prophet said he said you
[38:20] are a Triune being your body spirit and
[38:23] soul amen he said then the the soul is
[38:27] the deepest part of you
[38:28] amen and he said that is the nature of
[38:32] your spirit
[38:34] see and the nature is what controls
[38:37] everything
[38:39] praise the name of the Lord if God can
[38:41] deal with your nature it will determine
[38:45] what your spirit is like
[38:47] and what your spirit is like determines
[38:49] what you do in this flesh praise the
[38:52] name of the Lord amen your desires have
[38:55] to do with the nature inside of you and
[38:57] that's why it is either the nature of
[38:59] God or the nature of Satan
[39:02] praise the name of the Lord excuse me
[39:06] That's what Satan planted in the Garden
[39:08] of Eden a seed of death his nature he
[39:12] put it in man as soon as he had planted
[39:14] it in man see by bringing unbelief to
[39:17] God's word that opened the door for that
[39:20] nature to come in and as soon as that
[39:22] was planted when God came on the scene
[39:24] and said Adam Adam where are you he says
[39:27] oh you know um
[39:29] I was hiding because I was afraid he
[39:31] says why
[39:32] oh because he says did you eat of the
[39:36] tree which I told you to not eat
[39:38] praise the name of the Lord
[39:40] Prophet come and told us he says it's
[39:42] not a fruit tree like many people think
[39:44] you see Satan said here listen to me
[39:48] this is what God meant but his goal was
[39:52] to get you to do something contrary to
[39:54] the word of God as soon as he got
[39:56] mankind to do that that evil nature
[39:59] entered
[40:00] because when God came and he said Adam
[40:03] what is this you have done first thing
[40:05] he says the woman you gave me
[40:07] his nature had already fallen right then
[40:10] and there praise the name of the Lord he
[40:13] said oh lord it's not my fault you see
[40:15] the woman you gave me she's the one who
[40:17] caused this see and the prophet like
[40:19] Prophet said he said the passing the
[40:21] buck already the nature of man which was
[40:24] perfect
[40:26] now was saying it's not my fault lord
[40:29] it's not actually the woman you you gave
[40:32] me her she's there's a problem there you
[40:34] actually you are the one who gave me
[40:36] that problem
[40:38] praise the name of the Lord you see the
[40:41] day you eat thereof that day you die man
[40:44] already fell right then and there see
[40:47] but God said you know what I will
[40:49] restore praise the name of the Lord
[40:51] hallelujah see so we're living in a time
[40:55] where the bride is is almost
[40:58] ready for that Perfection amen you'll
[41:01] notice in creation I'll just drop this
[41:04] in right now you notice in creation God
[41:06] created everything and he made even man
[41:08] see and male and female was in Adam
[41:12] and God looked and he said it's not good
[41:14] for man to dwell alone he says I'll make
[41:16] him and help meet and the last thing
[41:19] that was created was taken out of Adam
[41:23] was a bride for Adam
[41:26] praise be the name of the Lord the last
[41:28] thing is no wonder that in the Book of
[41:30] Revelations Hallelujah you see you read
[41:34] the book of Revelations yes he's talking
[41:36] about Christ but the focus is on two
[41:38] women
[41:39] mystery Babylon and the bride of Christ
[41:42] you see
[41:44] Christ has already done his work he's
[41:46] already perfect praise the name of the
[41:48] Lord but the work is on the bride she is
[41:51] the last thing that God is working on
[41:54] even up to the 19th Chapter it says his
[41:56] bride has made herself ready for it was
[42:00] granted unto her praise the name of the
[42:02] Lord that she should be arraigned in
[42:04] refining and clean and white praise the
[42:07] name of the Lord the focus on the end is
[42:09] on her
[42:11] Hallelujah so it behooves us to take
[42:14] heed my brother and my sister hallelujah
[42:16] amen
[42:18] praise be to God when the word of God
[42:21] was made flesh you see he came down in a
[42:25] form that he was a human being walking
[42:27] on this Earth amen and the prophet says
[42:30] that he was the type of Christ was in
[42:32] Adam God put him in a deep sleep then he
[42:34] took a bride out of him he says Christ
[42:36] fulfilled that Calvary you see and then
[42:38] from there he took out the bride of
[42:41] Christ was being formed through the
[42:42] seven Church ages and at the end she's
[42:44] coming to maturity amen until Christ
[42:48] himself will testify of his own bride
[42:50] and say now this is Flesh of My Flesh
[42:52] and bone on my bone praise be the name
[42:55] of the Lord you see the perfect one has
[42:57] to testify of you when he looks at you
[43:00] and he sees that you have re you you are
[43:02] a representation you are taken right
[43:05] from his side he is willing to identify
[43:08] himself with you he says this is Flesh
[43:10] of My Flesh born on my bone praise be
[43:13] the name of the Lord when Christ is
[43:15] satisfied with your nature
[43:18] the molding of your character that you
[43:21] have come to a place where like God said
[43:24] about Christ and mantrasfiguration this
[43:27] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[43:29] pleased
[43:30] listen to him praise be the name of the
[43:32] Lord you see and the bride is coming
[43:35] after the same form amen
[43:37] hallelujah amen the spirit the
[43:40] scriptures rather consistently say he
[43:42] that Hatha near let him hear what the
[43:44] spirit is saying to the churches see

[43:50] have an ear to hear amen listen what the
[43:53] holy spirit is saying you see the
[43:55] spirits in the world that people are
[43:57] listening to and I think for Generations
[43:59] people could have just said oh you you
[44:01] you know uh you just believe in a fable
[44:04] you believe this Christian thing is just
[44:06] a tale that's been passed through
[44:08] generations amen they could have said
[44:10] that up until now
[44:13] praise be the name of the Lord but
[44:15] what's happening now amen people who we
[44:19] thought were just maybe the regular
[44:21] unbelievers just a common person doesn't
[44:23] believe in God but he's living his life
[44:25] anyhow but now people are beginning to
[44:27] listen to a voice
[44:29] amen you see what's the voices telling
[44:32] them it's telling boys you know what
[44:34] maybe you're not a boy anymore
[44:37] you see there's a voice speaking
[44:41] what has happened that human beings
[44:44] cannot be what God made them to be they
[44:46] cannot be natural and continue through
[44:48] life there's another voice there's a
[44:51] power that is that is moving over people
[44:54] and it is causing them to go to a point
[44:56] where they're even willing to go for
[44:59] surgery and change themselves because a
[45:01] voice is speaking
[45:04] a power is anointing people
[45:07] you see go and change yourself
[45:10] praise the name of the Lord
[45:12] for Generations it might have been okay
[45:14] but now
[45:16] now you can stand and tell them okay you
[45:19] know what you thought I was crazy
[45:22] amen you thought I was crazy you see you
[45:26] thought I was crazy to live by the word
[45:28] of God to do the thing which is right to

[45:35] honorable citizen praise the name of the
[45:37] Lord and live true to the word of God
[45:40] you see
[45:42] but now
[45:44] The Voice which has been pushing man to
[45:46] the brink and pushing man to the brink
[45:48] now it is showing its real face
[45:51] praise the name of the Lord you see
[45:54] Hallelujah you see now you amen you can
[45:58] tell people you think I'm nuts amen you
[46:00] think I'm crazy

[46:15] their husbands husbands faithful to
[46:17] their wives when you want to live honest
[46:19] and True Praise the name of the Lord
[46:21] they say oh you're just religious amen
[46:24] but what about them now
[46:27] see the Bible says that because they did
[46:30] not want to retain the knowledge of God
[46:32] God gave them up
[46:34] and Satan gladly received them
[46:38] praise the name of the Lord
[46:40] Hallelujah now they get into a place of
[46:43] what now they don't know what to do
[46:46] a man was fellowshipping with brother
[46:48] Dale and sister one last night
[46:51] what the the school boards in different
[46:54] places across Canada United States
[46:56] they're having these meetings where
[46:57] parents are coming the parents are they
[47:00] don't know what to do why because of the
[47:03] content of the books which they are
[47:05] publishing for kids and all the garbage
[47:08] in it
[47:09] and they cannot believe
[47:12] that this is what a teacher will stand
[47:16] in front of the class and read to the
[47:18] students
[47:19] kids
[47:21] see
[47:22] longer than 10 years old
[47:24] praise be the name of the Lord and
[47:26] they're reading all this garbage to them
[47:28] and even in those meetings amen they
[47:33] recorded the videos they posted them
[47:34] online and when they posted them online
[47:37] they had to blank out the words that the
[47:40] the parent was reading from the book so
[47:43] that we can hear it in the video
[47:45] but in the classroom they'll read it to
[47:48] the kids
[47:49] praise be the name of the Lord
[47:51] what happens
[47:54] amen

[48:06] praise be in the name of the Lord we
[48:08] have got to come to the place where our
[48:10] eyes are lifted up he says when these
[48:13] things come to pass lift up your heads
[48:15] for your Redemption draws nigh we only
[48:18] have one place to look but I'm I'm
[48:20] grateful for that place to look at
[48:22] because those who don't have the hope of
[48:24] Christ where they're looking to
[48:26] politicians
[48:28] where they look into a different plan a
[48:31] different place move from one country to
[48:33] another all this place is liberal I need
[48:36] to go to a more conservative Place amen
[48:39] the whole world is taken by that spirit
[48:43] praise be the name of the Lord as it was
[48:45] in the days of Lord so shall it be in
[48:48] the day when the son of man is revealed

[48:56] pastor preach on the different preachers
[48:58] what do you hear amen what are you

[49:06] faith that just once delivered to the
[49:08] Saints why are we still why do you still
[49:11] come to church why are we still uh
[49:13] constraining you amen praise be the name
[49:16] alone there is something that is drawing
[49:19] you
[49:19] you see and there's coming a point in
[49:22] time where there's going to be a
[49:24] separation
[49:25] amen you see light and darkness cannot
[49:29] coexist
[49:30] there has to be a separation amen we're
[49:34] living in a time where Darkness the
[49:36] Bible says that gross darkness is upon
[49:39] the people
[49:40] Darkness covers the earth and grows
[49:43] Darkness the people
[49:45] praise be the name of the Lord you see
[49:48] the darkness on the people is worse than
[49:50] the darkness on the Earth
[49:52] Hallelujah
[49:54] see but the same scripture says arise
[49:57] and shine for your light has come you
[50:00] see and the glory of God is risen upon
[50:03] thee Hallelujah you see so the light of
[50:07] God has been given to us what did Jesus
[50:09] say when he in in Matthew sorry when
[50:12] you're speaking to um
[50:14] Nicodemus
[50:16] he said this is the condemnation that
[50:19] light is coming to the world but men
[50:21] love Darkness
[50:24] they loved it so they stuck with it but
[50:27] light has come amen and we're required
[50:30] to take heed and do something about it
[50:32] praise the name of the Lord amen we must
[50:35] come to a place where our faith is so
[50:38] lifted up that we are expecting at any
[50:40] moment that the spirit of God is going
[50:44] to change us out of this world the Bible
[50:47] says we shall be caught up amen will be
[50:50] changed in the twinkling of an eye taken
[50:52] from this Corruption of this world
[50:54] praise be the name of the Lord you see
[50:57] when we are taken up amen that these
[51:00] vile bodies are chains and quickened and
[51:03] taken to the dimension of God
[51:05] praise me in the name of the Lord
[51:07] because God has to pour His wrath upon
[51:10] this world I'm telling you my brother
[51:12] and sister this world is fit for the
[51:14] fire
[51:15] it is absolutely fit for the fire amen
[51:18] I'm not looking for a new politician to
[51:20] make a better economic plan I'm not
[51:23] looking for anybody to come and improve
[51:25] something you see down in the United
[51:27] States people are placing their hopes on
[51:29] uh Mr Trump
[51:31] see when when President Obama was
[51:34] elected it's like oh a savior has come
[51:37] yes we can and it's like a new thing
[51:39] outcome
[51:40] praise be the name of the Lord to those
[51:42] who believe in his policies they thought
[51:45] oh finally we have somebody and what did
[51:47] he do he came and he did his lot
[51:50] when he was finished
[51:52] somebody else came and did their lots
[51:54] and people are placing their hopes that
[51:57] there is a messiah who is going to come
[51:58] and take us back make America great
[52:01] again
[52:03] see make it great again they are hoping
[52:06] that they'll return to some form of
[52:07] Glory which they had in the past but
[52:10] they failed to see they did not take
[52:12] heed When sin was conquering every
[52:15] corner of the nation every facet of Life
[52:18] Of The Nation they did not take heed
[52:20] praise the name of the Lord you see and
[52:22] where they ended up now they are just
[52:24] ready the country is ready to implode
[52:27] praise the name of the Lord there's not
[52:29] a hope left in this world
[52:31] Hallelujah
[52:33] it took only about 2 000 years from the
[52:35] time man was made to the time man was
[52:37] utterly corrupted the days of Noah only
[52:40] two thousand years and God said I'm
[52:42] finished he says my spirit will not
[52:45] always strive with man amen he says I'm
[52:48] done the end of All Flesh has come up
[52:50] before me the Bible says but Noah found
[52:53] Grace in the sight of God
[52:55] why he lived faithful and true he took
[52:59] heed
[53:00] and he applied God's word in his life
[53:02] the Bible says he found Grace in the
[53:04] sight of God in his time praise the name
[53:07] of the Lord you see and even at that
[53:10] time the Bible says that man began to
[53:12] multiply it was a population boom and
[53:14] only eight Souls were saved only eight
[53:17] and Jesus says As it was
[53:20] in the days of Noah so shall it be
[53:26] that should make us release sober down
[53:30] and ask yourself Lord
[53:32] am I ready to live in that Kingdom
[53:36] see the question is it's not about do do
[53:39] you believe the message or are you a
[53:40] Christian this or not are you ready to
[53:43] live in a kingdom
[53:45] turn with me a moment to Revelations
[53:46] chapter
[53:49] I believe the last
[53:51] the last chapter of Revelation
[53:54] amen
[53:58] praise me the name of the Lord
[54:02] amen
[54:07] amen
[54:10] Hallelujah
[54:13] amen I'm just looking for a scripture
[54:15] maybe I can't find it but it says this
[54:17] he says nothing which defiles will enter
[54:20] that place
[54:22] amen nothing which defiles
[54:26] Jesus says the things which defile a man
[54:28] come from his heart that's why Jesus
[54:31] says You must be born again
[54:34] my brother and sister listened to me
[54:36] today
[54:39] you cannot justify Yourself by quotes
[54:43] don't try and prove that you have the
[54:45] Holy Ghost by finding quotes which the
[54:48] prophet said such and such and such and
[54:50] such the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[54:52] believing the word for your day that is
[54:54] true
[54:56] but what is believing
[54:58] he preached a message hearing
[55:01] recognizing acting on the word of God
[55:05] when the Holy Spirit has actually done
[55:08] the work in you then you can say I have
[55:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I have the
[55:13] new birth
[55:14] when the spirit has done the work
[55:19] brother
[55:20] he dramatized another way he said
[55:25] um when a baby is born into the world
[55:27] you say they come from the mother's womb
[55:30] out into this world
[55:33] he said if Little Johnny was not born
[55:36] into the world Little Johnny does not
[55:39] exist
[55:40] you see it's a birth
[55:43] Hallelujah he put it rather plain if
[55:46] Little Johnny was not born into the
[55:49] world Little Johnny does not exist and
[55:52] if you haven't been birthed by the
[55:54] spirit of God from the old man made into
[55:57] a new creature in Christ spiritually
[56:01] you are not there
[56:04] praise be the name of the Lord if you
[56:07] have never come to the place and say
[56:09] Lord
[56:10] my my parents from from uh from the
[56:13] Garden of Eden Adam and Eve the Bible
[56:15] says in Adam all die because of Adam we
[56:19] all became sinners
[56:22] if you've never come to a place to
[56:24] recognize that that's where you come
[56:26] from
[56:27] and all that come from Adam are born
[56:31] into this world spiritually dead
[56:34] you see but the spirit of God came to
[56:38] Quicken you to life that's why Paul says
[56:41] see you who are dead in sin and
[56:43] trespasses has he now what quickened
[56:48] the Holy Spirit has to come in you and
[56:51] bring you to life and the prophet says
[56:53] when you come to life then you feed on
[56:55] the word of God you feed on the things
[56:57] of God your nature is changed from the
[57:00] love of the things of the world to the
[57:02] love of the things of God
[57:04] praise be the name of the Lord you see
[57:06] and there's so much argument in the
[57:08] message of oh is it with Sensations or
[57:11] without Sensations those things have no
[57:13] place
[57:14] you see
[57:15] praise be the name of the Lord amen
[57:17] there's women giving birth every other
[57:19] day every day
[57:22] amen every woman's experience is
[57:25] different
[57:27] I'll tell you a story one time I believe
[57:29] God just gave me the opportunity to be
[57:31] there at the time I was in Africa
[57:34] my dad had fallen sick it was uh rather
[57:37] late in the evening maybe around 10 pm
[57:39] so we drove him to a nearby Clinic to
[57:43] you know get checked out by the doctor
[57:46] so we're sitting there in the waiting
[57:48] room and this young lady came in and um
[57:52] she she
[57:54] um
[57:55] she was actually uh I believe like a
[57:57] cleaning maid in somebody's house and
[58:01] while she was there she began to
[58:03] complain of
[58:05] his stomach aches right he says oh you
[58:08] know my tummy is really hurting me
[58:10] blasto and so forth now she was pregnant
[58:15] and the agreement was like when she
[58:17] reaches eight months she says okay just
[58:19] when you reach eight months you can stop
[58:21] working go take care of yourself until
[58:22] you deliver and so on and so forth right
[58:25] so here she comes in it's around 10 P.M
[58:30] she walks into the clinic oh yeah my
[58:32] stomach's really hurting me and so forth
[58:34] and
[58:36] the doctor said okay so he put everybody
[58:38] he was dealing with he just said okay
[58:40] you wait we have a kind of an emergency
[58:41] I want to check out see what's going on
[58:45] so I was sitting there with my dad were
[58:46] waiting
[58:48] um and then
[58:50] because it was a small Clinic it wasn't
[58:52] like a big hospital just a small Clinic
[58:54] and we were sitting there and okay
[58:59] 30 minutes
[59:01] the doctor walks out and at the time
[59:03] they called her I believe her sister
[59:06] said please come you know come to the
[59:08] clinic your sister is here and so she
[59:11] came and she brought no
[59:14] just a minute before they called the
[59:15] sister the lady went in young lady
[59:18] and then 30 minutes later
[59:21] the doctor said okay we got to call your
[59:23] family and
[59:25] and they said oh yeah we have a healthy
[59:27] baby boy just like that
[59:29] right
[59:30] come in 30 minutes I didn't hear no
[59:33] crying I didn't hear no screaming I
[59:35] didn't hear no wailing no fight nothing
[59:38] because this Clinic was small we would
[59:40] have heard something we heard nothing
[59:43] next thing we see our sisters walking in
[59:45] the door with bags and you know baby
[59:48] stuff and all this stuff in 30 minutes
[59:52] now that was the experience of that
[59:54] woman she had a baby she had those her
[59:56] birth took place
[59:58] and she had the life to prove it that it
[1:00:00] was there
[1:00:01] but another woman's experience may have
[1:00:04] been three days long
[1:00:06] struggling on suffering and not a
[1:00:07] hospital until and then a baby comes
[1:00:09] full but they would both have babies
[1:00:12] you see what's my point
[1:00:15] the life that you carry is the proof
[1:00:19] that you had a birth
[1:00:21] president name of the Lord the Bible
[1:00:23] says that if any man be in Christ he is
[1:00:26] a new creation
[1:00:29] praise the name of the Lord all things
[1:00:31] are passed away behold All Things become
[1:00:33] new
[1:00:34] amen and amen
[1:00:36] hallelujah praise be the name of the
[1:00:38] Lord amen
[1:00:40] amen the voice of God called Abraham you
[1:00:43] see Abraham two kid when God spoke he
[1:00:46] listened oh God bless you brother thank
[1:00:48] you amen
[1:00:51] you see Abraham listened because God
[1:00:54] spoke now men have not always listened
[1:00:56] but Abraham listened amen
[1:00:59] now here's a problem with many of us
[1:01:01] when Abraham was told Abraham leave your
[1:01:04] Kindred leave your father's house and go
[1:01:07] to a place I will show you the call was
[1:01:09] for Abraham
[1:01:11] the Bible says Abraham packed his daddy
[1:01:13] along with him and he packed his nephew
[1:01:16] lot
[1:01:17] praise be in the name of the Lord he
[1:01:18] took him along but the call was for
[1:01:20] Abraham
[1:01:22] amen
[1:01:24] Lord did not have that call but Lord
[1:01:26] decided okay I'll go along that's like
[1:01:29] many
[1:01:30] church members today
[1:01:32] oh well I'm a Christian called my
[1:01:34] parents I was raised in a Christian home
[1:01:36] and you know praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:38] oh you know I I just it's just something
[1:01:41] I've been doing for years praise the
[1:01:43] name of the Lord but did God ever speak
[1:01:45] to your heart and tell you
[1:01:47] see
[1:01:48] this world is perishing you're a sinner
[1:01:52] you need salvation
[1:01:53] you see and I gave my son for the
[1:01:56] purpose that you might be saved from
[1:01:58] this Dying World you see did God call
[1:02:01] you or are you just following the crowd
[1:02:03] remember you will enter Heaven as an
[1:02:06] individual
[1:02:07] see mommy may go and daddy may go and
[1:02:10] that doesn't does not guarantee that
[1:02:12] you're going to go in praise be the name
[1:02:14] of the Lord you see even even being a
[1:02:17] church member here you see don't depend
[1:02:21] on your church membership
[1:02:23] find out for yourself
[1:02:25] Hallelujah you see oh I was born in the
[1:02:28] message this is all I've ever known
[1:02:30] Satan will get you somewhere and I've
[1:02:32] seen it over the years people grow up in
[1:02:35] the message they they come to church
[1:02:37] they they follow the dues on the doors
[1:02:39] they live a very legalistic life they
[1:02:41] just know do this don't do that stay
[1:02:43] away from this stay away from that but
[1:02:45] there comes a place where Satan begins
[1:02:47] to work on that mind
[1:02:49] amen he begins to work on that mind
[1:02:51] Hallelujah you see praise be the name of
[1:02:54] the Lord by the grace of God I can say
[1:02:56] by the grace of God I was born in the
[1:02:58] message too my parents over but when I
[1:03:01] was born my parents were already
[1:03:02] believers
[1:03:03] you see but I went through school I went
[1:03:06] through the pressures the peer pressure
[1:03:08] all you are trying to fit in the crowd
[1:03:10] you're trying to do this you see and the
[1:03:13] nature in you was drawing you to those
[1:03:16] things but you knew because Mommy and
[1:03:18] Daddy have taught me I shouldn't do this
[1:03:19] so you see but the desire is in you
[1:03:24] you see you're still a sinner
[1:03:26] oh yeah I've been through it praise the
[1:03:28] name of the Lord but by the grace of God
[1:03:31] God brought me to a place where I began
[1:03:33] to ask myself and I pray to God I said
[1:03:35] Lord what is this message all about
[1:03:38] what is the gospel all about what is
[1:03:40] this what's it all about
[1:03:43] oh I've heard it all my life things I've
[1:03:45] heard this I heard the prophet's
[1:03:47] messages but I had to come to a place
[1:03:49] where I had to ask the question myself
[1:03:51] you see it's the same thing a lot should
[1:03:54] have done where am I going
[1:03:57] why am I picking up my family and my
[1:04:00] goods and and I'm following Abraham you
[1:04:02] see he should have asked himself that
[1:04:04] question but he did not have the call
[1:04:07] praise the name of the Lord that's why
[1:04:09] the prophet said you must come to a
[1:04:10] personal experience with God for
[1:04:13] yourself
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] praise be to God if you've just been
[1:04:18] following somebody maybe you're
[1:04:20] following a brother sister mommy daddy
[1:04:22] you need to come to a place where you go
[1:04:24] to God and ask God for yourself Lord
[1:04:27] what about me
[1:04:30] see what do you have for me what's
[1:04:34] what's this all about praise the name of
[1:04:36] the Lord you see he he he just followed
[1:04:39] Abraham lot did and there came a time
[1:04:42] where the rubber began to meet the road
[1:04:46] Strife came between the two of them and
[1:04:49] Abraham he just said he said Lord you
[1:04:51] pick if you go this way I'll go the
[1:04:54] other way praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:56] you see now what was in his heart began
[1:04:59] to show
[1:05:00] the Bible says he picks the more
[1:05:03] well how did he put it
[1:05:05] see the well-watered plains praise the
[1:05:08] name of the Lord and he pitched his tent
[1:05:11] toward Sodom
[1:05:13] where was his heart that way Sodom
[1:05:17] and the Bible says Abraham remains
[1:05:19] whatever law didn't pick he chose and he
[1:05:22] stayed there but he had the call of God
[1:05:24] so he knew what he was doing
[1:05:26] but what was in in Lord's heart Drew him
[1:05:30] to the place where he went praise the
[1:05:32] name of the Lord
[1:05:33] you've got to hear the voice of God for
[1:05:35] yourself or you'll end up like lot and
[1:05:38] his wife
[1:05:39] even in the hour of judgment when the
[1:05:42] angels of God said Lots
[1:05:44] he says take your family get out of this
[1:05:47] place because it's going to be burned
[1:05:50] and don't look back but because of what
[1:05:53] was in our hearts even when the Angels
[1:05:55] were grabbing them and pulling them out
[1:05:57] of the city you see because her heart
[1:06:00] was still there she turned around and
[1:06:02] she looked and she turned to a pill of
[1:06:04] salt what did Jesus say remember Lord's
[1:06:08] wife
[1:06:09] you see if the wrong thing is in your
[1:06:12] heart even God himself can come and grab
[1:06:16] you but because your heart is still
[1:06:17] there you perish
[1:06:19] God himself came to Cain he says Cain he
[1:06:22] says if you'll do like your brother
[1:06:23] you'll be accepted not a prophet it
[1:06:26] wasn't Moses or Elijah standing there
[1:06:29] before Cain it was God himself lip to
[1:06:32] ear
[1:06:34] it still couldn't change Cain
[1:06:37] praise be the name of the Lord you see
[1:06:39] may God help us
[1:06:41] Hallelujah the Bible says watch your
[1:06:44] heart because out of it are the issues
[1:06:46] of life

[1:07:07] such a people why would Lots be drawn to
[1:07:11] the sodomites
[1:07:12] you see why was his heart drawn towards
[1:07:16] them you see the world was in his heart
[1:07:19] what was in Sodom was in his heart oh he
[1:07:22] may not have been uh uh lived there kind
[1:07:25] of Lifestyle but he had to be in that
[1:07:27] environment you see oh you know I like I
[1:07:30] like the the popular way of the day you
[1:07:34] see I like to be where the action is
[1:07:36] praise the name of the Lord amen where
[1:07:39] the popular thing is going on praise the
[1:07:42] name of the Lord hallelujah but Abraham
[1:07:45] he chose to walk with God

[1:08:08] what God Said go he started going

[1:09:04] or if the Lord should call you say your
[1:09:06] time is up the prophet said death
[1:09:08] doesn't change you one bit it changes

[1:09:14] condition not your nature nothing
[1:09:17] if you're hateful now you will go
[1:09:20] hateful if you're bitter now you'll go
[1:09:22] bitter if you are full of malice and all
[1:09:26] kinds of evil things the state in which
[1:09:28] you die is the state in which you go
[1:09:31] that's the state in which you stand
[1:09:32] before God
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:35] remember I said that's why salvation has
[1:09:38] to do with the nature of man
[1:09:41] amen even may I say this the Rapture
[1:09:44] will not change you
[1:09:46] praise be the name of the Lord the
[1:09:48] Rapture will change this body

[1:09:54] be changed
[1:09:57] Hallelujah by the nature of your soul
[1:10:00] God is working on that right now this is
[1:10:04] the time for the change of the Soul
[1:10:07] that is why you should be on your knees
[1:10:09] crying before God and say Lord transform
[1:10:12] me you see the Bible says in first John
[1:10:15] summer it says everyone who has this
[1:10:18] hope purifies himself even as Christ is
[1:10:21] pure
[1:10:22] everyone who has that hope of a body
[1:10:26] change purifies himself what did Jesus
[1:10:29] say If any man will come after me let
[1:10:32] him deny himself
[1:10:34] take up his cross and follow me what
[1:10:36] does that mean die to stop every day go
[1:10:40] on you and you say Lord I had a temper
[1:10:43] tantrum the other day I need that gone

[1:10:48] until you see that thing dry up
[1:10:50] oh Lord I lost it after this man a
[1:10:53] laughter Allah said after that woman
[1:10:54] when I uh Lord I I failed you that's
[1:10:57] where God wants you to be see your
[1:11:00] thoughts and confess it praise the name
[1:11:02] of the Lord when he came to Jacob and he
[1:11:04] was wrestling with God that day what was
[1:11:07] the question God asked Jacob
[1:11:08] what's your name
[1:11:10] what was he asking for Jacob I need you
[1:11:14] to confess what you are what does Jacob
[1:11:16] mean sir planter cheat
[1:11:19] that's what God was looking for Jacob
[1:11:21] was busy doing this and doing that
[1:11:23] scheme but when he met God God said
[1:11:25] what's your name
[1:11:27] what was he asking for confession
[1:11:30] when the Bible says repent and be
[1:11:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:34] it's not just saying all repent God is
[1:11:36] saying look at yourself and recognize
[1:11:39] that you're a sinner and you need
[1:11:40] Deliverance
[1:11:42] that's what repent means you cannot
[1:11:45] properly repent until you recognize you
[1:11:48] cannot apologize to somebody and truly
[1:11:51] mean that you're sorry until you see
[1:11:54] what your fault is
[1:11:56] then you come to somebody say you know

[1:12:07] come to God and say Lord I ain't no good
[1:12:11] please help me
[1:12:14] then God says
[1:12:16] voila praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:12:20] hallelujah amen I'll give you another
[1:12:23] example Isaiah chapter 6 The Bible says
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:29] he says um
[1:12:30] I saw the Lord high and lifted and his
[1:12:33] train filled the Temple and so forth you
[1:12:35] see you know the vision that he saw he
[1:12:37] says the the cherubim says with two
[1:12:39] Wings they they they they with two Wings
[1:12:41] they flew with two they covered their
[1:12:43] feet and so on and so forth see and they
[1:12:45] were crying holy holy day and night
[1:12:49] and Isaiah said when he saw that he said
[1:12:52] woe is me for I am an unclean man and I
[1:12:57] have unclean lips and I dwell among
[1:12:59] people also who are unclean
[1:13:02] in the presence of God
[1:13:05] he saw his his his filth
[1:13:10] he said woe is me and he began to
[1:13:12] confess he says Lord I'm a man of
[1:13:14] unclean lips when he made that
[1:13:17] confession the Bible says what one of
[1:13:20] the Angels
[1:13:22] he says he took the tongues took a call
[1:13:25] from the fire of the of the Altar and he
[1:13:27] came and he touched his lips
[1:13:30] then
[1:13:31] he said now who shall I send now Isaiah
[1:13:36] was willing to say Lord here I am send
[1:13:38] me
[1:13:39] he says your lips are now cleansed your
[1:13:41] iniquity is taken away only after
[1:13:44] confession
[1:13:46] praise the name of the Lord he heard you
[1:13:49] see he heard the voice of God and he
[1:13:52] knew what he had to do my brother my
[1:13:54] sister what Peter spoke in Acts 2 38
[1:13:57] was what the same principle
[1:14:00] confession to God based on seeing your
[1:14:05] weakness how weak how terrible how
[1:14:09] download you are when you come to that
[1:14:11] place you say Lord kill this one off
[1:14:13] give me the new one
[1:14:16] that's when God will begin working
[1:14:17] praise the name of the Lord that is the
[1:14:20] bride that's going in the Rapture amen
[1:14:22] you know what the difference between a
[1:14:24] foolish virgin and the wise virgin that
[1:14:26] very thing death to self recognizing
[1:14:29] that you're a sinner
[1:14:31] and dying to that thing the prophet
[1:14:34] preached the message you must be born
[1:14:35] again he said you must die until there's
[1:14:38] only just an empty shell left go listen
[1:14:41] to it when you get a chance he says you
[1:14:43] die to suffer until there's nothing but
[1:14:45] an empty shell
[1:14:47] praise the name of the Lord the fire of
[1:14:49] God so consumes everything that you are
[1:14:52] then now God comes and puts his Spirit
[1:14:55] In You
[1:14:57] you see what did Jesus say what did
[1:14:59] Paul's a rather John say Christ will
[1:15:02] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:15:04] he must destroy that old nature
[1:15:07] completely
[1:15:08] Hallelujah when Jesus was about to be
[1:15:12] crucified he said the prince of this

[1:25:09] four he says I cannot do what I want to
[1:25:12] do until you come hither
[1:25:15] I can't do what I want to do until you
[1:25:18] get out
[1:25:19] you see and God is now the judgments are
[1:25:23] ready
[1:25:24] they're talking nuclear war already
[1:25:27] you see we'll just take a crazy month
[1:25:29] one time to say you know what
[1:25:31] let the whole thing go
[1:25:33] just one crazy man
[1:25:35] amen you know what the prophet has said
[1:25:37] he says it will take somebody a little
[1:25:38] bit too much vodka
[1:25:40] and he'll say you know what what
[1:25:41] difference does it make now
[1:25:43] and the whole thing will go up and smoke
[1:25:45] now we know that there's a tribulation
[1:25:46] and all that stuff to go
[1:25:48] then they'll bomb themselves after
[1:25:50] praise the name of the Lord but we want
[1:25:53] to be hidden in Christ the prophet
[1:25:55] preached the message the rapture
[1:25:58] he read it the scripture from Psalms
[1:26:00] where he says amen he that dwelleth in
[1:26:02] the secret place of the most high
[1:26:05] shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:26:07] Almighty
[1:26:08] we need to get in that secret place of
[1:26:10] Christ
[1:26:11] that is the faith of the believer in
[1:26:14] this hour
[1:26:15] hidden away in Christ
[1:26:18] he was faithful
[1:26:19] to Abraham he was faithful to Israel he
[1:26:23] says I'll deliver you with a mighty hand
[1:26:24] he was faithful
[1:26:27] he was faithful to to Elijah he was
[1:26:30] faithful to every single one of them
[1:26:33] God never left his own David says I was
[1:26:37] young now I'm all he says I've never
[1:26:38] seen the righteous forsaken
[1:26:42] praise the name of the Lord God has been
[1:26:44] faithful in every generation today he
[1:26:47] has been faithful to give us a way out
[1:26:49] when denominations are deceiving people
[1:26:52] you see all belong to us believe it this
[1:26:55] way a prophet comes and says none of
[1:26:57] them
[1:26:58] get back to the word of God Amen in the
[1:27:02] word of God is our safety that is our
[1:27:05] faith praise the name of the Lord
[1:27:07] get ready it's time to get out by the
[1:27:09] rupture anything left behind will not be
[1:27:13] spared amen
[1:27:15] the prophet said that you don't want to
[1:27:18] be here during tribulation time
[1:27:20] he says it were better they cut your
[1:27:22] stomach open and poured sulfuric acid go
[1:27:25] read it you'll find it
[1:27:27] better they cut your stomach open and
[1:27:30] pour something acid inside
[1:27:33] now I don't want to imagine I don't want
[1:27:35] to know what that feels like
[1:27:37] but he said you don't want to be here
[1:27:39] why why is a tribulation such a terrible
[1:27:43] time some people are Banking and say
[1:27:44] well if I don't make it uh you know I'll
[1:27:48] stand for Christ in the tribulation
[1:27:50] don't take that chance why
[1:27:54] Jesus Christ suffered
[1:27:57] he suffered so that you don't have to
[1:28:00] suffer remember sin has to be paid for
[1:28:04] even though God forgives sin has to be
[1:28:08] paid for somebody something somewhere
[1:28:11] has to pay for sin
[1:28:13] because he said the soul that sinneth it
[1:28:16] shall die
[1:28:17] the day you eat thereof that day you die
[1:28:21] so sin has the penalty has to be paid
[1:28:24] if Jesus had not paid it for us we would
[1:28:28] have to pay for it
[1:28:30] you see how important the sacrifice of
[1:28:32] Christ is
[1:28:34] now
[1:28:35] Jesus Paid for sin the Bible says the
[1:28:37] Lamb of God which takes away the sin of
[1:28:39] the world but then the same Bible also
[1:28:41] says that see he died for the sins of
[1:28:44] many because not all accept him
[1:28:48] so the ones that accept him the Bible
[1:28:51] says he gave them power to be called the
[1:28:53] sons of God
[1:28:55] because they received him they received
[1:28:58] the sacrifice and the sacrifice of
[1:29:00] Christ is not just saying Lord I believe
[1:29:01] I thank you for dying for my sins but it
[1:29:04] is going through
[1:29:06] and letting the Holy Spirit divorce Sin
[1:29:09] from you entirely
[1:29:11] amen because the Bible says that
[1:29:14] um the worshiper wants pursed has no
[1:29:18] more conscience of sin God is working on
[1:29:21] perfecting individuals I mean brother
[1:29:24] sister literally perfecting you and I
[1:29:27] that we can stand as perfect human
[1:29:29] beings the prophet preach the message
[1:29:31] the statue of a perfect man
[1:29:33] what was he preaching about the nature
[1:29:35] of man
[1:29:36] from Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:29:39] he says and when these things are in you
[1:29:42] you see what did they call that the
[1:29:44] Bible call it but take us of the divine
[1:29:47] nature
[1:29:49] sinless
[1:29:51] that's what this is all about
[1:29:54] to become sinless and spotless now we
[1:29:57] know justification is what God sees and
[1:30:00] does for us he says you know what you
[1:30:02] didn't you didn't choose to be a sinner
[1:30:03] your parents did it in the Garden of
[1:30:06] Eden they saw the whole human race so
[1:30:08] God Justified he says it wasn't your
[1:30:10] doing
[1:30:11] but still you come out of Sinner anyhow
[1:30:13] now God says now here's a way for you to
[1:30:16] get back but you have to take it
[1:30:19] praise the name of the Lord so you have
[1:30:20] to let the Holy Spirit the same way the
[1:30:23] the transgender and sodomites and
[1:30:25] whatever they are and letting a spirit
[1:30:27] get on them and then they become what
[1:30:29] that spirit says do
[1:30:31] so you must also let the Holy Spirit
[1:30:34] come upon you and make you what the holy
[1:30:36] spirit says do and that is only
[1:30:40] according to the word of God
[1:30:42] praise the name of the Lord it makes you
[1:30:45] live out the word it brings the life of
[1:30:47] God into human flesh again
[1:30:50] Hallelujah that's what the Bible says
[1:30:52] amen he says God has set in the church
[1:30:55] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:30:57] he says what for the edification
[1:31:00] for the perfecting of the Saints until
[1:31:03] we come
[1:31:05] pray the name of the Lord
[1:31:06] to the Statue to the measure of the
[1:31:10] Statue of Christ there's a measure God
[1:31:13] is looking for he'll look and say
[1:31:15] brother Mount I'm looking for a measure
[1:31:16] here's your portion brother man here
[1:31:19] when you reach this
[1:31:20] that's what I'm expecting of you
[1:31:23] praise the name of the Lord every
[1:31:25] brother every sister God has a measure
[1:31:27] that he's expecting of you so press like
[1:31:29] Paul says he says I don't claim to have
[1:31:32] reached but I press towards the mark of
[1:31:34] the the calling the High Calling which
[1:31:37] is in Christ I'm pressing towards it he
[1:31:39] says I'm not saying I'm there but I'm
[1:31:41] still pressing Lord help me let me press
[1:31:44] on press the name of the Lord
[1:31:46] Hallelujah I'm pressing on the upward
[1:31:49] way pressing day by day Satan would try
[1:31:53] and set trust before you discouragements
[1:31:55] but brother sister keep that goal in
[1:31:57] front of you that's the prize amen
[1:32:01] when people are running a race there's a
[1:32:03] prize they're looking for if there's
[1:32:05] eight of them they're all looking at the
[1:32:07] same price
[1:32:07] so Paul says run that you might obtain
[1:32:10] praise the name of the Lord
[1:32:12] Hallelujah so why tribulation is such a
[1:32:15] bad thing
[1:32:16] Christ suffered it
[1:32:19] amen let's read it in the Bible Isaiah
[1:32:21] 61 let me go quickly then I'll close
[1:32:23] here amen
[1:32:24] praise the name of the Lord
[1:32:26] Isaiah chapter 61.
[1:32:31] amen
[1:32:34] Bible says here when Jesus this is the
[1:32:37] scripture Jesus read when he picked up
[1:32:38] the Scrolls in the temple
[1:32:40] amen I just want to jump to I'll read
[1:32:43] verse one and two the spirit of the Lord
[1:32:45] is upon me because the Lord has anointed
[1:32:47] me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek
[1:32:49] that he or he has sent me to bind up the
[1:32:52] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:32:54] captives and the opening of the prison
[1:32:56] to them that are bound to proclaim the
[1:32:59] acceptable year of the Lord and the
[1:33:01] Bible says in the New Testament he
[1:33:03] closed the book after that middle
[1:33:04] section
[1:33:05] he didn't finish verse two he says to
[1:33:08] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:33:10] the prophet came and said that is the
[1:33:12] day of redemption
[1:33:14] you see buying the Brokenhearted set the
[1:33:16] captives free Proclaim Liberty to those
[1:33:18] who are captive are captives why Jesus
[1:33:21] came to set free
[1:33:23] see he took the price of sin upon
[1:33:25] himself Isaiah 53 he suffered for us and
[1:33:28] amen praise the name of the Lord and He
[1:33:31] took that upon himself so we don't have
[1:33:33] to so he paid the price the penalty so
[1:33:36] we can go free that is what the
[1:33:38] acceptable year of the Lord he closed
[1:33:40] the book set it down amen
[1:33:43] jump to chapter 63.
[1:33:47] verse 1 who is this that Cometh From
[1:33:49] Edom with died garments from bosra this
[1:33:53] that is glorious in his apparel
[1:33:56] traveling in the greatness of his
[1:33:58] strength I that speak in righteousness
[1:34:00] mighty to save
[1:34:02] wherefore are thou read in thine Apparel
[1:34:05] in other words why are you Red why are
[1:34:07] your garments red
[1:34:09] and your garments like him that shredeth
[1:34:11] in the wine fund then he answered I have
[1:34:14] trodden The Wine Press alone and of the
[1:34:17] people there was none with me for I will
[1:34:20] tread them in my anger and trample them
[1:34:22] in my Fury and their blood shall be
[1:34:25] sprinkled upon my garments and I will
[1:34:27] stain all my arraignment for the day of
[1:34:31] vengeance is in my heart and the year of
[1:34:34] my redeemed is come
[1:34:36] that's the other part
[1:34:39] of verse 2 of Isaiah 61. see if you
[1:34:43] continue verse 2 chapter 61 and the day
[1:34:46] of Vengeance of our God to comfort all
[1:34:49] that Moon just think of it
[1:34:52] from the beginning of verse 2
[1:34:55] to the middle
[1:34:57] is over 2000 years
[1:35:00] you see how God's word is written
[1:35:02] sometimes we just read through the whole
[1:35:03] thing and oh when will this happen see
[1:35:06] the first part to proclaim the
[1:35:08] acceptability of the Lord he did it
[1:35:09] seven churches go by praise the name of
[1:35:12] the Lord at the end of that the day of
[1:35:15] vengeance
[1:35:16] and now he comes to what to manifest the
[1:35:20] day of Vengeance he says why because I
[1:35:22] trod the winepress of the wrath of God
[1:35:25] Alone
[1:35:26] praise the name of the Lord so to reject
[1:35:28] that what he has done to reject it you
[1:35:32] pay for it in the tribulation
[1:35:34] that's what the prophet said he said the
[1:35:38] what the foolish Virgin Goes to the
[1:35:40] tribulation for what purification they
[1:35:43] pay for it themselves
[1:35:45] why because Christ has already done it
[1:35:48] and you reject it
[1:35:49] so what else is God going to do he says
[1:35:52] well I don't know what else to give you
[1:35:54] go pay for it yourself
[1:35:57] God help us
[1:35:58] take heed in perilous times my brother
[1:36:01] my sister
[1:36:02] Hallelujah
[1:36:04] see amen and amen
[1:36:06] only a new creation is what will go in
[1:36:09] that is the difference like I said
[1:36:12] between the wise and this foolish virgin
[1:36:14] amen you are wise because you took what
[1:36:19] Christ has done and you let God manifest
[1:36:22] apply it in your life you have to be
[1:36:24] changed my brother and sister you have
[1:36:27] to Die daily you have to the Bible says
[1:36:30] work out your own salvation don't say oh
[1:36:32] Lord I accept you as my savior and then
[1:36:34] I'll be going to church every Sunday and
[1:36:37] I'll be nice I'll be a good neighbor
[1:36:38] that's not how it works get on your
[1:36:41] knees and die
[1:36:43] say Lord like David says Lord search me
[1:36:46] o God and know my heart today see if
[1:36:48] there be any wicked way in me
[1:36:50] continually Lord is there anything that
[1:36:54] will defile because the Bible says
[1:36:56] nothing with the files will enter
[1:36:57] therein so you must be perfected here
[1:37:01] we must every one of us be perfected
[1:37:03] here and you can't do that in your own
[1:37:05] strength how can I perfect myself I have
[1:37:08] to cry out to God and say Lord I'm
[1:37:10] struggling with this thing Lord I'm
[1:37:11] struggling with that thing help me
[1:37:13] see I have a funny feeling towards this
[1:37:16] Brother people do things they rub you
[1:37:18] the wrong way oh yeah we're still here
[1:37:21] in this flesh We're Not Angels we're not
[1:37:24] above those things things rub us the
[1:37:26] wrong way you see and we must come to
[1:37:29] God and say Lord help me overcome
[1:37:32] help me overcome and what does the Bible
[1:37:34] say in your weakness
[1:37:36] the strength of God is made perfect
[1:37:40] that's why Paul says I will glory in my
[1:37:43] infirmities because I know when I am
[1:37:46] weak Hallelujah then I am strong
[1:37:49] Hallelujah we sang that song earlier
[1:37:51] today they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:37:53] renew their strength if you read that
[1:37:55] scripture it says even these young men
[1:37:57] shall fail
[1:37:59] amen those who depend on themselves on
[1:38:02] whatever they are you will fail my
[1:38:04] brother my sister but when you get weak
[1:38:07] before God then God renews your strength
[1:38:10] Hallelujah
[1:38:11] praise the name of the Lord amen how
[1:38:14] much time do we have brother I think
[1:38:16] I've exhausted my time here I've lost
[1:38:18] track of time amen just let me bring
[1:38:20] this to a close amen
[1:38:21] amen just a few minutes just bear with
[1:38:24] me
[1:38:25] Hallelujah amen now we're dealing with
[1:38:28] two spirits in the world
[1:38:30] you're influenced by one or the other
[1:38:33] you see every day that you live you're
[1:38:35] influenced by one or the other
[1:38:37] amen the Antichrist calls the fallen in
[1:38:40] the in the beginning but Christ has
[1:38:42] given you a way out by regenerating your
[1:38:44] soul you see amen the Bible says that
[1:38:48] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:38:50] that is in the world
[1:38:52] if you have received him in you
[1:38:55] I don't believe in standing on the
[1:38:57] puppet and saying oh you praise the Lord
[1:38:59] you have the Holy Ghost because you
[1:39:01] believe the message I don't believe in
[1:39:03] that stuff Paul even says he says
[1:39:07] if that same spirit that raised Christ
[1:39:10] from the dead dwells in you if
[1:39:12] Hallelujah if it does then you're okay
[1:39:15] but not for a preacher to say oh yeah
[1:39:17] you find this you're good no no no no
[1:39:18] find out for yourself
[1:39:21] sweat it out like Jacob did praise the
[1:39:24] name of the Lord wrestle with God
[1:39:27] amen
[1:39:28] Hallelujah only you that's between you
[1:39:30] and God
[1:39:31] amen
[1:39:33] Hallelujah two Spirits amen you cannot
[1:39:37] overcome Satan on your own strength
[1:39:40] that's why the world is going through
[1:39:41] what they're going through the Bible
[1:39:43] says the holy they cannot receive the
[1:39:45] Holy Spirit that's what Jesus said the
[1:39:46] spirit of God they can't receive it why
[1:39:49] because they are not of the seed of God
[1:39:51] they can't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:39:54] so what happens
[1:39:56] Satan just takes them and is playing
[1:39:58] with them
[1:39:59] Hallelujah like a cat playing over the
[1:40:02] mouse he's just tossing them any way he
[1:40:04] wants
[1:40:05] it's the grace of God
[1:40:07] that we can receive the word of God
[1:40:11] just think of it it's the grace of God
[1:40:13] that you can even still in this hour
[1:40:15] here
[1:40:17] come to hear God's word and listen and
[1:40:19] receive it and Obey it and believe it
[1:40:22] it's the grace of God the Bible says the
[1:40:24] goodness of God leads you to repentance
[1:40:27] the goodness
[1:40:28] is not he that Wills or he that runs but
[1:40:32] God who shows Mercy
[1:40:34] don't spurn your day of Mercy my brother
[1:40:37] and sister
[1:40:38] Hallelujah amen and amen let me just
[1:40:42] read the quote here amen
[1:40:45] this is what we are today this is what
[1:40:47] the prophet said
[1:40:50] amen
[1:40:54] he said
[1:40:56] now this is the hour in which we live
[1:40:58] notice God promised that he would bring
[1:41:01] his bride out what he would do there
[1:41:04] would be a seed there would be a light
[1:41:06] in the evening time how he would do
[1:41:09] these things just exactly by the way he
[1:41:11] originally planned it in the Old
[1:41:12] Testament and the New Testament
[1:41:15] it isn't through denomination and may I
[1:41:18] say this we have denomination in the
[1:41:20] message circles we certainly do
[1:41:23] just because you say message message
[1:41:25] this brother Brandon doesn't mean the
[1:41:26] denominational spirit is also working in
[1:41:29] a message people have set up clicks and
[1:41:32] Clans and you belong and that one is out
[1:41:34] and this one is in you see they are
[1:41:36] there denominational spirits
[1:41:39] praise the name of the Lord they know
[1:41:41] better than to set up a headquarters and
[1:41:42] Bishops and archbishops but they
[1:41:45] practice it
[1:41:46] or they surely do there's the big fish
[1:41:49] in the pond and he's over the rest of
[1:41:51] them and that all that kind of stuff
[1:41:53] exists praise the name of the Lord you
[1:41:56] see
[1:41:57] Hallelujah
[1:41:58] the way he would plan to do it and it
[1:42:00] isn't through denomination it isn't
[1:42:02] through our system we're using today
[1:42:03] we're just causing death that people put
[1:42:06] their hands on it and die from it this
[1:42:08] is from the message trying to do God a
[1:42:09] service
[1:42:10] without being his will
[1:42:13] see the word the evening message must
[1:42:16] carry evening results we have to be
[1:42:19] expecting something
[1:42:21] we go into something with expectation
[1:42:24] Amen brother Dale is a farmer he goes
[1:42:27] and he plants at a certain time of the
[1:42:29] year with expectation if he plans
[1:42:32] something and something else comes up in
[1:42:34] Harvest time something has gone wrong
[1:42:37] you see somebody deceived or an enemy
[1:42:40] has done this praise the name of the
[1:42:42] Lord so you saw with expectation the
[1:42:46] evening message must carry evening
[1:42:47] results the evening message must now
[1:42:49] must rather sow evening seed not morning
[1:42:52] seed
[1:42:53] evening seed is that right the midday
[1:42:57] scene
[1:42:58] it seeds back there was denomination it
[1:43:02] died it perished but evening time
[1:43:05] message will show evening time light
[1:43:07] will show evening time results the
[1:43:11] evening time message Jesus time midday
[1:43:15] message just listen carefully
[1:43:18] it showed midday results what was the
[1:43:21] what was the the midday message
[1:43:23] the Lamb of God which takes away the sin
[1:43:26] of the world
[1:43:27] that was the time for Christ to come and
[1:43:30] manifest that the word was made flesh
[1:43:33] the Messiah came in human flesh see the
[1:43:37] beginning message showed beginning
[1:43:39] results he made creation Genesis
[1:43:43] so Genesis
[1:43:45] time of Christ and then now evening
[1:43:47] results see
[1:43:50] then he says
[1:43:51] he made his son in his own image in the
[1:43:54] midday
[1:43:55] in the evening time he makes a bride for
[1:43:58] it
[1:43:59] remember what I said at the beginning
[1:44:01] in the Book of Revelation at the end
[1:44:03] what is it it's two women it's bright
[1:44:06] time it was Eve's time after Adam was
[1:44:09] made and created and formed and God said
[1:44:11] it's not good that man was alone the
[1:44:13] last thing he formed was what a bride
[1:44:15] for Adam
[1:44:16] so the last thing that God is working on
[1:44:19] also is a bride for Christ the evening
[1:44:22] message is the bride to be made manifest
[1:44:25] that's the results we're looking for
[1:44:28] see how did he how did he how did he
[1:44:32] form the Earth
[1:44:33] how did he speak into existence by his
[1:44:36] word who was his son the word in the
[1:44:39] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:44:41] with God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:44:43] dwelt Among Us
[1:44:44] how will he take his bride by the word
[1:44:50] not by a new card not by some
[1:44:52] theologians that they are but according
[1:44:54] to his word he'll identify or not though
[1:44:56] when you say the word that's a general
[1:44:58] statement but when you break it down see
[1:45:03] he'll identify her
[1:45:05] don't put one thing to it or take one
[1:45:07] thing from it now leave it the way it is
[1:45:09] see now what's he doing he's calling out
[1:45:13] a bride and when he calls the bride he
[1:45:16] himself has to come and identify her
[1:45:19] just like Adam when God brought the
[1:45:22] bride to Adam Adam looked and says now
[1:45:25] this is Flesh of My Flesh bone of my
[1:45:27] bone see and how will Christ identify
[1:45:30] the bride those that go in the rapture
[1:45:34] the chosen ones the faithful ones the
[1:45:38] undefiled the perfect ones the ones that
[1:45:42] have grown in the Statue of Christ
[1:45:45] what's the statue of Christ the divine
[1:45:47] nature and Christ comes to identify and
[1:45:50] says yeah
[1:45:52] that one is mine she's Spirit of my
[1:45:55] friend she's my spirit she's nature of
[1:45:57] my nature she's born on my bone fly
[1:45:59] everything that she is he identifies and
[1:46:01] he says that's the one and he takes her
[1:46:04] that's how the bride is identified
[1:46:06] and the prophet said she will be the
[1:46:09] word word upon word upon word line upon
[1:46:13] line here little there little
[1:46:15] so we must work out our own salvation
[1:46:17] with fear and trembling read the word
[1:46:20] listen to it what does it tell you to do
[1:46:22] he that has this hope this whole brother
[1:46:26] purifies himself even as he is pure
[1:46:29] so what is she doing she is only taking
[1:46:33] what he gives her
[1:46:36] Eve didn't say no you know what I'll be
[1:46:38] like this and I'll be like that and I'll
[1:46:40] form myself like no
[1:46:41] it's just what God made
[1:46:44] and he presented and he says this is
[1:46:46] bone of my bone flesh in my flesh
[1:46:48] another type Esther amen the Bible says
[1:46:52] she did not ask for anything but she
[1:46:55] took only what was given to her for
[1:46:57] purification
[1:46:59] praise the name of the Lord in
[1:47:01] Revelations 19 the brides the Bible says
[1:47:03] the bride has made herself ready and it
[1:47:05] was granted to her
[1:47:09] amen one last scripture oh just
[1:47:12] something coming to mind amen Isaiah
[1:47:14] chapter 4. Isaiah chapter 4.
[1:47:18] verse 1.
[1:47:21] he says this is the contrary and in that
[1:47:25] day seven women shall take a hold of one
[1:47:27] man saying we will eat our own bread and
[1:47:30] wear our own apparel only let us be
[1:47:34] called by thy name to take away our
[1:47:35] reproach
[1:47:37] in that day shall the branch of the Lord
[1:47:39] be beautiful and glorious and the fruit
[1:47:40] of the Earth shall be excellent and
[1:47:42] calmly for them that are escaped of
[1:47:44] Israel the branch of the Lord the bride
[1:47:48] will escape these things
[1:47:50] but the the ungodly women now here are
[1:47:54] saying women but that's a type of what
[1:47:56] churches
[1:47:57] they're ungodly they say you know what
[1:48:00] we provide our own things I dress the
[1:48:03] way I want to dress I eat my own bread I
[1:48:06] do my own thing I just want to be
[1:48:07] identified with you because my name is
[1:48:10] not so good my reputation is not so good
[1:48:12] you see
[1:48:14] but I just want to be identified with
[1:48:16] you so that my Approach is taken away
[1:48:18] because I'm identified with so and so
[1:48:21] you see the difference
[1:48:23] praise the name of the Lord but the
[1:48:25] bride only takes that which is granted
[1:48:28] to her given to her you see and the
[1:48:31] Bible says that Esther found favor
[1:48:33] above all
[1:48:36] the rest in the sight of the king
[1:48:37] president she was that Chosen One my
[1:48:40] brother and sister take heed in this
[1:48:42] hour
[1:48:44] because Satan is going deceiving people
[1:48:46] Jesus says let no man deceive you
[1:48:50] praise be the name of the Lord God help
[1:48:53] us amen
[1:48:54] glory be to God
[1:48:56] just like the word was made flesh in
[1:48:58] Genesis in John 1. the word also has to
[1:49:01] be made flesh in the bride
[1:49:03] Hallelujah he is the perfect one
[1:49:06] take heed be careful what you're
[1:49:08] listening to
[1:49:10] be careful what you're taking in
[1:49:13] it must be the word of God because it
[1:49:15] will build on that and that alone
[1:49:18] when God claims his own he'll be
[1:49:20] claiming that which came from the word
[1:49:23] that is it amen and amen
[1:49:26] oh God help us amen so we are expecting
[1:49:29] a rapture
[1:49:31] and that is what we're pressing for
[1:49:33] my brother sister
[1:49:35] press for that and that alone
[1:49:38] live your life do your responsibility is
[1:49:40] what you must do you know and by the
[1:49:42] grace of God you see God has taken care
[1:49:45] of every one of us he feeds us he
[1:49:47] clothes us he gives us shelter amen oh
[1:49:50] we may not have it in store for you know
[1:49:53] the Next Generation and build wealth and
[1:49:55] all those kind of things
[1:49:57] but that's not what we're looking for
[1:50:00] if God blesses you in this life praise
[1:50:02] God thank God for it but remember when
[1:50:05] you leave you're leaving every bit of it
[1:50:07] you're leaving every little bit of it
[1:50:09] behind amen but God says he says Don't
[1:50:14] Fear I will never leave you nor forsake
[1:50:16] you
[1:50:17] so we may say that God is our helper
[1:50:20] praise the name of the Lord you see so
[1:50:23] keep your eyes on the prize
[1:50:25] be careful what is going into your ear
[1:50:28] because Satan is going around seeking
[1:50:31] whom he made before like he's going like
[1:50:33] a lion
[1:50:33] he wants to shake you this way
[1:50:35] discourage you that way
[1:50:37] this is a new there's a lot of stuff
[1:50:39] going around people who claim to believe
[1:50:42] the message
[1:50:44] some of them overseas
[1:50:46] and then the enemy came and because they
[1:50:49] were not rooted and grounded
[1:50:53] now it is starting to twist the message
[1:50:54] teaching things which are
[1:50:57] they shouldn't be even saying why
[1:51:00] destroying the faith of many in this
[1:51:03] last day message the message is meant to
[1:51:05] prepare a bride by the word but what are
[1:51:08] they doing they're destroying confidence
[1:51:10] in the messenger of God they're
[1:51:12] destroying confidence in what he has
[1:51:14] taught us
[1:51:15] what are they doing he's Satan again
[1:51:18] it's like that Beetle that insect
[1:51:20] he just doesn't come in one big Fell
[1:51:22] Swoop but he starts a little bit sowing
[1:51:25] seeds of doubt
[1:51:26] but remember
[1:51:27] build your hopes on Christ
[1:51:30] and I'm telling you if you have come to
[1:51:33] contact with Christ
[1:51:36] if the Holy Spirit and you have met
[1:51:39] together and you deal with you deal with
[1:51:41] him he deals with you amen you will not
[1:51:44] fall
[1:51:45] he will keep you in the hour of
[1:51:47] Temptation
[1:51:48] when enemy comes in lights the Bible
[1:51:50] says the spirit of God will raise up a
[1:51:52] standard amen the prophet said things
[1:51:55] will be flying around isms years ago
[1:51:59] amen there's a group from western Canada
[1:52:02] I'm not going to mention names but they
[1:52:04] started something they shook the faith
[1:52:06] of many preachers fell
[1:52:08] pastors who have been pastors for 40
[1:52:10] years they gave up the message
[1:52:11] altogether they said you know what oh
[1:52:14] this that and the other
[1:52:15] see
[1:52:17] that was one round don't think the devil
[1:52:20] is done
[1:52:21] don't think he's finished he's coming
[1:52:23] for another round he is going to come
[1:52:25] again and again why he knows his time is
[1:52:28] short so he wants to shake the faith of
[1:52:30] many if you're not grounded like I said
[1:52:34] in the word
[1:52:35] don't follow Man follow Christ
[1:52:39] and Christ is the holy spirit now
[1:52:44] he's in the form of the Holy Ghost now
[1:52:46] that's how he deals with you and I you
[1:52:48] know many times that seems to be
[1:52:49] far-fetched to people
[1:52:51] I'm closing Five fish people say oh the
[1:52:54] Holy Spirit you know yeah we know that
[1:52:56] God dealt with brother Branham and God
[1:52:57] dealt with so and so but how about me oh
[1:53:01] me you know I
[1:53:03] no God wants to deal with you he has a
[1:53:06] measure for you
[1:53:08] praise the name of the Lord you may not
[1:53:10] be speaking squirrels into existence and
[1:53:12] stopping storms and all of that but
[1:53:15] brother Branham says that the same power
[1:53:18] is in you
[1:53:19] he says no he doesn't have to do it with
[1:53:22] everybody that's what he said
[1:53:24] see God Called Moses to call the Flies
[1:53:27] and all those things
[1:53:30] Same Spirit but he didn't have to get
[1:53:32] every single man to do it
[1:53:34] the rest of them had to believe when
[1:53:36] they asked Jesus they said what can we
[1:53:38] do that we work the works of God he said
[1:53:39] believe on he whom God has sent
[1:53:44] so where what are we believing for our
[1:53:46] souls
[1:53:47] but while we walk this walk we get sick
[1:53:51] we call on the Lord he is still the
[1:53:54] Healer of all our diseases the Bible
[1:53:57] says don't forget his benefits
[1:53:59] so let us not just become saying the
[1:54:02] soul the soul the soul the soul the soul
[1:54:04] and forget all the other benefits of God
[1:54:06] I am the Lord that heals all your
[1:54:08] diseases
[1:54:10] so don't let your faith waver don't say
[1:54:12] that God cannot do this today God cannot
[1:54:14] do that have faith in God
[1:54:16] how does God given you to act he says is
[1:54:19] any sick among you let him call the
[1:54:21] Elders of the church Anointed with oil
[1:54:23] see pray he says the prayer of faith
[1:54:26] shall save the sick and if he has
[1:54:28] committed any sins he'll be forgiven we
[1:54:30] have a course of action
[1:54:32] they that believe shall lay hands on the
[1:54:34] sick and they shall recover that is our
[1:54:36] part to do it's God's part to keep the
[1:54:39] other end of the bargain so do your part
[1:54:41] anyhow praise the name of the Lord have
[1:54:44] faith in God Amen and one of these days

[1:54:49] will take us out of this place

[1:55:18] of God
[1:55:19] you see and the prophet said that
[1:55:21] if the enemy are sent is using somebody
[1:55:25] to cause problems Division and so forth
[1:55:27] he says they will either line up
[1:55:30] see
[1:55:32] with their truth with the spirit of God
[1:55:33] or they will get out
[1:55:36] you see but let's fan the Flames of the
[1:55:39] Holy Spirit the love of God the truth

[1:55:44] Bible says hold fast that which is good
