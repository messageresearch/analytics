amazing to see you all here and we love you and just a few announcements before we start andre petit will be here july 29th 30th and 31st uh brother jose dedication is august 6th and 7th we'll just confirm that i i believe that's we're probably going to close that sunday to go there on the 7th just to show support for our sister church and then august 21st emmanuel tommy will be with us and then september 18th brother james from lewis nelson's church will be with us then also amen so we're just looking looking ahead for what god would do amen and brother henry here is on short notice he's just like uh instant in season and out of season he's our our backup force man amen man it's so good to have you this morning too brother jim and matt with us just god bless you and sister linda amen we love you amen it's just awesome amen let's turn to romans 14 13-23 amen i want to just when you're pulling this scripture up romans 14-23 you know i i you know satan was telling me when we were when i was studying i believe it was satan he said you know half the church is going to believe you're preaching raid at them the other half won't have a clue why i'm even preaching amen amen but we know that was god amen god you know our prophet taught us something that we don't think of very much you know people in our day are looking for miracles and signs and wonders and something to prove that god's got the same yesterday today and forever and right now today in this setting our prophet said is the greatest miracle that god ever did let me show you what the quote said he said the very hardest thing that god ever did was not saving your soul wasn't filling you with the holy ghost wasn't keeping you safe and it wasn't bringing you back to heaven it was getting one man to believe another man was use of god and speaking for god that was the very hardest thing the that hardest and i listened to a message yesterday back in april wow i'm not even the spare tire man when you listen to yourself preach it's like oh wow it's america anybody comes back the second time to hear me preach amen but god somehow and just a bunch of scattered men can bring glory man that's just what god the bible says through the foolishness of brother dale's preaching you'll come back next sunday and when i listened to myself i saw wow amen but that was god's plan amen what's god's plan man sure not man sure not man let's start at verse 13 amy now we're we're living in a unique age this layout of cnh and uh i'm not saying you know a prophet is a foreseer and he sees things that are to come and and i'm sure that god showed us our prophet where we were but we're living in a unique spot in history and it requires a unique message for this very time amen i i really believe that god believes this this is god this morning let us not therefore judge one another anymore that's pretty plain but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way now we're not we're not this is a real paradox what that scripture is saying is you may be doing something that you have peace with but your brother might not have peace with it and so when you're with that brother don't expose that brother to what you have peace with now here comes the atomic and that can be social media see you may be at perfect peace at what you're doing but your brother may stumble on through social media let's read on and i know that i am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean in itself that gives us a lot of freedom but to him that is esteem anything to be unclean to him it is unclean that see some people see things differently okay but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now i mean it's pretty obvious that brother dale likes steak now walk is thou not charitably destroy not thy brother with thy meat i don't fully understand this i'm preaching but i'm i'm fully for whom christ died now see christ died for your brother and you could be tripping him but christ paid the ultimate price for him you can say well bless god that's his problem god didn't feel that way when he died for him see social media learn not then your good be evil spoke enough for the kingdom of god is not meat nor drink no no this is you're not going to believe what your prophet said about this first but righteousness peace and joy and the holy ghost we are free in christ for he that is in these things service christ is acceptable to god and approved and approved of men let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and the things wherewith may one may edify the other hallelujah for meat destroyeth not the work of god and all things indeed are pure you getting this but not all is but it is evil for that man that eateth with the fence it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine neither anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or this or is offended or is made even weak has thou faith habit to thyself before god happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth for he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not by the faith see you're saved it's just one law faith god died for the world but they're not saved because they didn't have faith not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin lord we ask you to just bless us and unveil and show your word to us in a special way we pray your beautiful name amen you may have your seats this morning i'm just going to take the first verses i was going to go a different way this morning and i'm just gonna i'm just gonna sit that right over there for the time being amen just by god's grace amen you know i i tend to just have too much to bring many many times i want to read you something that a prophet said and a harvest but here's how elijah he said there was a lady who spoke to one of our associates here he names the person out in the camp and i been out there with her husband fishing and brother bosworth and had told me a little joke and i had repeated it to her husband and it was a simple little thing i i just a simple i said there was a little boy standing looking at a uh the crawl of his baby was there and it was born a couple days before and his feet were sticking up and his little germs were hanging there and he squirreled like it was a brawling like a storm and the little mother looked at the little feather standing and he said mom did you say this baby came from heaven the the the older kid was was watching his baby brother and he was trying to figure out the whole process of this baby came from habit and why it was ugly or not ugly amen and the mom said yes son for sure it came from heaven he said well no wonder they put them out amen is it no wonder they put them out well that to me was just a little joke now this is a prophet this is a 59. that was oh he said to me that was just a little joke sure and i was over and we were looking at something and paul said he doesn't mean be a stumbling block in my brother's way and i would and i would eat it no more the world's standards he said well the man was just uh he thought it was hilarious and he told it to his wife uh-oh and she said and the man was the wife was hugely offended and the man tried to justify he said but brother branham's in these meanings and he's all keyed up and he's under the anointing of god and he's seeing visions and things until he just has to go relax now i had brother let me throw this in here this is fresh he said you know some people think you're going to stay under the anointing of god nonstop and believe me it's good when you're under it really good but our prophet said that he would explode if he stayed under it all the time explode so yeah it's good and i want it every sunday i want it more than every sunday but you would explode you're under it all the time and this is how his wife came back to her same husband her husband she said but you're not brother branham so you're not in those kind of meanings and anointing in other words why are you telling this joe and this our prophet answered he said you see it put a stumbling block and we have to watch what we're doing uh-oh and god's going to judge us for the way we put on facebook and social media the things that we do i paraphrase those last six books the way that we act and show now you see the bible clearly told us that all things are pure for us right i mean you could pull that back to the first part of our scriptures maybe amy show us where it was pure all things are pure but let's actually maybe maybe before you do that amy let's go to uh first corinthians 10 23. and we'll we'll just lay a foundation of the word of god and then we'll look into the the message now now remember i'm gonna i'm gonna watch you you you your first result is it's not my problem but the bible said it is your problem god's making it your problem because christ died for thy brother period and the bible says he will doubly make it your problem because he's going to judge you because you didn't think twice oh but that don't make it wrong what you're doing all things are lawful for me but all not all things are expedient all things are lawful for me but not all things edify not let's go back to first corinthians 12. does everything be established by two or three witnesses this will be our third scripture we had romans corinthians this is all from paul and paul wrote grace and he's telling us you got grace but your other brother might have a different portion of grace a lot of times i understand first corinthians 6 12. a lot of times it's carryovers from our upbringings or whatever something you know there's different reasons we catch all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient now this is a different scripture we're almost the same all things are lawful unto me but i will not be brought under the power of facebook man i'll have a confession i used to sew sometimes pictures on facebook on my farm i quit doing that because i would've had to give them all away anybody seen your farm wanted it matt amen see we have to be careful on what we do now now it's very clear that what you're doing i want to show you give you peace it's not necessarily wrong i want to i want to read is it all right to read our prophet we can we're we're home crowding man and and i want you i want to just maybe it'll be different than it ever was but you know the prophet has a way of bringing something and it's a lot slower when i actually read the quotes but it gives a different thing and in time we're going to get it so we can share it up here and and for sure for sure if you have a question on the quote you say i just can't believe my prophet said that oh like don't run away from me just come back i'll show you the exact quote i have it right here if i don't have it normally i have a paper but today i have some on my ipad amen hallelujah and questions and answers 6408 23 in the evening somebody asked brother branham should a christian woman wear simple jewelry necklaces or pearls i want to jump in here and show you that we were raised i was raised not we i was raised wesleyan holiness and the prophet talks about that and he gives a scripture in the bible and he says the nazarene he said if you were a nazarene person and you were coming in the church to get baptized and you had a wedding bed they would deny you because you were of the devil you say well they're ridiculous well no they actually have a scripture for it amen now they've taken that scripture out of context but they still have a scripture for it and i my desire i hope you believe me if you come back my desire is never to take the prophet or the scripture out of context i do not have an agenda brotherhood amen it's never ever the case but i want to balance things sometimes you've never heard of balance and i'm going to show you some stuff our prophet said that i would guard to you you have never heard over the pulpit i would wait here to say that i say i sure never have because it's it's on the far side of the road but see you got to get this side of the road and this side of the road and bring them in the middle and we i don't want to be over here today and i don't want to be over here but i want to bring it right in the middle and so if you've only heard this side and you've never heard this side then we're actually over here but we want to be here and not over here or over there amen amen so and this is a unique time because never before has have we had a social media internet operation like now and it in itself is not evil amen i if i went off facebook there's brothers that i would never ministers that i would never see or talk to ever again on messenger on facebook because you would have no connection period amen uh you say because the you know it's just something that god is you can use but everything that's good can be evil because satan comes in and perverts it and he really perverts it our prophet said tv was met for good but hollywood turned uh-huh okay amen so here's the sister he said i'm just gonna paraphrase the first scripture and when we get to where you know he said there's uh he quotes the scripture he said now when you adorn he said do not adorn yourself with costly jewels or pearls or kind of wearing jewelry but let it be the adorning of peace and quiet and a meek spirit now that's the scripture that the nazarene and the holiness raise see it says don't wear gold or silver or boarded hair or that but let the holy spirit be your beauty on the inside that will shine to the outside which is in meekness and subduity and humble and don't be able to see that that's that's especially like see that's just disgusting you know especially in anybody it's disgusting but especially sister man so they grab on to that and and i have the perfect perf personal experience being my wife after we get married our preacher that we ask to marry us that's having his 94th birthday soon he's still alive 90th birthday refused to marry us when we told him we were gonna have wedding beds now he's still alive we still visit him he's one of my wife's best friends so so they feel strong about it see and he goes on and he says you know he talks about like if you he said it's natural to want to look beauty beautiful and and these different things say man and and uh so then a sister comes up and uh asked him now it was or he's telling about it you know he talks about the nazarene won't baptize and he says he says well here let me read it he said now i don't mean sister he said if you have a pen or to me he said now this is not the lord he said but if you had a pen that you wanted to wear or like a little necklace that your husband give you or maybe something like that that you wore now to me i don't think it's bad but he now watches but now he said now remember i make myself clear that's just my opinion amen see the bible actually says different but it's to say it says different is taking it out of context because ultimately the bible's saying is have the beauty of the lord inside and it will shine on the outside okay okay but so the prophet's laying this down and then he said he said if a woman he's talking about wedding bands and you know and all this and and he says but don't go in and you know go in a uh wear uh like a dime store and make it look like you had a magnet on everything stick to you and he said he said a woman if a woman wants to dress and make himself look decent and clean and ladylike why i think that's not the thing to that to me he said why get going and put on the thing that makes you uh making it a little pride then you're wrong if you know and he said he said watch this you know brother wade preached this this one message i totally said your motive and objective and the prophet said here he said what's your purpose your attitude everything's your motive see you know why are you showing this you know amen he said you know he said a woman that dressed indecent for her to go out he said she has a demon on her because she's revealing herself to the city man your motive an objective he said but he said there was a girl came to me which was a drunker girl and had just received the holy ghost and she belonged to the assemblies of god and was in fort wayne indiana where i got married at and she came to me a fine little lady and asked me brother branham he said i want to ask you a question now this is a quo you've probably heard part of this quote but you've never heard the middle and i said yes right sister what is it she said well do you think it would be wrong for a christian girl to wear a scandal skirt and i said sister now this one thing i can't understand he said what is even a scandal scared and she told me what a scandal skirt was and she said you know it shows you're underneath garments of a lady it was a little bit shorter skirt and they would have fancy frizzy underwear and the underwear was longer than the scarf and our private answer is he said see he said now what is a woman when a woman what isn't a woman to make her want to show her underneath close to some man he said what what what in what business has a christian girl doing this kind of thing like that could you imagine a christian doing that now that's all what you expected right but he went on i say continue now look at here now a man there's not much to him when it comes to his body now this is a direct word for word quote because you're not going to believe it okay but i'm still going to read it because it's balance it's balance it's not what i think it's balance and if he if he went half naked it wouldn't it wouldn't even be a scandal to it now that is word for word now has anybody heard that in a preacher before okay but but this is paragraph 71 questions and answers 64. oh wait uh if he went half naked it wouldn't it wouldn't be no scandal to it not holding for a man but they but you know that what kind of a woman would be tempted by a man with his shirt off oh now you know our prophet and i read him there was about 30 some quotes where he mowed the grass with the shirt off and that's when he hit the bees in the fence now remember i'll just picture this back to facebook but repeatedly people came to get prayed for and he put his shirt on to go pray for him and then he went back in the backyard took his shirt off and cut the grass now see he didn't put it on facebook what he did in the backyard now it wasn't wrong he took his shirt off but if he would have went uh pray for the people what's his shirt up okay so see how would a woman be tempted with his shirt off or shorts on or whatever he had question mark the baked old burly looking thing it looks stupid and silly and i'm horrible to see these men i'm horrid to see these men out there well i think he would make a woman vomit to look at such a thing okay if she had but now you take a woman and put her in like that situation different it's a different temple different temple body is a different temple you see you understand that's right but if you think and then he goes back into necklace he said now if you think you wear a necklace and all this and and he sucks about that and then he goes into he tells the story where he was in rome you know and you've heard this quote where outside of the vatican they had to put a a sign up just for americans said american women please put clothes on amen he said what a disgrace for america but i don't know if you've heard this story before that but he talks about they were in a drug store and they were eating he said american woman came in and she was dressed all you know like an american woman she had an old 28 model chevy and she had a poodle dog sitting on her lap and she come in the restaurant all dressed like an american going to the vatican and they'd have to tell her to put clothes on but she had this poodle dog for her child and she came in the restaurant and put the poodle dog on the table and he said she had the the the dime store had stuck to her and he said she was 50 years old past trying to look like she was 15 and she was driving life in a rearview mirror so it was really terrible and he said now christians don't do that a christian don't try to be something he's not if you're 50 you're probably old and ugly compared to a 15 year old i mean that's just reality don't try you'll look ridiculous you know if we try to act like somebody else we'll look like a clown that's what she was trying to do and he said any man that drives his life down looking down the road he's going to crash and the christians but i want to go to and he goes he says paul says forgetting the things that are behind me he's talking about old young age but he said now it made me a shame and they brought this little old stinky dog up in here and put it on the table and it would make anyone vomit now they're in a restaurant they put the dog on the table and fooling around with this dog you know and loving it all up and then eating with the same hands and he said they were going to eat with the same hands and the waiter came over and was bubbling off and was going to make them get rid of the dog out of the restaurant and they said waiter you gotta consider the source she's an american and she's retired but she just don't know better man he said she's an american and let her alone in other words she don't have a clue she don't even know better than to bring a dog and sit it on the table man you see now we have to be really careful you may do things in your family holiday you know the bible says we're a peculiar people and i i have those i'm going to read them after but because of who we are it's not just who we are but because of who we represent there we go the bible says about the seven or eight times that you're a peculiar person and you're peculiar because you represent jehovah and your atmosphere and your attitude and everything and just it you don't even you don't even mentally think of it that you're you could it can be as pure as lily but but somebody else will read that and it'll just be you know it it can be perfectly pure see you're peculiar and your testimony ain't what you say it's what you live and and and and this is this is geared to me as much as anybody but you know see remember now the prophet said it wouldn't matter if the guy was half naked but the woman is a different temple and so in if you're posting pictures just don't go there see it's not you know it's your family or your backyard the prophet said that the the brahms fought in the backyard but the front yard they fought with each other to defend off you see see a family will do things or your clothes your friends that you know that you know you you you've known for 30 or 40 years and you just know that you're you know like sister patty and louie i mean like i mean they're just they were just always together so i mean like how could they offend one another because they just you know but there's people like that but when you go outside your inner circle they're gonna look at everything that just you know what i mean you you can say the simplest things the simplest things but you always got to look at they're looking at to give god glory you might say you know like just i'm just i'm stuttering but it can be really simple you always want to say you know you're like you're you're you're you're like they're looking at the only bible they're going to read is you so you always want to have your light out there for you you know i mean it can be it can be swimming pool pictures it can be garden pictures it can be it can be my farm but you know you always want to have christ in the forefront hey we went to church today and afterwards we had family time show the picture of the church and don't show the family type you know what i mean okay now i want to read a couple quotes that are directly to let's go back to uh i'll tell you where to go to romans 14 17. and our prophet said two things about this scripture and and it it it oh i sent it to another minister friend because it just woo now this is scripture for the kingdom of god is not meat nor drink but righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost now our prophet said a comment to this scripture twice would you like to hear it now i went and it paraphrases the exact comment in a paragraph or two paragraphs brother henry but i went a paragraph above and a paragraph below because i'm not trying to pop it out of context and i want to take my time and i want you to understand because we're living in a a world where everybody sees my laundry and see watch this when when when the when the king tried to hire the prophet to curse the hindu part of israel god had no problem with the heiner part of israel you're saying oh bless god he's a holy god god blessed them when he's seen it thank you lord god god sing behind the part right along with the prophet and he and he turned his cursing into the blessing did god have a problem with hiring the parts nope but the hindu parts see now of course that king had an evil agenda and the prophet did too because the prophet wanted his money and the king wanted to destroy israel i wanted to show their hundred parts so you can always look at the motive and so you look at the motive i'm living my life but i'm not gonna post it for the world that's why i struggle so much with this service being online you know i'm not to say that when brother jim and sister linda comes back and sister kim's here i'm not so sure that god won't tell us this i'm not the pastor for the world and what i preached to you this morning could blow somebody matt you know go back to that same quote i said the greatest america god the pro that same prophet at the beginning of that quote he said god would never use mechanical devices to spread his word he would always choose men and that was the hardest thing so all the people that are not sitting here this morning because they say well bless god i want to see some miracles to vindicate the ministry you're seeing it but you're not even here to see it because you didn't come back because the hardest the very the hardest thing was that god healing your cancer he wasn't saving your kid he wasn't saving the uncle was it bringing you out of jail or paying your bills it was to get you to come and sit at me the second time i mean the first time you could say well they just didn't know how dumb dale was but the second and third time now that's a miracle if you don't think so just go back and listen to old services oh boy i'm serious my prophet said it he said it repeatedly he said about him being a spare tire he talked about dwight moody he spit and sputtered and spit all over the people sitting in the front row and all this and then the newspaper came to say oh my goodness like i can't believe ten thousand people show up to hear me so they didn't come to hear me spit we said oh but now but now we're in social media oh bless god we're looking for miracles god's just in heaven he's smiling brother henry right over their head and god just smiled so speak to this rock this is an earlier quote the next one is i'm going to just jump ahead it's a token and it's a 64. so i know what you were thinking and so did the devil he's saying well this is you know before the prophet had uh progressive revelation and so this is a north quote so he maybe was off but the other one's a 64 token message and he's talking about the holy ghost i'll read the first one first he said now wow tonight there's people standing here misreading the brother and he said i'm sitting in a little room here a while and maybe i'm trying to uh come along about a quarter of eight something he's talking about preaching i just want you to get the whole thing here and i'm enjoying the i'm enjoying the singing a brother uh it don't matter who it was i can't even say his name and i trust the lord will let me be a mental be with him when i'm oh be like him when i'm 73 if i live to see it now here's the prophet waiting to come and minister he's enjoying a brother's preaching or singing and he said i want to be just like him fasten your seat belts we're about for takeoff now i've been with this brother for some time now and i know that he's a humble christian and when i first saw him i wondered how he could wear that hair down on his shoulders oh that's gonna hurt wow i never heard that quote before and that long beard why was that question mark he said you have to know this brother and know the reason why and if you known him well then you would know why god only made one of those brothers and that's him and no one else can take his place without the hair to his shoulders and his and he it's three dots but it's long beard amen and now no one says that's someone now someone says that's woman's hair to his shoulders he said now you go back no surprise he said now you go back and read not now listen i'm not recommending y'all leave your hair to your shoulders you want to follow the spirit of your pastor you know i just want to throw that in there because that'll be the next thing i'd be accused of okay but uh he said now if you go back and read the greek on that they were saying that the man's hair to his shoulder was a woman's hair he said if you go back and wear the greek on that he said feminine hair is a way long and that hair to the shoulder was actually short so when men used to put a so man used to pull it around and cut it off and that was short hair but a woman let it grow all the way down way down the back now he couldn't have been talking about african people because women can't even grow hair we know that the prophet said long hair is not cut here okay now this is speak to the rock now i'm into the paragraph that comes for this verse amen this is the pastor this is the prophet's reply so that's the reason jesus his picture that shows here but he didn't have long hair but by no means but he had short hair but by today's standards we show it a lot closer the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but wearing or wearing of apparel the same prophet that preached on holiness but that's also the same prophet said when they came to him said who's going to be saved and they said if your name's on the lam's book of life period period rahab was saved the woman at the well would say some of these quotes go into rehab amen he said so the kingdom of god is not meat and drink or wearing of apparel and it's it's long suffering this is something that you know you know let me just jump in here now i read and i don't i have it on my phone but there was a man that said he said you know how come the world the churches are empty you know i was here yesterday and and it was a unique day for me because i didn't study almost any i did clean a little bit and i just prayed all day it was the very shortest prayer i ever prayed i prayed the lord's prayer and i said lord show me if it's me it's me but show me i said i know i'm the problem but please show me because i can't see it it's got to be it's a problem and it's got to be me and i just pray you show me if we all prayed that wouldn't be a problem i was here four or five hours it's a problem and it's got to be me i sure wish it shall this this guy said he said how come the churches are empty and nobody recognizes christ or what served god it says a very simple answer and our prophet said he would hold us accountable for it because the people don't have jesus that's why they can't see him now i know i know there's the veil i know i know it's veiled from them i know the badger skin quotes i love them i know they didn't see jesus either but they both come together if you're so you know the prophet said that you could be so full of christ that when satan gets up in the morning and he has a few hundred you know what they said the what 200 000 demons that were released in the rivers euphrates and so satan wakes up you know because he's not infinite like god so he has to sleep at night and he needs a lot of sleep because he's got you know demons bothering him too and so when he wakes up in the morning then he looks at his two hundred thousand demons and he said now now you know harry over here in spite said i think i'll send you to wyoming church and i think i'll you know i'll give you know one brother matt and brother henry and jared and brother jim and you know i said spread the demons out now and those those those 240 000 demons that were released on the river euphrates just to torture the bride of christ they would come up to say just picture this this is this is a scene before heaven every earth or hell every morning and they just go now no no please please i was there last week you can get to that spot it won't be by pride or knowing it all or quoting the quotes or having holiness or on and on it'll be by life be by life you know but satan this is what normally happens that's what could happen if more people called and said lord i know there's a problem and it's got to be me please show me that's what could happen but this is what does happen tomorrow morning satan comes up and says okay you know you you spirit demons you know you're 200 000 you know there's not that much bride around he said i'll send you you know to wyoming and oh no no let's use another name oh we'll send you to uh toronto the torch of the bride and they go ah praise god this is gonna be fun i'll go check out their facebook page and that'll spread over the sin all over the world that's what could happen so it does happen most of the time but it don't have to be like that it could be like our prophet said that he said a man of god can get so close to god that the very thought of a demon coming on you or a spirit comes to tempt you would tremble the spirit beyond compare because of the torture shirt let me repeat that because of the torture the life of christ would put on thy demon oh before i go if god would ever do that it'd be the greatest pleasure of my life he said now the kingdom of god is not meat and drink or wearing of apparel it's long suffering goodness meekness i understand brother patience and the holy ghost that's the kingdom of god so i want to read this scripture and then we're going to start a prayer line and pray for the sick and he said now if the holy ghost shall come into our presence tonight and bless you this is all regarding this scripture and bless us with his great august presence being i trust that you if you're unsaved you'll be saved here tonight and if you're sick you'll be healed and if there's any one wayward here that you may come back to god tonight and that's with god in their heart and the first motive that's the first motive the secondary motive is those fairway people might be healed and then the third is for the glory of god that the saints might be refreshed and watching and looking on he said the gospel is not watch this now this is the same there's paragraph five speaking he said now the gospel is not altogether word this is the word of god and all things must be based upon this word if it isn't it isn't true this is but jesus said go into all the world now this whoa we're ready for another takeoff you better fasten up we're no we're up there but we're hitting turbulence he said now jesus said that's the prophet but jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature now he didn't say this is what this believe me we're hitting an air pocket he didn't say teach the word i'm like i read the quote i'm like huh i'm like huh he didn't say teach your word he said preach the gospel and so the gospel consists of more than teaching the word oh for paul confirmed that said that the gospel came to us not by word only but by the but through the power and demonstration of the holy ghost which was love meekness longsuffering patience gentleness of the life of christ that the holy spirit would come and demonstrate to demonstrate the gospel bringing the word into living reality i think that that just is that's just amazing see if you just receive the word by no watch it this is this is the issue this is just if you just receive the message it says the word by knowing the word that doesn't do you any good g.o.o.d well bless god i went hunting with the prophet and i fished with the prophet and i went to brown tabernacle and i seen his moose head and i went to the tomb and i seen the stone and i felt the spirit of the cloud coming out of the stone and and and i went to the lat knob continues the ladder kills but the spirit gives life and when you must be born again and when the spirit of god quickens the word to you in other words like a grain of corn it's lying in my hand and it's just a grain of corn and it never be nothing else but you bury it and it contaminates and molds and it becomes meek and then it brings another grain of corn up wow see you'll never receive the token by memorizing the message no no we and we believe the message i'm not taking it away but it's a life live me your testimony don't tell me your testimony leave me your testimony show me your testimony when everything's going wrong i'll watch from a distance in case there's a storm that's what every daughter of god needs to do before they marry a man watch watch the boy when you're thinking of a man watch him when he talks to his mom watch him when he talks to his grandma watch him how many times he goes to the hospital to visit the sick and the ugly with the diaper and then watch when somebody crosses his doctrine which is true doctrine and how he dropped the mess well watch that too because he'll drop the mitts on you after the wedding oh even though he's right he'll still huh you know what i use it regular prophet talks about the man he was trying to see who had the holy ghost and the guy that had the right doctrine never had the holy ghost the guy that had the wrong doctrine but the right spirit said he's got it yeah we need we need more of them not oh bless god he showed me 29 years ago and if you think i'm changing bless god he showed me dad's in heaven he just smiles man here's the token this is a 640308 message and he said so today he said just remember i'm sorry this is unique but i i just you know i was going to mention on joshua and i just i just put those bible verses underneath there because because uh you know this is this is another comment exactly to this verse and i'm starting two paragraphs above it and i'm going to read two below he said so it is today just remember when god the wrath destroyed a destroyer that came and the big system fell the token kept the house safe he's talking about rahab's house amen but cause because but safe but not because she was good woman no because she had faith and applied the token now what if she had said yeah them are them was fine men and i certainly enjoyed the message that they gave but honestly it sounded now watches it sounded quite silly to have a string hanging out of my window i'll just put it on the inside and it would have foul meaning her house see obedience is better than sacrifice everything god does looks silly amen like preaching is ridiculous through the foolishness of preaching you thought it had to be a good preacher it's all foolishness god chose to save men he was god so he got to pay amen i'll just pull it in and that would have fell he said but god honored the token because it was life now joshua was the type of jesus because joshua means a jehovah's savior and he was the type of of christ the true token sign the messenger that has preached and you know and you can go back and we may do a message on that joshua stayed true with the token sign and all that was under it was saved in egypt and all that was under it was saved in jericho and the lamb's blood is the type today of the token the holy ghost is token today under all saved out from underneath covenant and he uses uh hebrews 13 10 which is the same yesterday forever and hebrews 13 20. they called everlasting covenant the old covenant the one thing and he called the everlasting covenant and the old covenant is one thing this is a new new and this is an everlasting covenant he said now here we go to the direct quote the prophet used for the scripture now god's blood god's blood-bound promises make us free from sin and shame different from the rest of the world see you have freedom but you won't show everything to the world watch this jesus never had jesus preached in parables and the pride the disciples came to him privately and he and i preached a message on that and she said why do you preach in parables it's not given to them hallelujah oh just think god chose to give it to you that's amazing for the rest of the world and now watch this i better start over is it already if i start over again just one sentence god blood bound promises make us free from sin and shame and different from the rest of the world period you don't have to dress different period i read them i went into lapping fit anyone can dress different if you think you dress holy look at the muslims they cover their head you'd have pickles this now this a word for word you don't have to dress different anybody can dress different you have to be on the inside different oh okay the life is on the inside not in dressing and wearing three dots the kingdom of god is not meat nor drink or wearing of apparel but it is long-suffering goodness gentleness patience and the holy ghost now you know and i preached it i will believe in holiness until the day i die deuteronomy 22 8 without holiness no man will see god man not supposed to wear women's apparel and women not wear man's apparel but hell will be full of people and holiness clothes it'll be right full of it in holiness clothes it'll be also great full of people that don't wear a wedding bed be grateful by the way it just comes to me fresh and the quote where the prophet talked about nazarene wouldn't baptize people with the wedding ban and our prophet is amazing he said you know wedding bands were in the bible i didn't know that he said there were a different type of bag he said in the bible and like it's back in the other quote i won't go back to it he said in the bible a wedding band was a necklace with nine jewels on it and your husband give it to your wife to show wed so see here's a whole holiness movement taking a scripture out of context when in the same bible they wore a gold necklace that was a wedding man see that's what my desire is to be balanced don't just take this and just jump off the cliff let's you know what i mean like at least look at them all like you know what are we gonna do with these ones we'll cover them up i don't like the months amen for life is on the inside not it's uh okay and now promise the promise makes you free from sin it shows that god don't recognize god don't recognize your sin now that should make like you're you're falling asleep or something like that shouldn't make you just go are you kidding you're born it's in shape and iniquity and god don't even recognize it and the old accused of the nervous say oh you see what brother dale did i got a full record of the scheme of that god says i don't even know what you're talking about show me proof well he said i got it on this thing he said i can't vindicate that paper it's wrote on toilet paper you know it was like when we were doing my dad's will you know and we were telling the lord you know see my dad always meant for it to be this way they say well do you got that rope and them sign on it document it and he said well no but he always said that he wanted you know what you got proof do you want a document i got proof i got proof you want to see my proof god doesn't recognize your sin wow you got it but he can't see it man you're quiet you should be just whoa doing laps whoo you're born in sin shaped an iniquity and the devil's got proof that he's got it and god said oh not my bride not my bride no no no he said i got it right here and i'll roll the toilet paper i said i was keeping track don't show me the sins of my youth and all this these sins what are you talking about what are you talking about i just kept record from when they were in heaven i didn't keep record once they came to heart i was keeping the record from heaven and it's all clear oh and you kept the record from hearts yeah but we got this buffer it's called the blood wow god the cross wow oh that just oh man the promises make you free from sin now this by the way this is our prophet brother brown the promises make you free from sin and shows that god don't even recognize your sin david said blessed is a man who god will not impute sin to and god will never impute sin over the token because the token paid the sign that god had already the token was the blood had already received the sign and bought it and purchased the price and redeemed you he already owned you he was just buying you back what was already his property redeemed you back to worship him and show forth the power of his promises whoa and the new testament means a new covenant what you see a new testament we're living under paul's message not moses praise god i don't have to wash my hands before i eat today like vicky says bless god next time when vicky says wash your hands before you eat you just say we're living under paul's testament we're living under grace i'm ready to go praise the lord amen we're living under the new testament which means a new covenant and the blood the blood means life the new testament is the holy ghost temple testament the holy ghost is giving a testimony what that jesus christ is raised from the dead and showed that jesus met every requirement every requirement for what i do in my backyard every requirement for us and is alive today the token provides that he is alive and identified himself with us according to his promises and now how can a man read the bible and see his promises and not see christ return in this last day you know the prophet said some praise god when i was studying this week i i just i just i just was happy i was just saying you know he said how come all the ghost-filled christians praise god that believe the message and are just so entoned with they got it all memorized never want to think of the rapture happening our prophet said that this week i just bought had another big one he said you know when people say that the the rapture could take place in june they say oh i just want to push a way off he said you got to be kidding me they said this is what a prophet said he said the rapture is something that the bible says that neither mind nor thought or imagination or dream could even comprehend what god has in store for you but we don't want to go there yet oh and you had the holy ghost okay you got god but you don't want to go to god might because you have a different god wow that was free nothing against he said return in the last days in the form of the holy ghost and identify himself alive in the token and that's a sign of the price faith now he said he said don't rely on works he said don't rely on sensations now i like feelings there's no doubt about it but he said i felt chills to go down my back and i smelt something and i had blood come out of my hands and i had some oil drip off my fingers and i won my bachelor's degree in divinity and i danced in the spirit and i shouted and i spoke in tongues and he said those things might all be good but they have nothing to do and i have nothing to do against them but that's not got one thing to do with it what i'm talking about he said i'm talking about identifying the token that jesus christ has raised in us now and identified himself and vindicated the promised word for this day but we got to go back to our scriptures now and see that that don't allow us to show the world what god's done for us now that'll be the hardest thing you maybe ever did but that's what the bible says see god's done things for you you can't show the world because they won't get it they won't understand it the bible says that and so if it's gonna stumble your brother because we're gonna have a fire out here on a sunday and cook some good old-fashioned beef you know you tell them ahead of time don't come to church or you don't have the fire that that's forgive me but you see what i'm saying be careful what you post on facebook be careful what you use if you're going to use it and now either make it really neutral or put jesus first don't show what you do in your backyard and it's not sin i'm not putting you in a guilt trip it's not sin what you did with your kids it's not sin having a swimming pool the prophet went swimming with his kids and they didn't swim with overhauls on but they didn't put it on facebook the prophet cut his grasp repeatedly with his shirt off but he didn't come to church with his shirt off amen so you know if you're going to the algonquin park i don't care what you do in algonquin park if you're you know me but we're living in a world that everybody goes and we're stumbling people and you say well bless god that he might yes it is your problem it is your problem because the bible said it was your problem because god died for those people and you're offending them you're offending them you know i i try you know i told my kids this i said you know people will come up you know you're gonna have friends on you we're family and friends and people that you know neighbors and if they put something inappropriate on nobody knows you've seen that unless you like it or comment so if your neighbors that are just neighbors put on bikini swimsuits and they shouldn't have done that but they're they're your neighbors and you're on their facebook because whatever don't like it and don't comment it because when you like or comment it then it comes up on your page and i see it and i go uh-oh problem here you see or you know like you can just you see we went camping this past weekend or a month ago it don't matter what we did camping it was my kids and my grandkids man but i won't share those pictures on facebook one day i wore my pajamas all day amen it's not public amen you see not sin but we need to be careful and and our attitude is well blessed god it's my right i'm a facebook no it's not your right no it's not you're right because well because let me i i'm sorry and i'm gonna shut up here soon it's not you're right because of this sorry exodus 19 5. i'm going to start reading this before she gets here just so we're going faster this is why it is not your right to post on facebook things that are not sin now therefore i will have you obey my voice indeed and keep my commandments and then shall you be up peculiar treasure onto me all the people of the earth is mine let's go to uh there's a whole bunch like that first peter 2 9. first peter 2 9. for you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation i'll pecu your people that shall show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness unto his light that's why you can't show on facebook things man you're going to put on facebook say hey i was at church in wyoming it was just not well don't say where you went say i went to church see if you got to watch you see the popularity oh brother and jail don't post who your pastor is you see i'll fight with the popularity i'm serious you raised me up i'll br god will bring me down huh now you can tell me in secret but see but public see that's different you say oh i think you're a great pastor but when you post it on facebook completely different the same words completely different amen it's like it's like like in the bible god made the bad undefiled but satan came and made hong mai like prostitutes and everything else see god it's the same fact but god the satan twisted it and that's see so see you got to watch the popularity money and women you watch these spirits but because we're god made a peculiar people amen deuteronomy 14 2. i want to just read some of these quicker scriptures with our holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord has chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations of the earth deuteronomy 26 18 for the lord hath uh uh uh oh i can't even say that a voice about thee this day to be as peculiar people as he hath promised thee that thou shalt keep all his commandments ecclesiastics two and eight said i gather me also silver and gold and a peclet your treasure unto the king of the princess man that's not talking about people i'm sorry i had the peculiar in it amen that's why because we're peculiar because we're a chosen generation and a royal priesthood it does matter what you show the world it does matter i'm not saying don't have facebook saying be careful what you post you know you can it just satan will twist everything the prophet even the prophet said how people misunderstood and it's not that you're ministers but you'll say things on there you know uh uh just whatever you might not or you're having a pool party and the neighbor women come up yes and it's our responsibility it's got to hold us accountable if we offend one of the little ones amen god help us amen god help us be careful the word we're living in man and use if we're going to do something put him out there first and if people are offended with christ well then then you're cleared but you can have peace with your family and it will not bring the same peace to somebody else not even close
