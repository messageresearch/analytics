IF YOU HAVE THE BIBLE, YOU COULD TURN IT WITH ME. I'M JUST LAYING OUT SOMETHING TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. WE TALK ABOUT HALLELUJAH. THE TREE SUNSHIP THAT JESUS CAME IN. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HERE IN MATTHEW 15:E 21, THEN JESUS WENT THENCE AND DEPARTED IN THE COAST OF TYRIE AND SIDEN.

BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO APPROACH HIM IN THE RIGHT WAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH HIM, TO KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS HIM. WE CAN ADDRESS HIM IN THE WRONG WAY. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT JESUS THEY WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE WHEN EVEN WHEN THEY'RE PRAYING, BROTHER DALE, &gt;&gt; THAT THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE PRAYING, THEY SAY, "JESUS OF NAZARETH." &gt;&gt; YES. JESUS OF NAZARETH. WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE PRAYING IN SUCH MANNER AS SAID JESUS OF NAZARETH, IT MEANS YOU'RE FIXING YOU'RE FIXING HIM INTO A A A SPECIFIC LOCATION. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT JESUS OF NAZARETH. HE'S JESUS OF THE UNIVERSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE'S JESUS OF THE UNIVERSE. AND TODAY WHEN PEOPLE ARE PRAYING, HALLELUJAH, I LOOK AT THAT AS IGNORANCE, LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO WONDER WHY BROTHER PETER WHEN HE CAUGHT THE REVELATION AND HE SAID THIS SAME JESUS WHOM YOU CRUCIFIED, GOD HAD MADE HIM LORD AND SAVIOR. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WERE ADDRESSING HIM AS JESUS OF NAZARETH. AND BROTHER PETER SAID, "YOU MUST REPENT." AND THE REPENT MEANS CHANGE YOUR THINKING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CHANGE YOUR THINKING. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEIR THINKING WAS HE WAS JESUS OF NAZARETH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, PRAISE GOD. AND THE BIBLE SAID, HALLELUJAH. VERSE 20. VERSE 23. BUT HE ANSWERED HER NOT A WORD. AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME AND BESOUGHT HIM, SAYING, "SEND HER AWAY." IN OTHER WORDS, HER LANGUAGE WAS DIFFERENT. SO THE DISCIPLES, THEY ALL SPAKE WITH GALILEE TONGUES, HEBREW. HALLELUJAH. SO THIS WOMAN HER LANGUAGE WAS SYRIAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO THE DISCIPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE. THAT'S WHY THEY SAID SHE CRY AFTER US. &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS, HE WAS LORD OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. &gt;&gt; HE UNDERSTOOD EVERY LANGUAGE. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EVERY LANGUAGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID IN VERSE 24, "BUT HE ANSWERED AND SAID, I AM NOT SENT BUT UNTO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL." IN OTHER WORDS, I'M NOT SENT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M ONLY SENT TO ISRAEL. SHOWING THAT SHE WAS A GENTILE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT LOOK AT HER DETERMINATION. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT HER PERSEVERANCE. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

YES. &gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW WHEN HE ADDRESSED HIM AS YOUR LORD, HE CANNOT DENY YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLE, YOU CALL ME LORD AND MASTER. SO AM I. YOU SAID WELL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ALL THINGS WERE CREATED BY HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO HE'S LORD OVER EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD.

YOU WILL GET THE RESULT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE BIBLE SAID, SAYING, LORD, HELP ME. VERSE 26, BUT HE ANSWERED AND SAID, IT IS NOT MEAT TO TAKE THE CHILDREN'S BREAD AND TO CAUSE IT TO DOGS BECAUSE THE GENTILE WERE CONSIDERED DOGS. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE CONSIDERED REMONGERS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO JESUS SAID IT IS NOT MEAT TO TAKE THE CHILDREN'S BREAD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE WAS INSULTING HER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD.

IT MEANS RESPECT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS ADORATION. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS HUMILITY. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS SUBMISSION. NO WONDER WHY BROTHER JAMES SAID IN JAMES 4 VERSE 7 HE SAYS SUBMIT YOURSELF &gt;&gt; UNTO GOD &gt;&gt; AND RESIST THE DEVIL &gt;&gt; AND HE WILL FLEE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU WORSHIP GOD HALLELUJAH BECAUSE WHEN YOU SUBMIT IT MEANS YOU'RE SUBMITTING TO HIS WILL. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SUBMITTING TO HIS PURPOSE.

HE SAID GOD REVEALED TO HIM THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A FLOOD TO DESTROY THE WHOLE EARTH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S BUILDING AND HE HAS BUILT A HAR. &gt;&gt; OH MY GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WRONG SEASON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

GENESIS 22, we see that Abraham, &gt;&gt; HE WAS A MIGHTY MAN, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And also a prophet. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HE'S THE FATHER &gt;&gt; OF FAITH, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND IN VERSE 22, I'M JUST GOING to go really slow with this. AND IT CAME TO PASS after these things. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THAT GOD DID TEMPT ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO PAUSE ON THAT. TEMP. SEE THE WORD THE TEMPT. HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID, JAMES SAID, "LET NO MAN SAY YOU'RE TEMPTED BY GOD WITH EVIL." BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT TEMPT YOU WITH EVIL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "A MAN IS TEMPTED WHEN HE'S DRAWN AWAY &gt;&gt; BY HIS OWN LUST AND ENTICE." &gt;&gt; RIGHT. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO THIS WHAT IS THIS STEM NOW THAT HALLELUJAH THAT GOD HERE IS TALKING ABOUT TO ABRAHAM. THIS STEM MEANS TEST. &gt;&gt; GOD TEST IS DIFFERENT FROM SATAN TEST. &gt;&gt; WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD LOVES TO TEST HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID? &gt;&gt; GOD LOVE TO TEST HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE REASON WHY GOD TEST HIS PEOPLE IS BECAUSE HE WANT TO CONFIRM, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; GOD WANT TO CONFIRM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT YOU ARE TRUE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID THERE'S NO OTHER MAN UP ON THE EARTH THAT IS MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN JOB. &gt;&gt; Y. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT? AND GOD TEST JOB, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT SATAN TEST IS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; WHEN SATAN TEST SOMEBODY, HE WANTS TO CORRUPT YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT IS HIS PURPOSE IS TO CORRUPT AND TO DESTROY YOU. &gt;&gt; AND TO GET YOU WEAK, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN GOD TESTS YOU, HE WANTS TO CONFIRM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO STRENGTHEN YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. OH, praise God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HERE GO. HE SAID, "AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT GOD DID TEMPT ABRAHAM." LET ME READ IT IN HIS CORRECT IN A IN THE CORRECT WAY. &gt;&gt; IT CAME TO PASS THAT GOD DID TEST ABRAHAM, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO, I'm reading it in in in HIS CORRECT TERM. THAT GOD DID TEST ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. AND GOD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM, AND HE SAID UNTO HIM, ABRAHAM, AND HE SAID, BEHOLD, HERE I AM. HE SAID, TAKE NOW THY SON, JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THINE ONLY SON. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Look at that. Look at the first test. &gt;&gt; TAKE THINE ONLY SON. &gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION. HOW MUCH SON DID ABRAHAM HAVE? &gt;&gt; He had two son. &gt;&gt; HE GOT THE FIRST SON WAS ISHMAEL. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BUT ISHMAEL WHEN HE GET ISHMAEL HIS NAME WAS ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS ABRAHAM. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU FOLLOWING ME NOW? &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; THEN GOD CHANGED HIS NAME AFTERWARDS TO ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE GET UM ISAAC. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID, "HALLELUJAH." HE SAID, "EVERY NAME CARRY A SPIRIT." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THE FIRST THING GOD DOES IS CHANGE A MAN'S NAME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD SAID TAKE THINE ONLY SON ABRAHAM BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE BECAUSE OF HIS obedience &gt;&gt; glory TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AND YOU TALK ABOUT THIS SON THAT GOD PROMISED HIM. &gt;&gt; HE WAITED FOR THIS SON FOR 25 YEARS. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; 25 YEARS HE WAITED FOR THIS SON. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE SON WAS ABOUT 8 YEARS OLD, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "NOW, ABRAHAM, &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOVE YOUR SON MORE THAN ME. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE IF YOU'RE FAITHFUL TO YOUR SON MORE THAN ME." JESUS MY LORD. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT EACH TIME YOU GROW, GOD TESTS YOU. &gt;&gt; EACH TIME, EACH LEVELS THAT YOU GROW, THERE'S A TEST TO THE LEVEL. &gt;&gt; YOU HEARING ME, SOMEBODY? &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LEVEL, IF YOU'RE AT LEVEL FAITH, THERE'S A TEST AT LEVEL FAITH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE AT LEVEL VIRTUE, &gt;&gt; THERE'S A TEST AT LEVEL VIRTUE. CAN YOU SEE THE STATUE OF A &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SEE THE PYRAMID THERE? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; EACH LEVEL THAT YOU GO, THERE'S A TEST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND EACH TIME YOU OVERCOME THAT TEST, YOU KEEP GROWING. &gt;&gt; YOU KEEP GROWING. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM ABRAHAM'S SON HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT. ISAAC HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE SAID HE DIG A WELL, THERE WAS A TEST. &gt;&gt; AND HE MOVE AWAY AND DIG ANOTHER WELL. AND THERE WAS ANOTHER TEST. &gt;&gt; AND HE MOVE AWAY AND DIG ANOTHER WELL. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER TEST. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THERE WAS ANOTHER TEST. &gt;&gt; SO EACH LEVEL YOU KEEP CLIMBING. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE TESTS. &gt;&gt; AND THAT TEST IS MAKING YOU STRONGER AND STRONGER AND STRONGER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID, HALLELUJAH. HE SAID, "YOU SHALL CHANGE FROM GLORY UNTO GLORY UNTO GLORY." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE'RE HAVING CHURCH THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD OF GOD SAID, "THINE ONLY SON ISAAC, WHOM THOU LOVEST." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whom thou lovest. &gt;&gt; I love my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND GET THEE INTO THE LAND OF MORIAH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And offered HIM THERE FOR A BURNT OFFERING UP UPON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH I WILL TELL THEE OF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. God was very clear. &gt;&gt; He was very clear. &gt;&gt; He said, "I WANT YOU TO OFFER YOU AS a sacrifice." &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PURPOSE? WHEN YOU HEAR SACRIFICE, WHAT COMES TO YOU is is to kill. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you know that when God see that you love something more. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; HE WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE IT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HE WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. HE WANT YOU TO KILL IT. &gt;&gt; JESUS. Some persons love money more than they love God. &gt;&gt; And God say, "I WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE THAT." &gt;&gt; SACRIFICE IT. &gt;&gt; SOME PERSONS LOVE THEIR WIFE MORE THAN THEY LOVE GOD. AND GOD SAY, "I WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE IT." &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE LOVE THEIR HUSBAND MORE THAN GOD. AND GOD SAY, "I WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE IT." &gt;&gt; Jesus my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember we read the scripture and this is the love &gt;&gt; when we keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "OFFER HIM THERE FOR A BURNT OFFERING UPON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH I WILL TELL THEE OF." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO IT WAS GOD WHO WAS GOING TO TELL ABRAHAM WHICH MOUNTAIN TO GO. ABRAHAM didn't know where he was going. &gt;&gt; He was just FOLLOWING INSTRUCTION. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, HE was obedient. &gt;&gt; IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE OBEDIENT. &gt;&gt; HIS FAITH PRODUCED OBEDIENCE. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE BIBLE SAID THEN AND THE THIRD DAY. BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS MOUNTAIN ACCORDING TO HISTORY &gt;&gt; THIS MOUNTAIN ABRAHAM WAS DWELLING IN BEASHEA AT THE TIME? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE MOUNTAIN FROM FROM BEHIBA TO THIS MOUNTAIN WAS ACTUALLY 40 MILES. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; THE DISTANCE WAS 40 MILES. &gt;&gt; WOW.

IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THREE DAYS. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS SHOWING US SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS SHOWING US IN OUR JOURNEY. HE WAS PUTTING HIM SOME TIGHTS AND SHADOWS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE THE PROPHET PICK UP THE INSPIRATION, &gt;&gt; RIGHT?

IT WAS A TIME OF THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THREE DAYS JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. FAR TO MARS WAS THE DISTANCE &gt;&gt; AND IT TAKE ABRAHAM 3 DAYS &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID HE LIFTED IT WAS ON THE THIRD DAY HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES. THAT WORD LIFTED LIFT UP MEANS TO RISE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN OUR JOURNEY WE HAVE TO RISE &gt;&gt; RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. Come with ME NOW. &gt;&gt; IN OUR JOURNEY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE UP YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; GOD REQUIRES SOMETHING OF YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD REQUIRE YOU TO RISE. &gt;&gt; RISE ABOVE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; RISE ABOVE YOUR CONDITION. &gt;&gt; RISE ABOVE YOUR SITUATION. HE SAID TAKE UP YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS TO PICK UP YOURSELF, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ON THE THIRD DAY, YOU GOT TO PICK UP YOURSELF. HE SAID, THE PROPHET SAID, YOU GOT TO BE PERSEVERE. HE SAID, HALLELUJAH. HE SAID, GLORY TO GOD. HE SAID, JACOB WAS PERSEVERE.

MOUNTAIN CAN ALSO MEAN A PROMOTION. &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAID I WANT YOU TO COME TO A MOUNTAIN, meaning I'm giving you a promotion. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN THE PROPHET SAID THERE WERE THREE MOUNTAINS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU'RE UP MOUNT CARMEL, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MOUNT ZION. AND HE SAID THERE'S ANOTHER MOUNTAIN &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED IT MOUNT RAPTURING SHOWDOWN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

IS A MOUNT RAPTURING SHOWDOWN. &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS PRESENT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN GOD SAID, YOU GOING TO BE THERE AND RAPTURING SHOW, IT MEANS HE'S READY TO PROMOTE YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR PROMOTION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE BIBLE SAID CALEB WHEN HE WAS WITH MOSES AND MOSES SAID, "CALEB, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT MOUNTAIN." WHAT WAS THAT?
