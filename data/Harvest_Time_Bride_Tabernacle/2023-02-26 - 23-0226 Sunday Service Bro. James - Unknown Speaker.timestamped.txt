[0:00] that's that's the way God is always
[0:01] worked and
[0:04] and you know you know in the days of
[0:06] Moses one time they said
[0:09] to him when the time had come visit who
[0:11] made you a prince and a ruler of us
[0:14] well if you actually look Moses wasn't
[0:16] looking to be a prince and a ruler
[0:19] because he was already a prince and the
[0:21] ruler in Egypt
[0:22] you know but he was identifying himself
[0:26] with these suffering people so that it
[0:28] the Bible in the book of Acts as they
[0:30] thought they would understand
[0:32] that God will by his hand was about to
[0:35] do something well now I'm not a Moses or
[0:38] nothing like that
[0:39] but you see because of that attitude
[0:42] they end up spending more time in Egypt
[0:44] because then Moses was gone for 40 years
[0:48] you know so if we we always want to
[0:50] tweak our attitude so that we can pick
[0:53] we already made the sacrifice many
[0:56] things happening out there we are in the
[0:58] house of God so we pull what we need
[1:01] and the supernatural presence of God is
[1:04] here because God is omnipresent amen
[1:08] just um
[1:09] greetings from our little church you
[1:13] know the pastor made a point brother
[1:15] Nelson made a point he says greet the
[1:18] church for me once he done that now you
[1:21] know I'm like okay I got to do that but
[1:24] um he says greet them and uh and um
[1:28] that's um
[1:30] that's uh in Scarborough that's I think
[1:34] many of you know him
[1:36] he was away on a missionary in a trip I
[1:39] come back and
[1:41] just I think this would be his first
[1:43] Sunday in a few few weeks uh he has been
[1:46] away
[1:47] so
[1:49] just seeing everybody you know uh the
[1:52] Dale family
[1:54] God bless you
[1:55] and um but the map
[1:58] God bless you and your family
[2:01] brother Bernard sister Ruth
[2:06] and the the little ones
[2:10] is uh
[2:12] names I don't know God bless you
[2:15] you know we are just here just to have a
[2:18] good time in the presence of God
[2:20] appreciate my wife you know she just
[2:23] sang the Great emancipatora
[2:26] whenever I come here I'm reminded
[2:28] that uh it is uh by the Dell
[2:31] and I think brother John it was but but
[2:34] the Dell baptized her
[2:37] you know she came and she gave her life
[2:39] to the Lord
[2:41] and uh we were coming to meetings here
[2:45] when I was still by but they were still
[2:48] buying petroleum there and that's where
[2:50] she got baptized
[2:52] so I always see that God gave us some
[2:54] connection some special connection there
[2:57] amen
[2:58] you know I think that's why she can sing
[3:00] like that the great emancipator
[3:03] you know sometimes people get into where
[3:05] she came
[3:07] because uh
[3:09] she didn't know much about the message
[3:11] and all that but I remember when she
[3:14] came I simply said to her you know what
[3:16] because I became a Christian really when
[3:19] I came here to Canada
[3:21] and I said I I I go to church normally
[3:24] three times a week Sunday Wednesday and
[3:27] Fridays sometimes
[3:30] I said um
[3:31] if you want you can come with me if you
[3:34] want you can stay home
[3:36] I've never believed that matters of
[3:38] faith is a matters of force
[3:41] you know it's like when you take your
[3:43] fruit and you try to voice first ripen
[3:46] it it's still sour inside
[3:49] you know it got it got to go through the
[3:51] process on its own stay in the presence
[3:54] of the Sun
[3:55] and then it's transformed
[3:57] you know that's how I I I introduced she
[4:01] came because she wanted to she wanted to
[4:03] spend all in the process then the gospel
[4:06] took a hold
[4:08] you know
[4:09] um
[4:10] don't be hard up on people you know you
[4:13] can go through all the ceremonies and
[4:15] the rituals dress this way speak this
[4:18] way
[4:19] you know and sometimes people can start
[4:22] doing it but if it's not from the heart
[4:25] it's not it's not benefiting them
[4:28] it got to be a change from the heart
[4:31] now it's not that you are encouraging
[4:33] people to do evil
[4:35] no I mean if it becomes too too out of
[4:39] place and their kind of stuck naked in
[4:41] church wow obviously you got to kind of
[4:44] put an order out to that but a lot of
[4:47] times
[4:48] if you let the people that are supposed
[4:51] to deal with it the churches have pasta
[4:53] and in this case the pastor's wife as
[4:56] well normally they are positioned to
[4:58] deal with those things better
[5:00] you know sometimes I've we've heard
[5:02] stories away maybe people are new they
[5:04] are coming
[5:05] and someone who's a little bit trigger
[5:07] happy they just jump to the person and
[5:09] then they kind of throw them off
[5:13] you know years ago I remember I read
[5:15] that I'm just gonna talk
[5:17] uh and that's that's that's how it is
[5:20] notes but I I really don't care about
[5:23] that it's more a conversation with each
[5:26] other and with Fellowship that's just
[5:28] what it is
[5:30] uh there was a sister
[5:33] she she she had gone to
[5:38] to uh a place she she was kind of a box
[5:42] leading
[5:44] got to know about the message before she
[5:46] backslide but she came from kind of a
[5:48] very broken home
[5:50] you know the the father was abusive I
[5:53] think physically he used to be the mom
[5:55] or something like that
[5:56] and um
[5:58] she then the mom you know was uh she
[6:03] just I guess didn't know how to handle
[6:05] it and then in 10 she was rough with the
[6:07] children so that's the kind of home she
[6:10] grew up in
[6:12] and then uh even though they were kind
[6:14] of nominal Christians so she was a
[6:16] little bit negative about anything
[6:18] called Christianity he goes she's
[6:19] looking at how she's treated in the life
[6:22] she's living
[6:23] anyway then the message came along she
[6:27] found people with a bit different so she
[6:28] started going
[6:30] but then uh she she she threw the hustle
[6:34] and bustle of life she she she just end
[6:37] up sleeping so she wasn't going to
[6:40] church and then one time there was a
[6:42] funeral at the church
[6:45] I saw this uh this uh testimony a few
[6:48] years ago on the voice of God website so
[6:52] they they there was a funeral at the
[6:54] church and um then one of the sisters at
[6:57] the church
[6:58] told you to come to the funeral because
[7:01] I think it's somebody they knew both so
[7:03] she decided to go
[7:05] and when she decided to go she she
[7:07] thought okay fine I'm gonna dress up you
[7:11] know properly
[7:12] then she changed her mind she said
[7:15] you know if I do that that looks like um
[7:19] kind of hypocritical
[7:21] because this is not really how I'm
[7:23] living
[7:24] so then she she just put on her pants
[7:27] nothing too vulgar about pants not not
[7:30] decent she put on she put on your pants
[7:33] just dressed the way she was living
[7:35] she came
[7:37] so she was just expecting that hour you
[7:40] know people maybe she's looking at
[7:41] people somebody looking at me judging me
[7:44] and she's standing there
[7:46] and she said when she was kind of
[7:48] standing in the way he says this brother
[7:50] said to her in the most sweetest voice
[7:53] she ever heard in her life
[7:55] she says uh you know
[7:57] it's so simple it just shook me the way
[8:00] the Simplicity of how God works he says
[8:03] you know sister if if you don't mind
[8:05] just moving on the side because they're
[8:07] going to be moving with the vehicle and
[8:09] and you may be in the way so if you just
[8:12] don't mind he said the most politest the
[8:15] most sweetest voice and then she said
[8:17] wow you called me sister even though I'm
[8:19] dressed like this
[8:22] and that's what attending back to Christ
[8:25] that simple gesture
[8:28] you know sometimes we think that as
[8:30] people are back sleeping
[8:34] we got loved ones
[8:36] I think each one of us here can look
[8:38] maybe he's one loved ones uncles
[8:40] brothers sisters somebody whom we are
[8:43] trying to witness
[8:45] Christ too
[8:46] and uh then sometimes we start thinking
[8:50] wow you know if
[8:52] big Evangelistic service move all gods
[8:56] turn up your people
[8:57] you know we want a big kind of meetings
[9:01] and maybe we go back we see the meetings
[9:05] brother Branham used to have we think
[9:08] like men
[9:09] if it could just go like that maybe
[9:12] they'll attend back to Christ
[9:17] but a lot of times maybe we are looking
[9:20] at it wrong
[9:23] sometimes
[9:25] what God is looking for he just wants
[9:27] you to pick up the core and say man I
[9:30] just called to say hi how are you doing
[9:35] how are you doing
[9:38] that means sometimes a lot than all the
[9:41] sermons you can preach
[9:47] you know I don't know if anybody
[9:49] remembers the the testimony brother
[9:51] Branham gave I think it was old gab or
[9:53] something like that a man called old yab
[9:55] and
[9:56] it wasn't really good at shooting but he
[9:59] loved hunting
[10:00] and uh his wife was a Christian
[10:03] but he wasn't
[10:05] and uh he went hunting
[10:08] uh with the pastor for the while the the
[10:11] the wife's pastor
[10:14] and uh
[10:15] finally
[10:18] then that day is showed a lot of rabbits
[10:22] and it was really good
[10:24] and uh then he gave he says he says uh
[10:27] you know you know you know Pastor I
[10:28] decided to give my life to the Lord
[10:30] the pastor says what salmon did I preach
[10:34] that done that he says well you know
[10:36] they are good pastor you say mom they
[10:39] come from the good old book but
[10:41] but it's not wasn't your sermon
[10:44] what is it then Olga
[10:47] he says well you know I'm not a good
[10:49] shot
[10:50] and I showed all these rabbits I
[10:51] realized that if you would give me so
[10:53] much good game he must love me so much
[10:58] so you know it was in the past a sermon
[11:01] that changed him but the pastor's
[11:04] decision to take him hunting even though
[11:06] he might have been offensive in other
[11:07] ways
[11:09] and then God blessed that and use that
[11:12] so the pastor was used still but not in
[11:15] the manner that you would think
[11:19] Jesus Christ said I work my father
[11:23] worked Sita too and he that too I work
[11:27] some of Jesus
[11:29] greatest sermons was
[11:31] when he's in a little corner somewhere
[11:34] you see is that true you know the salmon
[11:36] we base
[11:38] a lot of our Christian teaching on John
[11:41] 3.
[11:42] it was prayed to a man who came by night
[11:47] it was impressed at a convention
[11:50] the man actually was kind of afraid kind
[11:53] of so that's why he came by night
[11:55] because you know they'd agree that
[11:57] whosoever identifies himself with Jesus
[11:59] is going to be kicked out of the church
[12:01] and this is one of them a Pharisee
[12:06] it wasn't even preached to what you call
[12:08] a regular message believe of that day it
[12:12] was preached if I received who came
[12:14] asking
[12:16] they say you must be born again
[12:20] these are some of Jesus greatest
[12:23] teachings and preachings
[12:27] one time one of the greatest sermons
[12:30] Jesus if a priest was in a tombstone
[12:33] and he said we must go over the other
[12:35] side
[12:38] where are we going we got out some
[12:41] preaching there
[12:44] well we didn't organize anything Pastor
[12:46] Jesus
[12:47] no there is
[12:50] where is the fellowship hall
[12:53] he's in the graveyard
[12:57] who's the audience it's one
[13:03] you mean 12 riches in there
[13:06] the Son of God for one person is a yes
[13:12] and when he went there after he finished
[13:14] with the legion Legion really wasn't his
[13:17] name is what the demon said
[13:20] when he's finished with that man nobody
[13:22] else wanted to hear him
[13:25] because they were upset that they lost
[13:26] their pigs and all that and they told
[13:28] him to leave right
[13:30] and the man said well I'm gonna follow
[13:32] you Jesus
[13:34] Jesus actually says no no no no no don't
[13:36] come to my church
[13:38] go and start your own
[13:40] go and testify what God has done
[13:44] right we've got to change the
[13:46] traditional
[13:48] you know I put it in quotes message way
[13:51] of thinking the message is Christ
[13:55] whatsoever Christ is the message is
[13:57] there
[13:59] sometimes the message is in the
[14:01] tombstones
[14:03] where these dead people
[14:05] sometimes the message is in a temple
[14:08] sometimes the message is on the streets
[14:14] there was even one time Jesus says when
[14:16] I'm preaching to this one I don't want
[14:18] preachers here
[14:19] I'm coming myself
[14:21] so he sent the preachers to buy bread
[14:23] the woman of Samaria
[14:25] he said all the preachers go and buy
[14:27] bread
[14:29] and then he come he start talking to the
[14:31] woman
[14:33] and the way he presented himself to the
[14:35] woman he actually presented himself like
[14:38] he's the one in need
[14:39] he says can I have some water
[14:42] so then they started the everyday
[14:43] thought you know we don't get along
[14:46] there's discrimination here we don't
[14:48] talk to you Jews you don't talk to us
[14:50] Americans why are you talking to me
[14:53] so they just start talking they talk of
[14:55] the day
[14:56] so Jesus starts saying something
[15:00] and the Bible says when the preachers
[15:01] came they wanted that he talked to a
[15:03] woman
[15:04] but they were afraid to ask him because
[15:06] he's Jesus right
[15:09] you see
[15:10] and then then then then
[15:13] he says I got rid of that you know
[15:15] nothing about
[15:17] you see anybody brought him food so he
[15:20] actually said I must pass
[15:22] a must
[15:25] you see so all these to tell you and say
[15:28] prepare yourself you know we are
[15:31] speaking to believer here a lot of us
[15:33] you know have been um
[15:36] saving the Lord for a while and
[15:38] when God brings us into the faith he
[15:40] brings us to use users
[15:43] but uh we have to prepare our mindset in
[15:47] such a way that he uses us we don't want
[15:50] to ever be in a situation where God is
[15:53] really pressing on to want to use us and
[15:56] we are missing it
[15:58] because our mindset is set a certain way
[16:01] God don't play the game of numbers at
[16:04] all
[16:07] actually I'll tell you for for myself
[16:09] when God begin to deal with me in terms
[16:12] of preaching I I'm not ashamed to say
[16:14] this that the deepest and most anointing
[16:19] preaching that I've ever preached in all
[16:21] the time God has had me to preach was
[16:23] when I was preaching to one person
[16:26] and that person was so zoned in he's
[16:29] like
[16:30] I'm speaking things the way I'm thinking
[16:32] like
[16:33] I never heard that and I know that
[16:36] Revelation is coming that's how much
[16:38] they were pulling
[16:39] and God started dealing with me it's not
[16:42] a game of numbers
[16:44] my father works in the two and did the
[16:46] two at work you know people when
[16:48] meetings and the conversions are dumb
[16:51] people work themselves into an atmosis
[16:54] so they feel something I'm not saying
[16:56] they are not feeling God they are
[16:57] because the reason they are feeling God
[17:00] is got nothing to do with numbers is
[17:02] because they've prepared their heart to
[17:04] pull from God
[17:06] that's why they would feel God that's
[17:08] why they say what a meaning we had
[17:11] you see but if anybody came under that
[17:14] expectation
[17:15] in the presence of Jesus it doesn't
[17:19] matter who's around they'll feel the
[17:21] same thing
[17:23] the most profound things Jesus is
[17:26] revealed to people sometimes is by
[17:28] themselves one time Jesus actually went
[17:31] to a place he hadn't gone to really
[17:34] preach he had gone there maybe just to
[17:36] Fellowship a little bit he said damn
[17:39] and uh and just like that you know I'm
[17:43] just doing this for demonstration
[17:44] purposes he sit down he's tired I guess
[17:48] he did a campaign
[17:49] and Martha is in the kitchen there she's
[17:52] doing what she's doing
[17:54] Mary said you know what Jesus is come
[17:57] here
[17:59] I'm pulling what I need
[18:01] she came she said at the feet of Jesus
[18:05] she began to hear things
[18:09] and it was such a tremendous thing and
[18:12] in the meantime Martha knows nothing
[18:14] about it she's busy in the kitchen no
[18:16] nothing wrong with that because people
[18:18] have to eat but you see what she ended
[18:20] up doing she went to Jesus she mastered
[18:24] don't you care my sister is not helping
[18:25] me
[18:27] you know how ridiculous that sounds
[18:30] she's telling the Creator that you don't
[18:34] know how to create to correct Mary
[18:36] so let me tell you so that you can
[18:38] correct her
[18:39] she does of course she's not thinking
[18:41] all that
[18:42] she's there thinking we need to save man
[18:44] we need to make people welcome Jesus was
[18:47] he knows all those you know Jesus is not
[18:49] about a big rebuke he come and says
[18:53] you are comfortable with too many things
[18:55] I say one thing is needful
[18:58] and Mary has chosen that
[19:01] so Mary had a Revival where nobody else
[19:05] knew about it it's just the way we look
[19:09] at it
[19:10] when we have that you see God just
[19:13] moving
[19:15] in a mind
[19:16] Mighty way
[19:18] away from
[19:20] the big action he moves there if he
[19:23] chooses to he's God he's sovereign
[19:26] but God is never a showman even if he
[19:29] moves among thousands he's not a Showman
[19:32] showman that's Hollywood stuff you know
[19:35] but God does something for a particular
[19:38] purpose and when we come under
[19:40] expectation
[19:42] we were received from God
[19:44] Hallelujah
[19:47] is the truth
[19:49] is the truth
[19:51] so we prepare our mind to be in that
[19:54] mindset then we can pull and then
[19:57] and then that's it
[19:59] 444
[20:04] that wasn't premeditated
[20:07] that was just what came upon my heart to
[20:09] say
[20:10] you know so
[20:13] don't take offense if it may sound
[20:15] offensive no
[20:18] it's uh we we are we are brothers the
[20:21] Bible says this you say you say you have
[20:23] one master and that's Christ all you are
[20:26] brothers
[20:28] that's why to me there's no top 10 in
[20:31] the message it's in their head
[20:33] it doesn't work with God
[20:38] zero zilch
[20:41] do you know do you imagine the amount of
[20:43] effort it needed to deliver Legion
[20:47] with the Legion of demons
[20:52] how much prayer how much anointing is
[20:54] needed to deal with that
[20:57] so it's not a game of numbers
[21:00] sometimes one battle is more intense
[21:03] than 70 bottles depending on what you're
[21:06] dealing with
[21:08] instead of praying for loved ones that
[21:10] are addicted to drugs cocaine and heroin
[21:14] and the power of God you know that well
[21:16] there's no it's not about psychology
[21:18] because they know that I'm a mess I'm a
[21:22] mess
[21:23] I'm broken but they just can't help it
[21:27] and they try everything
[21:29] oh my goodness I remember about the dad
[21:32] who we dealt with this father he said he
[21:34] said I said Is it someone I don't know
[21:36] what else to do for sure
[21:39] and the Sun is made it's just such a
[21:42] mess and and and and he he desires to be
[21:45] free they just don't know how
[21:47] then you need a supernatural power of
[21:50] God to move
[21:52] you got them to know your God and I
[21:55] understand that this demon power
[21:57] you come face to face you think that
[22:00] battle is easy
[22:01] it's not a game of numbers
[22:04] the game of numbers is the game of man
[22:06] but the bottom one time I think he
[22:08] prayed was it for a blind person for our
[22:12] reaching out to God
[22:15] until finally the person
[22:17] breaks free
[22:19] you see we got to give that passion for
[22:21] Souls
[22:23] you know
[22:24] and then God will own us
[22:27] when we start bringing our loved ones
[22:29] when we start looking at things like
[22:31] that broken relationships broken
[22:34] fellowships broken people and stuff like
[22:36] that but the bottom says one of the
[22:38] sickest bodies that he's ever seen is
[22:40] the body of Christ
[22:42] you know we and we ought to be examples
[22:45] we ought to be the place where Sanctuary
[22:49] ought to be the place where people don't
[22:50] feel judged and look down upon but they
[22:53] know that when I come here I will find
[22:56] love I'll find Deliverance
[22:59] you know love heals
[23:02] you know says I'll rather have a church
[23:05] that is full of love than all the gifts
[23:09] that you can think of
[23:12] because Gibson callings are without
[23:14] repentance friends
[23:16] you don't have to repent for your gift
[23:18] to be expressed
[23:20] but you see when you love is something
[23:22] it does something to people it reaches
[23:25] people respond even dogs respond to love
[23:31] you know I tried it you know I went but
[23:34] yeah I see I see I see dogs and stuff
[23:36] like that I said let me extend my love
[23:38] to you let me see how it responds
[23:40] and all of a sudden I see it's jumping
[23:42] it's coming out after me I'm like wow
[23:45] yeah that's real
[23:47] that's real I'm a stranger
[23:49] you know I mean it's a nice dog I guess
[23:51] you know to start with but I'm a
[23:52] stranger
[23:54] and the other one the bigger one I
[23:56] looked at that I looked and said you say
[23:58] this is the the mother of them I'm like
[23:59] oh it has gone through life a lot and it
[24:02] took takes a little while to respond
[24:05] like it's studying me and say let me see
[24:07] what you're up to
[24:09] and then it's coming it's
[24:12] going I says Ah okay
[24:15] you see that's what happens with some of
[24:18] us we message Believers we've been for a
[24:21] while maybe then we start thinking too
[24:23] much right we just need to extend our
[24:25] love and then when we extend our love
[24:27] the rest God will take care of
[24:30] God is not out of methods to bless his
[24:34] people God is not out of ideas of how
[24:39] to free his people
[24:41] oh not at all
[24:44] to the contrary God is full of those
[24:47] ideas
[24:49] but brother Branham says God is uh
[24:52] waiting for that person
[24:55] that he can bless use remain humble
[24:59] that character that he can use that's
[25:02] where the challenge is
[25:05] do you recognize when John and James
[25:08] they pass through Samaria and these
[25:11] Samaritans they they didn't receive
[25:13] Jesus
[25:15] and you know what John and James is a
[25:17] master do you that we command Fire come
[25:20] down from heaven if they even quoted
[25:22] scriptures yes Elijah did
[25:24] you know even when you're in the wrong
[25:25] Spirit you always have a scripture to
[25:27] back yourself up
[25:28] but the only thing is that you are using
[25:30] it wrong
[25:32] oh yeah you know the prophecy you know
[25:35] if you don't like that Jezebel relax
[25:38] relax that's probably God's seed they
[25:41] are just not in their season yet if you
[25:44] just extend a little bit of love you
[25:46] will see all the makeup gone you'll see
[25:48] all the spaghetti tops gone you'll see
[25:50] all the nasty clothes gone and soon you
[25:53] just see a wonderful beautiful Christian
[25:56] friend that you never knew was there
[26:01] you see
[26:03] when my wife came I didn't even tell her
[26:05] I
[26:07] you know people take off your slacks she
[26:10] comes she wants to visit I'm visiting
[26:12] Christian friends well as long as it's
[26:14] not too tight and you know so so thing
[26:16] I'm like yeah okay fine
[26:19] because what am I doing sure no no
[26:22] oh it's God that changes people
[26:25] that's why she can then sing like that
[26:27] if it was me who told it to do that well
[26:30] it will still just be a show
[26:34] but when God has done it I don't have to
[26:36] say nothing
[26:37] you know that's how how is supposed to
[26:40] be and even the same thing with our
[26:42] children we teach them the right way and
[26:44] stuff like that well they come a point
[26:46] where they are older it's like well you
[26:49] have to make up your mind to serve the
[26:51] Lord because I'm your not your father
[26:53] but before God we are all children
[26:56] you know and you got to come to a point
[26:58] where you come face to face with your
[27:00] God
[27:01] you know it may be hard especially with
[27:04] children that grow up in Christian homes
[27:06] the father is a Christian the mother
[27:07] that's all they know so it looks like
[27:10] it's just regular it's normal they don't
[27:12] know the world out there they don't know
[27:15] how nasty how how messed up it is and
[27:17] stuff like that but the time comes when
[27:19] they of their own accord has to say
[27:22] well I need to surrender my own life to
[27:25] God but you can never do it by by
[27:29] compelling people by force but by
[27:31] reaching out
[27:34] praise God
[27:37] amen
[27:41] we're going to read scripture
[27:44] uh just so that um we tie everything to
[27:48] scripture that's what we always do
[27:51] because the words of men will fail
[27:54] but the written word of God will never
[27:56] fail
[27:58] so we always want to bring everything
[28:00] and Tide back to the scriptures
[28:03] and Jesus said here he was teaching them
[28:06] to pray
[28:09] because they'd asked the him and they
[28:11] said
[28:11] um
[28:14] he said Matthew 6
[28:16] verse 9 to 10.
[28:22] you see the after this men are therefore
[28:24] pray ye
[28:26] Our Father
[28:28] we chat in heaven
[28:31] hallowed
[28:33] be thy name that means thy name is Holy
[28:37] thy kingdom come
[28:41] thus verse 10. thy will be done in earth
[28:46] as it is in heaven
[28:49] so we'll stop there we're gonna draw a
[28:51] text from that thy kingdom come
[28:55] thy kingdom come
[28:59] it's interesting that God would actually
[29:01] say that
[29:03] and then the question that comes is like
[29:05] well God is still a king
[29:07] what are we saying Jesus is telling us
[29:10] to pray to God and say let thy kingdom
[29:13] come
[29:14] when there's a coming there's a living
[29:16] of one place and they're going on to
[29:19] another place
[29:20] so where is it coming from and where is
[29:22] it going
[29:25] and that's the question that that that
[29:27] that that that
[29:29] needs an answer
[29:32] and um
[29:34] let's go I'm gonna lay a background here
[29:38] with uh
[29:41] what uh brother Branham said
[29:48] I got uh three quotations here I'll see
[29:50] which ones I'll read
[29:52] the first one in question and answers
[29:54] preached in 59 12 12 23 I'm just putting
[29:59] that so that if we ever want to go back
[30:02] and reference
[30:04] it's easy to search
[30:06] you know we live in an age way
[30:09] it has become so easy
[30:11] to search scriptures to set your thought
[30:15] and that's good
[30:17] because I had one one Minister that
[30:20] years ago when he was young
[30:22] certain preachers that they were just
[30:24] not good people they they would quote a
[30:27] scripture
[30:29] quotation there's a brother but I'm
[30:31] saying and it's a lie
[30:33] he never said that
[30:35] but because back then you had to have
[30:37] the book
[30:39] you know so they would throw those
[30:41] things
[30:42] and you have no way really of knowing
[30:45] you because because just because someone
[30:46] doesn't have it on them doesn't mean
[30:48] it's not true but they will be throwing
[30:50] on their ideas but we are now living in
[30:53] an age where instantly this this can be
[30:55] checked
[30:57] so make it always a habit the Bible say
[31:00] make your calling and the election sure
[31:03] and um
[31:04] the bereans always searched you look for
[31:07] these things especially if something
[31:08] sounds a little bit different to the way
[31:10] you might have known it or think about
[31:12] it you take it I always encourage
[31:15] somebody and say when that happens take
[31:17] it to God you can go to God and say I'm
[31:20] your daughter God I'm your son
[31:23] I don't want anyone to to deceive me
[31:27] I I want to I want you to help me
[31:31] I'm hearing different things I'm sure
[31:33] that you've been around enough message
[31:35] circles to hear this one through that
[31:37] thought this one through that thought
[31:39] some good some not so good
[31:41] and uh even though we know that but the
[31:45] Branham was a prophet but because
[31:46] there's all these different ideas
[31:48] sometimes it leaves people wondering
[31:51] okay so we do we actually stand what is
[31:54] really true
[31:55] to me I see when you're in that spot
[31:58] you know don't start going live right
[32:01] and Center pick up the phone and ask
[32:03] that one and ask on and even maybe add
[32:05] more to your confusion
[32:07] what you do is that you go to God and
[32:09] say God I'm your son speak to me show me
[32:15] what's true and God will
[32:18] because the Bible says he that comes to
[32:20] him he will in Noah is Cast Away
[32:22] she will that's his nature it's not his
[32:25] nature as a matter of fact I don't know
[32:27] why people resent that that God speak to
[32:30] people I've dealt with people it's
[32:32] almost there is they're resentful when
[32:34] you say God spoke to me
[32:36] even to Cain what's the problem
[32:40] how can he not speak to his own children
[32:42] if he's gonna speak to yourself and see
[32:43] it God even spoke with the devil when
[32:46] they were speaking about job
[32:48] so when you come to God God actually
[32:51] every day for how many years spoke with
[32:53] Judas
[32:55] Jesus was God in flesh we know that so
[32:59] it's not a big thing it's not the matter
[33:01] is not whether God speaks to people the
[33:03] matter is do we hear when he speaks
[33:07] because the Bible says he that is an ear
[33:09] to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is
[33:11] saying to the church this is not
[33:13] physical hearing but let him understand
[33:16] that that's what we need so you can
[33:19] always go to God and verify these things
[33:21] for yourself
[33:23] Jesus said
[33:25] but the Barnum is uh is is is quoting he
[33:28] is a verily verily I say unto you in
[33:30] other words verily verily say amen amen
[33:33] absolutely absolutely truly truly
[33:37] I say unto you except a man be born
[33:40] again
[33:41] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[33:46] now brother banam says this now you
[33:49] couldn't see the kingdom of God
[33:51] because the kingdom of God is the Holy
[33:54] Spirit
[33:58] some standing here will not test of
[34:00] death till they see the kingdom coming
[34:02] in power he said
[34:04] the kingdom of God
[34:06] the Bible said is within you
[34:09] it is within you
[34:12] the Holy Spirit
[34:13] and you can't see that with your eyes
[34:16] see means to understand
[34:20] and Jesus comes around and teaches us
[34:22] and say when you pray now say thy
[34:24] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[34:27] not on Earth in Earth in Earth your
[34:31] Earth as it is in heaven
[34:34] pray for this
[34:36] pray for the kingdom of God to be
[34:39] established inside of you in this
[34:41] question in these questions and answers
[34:43] brother tells you that is the holy
[34:46] spirit we can go back to the scriptures
[34:48] understand that when brother bana makes
[34:51] reference to things the reason we we we
[34:54] we caught him for me is simple a prophet
[34:57] is a Divine interpreter of the word of
[34:59] God
[35:00] but whatsoever a prophet taught
[35:05] you can see it in the Bible if that
[35:08] Prophet is a prophet of God
[35:10] well if he's not that's a different
[35:12] story
[35:14] that's why sometimes that's why people
[35:16] go of tangents because they will go
[35:18] trying to quote brother Branham but they
[35:21] do it out of context because they can't
[35:23] lie in it with the scripture when you
[35:25] can't line it with the scripture well
[35:27] maybe you're understanding is off
[35:29] because a profit by definition is a
[35:33] Divine interpret of the word of God
[35:37] he's a word Prophet if he's not a word
[35:39] profit he can be a prophet
[35:42] the difference is that he's able not
[35:44] just to take the letter of the written
[35:47] bible
[35:48] but through the Holy Spirit calls the
[35:51] written bible to become a living article
[35:53] before people
[35:55] when the Bible says Jesus Christ Is A
[35:58] Healer a Vindicated prophet of God just
[36:00] doesn't tell you that Jesus Christ Is A
[36:03] Healer he actually demonstrates the
[36:06] healing power of God
[36:08] but that's just not for Prophets
[36:12] that's for all believers
[36:15] every believer because the Bible says
[36:17] these signs shall follow them that
[36:20] believe it doesn't say shall follow
[36:22] prophets only in my name they shall cast
[36:25] out devils
[36:26] it doesn't even say men alone sisters
[36:29] has the power to do so as long as you're
[36:31] not doing it for the wrong reasons you
[36:33] better know what you're doing though
[36:35] because if you are dealing with demon
[36:36] power you want to know what you're doing
[36:38] because one time demons say Paul I know
[36:40] Jesus I know who are you so you better
[36:43] know who you are you better know where
[36:45] you are standing
[36:47] you see so God has given this power
[36:50] accessible
[36:51] to human beings
[36:53] I want you to hear
[36:56] something here
[36:59] in First Corinthians 4 20
[37:04] I'm gonna line this up with something by
[37:06] the brand I'm saying so that you can
[37:08] understand that when he's making these
[37:10] Testaments where you get it from
[37:14] you know remember we are talking to
[37:15] young ones too so we may be going to
[37:18] things that everybody was older is
[37:20] familiar with
[37:21] but you know young ones are growing up
[37:22] and we got to teach them the ways of the
[37:24] Lord
[37:26] so so so don't let that out throw you
[37:28] off because we are speaking also to
[37:30] young ones right
[37:32] right it says for the kingdom of God
[37:37] is not in Word
[37:40] but in what
[37:42] power
[37:44] so the word of God the kingdom of God is
[37:47] not in Word
[37:49] this is where you get into another issue
[37:52] around the message because a lot of
[37:54] people preach word word word and that's
[37:57] true
[37:58] because the word is truth
[38:00] but if it's only word word with no power
[38:03] it's not the complete truth
[38:07] because the kingdom of God is not in
[38:09] word only
[38:10] it's in power
[38:13] trust me Satan don't care about you
[38:16] talking about the word
[38:18] actually he quoted it to Jesus
[38:21] you can talk all the word you want he
[38:24] can even correct you and say no no you
[38:25] quoted it wrong this is actually how it
[38:27] says it
[38:28] he came to Jesus he says oh throw
[38:30] yourself for it is written he shall give
[38:32] the Angels charge over thee and it was
[38:35] true
[38:37] Jesus never said you called they did
[38:39] wrong
[38:42] but Power
[38:44] that's what sit in Respect power
[38:48] you think I care for somebody who comes
[38:51] like you somebody comes and pretends and
[38:53] stand day or on the street and say hey
[38:55] stop stop I'm like who's that guy
[38:58] but if that person I see a police
[39:01] cruiser and they got their uniform and
[39:03] stuff like that I bet I respond now
[39:06] what am I looking at because I'm looking
[39:08] at the power of his position
[39:11] you know that could actually be a small
[39:15] framed young lady officer but by virtue
[39:19] of a position she got power
[39:22] wow she she has the power to raise her
[39:26] hand and stop me why she won't
[39:28] physically be able to stop the vehicle
[39:30] that I can knock it down but because I
[39:33] know that behind is the authority of the
[39:36] old PP or whosoever authority she's
[39:38] representing that's what people respect
[39:44] she so they Respect power
[39:47] that's behind so she's standing in
[39:50] authority and that Authority she knows
[39:52] that if something happens she has the
[39:54] power to Samoan people to stop you
[39:57] whether you like it or not
[39:59] so Satan Respect power
[40:02] that's why the gospel cannot be preached
[40:05] in word only the gospel is to be
[40:07] preaching power and in order to
[40:10] understand about this power well you got
[40:13] to know
[40:14] a powerful one
[40:17] and not only you know him he got to know
[40:20] you
[40:22] you know everybody knows here that our
[40:25] Trudeau is the prime minister of Canada
[40:27] he's a powerful man and uh in by virtue
[40:31] of his office
[40:33] this is not about whether you agree with
[40:35] his politics or not we are just talking
[40:36] about his office and stuff like that
[40:38] that office invests him with power
[40:41] to do things power to co-elections power
[40:44] to to print money and give it to people
[40:47] and all the different things that comes
[40:48] with that office
[40:54] and you find that in the message say we
[40:56] talk a lot about the election I was
[40:58] elected that was selected and we are
[41:00] going on about that predestinated and we
[41:04] are just going with the word the word
[41:06] the word the written word that is what
[41:08] I'm talking about
[41:10] but what I like about elections in the
[41:14] natural
[41:14] when elections have happened in the
[41:17] natural they put people in power
[41:21] if we are also elected and predestinated
[41:25] of God it must position Us in power
[41:29] and when we have power it means that
[41:32] your word is low
[41:35] this is what it means to govern
[41:37] that's why when they are giving a budget
[41:40] after they come to the power they call
[41:42] it the throne speech in other words we
[41:45] are speaking from a position of power
[41:48] power what we see here is become law
[41:51] our word
[41:53] has got the power to change things in
[41:56] this country that's what elections does
[41:59] I trust that I'm speaking to some
[42:01] elected people
[42:02] that have come to understand that
[42:07] thank you Jesus
[42:10] that our election hasn't helped us just
[42:13] to be elected people but it's put us in
[42:15] power
[42:16] I won't go too far with that but
[42:18] understand that true election puts in
[42:21] power
[42:25] and brother Barnum says in the Bible
[42:28] here says
[42:29] the kingdom of God is not in Word
[42:33] but in power to change things
[42:41] in the message of Oneness say listen
[42:45] closely
[42:47] now he's quoting it first Corinthians 4
[42:49] 20 says the kingdom of God is his word
[42:52] made Power
[42:54] the kingdom is in you
[42:57] and the when the word comes in there
[42:59] what does this word begin
[43:01] it turns itself into power
[43:08] making it just exactly what it said
[43:12] what is the kingdom of God we got to
[43:14] belong to the kingdom before we can ever
[43:16] be subject to the king
[43:19] well how do you get into the kingdom
[43:22] the kingdom of God is the word of God
[43:25] made back in power amen made Power
[43:28] taking away sins giving signs
[43:35] the Bible says you shall receive power
[43:38] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[43:40] you
[43:42] what was the Holy Ghost given for the
[43:44] banam went into that power speech power
[43:47] over sinful life power over all these
[43:50] different things
[43:52] the kind of gospel that brings people
[43:55] just to the written word the word the
[43:59] word written but never positions them in
[44:02] a power
[44:04] to see the signs of God to see their
[44:08] life turned to see all the things that
[44:10] are promised in the scripture that's not
[44:12] the gospel
[44:14] because the gospel is preached in power
[44:18] now we know it's more than that because
[44:20] we can have power for it to move
[44:22] mountains and we without charge it's
[44:24] it's coming up all the time
[44:27] it's coming up all the time
[44:29] what are we leading up to
[44:32] of course it's not to take your faith
[44:34] away from the written word if we do that
[44:37] then we are preaching false
[44:39] but we got to understand that we are
[44:43] walking steps towards God at every stage
[44:46] of our life
[44:48] the Natural Life comes forth in three
[44:50] stages As We Know water blood and life
[44:55] and over and over nature all things
[44:57] speaks of these threefold purpose of God
[45:01] to Usher you into life
[45:05] in the days of the Exodus in the book of
[45:08] Exodus the time of Moses we see God
[45:12] leading people out of Egypt leading
[45:16] people second through the Wilderness and
[45:18] then getting them into the promised land
[45:19] well it sounds easy to say but you know
[45:21] that that statement I said alone took
[45:23] them 40 years
[45:25] it's easy to say but it's a real battle
[45:30] so you find that many people come to
[45:33] realize yeah the word is truth there's a
[45:36] promise
[45:37] and exodus Prophet also came in our day
[45:40] you see come out from among them my
[45:43] people we came out whether it's the
[45:45] world whether it's denomination
[45:48] well we were Justified before God we
[45:50] heard the word of God we recognized
[45:52] we rejoiced over that
[45:55] but God requires more
[45:58] you know it's like badam give the
[46:00] illustration of picking you know a glass
[46:03] wherever it is whether it's in a
[46:05] barnyard
[46:06] and that vessel is thrown out there you
[46:09] don't pick it up and immediately put it
[46:12] on your table and start using it
[46:15] no you don't do that
[46:16] it goes through a process
[46:19] so there's nothing wrong God by his word
[46:22] he called us he says I love you we heard
[46:24] that howsoever that message came to us
[46:26] God picks us up from the ground we were
[46:31] dirty but Daddy picked her up we
[46:34] recognize that God loves me because I'm
[46:36] dirty he actually extends his Clean
[46:38] Hands to pick up something dirty
[46:41] and we felt that goodness as he lifted
[46:44] us up from whatever condition we were in
[46:47] and he says I'm calling you to the life
[46:49] I'm calling you to have a place at the
[46:52] table
[46:53] but
[46:54] a lot of times people stop there that's
[46:57] why sometimes people come and rejoice
[46:59] and come to the altar howsever they do
[47:02] Lord forgive me they actually feel the
[47:04] burden of sin lifted from them
[47:08] but you see if the gospel ends there
[47:11] by and by
[47:13] they tend back into the world again
[47:19] now don't discount them don't say it
[47:21] wasn't real
[47:23] that can even happen if they are in a
[47:25] denomination
[47:26] because we see denominational names
[47:28] Jesus see the heart
[47:31] so it doesn't matter where the person is
[47:33] as long as they come to Jesus and say
[47:36] forgive me
[47:37] he forgives them if they mean it
[47:42] but soon you realize that our problem is
[47:45] deeper than just our sins being forgiven
[47:49] our problem is our own very nature
[47:52] that's why David after doing so many
[47:55] exploits for God David killed the lie
[47:58] and David killed a bear David killed
[48:01] Goliath David slaughtered Philistines
[48:03] all these were Supernatural acts the
[48:06] power of God come down and anoint him
[48:09] and he inspired generations to fight and
[48:12] actually Israel never hit a king like
[48:13] David everyone was compared to David
[48:18] and yet the battle
[48:20] that overcame him but Matt was in the
[48:23] Battle of Goliath standing and boasting
[48:27] it wasn't the Goliath of a lion or a the
[48:30] giant of a lion coming forth and roaring
[48:32] after him it wasn't the grizzly bear
[48:35] whatever it was coming after him it
[48:38] wasn't that the many Philistines who
[48:41] were strong and were warriors for
[48:43] Generations gone those he defeated
[48:46] by trusting in his God
[48:48] his greatest battle
[48:51] was when he was by himself
[48:54] and he stood by the top of his house
[48:58] and he sees a woman
[49:04] friends don't say he didn't have the
[49:05] word he had
[49:09] David said Thy word if I eat my heart
[49:12] that I may not sin but you see that's
[49:16] when he wrote he says I was born in sin
[49:21] in iniquity did my mother conceive me
[49:24] well what was he talking about does it
[49:26] mean that his parents were not we were
[49:28] living out of wedlock that's not what it
[49:30] means he's saying I got this sin nature
[49:32] on me
[49:33] I need to be changed although I can
[49:37] Slaughter golap although I can I can
[49:40] conquer different things
[49:42] him before a naked body of a woman that
[49:45] was in a certain place I fell
[49:49] hard
[49:50] he feels so hard
[49:53] not only did he commit adultery he
[49:56] killed the man
[50:01] he shows you the need of another work of
[50:03] Grace
[50:07] cleansing
[50:11] you know that could never be fully
[50:13] accomplished in the way he wanted in the
[50:15] days of David because the sacrifice was
[50:17] not given
[50:18] Jesus Christ died on the cross to take
[50:21] away children the desire for sin
[50:24] no matter how your children are born
[50:27] with parents in the message the nature
[50:30] of sin is inside of you
[50:32] we teach you to do the right thing but
[50:34] that doesn't take away the nature of sin
[50:36] the nature of sin is the one that will
[50:38] make you calls you no matter how much
[50:41] you teach I never seen any right
[50:43] sensible even sin appearance who tell
[50:45] their children yeah go and do these
[50:47] wrong things this is how you do wrong
[50:48] things you don't have to teach them to
[50:50] life they start lying you don't have to
[50:51] teach them to deny things they've done
[50:53] they just start doing it on their own
[50:55] why because the nature of sin is inside
[50:58] of you
[50:59] so whether your parents are Christians
[51:01] filled with the Holy Ghost the nature of
[51:03] sin is still inside of you
[51:05] the natural birth could not impart to
[51:07] you the nature of life
[51:10] so when God picks you up the reason why
[51:13] people struggle it's not that they
[51:15] didn't give their heart to the sometimes
[51:17] sometimes it is but it's because they
[51:21] fail to recognize that after I give my
[51:23] heart to the Lord
[51:25] I got issues that needs to be uprooted
[51:28] from within me
[51:30] I got deep seated desires some of these
[51:33] desires it's not even anything you've
[51:36] done is passed on from generations to
[51:38] generation
[51:40] you see we're getting that from just
[51:41] look at the history of the line line of
[51:43] Judah
[51:45] David was in the line of Judah look what
[51:47] Judah these four parents did you they
[51:50] went and slept with Tamar thinking it's
[51:52] a hallowed so Judah was busy chasing a
[51:55] lot
[51:57] this is the spirit that was on his line
[52:02] and when he came face to face with it
[52:05] it's a company
[52:08] Moses look at you yeah everybody knows
[52:11] Moses would get upset quickly
[52:13] you know
[52:15] what that rock right and Beat It When
[52:18] God says speak to him say man oh good he
[52:21] was upset but just look at this line
[52:22] look at Levi Levi and the semen killed
[52:25] the whole city
[52:27] because they were upset with the people
[52:30] so these things are deep rooted
[52:31] sometimes
[52:33] it needs the blood of Jesus to break it
[52:37] I'm so surprised sometimes the people in
[52:39] the message they say we got the fullness
[52:42] of the word and they haven't even
[52:43] conquered themselves
[52:45] they have it here but it's not set in
[52:48] here
[52:49] because the word sanctifies you the word
[52:53] cleanses you you don't pick up that
[52:55] glass and start using it and start
[52:57] drinking God is not gonna do that you
[52:59] got to cleanse you
[53:01] well in the Old Testament there's an
[53:03] excuse so to speak
[53:04] because the fullness of time wasn't
[53:07] there
[53:08] even David Begins the one thing if I
[53:10] desired that will I seek after that I
[53:13] may dwell in the house of the Lord
[53:15] forever because for all his mighty
[53:17] battles
[53:19] after he has slaughtered all the
[53:21] Philistines he Comfort when he's on the
[53:23] top of the his houses he falls at the
[53:27] feet of a woman
[53:28] now he had the history to look to
[53:31] because it is time Samson had come and
[53:34] gone and Samson fell with the same thing
[53:39] no matter how strong he was
[53:42] God then needs
[53:45] a work of Grace
[53:48] to change us to sanctify us
[53:53] let us not be like the typical message
[53:56] people that don't want to hear Holiness
[53:58] message
[54:00] they think that if you jump
[54:02] justification
[54:03] if you jump sanctification
[54:06] if you jump the restoration of the gifts
[54:08] if you jump the baptism of the Holy
[54:10] Ghost and forget and ignore them all of
[54:13] a sudden you're in adoption
[54:17] so it's almost you know it reminds me
[54:20] you know what one brother used to say
[54:23] when I was young
[54:24] I used to think that you know he was a
[54:27] little boy then he said I used to think
[54:28] that if I close my eyes no one is seeing
[54:30] me
[54:31] you know
[54:32] if you close your eyes to something
[54:34] because you are seeing nobody all of a
[54:36] sudden around you all of a sudden oh
[54:38] nobody's seeing me yeah because I close
[54:40] my eyes so nobody sing
[54:42] so people think that if they close their
[54:45] eyes to justification
[54:47] no no that's shallow the sanctification
[54:50] that's shallow then God is not seeing
[54:52] them
[54:55] but my life
[54:57] the best interpretation of what I
[55:00] believe is not what I say it's what I
[55:01] live
[55:04] no matter all I may confess it with my
[55:06] mouth no matter how might say brother
[55:08] Branham was a prophet of God and it's
[55:10] true
[55:11] actually Jesus I mean the devil does
[55:14] better the Bible says he believed that
[55:16] Jesus is the son of God and he tramples
[55:18] he does better than a lot of us
[55:21] We believe We Don't tremble
[55:23] right so sanctification is the second
[55:27] work of Grace and don't look down upon
[55:30] it because it's a work of Grace Grace
[55:32] means and merited favor Jesus Christ
[55:35] died on the cross so that he can bring
[55:38] sanctification to the hearts of people
[55:40] cleansing
[55:42] take away lying take away cheating take
[55:45] away fornication take away perversion
[55:47] take away foolishness
[55:50] this is what sanctification does
[55:53] if we are still caught up with those
[55:56] Spirits pornography and so on we are not
[55:58] Sanctified we need to come to Jesus and
[56:01] say Lord cleanse me from unrighteousness
[56:07] even as men in relation time I'm a
[56:09] married man God is a certain way he
[56:12] wants it to enjoy family relation don't
[56:14] be influenced by by Hollywood and come
[56:17] up with this perverted you know ways to
[56:21] come together that's dirty
[56:24] God hates it
[56:25] God wants us to be clean
[56:28] Hallelujah because he says I am Holy
[56:32] the word Sanctified means set
[56:35] aside cleanse and set aside
[56:38] for service you're not demanding
[56:40] Services you are just cleaned and set
[56:42] aside the word church means the
[56:44] Sanctified ones
[56:45] the separated ones
[56:47] so the church is a place of cleaning
[56:50] it's like a big laundry place
[56:53] if we don't hear the gospel of our
[56:55] cleansing what's the problem
[57:00] and you know when the Holy Ghost is
[57:02] coming to your life he continues the
[57:03] work of sanctification inside of you he
[57:06] keeps you separated
[57:08] be holy for I am Holy
[57:11] and under the preaching of the Methodist
[57:15] says you know they had to douse them
[57:18] with with with water this is this is
[57:21] John Wesley they call them men of fire
[57:23] and that was sanctification that was the
[57:25] restoration of sanctification in the
[57:27] church they become so moved under the
[57:30] power of God that they to pour water
[57:32] inside of them and we God message people
[57:35] that are supposed to be way above those
[57:38] things way above Luther way above
[57:40] Westerly way above Azusa Street
[57:43] and plump into the fullness of the word
[57:47] and don't leave holy Christian
[57:50] Sanctified lives and when you see live a
[57:53] Sanctified life they say shallow it's
[57:56] not shallow how can it be shallow if you
[57:58] are not cleansed
[58:12] the children of Israel
[58:15] do you do you recognize that Pharaoh
[58:19] could not
[58:20] prevent the children of Israel from
[58:22] leaving Egypt no matter how much he
[58:24] tried
[58:28] what defeated the children of Israel
[58:30] wasn't pharaoh
[58:32] it's their own lust
[58:36] when they were in the wilderness they
[58:37] say oh we remember Egypt
[58:42] so memories of Egypt tormented them
[58:45] until they died in the wilderness
[58:49] my friends if it was like that with the
[58:51] first Exodus
[58:53] Hallelujah that's right my brother
[58:56] that's how it is as it was then so is it
[59:00] now we are in the 10 Exodus now we got
[59:03] also a prophet that preached come out
[59:05] and many have come down came out sorry
[59:07] and then now they are in the wilderness
[59:10] and many perish in the wilderness
[59:13] because the love of Egypt put them to
[59:16] the world
[59:17] they say let us organize the captain we
[59:19] remember the garlic we remember the
[59:22] things of Egypt
[59:23] because they when the desire of Egypt
[59:26] was never taken away from them
[59:29] what they should have seen say Lord take
[59:32] away the desire of Egypt from my heart
[59:36] because instead of looking back I need
[59:38] to look forward to the promised land
[59:40] because he that puts his hands on a plow
[59:43] to plow and look back well he's not
[59:45] going to have straight lines he's going
[59:47] to be all over the place he says you
[59:48] know that person is not fit for the
[59:50] kingdom that's what Jesus said
[59:53] so the children of Israel were plowing
[59:55] looking back looking back and they all
[59:58] perished in the wilderness and God said
[1:00:00] they'll never enter into my rest
[1:00:07] that's the time we are living in if we
[1:00:10] are entertaining so there's how many
[1:00:12] believe we have the very Exodus we are
[1:00:14] we are not a denomination of church but
[1:00:16] we are in the truth that Exodus because
[1:00:19] we have also a prophet like unto Moses
[1:00:21] that came in preached unto us and said
[1:00:23] come out from among them my people and
[1:00:26] be separate Hallelujah in touch not the
[1:00:28] unclean thing and I will receive you he
[1:00:30] preached that and many around the world
[1:00:32] in drugs they left all these nasty way
[1:00:36] of life in the world in the
[1:00:39] denominations and they say here we go we
[1:00:41] are going in the Exodus we are going in
[1:00:43] the journey and they started and they
[1:00:45] rejoiced at the Red Sea and they say we
[1:00:48] now know the truth of baptism they were
[1:00:50] baptized of
[1:00:52] baptism just like the children of Israel
[1:00:54] were baptized at the Red Sea so in the
[1:00:57] message the truth of baptism was
[1:01:00] restored and people rejoiced it that's
[1:01:03] the truth
[1:01:05] just like in the first Exodus with many
[1:01:07] of them God was not well pleased
[1:01:11] because they lasted after the things of
[1:01:13] the world
[1:01:15] they lasted after flesh they committed
[1:01:17] fornication they died in the wilderness
[1:01:20] they say give us flesh so the works of
[1:01:23] the flesh kill them and the Bible tells
[1:01:25] us what are the works of the flesh
[1:01:28] so the flesh must be conquered the flesh
[1:01:30] got to be conquered
[1:01:33] don't think I'm screaming at you but
[1:01:35] it's the spirit of God because why would
[1:01:37] you die when there is salvation in the
[1:01:39] house of God
[1:01:42] Deliverance is in the camp Jesus Christ
[1:01:45] is called the great emancipator he is
[1:01:47] the Redeemer of mankind Hallelujah the
[1:01:50] power to set people free
[1:01:54] Hallelujah
[1:01:55] and he that the son of man has set free
[1:01:58] is free indeed you can look back and say
[1:02:01] those Egyptians that used to conquer me
[1:02:03] I want to see them no more again I am
[1:02:06] free I am delivered Hallelujah so when
[1:02:09] some of us caught up in sin
[1:02:12] Hallelujah
[1:02:15] oh
[1:02:17] praise God
[1:02:19] and when that has happened you are so
[1:02:21] free
[1:02:22] Hallelujah you don't have to be worried
[1:02:25] oh I don't know what I'm gonna do if I'm
[1:02:27] just out of here I don't know if I'm
[1:02:30] just by my corner myself I may be found
[1:02:32] in the pornographic side and stuff like
[1:02:34] that you can walk in front because God
[1:02:37] has changed you
[1:02:39] Hallelujah
[1:02:42] so we preached the gospel of power to
[1:02:44] change
[1:02:46] Hallelujah change that we can believe in
[1:02:51] why do we sit there I'll tell you why I
[1:02:54] said there on sanctification in my
[1:02:57] experiences in my going around and
[1:02:59] looking at people and preaching in
[1:03:01] different settings I find that many
[1:03:03] people are not sanctified
[1:03:06] that's my experiences
[1:03:09] and when the spirit of God sometimes
[1:03:11] you're actually agitating to preach over
[1:03:13] there you're saying I want to preach
[1:03:16] this Dice Man it's nice to preach give
[1:03:18] me my Mountain it's nice to preach Sun
[1:03:20] stand still hallelujah it's the truth
[1:03:25] I ain't gonna go into my testimons God
[1:03:27] has given me testimonies where I spoke
[1:03:29] things
[1:03:31] and they happened
[1:03:33] that's not what I'm talking so it's not
[1:03:35] like there's none of that but you feel
[1:03:37] that no but that's a waste of time
[1:03:42] like Saul King Saul
[1:03:45] when he came to
[1:03:47] Samuel came
[1:03:48] he sees
[1:03:50] oh Blessed Be of the Lord have done all
[1:03:53] that you said
[1:03:56] and somehow looked and said how come I
[1:03:58] hear the ability of the Sheep
[1:04:00] how come I hear the mowing of the cows
[1:04:03] if you've done all that you need to do
[1:04:05] how come I'm hearing these things
[1:04:07] how come if we are supposed to be so
[1:04:10] energized to the word how come we are
[1:04:12] still smelling pornography you're still
[1:04:14] smelling nasty things in message
[1:04:16] churches how come
[1:04:21] why is the daughters of my people not
[1:04:24] healed the Bible says
[1:04:27] so we are not talking down to anybody
[1:04:30] never
[1:04:31] if we are like that then we cannot
[1:04:33] represent Christ correctly
[1:04:36] but sometimes he got to be said of that
[1:04:38] because the message in the last churches
[1:04:41] therefore and repent it's the Zeal to
[1:04:44] repent to repent is to turn away from
[1:04:47] wickedness it says Lord just as I am I
[1:04:50] come Set Me Free I Want to Be Free of
[1:04:53] this Hallelujah when you do it from your
[1:04:56] heart God will set him and set you free
[1:05:01] Hallelujah
[1:05:03] when you've done it from the heart and
[1:05:06] you will know and you go testify and say
[1:05:08] Jesus sets people free and people will
[1:05:11] be looking at you like what are you
[1:05:12] saying oh but it doesn't matter you know
[1:05:15] what you're saying
[1:05:16] so the kingdom of God
[1:05:18] is not in word only
[1:05:21] it's in power
[1:05:23] power to change lives
[1:05:26] which is written you shall receive power
[1:05:29] after the Holy Ghost you see we haven't
[1:05:31] even come to the Holy Ghost here we're
[1:05:33] just speaking of sanctification
[1:05:35] sanctification means the desire to sin
[1:05:39] has been rooted sorry uprooted the root
[1:05:42] is not there anymore you're looking like
[1:05:44] Noah and then
[1:05:46] you feel free
[1:05:48] You Feel clean
[1:05:50] you can raise hands and say thank you
[1:05:52] Lord
[1:05:54] then when you are like that
[1:05:56] Your Vessel for him to pour His holy
[1:05:59] spirit inside of us
[1:06:01] then Heine says like what
[1:06:04] it's clean water
[1:06:06] the problem if
[1:06:08] if this container was not clean the
[1:06:10] problem is not the water
[1:06:12] is the unclean container the water is
[1:06:15] okay
[1:06:16] but if the inside was dirty then I
[1:06:19] couldn't drink it but because it's clean
[1:06:21] I feel good I feel thirsty
[1:06:27] it quenches my thirst
[1:06:29] what I'm really after is the water
[1:06:32] but the container contains the water
[1:06:35] so then I can separate the water from
[1:06:38] the container because well the water has
[1:06:40] to be in a container
[1:06:42] the problem with people there handling
[1:06:44] the word of God with dirty hands
[1:06:47] their vessel that's dirty inside and
[1:06:50] they're trying to handle the word of God
[1:06:53] and they are trying to offer it to
[1:06:55] people to drink
[1:06:56] and well God looks at that and say no
[1:06:59] it's dirty
[1:07:01] he came over that you see but what's
[1:07:04] wrong with the word it's nothing wrong
[1:07:05] with the word it's the vessel that needs
[1:07:07] to be cleaned
[1:07:15] I can't seem to move from there
[1:07:27] let me go to a patrol coordinator
[1:07:30] because that's the way I've heard some
[1:07:32] confusion too
[1:07:34] Peter said to Jesus
[1:07:36] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:07:38] Living God and he said blessed are thou
[1:07:41] Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood
[1:07:44] is not revealed this to you
[1:07:46] Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build
[1:07:49] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[1:07:52] not Prevail against it and I will future
[1:07:55] tense I will give you the keys to the
[1:07:57] kingdom
[1:07:58] whatsoever you bind on Earth will be
[1:08:01] bound in heaven
[1:08:02] let us see what the prophet says about
[1:08:04] that because many remember when Peter
[1:08:08] was told that he proceeded
[1:08:11] to lie and deny Jesus
[1:08:15] Peter
[1:08:17] after confessing that Jesus was the
[1:08:19] Christ and God actually say you didn't
[1:08:22] get this Revelation from a man
[1:08:24] you proceeded to deny Jesus
[1:08:28] you proceeded to violently cut
[1:08:30] somebody's ear
[1:08:33] he just didn't denying Jesus he crushed
[1:08:36] whilst he was doing
[1:08:41] after going to mount Transfiguration and
[1:08:43] they transfigured Jesus Peter proceeded
[1:08:46] to deny him
[1:08:49] so if only you had the Matthew 17
[1:08:52] experience where you say thou are the
[1:08:55] Christ if that's all you have you're
[1:08:57] gonna deny Jesus
[1:09:00] you need more than that my friends
[1:09:03] you need more than that
[1:09:05] say what can you get more than
[1:09:07] Revelation you need an experience
[1:09:10] because the Revelation leads you to an
[1:09:13] experience there's nothing wrong with
[1:09:15] that
[1:09:16] now it doesn't mean your Revelation is
[1:09:18] off
[1:09:19] it was correct
[1:09:21] but when when that happens you know what
[1:09:23] P what Jesus is is Simon when thou art
[1:09:26] converted strengthen your brother
[1:09:28] only them can you strengthen them
[1:09:31] he says master I'm ready to go with you
[1:09:34] even today they say Peter you're ready
[1:09:36] to go today this is verily I tell you
[1:09:39] tonight this morning you're gonna deny
[1:09:41] me not one time not two times three
[1:09:44] times and three is a witness and they
[1:09:47] say I'll never deny you even to death
[1:09:50] you think Peter was lying he meant it
[1:09:52] from his heart
[1:09:53] but when The Showdown comes
[1:09:56] men in this message when the Swiss comes
[1:09:59] they will deny this very message
[1:10:01] why because you'd think you want
[1:10:04] to let The Showdown comes then you need
[1:10:06] power
[1:10:08] it's no more about brother but I'm
[1:10:10] saying it's about what you say have you
[1:10:13] met Christ
[1:10:15] but look at that Peter after Pentecost
[1:10:19] Hallelujah
[1:10:21] you shall receive power after the Holy
[1:10:24] Ghost
[1:10:24] and then you look as a silver and gold I
[1:10:27] have none but such as I have I give unto
[1:10:29] you Hallelujah
[1:10:31] now the very same Peter when they say is
[1:10:34] Peter stopped preaching he said must we
[1:10:36] listen to men or must we listen to God
[1:10:39] why something had taken a hold of Peter
[1:10:44] it wasn't just the Peter saying Thou Art
[1:10:46] the Christ it wasn't just that Peter
[1:10:48] coming down from Mount configuration
[1:10:50] this was a change Peter when thou art
[1:10:53] converted
[1:10:54] strengthen your brethren the problem we
[1:10:57] have in message Cycles is that people
[1:10:59] are trying to strengthen people without
[1:11:01] a conversion
[1:11:05] you can only give power if you have
[1:11:07] power
[1:11:09] power doesn't come from someone who's
[1:11:11] powerless
[1:11:13] God help us
[1:11:19] and when this Peter
[1:11:21] but the Branham say this let's anchor it
[1:11:23] let's bring to what the messenger says
[1:11:25] so that we understand we ain't saying
[1:11:27] this is just one this many
[1:11:30] it says Abraham's Covenant confirmed he
[1:11:33] says and now notice Peter with the keys
[1:11:37] what are those keys
[1:11:39] let's see
[1:11:40] we don't have to second guess I thank
[1:11:43] God for a prophet amen
[1:11:46] it wasn't the gospel of a Kentucky Irish
[1:11:50] man that converted me it was the Gospel
[1:11:53] of Jesus Christ
[1:11:55] Hallelujah
[1:11:56] because somebody didn't believe God and
[1:11:59] took Jesus to my people hallelujah I
[1:12:02] don't care how you look like Hallelujah
[1:12:04] he was the message of God hallelujah
[1:12:07] when I read that I heard Hallelujah the
[1:12:10] voice of my Mecca calling not the voice
[1:12:12] of William Branham but the voice of the
[1:12:15] Archangel of God hallelujah that's what
[1:12:18] we are converting by
[1:12:20] Hallelujah so when Psalm resent it
[1:12:24] because of the way you look to me it's
[1:12:27] not a Kentucky man to me it's not a an
[1:12:30] Irish man to me it's not an American
[1:12:32] it's the Gospel of Jesus
[1:12:35] Hallelujah
[1:12:39] doy and Irishman preached it
[1:12:43] so I heard that the voice of my
[1:12:45] theophany calling Hallelujah come up
[1:12:48] here
[1:12:49] Hallelujah I believed Hallelujah thank
[1:12:52] you Jesus because that Ministry was sent
[1:12:55] forth to change me Hallelujah in the
[1:12:58] last days
[1:13:00] in an age that is Luke on that is
[1:13:03] powerless
[1:13:04] you know what the Bible says about this
[1:13:06] age it says men in the last days he said
[1:13:10] they shall have a form of godliness but
[1:13:12] denying the power thereof so many in the
[1:13:15] message say cause they got a form of
[1:13:17] Godless brother Branham says cannot make
[1:13:20] peace with their brothers and sisters
[1:13:22] which Heaven are you going to
[1:13:24] Hallelujah the word of God transforms
[1:13:27] you that your enemies becomes your
[1:13:29] friends if it isn't done that you are
[1:13:32] just a religious person
[1:13:34] denying the power
[1:13:36] of Pentecost
[1:13:38] not a denomination because this
[1:13:40] Pentecost denomination so that's not
[1:13:42] what we are talking about
[1:13:47] to prove that now
[1:13:49] Peter with the Keys of the Kingdom
[1:13:53] how many believe God gave him the keys
[1:13:55] that brother Branham asked Jesus did
[1:13:58] sure I did
[1:14:01] and when did he use them
[1:14:04] because I've heard some say this kiss
[1:14:06] and have searched to see what the
[1:14:08] messenger says and I've listened to some
[1:14:10] message preaches I'm like but that's not
[1:14:12] what the messenger says where are you
[1:14:14] getting it from
[1:14:18] because somebody said oh it was the
[1:14:20] Revelation and that's what he said let's
[1:14:22] hear what the messenger says
[1:14:26] it says sure he did and when did he use
[1:14:29] them in Acts too
[1:14:31] to the Jews
[1:14:34] then went right down to the Samaritans
[1:14:38] although Philip had went down and
[1:14:40] baptized them in the name of Jesus
[1:14:42] Christ but they did not receive the Holy
[1:14:46] Ghost as yet
[1:14:48] because Peter had the key to the Holy
[1:14:51] Ghost
[1:14:52] so the key was open in the Holy Ghost to
[1:14:55] the three groups of people
[1:14:57] the Jew asked to the Samaritans
[1:15:01] when Philip yeah I'd say and then
[1:15:06] come down and lay these ends upon them
[1:15:08] and receive the Holy Ghost so that's
[1:15:10] Peter using the key
[1:15:11] and then guess what what's the Next
[1:15:13] Generation the next class they're
[1:15:15] Gentile he went up and opened the gospel
[1:15:18] to the Gentiles that's correct that
[1:15:20] that's Cornelius
[1:15:22] and from that there was no more need of
[1:15:24] Simon Peter's keys
[1:15:27] cause it's already open to all the world
[1:15:31] so we preached the gospel of the Kingdom
[1:15:35] that's what brother said
[1:15:38] this Spirit came in the church ages
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:47] the locusts did that
[1:15:49] until the whole bride tree stripped down
[1:15:52] there's no restoration of gifts
[1:15:55] there is nothing
[1:15:57] but God promised and say I will restore
[1:16:01] what the years the conquer woman the
[1:16:03] caterpillar and all the different
[1:16:04] insects they've eaten
[1:16:07] in his day and you shall preach they
[1:16:10] just shall live by faith repent and give
[1:16:12] your life to the Lord but don't stay
[1:16:15] there I want to sanctify you so he was
[1:16:18] restoring the truth to the church
[1:16:21] and we say Wesley preached
[1:16:23] sanctification no point of correction
[1:16:25] You Preach justification and
[1:16:26] sanctification he added he didn't take
[1:16:28] away what Luther had he had what was he
[1:16:32] doing he was going back to the fullness
[1:16:34] of Truth after that they went on after a
[1:16:37] while people see but there is more to
[1:16:38] God we want power and then afterwards
[1:16:41] Azusa Street came forth but they had and
[1:16:44] the messenger they didn't have a
[1:16:45] messenger said see more started that
[1:16:48] so he wasn't the messenger of the age so
[1:16:51] they thought they had the fullness of
[1:16:53] Medicals they didn't they had the
[1:16:55] restoration of the gifts
[1:16:57] so they preached justification
[1:16:58] sanctification and restoration of gifts
[1:17:03] and people say oh Pentecost is back in
[1:17:06] the church oh God you're going too fast
[1:17:08] I must need to have a wet restoration
[1:17:11] and the word restoration came by William
[1:17:14] Branham
[1:17:15] and when the word restoration had come
[1:17:18] the fullness of the baptism could come
[1:17:20] back in the church
[1:17:22] that's just as true as it is
[1:17:26] I hope you don't resent that
[1:17:29] Hallelujah and when that it come if the
[1:17:32] fullness of the word is come the
[1:17:34] fullness of the baptism is to come the
[1:17:37] fullness of the Holy Ghost is to come in
[1:17:39] the church
[1:17:40] Hallelujah
[1:17:41] back to the beginning where the church
[1:17:43] where the gifts of God fell
[1:17:45] Hallelujah when the Virgin Mary moved
[1:17:47] under the power of God
[1:17:49] Hallelujah when Paul's looked at does he
[1:17:52] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:17:53] you believe
[1:17:54] Hallelujah when William Branham come
[1:17:57] down and say when the doctor locked in
[1:18:00] my face and said Son have you received
[1:18:02] the Holy Ghost since you believe say it
[1:18:04] was something that I wanted it was
[1:18:06] something that I earned for
[1:18:08] Hallelujah because I never expect to get
[1:18:11] it among those people but God gave me a
[1:18:14] pill of great pies
[1:18:16] Hallelujah
[1:18:17] and then he started preaching that
[1:18:20] but that wasn't all
[1:18:22] so that we can now stand as placed sons
[1:18:25] of God
[1:18:26] you see how far we are running
[1:18:29] people even sanctified
[1:18:32] only then only then when the Holy Ghost
[1:18:35] come then you are tested when the Holy
[1:18:37] Ghost come you just say oh oh I got the
[1:18:40] Holy Ghost now I'm gonna speak squirrels
[1:18:42] into auxiliary you've got to be tested
[1:18:43] and proven
[1:18:46] you got to look at people that are loved
[1:18:49] ones and they don't like you like Joseph
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:18:52] only then when you have been proven and
[1:18:55] you can't even get along
[1:18:56] with your brothers and you're talking
[1:18:58] the power of the spoken word which one
[1:19:02] friends if I don't say these things
[1:19:05] I'm useless to you
[1:19:07] because I'll be just saying things to
[1:19:09] make somebody happy
[1:19:11] as much as I'm talking to you I'm
[1:19:13] talking to myself
[1:19:15] each one of us is not exempt from the
[1:19:18] word of God
