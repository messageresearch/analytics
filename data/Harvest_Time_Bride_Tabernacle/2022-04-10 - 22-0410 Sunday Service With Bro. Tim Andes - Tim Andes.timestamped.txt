[28:53] of know who's preaching
[28:55] pretty pure
[28:59] that i'm glad your pastor isn't all
[29:01] about ties because i'm not a thai guy
[29:04] i don't believe brother brown was a thai
[29:06] guy i believe there was a service

[31:40] won't mind the picture on the right that
[31:42] a pastor can actually work and have fun
[31:46] so here uh he's wearing actually one of
[31:49] my cousins
[31:50] sweaters their company and then that's
[31:52] my company with my truck in the
[31:54] background we were doing some cleanup
[31:55] work
[31:57] trying to be a blessing for the pastor
[31:59] he just happens to be my dad
[32:01] so he just started being a pastor but
[32:03] he's had a gift on his life his whole
[32:05] life to be a pastor he was a pastor for
[32:07] three years at 21 years old so when i
[32:09] was younger than me 21 to 24 he went to
[32:12] patton's and helped for three
[32:15] moved back to the biscuits for 20 years
[32:18] he is associate minister there and was a
[32:21] youth leader youth pastor you would say
[32:23] took care of the young people and in the
[32:26] u.s we have a u.s believers and canadian
[32:28] believers right so then when the border
[32:31] shut down my dad would have to stay on
[32:33] this side and would preach for the
[32:34] believers about once every week or two
[32:37] and then he felt led to be an evangelist
[32:39] for six months felt to start uh
[32:41] journeying a little bit around and then
[32:43] he started this work god started the
[32:44] work in november and we have seen
[32:46] nothing but god since it started people
[32:49] that have dui's people that have smoked
[32:51] drinked and had alcohol have come to our
[32:53] church
[32:54] confirmed
[33:02] my burden has not come easy but on his
[33:05] 50th birthday today happy birthday dad
[33:08] we want to say happy birthday i know
[33:10] he's streaming right now he told me he
[33:11] would be so
[33:12] i'm just thankful for his life amen next
[33:14] slide
[33:16] um
[33:17] the next slide is my wife i mean my my
[33:19] mom
[33:20] sister sharon andes and um if you don't
[33:24] have a good mom
[33:27] you won't get far in life so i'm
[33:30] thankful for my mom um she came from
[33:32] australia she was uh she came here um
[33:36] she came to bc actually and because of
[33:38] the commonwealth um she she was able to
[33:42] uh to do like a nursing taking care of
[33:44] older people and she came to bible way
[33:47] and um my dad was preaching the biscuit
[33:49] allowed him to start preaching and spoke
[33:51] a servant came back from africa
[33:54] and she had a revelation that that was
[33:56] her husband in the service so i was
[33:58] telling him about the deal what if
[33:59] brother biscuit hadn't allowed a young
[34:01] teenager boy to speak in that service
[34:04] she would have never known who john
[34:05] andes was
[34:07] so thank god for a minister like brother
[34:09] bis
[34:11] amen and then on the right here sister
[34:13] star caldwell who actually lives with us
[34:15] so she wrote she is the mother of uh
[34:18] sister jessica and she lives with us and
[34:20] we're trying to be a blessing for her
[34:21] and she's a blessing to us
[34:23] next slide
[34:24] i just have a few slides
[34:26] so then there's my brother here on the
[34:28] left is my brother owner of augusta lawn
[34:30] care services also used to speak young
[34:32] people
[34:34] stop
[34:35] now but i believe god has a gift on his
[34:37] life that he can speak and have an
[34:39] influence and impact in the business
[34:40] community right so by your life people
[34:43] can know something's different about
[34:44] michael andes and therefore they will
[34:46] want what he has they'll say something's
[34:48] different in tim and he's in my business
[34:50] therefore they'll want what i have
[34:53] and what makes us different is what
[34:55] we're going to talk about
[34:57] on the right there is all five of us my
[34:59] dad mom
[35:00] and brother and sister victoria there in
[35:02] the middle
[35:04] i don't mean to say this rudely but she
[35:06] married a canadian
[35:09] so right now they're revelation
[35:11] in canada but brother dale telling me
[35:13] there's a mighty exodus out of canada
[35:16] so i'm praying maybe they'll cross the
[35:19] border and come live with me work with
[35:21] me
[35:22] the john walnut
[35:25] he maybe will stream this down the road
[35:26] but
[35:29] i will say this uh
[35:31] just because it's hard financially in
[35:32] canada and even in washington state it's
[35:35] one of the most expensive places to live
[35:38] god is your provider
[35:40] god provides for all your needs and if
[35:42] you are where god wants you you will be
[35:45] happy you might not be financially
[35:47] blessed but you will be eternally
[35:49] blessed when you make a choice for jesus
[35:52] christ it might be the harder way it
[35:54] might not be where your family thinks
[35:56] you should go it might not make sense
[35:58] financially as i talked with a very good
[36:00] family member to this last week and they
[36:02] were telling me they're upset about the
[36:04] church situations going on in our in our
[36:06] area and i'm up about it too not upset
[36:09] about the people
[36:10] against the devil
[36:12] the devil that is trump splits in
[36:14] churches the devil is the one that tries
[36:16] to cause disfellowship so i'm saying god
[36:19] you sent a message which we're going to
[36:20] talk about today
[36:22] bill
[36:24] will he do that brother and sister
[36:27] at the end time
[36:29] judge doing what they're doing
[36:30] fulfilling prophecy of william branham
[36:36] and then
[36:38] my brother
[36:39] and then myself i need to lose a little
[36:40] bit of weight
[36:42] um
[36:43] anyone noticed something
[36:45] me and my dad look very similar right
[36:48] i'm thankful for that i want to say if
[36:50] we're supposed to be like our heavenly
[36:51] father
[36:53] i'm glad i'm thankful out of all three
[36:55] of the kids
[37:01] make him proud just like i want him
[37:04] my testimony would line up with his life
[37:06] and test
[37:07] my life my
[37:09] this he told me this from a little boy
[37:11] he said tim do more than i did do
[37:14] greater things
[37:15] go higher go deeper
[37:18] that's what the young generation needs
[37:20] to do if your dad isn't serving god you
[37:22] serve god
[37:24] if your brother don't go if my brother
[37:26] tomorrow and his millions of dollars
[37:28] business tomorrow says this isn't true
[37:31] i'm not going to that
[37:34] because i'm not i've already seen
[37:36] okay
[37:37] doesn't matter family if my victoria
[37:40] right there you see her in that picture
[37:41] right there if tomorrow
[37:43] wear pants and i'm going to leave my
[37:45] husband i'm not going to follow that
[37:48] okay
[37:51] so i just want to give this a testimony
[37:53] as well on the left is my grandpa who's
[37:55] still alive holding little boaz brother
[37:57] ken andes and sister joyce there on the
[38:00] right this is our family heritage and
[38:02] it's of god and i'm thankful for it not
[38:04] everyone can say that but these
[38:07] individuals you're looking at every
[38:08] english message you read
[38:12] and they edited
[38:14] period every
[38:15] those two people
[38:20] any money to their name they rent from
[38:22] me right now
[38:24] i'm trying to bless them by giving them
[38:26] a lower
[38:28] so that they can have a
[38:30] final years of their life because i
[38:32] firmly believe those people
[38:35] that have gone before us our pastors
[38:37] that have gone before us they don't need
[38:39] to stay behind the pulpit till they're
[38:40] 85.
[38:42] firmly believe they can
[38:45] and they can let someone else the torch
[38:47] it doesn't have to be a
[38:50] their brother or something that becomes
[38:51] master of the church but you've got to
[38:53] make sure you take care of those that
[38:56] ran this race well
[38:58] and we don't need them having heart
[38:59] attacks and dying prematurely because
[39:02] too much pressure is in their lives so
[39:04] my grandpa and grandma by the grace of
[39:05] god have served the lord for 50 years
[39:08] of god i'll say this publicly lord
[39:10] willing and
[39:12] radio broadcast in washington state and
[39:15] on my podcast about both of their
[39:18] millions of people in a few weeks are
[39:20] going to know the truth that what the
[39:22] message produces works
[39:25] they stay together they love each other
[39:27] they they they're not divorced they're
[39:28] not split they know what they believe
[39:31] man
[39:32] so this is just a testimony of my life
[39:34] to defeat all the critics right at the
[39:36] beginning that the message is true
[39:40] next
[39:40] slide
[39:42] so a little bit about myself sorry this
[39:44] is taking too much time i'm going to be
[39:45] very quick on this but brother tim has a
[39:48] vision and a desire to spread the go
[39:50] will anyone else have a desire
[39:52] okay that
[39:57] but if it's not your desire to tell
[39:59] others about jesus you are not a bride
[40:01] member
[40:03] because the bride tells others what they
[40:05] believe
[40:06] if you really love something you tell
[40:08] someone about it is that true
[40:10] i really love
[40:17] if you believe that god is rich in mercy
[40:19] you will tell others to read this
[40:20] message book if you believe lean not to
[40:23] your own understanding
[40:25] let's keep going we don't need to birth
[40:27] pains if you believe that birth pains is
[40:29] what we need for a body change
[40:32] this is what you will tell people
[40:35] i'm not a salesman i'm not a salesman
[40:38] i'm a living man that believes in jesus
[40:40] christ
[40:42] so in our nonprofit organization which
[40:45] just started this month pnw missions
[40:48] connected with and prayer support by our
[40:51] local church end time message tabernacle
[40:53] in ferndale washington we have started a
[40:56] desire
[40:57] and i tell this to everyone not for them
[40:59] to give to me not for them to um
[41:03] not to follow what i'm doing but to get
[41:08] to be a pastor's vision so my pastor is
[41:10] now brother john andes his vision is the
[41:13] same we must believe local missions is
[41:16] important
[41:18] local
[41:19] if our churches are getting smaller in
[41:21] north america and we're spending
[41:22] thousands of dollars in africa we are
[41:25] wrong
[41:26] if there are no people coming to our
[41:28] church that have uh cut hair and are
[41:31] wearing pants and not coming to our
[41:32] church because we're not telling him and
[41:34] testifying about what god's done for us
[41:36] and the saving power of god then we are
[41:39] not having a local impact
[41:42] so therefore ministries around the world
[41:44] that will listen to this service you
[41:46] must have local missions
[41:50] and if you're here today and you can't
[41:52] pay your food bill tomorrow you can't
[41:54] pay your electric bill go to your pastor
[41:58] every person that listens he can help
[42:00] you
[42:01] he might not give you three thousand
[42:03] dollars or ten thousand dollars to get
[42:04] out of debt but he can tell you in five
[42:06] minutes i know i can with any individual
[42:08] that would take the time to take me out
[42:10] for coffee in five ten minutes i'd say
[42:12] here brother here's the word way this is
[42:14] what you need to do in your life make
[42:16] some changes so you don't land to
[42:18] divorce
[42:19] so don't land in separation and
[42:21] fellowship five minutes
[42:23] brother branham says two minutes you can
[42:25] discern if a person is the holy ghost in
[42:28] less than one minute brother dale has
[42:30] the holy ghost he can discern if he's
[42:32] gonna be able to help you or not help
[42:33] you
[42:34] we're gonna talk about that this morning
[42:36] this is this is my defense somebody
[42:39] we're gonna talk about this
[42:41] and this
[42:43] everyone know what that is
[42:45] we're going to talk about that
[42:48] is everyone on the edge of their seats
[42:49] now
[42:52] pnwmissions.com
[42:54] you can go to the next slide that's
[42:55] where you can go if you would like to
[42:57] know more but if you're having anything
[42:58] you'd like to pray for on your prayer
[43:00] list who has a prayer list
[43:03] if you don't have a prayer list start
[43:04] today
[43:05] kids at the top family first anyone that
[43:08] needs god put a prayer list down
[43:12] i don't have a brother deal but i can
[43:13] send some to you brother
[43:15] um
[43:17] we
[43:18] printed hundreds of these
[43:21] it has no church name it's a check
[43:24] and it says whosoever believeth in me
[43:26] that's who it's paid order to so who
[43:28] believes in jesus christ
[43:30] this is i know this seems temporal in
[43:32] elementary and grade twos can do this
[43:34] because i did it at bca when i did it i
[43:36] had them fill out a check grade twos
[43:38] because they can write and i told him to
[43:40] put right here it says the desire of
[43:42] your heart
[43:43] what's your desire
[43:45] the problem is people don't ask so they
[43:47] won't receive that's bible
[43:50] all right man so in p p w missions it's
[43:53] local pacific northwest is what that
[43:55] means pnw
[43:57] currently we have a prayer request i
[44:00] have a prayer request and great desire
[44:01] for this to happen immediately that
[44:03] somebody that would desire for their
[44:06] ministry not to be behind a pulpit but
[44:08] to be able to work with me in audio and
[44:10] video expertise that lives in washington
[44:13] state so can you pray for me for that
[44:16] we're going to uganda and malawi next
[44:18] month lord willing to assess spiritual
[44:20] needs and to bring truth to the country
[44:23] the truth is jesus christ will set them
[44:25] free jesus christ is their provider they
[44:28] don't need americans to send them money
[44:31] i don't need to set i don't need to give
[44:32] them one dollar nope
[44:35] i can tell them how to spend their money
[44:36] in their country and they will do well
[44:40] amen
[44:41] now can you send 500 to a brother leo in
[44:44] uganda yes you should your duty bound
[44:48] when you have been given much much is
[44:50] required
[44:52] and you have ten thousand thirty
[44:54] thousand
[44:57] you are losing money
[44:59] and you feel secure well i wouldn't be
[45:02] right now i'd be saying jesus help me
[45:05] i'm being serious
[45:06] i want my bank account as close to zero
[45:08] every month as possible
[45:12] why
[45:13] because i have zero dollars in the bank
[45:14] i'm on my knees depending on god i'll
[45:17] tell you right now this past week my
[45:19] personal checking account has bounced
[45:24] does anyone know that did anyone think
[45:25] that brother tim has no money in his
[45:27] personal bank account when i'm preaching
[45:29] no that's what happened
[45:31] by the grace of god i have a nice bank
[45:33] and they give you three thousand dollar
[45:35] where if you go negative they pay it
[45:37] back praise the lord
[45:41] now the other part i'm not going to tell
[45:42] you is there's twenty thousand dollars
[45:44] owed to me this week that will be coming
[45:46] in by tuesday
[45:50] bank of heaven now requires faith what
[45:53] this check is a bank in heaven and it
[45:54] will never run dry cash the check
[45:58] and see what we'll do i'm holding my
[46:00] wife's here my wife puts on here so the
[46:03] salvation of her brother isaiah in jesus
[46:05] name and if he listens to this service
[46:07] your sister's praying for you hurt my
[46:09] wife down
[46:12] since
[46:17] oh here it is
[46:19] full restoration of god serving our
[46:21] children our sons and our daughters and
[46:24] my husband that's my wife
[46:30] every single one of those are coming to
[46:32] pass they either have or they're in the
[46:34] process of becoming
[46:36] god's work man
[46:38] and our desire in pnw missions then is
[46:41] for local churches to be encouraged
[46:56] name of jesus is the greatest name
[46:59] and every one of these message books
[47:01] points you to jesus
[47:03] and you will notice there's no picture
[47:05] of brother branham on the front he's on
[47:07] a little tiny picture on the back with a
[47:09] little quote
[47:10] because what is inside of what you read
[47:13] and what you listen and what you feed on
[47:15] is what you show and become
[47:18] so pnw mission just a little lighthouse
[47:21] we don't
[47:23] i'm being honest we just start
[47:25] okay
[47:27] vision will prosper
[47:29] the vision will go forward when a person
[47:31] is like george mueller where they depend
[47:34] on god
[47:35] who
[47:36] george muller
[47:38] one person two people
[47:41] man brother dale you might want to do a
[47:42] little research on george muller and
[47:43] preach a service about him it's
[47:45] impactful okay
[47:48] i'll just leave it at that the pastor
[47:50] can do that if he
[47:51] george muller just to be really quick
[47:52] because my sister right there is like
[47:54] tell me more
[47:56] george mueller
[47:58] two orphanages
[48:00] over two thousand children came through
[48:02] that orange what is an orphan doesn't
[48:05] have a mom and dad
[48:06] most of the time that child has not had
[48:08] that but all of the time that chuck
[48:10] didn't
[48:22] william branham
[48:24] but what he knew and what he believed i
[48:26] don't know who what i don't know what
[48:28] doctrinally he believed but his life
[48:30] preaches a message
[48:32] it either makes people desire more of
[48:34] god and when i read his bibliography it
[48:36] made me have more faith
[48:39] right
[48:40] this book right here i haven't even
[48:41] started reading it's about a local
[48:43] pastor that giving all glory to god
[48:46] i told the man i will read it as long as
[48:49] it's not pointing me to your church as
[48:51] long as it's not pointing me to what you
[48:53] believe and it's just a tech cause
[48:54] that's what he said it says on the man
[48:56] was healed of cancer praise god
[48:59] oh no he's a denominational pastor
[49:05] your attitude is wrong your spirit is
[49:06] wrong and
[49:08] perhaps you're ready to go
[49:13] brother ron malevo in philippines and
[49:14] i'm only saying this because your pastor
[49:16] knows him right
[49:18] he wrote a book here the message of the
[49:20] hour reference guide
[49:22] let's all get this book have your pastor
[49:24] order them i got three copies for 15
[49:28] each or something why you can spend 50
[49:31] out to go out to eat this afternoon
[49:36] don't have these in your home if you
[49:37] like to read paper these only cost like
[49:40] what well they don't even make them
[49:41] anymore do they oh they do i don't know
[49:44] they don't i don't know if they do
[49:46] try and see if you can get paper copies
[49:48] in your home
[49:50] because a child doesn't need to be
[49:52] reading on an ipad the message they need
[49:54] to be reading it in book form that is
[49:57] totally backwards i know it seems old
[49:59] school but think about it for one minute
[50:02] if our children all the reading they do
[50:04] in school right now is done on an ipad
[50:05] they will be deadbeats
[50:08] so they need to read it
[50:11] and if they can't read mommy and daddy
[50:13] need to read it
[50:15] i gave one of brother felix right i gave
[50:17] you that book of brother branham the new
[50:18] version the first book right
[50:22] i would read that any day before disney
[50:24] to my kids
[50:27] and that's not legalistic
[50:29] i would read a little simple picture
[50:31] book about george muller find it
[50:34] read about john wesley find it martin
[50:36] luther find it
[50:38] those are good things so pnw's mission
[50:41] is to encourage us to all
[50:44] get ready to go home
[50:46] uganda and malawi there are bride
[50:47] members there
[50:50] next slide
[50:52] i think the next slide is our little
[50:53] example for witnessing so this is again
[50:55] another example for the devil
[50:57] and for us here
[50:59] that there are people that sir still
[51:00] believe
[51:02] in witnessing
[51:03] if you don't believe in witnessing you
[51:05] are not ready to go in a rapture a
[51:08] witness is someone that has been there
[51:09] done that brother right
[51:11] they believe it's true and now they're
[51:13] going to tell someone else that's a
[51:14] witness brother eddie biskell was a
[51:15] witness and there with the prophet
[51:18] he has made 11 or 12 videos you can go
[51:21] see him on youtube wonderful
[51:23] pointing us to jesus christ
[51:25] through a ministry that he was with
[51:28] wonderful now that man is dead william
[51:31] branham brother biscuit is older that's
[51:33] why they made the videos because he if
[51:35] the lord carries will pass away
[51:38] he will perry green passed away
[51:40] and we
[51:41] happening in tucson we need to pray for
[51:44] those believers they still don't have a
[51:45] pastor
[51:47] okay they need a pastor you have to have
[51:50] a pastor
[51:53] but witnessing is a local vision that a
[51:56] pastor has to have if he doesn't have
[51:57] that
[51:58] if he doesn't even want to he can say
[52:00] all day i have a vision for something
[52:01] but if he doesn't do it himself
[52:04] that's not a pastor
[52:06] that's called a i can do that in my
[52:07] business too i can say brother or math
[52:09] not brother uh
[52:11] chris you go do this right you go do
[52:14] this it's called delegation okay but you
[52:16] need to go with the person and show them
[52:18] that it's your vision this is the way we
[52:20] work
[52:21] this is the way we ho i'm talking your
[52:23] language now this is the way we're going
[52:24] to farm okay if brother jared took one
[52:27] month and trained up a man for one month
[52:30] that was willing to be teachable he
[52:31] could literally not have to work another
[52:32] day in his life
[52:34] if he found the right man that was
[52:36] teachable that worked for next to
[52:38] nothing and in one month i guarantee
[52:39] that you're gonna have a great job
[52:41] i just gave you a plan of how to get out
[52:43] of business and something for god
[52:46] if that's what god's called you to
[52:50] so witnessing is important um this is
[52:52] brother daniel in the middle kihanga who
[52:54] just had a baby as well that's about 15
[52:56] minutes from us a wonderful african we
[52:58] love the africans i love to see more
[53:00] africans in this church
[53:02] amen they bring a certain spirit and
[53:04] element to the service is necessary in
[53:06] north america
[53:08] if they're here
[53:10] now if you're in uganda
[53:15] the country and coming here because of
[53:17] money can't do it
[53:20] but
[53:29] because they came because a vision of a
[53:31] minister was to have something
[53:34] and he's the greatest pastor in the
[53:36] message and get their children are
[53:37] marrying adulterer
[53:40] they're deacons
[53:42] and their children are
[53:46] they thought they were making a
[53:47] spiritual choice but it wasn't it was
[53:49] financial
[53:51] financial decisions in your life will
[53:53] lead
[53:54] every day
[53:56] does everyone understand that when you
[53:58] make a decision to move somewhere based
[54:00] on finances or friends or family you
[54:04] have made a mistake
[54:07] the only reason you ever move your
[54:09] family to go somewhere else is because
[54:11] they have a good local spiritual head of
[54:14] church a good pastor
[54:16] because your family needs a good pastor
[54:18] if we're going to go in a rapture
[54:20] and our pastor is not william branham or
[54:23] joseph branham if joseph branham is your
[54:25] pastor and you claim that on the
[54:27] internet you need to be able to have his
[54:29] phone number or email
[54:34] because a pastor should be active
[54:36] a pastor should be someone some skin on
[54:40] you can go talk to your pastor about
[54:42] anything and everything this is what the
[54:43] prophet got
[54:45] but see we got we got message ministers
[54:47] great ministers in the message and
[54:48] they're unaccessible
[54:54] people want what you want you'll
[54:58] never grow bigger because you have a
[55:00] vision and that is i'm going to stay
[55:02] with quiet not amongst the people every
[55:04] time i've seen that in a ministry
[55:06] there's been major splits there's been
[55:08] major splits and you know what it is
[55:10] because the pastor did not take time
[55:13] with the sheep
[55:15] help us lord brother to never be a
[55:17] pastor
[55:18] and pastors that will listen to this sir
[55:20] help us what if we've been doing that to
[55:23] change
[55:25] because sheep need smell
[55:27] they need to smell their shepherd they
[55:29] need to be able to text their shepherd
[55:30] i'm going to say it again they should be
[55:32] able to call an email and get a reply
[55:36] not three days later not five days later
[55:39] you're and you say you're busy
[55:42] what if you just told that sheep when
[55:43] you didn't reply
[55:48] it happens every day
[55:50] oh i was busy i was off i never received
[55:53] that email
[55:55] really
[55:57] really
[55:58] but you're sitting on your couch for
[56:00] three hours on your phone and your email
[56:02] is connected to your phone or should be
[56:05] and you never received an email you
[56:06] reply two weeks later
[56:10] i would delete your business emails
[56:13] and make the email whatever it is for
[56:16] your church
[56:19] and make that your main desire because a
[56:20] pastor's one job is to feed the sheep
[56:22] brother dale
[56:23] and if he has a small congregation then
[56:26] he might have to work right
[56:28] that's not bad
[56:30] but make sure brother joshua goff who i
[56:32] was just in texas did anyone know him
[56:34] maybe maybe you've heard of him okay
[56:35] maybe you haven't but um
[56:38] he um
[56:56] foreign
[57:04] possible to have a church
[57:06] people in the message and everyone is in
[57:08] one
[57:09] yes
[57:13] you just have to have team
[57:15] body people around you
[57:17] you have to have people like five sick
[57:20] sinisters that can come together
[57:23] or here's another suggestion i am sorry
[57:25] this is totally not no it's but maybe
[57:26] it'll help somebody
[57:29] that witnessing goat is great it's local
[57:31] but then a church grows why not instead
[57:34] of seven ministers in one church we
[57:36] create seven lighthouses in the local
[57:38] area that is what the message would
[57:40] produce
[57:42] but we've denominated the message
[57:48] we got a paycheck coming in because we
[57:49] got a pastor that's been in the message
[57:51] for 50 years he's got a great reputation
[57:53] and you're lying on that reputation
[57:56] i don't lie on anyone's reputation but
[57:58] jesus christ jesus christ has done
[58:00] something for brother tim i don't need
[58:01] no man
[58:02] i just need jesus money
[58:04] i'll get it from anywhere i need to i
[58:06] don't need bride member giving me money
[58:07] no sir because i know right now there
[58:09] are people that will stream the search
[58:11] that have never heard the name liam
[58:12] branham but that's good
[58:16] hallelujah witness more next slide

[1:07:04] luke chapter 1 verse 37 says
[1:07:07] for with god
[1:07:09] nothing shall be impossible
[1:07:12] can we say nothing
[1:07:15] how many have ever doubted god
[1:07:19] question god
[1:07:20] raise your hand again just be honest in
[1:07:23] heart
[1:07:23] who's ever doubted the message maybe or
[1:07:25] i had a family member made them try to
[1:07:27] question the message let's be honest
[1:07:30] don't be a holier than thou and say i've
[1:07:31] never questioned anything brother bram
[1:07:33] spoke
[1:07:34] come on that's a lying hypocrite
[1:07:38] okay you read whether you were when you
[1:07:40] were young and you were like what do you
[1:07:41] mean by that every single person will
[1:07:43] have this when they first start out
[1:07:45] everyone
[1:07:46] there is nothing you read in the bible
[1:07:49] you read it and you're like what does
[1:07:50] revelations mean
[1:07:52] right
[1:07:53] but with god nothing shall be impossible
[1:07:56] luke chapter 4 verse 18
[1:07:59] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:08:01] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:08:04] the gospel to the
[1:08:06] poor
[1:08:07] how many are poor
[1:08:09] might have been poor in spirit you might
[1:08:11] be poor financially god can meet your

[1:08:46] brother matthew right what is it worth
[1:08:48] brother matthew with all this money and
[1:08:52] what is it worth
[1:08:53] let me just dissolve insurance if you're

[1:09:19] dollars

[1:09:27] little life insurance it's 10 bucks and
[1:09:30] my wife gets a little bit of money if i
[1:09:31] die praise the lord it's 10 bucks

[1:09:37] policies people are paying 200 brother
[1:09:39] branham says you don't need life

[1:09:48] can have your seats as we turn to the
[1:09:49] scripture for the day malachi 4.
[1:09:53] we're going to get right down to
[1:09:54] business
[1:09:55] malachi chapter 4 we're going to read
[1:09:57] the whole chapter
[1:09:59] amen
[1:10:01] so i hope brother tim isn't overbearing
[1:10:03] i hope i'm not too long
[1:10:05] am i brother felix am i too long buddy
[1:10:08] was i too long last night
[1:10:10] did you enjoy the service or not okay
[1:10:11] good
[1:10:14] we're gonna talk about a few things that
[1:10:15] are very very
[1:10:17] sketchy gray areas that people always
[1:10:20] seem to use to make division in the
[1:10:23] message
[1:10:25] the message of the hour
[1:10:27] and the message of the hour means the
[1:10:29] message for your day
[1:10:31] and the message of the hour is now being
[1:10:33] preached by five full ministers and
[1:10:35] there's an anointing that comes with the
[1:10:37] malachi 4 ministry the elijah anointing
[1:10:40] and any minister that receives what the
[1:10:42] prophet that prophet that fulfilled this
[1:10:44] scripture we're going to read they
[1:10:46] preach that
[1:10:47] change happens
[1:10:50] who believes that change happens when
[1:10:52] you speak the truth
[1:10:55] who's ever had someone tell them the
[1:10:56] truth like a dad or a mom or a friend
[1:10:59] and it hurt raise your hand please
[1:11:03] it hurt i've had it happen in the last
[1:11:05] couple months
[1:11:06] half time not all the time the person
[1:11:09] well
[1:11:10] sorry all the time they have your best
[1:11:12] interest in mind true if they're a real
[1:11:15] dad a real mom a real pastor they have
[1:11:18] your real interest in mind but not
[1:11:20] always are they correct
[1:11:23] i'm going to say that
[1:11:24] you need to though submit yourself to
[1:11:27] god
[1:11:28] because that's the will of god we want
[1:11:30] the will of god not the will of man
[1:11:33] right
[1:11:34] we want the will of god brother timothy
[1:11:36] do you want the will of god in your life
[1:11:38] then not the will of your dad
[1:11:41] you want god's will for you
[1:11:43] but that will of god that you have and
[1:11:46] your brother has and your dad has can be
[1:11:49] the same
[1:11:50] hey can i get a name man brothers
[1:11:52] your children can stay around you and
[1:11:55] want what you've got
[1:11:57] i want them to move away moms are like
[1:11:58] this i don't need my kids to move away
[1:12:01] my mom's like that she doesn't want me
[1:12:03] to move
[1:12:05] you better believe it there's the
[1:12:06] pastor's wife better believe better stay
[1:12:07] home jared
[1:12:09] but that's not bondage
[1:12:11] because there are times you've got to
[1:12:13] leave father mother we know that from
[1:12:14] scripture abraham
[1:12:17] okay we're going to read this and i'm
[1:12:18] going to be very very clear today i'm
[1:12:20] going to try to go a little slower i'm
[1:12:21] going to try and be more i don't know
[1:12:23] stand behind the pulpit
[1:12:26] if i can do that i might have to take my
[1:12:28] tie off though it's getting hot
[1:12:30] malachi 4 who's there say amen if you've
[1:12:32] opened your bible or you're going to
[1:12:34] look at it in scripture
[1:12:36] okay i'm going to say something i'm
[1:12:37] preaching on myself because i recently
[1:12:38] had to change
[1:12:40] i brought this and
[1:12:42] this as my bible for a while and that
[1:12:44] was wrong
[1:12:49] it's just easier to carry this and i can
[1:12:51] say to my wife but i can now
[1:12:55] need to
[1:12:57] and this
[1:12:58] does that help anybody
[1:13:00] because if your child sees you reading
[1:13:02] this
[1:13:03] they get that this
[1:13:06] news when i'm looking at my bible can i
[1:13:08] open facebook when i'm reading my bible
[1:13:11] so don't call me old school preacher and
[1:13:14] he's so backward 20th century that's
[1:13:16] 21st century
[1:13:18] we're living in the 21st century we need
[1:13:20] to read our bible
[1:13:22] now let's read our bible malachi 4
[1:13:25] verse 1. you know what i don't need my
[1:13:27] ipad
[1:13:30] can we do this
[1:13:32] who wants the holy ghost speak now
[1:13:35] amen i just
[1:13:38] we're good we'll get a new one
[1:13:41] for behold the day cometh that shall
[1:13:44] burn as and
[1:13:46] say it
[1:13:47] so i'm going to need a little
[1:13:48] participation even the young children
[1:13:50] when i stop
[1:13:51] something if you're following if you're
[1:13:53] listening please say the next word
[1:13:55] so for behold this is a promise that the
[1:13:58] lord has given the day cometh that shall
[1:14:01] burn as an oven
[1:14:03] let me ask you has the world burned like
[1:14:05] an oven yet
[1:14:10] no
[1:14:11] that wasn't loud enough did we answer
[1:14:12] the question was i not clear the day
[1:14:14] cometh that that shall
[1:14:17] burn as an oven the world has not burned
[1:14:20] therefore the end has not come
[1:14:22] therefore let's continue reading and all
[1:14:25] the proud yea and them that do
[1:14:29] thank you
[1:14:30] shelby
[1:14:32] so if you're doing wicked or you choose
[1:14:34] like we talked about last night bondage
[1:14:46] keep reading and the day that cometh
[1:14:48] that that's future tense shall burn them
[1:14:51] up has that day burned everyone up
[1:14:53] brother matthew so any minister that
[1:14:56] tries to tell you the end is up and in
[1:14:57] 1977 is a false prophet
[1:15:01] false ministry leave in jesus name
[1:15:05] any person preaching
[1:15:06] already through the tribulation and in
[1:15:08] the millennium is false
[1:15:12] all right any person that tells you that
[1:15:14] grace is over is a false prophet
[1:15:19] any person that and you want to tell
[1:15:20] your children you aren't saved because
[1:15:22] you were born after a certain year
[1:15:25] you lying devil
[1:15:27] you've given our children no hope why
[1:15:29] would they want to serve you you know
[1:15:30] what that doctrine will do by the
[1:15:32] matthew all your family will leave your
[1:15:34] children will never serve that
[1:15:37] because it's false doctrine
[1:15:39] false doctrine is what we are against
[1:15:41] evil
[1:15:43] places and you will
[1:15:45] because the bible says it not brother
[1:15:47] tim i'm not going to read one quote of
[1:15:49] the prophet today
[1:15:52] but everything i said is what he said
[1:15:58] people say you need the profit you all
[1:16:00] you do if you don't quote random every
[1:16:02] service
[1:16:03] not a preacher in the message you liar
[1:16:06] you've caused a click
[1:16:09] you don't need to read one
[1:16:13] you can have people have a relationship
[1:16:17] it's the truth nothing but the truth
[1:16:20] brother bran say don't mention me don't
[1:16:22] play my tapes read your bible go to
[1:16:24] church listen to your pastor he said if
[1:16:26] you don't have a local pastor or
[1:16:28] preacher that our minister church to go
[1:16:30] to that's preaching truth you go anyhow
[1:16:33] is that what he said
[1:16:36] i'm not reading this quote i'm not going
[1:16:38] to quote
[1:16:39] i've heard it i believe it and that's
[1:16:41] what i believe
[1:16:43] what do you believe
[1:16:45] i believe that i don't want to be a part
[1:16:47] of malachi 4 1 where it says those that
[1:16:50] do wickly shall be stubble no they shall
[1:16:53] also that day cometh shall burn them up
[1:16:56] i don't want to be part of that
[1:16:58] amen
[1:16:59] who said that
[1:17:03] the lord of hosts
[1:17:06] do you know who's going to burn up this
[1:17:07] is
[1:17:09] by william branham
[1:17:11] you can believe it or not
[1:17:12] he said
[1:17:13] that that is the proud
[1:17:17] people like the americans
[1:17:19] and so forth direct quote
[1:17:22] malachi 4-1 go home he called them proud
[1:17:26] and i'm an american
[1:17:27] it's true
[1:17:29] americans are very proud
[1:17:31] do you know someone else that has the
[1:17:33] same kind of uh
[1:17:34] spirit
[1:17:36] that was proud that wanted to be like
[1:17:38] god
[1:17:40] satan
[1:17:42] the devil
[1:17:44] is proud puffed up therefore be a proud
[1:17:47] person puffed up and you're going to
[1:17:49] become what stubble
[1:17:51] those that lift themselves up will fall
[1:17:54] any minister in the message that says he
[1:17:56] has a special gift will fall will
[1:17:59] prophecy
[1:18:00] his ministry will fall
[1:18:03] apart his church will go to nothing
[1:18:05] actually
[1:18:06] all of his family will stay with him
[1:18:10] and the bigger right every generation
[1:18:12] you have ten six kids we got 20 people
[1:18:14] 40 people in the church and they're all
[1:18:15] in the family they get intermingled they
[1:18:17] get married everyone that's following
[1:18:18] this man is just family
[1:18:20] this is not a family religion this is
[1:18:23] god personally
[1:18:26] you are
[1:18:27] i will carry you brother jared
[1:18:30] wants to meet you matthew he wants your
[1:18:32] wife married to him and then when you
[1:18:34] get in a relationship as a single sister
[1:18:36] with jesus christ he will give you a
[1:18:39] he will because he promised he would
[1:18:42] you're not ready
[1:18:44] that's why you're not married
[1:18:46] god knows when you're going to be ready
[1:18:49] so don't get desperate don't get all
[1:18:51] whipped up in your flesh
[1:18:53] flesh
[1:18:54] to have something that you aren't
[1:18:55] supposed to have
[1:18:57] you need to watch and pray
[1:19:01] watch and i don't need this book
[1:19:05] gonna help some
[1:19:06] i don't need this book
[1:19:21] we'll just leave it right there
[1:19:23] you make the choice
[1:19:25] what we need is a life
[1:19:28] read all this you want i've heard people
[1:19:30] i listen to the seals i never stop 50
[1:19:33] out
[1:19:34] i think what they do sister
[1:19:36] cutting up every minute in the message
[1:19:38] cutting up and everyone's bad
[1:19:41] wrong spirit
[1:19:46] okay let's bring it down to another
[1:19:48] level
[1:19:51] denominational people have the same
[1:19:52] bible we're reading this morning
[1:19:54] when they go out of their church why do
[1:19:56] they smoke
[1:19:57] why do they drink
[1:19:59] why do they defile their body because
[1:20:01] what is written in scripture is not
[1:20:02] convicting their heart which we're going
[1:20:04] to talk about dr jesus is going to do a
[1:20:06] heart surgery this morning for those of
[1:20:08] us that are here we need a heart
[1:20:11] transplant
[1:20:13] i hope you're taking note
[1:20:15] chris again and take notes and send me
[1:20:17] any question you have
[1:20:19] no questions too dumb no questions too
[1:20:21] hard
[1:20:23] prophet of god and the bible actually
[1:20:25] says a minister is to give an ex
[1:20:27] he is
[1:20:29] given a question
[1:20:32] no question is dumb that's what a
[1:20:33] teacher will tell you to a kid so when
[1:20:35] we have an adult come to us brother
[1:20:37] matthew a family member and they're
[1:20:38] asking questions they're not dumb for
[1:20:40] asking the questions
[1:20:42] we shouldn't name oh i don't have time
[1:20:44] for you because you have a question
[1:20:45] about william branham's mystery
[1:20:48] no
[1:20:49] you know what that person is screaming
[1:20:50] out brother dale help me
[1:20:53] understanding i don't do you know what
[1:20:55] it is maturity they're not mature but
[1:20:57] they can be mature if someone takes the
[1:20:59] time to work with them
[1:21:15] this is hard one
[1:21:17] put it on the shelf
[1:21:19] okay it's elf brother brother dale has
[1:21:22] all these books up on the shelf in his
[1:21:23] office right brother dale how often do
[1:21:25] you read those maybe not very much those
[1:21:27] books right but they're there
[1:21:29] as a resource to defeat the devil i'm
[1:21:32] not saying never read the message i'm
[1:21:33] not saying never read your bible i'm
[1:21:35] saying if you don't have your bible you
[1:21:37] don't have the message i'm not preaching
[1:21:38] from a pad anymore i'm not depending on
[1:21:41] mechanical devices
[1:21:43] nothing to preach
[1:21:46] i don't need it
[1:21:47] because i have the holy spirit i've read
[1:21:49] the message i have
[1:21:51] a minute i have one message book i want
[1:21:54] to read i want to show you i have my
[1:21:56] drink here i'm showing you everything
[1:21:58] here water
[1:22:02] are we getting somewhere
[1:22:03] and i had some other things maybe
[1:22:04] they're in there
[1:22:08] what's my point in all that why am i
[1:22:10] saying that what do we believe
[1:22:13] is wonderful it's rich
[1:22:15] not everyone that's listening needs to
[1:22:17] know it all in one day
[1:22:19] i'm not gonna try and spend a three-hour
[1:22:21] service today trying to persuade you the
[1:22:23] message is true i don't need to do that
[1:22:25] two weeks ago i had someone three people
[1:22:28] try to force me to have a debate online
[1:22:30] and have a video conf them and then be
[1:22:33] given permission to post that on the
[1:22:35] internet
[1:22:38] i said
[1:22:39] i have time to debate anything with you
[1:22:44] i don't have the time to debate
[1:22:46] does everyone understand that
[1:22:48] i said i will even go out coffee with
[1:22:50] you if you do three things and they
[1:22:52] won't do any of them
[1:22:54] what are you stop talking about brother
[1:22:55] branham
[1:22:56] take down anything that's negative on
[1:22:58] facebook about brother branham
[1:23:00] take away your logo
[1:23:03] they won't do it brother matthew
[1:23:05] this is the kind of boldness a believer
[1:23:07] needs to take
[1:23:08] not oh they left the message they're
[1:23:09] poisonous
[1:23:11] no they're hurting
[1:23:13] right mr matthew you have a brother
[1:23:15] hurting
[1:23:19] doctor jesus can heal a person
[1:23:22] someone could be a paul bill or saul
[1:23:25] stone stephen a person in the church
[1:23:33] about it these people that have started
[1:23:35] websites to attack the message
[1:23:37] god's grace and mercy they could be
[1:23:40] restored that's totally different than
[1:23:42] what you'll hear from other people
[1:23:43] totally
[1:23:44] but you say leave a message i will
[1:23:46] restore what do you believe
[1:23:51] your life
[1:23:52] you say you
[1:23:53] for your brother
[1:23:56] is evil of him and we're disappointed in
[1:23:58] you that's a spirit
[1:24:02] but brother goes and he goes somewhere
[1:24:03] by the dale if brother
[1:24:05] rise up and start a church five minutes
[1:24:07] from you i'm not
[1:24:08] to cause division in the church but if
[1:24:10] brother matthew felt called to start our
[1:24:11] church five minutes away brother five
[1:24:13] minutes away brother dale should be
[1:24:15] saying praise god we're going to support
[1:24:16] you that's what perry green did that's
[1:24:19] what brother branham did that's our
[1:24:21] example
[1:24:23] we believe a message we do the
[1:24:25] messenger's life what did he do yes he
[1:24:27] hunted guess what i don't hunt
[1:24:31] i'm backslidden i don't like hunting but
[1:24:35] i like and praise the lord
[1:24:38] sorry i feel really free and i'm just
[1:24:39] gonna take a little bit slower
[1:24:44] i don't have any notes
[1:24:46] i need my bible though
[1:24:51] okay let's go to a malachi 4 because we
[1:24:53] aren't done there we read the first
[1:24:55] verse i just want to take scripture if
[1:24:56] you have your streaming i would very
[1:24:58] much encourage you to open your bible
[1:25:01] you know what happened i'm going to say
[1:25:02] this
[1:25:04] you know what happens in the message
[1:25:06] malachi 4. let's turn there i don't need
[1:25:08] a turn there
[1:25:10] it's become common
[1:25:20] the message has become common to people
[1:25:27] the message would become
[1:25:29] just five dollars worth
[1:25:32] but one time it was fifty dollars
[1:25:40] devalued
[1:25:41] you want to talk about currency going
[1:25:43] down
[1:25:45] the message currency in people's lives
[1:25:47] has gone from 50 to 5.
[1:25:51] 90
[1:25:52] loss
[1:25:56] and only a true believer the message is
[1:25:59] christ only those that believe in jesus
[1:26:01] christ are going to see that 50 and
[1:26:03] invest the 50 and make it a hundred
[1:26:08] for the elijah eli
[1:26:11] elliot come on brother come on up here
[1:26:13] brother felix
[1:26:17] and your friend there what's his name
[1:26:19] cody come on up here let's have you
[1:26:20] three brothers stand up here as an
[1:26:22] example this is all just the right
[1:26:25] so yeah are there felix i want the
[1:26:26] oldest one here i want the oldest one
[1:26:28] right here because you're the oldest
[1:26:29] brother right
[1:26:30] how old are you
[1:26:33] 11. okay this is going to help you guys
[1:26:35] this is gonna help brother cody how old
[1:26:37] are you and guess what you're all gonna
[1:26:38] you're all gonna walk away with money
[1:26:39] today
[1:26:41] if you want it or we'll have a decision
[1:26:42] making what you're gonna do with it okay
[1:26:45] whether felix is nine years old 11 years
[1:26:47] old
[1:26:48] 10 years old that means you got to go
[1:26:50] here brother
[1:26:51] you're older than him you're more mature
[1:26:56] right so here's the simple example okay
[1:26:59] who knows the story of the three talents
[1:27:01] we're going to get to malachi slowly but
[1:27:03] surely who knows the talent
[1:27:07] okay
[1:27:08] these three young men have been given
[1:27:10] talents i don't know them from adam i
[1:27:12] barely know these guys okay your dad
[1:27:14] knows what you're good at you are good
[1:27:16] at playing the piano is that correct
[1:27:20] brother cody what would you say the
[1:27:22] first thing you're really good at is
[1:27:25] what's the best thing that you're good
[1:27:26] at sports anything school
[1:27:29] you're good at sports okay you got a
[1:27:31] talent good job brother felix what's
[1:27:33] your talent
[1:27:35] farming i wonder why
[1:27:39] okay well i have a little a little for
[1:27:41] you okay brother here you go
[1:27:44] it's only five bucks but there's your
[1:27:46] talent okay
[1:27:47] you're gonna stay right there how you
[1:27:49] doing brother cody
[1:27:51] i'm gonna give you 20 canadian
[1:27:57] now he wishes he was in this
[1:28:00] yeah you're a little bit older than
[1:28:02] felix so he's going to get 20 canadian
[1:28:04] oh by the way right now the currency on
[1:28:06] that is about 70 so you're gonna lose
[1:28:08] six dollars so you only got 14 bucks in
[1:28:11] u.s dollars
[1:28:12] or if we do this that means he got about
[1:28:14] eight or nine so it's a little closer
[1:28:15] you're gonna have that in your hand okay
[1:28:16] you're holding your talent
[1:28:18] now this brother got more talent than he
[1:28:20] did correct
[1:28:22] this brother's church is a little bit
[1:28:24] bigger than his church
[1:28:28] praise the lord brother cody you got
[1:28:30] talent give me five buddy
[1:28:33] you got more than sports in you though
[1:28:34] man there's other talents that god's
[1:28:36] gonna give you all right if you give
[1:28:37] your heart to jesus he's gonna give you
[1:28:39] more uh of what you want
[1:28:42] and desire from him so i'm gonna give
[1:28:44] you that twenty dollars you got five
[1:28:46] dollars we're not done
[1:28:48] the oldest son praise god i'm the oldest
[1:28:50] too man you know what they say about
[1:28:52] oldest kids they're usually the richest
[1:28:54] and wisest of money and they have praise
[1:28:57] god you know why you know why because
[1:28:59] they have the most they have the most
[1:29:01] responsibility they gotta take care of
[1:29:03] all their siblings
[1:29:05] now that doesn't always how it works but
[1:29:06] i felix it doesn't work
[1:29:08] actually my brother has way more money
[1:29:10] than me
[1:29:11] and he's single
[1:29:13] sister
[1:29:16] brother eli
[1:29:17] elliot

[1:29:22] u.s okay now all three of these guys
[1:29:25] have been given money
[1:29:27] they've been given a talent
[1:29:29] they've been now given a ministry and
[1:29:31] it's different
[1:29:34] you have a different ministry keep it
[1:29:35] brother we're gonna get there we're to
[1:29:37] get there we're going to give you
[1:29:38] options there's options when you get
[1:29:40] from god but what you're going to do
[1:29:41] with it it's your
[1:29:43] choice it's your choice
[1:29:45] not daddy's choice what you're going to
[1:29:46] do with that 50 it's your choice because
[1:29:48] i gave it to you i was the owner of that
[1:29:50] property and i'm giving it to you
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:54] god is the owner of everything he's
[1:29:56] going to give it to our children what
[1:29:57] they have need of
[1:29:59] if you're making forty thousand dollars
[1:30:00] right now you need to find a way to make
[1:30:02] it work
[1:30:04] if you're making three hundred thousand
[1:30:05] 000 you are more responsible for what
[1:30:07] god's given you
[1:30:10] you're responsible as the oldest child
[1:30:13] to take care of your siblings and be a
[1:30:14] good example so mom can sit back in her
[1:30:16] recliner
[1:30:18] parade
[1:30:22] parent at 11 years
[1:30:24] you show your brother how to do math you
[1:30:26] show your brother how to have play play
[1:30:29] baseball or farming
[1:30:31] and if farming is his thing he can show
[1:30:32] his older brother how to farm
[1:30:36] don't worry buddy back in there we're
[1:30:38] going to give you something too jesus
[1:30:40] has something for you too
[1:30:44] don't worry buddy
[1:30:46] because jesus loves little children
[1:30:48] we're not done guys jesus loves you guys
[1:30:50] he died for you
[1:30:56] guys that's fine right i wasn't baptized
[1:30:59] till i was 12. do you guys want to
[1:31:03] afraid
[1:31:06] that seems really simple doesn't it but
[1:31:08] let me just tell you what what you need
[1:31:10] to do if you want to receive jesus in
[1:31:11] your hearts for you three and any young
[1:31:13] child out there what are you gonna do
[1:31:16] is going to say yes to jesus once and it
[1:31:20] gets a little bit easier
[1:31:21] but let me also tell you what's going to
[1:31:23] happen
[1:31:28] you need to stay in bed that's the devil
[1:31:30] not brother tim right
[1:31:31] can you say that's the devil
[1:31:33] yes he realizes that's the devil right
[1:31:35] this young man can be a powerhouse for
[1:31:37] jesus can you say amen
[1:31:40] can i hear the way
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:43] you can be sitting on the front row
[1:31:44] taking notes next service if you wanted
[1:31:46] to amen if you wanted to it's in you
[1:31:49] but they're elijah
[1:31:50] elliot that's i think it kind of means
[1:31:52] the same
[1:31:53] god wants to use you in the piano so
[1:31:55] your grandma doesn't have to keep
[1:31:56] playing she wants to pass it on to you
[1:32:00] so start practicing
[1:32:04] she wants to teach him an accordion
[1:32:05] praise god that's scriptural brother
[1:32:07] that your grandma will teach you how to
[1:32:09] do things
[1:32:10] do you understand his talent will go
[1:32:12] from 50 to 100 because
[1:32:18] that's in this man
[1:32:20] jesus and our two and three-year-old
[1:32:21] who's right there on our seat not
[1:32:24] being of active ministers
[1:32:28] these brothers have money in their
[1:32:30] account you have more money
[1:32:32] right now
[1:32:36] okay
[1:32:37] dude what are you gonna do with it
[1:32:39] you don't know
[1:32:40] save it what would you think you would
[1:32:42] do but cody spend it save it
[1:32:45] two savers
[1:32:52] i didn't tell him to say that
[1:32:54] like peter says
[1:32:56] who told you that
[1:32:58] god his heart do you young
[1:33:00] folk out of the mouth of babes let every
[1:33:03] word be established that is what we
[1:33:05] should do with our money just what he
[1:33:06] said go give that to your grandpa
[1:33:10] that's what you're supposed to do that's
[1:33:12] scriptural

[1:35:58] see what you'll find in children is they
[1:36:00] actually can speak volumes to an app
[1:36:04] three
[1:36:04] a whole
[1:36:08] message see that's the kind of preaching
[1:36:10] we need we don't need a guy standing up
[1:36:12] here for two hours you need to be saved
[1:36:15] william branham is the pride and if you
[1:36:17] don't receive him you're going to hell
[1:36:19] and basket
[1:36:22] that's what people are preaching today
[1:36:24] if you don't have a long skirt get out
[1:36:26] of our church if you have a slit right
[1:36:28] now get saved and move on go somewhere
[1:36:31] else
[1:36:32] i'm being serious
[1:36:34] this is what's going on in the message
[1:36:36] you aren't in the message the
[1:36:39] price the message is the love perfect
[1:36:41] love casts out some fear
[1:36:45] come on church we need to be a church
[1:36:47] that's lively that responds to the word
[1:36:50] because a dead church you can have your
[1:36:52] dead church sat in them and they're big
[1:36:54] congregations
[1:36:56] they've got a canadian spirit american
[1:36:58] spirit and they'll be part of malachi 1
[1:37:01] but thank god i'm not part of malachi 1
[1:37:04] because i have roots
[1:37:07] where are your roots or are you moving
[1:37:09] around every six months
[1:37:11] every two years because i'm a
[1:37:12] businessman and i want capital gains to
[1:37:15] be
[1:37:16] avoided so i i move every two years with
[1:37:19] my family really how's that going for
[1:37:21] you brother
[1:37:22] i bet your wife is stressed out of her
[1:37:24] brain
[1:37:25] why don't you sell all the businesses
[1:37:27] the houses you have buy a little rv
[1:37:31] do something for jesus
[1:37:33] i'm not saying sell all you have don't
[1:37:34] get me wrong well we've had those in the
[1:37:37] message the the capture it has to happen
[1:37:40] the moon is lined up this is happening
[1:37:42] right now here it is
[1:37:44] come on who's heard on the internet
[1:37:46] you've heard it false prophets
[1:37:49] they lead people they they make them
[1:37:51] hope and they make them say you gotta
[1:37:53] sell it all
[1:37:56] only one thing god asks you to do change
[1:37:58] and
[1:37:59] art
[1:38:00] let dr jesus brother cody and work on
[1:38:03] your heart
[1:38:05] hi back jesus is cutting on your heart
[1:38:08] praise the lord
[1:38:11] praise the lord he's working jesus is
[1:38:13] working now and now the spirit of life
[1:38:16] is going to come in the church the
[1:38:17] spirit of revival is what i believe is
[1:38:19] nothing but the truth and if you believe
[1:38:21] it's the you will preach energy you will
[1:38:24] preach dynamics not just
[1:38:28] a dead pew say you're a message believer
[1:38:31] and you're going to hell
[1:38:34] to hell
[1:38:36] are you ready to go
[1:38:37] do you know what your dad believes
[1:38:39] really know what your dad believes
[1:38:41] come on
[1:38:42] little girls don't know why they wear
[1:38:44] dresses or expect me tell them why
[1:38:47] don't be ashamed tell them why we don't
[1:38:49] cut our hair and if i cut my hair give
[1:38:51] them a testimony and say mom he didn't
[1:38:52] know it was wrong to cut my hair but now
[1:38:54] i know
[1:38:56] because i met jesus and his word says
[1:38:58] that if a woman shaves her
[1:39:00] she is you finish it
[1:39:03] go read your bible
[1:39:06] spirit spirits but i want to say today
[1:39:09] this scripture is fulfilled if you wanna
[1:39:13] 1965-0125 read this message don't listen
[1:39:16] to any critic about brother branham and
[1:39:18] you will find
[1:39:19] we're now seeing that scripture has been
[1:39:21] promised
[1:39:22] the fire falls
[1:39:25] to burn it up
[1:39:26] like today seeing scripture right before
[1:39:29] our eyes
[1:39:31] how many recognize scripture before our
[1:39:33] eyes
[1:39:36] guess what they're gonna do mockers and
[1:39:38] scoffers
[1:39:40] what are they mocking the seventh seal
[1:39:42] vision
[1:39:44] saying the seventh seal has not been
[1:39:46] opened is a lie
[1:39:49] it's open
[1:39:50] because the message
[1:39:52] the seal through that message that was
[1:39:54] preached is what
[1:39:58] thank you brother dale
[1:40:00] it's christ so to say any part of the
[1:40:02] cell does not open denies christ which
[1:40:05] denies the power that comes with the
[1:40:07] message that brother preach and the
[1:40:09] message is christ
[1:40:16] nothing less nothing more anything more
[1:40:18] to cry
[1:40:20] dead
[1:40:21] it's not jesus william branham it's
[1:40:24] jesus
[1:40:25] with the revelation of who he is
[1:40:28] igniting something within the bride
[1:40:30] saying i love you god
[1:40:35] many things take it out of us
[1:40:37] we let our business
[1:40:40] we let family
[1:40:42] i had them this weekend
[1:40:44] texting me all the day long i just put
[1:40:46] my phone block them to this weekend
[1:40:49] they're just taking up my time they're
[1:40:50] trying to fill my mind with doubt
[1:40:53] i love them
[1:40:54] but hey
[1:40:56] you're
[1:41:00] you're wasting my time so i want to
[1:41:01] bring a balance okay
[1:41:03] there's a time when a person comes to a
[1:41:05] pastor and comes to you as a brother
[1:41:07] right and says you know what i don't
[1:41:09] understand the message
[1:41:11] we need to fly where you gotta go
[1:41:13] go to vancouver island
[1:41:16] go where you gotta go and say i'm taking
[1:41:18] three days off i'm taking a weekend i
[1:41:20] flown here that will preach to him
[1:41:22] already a message
[1:41:23] you care about him jesus cares about him
[1:41:27] and if jesus cares
[1:41:29] about you
[1:41:30] the question this morning is do you
[1:41:32] actually care about your soul a lot
[1:41:35] brother cody do you want to go to heaven
[1:41:37] brother cody
[1:41:38] yes
[1:41:40] so how is our child supposed to go to
[1:41:41] heaven
[1:41:43] hear truth
[1:41:46] follow tim andes
[1:41:48] no follow dale langstaff
[1:41:50] follow brother eddie biskell
[1:41:52] follow tim pruitt donny reagan
[1:41:55] no
[1:41:56] follow william branham
[1:42:00] follow christ
[1:42:10] that when i say that statement i've done
[1:42:12] this
[1:42:14] i made it two separate things
[1:42:17] that's not what i said
[1:42:19] this is my shotgun and i needed this to
[1:42:22] line up in the word to be my scope to
[1:42:24] shoot the devil
[1:42:26] without this you don't have accuracy
[1:42:29] that is the message what i believe you
[1:42:32] need the bible every believer christian
[1:42:34] on this earth every human needs to read
[1:42:36] this book in this world but they need
[1:42:38] this
[1:42:42] to line up with the word
[1:42:44] brother branham says if i preach
[1:42:46] anything outside of the word you call me
[1:42:48] a false prophet and i'm he also says
[1:42:51] that he
[1:42:58] not pray for anybody until the angel of
[1:43:01] the lord came who believes that brother
[1:43:03] branham depended on the angel of the
[1:43:05] lord
[1:43:06] some of us
[1:43:08] that's the message there's people that
[1:43:10] don't believe that
[1:43:12] they say they're in the message they
[1:43:14] think he's a great man of god
[1:43:20] malachi 4.
[1:43:22] let's go there malachi 4.
[1:43:24] we know in whom we have belief
[1:43:26] do you know in whom you have believed
[1:43:29] how many believe jesus cares about him
[1:43:32] you go to the doctor jesus today and
[1:43:34] he's going to have a prescription talk
[1:43:36] it's a minute
[1:43:37] you need to take it
[1:43:40] i just stepped on african people's toes
[1:43:44] because they don't even go into doctors
[1:43:47] my says doctors are good my doctor says
[1:43:50] a doctor can help you
[1:43:53] you might even believe right now you
[1:43:54] need to go to a doctor you need to go to
[1:43:56] a doctor
[1:43:57] dr jesus
[1:44:00] but see i want to ask you a question
[1:44:02] have a family problem and a sickness in
[1:44:04] the home the first person you need to go
[1:44:06] to is
[1:44:08] jesus
[1:44:10] the great physician we sing about it
[1:44:12] right
[1:44:13] the great physician now is here the
[1:44:16] sympathizing jesus but we don't go to
[1:44:19] him he's great physician
[1:44:21] we never want him to help us we never
[1:44:23] want to come to a service where it cuts
[1:44:26] and says there's a problem we need to do
[1:44:28] a surgery
[1:44:29] and this morning i'm not doing an arm
[1:44:31] surgery i'm not doing a leg
[1:44:35] branham says again you can go look up he
[1:44:37] says people need
[1:44:38] surgery on their
[1:44:41] they need unbelief removed and faith put
[1:44:44] into their heart
[1:44:45] that's what he said
[1:44:47] so you have unbelief in your heart if
[1:44:50] you have unbelief
[1:44:52] what does that lead to attributes of
[1:44:55] sin smoking drinking lying committing
[1:44:57] adultery all those things are just
[1:45:00] attributes
[1:45:01] they're not sin this is what i believe
[1:45:04] do you believe it
[1:45:07] any person that streams a service if
[1:45:09] they actually listen to the whole thing
[1:45:10] and they believe it they should share it
[1:45:14] it's not my path though it's not my
[1:45:16] minister i'm listening to it i don't
[1:45:18] know if i agree with it that's fine
[1:45:21] you do what you want with jesus
[1:45:24] there's only one jesus
[1:45:26] it's not brother branham's jesus it's
[1:45:28] not paul's jesus preaches any jesus he's
[1:45:31] not of god this is bible you need to
[1:45:34] read your bible you can only stay with a
[1:45:36] minister
[1:45:37] you know your bible
[1:45:38] and you know the message
[1:45:41] because you're so used to
[1:45:43] well our pastor has to read volume
[1:45:46] page six paragraph 40 are we all
[1:45:49] together i'm going to wait cause we all
[1:45:50] printed it out for you today
[1:45:53] you're still
[1:45:56] you're so used to as a pastor
[1:46:01] push play and obey
[1:46:04] yeah i push play and obey too but i
[1:46:06] don't push play and collect tithes
[1:46:10] that's anti-word
[1:46:13] your pastor is someone that's active
[1:46:15] that can pray with you
[1:46:17] that can work with
[1:46:19] guy we're getting there
[1:46:22] lord say man don't pay man if you're not
[1:46:24] hallelujah is the lord
[1:46:26] let's keep reading we're going to just
[1:46:27] move into another gear second part
[1:46:30] because we got three parts no i'm just
[1:46:31] kidding
[1:46:33] change our our position
[1:46:36] are we ready for part two
[1:46:38] okay so we're at the end of malachi 4 1
[1:46:41] it says and they shall leave them
[1:46:43] neither root nor branch that means
[1:46:45] everything will be destroyed that's
[1:46:48] simple math i mean not math english
[1:46:50] let's read verse 2 if you're following
[1:46:52] along please
[1:46:57] that afraid of god
[1:47:00] we're not afraid of him like a fear like
[1:47:02] afraid we're feeling that means we have
[1:47:04] respect
[1:47:06] there's a difference so a person can see
[1:47:08] f-e-a-r and they know the english
[1:47:10] language here but it doesn't have the
[1:47:12] same meaning so an african rule we'd
[1:47:15] fear and think it says we fear god we
[1:47:18] fear what brother branham says and we're
[1:47:20] afraid that's not what it's saying it's
[1:47:22] saying fear god and have respect for his
[1:47:24] name shall the sun is prophecy again
[1:47:27] every every scripture is prophecy
[1:47:29] brother branham says if you don't read
[1:47:31] your bible and see christ in curses
[1:47:36] you need to go back and read it again
[1:47:43] yes all right
[1:47:47] how many believers
[1:47:48] i'm going to say what i believe i
[1:47:50] believe that was the healing campaigns
[1:47:51] of william branham
[1:47:56] healing in his wings and ye shall go
[1:47:58] forth and grow up and be calves of the
[1:48:00] stall
[1:48:01] you will become
[1:48:03] mature
[1:48:04] and you'll go from healing in your wings
[1:48:07] you'll be healed and restored to now
[1:48:09] grow up and be mature believers
[1:48:12] so that when the prophet dies
[1:48:15] you don't die
[1:48:17] when the prophet's healing
[1:48:19] over you don't just follow a man because
[1:48:21] of his healing you follow him because
[1:48:23] what he preached brought life it brought
[1:48:26] change and if change isn't coming
[1:48:29] in a service we are preaching something
[1:48:31] off because change needs to happen
[1:48:33] change is hard but change is necessary
[1:48:35] to take a body change change is hard but
[1:48:38] change is necessary to take a body
[1:48:39] change
[1:48:40] you must change today
[1:48:43] if you're looking at an iphone don't
[1:48:45] have your children look at iphones
[1:48:47] period
[1:48:49] take it out
[1:48:50] let's do it for one week
[1:48:52] if you're letting your children look at
[1:48:53] it bad this is what i do if my kid acts
[1:48:56] up one time i say you're not getting an
[1:48:58] ipad
[1:49:00] do i let him look at ipads whether or
[1:49:02] not or let him watch a little something
[1:49:04] if he's good yes 15 20 minutes bible
[1:49:06] character stories that's fine
[1:49:09] but did i step up those brother branham
[1:49:11] did
[1:49:13] brother branham went to a a show
[1:49:17] what
[1:49:18] the prophet
[1:49:20] yeah he had a chris
[1:49:23] what
[1:49:24] yeah
[1:49:26] but
[1:49:26] salvation issue you can't have a
[1:49:28] christmas tree and people can't have a
[1:49:29] christmas tree in their house
[1:49:32] splits in the message
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:37] you want and did say things about
[1:49:39] christmas trees then is earlier he's
[1:49:40] true even after he said don't make it a
[1:49:43] pagan worship we don't bow down to the
[1:49:44] christmas tree anyone had a pumpkin in
[1:49:47] their house as a decoration
[1:49:49] anyone ever had let's see uh well what
[1:49:52] do you do here um
[1:49:53] you know what i'm saying right
[1:49:55] anyone have lights in there i know the
[1:49:56] pastor does he has a little towel you
[1:49:59] decorate your house
[1:50:00] a tree is just a little decor i can have
[1:50:02] a plant in my house is that going to
[1:50:03] make me go to hell brother matthew
[1:50:06] but people preach that
[1:50:08] in the message
[1:50:11] in the met
[1:50:12] they believe brother brown's a prophet
[1:50:13] and they tell people you will go to
[1:50:16] if you have a christmas tree and you
[1:50:17] can't come to our church because you
[1:50:19] have a tree in your house can everyone

[1:50:50] to realize if we tread down we're going
[1:50:52] to tread down the wick we're going to
[1:50:53] sit down soon for they shall be ashes
[1:50:55] under the soles of our feet nothing you
[1:50:58] know what
[1:51:00] let's speak
[1:51:01] you know what he's going to
[1:51:03] shizz
[1:51:07] you will be ashes and you say william
[1:51:09] brandon was a prophet too by the way
[1:51:10] because you've deceived yourself this is
[1:51:12] hard word but it's true
[1:51:14] this is the truth this is what i believe
[1:51:16] what do you believe
[1:51:18] you might not your pastor might not
[1:51:20] agree with something i'm saying i don't
[1:51:21] know unless he does everything
[1:51:23] but there's things that are preached
[1:51:25] in a church
[1:51:27] i am a evangelist right now
[1:51:29] i can drop my atomic bomb and guess what
[1:51:31] tomorrow i am gone
[1:51:34] my atomic bombs aren't to split churches
[1:51:37] to cause division because that's
[1:51:38] directly against the bible i am to edify
[1:51:40] and uplift the body if you walk out of
[1:51:43] these services this weekend and think
[1:51:44] brother tim is trying to make you leave
[1:51:45] the message you're sadly you are
[1:51:48] mistaken
[1:51:49] the whole goal is to lift up jesus
[1:51:51] christ which is the message
[1:51:53] remember
[1:51:54] law moses my servant which i commanded
[1:51:56] unto him in horab for all
[1:51:59] can we say all
[1:52:02] israel with the statutes and judgments
[1:52:06] right there in laodicea they shut down
[1:52:10] because if they were in moses's day it
[1:52:11] would have been what all law
[1:52:14] and judge
[1:52:15] our prophet is a judge moses i'm talking
[1:52:18] about he's a judge but you had to have a
[1:52:20] revelation that moses was the judge he
[1:52:23] was the final say which is what a
[1:52:24] prophet is
[1:52:26] and if you didn't believe him right
[1:52:27] sister if your husband didn't believe
[1:52:28] that moses was the prophet guess what
[1:52:30] would have happened to your little girl
[1:52:33] in the wilderness in egypt in the world
[1:52:35] we know that's a type of the world what
[1:52:36] would have happened
[1:52:38] your daughter would have died
[1:52:40] but you know what's happening people are
[1:52:42] not applying the token jesus christ on
[1:52:44] their heart and they will die
[1:52:47] let's have our seats and we're going to
[1:52:48] read the final two verses
[1:52:51] who knows the final two verses by heart
[1:52:53] without raise your hand if you know the
[1:52:54] final two verses of malachi 4 by heart i
[1:52:57] do is anyone else
[1:53:01] probably
[1:53:02] if you don't praise god brother
[1:53:05] my but i sure know the author real well
[1:53:08] i think from there we can get a hearty
[1:53:09] amen on that one
[1:53:12] your pastor might not be able to read
[1:53:14] but at least he knows
[1:53:17] i'd rather have a pastor that knows
[1:53:19] jesus and doesn't know how to read than
[1:53:21] someone so intellectual that they're
[1:53:22] feeding intellectual garbage in the
[1:53:24] message of the hour
[1:53:27] because they take their intellect and
[1:53:28] they try and
[1:53:29] certainly say we're going to try and
[1:53:31] political
[1:53:33] political
[1:53:34] but i'm going to be very plain this is
[1:53:36] what i believe
[1:53:37] the original bible is the faith
[1:53:40] that has been delivered to us
[1:53:43] through a prophet
[1:53:44] right here
[1:53:46] promise and behold i will send you
[1:53:50] who
[1:53:52] it does not say william branham it says
[1:53:54] elijah
[1:53:56] an anointing of elijah the
[1:54:00] before when
[1:54:03] just hope just wait you're getting ahead
[1:54:04] before what
[1:54:06] the coming of the great
[1:54:09] and dreadful
[1:54:10] day of the lord oh but i thought that
[1:54:13] this is what they'll tell you in the
[1:54:14] world oh
[1:54:15] but that's meaning john the baptist and
[1:54:17] that means jesus no no no no no no no
[1:54:20] look at the verse i send you elijah the
[1:54:23] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:54:25] and dreadful
[1:54:27] day of the lord
[1:54:28] as far as i know
[1:54:30] right now it's not dreadful and we go
[1:54:33] back to verse one it's not burning
[1:54:36] the world has not been consumed
[1:54:38] therefore we're not in a tribulation
[1:54:40] read a prophet's message you will not
[1:54:42] die be atomic bomb drop in this so we
[1:54:51] heads up pie when we go out here i don't
[1:54:53] have to read the news about russia
[1:54:55] i already know what's happening in
[1:54:57] russia without reading the news i
[1:54:58] already know what's happening in israel
[1:55:00] right now people are going back to their
[1:55:01] homeland i don't need the news to tell
[1:55:03] me that i need a prophet that had a
[1:55:06] vision that could
[1:55:08] happen
[1:55:09] and this prophet william branham saul
[1:55:11] the jews will gather in their home will
[1:55:13] be 144 000 12 000 from every tribe he
[1:55:16] saw the catholic church will bail out
[1:55:18] america mark my words i am saying a
[1:55:21] false thing it will not happen thus
[1:55:24] saith the lord it will it's a vision
[1:55:26] that prophet
[1:55:28] not tim he's not saying that
[1:55:30] william branham said thus saith the lord
[1:55:33] you start hearing
[1:55:35] i want to say names but i'm going to
[1:55:37] hold back and not say names with a dale
[1:55:38] but let me just see this bro tim i'll
[1:55:41] call him because his name is tim on the
[1:55:42] on the video
[1:55:44] it's not to manny's
[1:55:48] brother tim that went into this service
[1:55:51] you and your little wisdom sitting in
[1:55:53] your home
[1:55:55] telling lies to people about the bible
[1:55:58] some of you don't know what i'm talking
[1:55:59] about but that's good
[1:56:00] i'm talking to brother tim who's going
[1:56:01] to listen
[1:56:03] you doubt her
[1:56:05] you unbeliever
[1:56:07] you skeptic
[1:56:08] once walked in truth
[1:56:11] and now you say you have the truth but
[1:56:12] you're mocking something you left i want
[1:56:14] to tell you brother tim in all grace and
[1:56:16] sincerity
[1:56:17] you need to realize your heart needs a
[1:56:21] surgery
[1:56:27] and what you're speaking
[1:56:28] is not growing families
[1:56:30] it's not making them go on with jesus
[1:56:33] it's making them doubt
[1:56:35] and in your own life you know this
[1:56:39] you have been divorced two or three
[1:56:41] times
[1:56:43] this is what's going on
[1:56:45] you want to know what's really going on
[1:56:47] this is happening right now
[1:56:48] and people are listening to that man
[1:56:51] and his name is tim
[1:56:53] and my name is tim you can have two men
[1:56:56] with the same name sitting in the same
[1:56:58] church 15 years ago and now we've gone
[1:57:00] completely different ways
[1:57:03] i'm way younger than he is and he has
[1:57:05] way more money than me and he i'll never
[1:57:08] have as much money as he has
[1:57:11] doesn't matter because the prophet of
[1:57:13] god said money will get you every time
[1:57:15] what's the next
[1:57:17] so he wants a popularity and a following
[1:57:20] therefore he needs the message and
[1:57:22] attack it because there's a following in
[1:57:24] the message
[1:57:25] take the message out of his preaching
[1:57:26] and attacks of ministers in the gospel
[1:57:28] he has nothing to preach
[1:57:32] what do you believe tim
[1:57:35] what do you really believe
[1:57:37] you say you love god and you love
[1:57:39] christians and you have a christian
[1:57:40] spirit but you're what you mean is not
[1:57:42] love
[1:57:45] come on rod
[1:57:48] i'm speaking now jesus my name by the
[1:57:51] dale
[1:57:52] he said judas has forsaken me he called
[1:57:54] his name right in scripture
[1:57:56] he
[1:57:57] cleopas has forsaken me
[1:58:00] right i'm going down paul had friends
[1:58:02] leave him
[1:58:04] he didn't bash
[1:58:07] he didn't criticize them
[1:58:10] what did he do
[1:58:11] loved them
[1:58:13] what did brother branham do
[1:58:15] love them
[1:58:17] what is tim anders going to do as a
[1:58:18] minister love
[1:58:20] them
[1:58:22] and i'm humbly saying malachi 4 5 says i
[1:58:25] will send you elijah the prophet before
[1:58:28] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:58:30] of the lord that is uh can we all say
[1:58:33] promise
[1:58:35] god does not lie how many believe god
[1:58:37] does not lie
[1:58:38] if god does not lie his word is true
[1:58:41] find yourself in scripture this is where
[1:58:42] we are verse 6
[1:58:44] this is the whole message today what do
[1:58:46] i believe verse 6
[1:58:48] he will turn the
[1:58:51] heart of the fathers to the children
[1:58:54] that is john the baptist
[1:58:57] and
[1:58:58] conjunction word that means there's now
[1:59:00] a separation i'm a teacher okay
[1:59:03] conjunction i'm not a dummy tim
[1:59:07] not a dummy it says and
[1:59:10] and
[1:59:13] the heart of the children
[1:59:17] to fathers
[1:59:19] those that have gone before us
[1:59:21] we are all children here today in christ
[1:59:23] we have grown up in maturity now our
[1:59:25] hearts are being turned lest oh now this
[1:59:28] is a key because i just i've been really
[1:59:30] digesting this brother dale
[1:59:32] lest so what's going to happen the heart
[1:59:35] of the children to their fathers that
[1:59:37] must happen
[1:59:38] lest i come and smite
[1:59:41] you need to look up what lest means do a
[1:59:43] little study test
[1:59:46] because people are like oh yeah
[1:59:48] i don't know if you're seeing what i'm
[1:59:49] seeing what lest means lest i come and
[1:59:52] smite the earth that means god is gonna
[1:59:54] smite the earth
[1:59:55] if
[1:59:56] that doesn't happen
[1:59:59] what
[2:00:02] it's on there
[2:00:03] the heart of the children to their
[2:00:05] fathers
[2:00:06] he promised that elijah ministry would
[2:00:08] come with an anointing okay
[2:00:10] that can be any man
[2:00:12] right anyone
[2:00:14] anyone
[2:00:16] they can say they have an elijah
[2:00:17] ministry
[2:00:18] isn't there ministers right now that say
[2:00:20] they have an elijah ministry
[2:00:22] false
[2:00:23] false
[2:00:24] they're not in the message by the way
[2:00:26] they don't believe brother brown is a
[2:00:27] prophet but i'll tell you right now he's
[2:00:28] in africa a brother he's an african and
[2:00:31] he says he's elijah he's not in the
[2:00:32] message i want to be clear on this he
[2:00:34] believes he's a prophet okay do you want
[2:00:35] me to tell you exactly what he's doing
[2:00:41] reading this
[2:00:42] without anyone knowing
[2:00:44] and using the same things the prophet
[2:00:46] spoke
[2:00:48] elijah is his name
[2:00:50] go look him up no don't look them up you
[2:00:52] don't have to look them up
[2:00:58] any person that's profit lying about
[2:00:59] america right now
[2:01:01] they've read the prophet
[2:01:08] i was just looking recently at the devil
[2:01:10] and attack on the message
[2:01:13] trying to attack uh ministers in the
[2:01:15] message okay
[2:01:17] personal and open because it's public
[2:01:19] they attacked brother reagan about
[2:01:21] preaching to children about money and
[2:01:23] tithe and they mocked him
[2:01:28] and said he's a million dollar pastor
[2:01:30] that's what the devil is saying to
[2:01:32] people okay
[2:01:33] that is
[2:01:35] a pastor can have millions of dollars if
[2:01:37] he wants to
[2:01:41] half the church believes that brother
[2:01:42] deal
[2:01:43] half your church believes that you can
[2:01:44] have a million dollars
[2:01:46] you better not have a million dollars
[2:01:48] just kidding let me just say something
[2:01:50] the bible says that a man of god
[2:01:53] deserves half honor
[2:01:55] no double
[2:01:57] double honor
[2:01:59] so if my pastor listen to me real good
[2:02:01] in canada
[2:02:03] is not making two hundred thousand
[2:02:04] dollars because a hundred thousand
[2:02:06] dollars if he has a family is what you
[2:02:08] need to make it now let's bring it down
[2:02:09] to 50 okay because we're in we're in a
[2:02:12] different country province let's just
[2:02:14] say for a young couple you need 40 or
[2:02:16] 50. okay a pastor should make six digits
[2:02:20] to be able to provide for his family to
[2:02:22] be able to help others
[2:02:24] okay i'm just giving this i'm not saying
[2:02:25] this is the way brother dale but i'm
[2:02:27] just opening people's eyes to the
[2:02:28] reality because my dad is a pastor and
[2:02:31] he was a minister guess what my dad does
[2:02:33] in the middle of it
[2:02:35] oh you needed me to come to the hospital
[2:02:37] you need me to come
[2:02:38] and then the car that's my dad
[2:02:40] people that are listening to the servers
[2:02:42] every one of you know my dad
[2:02:45] he'll wake up in the middle of night
[2:02:47] he'll text a person he'll call them take
[2:02:49] them out for coffee drop everything
[2:02:52] for one soul
[2:02:54] that's why
[2:03:01] but then matthew said gave me testimony
[2:03:03] that my dad talked to him personally
[2:03:05] right by the math and helped counsel
[2:03:07] that's a real heart of a shepherd
[2:03:09] brother dale will take you out for
[2:03:10] coffee spend time with you but as soon
[2:03:13] as a pastor gets so out of touch with
[2:03:15] his people he can't preach nothing that
[2:03:17] will help them because you smell like
[2:03:20] the sheep felix i gotta know what a
[2:03:22] nine-year-old is thinking i've got to
[2:03:24] know what a 11 year old is thinking
[2:03:25] that's william branham's message it's
[2:03:28] simplicity
[2:03:30] so simple that the elect
[2:03:32] not the elected intellectual cannot
[2:03:34] receive it those that want their
[2:03:35] psychology books have your psychology i
[2:03:39] did human development psychology and i
[2:03:41] will tell you it does not work
[2:03:43] i did it in educational school they make
[2:03:46] you take two classes in psychology
[2:03:48] brother matthew they'll tell me how to
[2:03:50] run my family their way
[2:03:52] they'll tell you that you should be
[2:03:53] giving your child little fun things to
[2:03:56] do about every hour like ipads and give
[2:03:58] them 10 minutes 20 minutes make it a
[2:04:00] little bit longer longer it's
[2:04:02] educational
[2:04:04] for kids to have screen time
[2:04:06] that's teaching in schools
[2:04:08] it's not educational for them to have
[2:04:10] screen time it's
[2:04:12] diseducationing them it's causing their
[2:04:14] brain to free fraud
[2:04:17] my gatorade isn't done that's what the
[2:04:19] donnie reagan had
[2:04:22] and i've got my ibuprofe in case my back
[2:04:24] acts up devil
[2:04:25] so you can't beat me now see ibuprofen
[2:04:28] just a little thing like that someone
[2:04:29] could say you have unbelief you don't
[2:04:30] believe god can heal you i believe it he
[2:04:32] has been healing me over the last year
[2:04:35] i'm
[2:04:36] god for god's glory i was supposed to
[2:04:37] get a steroid injection in my back
[2:04:39] because just took a scan and they said
[2:04:42] because i was having shooting pain i had
[2:04:44] a disc bulge and my dad had the same
[2:04:47] thing and it hit his nerve and my nerve
[2:04:49] and it was going pained up down my leg
[2:04:53] i sat and i had it all set up the
[2:04:56] appearance it was going to cover it the
[2:04:57] steroid injection and i said you know
[2:05:03] yes
[2:05:05] what do you believe
[2:05:07] jesus cares for you doctor jesus care so
[2:05:09] he went to prayer i went to prayer i got
[2:05:12] desperate before i had a back anyone
[2:05:14] ever had a back issue anyone have
[2:05:16] financial trouble

[2:05:32] that aren't believers
[2:05:34] i'm gonna cut tell someone about jesus
[2:05:36] and pay for their five dollar coffee
[2:05:39] that's the message that i believe that's
[2:05:41] the gospel news that's good news and
[2:05:43] brings hope deliverance
[2:05:45] builds trust
[2:05:49] all right i need another person

[2:06:05] is a fulfillment and has been fulfilled
[2:06:07] today
[2:06:08] part
[2:06:09] it's not done
[2:06:10] because it says
[2:06:11] the world's going to be destroyed

[2:11:22] this out
[2:11:23] you can clip it out and put it on the
[2:11:25] internet
[2:11:26] brother tim's testimony being raised in
[2:11:28] the message i was raised in a home that
[2:11:30] loved the lord
[2:11:32] i was raised in a home
[2:11:34] that stood for truth
[2:11:38] i had to find out if it was true
[2:11:40] myself
[2:11:42] i couldn't just believe it was true but
[2:11:44] as i grew up
[2:11:46] i knew
[2:11:50] no
[2:11:54] i wish you could say
[2:11:55] you know when i got that first call from
[2:11:57] the lord that i just answered it right
[2:11:59] away yes god i want to do what you say i
[2:12:01] didn't happen for me
[2:12:03] raised in the
[2:12:04] message right raising the message of the
[2:12:07] hour preached by the
[2:12:09] my parents believed that my grandpa
[2:12:10] believed it
[2:12:11] i had to believe it
[2:12:14] okay this is my testimony you can post
[2:12:17] this if you want on the internet
[2:12:19] this part
[2:12:21] um
[2:12:22] i grew up went to bible way
[2:12:25] as my home church but the biscuit
[2:12:26] dedicated me was i was born
[2:12:28] when we moved out to indiana my
[2:12:36] open and honest when i was a
[2:12:38] young boy i saw my dad serving my
[2:12:41] grandpa serving that's just what i saw
[2:12:43] okay
[2:12:45] then we moved to tennessee and i started
[2:12:47] having memories my dad was pastor at 21
[2:12:50] i believe to 24 he was a pastor
[2:12:53] and he
[2:12:54] got a church the minister had taken all
[2:12:56] the tithes and offerings in the message
[2:12:58] okay
[2:13:00] and left the church with nothing
[2:13:02] after dad started traveling from indiana
[2:13:05] and he started doing that work for a
[2:13:06] little bit on his own i don't remember
[2:13:08] that but then i do remember going to
[2:13:10] tennessee
[2:13:12] living there for three years doing um
[2:13:14] up till so i would have been like two to
[2:13:16] four ish almost five
[2:13:19] went there
[2:13:20] and dad was a pastor at 21 young man
[2:13:23] i want to say for that young men can be
[2:13:26] pastors
[2:13:27] in the
[2:13:28] message
[2:13:30] any minister that says you can't do it
[2:13:32] is not of god
[2:13:34] it's not god in that man telling you you
[2:13:36] need to wait 10 years to show yourself
[2:13:38] approved no find a good pastor like i
[2:13:42] did sit under that master
[2:13:44] my dad was my pastor then we moved to
[2:13:46] ron peterson's in 1997. we were there
[2:13:49] for three years dad was an associate
[2:13:51] minister to brother braun existing so
[2:13:54] you're looking
[2:13:55] this kind of goes in hand with my dad
[2:13:57] okay
[2:13:59] when he is in 2000 february march he
[2:14:02] felt called to come back to brother
[2:14:04] biscuits because of the vision that he
[2:14:06] had to get the gospel out
[2:14:08] okay
[2:14:10] you guys ever want to see why tim anders
[2:14:12] is standing here today because of
[2:14:13] decisions that were made
[2:14:16] the choice you make brother matthew for
[2:14:17] your wife and kids will affect you in
[2:14:20] five years
[2:14:21] ten years so what you're doing today
[2:14:23] brother timothy with your wife is going
[2:14:25] to affect you guys in five years from
[2:14:27] now if the lord tarries
[2:14:30] okay
[2:14:31] as we grew up
[2:14:33] we went on vacations
[2:14:35] we spent time together as a family i'm
[2:14:37] just saying this for a reason help
[2:14:39] somebody
[2:14:41] my dad never had money to his name
[2:14:44] never
[2:14:45] i didn't know the financials until one
[2:14:47] day when we were um
[2:14:49] growing up my
[2:14:51] had done after all he was doing some
[2:14:53] real estate with some believers in the
[2:14:54] church trying to you know make it make
[2:14:56] ends meet
[2:14:58] making twenty four thousand dollars i'm
[2:14:59] being open and honest twenty to thirty
[2:15:01] thousand dollars he was doing night
[2:15:03] and then trying to pitch a little bit
[2:15:05] from two to thousand 2003 ish or so
[2:15:08] three years he had a call and felt
[2:15:11] brother biscuit to tell brother biscuit
[2:15:13] i want to have a ministry and be able to
[2:15:14] help more in the church is that possible
[2:15:16] and that happened to be then when the
[2:15:19] biscuit felt there was a need and he had
[2:15:21] my dad at a young age 30 years old or so
[2:15:24] had him helping the church because
[2:15:26] brother bischool realized if the church
[2:15:28] is going to grow he's going to need
[2:15:30] other men in the church right brother
[2:15:31] dale you can't be a one-man ministry
[2:15:34] so then brother john andes my father
[2:15:36] and was doing that i as a young boy went
[2:15:39] to bca
[2:15:41] which is a christian school okay
[2:15:43] we could
[2:15:44] that and i'm not going to say who but
[2:15:46] somebody paid for us to go to see from
[2:15:49] grade one all the way till i went to
[2:15:51] grade nine my dad couldn't afford it
[2:16:00] is the man
[2:16:02] that coming against the message
[2:16:11] and then for years when he left then
[2:16:13] there was a couple where dad didn't know
[2:16:15] what was going to happen because he
[2:16:16] stopped giving to go to bca and then the
[2:16:19] pastor
[2:16:20] paid
[2:16:21] for us to go there
[2:16:25] i'll be open and honest
[2:16:27] because the pastor saw and deposited
[2:16:29] eternal deposits in
[2:16:32] then when i went and decided to go to
[2:16:34] college in 11th grade
[2:16:37] i'd be ready
[2:16:39] was it easy no during that time as soon
[2:16:41] as i went to college this is my
[2:16:43] testimony i noticed a spiritual lack in
[2:16:46] my life
[2:16:47] in the message in the right home
[2:16:49] i got a car though i felt free
[2:16:53] sorry if that was too loud
[2:16:56] free this is my testimony
[2:16:58] i felt free i felt happy
[2:17:01] because now i had my own car i could go
[2:17:03] to school i all day my dad though he
[2:17:06] wasn't restrictive he left what we want
[2:17:07] to do i think every day for my dad
[2:17:10] but
[2:17:11] i talked to him
[2:17:12] maybe sometimes and he said to forgive
[2:17:14] he asked for forgiveness if he was too
[2:17:17] loose
[2:17:19] and i said dad don't ask for forgiveness
[2:17:21] about that
[2:17:22] but but i i made the choice i was 16.
[2:17:26] but i'm just helping somebody to know
[2:17:28] how my father was to me so maybe it'll
[2:17:30] help you treat your child a certain way
[2:17:31] my dad was not a micro manager
[2:17:34] what are they doing where are they um um
[2:17:37] how long have you been on your
[2:17:40] my dad never did
[2:17:44] and by the grace of god he said now
[2:17:46] you're a man you're 16 you're going to
[2:17:48] college my brother was 13 years old when
[2:17:50] he started going to college with me
[2:17:53] we both got our two-year
[2:17:54] associate 18 years old he got his mba at
[2:17:58] 17 or 18 and i went on to be a teacher
[2:18:01] failed
[2:18:04] this is going to help you kids okay but
[2:18:06] tim failed a psychology class three
[2:18:09] times to get into the teaching program

[2:18:24] at bca
[2:18:26] and i'm not a teacher anymore do i
[2:18:28] regret be getting my teaching degree
[2:18:31] no
[2:18:32] this is my testimony
[2:18:34] god just kept kept me
[2:18:36] and then because i was a teacher there
[2:18:38] became a stress in my i'm just going to
[2:18:40] be open and honest
[2:18:42] there became a stress in my life
[2:18:45] of finance

[2:19:18] washington state that is over two
[2:19:20] hundred and fifty percent poverty level

[2:19:31] conversation but it did not happen and i
[2:19:34] stressed out

[2:19:42] and i could have lost my family
[2:19:45] by the grace of god amazing grace
[2:19:48] jesus christ said no you're my son
[2:19:53] he gave me a wife that could have walked
[2:19:54] out on me
[2:20:00] that's what i believe that's the message
[2:20:02] i believe that will let your wife stay
[2:20:04] with you when it gets rough
[2:20:07] not compromise and give up on you and
[2:20:10] say i don't even know you because you're

[2:20:21] this i want a car stressing out your
[2:20:23] husband

[2:20:30] was trying to serve people you know what
[2:20:32] i didn't realize brother dale i was
[2:20:34] sacrificing my family
[2:20:38] that sacrifice i'm not talking about
[2:20:39] behind a pulpit if you sacrifice for
[2:20:41] your church or you sacrifice in anything
[2:20:44] and you sacrifice your family you've
[2:20:47] lost everything
[2:20:51] don't give thousands and thousands of
[2:20:53] dollars to a church if you don't have a
[2:20:55] dollar to your name and you got debt
[2:21:00] this is my testimony
[2:21:03] okay i'm going to say something i've
[2:21:04] never said this publicly i miss
[2:21:07] wedding because i was in a hospital
[2:21:17] no one knows that
[2:21:21] i miss my own sister's wedding
[2:21:26] i was supposed to be the best man at
[2:21:28] that way
[2:21:39] and i just had to be
[2:21:42] in the mental ward
[2:21:46] they didn't find nothing wrong with me
[2:21:50] because it wasn't a physical problem
[2:21:53] it was a spiritual imbalance that had
[2:21:55] happened in my life
[2:21:58] i got my priorities out of line
[2:22:03] i've never said that i miss my own
[2:22:06] sister's wedding
[2:22:10] i came out and i had to borrow money
[2:22:12] from my brother
[2:22:14] i didn't have a job for six months
[2:22:20] how do you think i felt brother matthew
[2:22:22] how would you feel
[2:22:25] pretty low
[2:22:28] and in that moment
[2:22:30] satan came
[2:22:31] curse god
[2:22:34] curse this message
[2:22:37] and i'm here as a testimony to say i'll
[2:22:39] never curse malachi 4.
[2:22:42] the message is true
[2:22:47] but that's what i've gone through you
[2:22:50] say i've got it hard i know i've had it
[2:22:52] hard but someone's had it harder
[2:22:54] you know hardest the next thing that
[2:22:56] happened after i came out of that mental
[2:22:57] institution was i had to go to doctors
[2:23:03] with my wife who's a nurse
[2:23:05] and i didn't want to go
[2:23:16] they gave us ten of these
[2:23:20] ten
[2:23:22] they said you need to take all these
[2:23:24] different kinds
[2:23:28] sums up something's wrong with you
[2:23:31] and i'm trying to sit there and tell
[2:23:32] them yeah i know something's wrong i'm
[2:23:34] not right where i had to be with god and
[2:23:35] they're thinking
[2:23:39] because they're using science so in
[2:23:41] their science was like oh no you have
[2:23:43] bipolar devil
[2:23:46] i don't have bipolar
[2:23:49] in the name of jesus tim anders has been
[2:23:50] delivered of any spirit of bipolar but

[2:28:58] driving thing i made maybe 50 grand
[2:29:02] which is not terrible it's way better
[2:29:04] than what i was making right
[2:29:05] what i'm saying but i'm saying this all
[2:29:07] for a reason
[2:29:09] only forty fifty thousand dollars first
[2:29:11] year okay but i continued to have
[2:29:13] patience and the next year i said mike
[2:29:15] let's get two more bucks and i want to
[2:29:17] buy the business
[2:29:19] the grace of god i was able to get a
[2:29:21] loan that got me the business
[2:29:23] okay
[2:29:24] so then the next year it's my business
[2:29:26] now and now i'm going to do what god
[2:29:28] wants me to he said hire four or five
[2:29:30] people this is what god told me to do
[2:29:32] hire five people did this
[2:29:35] and we had the amazing couple of months
[2:29:37] brother dale
[2:29:38] we've ever i've ever experienced
[2:29:40] forty thousand a month i was like oh my
[2:29:42] goodness gonna be a great year but
[2:29:44] we're gonna do so much for god i
[2:29:47] did i thought i was gonna be out of the
[2:29:48] field in 2021 and guess what happened
[2:29:51] i went one weekend
[2:29:53] away to preach at brother brad burgess's
[2:29:56] in kentucky
[2:29:58] and you know what i said brother dale
[2:30:00] i said
[2:30:01] the devil
[2:30:04] when i get back
[2:30:06] and i have to go
[2:30:07] this was one person i'll still serve god
[2:30:11] guess what happened when i got back
[2:30:14] i tested my faith
[2:30:17] does jesus care for me
[2:30:19] yes did he know it was best brother
[2:30:21] jared for me
[2:30:24] so i went back i lost the main guy he
[2:30:27] walked off the job
[2:30:29] another guy the third guy quit because
[2:30:32] he was smoking marijuana and the fourth
[2:30:34] girl said i'm done in november i was
[2:30:37] literally gonna be back by myself
[2:30:40] in three months
[2:30:42] right what i had preached
[2:30:44] the devil
[2:30:45] was testing me sister brother matthew
[2:30:48] the devil will test your faith
[2:30:50] the devil has
[2:30:52] faith hasn't even taken our faith very
[2:30:54] good
[2:30:55] why
[2:30:56] faith mom
[2:30:57] dad why is he testing you to see what
[2:31:00] kind of character you have
[2:31:02] are you going to pass the test felix
[2:31:05] the test is not math 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[2:31:08] 3 times 3 is 9. a plus b equals a
[2:31:12] squared b squared who cares
[2:31:15] i mean i'm a teacher
[2:31:17] my kid does not need to know something
[2:31:19] about some guy that was born 1200 years
[2:31:21] ago it's a historical fact it is
[2:31:24] important but make it relevant for the
[2:31:27] day we can learn about george muller and
[2:31:29] what he did and let's make it real
[2:31:32] today
[2:31:33] right
[2:31:34] about
[2:31:35] william branham historical fact
[2:31:39] he was a healer
[2:31:40] jesus christ was the healer through him
[2:31:43] every
[2:31:44] this in denominations that god glorified
[2:31:47] in william branham's life
[2:31:49] therefore anyone that tears down the
[2:31:50] message preached by william branham or
[2:31:53] his character is antichrist because he
[2:31:56] glorified jesus christ
[2:32:00] say amen
[2:32:03] what do you believe
[2:32:06] oh i believe that pills are bad for you
[2:32:16] and i still know i don't need this
[2:32:20] but if i can take
[2:32:22] l a m o t r i g i n e
[2:32:28] lam i can't even pronounce this lamo
[2:32:30] trigin
[2:32:32] 25 milligram tablet
[2:32:34] which is the minimum okay 25 milligrams
[2:32:37] the guy said he could put me on 500. if
[2:32:39] i can take one of those a day
[2:32:41] and my wife and everyone knows i'm
[2:32:43] paying stable and stuff i'll do it i
[2:32:45] have no side effects whatsoever brother
[2:32:47] matthew
[2:32:48] from this
[2:32:50] now this one i have for a reason
[2:32:53] this one is called a sleeping pill
[2:32:55] anyone ever taken a sleeping pill before
[2:32:59] oh praise the lord we have some people
[2:33:00] that have never taken sleeping pills
[2:33:03] good
[2:33:04] my mom was very much against pills she
[2:33:07] was actually on my side when all this
[2:33:08] went down and she's like jessica he
[2:33:11] really shouldn't be taking pills he
[2:33:12] needs to get off the pills thanks mom if
[2:33:14] you're listening
[2:33:17] lorazepam
[2:33:18] okay it's lowest dose
[2:33:20] okay but when i take this if i need it
[2:33:23] for sleep it says as needed i have not
[2:33:25] taken this in six months
[2:33:27] boo devil
[2:33:29] and you know what i really want to do is
[2:33:30] take these pills and flush them down the
[2:33:33] toilet
[2:33:36] but i'll let them sit in the counter
[2:33:37] just to remind say
[2:33:43] a preacher service and have them all
[2:33:44] lined up and we're gonna go
[2:33:48] devil because he thought he had me he
[2:33:50] thought a pit
[2:33:51] and it wasn't a pill that seemed it was
[2:33:54] the gospel
[2:33:57] i needed to realize my finances aren't
[2:33:59] important
[2:34:01] they shouldn't be preeminent in my
[2:34:03] thoughts
[2:34:04] come on saints you got to be with me now

[2:35:24] reason whole wedding was three thousand
[2:35:26] dollars because all the believers
[2:35:27] brought some food brother this self says
[2:35:30] publicly that is a model wedding for a
[2:35:33] believer in the message to have
[2:35:35] [Applause]
[2:35:36] which i take very much humility and
[2:35:38] thanks that brother biscuit would say
[2:35:40] that um he would take that and note we
[2:35:42] had it outside brother dale it wasn't in
[2:35:45] a church
[2:35:47] what you're breaking all codes man i'm
[2:35:50] breaking all codes right now
[2:35:52] no tie no suit and i can preach the
[2:35:54] gospel on a sunday morning
[2:35:56] i'm breaking on your denominational
[2:35:58] ideas that are
[2:36:00] but i don't need ibuprofen anymore in
[2:36:03] jesus name i don't need to take this
[2:36:05] anymore
[2:36:10] stop taking it
[2:36:12] because i'm not going to let this ruin
[2:36:13] my marriage
[2:36:16] do you understand
[2:36:18] my my wife has the holy ghost
[2:36:20] she can
[2:36:23] tell you when you're out of step
[2:36:26] because she has the holy ghost if she's
[2:36:28] telling you you're going what are you
[2:36:29] doing that's good
[2:36:31] that's a good thing you have a good wife
[2:36:32] for the jury that stops you on the back
[2:36:34] and says what do you do
[2:36:37] giving way too much money and you can't
[2:36:39] even take me out for coffee
[2:36:41] [Laughter]
[2:36:45] so when a wife starts slapping you back
[2:36:48] you're supposed to say thank you for
[2:36:50] needing to do this more i'm preaching
[2:36:51] myself
[2:36:53] i need to say you know what you're right
[2:36:56] how many are thankful that we have a
[2:36:57] message
[2:36:58] this is my testimony today
[2:37:00] three children that
[2:37:03] have three that will be in heaven i
[2:37:07] i have six kids over there
[2:37:09] so tell me i need more kids because i
[2:37:11] don't because well brother you're
[2:37:13] supposed to have a big
[2:37:15] what is it called a bunch of uh clip
[2:37:18] yeah quiver full you know that message
[2:37:21] right
[2:37:22] brother you should never take birth
[2:37:24] control
[2:37:27] oh
[2:37:28] bondage
[2:37:29] you've bound young family and a couple
[2:37:32] and they go to one sister and it's it's
[2:37:34] okay and the other sister saying oh no
[2:37:36] if you do that you're anti-bible
[2:37:39] you've got two opinions of two people in
[2:37:41] a church and now that sister that's just
[2:37:43] gotten married and wants some counsel a
[2:37:44] godly counsel is confused
[2:37:47] what's he going to turn to brother dale
[2:37:49] the internet
[2:37:53] and the internet becomes people's bible
[2:37:55] the internet becomes their absolute and
[2:37:57] the last five minutes i want to anchor
[2:37:59] down what i believe i believe the bible
[2:38:01] from genesis to revelations who believes
[2:38:03] it with me
[2:38:05] i
[2:38:06] mess that god sent a prophet how many
[2:38:08] believe that with me
[2:38:10] and this is what i believe it produces a
[2:38:13] life that cannot be argued with
[2:38:18] do you believe it
[2:38:20] then i am fulfilling scripture today
[2:38:25] we just read six verses
[2:38:27] in malachi
[2:38:28] i can see in those six verses who the
[2:38:31] prophet is and who i am
[2:38:33] where i am and where i don't want to be
[2:38:36] now when you read your body you define
[2:38:38] where you are brother dale
[2:38:40] where this sister in the back little boy
[2:38:42] in the back
[2:38:46] what's up brother
[2:38:47] how you doing
[2:38:48] would you ever want to play this in the
[2:38:50] church
[2:38:51] maybe one day
[2:38:53] there's a reason why i just did that it
[2:38:55] totally changes a person's attention and
[2:38:56] focus and now they're focused on
[2:38:58] i'm going to say something really
[2:38:59] important buddy
[2:39:01] when you get a little bit older read
[2:39:02] this
[2:39:03] proven his god-divided place of worship
[2:39:06] i'm not ashamed you've got a service
[2:39:08] without it being his will
[2:39:10] and if you can't read it listen to it
[2:39:14] if you don't know how to read listen
[2:39:17] spiritual food in due season
[2:39:20] what is track
[2:39:23] the god of this evil age
[2:39:26] people read all sorts of books i was
[2:39:28] telling brother dave
[2:39:30] do two hours of studying for every
[2:39:32] credit you do in college that's what
[2:39:33] they they say you should do that means
[2:39:35] if you do 15 class 15 credits 15 hours
[2:39:39] of learning that you need to do 45 hours
[2:39:42] of studying minimum
[2:39:45] outside of school
[2:39:47] do you know what they just did
[2:39:49] they made you have a 60 hour work week
[2:39:51] and you make zero dollars and by the way
[2:39:52] you pay money for it
[2:39:55] right by the deal
[2:39:58] if you read these three four five six
[2:40:00] praise the lord seven messages
[2:40:03] and read them for 45 hours
[2:40:06] in a week
[2:40:08] what do you think would happen
[2:40:10] you would not come in here
[2:40:12] depressed
[2:40:14] down
[2:40:16] i
[2:40:17] am
[2:40:18] life is so miserable i don't have a
[2:40:20] husband and i'm 21.
[2:40:24] really
[2:40:25] just because whether tim got married at
[2:40:27] 20 doesn't mean you got to get married
[2:40:29] at 20.
[2:40:30] my wife is 22 i mean every the message
[2:40:33] needs to be 22 or 23.
[2:40:36] okay god has a correct spouse the right
[2:40:39] guy
[2:40:40] the serpent
[2:40:42] every girl every girl will have a
[2:40:44] serpent before adam
[2:40:47] every girl
[2:40:49] she will
[2:40:50] you better not accept the serpent you
[2:40:52] say no to the serpent and then adam will
[2:40:53] come
[2:40:54] but you must believe i am eve but i'm
[2:40:56] not deceived
[2:40:58] you must believe i am rebecca going to
[2:41:00] see my unseen bridegroom how many
[2:41:02] believers do we have this is what i
[2:41:03] believe
[2:41:04] god's working on our heart now i believe
[2:41:06] jesus christ saves amen
[2:41:08] how many to believe jesus christ is the
[2:41:10] resurrection the truth and the life and
[2:41:12] what he has done on calvary is enough
[2:41:15] it's enough for my family it's all i
[2:41:17] need
[2:41:18] i don't need money i don't need
[2:41:20] popularity
[2:41:21] women i've got my one wife i don't need
[2:41:24] two i don't need four god help me if i
[2:41:27] had two i have double the
[2:41:30] i'd have to have a big vehicle
[2:41:32] the two girls say something wouldn't be
[2:41:35] able to live in the same home
[2:41:37] because they got two different opinions
[2:41:39] of how to run the home
[2:41:40] two different ways of how to cook two
[2:41:42] different ways of the kind of oven they
[2:41:44] want two different ways of the kind of
[2:41:46] house they want i don't like the paint
[2:41:48] this why would you marry two people
[2:41:50] seriously you've got one man
[2:41:53] you you've got one sister for you
[2:41:57] you do all you can for her just
[2:42:00] don't use this to make her happy
[2:42:03] i'll say it again don't give her this to
[2:42:06] try and make her happy
[2:42:08] so now coming on the sisters you
[2:42:10] overspend
[2:42:14] you want your husband to not work 50 60
[2:42:17] hours a week you need to lay this aside
[2:42:19] for one or two weeks and your total
[2:42:20] budget will change and you will not
[2:42:22] spend for one week when me and my wife
[2:42:25] yeah
[2:42:27] we need to go back to this she'll
[2:42:29] probably listen babe
[2:42:32] when we were younger
[2:42:34] a week this is what we did for a whole
[2:42:36] week one week a month we would not go
[2:42:39] out to eat
[2:42:40] at all
[2:42:41] okay
[2:42:42] do that for a while and realize you know
[2:42:44] what we only need to go out two times a
[2:42:46] week this is only we didn't have kids so
[2:42:48] we went two times a month okay
[2:42:50] then after my low time the first time
[2:42:53] when i had stress in my life and i went
[2:42:54] through that med board thing and stuff
[2:42:58] my testimony is
[2:43:00] we didn't go out for a whole month to
[2:43:02] try and save money
[2:43:04] so we're on a plan
[2:43:06] a budget is a plan for your family for a
[2:43:08] family to be able to know they're going
[2:43:11] so then my wife i said if you save money
[2:43:14] in groceries in these areas of clothing
[2:43:17] and other areas that will help take
[2:43:18] stress off of me
[2:43:20] what do you think my wife did
[2:43:24] stop spending
[2:43:27] okay and all the money every month that
[2:43:29] was saved by the deal went into a
[2:43:31] savings account for a vacation
[2:43:33] down the road
[2:43:35] an incentive for your wife to spend
[2:43:37] money
[2:43:40] i didn't say don't give her any credit
[2:43:42] cards don't let her
[2:43:43] oh you got to have trust
[2:43:46] so you
[2:43:46] five dollars for clothing i'm sorry

[2:47:25] the whole prophet's message is to turn
[2:47:27] our hearts back to christ
[2:47:30] the whole message was sent to point us
[2:47:32] to him and to recognize and realize a
[2:47:35] need for him with our heads bowed and
[2:47:36] our eyes closed
[2:47:38] i want you to think about the goodness
[2:47:40] of god
[2:47:43] i want you to bind your heart with your
[2:47:44] spouse if you're able to hold hands or
[2:47:47] if you're able if she's out of the room
[2:47:48] that's fine
[2:47:50] but just pray for her think about her
[2:47:51] right now
[2:47:52] if your spouse isn't here maybe he
[2:47:54] passed away or she passed away
[2:47:57] i still want you to think about
[2:47:59] the goodness of god

[2:48:50] when we're going through and we're upset
[2:48:52] we squeeze each other's hands three
[2:48:53] times and in that it means i
[2:48:56] love
[2:48:57] you
[2:48:59] and we can be upset at each other we can
[2:49:01] be mad at each other we don't agree all
[2:49:03] the time but we squeeze each other's
[2:49:05] hands three times
[2:49:06] i
[2:49:07] love
[2:49:08] you
[2:49:13] and it's like
[2:49:14] boom devil you tried to make us
[2:49:18] tried to bring upsetness in the home a
[2:49:20] confusion in the home and those three
[2:49:22] squeezes
[2:49:23] oh

[2:49:28] that doesn't have a
[2:49:30] young boy on the drums here that jesus
[2:49:32] would come down and squeeze your hand
[2:49:34] three times and say i love

[2:49:42] doesn't believe jesus is squeezing your
[2:49:45] hand and saying i love you
[2:49:58] leave a service we should not run out in
[2:50:00] haste

[2:50:03] for what god has spoken
[2:50:05] and if there's anything in my life oh
[2:50:07] god i'm praying

[2:51:08] mind i pray in the name of jesus that
[2:51:11] these two services

[2:51:17] miraculous the supernatural would prove
[2:51:20] to a young person that they need jesus
