[41:28] you know I I can't do it
[41:32] amen amen we all had different gifts and
[41:36] those gifts were given by God
[41:38] for the worship in the body amen given
[41:42] from birth
[41:44] amen it wouldn't matter what you spent
[41:45] on me I couldn't play like that
[41:48] yeah amen
[41:50] just some things aren't possible amen
[41:53] we just uh just remember our prayer
[41:55] requests imagine just welcome and we're
[41:57] so happy to be here I pray that we'll
[42:00] have some spiritual stake first and then
[42:02] we're going to have some physical stake
[42:04] after and and these steak will be the
[42:07] best
[42:07] but the spiritual ones and just an honor
[42:11] to be here and and we sure love and
[42:14] appreciate you all you know just uh a
[42:17] few prayer requests that you can
[42:18] remember and your ways also it's Tim man
[42:22] you know how God the Bible says the
[42:24] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[42:25] of the Lord it you know we don't believe
[42:28] in perchance or flukes or Miss uh you
[42:31] know good luck or all that stuff is just
[42:34] of the double man we sometimes we slip
[42:36] and we say things that you know we don't
[42:38] even believe you know like good luck
[42:40] what's that mean
[42:42] good what
[42:43] amen but Tim just randomly thought that
[42:46] he needed a new pair of glasses and quit
[42:48] using Vicky's all the time and they
[42:50] wouldn't have to fight when they were
[42:51] sharing glasses and so when he went in
[42:54] he had two holes in his eyes
[42:56] and all this water can drain out of his
[42:57] eye and let the retina would separate
[43:00] and he would be still blind
[43:02] so they're doing surgery like literally
[43:04] when in Canada when they do surgery in
[43:06] six days it's an emergency
[43:09] but they're doing surgery on us by
[43:12] Thursday so of course we remember that
[43:15] and we don't believe we know for a fact
[43:17] it's not God's will that Tim would be
[43:19] blind in one eye it's just Satan trying
[43:22] to if he can't get the spiritual blind
[43:24] he'll try and take your physical sight
[43:26] it's just you don't have no teeth Tim
[43:28] he's just gumming you to death and just
[43:31] smack him in the nose and send them on
[43:34] his way amen it's it's just that simple
[43:36] I mean I don't I hate to be so plain but
[43:38] I mean it's just the way it is he'll try
[43:41] you spiritually you try you physically
[43:42] he'll try you different ways but you
[43:44] just recognize who he is and you say hi
[43:47] he's I seen you come at me last month
[43:49] and you know you can go back to where
[43:53] you're going to be amen
[43:54] amen and also we only remember and just
[43:57] because of the video I I God's helping
[44:00] me to not mention names because
[44:02] sometimes
[44:04] we have to eat what we say and uh but
[44:08] there's a there's a local Message Church
[44:10] in Ontario
[44:14] that
[44:25] that I love
[44:29] I love
[44:30] and uh
[44:32] they're having a hard time
[44:35] amen
[44:37] and
[44:39] I'm sorry
[44:45] and so we're just remembered them
[44:49] man just uh I'm sorry God made me that
[44:51] way
[44:52] I'd pay a million dollars if I didn't
[44:55] cry when I wanted to say something but
[44:57] that wouldn't fix nothing either so
[45:00] but uh they pay very high rent very very
[45:04] hybrid
[45:06] and they're getting kicked out because
[45:08] they make too much noise
[45:10] you know you know this world
[45:12] you know they're looking for something
[45:15] real amen and Satan is an imitator you
[45:18] know and so when they have rock and roll
[45:20] concerts and all this stuff and uh you
[45:23] know bootlegging that that's not you
[45:25] know nobody would complain

[47:22] I was
[47:23] just sit and talk to brother Emmanuel
[47:26] and he said
[47:27] he said that one message is exactly what
[47:30] I'm preaching next week

[47:35] know brother Joseph came and preached I
[47:36] could tell you and Luanne went to the
[47:38] restaurant I I have never I'd have never

[47:42] we met and went out for supper Saturday
[47:44] night I never spoke a single word in
[47:46] what we'd preached in this church
[47:48] and he come in and you would have
[47:49] thought he was listening to the video
[47:50] preaching almost word for word
[47:54] and we never spoke a single word on it
[47:56] amen amen God so we serve an awesome God
[48:00] we really serve an awesome God so amen
[48:03] so anyway sorry for that uh but just
[48:06] remember these needs and brother Tim and
[48:08] the local church so they're looking for
[48:10] a place they're moving so the next six
[48:12] weeks

[48:26] in a talk invoice with no Amplified mics
[48:28] and they're moving the end of August but
[48:31] they don't know where to
[48:33] so we pray that God would just uh
[48:35] hey man do just something Supernatural
[48:38] and when it comes we'll know it was God
[48:40] let's stand and read his word amen and I
[48:43] just encourage you moms and even Julie's
[48:46] out I promise you your kids don't bother
[48:49] me I'd rather them be sitting in here
[48:51] moving than where I couldn't see you
[48:54] amen it does doesn't affect me I'm not a
[48:57] minister that's affected by kids
[48:59] uh and uh
[49:02] maybe some are but this is not one amen
[49:05] I mean I'm sure I'm not going to get
[49:07] done today and I I uh I promise I'm not
[49:10] going to hurry because uh I believe
[49:12] God's got something for us to see and uh
[49:16] and I I told sister the man I said you
[49:20] know
[49:21] I I
[49:25] this topic will be misunderstood
[49:28] they'll be misunderstood and I and a
[49:31] minister knows that ahead of time and so
[49:33] it makes them nervous
[49:35] you know but uh
[49:38] but it's all right
[49:40] it's all right you know God was
[49:42] misunderstood Jesus was misunderstood
[49:45] and uh but we need to lay the chips down
[49:47] because we're going home soon
[49:49] and uh and uh you know uh
[49:52] well let's let's read a scripture you
[49:54] know
[49:55] amen
[49:58] Matthew 24 24.
[50:17] amen
[50:19] then we're going to read to Matthew
[50:20] we're going to go to Matthew 7. just one
[50:22] verse here
[50:23] for there shall rise false Christ and
[50:25] false prophets and they shall show great
[50:27] signs and wonders and so much that if it
[50:30] were possible they would deceive
[50:33] be very elect amen and let's go to 28
[50:37] verse 28.
[50:39] verse 28 of 24 but for wheresoever the
[50:43] carcasses
[50:46] there the Eagles will be gathered
[50:49] Hallelujah
[50:51] Hallelujah let's turn to Matthew 7 if
[50:53] you would just before you see to Matthew
[50:55] 7 and 15.
[50:56] we're going to read a few scriptures
[50:58] here 15 to 21.
[51:01] try to lay a foundation and like I said
[51:03] there's just you know I just a lot of
[51:06] stuff here and I want to read some
[51:08] things that our Prophet said and
[51:10] to lay a foundation
[51:13] beware of false prophets which come to
[51:16] you and sheep's clothing but inwardly
[51:18] they are raging wolves
[51:21] and he shall know them by their fruits
[51:24] do men gather Grapes of thorns
[51:27] or figs of thistles
[51:29] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[51:32] good fruit but a corrupt fruit tree
[51:34] bringeth forth evil fruit
[51:37] Verse 18 and a good tree cannot bring
[51:39] forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt
[51:41] tree bring forth good fruit
[51:48] every tree bringeth forth not
[51:52] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[51:54] fruit is chewed down and cast
[51:58] Into the Fire
[52:00] therefore by their fruits
[52:04] you shall know them not what they say
[52:07] don't listen to what the person says
[52:10] don't even listen to what I say
[52:15] I mean you can
[52:17] but watch their life the prophet said
[52:19] Don't Preach me a message
[52:21] live me one
[52:24] words are cheap
[52:27] character is hard
[52:29] therefore by the fruit she shall know
[52:31] them 21 not everyone that saith unto me
[52:35] Lord Lord
[52:37] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[52:39] but he that doeth the will of my father
[52:43] which is in heaven Lord Jesus we ask you
[52:45] to bless this word and bless the speaker
[52:47] in the here Lord Jesus in your name we
[52:50] pray
[52:50] amen you may have your seats and maybe
[52:53] we'll turn to Matthew 5 and just lay
[52:55] more of a foundation here right away in
[52:58] Matthew 5 44 and 45 but I say unto you
[53:02] love your enemies and bless them that
[53:05] curse you and do good to them that hate
[53:08] you
[53:08] and pray for them that despitefully use
[53:12] you and persecute you
[53:14] that ye may be
[53:16] the children of your father now now
[53:19] there's there's the proof
[53:22] amen
[53:24] that you may be the children of your
[53:26] father which are in heaven for he maketh
[53:28] his son
[53:30] as you and the son
[53:33] to rise on evil and good
[53:37] and he sendeth the rain
[53:40] on the just
[53:42] and the unjust
[53:45] amen Our God's a fair God
[53:49] Our God's a fair God
[53:51] Hallelujah
[53:54] Hallelujah
[53:55] amen we want to look into these
[53:58] scriptures and we're going to dovetail
[54:00] it with the our Prophet this morning but
[54:03] I want to tell you something when you
[54:04] preach on this topic or when I preach on
[54:06] this topic for sure
[54:08] I will be considered a radical
[54:14] now you think that I will just be
[54:17] considered a radical I'm afraid I'll be
[54:19] considered a radical among you
[54:21] but you are considered a radical
[54:25] in this town
[54:27] you are considered a radical
[54:31] maybe in your family if they're not
[54:33] message believers
[54:35] and everybody's considered a radical
[54:40] if they came from God
[54:45] Christ Jesus was considered a radical
[54:50] radical
[54:52] you know the word of God and and just so
[54:55] many things you could say you know
[55:02] I'm happy to be a radical
[55:06] not rude not rude by radical yeah I'm
[55:10] happy to be radical
[55:12] and I'm praying that God will make me
[55:14] more radical
[55:18] not rude
[55:20] but more radical
[55:21] you know in God's Vision he always had a
[55:24] difference than the Christians thought
[55:26] in the Bible
[55:28] the Believers in the Bible always were
[55:30] outside of God's vision
[55:32] almost always show me one prophet in the
[55:34] Bible that was perfect
[55:37] even they missed the prophet the vision
[55:41] I'm going to show you prophets that that
[55:43] screamed at other prophets tell them to
[55:45] why'd they do that
[55:47] because it was God
[55:49] they never caught the vision Joseph was
[55:50] one when he brought his children to be
[55:52] blessed he screamed down and said no
[55:57] and it was God that did it
[56:02] and many times we're sitting in church
[56:04] and we say no don't do that God
[56:08] I don't like that I don't like that
[56:10] person I don't like that decision I
[56:12] don't like that gift I don't want to go
[56:14] to that place I don't like that building
[56:19] I don't like
[56:20] I don't like what you're doing God
[56:23] I don't like my family I don't like my
[56:25] pastor I don't like I don't like the
[56:27] message I don't like it
[56:32] amen
[56:33] why it's because they're never seen
[56:35] God's vision
[56:37] God's Vision you ain't never going to go
[56:39] to Bible study Bible School Cemetery
[56:43] and understand God's vision
[56:45] man you ain't never going to understand
[56:48] and you can Minister your whole life
[56:51] and maybe not fully understand it and
[56:54] it's only by Amazing Grace
[56:56] and by an amazing Revelation the Flesh
[56:59] and Blood there is no fivefold Ministry
[57:02] that's going to get you to understand
[57:03] God's vision
[57:06] they could preach still they didn't have
[57:07] a voice
[57:08] they could be the most amazing top ten
[57:11] in the world
[57:13] but it'll be revelation
[57:15] and Amazing Grace
[57:17] there'll be Revelation and amazing
[57:19] neighbors that's why in message churches
[57:21] people are walking out after sitting in
[57:23] them for 40 years
[57:27] did they have good ministers preach them
[57:28] oh buddy
[57:32] no revelation
[57:36] amen
[57:38] and we're living in a world today this
[57:40] is where
[57:42] we are so radical
[57:44] if somebody just looks at me I just I
[57:48] don't like you
[57:49] I just I I don't I mean I hope that's
[57:52] not everybody
[57:54] it's because we're living in a world
[57:56] that's very
[57:57] tolerable oh
[58:02] oh
[58:03] I understand
[58:07] you had a hard life praise God
[58:12] a hard life
[58:14] you don't even know what heart is
[58:16] that amazes me in my very small brain
[58:21] that you know suicide in North America
[58:23] and the UK is like at raging Heights
[58:28] and you go to the poorest countries in
[58:31] the world
[58:36] where they have less than nothing
[58:40] and the zoo right suicide rate
[58:43] is almost zero
[58:50] when you get that one figured out
[58:52] let's talk
[58:56] you don't even know what hardship is
[59:00] our world is very tolerant
[59:03] and they're teaching it well they're not
[59:05] teaching your kids because we're
[59:06] converted but if your kids are in school
[59:08] they're teaching them to be tolerant
[59:11] understand every situation
[59:15] but God didn't understand every
[59:16] situation
[59:17] he only understood his word
[59:20] he understood one thing and that was his
[59:22] word
[59:23] and everything outside of that was the
[59:25] devil
[59:28] and we're looking at message people I
[59:30] can tell this is this is
[59:33] we're not going nowhere this morning
[59:34] this is going to be a while
[59:36] but we're looking at message churches
[59:39] you know I went to Message Church
[59:42] with somebody for years some of you
[59:44] sitting here this morning went to church
[59:46] with her for 20 years
[59:48] and I seen her online yesterday and she
[59:50] was at a gay pride parade
[59:53] yep kids painting on the tombstone are
[59:56] all painted up
[59:58] love brother Matt love oh
[1:00:01] you hurt my feelings bless God
[1:00:10] that's exactly what I did sister I was
[1:00:13] just like
[1:00:17] how in the world
[1:00:20] I'll tell you how in the world
[1:00:24] well number one it's called Satan
[1:00:26] but number one the prophet said that
[1:00:29] we've let down the bars
[1:00:31] and the goats have got in and in one
[1:00:34] place he said they ate all the Sheep
[1:00:36] food and the other places said the Sheep
[1:00:37] got out
[1:00:39] in multiple places he said we're trying
[1:00:41] to bring Hollywood into here
[1:00:43] if you're looking for a good preacher
[1:00:44] you get rid of me
[1:00:47] and if you're looking for a new building
[1:00:48] well I mean I don't know we've got to
[1:00:50] get Tim's iFix and then we'll make it
[1:00:52] look pretty or something
[1:00:55] what's that got to do with God
[1:00:58] God used a donkey to talk to a prophet
[1:01:02] the donkey was Stone bride
[1:01:05] and if it hadn't been for the donkey God
[1:01:07] would have killed the prophet
[1:01:11] maybe we need to listen to vote a donkey
[1:01:13] and
[1:01:14] see we have a we have a thought of God
[1:01:18] and God goes outside our box and we well
[1:01:20] we just write God off well you know
[1:01:22] inside my box
[1:01:27] you know we're only going to make it if
[1:01:29] we're
[1:01:31] came from God
[1:01:33] it'll be election
[1:01:34] you'll have to accept the election
[1:01:37] but only by election
[1:01:39] let me read you a quote to lay a
[1:01:41] foundation there's so many I was I put
[1:01:44] so many down brother Emmanuel and then
[1:01:47] we'll see I was typing in my iPad this
[1:01:48] morning and I came to church and I was
[1:01:51] remembering more examples in the Bible
[1:01:52] when I was here
[1:01:58] not everything that's religious
[1:02:01] and confesses this message
[1:02:04] will be in heaven
[1:02:07] a million miles from it
[1:02:10] a million miles
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:15] let me read you a quote to lay a
[1:02:17] foundation and I mean it's this quote I
[1:02:19] don't have up Vicky we're going to put
[1:02:21] some up on the screen this one I didn't
[1:02:23] add
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:36] you know the only way we can accept God
[1:02:38] is to have come from God
[1:02:40] but another way to say it is the only
[1:02:42] way you can accept the word
[1:02:45] is actually be the word that's what
[1:02:46] Joseph said last Sunday it was the
[1:02:48] greatest phrase I've heard you can't
[1:02:50] just you can't say well that was good
[1:02:52] preaching oh praise God no no you
[1:02:54] actually are the word it's the only way
[1:02:56] you can accept the word
[1:02:57] amen you become the word man this
[1:03:01] world's just gone completely insane I I
[1:03:04] don't know where I'm going this morning
[1:03:05] but but God doesn't
[1:03:07] I've seen a thing on Disneyland
[1:03:10] I tell you what parents
[1:03:12] our kids are all grown
[1:03:16] but don't show your kids Disneyland
[1:03:20] Nursery
[1:03:23] Disney I've seen the video from the guy
[1:03:25] that's the head of Disneyland
[1:03:27] it's on my phone
[1:03:30] they have set up Council things where
[1:03:31] you can go in and the counselor you'd
[1:03:33] change your sex
[1:03:35] their whole goal in all the movies now
[1:03:37] is tolerance
[1:03:40] and you you probably are a cat or
[1:03:43] you know calf or a woman or something
[1:03:46] different
[1:03:49] man really careful not to pay our ties
[1:03:51] to Satan
[1:03:54] by supporting Satan's kingdom amen God
[1:03:57] will hold you responsible because you're
[1:03:59] a steward of God's money
[1:04:01] that's like if you go to Starbucks
[1:04:03] you're supporting Satan's kingdom don't
[1:04:05] do it
[1:04:06] that's radical but it's the truth
[1:04:10] it's radical
[1:04:11] see let me let me show you this he said
[1:04:13] Kane
[1:04:15] Kane was not a non-believer now the
[1:04:18] prophet says different things you know
[1:04:19] let me lay a foundation here real quick
[1:04:24] excuse me boys I'm trying to be careful
[1:04:26] on my voice or I'd be a lot more radical
[1:04:30] there's other places where the Prophet
[1:04:32] will say different things where King was
[1:04:34] a non-believer but in this quote he
[1:04:36] talks about how King
[1:04:37] and let's just go with this for a second
[1:04:39] here
[1:04:40] he said Cain was not a non-believer Cain
[1:04:43] was a Believer and he said oh May the
[1:04:45] Holy Spirit now question quite quiet in
[1:04:47] us and get our added our attentions back
[1:04:51] to Genesis and live in this picture Cain
[1:04:54] was not a non-believer
[1:04:56] and this is a long quote but we need to
[1:04:58] hear this amen Cain was a believer
[1:05:03] Cain was a message believer
[1:05:06] in a big Message Church
[1:05:09] in Canada Earth Saints
[1:05:11] and if a Believer is all that God
[1:05:14] requires Oh I thought oh bless God I
[1:05:16] know this message I've been I was born
[1:05:19] here
[1:05:20] and if a Believer is all God requires
[1:05:23] then God was unjust for condemning gain
[1:05:26] and accepting other believers oh
[1:05:29] how in the world
[1:05:34] amen Cain was not a communist Cain was
[1:05:38] not an infidel Cain was a religious
[1:05:42] message believer I added the message
[1:05:43] part
[1:05:44] and notice he came to worship God and
[1:05:48] not only was he a Believer but he was a
[1:05:50] worshiper he was one of these
[1:05:53] people
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:57] not of a false cult
[1:06:01] but a worshiper of Jehovah God
[1:06:06] and our Prophet says
[1:06:08] let that soak in
[1:06:21] We Believe for far too long the people
[1:06:24] wearing the name tag message
[1:06:27] we're a brother and sister
[1:06:34] I know that's radical
[1:06:36] it might be less than church next Sunday
[1:06:39] but I'll still have God
[1:06:42] notice the worship prayer of God I've
[1:06:44] heard people say all you have to do is
[1:06:46] confess Jesus as the Son of God and be
[1:06:48] saved he said the devil's done the same
[1:06:50] thing and they're not saved you know
[1:06:51] that
[1:06:53] he said it takes more than that he said
[1:06:55] the devil said I know who you are the
[1:06:57] Son of God the Holy One of Israel
[1:07:01] wow
[1:07:03] he said Cain no he's repeating himself
[1:07:05] this is the same quote
[1:07:06] he said Cain was a Believer and
[1:07:08] acknowledged the Creator and not only
[1:07:10] that but he was a worshiper and now he
[1:07:13] goes in I'm going to skip some here he
[1:07:14] says I know he goes into the east side
[1:07:16] of the garden
[1:07:18] and uh he's talking about Cain and Abel
[1:07:21] and they were in the garden together
[1:07:23] work in the fields and he's and I just
[1:07:26] paraphrased some of that and he said now
[1:07:27] they were trying to worship God and Cain
[1:07:30] built himself an altar or a church and
[1:07:32] Abel built him one
[1:07:34] and Cain made a sacrifice and Abel made
[1:07:37] one and came down to worship and Abel
[1:07:39] did the same thing
[1:07:43] now if God only no this is a I'm reading
[1:07:46] word for word now if God only requires
[1:07:49] faith in God
[1:07:51] and a confession
[1:07:53] those are all good by the way we're
[1:07:56] going the right way
[1:07:59] but if God only requires faith in God
[1:08:01] and a confession and an altar and a
[1:08:03] church membership and a sacrifice and a
[1:08:06] membership of a loyal loyalty to a
[1:08:08] church and part of your money and your
[1:08:11] time in worship and your sincerity and
[1:08:14] that's all you believe then God was
[1:08:16] unjust
[1:08:18] do not accept Cain
[1:08:21] but I thought
[1:08:23] those were all good things
[1:08:27] I mean
[1:08:29] have faith have a confession
[1:08:32] I mean
[1:08:34] have a home Church believe the message
[1:08:37] man we're going the right way
[1:08:39] now this is where you're going to want
[1:08:40] to fight and shush in your seat belts
[1:08:43] you're going to want to fasten your seat
[1:08:44] belts because you know
[1:08:46] and I'm going to say this I'm saying
[1:08:49] this very blind I'm sorry you're here
[1:08:50] brother Emmanuel
[1:08:52] like a look out don't tell anybody but
[1:08:57] uh
[1:08:59] you know people will come and say you
[1:09:01] know you got to be balanced in the
[1:09:02] message
[1:09:05] what's that mean
[1:09:08] I'm not balanced I mean I got a bubble
[1:09:10] in the middle
[1:09:11] but when I lay down I don't lay flat
[1:09:16] balance the message
[1:09:19] what that means brother Matt is you know
[1:09:21] what it means compromise
[1:09:25] that's exactly what it means
[1:09:28] it means we can let a few things go
[1:09:30] now now I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you
[1:09:33] what the truth is that whether you
[1:09:35] believe it that's that that's entirely
[1:09:36] up to you and God but our prophet's
[1:09:39] quote book was the Bible
[1:09:41] and I believe for one second that every
[1:09:43] single word the prophet said was us
[1:09:45] saith the Lord or even correct
[1:09:48] but I do believe that thus saith the
[1:09:50] Lord is in the message
[1:09:52] and I believe that God sent the rev the
[1:09:55] the revealing of the Bible to that
[1:09:58] prophet and he revealed the 100 truth
[1:10:01] but whether he drove a Ford or a Chevy
[1:10:03] really means little to me or wore a big
[1:10:06] buck buckle and a cowboy hat
[1:10:10] oh
[1:10:13] are we still we're still somewhat
[1:10:15] together
[1:10:18] but there was things
[1:10:20] so so the prophet said this if you don't
[1:10:23] like this then you're not going to like
[1:10:24] the prophet and then I'm in good company
[1:10:26] so that's okay but the prophet said
[1:10:29] everything I say take back to the word
[1:10:36] and if when you do that now I'm not
[1:10:39] saying he was a word prophet
[1:10:41] if you can't even be saved without
[1:10:43] believing it
[1:10:45] okay well that's fairly radical
[1:10:49] but I'm saying the prophet had ah
[1:10:54] what's the right word ah like fleshly
[1:10:57] desires that had nothing to do with the
[1:11:00] word of God that is recorded you see
[1:11:03] what I mean like I'm trying to say this
[1:11:05] like like he wanted to live in the
[1:11:07] wilderness no God wouldn't let him you
[1:11:08] see what I mean like uh
[1:11:12] uh like many of the prophets ran out of
[1:11:13] God's will in the Bible
[1:11:15] when it got like famed it didn't rain
[1:11:17] and
[1:11:19] it was so somewhat together
[1:11:22] man
[1:11:23] but when people say
[1:11:25] when people say you got to be balanced
[1:11:28] on the message they're not meaning
[1:11:29] brother Matt that well
[1:11:33] uh they're not meaning that what we just
[1:11:35] described they're meaning we can
[1:11:37] compromise
[1:11:38] they're meaning like you know
[1:11:41] uh
[1:11:42] like there's I disagree on the prophet
[1:11:47] like he said you could cut your little
[1:11:48] girl's hair
[1:11:51] I don't believe you can
[1:11:55] no that's not a Halloween Health
[1:11:57] decision I'm just saying you see what I
[1:11:59] mean I'm not starting to cut my girls
[1:12:01] bangs because she's three
[1:12:03] because how am I going to explain to it
[1:12:05] when she's nine that she can't
[1:12:07] I'm just not going on those Waters
[1:12:10] hello
[1:12:12] if you do no problem
[1:12:18] but there's a lot of waters that have
[1:12:19] been muddy
[1:12:21] and it's turning into
[1:12:23] what I just said about people that some
[1:12:25] of you sitting here today went to church
[1:12:27] for for 20 years
[1:12:29] that's a fair amount of time
[1:12:31] and they're at the LGB 02 Cube taking
[1:12:34] their whole family
[1:12:38] and then he walked away
[1:12:41] you know the prophet preached against
[1:12:42] Christmas trees
[1:12:44] many churches many believe many
[1:12:46] ministers
[1:12:48] will have a message a Christmas tree in
[1:12:50] their charts and take pictures of their
[1:12:52] family in front of it and I'm just
[1:12:54] thinking
[1:12:58] uh
[1:13:01] why
[1:13:05] uh I'm like I mean we're not trying to
[1:13:08] grow the church in numbers praise God
[1:13:10] for that
[1:13:12] that's huge in the states
[1:13:14] I've had message Believers change charts
[1:13:17] and say praise God I feel a lot more
[1:13:19] brother Matt because I don't get
[1:13:21] preached against Christmas anymore
[1:13:25] so if you want to pick your pastor on
[1:13:29] somebody that don't tell you the church
[1:13:30] truth and lies to you
[1:13:33] change churches
[1:13:37] because I ain't getting up there and God
[1:13:39] Walk You by me and say you lied to them
[1:13:42] that ain't happening
[1:13:44] that ain't happening not not as long as
[1:13:46] I got a little sound mind up here that's
[1:13:49] not going to happen
[1:13:51] that's not going to happen
[1:13:53] I know you think well where in the
[1:13:55] world's he going well the prophet throws
[1:13:57] Us in here right on this quote
[1:14:00] he said Easter is coming up soon and
[1:14:02] this lovely city and across other
[1:14:04] nations they will spend tens of
[1:14:06] thousands of dollars
[1:14:07] to send Easter flowers All Around The
[1:14:10] Altar
[1:14:11] and brother
[1:14:13] that's pagan
[1:14:15] God never ever had an altar with Easter
[1:14:18] flowers on it that was of Cain and put
[1:14:21] it on there and it's coming to Easter
[1:14:24] and they don't even the world's gone
[1:14:26] even Easter now watch this I I have a
[1:14:29] backup plan
[1:14:31] you know there's words I'm reading on
[1:14:33] here
[1:14:34] Easter Christmas and everything else is
[1:14:39] just a great commercialization and it's
[1:14:42] nothing about God in it and what in the
[1:14:46] world's Easter got to do with a rabbit
[1:14:49] and a chicken and a yellow duck and
[1:14:51] something like that
[1:14:54] and yet we just Pagan and heathen
[1:14:59] we're just as Pagan as the heathens are
[1:15:01] and we're worse
[1:15:03] than they are in Africa
[1:15:06] and I'll tell you what
[1:15:08] or a lot worse
[1:15:11] oh about 10 million times because I've
[1:15:14] been to Africa
[1:15:17] and yeah watch this now here's where the
[1:15:19] punchline is
[1:15:20] nobody's run out yet and yet you put up
[1:15:24] with it
[1:15:28] you put up with it no that's an exact
[1:15:31] quote and yet you put up with it and he
[1:15:34] says God help us to shun these things
[1:15:37] and let the sunshine of God begin to
[1:15:40] bathe down and expose these things
[1:15:44] and let's walk in the light
[1:15:48] now I'll just tell you what
[1:15:50] there's about 50 percent of message
[1:15:52] churches and about 100 in the state that
[1:15:54] if you preach that
[1:15:56] you wouldn't have to worry about having
[1:15:57] a traveling Ministry
[1:16:03] you're a radical
[1:16:06] you're radical
[1:16:09] radical
[1:16:11] what's radical
[1:16:19] he talks about us putting on fancy
[1:16:21] clothes at Easter and all these things
[1:16:23] and spend the thousands of dollars and
[1:16:26] and uh and and letting people come in
[1:16:29] that are you know just pay a big money
[1:16:32] to the church so we can build a
[1:16:33] recreation room and that he said but
[1:16:35] there it is he said where did it come
[1:16:37] from he said we see it right here he
[1:16:40] said where did it come from it came from
[1:16:43] Genesis and it began with Cain
[1:16:47] he said look at here those things you
[1:16:49] want to give me attention now this is
[1:16:52] our Prophet saying he said now you want
[1:16:54] to give me your attention now he said
[1:16:56] Here Comes the two minds and they're
[1:16:59] coming up and they still exist in
[1:17:02] Wyoming not in well no sorry they still
[1:17:05] exist in Ontario today
[1:17:13] and he goes into the parable and he
[1:17:15] talks about the the sower of good seed
[1:17:17] and Bad Seed in that
[1:17:19] and receiving the gifts and and I'm just
[1:17:21] going to drop
[1:17:22] down here
[1:17:24] and he says uh
[1:17:32] he said both are going into the seating
[1:17:34] he said the world gets more wicked and
[1:17:37] the church gets more
[1:17:39] powerful
[1:17:41] amen and I don't mean all this is called
[1:17:44] church but he meant Born Again Believers
[1:17:46] not just members but the ones that got
[1:17:49] the spirit and the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:51] Ghost and he says now in paragraph 33 he
[1:17:54] said now notice these two Spirits was on
[1:17:57] those on those boys
[1:18:00] back in Genesis and now Cain was just as
[1:18:03] formal as Abel was if God only wants
[1:18:07] someone to be standing there and say
[1:18:09] well look at here Abel I'm going to be
[1:18:12] accepted to well why
[1:18:15] and see he said well I believe in God
[1:18:18] and King said I do too he said but I
[1:18:20] worship God he said well I do too he
[1:18:22] said but I get my offerings to God but
[1:18:24] he said I do too
[1:18:25] he said but I believe in God he said I
[1:18:27] do too he said but I offer God prayer
[1:18:29] and he said but I do too
[1:18:31] He suggests as formal as the other he
[1:18:33] said why is that cause
[1:18:37] he said it's God by election
[1:18:40] elected his church
[1:18:43] and he said they both grow together and
[1:18:45] I'm just jumping some paragraphs because
[1:18:46] we got to move on
[1:18:48] amen but in the last days he said let me
[1:18:51] it says it'll be so close to you
[1:18:55] communist is not Antichrist it's styling
[1:18:58] and he mentions all these people
[1:19:02] but Jesus said that the Antichrist would
[1:19:04] be so close to the real message believer
[1:19:06] I added the message believer
[1:19:08] that it would deceive the message people
[1:19:12] but it won't deceive the elect
[1:19:15] because it's not possible
[1:19:18] and the Antichrist religion
[1:19:20] the Antichrist is religious and and this
[1:19:24] is I'm moving over on this I'm going to
[1:19:26] go on he said the Antichrist is
[1:19:28] religious and he said let that soak in a
[1:19:30] minute
[1:19:31] he said the Antichrist is a Christian
[1:19:34] professing religion
[1:19:36] and Judith the head of it was a Believer
[1:19:40] added the number of the treasures in the
[1:19:42] church the brother of the same church
[1:19:44] and went in and out among them
[1:19:47] and he was the devil
[1:19:49] professing to believe a Believer and
[1:19:52] this is a last sentence on this quote he
[1:19:54] said
[1:19:55] Shake Yourself now for a minute
[1:19:59] he said May the Holy Spirit
[1:20:01] do it and Shake you back to your
[1:20:04] conscience
[1:20:07] wow
[1:20:09] tolerance
[1:20:10] let's be tolerant
[1:20:12] God wants us to be tolerant so our
[1:20:14] family will commit
[1:20:17] tolerance
[1:20:18] if we're going to be like them just join
[1:20:20] them
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:25] Hallelujah
[1:20:26] we're To Be A peculiar people and we see
[1:20:29] this world as full
[1:20:31] even in the message
[1:20:34] full
[1:20:36] when you say with God's word you'll be
[1:20:38] radical
[1:20:41] amen and the make-believers and the
[1:20:44] unbelievers
[1:20:45] will never see it
[1:20:48] but the word can never deny the word
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:52] the word can never Delight the word
[1:20:55] let's just read some and move on to this
[1:20:57] amen and uh just I'm sorry I just I I
[1:21:00] mean I believe
[1:21:02] God wants us to hear this amen we
[1:21:04] wrestle not against uh Ephesians 6 12.
[1:21:08] we'll lay a foundation we'll get into
[1:21:10] our first examples here we wrestle not
[1:21:14] and this wrestle means to take part in a
[1:21:17] fight or a hard struggle we wrestle not
[1:21:20] against flesh and blood but against
[1:21:21] principalities and principalities is a
[1:21:24] place against powers and against rulers
[1:21:27] of darkness in this world and against
[1:21:31] spiritual wickedness
[1:21:35] message wickedness
[1:21:37] in high places
[1:21:42] amen for the only way for us to
[1:21:44] recognize this and and realize the
[1:21:47] problem is to accept the truth
[1:21:52] message wickedness
[1:21:57] hello
[1:22:01] okay Vicky you can pull up our first
[1:22:02] quote see seed is not air with Chuck and
[1:22:04] we'll read it and then we'll get into
[1:22:06] some scriptures here
[1:22:10] did you ever see an eagle compromise no
[1:22:13] sir
[1:22:14] this is 65 uh
[1:22:19] no that's the wrong one
[1:22:22] sorry
[1:22:27] still the wrong one
[1:22:31] sorry
[1:22:36] well you can you can find it and I'll
[1:22:38] I'll just go on did you ever see an ego
[1:22:39] compromise no sir he said there's no
[1:22:42] compromising in him neither does a
[1:22:44] genuine Christian he ain't soft he'll
[1:22:48] hunt until he finds it amen yes sir and
[1:22:50] he'll find his meat and he wants his
[1:22:52] fresh manna I'm just jumping to read the
[1:22:55] highlights so it's time that for the
[1:22:57] Eagles in this day to get flying higher
[1:23:00] and to dig into God's promises and to
[1:23:02] live on the the literal food that's been
[1:23:06] killed
[1:23:09] for us to take and I'm just dropping
[1:23:11] down to paragraph 126. in the red there
[1:23:15] and no more he said watch this he said
[1:23:17] we have no more prayer meetings no more
[1:23:18] organized uh
[1:23:22] agonizing with God to fulfill his word
[1:23:25] no more believing that the word is still
[1:23:27] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:23:30] he said they've just they've just let it
[1:23:32] down and got denominational and they put
[1:23:34] their name in the book he said they got
[1:23:35] lazy and stuffed and maybe I didn't even
[1:23:38] put this one in there Vicky sorry he
[1:23:41] said maybe they got lazy and soft and he
[1:23:43] said they sat back and then they're
[1:23:45] gloating on some kind of dead carcass he
[1:23:48] said then they're supposed to be at
[1:23:50] least
[1:23:51] he said then they supposed to be at
[1:23:53] least a hawk he said that's similar to a
[1:23:57] brother to an eagle
[1:23:59] amen
[1:24:02] and they they sit on high for rotten
[1:24:04] caucus and man-made Theology and where
[1:24:07] does it get that
[1:24:09] he said you tell them that the days of
[1:24:11] Miracles is passing no such thing as the
[1:24:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said all
[1:24:15] this is nonsense and you mean to tell me
[1:24:17] that that eagle would eat that kind of
[1:24:20] garbage
[1:24:21] he said he couldn't do it he said no sir
[1:24:24] and he said now he promised us a full
[1:24:26] Square meal a seven course meal in our
[1:24:29] day and he said the Seven Seals are open
[1:24:31] and everything's ready in God's word for
[1:24:34] us to receive it
[1:24:36] and he said so the church has lost their
[1:24:39] identity as lesser than a bird brother
[1:24:42] the eagle
[1:24:43] of God's prophets
[1:24:46] amen that's a 65 quote and the Sea does
[1:24:49] not air but the shock came in God help
[1:24:51] us
[1:24:52] God help us
[1:24:54] amen let's turn to Genesis 4 and we'll
[1:24:56] go into our first character here in
[1:25:01] in the the first quote should be uh
[1:25:03] Joseph meeting his brethren uh Vicky
[1:25:08] but Genesis 4 1 maybe we'll look at the
[1:25:10] scripture first and here we see
[1:25:13] in one and I just paraphrased this first
[1:25:15] verse here and Eve conceive and bear
[1:25:18] came and then verse 2
[1:25:21] and she again bear his brother Abel and
[1:25:24] Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain
[1:25:26] was a tiller of the ground and Cain
[1:25:28] talked to Abel his brother
[1:25:31] I mean I'm trying to make this personal
[1:25:32] and we're going to go into there's
[1:25:34] there's like a dozen examples in the
[1:25:36] Bible
[1:25:37] and Cain talked to his brother
[1:25:40] and it came to pass it when they were in
[1:25:42] the field the king rose up against his
[1:25:43] brother and slew him in verse 9 and the
[1:25:46] Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy
[1:25:50] brother and he said I know not am I thy
[1:25:52] Brother's Keeper
[1:25:54] and then in verse 11
[1:25:56] God said unto Cain
[1:25:59] he said and now
[1:26:02] Thou Art cursed
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:06] and now though our curse
[1:26:10] God help us let's look at what the
[1:26:12] prophet says about that amen
[1:26:16] he said now you watch here along the uh
[1:26:18] this destruction here the how do you say
[1:26:22] that word honey
[1:26:26] uh long the lineage of man came down
[1:26:29] through the the sons of Canaan and they
[1:26:31] went to to we know that Cain were just
[1:26:34] fast forward here Cain was they were
[1:26:36] scientists and smart and intellectual
[1:26:38] and and you know marvelous men and they
[1:26:40] they tempered steel and Built Homes and
[1:26:42] did all these things
[1:26:45] but Abel's group were Wanderers
[1:26:50] Wanderers
[1:26:52] Kane's group
[1:26:54] they were working with copper and worked
[1:26:57] with metal and that and both these
[1:26:58] groups of 104 and both these groups were
[1:27:01] religious and Cain was religious as Abel
[1:27:04] was religious and God
[1:27:06] draw the line which was right Cain was
[1:27:10] just as religious as able and they both
[1:27:12] built altars they both believed in God I
[1:27:14] know I'm reading this double but it's a
[1:27:16] different quote and they both worship
[1:27:17] God and they both brought gifts
[1:27:21] now watch them two seeds one was always
[1:27:24] fighting
[1:27:26] the other
[1:27:28] sounds like a message
[1:27:32] one fighting the evil
[1:27:35] trying to destroy the righteous seed
[1:27:40] and he tried to destroy Abel and he did
[1:27:43] it but God raised up Seth and he took
[1:27:45] his place and he thought he had Jesus
[1:27:47] right there and then he slew the babies
[1:27:49] he thought he had Moses so he was always
[1:27:52] trying to kill God in the Believers he
[1:27:54] tried to kill the babies and kill Moses
[1:27:56] and he tried it every way he could to
[1:27:58] destroy this seed and when he killed
[1:28:00] Christ on Calvary here's Satan he said
[1:28:02] by God raise up the same
[1:28:05] an evil religious seed is persecuting
[1:28:09] the righteous lead today that's the
[1:28:12] bottom line if we got the right quote
[1:28:14] the evil religious seed is persecuting
[1:28:18] the righteous sea today he said you see
[1:28:20] it
[1:28:21] thousands though
[1:28:24] they all bless God they just see it come
[1:28:27] they they they're more balanced than the
[1:28:30] message
[1:28:33] no you're not balanced when you're
[1:28:35] attacking
[1:28:36] a believer
[1:28:38] that's not balanced
[1:28:40] that's evil
[1:28:42] amen you see it he said they're trying
[1:28:45] to destroy the righteous branch
[1:28:48] of God
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:55] amen let's just go to another
[1:28:57] want to hear the next quote here
[1:28:59] the mark and we're going to drop the
[1:29:01] highlight of 21. now he said we find out
[1:29:03] that Cain listen to the enemy and he
[1:29:06] said what happened he said because he
[1:29:07] became the first murderer and he said he
[1:29:10] he became the first one to be jealous on
[1:29:12] Earth though this I want you to catch
[1:29:13] his part he said now tell me where the
[1:29:16] pure line up from God
[1:29:19] came from
[1:29:21] tell me how that pure that jealousy came
[1:29:23] out of the pure lineage of God
[1:29:26] well it never of course
[1:29:28] he said where did that murder come from
[1:29:31] he said where did it come he said where
[1:29:34] did that all that kind of Spirit come
[1:29:36] from out of Abraham
[1:29:40] never
[1:29:42] he was directly from God
[1:29:46] he's got a question mark with that he
[1:29:49] said it couldn't have he said it come
[1:29:51] from Satan
[1:29:53] in a message search
[1:29:56] that's what this was in the garden
[1:29:59] it was a message of that day in the
[1:30:01] garden
[1:30:02] he said that we came from Satan it's
[1:30:04] exactly where it came from and he said
[1:30:06] the next paragraph he said now that you
[1:30:08] find that he was the first murderer and
[1:30:10] he was the first one to have jealousy he
[1:30:13] said Lucifer got jealous of Christ
[1:30:15] Michael
[1:30:17] and brought right down to earth and was
[1:30:19] transferred into man
[1:30:22] where'd it come from
[1:30:24] see Lucifer wanted to be the head in
[1:30:26] heaven he wanted to take the worship for
[1:30:28] Michael Christ
[1:30:30] he wanted to be God
[1:30:32] and so then when he comes right down the
[1:30:34] fights right into message churches today
[1:30:36] this was a message Church in the Garden
[1:30:38] of Eden
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:45] and Satan threw Cain
[1:30:47] taking on this evil
[1:30:49] took the first Mark and God marked them
[1:30:53] God Mark King
[1:30:55] amen
[1:30:57] God help us
[1:30:59] let's go to Romans 9 and 13. and we're
[1:31:03] going to look at this and this is this
[1:31:04] story is still taught of Jacob and Esau
[1:31:07] and this is the whole story is in
[1:31:09] Genesis 27 and just for a matter of time
[1:31:12] because I want to put some some Bible
[1:31:14] examples out there
[1:31:16] but it's election brothers and sisters
[1:31:19] and not everybody that says Lord Lord
[1:31:21] are going to be there not everybody that
[1:31:23] says Lord Lord to this message and I
[1:31:25] believe a prophet's going to be there
[1:31:27] they're not even your brother and sister
[1:31:28] they're on the devil their father's the
[1:31:31] devil
[1:31:33] Jesus was the first to say that and
[1:31:35] that's not wrong for us to say that
[1:31:37] recognize the spirit
[1:31:39] amen
[1:31:43] he said his written Romans 9 13 it is
[1:31:46] written Jacob have I loved and Esau have
[1:31:48] I hated now let's pull up the next quote
[1:31:50] and and I mean that's that whole story
[1:31:52] goes into Genesis 27.
[1:31:56] amen but let's just see what a prophet
[1:31:58] talks about this he said
[1:32:02] now as ever it now has now as ever it's
[1:32:07] being the same thing so is it today
[1:32:10] no I don't like that
[1:32:14] but it's still the truth
[1:32:16] but we're not recognizing it
[1:32:18] I don't think most people do
[1:32:22] amen
[1:32:23] it's not what the people are saying
[1:32:25] listen there's and I'm not preaching
[1:32:28] against I'm not trying to take over the
[1:32:30] states or something
[1:32:32] but it's not that you say you believe
[1:32:33] the word but are you living the word
[1:32:36] amen are you the word amen this message
[1:32:40] about being in the vision of God Amen we
[1:32:42] are God's right arm on Earth
[1:32:45] and and you know you could go into that
[1:32:47] being brother Emmanuel and I I promise I
[1:32:49] won't say more in this quote but I'm
[1:32:51] going to show you this example to to
[1:32:53] shake you he said you know on the first
[1:32:55] day of Pentecost when the apostles went
[1:32:57] out and preached and three thousand read
[1:32:59] it to the message devil the devil never
[1:33:01] even got off his chair
[1:33:02] he never even got excited
[1:33:05] and like we get all excited because we
[1:33:07] baptize people and I would too
[1:33:11] but Satan never got excited because new
[1:33:13] Believers came in the church
[1:33:15] but when those same Believers walked by
[1:33:17] a blind person on the side of the church
[1:33:19] and said they never had a prayer meeting
[1:33:21] either not at that time but they prayed
[1:33:24] regularly and they walked by that blind
[1:33:26] person and they were God now they were
[1:33:28] God in flesh and they said well we don't
[1:33:30] have no money but silver and gold don't
[1:33:32] we have but you just rise up and you can
[1:33:34] walk you're you're healed
[1:33:36] and all hell hit the fan
[1:33:40] because it showed the power was in the
[1:33:42] right hand and that we were God's right
[1:33:45] arm
[1:33:46] it wasn't what we were saying it wasn't
[1:33:48] how many members we had in the church
[1:33:50] but now we became God's right arm that
[1:33:54] our Prophet clearly taught us that when
[1:33:56] Jesus went to the right arm of the
[1:33:57] father it wasn't that there was two
[1:33:59] people sitting there it was God's power
[1:34:02] it was in his right arm it was the type
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:09] we got to get to that point if we're
[1:34:11] ever going to leave this earth
[1:34:12] to hold up on the Rapture ain't God
[1:34:15] to hold up in the Rapture is the bride
[1:34:18] amen
[1:34:20] God help us it's the same today and the
[1:34:23] natural church and the spiritual have
[1:34:25] class when they come together
[1:34:28] well just let me tell you what the
[1:34:30] natural Church in the spiritual church
[1:34:31] are all message churches
[1:34:34] I don't clash with the Baptist
[1:34:37] not at all
[1:34:39] I got lots of Baptist friends no class
[1:34:42] at all
[1:34:43] wrestling Holiness they watch lots of
[1:34:45] rape videos there'll be there'll be ones
[1:34:47] from those churches watching this
[1:34:49] morning they never once rebuked me
[1:34:52] but look out message Believers oh bless
[1:34:54] God
[1:35:02] Satan's not going where the battle ain't
[1:35:05] Satan's going right to the front lines
[1:35:08] and he's weaving in among all God's
[1:35:10] elect
[1:35:12] and he's putting on a beautiful suit
[1:35:17] and he's maybe even go and learn how to
[1:35:19] like have an opera voice and talk
[1:35:22] properly and not say the ain't word and
[1:35:27] he said now the natural tries the match
[1:35:29] Are Spiritual and it always goes carnal
[1:35:32] impersonation he said this isn't God
[1:35:34] does God change his mind it's a 65 quote
[1:35:37] paragraph 41 he said now God has his
[1:35:39] church called name set aside and he said
[1:35:42] the age that she lives in and he'll
[1:35:44] reveal himself to her each
[1:35:48] and every time
[1:35:49] amen and 43 I'm just reading the
[1:35:52] highlights you know you can you can read
[1:35:53] it on the screen or or we can get it to
[1:35:55] you imagine by keep it in mind that he
[1:35:58] knows what's in your heart
[1:35:59] and he knows what you mean
[1:36:02] and no matter what you say
[1:36:04] no matter what we say he knows what we
[1:36:07] meant
[1:36:08] he's talking about God
[1:36:10] amen that what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:36:12] there's people saying all these
[1:36:14] wonderful things oh you know brother
[1:36:16] Matt oh you know bless God we baptize
[1:36:19] you and you got the Holy Ghost and you
[1:36:21] know the prophet was wonderful and he
[1:36:23] was by the way and you know and all this
[1:36:25] stuff but the devil
[1:36:33] because Satan's sliding right into the
[1:36:36] family of God if he could
[1:36:39] to Upright the home
[1:36:41] he's trying to Upright the home of God
[1:36:45] amen why do you think he's trying to
[1:36:48] divorce parents
[1:36:50] hello
[1:36:51] you think that's just perchance that
[1:36:53] like 80 percent of people get divorced
[1:36:55] is he's trying to divide and conquer
[1:37:00] Divine and conquer
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:06] Burger 41 44 and we're just going to
[1:37:08] read the highlight and they say they're
[1:37:10] always not nature natural tries
[1:37:14] since Cain destroyed Abel the natural
[1:37:17] always strives to destroy the effects of
[1:37:19] the spiritual
[1:37:20] you know what did Jesus tell the
[1:37:22] disciples this is fresh what did Jesus
[1:37:24] tell the disciples when they came back
[1:37:25] to God and they said you know we've seen
[1:37:27] a bunch of message Believers and they
[1:37:28] were casting out demons along the way
[1:37:30] but we never went to the same Cemetery
[1:37:32] school that they went to so we rebuked
[1:37:34] them
[1:37:36] oh boys I've seen that spirit before
[1:37:38] praise God
[1:37:42] and they came to Jesus and he said you
[1:37:44] did
[1:37:46] you did uh-huh
[1:37:50] he said if they're on our side and
[1:37:53] they're rebuking evil spirits
[1:37:58] huh
[1:38:05] jealousy came from
[1:38:07] where
[1:38:08] huh
[1:38:11] he said just he said you'll find the
[1:38:14] same thing today the very same thing
[1:38:16] today he's repeating it he said it
[1:38:18] proves that it came from Satan because
[1:38:21] it's jealousy and impersonation of the
[1:38:24] truth and so we really believe that God
[1:38:27] never changes his mind about Christmas
[1:38:30] trees
[1:38:31] I mean he had Jeremiah write it in the
[1:38:33] Old Testament
[1:38:35] don't take the ways of the Pagan that go
[1:38:37] out in the forest with the Knacks and
[1:38:40] deck it with gold and silver
[1:38:42] now if you want to believe that Prophet
[1:38:44] then how are you going to believe the
[1:38:45] next prophet
[1:38:49] I guess we're going to quit preaching
[1:38:50] Moses
[1:38:55] Oh no I got it I understand we rate the
[1:38:58] prophets brother Matt
[1:39:00] one to ten
[1:39:02] and if you're on the bottom
[1:39:04] well
[1:39:09] I see
[1:39:10] like we said a few weeks ago we're only
[1:39:13] going to invite season ministers
[1:39:16] what's a seasoned minister
[1:39:20] one that compromises
[1:39:24] like the prophet I just read this quote
[1:39:26] this week you know the prophet said that
[1:39:28] you're born with your gift
[1:39:31] so and the gift is not yours president
[1:39:34] it's God
[1:39:36] so now how do you season God smoke him
[1:39:39] put him in The Smokehouse
[1:39:41] I mean like
[1:39:43] see we say things
[1:39:46] and there'll be people sitting here you
[1:39:48] know
[1:39:48] oh you know he's preached for 500 years
[1:39:56] I'm going to tell you what I just called
[1:39:58] up devil
[1:40:00] devil I just how do you start making a
[1:40:02] check like Devil
[1:40:05] hey it's just as simple if it ain't God
[1:40:11] devil
[1:40:15] I know we we established at the
[1:40:17] beginning that's radical
[1:40:19] I'm sorry
[1:40:21] huh
[1:40:22] man the Hebrew series the next one in
[1:40:24] this 57 there's not a title on yours
[1:40:26] that you put on the screen but I put in
[1:40:28] here this is a Hebrew series chapter 7
[1:40:30] the second time
[1:40:32] he said unless we're born of the spirit
[1:40:34] of God and elected you're lost
[1:40:38] amen it's not him that willeth nor him
[1:40:41] that runeth but it's God that showeth
[1:40:44] Mercy
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:47] and Esau tried to become a Christian and
[1:40:49] he couldn't do it he said the Bible said
[1:40:51] he wept bitterly seeking the place of
[1:40:53] repentance and he couldn't find it he
[1:40:55] said and then before he was even born
[1:40:57] God condemned him because he known he
[1:41:00] was rotten a shaster in his heart
[1:41:03] now I'm going to I want to show you
[1:41:05] something because I really don't I'm
[1:41:07] afraid you're not getting this but but
[1:41:09] we're gonna We're not gonna let this die
[1:41:11] until we know amen and God knowed by
[1:41:14] foreknowledge he knew it and he said I
[1:41:17] have loved Jacob and hated Esau and Esau
[1:41:20] looked more like a message
[1:41:23] gentlemen
[1:41:27] ouch
[1:41:27] he was
[1:41:29] refined
[1:41:32] he had went to message Cemetery
[1:41:39] no those last Parts I added he stayed
[1:41:42] home but took care of his blind daddy
[1:41:43] and he fed the cattle and everything
[1:41:45] else and he was a good boy and Jacob was
[1:41:47] a shyster
[1:41:49] he was a mummy's boy and an
[1:41:50] old-fashioned he even lied
[1:41:55] now I I'm in a flight I'll tell you
[1:41:57] there's lots of examples in the Bible
[1:41:59] where the prophets lied and God never
[1:42:01] once even remembered that they never
[1:42:03] even it never showed that they
[1:42:04] apologized for it now I'm not promoting
[1:42:06] lying
[1:42:07] but I'm promoting the election and the
[1:42:10] true bride of Christ you see what I mean
[1:42:11] like so I mean if you find out that I
[1:42:13] lie you can correct me and you should
[1:42:16] okay it won't be intentional I'm
[1:42:18] positive but
[1:42:20] but do you see all these other examples
[1:42:22] see we're not getting there because we
[1:42:24] we are good people brother Matt
[1:42:31] well bless God I wouldn't vote for that
[1:42:33] Pastor because I remember his past bless
[1:42:36] God
[1:42:39] but in that same church they got deacons
[1:42:41] that got five wives and
[1:42:44] and go preach for ministers that got
[1:42:46] multiple living wives our Prophet said
[1:42:48] that birds with feathers flock together
[1:42:52] you won't see this brother going to
[1:42:54] preach for another Minister that's got
[1:42:55] two living wives in the same church
[1:42:57] building
[1:42:58] something will freeze over before that
[1:43:00] happens
[1:43:02] oh brother Dale you're radical
[1:43:05] no I'm not radical I'm just truthful
[1:43:12] amen
[1:43:17] Jacob
[1:43:19] was a liar a Storyteller what was he
[1:43:22] and you have to admit it the Bible
[1:43:24] admits it and brings it he said run
[1:43:26] around doing everything he said his mama
[1:43:28] hung around with his mama and but yet
[1:43:30] Jacob
[1:43:32] with all his ups and downs and all his
[1:43:35] lying and failures
[1:43:37] and deceitfulness
[1:43:42] and his ways he still showed
[1:43:44] respects
[1:43:46] to the birthright
[1:43:47] so I want God I might lie still cheap
[1:43:51] I'd be wrong if I did by the way but but
[1:43:55] I want God I want him no matter what
[1:43:58] I want God
[1:44:07] amen he showed respects to the
[1:44:09] birthright and that was the Keynote
[1:44:11] he see Esau was twice the gentleman
[1:44:14] Jacob was and he said if you were
[1:44:15] judging them today uh Esau would be a
[1:44:18] way better member in the church thousand
[1:44:21] the sort of prophet said one thousand to
[1:44:23] one
[1:44:30] if you didn't know him but God took
[1:44:33] Jacob
[1:44:35] wow
[1:44:37] he said no no this even spoke to me
[1:44:40] watch this you know you got to look past
[1:44:42] all what I'm trying to tell you is look
[1:44:44] past all this chaft
[1:44:47] and looked at the real grain you know I
[1:44:49] got this throat because I blew up the
[1:44:51] combine on Monday Monday brother Matt my
[1:44:53] kids all the dirty work for me
[1:44:56] and man I couldn't breathe almost
[1:44:57] immediately
[1:44:58] and then something else happened I think
[1:45:00] but
[1:45:02] we're looking at the shaft
[1:45:05] you know there's a lot more chaff than
[1:45:06] there is green
[1:45:07] when you look out the back of my combine
[1:45:09] when I'm going through the field it
[1:45:10] looks like a dust storm
[1:45:12] there's a lot more crud going out the
[1:45:14] back than there is coming in the bin but
[1:45:16] what's coming in the bin is valuable
[1:45:19] well we got our eyes on the we got the
[1:45:21] eyes on Hollywood oh my God
[1:45:28] oh
[1:45:29] I see
[1:45:33] a thousand to one
[1:45:34] if you didn't know him but God took Jake
[1:45:36] anyway oh here he says he says here
[1:45:40] he said here Paul was a minister
[1:45:42] and you know we we love these scriptures
[1:45:44] because we know the end of the story and
[1:45:46] that but you know how many of you though
[1:45:48] where Paul went around and murdered your
[1:45:50] kids and your dad would you just jump in
[1:45:53] and sit in his church and listen to him
[1:45:54] preach the next Sunday
[1:45:57] brother Dale would have a trouble with
[1:45:58] that
[1:45:59] I'd have to have a couple prayer
[1:46:00] meetings
[1:46:04] but that's exactly the way we are today
[1:46:07] amen he said here Paul
[1:46:10] he said he said what would you do with
[1:46:12] Saint Paul he said he wanted to be a
[1:46:14] minister he said it was an old hook no
[1:46:15] juice and his old most setting ways and
[1:46:18] he said he was going around setting
[1:46:19] faces staring churches apart killing
[1:46:23] people
[1:46:25] arguing and committing all these things
[1:46:27] and people said Paul committed the
[1:46:28] unpardonable sin and you know what God
[1:46:31] said to him
[1:46:33] and the message believer said now Paul's
[1:46:35] committed the own part of no sin he
[1:46:37] showed disrespect to the Believers he's
[1:46:39] murdered them he's tore up their
[1:46:40] churches confessed them to the
[1:46:42] government threw him in prison and this
[1:46:44] is what God Said
[1:46:45] he's my servant
[1:46:48] I'm like
[1:46:51] hello no no no God God whoa whoa whoa
[1:46:54] wait wait a minute that you
[1:46:57] he's hello
[1:47:00] God says he's my servant
[1:47:02] God you need to reconsider let me tell
[1:47:05] you what he did haven't you read the
[1:47:06] newspaper God
[1:47:11] amen
[1:47:12] now we're the exact same today
[1:47:15] so we're looking at all the chaft
[1:47:18] but look in the heart look at look sin
[1:47:20] back from a distance like you know like
[1:47:22] they say Let me let me just finish this
[1:47:24] quote he said God takes the man
[1:47:27] this is this is a powerful line the
[1:47:29] prophet says he said God takes the men
[1:47:31] and makes him different
[1:47:34] it's not the man taking God becoming
[1:47:38] different
[1:47:41] that's a very different statement
[1:47:44] he said God takes the men and God makes
[1:47:48] that man different
[1:47:50] but we got a lot of men in the message
[1:47:52] that are taking the message God and
[1:47:55] think they're becoming different
[1:47:58] and it's Satan
[1:48:01] amen and God takes his man and he makes
[1:48:04] them different and it's not what you do
[1:48:07] or what you will or what you think it's
[1:48:10] what God does
[1:48:12] there you got it there's the story it's
[1:48:15] what God does
[1:48:17] Hallelujah so we know that that whole
[1:48:20] story if you want to read that on
[1:48:24] Esau and Jacob is chapter 27 in Genesis
[1:48:27] and we're just going to keep radon
[1:48:29] rolling by there
[1:48:30] amen
[1:48:32] Hallelujah
[1:48:33] see the discrepancy you don't have these
[1:48:35] quotes Vicki and I'm just going to read
[1:48:37] this it's a 60
[1:48:38] five quote he said now as I've said
[1:48:45] he said now as I've said Judith
[1:48:49] Judas
[1:48:51] had real Faith had no real Faith sorry
[1:48:53] had no real faith he had make believe
[1:48:57] faith
[1:48:58] he had faith that he thought that that
[1:49:01] was the son of God
[1:49:03] but he didn't know that it was the son
[1:49:07] of God
[1:49:08] now that's a huge difference I think
[1:49:12] this is truth
[1:49:14] but I'm living the truth
[1:49:17] that's different
[1:49:19] amen amen amen a huge difference now he
[1:49:24] but he didn't know it was the son of God
[1:49:25] and he did it and he wouldn't have sold
[1:49:28] him he wouldn't have done it sold him
[1:49:30] for 30 pieces of silver
[1:49:32] he wouldn't have done it if he had a new
[1:49:36] a man who will now I put this in capital
[1:49:39] letters this is this is
[1:49:41] see the discrepancy a man who will
[1:49:43] compromise on this word of God being the
[1:49:47] truth he's got to be
[1:49:50] a make-believer
[1:49:52] he's got to have make-believer faith
[1:49:55] a man that'll compromise
[1:49:57] on the Bible in the word you know let me
[1:49:59] give you an example he said we get
[1:50:01] message people
[1:50:02] where like they were raised in a message
[1:50:05] Church they get married and they get
[1:50:07] divorced
[1:50:10] so maybe they leave the church for like
[1:50:11] two months they won't marry a marry
[1:50:14] another woman and then they come back to
[1:50:16] church say I'm still a message believer
[1:50:18] supposed to do with that brother Matt
[1:50:20] like see sin is one thing but but what's
[1:50:24] what's the word I'm looking for but but
[1:50:25] uh to know to do right and not do it
[1:50:27] iniquity iniquity that's another whole
[1:50:30] world
[1:50:31] okay that's what I'm talking about
[1:50:32] compromise
[1:50:34] so you know you can marry two women
[1:50:37] so you left the church for two months
[1:50:39] you went married to women then you
[1:50:40] wanted to come back and bring your
[1:50:41] religion to me God don't want you
[1:50:44] you think God's going to forgive
[1:50:46] inequity
[1:50:47] let me give you another example
[1:50:49] well there's no there's no Christian
[1:50:52] Believers in the message to marry so
[1:50:54] we'll go Mary we'll compromise we'll
[1:50:56] marry somebody that believes in Jesus
[1:50:59] well I mean it's a three Jesus but
[1:51:02] and so they go out in the world and they
[1:51:04] marry a three Jesus
[1:51:05] and then they come back to church and
[1:51:07] say no accept me I'm going to pay my
[1:51:09] tithes
[1:51:12] and the Bible says
[1:51:15] absolutely under no conditions
[1:51:18] absolutely under no conditions Mary a
[1:51:21] three God person
[1:51:23] Mary make believer
[1:51:25] and it says the Bible also says how can
[1:51:27] light and darkness walk together
[1:51:30] and how can two walk together unless
[1:51:33] they agree
[1:51:34] absolutely now there's three scriptures
[1:51:36] and you expect that well oh bless God
[1:51:39] this guy was like he never had a belly
[1:51:42] he was like he was bad like I mean he
[1:51:44] even left weights and so I married him
[1:51:46] but now I'm going to bring him to my
[1:51:47] gospel
[1:51:52] sorry
[1:51:55] and when you say that people say oh
[1:51:58] you're not forgiving you're radical
[1:52:00] you're radical I only put the Christmas
[1:52:03] tree in the back seat
[1:52:07] radical
[1:52:09] radical
[1:52:11] what did the Bible say
[1:52:12] did you know
[1:52:15] had you read that
[1:52:17] oh yeah but I was backsplitted
[1:52:19] did you still know
[1:52:24] and our churches are becoming full of
[1:52:26] that garbage
[1:52:29] and the Bible says
[1:52:30] he'll speed you out of his mouth
[1:52:38] it's going to get so tight before we
[1:52:41] leave this world
[1:52:43] hell's come up house come up
[1:52:47] it really has come up
[1:52:51] I'm telling you you know we we are alive
[1:52:55] today
[1:52:56] and somehow God's got to protect us but
[1:52:58] there's a difference between things you
[1:53:01] don't have to do and things you do have
[1:53:03] to do
[1:53:04] like like for example let me give you an
[1:53:06] example I'm losing you but if you go to
[1:53:09] the grocery store you need to buy
[1:53:11] groceries
[1:53:12] like maybe you can't manufacture well
[1:53:14] you shouldn't buy sugar so like that's
[1:53:17] that that'll kill you that causes cancer
[1:53:19] and make you fat like me so but maybe
[1:53:22] you need to buy something that you can't
[1:53:23] grow in your garden
[1:53:26] when it's cold that's the only place you
[1:53:27] get permission
[1:53:29] but that grocery store sells liquor
[1:53:35] now I know people
[1:53:38] that are more radical than me they say
[1:53:39] well I won't go to the store because
[1:53:40] they sell liquor so I'm not going to the
[1:53:42] store
[1:53:43] well
[1:53:45] hmm
[1:53:47] you'd really have to look hard to find
[1:53:48] another store
[1:53:51] but now put that whole scenario now if
[1:53:54] you go to the bar
[1:53:55] where you wouldn't have to be
[1:53:59] now I know some of the best restaurants
[1:54:01] are bar restaurants and even
[1:54:03] you know and you know I mean I've eaten
[1:54:06] those but do you see where we're going
[1:54:08] there's things that you must do and then
[1:54:11] there's things that you don't have to do
[1:54:14] you know what I mean
[1:54:19] gotta look at those two things
[1:54:20] differently
[1:54:23] he will
[1:54:27] God help us
[1:54:30] it's it's like and I'm not going there
[1:54:33] but it's like the internet nor a prophet
[1:54:35] used to preach about TV
[1:54:37] and he said then that Satan brought a
[1:54:40] trick and moved the teeth the well the
[1:54:42] prophet used to preach about going to
[1:54:44] movie shows then he said he moved the
[1:54:46] movie show in the house
[1:54:48] now now now
[1:54:52] I have heard
[1:54:54] not from brother Brandon himself because
[1:54:56] he was dead before I was born
[1:54:58] but I have heard
[1:55:00] from his kids the brother Branham
[1:55:03] watched Gunsmoke
[1:55:05] and Bonanza
[1:55:07] western movies
[1:55:09] Gunsmoke and Bonanza
[1:55:12] but I want to tell you something we're
[1:55:14] living in a different world than when
[1:55:15] the prophet was here
[1:55:16] yeah I'm just going to be flat out
[1:55:18] honest with you I got a sore throat or
[1:55:19] I'd be jumping a lot more
[1:55:23] this week on my video thing
[1:55:26] even in studying it if I was online
[1:55:31] online
[1:55:32] I mean completely
[1:55:35] in the message mode brother Matt
[1:55:38] through the Wi-Fi
[1:55:41] and if you went from one scene to
[1:55:43] another there was pornography come up
[1:55:47] and I'm talking about scenes that
[1:55:48] weren't fit for me to see
[1:55:54] so we're Beyond preaching about TV
[1:55:59] you'd have to start preaching about
[1:56:01] pastors using the internet to search a
[1:56:02] message
[1:56:05] that's crazy
[1:56:07] but that's where we're living
[1:56:08] and it might actually get to that point
[1:56:10] but what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:56:13] Satan
[1:56:15] is a slicker
[1:56:17] and he's coming in every corner to try
[1:56:20] to break down God's family
[1:56:22] and we we need to be really careful we
[1:56:25] need to recognize Satan he's religious
[1:56:28] and he's a sharp dude
[1:56:31] he's religious and he's a sharp dude he
[1:56:34] ain't no hairy beast coming in
[1:56:36] amen sit back and watch how people treat
[1:56:39] one another
[1:56:40] you want to know the character of a
[1:56:42] person watch how they treat one another
[1:56:44] you know they used to say he said you
[1:56:46] girls if you're looking for a husband
[1:56:47] and you look at some get some fat guy
[1:56:50] like your dad that's real ugly and all
[1:56:52] the other girls run from and stand back
[1:56:55] and watch how he treats his mother
[1:56:58] or better yet even better yet
[1:57:01] his grandmother
[1:57:05] and if he ever goes and sees her
[1:57:08] and that's exactly how much he'll visit
[1:57:09] you when he gets done with you
[1:57:15] it's called character
[1:57:18] it's called
[1:57:20] election
[1:57:22] and it's in the real bride of Christ
[1:57:25] bride don't destroy bride
[1:57:28] you would be just Jehovah does not
[1:57:30] destroy Jehovah
[1:57:33] Jehovah is not in a competition with
[1:57:35] Jehovah my big toe is not trying to be
[1:57:37] my head and my head right now is trying
[1:57:40] to be my arm
[1:57:45] you understand
[1:57:49] jealousy
[1:57:51] can I share one more example with you
[1:57:54] pilate pilot let me share a pilot pilate
[1:57:58] had a choice to make he said Matthew 27
[1:58:00] 17 and we're going to close soon because
[1:58:03] we're not going to finish and I'll pull
[1:58:05] up somewhere I was remembering today
[1:58:07] pilot Matthew 27 17 therefore when they
[1:58:10] entered in together pilate said unto
[1:58:13] them whom will ye that I release unto
[1:58:15] you see pilate had a choice
[1:58:18] and even our Prophet when I'm preaching
[1:58:20] election this morning but you'll only be
[1:58:22] there if you're elected
[1:58:25] but you could still refuse
[1:58:31] the prophet said multiple multiple times
[1:58:33] you're a free moral agent he also said
[1:58:35] that Judas name was taking off the
[1:58:38] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:58:41] so don't get too heavy duty on that you
[1:58:44] won't even be there if you're not
[1:58:45] elected
[1:58:46] but if you're elected and you tell God I
[1:58:49] hate you
[1:58:50] enough times
[1:58:54] you know
[1:58:57] God has a way of bringing people around
[1:58:59] and changing that hate to love
[1:59:01] like breaking your legs and you know
[1:59:04] working on you
[1:59:06] but here pilate had example
[1:59:08] he said who would I release unto you
[1:59:10] Brabus or Jesus which is called the
[1:59:12] Christ see even pilate knew God and then
[1:59:16] we know the story he said pilate in
[1:59:18] verse 19 he said pilate's wife said unto
[1:59:20] him and and the prophet dramatized us
[1:59:23] here said Pilots ain't ready to give
[1:59:25] judgment on Jesus
[1:59:28] and he said a horse man comes up and
[1:59:30] runs up and gives pilate a note and it's
[1:59:32] from his wife
[1:59:34] and he said don't have nothing to do
[1:59:35] with this just man because I've suffered
[1:59:38] many things in a dream last night
[1:59:40] and and the prophet dramatizes like this
[1:59:43] he said now if you were sitting in that
[1:59:44] courtroom he said you would see him read
[1:59:46] that note and pilate's face turned white
[1:59:48] and His Hands start to quiver reading
[1:59:51] the note
[1:59:52] and his knees wobbling as he stood up
[1:59:58] he knew
[2:00:00] he knew
[2:00:02] and his wife knew
[2:00:07] for sure he knew
[2:00:10] the father's wife sat on them have
[2:00:12] nothing to do with this just man for
[2:00:14] I've suffered many things in a night in
[2:00:15] a dream because of him and verse 20 the
[2:00:18] chief priests and Elders watch this the
[2:00:20] message people and the and the uh what's
[2:00:24] the word uh season the message and
[2:00:27] seasoned ministers in the message
[2:00:30] persuaded the multitude that they would
[2:00:33] ask for Barabbas and Destroy Jesus
[2:00:35] now that's today's scripture
[2:00:40] a matter of fact I'll even tell you this
[2:00:42] that's thus saith the Lord
[2:00:45] because I was there when God gave it to
[2:00:46] me
[2:00:50] yep
[2:00:51] the religious people in The Message
[2:00:53] Church what you say you say no you went
[2:00:56] too far the Bible says that Jesus went
[2:00:58] to his own
[2:01:00] at his own refused him not
[2:01:07] oh
[2:01:09] they just don't see it the same as us
[2:01:12] careful
[2:01:14] careful
[2:01:16] praise God I'm not looking for a
[2:01:17] traveling Ministry
[2:01:18] I'm not looking for a Ministry period
[2:01:27] 20 and the chief priests
[2:01:29] message believers and the seasoned
[2:01:32] message believers
[2:01:34] persuaded the church members
[2:01:37] to ask for Barabbas
[2:01:39] and Destroy Jesus
[2:01:41] and Spirits don't die
[2:01:43] it's the exact same in 2023.
[2:01:48] I said it before I said if you ever get
[2:01:50] persuaded or get persecuted it'll be
[2:01:53] from inside the church
[2:01:55] if I ever go behind bars it'll be cause
[2:01:58] a message person
[2:01:59] testifies against me it will not be it
[2:02:02] it will not be my neighbor's brother
[2:02:03] Matt it will not be
[2:02:05] they're highly respected among them
[2:02:11] yep because Lucifer was in heaven and he
[2:02:15] wanted the worship of Jesus
[2:02:17] Michael that's the exact same spirit and
[2:02:22] it is extremely healthy with all this
[2:02:24] fresh rain it's growing like crazy
[2:02:28] natural types of spiritual there's no
[2:02:31] drought in the spiritual
[2:02:34] uh-huh
[2:02:36] that's far out ain't it
[2:02:38] amen if you put up the true Easter seal
[2:02:41] there and just uh
[2:02:48] put up the second one I think it is
[2:02:50] we're just going to skip the first one
[2:02:51] it was mostly talking about King nabel
[2:02:54] but if we go to uh
[2:02:57] uh sorry
[2:03:10] well
[2:03:14] I mean we're just read them both because
[2:03:15] I can't find the word I'm looking for
[2:03:23] all right paragraph 70 76 and the sons
[2:03:27] of Cain rather the Sons of Satan and the
[2:03:30] Sons of Satan came the sons of King
[2:03:33] Cain was the son of Satan and so there
[2:03:36] you have it the sons of King today you
[2:03:38] say are you sure brother Brown
[2:03:41] they were questioning the prophet you're
[2:03:42] questioning me this morning I said yep
[2:03:44] I'm sure I'm positive
[2:03:46] he said Jesus said 77 he said when when
[2:03:49] he was here on Earth he said
[2:03:52] he told them religious Believers he said
[2:03:54] you are our other father is the devil
[2:03:56] and yet they were Pious and religious
[2:03:58] and Scholars and they had great
[2:04:00] buildings and he said they failed to
[2:04:02] recognize the Christ and they failed to
[2:04:04] catch it in their day said the same
[2:04:06] thing they failed to recognize the day
[2:04:08] we're living in
[2:04:09] he said we jump down to paragraph 79
[2:04:11] what's highlighted and we know then
[2:04:13] that's the same devil in the beginning
[2:04:15] was the one who personated Cain and
[2:04:17] persecuted his brother and killed them
[2:04:19] he said it's the same thing taking place
[2:04:21] today the same leaders have persecuted
[2:04:23] Jesus and killed them and they forced
[2:04:25] him to a decision the same thing that
[2:04:27] forced back in the Garden of Eden and
[2:04:29] they forced to make a decision he said
[2:04:31] well what about this the sons of Cain
[2:04:34] the Sons of Satan said in paragraph 80
[2:04:37] and we're just going to read the
[2:04:38] highlights and now that was all
[2:04:40] that was and all that would be and all
[2:04:44] the kingdoms of the world and he said
[2:04:45] these are mine this is talking about
[2:04:48] Satan he said these are mine and I'll do
[2:04:50] with them whatever I want to and I'll
[2:04:52] make them fight and make them do this or
[2:04:55] anything and he claimed the kingdoms of
[2:04:57] the world and so when we can see how
[2:05:00] greed and selfishness comes into
[2:05:04] policies or politics
[2:05:07] and we can see them where where it's in
[2:05:10] the church and the church leaders are
[2:05:13] greedy and selfies and it comes into the
[2:05:16] church
[2:05:17] he said just in the end of 81 just this
[2:05:20] highlight he said what what was Paul the
[2:05:22] political side he said they could find
[2:05:25] nothing against him so here the
[2:05:27] government of the day see what I said
[2:05:28] the world will not condemn you
[2:05:31] the government pilate couldn't condemn
[2:05:33] Jesus
[2:05:37] but the seasoned ministers could
[2:05:41] wow
[2:05:43] amen
[2:05:45] and the policy the politics of the day
[2:05:47] you can find nothing against them even
[2:05:49] so much that pilate said unto himself
[2:05:50] pilate said I find no fault in them
[2:05:54] and he said then it comes to the church
[2:05:55] and he said they the church the message
[2:05:58] church and he said they're forced to
[2:06:00] make a decision after the political
[2:06:02] world had set Jesus free to cooperate
[2:06:05] with such a spirit as it was in the
[2:06:08] church he said what was in what was in
[2:06:11] the politics to show that if Satan lost
[2:06:15] his battle here he was still had
[2:06:18] something in reserve so what the
[2:06:19] prophet's saying is when Satan lost the
[2:06:22] battle and and pilate said I don't find
[2:06:25] no fault in Jesus in the political world
[2:06:27] Satan had already infested the message
[2:06:30] church and he said I'll kill him from
[2:06:32] the church
[2:06:36] wow
[2:06:42] amen
[2:06:44] amen God help us
[2:06:46] God help us to recognize him man we're
[2:06:48] going to go into some more things when
[2:06:49] we come back I mean we got Joseph and
[2:06:51] his boys and many more examples that
[2:06:53] we'll we'll finish out if God permits us
[2:06:55] to do amen
[2:06:57] amen it's a let's stand amen
[2:07:02] we don't want to hold you long him in
[2:07:05] how you preach for another hour on the
[2:07:07] Same Spirit but the results are saying
[2:07:09] is Satan is a Slicker and he's if we let
[2:07:13] the bars down well it's already happened
[2:07:16] the saints come into the church and even
[2:07:18] when our Prophet was here he said the
[2:07:20] churches have Believers and make
[2:07:22] Believers and non-believers
[2:07:25] and you'll recognize Satan by his
[2:07:27] character
[2:07:29] and by if he says well you know
[2:07:32] he meant the Bible means
[2:07:35] you know
[2:07:37] you know
[2:07:38] when the conversation starts oh brother
[2:07:40] Matt well you know
[2:07:44] compromise
[2:07:45] if they call you radical
[2:07:50] you're radical because you want to go
[2:07:51] marry a denominational girl or man
[2:07:53] radical
[2:07:55] when the Bible tells us the Bible tells
[2:07:58] us three times
[2:07:59] through four times
[2:08:01] never under no conditions
[2:08:04] Mary and unbeliever never
[2:08:07] never
[2:08:09] that's never
[2:08:16] holiness
[2:08:18] the Bible says without holiness
[2:08:20] no man will see God
[2:08:22] we're living in a world
[2:08:28] where Hollywood's coming in the church
[2:08:32] oh
[2:08:40] but in the religious ranks
[2:09:17] Mary non-believers
[2:09:20] non-believer sits home
[2:09:22] believer comes
[2:09:25] but they've done it intentionally
[2:09:27] they're like slapping in God but
[2:09:30] intentional is Iniquity
[2:09:32] you know what's wrong
[2:09:34] you say well God will understand God
[2:09:36] will not understand God will not
[2:09:38] understand
[2:09:41] he's coming for a peculiar bride that'll
[2:09:44] look different and all the Jezebels in
[2:09:46] the world
[2:09:47] amen and that's who he's coming to marry
[2:09:50] amen
[2:09:51] and I'll tell you right now
[2:09:53] the farther we go along
[2:09:56] and I I'm sorry to tell you this I
[2:09:58] really am
[2:10:00] the farther we go along and the farther
[2:10:03] the Rapture is is not come you're going
[2:10:06] to become more radical and radical
[2:10:11] radical they're radical
[2:10:18] I want to tell you this morning
[2:10:21] things give you the power
[2:10:24] I'm going to preach that sometime
[2:10:27] to make a world
[2:10:29] and live on it
[2:10:31] and you do not have to be affected
[2:10:34] on whether it rains or sunshines
[2:10:36] tomorrow
[2:10:38] I'm not a factor
[2:10:39] because this I have no love for this
[2:10:41] world
[2:10:43] the love of the world
[2:10:45] and so I'm not I'm not connected
[2:10:47] I want to be connected to God but not to
[2:10:50] the world
[2:10:52] I'm disconnected to the world
[2:10:55] and as they separate you're going to be
[2:10:57] so the saints come in like a flood but
[2:10:59] God's raised up a standard and that
[2:11:01] standard was the baptism of the Holy
[2:11:03] Ghost where you could speak a world into
[2:11:05] existence
[2:11:06] and go live and you know what that world
[2:11:08] is it's peace
[2:11:11] and yourself
[2:11:14] it's you and Christ
[2:11:17] and you're not real I'm not concerned
[2:11:19] what
[2:11:20] you know I'm not concerned about people
[2:11:24] see you have hot no believer
[2:11:27] no believer
[2:11:29] has low self-esteem
[2:11:34] no no believer God does not have low
[2:11:36] self-esteem of himself
[2:11:39] and you you can't be of God and have low
[2:11:41] self-esteem
[2:11:43] I don't mean that sounds arrogant but
[2:11:45] amen God knows who he is and where he
[2:11:48] stands
[2:11:49] and he's the same yesterday today and
[2:11:51] forever and he's not going to change
[2:11:53] amen God help us God help brother Dale
[2:11:57] wow
[2:11:59] yeah
[2:12:01] we've come all this way
[2:12:05] we've come all this way to the map
[2:12:08] and then we're going to start letting go
[2:12:09] with
[2:12:14] this thing
[2:12:15] and that thing we can
[2:12:18] really
[2:12:20] we're going to start we will paint our
[2:12:22] face just so we're getting married
[2:12:25] that'll be all right because it's the
[2:12:26] wedding
[2:12:29] really
[2:12:31] I've had message Believers tell me that
[2:12:33] well we never wear makeup except on our
[2:12:35] wedding
[2:12:37] well I hope you enjoy help
[2:12:40] it'll be fairly unpleasant there
[2:12:44] but you have a nice wedding
[2:12:47] because watch this this is as fresh as
[2:12:51] it gets what's God taking a picture of
[2:12:53] you when you're old or young
[2:12:55] you take a picture at your best at your
[2:12:57] wedding
[2:12:58] and he'll say Jezebel
[2:13:07] in this message
[2:13:10] probably 95 percent
[2:13:14] oh bless God I just want to look good
[2:13:15] for my pictures yeah yeah you'll look
[2:13:17] good for God's pictures too
[2:13:21] see if it's in there
[2:13:23] it's see you know I'm combined in wheat
[2:13:26] now
[2:13:27] and it's done growing
[2:13:31] and it's completely mature
[2:13:34] and if there's a stock of Timothy in the
[2:13:36] field brother Matt I can identify that's
[2:13:38] Timothy this is we if there was a stock
[2:13:40] of Oats come up I can identify there's
[2:13:42] the oats they look completely different
[2:13:44] because they're mature and they look
[2:13:46] different in the wheat and barley and
[2:13:48] rye grass and Quack grass not but all in
[2:13:52] their maturity they all look like blades
[2:13:56] but now it's went into quackgrass and
[2:13:58] Timothy and crab grass and barnyard
[2:14:01] grass and and barley and oats and rye
[2:14:05] grass
[2:14:07] and God's just going that's mine
[2:14:12] oh rye grass oh no
[2:14:18] that's blood but that's that's still the
[2:14:20] truth
[2:14:22] it's blood that's the truth we're we're
[2:14:24] not in a baby age we're in a mature age
[2:14:27] we've had all this strong food this
[2:14:29] seven course meal since the seals have
[2:14:31] been opened and there's no Mysteries
[2:14:33] that aren't unveiled the prophet is come
[2:14:35] and the Bible's brand new and like
[2:14:38] that's why it's so hard when you're
[2:14:39] making a message because God I'll just
[2:14:42] get something and I'll put it down on my
[2:14:44] iPad and I'll completely leave it alone
[2:14:46] I'll get something else to come in a
[2:14:48] different field and I'll just put it
[2:14:49] down too
[2:14:50] I'll put something else down and then
[2:14:52] all of a sudden there'll be like a tidal
[2:14:54] wave and it'll just go
[2:14:57] and I'll look into it
[2:14:58] and it would just go
[2:15:00] and go
[2:15:02] and go I looked into Yesterday put down
[2:15:04] all my thoughts I woke up this morning I
[2:15:06] wrote three things before I left my
[2:15:08] bedroom coming out in three more
[2:15:09] thoughts and I came this morning they
[2:15:10] were just flooding just
[2:15:15] because because it's all understood God
[2:15:18] wants you to clearly understand who he
[2:15:19] is
[2:15:20] because when you go like
[2:15:23] when you go to see Isaac
[2:15:25] Rebecca had never seen him
[2:15:30] but she knew
[2:15:32] Eliezer
[2:15:34] had just brought Rebecca look at when
[2:15:36] when God went to see Abraham Abraham had
[2:15:39] never seen
[2:15:40] because of it
[2:15:43] but if you had seen him
[2:15:48] because he knew
[2:15:50] I made it's just amazing Revelation
[2:15:54] election of Revelation it's just it's
[2:15:56] just beautiful
[2:15:58] amen God help us
[2:16:01] God help me
[2:16:12] I hope
[2:16:14] I hope you got what God wanted
[2:16:17] I seen I'm old enough to see how people
[2:16:20] that grew up have changed
[2:16:23] I've seen message people change
[2:16:26] I've seen I've seen message people go
[2:16:28] out on Devil's Night trick-or-treating
[2:16:32] I've seen them
[2:16:34] do all these things close their Church
[2:16:36] on Christmas
[2:16:37] hire only Elite ministers
[2:16:43] I've seen all these changes I grew up in
[2:16:45] the Holiness Church
[2:16:46] where you in the dream of cutting your
[2:16:48] hair or wearing anything than a skirt to
[2:16:50] the floor
[2:16:54] standards completely gone
[2:16:56] completely
[2:17:01] women preachers
[2:17:03] anything goes it's it you know what it
[2:17:06] is it's that new love
[2:17:09] it's that new love it's called tolerance
[2:17:19] and the Bible says that that new love
[2:17:21] was an abomination
[2:17:26] it's that new love
[2:17:30] yeah
[2:17:32] abomination
[2:17:34] he's saying there's got to be a drastic
[2:17:36] difference
[2:17:38] a drastic there's got to be a radical
[2:17:40] difference
[2:17:43] between us and that
[2:17:45] radical
[2:17:48] that'd help us God help us I mean you're
[2:17:51] not we're not going to save anybody be
[2:17:53] becoming them
