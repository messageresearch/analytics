[33:32] I'm really glad that you know this this
[33:34] trip is a different one I I used to
[33:36] travel travel a lot and when I travel
[33:39] maybe for one month you know go from one
[33:42] place to the next not to in Canada
[33:44] though but different parts of the world
[33:46] and I will travel from one place but uh
[33:49] this is just a special trip for me
[33:52] though I I I I I I didn't just come to
[33:56] preach but I realize I am connecting to
[33:59] the the believer's
[34:02] spirit connecting to your spirit and
[34:06] that's wonderful you know I'm glad that
[34:08] we have a a DNA in
[34:12] common praise be to God and I love your
[34:16] spirit and I love your understanding of
[34:19] the word and you know we will Fellowship
[34:24] oh
[34:25] further definitely we will Fellowship
[34:28] further amen and I feel at home very
[34:32] interesting the first night I felt I
[34:35] felt at
[34:36] Liberty I I I didn't feel one foot and
[34:39] no breaks when I was
[34:41] preaching amen and so I'm glad I was a
[34:44] part of this and you know you know the
[34:47] Book of James chapter 18 he said that he
[34:51] begot us with a word of
[34:53] Truth and uh that truth is our
[34:57] DNA glory to God we have one DNA and
[35:01] that's the word of Truth you know think
[35:03] about we got he tonight and my mind
[35:06] reflect in s Simeon you know when he was
[35:10] led up the Holy Spirit to go to the
[35:12] temple amen that was when he meant the
[35:15] Lord Christ Jesus the baby Jesus so he
[35:18] takes the Holy Spirit to lead him to
[35:21] Jesus and I believe tonight that we're
[35:23] not just here to have church but it
[35:26] takes the Holy Spirit leading us here
[35:30] Amen on this connection we're not just
[35:33] here to look for a picture on the wall
[35:36] we're not just here to look for a man
[35:38] hang on a cross but we're here to
[35:40] Fellowship one with another amen and so
[35:44] you know when you think about there's
[35:46] something I was just thinking in the
[35:47] office there and you know people uh uh
[35:50] have you know have to see something to
[35:53] worship you know like Israel you know
[35:56] one time they said that Israel is a
[35:59] people in the hoing days you know they
[36:02] were people of tangibility they like to
[36:04] to see who are who they woring you know
[36:08] mo God took Moses from their presence

[38:50] a world we're living
[38:51] into it won't
[38:54] change it may get worse
[38:57] as we get closer to get out of here oh
[39:00] God is that right Pastor you
[39:04] sho in my younger years in the ministry
[39:08] I used to carry the church on my
[39:10] head for the course if I come to church
[39:14] and I don't see the people I used to cry
[39:17] I would worried and I held the pastor
[39:20] call me he should come here let me teach
[39:22] you something never you carry God's
[39:23] Church on your head car it to the heart
[39:31] it won't change you're going to get
[39:33] worse but then so tonight let me just
[39:35] speak to you from amen the god of the
[39:44] mountains the god of the mountains we
[39:47] love all the Holy Spirit just came from
[39:50] Friday and was just coming nothing great
[39:53] or strange just just reminding us that
[39:56] the same God is
[39:58] here reminding us that there is no big
[40:01] you and small me there is no big one
[40:05] over here with all of the Holy Ghost and
[40:07] you are down here with just a little
[40:09] portion no the Holy Spirit just remind
[40:13] that every one of us have the same God
[40:16] in us he's the same God that spoke to
[40:19] the woman of the well he's the same God
[40:22] that's speaking to us today glory to God
[40:26] amen and so we're going to look at the
[40:28] god of the
[40:32] mountain how beautiful it is that our
[40:34] God can take the worst situations and
[40:38] bring out his glory Our God can take
[40:42] symbols and uh amen and bring them to us
[40:45] and show us the reality of his presence
[40:49] that's how our God hears it is not who
[40:52] you choose but who God chooses
[40:58] Hallelujah glory to God God can look
[41:01] beneath any
[41:03] corruption and she a glorified seed in
[41:07] there beautiful God who is is that right
[41:12] Saints and so this song Amen was
[41:16] actually a song of
[41:18] David but then in Israel you know in
[41:23] Jerusalem every year there would have
[41:26] certain
[41:28] Feast like on the day of Pentecost when
[41:31] the Bible says there were devoted Jews
[41:34] from All Nations because they came back
[41:37] home for this Feast to celebrate this
[41:42] feast and so you know when they would
[41:45] come home amen it was stated in history
[41:49] that this was one of the psalm that they
[41:52] used to chant coming through the Gates
[41:55] of Jerusalem
[41:56] Alem they used to chant it oh we lift up
[42:01] our eyes to the hills because that's
[42:05] where our help come from now they did it
[42:09] now actually they would physically look
[42:13] to the
[42:14] hills because geographically or they
[42:17] stated uh in Israel alone there were
[42:20] like
[42:21] 1,7
[42:23] Mountains located in all of
[42:27] Israel and Jerusalem boasted seven of
[42:32] those
[42:33] mountains glory to
[42:35] God yes and so you couldn't blame them
[42:40] for looking to the hills because they
[42:43] believe that's where their help came
[42:46] from amen oh
[42:49] Hallelujah glory to God and so you
[42:53] remember in the book of even in psalm
[42:56] chapter 68 and verse 16 the writer said
[43:01] David again sing um singing this song He
[43:06] said why leap Ye Ye high hills this is
[43:10] the hill which God desire it to dwell in
[43:15] him yay the Lord will dwell in it
[43:21] forever this is a song by beer
[43:25] forefathers that's it he said God will
[43:28] dwell in this ill forever so they would
[43:32] use mountain and Hill interchangeably in
[43:35] their songs Hills Mountain Hills and so
[43:40] if their forefathers that God dwell on
[43:42] the Hills all the children grow up going
[43:45] to look to the hills so they would look
[43:48] physically to the hills let's go on
[43:50] further The Book of Solomon in his song
[43:54] Solomon chap 2 verse eight he said the
[43:57] voice of my beloved behold he cometh
[44:02] leaping upon the mountains skipping upon
[44:05] the
[44:07] hills Hallelujah glory to God let's go
[44:11] further oh we see amen glory to God even
[44:15] their father Abraham oh it was upon the
[44:19] mount Moria right or a mountain that he
[44:23] would have written and laid out the
[44:25] mirac
[44:27] amen given of a lamb that he used to
[44:31] sacrifice instead of his son when he was
[44:34] on the mountain and the miraculous of
[44:37] the Lamb was presented that was upon the
[44:40] mountain that he saw the Lord Christ the
[44:44] Lamb of God he saw Redemption upon the
[44:49] mountain oh Hallelujah and so much that
[44:53] he called the place Jehovah
[44:58] Gyra it was upon the mountain on the
[45:01] back side of the mountain oh the great
[45:06] prophet

[45:11] it was a miracle he recorded it when he
[45:15] told this amen amen the children of
[45:18] Israel my God Amen came to me in the
[45:23] pillar of fire the Bush was a burning
[45:27] but the fire was Blazing and I heard God
[45:31] spoke to me where on the
[45:36] mountain many of the
[45:39] writings they would have shown that the
[45:42] god of
[45:44] Israel he spoke from the mountains is
[45:48] that right hallah glory to God oh it was
[45:52] upon the mountain again in the
[45:54] wilderness where Moses was given the two
[45:57] tablets of stones with the laws of
[46:01] Israel written by the fingers of God
[46:05] himself Hallelujah dear God on the
[46:08] mountain again Moses got the vision for
[46:13] the pattern of the Tabernacle to be
[46:15] built when God took him took him upon
[46:18] the mountain and showed him the
[46:20] blueprint from Heaven he would have come
[46:24] down and told them
[46:26] I got the vision from a
[46:29] mountain it was already established in
[46:33] the hearts of the generations coming
[46:36] down that your God speaks from a
[46:43] mountain
[46:45] Hallelujah even the prophet bam when he
[46:49] was paid to curse
[46:51] them he Hallelujah he got big money to
[46:55] curse
[46:56] Israel and he stood there and fixed his
[47:00] things properly and laid out his tools
[47:04] ready to curse God's
[47:07] people oh he could have curse them but
[47:10] words of blessing were coming out of his
[47:14] mouth he turned to the king he said I
