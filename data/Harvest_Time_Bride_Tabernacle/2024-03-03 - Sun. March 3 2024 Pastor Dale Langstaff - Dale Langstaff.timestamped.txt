[27:22] are not your
[27:23] thoughts that says a lot neither are my
[27:26] ways your ways sayeth the Lord for as
[27:29] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[27:31] are my ways higher than your ways and my
[27:34] thoughts than your
[27:36] thoughts and as for as the rain cometh
[27:39] down and the snow from heaven and

[27:44] and bringeth maketh it to bring forth
[27:47] and Bud that it may be give seed to the

[28:10] prosper in the thing whever where to I

[28:28] we read James 4
[28:32] 10-12 James
[28:34] 4

[28:40] coats for brother

[28:52] the Lord and He Shall lift you up speak
[28:57] not not evil one of another
[29:00] brethren for he that speaketh evil of
[29:03] his brother and judges his brother
[29:06] speaketh evil of God the
[29:10] law and judges the law but if thou
[29:14] judgest the law Thou Art not a doer of
[29:17] the law but a
[29:19] judge
[29:22] ouch there is one
[29:25] lawgiver just one
[29:28] I love that
[29:30] Hallelujah who is able to
[29:34] save brother Dale and to destroy brother
[29:39] Dale who art thou that judges another
[29:44] Lord Jesus help us to understand your
[29:47] plan and help help me Jesus that I'd be
[29:51] able to to convey your thoughts to what
[29:55] we feasted on Lord Jesus for months Lord

[30:02] statue of the perfect man Lord Jesus and
[30:04] may all our thoughts and all our ideas
[30:07] and all our Creeds that are not of you
[30:09] Lord
[30:11] Jesus fall
[30:13] aside we give you complete control Lord
[30:16] Jesus bless these amazing people Lord
[30:19] God unbelievable that so many would come
[30:22] and drive so
[30:24] far except that they're coming to hear
[30:27] from from you Lord God we clearly
[30:30] understand Lord God we just pray that
[30:33] you'll be the minister the Unseen guests
[30:36] here in our midst Lord Jesus and we give
[30:40] you the glory and the honor for it in
[30:41] your name we pray amen amen you may have
[30:45] your seats and we just love and
[30:46] appreciate everyone and you're just
[30:50] uh amazing to be a part of the family of
[30:53] God you know I just want to bring to
[30:55] your memory and I forgot to mention it
[30:57] Wednesday you know uh I I totally had it
[31:00] in part of my thoughts for Wednesday but
[31:02] uh Wednesday was the 61st
[31:05] anniversary of of Christ coming down in
[31:09] sunset
[31:11] Mountain 61 years since the cloud came
[31:15] down and it's never been the same on
[31:19] Earth he came himself and he has
[31:22] unveiled himself to his wife like never
[31:27] before in the history of the world and
[31:30] and and I just praise God for to live in
[31:34] in this day when God's doing an amazing
[31:38] Ministry God is doing amazing things and
[31:42] you know as we Minister these uh
[31:43] messages and and we're going to go to
[31:46] David and and different ones and David's
[31:48] a huge topic and Moses is a huge topic
[31:51] but we want to understand something this
[31:53] morning Satan is a
[31:55] liar and if you do nothing for God he'll
[31:59] tell you you're not worthy and if you do
[32:02] anything for God he'll tell you you're
[32:04] doing too much amen so we need to just
[32:08] line Satan up in the mirror someday and
[32:10] kick him in the knee like Satan amen
[32:13] because it don't matter how your life
[32:15] lives if you're really dedicated to God
[32:18] he will accuse you and if you're not
[32:20] dedicated to God he will also accuse you
[32:23] amen let's just set that really clear so
[32:26] we don't have to be depressed or run
[32:28] down or or saddened by I didn't do
[32:31] enough or I did too
[32:33] much because God placed in your heart
[32:38] exactly the amount that was supposed to
[32:41] be
[32:42] done
[32:44] hallelujah so there you go
[32:47] Satan I'm right where God wants me I've
[32:50] witness to exactly the people God wanted
[32:53] me to witness to I have not talked to
[32:55] the people that God did not want me
[32:57] talked to you know they never understood
[32:58] Jesus when he went to the pool he only
[33:01] healed one person and they're like oh
[33:03] this God is love what's that what kind
[33:06] of that's like that's like
[33:09] partiality that's God see God is God and
[33:14] we have just brother Dale just has a
[33:16] hard time understanding God because he's
[33:19] just not brother
[33:21] Dale amen so anytime say you know you
[33:25] know when the cloud came down the
[33:27] Believers told Brother Brown they they
[33:29] you know science couldn't understand it
[33:30] the Press couldn't understand it the
[33:32] government couldn't understand
[33:35] it Hallelujah sound familiar and they
[33:39] said you know brother Brown we
[33:41] understand it we know the truth so let's
[33:43] go and tell the government the
[33:46] truth brother brandham considered that
[33:49] and the Holy Spirit told
[33:53] him he said don't throw your pearls
[33:55] before the swine it isn't for for you
[33:57] those are for them it's for you so
[34:00] anytime Satan I just want you to know
[34:02] that anytime Satan says oh you should
[34:03] have talked you know oh we should
[34:06] have you're doing exactly what God
[34:09] wanted you to do because the footsteps
[34:11] of God's predestinated bride righteous
[34:14] are walking just exactly where God wants
[34:17] you to step and you're not out a kilter
[34:19] one bit you're not supposed to have done
[34:21] more or have done less or anything else
[34:25] that Satan is a li
[34:27] here amen hallelujah because in all of
[34:32] our faults God's will is being
[34:35] done that's amazing that should just
[34:38] make you go
[34:40] woohoooo amen that's tremendous now that
[34:44] ain't to take this that you know the the
[34:47] critics will say well you know you're
[34:49] you're making Grace a disgrace and this
[34:51] is
[34:53] hypocritical I don't believe that for
[34:54] the bride for the wife I don't believe
[34:57] that for a dedicated
[35:01] believer oh there will be those
[35:03] Hypocrites around but just let God deal
[35:07] with those Hypocrites God knows your
[35:09] heart God knows your desire you God
[35:12] knows that if if you want he wanted you
[35:14] to do something you'd do it he knows
[35:17] that man we want to look in David here
[35:20] and and I I please forgive me for for
[35:22] our time here because David is a huge
[35:25] one and Moses is the next big one but
[35:27] I'm trying to show you that you're in
[35:30] God's will if you know they ask brother
[35:33] brandom this is just the the the climax
[35:35] of our our whole series as they asked
[35:37] brother Brandman questions and answers
[35:39] in 64 they said who will be there and he
[35:43] said those whose names was in the Lamb's
[35:45] Book of Life before the foundation of
[35:48] the world
[35:51] period
[35:53] period it don't matter if you're a good
[35:55] boy or a good girl
[35:58] I know you don't like that and I don't
[36:01] like it either because I want to think
[36:03] that I had something to do with helping
[36:05] God out I know I know that just say ouch
[36:08] all at the same time ouch
[36:11] oh but es saw Jacob before they were
[36:14] even
[36:15] born God hated one and loved the
[36:19] other they didn't have a lot to do with
[36:21] it before they were
[36:25] born that's a
[36:27] mystery that's a mystery how God could
[36:30] love one and hate because God is
[36:33] omnipotent and he knows the beginning
[36:35] from the end and before those boys had
[36:38] done any witnessing any preaching or any
[36:41] mistakes or any sinning or even were're
[36:43] born to
[36:47] breathe so the next time Satan comes and
[36:49] lies to you and says you should have
[36:51] talked to your neighbor if God wanted
[36:54] you to talk to your neighbor you
[36:55] wouldn't have been able to stop from
[36:57] talking to your neighbor he would have
[36:59] walked you right in you would have had a
[37:02] head-on collision with your neighbor and
[37:04] the first thing you would have said
[37:06] ouch and then you would have started
[37:08] talking we need to have that kind of
[37:10] Faith In Our
[37:12] God because God can bring
[37:15] everything together God will move
[37:19] mountains you know I tell the testimony
[37:22] of my own personal life and this is not
[37:24] edification at all but uh you know one
[37:26] of the first jobs I had in high school
[37:27] when me and the way were courting and uh
[37:30] I needed to go make something
[37:32] right and uh I hadn't done that for many
[37:35] years and God moved mountains that I
[37:36] would buy a farm right next door and
[37:38] shine a line fence with
[37:40] them and mve me right to their
[37:43] doorstep that I could walk in the office
[37:46] and say I have something to make right
[37:48] Satan's a
[37:50] liar uh-huh so just remember Satan's a
[37:54] liar and it's not your brothers and
[37:56] sisters
[37:58] amen so we see here that David in
[38:01] David's life this is a a very long story
[38:03] and and I'm going to try and shoot from
[38:05] the hip and and and just give you some
[38:07] references and and I this is all
[38:09] scripture I I have multiple scriptures
[38:11] here but David had a a half sister and
[38:14] two of her sons were David's right-hand
[38:17] men and they seen joab was one of them
[38:20] in his brother and they seen they were
[38:23] right in David's back pocket as it were
[38:26] to say
[38:27] amen and David was far from an angel but
[38:30] David was God's
[38:32] elect
[38:34] period and they seen all the mistakes
[38:37] that David made and I want to show you
[38:40] how dedicated they were to David now we
[38:43] know when David was running from sa in
[38:46] 1st Samuel 21:12 to15 and I'm not going
[38:48] to read this but David was running he
[38:51] was hiding from the King and when David
[38:52] got to the the foreign King he was
[38:55] afraid for his life and so David pretend
[38:58] to be
[38:59] mad he slobbered at the mouth and acted
[39:02] like he was drunk and out of his mind
[39:04] and had gone mentally
[39:07] incapable now when he did that remember
[39:10] joab was right there
[39:15] watching and he was
[39:19] thinking amen and then we see that David
[39:23] when he became the king he was not the
[39:25] king of all of Israel he was only the
[39:26] king of Judah and Saul's son uh was uh
[39:32] uh ishah and I'm I'm saying that wrong
[39:35] just forgive me but Saul's son take my
[39:37] word for it was the king of the larger
[39:39] part of Israel and that's in 2 Samuel 28
[39:43] to10 and now that you have to remember
[39:47] Saul and his family minus Jonathan hated
[39:54] David I mean they tried to to kill him
[39:57] multiple times and so the most the
[40:00] majority of Israel followed Saul's son
[40:03] and God really anointed elect only a
[40:07] small portion followed it at the
[40:10] beginning for the first two years and so
[40:13] uh Aaron was one of Saul's uh uh
[40:17] followers one of his military men and he
[40:19] spoke to jaab which was uh David's uh
[40:23] right-hand man and he said let's come
[40:25] together their enemies out remember this
[40:28] they're flat out
[40:30] enemies they kill each other enemies
[40:33] they said let's come together and
[40:35] instead of let's play kroo or chess or
[40:37] something like that they said let's just
[40:39] let the men play
[40:41] around and kill each
[40:43] other sounds like the state of the
[40:45] politics in the world today but so they
[40:48] did that now remember they were they
[40:50] were flat outed enemies and then during
[40:53] this time in the beginning of of David's
[40:55] Kingdom the David's Kingdom became
[40:57] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[41:00] Saul's son's Kingdom became weaker and
[41:04] weaker and weaker and so the battle was
[41:07] very sore that day now you now let's
[41:10] let's just give some sympathy to joab
[41:12] here for a minute he was he was risking
[41:15] his
[41:16] neck for
[41:18] David not for
[41:20] God for
[41:22] David
[41:24] uhhuh So if you R your neck for somebody
[41:27] I mean you stand out in front of some
[41:28] bullets you might expect just a little
[41:31] bit of affection or just a little bit of
[41:34] caring or understanding you know what
[41:35] I'm
[41:38] saying and the botle was sore that day
[41:40] and joab his brother was actually killed
[41:44] one of the younger brothers and and that
[41:46] day uh uh David only lost a few men and
[41:51] Saul's son lost I think it was 320 I'm
[41:54] trying to find oh David lost 20 men
[41:56] and Saul's man king Saul's son lost 360
[42:02] men that's in 2 Samuel 2 30 and 31 now
[42:07] that battle that was sore and now now
[42:12] JB's own brother has died and and and
[42:16] and his his comrades had died even 60 of
[42:19] them even though it they had succeeded
[42:21] much greater over Saul's son there
[42:24] wasn't a lot of love Exchange
[42:27] changed and there definitely was no
[42:31] forgiveness
[42:34] amen and we see as the kingdom goes on
[42:37] that uh uh am might say help me out
[42:40] honey a a b n e
[42:43] r Abner sorry thank you so sorry you got
[42:46] a pastor but Abner here was
[42:50] falsely accused from Saul's son and and
[42:53] he was accused that he had actually laid
[42:55] with one of Saul's mess and the hatred
[42:58] began to grow inside the kingdom outside
[43:01] of David's Kingdom amen and it began to
[43:04] grow and so Abner was David's
[43:08] enemy bitter enemy Abner had killed and
[43:13] was responsible for killing he would
[43:16] have killed David but he was responsible
[43:18] for killing David's family and his inner
[43:21] courts
[43:23] hello but because that God had broke
[43:26] down the the the Kingdom on the other
[43:29] side of Israel Abner came and seen David
[43:32] and wanted to make Aion with him now see
[43:36] contrary to your own belief this was in
[43:37] the natural and David was actually
[43:40] making mistakes in the flesh David could
[43:46] die amen this was this was not
[43:50] completely and and so we see remember
[43:52] joab is seeing all these mistakes
[43:56] he's seeing who the enemy is he's seeing
[43:59] who's fighting David and then he's
[44:02] seeing the secret parties in the
[44:07] background and he don't
[44:10] understand because he didn't understand
[44:14] election amen and so Abner came and he
[44:18] made a legion with David and he said
[44:20] listen this this son of Saul that I'm
[44:22] following has falsely accused me and and
[44:26] basically Abner's heart is
[44:29] changing and he comes over to David and
[44:33] you know people are being added to
[44:34] David's Kingdom like the like the church
[44:37] is grown in Abner but see watch this
[44:41] joab didn't care if the kingdom
[44:45] grew in his heart remember this is Old
[44:48] Testament it was an eye for an
[44:51] eye uhuh and so joab said I just soon
[44:56] kill you has talk to
[44:58] you praise God we've moved out of that
[45:01] generation amen uh somewhat um
[45:04] man but here Abner comes and he sees
[45:08] David and David forgives him because he
[45:12] he's a man after God's Own
[45:15] Heart and he lets Abner come right in
[45:18] and be close to his kingdom in his heart
[45:22] and David even throws the party for him
[45:24] now that's in 2 Samuel 3 22 and
[45:27] 25 and watch this now David is throwing
[45:31] a party for
[45:33] Abner at the exact same time and day
[45:37] that his soldiers joab is off fighting
[45:41] for
[45:43] David that didn't go down very
[45:46] good joab came back and heard that Abner
[45:49] had been there and David had let him go
[45:52] in
[45:53] peace and joab said that man's a fool
[45:57] and I'm going to
[45:58] go take care of
[46:03] things see how we think in our
[46:06] mind now the light's
[46:09] changed amen and that that where joab
[46:13] came back and heard that Abner was there
[46:14] was 2 Samuel uh 3:22 and 25 so these are
[46:18] these are all scriptures but this is a
[46:20] long long long story of the the reign of
[46:23] of David here but here here so joab
[46:26] unbeknownst to David he sends messenger
[46:28] after
[46:30] amner and he kills
[46:32] him he tries to be his buddy he said why
[46:35] don't we talk and when Abner gets close
[46:36] to him he kills him the same way now he
[46:39] had a hateful it was an eye for an eye
[46:42] because remember when joab's brother got
[46:44] killed by Abner he got killed under the
[46:47] fifth rib and that's exactly how joab
[46:50] killed Abner was under the fifth rib
[46:54] they never had a very good forgetter at
[46:56] that time and so the the country was in
[47:00] uproar but I'm I'm trying to lay a
[47:02] foundation where where David's inner men
[47:05] were seeing
[47:07] mistakes that they considered they were
[47:10] doing that David was doing but even in
[47:14] David's
[47:19] shortcomings he was still God's
[47:22] elect it's just period
[47:27] that's hard for brother Dale to figure
[47:30] out it's hard for most of us to figure
[47:33] out so here Saul's son in in 2 Samuel
[47:37] 4:8 Saul's son is actually killed by his
[47:40] own uh
[47:41] family he's killed beheaded on his bed
[47:44] and so the kingdom and so now in 2
[47:46] Samuel 5 David takes over his anointed
[47:49] for Kingdom over all of Israel so now
[47:52] it's been a period of duration of a
[47:54] couple years
[47:56] and and uh so now David's Kingdom has
[47:59] grown huge and joab is still David's
[48:03] right-hand
[48:05] man and his brother and now we get to
[48:09] the point where where David the ark
[48:11] David brings the ark back into the the
[48:14] the the into the country you know and
[48:17] you know the I'm just going five 2
[48:19] Samuel 6 is 13-1 17 and uh and here
[48:23] David is such a man of God you know
[48:27] we're here for another
[48:28] reason and that's
[48:31] worship our worship can never be too
[48:34] loud it can never be out of control
[48:37] there's no church order and Doctrine in
[48:41] worship
[48:43] period David completely lost his mind
[48:48] worshiping God just a type just a type
[48:53] of the holy of holies we have the real
[48:56] Holy Ghost here David completely was
[49:01] ston drunk In the
[49:04] Flesh to the point that his wife Saul's
[49:07] daughter looked out and God forbid that
[49:12] well it's not possible it's not possible
[49:15] that a Believer could look out and watch
[49:17] another believer worship and be ashamed
[49:19] that's not possible it's not possible
[49:22] make believer but not a
[49:24] believer there's no way that you could
[49:26] be ashamed of somebody else worshiping I
[49:28] don't care who gets blessed in this
[49:29] church I'm going to move close to you
[49:32] I'm I just just way it is I want your
[49:34] bucket to spill on me if I don't get the
[49:36] bucket spilled myself I want to get the
[49:38] splash off somebody else's bucket amen
[49:41] that's the way God made us and if you're
[49:44] if you're ashamed of
[49:47] that amen and so we know the story
[49:53] how David come back in the house house
[49:55] and and uh you know his wife said why
[49:58] did you have to dance on
[50:02] covered she was
[50:05] humiliated that he was worshiping God
[50:09] and the kingdom seen
[50:12] them he was supposed to have it
[50:20] together and God was so displeased with
[50:23] her in 2 Samuel 6 20 and 23 that she
[50:27] died of old age and never had
[50:30] children God cursed
[50:33] her now that's one of the other men in
[50:36] the
[50:37] Bible that because of worship I'm not
[50:40] promoting this I I have to be careful
[50:42] with my grandkids because they catch me
[50:44] between services and and uh and they
[50:47] quiz me uh uh the the kids were here
[50:51] working on the church and fixed the Bell
[50:52] yesterday and and I went and bought some
[50:54] of them a lunch and and uh something was
[50:58] said about me eating some of the lunch
[51:01] and one of them said well you said you
[51:03] weren't hungry and I said I lied he said
[51:07] well you've been preaching that's
[51:12] okay I said well not just
[51:17] exactly but out to the most the
[51:19] babes he'll make you check your uh
[51:22] motive so in no way are we promoting sin
[51:27] but ain't it a
[51:30] paradox you know God believed in
[51:32] modesty and he had prophets take their
[51:35] clothes off the Bible says that there
[51:37] will be no Liars in heaven and God had
[51:39] His prophets
[51:42] lie you know you can't challenge God you
[51:46] just have to accept it you can say God I
[51:49] don't understand I'm still going to try
[51:51] to do my best but see there's there's
[51:54] one body bottom rote is and we started
[51:57] with that is the devil's a liar and if
[51:59] you're Gods you're still Gods you know
[52:03] let me interject something
[52:08] here I don't expect you to get the
[52:10] effect that it affected me but this week
[52:14] I
[52:16] got one of my first video calls where
[52:20] you could see the
[52:21] picture of the person that was calling
[52:24] me I've never answered one in my life I
[52:27] know that shows I'm but I
[52:30] hardly knew how to answer
[52:33] it
[52:35] and when I got off the video call I
[52:39] thought that's like God talking to
[52:42] us and you know there was a beautiful
[52:44] little girl on the other side of the
[52:45] video call she was innocent
[52:50] young happy bouncy pure I said there's
[52:54] no no way in the world I can portray my
[52:57] love for that little
[53:00] girl there's no way it's
[53:04] impossible and we got have Jehovah God
[53:06] in
[53:07] heaven and he said I'm up here in heaven
[53:09] there's no way I can portray my love to
[53:12] you when Satan's telling you you're no
[53:15] good you're a loser you made a mistake
[53:18] you dropped the ball there's no way how
[53:21] could God portray his love to you when
[53:24] we got ears listening to Satan saying yo
[53:26] you should have done more you should
[53:28] have did this you should have did that
[53:30] or you did way too
[53:32] much God help us God help us to help God
[53:36] understand that he gave everything he
[53:38] was you came from him he tore himself
[53:41] apart to put himself together and you
[53:45] were the part that he put back together
[53:47] that's some that's more than Amazing
[53:49] Grace that's that's how sweet to sound
[53:52] they saved The Loser Like Me Halle
[53:55] Hallelujah that he literally in the Old
[53:57] Testament he ripped the animals apart
[53:59] and as the animals came back together I
[54:01] was the part that was useless I was the
[54:04] part that was ripped apart but I came
[54:06] back together just like the jogged
[54:08] Covenant and there was nothing nobody
[54:11] could ever
[54:13] do to break that amazing Covenant here
[54:17] here's God he's looking in a video call
[54:19] down to Heaven he said there's my
[54:21] beautiful wife bride oh man I love love
[54:27] her how can you portray and accept that
[54:32] amazing
[54:35] love Hallelujah God help us God help us
[54:39] he gave us everything including
[54:43] himself to help us to understand and I
[54:47] believe God in this series gave us
[54:49] something else he gave us a whole bunch
[54:52] of his Believers elect bride and they
[54:55] didn't make mistakes because God was
[54:57] happy they made mistakes but they made
[55:00] mistakes to show that there's maybe hope
[55:02] for brother Dale there just there's a
[55:05] slim
[55:06] chance that in all the mistakes that
[55:08] everybody else
[55:13] made that if you were his before the
[55:15] foundation of the world there ain't
[55:18] nobody there ain't no Pope or priest or
[55:21] fivefold
[55:23] nothing can take that from you
[55:27] Hallelujah
[55:29] amazing we see here and uh in David's
[55:33] life
[55:34] here David showed kindness to a King uh
[55:39] and I I'm sorry I have to spell some of
[55:41] these words just weren't made for me but
[55:43] h a n u n and he showed kindness to this
[55:48] King and and uh and this King had fought
[55:52] against
[55:53] David and here it was was
[55:56] joab that had do the fighting and see
[56:00] David actually did make mistakes believe
[56:03] it or not you know as part of the elect
[56:06] part of the
[56:07] Bride she will make
[56:10] mistakes amen that don't change one
[56:14] thing it wouldn't matter you know you
[56:16] know brother Brown talked about it when
[56:18] he went to the mission Fielder when
[56:19] you're married to your sweetheart and
[56:21] she is your rib it makes no difference
[56:24] what mistakes my wife make it makes no
[56:26] difference at
[56:29] all absolutely
[56:31] none cuz it can never change that she's
[56:34] my
[56:35] rib it would it would make no difference
[56:38] you can every thought that comes through
[56:39] your mind it wouldn't make no
[56:42] difference and that's how God looks at
[56:44] us amen and here we see a joab is doing
[56:49] the fighting and then we see here that
[56:51] joab is away fighting this King that
[56:54] David had showed kindness to you can see
[56:57] where envy and bitterness would rise
[57:00] up and while joab is away fighting the
[57:03] king that David showed kindness
[57:05] to David sleeps with Bap
[57:10] Sheba johab knew everything about
[57:14] that it was
[57:16] johab that took the letter back for the
[57:21] death of
[57:23] Uriah
[57:25] you see what I'm saying he was right in
[57:29] David's back
[57:31] pocket he seen David make a and he's
[57:35] actually risking his
[57:37] neck at the same time David's laying
[57:41] with people he's not supposed to lay
[57:44] with and those people were risking their
[57:46] neck too and I will never understand on
[57:50] this Earth i' be I'm sure I mean I just
[57:54] can't imagine how I can understand how
[57:56] uah's family could sit under David's
[58:02] Ministry brother Dale couldn't do it in
[58:05] the
[58:09] flesh that's that's an amazing God I I I
[58:13] don't know how to explain that but it
[58:17] was amen and so we see here there's
[58:20] scriptures for all this but in 2 Samuel
[58:23] 11:14 to18 here's David wrote joab and
[58:27] sent the letter back to kill Uriah he he
[58:29] knows
[58:31] everything and and to to tell you how
[58:33] bad it is when when UAH dies joab sends
[58:37] a messenger to David and says it was a
[58:40] mistake he shouldn't have died he just
[58:42] got a little bit too close and the
[58:44] enemy's arrows caught him you know what
[58:46] David's response
[58:51] was come and go a few die a few arrows
[58:57] hit and you rise
[59:01] like is this the guy I'm supposed to be
[59:07] following he's seeing
[59:11] David here here where he shoots uh Uriah
[59:15] is in 2 Samuel 11:24 and 25 and and and
[59:18] he s maybe we'll read this in
[59:21] 24 he says the shooter shot Off the Wall
[59:24] unto thy servants and some of the king's
[59:27] servants are dead and thy servant Uriah
[59:30] of the Hittites is dead also and when
[59:32] David said to the messeng he said Thou
[59:34] shalt say unto joab let let not this
[59:37] thing displease thee oh well big deal
[59:41] Somebody went to hell no big
[59:45] deal and joab's
[59:47] like
[59:53] wow I'm I'm trying to lay it I'm trying
[59:55] to play you a play in your mind that
[59:58] joab could not
[1:00:01] understand joab could not understand and
[1:00:05] I'm also going to show you something
[1:00:08] joab was not
[1:00:16] wrong he was not
[1:00:19] wrong when people do stuff like this
[1:00:21] joab's
[1:00:23] like
[1:00:32] wow he said let not this thing displease
[1:00:35] you for the sword devours one as well as
[1:00:38] another make thy V battle more strong
[1:00:40] against the city and overthrow it and he
[1:00:43] encouraged johab you see joab was
[1:00:46] faithful to David even in his
[1:00:52] wrongs that's murder
[1:00:55] am
[1:00:57] man here joab fought against uh uh he he
[1:01:02] this will really show you in 2 Samuel
[1:01:05] 12:26 and 28 it will show you how
[1:01:08] dedicated joab was to David because joab
[1:01:13] could have took the Kingdom from
[1:01:16] David because he was that much of a hero
[1:01:19] joab fought against the Rahab the
[1:01:21] children of the amorites and he took the
[1:01:24] the Royal City and jaab sent a letter
[1:01:27] this is verse 27 jaab sent a letter
[1:01:29] Messengers to David and said I have
[1:01:31] fought against Rahab and I have taken
[1:01:33] the city of waters and now there is for
[1:01:37] now therefore gather the rest of the
[1:01:39] people together and encamp against the
[1:01:41] city and take it
[1:01:43] lest lest I take the city and the people
[1:01:47] call it after
[1:01:50] me I tell you what I wouldn't mind
[1:01:53] having joab in in the
[1:01:55] church I have a whole bunch of
[1:01:58] them he
[1:02:00] was Joe joab wasn't do you see what I'm
[1:02:04] saying the people would have fell down
[1:02:06] and worship
[1:02:07] joab for being the hero and he goes
[1:02:10] behind the scene to his favorite
[1:02:12] Minister and says listen you come in and
[1:02:14] make it look like you're the
[1:02:17] hero whoa now that's loyalty boys and
[1:02:21] girls that's real loyalty
[1:02:33] and then we see Absalon stole the heart
[1:02:35] of David's Kingdom and he planted at the
[1:02:38] door and so David's own family rose up
[1:02:41] within him that was that was one of the
[1:02:43] payments for David's uh sins mistakes
[1:02:46] was God told him that the sword would
[1:02:48] never leave your
[1:02:50] household and joab still fought for for
[1:02:54] David I'm I'm trying to show you how
[1:02:57] unbalanced this was but how balanced God
[1:03:00] was amen and so absolon comes up and and
[1:03:04] David did here show the heart of of God
[1:03:08] where even though his David actually
[1:03:09] fled from his kingdom and
[1:03:13] uh and uh and when they went to fight
[1:03:17] against his son David assured the people
[1:03:20] he saido not kill them now he would have
[1:03:24] killed David in a heartbeat he would
[1:03:26] have killed David if he would have
[1:03:27] stayed
[1:03:30] there but joab couldn't follow his
[1:03:35] orders because joab was so dedicated to
[1:03:40] David even though David said don't kill
[1:03:42] my son joab said listen I fought for you
[1:03:45] my whole
[1:03:46] life and you're still the
[1:03:49] king and anybody that challenges the
[1:03:53] king is is going to fall on my
[1:03:55] sword and so joab kills David's son and
[1:04:01] David's mourning here and and that and
[1:04:03] then we see
[1:04:05] here that David is mourning so much for
[1:04:09] his son I know this is hard to believe
[1:04:12] but in this case it was actually his
[1:04:13] enemy because they God had raised them
[1:04:16] up to give David for for David's
[1:04:19] mistakes and his sins and joab comes
[1:04:22] into the king and this is in second Sam
[1:04:24] 19:5 and8 and he says if you keep on
[1:04:27] crying for your enemy you're going to
[1:04:29] lose the whole
[1:04:33] Kingdom now there's joab again
[1:04:37] protecting
[1:04:39] David he's protect he's he he's not
[1:04:42] saying I'm going to take the kingdom
[1:04:43] he's saying it's
[1:04:46] yours it's yours and here he said th and
[1:04:49] you know you well just for time we're
[1:04:52] you know and here David gets some
[1:04:54] himself together David gets himself
[1:04:56] composed and goes out and greets the
[1:04:58] people whose credit was
[1:05:00] that
[1:05:04] joab and David's kingdom is restored
[1:05:06] back to him in 2 Samuel
[1:05:09] 19-5 and joab saw all these
[1:05:13] mistakes but God still respected
[1:05:17] David and joab and his
[1:05:21] brother God killed
[1:05:28] when David died he talked to his son
[1:05:30] Solomon and you can read that I have
[1:05:31] multiple scriptures
[1:05:33] here ain't that a
[1:05:36] paradox I'm trying to encourage you that
[1:05:39] don't believe the lie of the devil that
[1:05:42] he says well you know bless God you did
[1:05:44] this wrong God don't even see
[1:05:48] it you know what what was justified as
[1:05:52] if you never the real me never even did
[1:05:54] that that's how the prophet taught it I
[1:05:57] I know we we struggle to believe that
[1:05:59] you see the thing is this gospel that we
[1:06:02] we know is the truth this this word of
[1:06:04] God that we know is you never did
[1:06:07] nothing I don't like that
[1:06:11] word
[1:06:17] nothing to come to God nothing at all
[1:06:21] you never made one good decision to come
[1:06:23] to God
[1:06:24] you think oh yeah I did I bless God I oh
[1:06:27] bless God I picked my parents in the
[1:06:28] beginning of the
[1:06:31] earth oh bless God I chose to serve God
[1:06:34] no you
[1:06:38] did we don't like
[1:06:40] that because you know we think well like
[1:06:44] I I get showered up and put on my robe
[1:06:47] and bless God no you didn't do nothing
[1:06:50] you wouldn't even have done that bless
[1:06:52] God was
[1:06:56] it was like the kids threading the chain
[1:06:58] in from the bow we had the whole town
[1:07:00] watching us as we were up there now
[1:07:02] we're pulling the old rope out the sun
[1:07:04] had ate the rope and the sun won't eat
[1:07:06] the chain now I mean we'll all be in
[1:07:08] another place before the chain the sun
[1:07:10] eats and we're fishing it through
[1:07:12] fishing it through all the conduit
[1:07:14] through the attic to bring it down here
[1:07:15] so we can ring the bell to wake the town
[1:07:20] up we had we had people in the town that
[1:07:22] you were to walk by go back to their
[1:07:24] house and come back and walk by and stay
[1:07:25] in the street and talk to us wait wait
[1:07:27] to talk to
[1:07:29] us
[1:07:31] uhhuh live me a
[1:07:33] sermon man they're watching I had people
[1:07:37] thank me up town I actually had one of
[1:07:39] the tillers at the bank thank me for
[1:07:41] fixing the old church that she used to
[1:07:42] go to not letting it fall
[1:07:47] down so God has all
[1:07:51] different
[1:07:52] uhuh he's going to have his wife in the
[1:07:55] Kingdom but then we're going to have
[1:07:57] people cooking the food to bring it to
[1:08:00] us they're called servants you won't
[1:08:03] have to run the vacuum in heaven the
[1:08:06] Jews will be doing that
[1:08:09] 144,000 amen right and then you got all
[1:08:13] those people in heaven that were good to
[1:08:14] the bride like they'll be there too
[1:08:16] maybe they'll be uh I don't know picking
[1:08:18] the honey in case I get stung by the
[1:08:20] bees because I don't want to get stung
[1:08:22] they'll just bring me the honey minus
[1:08:24] the
[1:08:25] Beast well it's going to be a
[1:08:28] kingdom go God's not no foolish person
[1:08:31] he's got people operating it it ain't
[1:08:33] going to be his wife doing it she's the
[1:08:40] queen
[1:08:42] Hallelujah ain't it amazing and David's
[1:08:45] Kingdom
[1:08:46] see and God gave the testimony for David
[1:08:50] that he was a man after his own
[1:08:52] heart
[1:08:55] and if you were
[1:09:01] joab you'd say well maybe you should
[1:09:04] talk to
[1:09:08] me amen see how God is God you go you
[1:09:12] can't take away God's
[1:09:15] elect it was God that chose amen it was
[1:09:19] God that's omnipotent not us let's move
[1:09:22] forward to Acts n and and we'll look at
[1:09:25] Saul Paul here and Paul's going around
[1:09:27] persecuting the Christians now and and
[1:09:30] and we'll see here in in Acts 15 acts
[1:09:33] 9:15 sorry acts 9:15 here that God said
[1:09:37] that saw this
[1:09:39] murderer that would go to the government
[1:09:41] and get permission to murder the
[1:09:43] Believers flat
[1:09:45] out like that's
[1:09:49] extreme he said he's My Chosen
[1:09:52] vessel don't sound like much chosen to
[1:09:55] me I'd be hiding from God's
[1:09:58] chosen to stay
[1:10:01] alive and that's exactly like the
[1:10:03] Apostle did the who was it that God sent
[1:10:06] to go see Saul honey the a an a an i
[1:10:12] as ananas who would pick a word like
[1:10:15] that nobody could read ananas here God
[1:10:19] sends a to go to ananas he goes in his
[1:10:23] thoughts and he says I want you to go by
[1:10:26] and see saw and
[1:10:29] Annas he's a
[1:10:33] Believer but he wasn't sure God
[1:10:37] was right he said well God we maybe
[1:10:42] should
[1:10:42] talk like because you got a bad memory
[1:10:46] maybe I'll remind
[1:10:49] you sounds like
[1:10:51] me God did you forget that this person
[1:10:55] you want me to go
[1:10:57] see Cuts people's heads
[1:11:02] off are you
[1:11:05] sure and God's
[1:11:08] like it's no problem I chose him he said
[1:11:13] chose
[1:11:14] him there's no way I'm sitting in that
[1:11:22] church amen
[1:11:24] you know how that story
[1:11:26] goes look at the
[1:11:30] prophet who God told to marry the
[1:11:35] Harlot now those were Old Testament
[1:11:39] prophets now what are you going to now
[1:11:42] they're living in the Old Testament what
[1:11:43] was that prophet's name
[1:11:45] honey H oos
[1:11:48] EA
[1:11:51] Hosea now he's living the Old Testament
[1:11:54] law so what are you going to do with the
[1:11:56] law where a prophetess Mary a
[1:12:01] virgin God just broke his own
[1:12:05] law but God can't break his own
[1:12:12] law
[1:12:15] but
[1:12:16] uhhuh he tells them to go marry a wh and
[1:12:19] they have three kids two sons and a
[1:12:20] daughter and God tells them the name of
[1:12:22] every one of those kids
[1:12:26] there's no other way to explain that
[1:12:29] than it's an omnipotent God in
[1:12:34] election in an
[1:12:36] election you
[1:12:38] know let's just look at Moses for a
[1:12:42] minute
[1:12:43] here now we see Moses was living in a
[1:12:47] terrible country a persecution it'd be
[1:12:51] like being a Believer and being in North
[1:12:52] Korea or something like that I couldn't
[1:12:55] imagine couldn't imagine if you think
[1:12:57] you're hard done by just watch some
[1:12:59] video online under Kim Jones rule it's
[1:13:02] unbelievable those PE people are treated
[1:13:04] worse than our cats just they're treated
[1:13:08] worse than our
[1:13:10] rats unbelievable that just makes me
[1:13:13] lose sleep at night God have mercy on
[1:13:15] them the only thing that'll save them is
[1:13:17] a Rapture I mean those people are that's
[1:13:21] just
[1:13:22] wrong God made men and man made slaves
[1:13:27] that's disgusting and I mean there's
[1:13:29] lots of examples of that around the
[1:13:30] world even in our own
[1:13:32] country we with the Windsor border have
[1:13:35] probably the biggest sex tra in North
[1:13:38] America that's disgusting that's just
[1:13:41] that's just that's just hell coming up
[1:13:45] and brother Dale and us and we have to
[1:13:47] go up too we have to keep going up
[1:13:50] because hell's coming up and God's going
[1:13:52] to raise up a standard and that's going
[1:13:54] to be the Rapture he's going to take us
[1:13:56] home CU we can't live here no longer
[1:13:58] it's just not
[1:14:00] safe but Moses was living in a kind of
[1:14:02] world like that and the King come out
[1:14:05] and said now we're going to kill all the
[1:14:07] baby boys under
[1:14:08] two now that was
[1:14:13] Al now I would be considering getting a
[1:14:15] Visa in another
[1:14:19] country that wasn't an
[1:14:21] option so what do you do if you're the
[1:14:27] elect in God's plan Satan can never
[1:14:31] break God's plan Moses should have never
[1:14:35] have
[1:14:37] lived there was actually by human sight
[1:14:40] Moses could have never have
[1:14:43] lived amen here here his mother he got
[1:14:47] so baked that his mother couldn't hide
[1:14:49] him well first off in Exodus 2:1 Moses
[1:14:53] Moses was born and he was a goodly child
[1:14:55] and and they hit him in verse three and
[1:14:58] they pitched him in an arc which I mean
[1:15:02] I I know we read it and and we know the
[1:15:04] end of the story so we say oh well that
[1:15:06] was a great idea no that was the most
[1:15:08] stupidest idea you ever did hear or tell
[1:15:10] of there was crocodiles in that
[1:15:16] River like there's not a lot of
[1:15:18] difference between getting eaten by a
[1:15:20] crocodile and getting a spear in your
[1:15:22] chest
[1:15:26] but
[1:15:28] God see that it's just God just changes
[1:15:31] everything and so here a mother just
[1:15:33] does her heart and you know
[1:15:37] what did God tell
[1:15:41] her nope it's never recorded that God
[1:15:45] told her anything see now there let's go
[1:15:48] back to that liar the Devil he's telling
[1:15:50] you oh you should have did that oh you
[1:15:52] should have did did that says
[1:15:56] who you don't want to talk to that liar
[1:15:59] the devil you're doing exactly without
[1:16:02] in your whole you don't even realize
[1:16:05] you're doing God's will and you woke
[1:16:07] up amen you think oh I made a decision
[1:16:11] no that was God's decision amen you see
[1:16:14] what I'm saying Moses mom made decisions
[1:16:17] that God never told her to make and it
[1:16:19] was just out of the love of her heart
[1:16:21] and she's putting this thing together
[1:16:23] and God's just like moving the chest
[1:16:28] Pond and I was like oh I had a lot to do
[1:16:30] I won the
[1:16:35] oh Hallelujah she makes an ark and
[1:16:39] pitches it and puts the Ark in the in
[1:16:41] with the crocodiles and she thinks oh
[1:16:43] this is going to be great no she didn't
[1:16:46] think this was going to be great she was
[1:16:48] ripping her heart right out of her chest
[1:16:52] to let go of that Arc
[1:16:54] and with
[1:16:55] crocodiles that baby would need
[1:16:57] breastfed within an hour or two at the
[1:17:00] most I mean it was that was in watch
[1:17:03] church that was
[1:17:07] insanity but that was
[1:17:10] God you know what there'll be things
[1:17:12] that God tells you to
[1:17:17] do y and it will seem like
[1:17:20] insanity probably the devil told you
[1:17:22] that when when you woke up to drive here
[1:17:24] this morning especially your brothers
[1:17:25] and sisters that drove an hour and a
[1:17:27] half 2 hours like the devil's like are
[1:17:29] you out of your mind do you know the
[1:17:30] price of gas I mean do you know that
[1:17:33] they have internet do you know do you
[1:17:36] know there's a church that you would buy
[1:17:37] probably 100 churches to
[1:17:40] drive Insanity insan complete
[1:17:47] Insanity you don't think those people
[1:17:49] had the same battle back then oh yeah oh
[1:17:53] oh yeah and here Moses mother out of
[1:17:57] compassion sent the daughter along to
[1:17:59] watch how it would go and it didn't go
[1:18:03] well at
[1:18:04] all cuz the baby started crying oh you
[1:18:08] thought I was going to say it went well
[1:18:09] no no no can you imagine the mother's
[1:18:12] heart when she heard Moses crying down
[1:18:14] the river oh it what what that was
[1:18:17] saying is crocodiles I'm over
[1:18:20] here I'm
[1:18:21] lunch
[1:18:23] I'm just the
[1:18:27] appetizer that mother's heart was just
[1:18:30] like a semi truck in her
[1:18:36] chest Moses shut up Moses shut up it's
[1:18:41] like some of the mothers when they
[1:18:43] they're in church and the baby Christ
[1:18:44] they said shut up the preach everybody's
[1:18:46] going to look at me everybody's looking
[1:18:48] at me I wish You' shut
[1:18:51] up
[1:18:54] but there's no crocodiles in
[1:19:00] church and God touched A murderer's
[1:19:04] daughter's
[1:19:06] heart amen see if he did it then he's
[1:19:10] the same God today we don't have to fear
[1:19:13] none of this politics stuff or anything
[1:19:15] and and I tell you what you know we have
[1:19:18] thoughts about all our life and you know
[1:19:20] where we're going to live in the pretty
[1:19:22] house and the you know the apple trees
[1:19:24] that never produced apples with worms in
[1:19:27] it and all this stuff that'll be in the
[1:19:32] Millennium but it's never what you
[1:19:35] think and the CIA is behind everything
[1:19:38] it don't matter who wins the election in
[1:19:40] November the CIA has murdered more
[1:19:42] people than Hitler did a 100 times
[1:19:45] over do you want to think so I can show
[1:19:47] you 100 videos to prove
[1:19:51] that and it didn't matter if if it was
[1:19:53] Republican or Democrat the CIA are
[1:19:59] murderers I'm not afraid to say that if
[1:20:01] they come take my neck you'll know where
[1:20:03] I'm at I'm in glory I'm not in the CIA
[1:20:06] s
[1:20:10] amen and here God took a murderer's
[1:20:14] daughter and he fell in love with this
[1:20:17] little baby that's not
[1:20:19] smiling oh you thought he was smil he
[1:20:21] looks so cute no he's
[1:20:25] wailing he's
[1:20:27] wailing and she made have fall in love
[1:20:29] and of course you know the story how the
[1:20:31] daughter went up and said hey you know
[1:20:32] back then they never had grocery stores
[1:20:34] with formula that we know of and he said
[1:20:36] would you like me to get a mother nurse
[1:20:38] mother for him and and of course that's
[1:20:41] what they needed and she went and in the
[1:20:44] trial of murder and losing her family
[1:20:48] she got paid to raise her own kid
[1:20:53] now that's better than being a real flat
[1:20:55] out mother I mean and not only did she
[1:20:58] get paid to raise the baby but she got
[1:21:01] to take the baby
[1:21:04] [Laughter]
[1:21:06] home and you thought you had
[1:21:10] troubles here's the murderer's daughter
[1:21:12] said I need a nursemate she get some
[1:21:15] Mother's mom said you can take the baby
[1:21:17] and I'll pay you wages she and by the
[1:21:20] way I'm going to say that again and she
[1:21:21] said and you can take take the
[1:21:26] baby and I will pay you wages to take
[1:21:30] care of your own son now that that's
[1:21:35] the that's almost as good as a baby
[1:21:40] bonus
[1:21:42] amen see how God in
[1:21:45] election why thousands of millions of
[1:21:49] babies were dying how many male babies
[1:21:51] under 2 years old would would be born in
[1:21:53] a group of people that were 2
[1:21:56] million
[1:21:58] 100,000 200,000 in two
[1:22:02] years all
[1:22:05] dead but
[1:22:07] election all dead but election what did
[1:22:11] she do to have that election
[1:22:14] nothing absolutely nothing and then we
[1:22:17] look at Moses in his later years and and
[1:22:20] and I want to show you something else in
[1:22:22] in we're doing you are amazing to preach
[1:22:25] to I just God bless you but I want to
[1:22:27] show you something this is I just want
[1:22:30] to show you something in the scriptures
[1:22:33] and you can make up your own
[1:22:36] decision but it's recorded multiple
[1:22:38] times in the
[1:22:39] Bible and you can decide for yourself
[1:22:43] but don't tell
[1:22:45] me but I'm going to show you what God
[1:22:48] put in the
[1:22:49] word in numbers 121 to5 and don't ask me
[1:22:53] to read all that but in 1 to 15 here God
[1:22:58] tells Moses to
[1:23:00] marry an Ethiopian
[1:23:03] woman and Ethiopian women are
[1:23:08] black Jewish people are not
[1:23:13] black and Moses sister and brother
[1:23:17] mocked Moses for doing
[1:23:21] that and this this is all in numbers 121
[1:23:24] to15 and you know the story better than
[1:23:27] I know the
[1:23:28] story but God came to Moses
[1:23:31] sister and he said now do you realize
[1:23:35] that Moses is
[1:23:39] elect that's why there's scriptures in
[1:23:41] the Bible where you touch not my
[1:23:42] anointed he said here's God coming and
[1:23:45] he's saying to Moses sister he says do
[1:23:47] you realize that I talk to Moses lip to
[1:23:58] ear and you said uhhuh
[1:24:07] what and God cursed Moses sister with
[1:24:13] Leprosy which is a type of Eternal
[1:24:15] separation in the Bible because she
[1:24:17] mocked what God told his servant to do
[1:24:25] amen
[1:24:27] now and do you know who had to pray that
[1:24:30] God would lift the curse off of his
[1:24:34] sister the very person that got mocked
[1:24:39] Moses and Moses prayed that God would
[1:24:41] lift the curse off his sister and they
[1:24:45] never moved the camp until her leprosy
[1:24:48] even even God what maybe we got a we got
[1:24:51] some time we got to read this here and I
[1:24:55] when well I you can find this in the
[1:24:57] scripture but I'll tell you from memory
[1:24:59] when David when when when Moses went to
[1:25:01] God and said now God you know my sister
[1:25:04] didn't know what she was doing and she
[1:25:05] laughed at your decision for me to marry
[1:25:07] aath the open woman you know what God
[1:25:10] Said whoa whoa whoa wait a minute
[1:25:14] Moses I might answer your prayer but she
[1:25:17] deserves a
[1:25:18] spanking
[1:25:21] anyway
[1:25:23] well that's what he says in the
[1:25:24] scriptures you can read it I'm not
[1:25:25] making this up he says even though you
[1:25:27] want me to lift the curse she deserves
[1:25:29] that leprosy for
[1:25:32] like a week CU I'm going to teach her a
[1:25:36] lesson bless God and then I'll answer
[1:25:39] your
[1:25:42] prayer that's a god of
[1:25:45] Mercy but his
[1:25:48] Mercy was short when it came against his
[1:25:55] amen that's one place I don't want to be
[1:25:58] guilty of going
[1:26:01] just I'm not going to go there I'm not
[1:26:04] going to throw any apples that God's
[1:26:07] elect because I don't want
[1:26:11] leprosy amen and just along that line I
[1:26:14] want to show you something that's in the
[1:26:16] scripture and I'm not preaching Doctrine
[1:26:18] you can make your own conclusion I'm
[1:26:21] just saying it's in the Bible
[1:26:24] so Moses married an Ethiopian
[1:26:27] woman an Ethiopian are black people
[1:26:31] Moses was like
[1:26:34] myself Abraham's concubine Hagar was a
[1:26:37] black
[1:26:38] woman and when Sarah died Abraham's
[1:26:41] first wife he married his second wife
[1:26:43] which was I can't say her name but it
[1:26:45] started with the K thank you and she was
[1:26:50] also a black woman
[1:26:55] Ruth was a moabit which is half Jew and
[1:26:59] half Gentile which is half black and she
[1:27:01] married Boaz and that's why it's
[1:27:04] recorded in the Bible that David was Ro
[1:27:07] Ry that's actually the color of his
[1:27:13] skin that's not little on
[1:27:21] statue
[1:27:23] so anybody that thinks that God cares
[1:27:25] about the color of your
[1:27:26] skin needs to read the
[1:27:29] Bible because that's five
[1:27:33] examples and God actually come through
[1:27:36] those
[1:27:37] lineages now I have stacks of notes and
[1:27:41] I spent whole days searching this out
[1:27:44] and Googling
[1:27:46] it I have pictures on my
[1:27:49] phone to prove what these nationalities
[1:27:51] look like
[1:27:52] matter of fact even you know even Joshua
[1:27:55] when he sent the spies to Rahab in the
[1:27:58] wall in Jericho do you know that he sent
[1:28:01] Half Breed people in to the spies so
[1:28:04] they would blend and not stand out in
[1:28:06] Jericho because the people were a
[1:28:09] different
[1:28:14] color
[1:28:19] amen God help us
[1:28:23] God help us let's move down faster and
[1:28:26] and we're doing better than I dreamed
[1:28:29] amen Judah and Tamar now Judah was a
[1:28:34] descendant of Jacob now Jacob is a
[1:28:36] patriarch I mean it was the 12 apostles
[1:28:40] amen and judah's wife died and Tamar was
[1:28:45] a little girl that had married judah's
[1:28:47] son and he was the Bible says a very
[1:28:50] Wicked Man I I don't understand that
[1:28:53] either how does the lineage from Jacob
[1:28:57] go to to uh to to Judah and and his sons
[1:29:02] be extremely Wicked people I I don't
[1:29:04] understand how that does but that's what
[1:29:06] the Bible says and so he was a very
[1:29:08] Wicked Man and God took his
[1:29:10] life but the people in the church didn't
[1:29:12] understand why God did
[1:29:15] that like Judah and so he gave him his
[1:29:18] next son because that was the law that
[1:29:20] the son would raise up seed for the
[1:29:21] first son son and that son refused to
[1:29:24] raise up seed for his older son and so
[1:29:27] he did an evil thing in the sight of God
[1:29:29] and God killed him too now I'm
[1:29:31] paraphrasing for all you adults but if
[1:29:33] you want to know in private we can spell
[1:29:36] it
[1:29:38] out and Judah is now God's
[1:29:43] elect but the communications in his
[1:29:45] internet it was a rainy day and it was
[1:29:48] just off a little bit when he was
[1:29:49] talking to God and he he said now that
[1:29:53] little
[1:29:54] girl hey let me throw this in here this
[1:29:57] is a free one time out this is free one
[1:30:00] you know we were out a
[1:30:01] feed Thing Up by kenel sometime and
[1:30:05] there was a person from I don't know the
[1:30:08] other side of the world and she was
[1:30:09] telling you how to do your will
[1:30:13] inheritance and she did Big inheritance
[1:30:15] farms and the problem is with Farmers
[1:30:17] that get really wealthy they don't know
[1:30:19] how to pass it on to their kids and
[1:30:21] normally
[1:30:22] the kids actually get married and the
[1:30:24] parents are prejudiced to their son and
[1:30:26] they don't want the the daughter-in-law
[1:30:28] to get all this money and blah blah blah
[1:30:32] blah and this lady said something that I
[1:30:36] never forgotten she said you know when
[1:30:39] we te talk to these rich Old Farmers
[1:30:41] that are about ready to
[1:30:42] die and they're afraid to pass it on to
[1:30:45] their family they say well that
[1:30:47] daughter-in-law of mine bless God she's
[1:30:49] only in it for the money
[1:30:53] he said you know what I tell
[1:30:55] them he said you fat old farmer he said
[1:30:59] ' did you ever think your second
[1:31:00] girlfriend was go in for the
[1:31:04] money he said she's in for the money
[1:31:07] more than your daughter-in-law is your
[1:31:09] daughter-in-law is having your son's
[1:31:11] kids but your girlfriend's just getting
[1:31:13] a free ride on the gold
[1:31:18] dream I don't think she won a lot of
[1:31:20] votes from the fat old Farmers but
[1:31:22] you see what I mean so here Judah said
[1:31:24] now that Tamar she's my daughter-in-law
[1:31:28] but she's a witch bless God she's a
[1:31:31] witch she's Put a Spell on my two
[1:31:36] son-in-laws I'm going to keep my
[1:31:38] distance from her I'm going to use the
[1:31:40] sword of the
[1:31:46] spirit and I'm going to keep my third
[1:31:48] son because I want to have some kind of
[1:31:50] Heritage to hold on the Lang St name I'm
[1:31:53] just
[1:31:55] paraphrasing amen this is in Genesis 38
[1:31:59] 6- 26 now if we read all these
[1:32:02] scriptures we'd be here a month from now
[1:32:04] and I'm trying to finish this topic
[1:32:05] because there is other things in the
[1:32:07] Bible to
[1:32:11] preach and so Judah wouldn't give the
[1:32:14] next daughter son to Tamar because she
[1:32:18] had a spell on
[1:32:19] her and she had nothing to
[1:32:22] do with the son's dying the Bible says
[1:32:27] that and
[1:32:30] so the son was ready to come to Tamar
[1:32:34] but he was not
[1:32:35] given so Tamar dressed like a
[1:32:40] and stood on the road where those
[1:32:44] kind of people
[1:32:45] stand and she had heard that her
[1:32:49] father-in-law was going to go to town
[1:32:55] this is unbelievable I talked to lean
[1:32:57] for days on this
[1:32:59] one and judah's going to town and he
[1:33:02] sees some horse and he
[1:33:08] says what Bible's that
[1:33:11] in that's got to be the new a
[1:33:13] international version that is no way the
[1:33:16] Bible I'm
[1:33:18] reading oh what kind of a world does
[1:33:22] Judah have the right to go to town and
[1:33:24] look at
[1:33:26] prostitutes and have those kind of
[1:33:32] thoughts it's in here and I need some
[1:33:39] therapy and so judah's wife had died so
[1:33:43] you could say that you know he was a
[1:33:45] widow and that's only if he didn't have
[1:33:47] multiple wives that weren't mentioned
[1:33:49] because that was a common thing then
[1:33:52] but at the very best case scenario this
[1:33:54] was either adultery or
[1:33:58] fornication and the Bible clearly says
[1:34:00] that both are kind of frowned
[1:34:08] upon but they were the elect of
[1:34:11] God yeah that's what I said that's what
[1:34:14] I said Damar premeditated
[1:34:20] fornication
[1:34:22] or no sorry she pray maned did adultery
[1:34:26] it would have been adultery for her
[1:34:28] because her two husbands had
[1:34:30] died and
[1:34:32] Judah flirted with the idea of adultery
[1:34:35] if he didn't have any other wives or
[1:34:38] fornication if he
[1:34:41] did and Tamar played a trick on him and
[1:34:46] you know he took his bracelet and his
[1:34:48] thing and and uh now I want to show you
[1:34:51] you something this is Spirits don't
[1:34:55] die thank you very
[1:34:57] much when Juda found out that Tamar his
[1:35:02] sister-in-law was
[1:35:05] pregnant this really good Holy Roller
[1:35:08] elect of God said I'll kill her because
[1:35:12] she was supposed to take my third son
[1:35:15] and raise up seed to My First Son
[1:35:19] Heir bless God
[1:35:24] I got a $90 tie
[1:35:28] on
[1:35:29] maybe see that spirit's still
[1:35:33] alive and it
[1:35:37] was him that had did it do you see that
[1:35:40] Judah chose
[1:35:44] murdering because he was covering up his
[1:35:48] own thank you very much
[1:35:52] you know our Prophet talked about that
[1:35:54] he saidou know if you have somebody in
[1:35:56] the church that really struggles with
[1:35:59] something chances are if you go over to
[1:36:01] their house and open the closet they'll
[1:36:04] have a skeleton standing
[1:36:09] there so to to draw attention away from
[1:36:12] his
[1:36:13] sin said we'll kill her bless God we
[1:36:17] don't put up with that kind of
[1:36:18] foolishness in the church we'll just set
[1:36:20] this thing straight for
[1:36:25] good oh bless God that
[1:36:30] hurt tear just came out and said well
[1:36:33] whoever's man owns
[1:36:36] this you know and if you went back I I I
[1:36:39] got so excited under the anointing I say
[1:36:41] you know Judah actually want sent his
[1:36:44] servants to pay this
[1:36:47] prostitute and she was there because she
[1:36:51] wasn't a prostitute generally
[1:36:54] speaking and she hid and Judah was upset
[1:36:58] that he couldn't pay for his
[1:37:03] services and he said well I guess if she
[1:37:06] don't want the
[1:37:07] money bless God I'm free to
[1:37:12] go but see how that religious
[1:37:16] spirit rised up in
[1:37:19] election and would have chose
[1:37:23] murder when they were the one wearing
[1:37:25] the
[1:37:30] Hat
[1:37:34] ouch I think we read a scripture
[1:37:36] something like that what right do we
[1:37:39] have to
[1:37:40] judge if you live in a glass house you
[1:37:43] better not throw
[1:37:44] stones that means if you're
[1:37:49] breathing a amen praise
[1:37:54] God
[1:37:55] Amen because there's just one person
[1:37:58] that has the right to
[1:38:00] judge and he can choose
[1:38:04] Grace or
[1:38:07] destruction aren't you glad it ain't
[1:38:09] brother Dale's
[1:38:10] Choice it took me years to figure that
[1:38:14] out
[1:38:16] Hallelujah I'll trust him every time
[1:38:20] I'll Trust his amazing amazing judgment
[1:38:22] in the situation that's just beyond my
[1:38:26] comprehension
[1:38:30] Hallelujah because he's a sovereign God
[1:38:33] and he's
[1:38:34] omnipotent and he knows the beginning
[1:38:37] from the end and he's also
[1:38:41] just amen you know the story and here
[1:38:45] Judah
[1:38:47] says the
[1:38:49] Tamar is more holy
[1:38:52] than
[1:38:53] me now I thought they're both were
[1:38:55] lacking a little bit on
[1:38:57] the holy
[1:38:59] part but I want to reint blate this and
[1:39:02] I did the three messages ago
[1:39:06] Jesus chose to come through this
[1:39:10] fornication along with
[1:39:12] the uh whor from the wall of Jericho
[1:39:18] Rahab see see that's God
[1:39:22] so the next time the devil tells you
[1:39:26] that you're not good enough you said
[1:39:28] devil you haven't read the Bible in a
[1:39:30] while you need to read these people that
[1:39:33] are in heaven right now and read their
[1:39:35] life
[1:39:36] story because they're already in
[1:39:40] glory so like they're we're we're like
[1:39:44] in good
[1:39:46] camp
[1:39:48] uhhuh aren't you glad I'm glad I'm not
[1:39:50] saved by my works oh hallelujah thank
[1:39:54] you Lord Jesus I mean I love doing works
[1:39:57] for God I love them but I'm sure glad I
[1:40:00] ain't saved by my first
[1:40:01] works I would have already been heated
[1:40:05] up amen let's go faster Abraham in
[1:40:08] Genesis 20 uh 1 verse 1 to verse 7
[1:40:13] Abraham leaves because of prosperity is
[1:40:16] looking for money looking for an easier
[1:40:20] life he's running away from a famine and
[1:40:23] he lies about his wife says she's my
[1:40:27] sister and I I want to show you this
[1:40:29] this is in Genesis 20 1-7 and I'm only
[1:40:31] doing this to to be fast I mean I could
[1:40:34] preach whole messages on any one of
[1:40:35] these people but I want to show you
[1:40:37] something that is just stumbles me
[1:40:40] almost it don't almost I said here
[1:40:44] Abraham flat out Li to a king with a
[1:40:46] pure heart and the god woke the king up
[1:40:49] and said you're as good as a dad man you
[1:40:50] have have somebody else's wife and the
[1:40:52] King had to remind God that what Abraham
[1:40:55] had told
[1:40:56] him and this I will never understand and
[1:40:59] I'm not I'm just saying this is a
[1:41:01] sovereign God and and I don't think
[1:41:04] there's a lot of counts of this but here
[1:41:07] Abraham is a
[1:41:09] liar and God told the king if you don't
[1:41:12] go and get that liar of a Preacher to
[1:41:16] pray for you you're a dead
[1:41:19] man
[1:41:21] I don't understand
[1:41:24] that he told Abraham he so told the king
[1:41:27] he saidif you don't go and and he said
[1:41:30] can't God I never did nothing wrong I'm
[1:41:33] only taking her
[1:41:35] sister and God you're going to kill
[1:41:38] somebody with a pure
[1:41:40] heart God said you're a dead manless you
[1:41:44] don't go get that liar to pray for
[1:41:49] you
[1:41:51] that's
[1:41:52] election That's The Power of election
[1:41:54] you know we we said this when we
[1:41:55] preached the beginning see our message
[1:41:59] in the message must be different than
[1:42:02] the denominational
[1:42:05] churches thank you sisters buddy amen s
[1:42:09] brothers right we're not a denomination
[1:42:12] but see we have a different
[1:42:14] message now I'm not I'm not God knows
[1:42:18] this you know this I'm not pushing this
[1:42:20] to the point of disgrace but these are
[1:42:23] facts these are facts and so we're not
[1:42:27] we're not pushing this God that you know
[1:42:30] I'm doing all the decisions and God's
[1:42:32] just allowing me to be a good boy
[1:42:35] because that's what the Baptists are
[1:42:37] preaching
[1:42:39] uhuh if we get enough programs to bring
[1:42:42] in Ben NORAD enough times and and that
[1:42:45] we'll have enough alter calls and and
[1:42:47] that'll help no I mean that that's we
[1:42:50] believe in those things but you see what
[1:42:52] it mean it's election remember what I
[1:42:55] told you about you it's hard for you to
[1:42:57] imagine because you've heard it so long
[1:43:00] but there's people that have never
[1:43:04] ever
[1:43:07] ever seen one scripture on
[1:43:12] Election that's heard to
[1:43:14] believe you know when I studied this I
[1:43:18] could preach a whole message just read
[1:43:20] in scriptures on Election on
[1:43:24] election and
[1:43:27] predestination the Bible is full from
[1:43:30] Genesis the
[1:43:32] revelations on you came from
[1:43:35] him Greatful of it what else do they
[1:43:41] preach amen that's why God don't know
[1:43:45] them because they never came from him
[1:43:48] they're not a part of him amen now now
[1:43:50] Abraham taught his son very well
[1:43:53] Isaac and Isaac did almost exactly the
[1:43:56] same thing as his daddy did that should
[1:43:58] teach you daddies to raise up your
[1:44:00] children in the right way because Isaac
[1:44:02] lied and said his wife was his sister
[1:44:05] also so Daddy was a very good
[1:44:08] teacher and then we see the prophet
[1:44:13] Ezekiel here God had him lie on his side
[1:44:19] in the house of Israel
[1:44:21] for multiple days this is in Ezekiel 4
[1:44:24] 4-6 and we're just going through these
[1:44:27] people here in the word of God amazing
[1:44:30] things that God did in the Bible that
[1:44:32] was out of the step of what we picture
[1:44:36] Our
[1:44:38] God you know what that
[1:44:40] is amazing
[1:44:43] grace it's nothing but Amazing Grace
[1:44:45] because see this second
[1:44:49] Eve could not it wasn't possible that's
[1:44:54] hard for brother Dale to understand the
[1:44:56] second Eve no matter what she did before
[1:45:00] she was even born could not
[1:45:04] fall for the scriptures to be
[1:45:07] fulfilled amen now we're not promoting
[1:45:10] our
[1:45:11] mistakes but what we're trying to show
[1:45:13] is if you see your brother in a
[1:45:16] mistake just leave it
[1:45:19] alone if you want want to pray privately
[1:45:22] but for goodness sake don't go talk to
[1:45:23] him don't dare go do
[1:45:26] that just
[1:45:29] pray because God knows exactly what he's
[1:45:33] doing and maybe that brother is making a
[1:45:36] mistake to pressure your character in
[1:45:39] forgiving him in his mistake that God's
[1:45:42] raising him up and it might take him too
[1:45:45] many years for that to happen uhhuh and
[1:45:48] we're looking at it in a self-righteous
[1:45:50] way like joab and said well we'll kill
[1:45:54] Tamar we'll just kill
[1:45:57] him and then we killed
[1:46:01] God because they were
[1:46:04] God
[1:46:05] Amen God help us God help us to
[1:46:09] recognize now you know in the first few
[1:46:10] messages we read many of these
[1:46:14] scriptures amen and I want to read a
[1:46:17] scripture here and we're going to come
[1:46:18] to a close here Matthew 22:14
[1:46:22] uh here it says for many are called but
[1:46:25] few are chosen that's just a very short
[1:46:27] verse but I'm going to read a a quote
[1:46:29] here of our Prophet if you'll forgive me
[1:46:31] he says he talks about he was and I
[1:46:34] mentioned this many weeks ago on on a
[1:46:36] Wednesday night and it was all based on
[1:46:38] this scripture but a man took a out in
[1:46:41] the in the country and and there was
[1:46:43] multiple animals in the pasture and so
[1:46:46] here he says there was mules there there
[1:46:48] was camels there there was goats there
[1:46:50] there was many other animals all in the
[1:46:53] pasture and and the man said you know
[1:46:56] but there was a Shepherd there and he
[1:46:58] had sheep
[1:47:00] there and brother baham says this many
[1:47:02] different times he says this in The
[1:47:04] Shepherd of the Sheepfold and he says it
[1:47:06] in the Supernatural God in
[1:47:08] 59 and the guy was telling him he said
[1:47:10] well you know how's the guy control all
[1:47:13] the animals and he said well he only
[1:47:16] controls the
[1:47:18] sheep and he even goes go further than
[1:47:21] that he says well actually he only
[1:47:23] controls the
[1:47:25] sheep that know the shepherd's
[1:47:29] voice and so brother brandom of course
[1:47:32] got very excited listening to this and
[1:47:34] this is in a couple paragraphs and I'm
[1:47:35] just prayer phrasing it but he
[1:47:40] says
[1:47:42] so only the sheep that recognize the
[1:47:44] voice of the shepherd go into the F that
[1:47:47] night to be protected from the wild of
[1:47:50] the world and so the mules and the
[1:47:54] camels and the goats and the cattle and
[1:47:58] the sheep that don't know the
[1:48:01] voice all stay out but they're all
[1:48:07] chewing on the same
[1:48:09] grass in the green
[1:48:12] pasture
[1:48:14] amen see if we let God take care of the
[1:48:19] elect
[1:48:21] he's got it all under control and
[1:48:23] anytime there's an
[1:48:25] issue amen is when we try to get in
[1:48:28] there and assist God in doing something
[1:48:32] that God don't even want
[1:48:34] done
[1:48:36] amen amen and don't ever let Satan say
[1:48:39] you know I should have done this I you
[1:48:41] know even in your
[1:48:43] mistakes God gets Glory a prophet said
[1:48:47] you know there's nothing that Satan does
[1:48:49] to hinder God
[1:48:50] Kingdom nothing but I've made mistake I
[1:48:54] made flat out sins but God just turns
[1:48:57] that
[1:49:00] around oh wow isn't he amazing but like
[1:49:05] if you believe he God did that for you
[1:49:08] which we know he did don't you believe
[1:49:11] you could do that for your brother or
[1:49:13] your sister that you just flat out don't
[1:49:19] understand
[1:49:22] there's situations in the flesh that you
[1:49:24] would look at and you say
[1:49:28] God how in the world are you going to
[1:49:30] fix
[1:49:32] that and because he's God if he could
[1:49:35] answer you back on the video call you
[1:49:39] just say don't worry little
[1:49:40] child I've already fixed
[1:49:44] it I've already
[1:49:47] fixed but you can't see it
[1:49:51] you can't see it and so because of
[1:49:54] that we allow Satan to beat up on us or
[1:49:58] we beat up on each other and then Satan
[1:50:01] can take a coffee break when neither
[1:50:04] should be
[1:50:06] happening you might you know what you
[1:50:09] could be the most holy pure perfect
[1:50:12] virtuous angel that was never
[1:50:15] born and if you're not in God's
[1:50:17] predestination plan
[1:50:20] you ain't going to be there you ain't
[1:50:23] going to be there but God you know I I
[1:50:26] preached and I cast out devils and I did
[1:50:28] this and I healed the sick and I did
[1:50:30] this and I gave the money to the poor
[1:50:32] and I and I and I and I went trips and I
[1:50:37] and
[1:50:38] I there's one comment and
[1:50:42] I and and
[1:50:44] I and and and I
[1:50:47] healed and I gave to the poor and and I
[1:50:53] pre and God's up there oh Father forgive
[1:50:56] him he don't even know that he's saying
[1:51:03] I
[1:51:06] amen God help us I love the end of that
[1:51:09] verse in
[1:51:11] Matthew that we read only one is able to
[1:51:17] judge to save or to kill only one I'm
[1:51:24] glad it's him I'm glad it's him I'm glad
[1:51:27] I'm so glad it's him you know I want to
[1:51:29] just use my last example and I'm going
[1:51:31] to close with this you know the story in
[1:51:34] John
[1:51:35] 83-11 I give you the scripture so you
[1:51:38] know I truly did study these out and
[1:51:40] read these but here is an elect
[1:51:44] lady caught in the very
[1:51:48] Act of adultery
[1:51:53] and she's brought to
[1:51:56] Jesus by The Church Believers of the
[1:52:02] day and they
[1:52:05] said we we've been preaching on this for
[1:52:08] three weeks now said now Jesus your
[1:52:11] Bible
[1:52:13] says as if God didn't already know what
[1:52:16] his Bible
[1:52:18] say they thought their college Cemetery
[1:52:22] education was going to help out God's
[1:52:26] omnipotent
[1:52:28] mind your Bible says
[1:52:32] that she's to be
[1:52:35] stoned and whoever was caught with her
[1:52:38] and the Bible says that Jesus never
[1:52:40] answered
[1:52:42] them and he stooped down and he wrote
[1:52:44] something on the
[1:52:46] sand and then he ra stopped and he said
[1:52:52] to the people that were there he said
[1:52:54] any of
[1:52:58] you that are without
[1:53:02] sin you can start throwing the first
[1:53:07] stones and then he knelt down and he
[1:53:11] kept I'd like to know what all was wrote
[1:53:13] on that
[1:53:14] s and he started writing on the
[1:53:17] S I'm going somewhere with
[1:53:22] this and when he rose
[1:53:24] up all the re this was the Pharisees so
[1:53:27] they were Church going people all the
[1:53:30] religious Christians that had a nice
[1:53:32] suit on were gone our Prophet said it
[1:53:36] was probably them that had laid with her
[1:53:38] at other times but they weren't caught
[1:53:40] in the act that's what brother brah said
[1:53:44] but Jesus said to
[1:53:47] her where is your
[1:53:53] accusers and she
[1:53:55] said I have
[1:53:59] none I want to show you
[1:54:01] something I want to close on this thing
[1:54:04] not one time in my studies and not one
[1:54:08] place in the Bible not one single
[1:54:11] place did it say that this
[1:54:15] woman ask for
[1:54:18] forgiveness
[1:54:21] it don't even say she had a repentant
[1:54:25] heart that was probably her business for
[1:54:28] making
[1:54:35] groceries and Jesus
[1:54:38] said neither do I condemn you see what
[1:54:41] I'm trying to show you is Believers if
[1:54:44] you're
[1:54:45] elected you don't even have to
[1:54:48] ask
[1:54:50] now God wants the Bible says you have
[1:54:52] not because you ask not but this is an
[1:54:55] example where
[1:54:57] somebody was set
[1:54:59] free and they never even
[1:55:03] ask you see if you were tore from God we
[1:55:08] our next message I'm going to preach on
[1:55:10] that if you were ripped from God you
[1:55:13] don't have to ask to come back
[1:55:16] together you don't even have to ask
[1:55:20] so you thought your unsaved loved ones
[1:55:23] couldn't get saved let me just tell you
[1:55:25] something they don't even have to
[1:55:31] ask let that sink in if they were ripped
[1:55:35] from his side brother Brown talked about
[1:55:38] it like this he said you know the
[1:55:39] Chinese Laundry men that moved to the
[1:55:41] states and they never knew English and
[1:55:43] they didn't know how they would give
[1:55:44] back your laundry to them and they would
[1:55:46] tear a piece of paper but in the Bible
[1:55:49] it says that ripped the
[1:55:53] flesh if you were ripped from the Flesh
[1:55:55] of God you don't have to even ask to
[1:55:59] come back into that
[1:56:05] flesh and God put that
[1:56:10] here for you all to see
[1:56:13] that you could no more be lost by your
[1:56:17] ability of being lost then God could go
[1:56:21] to hell
[1:56:24] himself but that's for one class of
[1:56:29] people that's the people that were part
[1:56:31] of him before the foundation of the
[1:56:38] world hallelu

[1:57:34] mean that should give you so much
[1:57:38] encouragement that next time the Devil
