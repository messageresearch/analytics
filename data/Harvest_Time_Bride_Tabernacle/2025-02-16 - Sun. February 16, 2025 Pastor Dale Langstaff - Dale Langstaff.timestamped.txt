[38:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ it was
[38:25] all about Jesus Christ Our gospel is all
[38:28] about Jesus Christ but God chose men to
[38:30] write the Bible and John was one of them
[38:33] and God in illed man so powerfully like
[38:38] he's doing in this day and has done in
[38:41] this day that John God's servant fell
[38:44] down to worship that
[38:47] man but it wasn't because John really
[38:49] made a mistake I mean he did but it was
[38:54] that man was so full of God he thought
[38:56] it was God
[38:58] and the angel said to John twice in
[39:00] Revelation said he said don't worship me
[39:02] he said arise he said I'm your fellow
[39:04] brother worship God Amen and we still
[39:07] believe that today but we believe that
[39:09] God can so inter Throne a person's being
[39:13] that every breath they take is just
[39:16] Jehovah like the Bible said we are
[39:18] written Epistles read of all men people
[39:20] don't need a living Bible today you know
[39:22] actually the Bible said the letter kth
[39:24] but the spirit give life amen so I mean
[39:28] we believe the letter but but we're
[39:31] we're I'm not leaving the letter but
[39:33] we're almost like we're to the spirit
[39:36] when the spirit of truth comes it'll
[39:38] lead and guide you in all truth the
[39:41] spirit the thought in God's mind that he
[39:43] portrayed on letters you know you know
[39:46] it was mentally and physically
[39:48] impossible for you to comprehend the
[39:51] mind of Jehovah an an omnipotent God and
[39:55] put a word down
[39:57] like
[39:59] unbelievable unst understandable huge I
[40:03] mean those words they just I mean
[40:05] they're okay but they're just I mean
[40:08] God's
[40:09] like
[40:11] woo
[40:13] amen and so you know just for a
[40:15] foundation for a younger ones and
[40:17] believer and then you know we see in 1
[40:18] Corinthians 11:1 Paul said follow me as
[40:21] I follow Christ and you know I'm not
[40:24] your God and no minister is and no
[40:26] evangelist my goodness I'd be terrible
[40:28] but uh but no man is but you know
[40:32] people people will always look to a a
[40:36] spiritual person and that's all right as
[40:39] long as that person's pointing them to
[40:41] Christ see I it's like over there he's
[40:44] over there you know John said I must
[40:47] decrease so he can increase I'm not the
[40:50] big cheese he's the big
[40:52] cheese but we still read what John wrote
[40:54] in the Bible amen yeah that's and so you
[40:59] know and you know you can share that in
[41:01] the uh the uh you know the five-fold
[41:04] ministry and and God sent Apostles
[41:06] prophets teachers evangelists and
[41:08] pastors those are for the perfecting of
[41:10] the Saints and for the edification the
[41:13] Ed there's WR in the Bible for the
[41:14] edification of Christ but those people
[41:16] aren't God but they're packing God
[41:19] they're packing God but they're not God
[41:21] and so the greatest misunderstanding
[41:23] that people have in in and what we would
[41:26] believe here is we believe in prophets
[41:28] and as soon as you say that word people
[41:30] say well you're worshiping a man well
[41:32] then you must not have a pastor or you
[41:35] must not have an evangelist or you must
[41:36] not have you must not have nobody that
[41:38] you look up to that think was a good God
[41:41] and you know we would repeat anybody's
[41:43] words I I repeated some words last
[41:45] Sunday about uh and I didn't even bring
[41:47] down who it was it's still on my phone
[41:49] was uh anybody that speaks the
[41:52] truth will be hated you know that was
[41:55] just somebody in the states that said
[41:56] that in the 1800
[41:57] because you know and and if you ever
[41:59] look in the world politics I mean like
[42:02] listen I want to tell you something this
[42:04] this is a great mystery do you know why
[42:05] we always get a terrible
[42:08] government CU people don't want the
[42:09] truth
[42:12] yeah people will believe they want to
[42:15] believe the lie and that's why the
[42:18] dumbest Stones get voted in in every
[42:23] country well I mean if any one of you
[42:26] run for government and you told them the
[42:27] truth you think you'd get a
[42:29] vote yeah you'd get a vote your
[42:33] wife that's right
[42:36] amen amen amen and we also have a
[42:40] foundation in Amos you know everything
[42:42] we preach and and teach is based on the
[42:44] word of God and and we serve God and and
[42:47] you know we also teach this in Amos 3:7
[42:49] it says surely the Lord God will do
[42:52] nothing but he Reveals His secrets to
[42:55] the servants the prophets so if you want
[42:58] to find out the mind of God you got to
[43:01] get in a prophet's mind and it don't
[43:03] mean that Prophet will be perfect oh he
[43:05] won't be John was or Paul was a murderer
[43:07] John was you know they all had you know
[43:11] Abraham
[43:12] lied but God still stood with those men
[43:16] because that was God's way and that
[43:19] always they you know that always
[43:21] befuddles people you know and and you
[43:23] know that you know the Bible says a
[43:25] prophet's purly received on his own land
[43:26] he talking about ministers that's why
[43:28] people that know me they say oh I
[43:30] remember brother Dale when he got
[43:31] married oh bless God it's really you
[43:33] want to see a miracle Stephen Judy being
[43:35] here cuz they remember me before I had
[43:36] kids so like that's the greatest Miracle
[43:39] you're going to see
[43:40] today because they remember when I was
[43:42] young and I mean can you imagine a
[43:44] 19-year-old married just think of all
[43:47] the mistakes I made brother
[43:49] Carson amen and that's where people
[43:52] stumble when they're serving God amen
[43:55] amen but let's just look into our
[43:57] message here you know you know when you
[43:59] look at the new birth and everybody's
[44:01] got a dation and you know we studied
[44:04] this when we went to the minister saying
[44:06] and this kind of struck me one of the
[44:07] brothers said something a real young
[44:10] evangelist brother and and it it grabbed
[44:12] hold of me amen and and uh you know I
[44:15] I've heard it preach and if you feel
[44:17] this way I'm praise God I love you too
[44:19] and that's wonderful you know but many
[44:21] ministers have say you know you need to
[44:23] know the day and the hour and the minute
[44:25] drive the steak down and anytime Satan
[44:27] comes and you know buffets you you can
[44:30] bring them right back to this date and
[44:31] you can say you know on January you know
[44:34] boom boom this is where me and God
[44:37] settled the the
[44:40] dude but what really knocked my socks
[44:43] off when we were gone so I'm giving
[44:45] credit to this other brother he
[44:47] said do you remember when you were
[44:50] born
[44:54] naturally well you were there
[44:59] hello do you
[45:01] remember when you were fully born you
[45:04] said I must
[45:08] breathe on my
[45:13] seat you don't
[45:18] remember wow you know I wonder just
[45:21] wonder if the natural tape's the
[45:25] spiritual you know you know I heard it
[45:27] preach that you know praise God a woman
[45:29] couldn't have a baby without knowing
[45:31] she's had a baby and that that's
[45:33] probably very true unless you was on so
[45:36] much painkiller but you know it wasn't
[45:38] the person having the baby that was
[45:42] birthed and you
[45:44] know when did Mary when when the angel
[45:48] come to Mary and said you know you're
[45:50] highly favored above women and all this
[45:53] when did she become filled with the Holy
[45:56] Ghost in the type of a
[46:02] pregnancy you know let's look at our
[46:04] scripture John 6:44 no man come to me
[46:06] unless the father draw him when Mary
[46:10] accepted and become pregnant is when she
[46:12] said be it onto me according to Thy
[46:19] word
[46:21] hello as soon as you you know what
[46:24] you're here this morning not because I'm
[46:26] a great preacher you're here this
[46:27] morning because God Drew you here you're
[46:30] serving God this morning not because
[46:32] you're a good person you had great
[46:34] parents and that could be the case I did
[46:36] but it's because God Drew you back to
[46:39] himself you're here this morning you're
[46:41] serving God because you came from God
[46:44] and God's like a magnet and he's going
[46:46] oh come on back to me honey I need that
[46:50] rib that's right no man chose to serve
[46:55] God I know you think you did but you
[46:57] didn't man's flesh in the garden they
[46:59] ran from God and
[47:01] hid it was God that Drew you it's a
[47:06] mystery you know so you can say the new
[47:08] birth is an experience and that's great
[47:10] praise the Lord it is you can say it's a
[47:12] life praise God it is you can say that
[47:14] you got to die in rot and fall on the
[47:16] ground to bring forth much fruit it is
[47:19] praise the Lord that's the truth you can
[47:20] say it's Christ Jesus yes sir it is
[47:23] hallelujah it is you can say it's the
[47:26] fruits of the spirit and I would say yes
[47:28] it is you got to be careful with that
[47:29] though because there's some really good
[47:30] worldly men that are really kind and you
[47:32] know do great things for the
[47:34] world you can say it's receiving the
[47:37] word and I would say yes sir it is even
[47:39] the word for your day and I believe
[47:42] that but what's the definition of the
[47:44] word for your
[47:46] day you can say it's a revelation of
[47:49] Christ I want to I want to just I I'm
[47:52] not trying to take away anything that's
[47:54] in the Bible and we're going to go
[47:56] through a bunch of them
[47:57] them I want to tell you what the
[48:00] experience of Christ
[48:02] is and it's
[48:06] rest when Christ draws you to
[48:10] himself it'll be the greatest peace you
[48:14] have ever standed understood it'll be
[48:17] peace that passes all understanding it
[48:20] was like what in the world is going on
[48:25] here that's right that's why I don't
[48:27] believe for one second and it was the
[48:29] greatest Deliverance I ever can when I
[48:31] understood the scriptures and this
[48:32] revelation of this day what a prophet
[48:35] brought was every Church in the world
[48:37] preaches
[48:39] fear except
[48:41] Christ there's no love and fear you know
[48:44] if you go to the Catholic Church they
[48:46] say well if you leave us you know you're
[48:47] going to go to hell because we got a
[48:49] pope and if you don't do this and you
[48:51] know and all the churches you know and
[48:53] you could fast forward you know and uh
[48:56] like many people you know they they
[48:58] would believe different things you
[49:01] know but rest and resting in Christ was
[49:04] the absence of
[49:06] fear and this whole Christianity is love
[49:09] affair with Christ and there ain't no
[49:12] fear and love and perfect love cast out
[49:16] all fear now I don't mean that you you
[49:18] know if you're at rest with God and you
[49:20] want to worship God you can lose your
[49:22] mind God won't be scared of noise and
[49:23] neither will brother Dale if you get up
[49:25] and get blessed and get Stone drunk here
[49:28] this morning it won't scare me away and
[49:29] it won't scare the spirit of God away
[49:31] and I want to get really close to you if
[49:33] it ain't me that's doing
[49:35] it but rest is a type of peace that
[49:38] passes all understanding so we see the
[49:41] base of our scripture was no man has
[49:43] come unto me except the father draum so
[49:45] let's go into John and we I we I pray we
[49:48] won't you know I won't bore you but
[49:50] let's go into John 10 and we're going to
[49:52] just skip some scriptures but we're
[49:53] going to start at 2 and 5 and then go to
[49:55] 710 14 and and I'll tell you where I'm
[49:58] at but we see here that whoever enters
[50:00] the
[50:01] Sheepfold the shepherd is Christ
[50:05] Jesus so he's the one that's The
[50:07] Shepherd of the Sheepfold and you know
[50:09] in verse three it says and the Potter
[50:12] which that is the definition of that is
[50:14] the door man or the man that carries the
[50:17] your your your
[50:18] luggage and the scripture just carries
[50:21] right on is Jesus is the door of the
[50:24] Sheepfold so he is the Potter he said
[50:27] the Potter openeth the door and the
[50:29] sheep hear his voice and calleth and he
[50:32] calleth his own Sheep by name and he
[50:35] leadth
[50:37] them he leadth them out who understand
[50:41] God are the ones that came from God yes
[50:44] amen well watch I'm going to I'm going
[50:46] to show you a Bible praise God that's
[50:48] our
[50:49] absolute
[50:53] amen and he putteth forth his own sheep
[50:57] and they goeth out before before them
[51:00] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[51:02] his voice you know it don't there's a
[51:06] supernatural power to the New Birth when
[51:09] you know God is speaking to you God is
[51:13] speaking to
[51:15] you amen I know he uses ministers and
[51:18] all this but God has a way you know a
[51:22] minister can minister to I don't care if
[51:24] it's a few because of the weather or
[51:26] many but God will speak to somebody in a
[51:28] special way and it maybe just ain't your
[51:30] day
[51:31] today but God knows the
[51:34] time God knows how to deal with the
[51:37] hearts of men amen hallelujah and a
[51:40] stranger will not follow him but will
[51:42] flee from him for they know not the
[51:44] voice of for they know not the voice of
[51:47] strangers and
[51:49] Jesus and when Jesus said unto them
[51:51] verily verily I say unto you I am the
[51:53] door of the Sheepfold now earlier in the
[51:56] scripture said it was the porter but
[51:58] Jesus was the porter the scriptures
[52:00] actually explaining the scripture now
[52:03] we're Jesus is the one that's guarding
[52:06] who comes in and who comes
[52:09] out and all that ever came to me and all
[52:12] that ever came before me was thieves and
[52:14] robbers but the Sheep did not hear them
[52:17] I am the
[52:19] door by me if any man enter in he shall
[52:22] be saved and shall go in
[52:27] and out and find pasture that's you know
[52:30] what that is go in and go out and find
[52:34] pasture that's
[52:37] rest that's rest if you're on the
[52:39] pasture with the Sheep you know David
[52:42] wrote that amazing the 23rd psalm the
[52:45] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he
[52:47] leadth me beside the Still Waters he
[52:51] restoreth my
[52:52] soul amen when you go in the pasture
[52:55] with the Lambs and the cows and they're
[52:57] all chewing their
[53:00] cut they're not worried about a missile
[53:02] coming
[53:04] in
[53:11] amen hallelu you and in verse uh sorry
[53:14] I'm just losing my in verse 10 and a
[53:16] thief cometh not but to steal and to
[53:19] kill and destroy but I am come that they
[53:21] might have life and might have it more
[53:24] abundantly you see the purpose in God
[53:27] was to be a blessing amen and I am the
[53:29] Good Shepherd and I know my sheep and am
[53:32] known of mine and other sheep I have
[53:35] watch this verse this is a special verse
[53:37] here verse 16 and other sheep I have now
[53:40] this is Jesus himself
[53:43] talking which are not of this fold
[53:47] uh-oh wait a
[53:50] minute Jesus was ministering to the Jews
[53:53] but the Gentiles hadn't come in yet
[53:56] that's
[53:57] beautiful he said there's other sheep
[54:00] there's a brother Dale that's coming in
[54:01] but I'm preaching to the Jews right now
[54:03] but they hadn't rejected them yet as
[54:05] soon as they reject they blind them
[54:07] temporarily so we could be grafted in
[54:09] and saved he said and other sheep I have
[54:12] which are not of this fold them also I
[54:14] must bring and they shall hear my voice
[54:17] Hallelujah and there shall be one fold
[54:20] and one Shepherd this was Jesus speaking
[54:22] of the Jews but he knew that there was a
[54:24] gentile bride that he was going to turn
[54:26] his attention to when he was rejected by
[54:29] the
[54:30] Jews Hallelujah but ye believe but if
[54:34] you believe not ye are not my sheep as I
[54:38] said unto you my sheep hear my voice and
[54:40] know me and they follow me and I give
[54:42] them eternal life there you go who gives
[54:45] you eternal life see you don't get it
[54:47] from the preacher you don't get it by
[54:49] coming to this church you don't get it
[54:52] from all these other experiences in life
[54:54] but you get it from Christ Jesus
[54:57] yes I give them eternal life and they
[54:59] shall never perish and neither shall men
[55:02] pluck them out of my hand now this is a
[55:04] great promise because you know it really
[55:06] don't matter you know you work out your
[55:08] own salvation with fear and trembling so
[55:10] it really don't matter what I think of
[55:11] your experience what's you and God think
[55:13] of your experience it it dwells a lot on
[55:16] what God thinks of your experience
[55:19] nobody put M of their hand but in verse
[55:20] 29 it even Goes My Father which they
[55:23] which gave them to me is greater than
[55:25] all and no
[55:27] man no false prophet or minister is able
[55:31] to pluck them out of my hand and watch
[55:33] this now watch this you say well I don't
[55:35] like that some people didn't understand
[55:38] Jesus and I don't like that there were
[55:40] some people didn't understand now he he
[55:42] just he was preaching those words I just
[55:44] read to you and verse 31 and the Jews
[55:47] picked up
[55:48] stones and sought to kill
[55:51] him did I just say something that would
[55:54] make you that angry
[56:02] the only people that picked up Stones
[56:03] were the people that weren't a part of
[56:05] him now I'm going to show you in the
[56:07] scriptures they could have
[56:09] been but they couldn't
[56:11] been you know God gave Cain a space to
[56:15] repent but it wasn't in him to repent
[56:19] because he was of the wicked one he was
[56:22] like Jesus when he was talking to the
[56:23] Sadducees and Pharisees the religious
[56:25] people of the world he said you are of
[56:27] your the Father the
[56:31] devil I bet you they had a new vote in
[56:33] church that
[56:36] day how could Jesus say that this is how
[56:40] Jesus could say that because when you
[56:42] know the Bible says not all that say
[56:44] Lord Lord will enter into the Kingdom of
[56:45] Heaven you know they come to heaven and
[56:47] they say oh Jesus I was a member of the
[56:49] biggest church in Ontario Glory
[56:52] Hallelujah we had a powerful service I
[56:54] seen people healed and laid hands on the
[56:56] sick and all this and Jesus looked right
[56:59] them looked them right in the eye and he
[57:00] said depart from me you workers of
[57:02] iniquity how's that the truth he said I
[57:04] don't even know you you know what that
[57:06] know was now I got a question for you
[57:08] how's Jesus can say with an honest heart
[57:11] say I don't know
[57:13] you because he's omnipotent he knows the
[57:15] beginning from the end he says I'm the
[57:17] alpha and omega the beginning and end
[57:19] you know what the know was it was in the
[57:21] relationship of husband and wife it was
[57:24] a different no
[57:26] and there's about a dozen examples of
[57:28] that in the Bible where the the the the
[57:31] groom would know well you know when
[57:33] Rebeca came to Isaac they went in her
[57:35] mother's tent and he knew her and she
[57:38] became his wife it was a different no
[57:42] man Isaiah 55 6-9 he says seek ye the
[57:46] Lord when he may be found and call upon
[57:48] him while he is near in verse 7 of 55
[57:51] Isaiah let the wicked forsake his ways
[57:54] and the unrighteous men his thoughts
[57:57] and let him return to the Lord and He
[58:00] will have mercy on him see the wicked
[58:03] people could choose God see the the
[58:06] scripture says that God would that none
[58:08] would be lost but men would choose to go
[58:11] to
[58:12] hell you know you know hell wasn't even
[58:15] made for the wicked people the Bible
[58:17] says that hell was made for the devil
[58:19] and his
[58:20] angels but men said Glory I want to go
[58:23] to hell it was a different kind of
[58:26] person than I
[58:28] am
[58:32] amen and I will have mercy upon him and
[58:34] to and to our God and he will abundantly
[58:38] pardon them here's God saying if you
[58:40] will turn your thoughts to me and accept
[58:44] Christ as your savior I will save
[58:47] you and yet the way to destruction is
[58:50] wide because people are flocking to
[58:53] worldliness
[58:56] and away from God right there that's in
[58:58] Isaiah
[59:00] 55:7 God's saying I will forgive the
[59:03] wicked
[59:04] men if he'll come to me but they won't
[59:07] come to him we're living in that world
[59:10] right now yeah yeah verse eight and my
[59:13] thoughts are not your thoughts and
[59:14] neither are my ways your ways sayith the
[59:16] Lord for I as the heaven is higher than
[59:19] the earth so are my ways higher than
[59:21] your ways and my thoughts more than your
[59:25] thoughts let's go to John 3 1-8 and I'm
[59:28] going to read some of these scriptures
[59:29] but I want to focus on eight and I want
[59:30] to lay my foundation on the new birth
[59:34] and I want to show you that anything
[59:36] that any Minister tried to cram down
[59:38] your throat of you know you got it when
[59:41] you did
[59:42] this is phony balone from the Bible
[59:46] because it was a
[59:48] mystery that only you and God knew when
[59:51] you got the new
[59:52] birth there was a man the Pharisee named
[59:55] Nicodemus the r ruler of the Jews and
[59:57] the same came to Jesus by night he was
[59:59] he was ashamed that's why he didn't want
[1:00:02] all his neighbors to know that he was
[1:00:03] pretending to serve God said RAB we know
[1:00:05] you're a teacher sent from God for
[1:00:07] nobody can do the Miracles that thou
[1:00:08] doest and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:00:11] them verily verily except a man be born
[1:00:13] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:00:15] heaven and Nicodemus he this did not
[1:00:18] under comprehend this verse four
[1:00:19] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[1:00:21] born again when he's old can he enter
[1:00:23] into the mother's womb again and be born
[1:00:25] and Jesus said verely verely except the
[1:00:27] man be born of the water and spirit he
[1:00:29] cannot enter into the kingdom of God and
[1:00:31] which is born of flesh is just flesh
[1:00:33] that's just Badger skin it's all going
[1:00:35] to lay down but th which is born of the
[1:00:37] spirit is spirit and Marvel not that I
[1:00:41] say unto you you must be born
[1:00:45] again you must have a way and I'm going
[1:00:48] to show this very clearly I Believe by
[1:00:50] God's grace in the scripture but verse
[1:00:52] eight so here as the wind bloweth where
[1:00:56] it
[1:00:57] listen thou hearest the sound
[1:00:59] thereof but thou cannot tell hence it
[1:01:04] cometh and whether it goth so is every
[1:01:08] man everyone that's born of the spirit
[1:01:11] of God that's why we have no right to
[1:01:15] judge our brothers and sisters God never
[1:01:18] sent us here to be judges we will judge
[1:01:20] someday but that's when we get on the
[1:01:22] throne we'll judge the world with him
[1:01:25] but we're God didn't send us to be
[1:01:26] judges here God sent us to be
[1:01:28] saviors and so you can't understand now
[1:01:31] our Prophet said that you know he said
[1:01:33] this he said you know sometimes a Son of
[1:01:35] God will go a
[1:01:37] long
[1:01:39] time before you can recognize he's a Son
[1:01:42] of
[1:01:46] God he might have been as black as
[1:01:49] coal
[1:01:51] amen watch
[1:01:54] this verse eight so we see this here
[1:01:57] that it's hard to P so here here I want
[1:01:59] to show you some some thoughts that the
[1:02:01] prophet said he said you know it's a
[1:02:04] mystery when you're born again it's a
[1:02:06] mystery into the body of Christ and how
[1:02:09] do you get into it it's a
[1:02:11] mystery you say well you know I don't
[1:02:14] have a definite date that I remember you
[1:02:16] know I feel sorry for the the people
[1:02:19] that sat under a pastor that made them
[1:02:21] feel like they didn't have it because
[1:02:23] they weren't sure when they got it
[1:02:26] you know what the prophet said he said
[1:02:28] you got it when you turn back to Christ
[1:02:31] yeah I I I'll tell you this story he
[1:02:32] said you know there was a sale C
[1:02:35] salesman and uh they used this at the
[1:02:38] thing and and he sold a lady a car and
[1:02:41] he was complete worldly person he he
[1:02:43] could care less about God didn't never
[1:02:45] went to church in his life just wasn't a
[1:02:47] part of his life and and he sold his car
[1:02:49] to Ken come back in the salesman the
[1:02:51] lady was driving away and he said oh he
[1:02:52] said he reachs in his coat pocket
[1:02:56] and he said I think I forgot to give
[1:02:58] that lady the second set of keys for the
[1:03:00] car and he pulled in his coat pocket he
[1:03:03] pulled out in the note and the note said
[1:03:04] where will you spend eternity now it's
[1:03:07] when you decide and he just threw it in
[1:03:09] the garbage he no keys in there I don't
[1:03:12] know what that note is somebody put a
[1:03:15] note in his
[1:03:16] pocket and you know there was just watch
[1:03:19] this this mystery you know that's how
[1:03:21] God works he's just
[1:03:23] like nobody around that man would have
[1:03:26] knew that God had flicked on the
[1:03:31] light he looked exactly the same what I
[1:03:34] mean God was getting him to
[1:03:36] thinking and he thought about that for a
[1:03:39] minute now now he's never thought of God
[1:03:40] in his whole
[1:03:44] life and he
[1:03:46] thought I'm getting
[1:03:49] older that was a bit interesting and he
[1:03:52] went and took the note out of the thing
[1:03:54] and so you know over the period of his
[1:03:56] life you know the next 5 years or 10
[1:03:58] years you know he went to every Church
[1:04:00] in in the surrounding
[1:04:03] town and they told him you know if if
[1:04:05] you come and join the Catholic well you
[1:04:07] know if you do your Hail marage you got
[1:04:09] it you're there you know you done sign
[1:04:12] the book got to recognize that you know
[1:04:15] and he went to the madus and they said
[1:04:17] if you shouted you got it that's it oh
[1:04:20] you're in you can carry on you know you
[1:04:24] went somewhere else and they said well
[1:04:25] if you speak in tongues oh you got it
[1:04:27] that's it you know you can just carry on
[1:04:29] you you got all the evidence you need
[1:04:32] and he went he went to the Quakers and
[1:04:33] they said well if you're really quiet
[1:04:35] when you pray and don't breathe oh you
[1:04:37] got it that's
[1:04:39] it and so he came to the prophet and he
[1:04:42] said I want to know if I got
[1:04:45] Jesus and he said well tell me your
[1:04:47] story and he told him the story and he
[1:04:49] all these things and the confusion in
[1:04:51] the church you know God the Bible says
[1:04:52] God's not the author of confusion and
[1:04:54] you know what the prophet told them
[1:04:56] man he said when you pulled that note
[1:04:59] out that's when you had
[1:05:01] it because your thoughts did a
[1:05:04] 360° turn from the world to like
[1:05:09] uhoh I'm 50 uh uh uh uh
[1:05:15] something watch this now that's Bible
[1:05:18] because the Bible says no man is drawn
[1:05:19] to God except first he draws them no man
[1:05:25] can came to Jesus
[1:05:27] until uhhuh watch that a mystery so you
[1:05:31] know of course being born again you can
[1:05:33] put your thing on it you know you can't
[1:05:34] be born again and deny the Bible you
[1:05:37] can't you know because you know John 1:1
[1:05:39] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:05:40] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:05:43] and God became flesh and dwell Among Us
[1:05:45] that's the flesh that's here now of
[1:05:46] course it was the Flesh of Jesus in his
[1:05:48] time but that flesh is gone and now it's
[1:05:50] the flesh here because of the baptism of
[1:05:52] the Holy Ghost so anybody that has the
[1:05:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost G is here
[1:05:56] today is the word made
[1:05:59] flesh but God is the word but it's more
[1:06:02] than the word because the spirit gives
[1:06:05] life and so you can't say well you know
[1:06:08] I you know I've got the baptism of the
[1:06:09] Holy Ghost and deny God you you can't
[1:06:11] say I am God and deny God like that
[1:06:16] that's kind of
[1:06:17] confusing and you know you're greatly
[1:06:21] deceived and that's why the people that
[1:06:24] are not believers
[1:06:26] that don't have the spirit of Christ
[1:06:27] will never understand you they look at
[1:06:30] you and oh there goes a crazy
[1:06:32] man because they're not on your
[1:06:36] wavelength they're not in your family
[1:06:38] you might say they're they're not in the
[1:06:40] spirit of
[1:06:42] Christ they're not being led by when the
[1:06:44] spirit of truth comes it will lead and
[1:06:46] guide you by all truth they're not being
[1:06:47] led by that spirit and
[1:06:49] truth and that's why to them you seem
[1:06:52] like a gooo
[1:06:56] because they have a different
[1:06:59] Master but a man that's born of the
[1:07:01] spirit cannot take no thought of his own
[1:07:05] because God that Man's dead cuz see
[1:07:09] there can't be two people living in one
[1:07:10] body and so when you get the baptism of
[1:07:13] the Holy Ghost it's no longer what Paul
[1:07:14] say it's no longer I that liveth but
[1:07:16] Christ that liveth in me so brother Dale
[1:07:17] is not alive anymore so you can insult
[1:07:20] me all you want because I'm not even
[1:07:21] here it's just God so you're actually
[1:07:23] insulting God made flesh that's why we
[1:07:26] need to be really careful how we talk to
[1:07:27] other people because how you talk to me
[1:07:29] and how I talk to you sister sh is how
[1:07:31] we're talking to Jesus Christ
[1:07:34] W who who woo forgive me God woo that
[1:07:40] puts a whole different light on it can
[1:07:42] you imagine love to be flowing in this
[1:07:44] church if we really come to that
[1:07:46] Revelation
[1:07:48] who
[1:07:51] oh help me amen 1 Corinthians 12 13 I'm
[1:07:56] trying to go fast for by one Spirit are
[1:07:58] we all baptized into one body whether it
[1:08:00] be jew or Gentile whether we be Bond or
[1:08:03] free whether rich or poor and even made
[1:08:05] to drink unto one Spirit you know the
[1:08:07] Bible says that God is a
[1:08:09] spirit and those that worship Him must
[1:08:12] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:08:15] truth
[1:08:17] amen hallelujah so we love that part of
[1:08:21] it but you know when we become when we
[1:08:23] get the new birth we're in an immature
[1:08:26] State and we will grow fast in Christ
[1:08:29] you know you can speed grow you know you
[1:08:33] know the Bible talks about those that
[1:08:34] come in late will go faster than those
[1:08:36] that come in early amen but you know
[1:08:39] it's not like the day you the first
[1:08:41] moment you come to God that you have all
[1:08:44] the Mysteries all figured out but you
[1:08:46] will grow in maturity and Revelation you
[1:08:49] go oh wow I misunderstood God there oh I
[1:08:54] miss I never heard of that script
[1:08:55] scripture before but we'll grow and you
[1:08:59] know you'll be you'll be more when the
[1:09:01] more you understand Christ the more
[1:09:03] you'll come into love and the more
[1:09:04] you'll come into forgiveness because
[1:09:06] you'll
[1:09:07] recognize what he's done for you and
[1:09:09] he'll bring you so you know we must we
[1:09:12] must give time to
[1:09:14] those that are immature in Christ
[1:09:18] they're they're on the way but they
[1:09:20] maybe just aren't as mature as everyone
[1:09:24] you know if you give them time and you
[1:09:27] give them enough of the spirit of God
[1:09:29] they got to grow you can't stay the same
[1:09:33] it's not possible you know our little
[1:09:35] boy I went down to see Oliver the other
[1:09:37] day and just by the way he's
[1:09:40] awesome and he loves
[1:09:42] me cuz after he ate he fell sound asleep
[1:09:46] and I said I'm good for now to Eternity
[1:09:48] I don't need to
[1:09:49] move but he's like 7 and2 lbs you know
[1:09:54] one time he was in the hospital was
[1:09:55] under
[1:09:57] three you can't live you can't say well
[1:10:00] I'm alive in Christ but I'm not
[1:10:03] growing no no no no no no no that's not
[1:10:06] possible only dad men stay the same
[1:10:10] that's right so if you're alive in
[1:10:12] Christ you're growing in Christ that's
[1:10:14] why we'll come to a more understanding
[1:10:16] more maturity if you're if you're you
[1:10:18] that's why you know that when God sees
[1:10:21] you grown he'll give you more and more
[1:10:23] and more and he'll say you can handle
[1:10:25] this food I can give you meat and
[1:10:28] potatoes Hallelujah John
[1:10:31] 831 says that when
[1:10:34] the and Jesus said unto those Jews which
[1:10:37] believed on him he said if you continue
[1:10:40] in my
[1:10:41] word then are ye my disciples see it's
[1:10:45] not who starts the race but it's who
[1:10:47] finishes the race you know there was a
[1:10:50] lot of people that we thought had the
[1:10:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost and we thought
[1:10:54] they had a lot more than the baptism of
[1:10:55] the Holy Ghost cuz they had knowledge
[1:10:57] wisdom understanding and Revelation and
[1:11:00] they're not even serving God
[1:11:02] today that's
[1:11:05] right wow God have mercy if you continue
[1:11:11] in my word then are ye my disciples this
[1:11:14] ain't you know this is like the turtle
[1:11:16] the turtle won the race the bunny rabbit
[1:11:19] was at the coffee shop 2 Corinthians
[1:11:22] 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:11:25] he is a brand new creation and all
[1:11:28] things are passed away and behold All
[1:11:30] Things become brand new that's why the
[1:11:33] world don't understand you because
[1:11:35] you're a
[1:11:36] cuckoo because you've changed you've
[1:11:39] radically
[1:11:40] changed it's actually not you that's
[1:11:42] changed you've just surrendered to
[1:11:44] Christ you've actually surrendered and
[1:11:46] said it's not me that you
[1:11:48] know yeah it's it's him you know where
[1:11:50] do you want me to go today I said you
[1:11:52] know I was thinking you know today and
[1:11:54] even the even even I you know you have
[1:11:56] to understand each other you know we
[1:11:57] need to labor with each other like you
[1:12:00] know what I mean like and I was saying
[1:12:01] God have your own way today like you
[1:12:03] know should we be here should we not be
[1:12:06] here oh I'm so sad some won't be here
[1:12:08] and you know but God you know God knew
[1:12:11] this before you were born he knew
[1:12:14] exactly this morning he knew we would
[1:12:16] have visitors on the day that over half
[1:12:18] the people aren't here I was like why
[1:12:21] God like you know they would never
[1:12:23] believe we actually had a church except
[1:12:25] that were here on my birthday and you
[1:12:26] actually seen more people
[1:12:28] here why why why why is that hen because
[1:12:32] that's just God you know there's things
[1:12:34] about God you can't understand why would
[1:12:37] God ask a person like me to be
[1:12:39] a minister
[1:12:41] I you can't you there's just some things
[1:12:43] you can't
[1:12:45] understand until you get into the mind
[1:12:47] of Christ you know the new birth was is
[1:12:49] a revelation of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:12:52] great mystery you know Jesus said to
[1:12:54] Peter and blood did not reveal this unto
[1:12:57] you but my Father which is in
[1:13:00] heaven Hallelujah and upon this
[1:13:03] revelation of Jesus Christ I'll build
[1:13:06] the
[1:13:07] church am man you're never going to
[1:13:09] understand God by education and and
[1:13:12] cemeteries and seminaries you're going
[1:13:14] to understand them by praying on your
[1:13:16] knees and crying out to God and saying
[1:13:18] God show me who you are that's
[1:13:21] right understanding the scriptures
[1:13:24] anybody can read read the script anybody
[1:13:26] that's got an education can read the
[1:13:27] Bible and they I mean we have examples
[1:13:29] of that in the Bible said who could
[1:13:32] understand unless somebody was
[1:13:34] sent to show us
[1:13:36] revelation God help us you know the
[1:13:40] Bible says and I'm going to preach on
[1:13:41] this in a couple weeks you know and it's
[1:13:44] not that God don't want gifts in the
[1:13:45] church and so you know I mean I'm giving
[1:13:47] you a twoe nning I hope it don't snow
[1:13:50] that day but you know we believe in all
[1:13:52] the nine spiritual gifts and we believe
[1:13:54] in the five fold is a gift to the Min to
[1:13:56] the to the body you know and so God's
[1:13:59] got these old gifts but you got to take
[1:14:01] these gifts and I know this offense oh
[1:14:05] forgive me God but you know and we're
[1:14:08] going to go into it you know the
[1:14:09] greatest gift all is understand the
[1:14:11] revelation of the
[1:14:13] Resurrection it's understanding I'm
[1:14:15] going in a Rapture I'll be
[1:14:17] there I'll be there you know how I know
[1:14:20] I'll be there cuz I've already been
[1:14:22] there I came from there
[1:14:27] and I'm not crazy either the Bible says
[1:14:30] that says an adulterous and wicked
[1:14:34] generation seeks after signs and
[1:14:35] miracles so watch and I'm going to go
[1:14:37] into this some and layth Foundation now
[1:14:40] this is and I already showed you how we
[1:14:42] feel about uh a prophet and that but he
[1:14:45] said you know the church has sought
[1:14:47] after evidence is too
[1:14:48] much you say well bless God you know any
[1:14:53] brother that I would think that should
[1:14:55] be he should have this shown in his life
[1:15:01] maybe well bless God anybody that would
[1:15:05] you know have a position in the church
[1:15:07] they should have this kind of evidence
[1:15:09] in their
[1:15:10] life
[1:15:13] maybe because the new birth is a mystery
[1:15:17] that's what brother Brown said he said
[1:15:19] we seeking after evidence is too much
[1:15:22] God don't have to give you an Evidence
[1:15:24] yeah
[1:15:25] that's what he said you look up the word
[1:15:27] evidence he said a wicked and adulterous
[1:15:30] stand and seeks after a sign you know
[1:15:32] what he said he said God was talking
[1:15:33] about this
[1:15:36] generation like God watch this I've had
[1:15:39] people tell me this God if you're in the
[1:15:41] church in Wyoming let's see eyes grow
[1:15:45] out well they said that in the Bible you
[1:15:47] know when Jesus went to the and we
[1:15:48] believe God could do that 100% make the
[1:15:51] blind see and and fix lungs he's done
[1:15:54] the all look all kind created births and
[1:15:56] and uh all these things but that's a
[1:16:00] sovereign God you know when God himself
[1:16:02] went to the pool he stepped over sick
[1:16:04] dad people and healed one
[1:16:06] person that's right and I'll tell you
[1:16:09] what if I would have been the person he
[1:16:10] stepped over I would have been
[1:16:12] offended bless God so what kind of a
[1:16:15] Jesus are you don't you know I got a
[1:16:18] sore
[1:16:21] arm but he said I don't do nothing until
[1:16:24] the the spirit chose me to do it yeah do
[1:16:27] I understand that no no I don't
[1:16:31] understand that but that's what the
[1:16:33] Bible
[1:16:34] says and that's how Jesus lived his
[1:16:37] life
[1:16:39] amen he said the church world has looked
[1:16:42] for little evidences and things till
[1:16:45] they've went off on everything's in
[1:16:47] evidence we had lots of people we
[1:16:49] already said that we have lots of people
[1:16:50] that you've known for your whole life
[1:16:52] that had all the evidences
[1:16:54] and they turned her back on
[1:16:56] God I mean they really turned her back
[1:16:59] on God I mean they did
[1:17:01] some you you
[1:17:04] know what happened to their
[1:17:07] evidences see that Satan can
[1:17:10] impersonate anything gifts and callings
[1:17:13] are without repentance the great Hitler
[1:17:15] was one of the greatest Ministers of the
[1:17:19] world bless God do you know I was
[1:17:21] listening to a video the other you know
[1:17:23] it was just slightly over 30% of Germany
[1:17:25] voted for
[1:17:28] Hitler I've heard his speeches amen
[1:17:34] Germany the Millennium he believed the
[1:17:36] German people he take it right to the
[1:17:39] Bible would live the Thousand-Year
[1:17:41] Reign that's what all of us are going to
[1:17:43] do in the Millennium when we go to
[1:17:49] aen and the people just fell to him like
[1:17:52] flies cuz he was a great evangelist
[1:17:58] FSE major false he was a
[1:18:02] cuckoo that's why they could dehumanize
[1:18:04] people and
[1:18:06] go oh and we do this and brother Dale
[1:18:09] does the same thing in the
[1:18:11] pastor I know you haven't cuz I can see
[1:18:14] the
[1:18:16] Halo but when you talk about somebody
[1:18:20] you're going boom and you just killed
[1:18:23] all their account
[1:18:25] ability and that Hitler was able to
[1:18:29] dehumanize
[1:18:30] people it wasn't when those people that
[1:18:33] killed do you know do you know the
[1:18:34] ancestors of the people that shot all
[1:18:37] those people up against the wall are
[1:18:38] still in
[1:18:42] Germany
[1:18:44] hello their grandkids are all there
[1:18:49] living but he dehumanized the people and
[1:18:53] that's what's happening in the Christian
[1:18:54] ranks as we do oh that brother and
[1:18:56] sister I don't think I don't think they
[1:18:59] got it I don't like
[1:19:01] them you just pulled out your machine
[1:19:04] gun it was
[1:19:06] invisible but in your mind you did the
[1:19:09] same sin as
[1:19:11] Hitler Brown
[1:19:13] Shirts oh you oh it's not legal to
[1:19:16] actually murder but you murdered their
[1:19:18] character and everything in their mind
[1:19:20] all their influence you just took out of
[1:19:22] the
[1:19:23] picture and in your mind you buried them
[1:19:26] I said I'll never listen to another
[1:19:27] thing that brother Dale says bless God I
[1:19:31] got
[1:19:32] Bible Hitler had Bible too Thousand-Year
[1:19:38] Reign pulled right out of
[1:19:45] context I don't know where that came
[1:19:47] from that that's not in here I didn't I
[1:19:50] didn't put none of that amen so we got
[1:19:53] to be careful with
[1:19:55] you know you know like we need to
[1:19:58] understand like I I know I know you you
[1:20:01] can't say you're the word and not
[1:20:03] believe the word like that's a real good
[1:20:06] one but we need to let people work out
[1:20:09] their own salvation with fear and
[1:20:11] trembling sometimes people are born
[1:20:13] premature like little
[1:20:15] Oliver and sometimes he can only take a
[1:20:18] little bit of
[1:20:21] food like 10
[1:20:23] ms I would have starved to death on what
[1:20:25] they were feeding him but he got fight
[1:20:27] on
[1:20:29] it yeah spir they think spiritual
[1:20:33] now amen and so the prophet said we need
[1:20:36] to we need to to to to uh to to to to
[1:20:40] wait to labor with the weak I I don't I
[1:20:43] don't mean compromise with the weak I
[1:20:45] don't mean you know but we need to I'm
[1:20:47] not saying leave the Bible no no no that
[1:20:50] that would be sin that would be your
[1:20:51] back but I'm just saying understand at
[1:20:54] least
[1:20:55] and so he said multiple cases where he
[1:20:58] said we've went to little sensation and
[1:21:00] breaks ups and little evidences and
[1:21:02] little this and it separate us hey you
[1:21:04] know what you know what this is this is
[1:21:06] good preaching you know the whole
[1:21:09] Christian angle we all believe God the
[1:21:11] Lord is
[1:21:13] God sure got a lot of different
[1:21:17] churches this great love of Jesus Christ
[1:21:20] has it brought it together
[1:21:27] that kind of love who needs
[1:21:32] eight that's what the prophet saying he
[1:21:35] said with all these little evanes well
[1:21:37] you don't see it like I see it it
[1:21:39] separated the body of
[1:21:42] Christ he said Jesus never came to give
[1:21:45] you an
[1:21:47] Evidence did you feel the tug on your
[1:21:53] heart he he said a lot about it he said
[1:21:56] you know the Luther thought when they
[1:21:58] lived by faith they had it the Methodist
[1:22:00] thought when they showed it they had it
[1:22:02] Pentecostals thought when they spoke in
[1:22:04] tongues they were all looking you know
[1:22:05] what they were looking for an Evidence
[1:22:07] they were trying to pin God down there's
[1:22:10] God right there he's right there but he
[1:22:12] ain't nowhere
[1:22:14] else God's
[1:22:17] everywhere amen you can't put God in a
[1:22:20] box you can't say well I got God and you
[1:22:22] don't but that's that's kind of you know
[1:22:24] what I mean you don't got the God I
[1:22:27] got what's that
[1:22:32] mean amen God help
[1:22:34] us it's not that I it's not that you
[1:22:37] won't grow in the word the prophet but I
[1:22:40] mean any of you that want to study that
[1:22:41] look up just evidence it's a multiple I
[1:22:44] got multiple examples
[1:22:48] here he says it's a pitiful shame a
[1:22:51] condition look at un like L God does do
[1:22:55] something the whole you know it
[1:22:57] everything was built on
[1:22:59] evidence but God is a flower
[1:23:03] garden you know some could get the
[1:23:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost and just sit
[1:23:07] there and
[1:23:08] quiver some could just ball their face
[1:23:11] off some are sitting there with a smile
[1:23:13] and their ears are in the way and
[1:23:14] they're just going like this and some
[1:23:16] are like Brother D they're
[1:23:20] go which one was it it was every one of
[1:23:24] them
[1:23:27] it was all because they all felt God
[1:23:31] pulling them to himself I'm sorry I'm
[1:23:33] I'm going here let me just go down and
[1:23:35] and uh I'll break down
[1:23:38] my here the prophet's talking about
[1:23:40] evence see it say if we would break down
[1:23:42] our walls and the greatest gift in the
[1:23:44] local body if we would put so much
[1:23:46] emphasis on all these these signs and
[1:23:49] all these things but he said it's not an
[1:23:53] Evidence he said it's a spirit of
[1:23:57] God I mean he said a lot a really
[1:24:02] lot amen God help us and God help us not
[1:24:05] to get wrapped up in the here he's
[1:24:08] mentioned this is in in the late message
[1:24:11] this is in Traditions and traditions
[1:24:13] going on after traditions of Elders and
[1:24:15] all this stuff and and Theology and that
[1:24:18] you know he he said watch this he said
[1:24:20] as the wind
[1:24:21] bloweth John 8 again John 38 as the wind
[1:24:26] bloweth where it listeth and thou
[1:24:29] hearest the
[1:24:30] sound but you cannot tell hence it came
[1:24:33] you can't tell how God spoke to me you
[1:24:36] can try to testify I mean we testify and
[1:24:38] we believe in testifying but how can you
[1:24:41] understand the testimony of your life or
[1:24:43] me understand the testimony of anyone in
[1:24:44] your life it's a great
[1:24:47] mystery but to individually it's
[1:24:50] revealed because you can you can't get
[1:24:53] away from God it's a built-in
[1:24:56] conscience that's connected to
[1:25:00] Jehovah amen so is everyone that's born
[1:25:04] of the spirit of God you can't just put
[1:25:06] your finger on
[1:25:08] it that's why in this church we don't
[1:25:10] have a rule book that well if you do
[1:25:13] this you're a member praise God sign
[1:25:14] your name what's that
[1:25:18] mean
[1:25:20] amen God help us
[1:25:24] he said I don't understand how God does
[1:25:27] the mechanics but he said' I know I got
[1:25:29] it and I got the blessings of it he said
[1:25:33] and the mechanics is up to God how he
[1:25:34] works it out he said that's his great
[1:25:37] secret wow amen First Corinthians 14 and
[1:25:41] I'm trying to wind up I'm going to wind
[1:25:43] up on some scriptures here 1 Corinthians
[1:25:45] 14:33 for God's Not the author of confus
[1:25:48] confusion but of Peace as in all
[1:25:51] churches of the Saints for Hebrews 11
[1:25:54] Hebrews 11: 1-2 Now by faith is the
[1:25:58] substance of things hoped for and the
[1:26:01] evidence oh we praise God let's have an
[1:26:03] evidence that I'm serving God it's not
[1:26:07] seen well how am I going to do if you're
[1:26:09] a
[1:26:10] Christian well you know it'll be that
[1:26:14] Spirit I'll just I'll just feel
[1:26:15] comfortable around you cuz you know I
[1:26:18] don't normally feel comfortable around
[1:26:20] people that are swearing and cussing and
[1:26:22] hard and you you know you know brothel
[1:26:26] places I just I don't know it's I can't
[1:26:28] even it's just the air it's like when I
[1:26:30] open the door and O you know the the
[1:26:33] stuff that you can cut with a knife I'm
[1:26:34] not really comfortable in those
[1:26:37] places you won't see it now this is
[1:26:40] Bible Hebrews 1 Hebrews 11:1 for by it
[1:26:44] the elders obtained a good report
[1:26:47] Hebrews
[1:26:49] 121 therefore seeing that we are
[1:26:52] compressed about by such a great cloud
[1:26:54] of witness let it lay aside every way to
[1:26:56] sin that so easiest beset us and let us
[1:26:58] run with patience the race that is set
[1:27:01] before
[1:27:02] us so we come back to our
[1:27:05] question I mean I I know Ministers of
[1:27:08] God that if you ask them this question
[1:27:10] they would just fall right off their
[1:27:12] chair do you remember how you felt when
[1:27:14] you were
[1:27:15] born you maybe do but you're a
[1:27:18] supernatural baby in the flesh if you
[1:27:20] remember exactly how you felt when you
[1:27:21] were born
[1:27:25] do you remember what it was like when
[1:27:26] you first ate or or grew but may is it
[1:27:30] possible is it just even slightly
[1:27:32] possible it could be that way do you
[1:27:35] remember the first time you felt the
[1:27:37] move I can remember as a little boy
[1:27:39] going to the Holiness Rock Lake Camp
[1:27:41] Meeting when I was eight and they would
[1:27:43] give an altar call and they were
[1:27:44] preaching Hellfire and brimstone and I
[1:27:46] would hang on that Pew and I had I had
[1:27:48] made a sound Arrangement agreement I had
[1:27:49] a signed contract I will not be going to
[1:27:52] the altar but be at the
[1:27:57] altar do you remember how that spirit
[1:28:00] moves who understands how you know you
[1:28:03] see what I mean you don't try to put God
[1:28:06] in a box God's a lot bigger than your
[1:28:08] brain amen I know he's revealed the
[1:28:12] Mysteries and the secrets in the Bible
[1:28:13] and I know it's put there for our
[1:28:15] understanding and and and and we want to
[1:28:18] we want to search into it but someday
[1:28:20] you'll understand more perfectly when
[1:28:22] you get there and you walk right up the
[1:28:24] throne say hey Jesus I got a question
[1:28:26] why are
[1:28:28] you Colossians 1 26 and 27 even the
[1:28:32] mystery uhoh what's a mystery something
[1:28:36] you don't understand even the mystery
[1:28:38] which has been head for ages from
[1:28:40] Generations is now being made manifested
[1:28:43] to the Saints that's through the
[1:28:45] prophets to whom God would make known
[1:28:48] The Riches of his glory of the mystery
[1:28:52] Among Us the Gentiles which is
[1:28:57] Christ in you wait a minute that's a
[1:29:00] mystery Christ in anybody that's a
[1:29:06] mystery the hope of
[1:29:08] glory so how do we get an evidence for
[1:29:12] that
[1:29:13] mystery you can't put your finger on
[1:29:16] it you know there will be different
[1:29:19] things happen in different people's
[1:29:21] life when they get to tug of God on
[1:29:24] their heart now I want to I want to show
[1:29:26] you some doctrinal stuff and I'm going
[1:29:28] to back this up with scripture and I'm
[1:29:29] going to shut her
[1:29:31] down you know we don't
[1:29:35] believe you know if you have eternal
[1:29:37] life you've always had eternal life
[1:29:38] because you came from God and we know
[1:29:40] that from Genesis 1:26 and 27 so you
[1:29:43] don't become a seed a god when you got
[1:29:47] saved you always were a seed but you
[1:29:48] hadn't germinated yet so you could be as
[1:29:52] black as Sin you could be the Rahab the
[1:29:54] prostitute in the wall you could be the
[1:29:55] woman at the well but the Bible says
[1:29:58] that Jesus had an appointment with that
[1:30:00] woman and she was predestinated SE to
[1:30:03] God now I'm going to show you about four
[1:30:05] scriptures for that predestinated
[1:30:07] scriptures and and that is one of the
[1:30:08] greatest hopes for the Christian church
[1:30:11] is election
[1:30:13] predestination and what it is is when
[1:30:15] that seed you know the Bible says you
[1:30:17] were redeemed back redeemed back as you
[1:30:21] always were but God took you back to
[1:30:23] your original
[1:30:25] beginning amen that's why Cain could
[1:30:28] never serve God because he never came
[1:30:31] from God Amen that's why Jesus could say
[1:30:34] is in the Bible to the S fues and sares
[1:30:37] he said you are of your fathers the
[1:30:41] devil now that was that was
[1:30:44] God I said that see you're redeemed back
[1:30:48] you're redeemed back to your original
[1:30:52] state amen you know watch this this is
[1:30:54] beautiful I love this part you know when
[1:30:56] God created us in His image he this is
[1:31:00] Bible you can look this up Genesis 1:26
[1:31:02] 27 he said he made manale male and
[1:31:05] female was in one person it was a spirit
[1:31:07] man and God blessed
[1:31:10] both that's why we don't step on our
[1:31:12] wives that that's just that is vomit
[1:31:17] that that that's vomit from hell that's
[1:31:19] just well you're not even converted I
[1:31:21] mean that's just disgusting
[1:31:25] but God that feminine and masculine the
[1:31:27] Bible says that male and female were in
[1:31:30] the spirit of Christ and he blessed them
[1:31:33] both and then in Genesis 2 and don't I
[1:31:36] don't know the scripture but it's but
[1:31:37] Genesis 2 I think 17 and he said then he
[1:31:39] made man in his
[1:31:41] flesh and he made
[1:31:44] Adam and then it wasn't good that Adam
[1:31:47] dwelt alone and he put him to sleep and
[1:31:48] he took his rib out from his wife now I
[1:31:51] want to tell you a great mystery if you
[1:31:53] want to understand God when you get
[1:31:55] married on this
[1:31:56] Earth and you marry your red you think
[1:32:00] alike you breathe alike your wife likes
[1:32:04] hot weather like me she loves being gone
[1:32:06] in January when the weather's bad I mean
[1:32:09] you're one because you were one in the
[1:32:11] beginning that's how it you know watch
[1:32:14] when they asked uh Moses in the Bible
[1:32:17] why did he do a rightman a divorce but
[1:32:18] he said it wasn't so in the beginning
[1:32:21] because a husband and wife were one body
[1:32:24] in God's mind you came out of God male
[1:32:26] and female and he took a rib out of the
[1:32:29] man and and sent her on Earth and praise
[1:32:32] God God sent me to a campground in
[1:32:34] Indiana to find my rib that was walking
[1:32:37] around she'd got way lost way in
[1:32:40] Cucamonga country and I grabbed her back
[1:32:42] cuz she was with me before the
[1:32:44] foundation of the
[1:32:46] world and that's why when you go to
[1:32:49] heaven as husband and wife it might
[1:32:51] you're not going to be there to as as a
[1:32:53] relationship to produce families but
[1:32:56] you're going to be there with your
[1:32:58] soulmate there ain't a single marriage
[1:33:01] that was made in
[1:33:02] heaven sorry that's going to be divorced
[1:33:05] in
[1:33:06] heaven it ain't
[1:33:09] possible cuz you both couldn't come from
[1:33:12] God and one being God sent you separate
[1:33:15] on Earth as a witness to sat that there
[1:33:18] would be a bride in the last day and
[1:33:20] when you die and you go back to Heaven
[1:33:21] you'll be in heaven together y
[1:33:24] yeah amen amen you always work
[1:33:29] together I I I I said I said ridiculous
[1:33:32] things you know the prophet said he said
[1:33:33] if you had the wrong wife here when you
[1:33:35] get to the Millennium you'll have the
[1:33:37] right right wife there because all
[1:33:39] wrongs are made right God don't have
[1:33:41] nothing wrong in heaven and I said if I
[1:33:44] was going to the Millennium and my wife
[1:33:45] couldn't be there I don't even want to
[1:33:49] go that's how much I know she's me and
[1:33:53] that's the same thing with you and
[1:33:55] God I know I'll be there cuz I was with
[1:33:58] them I'm going to show you a scripture
[1:34:00] about
[1:34:03] that you know here in John I I I got to
[1:34:06] go fast but this is just amazing John
[1:34:08] 3:12 and5 I'm going to give you a bunch
[1:34:10] of scriptures John 312: 15 and he told
[1:34:13] if I told you Earthly things and you
[1:34:15] believe them not how shall I tell you
[1:34:16] Heavenly things he said no man ascends
[1:34:19] up into heaven we all believe we're
[1:34:20] saved and go into
[1:34:22] heaven now this is Jesus talking in the
[1:34:24] Bible no man ascends up to heaven but
[1:34:26] first he came down from heaven how
[1:34:28] what's that
[1:34:29] mean that means you know how I know I'm
[1:34:31] going to heaven because I was already in
[1:34:33] heaven I already I already know the
[1:34:35] outlay of
[1:34:38] Heaven I I got multiple scriptures for
[1:34:40] you don't don't leave me yet don't
[1:34:42] nobody get up and walk
[1:34:44] out no man ascends up into heaven but
[1:34:47] first he came down from heaven even the
[1:34:49] son of man which is in heaven right now
[1:34:51] and he was on Earth talking to the
[1:34:52] disciples
[1:34:55] and Moses lifted up as Moses lifted up
[1:34:57] the servant in the wilderness even so
[1:34:59] shall the son of man be lifted up and
[1:35:01] verse 15 and that whosoever believeth on
[1:35:04] him shall not perish but have ever
[1:35:05] eternal life okay let's go to we already
[1:35:08] read Genesis 26 and 27 now if you go to
[1:35:12] Genesis 1 28 or 29 it'll show where it
[1:35:16] was man male and female in one
[1:35:20] body let's jump this you want another
[1:35:22] example of God's election in the
[1:35:24] scriptures here you know you start the
[1:35:26] story and I preached this a long time
[1:35:27] ago but job you know and God God had
[1:35:30] confidence in job he knew Jo go wouldn't
[1:35:32] fall and this was before the Holy Spirit
[1:35:34] was given because Jesus hadn't come the
[1:35:36] perfect sacrifice this is Old Testament
[1:35:38] they're still killing lambs and goats
[1:35:39] saing off their heads so this was a
[1:35:41] covering this wasn't even the perfect
[1:35:43] sacrifice and and job you know Satan
[1:35:46] came before the sons of God Before the
[1:35:48] Throne and he said what are you doing
[1:35:50] Satan he said well I'm going out
[1:35:51] checking out you know who I can tempt
[1:35:53] and God said did you ever consider job
[1:35:55] why did God say that cuz he knew who job
[1:35:58] was he knew Job came from him and he
[1:36:01] knew no matter what God did what God
[1:36:03] allowed to happen to him he would never
[1:36:05] fall and so God God allowed Satan to
[1:36:08] take everything from
[1:36:11] job except his breath he even took his
[1:36:15] health and then he had his
[1:36:20] so-called friends and wife come by and
[1:36:22] say ah you're a sinner you big fat no
[1:36:27] good and then I like this part then Job
[1:36:30] 38 that's where we want to start the
[1:36:32] good part job 38:1 and the Lord came to
[1:36:35] job in a whirlwind and said now I'm
[1:36:39] going to do some talking we've listened
[1:36:42] to all these fat preachers preaching the
[1:36:44] churches but it's about high time that I
[1:36:46] talk to you and watch what he says here
[1:36:49] in job
[1:36:51] 38:1 in verse two he said who is that
[1:36:54] dark
[1:36:55] counsel and the words that lack
[1:36:57] knowledge that's what God thought of
[1:36:59] job's friends dark counsel and words
[1:37:03] with no
[1:37:05] knowledge G he talking to job he said g
[1:37:08] up your loins like a man and God saying
[1:37:11] to job he said I will demand of you this
[1:37:16] answer I this has got to be my favorite
[1:37:19] scripture he job said where were you God
[1:37:23] saying to job where were you when I laid
[1:37:26] the foundations of the
[1:37:28] world I say I was right there I was
[1:37:31] right there I was God's measuring tape
[1:37:33] when he laid her out and said I'm going
[1:37:34] to make her like
[1:37:36] this cuz I was in them and he said where
[1:37:39] were you when the sons of God showed it
[1:37:41] for Joy I was the loudest one there I
[1:37:45] was the one that the deacons had to go
[1:37:47] woo D hold her down don't fly away yet
[1:37:52] where were where were you
[1:37:54] you and I preached the whole sermon on
[1:37:56] of Salvador and that the people went
[1:37:58] completely
[1:38:00] wild because I was in them when God
[1:38:02] spoke the world I was in them when he
[1:38:04] sent his son to the cross I where were
[1:38:06] you when Jesus I was right in
[1:38:09] them Father forgive them for they don't
[1:38:11] know what they did when they stoned
[1:38:14] stepen you a man that should have been
[1:38:16] offended I was right there when he
[1:38:18] looked up to heaven and the Heaven's
[1:38:20] open and the spirit of God came down on
[1:38:22] Stephen he said don't hold this to their
[1:38:24] Church they're a bunch of
[1:38:27] lunatics I was right there that's how
[1:38:31] brother Dale can know that I'll be there
[1:38:34] again amen and that's Bible That's Bible
[1:38:38] where were you in the morning St showed
[1:38:40] it for joy and we go back to verse
[1:38:44] five where or verse four where were thou
[1:38:47] when I laid the foundation of the earth
[1:38:49] declare unto me thy understanding God
[1:38:51] wants job to understand
[1:38:53] that he came from God and he was in
[1:38:56] heaven and God sent him to Earth to
[1:38:58] prove to Satan that job wouldn't fall
[1:39:00] and and job did that and God re blessed
[1:39:03] job back with everything he had ever
[1:39:04] taken let Satan take from
[1:39:07] him and he told Satan see I told you did
[1:39:11] you ever consider my man
[1:39:14] job but today he's saying did you ever
[1:39:16] consider those crazy people in Wyoming
[1:39:19] you just try to charge them you just try
[1:39:22] to lay something on their hands
[1:39:23] they'll never curse
[1:39:26] me amen watch this and he said verse
[1:39:29] seven where where I late where were you
[1:39:32] whereupon when the foundations were laid
[1:39:34] fastened or who laid the Cornerstone and
[1:39:36] when the morning started saying for joy
[1:39:38] and all the sons of God showed it for
[1:39:40] Joy where were you and God saying to job
[1:39:43] I
[1:39:44] demand that you answer me job would say
[1:39:48] well I don't
[1:39:50] know no no if there was something that
[1:39:54] held them you know we're just closing
[1:39:56] I'm just going to finish on two or three
[1:39:58] uh election scriptures you know Genesis
[1:40:01] 4 2
[1:40:03] to8 I'm going to show you where God gave
[1:40:05] room for Cain to repent and in verse
[1:40:09] Genesis uh 42 and she be Cain or she be
[1:40:12] Abel and Abel was The Keeper of the
[1:40:14] sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
[1:40:15] ground in verse three and it was in the
[1:40:18] possession of time that it came that
[1:40:19] came bought the fruits of the ground the
[1:40:21] offering to the Lord but Abel had a rub
[1:40:23] Revelation and he also brought the first
[1:40:26] of his flock and the F thereof and the
[1:40:28] Lord had respects un Abel's offering but
[1:40:32] to Cain's offering he had not respects
[1:40:36] now that's just the
[1:40:38] mystery I mean you can get upset with
[1:40:41] God all you want but that's just what
[1:40:42] happened God liked one person's
[1:40:44] sacrifice and he didn't like the other
[1:40:46] person's sacrifice can I explain that
[1:40:49] it's just God's choice he's God Amen
[1:40:54] and Cain was very rot and his
[1:40:56] countenance fell in verse six and this
[1:40:58] is where I want you see and the Lord
[1:41:00] said to Cain why are you
[1:41:03] wroth and why is thy countenance fell if
[1:41:07] thou doest
[1:41:09] well and would follow the word of God
[1:41:13] would follow the Revelation that your
[1:41:15] brother has that it's
[1:41:17] blood and not flowers
[1:41:28] he said if thou doest well shalt thou
[1:41:30] not be
[1:41:32] accepted God would have totally accepted
[1:41:37] Cain if he would have brought the same
[1:41:40] sacrifice as
[1:41:41] Abel but instead Cain chose to kill him
[1:41:45] his
[1:41:46] brother it was an Inc to repent let's go
[1:41:50] to and I'm I'm I promise I'm closing
[1:41:52] Romans 9:13
[1:41:54] uh 16 and
[1:41:57] 18 and here's this uh another scripture
[1:42:00] of election and it is written Jacob have
[1:42:02] I loved but Esau have I hated and what
[1:42:06] shall we say then is there
[1:42:07] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[1:42:11] he said unto Moses I will have
[1:42:14] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[1:42:19] will have
[1:42:20] compassion on whom I will have
[1:42:24] compassion and that's what we want to
[1:42:26] see in the New Birth is we don't want to
[1:42:28] step in the way of Jehovah God and God
[1:42:31] might want to save a really really black
[1:42:33] sheep that's a prostitute or a murderer
[1:42:36] or in prison or jails or chains of
[1:42:39] bondage or alcoholic or or smok and
[1:42:42] drugs or anything but that could be a
[1:42:44] part of God's seed and it don't look
[1:42:46] like it yet but that's God's choice I
[1:42:50] will have mercy and compassion on whom I
[1:42:52] will have
[1:42:54] mercy and so then is it not him that so
[1:42:58] then is it not us that willth or him
[1:43:01] that runneth but God that showeth Mercy
[1:43:03] now there's a scripture that shows that
[1:43:05] it ain't your decision that you're
[1:43:07] serving
[1:43:08] God I mean you you'd have I mean other
[1:43:11] than the part is be it unto me according
[1:43:13] to Thy word but it was God no man comes
[1:43:17] to the father but God draws
[1:43:19] them amen and this scripture shows this
[1:43:22] so then it's not me that will oh I want
[1:43:24] to be a good Christian I want to go to
[1:43:26] the best church or him that runneth but
[1:43:29] God that showeth Mercy in verse 18
[1:43:31] therefore has he mercy upon whom he will
[1:43:35] have mercy and a upon whom he will
[1:43:39] harden he will harden see God is
[1:43:44] Sovereign and it's God's understanding
[1:43:46] God knows before the beginning Romans
[1:43:51] 811 Romans 11 and then 28 and 30 and I'm
[1:43:56] just showing
[1:43:57] you three or four pre election
[1:44:00] scriptures to prove in the new birth how
[1:44:03] we know we'll be there Romans 81128 and
[1:44:09] 30 Romans 8 but if the spirit of him
[1:44:12] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:44:14] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:44:17] dead so also Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:44:19] and his spirit that dwelleth in you and
[1:44:22] verse Romans 8: 28 these are our
[1:44:25] favorite scriptures
[1:44:27] here verse 28 and I know that all things
[1:44:30] work together for good to them that love
[1:44:33] God to whom are called according to his
[1:44:36] purpose verse 29 for whom God did Forno
[1:44:40] how did he Forno you well you were in
[1:44:43] him and he's omnipotent for whom he did
[1:44:46] Forno he also did
[1:44:49] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:44:51] image of him himself his son that he
[1:44:55] might be the firstborn of many brethren
[1:44:57] in verse 30 moreover whom he did
[1:45:00] predestinate them he also called that's
[1:45:03] when you gave your life to God he called
[1:45:05] you and you came to an altar of
[1:45:08] forgiveness and whom he called them he
[1:45:10] also Justified and whom he justified
[1:45:14] he's already glorified now God already
[1:45:16] sees you in heaven God don't see this
[1:45:19] snowstorm he already sees you converted
[1:45:21] in heaven now if God sees you in heaven
[1:45:25] do you see yourself there God sees you
[1:45:29] there I mean I mean if you don't like
[1:45:31] that scripture like you're you're dead I
[1:45:34] mean there I can't give you nothing that
[1:45:36] you're in like Ephesians 1 3 to 14 now
[1:45:40] this is I'm sorry this is a long one but
[1:45:42] I'll just pick out the pieces here
[1:45:44] Ephesians 1: 3-14 blessed be God the
[1:45:48] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[1:45:50] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:45:52] in heavenly places in
[1:45:54] whom Christ according that he has done

[1:46:33] plan God knew who he would love God knew

[1:47:58] has purposed in himself that in the pred
[1:48:02] Redemption of the fullness of
[1:48:04] time he might gather together one things
[1:48:08] in Christ both which are in heaven which
[1:48:10] are in the earth even in him oh wow

[1:49:37] glory now if you don't believe in
[1:49:38] election this morning and
[1:49:42] predestination uh you got a different
[1:49:44] version of the Bible than I
[1:49:46] got Jeremiah 1:4 to9
[1:49:52] Jeremiah 1: 14-9 and I'm I'm proving to
[1:49:56] you that I was in God and I come back to
[1:49:58] God and that's the reason I know I'll be
[1:49:59] there when I go in the Rapture or with
[1:50:02] this death takes me before the Rapture
[1:50:04] Jeremiah 1 and the word of the Lord came
[1:50:06] unto me saying before I formed
[1:50:09] thee in the
[1:50:12] Bley I knew thee wait a minute wait a
[1:50:17] minute wait a minute God n you didn't
[1:50:19] have nothing to do with that that was my
[1:50:21] mom and dad
[1:50:24] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa before you were
[1:50:27] formed in the belly I how did he know me
[1:50:30] cuz I wasn't even formed
[1:50:32] yet because I was coming from
[1:50:35] him I was spoken word God said you go
[1:50:39] down to OT and hell and langstaff and
[1:50:40] you got to have an eighth child and it's
[1:50:43] going to be some scrawny squirt that's
[1:50:44] going to be born like a giant you know I
[1:50:47] was
[1:50:48] almost almost almost 11 PBS in the
[1:50:51] hospital when I was born I was eating
[1:50:53] faum within two or three days and I
[1:50:55] could hold my head up and look at the
[1:50:57] nurses out of the glass thing and they
[1:50:59] were taking pictures and they were
[1:51:00] giggling and thought I was half grown
[1:51:02] when I was
[1:51:03] born that's a true
[1:51:05] story amen he knew me before I was
[1:51:09] formed and before thou camest forth from
[1:51:12] the womb I sanctify wait a minute wait a
[1:51:15] minute it was my decision to come to God
[1:51:19] that's not what that Bible says
[1:51:24] I was in a I was in the service and they
[1:51:26] had this Dynamic evangelist and the
[1:51:29] power of God fell and I made a decision
[1:51:31] to come forward to give my heart to God
[1:51:33] that's not what the scripture
[1:51:36] says says I Sanctified the before you
[1:51:39] were even making
[1:51:41] decisions Hallelujah God didn't leave
[1:51:44] nothing to
[1:51:48] chance Hallelujah and before I came
[1:51:51] forth in the womb I San if I Thee and I
[1:51:53] ordained thee a prophet to the
[1:51:58] Nations Hallelujah and if you go down to
[1:52:01] the bottom of verse 8 n and then the
[1:52:03] Lord put forth his hand and touched my
[1:52:05] mouth and said the Lord said unto me
[1:52:07] behold I have put my words in thy mouth
[1:52:10] and my last scripture is a
[1:52:12] habca I think I'm saying that right
[1:52:15] ha akk

[1:52:23] for this old dummy habca 15 and we're
[1:52:26] going to close in this scripture I got a
[1:52:27] blank screen after this so we're good to
[1:52:29] shoot man behold ye among the heathens
[1:52:33] and regard and wonder
[1:52:38] marvelously for I will work a work in
[1:52:42] your
[1:52:43] day which ye will not
[1:52:46] believe though it be told of you
[1:52:54] wow only the ones that can
[1:52:58] believe are the ones that were there to
[1:53:00] begin with it's a great mystery the new
[1:53:03] birth so how can you pin down do I got
[1:53:07] the new birth it's you and God and
[1:53:11] you'll know when your heart turned to
[1:53:12] Christ and you'll know when God threw
[1:53:14] out the fish hook and he started pulling
[1:53:17] you in you were swimming the other way
[1:53:20] God was like no no you don't
[1:53:23] you can run with me you can be the
[1:53:24] prodical son you can run away and go to
[1:53:26] the pig pen a long
[1:53:28] time but when you come to your senses
[1:53:32] it'll be God waking you up someday and
[1:53:34] you go you know I got a God in heaven
[1:53:38] that treats
[1:53:40] his better than the Satan's treating me
[1:53:43] you ever see Satan treat anybody good he
[1:53:45] eat devour and Destroy his
[1:53:49] own he said I got a daddy that his
[1:53:52] servants eat better than I do with the
[1:53:55] Hogs they give the Hogs the Grain and I
[1:53:58] get the hostage left
[1:54:00] over but you know the amazing part the
[1:54:03] greatest part of that whole
[1:54:04] story is the daddy you know God works on
[1:54:09] both
[1:54:12] ends how did the daddy know that the son
[1:54:16] was coming
[1:54:21] back the the Bible says that he was out
[1:54:24] there and seen the sun returning a far
[1:54:28] off and he said wo kill the fatty C and
[1:54:32] get out of gold ring and put on
[1:54:34] ownership on his finger you know how he
[1:54:36] knew it because God had gave him your
[1:54:38] children are your heritage you believe
[1:54:41] for you and your
[1:54:43] household the Jailer what must I do to
[1:54:47] be
[1:54:48] saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:50] and you and
[1:54:59] Hallelujah Jesus amen you know you know
[1:55:03] God help me and maybe maybe maybe this
[1:55:08] would be something for you but we can't
[1:55:10] put God in a
[1:55:11] box that's right God God's spirit of
[1:55:14] life will work different in each one a
[1:55:17] use and when you say I got God you know
[1:55:20] you know the prophet said that
[1:55:22] if you come before somebody and say I
[1:55:24] know everything there is to know about
[1:55:25] God run for your life run for your life
[1:55:30] cuz you just met the first liar or the
[1:55:33] biggest
[1:55:34] one now I I I know I believe that God
[1:55:39] you know like Amos 3:7 he says he would
[1:55:41] do nothing but he re his Secrets through
[1:55:42] His prophets I believe God has come and
[1:55:44] showed us what who he is in his word and
[1:55:47] I believe the Mysteries are open in the
[1:55:49] Bible and I believe we can understand
[1:55:50] Revelations and I know that the seals
[1:55:52] were open and and I know I'm going back
[1:55:54] in a Rapture but when you
[1:55:58] say you know like the guy that is in uh
[1:56:02] where is he in
[1:56:04] Florida he put his whole life to proving
[1:56:07] God and he has great videos out where he
[1:56:10] can show where the children of Israel
[1:56:11] not that I need to see that to believe
[1:56:13] it you you sent me some of them brother
[1:56:15] bar you know he can show where the
[1:56:16] children of Israel cross the Red Sea and
[1:56:18] they they know where the rock is where
[1:56:20] the water come out of the rock and you
[1:56:22] know he'll go and show you where the ark
[1:56:24] is you know everybody knows that the
[1:56:26] Army knew that during the
[1:56:29] war but he put put his whole life to
[1:56:32] prove God you know and there's a video
[1:56:34] out there where there's this guy and
[1:56:35] he's asking him to identify God by
[1:56:38] feelings and you know he didn't believe
[1:56:40] God could be a spirit and affect the
[1:56:41] human body and oh boys that guy he just
[1:56:46] you know you know Satan he's kind of
[1:56:49] he he needs more school
[1:56:53] he saidwell if you can't understand how
[1:56:54] a spirit could affect a human body then
[1:56:57] you'd have to understand you'd have to
[1:56:58] explain to me emotion and
[1:57:01] love you love your wife well I'd like to
[1:57:04] have some of that love can I buy it what
[1:57:06] do they sell it at the dollar store
[1:57:08] emotion he said if your emotions are
[1:57:11] just a whole bunch of scrambled stuff
[1:57:13] that was like poof and you he said I'm
[1:57:16] not so sure I'd feel safe in your
[1:57:18] emotion
[1:57:20] world yeah yeah
[1:57:23] he was explaining how anyway he goes and
[1:57:25] says that he said you know the god that
[1:57:27] created the computer ain't living in the
[1:57:28] computer he's outside of the computer
[1:57:30] and he knows all about the computer but
[1:57:31] he was a mastermind of the computer but
[1:57:33] he's in the universe God is a spirit and
[1:57:36] those that worship Him must worship Him
[1:57:37] in spirit and truth and when the spirit
[1:57:39] of truth comes it will lead and guide
[1:57:41] you in all truth and watch this he said
[1:57:44] if the god you're serving this morning
[1:57:47] you can completely understand and your
[1:57:50] three-b brain is it's not the God I
[1:57:54] got that's right because my God is above
[1:57:57] your three-b brain there's not a man on
[1:58:00] the
[1:58:01] universe that could put their finger and
[1:58:03] say that's God that's God there that's
[1:58:06] God there that's God there he's over
[1:58:08] here and he's here and he's in Uganda
[1:58:10] and he's in El Salvador and soal America
[1:58:12] and and Africa
[1:58:14] and and then the Rapture comes place
[1:58:17] there will be a many member bride there
[1:58:19] will be lots of surprises too but there
[1:58:20] will be lots of lots and lots of
[1:58:23] Believers from all over the world God's
[1:58:25] not just saving wyomi and Canadians and
[1:58:28] ontarians there'll be a many membered

[1:58:34] Our God's amazing that's just in a
[1:58:36] nutshell he's amazing and the New Birth

[1:59:13] some of the doctors like $100,000 if
[1:59:16] they'd give him 6 hours of sleep with
[1:59:19] drugs because he was so possessed

[1:59:24] devil he was so
[1:59:28] tormented that Satan was eating them
[1:59:30] from within and he was asking the
