foundation of the world you swept over our soul and we're so glad you're we're yours hallelujah blessed to be your wonderful wonderful wonderful name for all of eternity blessed be your name jesus christ our lord hallelujah hallelujah bless you and he is just beyond amazing god bless you musicians and thank you jared for singing songs that are not the same every sunday amen thank you lord bless you all so so wonderful to see you and be here amen man just a announcement john dankwa has young people meetings next weekend friday saturday and sunday it's mark becker from germany young brother middle of my brother preaching a man i plan to go friday night at least and next sunday brother henry is going to be here with us and minister for us um brother henry amen and also just remember brother jim and sister linda they love you and appreciate you and they're 100 part of us amen and jim's sister-in-law has moved in with them so he plans to be with us much more often she's just maybe not fully moved in yet or so that's that's linda's sister linda's sister amen and also remember sister kim and the boys we had him out this week and had a wonderful time actually a friend of sister kim's and and just kim's just just doing her best man just remember them and it was amazing her friend was a small world her friend been friend for years was their name left me the groots her dad bought the cattle at timsville when i would have been there with my dad like 50 years ago she used to go with her dad to the sale they own sarnia meatpackers that's where we got all our beef killed so it's a small world small world amen amen well i really believe god is just beyond what we can comprehend and uh i hope it i pray my greatest prayer would be that you catch this that god give me and and it might seem like i've it's similar trends i can't preach nothing new the bible is all the same trend it's jesus christ and my thought came on relationships and then i went to investigate and it really showed how a relationship makes you his every relationship you know in a family makes you part of each other and it's it's just it's a man it's just like the song said thank you lord i'm yours just it's just unbelievable i'll just give you a pinch of a preview if you weren't his you never can be his you never can be and and god is trying to show us why things happen even in the church now let me show you what the prophet said and a preview of that is not all israel is israel and you can't be if you aren't it's not possible amen let's do into colossians 1 and 26 and i'm going to read these quicker vicky we got to talk but i have literally hundreds of quotes that we got to get so we can put them on the screen because some people don't listen to my chinese and maybe if they could see it they could some people connect more by reading i really i wish they normally when i print off my quotes i erase them off my ipad but i think if i left them on here you could actually put them through the computer i think you could anyway that's a great goal that i would like to change i don't see sis patricia just remember her this morning galatians 20 uh here at 27. even the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from generations but now has made manifested to you the saints to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory let's go over to matthew 7 and this is a just a fantastic scripture matthew 7 and 21 and we're going to read down to 28 matthew 7 and i'm just going to start here and not everyone that saith lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but him that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and many shall say unto me in that day lord lord have i not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have i not cast out devils and then thy name have i not done many marvelous wonderful works and he will and then will i profess unto them i never knew you yours depart from me ye workers of iniquity that means if you're a christian if you're part of israel and you don't know you you're working iniquities therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man that built the house upon the rock and the rains descended and the floods came the rock of revelation and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not because it was a founded upon the rock revelation amen and everyone that heareth these saints of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man that built his house upon the sand and the reigns descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall thereof now jesus is telling you this parable to try to show you a life story and he said it came to pass that jesus had ended these saints the people were astonished astonished at his doctrine they're still astonished amen hallelujah lord jesus we ask you just well we know you're already here so we we don't ask you to come we thank you for coming we ask you to stay we asked you to reveal unto your people what you showed me little glimpses of in our studies lord jesus and we'll praise you forever for all of eternity in your beautiful name we pray amen god bless you you may have your seats let's turn over to first corinthians 11 and i'm trying to lay a foundation here and this is an amazing paradox this is just it's actually mind-blowing it it it's it's blowing my mind and it's just i it's i want you to catch this revelation our prophet said that everything is built on revelation the our prophet actually said that the reason he was so misunderstood was because of revelation the revelation that christ gave him to bring a message wow it's it's just this i'm telling you this is this is this is christ in his family and it has nothing to do with religion nothing at all hallelujah it's amazing first corinthians 11 we're going to start at 3 and then we're going to jump down to 8. and but i would not have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god now christ is the anointed one and god is a spirit amen and those that worship him must worship in the spirit and truth and let's just drop down to eight and man is not of the woman neither is but the woman of the man just like we are of god god any of us but we are of god you see what i mean and the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man i want to show you something you were created for god god was not created because god always was and he's elohim but you were created for god and i'm going to show you some scripture that it's just beautiful hallelujah and for this cause out of a woman to have power over his head because the angels nevertheless neither is a man without the woman neither is god without you god is not made perfect without you because you're part of god so god's incomplete there's always a man incomplete without his wolves not good that man dwell alone or was it i see amen if you really find your soul mate you're one the bible says they are one neither is it good that man is without the woman neither the woman without the man in what see how he's bringing the spirit it's just beautiful it has very little to do with flesh in the lord hallelujah and as a woman is of the man even so is the man by the woman but all things in god hallelujah now you were wondering and i'm glad you asked you were wondering how are we made for god and first colossians i guess we were there before first colossians again and verse 16. it says for by him were all things created and that which is in heaven and that which is in the earth visible and non-visible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers or all things were created by jehovah alleluia he's in control no matter how the election went hallelujah and they were created by him and for him you were created for god woo you were created for god the woman was created from and for the man you were created from god and for god oh buddy if somebody don't lose their mind this place is going to blow hallelujah you know every tank has a safety valve hallelujah john 17 and then 17-3 will start and then go to 21 and this life eternal that they might know the the one and only true god jesus christ whom thou has sent and dropped to 21 and that they may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one with us that the world may believe that thou has sent me john 17 and verse 22 now john 17 and verse 22 and the glory which thou has given me i give on to them you're not supposed to be sad god never intended that you have no idea the thoughts that god has towards you a wife ain't supposed to be sad in her castle neither did god intend you to be on earth sad in your castle hallelujah the glory that thou has given me i have given to them and they may be one even as we are one that's that's more than one that's part of each other that's soulmate like husband and wife if you get the right one and i in them endow in me and they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them and thou has loved me father i will that thou also whom thou has given me be with me where i am that thou may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before he loveth you before the foundation of the world oh that's that's that's almost too much that's just amazing here god here our prophet tells the story in 64 calling jesus on the scene and he says you know you husbands and your wives there's just something about your wife or husband and you can't even figure it out why you love them you know man if you were to marry the and you're the right kind of husband there's a woman in the world that you love like your wife there's no woman and there might be other women that are much fairer there might be other women that are much prettier and so forth but there's something that you really love your wife now there's something in there that you don't even notice you know the bible says this is just so perfect christ the bible says in ephesians 4 it says that no man ever ever hateth his own flesh there wouldn't be many divorces husbands love your wives as even your own flesh and the very next verses and there no man has ever hated his own flesh so god can't hate those that are his hallelujah there's just something that you really love their wife and there's something there that you don't even notice what she looks like you just love her and you don't know why but you're crazy about her you love her the woman the same to her husband and you love that person and you young girls and you young boys and girlfriends and boyfriends if you ever meet the person that's the same as your soul mate you will have a love for that person that's something in there and you don't know why you love them he said that's exactly like genuine faith he said it's a thing about faith that's happening and it's a shadow no matter how you would say contrary no matter what the world would say that you're just the littlest group in town meeting today it will mean nothing to you because you already met the boss hallelujah and reserving of the age our prophet says these words and i might be reading too many quotes but maybe just would skip to a scripture here john 17 or john 15 sorry 18 21 and i just want to i want to i i probably am not going to finish this but i'm not going to hurry because it's too good and we'll just pick up wherever we stop and the world hateth ye and ye know not that it hateth me before it hates you you you see the same person the same characteristics spoon for the ocean or the whole ocean same ocean same person and if you were of the world the world would love its own but because you are are you getting not of the world but you have but i have chosen you it had nothing to do with us like weird neutralness but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you because you are me remember that the world that i said unto you that the servant is not greater than his lord and if thou persecuteth thou me christ if they persecuted god they will also persecute you because you're not greater than jehovah it was like jehovah said you know the prophet said people misunderstood jesus when when and we're going to read that when jesus gave the definition of who he was jehovah and and all the people get up to leave you know how he chased after them he asked the handful that was there are you going to go also that's how he chased after them and peter said those great revelation words but where would we go that's how god chased after the other ones wow remember the word that i said unto you this uh for if they have kept my sayings they will keep yours also watch see what watch that if they had kept god's sayings they'll keep my sayings too because i'm just repeating what god said in the bible amen they'll keep yours also no no jesus said that by the way but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake because they know him they know not him that sent me even though they look exactly like you and could sit on your pew i mean i'm going to read you the prophet said things like that i'm not making that up let's go to john also john 6 and we're i want to read some you can jump around john 6 would be an amazing chapter to read it's a really long chapter but i want to i want to catch three verses and tell you some history on that john 6 and let's go to uh 4 44 first and no man cometh unto me except the father has sent me draw him so you didn't seek out god god sought out god in you okay which and i will raise him up in the last day now you have is that an amazing hope it don't matter if you die before the resurrection or after the or the rapture before the rapture after the rapture you're going to be raised up the last day if god drawed amongst you now the very proof that you feel part of god is that god there's two proof number one you're drawn to god and then the final proof is you will have the exact same character as god many are called but few have the character many are called but few are chosen to the chosen see you can't come from god and not be a god jesus said that thy own word called thy you gods okay but listen i i find this amazing i'm going to throw this in here this is free but you know many times see parents get married and they have their kids and they look exactly like their parents how's that possible well the same way that you look exactly like god now watch this you do something that god don't do i this just came to me i don't know this morning after i said he said you know parents have kids and they look identical to their kids and they do exactly what you did when you were in my house as kids and you spanked your kids because they did exactly what you did god don't do that some kids didn't learn that on their own no i'm going somewhere with that your kids that do exactly what you did when you were a kid didn't learn that on their own and neither if you came from god and you do exactly what god did you didn't learn that on your own a matter of fact you didn't even learn that in the host of god it brings it to your memory again but you didn't learn it from there it goes way back into the gene pool whoa you know the prophet talked about genes i think 21 times i have this from memory but the last four messages he preached he mentioned it 18 times because god was leaving the scenes he was pulling his prophet i mean god wasn't leaving the scene sorry god was leaving the scenes in the form of a prophet and he wanted to know you are you are me oh church i can't make you any happier than that sorry chris ain't that something 46. so so he's going to raise something the last day and we can't go to god unless he drew us because we're part of god no now watch us i had never seen this verse before no man has seen the father the bible says nobody's seeing god at any time and lived but i've seen god you've seen god i've never seen this before this is as fresh as it gets yesterday save he which is of god if you're of god you've seen the father oh come on church no man has ever seen god but i've seen him because he was my papa no man has ever seen the father save he which is is of god and he has seen god all by day i told you john 6 was a good one 63 now i'm skipping a whole bunch now here's where jesus say you know he talks about the the parable of feeding the is the israelites and the manna from heaven and he said i am the bread from heaven and the disciples the tree people in the church that walked out and of course the religious people the pharisees and that they were they were already gone they had left the split before but they disciple the bible says the disciples murmuring about themselves how how can god be brad sent from heaven like we didn't eat him we ate manna uh-huh they didn't understand them amen and jesus knew they were splitting hairs but i don't but it's all in there if you read it and 63 and it says and the spirit thou quickeneth it's the spirit that quickly this what's god a spirit it's revelation and the spirit question is but this old flesh that knows all the law has all the message memorized it knows how long i came to church it knows who the best ten preachers are it knows all the people that died and went on before us and it knows that you're supposed to do certain things a certain way and it it knows you're supposed to cut the lettuce certain somebody told me they said did you know anything about lattice and cut and lettuce they said what are you talking about they said i didn't think you did you want to believe god's got they said but in the kitchen there were certain people that wanted to let us cut a certain way so i have no clue what you're talking about she said i wondered if you did when you were preaching last sunday prophetess the flesh prophetess nothing nothing that's that's not a lot that's that's nothing and the words that i spake unto you they are spirit and they're life so they're everything the words i speak are everything and the flesh is nothing too bad the person that thought the flesh of jesus was in heaven when the bible says heaven and earth don't flesh don't inherit the kingdom of heaven they need to read this verse too oh it's unbelievable the false doctrines that earth there 65 this is at a power we could preach the rest of to the rapture on this one chapter and he said therefore i say unto you that no man can come this is still jesus talking by the way no man can come to me except it was first given to him of the father before the foundation of the world it's not possible for you to be saved but he said let me just jump ahead and i read hundreds of quotes hundreds he said but but but lord i had your spirit fall on me a matter of fact i had to go back and really look at these because the prophet almost went below my it was it was amazing he said but lord i had your spirit fall on me and i sang under the anointing he said i don't doubt that one bit he said but lord i had your spirit following me and i prophesied he's i don't doubt that one bit but lord i had your spirit fall on me and i prayed for the sick and they recovered he said i don't doubt that one day you know what our prophet said you're gonna have to think up on this one for a minute our prophet said are you gonna have the baptism of the holy ghost on the spirit your spirit and go straight to hell your flesh has take smell here feel all these things but the spirit has what the spirit has the i don't just from memory it has and you're going to have the baptism and you know how the prophet says that he said it's not that that goes to heaven it's your soul so if you don't think that it'll be so close that it will deceive this is not me this this is i'm preaching on relationships okay that's where my but god's showing you not to worry about what happens not all the relationships are important relationships it's family relationships we sang the song the end of service i'm so glad i'm a part of if you're the children of abraham you're the same family you might have different parents on earth but you're the same parent it goes it goes on that tree goes back and connects up to god oh and nobody can sit and stay by you that didn't come from that tree they won't be at the family reunion in the millennium even though they believe the message they believe god sent a prophet they have long hair long dresses long tongues and and that's the truth intense they're resuming the eights uh now this is a whole just i it was a coloring book see kids it's all right to color it's going to take a minute but there's a couple things in here and from our studies you'll already learn so much that the revelation is totally misunderstood okay but god can do nothing without revelation but with revelation they get up and leave i think that means we're going to be pretty small for a long time it it's not because we don't like people let me go on because we have formally known because we have formally known now this is wrong teaching the the prophet talked about wrong teaching he says you know in north america we teach that if you want to get healed you have to have laying on a hand and and we i learned this in if somebody wants to listen to the message he said that day at calvary it's about a 60 it's in the 60s that day at calvary i i have about six pages from that message that day caliber that's a great message to listen to the day of calvary and he said you know when i go to africa and one person would get healed the whole 10 000 people would get healed not north america no way no way every 10 000 person wants to come up stand in front of me have them read their life story and then hold their hands on them so they gotta they gotta like like seeing god wasn't enough they gotta like smell his clone and touch them zero faith and bad teachings amen you know why it's just wow you know we believe in noise we believe worship worship you unless i stand to be corrected but i don't believe you can worship quietly but everything else can be quiet and what god's doing right now is quiet i i i actually i was going to say something's almost false but like i've never heard of wheat field in the natural right before the combine comes and it's dry and you can hear it drying now i have heard tree foil because it pops when it gets dry but our prophet said the only thing left for us to do i love this you see it don't have nothing to do with us pentecostal people hate this and the reason they hate it is they're in the flesh now i like being in the flesh but it don't have nothing to do with my flesh if god makes my flesh happy i'll be happy but see your pentecostal you think you're gonna really do something god don't need you but he does need you see god can do things silently i think the prophet said he said god sucks more water off the earth without a speck of sound than you can pump on a hundred wells crickety crocketty chrome just where was it where'd it go where's god where to go he tells the story of the wagon you know anybody's a farmer he said you know i'm back to lane to pick up wagon he said it was clearly clinging to the blind everything he went back and i put all the good fruits on of god like the five-fold ministry i say that because nobody likes to fight for ministry bless god we can stay home and listen to tapes the prophets are a pastor oh you illegitimate ignorant deceived person and he said after i put the good gifts that god gave to the church on the wagon he said i come up the exact same lane and hit the exact same bumps and don't make no sound at all amen he said we're formally known that the church spoken of and spoken to in this book does not refer to the pure what was that word he said this morning ecclesiastical the elect the body of christ so a lot of the teaching that talks about the church of god the spoken of the book does not refer to the pure ecclesical or the elect of god the body of christ the bride but it speaks of the entire body of people who are called christians whether they and i'm reading by the way so you can get really mad but this is from a vindicated prophet whether they be true or merely nominal i thought christians were christians you know the prophet preached some of his earlier message and they would ask people they said are you a christian they said well i'm a baptist and he said i asked you if you were a baptist are you a christian he said why are you a christian no i'm a pentecostal are you chris no i'm the brethren he said well you know are you christian but okay now we've moved forward in progressive revelation now i want to ask you are you a christian well there's even two kinds of them we're on to something good i say pursue it okay whether they be true or merely nominal as all of israel is not and it's in capital letters israel so are all christians are not in capital letters christians and you were getting upset because you thought you had done something wrong it had nothing to do with what your flesh did or how you cut the lettuce or what you said or nothing it was your birth way back to the foundation of the world and god never asked you about that ain't that amazing i don't know one person that was ever born that asked about the birth you see that was god's decision did we read god chose god so so just let her go huh so all christians are not christians thus we learned that the church is made up of two minds the true mind and the false mind which we've referred that in the scripture before and the two minds are motivated by two kinds of spirits i say we should listen to this and one has the holy spirit wait wait i want to show you this those people are sitting in message churches now there's none sitting in here because we've cleaned out i'm serious well i tell you what well the prophet said he could tell by the fives coming back to him i'm not the prophet in that sense but i can tell who's enjoying the word okay is that fair it's fair to me amen but two kinds of spirit one is the holy spirit while the other one is enduring with the spirit of antichrist you mean antichrist wears a suit and tie and has the chokes your throat by the way and has a long hair and a long dress and long tongue and yup yup no no this is available to all who want to read it after you know both claim watches both claim to know god to be to to know and to be known of god both claim to know and to be known of god we're together both purpose purport thank you honey purport now what's for part b anybody know i'll help you purport means to appear or claim to to appear or to claim to be see they they appear to be christian or bright they claim to be bride or something especially you should listen falsely professing see professing to be bride falsely wow now this is a paraphrase from google that answers what this purport report means she is not the person she purports to be and you felt bad that they left well did you want to have fellowship with satan said the spirit of antichrist somebody's at the door too you want to check right that means whoa spirit of christ amazing both believe certain very basic truths and the difference and difference on others but since both bear the name of the lord god's bride follow me we feel bad when they you don't have to now god never see you thought you were supposed to be sad that to be sad is to be upset that god did god bless you to be sad that god picked the wrong family man it was god that for new you before the foundation of the world it's beautiful amen purport so they both purport or speak to god they both tell you and they act like their bride but they're not both pride they both believe most of what we believe the same but since both bear the name of the lord being called christians and by such a name bearing the obvious claim watch you so now we're getting to the good part of relationship it's impossible to have a relationship with god if you didn't come from god it's not possible you can't have a relationship with somebody you're not part of and and i'm gonna go farther with that one and god never intended for people to have an intimacy relationship with somebody that is not their soul mate that's why god introduced marriage and that's why god said in the millennium that your wife would be with you and if you got the wrong one on earth you would have the right one there because god makes all wrongs right now that's just what our prophet said oh buddy because see she is we are him and she is what's what god has put together spiritually you thought i was talking about the flesh what god put together what god put in his family before the foundation of the world through predestination oh church it's beautiful it's beautiful they bear the claim of relationship to him and god oh wow wow i didn't even i must have read that yesterday and in brackets it says and god calls it marriage now do you think god married somebody that wasn't his that would make him ah no no never happened and god now holds them both responsible to him therefore he speaks to each now further we learn that the two minds grow side by side until the end age and both would come to maturity that's why it's so obvious in our age we're blessed for that and both come to maturity and both come to the harvest and the true false mind would not overcome watches the false mind the false truth will not overcome the real mind but neither will the vindicated word of god from the word of our absolute and an absolute message from a prophet ever change the deity of the gene of god it'll never happen it says neither will the true mind ever be able to bring the false vine into a saving relationship with jesus christ wow and you were feeling bad about it wow does this give anybody peace relation does this this help you understand all the whys it helps me understand but why they seem to be such nice people and we learned the most amazing truth that the holy spirit could could and would fall watches could and would fall upon the ungenerated false fine christians and manifest powerful and various signs and wonders see you thought they were really god's pride this is just amazing to me even judas was identified in the ministry of the holy ghost through him himself and was pronounced a devil and he sat in the message church prayed for the sick prophesied and all those things that the pentecostal people wanted to see he did it whoa these same principles in mind we start to trace through the whole church in the various seven ages see wow preaching you just throw out the net and god does the rest it's god that won't lose any that were in his hand it's god's family see how the relationship you see we're going the prophet said that we're in this serious hour and the word it i have it here in sing but i'm just preaching from the noise the word is becoming life it's it's changing it's coming alive you're you're going into the veil and you're having intimacy with who you are jehovah and those that aren't a part of that will never go behind that veil and you thought it was your fault you see god would that none would be lost and we're definitely not judges the bible tells us not to judge don't judge unless we be judged but god through predestination omnipotent meant he knew the beginning from the end wow modern events made clear by prophecy we see this in in in the beautiful uh scene of technology uh you can go to the scripture in messy tub and you can get all the quotes that the prophet says about every verse now we read matthew 7 23 i think the prophet had well right it has right there he had 69 comments to one verse now if i read all them comments we'd be on this series for a few days amen but modern events made clear by pharisees he said you find people and many people can't believe that even spirit-filled people and i'm going to give you something that'll choke you that the baptism the holy ghost don't mean you're going in now the bible says you have to be born again your soul amen now the prophet says that this is going to choke you not at all he said not on that don't have anything to do with your soul that's the baptism see here's the inside soul in here and that has to come for you to be there that inside soul that had to come from god you ain't never going back to god if you didn't come from god no man has said in john 3 13 no man ascended up to heaven but first he came down from heaven even the son of man that's in heaven right now and he was talking on the ground that's got to be one of my most favorite scriptures amen but then on the outside of you you have five senses the five inlets to contact your earthly home inside you have the spirit and there is five outlets conscience love uh with genuine spirit of god conscious love and so forth the five outlets to your spirit and remember in that spirit you can be bapti have the genuine baptism of the spirit of god and still be lost wow it's the soul that lives and it's the soul that's ordained of god that's a 65 quote that's 12 months that's that's two weeks before he died that's where the word was becoming life and god was going to get a message out right before he was gone a lot of things changed a lot of things changed and in people's three-pound brain they cannot comprehend jehovah and i can't either you thought you were going to say i could only by revelation that's amazing grace wow in jehovah jireh 64 part 1. he said and that's the way it is in any life it takes god it isn't that you do it's what god does you say i sought god i sought god i'm a great person he said you're mistaken no man seeks god but god seeks men and it's not seeking god it's god seeking you jesus said i you haven't chosen me but i have chosen you and you were chosen before the foundation of the world and it wasn't chosen or you wasn't chosen at all he just come to redeem those names that were already predestinated ain't that beautiful but see the power of god was so great it affected ones that were not predestinated amen it's it's it's not our fault it's not it's not even god's fault it's just god knew who were part of him you can't explain it let's go back to the quote where he talks about your wife if you got your soul mate you don't know why you love her tell you what he talks to young boys and young girls and parents you need to be wise on this and even you were listening to minister friday night and and part of it was right and part of it was you know our prophet said that you should always encourage your daughters to marry young of course there has to be somebody but it has to be their soulmate and you wouldn't want them to marry r r if they weren't ready or it wasn't their soul mate of course not you never marry a non-believer you might as well be a non-believer if it ain't your soul mate because it'll be hell on earth because it ain't part of you but when you see the part of you you'll never be able to explain it it'll just be wow huh and when you see god you'll never be able to explain it to the 70 that get up and walked out it'll just be wow won't it you say and jesus said well are you 12 going to go toe and it's just like wow and all the 70 that walked out which was the large majority there were going revelation was our prophecy the number one reason that he was misunderstood was because of prevalence oh church jared started singing that song this morning oh buddy i'm so glad on your smart i'm so glad i'm all your tender mercy let's follow this old boy i'm so glad you found me after you sent me oath to prove to lucifer that in this last day of laodicean with corruption and rich and increased with goods and don't need god no matter what health care and government care and i'm so glad that you found me amen oh wow so glad you found me and made me yours sorry mama oh it's amazing church jesus said those names that are not on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world they're not going to be there the ones that aren't on the limbs it don't matter if you wear your dress below your ankles it won't matter if you grow your hair until it drags and drags on the ground three feet behind you it won't matter if you go to church 75 times a week you know i wanted to show you something and and of course we believe in holiness because the bible says no man will see god without holiness i wanted to show you something that'll make you just in the middle of this i was going to read it earlier it'll make you i wanted to make you think about holiness so god there's things that god intended us to do and they won't be la if you're married they won't be low oh no no no oh man i think next week we're going to get into the you say well how do i know whether he knows me or not there's a way how do i know like now these these were christians believers they got to have it and they're expecting to go into their message believers they're following the message of the prophet and they're expected to go into heaven and jesus says i don't know you depart from me your worker of iniquity now can you imagine the look that would fall on their faces stunned sheer white ghosts stunned eternally lost and they thought they were okay do you know how you there is a way to know you'll be in a relationship number one it'll be a let me rephrase that the woman was made for the man god created us for himself it'll be passionate it'll be passionate number one your love will not have grown cold it won't be like the sabbath church age where god spews you out of your mouth because he ain't doing that to his pride it'll be passionate but there's something else see back in genesis the blood was pure and abraham married his half-sister okay you can marry you know we go today we go brothers and sisters getting married that's just wrong but in genesis it was raped from the creation and it was pure what's god doing you came from god but he's marrying you okay so yes you're going to go in behind the inner bell and you're going to have an intimacy relationship with god yes oh i believe that with all of my heart but even before then now watches even before you knew everything you know now you will still just oh i'm glad you're gonna ask you would still display the characteristics of your daddy curtis looks identical to jared 33 years ago identical it's like reincarnation and you look identical to your daddy before the foundation of the world and you say what but how do oh oh there's there's a way there's a way the bible says that our pr what and the bible says and our prophet said oh that i'm telling you god is just unbelievable you know i just had like one word god just one word and i just went in and just it was just like i could have printed off 300 papers it was unbelievable it was just it was just unbelievable i was just like man our prophet said jesus was jehovah and he was a lamb led to the slaughter for me and for you to redeem the names that were part of him and he didn't even consider that he was paying a big price it was it was not even amen not not the real jesus oh the flesh didn't want to die and he said now i'm jumping way ahead so i'm spoiling next sunday he said if you're a believer you're living for others and he said now i'm gonna i'm just paraphrasing i might come to this quote you say no you said it twice well i'm telling you by memory so the brother brown had people come up to me said oh but brother brown you know you know mr susie she never had money to heat her house and so i bought some coal and i bought her some bananas so she had something to eat and that and you know what's a prophet called you're gonna need oxygen he said you low down hypocrite you mean to tell me that you're actually telling me what you did you mean to tell me that you're letting the right hand know what the left hand did he said you do that so naturally you just do that so naturally like you're just like christ well like you're just so natural you just walk up to the cross you throw your arms out drive the nails in because that's just who you are you're the sacrificial man and he said you will live for other i'm not saying you know i'm not talking about welfare but you will do things for others and you won't even be it won't even it won't even be like you don't have to like premeditate it it's just like he said that dozens and dozens and maybe in the hundreds of times we'll get to there let me show you how society has changed in brother dale's very short life you know in brother dale's short life there was no such thing as cordless anything even i even remember when cbs come out they were the first cordless thing and the and the antenna had to be 20 feet tall it was so tall our antenna on dad's old chrysler car would hit hydra wires and pulled the end off it you getting the picture you thought it was always like today no when luanne called me on the rotary phone that you couldn't move more than the cord would reach so everybody in the family heard your love affair i miss you on it like crazy took you half an hour the diary number because if it was if it was the one or the three it took a long ways to go around and then and then the one then like the knights it would just sink and they'd go right back by like the ones or the twos or that they were like it's three right it's in a pulse here he said you know our grandparents when i was alive he said we used to attend church in a tent meaning revival for six weeks seven days a week every night i wonder how many would come i should try that you know when i was a kid i remember revival going from friday night saturday night sunday morning sunday night monday night tuesday night wednesday night thursday night friday night saturday night sunday morning sunday night see what we get on sunday morning same god exact same god matter of fact they never had what you had that matter of fact they never even had announce of what you had because all the seals have been opened and the mysteries are made known and you're in such a love affair oh ouch ouch you're so happy to see god ouch they said our parents they used to attend sunday sunday through wednesday night revivals at our church us we used to attend church occasionally on sunday morning our children we used to attend church on sun mother's day and easter and our grandchildren church what's the meaning of that see for all those people that don't think brother dale believes in holiness what you do in moderation your kids are doing access and your grandkids will be unrecognizable be careful be very careful wow when the lamb was chosen then you were chosen with him before the foundation of the world and you are as i said last night the attributes of god's thinking and see that's the only way that's the only way that's completely the only way that you'll have eternal life and a form of eternal life there's the only one form of eternal life and that's god and that's all and he's the one that's eternal wow ain't that amazing see it's not by perchance see that's how god could say i will have a ride and she won't fall like the first bride in the garden there's no chance just not it's not possible it's not even possible see i'm going to close with this is all these all these quotes in scripture you said even when you weren't seeking god you never did see god by the way but even when you weren't even conscious of god if you came from god there was something different right you say how can that be all of job's friends including his wife told him to curse god and die did he curse god no he didn't curse god but do you know god job came right up to telling god he wished he had never been born and if god would have let him been born he wished he would have died in birth pretty close i was reading after i kind of put my message together you know our prophet said that during your whole life when you're serving the devil you thought if you were part of god there's things that you would reach out to do and god wouldn't let you take them you desired them and it was within your grasp but it was not allowed every one of you got stories like that i do i do but let me tell you about the prophets when his wife and his daughter died and he disobeyed god he listened to a woman his mother-in-law and he called the people that the revelation was wrong called them holy rollers you know what the prophet said the way of a transgressor is really really really hard you wanted to know another reason how you know if god won't tell you depart from me i never knew you there's another way it's impossible for some for god to mock god it's not possible you might talk about a person and you might say i don't understand this person i don't understand why they have four dogs and eat eat hot dogs but when you come and attack them their god or their revelation of their god it's not possible to a believer it's not possible and god said himself that if you did that there would be no forgiveness ever amen i'd be really careful i just i just i told i said i just ain't going there that's just one place i ain't going to go the prophet said when his wife died and hope died and that was during the flood and when the water came 22 feet high in the city and his dad had died and his and his brother i believe brother or uncle had died and god was penalizing his disobedience he knew he was now the prophet was a part of god and when he prayed he said it was like a black sheep between him and god you say how's that possible because he was part of god the way of a transgressor is very hard like saul saul tried to kill god's people tried to kill david sought after him with the army threw javelins at him spears plotted against them went to the witch of indar never went to god to prayer meaning never went to prayer i mean he went to uh spiritualism called up samuel and committed suicide and when i i i i find this amazing when he went to the witch indoor and he called up the prophet the prophet said that god has left you saw and that wasn't even enough and god actually hated you now that that's that's far out but she was but he was still a part of god and god saved saul now now that's just that's a paradox but here's our very own prophet in our time and under the burden of losing his wife and his little sharon rose hope satan came and he said you mean to tell me that you came home from work you were saving pennies and you would go preach all night and you'd go this and you'd go to the hospital and pray for sick and you'd come on prayer meeting and pray and there was nobody there or two or three people and then now you're going through this big trial and you pray to god and he just shuts the door in your face he said this is still satan talking and he said you mean to tell me that you want to serve that kind of a person and that's your god i don't understand you brother brad and the prophet said he said you know satan that's just about how it is you know i beginning to think and he said all of us i did something hit me and he said but if you slay me i'll still serve you impossible for him to curse god he was preparing to but not able and that's how all of our lives have been so if you see somebody that goes around and they're just blasting the holy spirit wherever it would be check your math answer in the word of god because it's not possible it's not possible it's not possible you know you know that man it's it's not possible you know one second and we're gonna close wow here it is position of the believer in christ he said oh you say o brother branham i tell you i did this and i did that and yet i i know that i've got it because i know that i'm part of god because i prayed for the sick and they get healed it gets better than that he said i know that i've got it i i just that's just amazing our prophet he said god revealed his word to me like this and like that or the other and i have the knowledge of the written word and our prophet said you're wrong i healed the sick and i spoke in tongues and i do these things and i even cast out devils and jesus said many will come in my name with that same story lord i have cast out devils of thy name prophesied in my name and in thy name have i not done many works and then i will confess to them depart from me you worker of the devil iniquity i do not know you intimacy relationship family that kind of change is the picture doesn't it brother oh you say but brother branham i know a man that can and oh he does this listen to his answer to that don't never look at a man by what he can do in the signs of works that's where he's nothing he might heal the sick and he might have many gifts of prophecy and he might even understand all the knowledge don't you never look to that but you thought that was god's vindication of a called man of god if you're part of the word it's not possible to leave the word regardless of what people say less then oh thank you lord so glad i'm yours lord wow well before you were even you he before you knew you were you
