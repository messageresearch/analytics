love you and thank you musicians amen just it's more than we could even imagine Our God Amen man we just want to continue on the same thought that we've been uh ministering on man I pray that I ain't putting too many people to sleep on this thought but I believe that I believe that God is uh doing things amen doing things for all of us amen and and uh so we want to understand the mystery of God's sovereignty in election man let's turn to Isaiah 55 8-1 amen and I I I apologize again I I'm not a serious type of preacher but I'm sure I will not get done today and and uh but we just uh we cover your prayers so just kind of felt off this morning when we woke up in the flesh and and would have loved the opportunity to call up one of your brothers and and handed the sword to one of you amen Isaiah 558 to1 for my thoughts are not your thoughts that says a lot neither are my ways your ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and as for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and bringeth maketh it to bring forth and Bud that it may be give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which God pleases not what brother Dale pleases and it shall prosper in the thing whever where to I send it let's turn over to James amen I read this scripture um last Sunday James and I and I believe we read James 4 10-12 James 4 amen I really don't think God made suit coats for brother Dale they're humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up speak not not evil one of another brethren for he that speaketh evil of his brother and judges his brother speaketh evil of God the law and judges the law but if thou judgest the law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a judge ouch there is one lawgiver just one I love that Hallelujah who is able to save brother Dale and to destroy brother Dale who art thou that judges another Lord Jesus help us to understand your plan and help help me Jesus that I'd be able to to convey your thoughts to what we feasted on Lord Jesus for months Lord God and and Lord bring us into the statue of the perfect man Lord Jesus and may all our thoughts and all our ideas and all our Creeds that are not of you Lord Jesus fall aside we give you complete control Lord Jesus bless these amazing people Lord God unbelievable that so many would come and drive so far except that they're coming to hear from from you Lord God we clearly understand Lord God we just pray that you'll be the minister the Unseen guests here in our midst Lord Jesus and we give you the glory and the honor for it in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats and we just love and appreciate everyone and you're just uh amazing to be a part of the family of God you know I just want to bring to your memory and I forgot to mention it Wednesday you know uh I I totally had it in part of my thoughts for Wednesday but uh Wednesday was the 61st anniversary of of Christ coming down in sunset Mountain 61 years since the cloud came down and it's never been the same on Earth he came himself and he has unveiled himself to his wife like never before in the history of the world and and and I just praise God for to live in in this day when God's doing an amazing Ministry God is doing amazing things and you know as we Minister these uh messages and and we're going to go to David and and different ones and David's a huge topic and Moses is a huge topic but we want to understand something this morning Satan is a liar and if you do nothing for God he'll tell you you're not worthy and if you do anything for God he'll tell you you're doing too much amen so we need to just line Satan up in the mirror someday and kick him in the knee like Satan amen because it don't matter how your life lives if you're really dedicated to God he will accuse you and if you're not dedicated to God he will also accuse you amen let's just set that really clear so we don't have to be depressed or run down or or saddened by I didn't do enough or I did too much because God placed in your heart exactly the amount that was supposed to be done hallelujah so there you go Satan I'm right where God wants me I've witness to exactly the people God wanted me to witness to I have not talked to the people that God did not want me talked to you know they never understood Jesus when he went to the pool he only healed one person and they're like oh this God is love what's that what kind of that's like that's like partiality that's God see God is God and we have just brother Dale just has a hard time understanding God because he's just not brother Dale amen so anytime say you know you know when the cloud came down the Believers told Brother Brown they they you know science couldn't understand it the Press couldn't understand it the government couldn't understand it Hallelujah sound familiar and they said you know brother Brown we understand it we know the truth so let's go and tell the government the truth brother brandham considered that and the Holy Spirit told him he said don't throw your pearls before the swine it isn't for for you those are for them it's for you so anytime Satan I just want you to know that anytime Satan says oh you should have talked you know oh we should have you're doing exactly what God wanted you to do because the footsteps of God's predestinated bride righteous are walking just exactly where God wants you to step and you're not out a kilter one bit you're not supposed to have done more or have done less or anything else that Satan is a li here amen hallelujah because in all of our faults God's will is being done that's amazing that should just make you go woohoooo amen that's tremendous now that ain't to take this that you know the the critics will say well you know you're you're making Grace a disgrace and this is hypocritical I don't believe that for the bride for the wife I don't believe that for a dedicated believer oh there will be those Hypocrites around but just let God deal with those Hypocrites God knows your heart God knows your desire you God knows that if if you want he wanted you to do something you'd do it he knows that man we want to look in David here and and I I please forgive me for for our time here because David is a huge one and Moses is the next big one but I'm trying to show you that you're in God's will if you know they ask brother brandom this is just the the the climax of our our whole series as they asked brother Brandman questions and answers in 64 they said who will be there and he said those whose names was in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world period period it don't matter if you're a good boy or a good girl I know you don't like that and I don't like it either because I want to think that I had something to do with helping God out I know I know that just say ouch all at the same time ouch oh but es saw Jacob before they were even born God hated one and loved the other they didn't have a lot to do with it before they were born that's a mystery that's a mystery how God could love one and hate because God is omnipotent and he knows the beginning from the end and before those boys had done any witnessing any preaching or any mistakes or any sinning or even were're born to breathe so the next time Satan comes and lies to you and says you should have talked to your neighbor if God wanted you to talk to your neighbor you wouldn't have been able to stop from talking to your neighbor he would have walked you right in you would have had a head-on collision with your neighbor and the first thing you would have said ouch and then you would have started talking we need to have that kind of Faith In Our God because God can bring everything together God will move mountains you know I tell the testimony of my own personal life and this is not edification at all but uh you know one of the first jobs I had in high school when me and the way were courting and uh I needed to go make something right and uh I hadn't done that for many years and God moved mountains that I would buy a farm right next door and shine a line fence with them and mve me right to their doorstep that I could walk in the office and say I have something to make right Satan's a liar uh-huh so just remember Satan's a liar and it's not your brothers and sisters amen so we see here that David in David's life this is a a very long story and and I'm going to try and shoot from the hip and and and just give you some references and and I this is all scripture I I have multiple scriptures here but David had a a half sister and two of her sons were David's right-hand men and they seen joab was one of them in his brother and they seen they were right in David's back pocket as it were to say amen and David was far from an angel but David was God's elect period and they seen all the mistakes that David made and I want to show you how dedicated they were to David now we know when David was running from sa in 1st Samuel 21:12 to15 and I'm not going to read this but David was running he was hiding from the King and when David got to the the foreign King he was afraid for his life and so David pretend to be mad he slobbered at the mouth and acted like he was drunk and out of his mind and had gone mentally incapable now when he did that remember joab was right there watching and he was thinking amen and then we see that David when he became the king he was not the king of all of Israel he was only the king of Judah and Saul's son uh was uh uh ishah and I'm I'm saying that wrong just forgive me but Saul's son take my word for it was the king of the larger part of Israel and that's in 2 Samuel 28 to10 and now that you have to remember Saul and his family minus Jonathan hated David I mean they tried to to kill him multiple times and so the most the majority of Israel followed Saul's son and God really anointed elect only a small portion followed it at the beginning for the first two years and so uh Aaron was one of Saul's uh uh followers one of his military men and he spoke to jaab which was uh David's uh right-hand man and he said let's come together their enemies out remember this they're flat out enemies they kill each other enemies they said let's come together and instead of let's play kroo or chess or something like that they said let's just let the men play around and kill each other sounds like the state of the politics in the world today but so they did that now remember they were they were flat outed enemies and then during this time in the beginning of of David's Kingdom the David's Kingdom became stronger and stronger and stronger and Saul's son's Kingdom became weaker and weaker and weaker and so the battle was very sore that day now you now let's let's just give some sympathy to joab here for a minute he was he was risking his neck for David not for God for David uhhuh So if you R your neck for somebody I mean you stand out in front of some bullets you might expect just a little bit of affection or just a little bit of caring or understanding you know what I'm saying and the botle was sore that day and joab his brother was actually killed one of the younger brothers and and that day uh uh David only lost a few men and Saul's son lost I think it was 320 I'm trying to find oh David lost 20 men and Saul's man king Saul's son lost 360 men that's in 2 Samuel 2 30 and 31 now that battle that was sore and now now JB's own brother has died and and and and his his comrades had died even 60 of them even though it they had succeeded much greater over Saul's son there wasn't a lot of love Exchange changed and there definitely was no forgiveness amen and we see as the kingdom goes on that uh uh am might say help me out honey a a b n e r Abner sorry thank you so sorry you got a pastor but Abner here was falsely accused from Saul's son and and he was accused that he had actually laid with one of Saul's mess and the hatred began to grow inside the kingdom outside of David's Kingdom amen and it began to grow and so Abner was David's enemy bitter enemy Abner had killed and was responsible for killing he would have killed David but he was responsible for killing David's family and his inner courts hello but because that God had broke down the the the Kingdom on the other side of Israel Abner came and seen David and wanted to make Aion with him now see contrary to your own belief this was in the natural and David was actually making mistakes in the flesh David could die amen this was this was not completely and and so we see remember joab is seeing all these mistakes he's seeing who the enemy is he's seeing who's fighting David and then he's seeing the secret parties in the background and he don't understand because he didn't understand election amen and so Abner came and he made a legion with David and he said listen this this son of Saul that I'm following has falsely accused me and and basically Abner's heart is changing and he comes over to David and you know people are being added to David's Kingdom like the like the church is grown in Abner but see watch this joab didn't care if the kingdom grew in his heart remember this is Old Testament it was an eye for an eye uhuh and so joab said I just soon kill you has talk to you praise God we've moved out of that generation amen uh somewhat um man but here Abner comes and he sees David and David forgives him because he he's a man after God's Own Heart and he lets Abner come right in and be close to his kingdom in his heart and David even throws the party for him now that's in 2 Samuel 3 22 and 25 and watch this now David is throwing a party for Abner at the exact same time and day that his soldiers joab is off fighting for David that didn't go down very good joab came back and heard that Abner had been there and David had let him go in peace and joab said that man's a fool and I'm going to go take care of things see how we think in our mind now the light's changed amen and that that where joab came back and heard that Abner was there was 2 Samuel uh 3:22 and 25 so these are these are all scriptures but this is a long long long story of the the reign of of David here but here here so joab unbeknownst to David he sends messenger after amner and he kills him he tries to be his buddy he said why don't we talk and when Abner gets close to him he kills him the same way now he had a hateful it was an eye for an eye because remember when joab's brother got killed by Abner he got killed under the fifth rib and that's exactly how joab killed Abner was under the fifth rib they never had a very good forgetter at that time and so the the country was in uproar but I'm I'm trying to lay a foundation where where David's inner men were seeing mistakes that they considered they were doing that David was doing but even in David's shortcomings he was still God's elect it's just period that's hard for brother Dale to figure out it's hard for most of us to figure out so here Saul's son in in 2 Samuel 4:8 Saul's son is actually killed by his own uh family he's killed beheaded on his bed and so the kingdom and so now in 2 Samuel 5 David takes over his anointed for Kingdom over all of Israel so now it's been a period of duration of a couple years and and uh so now David's Kingdom has grown huge and joab is still David's right-hand man and his brother and now we get to the point where where David the ark David brings the ark back into the the the the into the country you know and you know the I'm just going five 2 Samuel 6 is 13-1 17 and uh and here David is such a man of God you know we're here for another reason and that's worship our worship can never be too loud it can never be out of control there's no church order and Doctrine in worship period David completely lost his mind worshiping God just a type just a type of the holy of holies we have the real Holy Ghost here David completely was ston drunk In the Flesh to the point that his wife Saul's daughter looked out and God forbid that well it's not possible it's not possible that a Believer could look out and watch another believer worship and be ashamed that's not possible it's not possible make believer but not a believer there's no way that you could be ashamed of somebody else worshiping I don't care who gets blessed in this church I'm going to move close to you I'm I just just way it is I want your bucket to spill on me if I don't get the bucket spilled myself I want to get the splash off somebody else's bucket amen that's the way God made us and if you're if you're ashamed of that amen and so we know the story how David come back in the house house and and uh you know his wife said why did you have to dance on covered she was humiliated that he was worshiping God and the kingdom seen them he was supposed to have it together and God was so displeased with her in 2 Samuel 6 20 and 23 that she died of old age and never had children God cursed her now that's one of the other men in the Bible that because of worship I'm not promoting this I I have to be careful with my grandkids because they catch me between services and and uh and they quiz me uh uh the the kids were here working on the church and fixed the Bell yesterday and and I went and bought some of them a lunch and and uh something was said about me eating some of the lunch and one of them said well you said you weren't hungry and I said I lied he said well you've been preaching that's okay I said well not just exactly but out to the most the babes he'll make you check your uh motive so in no way are we promoting sin but ain't it a paradox you know God believed in modesty and he had prophets take their clothes off the Bible says that there will be no Liars in heaven and God had His prophets lie you know you can't challenge God you just have to accept it you can say God I don't understand I'm still going to try to do my best but see there's there's one body bottom rote is and we started with that is the devil's a liar and if you're Gods you're still Gods you know let me interject something here I don't expect you to get the effect that it affected me but this week I got one of my first video calls where you could see the picture of the person that was calling me I've never answered one in my life I know that shows I'm but I hardly knew how to answer it and when I got off the video call I thought that's like God talking to us and you know there was a beautiful little girl on the other side of the video call she was innocent young happy bouncy pure I said there's no no way in the world I can portray my love for that little girl there's no way it's impossible and we got have Jehovah God in heaven and he said I'm up here in heaven there's no way I can portray my love to you when Satan's telling you you're no good you're a loser you made a mistake you dropped the ball there's no way how could God portray his love to you when we got ears listening to Satan saying yo you should have done more you should have did this you should have did that or you did way too much God help us God help us to help God understand that he gave everything he was you came from him he tore himself apart to put himself together and you were the part that he put back together that's some that's more than Amazing Grace that's that's how sweet to sound they saved The Loser Like Me Halle Hallelujah that he literally in the Old Testament he ripped the animals apart and as the animals came back together I was the part that was useless I was the part that was ripped apart but I came back together just like the jogged Covenant and there was nothing nobody could ever do to break that amazing Covenant here here's God he's looking in a video call down to Heaven he said there's my beautiful wife bride oh man I love love her how can you portray and accept that amazing love Hallelujah God help us God help us he gave us everything including himself to help us to understand and I believe God in this series gave us something else he gave us a whole bunch of his Believers elect bride and they didn't make mistakes because God was happy they made mistakes but they made mistakes to show that there's maybe hope for brother Dale there just there's a slim chance that in all the mistakes that everybody else made that if you were his before the foundation of the world there ain't nobody there ain't no Pope or priest or fivefold nothing can take that from you Hallelujah amazing we see here and uh in David's life here David showed kindness to a King uh and I I'm sorry I have to spell some of these words just weren't made for me but h a n u n and he showed kindness to this King and and uh and this King had fought against David and here it was was joab that had do the fighting and see David actually did make mistakes believe it or not you know as part of the elect part of the Bride she will make mistakes amen that don't change one thing it wouldn't matter you know you know brother Brown talked about it when he went to the mission Fielder when you're married to your sweetheart and she is your rib it makes no difference what mistakes my wife make it makes no difference at all absolutely none cuz it can never change that she's my rib it would it would make no difference you can every thought that comes through your mind it wouldn't make no difference and that's how God looks at us amen and here we see a joab is doing the fighting and then we see here that joab is away fighting this King that David had showed kindness to you can see where envy and bitterness would rise up and while joab is away fighting the king that David showed kindness to David sleeps with Bap Sheba johab knew everything about that it was johab that took the letter back for the death of Uriah you see what I'm saying he was right in David's back pocket he seen David make a and he's actually risking his neck at the same time David's laying with people he's not supposed to lay with and those people were risking their neck too and I will never understand on this Earth i' be I'm sure I mean I just can't imagine how I can understand how uah's family could sit under David's Ministry brother Dale couldn't do it in the flesh that's that's an amazing God I I I don't know how to explain that but it was amen and so we see here there's scriptures for all this but in 2 Samuel 11:14 to18 here's David wrote joab and sent the letter back to kill Uriah he he knows everything and and to to tell you how bad it is when when UAH dies joab sends a messenger to David and says it was a mistake he shouldn't have died he just got a little bit too close and the enemy's arrows caught him you know what David's response was come and go a few die a few arrows hit and you rise like is this the guy I'm supposed to be following he's seeing David here here where he shoots uh Uriah is in 2 Samuel 11:24 and 25 and and and he s maybe we'll read this in 24 he says the shooter shot Off the Wall unto thy servants and some of the king's servants are dead and thy servant Uriah of the Hittites is dead also and when David said to the messeng he said Thou shalt say unto joab let let not this thing displease thee oh well big deal Somebody went to hell no big deal and joab's like wow I'm I'm trying to lay it I'm trying to play you a play in your mind that joab could not understand joab could not understand and I'm also going to show you something joab was not wrong he was not wrong when people do stuff like this joab's like wow he said let not this thing displease you for the sword devours one as well as another make thy V battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and he encouraged johab you see joab was faithful to David even in his wrongs that's murder am man here joab fought against uh uh he he this will really show you in 2 Samuel 12:26 and 28 it will show you how dedicated joab was to David because joab could have took the Kingdom from David because he was that much of a hero joab fought against the Rahab the children of the amorites and he took the the Royal City and jaab sent a letter this is verse 27 jaab sent a letter Messengers to David and said I have fought against Rahab and I have taken the city of waters and now there is for now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest lest I take the city and the people call it after me I tell you what I wouldn't mind having joab in in the church I have a whole bunch of them he was Joe joab wasn't do you see what I'm saying the people would have fell down and worship joab for being the hero and he goes behind the scene to his favorite Minister and says listen you come in and make it look like you're the hero whoa now that's loyalty boys and girls that's real loyalty and then we see Absalon stole the heart of David's Kingdom and he planted at the door and so David's own family rose up within him that was that was one of the payments for David's uh sins mistakes was God told him that the sword would never leave your household and joab still fought for for David I'm I'm trying to show you how unbalanced this was but how balanced God was amen and so absolon comes up and and David did here show the heart of of God where even though his David actually fled from his kingdom and uh and uh and when they went to fight against his son David assured the people he saido not kill them now he would have killed David in a heartbeat he would have killed David if he would have stayed there but joab couldn't follow his orders because joab was so dedicated to David even though David said don't kill my son joab said listen I fought for you my whole life and you're still the king and anybody that challenges the king is is going to fall on my sword and so joab kills David's son and David's mourning here and and that and then we see here that David is mourning so much for his son I know this is hard to believe but in this case it was actually his enemy because they God had raised them up to give David for for David's mistakes and his sins and joab comes into the king and this is in second Sam 19:5 and8 and he says if you keep on crying for your enemy you're going to lose the whole Kingdom now there's joab again protecting David he's protect he's he he's not saying I'm going to take the kingdom he's saying it's yours it's yours and here he said th and you know you well just for time we're you know and here David gets some himself together David gets himself composed and goes out and greets the people whose credit was that joab and David's kingdom is restored back to him in 2 Samuel 19-5 and joab saw all these mistakes but God still respected David and joab and his brother God killed when David died he talked to his son Solomon and you can read that I have multiple scriptures here ain't that a paradox I'm trying to encourage you that don't believe the lie of the devil that he says well you know bless God you did this wrong God don't even see it you know what what was justified as if you never the real me never even did that that's how the prophet taught it I I know we we struggle to believe that you see the thing is this gospel that we we know is the truth this this word of God that we know is you never did nothing I don't like that word nothing to come to God nothing at all you never made one good decision to come to God you think oh yeah I did I bless God I oh bless God I picked my parents in the beginning of the earth oh bless God I chose to serve God no you did we don't like that because you know we think well like I I get showered up and put on my robe and bless God no you didn't do nothing you wouldn't even have done that bless God was it was like the kids threading the chain in from the bow we had the whole town watching us as we were up there now we're pulling the old rope out the sun had ate the rope and the sun won't eat the chain now I mean we'll all be in another place before the chain the sun eats and we're fishing it through fishing it through all the conduit through the attic to bring it down here so we can ring the bell to wake the town up we had we had people in the town that you were to walk by go back to their house and come back and walk by and stay in the street and talk to us wait wait to talk to us uhhuh live me a sermon man they're watching I had people thank me up town I actually had one of the tillers at the bank thank me for fixing the old church that she used to go to not letting it fall down so God has all different uhuh he's going to have his wife in the Kingdom but then we're going to have people cooking the food to bring it to us they're called servants you won't have to run the vacuum in heaven the Jews will be doing that 144,000 amen right and then you got all those people in heaven that were good to the bride like they'll be there too maybe they'll be uh I don't know picking the honey in case I get stung by the bees because I don't want to get stung they'll just bring me the honey minus the Beast well it's going to be a kingdom go God's not no foolish person he's got people operating it it ain't going to be his wife doing it she's the queen Hallelujah ain't it amazing and David's Kingdom see and God gave the testimony for David that he was a man after his own heart and if you were joab you'd say well maybe you should talk to me amen see how God is God you go you can't take away God's elect it was God that chose amen it was God that's omnipotent not us let's move forward to Acts n and and we'll look at Saul Paul here and Paul's going around persecuting the Christians now and and and we'll see here in in Acts 15 acts 9:15 sorry acts 9:15 here that God said that saw this murderer that would go to the government and get permission to murder the Believers flat out like that's extreme he said he's My Chosen vessel don't sound like much chosen to me I'd be hiding from God's chosen to stay alive and that's exactly like the Apostle did the who was it that God sent to go see Saul honey the a an a an i as ananas who would pick a word like that nobody could read ananas here God sends a to go to ananas he goes in his thoughts and he says I want you to go by and see saw and Annas he's a Believer but he wasn't sure God was right he said well God we maybe should talk like because you got a bad memory maybe I'll remind you sounds like me God did you forget that this person you want me to go see Cuts people's heads off are you sure and God's like it's no problem I chose him he said chose him there's no way I'm sitting in that church amen you know how that story goes look at the prophet who God told to marry the Harlot now those were Old Testament prophets now what are you going to now they're living in the Old Testament what was that prophet's name honey H oos EA Hosea now he's living the Old Testament law so what are you going to do with the law where a prophetess Mary a virgin God just broke his own law but God can't break his own law but uhhuh he tells them to go marry a wh and they have three kids two sons and a daughter and God tells them the name of every one of those kids there's no other way to explain that than it's an omnipotent God in election in an election you know let's just look at Moses for a minute here now we see Moses was living in a terrible country a persecution it'd be like being a Believer and being in North Korea or something like that I couldn't imagine couldn't imagine if you think you're hard done by just watch some video online under Kim Jones rule it's unbelievable those PE people are treated worse than our cats just they're treated worse than our rats unbelievable that just makes me lose sleep at night God have mercy on them the only thing that'll save them is a Rapture I mean those people are that's just wrong God made men and man made slaves that's disgusting and I mean there's lots of examples of that around the world even in our own country we with the Windsor border have probably the biggest sex tra in North America that's disgusting that's just that's just that's just hell coming up and brother Dale and us and we have to go up too we have to keep going up because hell's coming up and God's going to raise up a standard and that's going to be the Rapture he's going to take us home CU we can't live here no longer it's just not safe but Moses was living in a kind of world like that and the King come out and said now we're going to kill all the baby boys under two now that was Al now I would be considering getting a Visa in another country that wasn't an option so what do you do if you're the elect in God's plan Satan can never break God's plan Moses should have never have lived there was actually by human sight Moses could have never have lived amen here here his mother he got so baked that his mother couldn't hide him well first off in Exodus 2:1 Moses Moses was born and he was a goodly child and and they hit him in verse three and they pitched him in an arc which I mean I I know we read it and and we know the end of the story so we say oh well that was a great idea no that was the most stupidest idea you ever did hear or tell of there was crocodiles in that River like there's not a lot of difference between getting eaten by a crocodile and getting a spear in your chest but God see that it's just God just changes everything and so here a mother just does her heart and you know what did God tell her nope it's never recorded that God told her anything see now there let's go back to that liar the Devil he's telling you oh you should have did that oh you should have did did that says who you don't want to talk to that liar the devil you're doing exactly without in your whole you don't even realize you're doing God's will and you woke up amen you think oh I made a decision no that was God's decision amen you see what I'm saying Moses mom made decisions that God never told her to make and it was just out of the love of her heart and she's putting this thing together and God's just like moving the chest Pond and I was like oh I had a lot to do I won the oh Hallelujah she makes an ark and pitches it and puts the Ark in the in with the crocodiles and she thinks oh this is going to be great no she didn't think this was going to be great she was ripping her heart right out of her chest to let go of that Arc and with crocodiles that baby would need breastfed within an hour or two at the most I mean it was that was in watch church that was insanity but that was God you know what there'll be things that God tells you to do y and it will seem like insanity probably the devil told you that when when you woke up to drive here this morning especially your brothers and sisters that drove an hour and a half 2 hours like the devil's like are you out of your mind do you know the price of gas I mean do you know that they have internet do you know do you know there's a church that you would buy probably 100 churches to drive Insanity insan complete Insanity you don't think those people had the same battle back then oh yeah oh oh yeah and here Moses mother out of compassion sent the daughter along to watch how it would go and it didn't go well at all cuz the baby started crying oh you thought I was going to say it went well no no no can you imagine the mother's heart when she heard Moses crying down the river oh it what what that was saying is crocodiles I'm over here I'm lunch I'm just the appetizer that mother's heart was just like a semi truck in her chest Moses shut up Moses shut up it's like some of the mothers when they they're in church and the baby Christ they said shut up the preach everybody's going to look at me everybody's looking at me I wish You' shut up but there's no crocodiles in church and God touched A murderer's daughter's heart amen see if he did it then he's the same God today we don't have to fear none of this politics stuff or anything and and I tell you what you know we have thoughts about all our life and you know where we're going to live in the pretty house and the you know the apple trees that never produced apples with worms in it and all this stuff that'll be in the Millennium but it's never what you think and the CIA is behind everything it don't matter who wins the election in November the CIA has murdered more people than Hitler did a 100 times over do you want to think so I can show you 100 videos to prove that and it didn't matter if if it was Republican or Democrat the CIA are murderers I'm not afraid to say that if they come take my neck you'll know where I'm at I'm in glory I'm not in the CIA s amen and here God took a murderer's daughter and he fell in love with this little baby that's not smiling oh you thought he was smil he looks so cute no he's wailing he's wailing and she made have fall in love and of course you know the story how the daughter went up and said hey you know back then they never had grocery stores with formula that we know of and he said would you like me to get a mother nurse mother for him and and of course that's what they needed and she went and in the trial of murder and losing her family she got paid to raise her own kid now that's better than being a real flat out mother I mean and not only did she get paid to raise the baby but she got to take the baby [Laughter] home and you thought you had troubles here's the murderer's daughter said I need a nursemate she get some Mother's mom said you can take the baby and I'll pay you wages she and by the way I'm going to say that again and she said and you can take take the baby and I will pay you wages to take care of your own son now that that's the that's almost as good as a baby bonus amen see how God in election why thousands of millions of babies were dying how many male babies under 2 years old would would be born in a group of people that were 2 million 100,000 200,000 in two years all dead but election all dead but election what did she do to have that election nothing absolutely nothing and then we look at Moses in his later years and and and I want to show you something else in in we're doing you are amazing to preach to I just God bless you but I want to show you something this is I just want to show you something in the scriptures and you can make up your own decision but it's recorded multiple times in the Bible and you can decide for yourself but don't tell me but I'm going to show you what God put in the word in numbers 121 to5 and don't ask me to read all that but in 1 to 15 here God tells Moses to marry an Ethiopian woman and Ethiopian women are black Jewish people are not black and Moses sister and brother mocked Moses for doing that and this this is all in numbers 121 to15 and you know the story better than I know the story but God came to Moses sister and he said now do you realize that Moses is elect that's why there's scriptures in the Bible where you touch not my anointed he said here's God coming and he's saying to Moses sister he says do you realize that I talk to Moses lip to ear and you said uhhuh what and God cursed Moses sister with Leprosy which is a type of Eternal separation in the Bible because she mocked what God told his servant to do amen now and do you know who had to pray that God would lift the curse off of his sister the very person that got mocked Moses and Moses prayed that God would lift the curse off his sister and they never moved the camp until her leprosy even even God what maybe we got a we got some time we got to read this here and I when well I you can find this in the scripture but I'll tell you from memory when David when when when Moses went to God and said now God you know my sister didn't know what she was doing and she laughed at your decision for me to marry aath the open woman you know what God Said whoa whoa whoa wait a minute Moses I might answer your prayer but she deserves a spanking anyway well that's what he says in the scriptures you can read it I'm not making this up he says even though you want me to lift the curse she deserves that leprosy for like a week CU I'm going to teach her a lesson bless God and then I'll answer your prayer that's a god of Mercy but his Mercy was short when it came against his amen that's one place I don't want to be guilty of going just I'm not going to go there I'm not going to throw any apples that God's elect because I don't want leprosy amen and just along that line I want to show you something that's in the scripture and I'm not preaching Doctrine you can make your own conclusion I'm just saying it's in the Bible so Moses married an Ethiopian woman an Ethiopian are black people Moses was like myself Abraham's concubine Hagar was a black woman and when Sarah died Abraham's first wife he married his second wife which was I can't say her name but it started with the K thank you and she was also a black woman Ruth was a moabit which is half Jew and half Gentile which is half black and she married Boaz and that's why it's recorded in the Bible that David was Ro Ry that's actually the color of his skin that's not little on statue so anybody that thinks that God cares about the color of your skin needs to read the Bible because that's five examples and God actually come through those lineages now I have stacks of notes and I spent whole days searching this out and Googling it I have pictures on my phone to prove what these nationalities look like matter of fact even you know even Joshua when he sent the spies to Rahab in the wall in Jericho do you know that he sent Half Breed people in to the spies so they would blend and not stand out in Jericho because the people were a different color amen God help us God help us let's move down faster and and we're doing better than I dreamed amen Judah and Tamar now Judah was a descendant of Jacob now Jacob is a patriarch I mean it was the 12 apostles amen and judah's wife died and Tamar was a little girl that had married judah's son and he was the Bible says a very Wicked Man I I don't understand that either how does the lineage from Jacob go to to uh to to Judah and and his sons be extremely Wicked people I I don't understand how that does but that's what the Bible says and so he was a very Wicked Man and God took his life but the people in the church didn't understand why God did that like Judah and so he gave him his next son because that was the law that the son would raise up seed for the first son son and that son refused to raise up seed for his older son and so he did an evil thing in the sight of God and God killed him too now I'm paraphrasing for all you adults but if you want to know in private we can spell it out and Judah is now God's elect but the communications in his internet it was a rainy day and it was just off a little bit when he was talking to God and he he said now that little girl hey let me throw this in here this is a free one time out this is free one you know we were out a feed Thing Up by kenel sometime and there was a person from I don't know the other side of the world and she was telling you how to do your will inheritance and she did Big inheritance farms and the problem is with Farmers that get really wealthy they don't know how to pass it on to their kids and normally the kids actually get married and the parents are prejudiced to their son and they don't want the the daughter-in-law to get all this money and blah blah blah blah and this lady said something that I never forgotten she said you know when we te talk to these rich Old Farmers that are about ready to die and they're afraid to pass it on to their family they say well that daughter-in-law of mine bless God she's only in it for the money he said you know what I tell them he said you fat old farmer he said ' did you ever think your second girlfriend was go in for the money he said she's in for the money more than your daughter-in-law is your daughter-in-law is having your son's kids but your girlfriend's just getting a free ride on the gold dream I don't think she won a lot of votes from the fat old Farmers but you see what I mean so here Judah said now that Tamar she's my daughter-in-law but she's a witch bless God she's a witch she's Put a Spell on my two son-in-laws I'm going to keep my distance from her I'm going to use the sword of the spirit and I'm going to keep my third son because I want to have some kind of Heritage to hold on the Lang St name I'm just paraphrasing amen this is in Genesis 38 6- 26 now if we read all these scriptures we'd be here a month from now and I'm trying to finish this topic because there is other things in the Bible to preach and so Judah wouldn't give the next daughter son to Tamar because she had a spell on her and she had nothing to do with the son's dying the Bible says that and so the son was ready to come to Tamar but he was not given so Tamar dressed like a and stood on the road where those kind of people stand and she had heard that her father-in-law was going to go to town this is unbelievable I talked to lean for days on this one and judah's going to town and he sees some horse and he says what Bible's that in that's got to be the new a international version that is no way the Bible I'm reading oh what kind of a world does Judah have the right to go to town and look at prostitutes and have those kind of thoughts it's in here and I need some therapy and so judah's wife had died so you could say that you know he was a widow and that's only if he didn't have multiple wives that weren't mentioned because that was a common thing then but at the very best case scenario this was either adultery or fornication and the Bible clearly says that both are kind of frowned upon but they were the elect of God yeah that's what I said that's what I said Damar premeditated fornication or no sorry she pray maned did adultery it would have been adultery for her because her two husbands had died and Judah flirted with the idea of adultery if he didn't have any other wives or fornication if he did and Tamar played a trick on him and you know he took his bracelet and his thing and and uh now I want to show you you something this is Spirits don't die thank you very much when Juda found out that Tamar his sister-in-law was pregnant this really good Holy Roller elect of God said I'll kill her because she was supposed to take my third son and raise up seed to My First Son Heir bless God I got a $90 tie on maybe see that spirit's still alive and it was him that had did it do you see that Judah chose murdering because he was covering up his own thank you very much you know our Prophet talked about that he saidou know if you have somebody in the church that really struggles with something chances are if you go over to their house and open the closet they'll have a skeleton standing there so to to draw attention away from his sin said we'll kill her bless God we don't put up with that kind of foolishness in the church we'll just set this thing straight for good oh bless God that hurt tear just came out and said well whoever's man owns this you know and if you went back I I I got so excited under the anointing I say you know Judah actually want sent his servants to pay this prostitute and she was there because she wasn't a prostitute generally speaking and she hid and Judah was upset that he couldn't pay for his services and he said well I guess if she don't want the money bless God I'm free to go but see how that religious spirit rised up in election and would have chose murder when they were the one wearing the Hat ouch I think we read a scripture something like that what right do we have to judge if you live in a glass house you better not throw stones that means if you're breathing a amen praise God Amen because there's just one person that has the right to judge and he can choose Grace or destruction aren't you glad it ain't brother Dale's Choice it took me years to figure that out Hallelujah I'll trust him every time I'll Trust his amazing amazing judgment in the situation that's just beyond my comprehension Hallelujah because he's a sovereign God and he's omnipotent and he knows the beginning from the end and he's also just amen you know the story and here Judah says the Tamar is more holy than me now I thought they're both were lacking a little bit on the holy part but I want to reint blate this and I did the three messages ago Jesus chose to come through this fornication along with the uh whor from the wall of Jericho Rahab see see that's God so the next time the devil tells you that you're not good enough you said devil you haven't read the Bible in a while you need to read these people that are in heaven right now and read their life story because they're already in glory so like they're we're we're like in good camp uhhuh aren't you glad I'm glad I'm not saved by my works oh hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus I mean I love doing works for God I love them but I'm sure glad I ain't saved by my first works I would have already been heated up amen let's go faster Abraham in Genesis 20 uh 1 verse 1 to verse 7 Abraham leaves because of prosperity is looking for money looking for an easier life he's running away from a famine and he lies about his wife says she's my sister and I I want to show you this this is in Genesis 20 1-7 and I'm only doing this to to be fast I mean I could preach whole messages on any one of these people but I want to show you something that is just stumbles me almost it don't almost I said here Abraham flat out Li to a king with a pure heart and the god woke the king up and said you're as good as a dad man you have have somebody else's wife and the King had to remind God that what Abraham had told him and this I will never understand and I'm not I'm just saying this is a sovereign God and and I don't think there's a lot of counts of this but here Abraham is a liar and God told the king if you don't go and get that liar of a Preacher to pray for you you're a dead man I don't understand that he told Abraham he so told the king he saidif you don't go and and he said can't God I never did nothing wrong I'm only taking her sister and God you're going to kill somebody with a pure heart God said you're a dead manless you don't go get that liar to pray for you that's election That's The Power of election you know we we said this when we preached the beginning see our message in the message must be different than the denominational churches thank you sisters buddy amen s brothers right we're not a denomination but see we have a different message now I'm not I'm not God knows this you know this I'm not pushing this to the point of disgrace but these are facts these are facts and so we're not we're not pushing this God that you know I'm doing all the decisions and God's just allowing me to be a good boy because that's what the Baptists are preaching uhuh if we get enough programs to bring in Ben NORAD enough times and and that we'll have enough alter calls and and that'll help no I mean that that's we believe in those things but you see what it mean it's election remember what I told you about you it's hard for you to imagine because you've heard it so long but there's people that have never ever ever seen one scripture on Election that's heard to believe you know when I studied this I could preach a whole message just read in scriptures on Election on election and predestination the Bible is full from Genesis the revelations on you came from him Greatful of it what else do they preach amen that's why God don't know them because they never came from him they're not a part of him amen now now Abraham taught his son very well Isaac and Isaac did almost exactly the same thing as his daddy did that should teach you daddies to raise up your children in the right way because Isaac lied and said his wife was his sister also so Daddy was a very good teacher and then we see the prophet Ezekiel here God had him lie on his side in the house of Israel for multiple days this is in Ezekiel 4 4-6 and we're just going through these people here in the word of God amazing things that God did in the Bible that was out of the step of what we picture Our God you know what that is amazing grace it's nothing but Amazing Grace because see this second Eve could not it wasn't possible that's hard for brother Dale to understand the second Eve no matter what she did before she was even born could not fall for the scriptures to be fulfilled amen now we're not promoting our mistakes but what we're trying to show is if you see your brother in a mistake just leave it alone if you want want to pray privately but for goodness sake don't go talk to him don't dare go do that just pray because God knows exactly what he's doing and maybe that brother is making a mistake to pressure your character in forgiving him in his mistake that God's raising him up and it might take him too many years for that to happen uhhuh and we're looking at it in a self-righteous way like joab and said well we'll kill Tamar we'll just kill him and then we killed God because they were God Amen God help us God help us to recognize now you know in the first few messages we read many of these scriptures amen and I want to read a scripture here and we're going to come to a close here Matthew 22:14 uh here it says for many are called but few are chosen that's just a very short verse but I'm going to read a a quote here of our Prophet if you'll forgive me he says he talks about he was and I mentioned this many weeks ago on on a Wednesday night and it was all based on this scripture but a man took a out in the in the country and and there was multiple animals in the pasture and so here he says there was mules there there was camels there there was goats there there was many other animals all in the pasture and and the man said you know but there was a Shepherd there and he had sheep there and brother baham says this many different times he says this in The Shepherd of the Sheepfold and he says it in the Supernatural God in 59 and the guy was telling him he said well you know how's the guy control all the animals and he said well he only controls the sheep and he even goes go further than that he says well actually he only controls the sheep that know the shepherd's voice and so brother brandom of course got very excited listening to this and this is in a couple paragraphs and I'm just prayer phrasing it but he says so only the sheep that recognize the voice of the shepherd go into the F that night to be protected from the wild of the world and so the mules and the camels and the goats and the cattle and the sheep that don't know the voice all stay out but they're all chewing on the same grass in the green pasture amen see if we let God take care of the elect he's got it all under control and anytime there's an issue amen is when we try to get in there and assist God in doing something that God don't even want done amen amen and don't ever let Satan say you know I should have done this I you know even in your mistakes God gets Glory a prophet said you know there's nothing that Satan does to hinder God Kingdom nothing but I've made mistake I made flat out sins but God just turns that around oh wow isn't he amazing but like if you believe he God did that for you which we know he did don't you believe you could do that for your brother or your sister that you just flat out don't understand there's situations in the flesh that you would look at and you say God how in the world are you going to fix that and because he's God if he could answer you back on the video call you just say don't worry little child I've already fixed it I've already fixed but you can't see it you can't see it and so because of that we allow Satan to beat up on us or we beat up on each other and then Satan can take a coffee break when neither should be happening you might you know what you could be the most holy pure perfect virtuous angel that was never born and if you're not in God's predestination plan you ain't going to be there you ain't going to be there but God you know I I preached and I cast out devils and I did this and I healed the sick and I did this and I gave the money to the poor and I and I and I and I went trips and I and I there's one comment and I and and I and and and I healed and I gave to the poor and and I pre and God's up there oh Father forgive him he don't even know that he's saying I amen God help us I love the end of that verse in Matthew that we read only one is able to judge to save or to kill only one I'm glad it's him I'm glad it's him I'm glad I'm so glad it's him you know I want to just use my last example and I'm going to close with this you know the story in John 83-11 I give you the scripture so you know I truly did study these out and read these but here is an elect lady caught in the very Act of adultery and she's brought to Jesus by The Church Believers of the day and they said we we've been preaching on this for three weeks now said now Jesus your Bible says as if God didn't already know what his Bible say they thought their college Cemetery education was going to help out God's omnipotent mind your Bible says that she's to be stoned and whoever was caught with her and the Bible says that Jesus never answered them and he stooped down and he wrote something on the sand and then he ra stopped and he said to the people that were there he said any of you that are without sin you can start throwing the first stones and then he knelt down and he kept I'd like to know what all was wrote on that s and he started writing on the S I'm going somewhere with this and when he rose up all the re this was the Pharisees so they were Church going people all the religious Christians that had a nice suit on were gone our Prophet said it was probably them that had laid with her at other times but they weren't caught in the act that's what brother brah said but Jesus said to her where is your accusers and she said I have none I want to show you something I want to close on this thing not one time in my studies and not one place in the Bible not one single place did it say that this woman ask for forgiveness it don't even say she had a repentant heart that was probably her business for making groceries and Jesus said neither do I condemn you see what I'm trying to show you is Believers if you're elected you don't even have to ask now God wants the Bible says you have not because you ask not but this is an example where somebody was set free and they never even ask you see if you were tore from God we our next message I'm going to preach on that if
