And Lord, many are here because of just simply unsafe to move, Lord God. And Lord, I pray that you'll bless them in a special way, Lord God. that's no no fault or responsibility of their own. Lord God, I pray that maybe through technology or the video, they would get a a glimpse of your love. And Lord, we we they are part of your body, Lord God. They're no less because they're not here. It's just not safe this morning. And Lord, we thank you for your love and goodness. In your name, we pray. Lord, we pray that you'd take control of the service, Lord, and we're going to have a little probably change of plans and and Lord, but but you're the boss this morning. You're the boss every morning. &gt;&gt; We thank you for it. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. It's just good to be in his house. For all those that are online, it was a lot worse in Wyoming than it was in the southern side of Brigden and and Wallisburg, I'm sure. And and Chadam, for sure, it's probably grown flowers already, Chadam. And uh but when we came to the far north where brother Jeff and Sister Dler was, uh the wrath of the rain was much stronger. Man, for all those that are online, we understand you made the right decision. Uh, and we're not sure what we should have done. Amen. Amen. You can maybe be seated for a moment. And uh, so just we were we were very unorganized. Uh, uh, maybe I'll keep you for a second, honey. Um, we we thought we would do communion today. We planned for communion, but I did mention that if the weather was bad, I don't want to do communion in footw Washington, many of our brothers and sisters are not here just because they because of the weather. They they need to be a part of what they want to be and that. So after I read a poem, we're going to open it up that I know many of you said specials andor testimonies and we can do any of the specials and any of the testimonies. Um just recognizing that they're going to be online today. Um next Sunday when we do communion, the service will not be posted. Uh communion is not a service to post. Footw wishing is not a service. Not uh you know uh we're not running a popularity contest where we try to uh you know brother Abraham Myra is somebody I respect greatly and uh Uganda and he was talking about in his church he said when the power of God comes down my cameraman know &gt;&gt; to leave the camera. When the power of God comes down, my piano player knows &gt;&gt; that she has to leave the piano. &gt;&gt; There's no position in church that is above God. &gt;&gt; And when you need to pray and when you need to rejoice, &gt;&gt; you leave your position. &gt;&gt; You leave your pew. You leave what? You know, see what I'm saying? like God is the boss and God is right all the time and and and so you know he was saying he said you know if if God was moving and there happened to be an altar call or service of that the cameraman's greatest uh attraction not in our case our cameras fixed on the wall is to zoom in on the people fixing their eternal life that's not God's will not for Not for not for this place anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh when when somebody is blessed under the when somebody is drunk under the anointing &gt;&gt; or they're seeking God, &gt;&gt; that's not video material. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not intentionally video material. I mean, if somebody gets blessed and runs around the aisle and they catch the back of their head or something, that's fine. It don't But you know what I mean? None of this zooming in stuff. That's &gt;&gt; we're not concerned about ratings. &gt;&gt; We're concerned about them actually communing with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we we're not we have all day cuz it's supposed I mean well some of us do. I have all day. Some of us maybe got appointments. But uh if you have a special or a testimony and you're okay with it being online, you're not interrupting the service. We we will minister the word of God um accordingly afterwards. But I want to read a poem while you're thinking on those uh new things and and we we do want to greet the many many that are online and and all of you that come here and have come here and call this their home church. You you have no idea what you mean to me in the land. You &gt;&gt; Amen. And of course you it's impossible for you to know what you mean to God. That's the most important. You will not comprehend that until you get to the other side. You can try with all your might and that'll be really good, but when you get over there, you'll have different things. I &gt;&gt; I believe God brings things in our life for a reason and different things pop up and there's good and bad to many things in the world but uh this was something that good that happened. This is somebody I know that showed a great deal of kindness to us in Uganda. But he never ever sat in a church service. &gt;&gt; He posted this and if we did this our life would be completely different. when uh instead of viewing others as bad, wrong or evil, simply view them as limited. Their level of consciousness limits them to the unparable behaviors and they simply cannot do better consciously considering their correct current level of understanding and awareness. They are not bad. They are simply limited. This small shift in perspective, this huge shift in our perspective allows you greater peace, greater compassion, greater forgiveness, and greater grace. Remember, the higher you move in consciousness, the less fault you find in others. &gt;&gt; Amen. This guy was the first person to show up at our accident in Uganda when we had our head-on collision. He gave us vehicle &gt;&gt; and a driver, paid driver to took us everywhere after it, but he never came to church. Every time I've went to Uganda, he's given me a five-star meal, but he never ever came to church. &gt;&gt; Maybe I read that again because my English is poor. My reading is far worse. Instead of viewing others as bad, wrong, or evil, simply view them as limited. Their level of consciousness limits them to unparable behaviors and they simply cannot do better considering their current level of understanding and awareness. They are not bad. They are simply limited. This small shift in perspective allows us that that huge shift in perspective allows us greater peace, greater compassion, forgiveness, and grace. Wow. Wow. That would change everything in our lives if I could just live that. Amen. Amen. That's powerful. &gt;&gt; That comes from where the donkeys are swinging in the tea factory in Uganda. &gt;&gt; They don't have frozen rain there this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Does anybody want to share a testimony or a or a special or um later on? We can wait on Sister Dama if you want or just Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Sister Damla's Oh, yep. Esther. Okay. Yep. Good. Beautiful Vaness. Make sure and catch them. Vicki, please. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Bless him Jesus. down when the wounds go deeper than worse. And you can't know what you're going through. One thing I found that I really want you to know its matters to the master. He wants to share the burdens you whisper when it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus. Do you think the maker and g of life is far too busy to care about your trles and hear that falls to the ground and hears that soundious Amen. matters to you. It matters to the masterdensis worldy pain or you're really an answer. If it matters to you, it matters to the master. If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really matters to you, it doesn't only matter to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. This house I'm putting in is the windows and the shutters are in the cold. I see myself and I can take and I see it on my It seems that all the so and very soon my Oh, sorry.

Oh my and soon I leave my tr behind I will be leaving it all behind. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Those were both beautiful songs. Thought the first one was really beautiful. I knew the last one was. Amen. Amen. So, anybody else that wants to testify or sing a special is more than welcome to. We're going to do the same thing next Sunday, but have communion, but it just won't be online. But for all that, Yeah. Sister DM's coming. Amen. You stand beside over here. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Um, as we're closing in on the year of 2025, one thing that's been consistent is our solid rock, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. And through the many things um that we've experienced this year, he's shown us faithfulness &gt;&gt; in so many beautiful ways, in so many rich ways. and I could stand here all day testifying of his goodness. &gt;&gt; I will share some testimonies today. Um but first the boys and I are going to sing a song and then we have a scripture song. So &gt;&gt; we're going to sing He's able because he sure is able to carry us through no matter what this life has for us and what he has in store for us. and we want to just testify of his goodness. &gt;&gt; And so we're going to sing that together. Okay, Moses, you ready? You're not touching that. We're going to be singing in two. Ready? Three, two, one, go. He's able. He's able. He's more than able. He's able to carry me through. He's able. He's able. He's more than able. He's able to carry me through. &gt;&gt; He heals the broken hearted and he sets the captives free. He makes the lame to walk again and causes the blind to see. He's able. He's able. He's more than able. He's able to carry me through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's able. He's able. He's more than able. He's able to carry me through. &gt;&gt; Okay. The word of the Lord endureth forever. First Peter 1 25. The word of the Lord endureth forever. First Pet was reflecting on the many testimonies of the Lord this past year, There's kind of three things that came to mind. So the first thing was divine provision. The next was divine appointments and the next was divine dreams. So I'm going to start by sharing a few testimonies of divine provision. And they may seem small, but the fact that the Lord knows our heart before you even speak a word &gt;&gt; is so beautiful to me. &gt;&gt; Um, this past summer, I was looking for a bicycle for Moses, and I had it on my heart to also get a bicycle for myself, but I didn't pray for it. I didn't want I wasn't actively looking for it. It was kind of just in my heart that I would love to bike with my boys. It's something I enjoy doing. I know it's something they enjoy doing. So, it would be quite special for us to do that together. And so, the one day Jeff and I were on the road um towards Wallisburg and I was just looking on marketplace for a bike and one happened to pop up and it looked like the perfect size for Moses and it was really close by. So I said, "Jeff, um, are you okay if we just go see if that bike's there?" Because he put it to the road, the likelihood of it being there was quite small. &gt;&gt; And so we went to the address and when we pulled up to the post, uh, there were two bikes sitting &gt;&gt; by it. &gt;&gt; There was a bike that was the perfect size for me and there was a bike right beside it that was the perfect size for Moses. And Jeff said, "I'm going to step out. I'm going to step out and just look at them." And when he took a peek and he came back to the vehicle, he's like, "Damla, those bikes still have the tags on them. They have the stickers." He's like, "They have never been ridden." &gt;&gt; Wow. So, &gt;&gt; by God's grace, &gt;&gt; like he provided two bikes for our family and I took a picture of it cuz I'm like, this is a testimony of &gt;&gt; like God knowing my desire &gt;&gt; and just &gt;&gt; giving it to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I could spend time with my boys. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Another thing is recently, and I shared this with a few of you because I can't hold in what he does because it's just &gt;&gt; too amazing. So, I have to share it. Um, I realized the boys need chore coats because they would come in from the barn and the coats weren't smelling so great. I was like, "We need some fresh coats for church and birthdays and whatnot." So, I started looking on Marketplace and I found this green and black coat, which was perfect because the boys love pretending to be soldiers. Um it was a size five and it was $5 and it was a winter coat. It would keep them warm. So I found one for Moses and I said, "Okay, so we're going to be picking this jacket up for Moses." And right before we were going to go pick it up, the lady messaged me and she was apologizing. She said, "I am so sorry for this inconvenience, but that jacket has a rip in the armpit, so I'm going to give it to you for free." And she said, "I have the same one in a size seven that I'm going to give to you as well." &gt;&gt; So, I was looking for a coat for both Noah and Moses, and the Lord provided a coat for the both of them that are matching, &gt;&gt; and it was completely free. And I even offered her, you know, just what can I give you? She said, "Don't even worry about it. Merry Christmas." &gt;&gt; And so that was another beautiful blessing of God's goodness. &gt;&gt; And a recent one. So I've always had a desire and my prayer was to have chickens because my parents my parents are from Cypress. My grandparents lived in northern Cypress and they were farmers. They had goats and chickens and sheep and a donkey. And so I used to go and get the eggs for them when we visited uh when I was four years old. So we visited Cypress when I was four and my grandmother would ask me to go collect the eggs and ever since then I just love chickens and even though one tried to attack me, I still had a desire to have them. So, um, we we got nine chickens this past summer, but recently Jeff wanted us to find local cheese. So, I was driving to Petroleia and I saw this dairy farm and I said, "Oh, that would be that'd be great for us to stop by maybe on our way back. I've never been there. Um, I love goat cheese, so we'll check it out." And so I stopped in there and I was asking them about goats because we would like to buy or have a goat one day. And the lady said, "Hey, I don't know much about goats, but the farmer here does. His name's Anthony. I'll go get him." And he was just down the hall there. So Anthony came and I asked him a couple questions about goats and he's like, "Look, I I sold all my goats for February. I had 250 and I don't have any right now, but and so I shared with him that we're starting small and we have some chickens and we're kind of building our farm. And he goes, "Well, I have probably 16 or more chickens that I don't need and you're more than welcome to have them." And I was just bubbling and super excited and I was like, "Sure." Like, "Is there anything we can give you for them?" Like, he's like, "Nope." He's like, "I just I want them gone." So he's like, "I'll catch him for you. I'll, you know, give me a call and I'll let you know when I have them in the shed." So in a few days, I gave him a call. And he caught 21 roosters and hens and a baby chick for us, the Royal Rhode Island Red um chickens, and he helped me get them in boxes and we brought them home. And just seeing them out, you know, in the grass the other day was just a blessing. It's like, wow, Lord. Like, &gt;&gt; I'm walking what I prayed. &gt;&gt; Like, you blessed me with these and I didn't even ask. &gt;&gt; You just made a way. You just showed me where to go, who to talk to. And &gt;&gt; so, &gt;&gt; I just praise him. He is &gt;&gt; so faithful. And sometimes, you know, he provides us our desire in a way that we wouldn't even have thought of. So, &gt;&gt; so following from there is divine appointments. So, I've always used this word, especially if I just happened to meet somebody where I wouldn't expect. And the first one was at the boy's dentist appointment. So, I know that need the boys needed um to go in for an appointment and Jeff's like, "Oh, you got a letter like from the government." And when I opened it up, it was free dental care for all of my children for the next year. It's nothing I ever applied for or anything. It just came in the mail. So, I made an appointment at a dental office that Jeff's parents go to. And when Noah was getting his teeth cleaned, I was sitting and the hygienist started to talk to me. And I could tell she was really hungry cuz she started just asking me a lot about my life and about my children and our family. And she started asking me about our church. And she asked me where it was. And I mentioned to her our pastor's name. And she just seemed really excited. And I was just sharing with her how much of a joy it is to be able to be at home and raise my boys and my daughter and to be able to homeschool them. And it was just a beautiful time to share my testimony. And she just wanted to know more and more. &gt;&gt; Well, just as we were finishing up, um, I stepped out of the room and Noah was still in the room getting his coat on. She was on her computer already and she was googling our church. And when she was googling our church, you know, Pastor Dale and Sister Lann's picture showed up on Google. And Noah, being a child, was very honest. And he goes, "Hey, are you looking up our pastor? Are you looking up our church on your computer there?" And I was just there listening. And I kind of looked over and I didn't want her to feel like shy. So I went over and I said yes actually like that that's our church there and that is our pastor and his wife and oh yeah she was she was already looking to see where we were. So that was just a beautiful, beautiful divine appointment and it just shows no matter where you go, &gt;&gt; God is working &gt;&gt; and he, you know, he knows which souls are lost and need to hear, you know, his beautiful testimony and his his love, you know. &gt;&gt; And another time, so this is another testimony uh of Gyrus's birthday. So, we were in Sarnia and I don't usually go into Walmart. I had no desire to go there. Uh, we were just taking Gyrus out for a little drive for his birthday. And I just felt led to go in there just to get a few things for dinner. And little did I know, God was working on someone else who was sitting in their vehicle. She was sitting in her vehicle feeling really sick and she needed to come in and grab a few things, but she hadn't been into a Walmart for two years, but her daughter prayed for her and they thought, "You know what? Let's just go in for a few minutes and gather just the couple things that we need." So, we walked in around the same time and I was in the produce aisle with my boys and I felt a tap on my shoulder and I turned around and this lady was there with a big smile and she said, "I just want to tell you that you look really feminine." And I said, "Oh, thank you." Kind of caught me off guard a bit. I'm like, I really appreciate that. And she kind of just walked off and went back to her daughter. And we saw her again in the aisles. And the boys are like, "That's the lady that came up to you and talked to you." And I I was just honestly praising God as I went from aisle to aisle. I'm like, "See how just by how we are and how we dress, how we present ourselves, or just even the smile on her face can be a testimony." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when we were about to check out, she found me and she stopped me and she came up to me and she said, "I hope you know I didn't make you feel uncomfortable by coming up to you." And she's like, "I just really wanted to share that with you." And I said, "Honestly, I just I thank you. Like what you said to me really touched me and was really special." And I just felt led right there to just share my testimony. I said, I actually I was a Muslim and I came to know Christ when I was 28. And I said, he really worked on me on what modesty was um through his word. And it wasn't because of what others were wearing. &gt;&gt; I just, you know, like the Bible says to dress modest. So I went on a journey of finding out what that was. Said, well, for me, like pants weren't really modest because of what they show. But then I thought of skirts and some skirts aren't modest either. So he really led me to wear longer skirts that are appropriate length that are an appropriate sizing. And she just started to praise God in Walmart. She literally put up her hand and she said, "Thank you, Jesus." That this lady is so bold to like share her faith. &gt;&gt; And she she couldn't believe that I was so forward. And I'm going to share a little bit after as to why she was just so excited and because it was the Lord answering her prayer in a different way. &gt;&gt; So I shared with her too. I'm like, you know, this weekend we're actually getting ready to be around my Muslim family. And she's like, can I pray for you right now regarding that? She's like, I really think you need prayer for that and I'd love to pray for you. So, there we are in the Walmart by multiple checkouts praying to the Lord about another divine appointment that I'm going to have with my parents with a lady that I just met. And it was such a blessing. And she said, "Can we exchange phone numbers?" And so, I gave her my phone number and she called me while I was still standing there leaving me a voicemail saying, "Thank you, Jesus, that we met, Damla." And, you know, I'm so excited for us to have tea together. She was just Yeah. Very excited. So when she actually came over for tea, she started to get emotional at my table and she said, "I've been out here in Wyoming for 4 years." And that was another thing. She lives in Wyoming. She lives 8 minutes from our house. And her husband's name is Jeff, just like mine. And it's spelled the same way. She goes, "Jama, like for four years, I've been looking for a friend who just loves the Lord." And she said, "The night before I met you, I prayed to the Lord to find a friend who loves Jesus, who I can just talk to Jesus about." And I literally was feeling sick. I walked into that Walmart and within a few minutes of talking to you, you started testifying of him. And she's like, "I prayed. I wrote it down. I left it to the Lord." She said, "Then very next day, I met you." &gt;&gt; She said, "Wow, Holy Spirit, that was fast." &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And on our way home Christmas day, she messaged me and said, "Can I come bless you? I want to come to your house and bless you. I just have something to drop off." We were on our way from Walmart. Um, and the boys wanted a turkey and I said, "I didn't buy a turkey. Daddy and mommy are not a huge fan. I just bought chicken." So, we showed up at the house and literally within half an hour, she came to my door. She had a bag and a huge box. She said, "This is from Jesus. It's not for me." She's like, "He put it on my heart to bring this to you today." And in the blue bag was a frozen turkey. &gt;&gt; And in the other box, she filled out just box full of goodies, cheeses and olives and whatnot and oranges. And she just left it at her door and she said, "We'd love for you to come over New Year's Eve and I'd love to have you over for tea next week." &gt;&gt; This is after one time of fellowshipping with her. &gt;&gt; And she's already been such a blessing in our life. And I thank God for his divine appointments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have one more thing to share &gt;&gt; regarding divine dreams. So this sister that I met at Walmart, she said to me, "You know, my husband and I pray even before we go to any birthday party. It's just something we do. We pray about everything. And it really convicted me in that moment. I said a lot of times I don't pray. Like if there's a birthday party, I just, oh, it's a family member. I'm going like it's just kind of something you decide sometimes without thinking to ask God like, "Do you want me there?" &gt;&gt; So she said the one time they were driving to a birthday party at a church and she goes to Jeff and she goes, "Did we pray about going?" And he goes, "I don't think we did." And she said instead of stopping on that bridge and praying, they just continued on. And when they arrived at the church, she said they had a big van that had um a magic, it was basically a a magic show van. They were going to do magic at the church for this birthday. And they know what the Bible says about that. And once they saw that van of the magic at the church, they just turned around and left. And it just showed them the importance of praying before going somewhere. And so my sister's nephew's birthday was coming up and she's my only sister, he's my only nephew on my side of the family. And so I thought to pray about it. And a sister in this church as well does the same. You know, she prays before even visiting somebody. And so I said, "Okay, Lord, I'm going to pray about this. I'm going to give it to you." So the night before, the Lord gave me a dream of being there. It was very clear. But in my dream, I was 30 minutes late, exactly half an hour late to the birthday. So we're at church and I know we're going to leave in good time to make it there early. The party was starting at 3:00 and I had to follow Jeff home because we had two vehicles. One was kind of acting up. So I followed him home. I only had Kazaya and on my way on London line there, the screen went completely black uh where the radio is and then my speedometer dropped and came back up. It's like, okay, that was odd. I've never had it do that. It's been having voltage issues, but I've never had it do that. So, when I got home, I told Jeff um he didn't seem too concerned at the time. He's like, "We're just going to we'll go in. We'll take the journey there, and I'll just kind of see what it's doing." So, my GPS said we'd be there 10 minutes early to the party. And on our way to Strathroy, the journey did it again. It went completely dark on the screen. Speedometer kicked down. And then it kept doing that repeatedly and Jeff was like, "Damla, we're not going to be able to take this all the way there." It's like, "Something is wrong." And I'm kind of smiling because I'm like, "Wow, Lord." Like, you showed this to me in my dream that we would be late. And I I had no idea why. Like I I thought maybe it was just my brain conjuring up something that wasn't going to happen. But so we had to turn around. We went back home. We had to take all the car seats and put them in the other van. And Jeff was just getting everything ready. So when he came into the van for us to drive there, he gets in the van and he goes, "Oh, I was going to screw the plate on to the back of the van." And I didn't do that, but I know we're late so we can get going. And I look at my phone and it says we're going to get there at 3:27. party was supposed to start at 3:00. My dream said we're a half an hour late. And so I go to Jeff and I go, "You have 3 minutes." So he gets out of the van, he goes and screws the plate on, and as he came back and he sat down and he looks over to my phone and goes, "What time is it now?" The arrival time switches to 3:30. So, we got to the party exactly 30 minutes late, exactly how the Lord showed me in my dream. And honestly, it was his will because when we arrived there, there's probably 30 plus unsafe souls of my family and my sister's friends. &gt;&gt; And when we arrived, it was like it just kind of went quiet and everyone kind of looked over and then everyone was really excited and one by one, they came to greet us. But what touched me the most was my cousin's daughter. So my cousin had her husband leave her um for another woman and she's been raising her two daughters by herself. And so those two daughters have grown up without a father figure. And the one my cousin's daughter um she's now in her 20s and she was one of the first people to come and greet me. And I smiled at her and Kaziah smiled at her and then I just gave her a hug and she started weeping and sobbing uncontrollably. She's like, "I have no idea why I'm crying right now." She just didn't understand it. And like in my heart in that moment, I felt the Lord say it's because she's getting a hug from her heavenly father, from her true father. you know, she's been absent of her real father, but here I am just truly loving her unconditionally through God's love and just praying and believing for the salvation of her soul and for every person there. And within that half hour and a half that we were there, the Lord truly used me and had me go from person to person just &gt;&gt; sharing what I could in those moments. Um, but that that time there with my sister really brought us closer together. So, I just want to praise his name. There's so much more I can share, but um I want to thank you for listening and just here today. I just wanted to give him glory in all things. So, praise the Lord. Thank you. Uh I don't think any of us fell asleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was very very beautiful. And you know if uh you would have a hard time telling Sister Damla that God wasn't real. And you know, God's been dealing with me on this standpoint is the reason God's dealing with sister Damla or different ones of you &gt;&gt; is or not is based on is your angel comfortable &gt;&gt; and if you're living or participating or allowing in your you're under your umbrella. Something that the angel is not comfortable with, you'll never have a testimony like sister don. It just won't happen because the prophet said this. He said, um, if you start acting different than the angel, he said, it'll leave. &gt;&gt; Don't mean you're don't mean you're not you're backsliding. &gt;&gt; But you won't have that kind of experience. So, you know, we know this that, you know, Christians, real Christians can't backslide. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible gives so many because because God don't save you to lose you. &gt;&gt; See, God God's not a bad businessman. When he buys something, he really buys it well. &gt;&gt; And so, but we become cold or indifferent and he steps aside until we come back to him. So, Brother Bram said things like this. He said, "When you if your nature starts woing or barking or or fussing or that, he said the dove will he said if you went in a place that the Holy Spirit wasn't welcome, the dove would wait at the door until you come back." &gt;&gt; We listened to I I listened to all of it. Lynn went for a walk, but I listened to a message Steve Brzant preached on mind control and it it was a very old message, but wow. You know, we I I would challenge all of you to really uh if you want a a life that's filled with things that God does every day, you have to watch how Satan will fight that. And he is so smooth. So he's Satan is almost the Bible says unrecognizable. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; sir. He says it would deceive the very elected &gt;&gt; if your name wasn't if it was possible. &gt;&gt; So Satan Well, that's probably okay. If it's only probably, it probably isn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I tell you, I've done things wrong my whole life that Satan's showing me that, you know, maybe, &gt;&gt; you know, we we hear, you know, the whole world we live in is propaganda &gt;&gt; and and and and it it just is. Nothing is the same. and and it's just so I I I tell you just wow it's a beautiful testimony sister you were very short couldn't believe it you can tell that testimony anytime you know anything that gives glory to God &gt;&gt; that's why we come together &gt;&gt; man the girls sing is special it's because it gives glory to God &gt;&gt; man it's not about anybody it's Oh, it was glory. Sister DMA's testimony was supernatural. &gt;&gt; Everything she shared, she could not have planned. &gt;&gt; That's not possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, wow. &gt;&gt; God's good. Amen. This kind of our New Year's Eve service for those that are online, but we'll we'll do it next week. We'll do it offline next week. And so, any of you that are online, if you didn't hear Sister Dma's testimony real well or the girl special, we'll just rebook that in next week. Amen. But we will certainly do communion also. Just God is God is the same yesterday, today and forever &gt;&gt; if you will allow him to be. &gt;&gt; He He is already, but he will be to you if you will allow him. And how you will allow him is is his angel welcome &gt;&gt; or comfortable? Better yet, comfortable. I would say he's welcome, but is he comfortable? &gt;&gt; You know, hospitality is a gift. Yes, &gt;&gt; people can come to their place &gt;&gt; and not be welcome. &gt;&gt; Not everybody's got that. &gt;&gt; But is he comfortable? &gt;&gt; Comfortable. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we love those that are are not able to be with us today greatly. There's many out. Brother Bernard and Sister Ruth are out and their family and brother Matt and Abigail and they Satan's been they first they were sick and then it snowed 2 feet and now it's icy 2 ft of ice they probably got up there. It's can you imagine it was minus two there pouring rain. I imagine they got and uh sister Margaret and brother Lu and London we love you all. and brother Jim and Chadam and sister Joanie and Betroya just different ones just greatly greatly appreciate you all. Let's uh maybe we'll stand and read a verse in 2 Kings 7 3 and I'll just uh I'll just preach a short message if that's all right. I mean if God will let me do message. Sometimes it's hard to stop. But I'll I'll preach maybe part of this and it's just a message, but maybe I'll do part today and maybe do part when we have communion or something. But Amen. Second 2 Kings 7 three. Amen. And there was four lepous men at the entering of the gate. And they said one to another, "Why sit here? We Why sit we here until we die?" Lord God, we just pray that you will bless your people, Lord. And Lord, you understand the weather here. We live in Canada. this winter time. And Lord, I pray a a double blessing on the ones that would have been here if they could have been. And Lord, the ones that choose to not be here that Lord, we pray for them. And Lord, I pray that you would just send divine love, divine love to them and and show them that we make lots of mistakes, but you are perfect. You are Jehovah Gyra, and we love you, Lord God. and be with the ones that are here and may you just be with the ministering of the word we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. I want to minister on something uh uh just very unique in that. But you know in our walk with God, every one of us it's an individual walk. Our our walk is individual. But we must overcome our own individual fear &gt;&gt; and and that's a daily occurrence because uh everything we do as a risk and I know I preached this not uh maybe I did preach on fear not that long ago but I want to show you different examples through the Bible how people overcame their fear. So we see here in 2 Kings in the in the previous chapter here that the city was under a siege and it was under a great famine the city of Samaria. You know you'll see that in in chapter 6 and verse 24. And it came to pass that after this that uh uh the the king of Syria had gathered all the hosts and went up and besieged Samaria and there was a great famine in the city. And the famine was so great. It's so unbelievable. Well, well, here it said that behold that they besieged it until till a donkey's head was sold for four score pieces of silver. Sounded like our inflation today. And and four parts of a clove of a dove was dragged for five pieces of silver. And if you read all these scriptures in here, you'll see where the the king of the city actually came beside himself because people were eating their own flesh. They the people were beside themselves. And so this major army, you'd have to picture this in the old times, it was a walled city. and the the wall cities in in a in a poor designed city. Uh if an army came and seized that city for a long period of time, they would eventually if they had no when the food run out, it run out. But worse than even the food was the water. And so if there wasn't a natural spring or wells or or a river that went through that water, what you could be in those four walls and you would be safe overnight or you'd be safe for a week or you'd be safe for a month. But if you were seized, you would never be safe forever. And you know many of us do things in our life that that we can be safe for a day or we can be safe for a week or we can be safe for a month. We can even be safe for most of your life. But at some point you will see that the siege will come in and you will start to die. You will either die of regret or or different things that you've done. You know if you do you know the Bible says hold not the sins of my youth to my charge. But you know those sins, God can wash them away perfectly clean, 100% clean, but he can never take away the regret that you'll have for committing them. &gt;&gt; Most all of us that are older in our life would have things that we would change completely if God gave us the power for it. Now, we know that he permitted it. But we see here these four lepers were sitting outside the city gate. And the city had been seized. These people were only put outside the city because they had leprosy. But the people inside the city were starving to death. They were thirsting to death, eating their own flesh. And the lepers got what was left over which was nothing. And many of the times if you will just step out in Christ, you know, when when Joshua crossed the the the river, the water never stopped flowing until they stepped into the water. But you have to be willing to take a risk. You have to be willing to trust God. You have to be willing to to believe the scriptures that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you're never going to confine that in your own ability. and and how you're going to fight the the black dog and the white dog that's inside of you and and how are you going to convince the black dog that God's got everything under control? Amen. But these lepers came to a spot. They said that every one of us have to come. They said we're going to die. We're going to die. And we're going to die if we sit right here. And we're going to die if we get up and try. And you know, in our spiritual walk, God will never penalize somebody for trying. A a a general in an army will never penalize a soldier for falling down. He'll penalize them for not trying to get out. And it and as parents and that when our kids make mistakes, if they're trying, Amen. If they get up again, I I shouldn't have done that, but I was dead wrong. But I recognize my mistake. You know, Brother Brham said this in studying for communion. He said, you know, uh he said, you have to be trying your best to serve God. What makes you worthy for communion is your your heart's desire is to be perfect. you what makes you not what makes you worthy for communion is not perfection because we're still here. &gt;&gt; So none of us are perfect. &gt;&gt; That's great. &gt;&gt; But what makes you worthy of communion is that you desire to be perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you're if you don't desire and you're a hypocrite and you're willfully living a double life, if you're willfully living in the world a double standard, then you become a stumbling block for the world and you become a hypocrite and God will charge you for it and he actually will put you to sleep. The Bible says that in communion that if you take communion unworthily that you would be that many sleep because they take it unworthily and that being interpreted is death. So God don't God don't like hypocrites. God loves people that are trying. And so here these lepers they came to desperation which it takes most of us to to make a major change in our life. we come to desperation and and I you know if I wish Steve would come and preach that message first but if he doesn't I might steal some of his notes and try to but I I want to shock you with something that you don't realize but everything you believe in your life on earth in flesh is a lie &gt;&gt; you might as well believe that because I could prove that upside to Everything everything is controlled by Satan. The Bible says this is Satan's Eden. So he's the boss of everything. &gt;&gt; So everything you believe is a lie. And he's working through Rome and different secret societies. And you know most of the people that we would would would admire or the companies we would admire are owned by Satan. And you can see and I I'm I'm robbing some of Steve's notes, but he would see any of these people that do different things, they would show you signs that now I want to show you something and he mentioned this. Forgive me, brother Steve. Uh if you're talking to him, Julie, you can. But he said, you know, watch. He said, you know, on my business card or sorry, I mean our church business card, we and even on our pulpit, we have a cross. That's fairly standard. &gt;&gt; I would say the most heathen pagan person, no matter what religion you are, you would recognize the cross, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But almost nobody would recognize what's around that cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you do. &gt;&gt; Why? because you're a member. &gt;&gt; It's exactly the same thing in Satan's kingdom. &gt;&gt; You can look at every professional sports has the sun god worship, the pyramid worship, the Lucifer worship &gt;&gt; as in every symbol in society. Every big business has it. Listen, they spend trillions of dollars to make their symbol logo and those big companies and they'll hide an upside down cross, which is fall of Christianity. Can you imagine a Christian ever wearing an upside down cross? I've seen it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; After I took straight oxygen, I tried to recover. You know, the Bible says that and and and I would preach that is, you know, God's people fail for lack of knowledge. There's things that you not you can't participate in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, you you don't have to believe that, but I'll guarantee you this. Your angel ain't going in with you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll guarantee you that God believes it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I used it before as an example just as Starbucks. Starbucks is all about the goddess of sex straight from hell pagan. And even their CEO says we do not want any not not Christians. He didn't say Christian. He said we don't have any even normal people money. Who would say you wouldn't want other people's money? They say we don't want anybody's normal people's money. We only want gay and lesbians people's money. Why did they say that? Because they're a member of a society &gt;&gt; that's called Lucifer. And so just like you recognize the cross and less would recognize what's around the cross. Or if I had an eagle up here catching a two-edged sword, which was a sword of the word of God, which was sharper than a two-edged sword to decipher even to the marrow of the bone, the word of God. You would recognize that. &gt;&gt; The world wouldn't. &gt;&gt; My family wouldn't recognize it. Why? Because it's a different kingdom. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And those people recognize their kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know where that came from. That's not my fear. But you, you know, we come to a desperation that it takes a radical decision to make. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you I'm going to show you maybe two examples and then I'm going to shut up where you'll compromise yourself silly. Everybody does. You don't have to tell me you're compromising. If you're breathing, you're compromising. &gt;&gt; I have five or six examples here, but let me just tell you here. So, let's just go to verse four. And he says, "If we say we'll enter the city, then the famine in the city is we shall die there." So, we could go in the gate. The people wouldn't let us in the gate because we got leprosy. But if we were able to get inside the gate of the city, we would die there. And if we sit here, we're going to die here. We die also. So now therefore, let's come and let us fall into the host of the army that's around the Syrians, around the city. And if they shall save us alive, we shall live. And if they kill us, well, we were going to die anyway. &gt;&gt; Do you see how they're they're judging in their mind? Is this a good decision? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they came to the spot they said, "We're going to die." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we might as well die moving. &gt;&gt; Because if IT TURNS OUT REALLY bad in our decision, we're going to die anyway. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But see, God loves movers. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something this morning. God loves Sister Da's testimony. He loves movers and shakers. &gt;&gt; Watch what he did here. Verse 5. And they rose up in the twilight to go unto the cap cap the the the camp of the the army that was around the city. And when they were come to the uppermost part of the camp, behold, there was no one there. Now wait a minute. The city was eating their children. The Bible says that. The Bible says that when people in the city started auctioning, they said, "We'll eat your son today. Wait the other tomorrow." And the king the king heard that and the king went like cuckoo. That's in this scripture. &gt;&gt; He started losing his mind. &gt;&gt; But because they decided to to take a risk, watch this, a risk for the Lord. They weren't popular. They were lepers. See, God don't care how popular you are, how big you are, how little you are. He wants you to take a risk. You know what that's called? Faith. You know what the Bible says? It is impossible without faith to please God. &gt;&gt; It is impossible for you to step out and serve God and please him without taking a risk. And watch what God did. As soon as he seen them, you you don't think God seen them wondering in their mind, well, we're going to die here. If we go in the city, we're going to die. So, let's just go out and attack the enemy. This was the enemy, by the way. &gt;&gt; It's like Walmart. We're going to go to Walmart. We haven't been there for 2 years, but we're going to go to the enemy's camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch this. Watch what the Lord did. For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians, the enemy, to hear the noise of chariots. NOW, I WANT TO JUST clarify something. THERE WAS FOUR LEOPARDS going there on barefoot, but because they decided to take a risk, &gt;&gt; they decided to stick their neck out. The Lord made the host of the army of Now, this was a big enough army to besiege the city until starvation to make them hear loud noises of chariots. This is verse six. NOISES OF HORSES. They never had any horses. And noises of a great host. Four people. &gt;&gt; You're a mighty army this morning. Because there's more than four people here. &gt;&gt; Why did God do that? Let me ask you a question. Would God have done that if they would have stayed where they were? &gt;&gt; They took a risk. &gt;&gt; And that risk &gt;&gt; was faith. And they said one to another, "Lo, the king of the Israel has hired against us the king of the Hittites." And the king So the here the people that had camped the city had thought the city had called on Google on their cell phones and they called all the other uh you know uh well I could make it modern, but uh it's okay. We'll make it modern. I don't mind jail. They have free food. You know, you know, the states had lots of gall to put on when they were seizing the oil tankers of Venezuela. But when Venezuela left this here Friday with three oil tankers and their own military guarding them, the states never put that on YouTube &gt;&gt; cuz it was egg in their face. BECAUSE CHINA and Russia said, "If you keep touching our oil, &gt;&gt; you're gonna have problems." &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; see how propaganda is so false? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so here they thought that here here the the king this the the army that's around the city the Samaritans when they heard all this noise they said well the people in the city has hired an army to come in and attack us and they flee for their life. It hired the Gizzites. My bed was and all these people to come against us. And so verse 7, and therefore they arose and fled the twilight, and they left their tents. Now, now God did every bit of this. See, they never had cell phone signal there. Like the internet service was terrible. And they hadn't sent a man running out to tell them to hire the army. That city couldn't have hired anybody. They were worried about living. &gt;&gt; And the army at twilight, they left their tents and their horses and their asses and even the camp as it was and they fled FOR THEIR LIFE. WHY did the enemy fled for their life? I I want to just drive this home. Why did the army fled for its life after it had been encamped and entrenched and dug in for years? Yeah. Years, not days, not weeks, and not months. That city would have been able to withstand a famine for a long time. You know, they close the grocery stores around our town. Our basement will be able to withstand a famine for probably about a year and a half. or two because we have a stockpile of food. What city don't have food on the shelf of the grocery store? But after a year or two, the shelves start emptying out because they're not getting replenished. &gt;&gt; And in verse eight, this is what God did. They fled for their lives. The army fled. And verse 8, "And when these leopards came to the outermost part of the enemy's camp, they went into one tent, and they did eat and drink, and carried hence the silver and the gold, and the raignment, and they went and hid it, cuz they were stockpiled." And they came again and they entered into another tent and carried hence also. And when it hit it, why did they get the food and the drink and the gold and the silver? Because they never made a decision. They stayed right where they were. They were just going to die. No, it was because they took a risk to say, I believe God is in control. I believe God is going to take care of me &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to sit here. You know what? As a believer, I'm not going down just sitting in my chair, you know, all defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. And verse nine, let's just read this. And then they said one to another, we do well this day, and this is good tidings. Behold the peace God had blessed them in the morning. And and and we should carry this to the king's household. And let's just jump to 14. I want to show you. So actually, you can post up 14. And here they they went back to the king. They went back to the city that was dying, that had no faith. They went back to the king. If you read this in the scripture, I'm just paraphrasing it. They went back to the king that they were eating their own flesh. &gt;&gt; And the king said, "It's a trick. God's tricking us." That's what they said. Now, there might be other verses, but you can read this if you're home and that you read these vers. They said, "IT'S A TRICK. THEY'VE TRICKED US, and they're going to wait till we go out and do something for God, and then they're going to capture us. Now they were going to die every way. The wa watch this. Watch this. The the king the king had their leader had zero faith. And it was and and I'm just reading between this, but it was the people that that talked with the king of the city and said, "Well, let's just send out one horse and a couple people." And if we know God couldn't have done it, but it will be a great loss if we just lose them. BUT PER CHANCE, GOD'S STILL THE SAME. JUST PER CHANCE. I I KNOW WE PRAYED, but we don't believe. Like when Peter came to the door and they said, "It's a ghost." We prayed for Peter to come out of jail, but he's knocking at the door and and you know, they go to answer the door and they said, "Well, it can't be Peter cuz we know he's in jail." Even though we're praying, he gets free. So, it's his ghost. &gt;&gt; SEE HOW PEOPLE ALWAYS GOT an answer? And so the king sent it and he seen it and he realized that it was real. And see here the prophet had prophesied that God was going to change the scene. And the people in the city and the king and the and the keeper of the gate had marked the prophet and marked the prophet. The prophet had come up and said, you know, in the beginning of this chapter, he said, you know, the price of food is going to be worthless cuz it's going to drop. And the guy at the gate said, I'll believe that when I see it. He said, you'll see it, but you'll never taste of the food. And he died when they stampede the city, leaving the gates. because he mocked God. Verse 16. And the people went out and they spoiled the tents of the Syrians. And so the measure of fine flour was sold for a shackle and two measures of barley for a shackle according according to the word of the Lord. Now if you continue, the guy that had mocked God, the keeper of the gate, he seen it, but he was killed. Why? because he didn't believe God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is that is just an example of zillions of examples in the Bible that you when you're serving God, you'll have to overcome your own fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just give you another one, another example, and we'll close on this one. And maybe maybe it'll be fast, but let me give you Esther for an example. Esther was a Jew. And here Hmon the Morortei had had uh and and Hmon saw that Morortei was a Jew also and he was a beggar. But Hagen Morortei, sorry, never showed reverence to Hmon. And and and and Hmon got lifted up in wrath. He be careful with your wrath because it'll control you. &gt;&gt; You won't you won't hurt the people you're wrath with. It'll hurt you. &gt;&gt; Be careful with that root of bitterness. It don't grow in the other people's life. It grows in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You let it get a hold of you and it will destroy your life. You'll be so bitter. Every word that'll come out of your mouth will be charcoal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what destroyed Hmon. He seen Mori was a Jew and because Mordei refused to bow to him because he thought he was a big shot. He sat on the right side of the king. He put forth a very law took it tricked the king and took a law that would destroy all the Jews. And that's that's actually in Esther 3 and verse 5 maybe five and six if we read Esther 1 31 sorry. And after these things did the king promote Hmon and advance him and he sat on the seat of the princes. You know you got to be careful with that promotion. And so here, Hmon, he was so bugged by Mori that he built the gallows for him, but he got the king to pass the law that the that they could their people could kill and destroy all the Jews. And the letter was sent out, let's just drop to verse 13, uh Vicki. And a letter was sent out by post unto all the king's provinces to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish all Jews, both young and old, little children and women in one day, even upon the 13th day of the 12th month. Here was their and there was their goddess month and their thing and and they could spoil all their wealth. &gt;&gt; And here Esther was the queen of the king. And Esther was exactly like me and she was exactly like you. She had to calculate if she could survive. &gt;&gt; And so here Mori was her uncle that was out. And when Mori realized what he was done, he rents his clothes. And then we go to verse three. And let's just read verse three. And every province, whethersoever the king's commandment decrees. Now see, the king wouldn't have did this, but he did it out of the hatred of Hmon and the jealousy of Hmon. Sister Dama, you're fine. I can't even hear it. And and here here, watch this. And so it it went out through all the country, and the Jews went to fasting, weeping, and wailing, and many laid in sackcloth and ashes. Uh-oh. And here comes verse four. Here we are. And so Esther and her maids and her chamberlains came out and they told her. And when the when was then the was the queen exceedingly grieved. Watch this. Watch this. You got to catch this. She was grieved. But watch how she dealt with it. First, she sent Raymond to clothe Mori and to take away the sackcloth from him and he received it. Not Esther wanted to go away that it wasn't going to cost her her neck. And she said, "I'll just send my servants out to my uncle with a clean set of clothes and he can stop praying and he can stop weeping and he can stop wailing and we'll pretend that God's in our midst." &gt;&gt; Is that not what she did? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Esther's servant in verse 9 came and told Esther the words of Mori. Mordei would not accept her poor quality of sending new clothes. And we'll go to verse 11 just to save time. And and I mean if you want this whole story and if I'm you can read this but all the king's servants and the people in the king's province do know here Mori had sent the word to Esther that you ARE YOU ARE GOD'S people and you could have been born for such a time as this. And Esther had to work through her fear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She had a lot of fear. &gt;&gt; If Esther would have been the four lepers, she would have stayed right where she was. She said, "Well, I'm just going to die right here as the queen. They can come and kill me on my seat." Because Esther went back to Mori and she said, "All the king's servants and all the king's priests of the provinces do know that whatsoever man or woman shall come into the king into the inner court who has not been called, there is one law that he'll put him to death." And Esther had to worry about death. &gt;&gt; She was afraid. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She was afraid. &gt;&gt; Except such of whom the king shall hold out the golden sceppler that he may live. And Esther did not believe that she could go to the king and live. And so Esther was willing that everybody in her lineage would be butchered and lose not just their life but their everything. And Mori said to her, she said, "Do you think that you're going to be saved sitting on the queen's throne when they realize who you are?" Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think you're going to be saved because you're a borderline believer when they realize &gt;&gt; what kingdom you're a part of? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When they recognize what you believe in the cross and you're a lukewarm believer and you think, "Well, I just slide through." But they don't believe the cross. They believe things like this and like this &gt;&gt; and and on and on and on. &gt;&gt; And that's how they identify &gt;&gt; their membership. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And here we'll we'll continue on there in that verse. But I have not been called. Esser's justifying her fear. She said, I have not been called to come to the king's house for these 30 days. You know, we have not seen Wait, this is I'm Can I tell a short lie? WE HAVE NOT SEEN GOD MOVE IN this church for 30 days. That That's a lie. Sorry. But just to and so I'm not going to take a risk now. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what Esther was saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, forgive me, God, because we have seen him the last 30 days. And Esther's servants, verse 12, went back and told Mori Esther's testimony. &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there for just a second. In verse 13, was Esther's testimony as positive as Sister Damas today? Uh-uh. She was afraid. &gt;&gt; She was afraid to be afraid. In verse 13, and Mori verse 13 and Mori commanded Esther said, "Think not thyself that you're going to die also." &gt;&gt; You think you're going to escape by being a &gt;&gt; quiet by being a makebeliever? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; More than all the rest of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Yeah. here in verse 14. For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there be an enlargement, deliverance, arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. See what Mori had a mountain of faith. He said, if you won't serve God, God will raise up somebody else to serve him. He if you won't praise God, God will raise up. The rocks will cry out and you will die. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And your father's house will be destroyed. And whom knoweth whether thou were come to the kingdom for such a faith for such a time as this? And you know how the story goes. But if we go to 16 verse 16 and just the end of 16, Esther came back to Mori and it it watch this. I want to show you the decision that Esther made was based on her uncle's faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Let me rephrase that. The decision Esther made was based 100% on her uncle's faith. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just put something in here. This is straight from God. That's why God says to not forsake the assembling of yourself &gt;&gt; together. Because there will be a time &gt;&gt; when brother Dale is weak. &gt;&gt; And it'll be your faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That'll rise me up. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even people that stand behind the pulpit, they get weaker than anybody else quicker &gt;&gt; normally. Verse 16, she said, "Gather all the Jews together and pray and fast, Mary." But if you go to the end of this, "And so will I go into the king, which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I'll perish." &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we believe I believe as Christians, we'll follow the law as long as it don't become between you and God's law. &gt;&gt; That's where it completely draws the line. You know, most people don't realize, but everybody in the Bible, almost everybody, &gt;&gt; I could show you dozen, at least a dozen, all broke the law of the land &gt;&gt; to serve God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And most of you would think they're pretty great people. &gt;&gt; But also, most of you today Would you do the same thing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God requires us to conquer our fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. God requires us to conquer our fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's many, many scriptures we'll go into next week, but you have to you cannot serve. There's no fear in love. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but perfect love casts out fear. But you know, you see, you can't do nothing. You can't do nothing out of fear. &gt;&gt; People that are consumed with fear are completely handicapped. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to drive. I'm afraid to fly. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to go on a high bridge. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to go in a cave. I'm afraid to &gt;&gt; I'm just afraid. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe you're afraid for a reason. You don't have faith in the right thing. Amen. If you have faith in God and God sees your fa that you know the Bible talks about a grain of mustard seed. Now I want to show you something. I used to pull mustard as a kid and it was worse than a nightmare. But a grain of mustard seed is like beach sand. Like one grain of sand. It's like treeful seed. You got eyes like me. You probably couldn't even see it. You could feel it. It's tiny, but it'll grow so big that the birds will lodge in it like a tree. Amen. A grain of mustard seed. If God sees a grain of mustard seed and your faith, he'll make the enemy you're an army. &gt;&gt; You'll make the enemy you're an army &gt;&gt; because he sees your faith. Well, I want to close with this. It's a without faith, without a risk. See, faith is the evidence of things hoped for, &gt;&gt; but the things not seen. &gt;&gt; Without a risk, it is impossible for you to please God. &gt;&gt; Impossible. Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. Let's stand. Amen. Amen. God knows what he's doing. We'll have our communion next Sunday, Lord willing. If there ain't another ice storm. &gt;&gt; Uh at some point we'll just end up having it if we have a good oldfashioned winter. &gt;&gt; Might just have to do that. Amen. Amen. God is good, man. &gt;&gt; Amen. All the time. Let's sing that song we were singing. have blow the trumpet. It's a very, very, very short song. Jared sings beautiful, beautiful songs, but he ain't sing this one for a while. You know, God loves worship. &gt;&gt; The very meaning of God is an object of worship. &gt;&gt; And the only ones that can really worship him are the ones that are a part of him. born again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If you're a part of God, you really worship the deity, you know, and I I I want to just say this and close. I I'm going to say it next week, so this is going to be rerun for you all, but you know, uh in our church here, we have too much fear. We do. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be perfect in my eyes. &gt;&gt; If God's dealing with your heart, it's not about pleasing me. &gt;&gt; It's about you pleasing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's somebody here and God's moving on your heart and you want to cry, you cry. It's okay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If God's moving on your kids' heart and they want to be a runus, let them be a runus, &gt;&gt; you don't think God can make them quiet. &gt;&gt; If you want to get up and run the aisles and that's God, you run the aisles. &gt;&gt; And if you want to speak in tongues and God will have somebody to interpret it or prophesy or sing a special &gt;&gt; or do any of the nine spiritual gifts, Who are you afraid of? &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of me. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm a the only the only person that we want to this is a different type of fear is respect. Fear of respects to God. But if God wants to manifest something in anybody's life, you know you I this is fresh. I you got to hear this. Do you know the way we run our church &gt;&gt; is Catholic? &gt;&gt; I'm sure you're standing, but just just take a minute. The way I'm dressed up this morning is Catholic. &gt;&gt; Because I'm higher than you is Catholic. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Catholic. Do you know in the New Testament the churches were in homes sitting around on the same level in a circle and it was A FELLOWSHIP? BUT WE'VE RAISED UP A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. YOU WANT SOME HOLY PERSON TO PUT A ROBE ON, WEAR A GOLDEN CROWN, &gt;&gt; and we're going to hire good singers. &gt;&gt; But I a fellowship &gt;&gt; is you have as much to say as I do. &gt;&gt; You say, "But I'm not called to preach." I didn't say that. &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll cry. Maybe you'll prophesy. &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll run the aisles. &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll testify. &gt;&gt; And we have we have out of fear, we've taken the participaction out of the people and raised up a holy priesthood that don't read the Bible. &gt;&gt; All of that's Rome. &gt;&gt; Remember, Rome didn't want you to have a Bible. We'll tell you what you're supposed to believe. We'll tell you when you're supposed to speak in tongues. We'll tell you if you're supposed to prophesy. We'll tell you if you're supposed to testify. But what if God tells you to testify? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what if God didn't tell me that he told you to testify and you hold it in? Amen. &gt;&gt; What if God told you to get blessed, but he didn't tell me that you were going to get blessed and he wanted to bless the whole body and you hold it in because you're afraid of &gt;&gt; See, if we're going to get rid of some of the Roman doctrines, we want to get rid of them all. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If somebody wants to start praying and crying, you're not going to interrupt God. &gt;&gt; We got so much church order, we don't even have church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We just have Rome. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something. Rome has great church order &gt;&gt; and doctrine. &gt;&gt; Nobody says a thing except one person. &gt;&gt; That's right. Wow, that was free. &gt;&gt; That was that's completely free. &gt;&gt; But you know, you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And if God blesses you, you're only going to bless other people by letting other people see that God bless you. &gt;&gt; So fear, you can just woo. We're not here to impress me &gt;&gt; or one another. We're here to impress God. &gt;&gt; And that'll make participation a lot greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. I don't know where that come from. Amen. God help us to be free and serve him and &gt;&gt; and be what we're supposed to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I I got to say this. I'm not afraid of being out of order &gt;&gt; because we just don't have that problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Most of us known each other for years. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid of being dead. &gt;&gt; Completely dead. Let's just worship God. And it might not fit the Bolton board for today. We didn't have this plan for today, but God did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We just love Amen. We want you to grow in &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Christ. And And God blesses you for something. Just if you hold it in, you're going to pop. So blow your whistle. blow your whistle. &gt;&gt; And we're going to blow our whistle now. &gt;&gt; You know, you know how to sing it. You were singing with me yesterday and you said we had sung it for a long time. &gt;&gt; This is Bible, by the way. Blow the trumpet in Zion God's holy mountain. Blow the trumpet in Zion Zion. Soundly alive. Blow the trumpet in Zion Zion. Sadly in God's holy mountain. Blow the trumpet in Zion Zion. I know there's words of that. I don't have let's sing that song and God bless you. We love you. Thank you for risking your neck to come here. And thank goodness the rest of my day risk the night to come here. So this both ways is good. Oh, heat, heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat.
