Luanne are going to sing a song The Lighthouse there's a lighthouse man God bless you we welcome you all in just some way we didn't hear from Sister Patty I'm sure she's probably coming or manner maybe Ruth and brother Bernard sister Ruth but a different one just remember the ones we seen brother Jim this week and they're doing very good you know he'd be here if he had somebody watching sister Linda he was actually going to try and be here today in different ones brother John Blackman's doing well we actually realized some some positive things we're trying to get him to watch his services online and he's going to a service in the home but but uh we want to introduce him to brother Matt and when God gives brother Matt a big bus uh the brother John's old age home is about two miles off the 21 Highway or last literally uh and I said you know would you like to be picked up like once a month or he said well I would come if there was something special amen but just remember brother John and different ones and one's coming and and that God and also remember our trip to Uganda God's just things are just coming together so beautifully and I know uh brother Jose is getting excited and different ones and uh just uh you know not that so much that we would have a good time but the presence of God would be Supernatural it's just amazing it'd be amazing man we'll sing this song and then we'll let our brother John come in you're welcome to sing it with us we're but you know the world don't see God's plan like God sees it amen and what God the what God called important the world called foolish you know the Bible says through the foolishness of preaching it's completely ridiculous it makes no sense at all but God would bring men to him amen and what man you know what the world sees is a little Lighthouse and small and insignificant and you're really not doing much for God says one soul one so I would have came for one ten thousand ten thousand worlds amen amen amen there's the lighthouse on the hillside that over looks like seeing and when I'm tossed it stands alive that I might see and I like that shines in darkness now we're safely lead me home if it was sinful that lighthouse the would say another mode and I thank God for the light of us [Music] the lighthouse and from the rocks [Music] I might clearly see if it was [Music] [Music] the big ships they don't say this way anymore and there's no use [Music] [Music] [Music] and I thank God for the lighthouse is [Music] [Music] [Music] around me that I might clearly see if it was [Music] amen thank you Lord Jesus so true I mean let's stand and we'll just invite our brother John to come maybe we'll sing only believe amen as their brother comes out of you just talking to Brother John just over breakfast I really find this is an amazing thought you know I only believe thinking of it is your god is as big as you have faith for him if you have a problem in your life and you say God can't do it he can't do it for you because you don't believe you can do it but if you have the faith to believe that he can do it that problem's a piece of cake to God it's it's not even he won't even get a strain or pull a sweat or nothing just if you would just only believe amen our Prophet taught aside the angel loved this song because you just had to believe God can do the impossible I could never do it God could do it [Music] foreign [Music] do you believe this morning God can do anything above and beyond anything that we can believe anything that we've ever experienced we just have to believe I uh in keeping in line with what brother Dale was saying our pastor I was just thinking you know a lot so many times we often think if I just had more of the Holy Ghost I just need more you know I would overcome or this would change if I just had more and and I was thinking about that you know when we say that we limit what God can do we're saying that one drop of the Holy Ghost is not enough to change your situation and it doesn't matter what gift you've been given how much of the Holy Ghost you have God can change your life he can change we can't place limits on God the the truth of the matter is is so many times thank you musicians um the truth of the matter is is so many times we limit what God can do with any amount of Holy Ghost he gives us by not yielding ourselves to his will and to his plan amen so I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be with you again this morning I certainly appreciate the uh the honor and the privilege to come and speak with you and share what's on my heart and I just pray that it's a blessing to you um I'm just going to take a very simple thought this morning so much so that I believe even our our young children should be able to follow along and understand and uh I just want to take my time and talk a little bit about forgiveness this morning um if you would turn with me to the to the gospel of Matthew in chapter 5 and I apologize up front if you're if you're going to put scriptures up on the screen I got a bunch of them so you don't don't feel bad if you can't catch them I won't have any you turn to all of them but we'll read read a few and I'll read quite a few we're going to start in Matthew chapter five and we're going to go to um verse 7. this is the the defining sermon of the ministry of Jesus Christ this is a Sermon on the Mount that's commonly referred to as the Beatitudes this uh this message that Jesus Christ gave is is the gospel it is it is a road map to the believer of what we should aspire to what what is possible in our lives uh and honestly I don't think we talk about it enough we we could never go wrong going over this or we'll start at uh verse 7 and Jesus says to the people there he says blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you amen let's just go to him in prayer once again this morning Father as we approach your word I pray Lord that you would reveal yourself to us Lord I pray that the kingdom that you preached about would come into our hearts and would be revealed through us Lord I pray that you would meet every need according to your riches in glory whether it be healing whether it be marital whether it be Financial Lord we we know that you are the god of the the impossible that you can do anything Lord we ask humbly that you would forgive us our our faults and our sins Lord we we humbly admit that we don't get it right so many times we miss the mark and Lord we just we present ourselves before you claiming the blood of Jesus Christ this morning to cover us Lord may you look upon the shed blood of your son and see that and not our sin humbly Lord we ask that you would help us to to move forward and in a way that pleases you in every area of our life Lord Deliver Us from temptation Lord in this world where the there's so many voices Lord may we hear your voice above all others Deliver Us Lord we pray for yours is the Kingdom and The Glory forever amen amen you can have your your seats this morning thank you once again for having me I I sure appreciate it you know um we just uh we love and appreciate you all and we've been friends for such a long time uh that it always feels like coming home when we're here and it is coming home in so many ways because um uh you know we're family you know we might come from uh different parts of the world different countries different nations but uh we're family you know one time they asked Jesus you know who is my neighbor you know and he said the people that are around you and these are the people that I want to surround myself with Amos I just want to like I said talk a little bit today about forgiveness you know um in the the the scripture we just read in Matthew chapter five there are two things I'd like to pull out of there today and and the first is uh blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and the second is blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of God and there's two there's there's one thing that that links these two verses together and it is the idea or the concept of forgiveness and um I find that forgiveness is one of the most difficult things for for the believer for anybody really uh to do it's it's it's hard it's not natural to Simply forgive you know many times we say we we've forgiven somebody or you know we've gone past it but um so many times we rehearse these things in our mind the hurts that we've gone to the things that we've we've experienced and and and forgiveness is is so much deeper than just saying you know I I'm not going to hold it against that person or I'm not going to let it go and I think by the Lord's uh Grace this morning we can maybe uh deepen our understanding of it um I I don't know why people don't preach on the Beatitudes more I I really don't you know people especially in the message we're used to hearing about the stature of a perfect man you know and Peter's words that he gave us but within the the Beatitudes I think we find a uh a clear picture of of not not just brotherly love and kindness and charity and Faith and Hope but we find something that's so deep that that speaks to every aspect every area of our life and then there then then Jesus goes on and tells us there's a blessing if you do this you there's you will be blessed and so I like that and I wish more people preached I was thinking about it and I I've been in the message for about 25 years now and I cannot honestly recall one time where I've sat in a sermon and uh heard a message Minister preached on the Beatitudes and I I uh that's not a condemnation of anybody maybe people just think they can't improve on what Jesus said and you certainly can't but um to me it's uh the longer the longer I uh I I'm in the word the more I'm in the word the more I'm growing the more my the spirit points me back to the words of Jesus in the attitudes and the The Compassion that he had for others and I love the Mysteries and I love the Deep things of God and and I especially love it when somebody who's you know a teacher more so than me for sure preaches it because I really enjoy it but I'm I'm I find myself being drawn more and more to the simple things that speak to our everyday and common lives and and in the in the Beatitudes we didn't read them all but we find such a depth of character that we we should all aspire to and we find a description I think of what uh Jesus said that his the people of his kingdom would be like you know if you want to find the people of God you find the people who are Meek you find the people who are peacemakers and there you'll find God and so uh just pulling this morning a little bit about uh the merciful and the peacemakers and I want to try to link them together with the with forgiveness so you bear with me as I build a foundation for this but um the mercy is always associated with forgiveness and withholding punishment in Psalms 51 David writes he says have mercy upon me o God according to the love and kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions mercy and compassion go hand in hand and mercy is the fruit of compassion and I say that because uh to be merciful it means that you are in a position of of authority a position of power right you cannot be cannot be merciful to somebody unless you are above them in some way now I don't mean like we're better than somebody or or anything like that but what the thing is is that when you are in a position of authority you are able to be merciful to people who do not deserve Mercy who do not deserve that they they deserve justice then you are able to give mercy and say I'm withholding Justice and that that's that's what God has done for us he he in a position of authority and power we have transgressed as law we deserve punishment we deserve the cross ourselves but he says no and gives Mercy the dictionary says Mercy is a noun uh it defines it as a mission performed to alleviate suffering it's a an event to be grateful for um but I would say so much so that acts of Mercy are are defining of those who follow him and he's you might say well John I'm not in a position of authority but the truth is is that you are each believer We Stand upon the authority of the of God's word and we have the power to give mercy and just become dispensers of Mercy especially to those who have wronged us the people that have heard us that we are in a we're no better than them we're no no you know not higher than them but because we stand upon God's word we're given a position of authority and power the Bible says whatsoever you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth will be loosed in heaven so we are giving power to to forgive and to have mercy upon others now in in legal terms Mercy refers to compassionate Behavior such as when a judge shows leniency or clemency this is with Grace compassion and tenderness and but I would say that Mercy is a gift given to someone who is suffering by someone acting with compassion and I'd ask you to keep that in mind because we'll come back to it to it later because many times we think of Acts of Mercy as as some Grand idea of some Grand gesture but the thing is is that when you give when you give Mercy when you give forgiveness it comes number one it comes from that position of influence that position of authority but it it acts in such a gentle way there's a gentleness that comes with Mercy that is like the gentleness of of the dove of the Holy Spirit the gentleness of Jesus Christ and mercy what it does is it makes room for others it makes room for reconciliation it makes room for peace it makes room for for people to come together and unite because we're not holding one another Hostage to our past hurts and our past wrongs that we're able to move past those things amen you know sometimes Mercy is simple and sometimes it means you know not complaining at the restaurant when you get bad service sometimes it means uh correcting someone you know and and doing it in in a way that's not coming from a uh well I'm better than you or I know more than you you know and I um you know I always pray that if I would say something that's out of line that that the the pastor or another Minister would come and correct me and say well brother John you know the you know maybe think about it this way uh you know and we have to be be willing for that type of Correction sometimes Mercy means you know you don't make it difficult for the person who's offended you to apologize sometimes you uh you have to take a step forward in the other direction amen in the book of in the Gospel Matthew just a little ways away in in chapter 18 we'll get to it in a few minutes uh Jesus tells the story of an unforgiving servant who was a receiver of mercy and then failed to extend it to to people uh that owed him we'll get to in a minute but I want to I want to capitalize on this for just a moment that the extent to which we receive Mercy is the same extent to which we should freely give it we have been given much mercy and much grace and so we should be able to freely give it to others and I think one of the best definitions of Mercy that I've ever heard is is that somebody is you're standing before somebody who needs punishment and instead of punishing them you throw them a party instead that's that's Mercy when somebody deserves absolutely 100 percent deserves punishment and you turn around and you do good for them and you bless them and you know unfortunately that's the thing that's in many of our Lives you've all experienced it we have all experienced it where people have heard us undeservedly done things against us said things about us and yet the spirit of Christ and the spirit of reconciliation the spirit of Mercy says I forgive you it's all right sometimes it means giving a person an opportunity to hurt you again think about it that you know a person has said something evil against you said something and yet a spirit of compassion a spirit of Mercy moves you towards them and says I'll offer you trust again I'll love you anyway despite this now I don't mean that you stay in abusive situations certainly not and and you know at some point you do have to walk away from some people but the spirit of Mercy says you walk away from them in the right manner that you've done everything that you can do to reconcile you've done everything that you can do to bridge the gap between you and that other person this hurts you um in in the book of Ephesians Paul says this he says with all low lilist lowliness and meekness with long-suffering for Bear one another in love and I think sometimes that's so difficult for us to do because in our human nature we want to respond to hurts we want to respond to the things that people say about us or the things that you know when people take advantage of us because we have a sense of justice but you know the thing about the merciful is the merciful or patient with the faults of others there's patience that comes with it and you realize I think at some point you come in in your Christian walk and you realize not everybody's on the same level not everybody has the same depth of understanding not everybody has made it through the steps to understand the the power of forgiveness the power of compassion and and you have to bear with people you have to you have to understand that and meet them where they're at you know and um you know people we get taken advantage of people you know uh they say things about us They you know I I often you know I think about this you know I've preached them in many places um from from the jungles to you know nice churches like this and and uh I always say well you know you did okay if you get you get invited back you know you know that people you know maybe saying God bless you that was a great sermon on your way out the door but if they don't invite you back you know there was something they didn't quite agree with and I'm just the type of person you know I'm just I I'm just I am what I am you know I'm like Popeye the Sailor Man you know I'm what you see is what you get and um you know sometimes that's abrasive to people um but there's been plenty of places I've preached at that haven't invited me back you know and and that's all right you know you just think sometimes uh well you know uh well praise the Lord we're all in together anyhow you know and and uh you know just pray that God will be with them and and you don't take offense at it but uh many many times I think you know uh people invite you to preach somewhere because they uh or a fellowship because they you know by association they're like it's a A legitimization or a you know an approval of this ministry or this gift and so you know sometimes you got to be a little bit careful but you know I've never turned down an opportunity to preach anywhere and um you know I've had I've had people tell me it's like well you shouldn't you shouldn't do this or you shouldn't maybe you know think about what uh where you're preaching at because uh you know you got to protect your gift and I I couldn't disagree with that more I I really just I can't I understand the concept of of protecting yourself by you know from Association but you know what Jesus preached everywhere he talked to everyone and he wasn't he wasn't somebody who was a respecter of persons that said well I can only go here or I can only I can only preach on a Sunday you know there's there's some ministers that won't go unless they can preach on a Sunday you know there's there's well let me get back on my notes Here last when we consider the the Staggering debt that Jesus forgave for us and the smallness of the debts others have towards us it's it's simply ungracious for us to not forgive them when God has done so much for us that we would we would not forgive others is is beyond comprehension let me play for you uh a clip from the prophet here I'm going to hold this up so hopefully the microphone catches it let me know right away if you can't hear this brother Branham talking here [Music] with purple stuff on her lips and her toenails painted the same way the little pair of these little lambara clothes and a poor old thing or hide hanging down like this on her arms arms so I guess we should paint him with a hair that was colored blue and I looked and I thought oh my two old man sat there in his summertime one of the big army Overcoat on a scarf hanging down like this saying that poor lady with a beer and one of them looked up and see everything you think the rain will hurt ourselves went to the rest room and I stood there I said God you and your Holiness how could you ever stand to look at that when it kills me to look at I said why don't you scrap the thing off the Earth don't let it you're no longer I said my little Sarah Rebecca there had to be raised up and such as that I said God strike it from the earth you're holy how can you do it something said to me get behind the door I went back behind the door stood there I'll wait a little bit of vision come I saw a world turning and around the world was a myth that looked like blood spraying around and I looked in there there I was doing things wrong every time I do something wrong my sins and start before God and God would slay me for it but Jesus is standing there like a broker he'd call it I'd see the tears run down his cheeks and I do something else bad is right but hold it keep it from from touching me from killing me God would kill me the daily the other day you die and I'll look at it and then the vision I went up to him I said Lord I'm ashamed of myself they'll leave my book laying there at all kinds of evil Rhode Island I said will you forgive me Lord did I put you in that condition that my sins cause you to have to die for me all I am please forgive me for my sins I won't do that no more you reach back tapped his hand like this and wrote across the book with his own blood pardon throw the door behind him then he did he opened up a new book I said Thank You Lord I'll do anything you tell me to do I love you Lord Jesus he said now I freely forgive you for all that you've done and then he turned and I've seen the woman said but you want to strike her off the face of the Earth oh I felt about that being I said forgive me Lord when the vision left me I walked out to the little table where she was at and I said how do you do and she looked up she was half drunk she hiccup the couple times said oh hell on and I said may I sit down she said thank you I have company I said I didn't mean it in that way I just hate to say a word to you and she said say on and I sat down I said how long you've been leading this life she looked over at me and poor old thing and I thought mine no matter what how what she's went through and I told her what happened I said you pardon me she said are you that Minister down here Mr Brandon this is I said I am she said sir she said my husband was a preacher she said after he is dead I have two girls they're Sunday school teachers both of them and she told me the story what happened the way she's leading she said I'm past hope I said no you're not no you're not she said I want to straighten up but she said I have no place to start I said what right now God showed me behind the door that Vision there we want to strike you open he said he forgive me and I want to condemn you ladies forgive me there she took a hold of my hands I let her right out of them little shorts on right in the middle of that floor like I didn't knelt down and we had a real prayer meeting there when I got two people were crying walk around there okay well wow wow so many times in in our humanist we look at others and we we somehow put ourselves above them you know and I I understand that sometimes when we're when we deal with people who know truth and they they they know God in they still hurt us you know like sometimes we think to ourselves you know but that person is a Christian you know that person is a Believer you know and so we want to have less Grace for them because they know truth but the truth of the matter is is that those are the people we should have the most Grace for those are the people that we should have the most understanding the most compassion for that they're not as far along the track as they ought to be uh and we ought to pray for those people Paul tells us in Ephesians 4 and 32 he says Be Kind one to another that's not being kind to the world that's not being kind to the uh people necessarily that you run into but he's talking about the church be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you in Colossians he says in chapter 3 and verse 13 He says forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against you even as Christ forgave you so also do ye you see God offers us forgiveness even when we don't ask for it he waits on us and he doesn't treat us any different because he doesn't remember our sin he treats us from with love despite what we do before we ask for forgiveness he doesn't change his thoughts about us he doesn't change his opinion of us in the in the book of Hebrews in chapter 10 he says and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more you see he doesn't even see it that bumper of blood that that brother Branham spoke of protects us when we deserve death when we deserve judgment when we deserve justice he says no Micah the prophet he said who is a god like unto thee that part of iniquity and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage who is a God Like thee that pardoneth iniquity that iniquity means who knows to do good and and does it not that's iniquity he pardons it and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his Heritage he retaineth not his anger forever because he delighteth in Mercy he will turn again and he will have compassion upon us he will he will subdue our iniquity think about that that when when you know that you have a besetting sin when you know that you have a problem when you know that you have uh something in your life that you just can't shake God says I will subdue it I will take care of it he says and he will cast their sins into the depths of the sea I just love it oh you know we said we talk about the Sea of of forgetfulness and that's where the idea comes from from Micah and he and he says that all of it's cast into the depths of the sea and it'll be remembered no more I praise God because forgiveness for me doesn't always come naturally it doesn't always come easily many times you know in the the places that I've been hurt you know I I I feel like justice should be served I feel like you know uh I didn't deserve that I didn't deserve to be spoken wrongly if I didn't deserve to be taken advantage of you know and I I want to go back to the law of Moses where it says if a man causes a blemish in his neighbor as he has done so it shall be done to him breach for breach eye for eye tooth for tooth and that's Justice a wrong for not a wrong an eye for an eye but that's not the spirit of Christ it's the justice of God to hand out not the not our Justice Peter famously asked Jesus he said Lord how off shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times and Jesus said unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until Seventy Times Seven and see there's it's not the number you know it wasn't the number that we're counting until we reached 70 times 7 but but it's the spirit of forgiveness that we are always going to forgive those who have done us wrong we're not going to hold things against them and this is the forgiveness and Jesus's response is the Forgiveness of the father uh the parable I mentioned just a few moments ago I'll go ahead and read it Matthew 18. Jesus tells this Parable he says therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a servant or unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and I think this this Parable goes so beautifully with the uh the clip of brother random that we just listened to and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents and for as much as he had not to pay the Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children all that he had and payment to be made and the servant fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all and the Lord that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred Pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me what thou host you know so many times I I find I find myself in my human nature that that's my reaction when somebody has hurt me when somebody's done me wrong is I want to go and take them by the throat and say you know you're wrong it's not it's not I don't want to take them by the shoulders and hug them and forgive them and I pray Lord help me amen but uh the his fellow servant fell down on his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay thee all and he would not but he went and he cast him into prison until he should pay his debt when his fellow servants saw what was done you see people watch us people watch us and see what we're doing you know there's nothing that we we do that is hid in a corner everything will be brought to the light especially if you're a child of God you can't you can't go around doing the wrong thing it'll catch up with you God will God will bring a recompense if you do the wrong things to bring you back in line with his word you can go a long time you can go an awful long time in in doing the wrong thing but at some point God will bring it bring you back into line and I you don't want to get spanked by the Lord uh then as Lord after he called unto him said oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desires me should us not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on thee and his Lord was angry his Roth and he delivered into the tormentors till he should pay all that was doing and then Jesus says so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses notice it needs to be from the heart that forgiveness has to come from the heart forgiveness can't be just lip service and you know you know in yourself when you're you're forgiving with lip service because it all gets rehearsed in your head every time you go to bed you wake up and you think about things uh in The Book of Leviticus in chapter 19 it says Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon him thou shall not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself now maybe today I'm talking to people who don't have a problem with this maybe today you know I'm I'm preaching more at myself as I was I was talking to to our pastor on the on the trip here to church you know I I or maybe it was at breakfast this morning you know I told him I said you know I'm in a situation with somebody and I know that eventually we're going to part ways I I know that I but I said you know right now there's something between us and I said before we part ways I want us to be reconciled you know I don't want to part ways under under uh bad feelings towards one another or you know and my prayer is Lord you know in every situation don't ever let me part ways with somebody one of your children without being just as as right with that person as I can be you know because I believe that Jesus is most concerned with our Inner Man you know he he's interested in our heart he's interested in the condition of our heart and the spirit we have and his kingdom is a Kingdom built upon forgiveness from the if you read the Bible it is from the time where uh the sin and the fall original fall everything is built to forgiveness to forgiveness of of as many as could be saved as many you know and so why would we withhold forgiveness if anything if there should be any Hallmark of the Christian experience it should be our willingness to forgive others what they have done to us like I said so many times though unfortunately forgiveness doesn't come easy uh more often than not it doesn't come completely or fully many times we we forgive but we hold the hurt in our hearts and the next time that person offends us we we go back through the litany well they did this and they did that and they've done this and you know and it's just this is all adding up you know and we hear the the phrase forgive and forget and unfortunately I don't think that forgiveness and and forgetting are are necessarily I don't think it's possible necessarily to forget unless you got bad memory you know we're always going to remember what someone has done it we shouldn't feel like you have to forget like oh if I don't forget I'm a bad person because the things that we endure the the experiences that we have where where we are hurt are one of the greatest tools for molding our character you would not be the person you are today without the hurt and pain that you've went through in the past you would not be the person that you are today if you didn't forgive yourself of the hurt that you've caused others and if you've gone through life up to now thinking that you've never hurt anyone if you've gone through life up to now and it never occurred to you that at some point I might be the problem in this relationship then I I humbly say you're wrong I don't I don't I don't know your lives but there is not one of us who has never caused defense to another there's not one of us who has who has never crushed the spirit of her child I I tell you what I it is it is heartbreaking to me and I see my son 10 years old right and I I speak she he so sometimes he's so very sensitive in his spirit and I speak a little bit too sharply to him and I see this look cross his face and it's it's hurt and you know I it breaks my heart you know that I did that and I and I you know quick to try to apologize and to say oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to say it that sharp but there's been plenty of times in the past where I've said things to to my other children or to my wife and I didn't realize that I was the problem and there's many times that we do things and we think that well you know I was right I was justified in my anger I was justified in speaking sharply because they should have known better I was I'm justified in treating this person this way because I'm in the position of authority and so that I can dispense Justice instead of being merciful because Mercy says I'm in a position of power and authority I'm not going to take you to task I'm not going to hold you to account I'm not going to keep this against you and so we learn by the things that we suffer just as Jesus did you know we're we go through life we're going to be hurt but we have to learn to move past that we have to learn to move past the hurt that we've caused others and for forgive ourselves we're certainly not the person that we want to be you know but hopefully as we we walk with the Lord that we're not the person we we were five years ago and it's a shame sometimes you know when I talk to people I that you know they tell me that their children are you know uh live five hours away from them they never see them and then you get to digging a little bit and you find out that the the kids and the parents you know they they just had a relationship where they didn't match they didn't mix and and things children were hurt and parents were hurt and there's no reconciliation I think that's one of the worst things in the world for children to be uh so hurt that they can't be around their parents anymore I don't mean that we let people just abuse us and walk all over us but what I do mean is that if we can offer Mercy we should offer it if we can extend compassion we should extend compassion because I'll tell you a secret forgiveness is not about what it does for the other person so much as what it does for you you see many times people cause offense in the end and we get upset and we walk around and we're thinking about it and we're just you know we go to bed thinking about it we wake up thinking about it we wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it and we think about all the the history of it you know and and we get real historical and it's like they did this they said that and then I said this and we go through it you know and and we hold that person hostage in our mind I'm not going to forgive them I'm going to let them know that you know by my attitude by how I treat them that they hurt me that they they've done they've done me wrong and they need to recognize you know or maybe it's just me maybe I'm the only one who ever does that but I tell you that person more than likely has already gone on they don't unfortunately many times people don't care that they've hurt you many times people don't care about the things that they've said they're they don't think anything else about it even if they know that they hurt you unfortunately many times they they they just move on with their lives and here we are stuck for for weeks or months or years thinking about how somebody has treated us when we finally forgive that per it has nothing to do with that person it has to do with us and letting go of things and so I would encourage you this this morning you know if there are things in your life that that are always coming up things that you think about over and over and over that you've not been able to get past I would I would I would suggest to you that perhaps you've not forgiven because it's a little bit like the church bell we have up there in the tower if we go and we send one of the children back there to to ring the bell this this is kind of a little bit like forgiveness when you when you forgive somebody you you ring the bell you hear the ding the dong the ding the dong and that's us rehearsing the hurt in our mind it goes back and forth but when we forgive just like that Bell gradually it goes away it slows we stop thinking about it so much we get over it until it's done and we've released it now unfortunately you know if it if you're if the pain and things in your life are like that Bell and they're still ringing and you still wake up and you're still thinking about things and every time you see someone or or you talk to someone and they mention this person I mentioned that and you can't let go of things it's because you've not truly forgiven in your heart I say Lord help us because I say Lord help me because you know I I'm real good at holding grudges believe me I wish I wasn't I wish I could sit here and tell you that I have no problem with forgiveness I have I have no problem with uh letting things go and I can just forget them but unfortunately that's that's not me it's not my nature I I hold on to things and um I I testify this this morning this sermon is probably not for you this sermon is probably for me uh because I need to forgive I need to be able to let things go I need to be able to to to to look at somebody and shake their hand and hug them around the neck and not have things in my mind that that why did they treat me this way why did they behave in this manner towards me why have they done this this thing I need to be able to let it go and so my prayer is God help me to exhibit Mercy to that person help me to it doesn't matter if they're a Believer it doesn't matter if there's somebody on the job side it doesn't matter who they are let me exhibit mercy and compassion because I mean honestly you know I don't know there I don't know their situation I don't know why they why they did something the way they did it I don't know why they said the things that they said you know I I want to believe that most people are good-hearted people that that most people don't walk around just being curmudgeonly and and and just trying to offend people you know I think many times people offend us and that they don't even they didn't mean to you know but we can take things and you know because of our complexes and because of our past experiences and we can take and run with something and hold on to it and and make some make a mountain out of out of a molehill amen many times the people who hurt us the most are the the ones that we most deeply care for the people we look up to the people we expect you know that well they would never do such a such a thing and unfortunately the one of the most sad things the relationships that we have the longest are some of the relationships that we most quickly throw away over not forgiving because we aren't peacemakers because we're not merciful Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God and you cannot be a peacemaker unless you are well-versed in forgiveness you know I I wonder sometimes you know like I said not many ministers preach on the Beatitudes not many ministers take this type of a subject we're often a lot more comfortable talking about godhead or serpent seed or this Doctrine or this Mercy or this you know Revelation and and don't want to get into the weeds of how we live our lives and how we become more like the God we serve and I was thinking about this you know as I was reading uh this this blessed are The Peacemaker and so what what is my conception of a peacemaker what do I think this what do I think this means how do I apply this in my life is it is it me mediating between my children and arguing over you know if they're arguing over toy and I'm like no well you can share it and you can you can have 10 minutes playing with it then you can have 10 minutes you know that's kind of like the uh one of the most basic ideas of of peacemaking but then you have the example of what brother Branham did in that clip I pray played for you where as a peacemaker he's reconciling someone to God that he took on the role of a intercessory role for someone and and and then move them into a right relationship and part of being a peacemaker in our lives when we talk about forgiveness is to be able to when when somebody has ought against you and they recognize it and you and you are butting heads that you come together and you make peace so that that person can be right with God because when you have ought against your brother or you have ought against your wife or you have ought against somebody at work you you can't be right with God when you hold it in your heart and peacemaking is is not the absence of conflict it's not the avoidance of strife or or say you know appeasement you know peace at any any price and I think many times as a husband a young husband I fell into this you know you and we almost make a joke of it though yes dear Yes dear you know because we we don't want to get into an argument with the with our spouse but that's not peacemaking that's just avoidance we're just avoiding the issue we're avoiding talking about it peacemakers are the ones who reconcile things and Jesus teaches us he says in in Matthew in another place he says moreover If thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone and if he shall hear thee thou has gain thy brother that's the point that's the point of of going and confronting someone that's the point of of of saying hey you hurt me is because you want to gain your brother you want to be reconciled you want to be in a right relationship with the people that surround you Jesus goes on he says but if you will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established and honestly I'll tell you I think this is probably one of the most ignored versus the one of the most ignored things in the Bible by by anybody message Believers included I know because every time that I've exercised this scripture and done what the Lord commands people get nervous what are you doing what's your agenda what's your what's the point what are you trying to do you know and people get all nervous about it and the point is is I want I want there to be nothing between us I don't I don't you know but people aren't used to it they're not used to that type of thing and that's a shame that's a that's a real shame that in the the ranks of the church when you go to your brother and to try to to gain them that they get nervous and scared and wondering what on Earth you're doing standing at their door um you see the witnesses aren't there the witnesses aren't there as Witnesses of what the Act was done necessarily they're not Witnesses it's not that you went and told them what was done and so now they're Witnesses against their brother but what they are there is to prove that you are doing something out of pure motive and a pure heart in your and to help you to to try to reconcile and and then you know Jesus says if they neglect to hear the witnesses tell it to the church and if you neglect to hear the church it's reconciliation reconciliation we're doing everything that we can finally you know that we can do to reconcile and if the person won't reconcile kick him out of the church wow nobody wants to read that scripture you know because you know in the simplest the simplest way what a trespass against you what is a trespass because we consider all kinds of things trespasses somebody doesn't greet us on the way in a church somebody doesn't call us when we're sick somebody you know looks at looks at us a little funny and we we hold that against them that's the trespass you make it the trespass and if we go strictly by what Jesus Christ commanded and we we should go and make that right and if you go to somebody who's done that and then they you know are done done something to us and they won't make it right can you imagine going through the steps where if they won't reconcile over such a small thing that you would kick them out of the church but see the church that that the kingdom of God that Jesus Christ is building is one of unity and Oneness people will hurt us offenses will come but we must be reconciled to one another Jesus says what he's saying here is give multiple multiple opportunities to reconcile and if you don't succeed try try try again amen it's ironic that that peacemaking is some of the most difficult and messy emotional work that you can do it takes time it takes emotional energy it's like when you are I know some of you like to go uh camping and out there in the in the the bush and it's like when you're trying to cross a creek on slippery rocks you know you got to get to the other side but the it's risky you know you can slip you can fall you can hurt yourself you get you get bruised sometimes you don't make it across the stream on the first try but when you make it across the stream You've Won your brother and say well I've done everything I can do I've made tried to make things right and at some point you're right at some point when you've done all that you can do sometimes you just have to walk away from it and you have to let it go and Paul tells us that in the Book of Romans in chapters 12 he says as much lieth in you as much as life in you he says if it be possible as much as life in you live peaceably with all men you know because there comes a point when you do have to separate you do have to part ways because of disagreement but that shouldn't be because of our lack of willingness to reconcile it shouldn't be because of our lack of of desire to bring unity in the body you know sometimes there's there are people you just you have to just say I agree to disagree you know and but you know what when you agree to disagree do it agreeably you walk away loving one another and being Brothers amen so we have a god-given a scripturally directed responsibility to pursue peace Paul says in Corinthians 7 15 that God has called you to peace sometimes we we disagree but the spirit of a peacemaker is one of a bridge builder to it doesn't matter what we've disagreed on we're still Brothers we're still fighting for one another we're still in this together you know the truth is and I I say this and I'm careful to say it because it can almost sound denominational you know that uh the truth is is we have more to unite around than we do to divide over and that's that's just that's the real truth of the matter you can see you know denominational churches will unite around that that ecumenical movement well we all believe in Jesus we all believe the Trinity we all believe this stuff and so we're brothers you know under the Catholic Church even you know the the daughters we came out from her but within the message there's more that we we agree on than what we disagree on you know and I find that the things that we often that we do disagree on are just plain silly and they don't matter that it's just somebody's opinion or their interpretation and you can agree on 99 things and then separate over the one and ought not to be right amen so we got to build those bridges yeah so as I'm winding down here let's let me uh I know I'm not going to get through all my notes but let me hurry along and uh let's talk about how we can do this when when you've been hurt how do you build the bridges how do you forgive and the first thing we should do is talk to God about it the first thing we should do is talk to him I find that when I have something where there's a division between me and a brother that if I go and I pray to God about it it gives me tenderness towards that person it forces me to have a change in perspective because you know it's one thing to go to God and complain and and rehearse you know like he hasn't heard you rehearse in your mind a hundred times before you actually go and pray about it like he didn't know about it from the beginning anyway but what it does is it gives it gives him the opportunity to speak to you in a quill and a still and quiet moment and I find that that many times the Lord shows me that that is my attitude or my behavior that's hindering the reconciliation I told you I'm very good at holding grudges I I wasn't lying or being facetious it's just just our nature my family we we hold grudges and um well I I don't have the time to tell you but family goes away I I didn't meet my grandmother on my dad's side even though she raised my dad for most of his life I didn't meet her until I was about 13 years old because of grudges hurts their their family in my family that you know they get got to arguing at different points in their life that that we haven't seen in years that's sad it's sad but I say that to tell you you know that that holding on to things causes a division that ought not to be and and Jesus is very clear on the next on the next step towards the path of forgiveness is to take take the first step he says Jesus says so if you are offering your gift on the Altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you see if you know that you've done something against your brother the expectation is that you've already gone and apologized but if you remember that your brother has done something to you leave your gift there in front of the altar first go and be reconciled with your brother and then then come and offer your gift probably another one of the more ignored Commandments that Jesus has given us probably the most ignored see we're to make the first move we have to take the initiative and and forgiveness even when we're the offended party help me to live that I say Lord help me help me to live this verse conflict and division is never resolved accidentally people don't don't argue you don't bust and fight or have have issues and then wake up one day and it just magically has all disappeared reconciliation takes worth sometimes maybe it's a letter sometimes maybe it's a phone call sometimes you're visiting someone's house but we we're called to take action if we're at fault we're called to take action if our brother's at fault we're called to take action that's just as straight as it can get so when you talk to talk to the other person uh and what I'm trying to do here is just give you steps towards reconciliation how do you do this there's a process that that'll help you through this remember the words of Solomon in Proverbs 15 a gentle answer turns away anger but a harsh word stirs up Wrath remember the words of Jesus the meek shall inherit the earth and you go to someone in meekness and humility and you you work through something Paul wrote in Ephesians 4 29 he said let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers that's that Mercy I'm talking about that we go we go to someone and we we tell the truth we don't look you know sometimes sometimes it's okay to be truthful with people when they've hurt you and sometimes it's okay to tell them you did this it made me feel this way sometimes it's okay to to go to people and not withhold things the more you withhold the more you keep in your heart and we should put it all out there so you can go to somebody and you can empathize with them you can consider their situation and you can cooperate together to try to come to some sort of an agreement and I would say this that this the attitude to keep in the in reconciliation is is that the act of coming together and reconciling is more crucial than you being right you know I I sometimes I have to come and I have to approach a problem and say you know it doesn't matter if I'm right I might believe I'm I'm right but you know but what is more critical is that the relationship is restored amen and then lastly stop talking about the people who have hurt you to other people there's a there's a old Spanish proverb that says whoever gossips to you will gossip of you and I I can thankfully say that there's one area in my life I've never had a problem with I detest gossip it is it is no wonder that the Bible tells us you know talking about the tongue because it all it does is undermine somebody in your in your view in your eyes when you talk about somebody and sometimes I I get it sometimes you have to have somebody to talk to you know you have to have a friend that you can confide in but when you go and you talk to people and the and the aim is oh did you hear oh did you hear what this person did well I never and the goal of then is it is it like some sort of reconciliation you know and then you get the real gossipers at the end of it oh well we just need to pray for that person they just need more of the Holy Ghost because they must not have enough and we sit there and and talk about people amen let me see what I can skip here because I'm I'm winding down no one can become a peacemaker until they have found peace themselves we cannot give others what's not real to us and peacemaking begins with the experience of peace in our own hearts Paul the Apostle begins all of his letters he says Grace and peace to you from God our father in the Lord Jesus Christ we have to experience the grace of God before we can experience the peace of God we have to come into a relationship with God through Jesus before we can really truly be givers of peace we have to know peace within ourselves before we can make peace in our relationships and as I said earlier a few moments ago self-forgiveness is just as important as forgiving others I don't know if you're like me at all but there there are things in my life things that I've done that you know I've gone and I've tried to make right you know and I asked for forgiveness and been forgiven but I still feel shame over it you know I still feel regret and remorse that I ever did something like that and and if we're not careful we can allow that the devil to beat that drum in our ear saying you're not worthy you're not worthy if you're a Christian if you had the Holy Ghost you would have never done that in the first place you would have never thought that you would have never said that it is sometimes it's difficult to to understand but there's not a single person in the history of this world has not ever made a mistake except except for Jesus amen if you if your mind keeps turning over what has happened like a washing machine machine stuck in the cycle remember sometimes you need to unplug the washing machine and we've all experienced the grace of God and and his forgiveness in our lives Lord help us to to forgive others Lord help us to to reach out to those who have offended us not wait for them to do it whether it's our children whether it's our a loved one a relative or or somebody that we work with or let let our testimony be that that we've done all that we can do to reconcile our relationships with people many many many of us the the life that we lead is the the most somebody will ever interact with Christianity and with the Lord Jesus Christ help us to have the the right kind of testimony amen that's that's what I want in my life amen let's let's stand here this uh morning as we we wind wind this up like I said I just wanted to take a very simple thought this morning but yet we find in the Simplicity the the words of Jesus Christ that there's a whole lot more to it that there's there's a much more to being merciful being a peacemaker than just the the words on the page it's it's an attitude it's a way of life amen let's bow our heads father thank you first of all for the the gift of your son Jesus Christ who died to reconcile man to God thank you for the shed blood of Calvary that cleanses us from all sin and all iniquity thank you Lord that we can stand before you today covered by that blood and ask for forgiveness of our sin Lord I pray for each one here this morning each person who would hear this simple thought that if there there is a relationship that should be restored if there's hurt in their heart Lord that you would help them that you would give them a spirit of reconciliation a spirit of a peacemaker that they could extend Mercy that they could bridge the gap help us Lord to to be pure written Epistles rid of all men a testimony of your forgiveness because we forgive others don't let us be estranged from our brothers and sisters let us let us be United around your word Lord bless each one I pray and we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ Our Savior amen amen well thank you friends for for bearing with me this morning I know you know many times we come to church and we want to we want to be built up because we you know but I believe that some sometimes simple teaching like this can encourage Us in ways you know that that we need and if it gets us a little bit further down the path that's all we're here for you know if I could say something that will help you I fellowship with you and and you say something that helps me that's that's what it's all about amen brother Dale Pastor why don't you come thank you again for having me for the opportunity we sure love you and appreciate you if there's anything that we can ever do for you you just let me know be happy to pray with you pray for you and God bless you come on Pastor thank you I was thinking of the scripture where Jesus said you know if you forgive not your brother you know that I I won't be able to forgive you amen and think of how much God's forgiven us for and normally those things between each other are just little specks in comparison to the the mountain with snow on it that God forgave me of God help me amen amen beautiful if you know the Bible says if your heart doesn't condemn you you think of when the prophet went to pray he just done one little tiny thing wrong he said leave it and take care of this and then so good I mean let's sing that song Lord my heart can grow so far away far far you start going down that road you'll get so far from God still seeing you loved you Lord Jesus [Music] and yet for me your love it's exactly the same Hallelujah Lord I bet my knees [Music] thee my head bow down in reverence to your name I live your name yeah Hallelujah [Music] The Great I Am Hallelujah the reasons [Music] [Music] Lord I've

Ghost Lord thank you that we can rest in your forgiveness [Music] thank you Jesus Blessed Be Your Name Hallelujah he's wonderful thank you Lord Jesus we love you all it's just a beautiful message you know you need to think on these things you know even the little kids you know things you do now Satan will try to apply it against you Satan is a liar and he'll tell you it don't matter and then you'll see then he'll come back and he'll turn the tables and say you're not worthy to be a Christian because you did what I taught you to do and just make that right you'll make it right the peace that passes beyond all comprehension it's worth it I went back different times and wow just it's so beautiful amen that God can work through your life because there's nothing between you and your brother or sister or even a total somebody work or anything amen God help us Our Testimony what we say wow that's very very good very very good just uh some announcements for when we're gone to Uganda
