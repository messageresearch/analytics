========================================

the flood with Noah to make to make sacrifices and we know that uh uh that that sacrifice was there from the beginning that the blood came because we had to be uh completely covered Abel's sacrifice was was by Revelation amen that he understood that that by Revelation that there was a sin a blood sin that had happened and blood must be shed to cover it to atone for it and so when he he made that sacrifice it's very interesting that it says that he went before God him and Abel went before God like the the the presence of God right there wherever it was right there at the stepped out from behind the the the the gate there and pushed the the cherubim with the Flaming sword aside and he he was ready to accept their sacrifice think about that and and so you know Abel sacrifices and he and he you know imagine he he took the sharp Rock and he just started whacking the throats of those those lambs and you know all the bleeding and the blood and you know like in in our mind in our thinking our way of thinking we say how horrible is that is that how a terrible you know and then comes up and he makes his sacrifice of of all the things that he had got from the earth and the the fruits and the the harvest and everything else and and God looks at one and looks at the other and he says I'll have respect towards the shed of blood because in his Mind's Eye there was always a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and so he knew that by re able knew and by God knew that he was right on track amen that this was speaking of things to come and then when Cain rose up and slew Abel that uh God comes down and he to Cain and Cain's in the field and he you know Cain is saying well where's God says well where's your brother and he said am I am my ael's keeper think about that to be able to lie to God directly to his face you know I I wonder how common God had become to to Abel and Cain uh and to to be able to to for Cain to be able to have days and look him in his face and lie to him wow wow and I think you know it's very easy I think it's very easy for us who have been around the word and been around the message for years and we can let this become a little bit too common to us amen we can let it become a little too common where we we we don't respect it enough we don't respect that these are the words of God from a prophet in our day amen amen so uh you know and know God says uh you know your brother's the ground it had a voice it spoke to God and it spoke it God heard that voice and there was a voice in the blood and and and you know it's it's it's interesting that that Cain couldn't hear that voice Cain couldn't hear hear it but God saw it and he understood it he heard it with his ears and he he uh he understood the the significance of it that this this shedding of blood and this this murder that and he began to to to curse Cain and he and that was driven away and and everything and I think that if Cain would have understood that that what the blood would do he would have never spilled Abel's blood he would have never committed murder if he had realized the voice of the blood in Abel he would have never have done it because that you know it went straight to God's ears as soon as it happened amen and that was because in Cain or I'm sorry within Abel within that blood there was a life in the blood amen and not the CH not the physical chemistry of the blood but within the BL life belongs to God and it goes back to God Amen so whenever that's spilled into the ground it carries what have you done the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground uh and Abel's blood carry that loud message and it's amazing I thought about this as I was studying that we we consider our inner thoughts know we believe that our inner thoughts speak more loudly in heaven than the the things that we say out of our mouth amen that that the Throne of God God hears the things that we say amen I wonder how much more loudly the blood spoke when it was spilled on the ground cuz he didn't wait around did he he came right away right away to to confront Cain and it it Abel's blood I think expressed more than just a um what had happened but I think it had a voice that cried out for uh the the the separation of Brotherhood I think it had a voice that cried out that this was wrong that it was it was evil and and that something bad had happened that that it wasn't just a crying out because you cut your finger and the blood grow goes on to the ground but this spoke of something so significant so significant that it carried a message this carries on all the way through the Old Testament and we'll we'll talk a little bit about it as we go go along um some times we wonder it's like how can we do this how can we put our how can we place ourselves under the token how can we be the ones that are able to uh to live this kind of a life we can't do it on our own none of us none of us are able to to take and place ourselves positionally under the blood and and live a perfect life you know as I said that we we are in carnal bodies and we fall and and I don't know about you maybe some of you are perfect but I I sin every day and I don't want to sin that's not in my heart to sin but I do it every day you know uh brother Brandon once told Brother Perry green uh that brother brandom lives so close to God that just about everything that brother Perry did was sin think about that you know we're living the the best kind of life we know how but we constantly break God's laws amen we constantly do it and and that's why we have to to plead the blood and and amen do it on our own and it's it's very interesting in God came to Abraham and he he spoke with Abraham and he was giving them a promise of of of the land and what would come and he told Abraham to gather up certain animals and to to line them up and tear them apart and to make a path and back in those old days when would would come together and they would make an agreement make a covenant with each other they would take and would line the uh they would take these animals and they would tear them apart and they would line them up where they would walk through the path of the path of the animals you know birds or or beef or or sheep or whatever it was and they would line them up on either side and the idea was that as they walked through it they were in agreement that if any if we break this Covenant may I be as these animals torn apart and torn asunder and Abraham fell into this trance and a pillar of fire came and and walked through that he walked through the midst of those torn apart animals and then walked back and Abraham never went through Abraham never went through and walked through those those line those lines of animals but God did it for him he said it doesn't matter if you can't do it if you can't keep your part of this bargain I'm going to keep it for you and so that that's think about that the the blood of Jesus Christ covers you where you can't do it on your own he knows you can't do it on your own that you don't have the the physical strength or the intellectual capacity but at the same time he says even though you can't do it I will do it through you I will make a way amen I love that because uh there there's just sometimes it's so frustrating as we live and live life where we we make the same mistakes over and over we we do the same dumb things over we say the wrong things over and over and it's like why can't I get it right why can't I get it straight but God says he'll make a way he'll make a path you don't have to worry about keeping up your that's what I'm saying God's going to keep it for you he'll make a way all the time these sacrifices the blood went onto the ground with the exception of in the levitical priesthood that some of the sometimes they would use the blood for different things like putting it on the Horn of the altar or putting it um on the the priest's earlobes or thumbs they they had some different ceremonial uses but always the blood was returned to the ground and it was always given back to God in that way the only time that I can see where common man was asked to do something with the blood other than put it back into slew a lamb and man had do something with the blood and remember the story we all know it that that they had to take his up a common weed and after they kept the lamb up and and uh fed it and played with it you know and then they took and they slew it that they had to take and paint the the blood over the doorpost and the lentil and that's the only time that I can find where man has to do something with the blood of a sacrifice every time else that life is returned to God by putting it on the ground but here we have where the life of an animal is placed positionally by a by a human being by a man placed positionally according to the design of God now hold on to this back to it is that that did this a man went through and placed the blood without without priests without the Levites without the pastor without without help from his you know somebody down the street he placed that blood for himself and for his family and his household right amen now hold on to that because that's we're going to come back to it he said this blood will be a token for you it'll be a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you amen so there was something that man had to do with this blood and I and we we use that today in the terminology the message we call the applying the blood the token where we talk about uh you know cleaning up our houses and and kicking out the trash and and renewing our faith and staying close to God and not acting like the world and not loving the things of the world we say that that's we're applying the token and that's good and wonderful but I want to show you through scripture and I want to show you in in the uh some things that brother brandham said that we can do more with that blood than apply it to our own lives Leviticus 1711 just to as I'm kind of talking here and and going through some of these scriptures and rehearsing and bear with me Leviticus 17711 says for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life it wasn't the blood remember it wasn't just the the red blood that would flow out that would coagulate upon the ground but it was the life that was in the blood the life is what's important amen amen uh and this this tells us how sacred blood is in the relationship between life and atonement it serves as a foundation for so many different things within the Bible all the way from the coaster laws you know where where the when you start talking about the the laws of Moses say you will not eat blood you will not eat certain things and it all has to tie back to this concept that the life of an animal belongs to God it is not yours to consume it has to be returned to God by being put placed in the ground okay and so this concept it all speaks of something that we'll that we can trace all throughout scriptures and and just give me as I as I'm doing this I'm trying to take my time and so the blood was the blood was used uh to sprinkle The Mercy Seat and it was on the horns of the altar it was used in different ways by the priest but but anytime otherwise that an animal was but butchered that that blood had to be returned to the ground and even on the on the altars and even on the sacrifices upon the Temple mount the the Waters of the guihan Springs would Bubble Up and it would wash the blood away down into the valley of jezrael and into the into the waste and everything to return all that to the Earth it didn't just stick stick around it all had to go back into the Earth and Jesus as I was saying earlier referred to this is uh or maybe I didn't already but Jesus is talking to his followers I think brother Dell you and I were talking about this he says except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you amen and that was such a hard thing for the for the people who were following to him to to hear because all their life they've been taught you don't drink the blood you don't eat the the the Flesh of certain sacrifices you you cannot do that that is just wrong you your soul will be cut off from God if you do this and so then Jesus comes along and he says unless you eat eat my flesh and drink my blood and it's so opposite of everything that they had ever heard and it's funny how how God will talk about opposites and he'll say one thing over here and he'll say one thing over here and they just seem like total opposites you see that in brother brandom's Ministry we'll say one thing over here and then he says another another thing over here and and they're they're completely opposite amen but God has a purpose in that amen amen it's not it's not just Idol words is to help us keep balanc in the middle amen so whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life you cannot have eternal life without this Blood amen because the life is in the blood amen that's right whoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed and he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwells in me and I in him amen I think sometimes it's real easy to scrip to skip over scriptures like this and not really grasp the entire concept of what we're talking about that when we that when we consume Christ when we consume the word when we are placed positionally under the word that his life is actually within us that's right we we dwell in him and he dwells in us it's not just a casual relationship this is a this is an intimate relationship this is this is a family this is the firstborn of many Brethren being with us this is his life coming and living and being expressed through the believer amen and so you know many of the followers left after that it was just too hard for them to hear but Jesus knew what he was talking about right he knew that that some things call cause separation and he set them on purpose right amen but even the things that he said to cause separation and division had types and shadows that would live forever it wasn't just uh I'm going to be rude to people and they're going to walk away it was no this is the word is it's very interesting oh I don't know if I should say it I don't know I should say it or not you know a lot of people want to believe that brother brandham that everything he said is thus sayith the Lord and and they want to say you know everything that brother Bram said is just like the word of God and every all of it is just scripture and scriptural Doctrine and everything and they don't let brother Brandon be a man right and so then what do you do when you have brother random say one thing over here and then on the other side say something completely totally different you you can't do that you know one thing for sure is is when brother brandom said things in the name of the Lord he said thus sayith the Lord and that was a man speaking the words of God but when Jesus and people want to make brother brandom God Like Jesus and say but but when Jesus said he said I say unto you I say unto you brother brandom never said I say unto you he said thus sayith the Lord and we cannot we can't make brother brandom into some sort of deity I hope that's okay amen we're saved by the life the the wages of sin or death but the sacrifice of Christ reconciles us back to God but more than that we're saved by his life not the life that he lived but the life that he returned to God amen amen it it wasn't just he that he went to the Cross he could have got off the cross he could have bled just a little bit you know and I think about it that the very blood Christ is so powerful meant so much to God the very life of God that I can imagine as as Jesus went to the the hul and the and the scourging that the very first time the you know they they drew back the and went to whip him and the blood from his back flew over here and hit the dust that would have been enough right the blood had been shed that would have been enough to redeem everything and everyone but God in his plan said no all the life has to be drained from him all of his life all that is in me in him has to go back into the ground so that I can then give it to my people the [Applause] church thank you Lord thank you Jes I I I thought about that the other night you know that that that just that seen in my head I couldn't get it out of it you know I just imagine that that that as as things were happening all the Angels were just watching what was happening they knew this was the son of God and as soon as they saw that whip you know they just so they don't no we're going to get them we we're going to take these Romans out you know and they look back to God for for the authority to do it the permission and God's got his face completely turned away right completely turned away because Jesus had become sin for us and that's the difference friends between the an animal sacrifice and and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is that the animal had no soul it had no consciousness of of sin and so its blood could never atone for sin it never could but Jesus Christ a man who knew no sin was perfect Without Blame a spotless lamb but had the capacity if he wanted to to walk away from it he could and because he didn't because he said your will not my will be done he was the perfect sacrifice amen Amen brother Brandon says in the in the token here uh that the animal life could not come back upon the human being when the blood was shed the life went out uh because it was a unit and the life's blood was gone from it the life being different from the blood and he says you know the blood is the chemistry of the life but the life is something different from the blood but the life is in the blood and the animal life could not come back upon the worshipper when he shed this Blood of the Lamb he had to apply the chemistry the life was gone and couldn't come back it could not come back upon a human being because that animal doesn't have a soul the animal doesn't realize sin and I'm I'm reading this because I don't want you to think I'm coming up with my own ideas here some of you have probably had pets that you or or cattle or a dog or a cat that just misbehaved all the time and you pretty sure that that an knew sin pretty sure they did but brother brandom said they didn't and so that that animal life could not come back upon a human being because it didn't have a soul in that life but Christ's life his blood speaks of a better thing his blood speaks of much better things than what the Abel's blood did Abel's blood cried out from the ground for for vengeance for for uh Justice for for God to to to repay this thing to make this right but when when God's blood when Jesus Christ's blood was shed upon the ground it cried out of better things it cried out and said the work is done it cried out it said it said it's finished we're not vengeance is served Justice is covered the debts been paid it C cried out that there's a Life coming upon the believer that you can't express on your own but I'll express it through you my life will go to you amen yes the the blood speaks it has a voice brother Randon he he he's talking about this concept here and he says I just I'm not sure if this is my note or his but I think it's mine I just want to say here that when Christ's blood was shed yes this is mine I I wrote it down so I would say it the voice of the life was in that was in that blood was something so powerful that it shook the Earth it shook not just the Earth but it shook the heavens as well it it shattered every Paradigm of between man and God it shattered everything that would separate man from God and we're talking literal earthquakes we're talking literal shaking of heavens and when and when he says this he says uh it goes on after he says this in Hebrews he says see that you refuse him not to speak it for they if they escaped who refused him how much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him that speaketh here's what I want to get to in this is that this voice shook the Earth and he promised saying yet more yet once more will I shake not the Earth only but also the heaven amen and what that's referring back to is the prophecy uh in the Old Testament that when this happens that the the glory of the latter house will exceed the glory of the former house the glory of this new Tabernacle will exceed the glory of the latter thank you Lord and I know a lot of us you know there's different a lot of different ways we could take that but let's just look at it for just a few seconds here is that we have a tabernacle not built by Earthly hands this that rust and moth don't Decay that that sin cannot corrupt that we have something better waiting upon us than what we have here in this flesh and it doesn't matter how young you are it doesn't matter how good a shape you're in you know once you reach to a certain age in life your body begins to corrupt and to die and you can take all the vitamins and you can take all the minerals and you can do all the right things and your time is what your time is it's a lot your body will die but when he put his life in he he wasn't talking about a physical literal Tabernacle like this but he says the glory of the latter hallah will be greater than the glory of the former what's coming what awaits you is going to be so much greater than this so much greater than this amen the glory of the latter will always exceed the former and that's the contradiction that I love that in the Bible that that so many people Miss is that God God does things in these contrasts that of opposite of what we would seem and he says you know who who would be high among you let them be the lowest the lowest shall be exalted you know the the rich you know the poor will inherit the Earth all these contrasts God makes that the the mountain down and The Valleys will be raised up amen amen because he's going to express something in this day and age with with his people amen it's not just a a a a word uh preaching I'm not just up here just spouting words and nonsense I'm not up here to entertain but I'm up here to to encourage you in the name of the Lord to realize who you are and that you are the the Bride of Jesus Christ that you are the Invincible Army that you are walking word of God Amen that you can overcome that you have placed into adoption that you are sealed by the Holy Ghost the token life amen and you are sealed until the day of your Redemption Beau thank you Lord amen because in in the old days is sacrifice after sacrifice after sacrifice but his sacrifice is one sacrifice and I think some sometimes we we we we don't fully grasp the concept here of of what God has done for us because we we think that God keeps a record like we do when things go wrong we think that God keeps some sort of a a notebook with you know all the things that you've done but when you sin and when you repent the next time you do it it's the first time that you've ever done it God God doesn't remember he doesn't keep a scorebook he said you know the s over there with his list of things that you've done they did it again they did it again I had the whole history and I had their whole Playbook and and God says they never did it in the first place and Satan's Satan's jaw just bounces off the floor he's just standing there with his mouth open [Applause] right thank you Lord you never did it how could you do it how could you do it when you're a child of God amen thank you Jesus the blood of Jesus Christ is so so powerful uh let me skip some of this here his body his blood was was created specifically for a sacrifice that's right it it it wasn't just like randomly put together you know no everything about him was designed by God to be a sacrifice he was a man that says that there was no Beauty to be found in him but I tell you one thing he was a lamb without blemish he didn't have a blemish upon him he might not have been handsome and ruggedly good-looking we don't know but I guarantee you he didn't walk around disabled or deformed or or he had to be the Spotless lamb a lamb without blemish and that just just doesn't mean like he had never sinned but he was perfect in every way if anybody could have lived forever Jesus could have lived for etal am I think I think the devil has to be so frustrated when he comes to accuse you before the Throne of God I really do he he just you know here he is the slickest lawyer and the he's got all the the records and everything else and and God every time says that he never did it he never did it you know the thing is is the devil will confuse you and and put it into your mind and into your into your heart to sin and you'll think that you thought it and you'll think that you did this right he'll convince you that when you did it you did it willingly you said brother John that's crazy of course I I did I made a choice I did something willingly so I sinned I'm telling you you cannot sin it is impossible for you to sin that is the scripture that is the word of God we just have to reach out and believe it and claim it hallelujah hallelujah we cannot sin because our seed remains in us the life of Jesus Christ is with this now okay this man this carnal flesh sins but the soul the person who you truly are the person within you the inner man it is impossible for him to sin you Lord amen the only person that can sin is the devil righten amen John 1 John 3 says whoever abideth in him in in Christ sinth not I believe that you believe that if you're in Christ you can't sin amen whosoever sinth has not seen him or known him I've I I know him I know him in the way that a a husband knows a wife he has put his seed within [Applause] me I know him him yes and he knows me and he has known me before the foundation of the worlden he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God do not commit sin that's right say it with me doth not commit sin amen doth not commit sin what do you you worried about what what what gives you so much anxiety that you might miss the Rapture what gives you so much anxiety that you don't know if you're going to make it or not and the Devil comes and Whispers In Your Ear it is impossible for you to fail it is impossible for you to be left behind all that the father has given him will come he won't lose one of us Amen in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so who can be righteous only the children of God because they are the seed of God his blood Upon Us speaks of better things amen his blood has covered us quickening that seed making us a new creature in him your old man May sin but everything inside you that belongs to him is perfect it cannot sin it cannot fail because you are a part of him and he is a part of you that's that's the whole mystery right there that's the whole mystery of God revealing himself down throughout the ages is that God in his church yes among his people revealing himself I am I will be in you until the end of the ages hallelujah amen so this this entire sacrificial system that we kind of talked about it all required blood a life for a life but his life paid the debt once and for all it redeemed man from sin for all time not just the sin that was not just the sin that was going on but every sin that would ever be and that that forgiveness some some people in the me message May disagree with me and you if you feel free to take me out back and tell me I'm wrong but some people want to say that the blood is no longer there for people to come into the to into the church and be saved Heaven Help Us Lord help us that we would we would try to keep something that's so pure so precious and try to keep it all to ourselves and not give it to the poor and the needy amen the blood still speaks you tell me when it stops speaking amen hallelujah don't you love him this morning amen when that when that blood was shed and that life went back to God it carried with it a message that the the sin debt had been paid that everything was was atoned for that that when the the the the Earth had soaked up the the blood of Jesus Christ that the very Earth itself belonged to him the Earth was completely redeemed from Satan the the every molecule that would make up a human being all the the different elements and potach and different things you know that brother Brandon talks about all those elements were redeemed for you in this in this body amen don't you don't you appreciate him yeah and let me let me let me go just even a little bit farther that if if his life has been shed return to God and then sent to you he said my life will I send you yes I will be with you even in you and his life is in you and you have heard a voice right and you have heard a voice calling you out and you've heard the voice of this message what does that make you it's right has it not been written in your law I said you are Gods if he called them Gods to whom the word of God came hallu who are we thank you Lord literal family of God no wonder brother Brandon could say we were Messiahs amen that we're anointed for a reason for a purpose you know this can't just come on random people way you're called and chosen and predestinated to this and you hear the message and you heard you've heard the word of the hour you've heard a voice speaking and you heard it because it Quicken you had the seed inside you and it quickened that seed to believe how can you sin how can you fall short brother brandham says the blood speaks of better things the blood is speaking the blood has a voice and the voice of the blood is in the word hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood and the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings it life it is life and it brings life to the word go says the Old Testament blood spoke of guilt in the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of Heaven the blood of Jesus Christ covers all our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the Redemptive blessings that that blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks amen amen praise God he goes on in in another another time when he's preaching the token and he says we must believe for ourself like they did down there in Egypt and also for the house like they did in Egypt and Jericho and so forth and he says you know I he says I got a scripture wrote here acts 1631 where the Roman Centurion was came uh was going to take his life and he was going to stab himself to death and and Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved and it's got to be a household yes that's the power of the blood and and a lot of time and that and that's powerful and wonderful amen that that that a husband a mama and a father can take the blood apply it over the doorpost and the ls kick out the garbage and claim all their children all their children we won't lose one of them I don't care how far they've gone I don't care what kind of sin they've committed I care whatever they've done it doesn't matter you know when when rahab's family was saved it doesn't say anything about them repenting it doesn't say anything about them like looking at the the armies marching around Jericho were going to be delivered no it was they came they were under the token that Ray had applied for her house and they were [Applause] saved we won't lose one of our family they'll come God's word said they'll come we have to believe him we have to him they they might do some bad decisions they might make some awful choices they might reap what they sow here on Earth but when that day comes for them to be resurrected under life or or to when push comes to shove God says I will not lose one of mine and I claim that by faith for my family I put out the scarlet cord and I apply the token in the blood I don't want filthy things in my house I my children I don't don't care what they do they are going to be children of God how can they be anything else they came from me they came from my loins I am a child of God my children are children of [Applause] God Amen you believe that token you believe that the life is in the blood amen that that the the life or the soul of that blood speaks that God is when he shed his life that his his blood is speaking better things over you I'm getting I'm getting this somewhere here and we're we're we're winding down I told you to hold things we're going to bring it all right together right now because this this life that we have is something that's so powerful so strong there are a couple things I found in brother brandom's Ministry that I want to share with you this afternoon or this morning that I don't even think brother brandom realized what he was doing or saying I was listening to the to a quote I'm going to share with you here in just a few moments and I was studying for this sermon and thinking about things and the power and the presence of God came down so strong in the room all I can do is just put my hands up weep and SOB that that God would do something and allow us to have so much power and so much Authority that we can apply the token on our fames lives but not only that that we can apply the token to other people's lives I'm going to prove it to you by by the word Amen brother brother Bram says when we pray we must have the token present with our prayers he says don't fail to get that when you pray you must have the token to hold over your prayer if you're not keep praking praying till the token comes cuz you're not promised to receive it amen see you've got to get the token first sir that's that that's where you have to do something physically with the blood right that's right amen doesn't do any good to have the message and it sits on the Shelf it sits on the Pew and you don't do anything with it it would have made no difference if they sacrificed the lamb it would have made no difference if they kept it up and they had the leevan and their loin GED and their staff in their hands if they didn't apply the blood amen there's something that we have to do with it amen amen now I'm not coming uh to you preaching some new doctrine or anything but I want to share share this with you because I think it's just so extraordinarily powerful that there's two times where seen that brother brother random did this in scripture and or or I'm sorry in in sermons and he does it so casually so casually that I don't even think that he realized the power of what he was saying now I'm not I'm not talking some new doctrine I'm just going to read to you what he said and what the effect of it was Amen brother brandom in blind barus uh he's in the prayer line the faith is very high among the people and he says do you believe that God can tell me and and he turns his his face Skyward looking up to Heavens like this what your trouble is diabetes believe go home and get well have faith he ask the next person do you believe God you know he's looking looking up in a way he says you're coughing you're asthmatic go home next person he's looking away he's not even looking at him ladies trouble all of it leaves you now go home and be well and then he something strikes in the crowd the faith level becomes so so palpable and so discernable that brother random says this he says now if you keep believing like that it won't even take discernment he said your TR next person comes up your trouble's in your back go home say thank you Lord Jesus you'll get well and be well the next person comes up and and he stops and he says now you have to have prayer because it's cancer and he prays this prayer and he he does something here that I want you to catch and this is just a couple sentences he says oh Lord I cast away this evil devil called cancer from this dying woman and I place between her and death the blood of Jesus Christ may it leave her go home rejoicing saying thank you Lord Jesus you had it all oh and he says the next person you had it also sir believe now when it left her it left you go believe me you're telling me that a man a man a man could take and apply the token to someone else's life now that wasn't that wasn't spiritual discernment he says you don't even need discernment when it's like that that wasn't thus sayith the Lord it wasn't a prophecy it wasn't something that God told him to do but by faith in the word of God and the power of of being in position and being adopted he was able to take and put the the blood the token between a woman's life and death yes and if he's the wave sheep offering then we can get there too I believe it yeah amen I I don't I don't think that he realized maybe he did maybe he did but I can't see it where anywhere else where he said it and if you ever find it you let me know because I think is just so powerful I've never seen it before he used the power of the blood of Jesus Christ and he applied the token to someone else's life and saved her from physical death Beautiful Jesus I want to I want to play a a clip for you of brother brandom testifying this is this clip is about 6 minutes long and just as I start to play it if you can't hear he it let me know and I'll adjust the microphone here so you can hopefully hear it um brother Brandon giving a testimony and we'll begin to to to close after this see I heard ring I was staying with wasn't justum in at that time to pick up the phone and I picked up the phone and answered it it is a a little Mexican missionary and he said I didn't know that if you were in town brother brand he said I uh I know that you're going to have a meeting tonight down somewhere towards the Cow Palace and he said I've got a little boy that's not yet 5 months said he's dying with cancer and said I know what not customary to do this but said could there be mercy found that you would come and pray for the little [Music] land imagine what if that was your baby and I I said I'll have Mr ARG right come to the phone and used tell me let direct him to the hospital because I don't know the city that well 400 square miles of City I'd never find the hospital Mr Argan by came he said brother brandom you I said I feel definitely lad that this is all the holy spirit so we went down to the city and there to the hospital and a Mexican brother though he wasn't dark darker than I am and a man somewhat of my age and his wife was a Finnish woman a little blonde very lovely lady and he was a gentleman and we went into the hospital and oh I see lots of sights we all do that disturb us and bring our emotions but that was one of the worst I ever seen they had to bring the little lad to the near the nurse room with the special nurse and when I looked the cancer had spread his little Jaws out so far they had put a rag around his head to keep him bursting its head open and in its Little J where the doctor had tried to cut away the cancer and made great ditches back and forth like this all the way around his little throat and it just aggravated the cancer and I'd call it that word which scattered it the right word would be and it went into its little tongue and a little baby mouth thought over that wide the little tongue had swollen and run out about that far and turned black which had shut off the air where it breathed down from its nostrils and that daddy walked around inide of this little baby and said hello Ricky the daddy's little boy Daddy brought brother brand to pray for you Ricky and the little baby recognized its father and and it did not have any uh breathing up here so they had to cut a hole in his throat there's a little it just looked like a little round whistle that we used to have years ago was in its little throat and it was catching its breath through that whistle and a nurse had to stay there all the time because the cancer drainy would let clog up this little hole and she'd have to pull it out like that the cancer drainage from the cancer and his little arms do in splints so he couldn't catch this with his hand to pull it out when it was strangling and a nurse there all the time when it starts strangling she'd reach down take things and pull the cancer stuff out of the little whistle there where come to its throat and his little hands like this reaching for its daddy his little head back and it's little well we're brothers and sisters a little diaper it wasn't little baby all together wasn't that long not yet 5 months old and that little thing recognized it Dad and he said Ricky daddy's little bo oh how just melt the heart of a Iron Man and he was trying to play with it to P it like this and I standing there I thought Lord Jesus said Thou Art the Fountain of all Cathy and all Mercy lays within you would you get joy out of seeing this little darling lay here dying like that I just can't believe and never will believe that that the and that's the will of almighty God to see such as that I thought you are the Fountain of [Music] mercy and if you be the Fountain of Mercy then how would you could you be a merciful god and enjoy seem something like that oh what would you do if you were standing here well I hope that my own little group here knows me well enough to know that if I am a fanatic I don't know it if anything I want to be as honest when I meet God I want to meet him with an honest heart but I've done the best that I know how to do but something spoke to me when I said Lord what would you do if you were standing here something spoke back that I'm waiting to see what you do and as I looked that little thing I took his little baby hand not that wide and put it in my fingers like this and held it I said by faith in God I plac between this cancer and the baby the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and just turned around and walked out the father came on with me I just couldn't say no more and I got to the car and he said brother Brandon here's a little Tidings I've been saving for I said oh merciful brother don't do that I said no I don't take money said but this is Tidings that goes to the ministry said I saved it up thought I'd see you someday I said Put it on Ricky's Little Bill in there I said he he'll need that and so I went on up to the house and within two hours from that time the little Jaws had gone back normal and T come back down in his mouth the loving mercy of a kind loving father had seen fit to heal the baby the next morning the baby was going to be sent home for a well baby it was so complete Saints it was so complete that the the the man tried to go and pay the doctor you know with th those tithes monies and the doctor wouldn't even accept it he said that's the most miraculous phenomena a phenomena I've ever seen right I don't deserve a penny I didn't have anything to do with it and I think I think it's very interesting that God spoke to brother brandham and said I'm I'm waiting for you to do something what are you going to do with the life that I've given you what are you going to do with the authority that I've given you you sit here like Moses why Christ speak you've been given power and authority over all evil over all Devils every demon in hell every sickness every Cancer every feminine problem every every mental problem every disease that You' have been given authority over it in the name of Jesus Christ you don't have to live with it you don't have to just let it hang around you don't have to just accept it that you can be delivered right now right now if you have faith and believe what are you going to do with this what are you going to do the blood speaks of better things it's speaking this morning it's speaking to your hearts it's speaking a promise of life it's speaking healing it's speaking Redemption it's speaking of better things to come amen this wasn't just for brother brandham because the same life that was in Bram is the same life that's in me it's the same life that's in you any Authority that brother brandom had for something like that is the same Authority that you have as and you don't have to like look at it like brother Brandon because the the scripture itself says that in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they shall Place hands on the sick and they shall recover it didn't say oh only the prophet can do it only the special minister in this big city you have to go to this Minister over here and he has a gift of healing that's not what the scripture says you have the authority you have the power the word has come unto you and you are him and he is you Jus amen why don't you stand with me this this morning we go down friends I just think it's so so powerful so wonderful like I said when I when I heard it it just hit me so hard all I could do is just weep maybe you don't agree with me and that's fine maybe you think I'm just being a little bit fanatical that's okay I don't mind at all I came here one time and I said I said and I felt this way so long I came here one time and a brother brother rebuked me for it and I said you know if I had the power you know if I had the healing gift of healing I would I would lay hands on each and every one of you and you'd recover and I and I'd said you know but I don't have that God told me you do God told me that you do and you do brother Jared brother Tim all of you this power is in with is in you [Music] just I'm amazed and I'm thrilled when I see how from the very dawn of creation there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and all these types and shadows all the way down all spoke of one thing that God reconciling his family back to himself and the in the Greater Works she'll do why don't you bow your heads with me this morning just play something Softly I think you know of situations that we have in our lives that we would want to apply the token to Healing salvation of our our friends or family and you know as we listen to that testimony I'm I'm certain that each one of us we thinking about situations maybe even thought boy I wish I had that I wish I could do that I don't I don't know know if that's quite right is it it sounds too good to be true wow praise God maybe you maybe you've spent countless hours in prayer over situations maybe you've you've remembered things to the Lord for your your children or your grandchildren or your loved ones for for years without something happening and I wonder if if God might be speaking to your heart today asking you what you'll do what will you do will you speak the word will you put the token will you apply it in faith the blood speaks of a better [Music] thing Lord God as we we stand here our father I'm I'm in awe of your mercy and your grace amen the power of the blood that still speaks on our behalf the power of the blood that can still speak through US Lord as I reflect on on your word and the testimony of how your blood brings healing to little babies and how it saves lives and and how we can put the blood in between death and life I'm reminded that that this sacrifice you made was for each one of us that it's it's not there's no big eyes or Little People we're all one amen we're all equal before you yes and I I know the burdens that we carry and the situations in our lives where we need the blood to be applied the healing the deliverance and Lord in my life today I acknowledge you're waiting to see what I'll do you said to me what are you going to do by Faith Lord I'm going to reach out and I'm going to claim that I'm going to apply the blood I'm going to apply the token and it's not just for my family it's not just for my household it's for every person that I'll ever pray for again it's for every situation that I'll ever see again to put the the power of the blood in the token between life and death between heartache and sorrow between depression and and suicide and thoughts in a person's life I'm going to claim that Lord and I'm going to do it the best that I know how by faith and by your grace and I believe your blood speaks of better things I cover every heart father cover every life and every situation here today and we can give you all the
