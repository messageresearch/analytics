let us father in this hour Beyond this clouds of doubts let us go beyond D clouds and let us move to where all things are possible for we want to see Jesus come Among Us and reveal yourself in the power of that Resurrection in Jesus Christ's name amen okay if you care to turn your Bible with me just turn the pages and lets uh to the book of St Luke Luke chapter 19 Luke 19 43 43 Luke 19 43 43 for the day shall come upon thee that th enemies shall cast a trench about thee and Compass thee run and kept thee in every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and the children within thee and they shall not live in the one stone upon another because th knew not the time of th visitation amen may the Lord add blessing to reading of his word you can have your seat thank you Lord you want to speak on the subject the hour of visitation the hour of visitation you are come to ch church because you have got an appointment right that is why you are here that's right you have an appointment with Jesus Christ therefore you have recognized the hour that you supposed to meet with Jesus that's why you are here yes sir amen and if you have recognized and he has made a promise and he has to meet with you and you have come then definitely something will happen you because he keeps all his appointments yes he does that's right the hour of visitation look at the scripture we read it's very sad for Israel a chosen generation a chosen Nation right that God has chosen them to make a showcase right to demonstrate his power to show his love to show his righteousness his manner of Life his conduct and they have the scripture God has spoken to them by the prophets so that they could not be in darkness and you know how they treated their prophets but however God spoke to them and they knew that there will be a coming mesiah right yes sir the scripture has explicitly it has really spoken of a coming mesiah and that coming Mah is not for anyone it he is for isra that is your king yes sir that is your God but suddenly when this King arrived when the Messiah arrived what did they do to him they call him a sinner they call him B they call him a witch they call him every name wow why they refuse to see their visitation they couldn't recognize their day sir friends and Jesus is speaking to them here you are going to suffer this you are calling my blood to come upon you and your children no stone will remain upon a stone this Solomon Temple that you are bragging that you are showing me there will be no stone upon in the stone right that's right it all come down and your enemies will come pass around you and blood will flow because you refuse to see the day of your visitation may God brother that is the word may God help us let it not happen to us any one of us yes sir to refuse our visitation as you sit there right there God has made a promise you are a child of God you are God's son you are God's daughter therefore all the benefit of Calvary belongs to you nobody can stand in your way when you are making your claim in the presence of God that's right but why what is happening what is wrong with God's children today have you forgotten our identity have you forgotten that you a child of God hey Jeremiah 8:12 he said when they ashamed when they ashamed when they had committed Abomination n they were not at all ashamed neither could they brush wow therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down see the Lord it will not be you were supposed to enjoy two visitations the first visitation is Grace the first visitation is [Applause] salvation and when you sh it when you really refuse right that visitation there is another visitation that is waiting for you and me the wrath of God that's what God is telling Israel here friends it's terrible in the Book of Luke Luke chapter 21 say verse number 20 and when he shall see Jerusalem compass with enemies then know that the disolution thereof is near then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it the part out and let not them that are in the countries enter there to for these be the days of Vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled and 24 he said and they shall fall by the edge of the SW and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be thr it down of the genti until the town of the Gentiles be fulfilled right God speaking to Israel Jesus Christ the very God they were singing they were in expectation to receive Messiah he come right into their hands they refuse him they rejected him they call him B their own god what happened to them they were B they were occupied with Traditions they were occupied with the understanding they were occupied with man's theology man's understanding and it occupied their mind until there was no room for them to reason friends the bride we have come to the same place right may God help the bride yeah can you recognize you have visitation right yes can you see him that he is coming right your way can you see him that he sit beside you can you see him that he has come to address that issue can you see him that he has come to heal you can you see that visitation sir thank you Jesus amen thank you Jesus listen and Daniel was speaking here in Daniel chapter 8 verse3 then I heard one Saint speaking and another Saint said unto that certain Saint who spake how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of the the solution to give both the sanctuary and the hor to be troen under the foot and he said unto me unto 2,300 days then then shall the sanctuary be cleans Hallelujah brother these people the sacrifice they were kill animals they were sacrificing animals unto God and they were eating meat and they were enjoying it and it became a tradition right go and when you read the book of Daniel they said no that will not happen we are really enjoying this sacrifice do you mean to tell me that this daily sacrifice will be taken away and what will be the business of the priest that is our business that makes us so unique among the people we do the sacrifice the daily sacrifice will be taken away they could not figure it out they could not understand how they are delivered they have been chosen they could not know that those sacrifices could not take away sin the the Bible said the iniquity of Jacob might be wiped away the iniquity of Jacob but any man blood couldn't do that blood of Bo and BLS could not do it so John come to introduce the lamb that they supposed to know that the daily sacrifice must be taken away and J comes but the prophet that not the prophet of all the prophets to introduce the sacrifice to introduce the Messiah Behold the Lamb of God that taking away the sins of the world you mean they didn't hear they heard it they were all at Jordan many of them were at Jordan many of them are the sacrifice that's the baptism the baptismal service they were all looking at what is happening they saw him they heard John introducing him that the when that sing me to baptize he said the one that I will baptize and the Holy Ghost will come upon him he is the Messiah he is our King and behold I testify unto you behold this man he is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the thank you Jesus has God forsaken them has God denied them no was he not on schedule was he not on time my friends they refuse their visitation they refuse the introduction John introduce him yes sir listen Zakaria also said something because there's coming a time he said and when we shall say unto him where zecharia 13:6 where are these wounds in your hands then shall he answer those with which I I was wounded in the house of my friends they could not know that Jesus Christ the Messiah what they were doing to him they couldn't really understand that they were even fulfilling scripture they were killing him for him to wipe away the sins of the world but to them they kill him as a as as an outcast a man that you must really away with him they couldn't Place him in the scripture they call him a wicked man he has come to destroy our church he has come to destroy our systems away with him but he will come again that is why Israel is in trouble they refuse him but he's coming again to show him his palm he will show Israel his palm and they will ask him where did you obtain where did you get these wounds say you are the people that did that to me like they did to Joseph they weap and cry but you say don't cry for these things you did it for me to preserve life and that is why the Gentile bride has come in that is why we have also got our place for Israel rejection has given us acceptance to accept Christ The Hour of the visitation remember when Solomon the temple right in their own glare they saw the pillar of fire the cloud coming right into the temple that even the Bible said the ministers could not even enter into the temple to minister they saw the pillar of fire they saw God coming into his Temple but on that day when they lifted the son of man the Temple ve turn from top to bottom they supposed to know that something has happened but they couldn't recognize that the temple was hanging right there yes today friends the AR of God you are carrying God's act yes sir you are God's Temple don't you know that you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost yes sir amen and we are not supposed to defile your body because it is for God that's where the ACT is sitting right now Bren the hour of visitation am listen in Jeremiah 27 21 yeah th say the Lord of host the god of Israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem they shall be carried to Babylon and they shall be they shall be until the day that I visit them say the Lord then will I bring them up and restore them in his place God because they rebel against God said God had a tool in his hand and that to was Nebuchadnezzar to punish Israel they took away the vessels the golden cups they took everything away right go golden cab sitting in the temple of God has been removed from his place because Israel refused to see their visitation Brethren but thank God he said I will restore I'll bring all this ver back in the days of n in the days of Ezra he has to bring everything back to his place place that is why the Bri is back to a place that is the restoration God has restored is back to our place back to our position back to the message back to the [Applause] Bible restoration e 1:7 also s sah the king brought forth the vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar has brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his God chapter 5:14 Ezra and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God which NE nebar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought them into the Temple of Babylon do this SOS the king take out of the Temple of Babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name of Shan Baza whom he had made governor and said unto him take these vessel go carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be built in his place amen restoration V SM be put in their rightful place again that is the Commandment God anointed Ezra the king D he has to give that command you can't stop God if God's what God's promise God's word brother there is no way you can stop it right that's right it will come to pass he used the king D he has to reinforce he enforced God's word so that the temple may be built again so that the vses may be put in their rightful places again that is what we are going through that is why we can confidently rejoice and say we are restored we are restored back to a rful place that God can see his image again he can see his reflection again on Earth you are the light of this world shining star Morning Star like the Watchman said Watchman what of the night said the night and the also the darkness this is the time for the the nor star the Morning Star to shine brighter because Darkness has become so ticker and ticker and ticker it is time for this morning star to [Music] shine now that is why God he enforc you know ABC God has to enforce it on him restore the man his wife Lord he said that was his sister he said yes that is my Prophet you are not going to debate anything with me he told a lie he do that is undebatable let restore give the man his wife that is why nothing can hold us there is no way that the enemy can trap us our chains are loose we have been lose from his grip we have been L from the bandage of sin all shackles all things has been broken off we lose that's you say hey satan take your blood your flesh and take it from God's Property take your hand from God's Property yes yes sir because they refus salvation the wrath of God is waiting for them so he told them that is the 10 virgins he said and the M the Muslim the M of Omar was erected where the temple stood and Jesus spoke of it in the m 4 when you see the Abomination that maketh desolate in the Holy place where the Prophet Daniel SP said about it then it is in parenthesis said he that read let him understand right see when you see this Abomination the filthiness of the M of aror standing there where the holy Place once stood and today the mus the the most stand there exactly where the holy place at the holy place right on the temple side in the message 10 virgins brother why where could this Gentiles get opportunity to come and claim is Jerusalem how could they make it how could they build this Abomination right at the holy place place because they refuse their visitation they rejected their visitation let that not happen to the bride yes sir yes sir today Satan has destroyed all the denominations he has destroyed all the Orthodox now his GS is turned onto the bride his focus is now on the bride to bring confusion among the bride amen but let our eyes be open let us understand his strategy his schemes let us know how he has been working throughout all the generations but today the bride of Christ can never be deceived he could deceive Eve he could deceive Pentecost he could deceive Israel he cannot deceive this very Bri you can't do it because we have recognize our visitation Hallelujah now listen in the message from that time and from that time what whatever your attitude is towards god it feels your Eternal destination you heard that whatever your attitude is whatever your behavior whatever your character is what does it do it seals your eternal destination you can walk across the landine between grace and mercy and judgment and when you Spa You Spa is that the pronunciation s s p u r n how do you Spa when you you span Grace you you reject Grace Spa when you span Grace so many times you can separate yourself ever from the presence of God or you can accept him and have eternal life and never die but be raised up again at the last day in the general Resurrection oh how glad I am that there is something that we can point back to and say from that time something happened to me you can point to something you know what happened to you you know why you are forsaking all those stuff all the foolishness of the earth you know why you are a shining star to people that cannot cope with the word of God said you this

Victory Day Heavenly Father we are grateful and I Lord I am so in depth to you there is no way that I could ever pay the debt of my sin I was in a Cell prison one day because I was born in that cell I know what Freedom [Music] meant and the praise was so great I couldn't pay it but I am so glad that the day that you visit me in my cell I recognize you when Jesus visited you in your cell did you recognize him as the one that has wrote your pardon did you recognize him thank he is coming your way tonight he's holding the pardon for you he has wrot your healing for you all the problem he is handing it over to you tonight because you have recognized your visitation that is why you sit on that seed you are here you have book appointment with Jesus how can I overcome paragraph 92 you see as

you as hand and bring you under my wings but you have refused it Capo Capo Jerusalem jerus they refuse him and any check that refus to come under the mty wings of the mama you know what happens to that that is why Israel is in trouble they are paying for their rejection now Jesus did not come by any accident he came how did he bring Jesus on Earth he brought him by the word and how is he going to bring a bride he will bring a bride by the word there's no way he cannot do otherwise Jesus was brought right here by the word when Isaiah look what did he say he saw a virin shall conceive and he Proclaim it IAI what did you see I saw a virgin carrying a baby and what was that that was Emmanuel God With Us and said what did you see a son shall be given and the government shall be upon his shoulder He Shall be Called counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Mighty God it was never done in [Music] darkness it was proclaimed by the prophet it was a visitation God came into his people and they will bring the scure and then they will sing and they would they will sing the ssms they will sing the sons of Moses they will sing the Psalms but when the Vindication when the word was Vindicated in their day they could not see it they couldn't see it that is why Paul said you the Gentiles don't just be so that is proud or don't don't don't don't abuse your privilege as well because God intentionally Blended them amen amen true so that we can have chance amen that's right and the reason why Israel is suffering is because Pastor D and myself we are not ready to go right that's why they are suffering if the bread you're ready to go from this wicked foolish world this ad world this that is all kind of yes but people are happy to live in this earth depriving Israel their chance if the bre will live today Israel will have their peace God will visit them we are the people depriving them if we never we never get out of here God cannot deal with Israel friends you must know the time of your visitation when God comes your way can you really recognize him as your God that is why Hebrews 13 said Hebrews 13 let Brotherly Love continue Hebrews 13 chapter 1 be not forgetful to entertains strangers for thereby some have entertained angels on our ways you see it visitation I told my friend BR there I said you have done the right thing when I call you you open your doors I'll call some friends they will close their doors but that is how it is not all doors supposed to be open there are some doors that supposed to be closed and some doors must be open and it's an opportunity to have fellowship with this group when you come to Ghana you see that we were struggling to have you because we don't know what God has sent you to give to Ghana so every church will be chasing you I go to India I pre sometimes three times a day in India everyone will be chasing the missionary they want to get what God has sent you for that is how the church the bride is going to be perfected we need one another the ministry differ but it is all poting to Christ Jesus am listen look at the sh might woman he saw the hour of her visitation when elishah the man of God was passing by

I have lot of money I need nothing so the servant told them man he has got no no child there's no child in this house amen there is no child there is no baby there is no child in the house he has got

SP jelo Rahab received them because he recognized he got a vision that these guys they are Jehovah God children amen and nothing can stop them we have heard the news they defeating all kingdoms and they coming Rahab put them in the ceiling let them down you know the story that's her OED came R she recognized the hour of her visitation Abraham God has called him he has really wored with God for several years unwavering he did not doubt his his mission he did not doubt his calling why are you doubting your calling did you not hear his voice when he call you the voice never change it is the same still small voice Abraham you get a child not this Damascus guy not a laser you will get a child that is my promise and the Bible say at the time of visitation just left for one year God visited him again when Abraham was 99 years amen Abraham circumcise the hour has come that Isaac will not come from uncircumcision circumcise before Isaac will come Brethren let us circumcise our heart in this time of circumcision Jesus is coming the Son of God is coming the promis hand will be arriving soon circumcised our heart amen and after the circumcision he said as the manner of Life said when as a manner of life he said the woman they understand 28 days ABR explained he said 28 days Abraham ask Sarah what has happened to her 28 days you understand that was the hour of visit the church the church refused to believe Sarah said it is not possible and I'm old woman that's the church that is the church but Abraham he believe it was that said the Lord yes [Music] sir when God remembered his day and come Moses Moses I I put you in the house of pharaoh for them to train you so that you know how to destroy them God himself put him there so that he can destroy Pharaoh sometimes if Satan get you into his territory and then he he's really treating you bad don't worry you are just looking at his strategy God just plac you right there to see his strategy said whether he's a left hand man or a right hand man so if Satan put you in the ring don't worry don't worry you are in the ring to obtain or to understand his manner of fight how he does his things that's why he plays with there he he placed Moses right in pharaoh house Brethren but when God remembered his visitation he said Moses I have been waiting for you so long what was happening with you where I just put you in Pharaoh's house to the appointed time but you have wasted much time you know what God did to him Moses have to kill an Egyptian and then when he kill Egyptian they put it in the dieses a wanted man a wanted man it appeared in all dieses PHA was looking for him so he has to run away so when God was watching his son his Prophet come in God was laughing look at that wanted man I am wanting you and then you are wanted in Egypt wanted man I'm wanting you Hallelujah he was a wanted man and God was looking for his man so something must happen for some some pressure to push him sometimes pressure will push you to meet with God to push you to meet with God so he met with God in uncertain son braam said we want to see church on fire so the lot of Moses will be attracted let Fire Fall let the people hear of this assembly that fire everybody will run here fire Holy Ghost Fire when they hear the power of God in this church when they hear the walk when they hear the dam speak when they hear the blind SE when they hear power of God it will cause attraction that is the Holy Ghost Fire the time of our visitation Abraham saw a human being that walk to him and he did the same thing he sent Jesus Christ to Abraham's seed a human being when Abraham saw a human being he wash his feet he gave him food flesh human being he did not deny him he recognized his visitation but when Jesus was given to Israel what did they do you bth you sinner you that you were born in fornication you this this you call him all several names Jesus said I forgive you but when the Holy Ghost come and you blashe again may God have Mery on us not to blaspheme the Holy Ghost listen friends today Israel rejected brother said Messiah appears to those that are waiting for him Israel was waiting for a mesiah Samaritans were waiting for a messiah we Gentiles we were not waiting for any Messiah so Mah could not come to Earth so when Mah was on Earth you remember he told the disciples do not go to the way of the Gentiles Matthew chapter 10 don't go there it is not their day because we were not supposed to see any Messiah we were pagan people we were worshiping Idols that was not our day but he revealed himself to the predestinated look at Andrew when Andrew saw him when John pointed to him this is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world and you said Master you finish your work you finish your work you have baptized me but this man what did you say say it again this is the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world say byebye master you finish I will follow this man because my sins are settled I'm settled with sin I will follow this man to to take my load my sin load from me when he stay with him and then he saw the sign of the Messiah after he has told him all things master I am not the only one waiting for you if you see Jesus call your friend said let me go and call my brother Peter wait I'll call Peter Peter I have found him the one that the prophet spoke about we have F him the Messiah which is being interpreted Christ we have F him is that right when Peter was coming Peter also got his visitation he saw him a far of he said behold that is SE demon coming right there your father is Jonas brother they recognize him by his sign not his personality don't look at a man and his face look at the anointing in the man Philip he said na the one that Moses spoke about we have found him what have you found you what have you seen have you seen Jesus if indeed you have seen him you make you scream and make a lot of noise amen when you are fill with Jesus when you are f with Jesus you make noise you cannot shut up right bre will be closing very soon but listen the hour has come for you to know your place that this is the day for us to see Messiah that is why God sent Willam Bram he sent him for us to see God incarnated in flesh God in human flesh that was our day this is our day bam said we the Gentiles we were not privileged to see Jesus when he came in FL because it was not our day but the Samaritans they got their day why because they will have you have genter and they were waiting for a messiah remember what the woman said he said the scripture says that mesiah will come and that Messiah will be Christ by the way who are you because you are manner you manner how you are conducting yourself you look like you are a prophet Jesus said woman I speak with you I am he why that was her visitation Jesus could not deny her Jesus could not hide he has to expose himself to a child of God friends this is our day for us to see Messiah amen amen let nobody say is God but let nobody also say that God did not visit us in flesh if you say that brother you don't understand the message you believe listen to me don't sayam is God and never also never say that
