people that are normally here just out for different reasons mostly holidays lord jesus be with them in a special way meet their needs completely in your name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians and song leaders and everybody man just a few announcements just before we start and we'll have to spread the word because many are not out i made a mistake uh an honest mistake for some reason it started out that it was supposed to be that way but for some reason i thought jose's dedication was this weekend i was convinced of that and it started out that way because it originally said it would be the end of july or the first weekend of august but it was not this weekend and we did not go down saturday to host place because uh it wasn't this weekend it's this weekend coming so it will actually be the 13th on uh 5 o'clock and then the 14th so john dank was preaching saturday night at 5 and then juniors preaching sunday at uh you know their time at 11 which is the 14th and then i do have confirmation uh later this month emmanuel tombi is here on the 21st 21st which is the weekend after two weeks from today it's emmanuel tombi he's was here before and then moving just forward to september the 18th his brother james is here from lewis nelson's church and then the next sunday the 25th is a filipino pastor from the philippines that's coming from the convention we'll be here on the 25th amen to look forward to that also the convention in ottawa is the last weekend of august to the first weekend of september it is sunday to sunday i believe each sunday there's two services during the week there's just a service on the night so me and mom are planning on going tuesday to friday we will be here for sunday's most week but if anybody can go we know it's a long ways and on all these things but it'll be a blessing let's turn to uh second corinthians 4 and 14 just thank you for coming and just remember those that are out and we may talk behind the scenes about next weekend what we will do because our kids are going to be gone camping and so uh many of them will be out and so uh we're gonna be light again next sunday uh it'll be the other half of the church that's gone and so uh we pray that it's hot and i don't enjoy them sorry i wouldn't want to be in a tent on this morning it would be toasty god bless you sister patricia amen amen we want to preach today or god wants to preach today on uh just loved the songs the girls picked and and the lily song it's just a beautiful song kind of on our scene but i want to title my message what would jesus do what would jesus do and sadly sadly i believe many times jesus would do something different than sometimes even message believers do because we have a religious approach and we're in flesh and and so we want to look at jesus life in the bible now that's a great life to look at and even joseph life you could and i don't know if we'll finish today we might preach this again you know i depend on what the lord leads but i want to show you something so second corinthians 4 and 18 just one scripture there and then we're going to go to matthew while we look not at things which are seen now try to look at this spiritually realm or in the truth that we believe or even in the church setting but at the things which are not seen for things which are seen are temporal but things which are not seen are eternal those are powerful words uh matthew 5 and 14 the very very common scripture ye are the salt you are no for uh oh sorry let's go up one ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior wherewith shall it be salty it has sends forth good uh henceforth good for nothing and to be cast out for it is trotted under foot of men lord jesus we ask you to bless your word may you come and minister your thoughts this morning as we look into you your life here on earth lord jesus we ask you bless us all your bride of christ be with your bride around the world lord jesus in your beautiful name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this this morning just uh just an update because of the last song the girls saying uh you know we're few in number i don't know if you've seen this but uh you see the signs of the times are everywhere man aren't you glad we're not religious i'd probably get voted out of the church if i did this that's uh iran turkey russia iran that's who bombs israel how's terrace turkey russia you can't get much more lights ezekiel 38 39 gog and magog the prophet said that when they come down we won't be here now i'm not i'm not contradicting the prophet but just to show you how close it is they've already come down because russia's ships airplanes are already in uh saudi arabia by uh or syria i might have those mixed up that are right beside israel i told you a few months ago how uh russia had actually shot it so just to move forward just and i'm not preaching on that forgive me amy let's go back to our first scripture second corinthians 4 and 18. this week israel has been bombing terrorists over there they were bombed at and literally multiple people dead and they figure they'll be attacking all week so tensions are very very high very very high in israel of course we know what's going on with russia and and the war there in ukraine and and uh by all appearances russia will continue to take over ukraine and ukraine will be no more and but even to move ahead to this i was studying this week and i things are not attractive to the world and this is what our prophet said it's because we're competing with the world to be like them and accepted by them so they look at us and they go well you're no different than us you got to have a big education you got to been around for 35 years you got to be uh the brother of the sister of the fifth the in-laws or i see amen wow so we find out why looking into jesus life here here the first the very first thing that jesus recorded that jesus did in his life was his parents took him to mary and joseph uh took him his earthly parts his adopted parents took him to jerusalem for the passover and jesus stayed behind and he was 12 years old now at the age of 12 jesus jesus emphasis was on god at the age of 12. now that won't surprise you knowing that he was god the son of god amen but then the next time that jesus comes up you know right after he's uh uh you know coming into the ministry he goes out into the wilderness and he's tempted by satan now many people have used this but see here unlike message churches i'm going to attack message churches if that's all right or even ourselves sometimes god god help us oh god help me is we we let me just say it like this we have nothing to prove i i'm gonna i'm gonna even say something else i don't like the song that says i one in a million i gotta prove i'm one in a million i hate that song i don't get to prove nothing jesus didn't have to prove nothing you see if you're one in a million you won't have to prove it it'll be obvious see you'll be salty and see and that's the whole reason why people haven't been attracted to this uh you say well there's not more predestination if we were salty people would want it salt makes you there there's no other draw there's no other draw than a human body no other draw even no other draw stronger than thirst then flat thirst man and so jesus was here the tabern the wilderness and he's tempted of satan and satan is very much alive and well today and i want to show you that satan asked jesus three things and the first two things he did exactly the same answer and that devil is very healthy today if thou art the son of god what if we're going to have a big convention we better invite if we're going to have a couple's meeting we better invite if we're going to be a part of this group we better if if because we have to prove something so satan was coming at jesus saying i don't believe you are so prove it and not one time did jesus prove it see jesus was not somebody with low self-esteem amen hallelujah this is how he said he said that if thou be the son of god turn these stones into bread do me a miracle and prove it i'm going to read you some quotes after where where the prophet says that those are straight from satan straight from satan they're going to read you a quote at the end later on not now we know god can do that but god don't show off for nobody and jesus answered him like see he never had low self-esteem so he didn't have to like hire a really fancy piano player to pound on the music to bring up the emotion of the people to try to do something a certain date you know our prophet said that when god does something he's jehovah and that makes him the ability to choose when he does it because he's sovereign if god wants to give you bread of the stones he gets to choose when if and how because he's god amen so we know it's wrote jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and satan didn't like that answer so he came back to him with the very next question was was exactly identical as he started he said well if thou art the son of god he said jump off this cliff and the bible says now he starts quoting the bible like satan is a good preacher he says and the bible says that his angels will guard thee up and skirt thee up now that's a good preacher we could invite him you know the bible calls satan an angel of light i wonder how many pulpits have angels of light that have the spirit of satan on them jesus answered and said it is written again that thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and then satan goes and he changes his phrase a little bit because that wasn't working for jesus and he said well i'll give you all the world because see it's his until the millennium it's his he said i'll give you all the world and i'll give you all the glory that they give you that they give me if you'll just fall down and worship me the bible says that we're supposed to worship god in spirit and the truth hallelujah and he said here jesus answered them and he said get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve you know i've been studying some thinking meditating some on worship and we might preach on that sometime but worship comes from love worship comes from love and the bible says don't love the world or things of the world or the love of christ seen in you comes from love now watch this if you love something you worship it now you can have respects for it see how easy it is to fall into love you know i worship but god wants to be the only one worshipped everybody else is after god amen and here next you know along jesus life jesus is calling his disciples and surprisingly enough it's amazing that jesus you know jesus had been in the tabernacle and jesus had done different great things and he's going to be in the tabernacle here he'd already been in the tabernacle he'd been about his father's business jesus knew the lay of the land for sure god did he said i don't do nothing except the father show me now why did jesus not go and pick his people from the tabernacle well they're the ones that were invited to every convention and every camp means jesus was already there he was building a reputation with them and they were stunned that he knew so much at the age of 12. uh-huh in matthew 4 18-22 jesus called peter and aaron andrew sorry and he said come follow me and i'll make you fisher man fisher amend he picked men iran educated unlearned going to write their name weren't associated to the church had no influence no background did he do that intentionally or did he do it by mistake wow jesus comes and he preaches the sermon on the mount he preaches the beatitudes and tells us how blessed we'll be to be humble and and hungry and all these things and then he preaches when he finishes that sermon he preaches a new law i give unto you that new law was if you kill your brother you'd be charged for murder but he said now if you hate your brother you're charged for murder you know he said the old law was if you had an affair with the woman you're charged for adultery so now if you look on her you charge for adultery he brought he was bringing in a new law into the country when jesus came because see things were changing to grace amen from the law and the law was brand new but it was it was a it was real now because lots of people could hate you but they wouldn't actually go so far as to kill you but the effects were identical amen hallelujah and then we see the the the the pharisee that was popular what just this is i'm not making these things up but i'm going to read some quotes and establish this after simon the pharisee was a big hot shot and he wanted to invite jesus but he really didn't he just he just wanted him there but he didn't really want him to be front and center and so he never gave him a garment he never washed his feet and he never gave him a kiss when he came in he never really claimed them but he did send him an invitation amen jesus asked him a question and you know this is you know we're talking about what would jesus do oh you know the story of a harlot came and with her long hair she washed jesus feet and because jesus became because there was a bit of a commotion around jesus then simon the pharisee had to recognize that well he actually is in my house because all the other people were getting drunk and bumping into the ditch and the lady was out in her feet and you know like the big party was in the center of the house you know but there was kind of this commotion with this woman kneeling down before jesus and it was taking the it was watch this it was taken it was taken the emphasis off assignment because before jesus feet were getting washed he was the center of attention and he made up some excuse that she had wasted this cologne on his feet and jesus told her that you'll always have the poor you can take care of the poor tomorrow but she's doing this for me and then jesus asked him a question a huge question and it's in luke 7 36 to 49 and and 40 and 43. but he actually said if there was somebody that was had done some wrong and the one person had committed a greater wrong it's like somebody stole 100 bucks and the bank forgave him the other person had just stole two bucks the bank all forgave him he said which person would be the most gratitude this is jesus himself asking simon our prophet preached this from the standpoint of the unwanted christ he had him there but he didn't really want him there he had him there but he certainly did not want him the center of attention oh no no no i was going to mess up his program because he wanted to be the center of attention and simon answered this question that jesus asked him and he said well of course the person that god forgave a hundred dollars the one that got forgave the most and jesus said now now let's just back up we said that worship came from love we said that whatever you love you worship so the bible says if you love the world or the things of the world the love of christ ain't in you so you can't love and worship the world and love and worship christ okay now watch this and simon and jesus goes to simon the the phyllis or the uh and the pharisee and he says you answered well that's why she has more love for me and worship than you do see now if you wanted to have somebody as your visiting minister wouldn't you want to have somebody that had a great testimony of deliverance because the greater the testimony by jesus own example this is jesus own example because the greater the testimony the greater the love the person would have for christ which was worship but you know what we do in the church we send those people oh bless god i i never had three wives bless god i was raised in the message i was pure oh we shun them of course we do uh bless god his ministry's questionable i don't think we'll invite him now you know that's the truth uh bless god you know they they've a really rough family and oh and that's who washed jesus feet and that's who jesus said had the greater love for him we don't follow that in the message not in general nope god help us amen see jesus never judged the woman he knew that the woman had been forgiven and loved him the most you know our prophet said when jesus had he had an appointment to meet the woman at the well the prophet said that he had to send the disciples away because they had a religious spirit on them and they judged him that he even tells the story about when he preaches he said when they come back and see them talking to the prostitute they questioned whether he was the messiah because he should have knew her lifestyle but because he knew she was predestinated and she had been forgiven more she would love more wow amen here here's something that i found amazing here in matthew 8 2 and 4 jesus heals two lepers heals a leper maybe it's one leper first and then it's two after and jesus said unto them after they're completely healed he said put it on facebook and youtube and share it with all the churches no he said well go to the church and we'll book a spot for you to testify sunday no i don't know why he did it i flat out don't know why he did it you want to know what he said he said see that thou tell nobody no man that but jesus was here to shine the light and what better way to tell them than a man that had been transformed you think that's the only time he did it in matthew 9 27 here we go jesus heals two blind men and jesus straightly straightway charges them put it on youtube and share it to all the message believers no jesus straightway charged them saying see that no man know of it direct quote that's does that puzzle any abuse it still puzzles me and i studied on it matthew 14 and a lot of these are published in uh you luke here it shows the care that jesus had not just for their spiritual diet but their bodies matthew 14 15 to 21 here jesus comes and he feeds the five thousand now he had been preaching to them and the disciples were gonna send them away and he said well you can't send them away because they'll faint the disciples wanted to send them to town that they could buy and jesus feeds the five thousand he said they need to depart he said give them to eat and all jesus did was bless that little food the three three uh three loaves and the two fishes and they had twelve baskets left which these two you know what these twelve baskets show the 12 was the the hierarchies of the apostles in the temple but it shows that all the 5 000 had all their filth it was smorgasbord it wasn't like one toast per person because we might run out no no it was self-serve all you can eat do all baskets left over and it was five thousand men plus women and children and then just down here jesus goes and the disciples go on the ship and jesus goes up in the mountain to uh to pray and you know with the story where the sea the storm comes in and the sea and jesus is walking out on the sea and he asks uh that you know of course they're afraid of him and he said not to fear not that it was him and peter said you know those very great words he said god lord if it's you bid me to come to you on the water and of course we know he did he told him to come and peter doubted that it could be possible he just he just couldn't get a grip that he was walking on water and he said lord save me and immediately the bible says immediately jesus stretched out his hand immediately see he cared for the people he cared for peter even though peter for peter to doubt he was in a backslidden state he said why did you doubt immediately he stretched forth his hands so i'm trying to show you the compassion that jesus had he didn't say well you deserve it peter you can we'll throw you the light no no immediately immediately same with the people he said well they deserve to be hungry it's not my fault i'm not responsible for faith in five thousand we can answer like this when somebody says well it's not my duty to feed the world was it jesus duty to feed ten thousand ten thousand fifteen thousand if all the men and women had one child it's fifteen thousand people imagine if i told the land we were going to throw a party and feed all the wyoming and sarnia too she said well that's not our duty but jesus did it amen but he's no different see he had compassion great compassion here in mark 15 32-38 here jesus is preaching again and the people had stayed with them three days so that must have been an awesome message i'd like to have a copy of that message and jesus had great compassion with the people and here the disciples were going to send them away before they were going to send them away to the town to buy and jesus said they've been here three days and had nothing to eat and if you send them away fasting they will faint see jesus had common sense amen and there they asked what he had and they had some a few loaves and and some fishes i think seven loaves and fishes and when jesus blessed that they had seven baskets left over and it was four thousand men plus women and children now he was on a daily feeding basis their church had a big fellowship hall there's 15 000 people in it man here jesus took peter and uh i'm not even sure i don't even have who it was but jesus went up here in the mountain and was transfigured before a couple of the disciples and he appeared with moses and elijah talking to jesus amen it was supernatural and the disciples seen that right before their eyes right before their eyes now watch us they'll watch i'm going someplace with this there was two disciples that went with jesus and peter was one of them and peter jesus leaves them and he goes a little further up the mountain he's transfigured into his glorified body and moses and elijah comes and talks to him and they see him talking to him now i want to tell you something i'm inviting peter and the other disciple to come preach for us right you can't get no closer to and watch what jesus taught him in verse 9 jesus charged them said tell the vision to no man until i'm gone and the son of man is revealed amazing amazing how many people would have came in and got saved with a message like that and jesus said don't tell them i hardly understand it well this shows you totally jesus wasn't in popularity he wasn't in popularity and he never did popularity for the devil he never did popularity for his disciples he never even did popularity for the people he healed but i wonder if we're doing what jesus would do i wonder i wonder here in matthew 18 22 and 21 peter asked the lord he's you know you can see peter's thinking from the flesh he said how many times do i gotta forgive my brother you all know the story of that but jesus said forever i just want to forgive him seven times and jesus said you should forgive them seventy times seven which really means forever peter was getting weary forgiving jesus never ever got weary forgiving man what would jesus do what would jesus do are we doing what jesus would do here in matthew 19 and it's also recorded in luke here the people brought their children to jesus and the disciples rebuked them said you know you watch you watch don't just think of this no jesus was the head man he's the son of god do you watch no no i'm being very truthful you're watching big churches how they keep the pastor removed from the people they have 12 deacons and you never talk to the preacher and it was guaranteed that jerrod's kids or matt's kids would never ever see that man well they're bigger and more popular than jesus but jesus said rebuked them and said suffer the little children and forbid them not for such is the very kingdom of heaven but we don't do that our pastors don't don't associate and mingle and even teach the children they're revelations too big for that but jesus revelation was not too big for the kids oh i see amen is is that the truth is that the truth have you ever seen a a a message church of 300 people or 400 people in the preacher doing the the toddler's class or they wouldn't understand his revelation but they would understand jesus revelation so you're insinuating that his is greater than jesus but jesus said that the servant is not greater than the master see the master never had nothing to prove because he knew he was the master jesus when he went before pilate in matthew 27 12-14 and he had multiple accusers which were his own people from his own church the jewish people and he answered them not a word and and i wanna i i you know this was brand new i should have seen this but you know in luke 23 13 and 16 you know pilate and herod both say pilate says i sent him to herod and he found no fault in them and he sent them back to me and he found no fault and the bible literally says in luke 23 he said pilate and herod found no fault with jesus he said i've examined him before you and i found no fault in this man touching the things whereas you accuse him of but jesus held his peace i couldn't have done that not in the past like for sure not in the past amen you think of how somebody's blatantly telling lies in public but what would jesus do he held his peace so much that the kings marveled pilot marveled marveled he could have said hey what would jesus do you know i have a minister send me a message said somebody said so and so and you did so and so and i sent them right back no no but jesus huh i failed that test many me you sue me wow what would jesus do let's look at some scriptures before we go john 14 17 to 20 and even the spirit of truth that the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him not but ye know him for he dwelleth in you and ye shall be in you and i will not leave the you comfortest and i will come unto you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because i live ye shall live also hallelujah and that day shall know and at that day you shall know that i am in the father we are christ is in the father and ye are in me we are in christ and christ is in you now if all those things are happening at that day you shall know that i am in the father that's christ talking as jesus is talking and ye are in me and i am in you then you don't have to don't listen to one thing that somebody says just watch your life that's how they operate you know if you girls ever want to get married watch how they operate around the kids and their grandma their old grandma that's how they'll operate around you behind the scenes see if this scripture is true verse 20 then we have to be exactly what would jesus do romans 8 1-11 and then verse 14. i'll start with one romans 8. and there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ now we're in christ so see they're no condemnation you don't have nothing to prove you don't have to prove to me you don't have to prove to your brother and sister that's why i hate that song would never sing that song here if it i have anything to say with it and but you don't have nothing to prove to the world you're you're just christ i'm going to show you where that's all you need to attract the world by what our prophet said to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit see it's this flesh that gets in the way it's his flesh that wants popularity it's his flesh that things are revelations too great for the kids it's our flesh that thinks if we hire the fake name preachers that will have a more god-led spirit but we don't know that the same holy ghost is in every man and every woman not that you're going to have woman preachers of course not that's but you could have the smallest preacher so even let you say well like what would jesus do now our prophet tells the story about when he went to pentecost and he was so sport midnight poor oh nobody knows what midnight for us he never had and he slept in the cornfield and he talks about how he did his clothes so he wasn't wrinkled and and all these things i'm talking i'm saying you have no change in your ashtray you're poor like nothing and he was like 20. you go back and check this story he was unknown he stunk our prophet he stopped in a cornfield no it was hot and humid just like today he had b.o he had mud on his clothes and his shirt and trousers never matched and god let pentecost to say there's a william branham here and we want him to come forth and minister and the prophet slid down on his seat and he slid down more and he slid down more and the guy said what did the guy send me finish so you got leprosy what's the matter with you he said well don't tell them they said they're asking for me to come forward and take a look at my clothes like they go hey see here he's right here he's he's and now we're message believers and we have the anointing of god the revealed work the seals are open now they weren't open then which made this a brand new book to all the fivefold ministries that had the baptism of the holy ghost two let me read to all the fivefold ministry that have the baptism of the holy ghost but we would never ask a 19 or 20 year old boy that had b.o mud on his pants and his shirt and trousers never matched and we'd never heard him preach before to come and preach at the camp meeting we'd never do it we would never just admit it it would never happen why did god have that recorded in the message because we don't believe that flat out don't believe that not by our actions maybe i hope we believe that but in the whole no not even close wow yep wow and the prophet talks about how he preached it wasn't a perfect message that's by his own testimony they don't throw rocks at me at eggs he says how it was because in great detail right anybody that's heard it go back and look it up and god sent multiple people to invite them to multiple people multiple people passers that never had the revelation of the seals were opened and the bible was a new book went to this hillbilly that was 19 or 20 that had b.o unmatching trousers and mud on his fence and said come and preach for him and when he did it because of his mother-in-law god almost killed him well jay he killed his wife and his daughter i wonder what god thinks about some of these ministers that wouldn't do the same thing today if god don't comfort me they think about that see they're not depending on this the spirit man they're not dependent on the holy ghost they're depending on the strong arm of flesh he knows how to do it you don't have to know how to do it god knows how to do it amen for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made us free to the law of sin and death and that the law could not do that was weak through the flesh weak through the flesh but we believe the flesh is strong i mean the strong ones of us god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and sin condemned sin in the flesh the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk after the who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit verse verse five for they that are up after the flesh do mine the things of the flesh that's about where most of the people are but they that are after the spirit mind the things that are after the spirit you can tell by how salty people are attracted to it see like if you already got hollywood in your house and you're gonna come and watch hollywood at church well like you can just be hollywood for be not carnally minded is death death in the church but be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal minor is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so when they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit and if so that spirit of god that dwells in you now if any man hath not the spirit of christ he ain't his you can tell that by his life and if christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit of but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him is raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you and then verse 14. he's going to skip to 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of god there you are you're the sons of god amen wow god help us let's just close with some read some uh just some short quotes here and and god keeping his word amen he's talking about uh false uh he was talking about people reading church literature and not the bible magazines and he said it's just it's as false as reading bad magazines and then he said i traveled to the jungles and i've seen which doctors and them challenge me out there and do all this kind of things the devil do all these kind of signs the devil no this is where i showed you watching how he would do it watch him take a stick and hold it in the air and lay it down and make it walk away like a snake crawling or turn back around and look at glass glass of wine of water turned it into purple looking colored like wine and wanted me to drink it and then the same group said watch this satan knows the bible really well they said drag quote you can get it off my ipad the lord told them of all them sensations and it finally comes to this said now watch how ridiculous this is take your mother and lay her down there and kill her and put her up on the body upon the altar and i'll raise her up on the third day because see the bible says that the dead will rise he said it is written praise see now here's satan no remember the prophet said this was the devil he said for it is written we got bible for this present your bodies a living sacrifice so you can go kill your mom and god will make her a living sacrifice and put your mother there and the authorities had to come and take him for killing his mother certainly the man came to himself in one of these uh situations pouring wine into water and stuff like that and the cornstarch walking away and all this kind of stuff is of the devil certainly it is god don't need nothing god don't need nothing he don't need you nothing to prove but the bible and the holy ghost and there and that's here to vindicate the resurrection of jesus christ but we won't have a convention unless we invite the most popular 10 preachers in the world and post it on youtube but a prophet said god don't need it now that is 57036 god keeping his word number one sermon it's here totally available for anybody i can print it off our printer wouldn't work today so i'm reading off the ipad but you see the world is you see when i studied it but you see as it is in the world so is it in the church now if that prophet was preaching today he would say the message churches so as it is in the world so is it is in the church they are trying to build something but god don't need your help to build his kingdom now you can't get much plainer than that god don't need your help to build his kingdom god just wants you to preach the word he'll do the building he's the architect you got the plants laid out here and that's oneness of unity 58 and here's my last quotes i i got a few of them and this was in uh 60 162 message let your lights will shine and i'm just going to read some one-liners what he said in here about how we are you just think about our churches and how we help god get god on the scene and our prophet said we don't need to do none of that but we do it and so by doing so we're not doing what jesus would do man so he's talking about advertisement so he said i thought about advertisement how advertisement pays off and here's paragraph 97 so he says if it pays off for that i'll begin to think on that and why don't christians christianity pay off to advertise and he says so you believe that christians so i believe that christians are god's billboard and i believe that every one of us are his billboard and we don't have to do so much carrying on about this as we do just simply live such a life that will make the people hungry to be like you see if you're acting like hollywood and you got to have the best speaker and the best piano player and the best song leader and you're just well like we might as well just hire rock stars so they're practiced up well of course they would sing gospel songs but they wouldn't miss any notes no like believe me there's nothing wrong with being perfect but that's not that don't get god on the scene now the only way the world will ever see christ is when he sees they see him in you and in me and remember each of you from here tonight remember that you are god's billboard and you're you're the advertising agent you are the work the now the world will look at you and will they see and will they see christ so they can't see where they got no more here let me just read a bit of this but there are so many that the father has drawn that are hungry and thirsting for god to find god and yet they don't know where to find god because those who are supposed to be billboards have so much smut with the life of the world till they can't see where they got any more than what they've already got themselves they live like the world they talk like the world they sing like the world and they dress like the world he said we ought to today we should be in the church we should be the church church be today we should be so such a condition that it would cause the whole world can you imagine we should be in such a condition that we would cause the whole world to want to come here we haven't got that problem reason we ever got that problem what would jesus do jesus always was simple not popular showed compassion always went to the old humble children wow he said oh what kind of person should we be if we were the billboards and we were sponsored by christ and in christ is the one where we get our life and we get our strength be careful what you do and what we say i i mention that with preaching on facebook be careful what you do and what you say and what we are in our daily life because we are sponsored by christ and how are we to walk if we're sponsored by christ what are we to say if we're sponsored by christ if someone says evil against you what must we say if we're sponsored by christ we must be like christ isn't that right hallelujah now you can appeal to the hungry of the world that's wanting to see where they come from who are they and where they're going unless you preach the gospel that rises christ to a living a living atmosphere right here around us now if it's just the letter it's just dead we don't have to preach he said we ought to be today no matter we don't have to have a big audience we don't have to preach to ten thousand we don't have to even preach we can be god's advertisement board and would win thousands of souls to christ because they saw christ in you ye are the salt of the earth and if the salt has lost its savior then where in is it salty hallelujah why don't the world want what we got wow are they thirsty a simple clean billboard of christ wrote across your life he said the people are looking for a class this is so true i'm closing here just momentarily people are looking for a class do you want do you know that the devil lives in a class do you know what caused the first fight in heaven was lucifer was set on a greater class of people get a better class of angels and he thought and he had a bigger kingdom and a more brighter kingdom and a shinier kingdom than michael had and he was kicked out of heaven see where the class comes from see where the classy big operations come from see where the big classy three thousand people and three of the same ministers for thirty years come from all the anointing of satan he said see where the class comes from stay away watch us stay away from class he said the hungry don't want class the hungry wants food yes sir the cold wants fire but uh not a picture of fire and the hungry is thirsting for god it wants the gospel and the power of christ amen no matter how simple it is or how unpopular it is the world they want they want reality they already have hollywood and a man that's dying and a man that knows he's got to meet god don't care don't care about class my last uh screen here now remember in closing keep this up but in closing i want to say this that we're not god's salesmen so if we hire people to put on a bigger show for our church it's not that we're working for god's kingdom we're working for our own kingdom we're working for our own self-esteem our own local he said we're not his salesman we're his billboards see don't think you're his salesman he don't need any salesmanship just your life billboards let's stand what would jesus do hallelujah god help us god help us to be real amen and and you know we should always be in being real we should always be respectful i'm not talking about uh you know i'm not talking about being unrespectful even the house of god or things like this but i just wonder you think of this just think of your whole life and you know where you've been spiritually your spiritual wife just say would jesus have handled that the same way with jesus would jesus operate our churches the same way we're operating our big places i wonder i really wonder when he says don't tell nobody what i did for you and when he goes to the the less fortunate and the kids and different things i just wonder god help us you know if we're in the flesh we'll look to these things you know you can you can tell it hugely you know when i know and it's factual you should never ask who's preaching it's actually god preaching as long as you have confidence that the person preaching has the holy ghost he does have to have the baptism of the holy ghost but besides that are you looking for signs and wonders where the prophet called them the devil are you look at the devil you know he said when you know uh you know lord we would like to see a sign he said the same satan that asked jesus for signs when he tempted him in the wilderness of course we believe god does signs but that's not the jesus we're chasing after you know we can chase after a hollywood jesus a show off jesus a popular jesus an educated jesus that's that's a pretty good one an educated jesus we know we memorize jesus a well speaking a well-dressed jesus when our very own prophet never dressed like most would today people churches have special meetings they would go out and rent a suit or tuxedo because it was and our prophet's day his coat never matched his pants when our prophet first got saved he had a coat you should go back and read the beginning of his life story he had a coat that had a big burn hole in it and he would carry his arm the wrong way and shake hands with the wrong hat because he was covering a cold i wonder if this message has just got rich we're just rich we don't want that poor stuff would would we hire a preacher that's got a hole in his coat that he's got like when he walks out from the pope and he's got to do this because he said no we wouldn't hide but then we say we what would jesus do god help us amen god help us family of god i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god in the fountain clans by his blood join us with jesus as we travel this [Music] the foreign the family of god you will notice we say brother and sister around here [Music] and rejoice in each victory in
