way text me this morning and you know I mentioned that anytime you try to do something for God Amen and so they had a problem with the dogs they were going to be like you know the Devil he's just a professional stuff like that amen but uh we recognize him and they's still coming so just encourage like to be an encouragement to them do you need to turn this down Vicky so I got the other um okay I won't I won't sh maybe I won't amen just uh we had a wonderful time with with brother Ben and and uh last weekend and even the few weekends we had different ministers and Junior and brother Thomas and and uh I I enjoyed the services amen and just uh all of you's last weekend that that participated and helped and did things and always we just uh it was amazing the whole service was amazing the specials were amazing brother Carson's read was amazing and and exhortation was was amazing and and just everything cooking whatever it was taking care of brother Ben and and H them just uh it's uh fine just amazing man and God God has a family he don't just have a Ministry he has a family don't forget that amen the family is if you didn't have a family you wouldn't need a Ministry so there may be more important than the ministry most people don't realize that but I'm perfectly okay with just being part of the family amen amen God help us and you know uh uh I I want to share this before read my scriptures but things like that is how Satan comes into the body and separates God's kingdom and you know before we go home in a rapture we have to recognize Satan I got a bit of an echo we have to recognize Satan you know it's not each other it's just Satan that's trying to make you think something that never even happened or you know what I mean and and I I mentioned some of that Wednesday night but many of you weren't here you know if God can't attack the person then he'll attack the the wife and if you can't attack the wife then he'll attack the kids and and and then you say well you know so and so said and did and my goodness me and brother Tim are as different as the night is from the day but he's my son he's not my son-in-law we were actually looking for his baby pictures when him and Vicki got married and wondered why we didn't have his baby pictures that's just literally how much we claim him but to think that one person can affect another body I mean that's God's job amen and but that's how Satan comes in he says oh well you know they're they're not you know no none of us are perfect amen God's Ministry was never perfect except himself self amen and anyway that's free but uh also just uh junior could have been here he just didn't have a ride and we remember Jim and Linda and chadam just uh if anybody's that way I mean they'll sure love you to stop in and see them um it's just a sad situation for them really being locked in their house but we're actually by God's grace going to uh try to get Junior Esther's van and uh and that will help him him to be a part of us and uh amen so let's turn to Second Peter uh 1:10 and 11 and I uh uh I was going to say this for anybody that uh you know uh I'm I'm going to preach to myself this morning and and you know something I want to put a disclaimer out you know the Bible says and brother Brown taught us that a pastor is a noox anointing you know when we went and had fellowship with the other mean ministers you know they were talking about that you know and there's nothing very glamorous about an ox like nobody goes to the fair to see an ox I mean they'll go see the cheetah and the lions and you know and the Eagles and all that other stuff but the ox there's not a line looking to go see a brute Beast amen but that's just the gift that God placed on a pastor's thing so it's not always glamorous but it gets down to the meat of the road amen amen hallelujah second Peter 10 or 2 Peter 1:10 and 11 therefore the rather Brethren give diligent and make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall Hallelujah for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting and Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Lord Jesus we pray that you will be add a blessing to your word Lord Jesus and may you come and your sweet Holy Spirit and anointing and feed us your Mana this morning Lord God we pray and we give you all the glory and honor for it amen amen you may have your seats this morning you see this scripture many times and and I looked back on the message Hub and I was comforted to see that the prophet didn't always compare this to Ministry and many times we would think of this as a minister making his calling an election sure amen we're welcome and but we see over in Romans and maybe we'll just turn there Romans 8:30 we'll see that this scripture applies to everybody this morning amen everybody completely and remember that this scripture says that if you do these things ye shall never fall the our Prophet said that you have the right to make a decision you see over here in Romans 8:30 it says moreover whom I predestinated them I have called so they that didn't just apply to the ministry and whom th I have called I've Justified and Those whom I've Justified I've already glorified so we see that we make our calling and election sure because it was Jehovah that elected us and called us and that's a body Ministry not a not a FF Ministry amen and so even though we're in the bride of Christ we are affected by things around us and our Badger skin and the prophet had this message uh connected to this scripture and he said the Rich Young Ruler made the wrong decision and many of the people in our lives or in this world are making the wrong decision and here the prophet said in the in the message he said the Rich Young Ruler became a beggar but it was too late because he was in hell and it was because of the riches of the world the deceitfulness of riches and and all these things of the world that the Rich Young Ruler had gave up his eternal life for eternity and I I say God help us you know I want to preach on my title this morning is no continuing City and we have lots of examples we have Moses we have Abraham and we have uh Solomon and most of these people but you know as you get older in life and your hair becomes white and it hurts when you get out of bed in the morning you start looking at why am I doing what I'm doing and it will make you scratch your head and before we read some some scriptures to connect to this I'm sorry my uh my iPad is my my messages I put them down as they come and so they're scattered just forgive me to uh find them but I I want to show you something and I want to show you some big companies you know you know we all know places that we would have never believed would close we we set our hopes on Eternal or on Earthly things and we say well this will be like this forever and nothing on this Earth is forever Eternal who would believe that Sears would have closed who would believe that hazard's elevator would close when they had like a dozen elevators and I worked for them when me and the way were married and we loaded trains and boats and it's a ghost town amen see how the things you you build your hopes on things and I and I'm not preaching on money this morning and and I know we have to survive and and we live in a cold climate or you'd freeze to death but I was thinking of my daddy and he bought his home farm for $1,200 and they said he would starve to death the neighbors Olivers Oliver Dawson said he would starve to death bought the farm for $1,200 and and I'm going to show you something that blew my mind now that farm today is worth3 million but I you know normally when they figure out a farm a property a 100 Acre Farm they just look at the buildings they say now the building lot's worth a million and then the Farm's worth whatever it's worth now I'm not talking about money don't don't don't run away on me yet but I figured out the percentage of the world bank and inflation and you're going to be shocked for how little you're working for because I 2 million which the property is actually worth 3 million so it's oneir less it was 0 6% 0 6% so my daddy used to work for $1 a day and he got his lunch so he'd go bail for my grandpa and he would get a dollar a day handle a th000 square bailes and he would get a free dinner now do you realize he was making five times five times what you're making today and you're happy and you're chasing your dream you know I look at my grandpa that had the my grandpa on my mom's side had the biggest registered horn Herford herd in Ontario and the farm where they kept them it's as bare as that carpet is on the alleyway and yet if he went to places in public people would almost worship him see spirits don't change you know like that song said we need to build our hopes on things Eternal and not on Who's got what and what's got in this company and all this I want to show you just to lay a a lay a foundation and and I have I have more quotes and we'll ever get through today and and scriptures to just show us you know we were put here for one purpose or two or three purposes to proof to Satan that there'll be a bride to prove to Satan and this second bride will never fall like the first one and that by Amazing Grace that will be there at the end and we were also put here for worship because if we didn't worship Him the stones and the ox and the mountains would God will be worshiped God will be worshiped and you know if we want to make a mistake in any area you should lose your mind worshiping God it don't matter who is leading song it wouldn't matter if it was Matt or Felix or Silas or nobody you shouldn't even need somebody leading songs you know when the preacher teacher it wouldn't matter what how far the notes are off if you just I mean see cuz it's it's not about each other it's your you're literally Comm you're you're you're giving flowers to Jehovah it's like a husband taking roses to his wife and he don't really care what the rest of the world thinks about his flowers or his wife but spiritually seeking you you're like who oh wow uh-huh I wanted to show you the value and you know if you Google stuff like this you will I do one time especially in the winter when uh uh but the the trick of Satan by a world bank and inflation and that's why when you go to Uganda and I would go to Uganda I would never take well you can't even get Uganda money here but you would go to Uganda and I would you could get a million dollars on your visa and the and the thing so I was a millionaire the whole time I was there and I never forget the first time we went into the bank you know and they got machine guns outside as if this is a lot of money they got one on each side of the door and or pump shotguns or whatever and you think like wow this is a big deal you know and and the printer came out of the money and it was about like that the stock and I handed it to Leo and I said are you going to count it he goes that's about right uhhuh it's called a lie of the devil and it's happening to us but you don't believe it I'm hoping you'll believe a little bit more before we leave today do you know that at a third lesson the real value the 06 of 2 million is if you were making $35 an hour it would be equivalent to 2 cents an hour and that is figuring one3 less of the value so when my daddy was making a dollar a day and he got a free meal which I would be worth 50 bucks today praise God I mean he was actually making like 5,000 in a day you see because if you figured this for a third less at a $35 an age salary today is actually a penny and a half an hour that is why you're struggling to make a living and I don't want to discourage you and because this message ain't about discouraging you but it's only going to get worse and so we're spinning our tires thinking we're really setting the world on fire and when you get a little bit more white hair you're like you know I look at family and situation you know my brother just just just nicely got everything comfortable and he went out and bought a new car and a new truck and now he has a anism that he could he might not I might never see him again he could blow up today and to fix its open heart surgery the odds of him living uh out of open heart surgeries like a miracle and so here he's looking at all this wealth it make no difference you know my grandpa I told you about what he had and and this ain't I'm just trying to I'm not I'm just trying to reveal the devil is that all right is this all right you know my grandpa's grandkids are on welfare yep it's fine if you leave something to your children but it we're not here for money Earthly wealth amen now just for a clarification for anybody that's wondering why I'm preaching on this this has probably been in my iPad for over a well probably a month and a half I didn't have to do many notes to to preach this morning it's been here forever I had pictures back that Vicki or Amy's going to show and they've been back so far they were scattered through my phone because God was laying on this my heart and I I'm I'm looking at way back when I said I was considering selling a farm I'm like why we do what we do you know to to to break this down now this I I want you to understand that I didn't over evaluate the stuff today but if you were making $400 a day now it's equivalent to 50 years ago 24 cents 24 cents you could buy that same Farm 50 years ago for 24 cents per day per day amen wow see our money is actually like that too it's like Uganda that's a million dollars that looks about right because it's worthless but it's came in really slow and we think we're that's right amen that's a hard pill to swallow you know I was looking at places that close you know the school I went to is closed they have horses running in it government schools I'm thinking really nothing lasts forever our Prophet talked about he preached a message on no continuing City and and everything he knew in his life was gone amen we have our priorities mixed up by emphasis you know I mentioned about hazards they used to load they had elevators they loaded trains and boats they could load train and boats at the same time I work for them and loaded trains out of elevators it's a ghost town today you know tville sales Barn I went to many I know I know you don't know these places but they were owned by the Cattle Company from West and they unloaded cattle and sheep and livestock from the train company it's completely a ghost down now it was an Canadian International sail Barn multi-million doll when I was a young boy it took three men to buy it out it's a ghost town quality swine used to buy all the pigs in Ontario and send them out to feed light said he filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy yeah people that you would have looked like if you would have worked for them I worked in the doctors multibillion dollar companies God help us God helped me to realize you know Hitler when he did it Hitler was convinced that he would have the Thousand-Year reign of the German Empire that's actually the Millennium he was turned it into a nurse Earthly Kingdom what God's made for a spiritual income Kingdom amen see how see how it's so easy because we're Tabernacle in flesh amen and we need to really check our Prophet said that the Rich Young Ruler made the wrong decision and because he made the wrong decision he became a bagger a bagger that's amen it's fine if you have something in you have to have enough to stay warm and and you know uh you know the balance of this is if you can't feed your family you're worse than an Infidel but we don't have that problem Amen in our country in Ecclesia uh I'm not even sure I'm saying that right ecclesiastics Solomon talked about here and it was amazing I want to read some of the scriptures of Solomon um I'm not even sure I'm saying that right but um and I tell you what I I would challenge you to go home and just if you don't if you can't focus on reading it just hit the auto and listen to some of the chapters of ecclesiastics because here was the wisest man of the world the wisest man that ever lived was Solomon and he had everything at his fingertips and he sought everything at his fingertips and he realized before he died that everything everything everything was vanity there was nothing on Earth Worth Fighting For Nothing on Earth worth fighting for amen let's turn to First ecclesiastics 1 and three and then we're going to jump to 8 and n and I want to just show you some things here I I only wanted a couple scriptures and he had so many key points here it was it was a little overwhelming to me for what ha a man of all his labors while he taketh Under the Sun uh let's start at verse one sorry for the words of the preacher of the son of David the king of Jerusalem vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanities of vanities everything is Vanity what prophet hasth the man what profit hath a man of all his labors taken Under the Sun for one Generation generation passes away and another generation cometh we're going to drop to verse eight and all things are full of Labor and a man cannot utter it his eyes are never satisfied with what is seen nor his ears filled with the hearing we're never happy with our new vehicle amen and the thing that he hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which is shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun now if we drop to verse 10 and 11 and there is any is there anything wherefore that may be said see this is new has it not been already of Old Times which was before us there is there is no remembrance of the former things neither shall there be an remembrance of the things that are to come and these things that shall come thereafter verse 14 I'm going to jump to 14 for I have seen all the works that are done under the sun now Solomon he he had the wealth of the world and now watch what his opinion was of it he said I've seen all the things the works that are done under the sun and behold it's all vanity and vexations of spirit and I gave my heart here 17 and I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know Madness and Folly and he and perceived that this also is vexation of spirit now I want to stop there for a minute he ain't just talking about wealth he's talking about knowledge and wisdom he's talking about everything Earthly now I wish I had a little bit more reading ability but you see what he's saying he said this word just passing through our Prophet I'm going to stop here and show you this multiple times to his wife they would say you know if they seen somebody and he' say we're not Americans we're a we're a Heavenly being we're just a passing through no I'm not affected by politics they're of the devil and and no matter who and where and what it's hard to get that through our heads it's hard to get it through my head like I said I'm preaching to myself this morning you can do everything else and something you know Verse 18 for in much wisdom is much grief uh-oh wow I want to know the message better than anybody I don't I want to have the revelation of Christ I you know what I mean like you see what I'm saying there the message is the truth but the message is Christ amen I want to know him in the body and personality of Jehovah forget about knowledge look brother B said I don't know the Bible but I sure know the the other person they wrote it Hallelujah wisdom is much grief and he that increase in knowledge increases in sorrow H that's why you parents you look at your grandkids and you go wow because you lived it you know what decision you're like I wouldn't go there I did that 50 years ago a and they're just plowing right on forward and you go to bed and you toss and you turn and you toss because you know they don't know Amen in Chapter 2 in verse 11 still carrying on this is a long talk where Samuel's Samuel is disheart he said then when you look at all the works that my hands has wrought now he did a couple good things I mean he did a lot lot of things he said when you look at all that my hands has wrought and all and on the labor that I had labored to do and behold it's all vanity building the Temple was vanity everything he did for Jerusalem as vanity no it's it was good he had the temple but he's just putting it in perspective wow to labor to do behold it's all vanity and vation of spirit do you want me to tell you something and and this is person you know why we can't lock in with Jehovah God and and we can't worship him like we do and why we can't run the aisles and because we can't have Victorious It's because we got fation of spirit and we know that next month that something's going to and we're afraid something's going to blow or the bill or something and oh like and we're not here long enough to get that out of us brother Dale ain't that's right maybe you have already got your glorified body but I'm still in my flesh body and so I I'm dealing with the Badgers we haven't got no crop PL and it's going to rain on Wednesday and I'm thinking uh it's soon going to be June it's could freeze in September fation will it make any difference at all I'll still be who I am and if I ain't here it won't make no difference at all if I made it anything the government would take half of it and if I don't make anything I'd probably have enough to eat and if I didn't eat for a while they'd be all right too right but because of that thought pattern Satan has robbed our ability to be who we were ordained and predestinated to be oh whoa God help me vex ation of spirit and there is no profit under the sun he and he did spiritual things too verse 17 in chapter two therefore I hated life now I'm not telling you to go quite that far I think we can enjoy life and we can enjoy our families but I'll tell you I'm going to just drop a bombshell and all you older people know this the only thing that you're getting in life besides serving God is your relationships with family and your children and and your grandchildren and each other if you got friends you're blessed if you got friends that you can do anything with even on Christian friends you're blessed you got somebody sits across from the table and nods once in a while when you're sitting there you're blessed amen for therefore I have hated life because the work that is Rod Under the Sun is Grievous to me now you can mock Samuel all you want but you're not not going to be as bright as him when you die that's right for all is Vanity and vexation of spirit now he is mentioning this dozens and dozens and dozens of times Verse 18 and yay I have hated all my labor which I have taken Under the Sun now he built the Tabernacle how could he say that if was temporal it was temporal even though it was beautiful and it was God's will it was still temporal amen because I shall leave it unto a man that shall be after me watch this watch watch Samuel was talking about inheritance here now and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or even a fool how many times do people you know Google will tell you the government knows that one generation makes it the the Next Generation lives it and the third one blows it and then the fourth generation's on welfare did it really matter yay shall yay shall he have rule over all my labors wherein I have labored and wherein have I showed myself under the sun he said this also is Vanity and I'm just like wow anybody wants to give me counseling after that would be perfectly fine CU I think I need it you know we're in a state now and and you know I mentioned this some on Wednesday night which it was amazing we are in a state even the Believers where where people are not their conscience are becoming seared now and I and and I understand that you all individually have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it is your protector don't get rid of it don't get rid of it but we have made a message of knowledge and the message is the truth it is Christ the anointed one but in the next couple weeks I'm going to preach on the absolute and I know before I preach on it cuz God's already told me that you will Flinch and I'm going to quote the prophet and see all of the message is Christ but we don't take all of the message let me give you just a sneak Pew brother B said that the the Jesus was the man of God and Christ was that's a direct quote a direct quote I mean I might be off a word he said Jesus now this is Jehovah he was born sinless he had the fullness on where am I going in this he had the fullness of the godhead bodily 100% he's right full I just got a I got a as flee we have a part so we're connected we're the the diamond he was like the monster diamond and they just chipped me off and I was the I was the powder dust okay and your Prophet said the fullness of the godhead bodily said that Jesus spoke in riddles and that the disciples couldn't understand them because your Prophet said that sometimes it was just the man talking and it didn't mean nothing and sometimes it was Jehovah God talking and that was the fullness of the godhead bodily Born sinless tabernacled In the Flesh if anybody like that quote after I got it print right off of my desk you're not going to come to me after and say he never said that cuz I got it memorized now if that's possible that our Prophet knew that about God is it possible about Prophets and pastors and five-fold ministers that's the message see many people connected around the message have the godhead wrong and the Bible and the prophet preached it perfect he said I'm not a trinitarian and a tarian but I'm not one like my finger the flesh is in heaven heaven and earth don't inherit the Flesh and Blood don't inherit the Kingdom of Heaven God could care less about the flesh that was tabernacled in Christ he just used it and threw her down God is a spirit and you worship Him worship in in spirit and truth so brother Dale is going to be loaded with mistakes I'm going to speak in riddles and you're going to go I don't know about what would that be any less in Jesus himself so I read that scripture when brother Thomas was here there's there's 99 false pastors and they're nothing but Kingdom Builders and money Grabbers but if there's them there's a real that's got the heart of Christ amen and you have to get a revelation the Bible says all them labor M that even though that somebody was speaking riddles and you say well I would never do oh boy see me you have to understand to see of the heart of Christ and to see on the word of God that's that's just where amen now that's that's I'm not supposed to go there but we're not we're see we're we're so entren and I'm not trying to take you out of the truth amen am I do I do I have some of you with me I'm just trying to take you of the falls I'll show you both sides and in the middle and three sides between but I promise God I'll never be a separan over here and I'll never be here and here amen and so we see in Acts 2:37 here's Peter preaching and this is something that happens very little in message churches I'm so wor to insult you I'm insulting myself too I have to watch it myself and when they heard these words they were pricked like yeah bless God I already have my Revelation I know exactly everything that I'm ever supposed to know nobody can teach me anything so nobody's ever pricked nobody's ever pricked when I preach on the absolute I'll show you I I matter of fact I'll put them up there the quotes of the prophet of your prophet of our Prophet the truth we'll put both sides up put everything up we got a lifetime till he comes and gets us but you know it's the truth there'll be some well I lean this way and I lean this way I kind of you know what let me give you a confession this confession is good for the soul confess was good for the soul you know brother Brown said about eight times he mentioned about one thing and and if I hear a Minister preach I cringe on it but brother Ram said about eight about 8 to 10 times about the church building now now I believe most of us would agree and if you don't it's it's all right I'll maybe catch up to you but most of us would agree that brother Brown's Revelation was Progressive so when I look in the message Hub and I I read this verse and I go to the message Hub you know what brother Dale does if it comes up and it's like 50 or more if I can't read all the quotes I scroll to 65 and I read them backwards I'm not saying the first part A I'm just saying if I don't have time to read 99 quotes I'm going to read the 50 from after the seals because I know our Prophet said that the Bible changed to him after the seals and if it changed to him it changed to me okay so I like I will read lots of ones from before but I'm just saying and brother Bram so this is just a confession and and you can throw this out and we'll go on with our thing but brother Braham said a bunch of times early in his ministry that we'll be here when they close up the door and throw away the key and make it warehouses but he sold the last time he said it and maybe even the second last time he said they'll never do that we'll be gone in the Rapture before they do now which one you want to believe I know which one I'm going to believe now you have the right to believe everything you want you can't believe both of them cuz they're not the same but I'm going to go he's all right sister Dom he's help come on up here and help me preach buddy you look a lot better than me anyway uh uh he's perfectly fine uh we finally got somebody running the aisles amen hey watch this you see what I'm saying the prophet here came with the God was dealing with them and maybe it will be but is it edifying to tell you they're going to lock us out of the church church or would you rather go in the Rapture before the lock us out of the church and that's after the seals I mean I'm not trying to make this something that's not I'm not trying to go off the word is everybody comfortable with that but I'm just showing you the whole picture and so I've sat and heard ministers say oh bless God they're going to lock up the church you're all going to be locked home we're never going to be able to talk to each other and that might happen but I'm going to preach on the other one so if you have problem with that you know you might consider and the reason I'm doing that is after the seals it's after the seals it's right before he went home he had the full Revelation that don't mean I'm not saying now there but the message is full of things the godheads full of things like that and so we get entrenched in our Doctrine we say oh bless God that that nobody's going to change me bless God I've been sitting in this Pew for 45 years and so we're never pricked we're never pricked we I can I can tell you anything you want very few of you go out here and be pricked because we've seared our conscience we we said this is the absolute and I've covered it up with concrete and I ain't moving I can tell you a few things the prophet said about that said if you stop learning you stop closing up your heart and you close up your heart to Revelation that and God gives you a gift you don't use it no God will take the little bit you got he'll take that one flea that I got and he'll go he'll take that one little talent I got that I buried and he'll give it to somebody that won't bury it amen I don't know where that came from but man I'm just saying God help us that like like listen church this is what I'm saying we don't want I have no desire to be off I have no desire to get to heaven and say you like to me oh boy so boys with Amazing Grace that's amen if I have just eat Branch water here but I want the truth I want the full truth and even even if as a minister even if I show you both sides and you consider for your household maybe you'll lean just a little bit different than I'll tilt there that's okay that's right but I'm not just going to preach in this ditch when there's another ditch over here wow God help us watch in Deuteronomy 14 I I got to speed up here and I got some amazing things the prophet said Deuteronomy 14 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord ha chosen thee To Be A peculiar people unto yourself now I want to stop there and show you something you know the prophet when he preached about being peculiar we're actually supposed to be almost almost loose cannons you know how the prophet preached that in the 9 it's a good thing you're sitting down because you're going to fall down he almost preached that you were almost supposed to live like a gypsy because this world ain't our home I I got that quote it's right here in my Dandy I'm coming to and Above All Nations that are upon the Earth see we're peculiar people here in First Peter 2:9 and I'm just going fast 1 Peter 2:9 and anybody can take anything I have here or say but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that shall show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of the darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen what are we doing getting so connected with the world now like I understand you need the house warm so you don't freeze to death I I know that I I'm not preaching be a gypsy but I'm I'm just leaning this way because amen everybody's locked into young people are getting locked into 25 and 30y year mortgages and they can't serve God for the 30 years they got the mortgage and when they get done they're going to die the next year does it matter you know if you know my uncle used to say this and I I'm just trying to bring this in perspective he said you know and he died many years ago I was a young man and he died when we were married and uh he said you know right when you're able to farm or do something you die and I I think myself I said you know I got I got I think 8 years or 7 and A2 years left on my mortgage I said you know when I finish my mortgages on farming I could really kick up my heels and I'll be doing good if I can just walk it won't you know all that stuff that I did it won't really matter and if my kids didn't use it it would be just cuz the next guy bows it down and put it in a pile and I'm like why why did we do that the Bible talks about lay up your Treasures where moth and rust do not corrupt and thieves do not break through and steal they're the only things that's going to last forever now like yes we have to you know and I'm in favor of inheritance and you know all the but but we're we're different I I I want to get to this quote let me read another scripture here you see here Abraham we got some examples you know Abraham was promised something and he was Abraham was living like a Gypsy by the way he is your spiritual father Okay and like this is no insult to God or Abraham but like would you do what he did he left everything he knew and all the Comforts of home go live in a tent with a bunch of strangers where he didn't know he was pumping his water or nothing we would call those people that driving around the van with Windows in it and don't have a barber very often and do you know Abraham never received the full promise until he separated from all this unbelief lot because what did lot want you want to be related to lot he wanted the wealth and ease of Sodom I mean they had streets praise God the lights come on at night woohoo and if it hadn't been for Abraham lot would have been uh-huh Hebrews 118 and10 let's read this by the face of Abraham when he was called to go out to a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing now here's the Gypsy not knowing whether he went but by faith he sojourned in a Land Of Promise as a strange C in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him the same of the promise and for he looked for a city whose Builder foundations whose Builder and maker was God you know if you want the peace that that last song was talking about that Jared sng you'll be thinking about over there a lot more than whether the church gets it or not you'll be thinking about over there you know it it affects you when you get to that when people your age start dying my brother says you know half the people I went to elementary school they're already dead you know it kind of lowers your expectations about building your kingdom cuz somebody else is going to be living in it here I'm just going to bite press this here just the top of this quote here brother Braham talking to saying he said when you become a missionary as myself and he said you've been in different countries amen and his wife says well you been in so many different nations and he said well aren't we Americans and she said oh no honey we're not Americans and he said we're seeking aity you Builder makers God he said I went to Finland and I seen the way the finlands acted and I went down to Germany and I seen the way the German Spirit was and I went down to to Sweden and all these places in the spirit and we have an American Spirit and she said well well well what about us he said I got a Heavenly spirit amen God help us here in Hebrews 13 14 and 15 it says for we here have no continuing City but we seek one to come but him therefore let us offer a sacrifice of praise unto God continually that is the fruits of our lips giving thanks unto his name we're so concentrated we're so we we have such a burden of living our life that we can't even live our spiritual life to the to the to the the biblical aspect of what God you know and and and uh wow God help us God help us you know and we can't help it like sometimes you will have jobs where you got politics in the workplace it's just garbage the word politics the definition in the dictionary is garbage it just I it's for me anyway amen it don't matter if it's at work or wherever it is it's just you know what I mean and we have all these things that are in our mind and our hopes and dreams and and we're so concentrated in all this that if God was to speak for us it'd take a tornado because we're never Qui enough to listen 1 John 2 1 John 25-1 17 I'm trying to hurry love not the world nor the things of the world the things of the world that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that are in the world and the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of the of God AB light is forever now I want to show you something we think this is actually Sinners that are coving the worldly things and lust and all the things no this is talking about godly people this is talking about godly people that come to church and they never enter into the worship in the proper way that they're supposed to and they could God could never have them speak in tongues or prophesy ever because they're like a ah if the phone ain't beeping in their lap it's beeping in their head you can't wait for me to shut up and go home and and go brother Dale's been there I might even still be there some things John 18 and so we we looked at Abraham and Abraham here Jesus Jus gave Abraham Jesus you know it's funny when we look back at history we we think oh Abraham he's my hero and oh praise God that was really awesome God sent that's cuz you know the end of the story but most of you sitting here this morning if you were Abraham you would have had some thoughts twice before you packed if you don't think so just be ready to pack and come anywhere I go this winter you oh I like I'm not I'm not see you and the went cuz if you're afraid to go to the mission field you would have did what Abraham did oh [Laughter] well maybe I don't have the money did God ask Abraham if he had the money maybe I I don't know where if there'll be fresh water when I get there did God ask brother Abraham if there' be fresh water there what's the Bible say don't even consider sitter don't even take an extra pair of clothes well who's going to buy for my ticket don't even consider that God owns got on Thousand see are you Abraham's seed what I'm trying to show you is Abraham did something out dare out dare he left all the known and Comforts to go he didn't know the end of the story he didn't know the end of the story he just believed and maybe brother Dale's not there yet I'm working on it you know what I'm saying are you there yet that's up to you and God but you see what I mean here here Jesus answered in John 18:36 and I'm trying to hurry Jesus here here Jesus answered and said my kingdom is not this world and if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would fight so you know every Church bottle that there ever was when people fought because they're not converted cuz you're not mine and I'm not yours and and none of this is anybody's cuz it's all God's and I mean everything that God gave us he gave us and even if it is yours it ain't yours because you wouldn't had it if you wouldn't give you breathe to work to go get it and so yeah you know it really really brings everything in perspective well bless God well this building's mine oh yeah well try to pay for it without God's blessing just try to to to to increase your breath one hour from now that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence now now this is who we call Our God I I think if we did the reverse math on that that means we would have to have the same Doctrine as him you know and and not and I'm not preaching against having jobs CU don't come to me and tell me you got a bill to pay next month cuz you quit cuz then I'd have to do something different but but you see what I'm saying we're so consumed you know brother Ben when he was here and he was preaching on the gifts and he said you know one way the gifts come is when you get lost when you Worship in such a way and your lost and your worship turns into a prophecy or your worship turns into the gifts of tongues because you're completely Stone drunk when's the last time you seen somebody Stone Drunk In Worship it's cuz you couldn't get there because you had all this hay in the way yet had all this clutter you know what I'm saying I mean I mean some of us do and and I mean but and it's wonderful when we get there but what we get there more often you know the Bible says you know that's why I don't have a trouble with the little ones you but you know Jesus said that unless we become like little children see like the little kids they're not they could care less if you make the payment on the vehicle they don't understand what we understand said now we they need us because they would get hungry but look at the other side Jesus said you got to come like them to even get there that means I'm not thinking about anything I could care less if I plant my crop I could care less if I go to work Monday I don't even care if I lose my job this is almost ridiculous you don't think I I I I'm losing you let me scroll to the bottom here here brother Brown said in the 60s in the end of 60s 6 almost 61 he said how Christian should live so we really a real born again Christian should almost be a Wanderer you thought I was just banking that up a gypsy they're not somebody I look up to but you you know uh in the sight of the world he should be a now this is what the prophet said a renegade I wouldn't look up to that person either but in the sight of God he's precious you see see see where I'm trying to go with this our Prophet said stuff like like this said we're brother Dale is so consumed in my world that and you're get consumed in your world Amen now that is on a 6509 111e so I can give that to you it's right on my iPod God help us you know God brother Brown talked about the the slave when the guy came to buy the slave amen and you know the story of that and everybody wanted to buy the one slave and he said well no no he he he's not for sale they're all for sale but it's like Tim he might consider selling some of his cows because cows are right off the charts and uh I'll never live long enough to ever see that money recouped ever by three generations and so when he picks out the one he's not going to pick out his favorite one he's not going to pick out the one he go out the passion just wrap his arm around scratch your oh baby you know just lay down here beside me and she lays down beside him so if you came to buy that one he'd say what she's not for sale and that was like this slave and they said well you give him special treatment now Tim don't give his cow special treatment he just wrecks all of them by spoiling them and they all become complete babies if they're any kind of a human being at all or an animal being but then there's some that are just hard t Akers and maybe they throw their weight around a bed or something now those are the ones that and you know the story better than I do about the slave and they said well you treat them different you know you do all these things different he said no I don't do them different he said but I found out that in his country his daddy's the king and even though he's a iant and we're not Canadians and we're just in Wyoming this morning but it's not our town you know we're just kind of we're Drifters Drifters you know that's really different for me you know we our families put down deep roots Lan's grandparents put down deep roots I mean they were property people they never moved or went anywhere they didn't even know what an airplane was they were born within one mile of the place they died you know they were just likeo they were territorial wolves and brother Brown says to be a Wanderer I'm just like what are you talking about amen but because his daddy was a king even though he was enslaved and away from home he carried himself like royalty he acted so much different that they wouldn't sell him amen God help us God help us to be like that amen and we see this scripture you know where it talks about the uh you know making our calling and election sure brother Braham said in the message Hub that's connected to that scripture that you have a decision to make and we talked about Abraham had a choice to make Abraham made a choice Jesus had a choice to make Jesus in the Bible went to pray in the garden and he said father if you could take this cup from me I don't want to die I'm I'm so under pressure from the Earthly Kingdom I'm sweating blood that's hard for me to even comprehend I know I know that's leg legitimately possible I know people that when they got the flu before they would throw up that blood would commot their sweat glance because they were so Under Pressure they were just going to blow up and then they would throw up but there was another person in the Bible we think oh well you know not a big deal you know I would have did the same thing no you wouldn't have and that was Moses yeah because we know the end of the story we think oh yeah yeah he's a great hero he's an awesome he was a cilona he would have maybe been the next pharaoh of Egypt he was the adopted son he would have had at the very at the very least when Pharaoh died he would have been second in command if not first he was a hero they were the rulers of the world they were the Hitlers of the world do you know my daddy told me I remember clearly you know before all this internet stuff I remember when the cord war was on and and where they were putting the missiles outside of Florida uh Russia F uh what was it Cuba Cuban Missile I remember my daddy listening to the radio and and there was a few days there that was just kind of like touchwood you know and he was really affected by it I I remember I could tell you where he was sitting in the house listening to the radio and you know he talked about World War II his brothers fought in World War II and he said you know there was a long time where nobody knew who would win MH now if you go back and read history you know you can tell that it was for sure Hitler would lose cuz he just never had the resources and and is you know but Moses could have had a walk in the park in Egypt he could have had women and maids and money and luxury and plush and everything plush plush and they put him in the mud pit because of a choice I'm not so sure we would have had to have a time out on that decision you know if you don't think so you just you know you know there's people that would have a life like you you know and they literally pick up uh the brother that died uh sister kassy's Dead uh Ray Maddox he was one like that you know when we went to the Philippines a huge percentage of the pastors I mean a huge percentage 70 80% said I got saved under his ministry huge I I seen Stone blind pastors that read the Bible on Braille come to the pulpit and nestor's church and his son and his son led him to the pulpit and preached he said I was saved under Ray maddox's sermons rayax left everything you have to go to the mission field for nothing for absolutely nothing nothing and his kids thought he was insane and they were right don't be shocked they were right you would have thought he was insane by Earthly standards you act surprised that's how we think you're not going to leave what you got and just move somewhere and and just said nothing I don't even believe he had a pension or nothing it was just it was just like I'm just going and eating whatever and we seen oh man I don't tens and tens of if not hundreds of ministers or well seral was saved under Ray maddox's Ministry because he did something that most of us would choke on because he under because some of these people like Moses they understood like I don't care if you live to be hundred it's coming soon I'm finding out a few things like that I'm fin not a few things like that this is just a blur and all that matters is what you've done for Christ is the only thing that'll matter it won't matter if you have gold nickels or it won't matter what you know we went to a funeral just uh just this week a little boy got killed you know in a farm accident I told lanne you know we we uh we think of things like this when we you know get over the hill you know and uh uh we we have a couple thoughts you know we tell the kids but one is don't spend no money just 100 bucks get rid of us and sprinkle Us in the flower garden or something kick the tires and keep on trucking but like this funeral the casket was 100% white one piece of Steel on it I seen of any kind I said there's a smart person you see people that put $10,000 casket oh like what like who are we trying to impress hello it's going to go in the mud and rot that's called the new kind of oh bless God I would never no if I would have had the full decision on my daddy and and for me I you can buy cardboard caskets I'm dead does it matter when you're dead you're dead but oh well you know they were better people than that so let's just who we trying in press and the prophet said in this scripture in the message up he said Moses made a lot better decision than the Rich Young Ruler kind of makes your perspectives change now I'm not you know like I said I put a disclaimer like don't everybody go out and quit their jobs and come back we're not communal living you know I suppose you couldn't grow a garden out our place but but are we Christians are we Christians like Abraham and Moses you think about that are we Christians like Jesus bless God if they step on my toes I'm going to line them up when what what would Jesus fight for he said I don't even have nothing to do with anything here and I could really say that I don't have nothing to do with anything now one thing here's mind I ain't taking nothing to M with me of my character and I'm working on that wow God help us no continuing City Moses decision paid off watch his Paul Bears the Bible said that they were angels He had a hot shot funeral and nobody could go find his don't either the Rich Young Ruler never had angels He had to pay his ball Bears Hallelujah God help us you see how the LIE of devil you know I almost wished I would have did the conversion differently but if I would have put the con version at $600 a day you would have been making about 30 cents a to 50 years ago so my daddy bless God when he was driving that C&H with no power steering and the the the muffler would would glow and it would be brighter than the lights when he was and he'd make $1 a day and get his dinner for free he was like three times as r rich as you are and it's because of the LIE of the devil the stuff you carry in your pocket it ain't worth the ink that it took to print it because we're so broke that the mounties sent a message to the federal government and they said when the citizens of Canada realize the debt per head or per household you'll have a Revolt in Canada your babies that aren't even born know like a h 100,000 ones you're holding in your arms and the average household debt is close to a half a million I believe we think who and we're we're not going to be here anyway amen it just it just you know it just changes things you think about you know Lan's got some family members dying I've lost a brother already another brother's on the verge of death L's lost some it just makes you think what are we doing are we doing what we're supposed to be doing Matthew 6 and I I'm going to close here soon forgive me for wabbling on lay not up your lay up not for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust thus corrupt and where thieves do break through and steal but lay out for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust do scrup and where thieves do not break through and steal and where your treasure is there is your heart also the Light of the body is the eye and if therefore thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of dark Darkness if therefore the light if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness oh how great is that Darkness God help us God help us if you just don't mind I would finish with a few quotes here now we're alien in this world you're an alien because you're profess plainly by by your actions that the city who Builder and maker is God and you're no longer care for these things of the world but you're a Heavenly bound people that's looking for a city that the world didn't build you know the prophet preached on the these are all in the message Hub connected to these scriptures uh praise God for the people that made the message Hub the they were wonderful it is the one most it every single one of you I don't young older and different you need the message help if God blesses you with the scripture you can just punch on that and read everything the prophet said on that one verse it's a blessing it's a blessing it's it's a blessing for devotions everything he said you know most of the greatest Kingdoms in the world you have to dig down 20 ft to even find the top of the rooftops because because they're buried like pharaoh and Rome and different things like this they're completely covered all because there's no continuing city on earth he said we don't have to be like this you know here we're talking we don't have to have these spots and and I'm I'm I'm really winding her down here but it's a spirit that gets on us now if this might not be for you it's a spirit that gets on brother Dale there you can all point at me because of Television newspaper and I don't have television news but that's the same as on your phone television newspaper advertisement and then there's a really bake word that someday they might put me in jail for and that's propaganda if the government's telling you something I'll just tell you what I know bless God you're a proud Canadian but I'm not I'm not a proud Canadian if the Govern Canadian government's telling you something it's a lie it it's just it don't matter what come out of their mouth if their mouth open and they're the Canadian government it's a lie they're misleading brainwashing indoctrinate and disinformation is off the charts now you know who owns the freedom of press in Canada Pierre amen I'm not trying to be a downer I'm just trying to shake you and say what you're putting your hopes in are I mean maybe you maybe see this but so I'm just preaching to myself they're a joke amen I I want to just share something with you and and and and I'm not I'm not a politician I could care less if you ever vote it won't make no difference we're Christians but I just recently found out you know the leader of the World Health Organization which our government's already voted on it and probably they will hide it from us for 10 years and then they'll sabotage us kick us in the knee or a little higher but all the countries of the world voting to make them have ultimate control of your health every country that's Insanity that's actually a One World Government already cuz that means anybody that you elect have no say on the health of your government that vote already happened or is happening in May but the leader of the World Health Organization and was the leader during covid is a member of a US acknowledged terrorist group and a whole bunch of other stuff and they said and he's not a med he has less medical training than I have just let that sink in for a minute you know how much medical training has zero and he's a member of terrorist groups that are on my phone I I took the pictures of it and they are contemplating right now I'm not trying you scary I'm telling you brother Dale needs a Rapture cuz like insanity is getting very close to my mind of having a worldwide vaccination to fight climate change now if you believe that I have a farm to sell you and there's diamonds and gold in it and it's right on top of the ground see our Prophet said that the world would go completely insane we don't have to wait for that no longer we've already arrived we've already arrived amen I just have two quotes left here if you're born of the spirit of God you don't have the kind this kind of spirit the spirit that comes from above is Holiness Purity and cleanness God why I can't make people see that you have to be born from above and when you're from above and come here to the Earth you're a pilgrim that means you're not at home here it's not your home this is not not your home that's a direct quote this is not your home you don't belong here and we're just sojourning here but our home is above and we seek a city whose Builder and maker is God and that's the reason we're peculiar to the world and that's the reason the spirit of God gets into the meetings into the meetings and makes peculiar things happen because we're peculiar people now if you wanted to do reverse math on that like they teach you in school if there's not peculiar things happening maybe we're not peculiar but I know we are and so I pray that God will take brother Dale by the shoulders and go amen if you wanted some counsel from me make sure you do something you enjoy and do it with friends and family and enjoy every single day that when you go on a trip I tell my kids I'm going on a trip very soon that you've had the fullness and there will be no regrets because you've enjoyed the fullness of life here on Earth and if brother Dale ain't here next Sunday any one of you brother brother Carson brother Matt Jared brother Bernard and Tim you got five ministers that can just wrot rotate right through here woohoo all I'm I'm dead serious listen to me I'm telling you the truth if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're opt to teach with no warning it won't be like brother Dale it won't be like Ben norrod it'll be like you because God liked you and he filled you with the Holy Spirit and he wants you just like you are he don't want you to look like a clown and try to be something different it don't matter what the delivery is if it's the word of God it's God period don't matter if it's kre digs or Ben nood or Peter Chandler they were as different as the weather is but they were God's servants amen man we don't don't build don't build your Hope on the church over brother Dale because brother Dale might take a holiday I don't even maybe know I have it booked but God maybe knows I have it booked and for goodness sake don't cry about it are you kidding I'll be I'll be crying for you if that's possible we need to understand these things they things like that hey enjoy each other we're actually friends amen last quote and it takes something to satisfy the inside of you what is it that pours down from God into your soul I love it I can't get a feeling firing like I can get serving God I'll just tell you what when the power of the Holy Spirit comes down you can drive that tractor till you become a tractor and it never feel the same as the power of the holy spirit it's the Deep calling to the Deep it's the noise of the water about oh Lord he said it's your deep call Un the Deep that's with inside me let's stand amen oh hallelujah thank you Lord God Amen thank you Lord God oh I pray that I I pray that that's balanced you know we have to you know we have to pay our bills and we have to do a few things to get a few nickels and dimes and that but it's okay to check with God Amen God God help us you know we sing things and we believe things and I I I pray you'll meditate on that you know this been burning me up for months months just burning me out nothing's permanent here if the Rapture don't happen brother Dale's going to go another way and it won't it will make very little different Earthly stuff am man very little different it'll make it a little easier for the kids but all we can do for him it's the only thing that'll matter it's it's all about Christ it's it's I'm telling you when you when you you know it don't matter who you are when you become and you're the end of your life you're not thinking what am I going to do to build my kingdom it's a completely different thought God help us God help me God help me you know when I was young it used to be how many acres can I farm how many cows can I feed I love feeding cows I tell you what I'll take care of all the cows in heaven it will be no problem it's just a pleasure and a joy those thoughts have all changed they they've it's it's it scares me some days it's changed that much because I'm seeing something differently I'm I'm looking pass I'm thinking oh wow God help us God help us as we close I forgot and thank you honey um Pastor Samuel from Ottawa asked me this week um to let them know as best we can all that will be going to Ottawa camp or Retreat that's out there it's a far poster um just from whatever I am to you your friend or Pastor or enemy or whatever it's a beautiful campsite you will never in your light brother Matt is it beautiful it's a beautiful campsite the fire pits dug in the hill with like two or three rows of like baked laminated stone and you got to have a 100 people sit around the fire pit you can't sit around the fire pit unless you got your back to the lake and the Silver Creek Lake is right up front they have not that a whale like me would go down it but they have like 150 ft slide that literally they put water in and it's a beautiful Lake you can go canoeing uh the the even the cafeteria is beautiful it's antique I love antiques if you don't know that so it's old and decrepit but it's always been a cafeteria it's beautiful beautiful beautiful and the sanctuary has padded seats and it's air conditioned because it's brand new until we get too big for it and they actually said
