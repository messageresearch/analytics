[19:31] man just had a a wonderful week
[19:34] fellowshipping with God
[19:36] man and just the Revelation and I just
[19:39] feel like
[19:41] I just feel like he was brand new almost
[19:44] just things that he showed me
[19:48] I don't deserve
[19:50] just beautiful amen and
[19:54] I Pray by his grace that we can share
[19:57] them together amen but I'll tell you
[19:59] something
[19:59] you're serving a magnificent God
[20:03] man he is he is literally
[20:06] more than your mind can comprehend
[20:10] and uh we just pray something man
[20:13] Praise Him amazingly you know you know I
[20:16] want to say this before we turn to our
[20:18] text you know
[20:20] I mentioned in communion that God
[20:22] operates in a period of time
[20:25] I'm going to show you more of those
[20:27] periods of times
[20:30] and God always shows himself first
[20:32] before judgment
[20:34] and you know
[20:37] the same angel that came to Peter
[20:41] and the people were healed by saddle
[20:44] was the exact same angel
[20:47] that came to Paul and they were healed
[20:49] with handkerchiefs
[20:51] and it can be the exact same God that
[20:53] comes to you
[20:55] when the preacher and the word Goes
[20:56] Forth
[20:58] and you're sitting in your seat
[21:00] brother Brown said that
[21:02] he said that was the Gentile way
[21:05] the Jews way
[21:07] was laying on of hands
[21:10] but God's bride
[21:12] had more faith
[21:14] amen and I it's it's just this Bible it
[21:18] literally just exploded to me this week
[21:20] and I just feel
[21:23] overwhelmed and and blessed and and I'm
[21:27] going to try to portray that to you this
[21:29] is probably part one of probably part
[21:32] three at least
[21:34] at least part three of the Gentile
[21:37] dispensation
[21:40] and the bright time
[21:42] the Gentile dispensation in the bright
[21:45] time let's turn to Daniel 12. 4 8 and 9
[21:49] just to save time and I want to show you
[21:52] and and different things that and I have
[21:55] messaged things I might read some quotes
[21:57] at the end but you know the two books of
[21:59] the Bible that are the greatest book if
[22:03] you're part of the Bride this morning
[22:05] it's Daniel Revelations
[22:09] because both of them
[22:11] were who God is
[22:14] not in the written form do you know and
[22:16] this is oh I I got to read my scripture
[22:19] I'm going to start preaching
[22:20] amen
[22:23] but thou Daniel
[22:24] shut up the words
[22:26] seal the book even to the time of the
[22:29] end for many shall run to and fro
[22:33] and knowledge
[22:35] shall be greatly increased
[22:37] Oh Glory
[22:40] let's go to eight just let's go to eight
[22:42] sorry you can read this all but let's
[22:45] just jump to eight and then tonight
[22:46] verse 8.
[22:48] and I heard but I understood not
[22:51] and I said and then said I O Lord that
[22:56] what shall be the end of these things
[23:02] and he said go thy Way Daniel
[23:06] for the words are closed up
[23:09] and sealed
[23:11] Until the End Lord Jesus
[23:14] we we surely invite you in this place it
[23:17] would be a great disappointment Lord if
[23:20] your beautiful Holy Spirit wasn't here
[23:23] and we pray for your anointing to fall
[23:25] on us not just the speaker Lord Jesus
[23:28] but I pray this morning more than ever
[23:31] before that your anointing would fall on
[23:33] the hearer and may they see Christ
[23:37] magnified in its bright and the the
[23:40] Mysteries how they are gone in our day
[23:44] and it was sealed up
[23:47] until our day and Lord Jesus we just
[23:50] pray that
[23:51] you you will help the speaker to show
[23:54] and the revelations
[23:57] of Who You Are
[23:58] to your bride in your name we pray amen
[24:02] amen God bless you and you may have your
[24:04] seat see so we need to have open minds
[24:07] when I say open minds I don't mean to
[24:09] break the word of God or or to uh come
[24:12] outside the word of God but you see how
[24:14] God came to Peter
[24:16] and Peter had so much of God that the
[24:19] people just walked by him as the sun
[24:21] shined on them
[24:22] and they were miraculously healed
[24:26] and you would think well God's exactly
[24:28] the same yesterday today and forever and
[24:30] that he is
[24:32] but God came to a different vessel and
[24:35] the exact same God in the exact same
[24:38] Holy Spirit took a handkerchief
[24:41] and prayed over it
[24:43] said take this home
[24:45] and lay it on your sick one
[24:49] they'll be made well
[24:51] there's so many times this morning we
[24:53] miss God because we put them in a box
[24:56] and we say well my God can't do this
[25:00] and if you believe that he can't
[25:04] amen
[25:06] oh it's so magnificent you know the
[25:09] prophet said when Daniel went in the
[25:12] Lion's Den
[25:13] it wasn't Daniel that kept the lions
[25:16] from meeting him
[25:18] it wasn't his prayer
[25:21] it wasn't that they had fed the dyings
[25:23] before because that wasn't the truth
[25:28] it was the pillar of Fire
[25:32] the same pillar fire that was over
[25:33] brother bram's head
[25:36] was actually tabernacled in Daniel
[25:41] and lions
[25:43] are afraid of Fire
[25:46] and you say well how could that be that
[25:48] the Lions would be afraid of Fire
[25:50] and that same fire would be in Daniel
[25:53] and all over Daniel to the point that
[25:55] the Lions could see it and smell it
[25:59] but I want to burn Daniel
[26:01] I'm glad you asked because that same
[26:04] pillar of a fire came in a bush
[26:07] to a prophet named Moses
[26:09] and he looked on upon it he looked upon
[26:12] God Christ and he said I can't
[26:15] understand
[26:16] why this bushes are burning up
[26:23] God
[26:25] God's showing himself
[26:29] to us
[26:30] in the pillar of Fire
[26:33] and you'll see this so much through the
[26:36] scriptures
[26:38] so much through the scriptures you know
[26:42] we're part of the Gentile age the
[26:45] gentile people
[26:47] and I'm sure glad I am
[26:50] I'm glad that I don't have to go through
[26:53] the tribulation
[26:55] and be a part of the foolish virgin
[26:58] because I'm a Jew
[27:00] amen
[27:02] I want to show you something this
[27:04] morning we've heard preachers our whole
[27:06] life tell us
[27:07] the Christ is coming
[27:10] remember the period of time
[27:13] he is coming
[27:15] but I'm going to show you today
[27:19] in the scriptures
[27:20] and with our prophet
[27:23] that he is as much here right now
[27:28] today
[27:29] this morning as he'll actually be when
[27:32] he comes in his Corporal body and a
[27:34] rapture
[27:36] he won't be here no more
[27:39] and the Bible says that
[27:41] in Revelation 10.
[27:43] oh it's beautiful see the Gentiles were
[27:47] EX
[27:48] -propriated kicked out of Israel
[27:51] because Israel was God's chosen people
[27:53] you'll see when Jesus came and the
[27:55] Gentile lady came to him Jesus himself
[27:57] said it's not me that I should give to
[28:01] dogs
[28:02] brother Dale this morning
[28:06] at that time
[28:07] was considered cannon fodder
[28:11] can you imagine
[28:13] and you know we can look and maybe we'll
[28:15] pull it up and I'm just going to
[28:16] paraphrase it you can show the
[28:17] scriptures but if you go to Romans 11 5
[28:20] and 5 to 7 and then Romans 11 and I'm
[28:23] just going to read what I have down
[28:25] paraphrase so I'm not going to read the
[28:26] scriptures exactly but because
[28:31] the Gentiles fell
[28:33] salvation came to us
[28:37] and in verse 20 he says well because of
[28:39] their own belief
[28:41] they were broken off you know how it
[28:43] talked about the tree and the actual
[28:45] natural Branch God took off
[28:48] this is Romans 11 and 20.
[28:52] but because of you Believing by faith
[28:56] he said
[28:57] and the end of that verse he said but
[28:59] don't never get high-minded
[29:02] but fear
[29:04] because the same God that took out the
[29:07] natural branch
[29:08] could take out the grafted in branch
[29:11] amen if we raised ourselves up
[29:15] got high-minded
[29:17] in on belief and in verse 21 it says for
[29:21] if God spare not the natural branches
[29:23] take heed lest he spare also not thee
[29:25] and in verse 22 he says in in Romans 11
[29:29] but he said behold therefore the
[29:30] goodliness of God
[29:33] to you and the severity of God to them
[29:38] that fell
[29:40] in unbelief
[29:42] severity to those to to unto them
[29:46] but goodliness unto thee if you continue
[29:50] in his goodliness that's his belief
[29:54] otherwise thou also
[29:57] shall be cut off
[29:59] God help us
[30:00] God's
[30:02] God has a plan amen
[30:04] and we see in the Bible
[30:06] you know God will never cut off his true
[30:08] bride and the reason he'll never do it
[30:10] is because she's a part of him it's
[30:13] beautiful amen and so we see that
[30:16] Abraham in the Bible was a gentile in
[30:19] and Abraham was God came to Abraham the
[30:22] beginning of see you know God came to
[30:25] his own and his own re received them not
[30:28] and so God left his eyes off the Jews
[30:31] they were blinded for a period of time
[30:33] so he could put his emphasis on the
[30:35] Gentiles and here in Daniel we know that
[30:38] Daniel was a Jew
[30:40] this is a paradox get this Daniel was a
[30:43] Jew but he was the first prophet to the
[30:46] Gentile age
[30:48] a Jew
[30:50] but a prophet to the Gentile age and
[30:52] here God came to Abraham and said get
[30:54] thee out of thy country and from the
[30:56] Kindred and from thy father's house
[30:59] and I'll take you to a land
[31:01] that I'll show you that's in Genesis 12
[31:04] 1. and we know in that that that uh
[31:08] Vision that God came to Abraham that
[31:11] prophecy that came to Abraham that that
[31:13] was the type of the Holy Ghost the Our
[31:15] Land our land that God's going to show
[31:18] you is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[31:20] we know that Abraham was not blessed
[31:22] until he completely separated from the
[31:26] world if you love the world or the
[31:27] things of the world the love of God
[31:29] cannot even be in you and the Bible
[31:31] talks about people that will not willing
[31:33] to leave your mom or your dad or your
[31:35] family or your town or your kindred
[31:38] for Christ Jesus
[31:40] and we know that in the Bible we're
[31:42] clearly a part of Abraham and we would
[31:44] call Abraham Our Father Abraham
[31:47] and spiritual scene
[31:50] Hallelujah and in this season
[31:54] Amen in Isaiah 61 Isaiah 60 and 1. it
[32:00] talks about he says arise and shine for
[32:03] your light has come
[32:06] and the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:09] it took his eyes off the Jews
[32:12] and it's made a shine on a gentile days
[32:15] and so we see when it came in the
[32:17] beginning and here when Daniel wrote the
[32:19] first book of Revelations he wrote
[32:22] Revelations before Revelations was wrote
[32:25] by Vision amen it's beautiful and it
[32:28] Revel what happened in Daniel exactly
[32:30] happened parallel some in some cases
[32:33] almost word for word verses and
[32:35] Revelation as God picked up as John as
[32:39] God gave the Same Spirit to John and he
[32:42] wrote it years later oh Hallelujah
[32:45] election the only election was part of
[32:49] the Bride the Gentiles saved by grace
[32:51] and but I want to show you something in
[32:54] this and the prophet talks about it in
[32:56] the seals and I I got some some some oh
[32:59] it's just beautiful amen
[33:02] Hallelujah
[33:04] but the Gentile dispensation started
[33:08] in a mystery
[33:09] and the reason it was a mystery is
[33:12] Daniel seen the Gentile dispensation
[33:14] from beginning to end our Prophet said
[33:16] that I had the quote where he says it
[33:18] I'm like and see
[33:21] God showed that all to Daniel before it
[33:24] happened
[33:25] and he said but
[33:26] brother Dale ain't been born yet
[33:30] Brothers here in Wyoming sisters haven't
[33:32] been put here yet born yet
[33:35] and he said seal it up because they're
[33:38] in my
[33:40] mind
[33:42] see the thoughts of God before the
[33:44] foundation of the world
[33:46] you were either there or you never will
[33:48] be there oh it's beautiful amen so here
[33:51] the Gentile ain't started in a mystery
[33:53] and and it was sealed up until the end
[33:55] but in this time
[33:57] you are a privileged people and in this
[34:00] time time will be no more
[34:03] amen you now watch this remember I said
[34:06] that time space of time
[34:10] you now I'm going to show it to you I'm
[34:11] going to prove it to you in the Bible
[34:13] the prophet you right now
[34:18] are living in eternity
[34:24] but you're not
[34:26] but you are
[34:28] you are
[34:29] your flesh isn't
[34:32] but you are
[34:33] watch whether watch all the scriptures
[34:35] and we're going to watch see you're a
[34:37] special class of people
[34:41] oh it's beautiful right let's look at
[34:44] this where Paul talks in second
[34:45] Corinthians 12 3 and 4 he said I knew
[34:48] not
[34:49] such a man whether in the body or out of
[34:52] the body I can't even tell
[34:53] by God knoweth
[34:55] and verse 4 he says but how
[34:58] how that he was caught up into paradise
[35:01] and heard the Unspeakable words
[35:06] sealed up
[35:08] which was not lawful for a man to utter
[35:12] because Wyoming hadn't happened yet
[35:15] the bride of Christ from around the
[35:18] world that hadn't all happened yet
[35:20] amen now Paul could not speak of it
[35:23] because it was unlawful and ball Paul
[35:25] wrote 14 books of the Bible
[35:28] but he couldn't tell you
[35:30] what he could tell you
[35:32] he couldn't tell you what he knew to
[35:34] tell you
[35:36] because the space of time that God was
[35:38] dealing in it
[35:40] it was at the beginning of that space of
[35:42] time
[35:43] and it hadn't come to pass yet
[35:46] but those things have all changed now
[35:49] oh it's beautiful
[35:52] Revelations 1 and 19.
[35:54] let's turn to that Amy
[36:00] here John writing he said write these
[36:03] things which thou has seen
[36:05] and the things which are God
[36:09] and which the things which should be
[36:13] Hereafter Revelations 19.
[36:17] here's God coming to John when he's on
[36:20] the island Apartments he said write it
[36:22] down
[36:28] but it was sealed
[36:31] because it wasn't the time let's just
[36:33] jump ahead in God's timepiece a phrase
[36:36] now let's go to Revelations
[36:39] 10.
[36:40] one to seven
[36:42] Hallelujah
[36:45] oh this is beautiful I I pray to God
[36:47] you'll get this
[36:50] amen
[36:52] Revelations 10 and I saw another Mighty
[36:55] Angel come down from heaven
[36:57] clothed with the cloud
[37:00] the church that's my message
[37:02] let's close and go home
[37:08] that verse
[37:10] tells you everything you need to know
[37:13] about the next four messages
[37:15] the mighty Angel was Christ
[37:21] and the John wrote Revelations
[37:24] but but who told them to write what he
[37:26] wrote God on the island of Patmos
[37:29] and he came down
[37:30] in a
[37:36] if you come down in a
[37:40] not
[37:41] now see what I said earlier I said he
[37:43] will be no more here when he comes in
[37:46] his Corporal body and we leave this
[37:48] earth
[37:50] then he is here
[37:52] today
[37:54] in our age and I'll read you some quotes
[37:57] at the end of the message that say that
[37:59] matter of fact
[38:01] I'll read them right now
[38:04] Revelations chapter 5 in the second
[38:07] paragraph in 61 here he says he says the
[38:11] days were finished and time had run out
[38:13] it was all over
[38:15] and time
[38:17] shall be no more the time of the
[38:19] mysteries of God
[38:21] we're over
[38:24] that's right now
[38:25] suckbook right now I'm just reading it
[38:28] in the quote the parts that I got
[38:29] highlighted and we're right now we're
[38:33] right now
[38:34] in the front yard if you want to know
[38:35] where this is found this is Revelations
[38:37] uh message uh paragraph 101 6106
[38:42] 18.
[38:44] he says we're right now
[38:46] in the front yard
[38:48] and he said here is them in Revelations
[38:52] 10.
[38:53] oh well that's what we got up on our
[38:55] screen
[38:58] and here the angel come down and he put
[39:00] a foot on the land
[39:02] and he put a put a foot on the sea and
[39:04] you know God is just amazing you know
[39:08] what the prophet said that God did when
[39:09] he put his foot on the land and put a
[39:12] foot in the sea
[39:13] it was stopping the spirits of Satan
[39:17] that would stop the move of God he had
[39:20] control of the land and he had control
[39:23] of the water
[39:24] and he was Jehovah Jireh oh it's
[39:28] beautiful
[39:29] Hallelujah and he said time
[39:33] had
[39:35] run up
[39:38] it's over
[39:39] it's over
[39:41] oh don't fear
[39:42] see God
[39:44] is Elohim
[39:46] and see he knows what's going to happen
[39:47] tomorrow
[39:50] keep that in mind it's over
[39:53] but he still knows what's happening see
[39:55] the Bible says he said see green not the
[39:58] Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed sealed
[40:01] sealed unto till when
[40:04] until it's over
[40:06] until your day of redemption so in God's
[40:09] mind it's already eternity
[40:12] amen now if you go to Romans 8 and I I'm
[40:15] jumping way out here so you got to help
[40:17] me come back but in Romans 8 about
[40:20] 20 I think it is
[40:22] it said those that he called he chose
[40:26] and he predestinated and he elected
[40:29] I'm not at the end of the verse it gets
[40:31] you really good
[40:33] all those people now who did that not
[40:36] brother Dale

[40:40] people that he predested me he chose
[40:42] called and he liked Ed
[40:44] that he already already
[40:47] past tense
[40:51] if you get this you're going to be
[40:53] really happy past tense he already
[40:55] glorified you what
[40:58] what you're all ready in God's mind it's
[41:02] already over
[41:05] is already in God's mind
[41:08] eternity
[41:10] it's already over
[41:12] it's completely over you're just like
[41:15] it's like it's like a play that you're
[41:18] playing in
[41:19] but you've already read the book
[41:22] there's no climax to the story
[41:25] because you already practice in the
[41:30] I don't mean that there's no climax but
[41:32] you see you already know see God because
[41:35] he's Elohim
[41:38] oh
[41:40] and this is no religion man this is this
[41:43] is Jehovah himself
[41:45] Hallelujah and Diamond ran out in the
[41:48] redempt Redemption is over and now he's
[41:51] coming as a lion the tribe of Judah and
[41:55] he was the lamb but now he comes as the
[41:58] lion is the tribe of Judah
[42:03] oh
[42:04] and here's where people
[42:07] God help me to explain this and there's
[42:10] more I'm going to commit this morning
[42:11] but this is where people
[42:16] go off
[42:19] brother Brown said
[42:21] that
[42:22] in in The Sixth Seal I'm going to give
[42:25] you lots of stuff and I'm going to read
[42:27] both sides brother Brown said in the
[42:30] Sixth Seal that Christ
[42:33] got off The Mercy Seat
[42:35] and walk to take Redemption and it was
[42:38] finished
[42:40] it's finished
[42:41] and you're saying
[42:45] whoa
[42:47] what about Brenner
[42:50] but what about your loved ones
[42:56] don't worry
[42:57] remember what we said unless you
[43:00] came to unbelief Jesus came to his own
[43:03] and his own refuse to not what was it on
[43:05] belief they never believed that he was
[43:08] Jehovah they believed he was
[43:10] illegitimately born from Mary and Joseph
[43:15] scripture thank you thanks for asking uh
[43:19] I thought his dad was a carpenter
[43:24] huh that's how they believe and the
[43:27] Bible says here when we write in
[43:29] Corinthians if you believe the same way
[43:33] the same thing will happen to you that
[43:35] happened to them he took a saw and he
[43:37] cut them off the tree
[43:41] so remember your unsaved loved ones
[43:43] and Brenner
[43:47] all you have to do is believe it
[43:49] because he said to the Jailer for you
[43:53] and you have to
[43:55] your household you say well how does God
[43:58] compare the house your household is as
[44:00] big as your house wants to be
[44:07] oh it's oh man you could just lose your
[44:09] mind preaching this hey man and see he
[44:12] said he said now then the lamb took the
[44:14] book and the four beats and the Four and
[44:15] Twenty others fell down and washed up
[44:18] the land the greatest thing we should be
[44:19] doing at this time in this time of
[44:22] Eternity is we need to be losing our
[44:25] mind worshiping God
[44:27] and I don't mean and show and I don't
[44:29] mean fake garbage and that I mean in
[44:32] genuine you're just locked out it's like
[44:34] horse blinders and you don't know who's
[44:37] beside you and who's in front of you
[44:39] and a semi car could go by you
[44:43] and you wouldn't even know it
[44:46] because you're just like wow
[44:49] and worship
[44:59] and now at this time everything must
[45:01] this is this that's what he said
[45:03] paragraph 20 102. he said now at this
[45:06] time
[45:08] for you the bride everything must be
[45:11] worshiped
[45:14] wow now remember
[45:16] and accept that
[45:18] now don't you let us miss that now
[45:20] listen close when all the mysteries of
[45:23] the church
[45:24] are finished
[45:26] and when all the Mysteries
[45:29] of the plans of redemption are finished
[45:33] and the Seven Seals are open right
[45:36] immediately after this now look and the
[45:39] time for everything in heaven and
[45:41] everything on Earth
[45:43] watches and when the seals were opened
[45:46] everything in heaven
[45:48] and everything in Earth
[45:51] worship God
[45:56] amen everything
[45:59] hallelujah amen now watch what takes
[46:02] place unless he said they sang a new
[46:05] song worthy are worthy listen to the
[46:09] worthy worthy are you Lord amen Jared
[46:11] didn't even have a clue what I was
[46:13] preaching but songs were just beautiful
[46:15] and going along with our thought amen
[46:18] today it was just amazing see how this
[46:21] was in Revelation 7. now let's just move
[46:23] on Amen so he came down
[46:30] from having clothes in the cloud and a
[46:33] rainbow was upon his face
[46:35] on his upon his head and his face was as
[46:38] it were the son and his feet
[46:42] and his feet remember I talked about
[46:44] fire and his feet
[46:48] kept the Lions away from Daniel
[46:52] uh we're Builders a buyer
[46:56] Hallelujah verse two
[46:58] Hallelujah
[47:01] and he's and he had in his hand a little
[47:04] book open and he sat the right foot upon
[47:08] the Sea and the left foot upon the Earth
[47:12] but see God was saying
[47:16] when he did that
[47:19] that I'm God
[47:21] you're gonna read it
[47:24] and I'm in control
[47:26] if your loved ones are living on the
[47:28] earth brother he's got her under control
[47:31] and if they're a lifetime seller and
[47:34] they never touch land he's got that
[47:35] under control too
[47:36] whoa oh it's good and he crowd with the
[47:41] loud voices one the lion roarth and when
[47:44] he had cried Seven Seals opened
[47:48] oh and don't say that but that's what
[47:50] happened
[47:51] because Thunders
[47:53] is voices
[47:55] Thunders is The Voice
[47:59] of seven Thunders uttered their voices
[48:01] next verse
[48:02] amen
[48:03] these are the Seals opening
[48:05] in our day you know what happened before
[48:07] the seals open
[48:09] you know what happened before the seal
[48:11] could happen
[48:12] we just read it first verse
[48:15] and God himself
[48:17] came down
[48:24] it's recorded in Revelations but seal it
[48:27] up until the end
[48:34] we've arrived
[48:36] we're past tense arrived
[48:38] that happened already and I'm going to
[48:40] read the quote where the Prophet said
[48:41] how he came down it was sealed up in our
[48:43] day
[48:44] and when the seven Thunders utter their
[48:46] voices and I was about to write what the
[48:49] seal said
[48:50] I Heard a Voice in heaven saying unto me
[48:52] seal it up for those things which are
[48:55] the Seven Seals seven Thunders Thunders
[48:58] are voices
[48:59] utter
[49:01] thundered
[49:03] said
[49:04] hide the seals
[49:06] but as in the days of the voice of the
[49:10] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[49:13] sound
[49:14] the mysteries of God
[49:18] the mysteries of this Bible
[49:21] the mysteries of marriage and divorce
[49:24] the mysteries of the godhead the
[49:27] mysteries of water baptism I will do all
[49:30] things as I reveal it to my servants the
[49:32] prophets
[49:34] the mysteries of thee no eternal hell
[49:38] the mysteries of you are eternal
[49:43] and on and on and on and
[49:54] and write them not
[49:56] next verse
[49:58] oh Hallelujah and the angel that I saw
[50:02] stood now this is Christ
[50:04] and Christ that I saw
[50:06] upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted
[50:09] up His Hands to Heaven
[50:11] oh now our Prophet said that
[50:14] I couldn't say that if we didn't have a
[50:16] prophet I have a backup plan
[50:18] okay but even our Bible will tell us
[50:20] next verse
[50:22] and he swear
[50:26] by the prophet
[50:28] not by the angel
[50:30] who came to Abraham
[50:39] who did Abraham fall down and said
[50:42] my Lord
[50:44] my God who did light see angels
[50:50] oh isn't this beautiful
[50:52] it's it's just unbelievable
[50:55] and he swear by him that liveth
[51:00] forever and ever who created who who
[51:03] created the heavens and the things which
[51:06] there are in and the Earth
[51:09] and the things
[51:10] that there are in are you getting the
[51:13] picture I just see are the things that
[51:16] there are in that there should be
[51:21] that they should be I helped me preach
[51:24] for somebody that there should be
[51:27] time time no more who don't operate
[51:31] under time
[51:33] brother Dale operates a time got to get
[51:35] that I gotta I gotta
[51:37] my god Jehovah God there's one moment as
[51:41] is a thousand years
[51:44] God
[51:46] oh my
[51:49] who was this angel that put his hand
[51:52] under the sea they the world don't know
[51:56] it
[51:57] but you know it
[51:59] because God came down
[52:03] not just and even of the South
[52:06] but he sent a prophet
[52:10] and he said I I hid it
[52:13] I hit it
[52:16] amen
[52:18] oh Church
[52:22] let me just tell you something this
[52:24] ain't a boat brother Dale
[52:26] this ain't even I mean it ain't About
[52:28] You pacifically
[52:30] it's about Christ
[52:31] and a bride
[52:33] and then end time and this is I'm
[52:35] telling you what you weren't born here
[52:37] to make money you weren't born here to
[52:41] build a nice house you weren't you were
[52:43] born here you came here for two reasons
[52:47] one to worship God
[52:49] and God to prove to Satan that God
[52:52] wouldn't bow to Satan oh oh Hallelujah
[52:58] time should be no more I want to tell
[53:01] you something this morning you are in
[53:04] eternity
[53:05] and everything you need you could speak
[53:08] it if you'd believe it
[53:10] only believe the password is only
[53:13] believed only believe only believe all
[53:16] things are possible do you know in our
[53:19] modern day technology there's things on
[53:22] your phone that you may not have
[53:24] but you could connect to somebody else's
[53:27] phone and do a jumper off it called the
[53:30] internet or called technology God had
[53:33] that a long time ago
[53:35] amen
[53:36] because if you don't have enough Faith
[53:39] to believe for your loved ones your
[53:40] loved ones don't have enough but God
[53:43] said to the Jailer that if you believe
[53:45] brother Matt or brother Jared if you
[53:47] believe it don't even matter that they
[53:49] don't even realize they're not believing
[53:51] but if you would believe and you would
[53:53] believe that they could jump or cable
[53:56] you and you would give enough Faith to
[53:58] them to the unbeliever that it would be
[54:00] all they would need to be an eternity
[54:04] wow
[54:06] what did God tell the prophet
[54:09] all that you loved
[54:13] wow
[54:18] all that you loved
[54:21] will be that
[54:26] we need to fast forward
[54:29] our God
[54:32] in our own life
[54:34] because he
[54:35] I I got to read let's see what the
[54:38] prophet said
[54:49] and Shalom 64. he said the Seven Seals
[54:52] were revealed
[54:54] before the great mystery of light
[54:56] and Tucson Flagstaff
[54:59] and brother friend and other brother
[55:00] Fred and other brothers were there
[55:04] you know what that was
[55:07] God
[55:09] come down
[55:10] Revelations 10.
[55:13] amen and he took he said I it was
[55:16] prophesied months and months ahead
[55:19] and I'm just he said a blast went off
[55:21] not knowing what would take place and he
[55:23] said the hands and the time was at hand
[55:26] and the Seven Seals which were held the
[55:29] seven Mysteries uh listen to me Church
[55:32] of the entire Bible
[55:34] were sealed up and those Seven Seals
[55:39] every mystery ever there's a few in
[55:43] there
[55:43] we're all sealed up in the seventh seal
[55:46] amen and the angel came down the road
[55:49] the messages and the church ages and
[55:51] opened a certain part of it but the
[55:53] seventh hour the seventh messenger and
[55:55] all these Mysteries should be finished
[56:00] because time
[56:01] it let me just rephrase this it's not
[56:04] just time is no more right now
[56:07] it hasn't been no more since 64.
[56:13] now if you're wondering about Grace
[56:16] I wasn't born in 64.
[56:20] but I was born
[56:22] but I wasn't born
[56:24] you couldn't see me but I was there
[56:27] I seen the cloud but I didn't see the
[56:29] cloud
[56:30] I was in the cloud
[56:32] I wasn't outside of the department
[56:40] I'm just jumping ahead on this film you
[56:42] everybody's welcome to these quotes the
[56:45] prophet said
[56:46] he swore by himself the time should be
[56:49] no more and therefore he broke forth on
[56:51] the lives forever and ever
[56:54] and time should be no more but he broke
[56:56] forth on those Seven Seals to reveal
[56:59] them
[57:01] that's when he came down when he came
[57:03] down before the seals in the cloud
[57:06] Revelations 10 and broke the Mysteries
[57:10] from that time forward we've been in
[57:13] eternity
[57:15] watch this and he said and time shall be
[57:18] no more and therefore he broke forth
[57:20] those Seven Seals and revealed them and
[57:22] he showed
[57:23] the uh oh I can't even say that word the
[57:27] The Marvelous things that he showed
[57:29] he showed them in the heavens first
[57:31] there's a word here I can't say I'm
[57:33] forgive me for my they showed
[57:36] that the Magnificent things he showed
[57:39] he showed in the heavens
[57:43] right before you were born
[57:45] he showed it let me say let me show you
[57:48] what he says and that day the world took
[57:51] pictures of it
[57:52] all across Southern United States and
[57:55] Mexico you didn't think you were living
[57:56] in eternity
[58:00] and there it hangs thou in Life Magazine
[58:03] still a mystery to them
[58:06] but he declared it in the heavens watch
[58:08] watch this
[58:10] now let's go back to our scriptures
[58:12] Revelation 10 just in our memory did it
[58:15] not say the time would be no more in
[58:18] Revelations uh 10 6.
[58:21] the end of the verse
[58:26] and he said but he declares it in the
[58:28] heaven
[58:30] before he does it
[58:32] here
[58:36] and he always does that
[58:40] because he shows his signs in the
[58:43] heavens first
[58:44] and then he says look out here I'm
[58:47] coming
[58:49] Jehovah God
[58:51] let me show you something how God
[58:52] operates oh it's beautiful Josh Joshua
[58:57] around Jericho walls seven times
[59:00] why
[59:02] Grace
[59:04] you thought he just was following God's
[59:06] orders
[59:07] wow Grace
[59:10] Noah went in the ark
[59:13] God shut the door
[59:18] did it rain
[59:20] but she couldn't have guessed so many
[59:21] days
[59:25] Grace again I would tell you something
[59:27] this morning
[59:29] you know what there's Revelation in
[59:32] God's word that's not written
[59:35] I never knew that until this week
[59:38] you say brother Dale you're walking
[59:40] right on the edge
[59:41] and you might not be a word preacher
[59:43] anymore
[59:44] would you like an example of the
[59:45] scripture
[59:47] well I I can't believe all the things
[59:49] God showed me this week
[59:51] God used Elijah to get Rebecca you
[59:55] brother Matt you brother Bernard brother
[59:57] Frank did he did it just help me out
[1:00:00] somebody help me preach he came to
[1:00:02] Eliezer
[1:00:03] to get Rebecca and he said to God he
[1:00:07] said now if she's the one
[1:00:10] tell her to give me a drink
[1:00:13] and then water my camels
[1:00:15] is that true
[1:00:17] but what did Eliezer Tell Rebecca
[1:00:25] I'll help you
[1:00:27] he said give me a drink
[1:00:29] he did not say what he told God
[1:00:34] and Rebecca in Revelation to Jehovah God
[1:00:40] said and I'll Water your camels also
[1:00:45] that was eroded the word
[1:00:52] oh that's unbelievable
[1:00:56] he never said that to Rebecca
[1:01:04] oh that's exactly what he's doing to
[1:01:09] Rebecca today
[1:01:12] wow
[1:01:16] and that's not leaving the word of God
[1:01:19] either
[1:01:23] wow
[1:01:25] what did the prophet say about butter
[1:01:29] reap between the lights
[1:01:39] oh
[1:01:40] thank you Lord
[1:01:42] and he always does it in the heavens
[1:01:48] before he shows it on Earth and he goes
[1:01:51] in and talks about the Zoe
[1:01:53] and all these things
[1:01:55] and the message alone
[1:02:01] God
[1:02:03] Jehovah
[1:02:05] and it ain't Because of You pacifically
[1:02:07] or me pacifically but it's because of us
[1:02:10] specifically you get in my picture I
[1:02:12] ain't married to make me some big big
[1:02:14] Macho nothing and I ain't trying to make
[1:02:16] you some big nacho about it but the
[1:02:18] bride of Christ together collectively
[1:02:20] around the world and every country in
[1:02:22] every tribe in every nation is a big
[1:02:24] deal
[1:02:31] oh
[1:02:32] oh man we have to catch this soon
[1:02:34] because we're not going to be here very
[1:02:36] long
[1:02:41] it's finished
[1:02:43] and everything that you think you're
[1:02:45] going to get in heaven you could get
[1:02:46] right here
[1:02:48] if you just believe
[1:02:51] so when you would connect
[1:02:53] to a non-believer
[1:02:56] and they would connect to your faith
[1:02:58] like Technologies trying to become you
[1:03:01] don't think technology is trying to
[1:03:02] imitate God
[1:03:04] Santa Claus Knows What You Want For
[1:03:06] Christmas no we don't Jesus Does
[1:03:09] Hallelujah Satan is a liar
[1:03:18] my phone if I start looking at praying
[1:03:20] for the Believers in Mexico by the way
[1:03:22] they're they're having Civil War you
[1:03:25] know if I was watching videos on Mexico
[1:03:26] the next video is videos because they
[1:03:29] already know what I'm thinking about
[1:03:31] that's not God
[1:03:33] this is God
[1:03:40] time
[1:03:44] is over
[1:03:46] we're living
[1:03:48] in eternity
[1:03:51] verse 6.
[1:03:55] oh did I read this
[1:03:57] Amen in verse 7.
[1:04:00] that's realist
[1:04:02] so God sweared by himself
[1:04:05] see when God wanted to do a New Covenant
[1:04:07] with the Gentiles and give a promised
[1:04:10] seed son Isaac he didn't send an angel
[1:04:15] wow the Bible says as an angel but there
[1:04:18] was an angel
[1:04:23] they don't want me to tell you something
[1:04:25] else
[1:04:26] that ego that angel wasn't a beacon
[1:04:28] either
[1:04:30] that angel Abraham and Sarah cook meat
[1:04:33] for it and it ate red meat
[1:04:36] hello
[1:04:40] he turned it
[1:04:42] I already mentioned Revelations 8.
[1:04:45] predestinated called Justified
[1:04:48] and this is wrote past tense
[1:04:52] those people he's already
[1:04:55] glorified
[1:04:58] he also glorified
[1:05:01] past tense it's not like well if I'm a
[1:05:05] good boy and I don't steal a cookie from
[1:05:07] Grandma's house that when the Rapture
[1:05:10] comes
[1:05:11] no
[1:05:14] glorified
[1:05:16] past tense
[1:05:18] oh
[1:05:19] my goodness
[1:05:21] Ephesians 4 30 is where it says grieve
[1:05:23] not the Holy Spirit whereby ears sealed
[1:05:25] to the day
[1:05:28] of your Redemption
[1:05:30] see the book
[1:05:32] the book was sealed
[1:05:35] but it's open
[1:05:38] now
[1:05:39] 64.
[1:05:41] the Mysteries were revealed
[1:05:44] really be in our day but before our day
[1:05:48] and our age and the Mighty God has
[1:05:50] revealed himself to you
[1:05:52] and to me and he's come down
[1:05:55] and church we need to quit living like
[1:05:57] humans
[1:05:58] and we need to start living like the
[1:06:00] bride of Christ
[1:06:03] it's not maybe perchance if I'm lucky
[1:06:07] oh garbage
[1:06:18] seventh the seventh seal
[1:06:22] the seals were revealed but the seventh
[1:06:24] seal deals with
[1:06:27] even when the prophet revealed the
[1:06:29] seventh seal
[1:06:33] it's wrote
[1:06:34] even when he revealed it
[1:06:36] to some make believe in Bride
[1:06:40] some don't even believe it's revealed
[1:06:42] the Bible says it is
[1:06:44] our Prophet was here to reveal it
[1:06:47] it's revealed
[1:06:49] it's revealed who
[1:06:51] he and she is
[1:06:53] notice how I said that
[1:06:56] because you can't reveal he without she
[1:07:00] it's revealed who he and she is
[1:07:02] and it also our Prophet says that it
[1:07:04] reveals
[1:07:06] that there's not time
[1:07:10] oh my goodness
[1:07:13] the mysteries of the seventh seal
[1:07:16] is time is no more
[1:07:18] Hallelujah
[1:07:21] watch this you say well could you please
[1:07:23] give me this Bible that you read our
[1:07:26] Prophet said
[1:07:29] if you ever have trouble doing your
[1:07:31] devotions
[1:07:34] get the Holy Ghost
[1:07:36] he said after the bite the seals were
[1:07:38] open
[1:07:39] he said this Bible
[1:07:41] became
[1:07:42] a brand new
[1:07:44] brand new book
[1:07:46] I was studying the deeper I got into it
[1:07:48] I spent days this week I never left the
[1:07:51] living room and the deeper I got into it
[1:07:54] I was like
[1:07:56] Spellbound
[1:07:58] I was like out of control
[1:08:03] eternity
[1:08:05] just a taste of Eternity
[1:08:08] he said
[1:08:10] you say well could you please show me an
[1:08:13] example in the scriptures
[1:08:15] thank you for asking
[1:08:17] in the Bible
[1:08:19] after Pentecost
[1:08:23] Peter get up
[1:08:25] or sorry after the upper room and a
[1:08:27] bunch of people come out
[1:08:29] and they were
[1:08:33] and the people in down said
[1:08:35] those people have been in that church in
[1:08:36] Wyoming again
[1:08:38] and they got some new wine in there
[1:08:41] I think I'll break into the fellowship
[1:08:43] all through the windows that aren't
[1:08:45] fasting yet
[1:08:46] and get me some of that
[1:08:50] I'm helping you understand
[1:08:53] I'm bringing it up to today
[1:08:55] and Peter said and Peter said
[1:09:00] this is that
[1:09:04] what's that
[1:09:06] the time should be no more
[1:09:09] and this is that
[1:09:11] the prophet George
[1:09:15] spoke of baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:19] Hallelujah
[1:09:21] when God himself put his foot on the
[1:09:24] land and the sea he took every spirit
[1:09:28] watch this
[1:09:30] the Earth is Satan's domain
[1:09:32] the prophet said that the devil is
[1:09:35] controlled
[1:09:37] of the world
[1:09:39] I don't care who you vote in and I might
[1:09:42] have an opinion that's all it's worth is
[1:09:43] an opinion but it won't matter who the
[1:09:45] states gets for a new leader and it
[1:09:47] won't even matter if we get a different
[1:09:48] one here which would be really nice it
[1:09:51] won't make no difference because the
[1:09:52] exact same person is controlling this
[1:09:53] race
[1:09:54] would you like to know who that person
[1:09:56] is Satan
[1:10:00] it'll be a different face
[1:10:02] but it'll be exactly the same spirit
[1:10:05] but when God himself
[1:10:08] came down and he said that the land
[1:10:13] he puts Satan under his feet wow
[1:10:17] and he said the sea
[1:10:20] hate that one
[1:10:26] I'm the boss

[1:10:49] caterpillar has eaten
[1:10:51] oh my
[1:10:54] and the Palmer worm and my great Army
[1:10:57] which I sat among you who will
[1:11:01] God
[1:11:03] who will restore it
[1:11:05] Jehovah God the same Jehovah God that
[1:11:08] came down
[1:11:09] and put his foot on the land
[1:11:12] and the Sea do you see it
[1:11:15] you're not a perchance you weren't no
[1:11:17] accident it wasn't your your mom and
[1:11:20] dad's planning oh it goes away beyond
[1:11:23] that oh my Mom and Dad decided that we
[1:11:25] were good oh garbage

[1:12:05] and and I'm just showing you how God
[1:12:07] operates and and God said he said no can
[1:12:13] I paraphrase or not
[1:12:15] amen and so Daniel praise and God says

[1:12:25] foreign
[1:12:27] Gabriel came
[1:12:29] and your prayer didn't get answered
[1:12:32] for 21 days
[1:12:34] Daniel said well
[1:12:36] I guess God must have fell asleep
[1:12:38] oh maybe he
[1:12:40] maybe he don't answer me no more
[1:12:43] you've had those thoughts
[1:12:45] maybe God don't care
[1:12:47] oh come on Church
[1:12:52] and here

[1:13:53] and it was caused by Luke Satan
[1:13:56] so I called for God

[1:20:11] that was the new ID version
[1:20:17] foreign
[1:20:22] that are farmers
[1:20:25] that fear Him
[1:20:26] the uneducated fishermen
[1:20:29] Beyond learned
[1:20:32] he hid it from the wise
[1:20:34] sure glad
[1:20:36] and let's just look at this scripture
[1:20:38] just how it's wrote I I believe the word
[1:20:40] of God would be good to compare
[1:20:44] I I was not very good at English but I
[1:20:47] never ever failed an English class in
[1:20:48] high school but I came really close
[1:20:50] but that looks to me like it's past
[1:20:52] tense
[1:20:54] and he was thinking about delivering
[1:20:58] no he delivereth
[1:21:00] for them it's already happened
[1:21:04] so you didn't think you didn't think you
[1:21:06] were questioning whether I was thinking
[1:21:09] he's already delivered to you brother
[1:21:10] Matt
[1:21:14] to God
[1:21:17] since revelation 10.
[1:21:19] since he came down himself
[1:21:22] and revealed the seals which was every
[1:21:25] Speck of his secrets
[1:21:28] right through the messenger the prophet
[1:21:34] God's like Matt
[1:21:36] I give them ever what oh oh you people
[1:21:41] that are looking for something else you
[1:21:42] can stop looking
[1:21:45] our Prophet said
[1:21:46] that he's given you everything
[1:21:49] he could give you
[1:21:52] bless God I'm looking for something to
[1:21:55] come in the next 30 days well brother
[1:21:57] Dale's not
[1:21:58] if I get any more I'm gonna blow up
[1:22:04] not really but
[1:22:07] amen
[1:22:09] don't insult God
[1:22:11] he's already
[1:22:12] all and delivered
[1:22:15] past tense
[1:22:17] hello hello
[1:22:19] I hope they get the saved I hope I hope
[1:22:24] it works out for me
[1:22:28] what version are you reading
[1:22:33] oh my
[1:22:36] Hallelujah
[1:22:38] man
[1:22:44] wow
[1:22:46] I started to tell you
[1:22:49] my notes just reminded me
[1:22:54] I started to tell you
[1:22:56] Joshua went around Jericho seven days
[1:23:00] that was Grace
[1:23:01] did I finish that
[1:23:06] no one in the ark
[1:23:07] God shut the door
[1:23:10] seven days
[1:23:12] you know what
[1:23:13] if those people
[1:23:15] would have knocked
[1:23:18] on the door before it rained God would
[1:23:21] open the door and save them
[1:23:23] he said I don't think so brother Dale ah
[1:23:26] I'm sure glad you asked
[1:23:31] that's exactly what God did
[1:23:34] and seven churches just brother Matt
[1:23:38] he went around Jericho
[1:23:40] seven times and he said if they would
[1:23:42] want to repent which they couldn't
[1:23:44] because they weren't gods they weren't
[1:23:46] part of his program
[1:23:47] I'll give them seven days to repent
[1:23:50] when they got to know in the ark and he
[1:23:53] put eight souls in the ark which is a
[1:23:54] type of Eternity
[1:23:56] he said I'll wait seven days
[1:23:58] he had already waited 120 years
[1:24:01] hello
[1:24:03] he said I'll even shut the door
[1:24:05] and I'll say now this is for Real
[1:24:07] he's showing the world
[1:24:10] does anybody catch us
[1:24:12] he's showing the world I really need
[1:24:14] business here
[1:24:16] I put the people I said in the boat and
[1:24:18] I shut the door
[1:24:23] and that's exactly what God did in seven
[1:24:25] Church ages
[1:24:28] and they killed the prophets
[1:24:30] Stone the prophets and killed the Lord
[1:24:32] Jesus
[1:24:35] and that same spirit
[1:24:38] is still alive
[1:24:40] trying to kill man of God
[1:24:43] in the ministry
[1:24:45] of the bride of Christ
[1:24:59] you know
[1:25:01] if we're part of Christ
[1:25:04] it don't matter
[1:25:06] who has ten thousand in his church
[1:25:08] 410.
[1:25:10] don't matter who has the new church or
[1:25:12] an old one don't matter who is smart
[1:25:15] who's number
[1:25:17] anybody that was smart in the Bible God
[1:25:18] had to take it out of them before he
[1:25:19] could use them
[1:25:21] see it don't matter it don't matter
[1:25:22] who's driving a new car and who's
[1:25:23] driving the new car
[1:25:27] you sitting me
[1:25:33] it don't matter who Waters
[1:25:37] who plants
[1:25:39] but God gives the increase
[1:25:40] but a lot of people don't know that
[1:25:43] because I've heard ministers
[1:25:45] and the exact furthest ways country that
[1:25:47] I've ever I'll say the Philippines
[1:25:50] it was the Philippines
[1:25:51] and the minister was complaining to me
[1:25:54] because
[1:25:57] Felix got saved in our church
[1:26:00] but he got baptized in brother Matt's
[1:26:03] he said brother Matt you knew better
[1:26:05] than to baptize him because he got saved
[1:26:06] in my direction
[1:26:09] God's up there
[1:26:11] that is cool
[1:26:13] oh
[1:26:15] yeah that's exactly what he's saying oh
[1:26:17] wow
[1:26:18] he's saying wow I thought I thought I'd
[1:26:22] give him everything ahead
[1:26:24] I thought I'd give them everything I had
[1:26:34] you're kidding right
[1:26:37] wow
[1:26:45] that's unbelievable
[1:26:48] but that's also true
[1:26:54] we're not a part of that
[1:26:58] anything that does anything for the
[1:27:01] betterment of God
[1:27:03] is on our side
[1:27:05] period
[1:27:07] period
[1:27:09] amen
[1:27:10] what did Jesus tell the disciples
[1:27:13] make sure you're not fighting
[1:27:16] against somebody
[1:27:18] on our side
[1:27:26] here in Psalms 46 let's I'm just going
[1:27:29] to paraphrase this 46 6-11 you can read
[1:27:32] this you can write it down you can take
[1:27:33] pictures of my notes they're actually
[1:27:35] legible today because I printed them off
[1:27:38] amen if I write them I normally have to
[1:27:40] interpret them myself after but here it
[1:27:43] says all the kingdoms of the Earth
[1:27:46] will fall
[1:27:47] this is John Psalms 46 6-11 I'm just
[1:27:51] paraphrasing
[1:27:52] well maybe we'll read it
[1:28:06] the heathen reared the rage the kingdoms
[1:28:10] were moved and he uttered his voice
[1:28:13] and the Earth
[1:28:18] amen fire
[1:28:20] the Lord of hosts is with us the god of
[1:28:23] Jacob is our refuge Sheila
[1:28:27] come Behold The Works of the Lord what
[1:28:30] desolations he hath made in the Earth
[1:28:34] and he hath made maketh Wards to cease
[1:28:37] upon the ends of the Earth and he
[1:28:40] breakth the bow and cutteth the spear
[1:28:44] and Splendor and he burneth
[1:28:47] the church
[1:28:53] be still
[1:28:56] and no I'm the boss
[1:29:00] don't get too don't get say I you know I
[1:29:03] was blessed God I had a good family and
[1:29:05] I was be careful God might take it from
[1:29:08] you
[1:29:09] be still and know that I'm God and I
[1:29:12] will be exalted among the heathens
[1:29:15] that's pretty good
[1:29:17] and I will be exalted
[1:29:20] in the Earth
[1:29:22] one more verse the Lord of hosts is with
[1:29:26] us
[1:29:27] tomorrow
[1:29:29] well not yet
[1:29:30] because I'm still struggling
[1:29:33] today
[1:29:37] if you're still struggling this morning
[1:29:39] I'm going to cut rate to the Chase and
[1:29:42] sometimes brother Dale still struggles
[1:29:45] there's too much abuse and
[1:29:49] because there ain't no struggle God
[1:29:51] don't struggle with God
[1:29:53] the Holy Ghost don't struggle with God
[1:29:54] and all the god that's here don't
[1:29:56] struggle with the god that's amen and so
[1:29:59] I don't struggle with brother Matt or
[1:30:00] brother Bernard or brother Tim or Jared
[1:30:02] the boys because because God don't
[1:30:05] struggle with God so if there's a
[1:30:06] struggle there's a lot too much
[1:30:10] blood flesh and blood
[1:30:13] oh
[1:30:15] Hallelujah the Lord of hosts is with us
[1:30:18] the god of Jacob
[1:30:21] is our protector
[1:30:23] our refuge

[1:31:00] I'll repreach everything twice
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:07] don't resent this that's the truth
[1:31:11] the Rapture is in US
[1:31:15] in US
[1:31:16] now
[1:31:19] I'll prove it by the gospel
[1:31:22] I love a prophet like that
[1:31:25] I just love a prophet like that I love
[1:31:29] anybody like that
[1:31:31] says I'll prove it I like proof
[1:31:34] those who he called
[1:31:36] he justified
[1:31:38] and those that he justified you he's
[1:31:40] already glorified
[1:31:42] and how he says hallelujah then in
[1:31:45] heaven today
[1:31:47] in the presence of God right now
[1:31:50] you are not only there
[1:31:56] but glorified
[1:32:00] oh buddy
[1:32:02] I I can't
[1:32:06] like what
[1:32:16] amazing
[1:32:19] I'm going to read another
[1:32:21] here in questions and answers in 64. he
[1:32:24] said now notice the Bible said when
[1:32:26] Daniel saw Daniel wrote the Book of
[1:32:30] Revelations
[1:32:32] but it was Daniel
[1:32:35] he wrote the first
[1:32:37] Book of Revelations
[1:32:39] the same God came again
[1:32:42] and wrote Revelations again
[1:32:45] and said exactly the same thing
[1:32:48] just to prove to you
[1:32:51] that he was still God
[1:32:57] and how many would remember reading
[1:32:59] you'll notice in John in Revelations he
[1:33:02] came to the same thing Revelations 1 and
[1:33:04] he stood there and this well watch well
[1:33:07] I got to start the beginning story
[1:33:08] forgive me and we'll notice in the
[1:33:11] vision that Daniel saw that he came to
[1:33:13] the the the tying
[1:33:16] and he seen that the person come down
[1:33:19] and his hair was white as wool
[1:33:21] Daniel
[1:33:22] and how many would remember reading that
[1:33:25] when you'll notice in John in
[1:33:26] Revelations it came the same thing in
[1:33:28] Revelations 1 and he stood there and his
[1:33:30] hair
[1:33:31] was as white as wool
[1:33:35] now Daniel didn't call John on his cell
[1:33:39] phone
[1:33:40] and transfer his notes by email
[1:33:44] but there was email before
[1:33:46] it was called Jehovah God
[1:33:50] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:51] Elohim all-knowing
[1:33:55] oh
[1:33:56] and he stood there and his hair was
[1:33:58] white as wool and he put his feet this
[1:34:00] way
[1:34:01] and the ancients
[1:34:03] time
[1:34:05] oh man
[1:34:07] and the Ancients of time and that is it
[1:34:10] had no time
[1:34:13] the Eternal one
[1:34:15] he came now watch he says the Saints
[1:34:18] came to Earth and the books were opened
[1:34:20] and another book was opened in The Book
[1:34:21] of Life
[1:34:23] from the one and they came to the
[1:34:25] judgment and he came with them ten
[1:34:27] thousands times ten thousands he's right
[1:34:29] and is that right he said minister to
[1:34:32] him
[1:34:33] the bride the queen to the king now you
[1:34:37] remember back and I'm going to close
[1:34:38] with this remember back what I said what
[1:34:41] our worship should be like I'm not
[1:34:43] talking about garbage
[1:34:45] I'm talking about fellowship with your
[1:34:48] love life
[1:34:49] Jehovah God spiritually your your maker
[1:34:52] your
[1:34:53] your king your lord your savior your
[1:34:56] everything
[1:34:57] okay
[1:34:58] he said
[1:35:00] ministers the bride ministers the queen
[1:35:04] to the king now watch that's what I'm
[1:35:06] going to close with us
[1:35:07] who is your little Queen in the home
[1:35:11] now any of you that are married you
[1:35:13] think of your wife
[1:35:15] she ministers to you
[1:35:17] she ministers the food to you is that
[1:35:19] right
[1:35:21] now you're late on this now
[1:35:25] but when she then ministers to you
[1:35:28] that's what the bride does to Christ
[1:35:32] the word
[1:35:35] it's worship man shall not live by bread
[1:35:38] alone but by every
[1:35:40] word
[1:35:42] amen see and she minute I'm I'm reading
[1:35:46] word for word and she ministers the word
[1:35:49] to the king Jehovah God
[1:35:52] manifesting the promised word in the age
[1:35:56] that she's living in
[1:35:58] my question to you is are you
[1:36:01] manifesting
[1:36:03] eternity
[1:36:04] time is no more the age that you're
[1:36:06] living in it's not the age of time
[1:36:09] to Christ right now in your day
[1:36:13] are you ministering all the Mysteries I
[1:36:15] revealed
[1:36:17] and time is a blur
[1:36:26] wow
[1:36:28] amen oh I said something then and you
[1:36:33] didn't get it but
[1:36:36] notice oh my that was a good one see
[1:36:39] ministering in the age the word now
[1:36:43] notice she came and he came Ten Thousand
[1:36:47] Times Ten Thousand came to him and
[1:36:49] judgment was set and the books were open
[1:36:51] another book was the the lamb the The
[1:36:54] Book of Life
[1:36:56] and they judged us and who was it that
[1:36:59] come the bride did not have to come to
[1:37:03] be judged
[1:37:04] she was already
[1:37:07] judged
[1:37:08] she actually he says it like this I'm
[1:37:10] sorry he says she was free
[1:37:13] of judgment other places he said she's
[1:37:15] already
[1:37:18] amen let's stand
[1:37:22] part two
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:27] Hallelujah
[1:37:30] wow
[1:37:36] amen thank you Lord
[1:37:39] thank you Lord Jesus God
[1:37:41] loves you
[1:37:43] and this is no mistake what he's doing
[1:37:47] it's no mistake what he's doing actually
[1:37:50] let me put it like this it's no mistake
[1:37:53] what he's already
[1:37:55] done
[1:37:59] already done
[1:38:01] and time Revelations 10
[1:38:05] 6. and time
[1:38:10] shall be no more now that time
[1:38:14] I
[1:38:16] it's from the time that Christ Jesus
[1:38:19] came down
[1:38:21] in a cloud
[1:38:25] our Prophet said
[1:38:27] that happened
[1:38:29] in our very own age I didn't read you
[1:38:32] next week
[1:38:35] I'll read you
[1:38:37] the next week
[1:38:38] I'll read you where that happened
[1:38:42] and the Believers of that day
[1:38:44] when the scientists couldn't figure out
[1:38:46] what it was
[1:38:49] they said
[1:38:50] brother Brown you know what it was
[1:38:53] why don't you take it to them
[1:38:56] and show them
[1:38:58] in the scriptures
[1:39:01] and what it was
[1:39:06] I'll read that next Sunday or next time
[1:39:09] I preach John Garrett's preaching next
[1:39:10] Sunday by the way
[1:39:13] but they wanted the Believers wanted
[1:39:14] brother Brown to go to science
[1:39:16] and show them what the cloud was
[1:39:22] and when brother Branham was driving
[1:39:24] I believed to do it
[1:39:27] God says
[1:39:32] it's not for them
[1:39:33] go to the Tabernacle
[1:39:41] see
[1:39:43] on that quote alone
[1:39:47] don't mislead me
[1:39:49] this truth
[1:39:51] of a prophet
[1:39:54] and the Mystery is being revealed
[1:39:56] you couldn't preach it no realer than
[1:39:58] this morning
[1:40:02] but that's where believers
[1:40:04] are wrong
[1:40:06] when they go out
[1:40:08] and they put brother Branham in the
[1:40:10] front
[1:40:14] because it wasn't for them
[1:40:17] it wasn't for most of them and this is
[1:40:19] what I mean by that
[1:40:21] if it's for somebody
[1:40:24] and they come to a denominational
[1:40:26] understanding of Christ
[1:40:29] will never leave them there
[1:40:31] he promised that
[1:40:33] he promised that now what do you say
[1:40:35] come out of her my people he promised
[1:40:37] them if they won't come out of her then
[1:40:40] then you've shown them it's going to do
[1:40:44] uh-huh
[1:40:47] so get unto Christ
[1:40:49] and Christ
[1:40:52] through the unwritten word
[1:40:59] you say that can't happen
[1:41:00] did it happen to Rebecca
[1:41:04] did Rebecca know what Eliezer had told
[1:41:08] God
[1:41:10] that's up to you to decide
[1:41:17] amen
[1:41:18] Eliezer said if she's what watch how he
[1:41:21] said that amen if she's predestinated
[1:41:25] bride material
[1:41:27] I won't even have to show her the books
[1:41:30] I'm not talking against the books I'm
[1:41:32] not talking about the message do you see
[1:41:34] what I'm saying
[1:41:36] and she was and got picture and it
[1:41:39] wasn't even spoken
[1:41:41] wow
[1:41:45] oh that's good now that don't take away
[1:41:47] from the bugs
[1:41:51] I'll read you the quote you know
[1:41:53] when we picked this up
[1:41:57] how
[1:41:58] God told Brother Branham
[1:42:01] don't take it to the scientists it's not
[1:42:03] for them
[1:42:08] amen
[1:42:12] thanks for coming and letting me preach
[1:42:14] I hadn't Sunday wouldn't it came soon I
[1:42:17] would
[1:42:18] I would have needed a safety valve
[1:42:21] just a
[1:42:23] he is
[1:42:25] you see God he's everywhere
[1:42:29] he's like the story of the little boy
[1:42:31] that said he asked his mom and she said
[1:42:33] I don't know it was God I don't see God
[1:42:35] that's the preacher I don't see God this
[1:42:37] I just see churches and I said Sunday's
[1:42:40] going to teach her so oh nobody's seen
[1:42:42] God bless God

[1:50:33] when I was praying
[1:50:35] then we're gonna
[1:50:36] sing that song do you know how it feels
[1:50:39] I believe God wants you to know
[1:50:43] how he feels
[1:50:46] about you
[1:50:48] I believe that president
[1:50:51] I mentioned about fire
[1:50:54] and about
[1:50:56] the prophet said there was a fire that
[1:50:58] kept the lions from Daniel
[1:51:00] but that same fire never burned Daniel
[1:51:03] and I showed you how
[1:51:06] there was fire that came to Moses in the
[1:51:08] burning bush
[1:51:09] but it never burnt the burning bush
[1:51:14] you have that same fire today
[1:51:18] if you have the Holy Ghost you do
[1:51:21] but there was another example and God's
[1:51:23] perfected in three perfection
[1:51:28] it was when the three Hebrew children
[1:51:29] were put in the fire departments
[1:51:33] the fire that was in there
[1:51:45] and you were questioning
[1:51:53] he sewed himself and he showed himself
[1:51:56] and he showed himself
[1:51:59] he showed himself but the ones down the
[1:52:01] road don't know that
[1:52:04] because they rejected the word
[1:52:07] is that amazing fire
[1:52:11] that wasn't hot
[1:52:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:52:15] beautifully now let's sing that course
[1:52:17] just the course and we'll be dismissed
[1:52:19] on the course do you know how it feels
[1:52:21] do we have words for an opinion
[1:52:23] I believe with all my heart I might have
[1:52:25] the kids sing this when I preach again
[1:52:27] God wants you
[1:52:29] to know
[1:52:31] how he feels
[1:52:33] about you

[1:54:32] and say if you got the right God
[1:54:35] and you got the true God
[1:54:38] and you know all the Mysteries
[1:54:56] and what he does is hot bamboo
[1:55:00] and the weevil's eating the wood
[1:55:05] but now they're coming to him
[1:55:08] and they're saying I recognize your
[1:55:10] heavenly
[1:55:12] father he owns everything
