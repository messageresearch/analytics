we'll be here Friday night Saturday and Sunday so Friday night the 29th and the 30th and the 31st Andre Butte will be here and if God will allow him he's going to preach on relationships a man just was my desire he was kind of kind of thinking that way during our anniversary so husband and wife and parents and children and relationships even with brothers and sisters in the body relationships amen if God will man so let me just look forward to that and just in a wonderful way brother Andre he's a fantastic brother and amen he's qualified profoundly to uh to preach on relationships I mean Grandpa and his kids all serve the Lord and just an amazing time amen so we look forward to that amen of course I think he's staying at our place but he's uh welcome for Fellowship for sure anybody and everybody amen just welcome you all here this morning God bless you all amen just a great opportunity to be here let's turn to Joshua and we're going to read Joshua Joshua 1 1-3 and five and six he meant for our Texan I wanna I wanna Maybe talk to each one of us I I don't know if it was the anointing but talk to parents Maybe but uh even all of us and you know our Prophet said this he said he said the Christians are always talking about what God did do and they're always talking about what God's going to do but they don't see nothing that he's doing right now these things not ought to be because we believe that Jesus Hebrews 13 8 is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so if he was great he's still great and if he's going to be great he always was great amen and so it should change our thinking amen and I want to show you in this topic that we're talking about it's mentioned in three different places in the Bible that God himself tells us to do this and I I'm going to tell you that I I don't think generally speaking generally speaking we do this if at all very little and and I really felt uh you know checked amen and that God was dealing with me and studying this and I've had it on my desk for a few weeks amen so let's just read we're going to read one to three and five and six now after the death of Moses the servant the Lord came the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake to Joshua the son of nun Moses and Minister saying this is God himself talking to Joshua Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go to this Jordan thou and all the people onto a land which I give to them even to the children of Israel not now try to make this personal to the bride amen and in the day we're living and every place that the soul of thy feet tread upon I have given to you as I said on to Moses now just before we go on we're going to go to five but here the Lord is not talking to Moses he's done talking to Moses he socked in to Joshua amen the verse 5 just waiting for it amen and these shall not any man be it there shall not be any man able to stand before thee all the days of thy life now I was sort of truth no he's not talking to Moses he's talking to you he's talking to today today as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee well that's that's us that's you man uh oh where did my verse 5 go amen amen thank you Lord let's go to uh Joshua 4 and 6. four and six thank you Amy Joshua 4 and 6 that says that this may now this is also still the Lord talking he's given Joshua some Commandments and we're going to talk about this and this may be a sign unto you oh that when your children ask you they're fathers you made it fairly personal in the time to come saying what Menace see these stones Hallelujah Lord Jesus we ask you just come and do a miracle Among Us in your presence and you hope any man could read the word Lord Jesus but only you can take the scales off our eyes and give us revelation of what you mean to say to us today and we pray that we'll be better people and better bride and and and obey your word better and be in line better Lord Jesus because of your presence today and we'll give you the glory for it your beautiful name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning Hallelujah we we see here that God was wanting to put a sign to the children for what God had done in Joshua's life and we see here that God had made it personal and it's very hard for us we for whatever reason in history we're always looking back like a frog or we're looking ahead but God is exactly the same as he was when the prophet was here when Jesus Christ was here but I I want to bring this up today and I want to show you some things here you know the problem here here in the scriptures and we're going to read some more scriptures we're going to go to uh Joshua 4 1. and I want to show you that God's not telling Joshua to remind the children of what he did in Moses life that got me kind of because Moses is kind of like the superhero Moses was God the Pharaoh and Moses had the plagues and all these magnificent things that were very easy to remind the children of what God did but God didn't say tell them what Moses did or what I did in Moses life amen he didn't say that now now listen that's God and it wasn't wrong if you did but it caught me like why did he say it was to remind the children how I brought the children of Israel from Almighty head oh it would have been tremendous all the plagues across the Red Sea and just delivered the pillar of fire in the cloud at night God had just how he kicked Egypt from the children of Israel and it would have been magnificent but God didn't tell them to do that he said tell them exactly what I did today today what'd God do today for you today what did he do this week for you because here you see God gave the the land to the Israelites the promised land which is our Holy Ghost amen and he said you'll cross the Jordan and you know when the the ark went in and the priests the Levites went into the the Jordan River we know it was at harvesting and the river was completely on his Brim it was running over like it would have been Springtime here not not like we're not like in the dry time it was blooming to its brim of its banks and we know the story how the the once the sole of their feet touched the edge just touched the edge of that water you know why didn't God have it do it when it was dry it would have been just I mean it still would have been God no God does things it's such a magnificent way to get glory to himself and he wanted the kids to know about that Glory you're in the kitchen you know John said in Revelation now watch this you know maybe our kids aren't interested in church because it's our fault maybe it's the preacher's faults and the father's fault so yeah watch this John said in Revelations that I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day now our Prophet talked about that some he said you know if you go to a ball game there ain't nothing about that ball game that excites you unless you get in the spirit of it ah you get in the spirit of that ball game and it's a hot ball game and they don't have air conditioning on the bleachers and it's just the ball game and the guy's making a few million dollars and you're making 10 bucks an hour and you're buying a ticket that's paying his wages and you're just sitting there but he hits a home run and everybody goes wow because you got in the spirit of that ball game and whatever it'd be hockey sport you said you got in the spirit if you love something you get in the spirit of it oh I can't wait to go to you know wherever because but then our kids now it's not the wait now let me tell you something it's not the kid's fault it's not the kid's fault it's the father's fault and the ministry's fault and and it's Sunday now and it's time to go to church and say oh oh man that's gonna be boring oh it's gonna be odd we ain't got an air conditioner but God's telling the fathers through Joshua that when you when the priests were in the the the the the river that God stopped the river to a brim up in the head stop like when the cross the the Red Sea no no it said its prims and the water's all coming down from the mountains and the rivers and all that how did God do that now the water didn't stop running way up above well it's just one way to say it was just God it was just it was Supernatural because I was because remember there was thousands if not millions of people crossed some of them were old what was it Kane the water's like oh come some of them are young they were crawling so it wasn't like it was just the Army cross and they did it really fast no God held it there as long as he needed to hold it there and that wasn't all because Joshua got it had ordered Joshua when he's crossing the Red Sea or crossing the Jordan River he said now when the priests are still in there holding the ark which was the presence and that day it was The Presence of Jehovah Jireh oh that's that's beautiful now you are the ark today you are packed in The Presence of Jehovah Jireh now one spec difference it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's Christ's own blood it's Grace on spirit amen and he said so now when the when they're in there and they're holding me there I'd be like you being there because you're the ark today so when they're standing there and the people are done walking through he said I want you to pick a man from each one of the tribes of Israel and I want them to pick up a big Stone a big Stone and he said I want you to place it rate the 12 Stones rate where the feet of the priests were now they weren't they see they weren't God now because the baptism of the Holy Ghost hadn't come yet but where the feet of the priests were that held God not only so if you don't believe this morning that you're God what do you believe that you're holding God do you believe you're backing God because the priest said the baptism will he goes and come and they were just holding him on his shoulder maybe you're holding them in your soul and so there's my feet so they put a big Stone there and so God didn't just hold the water back from the Jordan well the people were crossing and when the slow ones crossed and the other but then they've all crossed and it's still held up he said I'll bring in these rocks and other people weren't God but he said just put them where their feet were that held God all that that's beautiful that's beautiful and they come out the rocks will still be there you know the Bible says that those rocks are still there till this day now God made that Memorial so when you're out farming and fishing you're going by the Jordans and you see a whole bunch of rocks your kids go whoa I wonder why those are there you say oh boys see you're getting your kids in the spirit say whoa how was the time in my day when I was young God did an amazing thing and how your kids received God is how you get them in this bed our parents get them in the spirit how the ministry gets them in the spirit do you want don't I I know God's got predestination I know all that I know you can claim your kids and all that but you can paint the same picture that you're serving God wow are you getting paid like wow and your kids see they know the truth see I say adults will believe lies and we you know you know but they see through all that garbage they can see they live with you they see your hinder side and they see your excitement to God you see you're except and you know what as good as and believe me they're good I I've heard I was listening to them yesterday and this week you know but as good as the stories are of our prophet and they're good and they're real and we testify in front of our kids that he's the same yesterday today and forever and there's not one Speck of difference and all that was in Christ he poured into his pride and you don't tell your kids know today stories with excitement of what God's done in your life it makes it now watch this hang on it makes it a dead letter a dead letter to your kids man no matter how amazing your kids are it is unbelievable how fast we disc communicate with history you know if you forget history they say people say it would have repeats itself that's why it repeats itself all that it's repeating itself right now but so is it in the natural in the spiritual from that if we don't keep this Vision alive the the words of Prophecy the Bible the division of the people perish now that goes for your kids they have to have a division and so you know you know you you can't brag on God too much maybe we'll read the scripture just uh just to lay a foundation just I know I kind of told you by you know God had gave Joshua the land and the children of Israel and he commanded them to go over and he sent spies over and you know it was uh talks about you know that God completely give it to him and the uh uh you know they'd cross during the Harvest Time which was it was right at the brim and not let's just go to Joshua 4-1 and read a few scriptures here just and again deposited all the people we've cleaned Passover Jordan a large spank unto Joshua saying take the 12 men out of the people and of every tribe of the man and I kept and command them saying take hints in the midst of the Jordan out to the place where the priest feet stood firm and place and the 12 Stones which thou has carried over with you and leave them in a lodging place where ye shall Lodge that night and Joshua called the 12 men whom they had prepared for the children of Israel out of every tribe every man and Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God unto the midst of the Jordan and take ye up every man you a stone onto a short Soldier according to the number of the tribes and the children of Israel and here we read this scripture already but this and I'm going to read you two other scriptures in the Bible that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in the time to come saying what Venus thou this Stone then you shall answer them and say the Waters of the Jordan were cut off at the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over the Jordan and the waters and these Stones shall be a memorial to the children of Israel forever and the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded them and took the 12 Stones Out of the midst of Jordan the Lord spacons Joshua according to the number of the tribes the children of Israel and They carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there and Joshua set up the 12 Stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priest had beared the arkans stood and they are there until this very day Hallelujah you know the prophet said there's another Memorial Bible but it's a very sad Memorial it's the time when God reached out in grace and mercy with two angels and went to Sodom and Gomorrah for lot and his family and all they could talk about was the social society and the politics of Sodom and Gomorrah and the wealth and Sodom and Gomorrah and how great it was and you know their new job and their new car and their knew this and when the angel came the Bible says when the Angels Came the Bible says the angel said that they so loved Sodom and Gomorrah now of course I know they were a type of the make-believers that the Angels actually took their arms and removed them restrained them the Bible says remove them and even though the angel did that which was Amazing Grace Amazing Grace lot's wife's heart was still in the world and she knew it was truth but she couldn't give up her love and God turned her into a pillar of salt as a memorial amen of somebody the disobeyed god let's turn to Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 6 and 7 and we'll see some Old Testament scriptures where it says to do this on our way you know you know and we're going to read some quotes of the prophet and things that he ran to amen and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall tell them when thou sitst in the house and when thou walk is in thy way and when thou lieth down and when thou rise up now that don't leave a light out you want to talk a lot about sports or Hollywood if you were only talking about Jesus all these times and they thou shall bind them for a sign unto thy hand and thou shalt be as a frontless before thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates and then just drop down to verse 12 and it says and then beware lest I'll forget the Lord which brought thee out of the land of Egypt to the house of bondage now now that's type in physical but we have a spiritual testimony the exact same God brought you out of the house of Egypt and bondage out of the world and give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and give you the Revelation and the eyes and the skills off your eyes to see the truth for your day that a a prophet brought and revealed the seals which was the whole mysteries of God that was sealed up amen that's amazing that was it that's the second scripture where it talks about teaching your children I wonder sometimes if our kids are born in churches because we don't get them in the spirit and that's Ministry too and parents we don't get them in the experiment of the excitement of the hour you know we're living in the greatest day an hour you could possibly live in you should talk to your kids about how amazing it's going to be to be here when Christ comes back it takes us in a rap battle you know if you if you follow the signs of the times cement this weekend I believe it was Wednesday that Russia and Turkey went to Iran which Iran was the ones that had a a covenant or a while Covenant a signed thing with the West that they couldn't make atomic Warheads amen and they were the ones that were always breaking it but I want to tell you something now they're they're making friendships with the country that has the most Atomic Warheads in the world Russia has more Atomic Warheads than every country in the world combined they have almost twice as many as the states uh and here there was a picture I don't know if any of you seen it probably some of you said but there was a picture on Wednesday where the Iran leader was standing in the middle and they took their hands in their fists and they put them up like this and the Russian leader was on one side and the turkey leader was on the other side now that is completely Ezekiel 38 and 39. they've completely coming to pass in our day like I mean you're you're Stone blind if you don't see that and you know when those scriptures come to pass they tell them we're not even here whoa the greatest event in history will be the Rapture and a body change and the world won't even know it took place they'll say well I thought Elias must come first Jesus will say but he already came and you didn't know you know I was reading quotes today and I don't have them in front of me don't matter but he said the the problem with the church is they're looking for something and they don't recognize the presence of him right in their midst no God help us to recognize God today amen Hallelujah you know is you know what our Prophet said Is is true and as great as it is to look back at history there's no excuse for you to take God out of the picture in your day no excuse it was real then but if it was real then and it's going to be real what happened today it's just as real today it's because we become lukewarm or or fell asleep we've been wooed asleep like a frog where they turned the water up the temperature up really slow man we don't want to be that opposed Jesus to shake ourselves Deuteronomy 11 and 19. here's another example of the Lord telling us to teach our children and ye shall teach your children speaking unto them when thou sit us down in the house and when thy walk is on the way and when thou lies down and when thou raises up and thou shall write them upon the doorposts of thine house and upon thy Gates amen God expects us to make this gospel to our kids it's our duty to get its parents Duty and Ministry duty to get the kids in the spirit of the Gospel train up a child in the way you'll go that when he's old he won't depart from it amen hallelujah you know in Philippians 4 8 it says finally my brethren whatsoever things are true and whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just and whatsoever things are pure and whatsoever things are lovely and whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things there ain't nothing that you can think on more perfect and beautiful and lovely and pure and virtuous than Christ Jesus amen let's just look into some of the things that our Prophet said in some some scriptures here and and we'll go through this quickly you know he said any questions and answers in 64. he said we need to try to help each other he said let me just read he said try each one of you children to help Papa and help Mama and Mama you and Papa you try to help your children and don't never let it gloomy see you know the world's falling apart that's all we talk about I mean I'm preaching to myself more than probably not even to you guys but that that gloominess should become excitement saying oh my God I think God's just ready open the door we see everything falling apart and we should say oh praise it has to happen don't don't emphasize on the negative just turn that completely depositive he said don't never be gloomy on have a non-believing spirit get around you he said we're Christians you're born of the spirit of God and he said you are the salt of the earth and you have the God's right God's given you have the god-given right and if there be any praise or virtue he said don't think on wrong things and then how do you see the glass of water is it half full or half empty same situation spiritually it's half full well it's half empty it's just a negative Slice on it well no God's God's purpose will never be defeated Satan will never touch God's purpose Satan will never touch God's bride yes there will be a great Fallen away but there God's bride won't fall away it's impossible man Hallelujah you see the memorial today he said here here he said this is in the same Italian to the same scripture talking about Joshua and how they put up the memorial and he said he said he said God is coming and the word of God has taken the land uh that God has given me remember God gave them the land down in Egypt said the land's yours but every bit of it now the people today are expecting God to reach down and take them by the neck and say yes that's right you bring me out God you clean me off you healed me God and I'll believe in you God that's all the prophet says he said God don't do his business that way he's given you the promises but you've got to fight for every inch of The Possession amen how do you want to look at the situation around you is just how God you're the anointing will be on you man if you're in the spirit of the world you're going to say oh but if you're in the spirit of Christ and say I can see the dollar Fallen I can see economies falling I could see wars and rumors or Wars that I could see the great falling away in the church and I could see but I can also see that my redeemer liveth and is ready to come and redeem his bride before before the great Dreadful day of the Lord where where Russia and Gog and Magog will come down and take over Israel we won't be here Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus amazing he's talking about here in this quote time-tested memorials about how God delivered them man we already talked about that here's here's a quote here where the Prophet talked about he's talking about you know everybody wants to brag on somebody and and uh you know we we like to be breakdown ourself but he said you could never brag too much on Jesus if you want to brag on somebody brag on Jesus because you know everything we did is because he helped us you didn't become you didn't become healthy this morning because on your own God God give you your health you didn't become a sustainable or well God give you your job God gave their gods it's Gods because that's the way God originated and you know the the prophet had a woman come to him and he said brother Branham he said I got a problem with you he said you're begging too much on Jesus he said I'm begging too much on him he said that he said I can't say enough about him she said oh he was just a man he was just a philosopher and I said he was God it's who he was now he goes into this he even touches on the godhead some and it's beautiful we got time to do this and she said oh no he said he wasn't Divine brother Branham she said I can prove he wasn't Divine said I said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and she said oh he said in a manner of his love and so forth he was God and I said oh no he was Jehovah and the people tried to push him around saying that he was just a good man an ordinary man he was a Divine One but God was manifested in the flesh seen in angels preached onto and received up into heaven sitting at the right the father certainly he was God and he was more than a man he was a God man he was a man in flesh but he was a God in spirit now there you get into the the godhead some and he goes into that more that's what he was God coming down suffering Temptation and martyred to take away the sins unto himself to uh so they weren't passed on to the human race and she says I can prove to you by the Bible if you'll just open up your mind that he was only a man and brother Brown said well if you can prove to me by the Bible that he was just the man I'll believe it she said well when he came down to Lazarus grave on the road there the people were crying around them and the Bible says that Jesus wept she said that proves he was mortal the prophet said he said he might have cried that's true and on his road to meet Lazarus he was a human as far as human is concerned in his flesh he was a human but his spirit he was God and I I said he cried that was a man crying he was a man when he was crying going down to Lazarus grave but when he stood there and straightened up a little bit his frame and said Lazarus come forth he said now there stood Jehovah God a man that had been dead for days he said that was God speaking through there Hallelujah God and his son and God was speaking through mortal flesh corruption knew its master and had to back up believe it saw this and then the prophet goes on he said he was a man when he went up the mountain that night and he came down and looked around he was hungry and he seen the fig tree and it never had no fruit on it and God and a man was hungry and he said he was hungry and he was a man and so he took the that and he cursed the tree he was a man and he was hungry when he took the five biscuits and two fishes and he fed five thousand he said then that was more than a man that was God in a man he said he was a man when he laid on the back of the little boat and ten thousand demons said that we'll drown them in the water and he said he was tired in his spirit because he had been healing and preaching all day that was totally a bad but he said when the disciples came to wake him up and he put his foot on the brow of the ship and said Peace be still and the people said even nature obeys him he said that wasn't a man Hallelujah ain't that amazing Hallelujah he said he was a man when he went to Calvary he said it was a man on Calvary that said my God my God why is Thou forsaken me he said he died like a man but he said on that Easter morning when he raised up and broke the seals of death hell in the grave he said that was more than a man Hallelujah amen Hallelujah you know our children many times all they see is bad but we need to show them the god in the men and it's good to brag on God and tell them what God's done today how God's taking care of you today you know you could think of just in the short history of us being here the things that God did that weak men could not have done those are the things that people can put skin on let me tell you a story about that see see the kids need to see a god with skin on I was talking about this you know we went out we were seeing Jim and Linda and we were visiting different ones and Mike and Kathy and we were talking about if we weren't here in the Rapture and you went by the way the grave and how the grave worked and all this thing and you know we were talking about our own family lineage see my grandparents died before my dad got married so my dad took us to our grandparents gravesite but it meant very little to us because we never met them but do you know and it's to me I'm showing you this for a reason but my great-grandparents Johnny you know where they're at but they're your great great grandparents see how come you don't know about that you're actually packing their DNA but see they're so far removed you don't care huh and that's like the stories in the Bible to our kids and to the world they became just they're so far removed they become on reality but when it happens in your household then it becomes reality you see what I mean so my grant my great-grandparents are buried in Wallaceburg Cemetery over the river with a non-mark grade because they never had no money and none of my family ever could buy a 50 Stone to put to where they are and we investigated some and some of the family and they said well they're buried near this so-and-so Tombstone you'd have to go to the gravesite to find out the exactly that's like telling your kids and they're good but I just give you three examples of where God taught us to tell our kids not what happened in Moses time he never once said tell them about the plagues in Egypt he never once told him but tell them how you crossed the Red Sea he never said don't tell them about the cloud and today and the pillar of fire at night that kept the Egyptians back from Israel he never told them to tell them that you never told him tell him that see I'm not knocking what God did of course not that was Jehovah but what God did in your life today you see we take it for granted we see we God does as a miracle and we just move on and we just don't even but God God wants God the only reason God did only reason God did that for him to get to Glory the only reason that God heard in Pharaoh's heart the only reason that he brought Israel with a mighty hand and the only reason he's bringing you out of this laodicea in Egypt with a mighty hand the only reason if you survive it'll it'll be God it'll be predestination it'll be grace and for him to get to Glory that's the only reason now now let me back then but how could he get to Glory if we never talked about it see the world all knows about David and Goliath and the world all knows about knowing the ark and but they don't know about today God man it's good to brag on God amen break on God today what has God done today her life amen you see how God said show your children when they ask you what God did right now today in Joshua's life he didn't go back to Moses and that was great but he wanted to have a today God because God's God's not age he's not old he's exactly the same rate exactly what happened in the prophets Ministry could happen here today exactly now I I do that was focused on a Ministry of a prophet so it was more now it's that same Ministry is in his body those same things are happening in the body just this week Pastor Sandy from from Uganda was in a major car accident the vehicle probably should have been dead he was in the front vehicle in front of the vehicle he was going to minister God completely delivered him without nothing more than a few aches and pains and the Very place he was going to minister for the weekend it never stopped them from ministering but see if I didn't tell you about that you wouldn't know about that but like how many times have you told the story how me and brother Jim were in a major car accident T-boned by a semi and the semi-accident guy actually ran away knowing that we would be dead but how many times have you mentioned that to your kids Grandpa could be buried in Uganda we don't mention that because we don't see about well well it just it turned out good they're no good no that was God no that was God the the the Demons of hell were trying to attack all the men there was four or five ministers in the van at the same time we're going to minister say Miss Pastor Sandy going to minister and the Demons of how we're trying to stop that and so God even though what God when Satan meant for evil to kill us the trucking company paid me and brother Jim more than our air flight there three thousand US dollars to give us cash I believe it was three thousand so God just paid for it yeah ain't that amazing those are the stories that your kids need to hear they need to hear the stories of Jeff Van Damme when they couldn't have babies for years when they come up and pray God healed them completely they got a house full of boys more on the way did you say oh that was no no that was God that was God amen I was like Abraham and Sarah they were together for years and when God healed them not only did they have Isaac but when Sarah died Abraham married I think two more times and had multiple kids multiple kids when God healed him he really healed them man but we can make these persons sister Patricia never took breathalyzers for years took him all the time prescription breathalyzers for her lungs amazing Julie when she had the back pinched nerve we literally thought it was the time when we would bury her Jared would be a widow and the kids orphans for some reason we don't talk about these stories we don't talk about the stories when we almost had a car accident God just woo man like God tells us in his word for to tell our kids those Stars and you can tell those stories in a way of excitement to your kids that it'll make God a lot you know like the boy that said you know he was screaming in the well because it was dark or the little girl and he told his sister he said listen there's you know everything's all right we're with there's a man here that can turn on the light amen see they needed to see a got your kids need to see a god with skin and if you make it personal you tell your grandkids that Grandpa could be buried in Uganda we'd never be able to go to his gravesite see that makes it parse you know you're not bragging on the person that was involved your break is completely God think of the time that Esther was winning you know with the Manure Spreader and it came out of the ditch on two wheels and it just laid down and just drive away and boom it's perfect you think of all the times you almost pulled out in front of the vehicle and just at the last second God looked and you know you know those gray cards gray blue cards that blend right in with the payment and more than once I've gone to go out and I looked the second time it was right there and I was like oh thank you Lord but we don't tell nobody you don't tell nobody but the Bible tells you diligently it actually don't just tell you to tell them it says to tell them when you raise up when you walk when your journey and then when you lay back down you wouldn't talk about nothing else wow how we look for a church and actually bid on some and thought we were going to rent some really cheap and and and God slammed all the doors and we would have never ever ever you know be careful of the house firm you say never God could make you eat those words I promise they I I thought we'd be like rednecks out in the bush somewhere and we would never ever come this way ever I remember when we came to look at the church the last words Jared said to me when I went out the language I said dad I thought you said we would never go that way high school now would never never never oh wow God almost escaped to us Matt and then God's been with us amen people have grown to bless us and years have went by you're you're raising family that's God that's not that's God man God help us amen it's all right to brag on God we need to make him a personal God a today God today God amen God help God help me God help us all I got help us parents to make you know devotions with your kids that's that's the most it's more important than breathing but you can make devotions a nightmare and just board them straight bored them that's not what God's about God's not about boredom it's all in your approach it's all in your it's completely all in your approach you can make it where the kids would be sitting on their edge of their seat just with like oh or you can make them fall asleep all in your approach the same God but all in your approach and God help us to be in the spirit when we talk to our kids God help us to see these memorials and show them you know how it is when we obey God and it looks ridiculous like crossing the Jordan when it's in its Brim or when we leave Sodom Gomorrah and we disobey God and God leaves Memorials of what you'll be or what you'll be and both those are memorials in the Bible says are there till this day God help us God help us listen amen Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus time tested memorials what God sat in place so the children would desire to know and the parents would tell them amen of the power and the Magnificent of the one and only fantastic true God and how real he is and how concerned he is in your life in your kids life your kids getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and preparing us for a Rapture that will probably happen literally momentarily however that will be you know our Prophet thought that he would not go by the grave he didn't believe he would be now if you believe that prophet and he didn't believe he would go by the grave and you're offended that I say we're going to go in a Rapture momentarily then you don't believe the prophet because he thought he would go momentarily before he died of old age and if he believed he was going to go and he's been gone first how much uh-huh now laodicea is the shortest Church age the Bible says that the Bible says that our Prophet said that said unless he shortened the days would there be any saved and it's becoming Peril it's becoming parallel but the Ephesians Church age the same point you're going home everything there is nothing that don't point to a rapture amen show your kids the excitement of a Rapture it's a real place it's a real place with no heartache and no pain and no suffering oh man you can't do you know the body you cannot even comprehend what God the Bible says that what God has in store for your children in heaven you can't you can't you always said well I'm brilliant I went to school for many years he said you can't even comprehend it's not in the ability of men and we never talked about it and we never talked about it oh God help me God help me God help me to just imagine what he has in store with me paint a picture for your children what heaven will be like the blitz that heaven will be like and it you're going to be off because the Bible says you can't imagine but you'll be you'll be going the right way Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus returning for you and me I've been watching me and I've been waiting just any day now his face I see just any day now my Lord is coming Hallelujah May return thank you Jesus [Music] and I've been waiting a sunny day now his face I sing just any day now my Lord is coming thank you Jesus oh do you believe that you and me oh I've been watching and I've been waiting just any day now his face I see hallelujah it's a weird place out I just want to mention something we'd preached on last week and just [Music] you know it was it had to be God but I feel it's okay to share it with you now one of my main scriptures and one of my main ideas I'd failed to mention but you know in the Bible King husiah was who God told to get his house in order that he was going to die the prophet came by and told him that and he was the man that turned his head to the wall and cried and asked God because he had been a Godly Man and God gave him 15 more years huh the very next chapter Kings from other lands heard of the miracle in his life and heard he had been sick and came to see the king you you can not make the parallel or you can it's your choice the king Hezekiah showed these other kings everything he had on Facebook everything and when they left the prophet came back by the Hezekiah and they said who were those people they said well they traveled from far away land or King's not he said what did you show them on Facebook he said well oh I showed them everything showed them everything in my bedroom and my private Chambers and all my money and banking I showed them everything the prophet said thus say it's the Lord God will take it all from you but he won't do it until you die and your kids will be eunuchs and they'll have no seat you read that Isaiah 39. he never did nothing wrong never does say that he did anything wrong never does say that it showed everything on to a far away land Isaiah 39. the prophet came to him said because you showed them everything God's going to take everything from you and your family will be zero he just won't do it until you're gone and he'll do it to your kids may God help us amen this is this is this truth it's real it's real it's real it's very real that's nothing to be Hallelujah Amy just to me it's just amazing this this this this is not a religion this ain't a story this is genuine real it's more real than the air you're breathing more real than the food you'll eat is your spiritual food make this gospel real to your family to your kids all your approach they will see out of the abundance of the heart you see parents that hate their job their kids will never go into the same job see parents that hate marriage their kids will never marry you see you can go anywhere down there you see parents that hate Canada their kids will move somewhere else you see parents that [Music] hate Church they're will never be there God ain't important you'll be less important to your kids because your kids saying that he wasn't important to you man God help us God help me Our Testimony that our life parallels Our Testimony amen God help me amen let's sing this course one more time as we submit God bless you all jazz jazz [Music]
