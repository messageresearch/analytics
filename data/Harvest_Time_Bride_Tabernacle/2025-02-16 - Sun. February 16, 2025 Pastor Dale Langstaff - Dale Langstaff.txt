just turn to our scriptures John 6:44 and then we're going to read a scripture in John 38 Hallelujah just awesome to have all you here brother bark God bless you must be wild driving on those roads even on good days amen I mentioned last week maybe I I don't think I did to the church we went to the ministers meeting and we almost got sideswiped on the way down and almost got sideswiped on the way home and there was nobody in in front of either Lane for over a mile there was lots of room for all of us but uh they all wanted to be just exactly right where I was I guess amen hallelujah thank God for his protection John 6:44 and no man came to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last day and let's just go to John 38 this is really my text I dwell on this scripture a lot John 38 and the wind blow where it listen and thou hearest the sound thereof but thou canest not tell whence it cometh or whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit of God lord Jesus you know what you've laid on my heart and what's been burning in me Lord God and I pray somehow through the these these poor quality lips that you'll portray it to your people Lord God and and bless your bride here and we know many are out because of the weather Lord God and we understand and especially the ones from far and older Lord Jesus may you take care of them and keep us safe thank you for safety in this winter weather and be with the ones that will watch online many more today may they be bless with your word and your spirit Lord Jesus we pray amen amen you may have your seats and like like I said again we certainly welcome our friends hugely if you want to meet great people there two sitting in the back there that are great people of God that dedicated their life to serve God and and God is an awesome God you know before I go into this scripture you know and I I want to preach on the new birth this morning or talk about the new birth and and you know you've heard hundreds of sermons on the new birth and and we got hundreds of opinions of the new birth and hundreds of understandings of the new birth and and I want to look at all of them and and see what the prophet said and but just for our visitors maybe and the young ones the kids you know it's not just visitors Jared's kids coming out but I want you to understand where the foundation of our church is you know in Revelation John wrote revelation God gave him the revelation of himself you know the beginning of Revelation it said it was the revelation of Jesus Christ it was all about Jesus Christ Our gospel is all about Jesus Christ but God chose men to write the Bible and John was one of them and God in illed man so powerfully like he's doing in this day and has done in this day that John God's servant fell down to worship that man but it wasn't because John really made a mistake I mean he did but it was that man was so full of God he thought it was God and the angel said to John twice in Revelation said he said don't worship me he said arise he said I'm your fellow brother worship God Amen and we still believe that today but we believe that God can so inter Throne a person's being that every breath they take is just Jehovah like the Bible said we are written Epistles read of all men people don't need a living Bible today you know actually the Bible said the letter kth but the spirit give life amen so I mean we believe the letter but but we're we're I'm not leaving the letter but we're almost like we're to the spirit when the spirit of truth comes it'll lead and guide you in all truth the spirit the thought in God's mind that he portrayed on letters you know you know it was mentally and physically impossible for you to comprehend the mind of Jehovah an an omnipotent God and put a word down like unbelievable unst understandable huge I mean those words they just I mean they're okay but they're just I mean God's like woo amen and so you know just for a foundation for a younger ones and believer and then you know we see in 1 Corinthians 11:1 Paul said follow me as I follow Christ and you know I'm not your God and no minister is and no evangelist my goodness I'd be terrible but uh but no man is but you know people people will always look to a a spiritual person and that's all right as long as that person's pointing them to Christ see I it's like over there he's over there you know John said I must decrease so he can increase I'm not the big cheese he's the big cheese but we still read what John wrote in the Bible amen yeah that's and so you know and you know you can share that in the uh the uh you know the five-fold ministry and and God sent Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors those are for the perfecting of the Saints and for the edification the Ed there's WR in the Bible for the edification of Christ but those people aren't God but they're packing God they're packing God but they're not God and so the greatest misunderstanding that people have in in and what we would believe here is we believe in prophets and as soon as you say that word people say well you're worshiping a man well then you must not have a pastor or you must not have an evangelist or you must not have you must not have nobody that you look up to that think was a good God and you know we would repeat anybody's words I I repeated some words last Sunday about uh and I didn't even bring down who it was it's still on my phone was uh anybody that speaks the truth will be hated you know that was just somebody in the states that said that in the 1800 because you know and and if you ever look in the world politics I mean like listen I want to tell you something this this is a great mystery do you know why we always get a terrible government CU people don't want the truth yeah people will believe they want to believe the lie and that's why the dumbest Stones get voted in in every country well I mean if any one of you run for government and you told them the truth you think you'd get a vote yeah you'd get a vote your wife that's right amen amen amen and we also have a foundation in Amos you know everything we preach and and teach is based on the word of God and and we serve God and and you know we also teach this in Amos 3:7 it says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His secrets to the servants the prophets so if you want to find out the mind of God you got to get in a prophet's mind and it don't mean that Prophet will be perfect oh he won't be John was or Paul was a murderer John was you know they all had you know Abraham lied but God still stood with those men because that was God's way and that always they you know that always befuddles people you know and and you know that you know the Bible says a prophet's purly received on his own land he talking about ministers that's why people that know me they say oh I remember brother Dale when he got married oh bless God it's really you want to see a miracle Stephen Judy being here cuz they remember me before I had kids so like that's the greatest Miracle you're going to see today because they remember when I was young and I mean can you imagine a 19-year-old married just think of all the mistakes I made brother Carson amen and that's where people stumble when they're serving God amen amen but let's just look into our message here you know you know when you look at the new birth and everybody's got a dation and you know we studied this when we went to the minister saying and this kind of struck me one of the brothers said something a real young evangelist brother and and it it grabbed hold of me amen and and uh you know I I've heard it preach and if you feel this way I'm praise God I love you too and that's wonderful you know but many ministers have say you know you need to know the day and the hour and the minute drive the steak down and anytime Satan comes and you know buffets you you can bring them right back to this date and you can say you know on January you know boom boom this is where me and God settled the the dude but what really knocked my socks off when we were gone so I'm giving credit to this other brother he said do you remember when you were born naturally well you were there hello do you remember when you were fully born you said I must breathe on my seat you don't remember wow you know I wonder just wonder if the natural tape's the spiritual you know you know I heard it preach that you know praise God a woman couldn't have a baby without knowing she's had a baby and that that's probably very true unless you was on so much painkiller but you know it wasn't the person having the baby that was birthed and you know when did Mary when when the angel come to Mary and said you know you're highly favored above women and all this when did she become filled with the Holy Ghost in the type of a pregnancy you know let's look at our scripture John 6:44 no man come to me unless the father draw him when Mary accepted and become pregnant is when she said be it onto me according to Thy word hello as soon as you you know what you're here this morning not because I'm a great preacher you're here this morning because God Drew you here you're serving God this morning not because you're a good person you had great parents and that could be the case I did but it's because God Drew you back to himself you're here this morning you're serving God because you came from God and God's like a magnet and he's going oh come on back to me honey I need that rib that's right no man chose to serve God I know you think you did but you didn't man's flesh in the garden they ran from God and hid it was God that Drew you it's a mystery you know so you can say the new birth is an experience and that's great praise the Lord it is you can say it's a life praise God it is you can say that you got to die in rot and fall on the ground to bring forth much fruit it is praise the Lord that's the truth you can say it's Christ Jesus yes sir it is hallelujah it is you can say it's the fruits of the spirit and I would say yes it is you got to be careful with that though because there's some really good worldly men that are really kind and you know do great things for the world you can say it's receiving the word and I would say yes sir it is even the word for your day and I believe that but what's the definition of the word for your day you can say it's a revelation of Christ I want to I want to just I I'm not trying to take away anything that's in the Bible and we're going to go through a bunch of them them I want to tell you what the experience of Christ is and it's rest when Christ draws you to himself it'll be the greatest peace you have ever standed understood it'll be peace that passes all understanding it was like what in the world is going on here that's right that's why I don't believe for one second and it was the greatest Deliverance I ever can when I understood the scriptures and this revelation of this day what a prophet brought was every Church in the world preaches fear except Christ there's no love and fear you know if you go to the Catholic Church they say well if you leave us you know you're going to go to hell because we got a pope and if you don't do this and you know and all the churches you know and you could fast forward you know and uh like many people you know they they would believe different things you know but rest and resting in Christ was the absence of fear and this whole Christianity is love affair with Christ and there ain't no fear and love and perfect love cast out all fear now I don't mean that you you know if you're at rest with God and you want to worship God you can lose your mind God won't be scared of noise and neither will brother Dale if you get up and get blessed and get Stone drunk here this morning it won't scare me away and it won't scare the spirit of God away and I want to get really close to you if it ain't me that's doing it but rest is a type of peace that passes all understanding so we see the base of our scripture was no man has come unto me except the father draum so let's go into John and we I we I pray we won't you know I won't bore you but let's go into John 10 and we're going to just skip some scriptures but we're going to start at 2 and 5 and then go to 710 14 and and I'll tell you where I'm at but we see here that whoever enters the Sheepfold the shepherd is Christ Jesus so he's the one that's The Shepherd of the Sheepfold and you know in verse three it says and the Potter which that is the definition of that is the door man or the man that carries the your your your luggage and the scripture just carries right on is Jesus is the door of the Sheepfold so he is the Potter he said the Potter openeth the door and the sheep hear his voice and calleth and he calleth his own Sheep by name and he leadth them he leadth them out who understand God are the ones that came from God yes amen well watch I'm going to I'm going to show you a Bible praise God that's our absolute amen and he putteth forth his own sheep and they goeth out before before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice you know it don't there's a supernatural power to the New Birth when you know God is speaking to you God is speaking to you amen I know he uses ministers and all this but God has a way you know a minister can minister to I don't care if it's a few because of the weather or many but God will speak to somebody in a special way and it maybe just ain't your day today but God knows the time God knows how to deal with the hearts of men amen hallelujah and a stranger will not follow him but will flee from him for they know not the voice of for they know not the voice of strangers and Jesus and when Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheepfold now earlier in the scripture said it was the porter but Jesus was the porter the scriptures actually explaining the scripture now we're Jesus is the one that's guarding who comes in and who comes out and all that ever came to me and all that ever came before me was thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture that's you know what that is go in and go out and find pasture that's rest that's rest if you're on the pasture with the Sheep you know David wrote that amazing the 23rd psalm the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul amen when you go in the pasture with the Lambs and the cows and they're all chewing their cut they're not worried about a missile coming in amen hallelu you and in verse uh sorry I'm just losing my in verse 10 and a thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and destroy but I am come that they might have life and might have it more abundantly you see the purpose in God was to be a blessing amen and I am the Good Shepherd and I know my sheep and am known of mine and other sheep I have watch this verse this is a special verse here verse 16 and other sheep I have now this is Jesus himself talking which are not of this fold uh-oh wait a minute Jesus was ministering to the Jews but the Gentiles hadn't come in yet that's beautiful he said there's other sheep there's a brother Dale that's coming in but I'm preaching to the Jews right now but they hadn't rejected them yet as soon as they reject they blind them temporarily so we could be grafted in and saved he said and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice Hallelujah and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd this was Jesus speaking of the Jews but he knew that there was a gentile bride that he was going to turn his attention to when he was rejected by the Jews Hallelujah but ye believe but if you believe not ye are not my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and know me and they follow me and I give them eternal life there you go who gives you eternal life see you don't get it from the preacher you don't get it by coming to this church you don't get it from all these other experiences in life but you get it from Christ Jesus yes I give them eternal life and they shall never perish and neither shall men pluck them out of my hand now this is a great promise because you know it really don't matter you know you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so it really don't matter what I think of your experience what's you and God think of your experience it it dwells a lot on what God thinks of your experience nobody put M of their hand but in verse 29 it even Goes My Father which they which gave them to me is greater than all and no man no false prophet or minister is able to pluck them out of my hand and watch this now watch this you say well I don't like that some people didn't understand Jesus and I don't like that there were some people didn't understand now he he just he was preaching those words I just read to you and verse 31 and the Jews picked up stones and sought to kill him did I just say something that would make you that angry the only people that picked up Stones were the people that weren't a part of him now I'm going to show you in the scriptures they could have been but they couldn't been you know God gave Cain a space to repent but it wasn't in him to repent because he was of the wicked one he was like Jesus when he was talking to the Sadducees and Pharisees the religious people of the world he said you are of your the Father the devil I bet you they had a new vote in church that day how could Jesus say that this is how Jesus could say that because when you know the Bible says not all that say Lord Lord will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven you know they come to heaven and they say oh Jesus I was a member of the biggest church in Ontario Glory Hallelujah we had a powerful service I seen people healed and laid hands on the sick and all this and Jesus looked right them looked them right in the eye and he said depart from me you workers of iniquity how's that the truth he said I don't even know you you know what that know was now I got a question for you how's Jesus can say with an honest heart say I don't know you because he's omnipotent he knows the beginning from the end he says I'm the alpha and omega the beginning and end you know what the know was it was in the relationship of husband and wife it was a different no and there's about a dozen examples of that in the Bible where the the the the groom would know well you know when Rebeca came to Isaac they went in her mother's tent and he knew her and she became his wife it was a different no man Isaiah 55 6-9 he says seek ye the Lord when he may be found and call upon him while he is near in verse 7 of 55 Isaiah let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous men his thoughts and let him return to the Lord and He will have mercy on him see the wicked people could choose God see the the scripture says that God would that none would be lost but men would choose to go to hell you know you know hell wasn't even made for the wicked people the Bible says that hell was made for the devil and his angels but men said Glory I want to go to hell it was a different kind of person than I am amen and I will have mercy upon him and to and to our God and he will abundantly pardon them here's God saying if you will turn your thoughts to me and accept Christ as your savior I will save you and yet the way to destruction is wide because people are flocking to worldliness and away from God right there that's in Isaiah 55:7 God's saying I will forgive the wicked men if he'll come to me but they won't come to him we're living in that world right now yeah yeah verse eight and my thoughts are not your thoughts and neither are my ways your ways sayith the Lord for I as the heaven is higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts more than your thoughts let's go to John 3 1-8 and I'm going to read some of these scriptures but I want to focus on eight and I want to lay my foundation on the new birth and I want to show you that anything that any Minister tried to cram down your throat of you know you got it when you did this is phony balone from the Bible because it was a mystery that only you and God knew when you got the new birth there was a man the Pharisee named Nicodemus the r ruler of the Jews and the same came to Jesus by night he was he was ashamed that's why he didn't want all his neighbors to know that he was pretending to serve God said RAB we know you're a teacher sent from God for nobody can do the Miracles that thou doest and Jesus answered and said unto them verily verily except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven and Nicodemus he this did not under comprehend this verse four Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born again when he's old can he enter into the mother's womb again and be born and Jesus said verely verely except the man be born of the water and spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and which is born of flesh is just flesh that's just Badger skin it's all going to lay down but th which is born of the spirit is spirit and Marvel not that I say unto you you must be born again you must have a way and I'm going to show this very clearly I Believe by God's grace in the scripture but verse eight so here as the wind bloweth where it listen thou hearest the sound thereof but thou cannot tell hence it cometh and whether it goth so is every man everyone that's born of the spirit of God that's why we have no right to judge our brothers and sisters God never sent us here to be judges we will judge someday but that's when we get on the throne we'll judge the world with him but we're God didn't send us to be judges here God sent us to be saviors and so you can't understand now our Prophet said that you know he said this he said you know sometimes a Son of God will go a long time before you can recognize he's a Son of God he might have been as black as coal amen watch this verse eight so we see this here that it's hard to P so here here I want to show you some some thoughts that the prophet said he said you know it's a mystery when you're born again it's a mystery into the body of Christ and how do you get into it it's a mystery you say well you know I don't have a definite date that I remember you know I feel sorry for the the people that sat under a pastor that made them feel like they didn't have it because they weren't sure when they got it you know what the prophet said he said you got it when you turn back to Christ yeah I I I'll tell you this story he said you know there was a sale C salesman and uh they used this at the thing and and he sold a lady a car and he was complete worldly person he he could care less about God didn't never went to church in his life just wasn't a part of his life and and he sold his car to Ken come back in the salesman the lady was driving away and he said oh he said he reachs in his coat pocket and he said I think I forgot to give that lady the second set of keys for the car and he pulled in his coat pocket he pulled out in the note and the note said where will you spend eternity now it's when you decide and he just threw it in the garbage he no keys in there I don't know what that note is somebody put a note in his pocket and you know there was just watch this this mystery you know that's how God works he's just like nobody around that man would have knew that God had flicked on the light he looked exactly the same what I mean God was getting him to thinking and he thought about that for a minute now now he's never thought of God in his whole life and he thought I'm getting older that was a bit interesting and he went and took the note out of the thing and so you know over the period of his life you know the next 5 years or 10 years you know he went to every Church in in the surrounding town and they told him you know if if you come and join the Catholic well you know if you do your Hail marage you got it you're there you know you done sign the book got to recognize that you know and he went to the madus and they said if you shouted you got it that's it oh you're in you can carry on you know you went somewhere else and they said well if you speak in tongues oh you got it that's it you know you can just carry on you you got all the evidence you need and he went he went to the Quakers and they said well if you're really quiet when you pray and don't breathe oh you got it that's it and so he came to the prophet and he said I want to know if I got Jesus and he said well tell me your story and he told him the story and he all these things and the confusion in the church you know God the Bible says God's not the author of confusion and you know what the prophet told them man he said when you pulled that note out that's when you had it because your thoughts did a 360° turn from the world to like uhoh I'm 50 uh uh uh uh something watch this now that's Bible because the Bible says no man is drawn to God except first he draws them no man can came to Jesus until uhhuh watch that a mystery so you know of course being born again you can put your thing on it you know you can't be born again and deny the Bible you can't you know because you know John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and God became flesh and dwell Among Us that's the flesh that's here now of course it was the Flesh of Jesus in his time but that flesh is gone and now it's the flesh here because of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so anybody that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost G is here today is the word made flesh but God is the word but it's more than the word because the spirit gives life and so you can't say well you know I you know I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and deny God you you can't say I am God and deny God like that that's kind of confusing and you know you're greatly deceived and that's why the people that are not believers that don't have the spirit of Christ will never understand you they look at you and oh there goes a crazy man because they're not on your wavelength they're not in your family you might say they're they're not in the spirit of Christ they're not being led by when the spirit of truth comes it will lead and guide you by all truth they're not being led by that spirit and truth and that's why to them you seem like a gooo because they have a different Master but a man that's born of the spirit cannot take no thought of his own because God that Man's dead cuz see there can't be two people living in one body and so when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's no longer what Paul say it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me so brother Dale is not alive anymore so you can insult me all you want because I'm not even here it's just God so you're actually insulting God made flesh that's why we need to be really careful how we talk to other people because how you talk to me and how I talk to you sister sh is how we're talking to Jesus Christ W who who woo forgive me God woo that puts a whole different light on it can you imagine love to be flowing in this church if we really come to that Revelation who oh help me amen 1 Corinthians 12 13 I'm trying to go fast for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether it be jew or Gentile whether we be Bond or free whether rich or poor and even made to drink unto one Spirit you know the Bible says that God is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen hallelujah so we love that part of it but you know when we become when we get the new birth we're in an immature State and we will grow fast in Christ you know you can speed grow you know you know the Bible talks about those that come in late will go faster than those that come in early amen but you know it's not like the day you the first moment you come to God that you have all the Mysteries all figured out but you will grow in maturity and Revelation you go oh wow I misunderstood God there oh I miss I never heard of that script scripture before but we'll grow and you know you'll be you'll be more when the more you understand Christ the more you'll come into love and the more you'll come into forgiveness because you'll recognize what he's done for you and he'll bring you so you know we must we must give time to those that are immature in Christ they're they're on the way but they maybe just aren't as mature as everyone you know if you give them time and you give them enough of the spirit of God they got to grow you can't stay the same it's not possible you know our little boy I went down to see Oliver the other day and just by the way he's awesome and he loves me cuz after he ate he fell sound asleep and I said I'm good for now to Eternity I don't need to move but he's like 7 and2 lbs you know one time he was in the hospital was under three you can't live you can't say well I'm alive in Christ but I'm not growing no no no no no no no that's not possible only dad men stay the same that's right so if you're alive in Christ you're growing in Christ that's why we'll come to a more understanding more maturity if you're if you're you that's why you know that when God sees you grown he'll give you more and more and more and he'll say you can handle this food I can give you meat and potatoes Hallelujah John 831 says that when the and Jesus said unto those Jews which believed on him he said if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples see it's not who starts the race but it's who finishes the race you know there was a lot of people that we thought had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we thought they had a lot more than the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz they had knowledge wisdom understanding and Revelation and they're not even serving God today that's right wow God have mercy if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples this ain't you know this is like the turtle the turtle won the race the bunny rabbit was at the coffee shop 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a brand new creation and all things are passed away and behold All Things become brand new that's why the world don't understand you because you're a cuckoo because you've changed you've radically changed it's actually not you that's changed you've just surrendered to Christ you've actually surrendered and said it's not me that you know yeah it's it's him you know where do you want me to go today I said you know I was thinking you know today and even the even even I you know you have to understand each other you know we need to labor with each other like you know what I mean like and I was saying God have your own way today like you know should we be here should we not be here oh I'm so sad some won't be here and you know but God you know God knew this before you were born he knew exactly this morning he knew we would have visitors on the day that over half the people aren't here I was like why God like you know they would never believe we actually had a church except that were here on my birthday and you actually seen more people here why why why why is that hen because that's just God you know there's things about God you can't understand why would God ask a person like me to be a minister I you can't you there's just some things you can't understand until you get into the mind of Christ you know the new birth was is a revelation of Jesus Christ it's a great mystery you know Jesus said to Peter and blood did not reveal this unto you but my Father which is in heaven Hallelujah and upon this revelation of Jesus Christ I'll build the church am man you're never going to understand God by education and and cemeteries and seminaries you're going to understand them by praying on your knees and crying out to God and saying God show me who you are that's right understanding the scriptures anybody can read read the script anybody that's got an education can read the Bible and they I mean we have examples of that in the Bible said who could understand unless somebody was sent to show us revelation God help us you know the Bible says and I'm going to preach on this in a couple weeks you know and it's not that God don't want gifts in the church and so you know I mean I'm giving you a twoe nning I hope it don't snow that day but you know we believe in all the nine spiritual gifts and we believe in the five fold is a gift to the Min to the to the body you know and so God's got these old gifts but you got to take these gifts and I know this offense oh forgive me God but you know and we're going to go into it you know the greatest gift all is understand the revelation of the Resurrection it's understanding I'm going in a Rapture I'll be there I'll be there you know how I know I'll be there cuz I've already been there I came from there and I'm not crazy either the Bible says that says an adulterous and wicked generation seeks after signs and miracles so watch and I'm going to go into this some and layth Foundation now this is and I already showed you how we feel about uh a prophet and that but he said you know the church has sought after evidence is too much you say well bless God you know any brother that I would think that should be he should have this shown in his life maybe well bless God anybody that would you know have a position in the church they should have this kind of evidence in their life maybe because the new birth is a mystery that's what brother Brown said he said we seeking after evidence is too much God don't have to give you an Evidence yeah that's what he said you look up the word evidence he said a wicked and adulterous stand and seeks after a sign you know what he said he said God was talking about this generation like God watch this I've had people tell me this God if you're in the church in Wyoming let's see eyes grow out well they said that in the Bible you know when Jesus went to the and we believe God could do that 100% make the blind see and and fix lungs he's done the all look all kind created births and and uh all these things but that's a sovereign God you know when God himself went to the pool he stepped over sick dad people and healed one person that's right and I'll tell you what if I would have been the person he stepped over I would have been offended bless God so what kind of a Jesus are you don't you know I got a sore arm but he said I don't do nothing until the the spirit chose me to do it yeah do I understand that no no I don't understand that but that's what the Bible says and that's how Jesus lived his life amen he said the church world has looked for little evidences and things till they've went off on everything's in evidence we had lots of people we already said that we have lots of people that you've known for your whole life that had all the evidences and they turned her back on God I mean they really turned her back on God I mean they did some you you know what happened to their evidences see that Satan can impersonate anything gifts and callings are without repentance the great Hitler was one of the greatest Ministers of the world bless God do you know I was listening to a video the other you know it was just slightly over 30% of Germany voted for Hitler I've heard his speeches amen Germany the Millennium he believed the German people he take it right to the Bible would live the Thousand-Year Reign that's what all of us are going to do in the Millennium when we go to aen and the people just fell to him like flies cuz he was a great evangelist FSE major false he was a cuckoo that's why they could dehumanize people and go oh and we do this and brother Dale does the same thing in the pastor I know you haven't cuz I can see the Halo but when you talk about somebody you're going boom and you just killed all their account ability and that Hitler was able to dehumanize people it wasn't when those people that killed do you know do you know the ancestors of the people that shot all those people up against the wall are still in Germany hello their grandkids are all there living but he dehumanized the people and that's what's happening in the Christian ranks as we do oh that brother and sister I don't think I don't think they got it I don't like them you just pulled out your machine gun it was invisible but in your mind you did the same sin as Hitler Brown Shirts oh you oh it's not legal to actually murder but you murdered their character and everything in their mind all their influence you just took out of the picture and in your mind you buried them I said I'll never listen to another thing that brother Dale says bless God I got Bible Hitler had Bible too Thousand-Year Reign pulled right out of context I don't know where that came from that that's not in here I didn't I didn't put none of that amen so we got to be careful with you know you know like we need to understand like I I know I know you you can't say you're the word and not believe the word like that's a real good one but we need to let people work out their own salvation with fear and trembling sometimes people are born premature like little Oliver and sometimes he can only take a little bit of food like 10 ms I would have starved to death on what they were feeding him but he got fight on it yeah spir they think spiritual now amen and so the prophet said we need to we need to to to to uh to to to to wait to labor with the weak I I don't I don't mean compromise with the weak I don't mean you know but we need to I'm not saying leave the Bible no no no that that would be sin that would be your back but I'm just saying understand at least and so he said multiple cases where he said we've went to little sensation and breaks ups and little evidences and little this and it separate us hey you know what you know what this is this is good preaching you know the whole Christian angle we all believe God the Lord is God sure got a lot of different churches this great love of Jesus Christ has it brought it together that kind of love who needs eight that's what the prophet saying he said with all these little evanes well you don't see it like I see it it separated the body of Christ he said Jesus never came to give you an Evidence did you feel the tug on your heart he he said a lot about it he said you know the Luther thought when they lived by faith they had it the Methodist thought when they showed it they had it Pentecostals thought when they spoke in tongues they were all looking you know what they were looking for an Evidence they were trying to pin God down there's God right there he's right there but he ain't nowhere else God's everywhere amen you can't put God in a box you can't say well I got God and you don't but that's that's kind of you know what I mean you don't got the God I got what's that mean amen God help us it's not that I it's not that you won't grow in the word the prophet but I mean any of you that want to study that look up just evidence it's a multiple I got multiple examples here he says it's a pitiful shame a condition look at un like L God does do something the whole you know it everything was built on evidence but God is a flower garden you know some could get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and just sit there and quiver some could just ball their face off some are sitting there with a smile and their ears are in the way and they're just going like this and some are like Brother D they're go which one was it it was every one of them it was all because they all felt God pulling them to himself I'm sorry I'm I'm going here let me just go down and and uh I'll break down my here the prophet's talking about evence see it say if we would break down our walls and the greatest gift in the local body if we would put so much emphasis on all these these signs and all these things but he said it's not an Evidence he said it's a spirit of God I mean he said a lot a really lot amen God help us and God help us not to get wrapped up in the here he's mentioned this is in in the late message this is in Traditions and traditions going on after traditions of Elders and all this stuff and and Theology and that you know he he said watch this he said as the wind bloweth John 8 again John 38 as the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound but you cannot tell hence it came you can't tell how God spoke to me you can try to testify I mean we testify and we believe in testifying but how can you understand the testimony of your life or me understand the testimony of anyone in your life it's a great mystery but to individually it's revealed because you can you can't get away from God it's a built-in conscience that's connected to Jehovah amen so is everyone that's born of the spirit of God you can't just put your finger on it that's why in this church we don't have a rule book that well if you do this you're a member praise God sign your name what's that mean amen God help us he said I don't understand how God does the mechanics but he said' I know I got it and I got the blessings of it he said and the mechanics is up to God how he works it out he said that's his great secret wow amen First Corinthians 14 and I'm trying to wind up I'm going to wind up on some scriptures here 1 Corinthians 14:33 for God's Not the author of confus confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints for Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11: 1-2 Now by faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence oh we praise God let's have an evidence that I'm serving God it's not seen well how am I going to do if you're a Christian well you know it'll be that Spirit I'll just I'll just feel comfortable around you cuz you know I don't normally feel comfortable around people that are swearing and cussing and hard and you you know you know brothel places I just I don't know it's I can't even it's just the air it's like when I open the door and O you know the the stuff that you can cut with a knife I'm not really comfortable in those places you won't see it now this is Bible Hebrews 1 Hebrews 11:1 for by it the elders obtained a good report Hebrews 121 therefore seeing that we are compressed about by such a great cloud of witness let it lay aside every way to sin that so easiest beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so we come back to our question I mean I I know Ministers of God that if you ask them this question they would just fall right off their chair do you remember how you felt when you were born you maybe do but you're a supernatural baby in the flesh if you remember exactly how you felt when you were born do you remember what it was like when you first ate or or grew but may is it possible is it just even slightly possible it could be that way do you remember the first time you felt the move I can remember as a little boy going to the Holiness Rock Lake Camp Meeting when I was eight and they would give an altar call and they were preaching Hellfire and brimstone and I would hang on that Pew and I had I had made a sound Arrangement agreement I had a signed contract I will not be going to the altar but be at the altar do you remember how that spirit moves who understands how you know you see what I mean you don't try to put God in a box God's a lot bigger than your brain amen I know he's revealed the Mysteries and the secrets in the Bible and I know it's put there for our understanding and and and and we want to we want to search into it but someday you'll understand more perfectly when you get there and you walk right up the throne say hey Jesus I got a question why are you Colossians 1 26 and 27 even the mystery uhoh what's a mystery something you don't understand even the mystery which has been head for ages from Generations is now being made manifested to the Saints that's through the prophets to whom God would make known The Riches of his glory of the mystery Among Us the Gentiles which is Christ in you wait a minute that's a mystery Christ in anybody that's a mystery the hope of glory so how do we get an evidence for that mystery you can't put your finger on it you know there will be different things happen in different people's life when they get to tug of God on their heart now I want to I want to show you some doctrinal stuff and I'm going to back this up with scripture and I'm going to shut her down you know we don't believe you know if you have eternal life you've always had eternal life because you came from God and we know that from Genesis 1:26 and 27 so you don't become a seed a god when you got saved you always were a seed but you hadn't germinated yet so you could be as black as Sin you could be the Rahab the prostitute in the wall you could be the woman at the well but the Bible says that Jesus had an appointment with that woman and she was predestinated SE to God now I'm going to show you about four scriptures for that predestinated scriptures and and that is one of the greatest hopes for the Christian church is election predestination and what it is is when that seed you know the Bible says you were redeemed back redeemed back as you always were but God took you back to your original beginning amen that's why Cain could never serve God because he never came from God Amen that's why Jesus could say is in the Bible to the S fues and sares he said you are of your fathers the devil now that was that was God I said that see you're redeemed back you're redeemed back to your original state amen you know watch this this is beautiful I love this part you know when God created us in His image he this is Bible you can look this up Genesis 1:26 27 he said he made manale male and female was in one person it was a spirit man and God blessed both that's why we don't step on our wives that that's just that is vomit that that that's vomit from hell that's just well you're not even converted I mean that's just disgusting but God that feminine and masculine the Bible says that male and female were in the spirit of Christ and he blessed them both and then in Genesis 2 and don't I don't know the scripture but it's but Genesis 2 I think 17 and he said then he made man in his flesh and he made Adam and then it wasn't good that Adam dwelt alone and he put him to sleep and he took his rib out from his wife now I want to tell you a great mystery if you want to understand God when you get married on this Earth and you marry your red you think alike you breathe alike your wife likes hot weather like me she loves being gone in January when the weather's bad I mean you're one because you were one in the beginning that's how it you know watch when they asked uh Moses in the Bible why did he do a rightman a divorce but he said it wasn't so in the beginning because a husband and wife were one body in God's mind you came out of God male and female and he took a rib out of the man and and sent her on Earth and praise God God sent me to a campground in Indiana to find my rib that was walking around she'd got way lost way in Cucamonga country and I grabbed her back cuz she was with me before the foundation of the world and that's why when you go to heaven as husband and wife it might you're not going to be there to as as a relationship to produce families but you're going to be there with your soulmate there ain't a single marriage that was made in heaven sorry that's going to be divorced in heaven it ain't possible cuz you both couldn't come from God and one being God sent you separate on Earth as a witness to sat that there would be a bride in the last day and when you die and you go back to Heaven you'll be in heaven together y yeah amen amen you always work together I I I I said I said ridiculous things you know the prophet said he said if you had the wrong wife here when you get to the Millennium you'll have the right right wife there because all wrongs are made right God don't have nothing wrong in heaven and I said if I was going to the Millennium and my wife couldn't be there I don't even want to go that's how much I know she's me and that's the same thing with you and God I know I'll be there cuz I was with them I'm going to show you a scripture about that you know here in John I I I got to go fast but this is just amazing John 3:12 and5 I'm going to give you a bunch of scriptures John 312: 15 and he told if I told you Earthly things and you believe them not how shall I tell you Heavenly things he said no man ascends up into heaven we all believe we're saved and go into heaven now this is Jesus talking in the Bible no man ascends up to heaven but first he came down from heaven how what's that mean that means you know how I know I'm going to heaven because I was already in heaven I already I already know the outlay of Heaven I I got multiple scriptures for you don't don't leave me yet don't nobody get up and walk out no man ascends up into heaven but first he came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven right now and he was on Earth talking to the disciples and Moses lifted up as Moses lifted up the servant in the wilderness even so shall the son of man be lifted up and verse 15 and that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have ever eternal life okay let's go to we already read Genesis 26 and 27 now if you go to Genesis 1 28 or 29 it'll show where it was man male and female in one body let's jump this you want another example of God's election in the scriptures here you know you start the story and I preached this a long time ago but job you know and God God had confidence in job he knew Jo go wouldn't fall and this was before the Holy Spirit was given because Jesus hadn't come the perfect sacrifice this is Old Testament they're still killing lambs and goats saing off their heads so this was a covering this wasn't even the perfect sacrifice and and job you know Satan came before the sons of God Before the Throne and he said what are you doing Satan he said well I'm going out checking out you know who I can tempt and God said did you ever consider job why did God say that cuz he knew who job was he knew Job came from him and he knew no matter what God did what God allowed to happen to him he would never fall and so God God allowed Satan to take everything from job except his breath he even took his health and then he had his so-called friends and wife come by and say ah you're a sinner you big fat no good and then I like this part then Job 38 that's where we want to start the good part job 38:1 and the Lord came to job in a whirlwind and said now I'm going to do some talking we've listened to all these fat preachers preaching the churches but it's about high time that I talk to you and watch what he says here in job 38:1 in verse two he said who is that dark counsel and the words that lack knowledge that's what God thought of job's friends dark counsel and words with no knowledge G he talking to job he said g up your loins like a man and God saying to job he said I will demand of you this answer I this has got to be my favorite scripture he job said where were you God saying to job where were you when I laid the foundations of the world I say I was right there I was right there I was God's measuring tape when he laid her out and said I'm going to make her like this cuz I was in them and he said where were you when the sons of God showed it for Joy I was the loudest one there I was the one that the deacons had to go woo D hold her down don't fly away yet where were where were you you and I preached the whole sermon on of Salvador and that the people went completely wild because I was in them when God spoke the world I was in them when he sent his son to the cross I where were you when Jesus I was right in them Father forgive them for they don't know what they did when they stoned stepen you a man that should have been offended I was right there when he looked up to heaven and the Heaven's open and the spirit of God came down on Stephen he said don't hold this to their Church they're a bunch of lunatics I was right there that's how brother Dale can know that I'll be there again amen and that's Bible That's Bible where were you in the morning St showed it for joy and we go back to verse five where or verse four where were thou when I laid the foundation of the earth declare unto me thy understanding God wants job to understand that he came from God and he was in heaven and God sent him to Earth to prove to Satan that job wouldn't fall and and job did that and God re blessed job back with everything he had ever taken let Satan take from him and he told Satan see I told you did you ever consider my man job but today he's saying did you ever consider those crazy people in Wyoming you just try to charge them you just try to lay something on their hands they'll never curse me amen watch this and he said verse seven where where I late where were you whereupon when the foundations were laid fastened or who laid the Cornerstone and when the morning started saying for joy and all the sons of God showed it for Joy where were you and God saying to job I demand that you answer me job would say well I don't know no no if there was something that held them you know we're just closing I'm just going to finish on two or three uh election scriptures you know Genesis 4 2 to8 I'm going to show you where God gave room for Cain to repent and in verse Genesis uh 42 and she be Cain or she be Abel and Abel was The Keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground in verse three and it was in the possession of time that it came that came bought the fruits of the ground the offering to the Lord but Abel had a rub Revelation and he also brought the first of his flock and the F thereof and the Lord had respects un Abel's offering but to Cain's offering he had not respects now that's just the mystery I mean you can get upset with God all you want but that's just what happened God liked one person's sacrifice and he didn't like the other person's sacrifice can I explain that it's just God's choice he's God Amen and Cain was very rot and his countenance fell in verse six and this is where I want you see and the Lord said to Cain why are you wroth and why is thy countenance fell if thou doest well and would follow the word of God would follow the Revelation that your brother has that it's blood and not flowers he said if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted God would have totally accepted Cain if he would have brought the same sacrifice as Abel but instead Cain chose to kill him his brother it was an Inc to repent let's go to and I'm I'm I promise I'm closing Romans 9:13 uh 16 and 18 and here's this uh another scripture of election and it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he said unto Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion and that's what we want to see in the New Birth is we don't want to step in the way of Jehovah God and God might want to save a really really black sheep that's a prostitute or a murderer or in prison or jails or chains of bondage or alcoholic or or smok and drugs or anything but that could be a part of God's seed and it don't look like it yet but that's God's choice I will have mercy and compassion on whom I will have mercy and so then is it not him that so then is it not us that willth or him that runneth but God that showeth Mercy now there's a scripture that shows that it ain't your decision that you're serving God I mean you you'd have I mean other than the part is be it unto me according to Thy word but it was God no man comes to the father but God draws them amen and this scripture shows this so then it's not me that will oh I want to be a good Christian I want to go to the best church or him that runneth but God that showeth Mercy in verse 18 therefore has he mercy upon whom he will have mercy and a upon whom he will harden he will harden see God is Sovereign and it's God's understanding God knows before the beginning Romans 811 Romans 11 and then 28 and 30 and I'm just showing you three or four pre election scriptures to prove in the new birth how we know we'll be there Romans 81128 and 30 Romans 8 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead so also Quicken your mortal bodies and his spirit that dwelleth in you and verse Romans 8: 28 these are our favorite scriptures here verse 28 and I know that all things work together for good to them that love God to whom are called according to his purpose verse 29 for whom God did Forno how did he Forno you well you were in him and he's omnipotent for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of him himself his son that he might be the firstborn of many brethren in verse 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called that's when you gave your life to God he called you and you came to an altar of forgiveness and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified he's already glorified now God already sees you in heaven God don't see this snowstorm he already sees you converted in heaven now if God sees you in heaven do you see yourself there God sees you there I mean I mean if you don't like that scripture like you're you're dead I mean there I can't give you nothing that you're in like Ephesians 1 3 to 14 now this is I'm sorry this is a long one but I'll just pick out the pieces here Ephesians 1: 3-14 blessed be God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in whom Christ according that he has done what wait chosen me wait a minute it was me that chose God oh thank you brother oh God chose me in him oh I was in him oh this is Bible before the foundation of the world wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predes predestined ated us to the adoption of the children of Jesus Christ in him according to the good pleasure of your will no no no no no no it's God's plan God knew who he would love God knew who would love him to praise and glory and grace wherein he has made us acceptable wait a minute if you knew all the sins I committed in my you know what the Bible says don't hold the stupid sins of my youth to my charge oh that's amazing grace boys and that's amazing grace amen where was I uh verse seven in whom we are redeemed through his blood and forgiveness of sin and according to his riches and his grace verse eight wherein he has abundant abund abounded towards us in wisdom and Prudence vers vers n having made known unto us the oh there you go that mystery stuff again see we're trying to put God God my God's exactly like I don't know what he's like he's a mystery he's new every morning you know what he's like today you'll be different next Sunday you know what if you want to see a real life God you come a couple times to church every service is different cuz who's the boss Gods to had yeah we don't have nothing planned it's up to God unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the pred Redemption of the fullness of time he might gather together one things in Christ both which are in heaven which are in the earth even in him oh wow we're going right back to where we came from and whom also we have obtained The Inheritance W you know you know the people have obtained inheritance are children oh but God's my father and he owns a cattle on a thousand hills and he's given me a lot of grace and mercy see I obtained an inheritance being predestinated there again see God really wants you to get this according to the purpose of God in him whom worketh all things after the Council of his will my will no no no no no I'm dead I'm not alive no more it's not me that liveth but Christ that liveth in me his will verse 12 that we should be the praise and glory whom first trusted in Christ in whom ye have trusted that after you heard the word of Truth the word of Truth is the word in the Bible the spirit of truth that the gospel of your salvation in whom after also ye believed and ye were uh-oh you mean I was sealed till I get back to Heaven yeah uhhuh God didn't do no work that was short term sealed in the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of your inheritance unto the Redemption of the purpose possession unto the praise and glory now if you don't believe in election this morning and predestination uh you got a different version of the Bible than I got Jeremiah 1:4 to9 Jeremiah 1: 14-9 and I'm I'm proving to you that I was in God and I come back to God and that's the reason I know I'll be there when I go in the Rapture or with this death takes me before the Rapture Jeremiah 1 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the Bley I knew thee wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute God n you didn't have nothing to do with that that was my mom and dad whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa before you were formed in the belly I how did he know me cuz I wasn't even formed yet because I was coming from him I was spoken word God said you go down to OT and hell and langstaff and you got to have an eighth child and it's going to be some scrawny squirt that's going to be born like a giant you know I was almost almost almost 11 PBS in the hospital when I was born I was eating faum within two or three days and I could hold my head up and look at the nurses out of the glass thing and they were taking pictures and they were giggling and thought I was half grown when I was born that's a true story amen he knew me before I was formed and before thou camest forth from the womb I sanctify wait a minute wait a minute it was my decision to come to God that's not what that Bible says I was in a I was in the service and they had this Dynamic evangelist and the power of God fell and I made a decision to come forward to give my heart to God that's not what the scripture says says I Sanctified the before you were even making decisions Hallelujah God didn't leave nothing to chance Hallelujah and before I came forth in the womb I San if I Thee and I ordained thee a prophet to the Nations Hallelujah and if you go down to the bottom of verse 8 n and then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and said the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth and my last scripture is a habca I think I'm saying that right ha akk UK Haba man you can't get too biger words for this old dummy habca 15 and we're going to close in this scripture I got a blank screen after this so we're good to shoot man behold ye among the heathens and regard and wonder marvelously for I will work a work in your day which ye will not believe though it be told of you wow only the ones that can believe are the ones that were there to begin with it's a great mystery the new birth so how can you pin down do I got the new birth it's you and God and you'll know when your heart turned to Christ and you'll know when God threw out the fish hook and he started pulling you in you were swimming the other way God was like no no you don't you can run with me you can be the prodical son you can run away and go to the pig pen a long time but when you come to your senses it'll be God waking you up someday and you go you know I got a God in heaven that treats his better than the Satan's treating me you ever see Satan treat anybody good he eat devour and Destroy his own he said I got a daddy that his servants eat better than I do with the Hogs they give the Hogs the Grain and I get the hostage left over but you know the amazing part the greatest part of that whole story is the daddy you know God works on both ends how did the daddy know that the son was coming back the the Bible says that he was out there and seen the sun returning a far off and he said wo kill the fatty C and get out of gold ring and put on ownership on his finger you know how he knew it because God had gave him your children are your heritage you believe for you and your household the Jailer what must I do to be saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and Hallelujah Jesus amen you know you know God help me and maybe maybe maybe this would be something for you but we can't put God in a box that's right God God's spirit of life will work different in each one a use and when you say I got God you know you know the prophet said that if you come before somebody and say I know everything there is to know about God run for your life run for your life cuz you just met the first liar or the biggest one now I I I know I believe that God you know like Amos 3:7 he says he would do nothing but he re his Secrets through His prophets I believe God has come and showed us what who he is in his word and I believe the Mysteries are open in the Bible and I believe we can understand Revelations and I know that the seals were open and and I know I'm going back in a Rapture but when you say you know like the guy that is in uh where is he in Florida he put his whole life to proving God and he has great videos out where he can show where the children of Israel not that I need to see that to believe it you you sent me some of them brother bar you know he can show where the children of Israel cross the Red Sea and they they know where the rock is where the water come out of the rock and you know he'll go and show you where the ark is you know everybody knows that the Army knew that during the war but he put put his whole life to prove God you know and there's a video out there where there's this guy and he's asking him to identify God by feelings and you know he didn't believe God could be a spirit and affect the human body and oh boys that guy he just you know you know Satan he's kind of he he needs more school he saidwell if you can't understand how a spirit could affect a human body then you'd have to understand you'd have to explain to me emotion and love you love your wife well I'd like to have some of that love can I buy it what do they sell it at the dollar store emotion he said if your emotions are just a whole bunch of scrambled stuff that was like poof and you he said I'm not so sure I'd feel safe in your emotion world yeah yeah he was explaining how anyway he goes and says that he said you know the god that created the computer ain't living in the computer he's outside of the computer and he knows all about the computer but he was a mastermind of the computer but he's in the universe God is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth and when the spirit of truth comes it will lead and guide you in all truth and watch this he said if the god you're serving this morning you can completely understand and your three-b brain is it's not the God I got that's right because my God is above your three-b brain there's not a man on the universe that could put their finger and say that's God that's God there that's God there that's God there he's over here and he's here and he's in Uganda and he's in El Salvador and soal America and and Africa and and then the Rapture comes place there will be a many member bride there will be lots of surprises too but there will be lots of lots and lots of Believers from all over the world God's not just saving wyomi and Canadians and ontarians there'll be a many membered bride man what I'm trying to tell you is Our God's amazing that's just in a nutshell he's amazing and the New Birth when you when you come to the Revelation that it's Christ Living in you Yen you'll just you I tell you what you can just go to bed and whether you got a pillow or you don't got a pillow or whether you got a good mattress or you don't got a good mattress you can just drop that old head back and you'll just you know the people that serve the devil you know when that I don't even want to say his name but that when that one crazy man that played basketball served the devil they tried to S charge his doctors for suicide cuz he'd offered some of the doctors like $100,000 if they'd give him 6 hours of sleep with drugs because he was so possessed with the devil he was so tormented that Satan was eating them from within and he was asking the doctors to put me to sleep with drugs cuz he didn't know what rest was I want to tell you something there's a God in heaven that can give you peace that passes all understanding and he can give you rest in your soul that it won't matter who's leading the states it won't matter who's leading Russia won't matter who's leading this country I mean even though we would hope for the best in the flesh it a piece that passes all understanding that my God is in control amen and he knows the beginning from the end and he's like the authority you know when the angel come down in Revelation he put a he God put his foot on the land and put his land on the sea and he said I am all of it I am it I'm the boss wow he's amazing
