[36:45] 14-23 you know
[36:47] i i you know satan was telling me when
[36:50] we were
[36:51] when i was studying
[36:53] i believe it was satan he said you know
[36:56] half the church is going to believe
[36:57] you're preaching raid at them
[37:00] the other half won't have a clue why i'm
[37:02] even preaching
[37:04] amen
[37:06] amen
[37:08] but we know that was god
[37:10] amen god you know our prophet taught us
[37:13] something that we don't think of very
[37:14] much you know people in our day are
[37:16] looking for miracles and signs and
[37:18] wonders and something to prove that
[37:21] god's got
[37:23] the same yesterday today and forever
[37:26] and right now
[37:27] today in this setting
[37:30] our prophet said is the greatest miracle
[37:33] that god ever did
[37:37] let me show you what the quote said
[37:40] he said the very hardest thing
[37:42] that god ever did was not saving your
[37:44] soul
[37:46] wasn't filling you with the holy ghost
[37:48] wasn't keeping you safe
[37:50] and it wasn't bringing you back to
[37:51] heaven
[37:54] it was getting one man
[37:56] to believe another man
[37:58] was use of god and speaking for god
[38:01] that was the very hardest thing
[38:06] the that hardest
[38:08] and i listened to a message
[38:10] yesterday
[38:14] back in april
[38:23] wow
[38:24] i'm not even the spare tire
[38:27] man when you listen to yourself preach
[38:28] it's like oh wow
[38:30] it's america anybody comes back the
[38:32] second time to hear me preach
[38:34] amen
[38:37] but god somehow
[38:39] and just a bunch of scattered
[38:42] men
[38:43] can bring glory man that's just what god
[38:45] the bible says through the foolishness
[38:47] of brother dale's preaching
[38:49] you'll come back next sunday
[38:52] and when i listened to myself i saw
[38:54] wow
[38:56] amen but that was god's plan amen
[38:59] what's god's plan
[39:01] man sure not man sure not man let's
[39:04] start at verse 13
[39:05] amy
[39:07] now we're we're living in a unique age
[39:09] this layout of cnh
[39:11] and uh i'm not saying you know a prophet
[39:13] is a foreseer and he sees things that
[39:16] are to come
[39:18] and and i'm sure that god showed us our
[39:21] prophet where we were but we're living
[39:23] in a unique spot in history
[39:27] and it requires a unique message
[39:30] for this very time
[39:32] amen i i really believe that god
[39:34] believes this this is god
[39:36] this morning let us not therefore judge
[39:39] one another
[39:40] anymore
[39:43] that's pretty plain
[39:45] but judge this rather that no man put a
[39:48] stumbling block
[39:50] or an occasion to fall in his brother's
[39:55] way
[39:56] now we're not we're not
[39:58] this is a real paradox
[40:03] what that scripture is saying is you may
[40:05] be doing something that you have peace
[40:06] with
[40:08] but your brother might not have peace
[40:10] with it
[40:11] and so when you're with that brother
[40:14] don't expose that brother to what you
[40:16] have peace with
[40:21] now here comes the atomic
[40:23] and that can be social media
[40:30] see you may be at perfect peace at what
[40:32] you're doing
[40:34] but your brother may stumble on through
[40:36] social media
[40:38] let's read on
[40:40] and i know that i am persuaded by the
[40:42] lord jesus that there is nothing unclean
[40:44] in itself
[40:46] that gives us a lot of freedom
[40:49] but to him that is esteem anything
[40:52] to be unclean to him it is unclean
[40:55] that see some people see things
[40:58] differently
[41:00] okay
[41:01] but if thy brother be grieved with thy
[41:03] meat
[41:05] now i mean it's pretty obvious that
[41:07] brother dale likes steak
[41:09] now walk is thou not charitably
[41:12] destroy not thy brother
[41:14] with thy meat
[41:17] i don't fully understand this i'm
[41:20] preaching but i'm i'm fully
[41:24] for whom christ died now see christ died
[41:27] for your brother and you could be
[41:29] tripping him but christ paid the
[41:30] ultimate price for him
[41:35] you can say well bless god that's his
[41:37] problem
[41:39] god didn't feel that way when he died
[41:41] for him
[41:44] see
[41:46] social media
[41:49] learn not then your good be evil spoke
[41:52] enough
[41:55] for the kingdom of god is not meat nor
[41:58] drink
[41:59] no no this is you're not going to
[42:01] believe what your prophet said about
[42:02] this
[42:03] first
[42:04] but righteousness peace and joy
[42:07] and the holy ghost
[42:08] we are free in christ
[42:11] for he that is in these things
[42:14] service christ is acceptable to god and
[42:17] approved and approved of men
[42:21] let us therefore follow after the things
[42:23] which make for peace
[42:25] and the things wherewith may
[42:27] one may edify
[42:29] the other
[42:30] hallelujah for meat destroyeth not
[42:34] the work of god and all things indeed
[42:36] are pure
[42:38] you getting this
[42:40] but not all
[42:41] is
[42:42] but it is evil for that man that eateth
[42:45] with the fence
[42:50] it is good neither to eat flesh nor to
[42:52] drink wine neither anything whereby thy
[42:55] brother stumbleth or this or is offended
[42:58] or is made even
[43:01] weak
[43:05] has thou faith
[43:08] habit to thyself before god
[43:11] happy is he that condemneth not himself
[43:14] in that thing
[43:16] which he alloweth
[43:20] for he that
[43:21] doubteth is damned if he eat
[43:25] because he eateth not
[43:29] by the faith
[43:31] see
[43:31] you're saved
[43:34] it's just one law
[43:35] faith
[43:37] god died for the world but they're not
[43:39] saved because they didn't have faith
[43:42] not of faith for whatsoever is not of
[43:45] faith
[43:47] is sin lord we ask you to just bless us
[43:50] and unveil and show your word to us in a
[43:52] special way we pray
[43:54] your beautiful name
[43:56] amen you may have your seats this
[43:57] morning
[43:58] i'm just going to take the first
[44:02] verses
[44:04] i was going to go a different way this
[44:06] morning and i'm just gonna
[44:08] i'm just gonna sit that right over there
[44:10] for the time being
[44:12] amen just by god's grace amen you know i
[44:15] i tend to just have too much to bring
[44:19] many many times i want to read you
[44:21] something
[44:22] that a prophet said
[44:24] and a
[44:25] harvest but here's how elijah
[44:29] he said there was a lady who spoke
[44:32] to one of our associates here
[44:34] he names the person out in the camp and
[44:36] i been out there with her husband
[44:38] fishing
[44:39] and brother bosworth
[44:42] and had told me a little joke
[44:45] and i had repeated it
[44:47] to her husband
[44:49] and it was a simple little thing
[44:52] i i just a simple i said there was a
[44:55] little boy standing looking at a
[44:57] uh
[45:01] the crawl of his baby was there and it
[45:03] was born a couple days before and his
[45:05] feet were sticking up
[45:07] and his little germs were hanging there
[45:08] and he
[45:10] squirreled like
[45:11] it was a brawling like a storm and the
[45:13] little mother looked at the little
[45:14] feather standing
[45:16] and he said mom
[45:17] did you say this baby
[45:20] came from heaven
[45:22] the the the older kid was was watching
[45:25] his baby brother and he was trying to
[45:27] figure out the whole process
[45:29] of this baby came from habit
[45:32] and why it was ugly or not ugly
[45:35] amen
[45:36] and the mom said yes son for sure it
[45:38] came from heaven he said well no wonder
[45:40] they put them out
[45:44] amen is it no wonder they put them out
[45:47] well that to me was just a little joke
[45:49] now this is a prophet
[45:51] this is a 59.
[45:53] that was oh he said to me that was just
[45:55] a little joke sure and i was over and we
[45:57] were looking at something and paul said
[45:59] he doesn't mean be a stumbling block in
[46:01] my brother's way and i would and i would
[46:04] eat it no more the world's standards he
[46:06] said well the man was just uh
[46:08] he thought it was hilarious
[46:11] and he told it to his wife
[46:13] uh-oh
[46:16] and she said
[46:17] and the man was the wife was hugely
[46:21] offended
[46:23] and the man tried to justify he said but
[46:25] brother branham's in these meanings and
[46:27] he's all keyed up
[46:29] and he's under the anointing of god and
[46:31] he's seeing visions and things until he
[46:34] just has to go relax now i had brother
[46:36] let me throw this in here this is fresh
[46:38] he said you know some people think
[46:39] you're going to stay under the anointing
[46:40] of god nonstop and believe me it's good
[46:43] when you're under it really good but our
[46:45] prophet said that he would explode if he
[46:47] stayed under it all the time
[46:50] explode
[46:53] so yeah it's good and i want it every
[46:55] sunday i want it more than every sunday
[46:57] but you would explode
[46:59] you're under it all the time and this is
[47:01] how his wife came back to her same
[47:03] husband her husband she said but you're
[47:05] not brother branham
[47:07] so you're not in those kind of meanings
[47:09] and anointing in other words
[47:11] why are you telling this joe
[47:15] and this our prophet answered he said
[47:16] you see it put a stumbling block
[47:20] and we have to
[47:22] watch
[47:24] what we're doing
[47:26] uh-oh
[47:28] and god's going to
[47:31] judge us
[47:32] for the way we put on facebook
[47:36] and social media
[47:40] the things that we do
[47:42] i paraphrase those last six books
[47:45] the way that we act and show
[47:47] now you see the bible clearly told us
[47:50] that all things are pure
[47:52] for us
[47:54] right i mean you could pull that back to
[47:56] the first part of our scriptures maybe
[47:58] amy show us where it was pure all things
[48:00] are pure but let's actually maybe maybe
[48:03] before you do that amy let's go to uh
[48:05] first corinthians 10 23.
[48:08] and we'll we'll just lay a foundation of
[48:09] the word of god and then we'll look into
[48:11] the the message now now remember i'm
[48:14] gonna i'm gonna watch you you you your
[48:17] first result
[48:18] is it's not my problem
[48:22] but the bible said it is your problem
[48:23] god's making it your problem because
[48:26] christ died for thy brother
[48:29] period
[48:33] and the bible says he will doubly make
[48:35] it your problem because he's going to
[48:37] judge you
[48:39] because you didn't think twice
[48:41] oh
[48:44] but that don't make it wrong what you're
[48:45] doing
[48:54] all things are lawful for me
[48:56] but all not all things are expedient
[48:59] all things are lawful for me but not all
[49:01] things
[49:04] edify not
[49:09] let's go back to first corinthians 12.
[49:11] does everything be established by two or
[49:13] three witnesses
[49:14] this will be our third scripture
[49:17] we had romans corinthians
[49:19] this is all from paul and paul wrote
[49:21] grace and he's telling us you got grace
[49:25] but your other brother might have a
[49:26] different
[49:28] portion of grace
[49:32] a lot of times i understand first
[49:34] corinthians 6
[49:35] 12.
[49:36] a lot of times it's carryovers from our
[49:38] upbringings
[49:39] or
[49:41] whatever something you know there's
[49:42] different reasons we catch all things
[49:44] are lawful unto me but all things are
[49:46] not expedient now this is a different
[49:48] scripture we're almost the same all
[49:50] things are lawful unto me but i will not
[49:52] be brought under the power
[49:55] of facebook
[50:00] man
[50:02] i'll have a confession i used to sew
[50:04] sometimes pictures on facebook on my
[50:06] farm
[50:07] i quit doing that
[50:09] because i would've had to give them all
[50:10] away
[50:12] anybody seen your farm
[50:14] wanted it
[50:17] matt
[50:19] amen
[50:21] see
[50:22] we have to be careful
[50:24] on what we do now now it's very clear
[50:27] that what you're doing i want to show
[50:28] you give you peace it's not necessarily
[50:31] wrong
[50:34] i want to i want to
[50:36] read
[50:38] is it all right to read our prophet we
[50:39] can we're
[50:40] we're home crowding man
[50:43] and and i want you i want to just maybe
[50:47] it'll be different than it ever was but
[50:49] you know the prophet has a way of
[50:51] bringing something
[50:52] and it's a lot slower when i
[50:55] actually read the quotes but it gives a
[50:56] different
[50:58] thing and in time we're going to get it
[50:59] so we can share it up here and and for
[51:01] sure for sure if you have a question on
[51:04] the quote you say i just
[51:05] can't believe my prophet said that oh
[51:07] like don't run away from me just come
[51:09] back i'll show you the exact quote
[51:12] i have it right here if i don't have it
[51:13] normally i have a paper but today i have
[51:16] some on my ipad
[51:18] amen
[51:21] hallelujah
[51:24] and questions and answers 6408 23 in the
[51:26] evening somebody asked brother branham
[51:28] should a christian woman wear simple
[51:30] jewelry
[51:32] necklaces or pearls
[51:34] i want to jump in here and show you that
[51:36] we were raised i was raised not we i was
[51:39] raised wesleyan holiness
[51:42] and the prophet talks about that and he
[51:44] gives a scripture in the bible
[51:46] and he says the nazarene he said if you
[51:48] were a nazarene person
[51:50] and you were coming in the church to get
[51:52] baptized and you had a wedding bed they
[51:55] would deny you
[51:57] because you were of the devil
[51:59] you say well they're ridiculous well no
[52:01] they actually have a scripture for it
[52:04] amen
[52:06] now they've taken that scripture out of
[52:07] context
[52:09] but they still have a scripture for it
[52:11] and i my desire i hope you believe me if
[52:14] you come back my desire is never to take
[52:16] the prophet or the scripture out of
[52:18] context
[52:19] i do not have an agenda brotherhood
[52:21] amen
[52:23] it's never ever the case but i want to
[52:25] balance things sometimes you've never
[52:27] heard of balance
[52:29] and i'm going to show you some stuff our
[52:31] prophet said that i would
[52:34] guard to you you have never heard
[52:36] over the pulpit
[52:39] i would wait here to say that
[52:41] i say i sure never have
[52:43] because it's it's on the far side of the
[52:45] road but see you got to get this side of
[52:47] the road and this side of the road and
[52:48] bring them
[52:49] in the middle
[52:50] and we i don't want to be over here
[52:52] today and i don't want to be over here
[52:53] but i want to bring it right in the
[52:54] middle
[52:55] and so if you've only heard this side
[52:57] and you've never heard this side then
[52:59] we're actually over here
[53:01] but we want to be here and not over here
[53:02] or over there
[53:04] amen
[53:05] amen
[53:07] so and this is a unique time because
[53:09] never before has have we had a social
[53:11] media internet
[53:12] operation like now
[53:15] and it in itself is not evil
[53:19] amen i if i went off facebook there's
[53:21] brothers that i would never ministers
[53:24] that i would never see or talk to ever
[53:26] again
[53:27] on messenger on facebook
[53:30] because you would have no connection
[53:32] period
[53:33] amen
[53:35] uh you say because the you know it's
[53:37] just
[53:38] something that god is you can use but
[53:40] everything that's good can be evil
[53:42] because satan comes in and perverts it
[53:45] and he really perverts it
[53:49] our prophet said tv was met for good
[53:52] but hollywood turned
[53:54] uh-huh okay
[53:58] amen so here's the sister he said i'm
[54:01] just gonna
[54:02] paraphrase the first scripture and when
[54:04] we get to where you know he said there's
[54:06] uh
[54:08] he quotes the scripture he said now when
[54:10] you adorn he said do not adorn yourself
[54:11] with costly jewels or pearls or kind of
[54:14] wearing jewelry but let it be the
[54:16] adorning of peace and quiet and a meek
[54:19] spirit now that's the scripture that the
[54:21] nazarene and the holiness raise
[54:24] see it says don't wear gold or silver or
[54:26] boarded hair or that but let the holy
[54:28] spirit be your beauty on the inside that
[54:30] will shine to the outside which is in
[54:33] meekness and subduity and humble and
[54:36] don't be able to
[54:38] see that that's that's especially like
[54:41] see that's just disgusting
[54:42] you know especially in anybody it's
[54:44] disgusting but especially sister
[54:47] man
[54:49] so they grab on to that and and
[54:53] i have the perfect perf personal
[54:56] experience being my wife after we get
[54:57] married our preacher that we ask to
[54:59] marry us that's having his 94th birthday
[55:02] soon he's still alive 90th birthday
[55:06] refused to marry us when we told him we
[55:08] were gonna have wedding beds
[55:11] now he's still alive we still visit him
[55:13] he's one of my wife's best friends
[55:16] so
[55:17] so they feel strong about it
[55:22] see
[55:25] and he goes on and
[55:27] he says you know
[55:29] he talks about like if you he said it's
[55:31] natural to want to look beauty beautiful
[55:33] and and these different things say man
[55:35] and
[55:36] and uh
[55:37] so then a sister comes up
[55:40] and uh
[55:42] asked him now it was or he's telling
[55:45] about it you know he talks about the
[55:46] nazarene won't baptize and he says he
[55:48] says
[55:49] well here let me read it he said now i
[55:51] don't mean sister he said if you have a
[55:53] pen
[55:54] or to me he said now this is not the
[55:56] lord he said but if you had a pen that
[55:59] you wanted to wear or like a little
[56:01] necklace that your husband give you or
[56:03] maybe something like that that you wore
[56:06] now to me
[56:07] i don't think it's bad
[56:10] but he now watches but now he said now
[56:12] remember i make myself clear that's just
[56:15] my opinion
[56:19] amen see the bible actually says
[56:20] different
[56:22] but it's
[56:23] to say it says different is taking it
[56:25] out of context
[56:28] because ultimately the bible's saying is
[56:30] have the beauty of the lord inside and
[56:33] it will shine on the outside
[56:35] okay
[56:37] okay but so the prophet's laying this
[56:39] down and then he said he said if a woman
[56:46] he's talking about wedding bands and you
[56:47] know and all this and
[56:50] and he says but don't go in and you know
[56:53] go in a uh wear uh
[56:55] like a dime store and make it look like
[56:57] you had a magnet on everything stick to
[56:58] you
[57:00] and he said
[57:01] he said a woman if a woman wants to
[57:03] dress and make himself look decent and
[57:06] clean and ladylike why i think that's
[57:08] not the thing to that to me
[57:11] he said why get going and put on the
[57:13] thing that makes you
[57:15] uh making it a little pride then you're
[57:18] wrong if you know and he said he said
[57:20] watch this you know brother wade
[57:21] preached this this one message i totally
[57:23] said your motive and objective and the
[57:25] prophet said here he said what's your
[57:27] purpose your attitude
[57:30] everything's your motive see you know
[57:33] why are you showing this
[57:35] you know amen he said you know he said a
[57:37] woman that dressed indecent for her to
[57:39] go out he said she has a demon on her
[57:41] because she's revealing herself to the
[57:42] city
[57:43] man
[57:44] your motive
[57:46] an objective he said
[57:49] but he said there was a girl came to me
[57:51] which was a drunker girl and had just
[57:53] received the holy ghost and she belonged
[57:55] to the assemblies of god and was in fort
[57:57] wayne indiana where i got married at and
[57:59] she came to me a fine little lady and
[58:02] asked me brother branham he said i want
[58:04] to ask you a question
[58:06] now this is a quo you've probably heard
[58:08] part of this quote but you've never
[58:09] heard the middle
[58:11] and i said yes right sister what is it
[58:13] she said well do you think it would be
[58:15] wrong for a christian girl to wear a
[58:17] scandal skirt
[58:19] and i said sister now this one thing i
[58:22] can't understand he said what is even a
[58:24] scandal scared
[58:28] and she told me what a scandal skirt was
[58:30] and she said you know it shows you're
[58:32] underneath garments of a lady it was a
[58:35] little bit shorter skirt and they would
[58:37] have fancy frizzy underwear and the
[58:39] underwear was longer than the scarf
[58:42] and our private answer is he said see he
[58:44] said now what is a woman when a woman
[58:47] what isn't a woman to make her want to
[58:49] show her underneath close to some man
[58:53] he said what what what in what business
[58:56] has a christian girl doing this kind of
[58:59] thing like that could you imagine
[59:02] a christian
[59:05] doing that
[59:06] now that's all what you expected right
[59:09] but he went on
[59:11] i say continue
[59:13] now look at here
[59:15] now a man
[59:17] there's not much to him
[59:19] when it comes
[59:21] to his body
[59:23] now this is a direct word for word quote
[59:27] because you're not going to believe it
[59:30] okay
[59:32] but i'm still going to read it
[59:34] because it's balance
[59:37] it's balance
[59:39] it's not what i think it's balance
[59:43] and if he if he went half naked
[59:49] it wouldn't it wouldn't even be a
[59:51] scandal to it
[59:53] now that is word for word
[59:57] now has anybody heard that in a preacher
[59:59] before
[1:00:01] okay but but this is paragraph
[1:00:03] 71 questions and answers
[1:00:06] 64. oh wait
[1:00:09] uh
[1:00:10] if he went half naked it wouldn't it
[1:00:12] wouldn't be no scandal to it
[1:00:14] not holding for a man
[1:00:16] but they
[1:00:18] but you know that what kind of a woman
[1:00:20] would be tempted by a man with his shirt
[1:00:23] off
[1:00:24] oh
[1:00:26] now you know our prophet and i read him
[1:00:28] there was about 30 some quotes where he
[1:00:30] mowed the grass with the shirt off and
[1:00:32] that's when he hit the bees in the fence
[1:00:34] now remember i'll just picture this back
[1:00:36] to facebook but repeatedly people came
[1:00:38] to get prayed for
[1:00:40] and he put his shirt on
[1:00:43] to go pray for him
[1:00:44] and then he went back in the backyard
[1:00:46] took his shirt off and cut the grass now
[1:00:48] see he didn't put it on facebook what he
[1:00:50] did in the backyard
[1:00:54] now it wasn't wrong he took his shirt
[1:00:56] off but if he would have went uh pray
[1:00:58] for the people what's his shirt up
[1:01:04] okay
[1:01:05] so see how would a woman be tempted with
[1:01:07] his shirt off
[1:01:09] or shorts on
[1:01:11] or whatever he had
[1:01:13] question mark
[1:01:15] the baked old burly
[1:01:17] looking thing
[1:01:19] it looks stupid and silly
[1:01:21] and i'm horrible to see these men i'm
[1:01:24] horrid to see these men out there
[1:01:26] well i think he would make a woman vomit
[1:01:30] to look at such a thing
[1:01:35] okay
[1:01:36] if she had but now you take a woman
[1:01:40] and put her in like that situation
[1:01:42] different it's a different
[1:01:45] temple
[1:01:47] different temple
[1:01:49] body
[1:01:50] is a different temple you see
[1:01:53] you understand that's right
[1:01:55] but if you think and then he goes back
[1:01:57] into necklace he said now if you think
[1:01:58] you wear a necklace and all this and and
[1:02:01] he sucks about that and then he goes
[1:02:04] into he tells the story where he was in
[1:02:07] rome you know and you've heard this
[1:02:09] quote where outside of the vatican they
[1:02:11] had to put a a sign up just for
[1:02:13] americans said american women
[1:02:16] please put clothes on
[1:02:18] amen he said what a disgrace for america
[1:02:21] but i don't know if you've heard this
[1:02:22] story before that but he talks about
[1:02:24] they were in a drug store and they were
[1:02:26] eating he said american woman came in
[1:02:28] and she was dressed all you know like an
[1:02:30] american woman she had an old 28 model
[1:02:33] chevy
[1:02:34] and she had a poodle dog sitting on her
[1:02:36] lap
[1:02:38] and she come in the restaurant
[1:02:40] all
[1:02:41] dressed like an american
[1:02:42] going to the vatican
[1:02:44] and they'd have to tell her to put
[1:02:46] clothes on but she had this poodle dog
[1:02:49] for her
[1:02:50] child
[1:02:52] and she came in the restaurant
[1:02:54] and put the poodle dog
[1:02:56] on the table
[1:02:59] and he said
[1:03:00] she had
[1:03:01] the
[1:03:02] the the dime store had stuck to her and
[1:03:05] he said she was 50 years old past
[1:03:08] trying to look like she was 15 and she
[1:03:10] was driving life in a rearview mirror
[1:03:13] so it was really terrible
[1:03:16] and he said now christians don't do that
[1:03:19] a christian don't try to be something
[1:03:22] he's not if you're 50 you're probably
[1:03:25] old and ugly
[1:03:27] compared to a 15 year old
[1:03:29] i mean that's just reality
[1:03:31] don't try you'll look ridiculous you
[1:03:33] know if we try to act like somebody else
[1:03:34] we'll look like a clown
[1:03:36] that's what she was trying to do
[1:03:38] and he said any man that drives his life
[1:03:40] down looking down the road he's going to
[1:03:42] crash and the christians but i want to
[1:03:44] go to
[1:03:48] and he goes he says paul says forgetting
[1:03:50] the things that are behind me he's
[1:03:51] talking about old young age
[1:03:58] but he said now it made me a shame and
[1:04:00] they brought this little old stinky dog
[1:04:03] up in here and put it on the table and
[1:04:05] it would make anyone vomit now they're
[1:04:08] in a restaurant they put the dog on the
[1:04:09] table
[1:04:12] and fooling around with this dog you
[1:04:14] know and
[1:04:15] loving it all up and then eating with
[1:04:18] the same hands and he said they were
[1:04:19] going to eat with the same hands and the
[1:04:21] waiter came over
[1:04:22] and was bubbling off
[1:04:25] and was going to make them get rid of
[1:04:27] the dog out of the restaurant
[1:04:29] and they said waiter
[1:04:33] you gotta
[1:04:35] consider
[1:04:36] the source
[1:04:37] she's an american
[1:04:39] and she's retired
[1:04:43] but she just don't know better
[1:04:46] man he said she's an american
[1:04:50] and let her alone in other words she
[1:04:52] don't have a clue she don't even know
[1:04:54] better than to bring a dog
[1:04:57] and sit it on the table
[1:05:01] man
[1:05:03] you see now
[1:05:07] we have to be really careful you may do
[1:05:09] things in your family holiday
[1:05:12] you know the bible says we're a peculiar
[1:05:14] people and i i have those i'm going to
[1:05:16] read them after but because of who we
[1:05:18] are
[1:05:20] it's not just who we are but because of
[1:05:22] who we represent
[1:05:24] there we go
[1:05:26] the bible says about the seven or eight
[1:05:28] times that you're a peculiar person and
[1:05:31] you're peculiar because you represent
[1:05:34] jehovah
[1:05:36] and your atmosphere and your attitude
[1:05:38] and everything and just it you don't
[1:05:41] even you don't even mentally think of it
[1:05:43] that you're you could it can be as pure
[1:05:46] as lily
[1:05:47] but
[1:05:49] but somebody else will read that and
[1:05:51] it'll just be
[1:05:52] you know
[1:05:54] it it can be perfectly pure
[1:06:03] see you're peculiar
[1:06:05] and your testimony ain't what you say
[1:06:08] it's what you live
[1:06:10] and and and and this is this is geared
[1:06:13] to me as much as anybody but you know
[1:06:15] see remember now the prophet said it
[1:06:17] wouldn't matter if the guy was half
[1:06:18] naked
[1:06:19] but the woman is a different temple
[1:06:22] and so in if you're posting pictures
[1:06:28] just don't go there
[1:06:31] see it's not
[1:06:32] you know
[1:06:34] it's your family
[1:06:35] or your backyard
[1:06:37] the prophet said that the the brahms
[1:06:39] fought in the backyard but the front
[1:06:41] yard they fought with each other
[1:06:44] to defend off you see see a family will
[1:06:47] do things or your clothes your friends
[1:06:49] that you know that you know you you
[1:06:51] you've known for
[1:06:53] 30 or 40 years and you just know that
[1:06:56] you're
[1:06:56] you know
[1:06:58] like sister patty and louie i mean like
[1:07:00] i mean they're just
[1:07:02] they were just always together so i mean
[1:07:04] like how could they offend one another
[1:07:05] because they just
[1:07:06] you know but there's people like that
[1:07:08] but when you go outside your inner
[1:07:10] circle
[1:07:11] they're gonna look at everything that
[1:07:12] just you know what i mean you you can
[1:07:14] say
[1:07:15] the simplest things the simplest things
[1:07:18] but you always got to look at they're
[1:07:20] looking at
[1:07:21] to give god glory
[1:07:23] you might say you know like just i'm
[1:07:26] just i'm stuttering but
[1:07:28] it can be really simple you always want
[1:07:30] to say you know you're like you're
[1:07:32] you're you're you're like they're
[1:07:34] looking at the only bible they're going
[1:07:35] to read is you
[1:07:36] so you always want to have your light
[1:07:38] out there for you
[1:07:40] you know i mean it can be it can be
[1:07:42] swimming pool pictures it can be garden
[1:07:45] pictures it can be it can be my farm but
[1:07:48] you know you always want to have christ
[1:07:49] in the forefront hey we went to church
[1:07:51] today and afterwards we had family time
[1:07:54] show the picture of the church and don't
[1:07:55] show the family type
[1:07:58] you know what i mean
[1:07:59] okay now i want to read a couple quotes
[1:08:02] that are directly to let's go back to uh
[1:08:04] i'll tell you where to go to romans 14
[1:08:06] 17.
[1:08:08] and our prophet said two things
[1:08:10] about this scripture and and it it
[1:08:13] it oh i sent it to another minister
[1:08:15] friend
[1:08:16] because it just woo
[1:08:20] now this is scripture for the kingdom of
[1:08:21] god is not meat nor drink but
[1:08:24] righteousness peace and joy in the holy
[1:08:26] ghost now our prophet
[1:08:28] said a comment to this scripture twice
[1:08:31] would you like to hear it
[1:08:34] now i went
[1:08:35] and it paraphrases the exact comment in
[1:08:38] a paragraph or two paragraphs brother
[1:08:40] henry but i went a paragraph above and a
[1:08:43] paragraph below
[1:08:45] because i'm not trying to pop it out of
[1:08:47] context
[1:08:49] and i want to take my time and i want
[1:08:51] you to understand because we're living
[1:08:52] in a a world where everybody sees my
[1:08:55] laundry
[1:08:57] and see watch this when when when the
[1:08:59] when the king tried to hire the prophet
[1:09:01] to curse the hindu part of israel
[1:09:04] god had no problem with the heiner part
[1:09:06] of israel
[1:09:07] you're saying oh bless god he's a holy
[1:09:10] god
[1:09:10] god blessed them when he's seen it
[1:09:14] thank you lord
[1:09:22] god god sing behind the part right along
[1:09:24] with the prophet and he and he turned
[1:09:26] his cursing into the blessing
[1:09:28] did god have a problem with hiring the
[1:09:29] parts nope
[1:09:32] but the hindu parts see now of course
[1:09:34] that king had an evil agenda and the
[1:09:36] prophet did too because the prophet
[1:09:38] wanted his money and the king wanted to
[1:09:40] destroy israel
[1:09:41] i wanted to show their hundred parts so
[1:09:43] you can always look at the motive
[1:09:46] and so you look at the motive i'm living
[1:09:49] my life but i'm not gonna post it for
[1:09:51] the world that's why i struggle so much
[1:09:52] with this
[1:09:54] service
[1:09:55] being online
[1:09:57] you know i'm not to say that when
[1:09:59] brother jim and sister linda comes back
[1:10:00] and sister kim's here i'm not so sure
[1:10:03] that god won't tell us this
[1:10:07] i'm not the pastor for the world
[1:10:09] and what i preached to you this morning
[1:10:11] could blow somebody
[1:10:15] matt
[1:10:18] you know go back to that same quote i
[1:10:20] said the greatest america
[1:10:22] god the pro that same prophet at the
[1:10:23] beginning of that quote he said god
[1:10:25] would never use mechanical devices to
[1:10:27] spread his word
[1:10:28] he would always choose men
[1:10:30] and that was the hardest thing
[1:10:32] so all the people that are not sitting
[1:10:34] here this morning because they say well
[1:10:35] bless god i want to see some miracles to
[1:10:38] vindicate the ministry
[1:10:41] you're seeing it but you're not even
[1:10:42] here to see it
[1:10:44] because you didn't come back because the
[1:10:45] hardest the very the hardest thing was
[1:10:47] that god healing your cancer he wasn't
[1:10:49] saving your kid he wasn't saving the
[1:10:51] uncle was it bringing you out of jail or
[1:10:52] paying your bills
[1:10:55] it was to get you to come and sit at me
[1:10:57] the second time
[1:11:00] i mean the first time you could say well
[1:11:01] they just didn't know how dumb dale was
[1:11:03] but the second and third time now that's
[1:11:06] a miracle
[1:11:08] if you don't think so just go back and
[1:11:09] listen to old services oh boy
[1:11:14] i'm serious
[1:11:15] my prophet said it
[1:11:18] he said it repeatedly
[1:11:20] he said about him being a spare tire he
[1:11:22] talked about dwight moody he spit and
[1:11:24] sputtered and spit all over the people
[1:11:25] sitting in the front row and all this
[1:11:27] and then the newspaper came to say oh my
[1:11:29] goodness like i can't believe ten
[1:11:30] thousand people show up to hear me so
[1:11:32] they didn't come to hear me spit
[1:11:38] we said oh but now but now we're in
[1:11:39] social media oh bless god we're looking
[1:11:41] for miracles
[1:11:44] god's just in heaven he's smiling
[1:11:46] brother henry
[1:11:48] right over their head and god just
[1:11:50] smiled
[1:11:54] so
[1:11:55] speak to this rock this is an earlier
[1:11:57] quote the next one
[1:11:59] is i'm going to just jump ahead it's a
[1:12:00] token and it's a 64.
[1:12:03] so i know what you were thinking
[1:12:05] and so did the devil
[1:12:07] he's saying well this is you know before
[1:12:09] the prophet had uh progressive
[1:12:11] revelation and so this is a north quote
[1:12:12] so he maybe was off but the other one's
[1:12:14] a 64 token message and he's talking
[1:12:17] about the holy ghost i'll read the first
[1:12:19] one first he said now wow tonight
[1:12:21] there's people standing here misreading
[1:12:23] the brother and he said i'm sitting in a
[1:12:24] little room here a while and maybe i'm
[1:12:26] trying to uh
[1:12:28] come along about a quarter of eight
[1:12:30] something he's talking about preaching i
[1:12:31] just want you to get the whole thing
[1:12:32] here and i'm enjoying the i'm enjoying
[1:12:34] the singing a brother
[1:12:36] uh
[1:12:37] it don't matter who it was i can't even
[1:12:39] say his name and i trust the lord will
[1:12:41] let me
[1:12:42] be
[1:12:43] a mental
[1:12:44] be with him
[1:12:46] when i'm oh be like him
[1:12:48] when i'm 73
[1:12:50] if i live to see it
[1:12:52] now here's the prophet waiting to come
[1:12:54] and minister
[1:12:55] he's enjoying a brother's preaching or
[1:12:57] singing
[1:12:59] and he said i want to be just like him
[1:13:02] fasten your seat belts
[1:13:04] we're about for takeoff
[1:13:08] now i've been with this brother for some
[1:13:11] time now and i know that he's a humble
[1:13:13] christian and when i first saw him i
[1:13:15] wondered how he could wear that hair
[1:13:17] down on his shoulders
[1:13:24] oh that's gonna hurt
[1:13:28] wow
[1:13:30] i never heard that quote before
[1:13:35] and that long beard
[1:13:40] why was that question mark he said you
[1:13:43] have to know this brother and know the
[1:13:45] reason why and if you known him well
[1:13:48] then you would know why god only made
[1:13:51] one of those brothers
[1:13:53] and that's him
[1:13:54] and no one else can take his place
[1:13:56] without the hair to his shoulders and
[1:13:59] his and he it's three dots but it's long
[1:14:01] beard
[1:14:02] amen
[1:14:03] and now no one says
[1:14:05] that's someone
[1:14:07] now someone says
[1:14:09] that's woman's hair to his shoulders
[1:14:13] he said now you go back no surprise he
[1:14:15] said now you go back and read not now
[1:14:17] listen i'm not recommending y'all leave
[1:14:19] your hair to your shoulders
[1:14:21] you want to follow the spirit of your
[1:14:22] pastor
[1:14:24] you know
[1:14:25] i just want to throw that in there
[1:14:27] because that'll be the next thing i'd be
[1:14:28] accused of
[1:14:30] okay
[1:14:31] but uh
[1:14:33] he said now if you go back and read the
[1:14:35] greek
[1:14:38] on that
[1:14:39] they were saying that the man's hair to
[1:14:41] his shoulder was a woman's hair he said
[1:14:42] if you go back and wear the greek on
[1:14:44] that he said feminine hair
[1:14:46] is a way long
[1:14:53] and that hair to the shoulder was
[1:14:56] actually short
[1:15:00] so when men used to put
[1:15:02] a
[1:15:03] so man used to pull
[1:15:05] it around and cut it off and that was
[1:15:09] short hair but a woman let it grow all
[1:15:12] the way down
[1:15:13] way down the back
[1:15:15] now he couldn't have been talking about
[1:15:17] african people because women can't even
[1:15:19] grow hair
[1:15:21] we know that the prophet said long hair
[1:15:23] is not cut here okay now this is speak
[1:15:25] to the rock now i'm into the paragraph
[1:15:27] that comes for this verse
[1:15:30] amen this is the pastor this is the
[1:15:32] prophet's reply
[1:15:34] so that's the reason jesus his picture
[1:15:37] that shows here
[1:15:39] but he didn't have long hair but by no
[1:15:42] means
[1:15:43] but he had short hair but by today's
[1:15:46] standards
[1:15:49] we show it a lot closer
[1:15:57] the kingdom of god is not meat and drink
[1:15:59] but wearing
[1:16:00] or wearing
[1:16:01] of apparel
[1:16:06] the same prophet that preached on
[1:16:07] holiness
[1:16:10] but that's also the same prophet said
[1:16:11] when they came to him said who's going
[1:16:13] to be saved and they said if your name's
[1:16:14] on the lam's book of life
[1:16:17] period
[1:16:19] period
[1:16:20] rahab was saved the woman at the well
[1:16:22] would say
[1:16:23] some of these quotes go into rehab amen
[1:16:26] he said so the kingdom of god is not
[1:16:28] meat and drink or wearing of apparel and
[1:16:30] it's it's long suffering this is
[1:16:33] something that you know you know let me
[1:16:35] just jump in here now i read
[1:16:37] and i don't i have it on my phone but
[1:16:38] there was a man that said he said you
[1:16:39] know how come the world the churches are
[1:16:42] empty
[1:16:43] you know i was here yesterday
[1:16:44] and and it was a unique day for me
[1:16:46] because i didn't study almost any i did
[1:16:48] clean a little bit
[1:16:50] and i just prayed all day
[1:16:52] it was the very shortest prayer i ever
[1:16:53] prayed
[1:16:54] i prayed the lord's prayer and i said
[1:16:56] lord
[1:16:57] show me if it's me
[1:16:59] it's me
[1:17:00] but show me
[1:17:02] i said i know i'm the problem
[1:17:04] but please show me
[1:17:06] because i can't see it
[1:17:08] it's got to be it's a problem and it's
[1:17:10] got to be me
[1:17:11] and i just pray you show me
[1:17:16] if we all prayed that
[1:17:18] wouldn't be a problem
[1:17:20] i was here four or five hours
[1:17:23] it's a problem
[1:17:24] and it's got to be me
[1:17:26] i sure wish it shall
[1:17:32] this this guy said he said how come the
[1:17:34] churches are empty
[1:17:35] and nobody recognizes christ
[1:17:38] or what served god
[1:17:39] it says a very simple answer
[1:17:42] and our prophet said he would hold us
[1:17:44] accountable for it
[1:17:47] because the people don't have jesus
[1:17:50] that's why they can't see him
[1:17:54] now i know i know there's the veil
[1:17:57] i know i know it's veiled from them i
[1:17:59] know the badger skin quotes i love them
[1:18:02] i know they didn't see jesus either
[1:18:05] but they both come together
[1:18:08] if you're so you know the prophet said
[1:18:11] that you could be so full of christ
[1:18:14] that when satan gets up in the morning
[1:18:17] and he has a few hundred you know what
[1:18:19] they said the
[1:18:20] what 200 000 demons that were released
[1:18:22] in the rivers euphrates and
[1:18:24] so satan wakes up you know because he's
[1:18:26] not infinite like god so he has to sleep
[1:18:28] at night and he needs a lot of sleep
[1:18:30] because he's got you know
[1:18:31] demons bothering him too and so when he
[1:18:34] wakes up in the morning then he looks at
[1:18:35] his two hundred thousand demons and he
[1:18:36] said now now you know harry over here in
[1:18:39] spite said i think i'll send you to
[1:18:41] wyoming church
[1:18:42] and i think i'll you know i'll give you
[1:18:44] know one brother matt and brother henry
[1:18:46] and jared and brother jim and you know i
[1:18:47] said spread the demons out now and those
[1:18:50] those those 240
[1:18:52] 000 demons
[1:18:54] that were released on the river
[1:18:56] euphrates just to torture the bride of
[1:18:58] christ they would come up to say just
[1:19:01] picture this this is this is a scene
[1:19:02] before heaven every earth or hell every
[1:19:05] morning
[1:19:06] and they just go now
[1:19:09] no
[1:19:11] no please
[1:19:15] please i was there last week
[1:19:26] you can get to that spot
[1:19:29] it won't be by pride
[1:19:31] or knowing it all
[1:19:33] or quoting the quotes
[1:19:34] or having holiness
[1:19:37] or
[1:19:38] on and on
[1:19:40] it'll be by life
[1:19:43] be by life
[1:19:45] you know but satan this is what normally
[1:19:47] happens that's what could happen
[1:19:50] if more people called and said lord i
[1:19:51] know there's a problem and it's got to
[1:19:53] be me please show me that's what could
[1:19:54] happen but this is what does happen
[1:19:56] tomorrow morning satan comes up and says
[1:19:58] okay you know you you spirit demons you
[1:20:00] know you're 200 000 you know there's not
[1:20:03] that much bride around he said i'll send
[1:20:05] you you know to wyoming and oh no no
[1:20:08] let's use another name oh we'll send you
[1:20:09] to
[1:20:10] uh
[1:20:11] toronto the torch of the bride and they
[1:20:13] go ah praise god
[1:20:16] this is gonna be fun
[1:20:21] i'll go check out their facebook page
[1:20:25] and that'll spread over the sin all over
[1:20:27] the world
[1:20:33] that's what could happen
[1:20:35] so it does happen most of the time
[1:20:38] but it don't have to be like that
[1:20:41] it could be like
[1:20:42] our prophet said that he said a man of
[1:20:44] god can get so close to god
[1:20:47] that the very thought of a demon coming
[1:20:49] on you or a spirit comes to tempt you
[1:20:52] would tremble the spirit
[1:20:54] beyond compare
[1:20:56] because of the torture
[1:20:59] shirt let me repeat that because of
[1:21:01] the torture
[1:21:03] the life of christ
[1:21:06] would put on
[1:21:07] thy demon
[1:21:09] oh
[1:21:11] before i go if god would ever do that
[1:21:14] it'd be the greatest
[1:21:16] pleasure of my life
[1:21:22] he said now the kingdom of god is not
[1:21:23] meat and drink or wearing of apparel
[1:21:25] it's long
[1:21:26] suffering goodness
[1:21:30] meekness
[1:21:31] i understand brother patience
[1:21:35] and the holy ghost
[1:21:37] that's the kingdom of god so i want to
[1:21:39] read this scripture and then we're going
[1:21:41] to start a prayer line and pray for the
[1:21:43] sick and he said now if the holy ghost
[1:21:45] shall come into our presence tonight and
[1:21:48] bless you this is all regarding this
[1:21:49] scripture
[1:21:50] and bless us with his great august
[1:21:52] presence being
[1:21:53] i trust that you if you're unsaved
[1:21:56] you'll be saved here tonight and if
[1:21:58] you're sick you'll be healed and if
[1:21:59] there's any one wayward here that you
[1:22:02] may come back to god tonight and that's
[1:22:04] with god
[1:22:05] in their heart and the first motive
[1:22:07] that's the first motive the secondary
[1:22:10] motive is those fairway people
[1:22:12] might be healed and then the third is
[1:22:15] for the glory of god that the saints
[1:22:17] might be refreshed and watching and
[1:22:19] looking on
[1:22:20] he said the gospel is not watch this now
[1:22:23] this is the same there's paragraph five
[1:22:26] speaking he said now the gospel is not
[1:22:27] altogether
[1:22:30] word
[1:22:33] this is the word of god and all things
[1:22:35] must be based upon this word
[1:22:38] if it isn't it isn't true this is but
[1:22:41] jesus said go into all the world now
[1:22:43] this whoa
[1:22:46] we're ready for another takeoff you
[1:22:47] better fasten up
[1:22:49] we're no we're up there but we're
[1:22:51] hitting turbulence
[1:22:52] he said now jesus said that's the
[1:22:54] prophet but jesus said
[1:22:58] go into all the world and preach the
[1:22:59] gospel to every creature now he didn't
[1:23:02] say
[1:23:04] this is what this believe me we're
[1:23:06] hitting an air pocket
[1:23:08] he didn't say teach the word
[1:23:10] i'm like
[1:23:12] i read the quote i'm like
[1:23:14] huh
[1:23:19] i'm like
[1:23:22] huh
[1:23:25] he didn't say teach your word he said
[1:23:27] preach the gospel
[1:23:29] and so the gospel consists of more than
[1:23:32] teaching the word
[1:23:34] oh
[1:23:36] for paul confirmed that said that
[1:23:39] the gospel came to us not by word only
[1:23:43] but by the but through the power and
[1:23:46] demonstration of the holy ghost which
[1:23:48] was love meekness longsuffering
[1:23:52] patience gentleness
[1:23:57] of the life of christ
[1:23:59] that the holy spirit would come and
[1:24:01] demonstrate to demonstrate the gospel
[1:24:04] bringing the word into living
[1:24:08] reality
[1:24:10] i think that that just is
[1:24:13] that's just amazing
[1:24:16] see if you just receive the word by no
[1:24:19] watch it this is this is the issue
[1:24:23] this is just if you just receive the
[1:24:25] message
[1:24:26] it says the word by knowing the word
[1:24:29] that doesn't do you
[1:24:31] any
[1:24:33] good
[1:24:34] g.o.o.d
[1:24:37] well bless god i went hunting with the
[1:24:40] prophet and i fished with the prophet
[1:24:42] and i went to brown tabernacle and i
[1:24:44] seen his moose head and i went to the
[1:24:46] tomb and i seen the stone and i felt the
[1:24:48] spirit of the cloud coming out of the
[1:24:49] stone and
[1:24:50] and and i went to
[1:24:56] the lat knob continues the ladder kills
[1:24:59] but the spirit gives life and when you
[1:25:01] must be born again and when the spirit
[1:25:03] of god quickens the word to you in other
[1:25:06] words
[1:25:07] like a grain of corn it's lying in my
[1:25:10] hand and it's just a grain of corn and
[1:25:12] it never be nothing else but you bury it
[1:25:18] and it contaminates and molds
[1:25:22] and it becomes meek and then it brings
[1:25:24] another grain of corn
[1:25:27] up
[1:25:29] wow
[1:25:34] see you'll never receive the token
[1:25:37] by memorizing the message
[1:25:40] no no we and we believe the message i'm
[1:25:42] not taking it away but it's a life
[1:25:46] live me your testimony don't tell me
[1:25:48] your testimony leave me your testimony
[1:25:51] show me your testimony when everything's
[1:25:54] going wrong i'll watch from a distance
[1:25:56] in case there's a storm
[1:26:00] that's what every daughter of god needs
[1:26:02] to do before they marry a man
[1:26:03] watch watch the boy when you're thinking
[1:26:05] of a man watch him when he talks to his
[1:26:07] mom
[1:26:09] watch him when he talks to his grandma
[1:26:11] watch him how many times he goes to the
[1:26:13] hospital to visit the sick and the ugly
[1:26:16] with the diaper
[1:26:18] and then watch when
[1:26:20] somebody crosses his doctrine which is
[1:26:23] true doctrine
[1:26:25] and how he
[1:26:26] dropped the mess
[1:26:28] well watch that too because he'll drop
[1:26:30] the mitts on you
[1:26:32] after the wedding
[1:26:34] oh even though he's right he'll still
[1:26:36] huh
[1:26:44] you know what i use it regular prophet
[1:26:46] talks about the man he was trying to see
[1:26:47] who had the holy ghost and the guy that
[1:26:48] had the right doctrine never had the
[1:26:50] holy ghost the guy that had the wrong
[1:26:52] doctrine but the right spirit said he's
[1:26:54] got it
[1:26:56] yeah
[1:26:57] we need we need more of them
[1:27:01] not oh bless god he showed me 29 years
[1:27:04] ago and if you think i'm changing bless
[1:27:06] god he showed me
[1:27:10] dad's in heaven he just smiles
[1:27:17] man here's the token
[1:27:18] this is a 640308
[1:27:21] message and he said so today he said
[1:27:23] just remember
[1:27:25] i'm sorry this is unique but i i just
[1:27:27] you know i was going to mention on
[1:27:28] joshua and i just i just put those bible
[1:27:30] verses underneath there because
[1:27:32] because uh you know this is this is
[1:27:34] another comment exactly to this verse
[1:27:37] and i'm starting
[1:27:39] two paragraphs above it and i'm going to
[1:27:40] read two below
[1:27:43] he said so it is today just remember
[1:27:44] when god the wrath destroyed a destroyer
[1:27:48] that came and the big system fell the
[1:27:50] token kept the house safe he's talking
[1:27:53] about rahab's house
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:56] but
[1:27:57] cause because
[1:27:59] but safe but not because she was good
[1:28:02] woman
[1:28:04] no
[1:28:07] because she had faith
[1:28:10] and applied the token now what if she
[1:28:12] had said yeah them are them was fine men
[1:28:15] and i certainly enjoyed the message that
[1:28:18] they gave but honestly it sounded now
[1:28:21] watches
[1:28:22] it sounded quite silly
[1:28:24] to have a string hanging out of my
[1:28:26] window
[1:28:27] i'll just put it on the inside
[1:28:30] and it would have foul meaning her house
[1:28:34] see obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:28:40] everything god does looks silly
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:44] like
[1:28:45] preaching is ridiculous
[1:28:48] through the foolishness of preaching
[1:28:50] you thought it had to be a good preacher
[1:28:51] it's all foolishness
[1:28:53] god chose to save men
[1:28:57] he was god so he got to pay
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:04] i'll just pull it in and that would have
[1:29:06] fell he said
[1:29:08] but god honored the token because it was
[1:29:10] life now joshua was the type of jesus
[1:29:12] because joshua means a jehovah's savior
[1:29:15] and he was the type of of christ the
[1:29:17] true token sign the messenger that has
[1:29:19] preached and you know and you can go
[1:29:21] back and
[1:29:22] we may do a message on that joshua
[1:29:24] stayed true with the token sign and all
[1:29:26] that was under it was saved in egypt and
[1:29:28] all that was under it was saved in
[1:29:30] jericho and the lamb's blood is the type
[1:29:32] today of the token the holy ghost is
[1:29:34] token today under all saved out from
[1:29:37] underneath covenant and he uses uh
[1:29:40] hebrews 13 10 which is the same
[1:29:42] yesterday forever and hebrews 13 20.
[1:29:45] they called everlasting covenant the old
[1:29:47] covenant the one thing
[1:29:51] and he called the everlasting covenant
[1:29:53] and the old covenant is one thing this
[1:29:55] is a new new
[1:29:57] and this is an everlasting covenant
[1:30:00] he said now here we go to the
[1:30:03] direct quote the prophet used for the
[1:30:05] scripture now god's blood
[1:30:08] god's blood-bound promises make us free
[1:30:12] from sin and shame different from the
[1:30:15] rest
[1:30:16] of the world
[1:30:20] see
[1:30:21] you have freedom
[1:30:23] but you won't show everything to the
[1:30:25] world
[1:30:26] watch this
[1:30:27] jesus never had
[1:30:30] jesus preached in parables and the pride
[1:30:32] the disciples came to him privately
[1:30:36] and he and i preached a message on that
[1:30:37] and she said why do you preach in
[1:30:39] parables it's not given
[1:30:41] to them
[1:30:45] hallelujah
[1:30:46] oh just think god chose to give it to
[1:30:49] you
[1:30:49] that's amazing for the rest of the world
[1:30:52] and
[1:30:52] now watch this i better start over is it
[1:30:55] already if i start over again just one
[1:30:56] sentence god blood bound promises make
[1:30:59] us free from sin and shame
[1:31:01] and different from the rest of the world
[1:31:04] period
[1:31:05] you don't have to dress
[1:31:07] different
[1:31:09] period
[1:31:10] i read them
[1:31:13] i went into lapping fit
[1:31:19] anyone
[1:31:20] can dress different
[1:31:24] if you think you dress holy
[1:31:26] look at the muslims
[1:31:28] they cover their head
[1:31:29] you'd have pickles
[1:31:36] this now this a word for word you don't
[1:31:38] have to dress different
[1:31:40] anybody can dress different
[1:31:43] you have to be on the inside
[1:31:47] different
[1:31:49] oh
[1:31:51] okay
[1:31:52] the life is on the inside not in
[1:31:55] dressing
[1:31:56] and wearing three dots the kingdom of
[1:31:59] god is not meat nor drink or wearing of
[1:32:02] apparel but it is long-suffering
[1:32:05] goodness
[1:32:06] gentleness
[1:32:08] patience
[1:32:11] and the holy ghost
[1:32:13] now you know and i preached it
[1:32:16] i will believe in holiness
[1:32:18] until the day i die
[1:32:21] deuteronomy 22 8
[1:32:23] without holiness no man will see god man
[1:32:26] not supposed to wear women's apparel and
[1:32:27] women not wear man's apparel
[1:32:30] but hell will be full of people
[1:32:33] and holiness clothes
[1:32:35] it'll be right full of it
[1:32:37] in holiness clothes
[1:32:39] it'll be also great full of people
[1:32:42] that don't wear a wedding bed
[1:32:44] be grateful by the way it just comes to
[1:32:46] me fresh and the quote where the prophet
[1:32:48] talked about nazarene wouldn't baptize
[1:32:50] people with the wedding ban
[1:32:52] and our prophet is amazing he said you
[1:32:55] know wedding bands were in the bible
[1:32:58] i didn't know that
[1:33:00] he said there were a different type of
[1:33:01] bag
[1:33:02] he said in the bible and like it's back
[1:33:04] in the other quote i won't go back to it
[1:33:06] he said in the bible a wedding band was
[1:33:08] a necklace with nine jewels on it and
[1:33:11] your husband give it to your wife to
[1:33:13] show wed
[1:33:18] so see here's a whole holiness movement
[1:33:22] taking a scripture out of context when
[1:33:24] in the same bible
[1:33:27] they wore a gold necklace that was a
[1:33:29] wedding man
[1:33:33] see that's what my desire
[1:33:35] is to be
[1:33:36] balanced
[1:33:38] don't just take this and just jump off
[1:33:40] the cliff
[1:33:41] let's you know what i mean
[1:33:43] like at least look at them all like you
[1:33:45] know what are we gonna do with these
[1:33:46] ones we'll cover them up
[1:33:48] i don't like the months
[1:33:51] amen
[1:33:53] for life is on the inside not it's uh
[1:33:56] okay and now promise the promise makes
[1:33:59] you free from sin it shows that god
[1:34:01] don't recognize god don't recognize
[1:34:05] your sin now that should make like
[1:34:07] you're
[1:34:08] you're falling asleep or something like
[1:34:10] that shouldn't make you just go
[1:34:15] are you kidding
[1:34:17] you're born it's in shape and iniquity
[1:34:18] and god don't even recognize it
[1:34:21] and the old accused of the nervous say
[1:34:22] oh you see what brother dale did i got a
[1:34:24] full record of the scheme of that god
[1:34:26] says
[1:34:27] i don't even know what you're talking
[1:34:28] about
[1:34:29] show me proof well he said i got it on
[1:34:31] this thing he said i can't vindicate
[1:34:33] that paper it's wrote on toilet paper
[1:34:38] you know it was like when we were doing
[1:34:39] my dad's will you know and we were
[1:34:41] telling the lord you know see my dad
[1:34:43] always meant for it to be this way they
[1:34:44] say well do you got that rope and them
[1:34:46] sign on it document it and he said well
[1:34:48] no but he always said that he wanted you
[1:34:50] know
[1:34:52] what you got proof do you want a
[1:34:53] document i got proof i got proof you
[1:34:55] want to see my proof god doesn't
[1:34:57] recognize your sin wow

[1:35:06] man you're quiet you should be just whoa
[1:35:08] doing laps whoo
[1:35:12] you're born in sin shaped an iniquity
[1:35:14] and the devil's got proof that he's got
[1:35:16] it and god said oh not my bride

[1:35:26] all this these sins what are you talking
[1:35:28] about
[1:35:30] what are you talking about i just kept
[1:35:31] record from when they were in heaven i
[1:35:32] didn't keep record once they came to
[1:35:34] heart i was keeping the record from
[1:35:36] heaven and it's all clear
[1:35:39] oh and you kept the record from hearts
[1:35:41] yeah but we got this buffer it's called
[1:35:43] the blood
[1:35:45] wow
[1:35:47] god the cross
[1:35:51] wow
[1:35:52] oh that just
[1:35:58] oh man
[1:36:00] the promises make you free from sin now
[1:36:02] this by the way this is our prophet
[1:36:04] brother brown
[1:36:05] the promises make you free from sin and
[1:36:07] shows that god don't even recognize your
[1:36:09] sin david said blessed is a man who god
[1:36:12] will not impute sin to and god will
[1:36:14] never impute sin over the token
[1:36:18] because the token paid the sign that god
[1:36:21] had already the token was the blood had
[1:36:23] already received the sign
[1:36:26] and bought it and purchased the price
[1:36:28] and redeemed you he already owned you he
[1:36:30] was just buying you back what was
[1:36:32] already his property redeemed you back
[1:36:35] to worship him and show forth the power
[1:36:37] of his promises
[1:36:39] whoa
[1:36:42] and the new testament means a new
[1:36:43] covenant what you see a new testament
[1:36:46] we're living under paul's message not
[1:36:48] moses praise god i don't have to wash my
[1:36:50] hands before i eat today like vicky says
[1:36:53] bless god next time when vicky says wash
[1:36:54] your hands before you eat you just say
[1:36:56] we're living under paul's testament
[1:36:58] we're living under grace
[1:37:00] i'm ready to go
[1:37:01] praise the lord
[1:37:03] amen we're living under the new
[1:37:05] testament which means a new covenant and
[1:37:07] the blood the blood means life the new
[1:37:10] testament is the holy ghost temple
[1:37:13] testament the holy ghost is giving a
[1:37:15] testimony what that jesus christ is
[1:37:17] raised from the dead and showed that
[1:37:19] jesus met every requirement
[1:37:22] every requirement for what i do in my
[1:37:24] backyard
[1:37:26] every requirement
[1:37:30] for us
[1:37:31] and is alive today the token provides
[1:37:34] that he is alive and identified himself
[1:37:37] with us according to his promises and
[1:37:39] now how can a man read the bible and see
[1:37:42] his promises and not see christ return
[1:37:44] in this last day
[1:37:45] you know the prophet said some praise
[1:37:47] god when i was studying this week i i
[1:37:49] just i just
[1:37:51] i just was happy
[1:37:53] i was just saying you know he said how
[1:37:54] come all the ghost-filled christians
[1:37:57] praise god that believe the message and
[1:38:00] are just so entoned with they got it all
[1:38:02] memorized never want to think of the
[1:38:04] rapture happening
[1:38:09] our prophet said that this week i just
[1:38:11] bought had another big one
[1:38:13] he said you know when people say that
[1:38:15] the the rapture could take place in june
[1:38:17] they say oh i just want to push a way
[1:38:18] off he said you got to be kidding me
[1:38:21] they said this is what a prophet said he
[1:38:23] said the rapture is something that the
[1:38:25] bible says that neither mind nor thought
[1:38:28] or imagination or dream could even
[1:38:30] comprehend
[1:38:32] what god has in store for you but we
[1:38:34] don't want to go there yet
[1:38:37] oh
[1:38:40] and you had the holy ghost
[1:38:46] okay
[1:38:50] you got god but you don't want to go to
[1:38:52] god
[1:38:55] might because you have a different god
[1:39:00] wow
[1:39:01] that was free
[1:39:03] nothing against
[1:39:07] he said
[1:39:10] return in the last days in the form of
[1:39:12] the holy ghost and identify himself
[1:39:13] alive in the token and that's a sign of
[1:39:15] the price faith now he said
[1:39:17] he said don't rely
[1:39:20] on works
[1:39:21] he said don't rely on sensations now i
[1:39:23] like feelings
[1:39:25] there's no doubt about it
[1:39:27] but he said i felt chills to go down my
[1:39:29] back and i smelt something and i had
[1:39:31] blood come out of my hands and i had
[1:39:33] some oil drip off my fingers and i won
[1:39:36] my bachelor's degree in divinity and i
[1:39:39] danced in the spirit and i shouted and i
[1:39:41] spoke in tongues and he said those
[1:39:43] things might all be good
[1:39:45] but they have nothing to do and i have
[1:39:47] nothing to do against them
[1:39:48] but that's not got one thing to do with
[1:39:50] it
[1:39:51] what i'm talking about he said i'm
[1:39:53] talking about identifying the token that
[1:39:56] jesus christ has raised in us now and
[1:39:58] identified himself and vindicated the
[1:40:00] promised word
[1:40:02] for this day
[1:40:05] but we got to go back to our scriptures
[1:40:07] now
[1:40:10] and see
[1:40:11] that that don't allow us
[1:40:15] to show the world
[1:40:17] what god's done for us
[1:40:20] now that'll be the hardest thing you
[1:40:21] maybe ever did but that's what the bible
[1:40:23] says
[1:40:26] see god's done things for you
[1:40:29] you can't show the world
[1:40:31] because they won't get it
[1:40:33] they won't understand it
[1:40:35] the bible says that
[1:40:36] and so if it's gonna stumble your
[1:40:38] brother because we're gonna have a fire
[1:40:40] out here on a sunday and cook some good
[1:40:42] old-fashioned beef
[1:40:45] you know
[1:40:47] you tell them ahead of time don't come
[1:40:48] to church
[1:40:50] or you don't have the fire
[1:40:52] that that's
[1:40:53] forgive me but you see what i'm saying
[1:40:56] be careful what you post on facebook
[1:41:00] be careful what you
[1:41:01] use if you're going to use it and now
[1:41:04] either make it really neutral
[1:41:08] or put jesus first
[1:41:12] don't show what you do in your backyard
[1:41:14] and it's not sin i'm not putting you in
[1:41:16] a guilt trip
[1:41:19] it's not sin what you did with your kids
[1:41:21] it's not sin having a swimming pool the
[1:41:23] prophet went swimming with his kids
[1:41:27] and they didn't swim with overhauls on
[1:41:30] but they didn't put it on facebook
[1:41:33] the prophet cut his grasp repeatedly
[1:41:36] with his shirt off
[1:41:38] but he didn't come to church with his
[1:41:40] shirt off
[1:41:46] amen
[1:41:48] so you know if you're going to the
[1:41:50] algonquin park i don't care what you do
[1:41:52] in algonquin park
[1:41:55] if you're you know me
[1:41:56] but we're living in a world
[1:41:59] that everybody goes
[1:42:07] and we're stumbling people
[1:42:09] and you say well bless god that he might
[1:42:11] yes it is your problem
[1:42:13] it is your problem
[1:42:14] because the bible said it was your
[1:42:16] problem
[1:42:17] because god died for those people
[1:42:19] and you're offending them
[1:42:23] you're offending them
[1:42:25] you know i i try you know i told my kids
[1:42:28] this i said you know people will come up
[1:42:30] you know you're gonna have friends on
[1:42:31] you we're family and friends and people
[1:42:33] that
[1:42:34] you know
[1:42:36] neighbors
[1:42:37] and if they put something inappropriate
[1:42:39] on
[1:42:40] nobody knows you've seen that
[1:42:43] unless you like it
[1:42:44] or comment
[1:42:46] so if your neighbors that are just
[1:42:48] neighbors put on bikini swimsuits
[1:42:52] and they shouldn't have done that but
[1:42:53] they're they're your neighbors and
[1:42:56] you're on their facebook because
[1:42:59] whatever
[1:43:00] don't like it and don't comment it
[1:43:04] because when you like or comment it then
[1:43:06] it comes up on your page and i see it
[1:43:10] and i go uh-oh
[1:43:12] problem here
[1:43:14] you see
