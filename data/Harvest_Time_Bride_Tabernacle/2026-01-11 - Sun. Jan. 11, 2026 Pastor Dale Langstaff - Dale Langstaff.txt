And then we'll give our devotional book to Matt and Abigail and their family. Amen. Lan was playing this before uh the service for some of that were here and some of the kids were getting bouncy in their feet and that that's a good sign.

Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Blessing Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This old house that I'm living in is needing [Music] repairs. The windows and the shutters are letting in the cold, cold air. I say to myself, I'm going to fix some when I can get the time. But all I'm getting lately is leaving on your mind. Lately all my God is leaving on my mind. That's all I'm thinking about. Oh my leave my behind. Leave it all behind. I guess I should be looking for a better place to live. But I can't seem to get excited about this world and what it has to be. [Music] I couldn't care less if I could buy it all with good world to me with living on my mind. [Applause] I is on my mind. It seems that's all I'm thinking about. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] My truth. [Music] [Music] Amen. Let's sing that chorus one more time. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Blessed be your name, Lord God. It's all we can think about. Hallelujah. Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh, very soon we'll leave these troubles all behind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Amen. God bless you. We'll read our scripture. just remember brother Leu and and sister Margaret. I'm sure they're on their way, but just uh coming coming from London and uh how many enjoyed our summer weather and on Thursday? I did. I'll put my hand up. I have that ordered for my birthday on the 26th. 60° is perfect. Amen. Just uh Amen. It's really good to have Matt. There we go. They got two feet of snow and had one week got freezing rain and and a whole bunch of other stuff mixed in there. Amen. Let's turn to Romans. Amen. Romans 14 14 and 15. [Music] I love the presence of the Holy Spirit here. And man, if God allows me, I'm going to share a supernatural testimony that Sister Margaret told me when we were at their house. And man, God is very, very good. Amen. &gt;&gt; For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. You know, the Bible says that where your heart is, that's where your treasure are. Lately, all I can think about is leaving &gt;&gt; cuz that's where my heart is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit of God are the sons of God. In verse 15, for ye have not received the spirit of bondage to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, father. And let's just one more scripture in Judges uh 6:12. Judges 6:12 and just pray for me and our service that God will be speak to us. Amen. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him. This is Gideon. And said unto him, Lord, the Lord said, the Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. Lord God, I pray that you'll add the blessing to your word and may you speak life and encouragement to your people today. We pray and be pleased with everything that's said and done. In your name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. For as many are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God. If you're led by God, then God's telling you that you're one of his. You're part of his family. And we have not received the spirit of fear. And we've been preaching on fear and and just we're not we're going to move on because I I I don't like repeats, but you know, we can the Bible says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; And it is impossible to have faith and fear at the same time. &gt;&gt; That's right. That that's that is in every way impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. Cuz in Hebrews 11:1 it says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Now there's no way in the world that you're packing fear and faith at the same time. God bless you, Sister Margaret and Brother Lu. Amen. We just this this is not a possibility. And so we see in our lives and and this is not a this is for me. I I'll say for me but many of the times we see that most of the times we are like Gideon. Now he was a great man of Babyler. &gt;&gt; So don't knock that. &gt;&gt; But we should be like Abraham or David. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you the difference. We should be like Abraham or David or the three Hebrew children or re or or Rebecca. And there's a big difference. &gt;&gt; You see, I seen an article and studying this week and and it said something like this and and it catch you on off guard maybe. It said, "Believing in Jesus but not obeying him is exactly what Satan did." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "If you're led by me, you're a son of God. And if you have trouble with that, &gt;&gt; well, Satan had trouble with that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believing in Jesus, but not obeying what he said. And we see here in the story of of Gideon, we want to jump into this cuz we got to go like a rocket this morning cuz we have communion. But but just to to lay a little bit of a foundation here, we know that faith is the substance of things hoped for. Amen. And without faith, it is impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe that he is. And he's a rewarder. Watch this. And he is a re, this is Bible, that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &gt;&gt; seek him. that diligently do their daily devotions, that diligently think, I can't think of nothing but going in a rapture, that diligently serve him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have to, you know, many Christians are backed in a corner and and and afraid of they're afraid to trust God and and and they put God in a box. They say, "Well, my God can't do that, but my God can do things that I can't even imagine about doing." And we don't have to wait till we get to the millennium to be happy. If you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit today and you've received and you've been born again, you don't have to, you know, John 1, first John, it says, "Beloved, you are now the sons of God, and it does not yet appear." It don't appear cuz you can still see my flesh, what we shall be, but you shall know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him. That's in our character and in our whole daring. For we shall see him as he is in Ephesians 2 6. And he has raised us up together to sit with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That don't mean when we get to heaven. That means right now. &gt;&gt; That means right when you become born again. See, you are a creator. And if you're happy this morning, that was a decision you made. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you're sad, that's a decision you made. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because you can decide to be like regardless. Look at how Job said, you know, though the skin worms eat this flesh, I will see God, you know, no matter what comes against me, I'm going to build a thing that it's good. God is good. &gt;&gt; The footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. And so we see here if we if we move on here quickly in Judges 6 and and I'm not going to read all these scriptures but I might give you some highlights of these scriptures that the Israelites had been had been pun the Israelites disobeyed God and God turned them over for correction to the Menites for seven years and the Israelites hid in dens and caves and this is all in in Judges 61-6. and and and and the Minionites literally took over. They were like grasshoppers. They took over their wealth and their food. And here's God's people starving to death. You know, God didn't save you to make you starve to death. God didn't save you to give you bankruptcy. &gt;&gt; God didn't save you to to give you hard times. &gt;&gt; I didn't say he saved you to make you a trillionaire either. But God said he will supply your needs according to his riches and glory. And God gave us his Bible is it's a very good guideline. There's things if you spend more than you make, you're going to have trouble. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here the Israelites were under this persecution for seven years. You know, I want to type that to the seven church ages. We almost hit it by our tree. But, you know, we've been in seven church ages and the Christians that were sold out to God were not beat down. &gt;&gt; You know, we're not I'm not going to barely get to heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to heaven rejoicing and dancing and doing cartwheels and headstands. I'm not going to bar I'm not going in in a wheelchair. &gt;&gt; No, I won't need an escort by somebody pushing me in or dragging me in. &gt;&gt; No, it did not happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's so different than you can comprehend. &gt;&gt; I just I just right now I I'm going to share that testimony. Sister Margaret and forgive me if I I miss it, but we went to their house, had a beautiful time, and a sister in Uganda had told her an experience that had happened to her. And literally it just it just has as you know I've heard things like that before but it's just affected me the testimony. I pray to God it'll affect you. But she was there and I believe she died anyway. I believe she got bit by a snake but for whatever reason she died and she she left her body. She was going to heaven to believe her and and she she'd leave her body and she could see the doctors working on her trying to save her life and and she's going to glory and her husband and her daughter were back crying. She had a family, young kids, but her older daughter and her husband were back here praying for God to save her. And and as she as she left her body, all the people that knew all the saints that had won before came out to greet her and to meet her and said, "Oh, God bless you, sister. Welcome home." And you it's so good to see you. And and just on and on and on. You You can't comprehend it. There was no darkness that she went through. There was no clouds. She was just She was out of this life. It's like a blink, a twinkling of an eye. I'm here today and I'm gone tomorrow. You don't have to cry for me when I'm gone. I'll be in the presence of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; And here she was in the presence of the saints and she said, "Oh, this is so on. This is beyond what my human body can comprehend." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here her husband was begging God to send her back. And she looked back at her body and it looked so decrepit and so sinful and so dirty, just like mud. And she said, "Oh, God, please. I don't have to go back in that temple." Most of us are fighting to stay in this temple that's covered with sin, shaped in iniquity, telling lies to survive. And the believers or Jesus said to her, he said, "Sister, you have a young family on ours and your husband, your daughter needs you there for a short time." You see, God didn't make this journey like to be fearful. &gt;&gt; It's a lie of Satan that places fear in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Paul said to live is gain, but to die is is Christ. Or however, you know, he always said it in the Bible. Amen. The greatest journey you're going to ever take is when you close your eyes on this side. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And everybody's waiting for you on that side. I tell you what, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; It's not going to matter what you own here. &gt;&gt; You're not going to think, "Wow, I wish I could have brought that old house with me." Oh, &gt;&gt; this old house is all falling down around me. &gt;&gt; I took the insurance off my house burned down. I never build a house like that again. I just build a little tent. I'd build two rooms. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A bedroom and a kitchen and party room &gt;&gt; and heat the floor. That's what I would build. &gt;&gt; I'm not staying here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to stay in a big house. I'd be alone. You know, my wife this week, she I I was actually sitting at the table studying and she told me, she said, "Send the neighbors a message. Tell them to come over for supper." And I knew that I had misheard her because I, you know, I lived with my wife for many years, 40 years, and I knew that, like, I believe in the body change, but I didn't think it'd happen right in front of me. And so I ignored that for about two hours and I was focused in on my studies and my message sitting right at the table. And she said, "Did you message the neighbors?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That not only did they come over, but they didn't go home till go until 11. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what our that's that's our life ain't to live here in a big house alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to live here alone. And I want to go into heaven where I could just in a thought be with all the believers in the world. I think of believers. Believers this week, yesterday asked me to come to the Philippines for February for dedication services and around the world. You don't think when you get to heaven, you just said a moment you'll be there. You'll be in their presence. You &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so we see here in Gideon and Israel was beat down and they were greatly improvish in verse six. greatly improvished by the the Amorites. [Music] And the children of Israel cried out to God in repentance for their sin. And God actually and I skipped this verses, but God actually sent him a prophet. And here to to bring them back on their journey. And here in verse 10, uh God told Canaan or Gideon, sorry. He said, "I am the Lord thy God and fear not all these other gods." And here here Gideon was uh thrashing his wheat and you know because they were overrun and they had nothing to eat here. Here he's hiding in caves and underneath a tree and he's he was in the wine press trying to get some wheat so they could eat to hide it from the Menites. In verse 11, and the angel of the Lord came down and sat there. And I want to and I want to show you in this message why that we should become an Abraham or a David as opposed to a Gideon. Because the angel of the Lord came right face to face with Gideon and appeared unto him, the Bible says, and he said, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor." Do you know God is telling you that this morning? &gt;&gt; And many of you sitting here are doubting. &gt;&gt; He said, "Those that are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; That it does not appear what he's prepared for us. See, it it is so supernatural, God's simple word, that we say, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's exactly what Gideon did. Gideon went to the Lord and he said, but Gide the Gideon is it's so hilarious how spirits don't die. Gideon went to the angel of the Lord and he said, I'm poor. And he said, "I'm the least of my family." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God, you never picked me. I'm the last in line. Failed grade one. It went to speech therapy in grade two. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What could I do, God? &gt;&gt; That's what Gideon thought. &gt;&gt; And here the Lord said, I'm sending you. And and Gideon, he was struggling to believe it. He said, "But where's the God here? Let's just look at this." In 13, Gideon said unto the Lord, he said, 'Lord, if you be with us, then why has this all befallen us? And and Lord, and where is all his miracles which our fathers told us of? And did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? And the Lord hath forsaken us and deliver us. You know, I want I want to correct Gideon here. God had not forsaken them. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; remember what I said at the beginning. Satan believes in Jesus, &gt;&gt; but he don't obey him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord looked and he said, "Go in this, thou mighty man. Thou shalt save Israel from the hands of the Minionites." And then he went right in. said the next verse, he says, "Well, I I can do that, God." You know, God's got a lot of patience. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you think God had figured out that he could do it before he asked him? God wasn't asking for his strength. God was anointing him with his spirit and giving him supernatural ability to do what God had called them to do. &gt;&gt; And so this is the difference between some of the believers in the Bible and Gideon. &gt;&gt; And you know, I hope I'm not Gideon. In verse 17 it said, "And he said unto him, now if I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest to me." Now I want to I want to just show down though. This is this is this is everything that's wrote in the Bible is wrote for a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible just said a few verses previous that the angel came before his face and spoke with him. &gt;&gt; Gideon didn't recognize the angel. &gt;&gt; He would have never asked for a sign if he had recognized the angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that brother Bram said that your pastor is an angel given to you &gt;&gt; to show you the truth of God. &gt;&gt; But we're living in a world that most people won't have a pastor. &gt;&gt; Because they didn't see the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Gideon went and he he asked the angel to wait. And Gideon went and and and I have to go fast because I got some more hay on my fork. But Gideon went and he baked a meal. And the angel said he would wait. And this verse 20 is the first time that the here he asked God. He said, "Show me sign." Now he'd already showed him face to face. Do you know that? Do you know that you're walking in the presence of angels daily &gt;&gt; that protect you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When that car almost hit you, that was an angel. &gt;&gt; And you said, "Whoa, that was a close one." No, that wasn't a close one. That was an angel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was an angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I was going through when I thought we were we got pretty much snowed out or iced out of our New Year's uh day Sunday, but I was going through and me and Lyn were putting down testimonies of things that had happened in our life. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; those are angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And here Gideon, he baked a a a dinner and he put it on the stone. And the angel of the Lord in 21 took his staff and laid it on the stone and fire came out of the stone and consumed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's miracle number two. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and Gideon. Verse 22. And then Gideon perceived that we are funny people. I'm not making fun of Gideon. I I'm making fun of myself. &gt;&gt; And Gideon then perceived that it he was an angel of the Lord. Remember I said you didn't see it as an angel? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It took two times before Gideon perceived. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many testimonies will it take before you perceive that God is in your midst? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He perceived that it was an angel of the Lord. And Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I have seen an angel of the Lord." Watch this. 22. You got that up. Face to face. I want to tell you something this morning. If you've been born again and you have the new birth, the Holy Ghost in your life, you not only have seen an angel face to face, you are actually packing an angel &gt;&gt; in your being &gt;&gt; called Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; But it don't stop there. So the angel said, you know, the angel of the Lord came and said, "Now, you're not going to die, so do not fear." Do you notice, you know, we said last week that do not fear not is 365 times in the Bible because God knew that you would have to hear it every single day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, do you know that? You know that in Revelations he said, "I'm Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end." &gt;&gt; There's no other but us. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Think of all the amazing names that God is and you're fearing every day. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And here God told Gideon to go out and tear down the altars to Baal. And you know, and we're just going to skip over that, but he did do that. But you know the Bible says that he took 10 men with him and he went at night because he was &gt;&gt; he was still afraid. &gt;&gt; After he had seen God consume his meal, seen him face to face. Perceived he'd seen him face to face. &gt;&gt; Sound familiar? &gt;&gt; You were wondering how you were going to get through next month. &gt;&gt; Gideon And then if we jump to verse 3, 36 here. And Gideon said unto the Lord, he said, "If you will save Israel as thou has said, what you know what the devil said? If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; call these stones to become bread." &gt;&gt; Gideon was a mighty man of valor by God's testimony, but he could not believe it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you are sons and daughters of God. Thus saith the word of God &gt;&gt; and you're struggling &gt;&gt; to grasp that. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; God said it. I believe it. That settles it for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, 'If. The devil said, 'If, Jesus, you're God. Just jump off these buildings and he'll raise you up. If If you know in your journey being a Christian, you have to get past the gift. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "I am." &gt;&gt; Period. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, possess, you know, you know what the Bible says as the testimony, their their confession was their testimony. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're saved by the word of your testimony. &gt;&gt; God don't like silent believers. &gt;&gt; He likes the ones that go, "Woo!" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He did something for me. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And here Gideon don't remember he had seen him face to face. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Katon said, he said on verse 37, he said, "Behold, I'll put fleece of wool on the floor and put dew on the fleece only." You know, about that time I would have lost. If that would have been my kid, I would have like I would have found the rod, I think. I I mean, or or switch or something. I mean, like two strikes and you're out. But I I guess we're not playing two pitch. But but like it, you know, if this is really you, after I've seen you, after you consume my food, oh boy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God did it. In verse 38, and it was so. We serve an amazing patient God. &gt;&gt; Now, that that was that was object number like vindication number three or number two depending on how you cuz first he came first the angel came when he was thrashing wheat in the wine press and then he came and consumed the meal and talked to him. He said, "I perceive." Now he's starting to catch on that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, this is like two or three. So, now we can move to verse 39. And he just wasn't there. Some there's something he he was pretty much he almost Elliot he like after one or you know two or three times you know he's like it's probably true but just to be sure. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Just to be absolutely positive. &gt;&gt; Gideon said, "God, don't be mad at me." But God, you know, Gideon might as well said, "I don't believe that." Actually, every time he was asking for a sign, &gt;&gt; he was saying, "I don't believe." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says, "More blessed is them that have believed, have not seen, and still believe." &gt;&gt; Now, I love signs, but I've had dozens of them. I was filling my iPad with testimonies. You know, you know a lot of them here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Gideon said unto God, he said, "Let not thy anger be hot against me." I That would have been about it. You know, let let me just show you how we operate. you know, uh uh this week, you know, let's bring I'm bringing it down to like where the rubber hits the road. The the greenhouse called us and they said, "We want to bring your tree to the church. That tree is to stop the sun so we can video and so we're not blinded in April." And my wife's anger was kindled. I was in the car with her. I know when it's kindled. I could see the signs. She said, "It's going to die. It's too cold. It's going to die." And I said, "Honey, honey, honey, just call them. Just ask them. Say, don't let your anger be kindled with me. But if the plant dies, will you do another miracle and bring another plant? He said it just to prove let it let it let it me prove that y'all speak to me. Now I'm going to tell you something. I believe that you need to know that you're packing Jehovah Gyra. I believe you need to know that you've been born again. And not only that, I believe you need to know that he's accepted your sacrifice and you're filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But once you know, &gt;&gt; you don't you you got to have six signs every week. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Father, &gt;&gt; I mean, he will do them. He will do them, but you won't recognize them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He will provide your needs or you know he he will do something supernatural and you say, "Oh, wow. That was a close call. The barn almost burned down." No, that wasn't a close call. That was God. That was an angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll put fleece out this time on the ground, but last time you put it on the fleece, so just in case you're not God, this time put it on the ground." And God's up in heaven going, "Oh, wow. Wow. Wow. Wow." &gt;&gt; And in verse 40, and it was so. &gt;&gt; Amen. And here, so now we see that God had promised Gideon to take over the the the Minionites and and so they were coming up into army. And so after all these signs, Gideon could now recognize that God was in their midst. But he brought all these people, thousands of them, to fight the menites. God, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I never called all these people. In Judges 7 and verse two, and the Lord said unto Gideon, "The people that are with you are too many, lest you think that you did it on your own." And by this time, Gideon was convinced. And so, you know, we've been preaching on fear for for a long time. Too long, but maybe. uh two or 3 weeks. But if you go to verse three, and so God's telling, he said, "Let all the people, you got to get rid of all these people cuz I'm going to deliver them into your hands. Get rid of all these people." &gt;&gt; So he said, "Just put it out to the people." Now watch this. I I just want to show you this. This was churchgoing regular every Sunday. Israelites. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it said, "All the ones that are fearful, go home." And they all left. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Almost all left. &gt;&gt; Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let them return and depart early. And these that return were 22,000. Thousand. Yeah. They just about all left. How do you serve God and be fearful? &gt;&gt; That's what God's trying to show us. Just trust me. &gt;&gt; Everything will be okay. If you know the the the disciples came to stop the the people that were casting out demons in Jesus' name. They said, "Bless God, they don't come to my church or they don't go to my seminary or and he said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. If they're on our side, &gt;&gt; leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you you're if God's in it, &gt;&gt; it'll be great. You don't want to be fighting against it. And if God ain't, it'll just fall down anyway. &gt;&gt; He don't need you to let it fall down. &gt;&gt; Cuz unless God builds the house, it'll fall down. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to go around saying, "Well, oh, I don't think." No. Let God do it. If God's in somebody's heart, that's between them and God. &gt;&gt; That house will be strong, a strong foundation. And if it's not, when it rains, it'll fall. I knew &gt;&gt; 22,000 left because of fear. And the Lord came to Gideon again. He said, "You still got too many." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amazing. God never Gideon never asked him for another sign. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was convinced by now. &gt;&gt; And they went to the water. And you know the story, all the ones that didn't all the ones that didn't lap like a dog, kneel down. He said, "Send them home." He said, "I want the ones that scoop the water up in their hand and drink out of their hand." Amen. &gt;&gt; And he took 300 men out of thousands and tens of thousands. &gt;&gt; And destroyed the enemy. &gt;&gt; And so God used Gideon mightily. &gt;&gt; So I want to tell you this morning, if you're Gideon, God can still use you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. But I want to get to be more than Gideon. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; I want to be get to the point that I don't have to tire your God and ask God, "Now, don't let your wrath be kindled hot against me because I'm not sure you're God." &gt;&gt; I just want to say, "I believe." &gt;&gt; And there's a way that you can be that way. When he really becomes your Jehovah Gyra, when he really becomes everything to you, &gt;&gt; when all you can think about is going home, &gt;&gt; you know, when you're away from home in the natural, all you can think of is the good times you had when you were at home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; See, I left heaven. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I left the splendor of heaven because in Genesis 1:26 and 27, God said, "Let us make man in our image." And I came out of the presence of God. And he said, "I'll send you to earth to prove to Satan that there will be a people &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that will not fall down in this age." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so all I can think of is my home memories &gt;&gt; being around my heavenly father. And so here we see the story of David. And David was just obeying his dad and and his dad sent him to pack a lunch to Israel. And David's faith was so dynamic as a boy. You know, it's no wonder, you know, if we were going to have great prayer in the church, have the kids pray for you cuz they don't know God can fail yet. &gt;&gt; They just believe him. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, you know, when you tell your kids that supper's at 6:00, they just believe that you're going to have supper. They don't doubt it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he heard a big champion of Satan, Goliath, talking and he seen all the children of Israel flee from him in verse 24. And David said, "What are you running away? Who's this devil that's bringing reproach on the children of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I you know you know the story so well. I'm going to just go through it fast. But in verse 28, David had some obstacles to go through. It was the people around him. His brother, his eldest brother said, well, his anger was kindled against David. He said, "Thou camest down hither, and where's your little sheep in the wilderness?" And he said, "I know that you're proud and naughty in your heart." Watch that. This is unbelievable. His brother thought because he was he believed God was God that he was proud and naughty. Wow. and thou art come down to see this battle. And David said, "What have I done? I just believe that God said that he would deliver us." &gt;&gt; Did I do something wrong? I was just trying to save souls for his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know when David went out to meet Goliath, Satan, when you go out to meet Satan, he will always mock you. He mocked Jesus. &gt;&gt; He mocked the prophets in the Bible. They killed them, persecuted them. But they knew all along who he really was. Yes. &gt;&gt; When Jesus showed up and the devils were there and the people, they said, "Why have you come before our time &gt;&gt; to torment us?" And so, Satan will always bluff. But it's not you coming before Satan, it's the God in you. &gt;&gt; And watch here in verse 45. And David said, then said David to the Philistines, he said, "Thou comest to me with a sword and a spear and with a shield, but I cometh to thee in the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; of hosts." &gt;&gt; David knew exactly where he was standing. I want to show you something. The difference between Gideon and David. &gt;&gt; Where was the sign? That's right. &gt;&gt; He wasn't looking for it. &gt;&gt; He was just taking a lunch to his brothers. &gt;&gt; But he couldn't help himself from defending the God that he knew he was. &gt;&gt; See, in the presence of a real believer, you couldn't mock God because because the God would show himself. Like when Jesus stood before the king and he was astounded that Jesus didn't answer him and he said, "Don't thou knowest that I have the power to take your life or not?" And Jesus said, "You don't have no power at all &gt;&gt; unless my father which is in heaven give it to you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. standing. &gt;&gt; So did David. David didn't go out there because he was naughty and proud and he thought that a little squirt was going to take over a trained soldier, a military man. But he had met the pillar of fire. He had met the pillar of fire when he was taking care of sheep &gt;&gt; in the wilderness. Just like Moses when he ran from Egypt because he hadn't met the pillar of fire yet. He'd heard about him. A lot of people have heard about him but they haven't met him. And he ran for his life and he was a trained soldier. But when the burning bush happened and it and God spoke out of the bush and said, "Take off your shoes. You're getting the ground dirty." And God spoke to him out of the bush and said, "I have come down to set my people free." Moses laid down all his weapons and took a stop and they said, "Where you going, Moses?" I'm saying, "I'm going to take over." &gt;&gt; Why? Because it wasn't Moses, it was the God that was in Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. When see, when you actually meet somebody face to face, &gt;&gt; you have your own testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as much as we love and and they testimonies edify the body and they should be, I mean, I I want to hear your testimonies, &gt;&gt; but you need your own. &gt;&gt; If you're just listening to my testimonies or others testimonies and you can't find nothing to testify of, &gt;&gt; Wow. You need to you need to search and look deeper. You need to say, "Lord, take the scales off my eyes." Like the prophet when the chariots of fire were around and his servant was there and he said, "We're going to be destroyed." And he said, "Oh, God, help that poor little boy." And the scales fell off his eyes and the mountains were filled with chariots of fire. I say, "God, help our eyes. Help the scale eyes." We've we've been around this world so long that we think that we think that this world's falling apart and it's already fell apart. But there's a God that's perfectly in control. You know, I love Job's example because when when Satan came before the presence of God, he said, "You can go this far." Do you know that same Jehovah Gyra is on the throne this morning? And it don't matter who is the leader in who country and whose country and who's got a submarine and who's got a tanker. He said you can go this far today. &gt;&gt; I'll let you know tomorrow where you can go. &gt;&gt; Cuz he controls all the things. Amen. And we can watch the news and be so bewildered because of all that's going on. &gt;&gt; Don't &gt;&gt; Don't watch too much. No, &gt;&gt; the only news I I God's going to tell you something. The only news you need to watch is for the time piece of how soon it is that we're going home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the only news. &gt;&gt; The rest is just be in be in him. Be in the word. &gt;&gt; Build an atmosphere. Have music playing. &gt;&gt; Listen to your Bible. Read your Bible. Do your devotion. Study the Bible. Be in Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the boss. &gt;&gt; Don't matter what the kids do. Don't matter what these puppets do in here. &gt;&gt; They're all controlled by one great power. &gt;&gt; That's the one I got confidence in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we see, and I want to close on this, in Genesis 22. Amen. I'm just seeing where we're at here. Genesis 22:1. I want to read this. You know, you wonder, why don't I see God like I've heard about in history? I'll answer it right here in this verse. And it came to pass after these things that God, this is what that God can hardly say. Did tempt Abraham. If God could tempt Father Abraham, whose spiritual seed you are, do you ever think God could tempt you? And he could be holding back his presence just long enough to see, I wonder if they'll really serve me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here here here's God temp how's God do that? God was tempting Abraham to see if you believe that I'm God. &gt;&gt; God tempted Abraham and said unto him,"Abraham, Abraham, here am I." And he said, "Behold, here am I." And he said, "Take thy son, thine only son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee to the land, and offer him up as a sacrifice for me. And I've preached this before. I want to tell you something. &gt;&gt; I couldn't have done her. &gt;&gt; Do you know Abraham never asked for a sign? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That that's like that's that to me that's just like unbelievable. Do you know God? Abraham never asked God, "How do I know this is you, God?" And Abraham did something else that's even this is much unbelievable. &gt;&gt; He never told his wife. I'm not saying you shouldn't tell your wife. I think you should. But Abraham never told his wife. &gt;&gt; I'm like, whoa. Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham knew God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He had to know God because we know that when God stopped him from sacrificing his son and God said, "Now I know I know that you really love me and God stopped his arm." God provided a sacrifice was a lamb in the bushes. It wasn't there before. You know, if you read the Bible and you watch about that now, you can read this in yourself in your Bible and you study this next week and you come back, you tell me, you're telling me that Abraham and his son went up and they they scoured the area for stones to build the altar. Then they scoured the area for wood. This is a key point. And branches, that's what the sheep was caught in to put on the altar. And they never seen the lamb. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra, I will provide myself &gt;&gt; a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; When God needed a sacrifice, he just said, "Okay, lamb." &gt;&gt; Abraham needs something to worship me by. &gt;&gt; My God can do that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. here. If we jump in Genesis 22, let's just go to 15 and then I'm going to go to a New Testament scripture and we're going to close on that and we're going to do communion. But Genesis 15, he said, "And the angel of the Lord came to Abraham out of heaven the second time." Oh, I pray to God he'll come to us again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again and again and again. I don't want them just on Sunday. I want him on Monday. &gt;&gt; And I want him on Tuesday. And my God works on Wednesday, too. &gt;&gt; And he's there on Thursday. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord God, please. You know, he came and he said, and he said, "By myself I have sworn." Verse 16 sayaith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son in blessings. I will bless thee and multiply. I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, as the sands are which upon the seashores, and thy seed shall progress the gates of thine enemies. &gt;&gt; In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Remember what we said at the beginning? Satan believes in Jesus, but he didn't obey him. &gt;&gt; Because thou has obeyed my voice. See, Abraham never asked it for a sign like Gideon. Even though God blessed Gideon and he had victory, but Gideon needed three signs, actually four from God to know that God was God. How many signs do you need? Will God send an angel to you like he did Gideon when he was thrashing the wheat in the wine press be enough? Wasn't for Gideon. He sent him the angel the second time when he burned up his dinner on the rock. And Gideon said, "I perceive I've seen an angel face to face." Wasn't enough for Gideon. And then when God called them out to fight the army of the m the the the army that they were coming against, he said, "Put the dew on the flax." And Gideon knew he knew he was pushing God to rebellion when he said, "Don't be angry and hot at me." But this time put the do only on the ground and not on the flax. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something this morning, church. Brother Dale's been Gideon way too long. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be Gideon. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be Gideon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Somebody asked me to do something for God. I'm just going to jump. &gt;&gt; I'll ask questions later. &gt;&gt; Yep. Just jump. I'm not Gideon. I'm Abraham. &gt;&gt; I'm David. &gt;&gt; That Goliath. You don't look big to me. All right. It's just easier. I can't miss. It's impossible to miss &gt;&gt; where where the stone hits him, he's coming down. &gt;&gt; Do you know? You know, he didn't David didn't even need to take a sword because when he fell down, didn't matter where the stone hit him, David would have bent over. &gt;&gt; Hello. You thought it had to hit him in the head. It hit him in his intellects because Goliath thought he would beat God by his brains. &gt;&gt; That's the world we're living in. We think the more education we get, the closer we get to God. &gt;&gt; But God, David could have hit him in the stomach and he would have been over. And then David could have walked up to him and took his big old sheathing sword and just cut off his head and said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Abraham, God tempted Abraham. Do you believe that you're the son of God today? The Bible says you are. We read those scriptures. The Bible says that you're sitting in heavenly places. Do you need a sign to believe that? &gt;&gt; I hope not. &gt;&gt; And blessings I'll bless thee because you've obeyed my voice &gt;&gt; because you obeyed and just took for granted that I was the ultimate power which he is. You know, I want just just in closing here, I want to mention this. In Hebrews 6:3, it said, "For when God had promised to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sweared by himself, saying, surely I will in blessings and I will bless thee and multiply, I will multiply thee." And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. Amen. If you patiently endure and you just accept God for all that he is, we want in this church, God's not in a box. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever's in his word &gt;&gt; is in this church. &gt;&gt; Whatever God is is welcome here. &gt;&gt; No boxes allowed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just paper bags. So when you get blessed, you can just tear them open. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when you walk into heaven? You know why the Bible talks about when you walk on those streets of gold that are like glass? You know why they don't have glass windows in heaven? Because they're all going to get broken out cuz the people are going to be so rejoicing and blessing and jumping and dancing. Hey, hey, watch. Watch this. &gt;&gt; What did David do when the word came back in the presence of Israel? Watch this. When you recognize that you're coming into the presence of Jehovah, &gt;&gt; David lost complete control without his gown over him. &gt;&gt; And his wife mocked him. And God immediately cursed her for life and never lifted the curse. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you recognize you're coming into the fullness of the Godhead bodily, &gt;&gt; you're not going to hold her together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to become you are becoming &gt;&gt; a part of God. I I just got a question I'm leaving with you as I close and we go into communion. You know, Abraham later in his life sent his great servant to go get Rebecca for his son. Now, he didn't know it was Rebecca to get a wife for his son. And they type Isaac types Christ perfectly. And Rebecca types you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have one question I'm going to leave with you. How in the world could a man that Rebecca had never seen before in her life? They had no Facebook, no Tik Tok, internet, whatever all those things are, no WhatsApp, no sending pictures. They've done long past the fax mail. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Rebecca was in her father's home and within eight hours, 10 hours, how did Rebecca say, "I will go. How did she say that?" A type of the bride of Christ in the Bible. You know, in Revelations says the bride says, "Come." says also that the wife has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; I'm going to answer your question for you and then we're going to close. You can come, honey. Rebecca was a blood relative to a man she had never seen. &gt;&gt; If you take that back to Genesis 1:26 and 27, let us make man in the image of God. the spirit man. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you study that out in Genesis 24:15 and Genesis 22:23, Rebecca was a great niece to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Wow. God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. I will go. I will obey. I will be I want to be a David. I want to be the three Hebrew children where where the three Hebrew we mentioned this last week, but I I just said I said I'm not even going to be careful. I'm just going to be radical. I'm not even going to be careful to answer you, King. We're not afraid of your firemen. &gt;&gt; We're not afraid of anything that you have &gt;&gt; because we know our God can save us. And if he doesn't, it makes no difference to us at all. He's still our God. &gt;&gt; We're not We're not going to be careful. We I'm going to tell you something, church. You've been careful way too long. You're afraid of fend offending the pastor. You're afraid offending the person sitting on your pew. I got a better one for you. You're afraid offending yourself, your flesh. &gt;&gt; Well, I can't look silly. &gt;&gt; That's what David's wife thought. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The silly part never crossed David's mind when he seen the tabernacle of Jehovah, the Holy of Holies, coming into his presence. &gt;&gt; This is more than I can contain. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to have heaven here &gt;&gt; before I get there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I know for beyond a shadow of a doubt that I've already tasted and seen that the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, he loves you this morning. &gt;&gt; He's just losing his mind &gt;&gt; to have you believe in him. He's just losing his mind. You just think of a a young gentleman that would ask a beautiful lady to be his wife. She has to believe in him. &gt;&gt; And here's Jehovah Gyra asking you, "Do you believe in me? &gt;&gt; Will you trust me?" No matter who bombs who and who's in control because I am Alpha and Omega. &gt;&gt; Revelations, that angel of Jehovah came down and he put his land foot on this land and said, "I'm the boss of all the countries of the world." &gt;&gt; And then he reached over here and he set it on the oceans. He said, "I'm also the boss of the oceans also. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But how many will believe? &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe. If you show me a sign, Lord God, I'll be really happy. But I still believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. Amen. We want to change the order of the service. And we normally have communion and footwashing twice a year. And we actually, for whatever reason, we never even had it last summer. And so we haven't had it since January. And then we had freezing rain and snow and and a lot of people were out. And so we're here we are into later in the year. And normally we would have this on a Sunday that's close to New Year. But if you'll forgive us, I tell you this before we read the communion scriptures that all that are trying their best and committed to serve God are welcome to participate. There's no pressure if you if you don't feel it's perfectly okay. You see, salvation is between you and God. And I would say this and the scriptures say it. We'll we'll read this. But you know, the most important thing about communion is is don't be a hypocrite. If you're not living a Christian life, &gt;&gt; don't take it. Because communion is only a symbol that you're telling the rest of the people beside you, I'm a believer. And if they know my life on Monday and it testifies against me, the Bible says that's why many sleep and are sick among you. But other than that, you know, he said that if you wouldn't partake that he couldn't even have a relationship with you. So, it's kind of a serious it's a thing where we have to say, "Hey, I have li I have mountains of faults, but my desire &gt;&gt; is to do serve God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're going to just read our Corinthians 1 11 and we have lots of fellowship and food after we have a meal after. We So what we do I just said before I I read this maybe 1 Corinthians 11 Vicki is normally if you can go to the outer side or go through the pews and we'll come by the table this way and you can go back to your seats and so we'll come by the Piano.
